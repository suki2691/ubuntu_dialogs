2005-05-16T14:31:00.000Z	NickVara		Hello... I have a couple of questions... I'm running Ubuntu on a dual-boot Dell Inspiron 9100 laptop (with WinXP Pro)...   a) Is there a way to see my Windows C:\ drive from Linux  (formatted using NTFS)  b) How do I get my wireless card working (having to run the cable 40 feet to my living room is a bit annoying)...
