2007-01-12T08:24:00.000Z	Flannel	aib	packages.ubuntu.com has a search (scroll down)
2007-01-12T08:25:00.000Z	Flannel	aib	only if you've already installed the package.  apt doesn't download any information about the contents of a package until it's installed
2007-01-16T06:03:00.000Z	Flannel	aib	why do you need to know?
