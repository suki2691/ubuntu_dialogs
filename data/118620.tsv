2008-02-17T19:27:00.000Z	larryone		I have a quick wifi related question. lshw recognises the card, but it says DISABLED. there is a hardware switch for it on the laptop. does this mean i'm ok driver wise, and just need to fiddle with getting it enabled?
2008-02-17T19:28:00.000Z	bazhang	larryone	is the switch set to on?
2008-02-17T19:28:00.000Z	bazhang	larryone	from startup or after
