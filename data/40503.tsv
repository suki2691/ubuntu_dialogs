2012-02-18T07:15:00.000Z	_schism_		can someone explain to me why we have to enter ./ to run some programs?  I have googled it quite a bit but cant seem to find an answer

2012-02-18T07:19:00.000Z	_schism_		I think I get it now.  And if more people would come in here when they have questions I don't think windoze would have any market share at all :)
