2005-07-31T10:08:00.000Z	ShadowXP		I'm planning to switch from Windows XP to Ubuntu but I have some questions before I do so.
2005-07-31T10:09:00.000Z	ShadowXP		Basically, I rely on using a wireless connection from my downstairs computer to this computer, so is it easy enough to reinstall my PCI card once I have installed it?
