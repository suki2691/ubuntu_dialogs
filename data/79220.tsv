2010-11-16T14:50:00.000Z	sevenearths		how can I switch between keyboards in ubuntu. GRUB and the login screen both recognise my laptop keyboard but when in the OS I need to plug in a USB one to type text :(

2010-11-16T14:59:00.000Z	Monotoko	sevenearths	"killall"
2010-11-16T15:00:00.000Z	Monotoko	sevenearths	why reboot?
