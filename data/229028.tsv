2005-07-22T14:11:00.000Z	Discipulus	rgould	then use the command line?
2005-07-22T14:11:00.000Z	rgould	Discipulus	looks like I have to, but nautilus is more convenient. I guess I could copy them all to one directoy and use the command line to copy them all over from there.
2005-07-22T14:12:00.000Z	Discipulus	rgould	command line is much more powerful :-P
