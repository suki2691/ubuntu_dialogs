2010-01-09T21:36:00.000Z	fluxdude		i have ubuntu with hdmi but I can't seem to get any sound out of it via hdmi
2010-01-09T21:37:00.000Z	fluxdude		alsamixer sees the IEC958 stuff but it's volume is set to zero (I unmuted it) but I cannot get the sound to change from 0
2010-01-09T21:37:00.000Z	fluxdude		any ideas?
