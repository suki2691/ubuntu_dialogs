2007-01-15T13:23:00.000Z	dromer		anyone: could it be I don't have OpenGL configed right for the game to run smoothly? I have plenty of ram (512) and a Geforce2MX on this machine (not too fancy)
2007-01-15T13:24:00.000Z	goodgerster	dromer	do you have the drivers installed for your card?
2007-01-15T13:25:00.000Z	dromer	goodgerster	oh no, I have the nv-drivers running, should I use nvidia instead for better OpenGL support?
2007-01-15T13:26:00.000Z	goodgerster	dromer	yes, you need the nvidia driver to get hardware accleration. nv is shite
