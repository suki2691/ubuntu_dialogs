2008-01-04T05:06:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor		Where do I download gedit plugins to?
2008-01-04T05:07:00.000Z	IdleOne	Alex_Gaynor	wild guess ./gedit/plugins maybe
2008-01-04T05:08:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	IdleOne	Does .gconf/apps/gedit-2/plugins/ makes sense? nothing is in there but one xml file
2008-01-04T05:09:00.000Z	IdleOne	Alex_Gaynor	looks like it might be right
