2009-09-13T13:11:00.000Z	frodon1		Hi. I want to install Ubuntu on another partition, together with Windows. However, I want that the machine automatically starts Windows, i.e. without user interaction; and only when I want to start ubuntu, it should go with user interaction. How can I do this? (Because by default it is Ubuntu that starts automatically). Thank you.
