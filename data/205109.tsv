2005-12-28T08:16:00.000Z	vblanton		Anyone know why I can view my apache2.0 webserver on any computer in the house but no one outside the house (past the router/firewall) can see my website? I have enabled port forwarding of PORT 80 on my router/firewall
2005-12-28T08:16:00.000Z	nickrud	vblanton	maybe your isp blocks 80?
2005-12-28T08:16:00.000Z	vblanton	nickrud	maybe... but would I be able to connect to my own website with my public ip if it did?
2005-12-28T08:18:00.000Z	nickrud	vblanton	I got a virtual server out in space just because of that problem
