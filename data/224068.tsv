2006-06-04T13:53:00.000Z	kameron	bulltitan	do you have codecs installed for mp3 files?
2006-06-04T13:54:00.000Z	kameron	bulltitan	try installing: gstreamer-0.10-mad.. something like that.
2006-06-04T13:54:00.000Z	kameron	bulltitan	try this: sudo apt-cache search gstreamer... then install the on that has "mad" in it.
