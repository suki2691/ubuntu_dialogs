2009-10-11T07:21:00.000Z	a_		can someone help me please? I get a "window creation error" when trying to load second life in ubuntu.
2009-10-11T07:22:00.000Z	a_		second life worked before, but I may have fooled around with something and ruined it
2009-10-11T07:24:00.000Z	a_		does anyone here use second life?
2009-10-11T07:24:00.000Z	vecto__	a_	no. Why don't play games in your real life?
