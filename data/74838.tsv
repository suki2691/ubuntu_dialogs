2009-07-27T13:10:00.000Z	xshadowx		No, long story short, I uninstalled Kubuntu after grub error 22 appeared and now I have grub error 17 and I need to at least get back in to Vista. I don't have any blank CDs and my CD burner decided to not work..so, I'm kind of stuck. I tried using a USB boot up, but that failed. So I need to figure out how to use this ms-sys program to fix vistas mbr problem.

2009-07-27T13:11:00.000Z	xshadowx		I dual booted with Vista and kubuntu. Or tried to at least.(sorry left that out)
