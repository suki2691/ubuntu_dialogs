2010-05-08T15:20:00.000Z	agoln		Ok, so I just downloaded and installed ubuntu on my Dell studio 15, but my wireless doesn't work.  I used to use Linux a long time ago (and ubuntu in 06/07 days), but i'm stuck on why it doesn't recognize my wireless and why it donesn't 'just work'.  This is totally why I usually use Windows - what do I have to do to use linux???

2010-05-08T15:23:00.000Z	agoln		When I do "ifconfig wlan0 up" I get "SIOCSIFFLAGS: no such file or directory - I've read this means somthing about firmware and shit, but where do I find how to get my wireless working
