They don't really have stores, but if you are looking for a physical place where people can help you, you might want to try to contact the Local Community team for New York.  Here's some info about them: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewYorkTeam .  They have an irc channel too at #ubuntu-ny .  But remember you can ask us questions here too
