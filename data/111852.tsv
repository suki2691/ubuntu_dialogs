2009-04-22T01:21:00.000Z	Saiki		I'm having some problems with my ubuntu install (8.04 Xubuntu). I have reciently reinstalled it completely due to unsolvable alsa issues, and I updgraded it offline. just 2 days ago it was working 100% fine. Now when I boot it it fails to load the nvidia driver I got from nvidia's site, it keeps asking me to run in low gfx mode
2009-04-22T01:21:00.000Z	Saiki		once I drop to a root shell I tried to reinstall it, and it keeps asking me to "runinit 3" so when I try the system reboots and loads back into runlevel1, so I tried to reinstall it anyway, and it still syas there's a problem and won't load it. (using an Nvidia 8400GS desktop)
2009-04-22T01:21:00.000Z	Saiki		anyone know how to fix this?
