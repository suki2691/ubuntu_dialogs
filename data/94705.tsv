2008-04-22T11:06:00.000Z	kc		when y'all get done with that, i have a question about x11 forwarding and i'm not even sure how to google about it: i ssh -Y from my hardy box into another box (fedora) and try to run firefox. i get firefox running on my local machine, not the remote machine. is ubuntu trying to outsmart me?
2008-04-22T11:08:00.000Z	slowlearner	kc	lol, means your probably not connected to the remote machine when you issue the command
2008-04-22T11:09:00.000Z	kc	slowlearner	thanks but i'm pretty sure i'm not that tired. prompt shows other hostname and ifconfig shows ip info expected on remote machine
2008-04-22T11:11:00.000Z	slowlearner	kc	now that would be something..
