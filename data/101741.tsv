2008-01-31T02:10:00.000Z	OldGreg		hi there. quick question about dual-booting: I installed Xubuntu on my laptop a while back, and need to update the firmware on my DVD-ROM drive. The executable is Win-only, so I got Wine running and I get an error like "cannot determine system power state, operation aborted". I have no idea how to resolve this within wine, so i figured I'd install WinXP and rock a dual boot - problem is, i don't know if that will work
2008-01-31T02:11:00.000Z	OldGreg		I already have linux, and therefore GRUB, installed, and I fear it will get real messy real quick
