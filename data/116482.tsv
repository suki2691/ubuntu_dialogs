2007-10-21T13:07:00.000Z	Boumboum6	neur1	yes. it'll just resume when you boot up again.
2007-10-21T13:09:00.000Z	Boumboum6	neur1	:)  I went though that myself a number of times--I do not have 24/7 internet..I get online at wifi hotspots at the library...and have to interrupt downloads when the library closes. :)
