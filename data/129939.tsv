2009-09-07T00:25:00.000Z	dto		hi. i upgraded to Karmic, the new generic kernel works fine, new rt kernel that comes with karmic hangs for about 4 minutes just after loading wireless driver, then gets to the ubuntu X splash screen and shows a rotating flickering mouse cursor forever while we wait for the login screen that never comes. meanwhile a login works fine on one of the VTs
