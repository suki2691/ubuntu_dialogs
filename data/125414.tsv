2008-04-05T06:24:00.000Z	nikrud	bebin	probably your router, you'll need to use your router manual
2008-04-05T06:24:00.000Z	nikrud	bebin	you can ensure that it's not ubuntu by typing   sudo iptables -F  , clears any possible firewall rules on the computer
2008-04-05T06:26:00.000Z	nikrud	bebin	by default there is no firewall. Unless you intentionally set one up with firestarter or some other tool
