2011-05-20T17:23:00.000Z	kbni		Greetings #ubuntu. This is the closest freenode has to a hangout for girls, and I wanted some advice on using hair dye. The product I have does not specify whether or not my hair should be dry or wet before beginning. What is the norm with these things?
2011-05-20T17:24:00.000Z	kbni		I feel like you guys are missing out on an oppurtunity to be actually helpful.
2011-05-20T17:24:00.000Z	kbni		let's be honest ubuntu doesn't have many serious users who would require actual technical support
2011-05-20T17:25:00.000Z	Ileden	kbni	why do you say "you guys" if you acknwledge this is a hangout for us girls?
