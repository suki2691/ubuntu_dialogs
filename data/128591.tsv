2007-07-08T12:52:00.000Z	Fyda	relativeownershi	Yes, but it doesn't handle applications, nor does it match apps/commands as you type :(
2007-07-08T12:53:00.000Z	relativeownershi	Fyda	<shrugs> guess i'm not exactly catching your meaning. like a combo between autofind in nautilus and command completion in a terminal?
2007-07-08T12:53:00.000Z	Fyda	relativeownershi	Yes, something like that.
