2011-11-14T07:02:00.000Z	somsip	gridbag	I get it where 'a script has stopped' and tbs refuse to close after that and I have to restart. Same on 7 and now on 8
2011-11-14T07:03:00.000Z	gridbag	somsip	i don't get how a dns lookup in a part of one page freezes all all open windows. isn't this threaded? why would a script infinite loop wedge other threads?
2011-11-14T07:04:00.000Z	somsip	gridbag	far too technical question for me
