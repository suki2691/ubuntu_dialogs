2007-04-07T06:39:00.000Z	Derek_Russo		Hi everyone, I just installed ubuntu for the first time and there are a couple of problems I would like some help fixing
2007-04-07T06:40:00.000Z	Derek_Russo		First, when I try to click on volume control, it tells me "No volume control GStreamer plugins and/or devices found"
2007-04-07T06:41:00.000Z	Derek_Russo		though I do hear a noise when ubuntu starts up - I'm not sure how to install the drivers I need
2007-04-07T06:41:00.000Z	cables	Derek_Russo	it doesn't support your soundcard, but this may help
