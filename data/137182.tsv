2007-07-27T15:11:00.000Z	fsckr		when creating a conkyrc file using gedit I am trying to have my setup on one line, but when i get to the end of the screen in gedit it automatically starts me on a second line?  What editor can I use to have my setup one straight line?  I hope you understand what I mean.
2007-07-27T15:11:00.000Z	fsckr		example I am referring to is this http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=39096&d=1185478216
