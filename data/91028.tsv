2009-01-30T04:23:00.000Z	mgolisch	zleap	they should do that bydefault if you have ubuntu
2009-01-30T04:24:00.000Z	mgolisch	zleap	probably the filesystem is still marked mounted and thats why the automatic mount fails
2009-01-30T04:25:00.000Z	mgolisch	zleap	like you just unpluged it without using the green unplug device thing in windows or such
