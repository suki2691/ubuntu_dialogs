2010-08-11T20:55:00.000Z	sudosudo		I'd like to know: why do Debian latest release's repositorie is so outdated when it comes to applications such as aMsn or VideoLan? Is it that debian goes several steps behind where ubuntu goes?
2010-08-11T20:57:00.000Z	sudosudo		what happens if I install an application from one repositorie in a different version?
