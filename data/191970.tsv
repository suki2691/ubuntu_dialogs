2006-08-22T10:50:00.000Z	bj_		Hey all, flash is locking up firefox. when I hit back. Closing a tab is OK, but the back button locks the browser when any flash is being displayed. I looked around and I had 2 versions of flash installed, so I fixed that and now only have 1, but it still does it. The only relevant thing I changed was a new mobo/cpu. I went dual core, and everything seems to be working OK besides this
2006-08-22T10:18:00.000Z	bj_		Hello, I installed a new mobo / cpu and am having some stability problems. Most stuff seems OK, but coming back from a screensaver will sometimes lock up the box. Is there a command I should run to reset ubuntu for the new board
