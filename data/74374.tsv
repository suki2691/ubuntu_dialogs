2009-06-28T17:25:00.000Z	oskar-	arthur	 where does it hang? does it show any reactions to keypresses? have you tried to remove the "quiet" kernel option temporarily?
2009-06-28T17:28:00.000Z	oskar-	arthur	 if you have grub, go into its menu at boot time, select the entry, press e, then the kernel line, again e, there the option are at the end of the line. if you remove them this way, this will only have effect for the following boot (with "b")
2009-06-28T17:30:00.000Z	oskar-	arthur	 maybe, maybe not...
