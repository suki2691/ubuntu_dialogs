2008-08-09T03:07:00.000Z	djGentoo		So, can anyone help me with my partitioning problem?
2008-08-09T03:08:00.000Z	djGentoo		Simply put, the Ubuntu installer, GParted, and fdisk all fail to recognize that I have any partitions.

2008-08-09T03:09:00.000Z	djGentoo	troxor	My partitions are already set up.
