2009-09-17T06:23:00.000Z	aliendude5300	cretep1950	That's easy. Get rid of Lotus Notes client and get Zimbra Open Source edition. http://www.zimbra.com/ :P

2009-09-17T06:28:00.000Z	aliendude5300	cretep1950	might be worth a try with Zimbra, since that doesnt require Wine to run... then if it doesnt work, I'd try using Wine
