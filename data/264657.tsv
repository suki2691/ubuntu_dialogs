2005-10-29T11:45:00.000Z	cyberlok		doea anyone know how I would tell some part of ubuntu to reinstall all packages that are installed on my machine... some guy thought he be smart and just delete a file or 2 and now packages are all wierd, but if I can get it to just go through the install proccess it would go through during an normal install I think it would resolve my issue

2005-10-29T11:46:00.000Z	cyberlok		I been slowly finding and reinstalling each package to get this thing operational again
