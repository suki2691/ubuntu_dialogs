2011-02-22T03:48:00.000Z	ohsix	xomp	you probably are best served by checkint out ratbox or the ircd you want to use from source control and running it as your user
2011-02-22T03:49:00.000Z	xomp	ohsix	so ratbox is pretty easy to setup?
2011-02-22T03:49:00.000Z	ohsix	xomp	they're all not very hard to set up, but ratbox has block not line based configs, so it is a bit easier
