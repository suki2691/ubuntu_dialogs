2005-10-20T14:41:00.000Z	frank23	rick__	ath0 means your using the madwifi driver
2005-10-20T14:43:00.000Z	frank23	rick__	I guess... you are certainly using the best driver now. I don't know what happened before
2005-10-20T14:44:00.000Z	frank23	rick__	oh... well now you are free of windows drivers ;-)
