2010-02-18T13:58:00.000Z	Xaero252	Jordan_U	nmap is indeed a useful utility, but it only allows me to scan a specific IP adress for a listening port, it doesnt allow me to see if a device is attached to a static ip adress
2010-02-18T13:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Xaero252	What do you mean by "attatched to a static ip address" ? nmap can scan ranges of ports and ip addresses, what more do you need?
2010-02-18T14:00:00.000Z	Xaero252	Jordan_U	hmmm, I'll check it out, is there any way I can pass it a level of verbosity (since when I tried to do nmap 192.168.2-254 it doesnt say anything and kinda just... sits)?
