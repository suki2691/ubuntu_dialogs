2007-09-19T05:20:00.000Z	TehBrandon		alright, i have a noob question here: how do I make /home/brandon/Desktop/Link to Program Files/Steam able to be cd'd to in console?
2007-09-19T05:21:00.000Z	TehBrandon		um
2007-09-19T05:21:00.000Z	jrib	TehBrandon	cd "/some/path/with spaces"
2007-09-19T05:23:00.000Z	jrib	TehBrandon	cd /some/path/with\ spaces    works too, but there's not reason the last way shouldn't work
