2009-07-02T08:20:00.000Z	scunizi	Jimmio	motivation is an emotional response.. sometimes you just have to "do it" with no motovation..
2009-07-02T08:21:00.000Z	Jimmio	scunizi	I'd love to do that... But I am in the position of "Why bother? It's not like anyone will want to use it..". This happens a lot when I'm writing software... I have to find something motivational.
