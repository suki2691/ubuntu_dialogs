2007-05-29T08:52:00.000Z	rainbowsdonthide		I deleted my bottom panel somehow, so I thought "no biggie" and I made a new panel placing my desktop selector, just like how it was before... but because I made the panel myself, when I minimize stuff it doesn't even show it on the bottom bar... how do I get it to do that... can I revert my bottom panel to the one that shows minimized programs or what?

2007-05-29T08:55:00.000Z	rainbowsdonthide	kritzstapf	OK, in settings or... where is it?
2007-05-29T08:56:00.000Z	kritzstapf	rainbowsdonthide	right click on the panel and then sth like "add to panel.."
