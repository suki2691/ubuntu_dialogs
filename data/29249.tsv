2010-07-10T22:31:00.000Z	Caer		where could I ask my performance related question on ubuntu-server?
2010-07-10T22:31:00.000Z	thune3	Caer	maybe run transmission with idle i/o priority? ionice -c 3 -p `pidof transmission`
2010-07-10T22:33:00.000Z	Caer	thune3	thanks for the pointer, and I hadn't thought of IO, doesn't it influence the load average btw?
2010-07-10T22:35:00.000Z	thune3	Caer	i'm not sure what you mean. nice/renice might also help.
