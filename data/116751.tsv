2007-10-14T12:01:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Bneriusus	it's possible, just change what repositories you point to. I certainly wouldn't recommend it
2007-10-14T12:02:00.000Z	Bneriusus	Fryguy--	Why don`t??
2007-10-14T12:02:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Bneriusus	because it's not officially released, and certainly still has some bugs in it
