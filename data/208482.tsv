2005-11-08T08:05:00.000Z	Kumo		hi guys, I need help with my keyboard please, I upgraded to breeze and my keyboard in gdm doesn't work
2005-11-08T08:07:00.000Z	Baal	Kumo	have you checked to see if the keyboard came unplugged?
2005-11-08T08:08:00.000Z	Kumo	Baal	yes i checked, It does work outside gdm, is rare because I can use numbers (from the right side of the keyboard) but not letters
