2010-05-11T03:11:00.000Z	dpratt		trying to update a new install of 10.4 and I'm a little confused...
2010-05-11T03:12:00.000Z	dpratt		I have a dialog here with title "Configuring grub-pc"; there's a "Forward" button that appears unresponsive; there's also a check box "Continue without installing GRUB"
2010-05-11T03:12:00.000Z	dpratt		what should I do?
2010-05-11T03:12:00.000Z	distress	dpratt	what can you do ?
