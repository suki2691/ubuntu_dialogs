2012-10-19T14:36:00.000Z	carlisle_	Jordan_U	where are the LDM headers being stored on disk? Is it possible to nuke them with 'dd' ?
2012-10-19T14:36:00.000Z	carlisle_		(a la using dd to nuke a partition table)
2012-10-19T14:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	carlisle_	It is certainly possible to nuke then, though beyond them being near both the beginning and end of the disk I don't know the exact blocks to nuke.
2012-10-19T14:38:00.000Z	carlisle_	Jordan_U	what could possibly go wrong? :P
