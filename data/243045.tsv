2005-04-24T09:06:00.000Z	linuxpoet	holycow	/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-04-24T09:07:00.000Z	holycow	linuxpoet	i know, where exactly do you force a 1024x76 to either be 60hz or 75? i don't see the relationship between default/current refresh rate and default/current resolution?
2005-04-24T09:08:00.000Z	holycow	linuxpoet	no worries :)
