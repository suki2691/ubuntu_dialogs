2007-08-30T05:35:00.000Z	jrib	Joeb454	what are you trying to install?
2007-08-30T05:36:00.000Z	jrib	Joeb454	generally, there's no reason to have the latest version of something.  Why do you need the latest version?
2007-08-30T05:38:00.000Z	jrib	Joeb454	I'd stay away from .package, stick to the repos and keep a healthy system :)
