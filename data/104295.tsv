2011-08-16T03:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wolFmitchell	boot to the windows install CD and install it, part of the process is partitioning
2011-08-16T03:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wolFmitchell	then I suggest you ask in ##windows
2011-08-16T03:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wolFmitchell	the fact that ubuntu is installed is moot, the installer wil allow you to remove the partitions and instal as you wish
