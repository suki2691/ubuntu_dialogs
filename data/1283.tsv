2012-09-04T00:35:00.000Z	bnwkeys		Hi Guys, new dilemma, hoping someone can point me in the right direction.  I had first partitioned my HDD and installed ubuntu, leaving a part for XP.  Then I installed XP, but it had to inactivate  my logical partitions to do the install.  Now it won't let me reactivate the logical partitions cuz they aren't primary.  Anybody have a way to reestablish dualboot so i can recover my ubuntu OS?

2012-09-04T00:37:00.000Z	bnwkeys	subz3r0	nobody gave me that advice, I wanted ubuntu first cuz I'm making it a dev platform. I'm still a noob, but anyways, am I screwed? I don't really want to reinstall both OS's again, but will if I have to. :(
