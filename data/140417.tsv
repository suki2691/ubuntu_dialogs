2007-04-10T12:18:00.000Z	famicommie		Okay, I am trying to set up Conky to display the number of unread messages in my mailspool (/var/mail/<user>) but Conky doesn't seem to recognize it. A thorough reading of the docs don't indicate any variables that I can set to adjust where conky looks. How would I change the systemwide path to point to my mail spool?
2007-04-10T12:19:00.000Z	Nubbie	famicommie	why not just set up Evolution to read your mail spool?
2007-04-10T12:20:00.000Z	famicommie	Nubbie	because I like mutt. Also, either way, I would like for conky to display if I have any unread messages before I open up *any* e-mail client.
