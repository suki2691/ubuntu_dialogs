2011-09-18T18:07:00.000Z	figaccio		hey guys, how do i rebuild my partition table... i changed the PCB of my external hard drive... now the partition table is missing... it's a 1TB harddisk, but i'm wondering why fdisk detects it as a 2199MB disk
2011-09-18T18:07:00.000Z	figaccio		any idea?
2011-09-18T18:08:00.000Z	tjoy	figaccio	that sounds like a mess, why did you change the pcb?
2011-09-18T18:11:00.000Z	tjoy	figaccio	yikes.  that's not an ubuntu problem, though.  go ask in #hardware, maybe.
