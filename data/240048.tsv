2005-06-19T09:22:00.000Z	ernesto		thoreau and everyone: im completely newbie in linux. i installed ubuntu on a partition and it runs well but i just can open one program. i cant open gaim and firefox at same time,for example
2005-06-19T09:23:00.000Z	ernesto		thoreau, so when i try open 2 programs at same time,  the computer freezes and the hd runs and dont stop until i reset the coumputer
2005-06-19T09:24:00.000Z	nickrud	ernesto	in my limited experience, that makes no sense
2005-06-19T09:25:00.000Z	nickrud	ernesto	it's really weird, as thoreauputic says, try running some stuff from the terminal
