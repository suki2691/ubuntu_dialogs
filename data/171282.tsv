2006-08-11T13:04:00.000Z	g-unit		Been trying to configure ldap-auth, but "getent passwd <userid>" returns no data from a known userid on my ldap server. Any help is appreciated.

2006-08-11T13:05:00.000Z	g-unit	trappist	Oops, thought that was done by the script. Let me check.
2006-08-11T13:09:00.000Z	g-unit	trappist	You're correct, the configure script didn't edit nsswitch.conf. Thanks for the reminder.
