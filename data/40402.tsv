2009-12-22T12:15:00.000Z	cynicist	phoenixzorn	probably due to the fact that the most notable changes are ui or window manager changes, makes it feel like a service pack rather than a new OS
2009-12-22T12:17:00.000Z	cynicist	phoenixzorn	no they are very similar under the hood. Vista was terrible mostly because of buggy drivers and a few bugs that windows fixed for 7
