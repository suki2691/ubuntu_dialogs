2012-03-04T12:06:00.000Z	johnnycr		hey all, I just installed 11.10 on a secondary pc and I'm very new to linux, and I'm having trouble getting my usb wireless adapter to work.  Can anyone give me a hand?
2012-03-04T12:07:00.000Z	johnnycr		nice, I'm not the only one in this boat!
2012-03-04T12:09:00.000Z	johnnycr		it says I'm connected but my browser gives me nothing
