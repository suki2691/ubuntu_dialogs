2005-04-11T10:54:00.000Z	prego	julius_	seems that is being placed right now. not yet fully there
2005-04-11T10:55:00.000Z	julius_	freet	I've installed kubuntu-desktop package in hoary and it installed the whole KDE 3.4. It works OK, but don't expect it to be as "clean & simple" as ubuntu with gnome is :P
2005-04-11T10:55:00.000Z	prego	julius_	clean & simple & KDE should not be at the same sentence. (yes, this is a flame ;-P)
