2006-08-12T16:30:00.000Z	mopflite	cica	I know a little about getting a juniper ssl vpn running on dapper with dapper as the client - there's fairly specialised though really
2006-08-12T16:32:00.000Z	cica	mopflite	& looksaus: I get the following error when I run vpnclient connect {VPN}: Could not attach to driver. Is kernel module loaded? The application was unable to communicate with the VPN sub-system.
