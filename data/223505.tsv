2005-10-09T05:52:00.000Z	cafuego_	prower	That depends on how stable you want it.
2005-10-09T05:53:00.000Z	cafuego_	prower	If it's a production box, wait for a month after that even.
2005-10-09T05:55:00.000Z	prower	cafuego_	Ahh, got it...well, I more or less meant "stable" as in installing the final version rather than one of the Colony releases :>
