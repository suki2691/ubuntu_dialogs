2010-01-02T07:23:00.000Z	Polterge|st		can anyone in here tell me what the command is to reconfigure the keyboard layout using dpkg ?
2010-01-02T07:24:00.000Z	Polterge|st		a friend of mine is using Mint and I cannot find the Mint channel but since it is based on Ubuntu I thought trying what works in Ubuntu for that might possibly work in Mint also , so I am wanting to know how to reconfigure the keyboard package in Ubuntu
2010-01-02T07:25:00.000Z	Polterge|st		I do not know if the package names are the same in Ubuntu and Mint for kdb because different repos but I thought it might be worth a try
2010-01-02T07:25:00.000Z	m0se5	Polterge|st	I think it's sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
