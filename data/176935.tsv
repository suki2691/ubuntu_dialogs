2006-06-23T08:30:00.000Z	Gumb1		Hi.  I have a very little bit of  experience with both Debian  and ubuntu.  I can install either one just fine.  I plan on making my laptop dual boot tomorrow morning.  I'm debating whether to go with ubuntu or debian.  The single most important thing to me is having good hardware support for laptops: I want powerstepping, hibernate, etc. and good battery life.  What's the trade off with debian & ubuntu???

2006-06-23T08:31:00.000Z	Gumb1	spikeb	 Looks like ubuntu has more regular release schedule (6 months) so its kernel would be more up-to-date...  so maybe that's the way to go?
