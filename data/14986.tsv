2011-04-28T18:09:00.000Z	HF_acid	ubuntutryout777	that's typical of the live cd, I'm not sure if you can force enable them, but after install unity and the like worked just fine
2011-04-28T18:11:00.000Z	ubuntutryout777	HF_acid	you mean after you installed the ubuntu on harddrive, or do you have to install unity manually? i thought its on the ISO already.
2011-04-28T18:11:00.000Z	HF_acid	ubuntutryout777	after I installed on the harddrive, it's on the iso but I don't think it's enabled during livecd runs
