How can I do something like that when I insert the usb stick itself? Seems difficult but that will make the difference for the user, who just switched from windows.

2011-04-27T18:55:00.000Z	vincenzoml	jatt	if I blacklist the module then it would not be inserted even when I insert the usb stick, right?
