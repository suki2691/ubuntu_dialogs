2012-06-19T17:05:00.000Z	res_		I just compiled a new kernel, is i possible to copy my existing  drivers to the new one ?
2012-06-19T17:05:00.000Z	agc93	res_	were they baked in or built as kernel modules?
2012-06-19T17:07:00.000Z	res_	agc93	The older kernel is from the default installation. I just compiled a new one and added it the grub menu. I just wanted to make sure that when I boot into the new kernel, all the drivers are there
2012-06-19T17:07:00.000Z	res_	agc93	usr13 My defaul kernel version is 3.2.26 while I am compiling 2.6.36.4
