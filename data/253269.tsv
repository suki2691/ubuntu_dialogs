2005-02-10T14:57:00.000Z	trey3	mojo_	its cuz Flash for linux wants to use raw ALSA... but ESD is occupying your sound card  :/
2005-02-10T14:58:00.000Z	mojo_	trey3	COOL.  But do I *need* ESD?  Besides that, I have two sound cards... motherboard sound and Audigy2ZS.  Can't I just use ESD for one and drop it on the other?
2005-02-10T14:59:00.000Z	mojo_	trey3	Good to have an explanation.  yeah, it is AC97 codec and does sound crappy compared to the Audigy2.
