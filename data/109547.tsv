2007-12-21T17:19:00.000Z	apfel_		what is the password I need to enter for "System / Administration / ..." (in gnome)?  I set the root password but this does not work there
2007-12-21T17:19:00.000Z	sKy\	apfel_	in ubuntu there is no root afaik. you must use sudo
2007-12-21T17:20:00.000Z	sKy\	apfel_	there are some instructions on google to enable root anyway, but you won`t need it. just use sudo
2007-12-21T17:21:00.000Z	apfel_	sKy\	thanks but I already enabled it and I like stuff like "su"ing without a password (wheel).  I just didn't know the other password, which is just the one of my user
