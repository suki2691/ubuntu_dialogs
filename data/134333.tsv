2007-06-07T14:01:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	LjL	really?  i've *always* had to type in sudo.  ??
2007-06-07T14:02:00.000Z	LjL	dawn_chorus	you you don't. "apt-get install" wants sudo, since you're going to make changes to system stuff. "apt-cache search" just shows you the list of packages, and any user can call it.
2007-06-07T14:03:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	LjL	huh.  imagine that.  :)
