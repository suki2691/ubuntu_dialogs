2007-10-31T22:07:00.000Z	tico55		I am new to Linux and I'm having issues with my laptop picking up the network card can someone help
2007-10-31T22:08:00.000Z	MilhousePunkRock	tico55	What's the problem? A little more info would be helpful
2007-10-31T22:09:00.000Z	MilhousePunkRock	tico55	Great, that should be an atheros based chipset, I have the same (T23)
2007-10-31T22:34:00.000Z	MilhousePunkRock	tico55	So you know your chipset now, IIRC, it should be pretty easy to get it working. The Docs have everything you need...
