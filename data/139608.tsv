2007-04-12T06:00:00.000Z	cblack0	roadfish	interesting. I am ok with that, I just want to be able to install on ONLY the hda3/sda3 I put aside for ubuntu
2007-04-12T06:02:00.000Z	roadfish	cblack0	oops, see my message to myself above
2007-04-12T06:06:00.000Z	roadfish	cblack0	beats me what's happening. I'm having a bit of trouble with one of my eSATA drives but this hdg-renamed-as-sda works for me.
