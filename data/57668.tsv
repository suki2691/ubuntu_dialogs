2011-07-16T16:40:00.000Z	johna		I  have had to rebuild me server - was running Centos 5.5 - but I am thinking of moving over to Ubuntu 10.04+. What is/are the best tools for administering a family server - phenom II x4, 8Gb, 6Tb hdd. Is LVM worth it? what would be an optimal partitioning scheme? ...

2011-07-16T16:51:00.000Z	johna	nightrid3r	the trouble with zentyal and other is that they tend to impose their ideas as to configs, eg, their postfix setup uses quarantine, whereas I drop anything that even remotely smells of spam; as my famuly is spread of 3 of the 5 continents I want things like webdav... and I ma not sure that zentyal et al support suchthings?
