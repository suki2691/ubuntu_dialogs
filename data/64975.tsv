2010-03-25T06:39:00.000Z	tp2		whitedawn - very new to ubuntu. all my *nix experience is Sun Solaris/HP-UX/AS400.  Very new to Linux in general.  The way you describe 'under sys/adm/syn top bar' it sounds very gui like?  my install of server sits at command prompt after login etc. did i miss an install option to get the synaptic tool?

2010-03-25T07:08:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tp2	sudo -i
