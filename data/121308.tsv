I was trying to use Sabayon and Pessulus yesterday and it appears to have done something to my default desktop settings -- I get a default GNOME icon set, a panel with nothing on it (and about two inches wide), no default background, etc.  I think this has to do with gconf, but I can't seem to find out how to set it back to "defaults".
