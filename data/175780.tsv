2010-04-16T02:35:00.000Z	bluefox83	vans	there's already software in linux to make it act like a router, it's called iptables...not for a beginner though
2010-04-16T02:36:00.000Z	vans	bluefox83	I'm not exactly a beginner but I'm certainly not an expert either. What do you mean by "not for a beginner"?
2010-04-16T02:36:00.000Z	bluefox83	vans	eh, iptables isn't user friendly, it's all config file
