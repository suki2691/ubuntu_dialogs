2009-06-21T07:06:00.000Z	kwtm_	Warp4	I have everything set up okay on the ubuntu machine.  Do you know what I need to do on the WIndows machine?
2009-06-21T07:06:00.000Z	Warp4	kwtm_	is samba running on the ubuntu machine?
2009-06-21T07:07:00.000Z	kwtm_	Warp4	Yes, samba is already running on ubuntu.  I don't need help with ubuntu.  I need help with MS WIndows.  I haven't used it since Win2k came out.
