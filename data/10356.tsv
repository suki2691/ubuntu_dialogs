2011-08-16T18:48:00.000Z	nodestool		like rdesktop but where the server is ubuntu not windows
2011-08-16T18:49:00.000Z	drussell	nodestool	it's very similar... just called, remote desktop, examples of which are vnc, or possibly LTSP depending on how complex you want to go
2011-08-16T18:54:00.000Z	nodestool	drussell	vnc and there are packages for that i am guessing
