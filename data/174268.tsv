2006-07-28T10:27:00.000Z	Bonez56	tokenbad	i also had this problem. run it as standalone instead of inetd or xinetd
2006-07-28T10:28:00.000Z	tokenbad	Bonez56	ok so just edit the conf file and make it standalone?
2006-07-28T10:29:00.000Z	Bonez56	tokenbad	use dpkg to reconfigure proftpd and it should pop up with the blue screen that asks you how you want to run it
