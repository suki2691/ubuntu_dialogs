2009-05-30T20:17:00.000Z	Kalmi_	dan67	no
2009-05-30T20:17:00.000Z	Kalmi_	dan67	I have ubuntu installed on an extranl usb hdd and it work no matter what computer it is plugged into :)
2009-05-30T20:18:00.000Z	dan67	Kalmi_	thanks, I thought not. The only thing different is that this new mobo has on board wifi. But I will probably not use it anyway
