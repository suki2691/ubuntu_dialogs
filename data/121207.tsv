2007-09-24T15:31:00.000Z	cosmodad	kilonux	it'll only mount that way if you have a corresponding entry in /etc/fstab.
2007-09-24T15:32:00.000Z	kilonux	cosmodad	 so it is something one does in a shell, and not at all write into fstab?
2007-09-24T15:33:00.000Z	cosmodad	kilonux	correct. The fstab line would be a little bit longer.
