2008-06-04T15:25:00.000Z	drash	zetheroo	looking at your paste i'd go with the new one (you could make a backup of the old one first to be able to roll back if trouble occurs)
2008-06-04T15:31:00.000Z	drash	zetheroo	it's a mimetype list, sort of a guide to gnome to open the correct application for all the different types of files you have on your system
