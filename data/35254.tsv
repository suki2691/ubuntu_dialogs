2012-02-21T20:19:00.000Z	supNow		ok seems to have calmed down a little in here I'd like to repost my unanswered question
2012-02-21T20:19:00.000Z	supNow		so this morning I wanted to check out the gnome packages... sudo apt-get install gnome (TAB) kept hitting more and suddenly it started installing a million things. Anyway to undo this?
2012-02-21T20:20:00.000Z	supNow		is there a place I can see recently installed packages?
