2012-09-07T15:55:00.000Z	Nordom		well I got 1tera for my OS needs, and to behonest I really dont want to partion... feel like taking all my saved game data and wipe everything... just to try something new... not wise I know, but it looks like must games that I thought could ONLY run in windows work on linux with a little bit support required.... but before I do anything rash how fast does wine get updated? Like if steam updated
2012-09-07T15:55:00.000Z	Nordom		some game how long is the delay usually if its not normally supported by linux?
