2010-09-01T09:53:00.000Z	matthewopersico		Hello. I have a laptop - AMD Sempron2800+  .755 GH and 640 RAM. Yeah it's old and XP takes forever to boot. Can I put Ubuntu on this with reasonable performance? Do I use Desktop or Netbook version. Thanks

2010-09-01T09:58:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	matthewopersico	i would say it depends more on your personal needs for the machine. I can't stand netbooks, but the ubuntu netbook version is really cool
