2008-07-03T18:38:00.000Z	rljs		Firefox 3.0 keeps freezing at random - sometimes for variable lengths of time, sometimes permanently. What steps do I take?
2008-07-03T18:40:00.000Z	rljs		I have attempted a { sudo apt-get install firefox } to uninstall and reinstall it, but this did nothing to help.

2008-07-03T18:46:00.000Z	rljs	fde	The method you offered { sudo aptitude reinstall firefox3 } completed successfully, but did not resolve the problem.
