2011-07-06T19:38:00.000Z	sktn07		would anyone tell me : why in command "ls /bin" shows something( like su , mount ...) highlighted?
2011-07-06T19:39:00.000Z	sipior	sktn07	those binaries have the setuid bit set.
2011-07-06T19:41:00.000Z	sktn07	sipior	what you mean by setuid bit set?
2011-07-06T19:42:00.000Z	sipior	sktn07	have a look at the chmod man page.
