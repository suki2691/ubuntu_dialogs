2006-08-24T05:48:00.000Z	hth	exobuzz	ill take it u have the link.. im not a well experienced linux users i have a copy of ubuntu alternate install right now
2006-08-24T05:48:00.000Z	exobuzz	hth	i dont have a link handy but google probably knows where it is. first you have to find the gentoo wiki and then search for "raid howto" :)
