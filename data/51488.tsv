2011-04-29T21:51:00.000Z	eigba		How is everyone liking unity? I like the overal layout however it's going to take a lot of modifying for me
2011-04-29T21:51:00.000Z	eigba		I perfoer gnome 3 for sure
2011-04-29T21:52:00.000Z	rcmaehl	eigba	it's ok but I recommend setting the unity shortcut key to ctrl+super
