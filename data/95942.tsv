2008-04-01T06:49:00.000Z	Groty		Hello, I have a question about Chat Clients/SMS clients
2008-04-01T06:50:00.000Z	Groty		Thank bazhang
2008-04-01T06:51:00.000Z	Groty		So, I've used Yahoo IM for years for work.  I've become addicted to the SMS client in the newer versions, so much better than sending a text through my phone.  I've noticed Pidgin doesn't support the feature and the latest versions of YIM don't work in Wine.  Is there another option?
