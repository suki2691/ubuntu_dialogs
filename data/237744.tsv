2008-04-14T16:55:00.000Z	lartza_		Why does firefox sometimes detect sites to ISO-8859-1 when they are UTF-8? I have set defualt encoding to UTF-8 but the autodetect overruns it. Some sites work and some not.
2008-04-14T16:57:00.000Z	lartza_		where is the seting?
2008-04-14T16:57:00.000Z	lartza_		I have it off too!
