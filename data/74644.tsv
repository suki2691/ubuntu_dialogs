2008-11-11T00:27:00.000Z	RobertTables		Ive doing a bit of reading up on the Hardy LTS release and there seems to be a lot of bad press about it(Samba etc), have things ironed themselves out now? or should I go Ibex? Comments anyone?
2008-11-11T00:28:00.000Z	genii	RobertTables	Hardy will have updates as long as it is supported, Intrepid is an intermediate release
2008-11-11T00:29:00.000Z	RobertTables	genii	so which would I be better off going for? Intrepid/Hardy - Any major changes?
2008-11-11T00:30:00.000Z	genii	RobertTables	Hardy is the more prudent choice for the time being
