2006-08-24T08:23:00.000Z	supernix		I thought about installing ubuntu but when I went to try and install ubuntu-desktop it gave a warning about breaking but did not say what it would break
2006-08-24T08:24:00.000Z	sethk	supernix	give us the exact message, we'll tell you what it means
2006-08-24T08:24:00.000Z	supernix	sethk	it does not give any message just said break how can I find out what the message might be ?
2006-08-24T08:25:00.000Z	sethk	supernix	it can't just say break things, it has to say something about what you are doing.  Do you mean during the boot loader installation?
