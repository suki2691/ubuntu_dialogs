2008-02-06T17:44:00.000Z	Bodsda	fragged[away]	u dont win, if i press ctrl+alt it sends me computer into an epileptic fit for exactly 3.32 minuts ,. then returns to normal
2008-02-06T17:46:00.000Z	fragged[away]	Bodsda	I presume thats sarcasm, but if not I'd recommend getting a new keyboard, they has the power to take out motherboards... In fact plugging a PS/2 in while computer is on can even do that, moreso on old computers, but i found out the hard/fun way - seeing as it wasnt my computer
2008-02-06T17:47:00.000Z	Bodsda	fragged[away]	my screen goes black,.,. then fills with ascii charcters then flash's violently for 3 minutes , then returns to normal,. and i will get a new keyboard when i get Â£40,.,.;~)
