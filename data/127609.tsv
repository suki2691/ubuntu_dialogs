2007-07-26T14:39:00.000Z	dyrne	wib	ive not had an issue getting an atheros card up for a while. madwifi pretty much always works
2007-07-26T14:41:00.000Z	wib	dyrne	the restricted device manager lists it as enabled and in use (i /just/ installed ubuntu and dindt do anytrhing to it). still, wlan0 doesn't show up in iwconfig and i don't know what to do about ut
2007-07-26T14:46:00.000Z	wib	dyrne	the driver is installed and running, right?
