2009-10-26T16:08:00.000Z	Pici	tc1111	I don't see any builds of linux-restricted-modules for lpia.  I'd try asking in #ubuntu-kernel or logging a bug on the l-r-m package itself.
2009-10-26T16:10:00.000Z	tc1111	Pici	its pulled from ports.ubuntu.com
2009-10-26T16:12:00.000Z	Pici	tc1111	I still think the kernel team would be the best people to ask about it.
2009-10-26T16:16:00.000Z	tc1111	Pici	thank you... i'll head over there
