2009-09-16T12:28:00.000Z	avishek		I'm using Xubuntu 8.10. Is it possible to login through the GUI and then shutdown the GUI so that all work is in a pure command line environment?

2009-09-16T12:31:00.000Z	egomosis	avishek	welcome
2009-09-16T12:56:00.000Z	egomosis	avishek	had you already logged into the gui?
