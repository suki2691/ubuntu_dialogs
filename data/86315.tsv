2008-07-05T10:54:00.000Z	cvn`		hello Gnea.. i was trying to dual boot my system with ubuntu and windows. i started by installing ubuntu first, but after i install windows later, ubuntu doesnt seem to work. i think i'll try by installing windows first then ubuntu. so now i need a clean system to start on with. but how do i remove ubuntu off?
