2006-12-14T06:09:00.000Z	VSpike		I was thinking, since moving from Windows, I've often been less than impressed by the quality of application software available in Ubuntu (bought to mind as yet another app failed the first time I tried to use it).  One thing I love about Linux is the command line - the Bash shell and all the good stuff that goes with it (awk, sed, grep, etc.).  However, I could have all that stuff on Windows with Cygwin...
2006-12-14T06:09:00.000Z	VSpike		My question is, what is your killer app on ubuntu/Linux?  Which app do you find really indispensible?
2006-12-14T06:10:00.000Z	VSpike		my reason for asking is for my own education about what's available, so that I can check out some that I haven't heard off
