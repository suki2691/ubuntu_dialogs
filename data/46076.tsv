2009-10-10T23:40:00.000Z	Ledif-Nieht	alexander	Thanks for the tip, unfortunately I don't have a backup of my xorg.con (probably should have done that).
2009-10-10T23:41:00.000Z	alexander	Ledif-Nieht	really?  I didn't personally make a backup either.  I just went into /etc/X11/ and found a few made.
2009-10-10T23:42:00.000Z	Ledif-Nieht	alexander	Ok, I am in the recovery mode now (as root), I am going to browse to that directory and see what I can see..
