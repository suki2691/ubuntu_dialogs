2006-10-23T09:35:00.000Z	snoops		hey, umm I'm looking for an application which will map out my network graphically(and not go outside my network), and hopefully be able to tell me how far away(long) each cable on my network is.. there's a windows app I have for my switch which tells me cable lengths

2006-10-23T09:36:00.000Z	skel	snoops	I agree with sproingie
2006-10-23T09:38:00.000Z	skel	snoops	I think cheops will do that
