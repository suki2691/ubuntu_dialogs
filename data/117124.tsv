2007-12-15T02:58:00.000Z	Dandre		When I double-clic on a file in nutilus, I get this file opened in the corect application. I would like to have this behaviour in a shell for instance typing "start myfile.html"
2007-12-15T02:58:00.000Z	Dandre		How to do this?
2007-12-15T02:58:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Dandre	"nutlilus" lol I like that! :)
