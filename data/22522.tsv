2010-11-19T11:27:00.000Z	Zorlin		I'm having an issue with sound - any time multiple programs are using sound both will come out distorted and "slow"
2010-11-19T11:27:00.000Z	Zorlin		they'll be slowed down and sound mildly demonic :P
2010-11-19T11:28:00.000Z	MintBerryCrunch	Zorlin	I wish I had demonic sounds, haaha
