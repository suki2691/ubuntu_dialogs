2008-03-13T06:41:00.000Z	jared		can anyone help with an audio problem?
2008-03-13T06:43:00.000Z	jared		I have no audio at all.  The volume is at max yet no sound.
2008-03-13T06:45:00.000Z	jared		Yes, the mixers are up, and I have no external volume control on my laptop.  I just installed ubuntu yesterday. Any ideas would be very helpful.
