2007-02-03T15:39:00.000Z	sakari		I have a 20" Apple Cinema Display that I got working with some instructions, but the laptop screen is garbled because it tries to use the same resolution
2007-02-03T15:40:00.000Z	amorphous_	sakari	have you tried dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-02-03T15:41:00.000Z	sakari	amorphous_	yes .. but I'll try it again :) The problem is how can I disable the laptop screen while running only with the external monitor ?
