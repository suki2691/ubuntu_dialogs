2008-10-26T21:30:00.000Z	b33r	amrik	yes it works I have 64 and youtube works just fine
2008-10-26T21:30:00.000Z	amrik	b33r	well it works sometimes for me but not always. i feel capricorrrrrn has a similar issue to what i had
2008-10-26T21:31:00.000Z	b33r	amrik	I feel that he has installed some other free plugin first and that's what causing the problem
