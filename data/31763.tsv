Anyone know a good source that lays this out for me or is this something that takes years of user experience to learn?

2012-09-10T07:55:00.000Z	TJ-	daemongpl	But it's pretty simple: BIOS > HDD1(sector 0) > bootloader > kernel+initial-ramdisk > kernel > /init (process). What 'init' does depends on the distribution. On Ubuntu that's the "upstart" package. On Fedora/Red Hat it's "systemd"
