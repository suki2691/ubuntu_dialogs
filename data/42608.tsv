2010-05-26T20:22:00.000Z	magnus__		hey. I installed Ubuntu 10.04 just now and also the ATI catalyst linux driver (from ATI webpage). Now my X is running slow as fuck, even if the driver is in use (at least the control center seems to think so..). I have a "Evergreen"-based GPU,. Radeon HD5750 card
2010-05-26T20:22:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	magnus__	google how to toggle kms on and off see if it helps
2010-05-26T20:23:00.000Z	magnus__	aeon-ltd	will that affect my performance? i thought kms was just a way to not do multiple mode setting during boot
2010-05-26T20:24:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	magnus__	i know and KernelModeSetting is still quite buggy but its set to default and causes some problems for some cards
