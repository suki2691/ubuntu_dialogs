2011-10-24T15:03:00.000Z	lolmaus		I've got nginx customly installed into /opt. It keeps launching itself. Where the launch command may be? I wanna disable it without removing.
2011-10-24T15:04:00.000Z	reisio	lolmaus	/opt/ ? :/
2011-10-24T15:04:00.000Z	reisio	lolmaus	/etc/init.d/ probably
2011-10-24T15:06:00.000Z	lolmaus	reisio	i had removed the init.d script but it still keeps launching and taking over the 80 port
