2009-07-23T09:57:00.000Z	mazda01__	rojas	aptitude. that's my opinion.
2009-07-23T10:30:00.000Z	mazda01__	rojas	are you sharing a folder on windows? do you have simple file sharing on or not. is it winxp or what?
2009-07-23T10:32:00.000Z	mazda01__	rojas	if you don't know if you're sharing a folder in winxp then I don't know if I can help. have you goggled this? it's merely right clicking on a folder in windows explorer and going to sharing and security and telling it to share the folder and allowing everyone either read only access or write access or whatever you want.
