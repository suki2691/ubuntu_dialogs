2010-05-17T07:42:00.000Z	severnaya		Hello, can someone help me get yum working in ubuntu? I already did "apt-get install yum" but it doesn't see any packages.  Thanks :)

2010-05-17T07:43:00.000Z	severnaya	a94060	then why does it let me install yum? i can do yum --help fine, it just doesnt see any packages
