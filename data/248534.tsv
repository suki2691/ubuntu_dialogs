2006-08-04T16:13:00.000Z	minimec	queuetue	Well I have these wingeeks, who work with my system. They can not wait to unmount the stick ;)
2006-08-04T16:13:00.000Z	queuetue	minimec	Then they will just destroy it anyway.  Unmounting properly is important...
2006-08-04T16:15:00.000Z	minimec	queuetue	ompaul: Ok. THX I will tell them ;)
