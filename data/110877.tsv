2010-06-15T05:01:00.000Z	okapi14		anyone know how to access a folder with a long name and space (windws standard) from a terminal or console?
2010-06-15T05:02:00.000Z	h00k	okapi14	you can tab-complete to help you complete directories
2010-06-15T05:04:00.000Z	h00k	okapi14	type the first few letters of the foldername and hit 'tab'
