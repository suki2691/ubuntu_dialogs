2008-05-30T00:37:00.000Z	JonathanEllis		Is there a way to export my sources and then import them after installation of a newer ubuntu?
2008-05-30T00:37:00.000Z	joaopinto	JonathanEllis	, which sources ?
2008-05-30T00:37:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	joaopinto	Sorry, should have been more specific. Software sources that apt uses
2008-05-30T00:38:00.000Z	joaopinto	JonathanEllis	if you are doing a distro upgrade, the sources are going to change, you should not use the older sources
