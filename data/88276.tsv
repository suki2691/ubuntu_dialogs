2008-06-10T16:12:00.000Z	TuniX12	whileimhere	what do u mean by optimize ubuntu and GNOME?
2008-06-10T16:13:00.000Z	whileimhere	TuniX12	I am sure that there are ways to get it to both boot and run faster and smoother. I have done the very basics like turning off the Apache Server and services and such but I was thinking that there had to be more hacks and tweaks.
2008-06-10T16:14:00.000Z	TuniX12	whileimhere	try Ubuntu Tweak http://ubuntu-tweak.com and goole for preload and preftech
