2011-07-12T03:08:00.000Z	molossus	Dr_Willis	, i use a laptop cooler but even with that , i get 43C on this laptop, but only when it runs any linux distro, that doesnt happen with windows
2011-07-12T03:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	molossus	 the laptop makers have speciual drivers for windows that can cut things down to save even more power. My Toshiba X505 has some 'eco-mode' that saves a lot of power.. but it slows the laptop down so much.. its almost unuseable..
