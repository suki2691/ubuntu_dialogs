2011-04-28T23:39:00.000Z	srsbiz		Hey, is 11.04 released yet? update-notifier doesn't report 11.04 is available, only 10.10. :-/
2011-04-28T23:40:00.000Z	srsbiz		Do I have to update to 10.10 frist?
2011-04-28T23:40:00.000Z	Pici	srsbiz	Yes. If you're running 10.04, you'll need to upgrade to 10.10 first, then to 11.04
2011-04-28T23:41:00.000Z	srsbiz	Pici	is 11.04 LTS btw? I was kind-of confused by teh lack of "LTS" on the download site
