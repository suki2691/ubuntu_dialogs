2005-11-03T08:00:00.000Z	moquist	odat	http://ubuntuguide.org/ has info that's still helpful to change default applications
2005-11-03T08:01:00.000Z	moquist	odat	it boils down to editing this file: /usr/share/applications/defaults.list
2005-11-03T08:01:00.000Z	moquist	odat	there may be a "better" way to do it, but I don't know what it is.
