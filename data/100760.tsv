2008-03-05T20:20:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	hwilde_	I think your problem is not your machine.. but your router..(forwarding your request)
2008-03-05T20:21:00.000Z	rhineheart_m	hwilde_	I bet.. the better alternative.. change the port number for ssh in your machine2 so that your router will know where to forward your request
2008-03-05T20:21:00.000Z	hwilde_	rhineheart_m	yeah that is the problem it's the customer's router so I don't have access :/     I don't have unlimited ports either bc it's not my network.
