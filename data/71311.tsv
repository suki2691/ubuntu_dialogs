2008-12-15T02:05:00.000Z	REdian		Anyone have any ideas why I can see a partition in GParted but then can't find it in "Computer"?
2008-12-15T02:05:00.000Z	riz0n	REdian	try going to /media/ and see if it shows up there
2008-12-15T02:06:00.000Z	REdian	riz0n	not there either :(
2008-12-15T02:06:00.000Z	riz0n	REdian	more than likely the NTFS partition has been marked for improper shutdown...
