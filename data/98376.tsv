2008-04-25T16:55:00.000Z	Glas`Awyr		I'm going to have one more poke at this. If I can't get xChat running on my machine there is no hope for me.
2008-04-25T16:57:00.000Z	Glas`Awyr		I am in the Add/Remove Applications window. I can see xChat. I click it, and it tells me "The list of applications is not available"
