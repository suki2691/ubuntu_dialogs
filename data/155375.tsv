2009-05-05T20:51:00.000Z	eternal_p	Dr_Willis	that is what I am using
2009-05-05T20:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	eternal_p	 ive gotten it working to read my thumbdrive in the past.. but it was a pain. had to tweak with the vbox settings then i started it up. then i recall twiddling with teh vbox client menus
