2007-10-29T05:17:00.000Z	Skif		After upgrading to gutsy, all my windows start at (0,0), which means the window titles are hidden by the top panel, so I can't move them.  What's causing this, and how can I fix it?
2007-10-29T05:17:00.000Z	Skif		Well, I *can* move them by alt-space, and hitting "m", but it's annoying to have to.

2007-10-29T05:18:00.000Z	Skif	Evanlec	right, but I want to stop this happening in the future.
