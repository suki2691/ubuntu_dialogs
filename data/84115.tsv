2008-07-30T19:12:00.000Z	thomasrinsma	geirha	thanks, but i'd really like to do it without virtualization (i have a 32bit pc if no other way)
2008-07-30T19:14:00.000Z	geirha	thomasrinsma	ok, how about installing 32bit ubuntu on a seperate partition, but don't boot into it, just mount it in 64bit ubuntu and chroot into the 32bit?
2008-07-30T19:16:00.000Z	thomasrinsma	geirha	would be possible but still it's much of a too big step for me, I think I'll just add this source on my 32bit ubuntu desktop :), thanks though :)
