2011-02-22T23:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Linda_91	 some chipsets just have flakey support. You have checked the forums for that exact chipset?
2011-02-22T23:57:00.000Z	Linda_91	Dr_Willis	Yes I checked for it.. I was adviced to use ndiswrapper.. now it does show in interfaces but I can not get it to work.. I am new to ubuntu so it might be something easy I am missing...
