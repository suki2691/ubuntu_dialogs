2011-05-30T00:30:00.000Z	Saalko2		Okay now two problems. ^^ the standard IRC Chat programm empaty isn't working. It works for ICQ, but it has big problems (on my netbook with IRC Servers.) Did anybody know a good alternative? (IRC+ICQ programm +Skype would be perfekt, but didn't think that any messanger works with Skype.) Secound the rarcrack programm (I know sudokill answered it already but yeah problems with IRC sry.

2011-05-30T00:35:00.000Z	JPP	Saalko2	try "./rarcrack"
2011-05-30T00:40:00.000Z	JPP	Saalko2	the idea of encryption is for it to be virtually unbreakable.
