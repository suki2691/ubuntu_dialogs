2012-05-01T05:33:00.000Z	PhlowHome		My laptop screen goes blank when I close the lid and reopen, any known fix?
2012-05-01T05:33:00.000Z	systemd0wn	PhlowHome	same here. Haven't seen any fix.
2012-05-01T05:34:00.000Z	systemd0wn	PhlowHome	Have you tried messing with power settings? Tell ubuntu not to do anything when you close the lid. This may help.
2012-05-01T05:34:00.000Z	PhlowHome	systemd0wn	I'll do that until I find a fix
