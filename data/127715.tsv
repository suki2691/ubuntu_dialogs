2007-07-22T11:23:00.000Z	tehtechman	hammedhaaret	apt-get remove if you used the pack manager
2007-07-22T11:24:00.000Z	hammedhaaret	triden1	& tehtechman: uuuhmm.... didn't use the manager. think i did it with a .bin file or somethin
2007-07-22T11:25:00.000Z	tehtechman	hammedhaaret	did it ask u for a root pw?
