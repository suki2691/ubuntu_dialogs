2009-09-15T17:20:00.000Z	KendrickSF		I'm trying to install Ubuntu on the unallocated space of my hard drive that has a primary partition with Windows 7 on it and some unallocated space...I've tried it twice with the default "choose between Ubuntu and your other OS," however the Windows 7 boot manager still runs and grub doesn't seem to superscede it. Suggestions?
