2011-10-12T17:14:00.000Z	libScout_		i would like to setup an intranet behind my gateway NAT... if I lock down port 80, will outgoing requests still reach there destination?
2011-10-12T17:15:00.000Z	flummy	libScout_	what do you mean by "set up an interanet", another NAT router?

2011-10-12T17:16:00.000Z	libScout_	flummy	basically I have a couple of PHP scripts for simplifying tasks for a couple "non-techs" for a headless server and i want everyone behind the gateway NAT to see port 80 but no one outside the NAT can access the web server
