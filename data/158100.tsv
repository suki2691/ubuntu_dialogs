2012-01-25T13:43:00.000Z	Bry8Star		Hi, what would you recommend as a Firewall for an Ubuntu used on desktop/workstation/laptop?
2012-01-25T13:44:00.000Z	Bry8Star		Is there Firewall that can give out instant popup of any new traffic and wait for its user's response, and also checks which app has initiated that traffic, shows ip, port, host, reverse-address, etc in that popup
2012-01-25T13:45:00.000Z	Bry8Star		... I see, thanks rhin0
