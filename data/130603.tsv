2007-08-02T05:23:00.000Z	alecwh		I want to start automatically backing up some of my files... What program do you suggest?
2007-08-02T05:25:00.000Z	keito	alecwh	there's a pakcage fro doing so in the automatix program, though its not recommended for use by most on here as apparently automatix can break systems (i've had no trouble)
2007-08-02T05:25:00.000Z	alecwh	keito	what's the program name, can you check?
2007-08-02T05:25:00.000Z	keito	alecwh	it comes up as "simple backup"
