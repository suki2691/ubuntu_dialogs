2005-02-27T15:37:00.000Z	TraceyTux		Thanks for the help with my 1st question, here's another! Last week I bought a Belkin Hi-Speed Usb 2.0 7-port Hub (the one with the top loading feature).  The packaging and documentation only mention Windows and Mac OS, so will it work with Ubuntu, as I've heard the distro has the full Project Utopia, so should support USB?!!!!!
