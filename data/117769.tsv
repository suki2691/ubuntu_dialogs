2008-02-09T23:11:00.000Z	RB2		When I right-click on an html file on my local fs and choose Firefox from the application selection box, it just sits and waits and never opens ff. Any suggestions?
2008-02-09T23:11:00.000Z	Slart	RB2	what happens if you run firefox yourhtmlfilenamehere ?
2008-02-09T23:11:00.000Z	RB2	Slart	I'll try it that way. The strange thing is that if I double-click on the html file, it opens it in ff. :-/
2008-02-09T23:12:00.000Z	Slart	RB2	very strange
