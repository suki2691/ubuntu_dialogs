2006-06-18T05:08:00.000Z	ompaul	caHEk	please check the message from ubotu - it tells you in detail we could not do in irc how to install and configure nvidia
2006-06-18T05:10:00.000Z	ompaul	caHEk	I strongly suggest you get dapper drake 6.06 that is so different to the current distribution and it is not supported as and from October this year, on the other hand 6.06 is supported for the next three years on the desktop
