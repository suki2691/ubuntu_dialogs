2008-11-21T09:22:00.000Z	akahig2		has anyone noticed the firefox 3.0.4 upgrade consuming a lot more resources than the previous version?  just sitting idle, it seems to be pushing my cpu usage up over 60%

2008-11-21T09:23:00.000Z	akahig2	nickrud	no flash open.  and I killed npviewer.bin just to make sure that wasn't the culprit
