2009-03-05T07:57:00.000Z	niceguy1309		hello, i must of goofed up my fresh install while using aptitude. when i launch aptitude it states "unable to resolve dependencies", and it wants to uninstall almost every package. DL 21GB???
2009-03-05T07:59:00.000Z	niceguy1309		it says I have 738 broken packages, but I just installed 8.10, and used aptitude to update the pc
