2010-09-08T13:23:00.000Z	DIFTOW		Hey, I have a quick question. I have 8 GB of system ram. How much HDD partition space for Swap drive?
2010-09-08T13:24:00.000Z	Slart	DIFTOW	is this a laptop? will you be using hibernation?
2010-09-08T13:24:00.000Z	Slart	DIFTOW	then at least 8 GB.. ie the same as the internal memory
2010-09-08T13:25:00.000Z	Slart	DIFTOW	not sure.. I would go with a little extra.. 10 GB or so
