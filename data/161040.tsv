2007-09-08T15:47:00.000Z	Yendor		my wireless network card is suddenly showing eth0 "no wireless extensions." when I attempt iwconfig... Why have I lost my wireless connection..what is wrong :S
2007-09-08T15:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Yendor	Wireless cards are hardly ever labeled eth0, are you sure it isn't eth1 or something else?
2007-09-08T15:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Yendor	I assume you are getting this info by running "iwconfig" ?
2007-09-09T16:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Yendor	Is it enabled in System -> Administration -> Restricted Driver Manager ?
