2006-08-04T11:06:00.000Z	minerale		Hi, could someone help me understand this, After running the latest updateds, the "GRUB" list was messed up, I now have two entries for ubuntu, two for ubuntu recovery, one for memtest, and the grub entry for Windows Xp is gone

2006-08-04T11:08:00.000Z	minerale	sovi3t	I'm doing that, but I'd like to know why that happened
2006-08-04T11:09:00.000Z	sovi3t	minerale	no clue ;)
