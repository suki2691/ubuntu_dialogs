2010-05-01T14:54:00.000Z	ben_		Does anyone here know how to clear or disable the "Recent Files" section of the home screen on Ubuntu 10.04 Netbook Edition ? I can't find an option for it anywhere and there's no context menu for that section either.

2010-05-01T15:04:00.000Z	ben_	fr0nk	Thanks, I've got it disabled now.
