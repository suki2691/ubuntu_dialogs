2006-07-08T11:17:00.000Z	MTecknology		I'm using Ubuntu 6.06, when I use copy or cut, I can paste until I close the program I took it from. Once I close that program I can't paste, how can I change that?

2006-07-08T11:18:00.000Z	MTecknology	gatekeeper	is there anything I can do?
2006-07-08T11:19:00.000Z	gatekeeper	MTecknology	not that I am aware of other than keeping the app open untill you have pasted, not really researched it but have heard comments about this elsewhere
