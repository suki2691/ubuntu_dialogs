2005-03-28T16:56:00.000Z	Faithful		I am starting out... should I get hoary or warty?
2005-03-28T16:57:00.000Z	Faithful		so hoary is just about there?
2005-03-28T16:57:00.000Z	Faithful		It will be upgradeable I gather
2005-03-28T16:58:00.000Z	queuetue	Faithful	I've been running hoary for weekjs, and *zero* complaints.
