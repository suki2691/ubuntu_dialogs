2005-10-20T08:55:00.000Z	TaxMan		I want to install Ubuntu on an old machine. Which will perform better Ubuntu (Gnome) or Kubuntu?
2005-10-20T08:55:00.000Z	antgel_	TaxMan	they'll both suck (allegedly) :)
2005-10-20T08:56:00.000Z	TaxMan	antgel_	how do you mean?
2005-10-20T08:56:00.000Z	antgel_	TaxMan	i mean both gnome and kde use crazy amounts of system resources and this will be most noticable on an old box
