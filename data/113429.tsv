2008-01-08T09:58:00.000Z	musikgoat	nephlim	edit -> preferences -> content -> file types
2008-01-08T10:00:00.000Z	nephlim	musikgoat	I tried the file types, and there's nothing there that lists mms type. in any event, everything is set to xmms anyway, and still no dice.
2008-01-08T10:00:00.000Z	musikgoat	nephlim	see if nomasteryoda's suggestion pan's out then?
