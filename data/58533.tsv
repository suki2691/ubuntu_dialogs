2012-06-24T01:34:00.000Z	Darael	nd456	Before building it yourself (whatever "it" is; not been paying enough attention) have you checked if there's a PPA for it?
2012-06-24T01:37:00.000Z	Darael	nd456	I've not been able to get GetDeb to work for quite some time.  I keep getting 403 Forbiddens on the repo.  Not sure, sorry, just thought I'd check if you'd tried for PPAs.
2012-06-24T01:39:00.000Z	Darael	nd456	Neither.  It just updates the available-packages information.  You need to follow it with a "sudo apt-get upgrade" to actually install the updates.
