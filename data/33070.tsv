2010-04-30T03:58:00.000Z	davidthedrake		Hello. I'm working with a new Ubuntu installation and I've run into a weird problem that is giving me troubles. I'm just trying to run a file that is in the current directory I'm in. To do so, I'm entering ./filename. When I do, I get a "-bash: ./filename: No such file or directory". What am I missing here?
2010-04-30T03:58:00.000Z	darkkilla	davidthedrake	What kind of file is it?
2010-04-30T03:59:00.000Z	davidthedrake	darkkilla	How can I tell what type of file it is?
2010-04-30T03:59:00.000Z	davidthedrake	darkkilla	it has no extension and nothing at the top of the file.
