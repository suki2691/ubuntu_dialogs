2008-03-05T21:16:00.000Z	bazhang	thechef	we can only say ubuntu here ;]
2008-03-05T21:19:00.000Z	thechef	bazhang	Okay. Can you also give a reason? Is there a setup included? I know iptables, but I hate to configure it on such a low level, because I could easily forget something.
2008-03-05T21:20:00.000Z	bazhang	thechef	just kidding ;] debian is fine as well and there is a setup for ubuntu-server
