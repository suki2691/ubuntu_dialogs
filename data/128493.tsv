2007-07-09T08:47:00.000Z	AncientP1		hey guys, I can't resize the root partition when booting off the LiveCD and using gparted despite the fact that the free space is adjacent to the root partition and the file systems are unmounted (gparted screenshot: http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=37669&d=1183946842)
2007-07-09T08:47:00.000Z	iammisc	AncientP1	which version?
2007-07-09T08:48:00.000Z	AncientP1	iammisc	I'm using the v7.04 LiveCD and the gparted on that CD
2007-07-09T08:49:00.000Z	iammisc	AncientP1	oh. Uhmm. i dont know about Feisty, but maybe you should use the official gparted livecd
