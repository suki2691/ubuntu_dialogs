2009-12-02T16:03:00.000Z	yarri		Hej! I have a question - and I am a Newbie with IRC, so bear with me.
2009-12-02T16:04:00.000Z	yarri		I broke yesterday a wireless router - old and crappy Linksys that enabled me to connect both using a cable and a wireless. I know squat about routers.
2009-12-02T16:05:00.000Z	yarri		I was wondering if you could recomend something that will work with ubuntu and won't cost too much - say up to 50$
