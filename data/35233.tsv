I am using the nvidia-current driver but my pc is really acting weird. very often when a menu is opend, or a screen resized or the like, ubuntu freezes for like 20 and often both connected monitors show a black screen for a millisec or something
2010-09-07T20:26:00.000Z	SmokeyD		any ideas what can cause this?
2010-09-07T20:26:00.000Z	Oer	SmokeyD	do you have compiz enabled ?
