2011-11-18T08:06:00.000Z	MestreLion	as	sure you can... Ubuntu is as a FREE OS... "free" meaning you have the FREEDOM to use it for whatever you want
2011-11-18T08:06:00.000Z	as	MestreLion	Thank you
2011-11-18T08:07:00.000Z	MestreLion	as	Ubuntu (and Linux in general) is "free" as in freedom, not (only) as in free beer
