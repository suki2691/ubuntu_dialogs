2008-01-15T21:38:00.000Z	juannicolas		Hello, I have a PIII dual processor server with 2G ram, should I install the SMP kernel for ubuntu 6.06 LTS?

2008-01-15T21:40:00.000Z	juannicolas	MasterShrek	thank you, another question, right now i had to edit the startup for it in order to make ubuntu to boot I added 'noapic' command, how can i make the dual processor work or find out if is already working?
