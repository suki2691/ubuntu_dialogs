2010-06-03T16:29:00.000Z	dum		i want to do an upgrade from 9.10 to 10.04 but my update manager does not show that 'New Ubuntu release '10.04 TLS' is available
2010-06-03T16:30:00.000Z	drizzt_	dum	had you provided -d option?
2010-06-03T17:01:00.000Z	drizzt_	dum	try to change your mirror
2010-06-03T17:02:00.000Z	dum	drizzt_	 don't know why that will be a problem, cos i have two machines running 9.10.. the one machine does display option to upgrade but this one doesn't
