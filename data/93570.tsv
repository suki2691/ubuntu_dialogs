2008-07-07T10:44:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		i'm planning on doing an upgrade to 8.04 from 7.10. i have several KDE apps installed (ktorrent k3b etc..) plus avant window navigator.. i know avant is now a package installed by default in 8.04. should i remove them before upgrading? kde apps are 3.5 .. will 8.04 be adding kde 4.0 apps? should i remove the current kde apps and reinstall after the upgrade?
