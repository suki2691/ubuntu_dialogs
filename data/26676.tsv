2010-10-26T09:31:00.000Z	MK13		I am trying to run a command from ssh... how can I make it so that it runs in the background so i can still use the ssh, but also that it keeps running after I close the connection?
2010-10-26T09:32:00.000Z	Maahes_	MK13	tmux or screen
2010-10-26T09:32:00.000Z	Maahes_	MK13	I recommend tmux, its better than screen
