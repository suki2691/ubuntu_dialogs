2009-07-16T21:23:00.000Z	nem		Hi. Anyone know why when i click "Suspend", my computer goes down and back up again without staying suspended? Is this a known problem? (not talking about blackscreen after suspend) (checked bios settings and its set to S1 and S3)(9.04, nvidia gfx drivers)
2009-07-16T21:23:00.000Z	nem		also tried installing uswsusp and running s2ram --force without any luck
2009-07-16T21:24:00.000Z	nem		no idea. its a clean install on a 320gb drive
2009-07-16T21:24:00.000Z	mzz	nem	"free -m" will tell
