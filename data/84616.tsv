2012-07-04T04:40:00.000Z	urgodfather		hello can someone help me figure out why i cannot live boot on this device http://www.cartft.com/catalog/il/770 when it boots, the graphics scan... kinda like when you record a crt on video but way faster where you cannot see anything
2012-07-04T04:42:00.000Z	urgodfather		anyone?
2012-07-04T04:44:00.000Z	urgodfather		could it be a kernel thing? personally, i think its a graphics thing... is there any way to reduce down the graphics to 800 x 480?
