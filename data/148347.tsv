2007-05-24T08:41:00.000Z	please_help		Hey, how is it going? I have feisty installed and xgl, compiz running on my system. Now my question is how can I run several programs at startup on different workspaces? Is is possible to write a small script in a easy way like that: $ <name_of_program> <option_telling_the_prog_to_start_on_workspace4> ? THX for your effort in advance.
