2007-06-08T11:14:00.000Z	ticky	erUSUL	will it work it's is run from the crontab (by this i mean, that not shell is initialized by me)
2007-06-08T11:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	ticky	no, i do not think so. And i think that running binaries from users home with cron is not a very good idea...
2007-06-08T11:15:00.000Z	ticky	erUSUL	why is that?
