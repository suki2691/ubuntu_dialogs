2011-08-11T21:03:00.000Z	Dulak	trism	sweet, what file gets the logs that used to go there?
2011-08-11T21:04:00.000Z	trism		nearly everything that would have been in /var/log/messages should be in either /var/log/kern.log or /var/log/syslog (I don't know if anything is missing, although syslog is *.* so it should catch everything else now)
