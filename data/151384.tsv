2007-01-08T08:41:00.000Z	aN1	JackBandit69	 partition magic can handle ext3 and swaP?
2007-01-08T08:45:00.000Z	JackBandit69	aN1	from my experance, yes. I have used it before to resize linux and windows partitions... one thing you can do is get and install it on your windows partition, run it and do the resizing there, apply it all and reboot and alll that mess, then enjoy
2007-01-08T08:49:00.000Z	JackBandit69	aN1	I havent tried gparted and the other partition tools before, I have only really used fdisk and partition magic, I personaly really like partition magic. But if you have good workings w/ gparted or something else, let me know I would like to try out some other free tools, but am a little scared since I am not a fan of data-loss
