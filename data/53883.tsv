This has been bugging me all day... why didnt' they include compiz-setup (perhaps instead as advanced desktop settings) in 9.04?  I didn't even *know* all the coolness that the windowmanager can do until i stumbled across a youtube video showing off all the things it can do

2009-06-26T13:00:00.000Z	Aacron	kindofabuzz	 but... why?  I mean hell this stuff is friggin sweet lookin eye candy
2009-06-26T13:00:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Aacron	you have to look at what Ubuntu is mainly targeted to. Linux novices
