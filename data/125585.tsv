2007-08-08T11:40:00.000Z	CheeseGardener		Could someone help me with making a hard drive a primary master drive????
2007-08-08T11:41:00.000Z	Nattgew	CheeseGardener	do you mean hardware-wise?
2007-08-08T11:54:00.000Z	Nattgew	CheeseGardener	like I said, there are probably two IDE cables attached to the mb... one is primary, one is secondary
2007-08-08T12:40:00.000Z	Nattgew	CheeseGardener	is there a way you could use just one jumper?
