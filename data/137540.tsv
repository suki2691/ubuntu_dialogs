2007-04-21T16:14:00.000Z	bgrupe	Vinitious	sudo is a tool, not a user
2007-04-21T16:15:00.000Z	Vinitious	bgrupe	I just need to install something on Ubuntu 7, which user can I use for that?
2007-04-21T16:15:00.000Z	bgrupe	Vinitious	just type "sudo <command>" where <command> is what you would normally do
