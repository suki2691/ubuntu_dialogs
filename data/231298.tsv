2007-06-07T10:50:00.000Z	ferret_0567		I'm not using Ubuntu on one of my computers, I'm using Linux from Scratch, and Compiz 0.5.0's KDE window decorator does not like my DBus version (same as Ubuntu 7.04's), I need some help with the KDE window decorator code or a patch
2007-06-07T10:51:00.000Z	keith	ferret_0567	then you're in the wrong channel ;-)
