2007-04-14T15:06:00.000Z	T1		Very strange problem  -- I installed Twinkle (VOIP sip client), which launches fine in my (admin rights) profile, but not in another (user) profile. dies with "Floating point exception" error. I cannot find a permissions issue, and strace wasn't useful.  Any suggestions on how to run it as the user?
2007-04-14T15:07:00.000Z	T1		Anyone have any suggestions?
2007-04-14T15:08:00.000Z	T1		Nobody wants/is-able to tackle the decently complex problem I have? :-P
