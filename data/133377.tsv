2007-05-26T14:38:00.000Z	rasczak		Anyone have any ideas what could have caused my sound to suddenly stop working?  Yesterday was working, went to lunch, came back and no sound for any programs.  The speakers work, and I checked the volume is up and not muted

2007-05-26T14:39:00.000Z	rasczak	erdinger	how do I bring that up?
