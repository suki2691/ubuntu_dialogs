2011-06-21T21:36:00.000Z	Smee		I have a dual-booting question. When I attempt to dual boot win7/ubuntu, I can only get grub to work if I don't create a swap partition. Does that make sense?
2011-06-21T21:37:00.000Z	wols	Smee	no it doesn't make sense
2011-06-21T21:38:00.000Z	wols	Smee	no. grub doesn't care about swap, at all
2011-06-21T21:39:00.000Z	wols	Smee	grub works fine with extended partitions too btw
