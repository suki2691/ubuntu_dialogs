2008-05-16T11:21:00.000Z	rodolfo_		noob question: HOW do i minimize evolution to the systray?
2008-05-16T11:22:00.000Z	White^Knight	rodolfo_	i don't think that's possible
2008-05-16T11:23:00.000Z	rodolfo_	Myrtti	Opethian: and is there any debapp that can do that?
2008-05-16T11:23:00.000Z	White^Knight	rodolfo_	i use evolution also, but i just keep it minimized in my taskbar
