2009-01-14T09:08:00.000Z	dal_work		hi all, a friend of mine recently installed ubuntu 8.10 via the wubi installer, and has since ran out of disk space on the root partition leading to all kinds of nastiness. He wants to shift some free space from other partitions on that drive to the ubuntu root partition and my first thought was to fire up a live cd and use gparted to resize his partitions but wubi appears to have done something strange and I can't see the ubuntu partition
