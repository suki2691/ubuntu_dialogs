2007-03-11T07:25:00.000Z	DrDogwelder	Craeo	you need to get the alternate install disc.
2007-03-11T07:28:00.000Z	DrDogwelder	Craeo	not really.  It'll just be in a text screen instead of a desktop and you'll have more options.
2007-03-11T07:31:00.000Z	DrDogwelder	Craeo	once it's done installing, it'll boot to a GUI.  You won't need to know any commands to get it installed.
