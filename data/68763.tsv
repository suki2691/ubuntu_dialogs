2009-08-20T20:04:00.000Z	Damaki		Hello, I'm new to Ubuntu and I'm having some problems with my network. I've looked for solutions on the internet but they tell me to go to "System -> Administration -> Networking". But the "Networking" option isn't there in the "Administration" menu. How do I enable it?
