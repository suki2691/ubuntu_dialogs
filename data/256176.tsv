2012-08-31T00:22:00.000Z	jklowden		Let me ask the question a different way.  I see "http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise universe" in sources.list.  I also find on that server an x11 directory: us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu/pool/universe/x/x11-apps/.  Is that what apt-get is looking for?  Do I need to adjust my sources.list for that location?
