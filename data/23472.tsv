2010-10-27T00:50:00.000Z	johnbyrne	hacked_kernel	What kind of touchpad do you have?
2010-10-27T00:51:00.000Z	hacked_kernel	johnbyrne	i have Dell Inspiron 1525
2010-10-27T00:52:00.000Z	johnbyrne	hacked_kernel	I just googled it and I think you might be in luck. Synaptics touchpads do have multi-touch support, or so it seems. I have a Dell Inspiron 1501 and it has a Synaptic.
