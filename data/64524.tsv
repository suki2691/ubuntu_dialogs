2009-03-03T11:50:00.000Z	Seper	Starcraftmazter	Channels 11+ are illegal in some countries. That might have something to do with it. i dunno
2009-03-03T11:51:00.000Z	Starcraftmazter	Seper	is there any way to change this behaviour?
2009-03-03T11:51:00.000Z	Seper	Starcraftmazter	I'm not sure. I can only recommend you to google
