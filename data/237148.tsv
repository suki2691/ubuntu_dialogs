2005-05-18T15:45:00.000Z	todd_		i just installed hoary and most things are gravy. Went all through the ubuntuguide.org page and got stuff installed and happy. For some reason though, I can't seem to install extensions for firefox....when I click on the install link, it asks me to save it to disk, as though it doesn't even recognize the file type....what gives?
