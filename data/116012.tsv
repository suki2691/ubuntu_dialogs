2008-01-20T13:51:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	cn28h	Depends... what is your planned setup? Dual booting? Do you install often? Do you want to backup your system, do you want to encrypt it?
2008-01-20T13:51:00.000Z	cn28h	ArthurArchnix	nothing out of the ordinary, and I use an external drive for backups
2008-01-20T13:54:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	cn28h	Then I would do this: 5GB set as root /, 1GB as swap, the rest as home /home.
