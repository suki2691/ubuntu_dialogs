2007-03-18T07:55:00.000Z	tbuss		thinking of installing ubuntu on a second internal hdd. i have found this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot I want to keep my existing windoze partitions intact. if i understand correctly, once i load the disk ubuntu should recognize my windoze partitions and I can select which hdd i want to install ubuntu?
