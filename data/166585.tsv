2006-09-26T11:48:00.000Z	DutchR_PW		does anybody know a way to send keyboard events in python? I've written a lightweight driver for my soundcard remote and now I need a way to emulate keypresses.
2006-09-26T11:49:00.000Z	DutchR_PW		thanks
2006-09-26T11:49:00.000Z	DutchR_PW		then I have another question: If I finish this driver, how can I propose it for Ubuntu inclusion?
