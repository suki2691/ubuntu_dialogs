2012-09-26T15:48:00.000Z	mac_nibblet	ActionParsnip	im sorry, but have you ever tried to setup gentoo?
2012-09-26T15:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mac_nibblet	yes but it will always take that lon. I have installed gentoo before
2012-09-26T15:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mac_nibblet	install a new release of Ubuntu and the updates will be fewer, taking less time to get the latest packages, that's my point
