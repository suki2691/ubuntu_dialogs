2010-09-04T22:32:00.000Z	Kruptein		Hey I have a dual boot windows 7 -- ubuntu Lucid,  no I want to run windows7 from within ubuntu like virtualbox or something,  how should I do this?
2010-09-04T22:33:00.000Z	TeaRex	Kruptein	Install VBox, then reinstall Windows inside of it
2010-09-04T22:35:00.000Z	Kruptein	TeaRex	I don't want to reinstall it though, I need the already installed programs in windows and don't want to reinstall them all
2010-09-04T22:43:00.000Z	TeaRex	Kruptein	True, that's why I keep a large "storage" partition in NTFS to access from both sides
