2007-07-15T13:07:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude		why did my X-Chat system tray icon suddenly appear floating in the upper-left corner of my screen, in a little box?

2007-07-15T13:10:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	PurpZeY	nope. sometimes out of nowhere one of the items in my system tray appears somewhere else in a little box that i can minimize, maximize, and close
2007-07-15T13:10:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Newbie_Dude	Well, I've had that happen, I always thought it was b/c of beryl, but what I do is, force-quit that box...then remove my panel notification app and re-add it...and restart nm-applet
