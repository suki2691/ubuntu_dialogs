2011-05-22T22:16:00.000Z	alextybob		testdisk has given me the memory address of a partition i want to add and i want to know how to add that partition
2011-05-22T22:16:00.000Z	LjL	alextybob	i think testdisk can add it itself... or gpart can
2011-05-22T22:17:00.000Z	LjL	alextybob	but otherwise you can use fdisk
