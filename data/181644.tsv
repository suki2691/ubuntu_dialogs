2006-07-12T09:47:00.000Z	anathema		I'm tryin to install dapper on a server..but in dapper its some weird gnome install..no way to select server install?
2006-07-12T09:47:00.000Z	anathema		and the parition editor is gnome based too, you used to be able to set up dm raid and install to that, is this also no longer possible ?
2006-07-12T09:48:00.000Z	Kaja	anathema	try server install cd? or alternate install cd?
