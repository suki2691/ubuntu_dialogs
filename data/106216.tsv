2008-01-12T02:01:00.000Z	wsgued1	rinaldi_	how much mem do you have on the pc?
2008-01-12T02:02:00.000Z	wsgued1	rinaldi_	just give it some time... I had a problem with my 7.10 live cd, so I made a 7.04 and installed through that
2008-01-12T02:03:00.000Z	wsgued1	rinaldi_	then through the updates you can upgrade to 7.10
