2010-04-17T15:55:00.000Z	Sk_Lg		>< so I have been partitioning my machine to dual boot, but now ubuntu can't load because of gurb rescue, but windows isn't recognizing any of my drives to install on
2010-04-17T15:56:00.000Z	Sk_Lg		I have command prompt, and now I am wondering how to install both on the machine
2010-04-17T15:56:00.000Z	[Screamo]	Sk_Lg	Sounds like you should wipe it and start over
2010-04-17T15:57:00.000Z	[Screamo]	Sk_Lg	lol, you shouldnt be asking me
