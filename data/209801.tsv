2006-03-10T09:40:00.000Z	deus		what does ubuntu provide for tinkering with xorg.conf? im talking about an automatic .conf setup
2006-03-10T09:40:00.000Z	LjL	deus	"sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg". not sure that's what you mean by automated
2006-03-10T09:47:00.000Z	deus	LjL	what i really want todo is to configure my tv-out
2006-03-10T09:48:00.000Z	LjL	deus	uh, dunno really. i *have* got a card with tv-out, but i just bought it 3 days ago =) haven't really tried it yet
