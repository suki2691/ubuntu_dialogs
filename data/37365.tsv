2010-02-15T23:45:00.000Z	spenser		Hi, I'm trying to create a C app that will put data into a postgres database however I'm having a hard time determining how to setup autotools such that I use the shared library.  From what I can tell I cannot use pkgconfig to do this just yet.
2010-02-15T23:46:00.000Z	spenser		Is there a better forum for my previous question about c programming?
