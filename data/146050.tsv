2008-12-13T06:25:00.000Z	donavan_		I just installed virtualbox from the closed source binaries and everything seemed to install correctly but now I am getting the following error "Could not load the Host USB Proxy Service (VERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND)"  I thought the closed source was supposed to support USB any one have any  ideas on this one?
