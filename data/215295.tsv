2008-06-16T21:21:00.000Z	DarkAudit		I have aterm installed and set as the preferred terminal, but the change won't take
2008-06-16T21:22:00.000Z	DarkAudit		I go to accessories>terminal, and the regular terminal shows up instead
2008-06-16T21:24:00.000Z	DarkAudit		crap... if there's an answer, I'll have to get it later... storm coming... bye
