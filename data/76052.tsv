2010-07-31T07:31:00.000Z	jjgalvez__		for an external drive should I format it as ext2 or ext4? is there any advantage to using ext4 on an external drive?
2010-07-31T07:32:00.000Z	furythor	jjgalvez__	any reason why not ext3 ?
2010-07-31T07:33:00.000Z	jjgalvez__	furythor	no reason, just when I clicked on the drive and selected format I got ext2 and ext4 as options
2010-07-31T07:33:00.000Z	furythor	jjgalvez__	 that goes interesting, that ext3 is not among options...
