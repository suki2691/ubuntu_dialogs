2006-12-04T14:26:00.000Z	OdiiN		how can i block the installation of a certain package with aptitude or apt-get ?
2006-12-04T14:26:00.000Z	LjL	OdiiN	if that package is required by another package that you need to install, you don't do that
2006-12-04T14:28:00.000Z	LjL	OdiiN	then don't install ubuntu-desktop and/or kubuntu-desktop. and ubotu is a bot.
2006-12-04T14:30:00.000Z	OdiiN	LjL	i want kde with all resources as dcop and without big apps as koffice, kaffeine, etc that i will never use, kde-core did not have all that i want, is that posible?
