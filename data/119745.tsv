2007-12-25T16:40:00.000Z	Riddick		does anyone know how to fix this bug under ubuntu?  when i log into my ubuntu machine to use irssi from my mac the delete / backspace key on wintendo works fine.  once i launch irssi it doesnt backspace delete misspellings anymore.  i have to use the arrow key to go back and then press delete for the word to be deleted.  this is really freaking annoying.
2007-12-25T16:41:00.000Z	Riddick		i read on some of the ubuntu blogs/faqs this is a bug, but i want a fix / workaround.  it is driving me crazy not to be able to normal delete.
