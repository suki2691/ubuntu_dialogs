2006-01-15T15:27:00.000Z	joseph	odat	tonyyarusso:  I want my user to have no admin permissions at all, and I want my admin user to have all the admin permissions.  When the user is logged on to his gnome session, I want to be able to launch programs that require admin permissions and have a dialogue come up asking me for appropriate password.
