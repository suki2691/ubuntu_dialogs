2005-04-13T06:17:00.000Z	zenwhen	mz2	what? Are you teling me your card gets comparable performance?
2005-04-13T06:18:00.000Z	mz2	zenwhen	not identical, but it's not dramatically lower. i'm perfectly happy with the 3d performance and quality (no opengl rendering glitches anymore) i get out of 3d apps in linux at the moment both with nvidia and ati
