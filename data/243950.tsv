2005-04-02T10:43:00.000Z	Tomcat23		I'm a new linux user, and I've only gotten gentoo instaled (with gnome and working after 2 weeks...what a learning curve...)
2005-04-02T10:44:00.000Z	Tomcat23		But my next install I'm considering Ubuntu, coz it's based on Debian and from all the reviews the synapse(?) fronted for apt-get is well worth it...
