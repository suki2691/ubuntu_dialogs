2006-07-23T12:52:00.000Z	tamale		Hello everyone!  I'm running dapper on gnome and I would like right-click dragging like windows.. so that I can drag with a right-click and choose what i want to happen when i release... is this possible?   I would also like to be able to make alt+right click dragging change window sizes like fluxbox, but this doesn't work because right clicking at all currently brings up the context menu and it's really frustrating!!!  any help would be much a
