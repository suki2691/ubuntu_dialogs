2012-09-01T20:51:00.000Z	Ion330HT		I am having some printer issues where Windows Vista won't access/use the ubuntu printer that I have shared. It is visible in Vista but when I try to access it, it complains on faulty drivers and ask me to install the right ones. I do that but then vista complains that it cannot connect to printer
2012-09-01T20:51:00.000Z	Ion330HT		Any clues on how to fix this?
2012-09-01T20:52:00.000Z	diligentdino	Ion330HT	sounds like a windows problem
