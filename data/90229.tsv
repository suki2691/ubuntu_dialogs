2009-11-15T16:41:00.000Z	twolaid_		i have a little problem.. my a key is not working, and xev does not throw an "KeyPress" event but just "FocusIn"/"FocusOut".. so i guess it does not even send a proper keycode..

2009-11-15T16:42:00.000Z	twolaid_		i can only type a little 'a' when i activate capslock and press shift+a
