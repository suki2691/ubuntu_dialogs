2005-07-26T16:41:00.000Z	Oompa		 does anyone know where I can find the gaim install? I am trying to configure it with gfire and when I try /usrs/lib/gaim it says "configure: error:Library requirements (gaim) not met, consider adgustsing the PKG_CONFIG_PATH enviroment variable if your libraries are in a nonstandard prefix so pkg-config can find them."

2005-07-26T16:42:00.000Z	Oompa		Xtc0: No I mean in the file structure
2005-07-26T16:42:00.000Z	Oompa	patient0	Where can I get that?
