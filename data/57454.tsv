2009-05-12T22:35:00.000Z	HalfManHalfLegen		i'm using ubuntu under vmware in windows xp to run an ircd, i can't start it though cause i need to open my router ports, but how do i open router ports for a virtual machine's address?

2009-05-12T22:36:00.000Z	HalfManHalfLegen	sebsebseb	it's the server to host an irc network
