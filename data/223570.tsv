2007-02-20T10:09:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	z-tau	gnome-vfs-daemon I think
2007-02-20T10:10:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	z-tau	for USB drives and stuff, I think that's what handles it... don't quote me though I've been wrong before...
2007-02-20T10:17:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	z-tau	never really thought about it. There must be something in a wiki somewhere though.
