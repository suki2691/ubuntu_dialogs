2009-05-21T02:33:00.000Z	Jenny26		Hi everyone -- I have 2 laptops, one running 9.04 and the other running Vista Home Premium.  I've shared some files via Vista but am unable to see them on my Ubuntu laptop.  Is there a walkthrough someone could point me to about how to setup ubuntu-win sharing?

2009-05-21T02:38:00.000Z	Jenny26	blubloblu	When I click on the Windows Network in the Network file browser on my ubuntu laptop, it gives me the error message "Unable to mount location" -- does this mean i need samba?
