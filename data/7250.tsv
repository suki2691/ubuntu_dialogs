2011-12-16T20:26:00.000Z	AaronCampbell		wow...really?  I assumed I was missing something obvious...there's no built-in way to move it?!?
2011-12-16T20:28:00.000Z	AaronCampbell		My left monitor is WAY to the left and just used to keep an eye on IRC, etc.  My other 3 monitors are right in front of me.  It's a REAL pain havin it that far left
