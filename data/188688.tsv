2006-08-13T09:42:00.000Z	grubedithelp		Hi, I'm a linux newb, and I just made the switch yesterday with no prior exposure to linux or ubuntu, and I'm getting an error when dma is enabled on boot, but i can enable it from within the os.  When dma is enabled I get "<0> Kernel panic -not syncing: Aiee, killing interrupt!".  Is there a way to fix this without having to manually turn on dma every time I boot up?
