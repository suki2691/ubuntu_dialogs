2007-05-23T14:18:00.000Z	kitche	ToddKitchen	how is FIOS connected I haven't got this in yet but is it just like a modem with ethernet or does it connect a different way? since some people don't know how FiOS is setup yet exactly to help very much

2007-05-23T14:20:00.000Z	kitche	ToddKitchen	not a clue since routers are different depending on the maker and such but I would first look at the wifi setup among others check your dhcp list on the router see what it says though
