2010-02-05T16:48:00.000Z	halldor89		I'm trying to install a program and get "error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
2010-02-05T16:48:00.000Z	halldor89		Anyone know what I can do to fix that?
2010-02-05T16:49:00.000Z	theadmin	halldor89	You need to get a library file... Let me see where
2010-02-05T16:51:00.000Z	halldor89	theadmin	I know, but I tried installing it with 'sudo apt-get install libstdc++5' but it doesn't work
