2010-04-23T09:22:00.000Z	dotnet41		why doesnt the bios handle the os boot menus - seems like it should be part of its job
2010-04-23T09:24:00.000Z	dotnet41		couldn't the bios run something similar to grub that would allow config calls to set it up?
2010-04-23T09:24:00.000Z	dotnet41		well I know currently it couldn't...
