2008-03-28T19:20:00.000Z	jimcooncat		I need to back some stuff from an infected Win 2000 computer over an ethernet link. Can I use a Gutsy LiveCD, or should I use a Hardy Beta? Or Knoppix, SystemRescue?

2008-03-28T19:22:00.000Z	jimcooncat	bazhang	no. I don't want to boot it into Win2000 at all, just run a livecd so I can get at the filesystem.
