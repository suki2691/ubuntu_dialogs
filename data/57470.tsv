2009-05-13T02:32:00.000Z	vertix		cmon, kernel dudes, nobody is around?
2009-05-13T02:32:00.000Z	dtchen	vertix	#ubuntu-kernel, but keep in mind it's a devel channel.
2009-05-13T02:34:00.000Z	vertix	dtchen	thanx, i wouldn't want to go talk to kernel dudes on that chan. they are prolly arrogant as hell and i am a kernel level myself :(
