2009-04-30T02:00:00.000Z	likwid		why can't i choose the free space on my hard drive? it's showing blue which is where the winxp is at.. the green is at 2% where ubuntu would be installed? and then theres 40% free white space?
2009-04-30T02:02:00.000Z	likwid		will it use the white space to install into as well? or is it just going to be the 2% of space being used by ubuntu
2009-04-30T02:02:00.000Z	likwid		ok nevermind i guess i will just figure it out myself
