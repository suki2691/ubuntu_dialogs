2004-11-08T13:03:00.000Z	Eno_		<trans_err> i'm trying to resize a partition with parted and it tells me that my ext2 filesystem has a rather strange layout... any ideas?
2004-11-08T13:04:00.000Z	trans_err	Eno_	yeah
2004-11-08T13:04:00.000Z	trans_err	Eno_	parted won't do a thing with ext3
2004-11-08T13:05:00.000Z	trans_err	Eno_	If I can convert it back to an ext2 I should be fine
