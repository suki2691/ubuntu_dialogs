And I thought that, when your question isn't directed at someone, it can "get lost"... so I was just making sure mine didn't get lost. I'm sorry if it was out of line. Thank you for letting me know. :)
2009-09-25T07:13:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	genii	when would be an appropriate time to re-ask my question?
2009-09-25T07:13:00.000Z	genii	ZoeyMarie	Every 10 minutes or more is not considered rude/annoying :)
