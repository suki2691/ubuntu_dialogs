2007-01-16T14:21:00.000Z	jpjacobs	illusin1	the kernel has  not much to do with multimedia
2007-01-16T14:22:00.000Z	illusin1	jpjacobs	to quote the rosegarden manual: "It is theoretically possible to run JACK and Rosegarden with an  ordinary kernel, but I have never obtained acceptable results, even on  machine with fairly high specs. CPU power and abundant RAM are  insufficient to guarantee reliable performance, and you will,  unfortunately, need to run a specialized kernel."
