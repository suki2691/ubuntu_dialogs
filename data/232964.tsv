2009-12-19T20:01:00.000Z	Brooklyn		So here I am. HP notebook. Happy Ubuntu 9.10 user. And now I need to install dual boot with Windows :( Don't ask why, it has to be done. Easy way: start all over again and begin with Windows. Hard way: Leave Ubuntu as it is and install Windows.
2009-12-19T20:01:00.000Z	Brooklyn		Does anyone have a tutorial for that?
2009-12-19T20:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	Brooklyn	why not use a virtual machine to install windows ?
2009-12-19T20:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	Brooklyn	ok; then make a parition for windows install and the restore grub
