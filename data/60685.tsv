2009-04-08T06:45:00.000Z	DaveJansen	n8tuser	I just installed it yesterday, is reinstallation the only option? That kinda sucks..
2009-04-08T06:47:00.000Z	DaveJansen	n8tuser	It worked fine until I tried to get compiz to work using this guide: http://tr.im/ipGq. I have removed the changes but I'm guessing it happened after running the first command
2009-04-08T06:49:00.000Z	DaveJansen	n8tuser	Great.. guess I'll have to reinstall then. Thanks for the help though!
