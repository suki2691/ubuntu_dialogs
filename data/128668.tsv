2007-07-07T13:36:00.000Z	level1		Hi, I'm having some trouble with apt-get... it refuses to work until I run apt-get -f install (no arguments) which wants to remove kubunutu desktop
2007-07-07T13:37:00.000Z	level1		This is after I installed something from debian-multimedia
2007-07-07T13:37:00.000Z	vinneh	level1	that means there is a broken package
2007-07-07T13:37:00.000Z	level1	vinneh	well, how do I get it to fix the broken package without removing my desktop environment?
