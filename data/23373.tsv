2010-11-12T21:27:00.000Z	lea123		I just installed ubuntu on my Windows Vista- However it doesn't show up as a choice to me while booting up. Disk Manager shows the partions though..
2010-11-12T21:28:00.000Z	lea123		Does Disk Management in Vista show the type of file system ?? such as ext3 ?
2010-11-12T21:28:00.000Z	bindi	lea123	it doesnt support that
2010-11-12T21:28:00.000Z	lea123	bindi	I meant in Disk Managment
