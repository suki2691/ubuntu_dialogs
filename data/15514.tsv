2011-11-30T09:51:00.000Z	escott	phenrique	no it is for both, but amd created the 64bit standard so their name is on it
2011-11-30T09:55:00.000Z	escott	phenrique	try nomodeset
2011-11-30T10:01:00.000Z	escott	phenrique	you could try the alternate installer, but there should be a nomodeset option in the installer somewhere
