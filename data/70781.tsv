2008-12-24T08:21:00.000Z	adrian007	zelda	you could try using the log out applet instead of the user switcher applet
2008-12-24T08:22:00.000Z	zelda	adrian007	thanks. But I dont want that. is there a way around?
2008-12-24T08:24:00.000Z	adrian007	zelda	not that i can think of - maybe you could uninstall pidgin and install a version which isnt integrated with the applet
