2007-07-21T10:05:00.000Z	ArielMT		how do i roll back to a previous version of a package?  the latest wine and dependencies have a bug that the previous version didn't
2007-07-21T10:05:00.000Z	hexstar	ArielMT	you may have to download and compile an older version
2007-07-21T10:06:00.000Z	ArielMT	burner	i did, and i'm at the latest version.  the bug remains. :/
2007-07-21T10:06:00.000Z	hexstar	ArielMT	you could try compiling the latest version
