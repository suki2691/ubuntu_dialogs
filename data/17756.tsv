2012-08-03T20:46:00.000Z	roasted_		Hello! I'm trying to get DHCP to auto start on Ubuntu (dhcp server that is). It's not auto starting... I have to manually issue sudo service isc-dhcp-server start each time. Is there a way to work around this BESIDES the gui "startup applications"?? I want it to run automatically as a startup service/daemon without needing to log in, etc.
