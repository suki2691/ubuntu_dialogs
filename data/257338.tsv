2006-01-28T10:38:00.000Z	patrick_		I have a question pertaining to Sound Driver in teamspeak.  When I use OSS in teamspeak (only one that seems to work) I lose audo in everything else.  Anyway to assign Teamspeak to an alternitive driver that wont take over my other sounds or game sounds?
2006-01-28T10:39:00.000Z	johnnybezak	patrick_	that sounds like a problem with oss, rather than with your driver i'm not sure how to help though.
2006-01-28T10:40:00.000Z	patrick_	johnnybezak	it does this samething on my other computer
2006-01-28T10:40:00.000Z	patrick_	johnnybezak	is there an alternate driver I can point teamspeak to?
