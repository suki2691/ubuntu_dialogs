2010-09-18T21:21:00.000Z	PotcFdk		Hello. I want to know how to host Ubuntu applications on launchpad. I've read several tutorials already, but I somehow don't understand them.
2010-09-18T21:21:00.000Z	PotcFdk		Launchpad seems to need source-packages or sth. like that, but how/when are they going to be compiled?
2010-09-18T21:21:00.000Z	AbhiJit	PotcFdk	try in #launchpad
2010-09-18T21:24:00.000Z	AbhiJit	PotcFdk	someone in #ubuntu-packaging may be?
