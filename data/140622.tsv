2008-03-20T21:40:00.000Z	LjL-Temp	peter77	uh, "as if they were on a server" - no, you need a server, such as apache2. of course you can then just reach it locally.
2008-03-20T21:41:00.000Z	LjL-Temp	peter77	otherwise, you can install "php5-cli" and use it as a scripting language like many - but nothing to do with the web
2008-03-20T21:41:00.000Z	LjL-Temp	peter77	then yes.
