2009-10-28T11:22:00.000Z	Psinetic		I'm on Ubuntu 9.04. I'm having a problem where everytime i click on a specific column in the places menu it plays dvd's instead of opens folders. I have been trying to get help with this in THIS channel for almost a week and it's still not resolved. I refuse to talk to anyone who is not in the US Navy or Retired from the US Navy

2009-10-28T11:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Psinetic	why do they have to be from the navy?
2009-10-28T11:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Psinetic	do navy folks know more about ubuntu than anyone else or something?
