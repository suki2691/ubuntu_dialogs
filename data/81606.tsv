2009-08-11T16:27:00.000Z	Pvpeter1		I can't login to hamachi, I've removed iptables and it still says logging in .... failed.. Any ideas?
2009-08-11T16:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Pvpeter1	can you ping the server you are logging onto?
2009-08-11T16:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Pvpeter1	i'd fid out and check that first
2009-08-11T16:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Pvpeter1	if you get bad username/pass then you are hitting the server
