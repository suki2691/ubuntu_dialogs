2010-10-27T06:25:00.000Z	Guest73780		I just upgraded to lucid.  I'm on the wireless network, but there's no indicator anywhere saying so.  Shouldn't there be some sort of icon up on the top bar somewhere?
2010-10-27T06:25:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Guest73780	yes, it should look like radar beams going upwards...?
2010-10-27T06:26:00.000Z	Guest73780	arrrghhh	ok, it's not there.  What's it called and how do I get it there?
2010-10-27T06:26:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Guest73780	well it's part of nm-applet... try rebooting.
