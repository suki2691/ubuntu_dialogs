2008-04-26T01:48:00.000Z	openuser		hi everybody!, I have a download on firefox 3.0, and I would like reinstall ubuntu, how can I continue the download once Ubuntu is reinstalled from the point where the download stoped?
2008-04-26T01:50:00.000Z	chubs730	openuser	why are you waiting to finish the download until after the reinstall? out of curiosity
2008-04-26T01:52:00.000Z	openuser	chubs730	I explain the dude badly, what I want is resume the download on other computer with ubuntu 8.04 (I also have it), but I don't know how to do it!
