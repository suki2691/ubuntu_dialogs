2007-09-16T13:34:00.000Z	maestrojed		I am trying to make a second hd on my ubuntu box a shared drive (file server for a small office).  SAMBA was suggested to me and I am trying to find a tutorial to help me set it up.  I found this http://onlyubuntu.blogspot.com/2007/04/mount-network-file-systems-nfssamba-in.html but an confused.  Do I need to set up both NFS and SAMBA or just one of those?

2007-09-16T13:45:00.000Z	maestrojed	dgjones	no win and mac boxes also
2007-09-16T13:49:00.000Z	dgjones	maestrojed	rite, i'm only sharing to ubuntu boxes with nfs, not sure what you need to share to the windows machines
