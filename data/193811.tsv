2006-05-04T10:39:00.000Z	Parkotron		Would someone mind taking a look at this: http://kubuntu.pastebin.com/688161 ? Obviously it's someone trying to get into my system through ssh, but is it worth worrying about?
2006-05-04T10:39:00.000Z	Madpilot	Parkotron	do you have the SSH server installed?
2006-05-04T10:40:00.000Z	Madpilot		!tell basura about enter
2006-05-04T10:41:00.000Z	Parkotron	Madpilot	Yes, I have SSH installed and I use it a lot. eduardo_, I'm not overly concerned, I've just never come across anything like that before.
