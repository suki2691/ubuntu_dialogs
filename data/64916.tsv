2010-03-07T13:11:00.000Z	mbn_18		Hi, just added a new screen to my computer ( now I have 2 screens ). The problem is that I cant drag app from one LCD to the other. any idea?
2010-03-07T13:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	mbn_18	are you using nvidia?
2010-03-07T13:12:00.000Z	mbn_18	ZykoticK9	Yes, 7600GT. All is set and the secondery screen is working with his own toolbar. I can also move the mouse over it. but not apps
