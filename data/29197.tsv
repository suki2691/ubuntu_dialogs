2010-07-12T13:01:00.000Z	Slimp		I'm using ubuntu as an internet gate way/firewall.  How can I block internet hostnames - not just IPs - from computers on my lan?
2010-07-12T13:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Slimp	you could use firestarter and add a rule
2010-07-12T13:01:00.000Z	Slimp	ActionParsnip	what kind of rule?
