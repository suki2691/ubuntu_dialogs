2008-04-09T22:54:00.000Z	Barr1		Greetings. I have XFCE running under Ubuntu 7.4. My screensaver preferences list lots of screensavers that aren't installed. How do I install them? I've not been able to find them by name in the Synaptic Package Manager.
2008-04-09T22:55:00.000Z	hischild	Barr1	tried searching for screensaver?
2008-04-09T22:55:00.000Z	Barr1	hischild	Hmm. That would make sense.
2008-04-09T22:59:00.000Z	hischild	Barr1	yes that's meant at  you ( mdd4696 )
