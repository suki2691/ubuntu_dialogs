2007-04-15T16:13:00.000Z	tatters		I got a analogue TV card with infra red remote control, on a clean install of feisty if I open up a terminal and press remote control it recognises only the number keys, volume control...........does anyone know how I can setup so all my buttons are recognised, I read about lircd and create a lircrc but I assume Ubuntu is already recognising my Remote and merely have to change something...but what?
