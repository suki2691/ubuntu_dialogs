2007-07-20T16:42:00.000Z	PriceChild	myusrnm	you can't edit mounted drives... like your / So you'd need to use a live cd perhaps?
2007-07-20T16:43:00.000Z	PriceChild	myusrnm	yeah, start up the live cd environment then start gparted
2007-07-20T16:44:00.000Z	PriceChild	myusrnm	yes, but you'll need to "/msg ubotu fixgrub" to find out how to recover ubuntu's boot loader
