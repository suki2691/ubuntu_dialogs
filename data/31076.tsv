2010-05-29T06:40:00.000Z	MrKlown		something is very wrong... after about 3 minutes of my computer being turned on it freezes now
2010-05-29T06:40:00.000Z	MrKlown		any ideas?
2010-05-29T06:41:00.000Z	Ken1	MrKlown	That's quite a vague question. Is there anything plugged in to it? iPods, USB sticks, etc?
2010-05-29T06:42:00.000Z	Ken1	MrKlown	Do you have a default installation, too? Is there something big that might be slowing everything down.
