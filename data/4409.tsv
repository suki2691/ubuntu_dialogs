2012-04-14T22:48:00.000Z	scott_z		is there a way to check a filesystem for errors while it is mounted or unmounted both nondestructive and destructive. I have a file that gets about 3/4 the way through on a copy and then gets an error. I want to see if it is a bad spot on the HD or a corrupt file. If it is a bad spot on the HD is there a way to isolate it and lock it out. I am getting ready to move from 32 to 64 bit and am backing things up. I want to alleviate any potential problems ahea
