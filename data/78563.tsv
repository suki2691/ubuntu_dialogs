2010-07-28T12:46:00.000Z	coz_	mick02	 in all honesty  I never do that  so I dont have much expeirence with it... I follow my own advice :)
2010-07-28T12:47:00.000Z	mick02	coz_	fair enough, I've been thinking about moving my home folder to it's own partition but I'm being quite lazy about doing it!
2010-07-28T12:47:00.000Z	coz_	mick02	 yeah on this point you may have to get the advice of someone else  and maybe good advice about that on ##linux channel :)
