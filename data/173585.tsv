2009-07-19T01:18:00.000Z	_Space_Case_		what is the difference between ext3 and ext4 format?
2009-07-19T01:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Space_Case_	Ext4  has much faster boot up than Ext3, and it's better with bigger files.  However it's not 100% stable  or whatever in Ubuntu 9.04, because they don't have at least 2.6.30 kernel
2009-07-19T01:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Space_Case_	Ext4 will be the default file system in the next Ubuntu though,  and people need to clean install Ubuntu for full support
2009-07-19T01:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Space_Case_	since the Ext3 to Ext4 conversion isn't that good
