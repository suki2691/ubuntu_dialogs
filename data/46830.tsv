2009-09-26T23:47:00.000Z	JonathanEllis1		Can anyone suggest an easy to use software development kit along the lines of Visual Basic? I need to make a very simple app along the lines of a spreadsheet or database macro. I have experience of programming macros in Excel and Access and a little Pascal from years ago
