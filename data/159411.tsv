2006-11-12T12:03:00.000Z	Tokenbad		ok I made a huge mistake and wonder if can fix it without doing a whole reinstall...I had a var dir on my slave drive for vms from vmware....and I wanted to remove it...so did sudo rm -r /var/
2006-11-12T12:04:00.000Z	Tokenbad		and it did the var from my OS disk...
2006-11-12T12:04:00.000Z	Tokenbad		is there a way to replace the files there
