2012-03-27T23:06:00.000Z	DarsVaeda		how do I disable icedtea plugin? I installed sun java 7 and have that plugin already showing in firefox but icedtea is still there and seems to overwrite it
2012-03-27T23:07:00.000Z	gilmore	DarsVaeda	Is it a firefox plugin?  Or ubuntu package?
2012-03-27T23:09:00.000Z	gilmore	DarsVaeda	Oh, sorry, didn't see you say you installed it manually.
2012-03-27T23:10:00.000Z	gilmore	DarsVaeda	But you sould still be able to use dpkg to remove it.
