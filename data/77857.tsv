2009-08-11T23:27:00.000Z	hdon		Hello all! How may I convince RhythmBox to open a music CD disc image that I made using Disc Copier? (The image produced includes a TOC file)
2009-08-11T23:28:00.000Z	Jeruvy	hdon	if its a true image, simply mount it, then point rythmbox at the new mount.
2009-08-11T23:33:00.000Z	hdon		I do not believe an Audio CD contains a Filesystem Image. I do not believe Linux mounts any filesystem as a predicate to playing an Audio CD (attn Jeruvy)
2009-08-11T23:35:00.000Z	hdon	Jeruvy	What filesystem type (as in the -t argument to mount) do you think an Audio CD might require?
