2009-09-08T00:45:00.000Z	MrPiracy		is it possible to have /home residing in an NTFS partition? any major problems if i try to do that?
2009-09-08T00:46:00.000Z	orificium_	MrPiracy	I'm pretty sure thats not possible.  Why would you want to dot aht?
2009-09-08T00:47:00.000Z	MrPiracy	orificium_	cos i want these files separated from the main linux partition (backup purposes) and also i wanted to access these files from windows and there's no actual windows-like program to read ext4 partitions
2009-09-08T00:48:00.000Z	orificium_	MrPiracy	I believe there are programs to do READ-ONLY access of ext2/ext3
