2012-02-13T09:10:00.000Z	Zillow		I have a 5770 also, I get about 0.015BTC a day with it
2012-02-13T09:10:00.000Z	Zillow		oops no, 0.15BTC*
2012-02-13T09:11:00.000Z	neiz	Zillow	crossfire it for .3BTC :p
2012-02-13T09:13:00.000Z	Zillow	neiz	if I could afford another, I think I would opt for a 5830 or 5850, but my 1 HD 5770 is good enough
