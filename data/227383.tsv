2007-03-06T17:24:00.000Z	whieimhere		Im looking for a tutorial on how to split large MPEG or AVI files into two or more pieces for writing to DVD since I don't have a DVDRW
2007-03-06T17:24:00.000Z	whieimhere		Any ideas?
2007-03-06T17:25:00.000Z	whieimhere		Piratehead what is that and will it split files?
