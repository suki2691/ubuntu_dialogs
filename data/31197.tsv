2010-12-29T20:42:00.000Z	Darael	nadn	That's a known bug in the help file.  You're on Maverick really.
2010-12-29T20:42:00.000Z	Darael	nadn	Run "lsb_release -a" to be sure.
2010-12-29T20:44:00.000Z	nadn	Darael	your right thank you very much, didn't seem right ya know?  says 10.10 under lsb_release.  with a multitouch tx2z i don't wanna play with unstable nemore, i hear there is good support in maverick
