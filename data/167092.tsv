2007-12-15T10:14:00.000Z	Slynderdale		I was planning to install both Ubuntu and Kubuntu to see which version I perfer but from what I heard, te application menu would get cluttred with applications from both versions no matter what session you use. Is there a way to prevent this from happening? LIke only show GNOMe apps under Gnome and Kubuntu apps under Kubuntu?
