2007-01-21T09:48:00.000Z	Gosha		am i not explaining good enough? .. see .. i download ubuntu .. and installed it .. then i did apt-get install xubuntu-desktop .. and it changed the startup thing to another DM xdm, or whatever it's called for xfce .. but i rarely use xfce.. however i thought i'd try the kubuntu desktop .. so i did apt-get install kubuntu-desktop .. and now the dm changed to kdm .. and it started allways starting the kthread and stuff
2007-01-21T09:48:00.000Z	Gosha		that is linked to kdm, whatever session i start .. since they're started before i start the session anyway .. so now i wonder .. how can i change back to GDM? or make less stuff starta at startup?
