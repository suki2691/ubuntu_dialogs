2008-10-08T19:59:00.000Z	harveyd		Im looking to assign keyboard shortcuts that will focus particular applications, like pressing f1 to focus firefox
2008-10-08T19:59:00.000Z	harveyd		anyone know if / how this is possible
2008-10-08T20:00:00.000Z	murlidhar	harveyd	if using gnome then look in preference>keyboard shortcuts
2008-10-08T20:02:00.000Z	murlidhar	harveyd	actually i don't use gnome and i don't think it can be done using bash .
