2006-08-12T12:43:00.000Z	Hansel	hyperstream	- its in the ircd config... are you using bahamut or what?  :P
2006-08-12T12:44:00.000Z	Hansel	hyperstream	- not familiar with that one.  I'd try #ircd or #unreal.  If those dont exist or people cant help read the help file that came with it.  If you still dont get it try to google or come back to me  :)
