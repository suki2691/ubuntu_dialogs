2005-02-13T15:34:00.000Z	ChaosZ3RO		Okay, I can't get back into anything but a terminal. It says something about xserver being already open. I restarted a few times, and it still doesn't let me into xfce or gnome. Any ideas? :S
2005-02-13T15:34:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	ChaosZ3RO	does alt+f7 do anything?
2005-02-13T15:35:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	ChaosZ3RO	is it a fresh install?
2005-02-13T15:35:00.000Z	pybe-lappy	ChaosZ3RO	warty or hoary
