2008-09-04T22:12:00.000Z	firelog		hello.   I need to transfer a folder and all files (and all subfolder--- everything under one folder, basically) from my ubuntu box to my windows client.  I tried smbclient ... but that doesn't seem to allow me to transfer folders?  (I tried mput ).  Is there a better way, or am I mistaken in assuming that smbclient doesn't allow complete folder transfers?
