2007-05-17T05:33:00.000Z	chewd		another question.... my wifi router at home uses WPA authentication.... i dont see an option for it in network settings... 1. do i need to install WPA in order to use that connection? 2. is WEP better, should i just reconfigure my router to use it instead? 3. whats the difference? (in a nutshell)
