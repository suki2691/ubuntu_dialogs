2009-02-13T03:00:00.000Z	b^j		iptables and I aren't getting along, can someone give me a hand.  I am trying to redirect port 3389 from my ubuntu host system to a vm that is nated.  I see the SYNs sent from the system that is trying to connect, but never get a response.  When I listen with wireshark on the vmnet i see the syn come through, the SYNACK sent and a RST come back.  This never makes it out to the wire though.
