2012-07-03T01:08:00.000Z	angelixd		so I tried to update to Quantal and failed miserably, and now my nvidia drivers are particularly screwed up. the install scripts are complaining for a lack of the XKit.utils python library. however, the only solution I can find, to reinstall 'xkit-python' isn't possible
2012-07-03T01:08:00.000Z	angelixd		anyone got any ideas how to deal with this?

2012-07-03T01:09:00.000Z	shaneo	angelixd	if you upgraded you will have to reinstall 12.04
