2008-09-01T23:35:00.000Z	pdaous4	ncfi1013_	okay, here's a good video download bookmarklet: http://1024k.de/bookmarklets/video-bookmarklets.html It doesn't actually save it as an MPEG, but you can convert flv videos to other formats using mencoder. My gosh, this channel is moving too fast. I'll get you the rest in a sec.
