2010-08-25T10:47:00.000Z	thune3	deevz	fine, the question was : where are you seeing it
2010-08-25T10:48:00.000Z	thune3	deevz	echo puts a newline on there, are you using echo -n ?
2010-08-25T10:50:00.000Z	thune3	deevz	yeah i guess i don't follow. i run the following and there is no junk at the end:  theyear=$(date +%Y) ; echo -n $theyear
