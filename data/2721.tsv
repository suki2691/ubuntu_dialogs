2012-10-10T21:11:00.000Z	hilo		I've come across an issue with my flash player that I cannot solve. Skin tones and similar colors all show a very strong blue color to them. Interestingly, embedded flash videos in facebook do not exhibit the issue, but it is everywhere else (including the same video on youtube).
2012-10-10T21:13:00.000Z	bazhang	hilo	fullscreen the flash, then disable hw acceleration
2012-10-10T21:15:00.000Z	hilo	bazhang	bobweaver, I have tried disabling acceleration, and purging and reinstalling
