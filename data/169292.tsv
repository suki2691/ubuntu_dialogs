2006-09-29T10:59:00.000Z	Jas-Nix		hello, I have a ViewSonic monitor, and the only way to get it to work is to add a ModeLine to my xorg.conf, how can I do that with the livecd ?
2006-09-29T11:00:00.000Z	nickspoon	Jas-Nix	try the Alternate Boot CD.
2006-09-29T11:00:00.000Z	Jas-Nix	nickspoon	ok so can't do it with livecd huh, the alternate requires a full install without being aable to try it out right ?
2006-09-29T11:01:00.000Z	nickspoon	Jas-Nix	yeah.
