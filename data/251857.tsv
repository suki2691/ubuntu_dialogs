2005-02-20T15:14:00.000Z	johnnygeargrinde		I have a Dell laptop running Warty, I am having trouble with my touch pad, how can I alter it?
2005-02-20T15:15:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	johnnygeargrinde	what sort of trouble?
2005-02-20T15:17:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	johnnygeargrinde	probably, the sensitivity can be changed with Preferences > Mouse
2005-02-20T15:17:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	johnnygeargrinde	that held true with my Thinkpad T40 anyhow... although I don't know how to configure more advanced touchpad functions
