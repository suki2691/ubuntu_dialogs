2009-06-24T17:18:00.000Z	Aacron		hey ladies and gents, I have a quick question:  does linux have any good (thorough) means to check a hard-drive and/or pull data off a dying HD?  my windows partition just froze (hard-locked my system while it was at it) and I did a SMART test and it has a TONNE of errors.  Bascially I need to get the data off of the NTFS partition and put it somewhere safe, then stick it on another HD
