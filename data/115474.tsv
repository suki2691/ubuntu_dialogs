2007-10-23T09:23:00.000Z	dzer0		hmmm... for some reason I get an error when I try to navigate to any NTFS drives... it says it cant mount them
2007-10-23T09:24:00.000Z	dzer0		says something like logfile indicates unclean shutdown, operation not supported, mount is denied because NTFS is marked to be in use
2007-10-23T09:24:00.000Z	matx	dzer0	are you using ntfs-3g
2007-10-23T09:24:00.000Z	dzer0	matx	I didn't change any of that from the default install so I'm not sure
