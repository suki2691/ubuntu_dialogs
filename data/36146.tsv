I downloaded the 32bit version of 10.04 and burnt it, placed it in my cd drive and restarted my comp. I loaded up the boot menu and told it to boot from CD. It took me to the language selection menu and the menu that asks me if I want to try Ubuntu, Install, Check disc, etc. After

The cd light and hard drive light stayed on for a while after that (1 1/2 minutes?). After rebooting my computer when everything stopped XP does the same thing past the xp splash screen. Can't get it to go past either of them.
