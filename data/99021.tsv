2008-02-27T03:11:00.000Z	scudDA	amenado	Sorry, no change with autoclean. Where are those files? Will deleting them help with it getting stuck?
2008-02-27T03:15:00.000Z	scudDA	amenado	that folder contains archives (folder), pkgcache.bin and srcpkgcache.bin
2008-02-27T03:19:00.000Z	scudDA	amenado	That says it has changed zero files. I guess the files already there are ok. It just doesn't want to download any more.
