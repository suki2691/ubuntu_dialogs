2011-04-25T01:38:00.000Z	JamesJRH		Hello. Will there be a release candidate for Natty?
2011-04-25T01:39:00.000Z	rww	JamesJRH	and in general, natty stuff goes in #ubuntu+1 until release
2011-04-25T01:45:00.000Z	JamesJRH	rww	Thank you. No then, Beta 2 is the last pre-release. If I install it now, when Natty is released, should I just update or reinstall?
