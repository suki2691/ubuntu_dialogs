2008-03-10T00:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	amews_aj	if it has to be explained, you wouldn't understand..Google, you'll find your answers
2008-03-10T00:42:00.000Z	amews_aj	IndyGunFreak	and moreati: Beside faster, open source and free. I only see bad things. Non-compatibility with quite a lot of hardware and especially the LACK of using WINDOWS SOFTWARE. You need to find completely new programs, and you like the ones for windows.
2008-03-10T00:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	amews_aj	i cn't be any more clear, and this is off topic for the channel, google holds the answers to what you're looking for, but if it has to be explained to you, then its probably pointless
