2008-05-01T09:11:00.000Z	Randocal		I am sitting on an AMD Sempron Mobile 2600 with 1.5gb of ram and a 10mbit cable connection, can anyone give me a rough ballpark idea of how long it would take me to perform an upgrade from Gutsy to Hardy?
2008-05-01T09:11:00.000Z	astro76	Randocal	about 1 to 1.5 hours
2008-05-01T09:12:00.000Z	astro76	Randocal	it works fine for 99.99% of people
