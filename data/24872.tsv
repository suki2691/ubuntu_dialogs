2012-08-30T06:42:00.000Z	crimsonmane	iwtiydtym	because the effects you're running. turn off compiz or any other effects system and you'll cool down.
2012-08-30T06:44:00.000Z	crimsonmane	iwtiydtym	mine doesn't heat up after turning off effects. go to 2d mode or something?
2012-08-30T06:46:00.000Z	crimsonmane	iwtiydtym	and you've tried XFCE or LXDE as your desktop environment? these two should be very light-weight and low heat output
