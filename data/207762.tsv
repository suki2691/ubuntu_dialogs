2005-11-16T10:02:00.000Z	agtnz	shadeofgrey	are you looking for a minimal desktop or for an actual server install?
2005-11-16T10:02:00.000Z	shadeofgrey		....that also would take the time to talk to a relative newbie?  im pretty versed in using the full desktop version to get things done
2005-11-16T10:04:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	agtnz	 im looking to create a minimal desktop install designed for the single purpose of becoming a dedicated mailserver -- but im not looking to do everything by commandline... i want Xwindows and Gnome running, just because i only have the use of one hand and typing all the commands id need to really get things going with three fingers on one hand is a daunting task
