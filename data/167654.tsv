2006-10-14T08:49:00.000Z	NetVamp		ok I just burned a new cd with the image and still Boot from ATAPI CD-ROM: None ... DISK Boot Failure, Insert System Disk and press enter
2006-10-14T08:49:00.000Z	NetVamp		maybe some Bios settings? But its already set to boot from CD, don't know what else I could change on the settings to make it work
2006-10-14T08:50:00.000Z	NetVamp		@Dabar no I didn't, will do this in a few minuts @Paddy, no only one
2006-10-14T08:50:00.000Z	THX-1138	NetVamp	I wonder if it wasn't saved to disk as a file insted of a file structure.
