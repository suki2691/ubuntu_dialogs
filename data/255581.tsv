2009-05-06T22:53:00.000Z	Gacker		 i want to install ubuntulooks gtk engine but when i try to do that it gives a conflict with 'human' gtk engine. so i try to remove it nd the synaptics package manager says that 'ubuntu-desktop & ubuntu-artwork' will also have to be removed
2009-05-06T22:53:00.000Z	Gacker		 i cant afford to remove them
2009-05-06T22:54:00.000Z	Gacker		 so is there any other way to install?
2009-05-06T22:54:00.000Z	mcphail	Gacker	they are metapackages and can be removed
