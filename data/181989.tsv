2006-06-04T07:09:00.000Z	Lemsip		Is it just me having complete nightmares moving from Breezy to Dapper?  My upgrade failed :(
2006-06-04T07:09:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Lemsip	how did you try it
2006-06-04T07:10:00.000Z	Lemsip	Fujitsu	Used the upgrade manager.  That failed, so tried apt-get dist-upgrade, which also fails - I can paste you the error if you like, but it goes along the lines of "E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg exited unexpectedly"
2006-06-04T07:10:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Lemsip	/msg it to me.
