2008-05-03T01:46:00.000Z	mib_ma5qwk		i'm trying to watch a dvd using totem or vlc and they both say that the source is unreadable
2008-05-03T01:47:00.000Z	mib_ma5qwk		i know the dvd works, and one time, it worked in totem
2008-05-03T01:49:00.000Z	mib_ma5qwk		does anyone know why a dvd taht looks like it's mounting correctly would fail to play in totem?
