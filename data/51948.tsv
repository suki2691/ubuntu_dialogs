2009-07-25T07:43:00.000Z	hemightbetodd		I recently removed XFCE from my xubuntu installation and installed (successfully) Netbook Remix.  It worked for a week, and now boots without loading gnome-panel, and all applications open with no title bar and cannot be maximised, resized, or moved.  Maximus seems to still be operational.  What do I need to do to resture Netbook Remix to regular operation?
