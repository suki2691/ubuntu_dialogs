2007-08-25T10:45:00.000Z	recon		I found a great perl tutorial at http://www.perl.org/books/beginning-perl/ , however, _every single chapter is a seperate PDF file_. Is there any way to contencate them, or at least, make them a bit more convienent to access? I know this isn't strictly a ubuntu problem, but figured this'd be the best place to ask.
