2011-08-08T22:20:00.000Z	Escherial		hey, kind of a long shot, but do you think it'd be feasible to somehow run my windows installation on the other partition inside of ubuntu?
2011-08-08T22:20:00.000Z	Escherial		i'm thinking of using virtualbox to do it, perhaps, but i'm not sure where to start or if it's even feasible :\
2011-08-08T22:21:00.000Z	Dynetrax	Escherial	you could install virtualbox in ubuntu and create a virtual machine that boots from the windows partition
2011-08-08T22:22:00.000Z	Escherial	Dynetrax	right, that's what i was thinking about doing, but sadly it's not cut and dry
