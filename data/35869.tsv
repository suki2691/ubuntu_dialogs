2010-05-09T00:41:00.000Z	winXPuser	MichaelKohler	zoom - fit page width
2010-05-09T00:41:00.000Z	MichaelKohler	winXPuser	and how can I save this state? I need to send it to someone and it should be all the same size at his computer too
2010-05-09T00:45:00.000Z	winXPuser	MichaelKohler	no, this state can't be saved, this is user's preference; in the very best case you can set it in adobe pdf printer properties (properties button next to printer name in print dialog)
