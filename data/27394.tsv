2012-03-22T06:18:00.000Z	redtornado		Im running ubuntu 11.10 on a old pc. I did a fresh install (no other os, just ubuntu) on a 60gig hdd. i just came across a 80gig hdd which ive connected successfully as the slave drive. how do I go about adding this drive to my current ubuntu setup. would like to use it as extra space. I formatted the drive. it is now ext4 file system. is that all i need to do?
