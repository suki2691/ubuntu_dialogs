2010-08-04T03:42:00.000Z	brian__		how do I change from 127.0.1.1 to 127.0.0.1?
2010-08-04T03:42:00.000Z	ikonia	brian__	you don't, why do you need to
2010-08-04T03:43:00.000Z	brian__	ikonia	the install script im running says it should be 0.0.1 http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=blob_plain;f=docs/INSTALL.txt;hb=provision-0.4-alpha9
2010-08-04T03:44:00.000Z	ikonia	brian__	it's mapped in /etc/hosts, but I strongly advise you not to change it
