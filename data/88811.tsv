2008-06-10T06:28:00.000Z	darth	noxix	use smb://<machine>/c$/documents and settings ect
2008-06-10T06:28:00.000Z	darth		assuming your user is an admin on the windows box
2008-06-10T06:28:00.000Z	noxix	darth	i'm sorry, i meant to say that the other way around. How do I map my ubuntu home directory to my windows machine.
