2012-02-17T02:25:00.000Z	okibi		My fresh (but fully updated) install of 11.10 is mounting all external drives (tried three drives, one ext2 and two NTFS) as read-only. Even manual mounting through sudo with a -w option mounts them read-only. I'm having a hard time searching for solutions because of google noise with those keywords.
