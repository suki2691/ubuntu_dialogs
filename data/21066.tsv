2011-06-14T14:50:00.000Z	novitololo		hi, I've just bought a laptop which has a 64bit-cpu.  Why in the Ubuntu download page it says (32-bit recommended) ? Isn't 64 bit recommended for 64 bit -CPU ?
2011-06-14T14:50:00.000Z	sipior	novitololo	yes, the page is in error.
2011-06-14T14:51:00.000Z	novitololo	sipior	ok, thanks.  So 64bit ubuntu should work smoothly in my 64bit cpu
2011-06-14T14:52:00.000Z	sipior	novitololo	should do, yep.
