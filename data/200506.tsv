2006-10-23T06:24:00.000Z	Keyseir		Hey, I just ran dist-upgrade on my breezy badger system upgrading to dapper drake. After it finished and I restarted, X wouldn't start up, no GUI. Do I have to alter this "config" file? How?
2006-10-23T06:25:00.000Z	Keyseir		Could I please get some help? I upgraded breezy to dapper and now X won't load up
