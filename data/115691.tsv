2007-10-22T00:17:00.000Z	Jban		Hello, if I wanted to Migrate some Word documents / pictures over to my Linux parition, how would I do that now?  It didn't show me anything that I could bring over when it was installing, so could someone help me figure out how to do that now that I have everything working good?

2007-10-22T00:18:00.000Z	Jban	BHSPitLappy	Ok, then how would I do that... it is still my personal preference, but I would still be interesting in learning how to do either option.
