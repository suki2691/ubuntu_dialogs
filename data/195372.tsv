2007-05-26T14:21:00.000Z	Adam		Does anyone know why I have two instances of smb.conf, one in /etc/samba and the other in /usr/share/samba?
2007-05-26T14:21:00.000Z	kitche	Adam	/usr/share/samba is what the samba package isntalls as an example pretty much the system only looks at the one in /etc/samba/
