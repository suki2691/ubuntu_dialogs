2007-02-26T12:08:00.000Z	leon24	lemonsCC	i've recently installed ubuntu 6.10 server (no need for gui) and want to change my ip configuration from dchp to a static address.  i've changed my /etc/network/interfaces to reflect what i had assumed was the correct settings, but when i boot the server eth0 never comes up, and when i start it manually i have no ip address....
