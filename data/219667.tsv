2008-05-17T04:56:00.000Z	prower		Hi :> I just ran sudo update-alternatives --config usplash-artwork.so to change it from the kubuntu splash to the ubuntu splash...when i shut down everything is okay, but when i reboot it boots up with the kubuntu splash?

2008-05-17T04:57:00.000Z	prower	Flannel	Thanks, I will try that
2009-11-06T03:26:00.000Z	prower	Flannel	That -would- be ideal, -if- the result of reporting bugs on launchpad wasn't 90% of the time "report it upstream" :> I haven't reported one bug against 9.10 yet that was even assigned to anybody, even after having them confirmed
