2009-12-29T11:01:00.000Z	richardM		my ubuntu crashed, i had to reboot from a CD, can read the file system, but because I am not logged on with my username etc I dont have permission to read the files, any ideas?
2009-12-29T11:02:00.000Z	kheera	richardM	there is probably some mount trick that will get that file system opened up so you can access it...
2009-12-29T11:02:00.000Z	kheera	richardM	also make sure you are tryign to read the files as root... sudo ls, sudo cd, etc...
2009-12-29T11:04:00.000Z	richardM	kheera	i am just logged on straight from the CD, and am reading the file system via the desktop etc
