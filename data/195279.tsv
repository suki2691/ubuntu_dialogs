2006-08-27T06:14:00.000Z	Dirtycash		Can i "sudo apt-get"  The opera Web browser?  My Firefox keeps crashing
2006-08-27T06:15:00.000Z	Dirtycash		I have it working now (Opera ) but it is from a file folder on my desktop :P
2006-08-27T06:16:00.000Z	Dirtycash		I have the file downloaded and it works but it only works from the downloaded folder
2006-08-27T06:16:00.000Z	SpComb	Dirtycash	you can use `apt-cache search opera | less` to see if it exists (I don't know if it does)
