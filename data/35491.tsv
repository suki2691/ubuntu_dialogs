2011-03-10T03:30:00.000Z	geoff918		I'm having a problem with a program attempting to use sound. It is addressing /dev/dsp; I think I can get around the issue by symlinking to that from the usual Ubuntu address for sound hardware. However, I don't know what that is. Does anybody know what the standard address for sound hardware is in Ubuntu? (10.10)
