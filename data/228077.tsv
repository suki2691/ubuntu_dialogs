2008-04-27T14:05:00.000Z	cking37		im having problems playing java games (ex: pogo.com) since updating to hardy.  is that due to the beta version of firefox it shipped with, or the newer java? and if so, where can i get the older ones?
2008-04-27T14:06:00.000Z	cking37		it says firefox2, but it says its 3beta5 when i go to 'about'

2008-04-27T14:08:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	cking37	I'm a little nudged by it... but I assume the official release for 3.0 will be out soon
