2012-01-30T05:28:00.000Z	hillshum		Windows 7 (32-bit) on this machine sees 4GB of RAM, as does the BIOS. Ubuntu (32-bit) sees 2.7GB. Do I need to be using 64-bit Ubuntu?
2012-01-30T05:29:00.000Z	OerHeks	hillshum	you could try 64 bit, or install the PAE kernel wich can use/see more than 4 gb
2012-01-30T05:30:00.000Z	hillshum	OerHeks	I'll try 64bit, but 32 should see a full 4GB right?
2012-01-30T05:30:00.000Z	OerHeks	hillshum	4 gb memory, including video memory, pci memory etc etc
