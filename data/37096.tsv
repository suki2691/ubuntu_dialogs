2011-05-24T09:25:00.000Z	skuzzel		I'm trying to have my 1 tb hard drive set up so that I can run ubuntu from it like a live CD but I can also use it to swap and store files, what is the best way to do this?
2011-05-24T09:26:00.000Z	skuzzel		I guess a better question would be, I have my external hard drive set up like a USB ubuntu install stick, can I boot to this ubuntu version and then put files onto my external hard drive?
2011-05-24T09:27:00.000Z	celthunder	skuzzel	? how did you mount the drive?
2011-05-24T09:27:00.000Z	skuzzel	celthunder	I'm not sure that I really did mount the drive
