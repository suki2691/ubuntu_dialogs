2007-01-30T08:09:00.000Z	DCR		Hello, I'm on ubuntu right now, but the screen resolution is horrible, and I can't change it on preferences, there is no drop down menu, somebody told to go to the xorg.conf but I don't know what to change, what do I have to change?
2007-01-30T08:10:00.000Z	DCR		Where do I type that? Sorry it's my first time
2007-01-30T08:12:00.000Z	DCR		Sorry, but how do you open a "sudo session?"
