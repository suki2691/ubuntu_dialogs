2006-01-09T17:03:00.000Z	xst		Are there any way I can boot a ubuntu HD-installation in runlevel 1, if I do not have the root-password?
2006-01-09T17:03:00.000Z	kemik	xst	 there is no root passwd in ubuntu
2006-01-09T17:04:00.000Z	kemik	xst	 unless you yourself enabled the root acct
2006-01-09T17:05:00.000Z	kemik	xst	 boot in "safe mode" think that gives you root aswell
