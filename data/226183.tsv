2007-02-23T16:27:00.000Z	Arafangion		Does the ubuntu installer allow me to resize my disk?
2007-02-23T16:27:00.000Z	Arafangion		My disk partitions that is.  They're in fat32, I'm guessing that it will be better to convert them to NTFS *after* resizing?

2007-02-23T16:28:00.000Z	Arafangion	blaze	Thanks.  Had to wipe my system and reinstall windows just to play ONE crap game (for uni) :(
