2008-12-18T02:03:00.000Z	gaminggeek	onetinsoldier	yea thats fine but what about when the install is finished and I need to boot my computer?
2008-12-18T02:04:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	gaminggeek	hard to say what will happen then. it does try to automatically go into the graphical environment(x-windows). one sec here...
