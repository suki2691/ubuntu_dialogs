2005-02-02T09:20:00.000Z	zido		does ubuntu come with a program for burning CDs?
2005-02-02T09:22:00.000Z	Guardiann	zido	or get k3b
2005-02-02T09:33:00.000Z	zido	Guardiann	i installed k3b, when i start it i get about 1-2 pages of warnings before it launches :P
2005-02-02T09:37:00.000Z	zido	Guardiann	might be because i'm not running KDE, so it can't find ALOT of files in a nonexsisting KDE folder in my homedirectory :P
