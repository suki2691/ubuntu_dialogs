2008-10-29T18:18:00.000Z	Guiri		Can someone tell me how to burn an .img to a hard disk? I'm trying to install FreeNAS on another disk for another computer. It's an .img file.

2008-10-29T18:20:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Guiri	a .img is normally a raw disk image; it can be dumped to a harddisk using zcat and dd
