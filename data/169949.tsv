2007-08-03T14:32:00.000Z	asdf	macogw	I am using it, but I would like to stop using it and use nm-applet -- do you know how I can do this?
2007-08-03T14:33:00.000Z	macogw	asdf	set the system > networking to "roaming" then dont touch it anymore and nm-applet should be able to do it.  a kill X may be required in between
