2007-09-23T14:03:00.000Z	magnetron	Marshal1	check your caps lock mode
2007-09-23T14:04:00.000Z	Marshal1	magnetron	The caps lock isn't on
2007-09-23T14:07:00.000Z	Marshal1	magnetron	I have even used passwd to reset the password just to propagate the password around to make sure it didn't scramble anything
