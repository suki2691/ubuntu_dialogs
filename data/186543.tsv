2012-02-04T04:15:00.000Z	Worre		Is there any way to change partition's type without data loss?
2012-02-04T04:15:00.000Z	ikonia	Worre	what do you mean change the type ?
2012-02-04T04:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Worre	no, that's a file system type - not a partition type (just for future reference)
2012-02-04T04:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Worre	it's not a problem, you'll just get better responses if you use the right terms
