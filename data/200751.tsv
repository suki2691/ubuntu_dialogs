2006-01-17T15:19:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		Hmm, what's a fair decent, preferably multi-network, at least Genutlla2 and Donkey, and BitTorrent client for Linux?
2006-01-17T15:21:00.000Z	hypa7ia	Psi-Jack	i like bittornado for bittorrent
2006-01-17T15:22:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	hypa7ia	Yeah, but I'd like a client that combines BT, G2, and eDonkey together. MLdonkey does it, but... So far, MLDonkey has been sucking to the extreme.
