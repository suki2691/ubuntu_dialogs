2005-10-18T05:23:00.000Z	Kira	M4ximus	it shouldn't be too hard to just download the source for lame and make. o.o
2005-10-18T05:24:00.000Z	M4ximus	Kira	was wondering if it was something already on apt-get
2005-10-18T05:24:00.000Z	Kira	M4ximus	I doubt it. MP3 technology involves patent issues, I believe.
