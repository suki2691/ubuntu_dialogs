2007-10-24T19:48:00.000Z	DeFirence		can anyone here help me make a cron job check if a daemon has stopped and if so, restart it?
2007-10-24T19:48:00.000Z	KNY	DeFirence	basically have a script check if `ps -A | grep daemonName` is null and, if so, restart the daemon
2007-10-24T19:49:00.000Z	DeFirence	KNY	but how do i make it check at certain intervals? i mean atm it only has start, stop and restart functions
