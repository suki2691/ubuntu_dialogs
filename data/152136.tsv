2007-04-13T08:18:00.000Z	Cara_WCAM_MSN		i know
2007-04-13T08:18:00.000Z	Cara_WCAM_MSN		i am trying for a few days opera, and it's really faster and superior, now it's got a new feature, speed dial it's so cool
2007-04-13T08:19:00.000Z	xtknight	Cara_WCAM_MSN	unfortunately, i don't believe that they will ever make opera the default because: a) it is not open source, b) many people like firefoxs
