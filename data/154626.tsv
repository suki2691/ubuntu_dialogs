2006-12-12T15:19:00.000Z	stazi	Catshrimp	i think there is a package to make OOo use gnome's theming
2006-12-12T15:19:00.000Z	Catshrimp	stazi	Yeah, I see the gnome package.  But what if I'm just running fluxbox?
2006-12-12T15:20:00.000Z	stazi	Catshrimp	not gnome itself, there is an OOo gnome theme package iirc
