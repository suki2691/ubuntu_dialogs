2009-01-18T15:07:00.000Z	iJoh		can anyone help me activate my swap partition? I have no idea why it won't work
2009-01-18T15:08:00.000Z	jaem	iJoh	have you tried swapon /dev/whatever-its-called ?
2009-01-18T15:08:00.000Z	jaem		that should do it temporarily
2009-01-18T15:09:00.000Z	iJoh	jaem	swapon -a would activate all swap partitions, won't it?
