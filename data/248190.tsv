2007-02-25T17:54:00.000Z	tenco	ompaul	jep. but i dont know all packagenames yet. are there any ways to find them automagically?
2007-02-25T17:54:00.000Z	ompaul	tenco	ls /var/cache/apt/archives <<<  in there - but it still does not remove the packages you have config files in your home dir
2007-02-25T17:55:00.000Z	ompaul	tenco	apt-get or that cut down version aptitude is magic - just not a miracle worker :)
