2007-12-15T05:14:00.000Z	dylan_		Hi, all.  I'm wondering, is there an easy solution to setting up a LAMP-type web server on Ubuntu 7.10 desktop through synaptic, etc.?  If not, what's the simplest way to get a phpmyadmin, mysql, php, apache server set up?  Security is NOT important, its for personal site testing on my LAN.
