2007-12-07T19:43:00.000Z	Twinkletoes		My kernel after install on VMware is (-generic).  My CPU is Interl Core(TM)2, so should I be using -386 or x86/64 kernel?
2007-12-07T19:44:00.000Z	EdgEy	Twinkletoes	386 is x86
2007-12-07T19:44:00.000Z	EdgEy		64bit is awkward atm if you neeed to use things like flash plugin, wine etc i would not recommend it
2007-12-07T19:44:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	EdgEy	SO should I move away from the -generic kernel and get all the -386 stuff?
