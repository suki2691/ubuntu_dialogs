2005-09-10T10:17:00.000Z	Lordphyn		Can anyone point me to a good Samba troubleshooting guide?--I'm getting a timeout error
2005-09-10T10:17:00.000Z	bob2	Lordphyn	that doesn't sound like a samba problem at all
2005-09-10T10:18:00.000Z	Lordphyn	bob2	hmm, I can ssh to the machine fine - though I was messing with some tunnelling stuff before, dont quite remember what I did?
2005-09-10T10:18:00.000Z	bob2	Lordphyn	well, there you go
