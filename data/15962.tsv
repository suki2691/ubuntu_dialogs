2012-10-11T05:29:00.000Z	J11		i want to move my root partition together with my /home partition which is on another disk. Any way how I can do this?
2012-10-11T05:31:00.000Z	Juv1228	J11	boot into a livecd and manually move the files
2012-10-11T05:32:00.000Z	J11	Juv1228	so I take I won't get permisison problems when moving files from / to another partition?
2012-10-11T05:35:00.000Z	Juv1228	J11	you might be better off using --preserve=all
