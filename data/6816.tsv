2011-12-27T05:26:00.000Z	Disori		Guys, I may be overlooking something simple, but I'm pretty sure that Ubuntu doesn't recognise my webcam as a microphone/video device. Is there any easy way to make it so it does?

2011-12-27T05:28:00.000Z	metaspike		doesn't ubuntu come with aptitude by default?
2011-12-27T05:29:00.000Z	Disori	metaspike	: It knows its a camera. I just need to know how to tell ubuntu it's also a microphone. Almoxarife, I think I've got it. Lemme test it out now
