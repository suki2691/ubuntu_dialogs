2011-01-09T04:50:00.000Z	NixGeek		is there any big risk to extending my extended partition to 150gb?
2011-01-09T04:50:00.000Z	NixGeek		actually, to adding 150gb onto my extended partition to make it about 211GB?

2011-01-09T04:53:00.000Z	NixGeek	rusty149	all that's on it is my home partition, and i'll make a complete backup using rsync to another partition before I modiy it.  I've resized ubuntu partitions before and kept ubuntu wokring, but never an extended partition, so I just needed to know wether there was any extra risk.  Thank you
