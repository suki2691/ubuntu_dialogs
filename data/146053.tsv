2007-02-24T16:51:00.000Z	wkdown		how do I move data from an hda partition to my hdb?
2007-02-24T16:53:00.000Z	xenoborg	wkdown	what's the point?
2007-02-24T16:53:00.000Z	wkdown	xenoborg	I am installing a different Linux and don't want to lose my data when I repartition
2007-02-24T16:54:00.000Z	xenoborg	wkdown	then you should be fine
