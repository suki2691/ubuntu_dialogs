2010-02-16T03:10:00.000Z	m_tadeu		hi all....my ubuntu reboots in random situations....how can I start checking what the problem is?
2010-02-16T03:11:00.000Z	hyperstream	m_tadeu	is it a proper reboot, or just restarts instantly? (crash)
2010-02-16T03:11:00.000Z	m_tadeu	hyperstream	just retarts instantly....no shutdown process
2010-02-16T03:13:00.000Z	hyperstream	m_tadeu	almost sounds like it could be a possible hardware issue, id start with the logs in /var/log
