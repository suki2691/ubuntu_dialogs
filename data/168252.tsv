2008-06-16T03:10:00.000Z	shinynew		so I installed ubuntu 8.10 on my laptop (F572US) and for some reason I can't acess any of my virtual consoles (ctrl+alt+F1,2,3 etc) would anyone point me in the direction of fixing this?
2008-06-16T03:11:00.000Z	shinynew		get the super grub CD and restore the windows start up
2008-06-16T03:12:00.000Z	avis	shinynew	super grub cd can create a MBR for windows ?  i know someone that might try ubuntu, though he wont do it unless he can restore things to how they were
2008-06-16T03:12:00.000Z	shinynew	avis	well it did it for me
