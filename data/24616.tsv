2012-04-11T03:25:00.000Z	Tynach	bhermz	have you changed display managers? Like using KDM instead of GDM or LightDM?
2012-04-11T03:27:00.000Z	Tynach	bhermz	have you installed any server software lately?
2012-04-11T03:28:00.000Z	Tynach	bhermz	I have no idea. I'm pulling at straws here. But it might be worth checking out - did you install from the repositories, or some other way?
