2006-12-03T08:51:00.000Z	jack|ass		is it going to run properly, just in 32-bit mode?   Or am I better off staying with 32-bit kernel if that's what the majority of my applications run in?

2006-12-03T08:52:00.000Z	jack|ass	nolimitsoya	heh.  I've just gotg an AMD64 that never gets run out of 32-bit mode. :)  But i'm not using more than 3 gigs of memory so...
