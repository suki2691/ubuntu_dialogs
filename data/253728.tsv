2008-11-27T00:15:00.000Z	gwennn		hello! I have a strange issue...I have a small vista partition(just in case...)I can only login in vista ONLY with the same keyboard. It don't recognise no other one  :(
2008-11-27T00:16:00.000Z	quiet	gwennn	this sounds like a vista problem, not a ubuntu problem?
2008-11-27T00:19:00.000Z	quiet	gwennn	that's not surprising. You shouldn't. You really hsouldn't in Vista either. The keyboard is the most basic, standard input device for a computer. Is it a USB keyboard or PS/2?
2008-11-27T00:20:00.000Z	quiet	gwennn	and you plugged in another usb keyboard and it didn't work in vista, but works in ubuntu?
