2010-01-10T10:35:00.000Z	taofd		anyone know why i might be getting a Permission denied (publickey) error message when trying to ssh-copy-id?

2010-01-10T10:38:00.000Z	taofd	wweasel	what i don't understand is what part have i not configured correctly... i configured two systems together and tried to pair them up, one system worked, while the other didn't
