2009-01-11T07:02:00.000Z	mdg		I have to reset my smb password after every few times I connect.  (Ubuntu 8.10).  Any one ever have this issue?
2009-01-11T07:04:00.000Z	butt3rz	mdg	i think that samba disconnects after a short period of time if not used by default
2009-01-11T07:07:00.000Z	mdg	butt3rz	I'm ok with a disconnect, but it takes an smbpasswd everytime.  I'll look at the smb.conf to see if there is anything about a timeout.
2009-01-11T07:08:00.000Z	butt3rz	mdg	man smbpasswd
