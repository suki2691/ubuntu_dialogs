2006-07-05T16:57:00.000Z	azcazandco		I have a question regarding my video card
2006-07-05T16:58:00.000Z	azcazandco		my display resolution says it is at 1280x1024 (or whatever it is...) but it still looks like I am on 1024x768
2006-07-05T16:59:00.000Z	Tmob	azcazandco	where did you see what your display resolution was?
2006-07-05T05:01:00.000Z	Tmob	azcazandco	you can try making the fonts a bit smaller. i do that with my laptop which only goes upto 1024x768
