2007-02-12T16:37:00.000Z	tom__	bytekode	i think if there is lots of unoccupied space around it... i don't know, i haven't used NTFS partitions in a long time.

2007-02-12T16:38:00.000Z	tom__	bytekode	and he wants to save all his music, etc.... if the drive is completely NTFS, you're going to need a drive to back stuff up to on.
