2011-05-02T20:26:00.000Z	Dcite	Mali	unetbootin should be close to what is needed?
2011-05-02T20:28:00.000Z	Dcite	Mali	Do you have yaourt installed or access to auR.archlinux.org? They have a pkgbuild for unetbootin there.
2011-05-02T20:28:00.000Z	Dcite	Mali	It... won't see the stick? Can't you pick by device in /dev? Or nothing at all?
