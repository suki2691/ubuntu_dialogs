2007-08-15T12:05:00.000Z	joris_		I have a rather odd feisty problem. Machine with a core2quad cpu with a 2.6.20-16-generic kernel works very fast, altough with only 3.2 out of 8GB of ram. Installing the 2.6.20-16-server kernel halves disk IO speed (measurably) and subjectively decimates CPU performance... I'm at a complete loss

2007-08-15T12:08:00.000Z	joris_	n2diy	hmm, good hint :)
