2012-05-27T16:14:00.000Z	cornholio		whenever I try to use service in the SSH session,  I get "-sh: service: command not found"  it seems I can not do anything with the service command
2012-05-27T16:15:00.000Z	cornholio		I'm logged on as root
2012-05-27T16:15:00.000Z	jrib	cornholio	does it work outside of ssh?  How and why are you root?
