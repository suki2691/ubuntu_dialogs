2004-10-08T12:04:00.000Z	tezem		Is ubuntu directly connected to the debian package db?
2004-10-08T12:04:00.000Z	Kamion	tezem	not as far as users are concerned, but we do pull updated packages from Debian
2004-10-08T12:07:00.000Z	tezem	Kamion	Is a source based package management as a feature to the normal deb packages planned or possible to come in future?
