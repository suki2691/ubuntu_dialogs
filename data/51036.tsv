2009-08-08T06:06:00.000Z	RavenShadow		Stupid mIRC went down on me, so I don't know if anyone actually answered my question, so I'll re-ask. I'm trying to install Ubuntu 9.04 from a USB drive, but during the boot process, I get usb 1-7: device not accepting address 11, error -110....is there any way to fix this, so that I can do the install?
