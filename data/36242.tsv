2010-03-04T22:28:00.000Z	Stargaze	RHKratos	try System > Administration > System orMonit
2010-03-04T22:28:00.000Z	Stargaze	RHKratos	try System > Administration > System Monitor
2010-03-04T22:33:00.000Z	RHKratos	Stargaze	that doesn't tell me what flags (if any) the application was started with, which is one of the things I would like to know
