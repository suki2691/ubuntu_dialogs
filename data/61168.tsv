2009-03-31T23:20:00.000Z	eqisow	jpverkamp	are you using desktop effects? If so, does it do it without them?
2009-03-31T23:24:00.000Z	eqisow	jpverkamp	I suggest trying the nv drivers. if that fixes we'll know if a different version of the nvidia drivers might help. Or, if you don't need 3D, you could just stick with them
2009-03-31T23:25:00.000Z	jpverkamp	eqisow	I'd like 3D, but it's not strictly necessary.  I'll give it a try.
