2012-09-26T00:17:00.000Z	Advocated	bekks	lol, how can i work it out, ie 200gb / whatever kbps = how many hours? or what kinda speed would I need to run it at to do it in say 8 hours?
2012-09-26T00:19:00.000Z	bekks	Advocated	200GB = 200*1024*1024 MB = 200*(1024^4) Byte = 8*200*(1024^4) Bit ...
2012-09-26T00:19:00.000Z	bekks	Advocated	And 128 kBps = 128*1024 Bit per second.
