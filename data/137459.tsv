2007-04-21T12:23:00.000Z	zbus		Hello. I was wondering if someone could help me setup syntax highligthing with vim ... I have just installed ubuntu 6.10 and when I type 'vi' it reports 7.0.35. I uncommented the line in /etc/vim/vimrc 'syntax on' but now vi complains that the syntax command is not available in this version. Any ideas?
