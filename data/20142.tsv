2011-04-15T19:09:00.000Z	AlecTaylor		I'm running Ubuntu 10.10 x86, and have just downloaded a package from debian.org. How do I download all of its dependencies automatically?
2011-04-15T19:10:00.000Z	TimR	AlecTaylor	I think GDebi will take care of that for you
2011-04-15T19:11:00.000Z	TimR	AlecTaylor	assuming, of course, that the deps are available in the ubuntu repos
2011-04-15T19:11:00.000Z	AlecTaylor	TimR	I get an error when I double click on it: "Dependency is not satisfiable: libgcrypt 11 (>= 1.4.6)"
