2008-08-21T20:50:00.000Z	Absorto		so I have a (pretty cool) machine that has 32Gb of RAM. I just installed ubuntu-server and it only detects 4Gb. Why?
2008-08-21T20:51:00.000Z	Absorto		I'm not. I intalled 64 bit version.
2008-08-21T20:51:00.000Z	jmichelsen	Absorto	you have to use 64bit server version
2008-08-21T20:52:00.000Z	jmichelsen	Absorto	that means its 32b version for 64bit cpu
