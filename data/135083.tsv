2007-05-24T05:48:00.000Z	ziroda1	The_Ball	ubuntu is the best
2007-05-24T05:48:00.000Z	The_Ball		one question though. the pc hasn't got a sound card, so the media player starts but exits complaining about the totem server. isn't it possible to run without sound?
2007-05-24T05:48:00.000Z	The_Ball	ziroda1	i'll ignore that
