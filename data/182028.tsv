2008-02-20T21:13:00.000Z	luisa	Ace_NoOne	why not NTFS?
2008-02-20T21:14:00.000Z	Ace_NoOne	brobostigon	/ luisa: I remember there used to be issues with NTFS under Linux - not anymore?
2008-02-20T21:14:00.000Z	luisa	Ace_NoOne	not anymore... atleast I haven't had any. I don't need to, but I use NTFS on my USB drive.. write to it, FTP to it... never had a problem :)
