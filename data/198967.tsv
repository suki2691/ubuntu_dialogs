2007-07-08T10:17:00.000Z	Frogzoo		can anyone suggest a way to calculate julian dates? you can use oobase, but I'd like something cli
2007-07-08T10:18:00.000Z	Frogzoo		ncal will show the julian dates actually, but I'd like to calculate number of days between 2 dates, from the terminal
2007-07-08T10:18:00.000Z	MajorPayne	Frogzoo	Try cal on the cli.
2007-07-10T12:29:00.000Z	Frogzoo	MajorPayne	nope - vi is the admin standard pretty much
