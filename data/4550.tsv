2012-03-18T22:36:00.000Z	pmp6nl		Hello all, I have two computers and one backup hard drive.  What is the best way to sync files between all of them.  Im looking for a GUI (maybe based on rsync?)

2012-03-18T22:39:00.000Z	pmp6nl	unixbeardxd|	and MestreLion will rsync keep everything synced even if something is uploaded to one or the other, will it consolidate changes?
