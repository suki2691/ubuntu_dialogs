Been reading the man pages to see why, and since it's on the fly encryption, it would seem this should not be. In the disk analyzer it appears in the home directory ecryptfs has duplicated my home directory, but it's copy is actually larger than the original. That seems strange. Am I just looking at this wrong?

2011-05-02T05:03:00.000Z	jukebox-zero	escott	that's what I was hoping to hear. Thanks.
