2011-08-04T07:51:00.000Z	WallyJ2K	Dude22	in recovery mode it still gave me the opportunity to login as the user I created
2011-08-04T07:51:00.000Z	WallyJ2K		I haven't used the root user since I started troubleshooting my regular boot issue
2011-08-04T07:52:00.000Z	Dude22	WallyJ2K	Ahh... difference between recovery and rescue.  Have you tried your own password  for root pwd?
