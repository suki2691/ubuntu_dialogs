2008-09-03T11:20:00.000Z	Dragonlaw		im still alittle confused because there's only 9gb being used in home and i don't think there is that much space being taken up
2008-09-03T11:21:00.000Z	Dragonlaw		im not sure how to clear up the space because i dunno what is taking up the space
2008-09-03T11:21:00.000Z	inkynoob	Dragonlaw	: Have you tried baobab? It'll show you where the space is being used at graphically
