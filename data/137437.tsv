2007-05-03T13:27:00.000Z	database		I installed a minimal Ubuntu Dapper install in order to upgrade to Feisty.
2007-05-03T13:27:00.000Z	database		Is there a metapackage I can install to do this?
2007-05-03T13:28:00.000Z	database		(If not, what is the command to do a "dist-upgrade" (or similar) in a console?)
2007-05-03T13:28:00.000Z	sashimi	database	I'd say it is much weiser starting again from scratch rather than "upgrading"
