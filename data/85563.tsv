I have this external DVD Drive that I am using via eSATA, now it has an external power supply and I forget sometimes to turn it on before I boot up my laptop. I was wondering if there is a function that would detect the drive after I boot up, sort of like Device Manager in Windows, when you click "Scan for Hardware Changes"
