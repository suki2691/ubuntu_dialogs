2008-05-16T19:15:00.000Z	ziod		why am I getting a 'mount error: could not find target server' when I attempt a cifs mount of a directory on my win32 machine?  I can access the directory fine through network places and it shows up fine when I do a smbclient -L listing of shared directories.  I've followed the directions at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ComprehensiveSambaGuide?highlight=(samba).  Help!
