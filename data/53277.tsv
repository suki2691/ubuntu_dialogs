2009-07-02T13:15:00.000Z	Cosmo1		I am having a problem one is that my keyboard layout keeps changing from dvorak back to qwerty even though I have removed the qwerty layout and it seems at random times it goes back to qwerty and I have to run setxkbmap dvorak in a launcher. How do I fix this?

2009-07-02T13:16:00.000Z	Cosmo1	Slemming	not that I know of, and it keeps doing it at random times
2009-07-02T13:16:00.000Z	Slemming	Cosmo1	Are you positive it's random?
