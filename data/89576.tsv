2008-06-14T22:18:00.000Z	Timi		Question, What works better with Ubuntu, an iPod, or a Zune? (does the zune work at all?)
2008-06-14T22:18:00.000Z	BCM43	Timi	both work fine
2008-06-14T22:19:00.000Z	Timi	BCM43	no annoying complications such as emulating xp? Also, is there any necessary extra software, or can I drag and drop?
2008-06-14T22:20:00.000Z	BCM43	Timi	ipod is easier, just use amorak, i think the zune is harder
