2010-05-19T08:37:00.000Z	RedXIII|Laptop		I have this mp4 video file that I recovered off a dying drive using ddrescue. Its heavily fragmented and I'm sure has SOME video data in it
2010-05-19T08:37:00.000Z	RedXIII|Laptop		however VLC / Titan won't recognize it
2010-05-19T08:37:00.000Z	RedXIII|Laptop		Is there software that I can use to recover small fragments of the file?
