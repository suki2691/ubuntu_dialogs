2007-04-20T15:15:00.000Z	gustavo		hi! how do i prevent kernel panic happening when compiling a kernel?
2007-04-20T15:15:00.000Z	Thor	gustavo	that should not happen, basically.
2007-04-20T15:16:00.000Z	Thor	gustavo	I guess something's awry in your currently running kernel, but I doubt it's related to compiling the new kernel.
2007-04-20T15:17:00.000Z	gustavo	Thor	ive compiled a kernel, but it does not boot, because of kernel panic...
