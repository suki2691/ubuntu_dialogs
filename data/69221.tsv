2010-01-19T02:00:00.000Z	oCean_	rasmus_	you changed themes in prior versions? It's still in system > pref > appearance
2010-01-19T02:01:00.000Z	oCean_	rasmus_	maybe you mean gdm theme? That's the "login" theme
2010-01-19T02:03:00.000Z	oCean_	rasmus_	there's difference in gdm theme (login screen) and your gtk+ themes
