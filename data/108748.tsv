2009-07-22T02:10:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest		Please help! It really annoying that a simple task of fstab-mounting a windows shared folder and using it is this hard... ive followed the ubuntuwiki and mounted like this:
2009-07-22T02:10:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest		//192.168.0.197/Qmultimedia  /media/QMultiMedia  cifs  guest,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8,codepage=unicode,unicode  0  0
2009-07-22T02:10:00.000Z	NorthByNorthWest		But when I drag and drop a folder with files, I get the message that I dont have the access to create new folder... but still... a folder with the name of the copied folder is created.... I have no idea of how to fix this...
