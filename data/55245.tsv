2011-03-20T03:56:00.000Z	gluonman	edbian	all I got after removing the splash screen is the following: "[     4.616230] Console: switching to colour frame buffer device \ [       4.621557] uvesafb: framebuffer at 0xfb000000, mapped to 0xffffc90011800000, using 14336k, total 14336k \ [     4.621560] fb0: VESA VGA frame buffer device"  Then it just gave me a login prompt (command-line only).  Does that give you any clue what might be wrong with my kernel?
