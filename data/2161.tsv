2012-07-02T14:38:00.000Z	Razva		the thing I wanna do is simple: give each person a way to login to their own user, on X, on the server
2012-07-02T14:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	Razva	use a different vnc server. no visible x session needed to be ran on the server
2012-07-02T14:39:00.000Z	dr_willis		ssh in. run vncserver. get own vnc desktop.
2012-07-02T14:39:00.000Z	Razva	dr_willis	ok, any recommendations? I've tried x11vnc but seems that it doesn't has no visible x session...
