2010-09-03T15:42:00.000Z	lidbjork		Ok ... another question ... where the hell is my xorg.conf? It ain't in /etc/X11
2010-09-03T15:44:00.000Z	lidbjork		I think I gotta cold reboot this darned box. Thanks all for the help!

2010-09-03T15:45:00.000Z	lidbjork	thune3	Ok. But I have no idea what to write in it. I just thought I might find some help looking at the configuration.
