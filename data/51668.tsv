2009-08-04T17:50:00.000Z	ascheel		Anybody know of any issues with having 2 wifi adapters?  Will the system handle the drivers just fine for each one?  I'm looking to replace an internal 802.11g adapter with a USB 802.11n adapter and want to make sure it's working before I yank the g adapter.  If I install an ndiswrapper for the new USB one, the old one will work just fine with the standard driver, correct?
