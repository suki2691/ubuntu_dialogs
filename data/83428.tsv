2009-08-21T10:49:00.000Z	Andorin		I downloaded gnash from the GNU site and I'm trying to install. I've not got much experience with compiling and installing from source, and when I run ./configure, part of the output is this: http://pastebin.com/m46cd25ae What I'm wondering is, do I have to install all of those in order to install gnash, and is there a way to do it all at once, or must I do them all at once?
2009-08-21T10:50:00.000Z	Andorin		Er, must I do them one at a time?
2009-08-21T10:51:00.000Z	Andorin		I see. I was hoping to have a free alternative to Adobe Flash. =x
2009-08-21T10:51:00.000Z	freeflowcauvery	Andorin	but to answer your more general question of installing dependencies one at a time, yes....unless you opt to install from *verse repositories
