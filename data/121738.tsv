2009-03-10T07:20:00.000Z	brent_	kringel	- I have a friend who has an HP with broadcom wireless, and his connection is painfully slow, but only when  using certain routers, a very strange problem.
2009-03-10T07:23:00.000Z	kringel	brent_	i found on google that many suffer from suddenly disappeared wireless devices on HP dv series and G6000 and all related. before mine was slow with feisty and gutsy, but since hardy with the new b43 it worked nearly perfectly. but now it's gone. I guess HP is aware of this. thanks anyway
