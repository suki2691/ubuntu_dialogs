2009-06-07T11:06:00.000Z	goose	Syrius	for some reason, my firefox is going _really really slowly_. I haven't capped my bandwidth, in Windows it works fine, all other applications work just fine, but FF never seems to actually load more than like, 10 KiB of a web page, and conky says that my network connection is never active downloading more than 10 KiB/sec (torrenting and IRC, I'm sure)
