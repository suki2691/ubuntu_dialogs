2011-09-27T11:56:00.000Z	fireprint	n4dsp	tutorials.. and just go at it with repetitions.. like Christopher said there. I am on my fifth day with linux and loving it like no tomorrow!
2011-09-27T11:59:00.000Z	fireprint	n4dsp	just anyone out there on google that im looking for at the moment. you were wanting to locate a file.. locate would be something you should look into "locate" either within *nix.. like "man locate" or in google to search for "how to locate a file with ubuntu" just dig into it. Any question you type here, might as well be directly pasted into google for a great reading usually!
