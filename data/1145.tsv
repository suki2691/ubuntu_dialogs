2012-09-14T02:30:00.000Z	lorddelta		Greetings, I've just temporarily recovered from an internet outage problem. I don't know what cause the issue, but I suspect it has something to do with dnsmasq and bad configuration scripts. I'm leaving soon, but if anyone might know of a solution I can look into...I'll try updating packages etc obviously, but my solution involved passing a parameter by hand to dnsmasq inorder to get nslookup to work correctly. =/

2012-09-14T02:31:00.000Z	lorddelta		Guess I'll come back later
