2011-10-20T17:10:00.000Z	RedNifre		Is it possible to set the home folder as my desktop folder? Ticking "desktop_is_home_dir" in gconf-edit doesn't work in Unity :/
2011-10-20T17:11:00.000Z	ThinkT510	RedNifre	why would you want to do that?
2011-10-20T17:11:00.000Z	RedNifre	ThinkT510	it's my experience that having the desktop show the content of my home directory is more useful for me.
