2010-10-19T09:21:00.000Z	rww	King_Troopa	It's not. The increments you have are a property of your CPU.
2010-10-19T09:21:00.000Z	King_Troopa	rww	the windows 7 installation can do 100 different increments... so how can that be true?
2010-10-19T09:22:00.000Z	rww	King_Troopa	As far as I know, there's no CPU that can step in speed to 100 different increments. Unless there's something going on I'm not familiar with, I'd guess most of those don't do much.
