2011-09-21T14:28:00.000Z	bilygates		damn, there should be a "take ownership of this file" in nautilus which brings up a gksudo :/
2011-09-21T14:29:00.000Z	llutz	bilygates	no there shouldn't. it would make things even worse
2011-09-21T14:29:00.000Z	llutz	bilygates	"chown/chmod" as the 1st thing to do on problem causes most likely even more problems
