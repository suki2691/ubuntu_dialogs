2007-01-15T08:12:00.000Z	YokoZar		Is there a way to test an Ubuntu CD without booting it?
2007-01-15T08:12:00.000Z	Flannel	YokoZar	there's a CD check on the CD
2007-01-15T08:13:00.000Z	YokoZar	Flannel	Is it a script I can run though?  I need to figure out if my CD is bad or if my drive is bad (booting it is giving errors)
2007-01-15T08:13:00.000Z	Flannel	YokoZar	I... guess you could compare bits.  but no, not that I know of
