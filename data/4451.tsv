2012-04-07T03:21:00.000Z	KM0201	mirko1	nobody says he has to come here for user support... he could be coming here just to "eavesdrop" (on the ops, etc..)... i bet he's here and we don't know about it sometimes
2012-04-07T03:25:00.000Z	mirko1	KM0201	same sort of wish-thinking that's behing "hey, I bet my local governor listens to this channel" :-) get rif of that one-person thinking. mark is not linux. he even isn't ubuntu :-)
2012-04-07T03:25:00.000Z	KM0201	mirko1	i never suggest he was.. i think you're overthinking my comment
