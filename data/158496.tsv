2007-02-16T12:00:00.000Z	RyconPayne		I'm having a white screen on login to Xgl/Beryl.  I have an ATI 9800 w/ the ATI drivers installed.  It's a fresh install of ubuntu, the only thing done to it is the ATI drivers, and Beryl installed
2007-02-16T12:00:00.000Z	RyconPayne		 I've found many, many people having this problem, but I haven't found a working solution. I was hoping that people here would have more insight.
2007-02-16T12:00:00.000Z	Slart	RyconPayne	have you tried the #winehq channel?
2007-02-16T12:01:00.000Z	Slart	RyconPayne	eh.. sorry.. the #beryl channel
