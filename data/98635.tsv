2008-03-30T21:21:00.000Z	Roooty		Hi, how do I get Gnome / Ubuntu to display funny characters (like German ones)?
2008-03-30T21:22:00.000Z	therethinker	Roooty	It doesn't already? Which chars?
2008-03-30T21:23:00.000Z	Roooty	therethinker	letter u with two dots, paragraph signs, a few others too
2008-03-30T21:25:00.000Z	Roooty	therethinker	I just reinstalled Ubuntu, I think that about a year ago I installed a font package which showed all that good stuff for me, problem is, I don't know which package it was, if that was what I did
