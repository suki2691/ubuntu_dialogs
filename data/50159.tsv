2009-08-18T18:59:00.000Z	Giddorah		Sigh... Why isn't Ubuntu working?
2009-08-18T18:59:00.000Z	Giddorah		I mean... All other os'es work, just not Ubuntu
2009-08-18T19:00:00.000Z	MsMaco	Giddorah	youre gonna need to be a bit more specific than "doesn't work"
2009-08-18T19:01:00.000Z	Giddorah	MsMaco	I've been here since last night trying to get my installation to work, but it just simply will not install grub.
