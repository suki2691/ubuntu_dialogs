2005-02-20T13:15:00.000Z	dbt`veritas		I'm trying to install the nvidia drivers. I changed the x86free-4 config file. I go reboot(of course x doesn't work b/c the cfg is changed and i need to install the nvida drivers) but now I can't login to root. My root password doesn't seem to work and I can't change hte files back b/c  Ican't login to root. Any suggestions?
