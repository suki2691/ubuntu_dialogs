2005-12-17T07:20:00.000Z	Sysace		guys.. I just installed the ATI Proprietary drivers from the ati website, toshiba laptop (P4 3GHz, 512MB), Ati Mobility Radeon 9000.  Before the ati drivers I was getting 640fps from glxgears, now I'm getting 150fps.. can anybody please help or advise?

2005-12-17T07:20:00.000Z	Sysace	bcl	 anything I can do to get better frame rates otherwise?
2005-12-17T07:21:00.000Z	bcl	Sysace	I haven't bothered to even try.
