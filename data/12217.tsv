As it seems odd, that you can have a perfect Amiga Emulator (motorola processor), Commodore Emulator (forgot the chip here), Amstrad (definately x86), etc ... if those emulators run fine in Linux and their software doesn't go "wtf man, what is this", then why does wine have that problem. I'll accept that issue however. if that is case no matter what.
2012-03-04T23:37:00.000Z	zykotick9	hypershock	emulators are typically built for x86 hardware and require those system calls, changing the underlying achitecture is a HUGE deal.
