2008-04-09T09:44:00.000Z	Shadow420	Randocal	ubuntu can use the Nvidia and ATI Restricted drivers they are more easier to use
2008-04-09T09:45:00.000Z	Shadow420	Randocal	due to the copyrights perfectly making a free version of a high card is hard
2008-04-09T09:47:00.000Z	Shadow420	Randocal	well I never used it because I have an older Nvidia Card
