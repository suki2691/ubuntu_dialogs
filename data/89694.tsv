2008-10-28T02:37:00.000Z	DaveKong	dr_willis	Know how to go about it or a link to where I can find out?
2008-10-28T02:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	DaveKong	 depends on the disrtos and what you want to do..  read up on that syslinux/sysiso tools for configuring a boot loader to load different disrtos, then ya gotta build the iso properly with the proper files.. Its not a 'a few clicks and its done' sort of task
