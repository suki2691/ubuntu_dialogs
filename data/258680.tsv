2005-01-13T07:34:00.000Z	Minitwistor		is this the right place for a newbie?
2005-01-13T07:36:00.000Z	Minitwistor		a very simple one: i ordered my ubuntu livecds yesterday (i live in the uk), and couldn't understand the faq regarding when they will get here... but i also wanted to know about minimum hardware specs which i couldn't find in the faq either
2005-01-13T07:37:00.000Z	Minitwistor		i have a PII 233 with 32 MHz of RAM... I take it GNOME is far too heavy a desktop to run on that, so Ubuntu isn't really what I'm looking for?
