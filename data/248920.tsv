2006-04-26T11:37:00.000Z	hyphenated	calamari	can you put the error from dmesg into a pastebin?
2006-04-26T11:37:00.000Z	calamari	hyphenated	it seems that dd_rescue broke out of it.. it's still slow but at least I'm seeing error messages that increment
2006-04-26T11:38:00.000Z	hyphenated	calamari	yah, it takes forever when it hits a bad spot in a disc
