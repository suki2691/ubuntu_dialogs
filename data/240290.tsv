2008-04-26T10:26:00.000Z	milly1234		8.04 has been the most problamatic release I've installed in a long while.... especially when it came to wireless internet and video
2008-04-26T10:28:00.000Z	milly1234		I just hope to see some updates coming out soon, i have not seen a single one since I upgraded to 8.04, but then again I guess I am being impatient
2008-04-26T10:29:00.000Z	nickrud	milly1234	heh. I hope to see few, that means it's a clean release :)
