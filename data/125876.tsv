2008-03-16T09:25:00.000Z	rashind	frootloop	I recommend alberto milone's Envy script.  It's not official ubuntu-supported, but I've used it with great success with nVidia cards, and he's recently added ATi installation support.

There are some ways to go wrong.  Just make sure to follow the program's instructions, and remember it's warning about uninstalling the drivers before a kernel update.
