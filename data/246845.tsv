2007-12-19T04:29:00.000Z	DrKeith		I really want to install Ubuntu, but I'm not the only one who uses this computer so I'd like to keep windows on here.  Would it be easier to make a dual boot, or a virtual ubuntu machine?  Does ubuntu even support a virtual machine inside windows?
2007-12-19T04:31:00.000Z	DrKeith		well I'd prefer a dual boot, but I'm not sure how to do it with the different disk partitions and all.

2007-12-19T04:32:00.000Z	Phusion	DrKeith	if you have a spare partition w/ XP installed already, you can go ahead and install Ubuntu on whatever space you have left, one partition for your / filesystem and one for Swap Space, much like Windows's Page file
