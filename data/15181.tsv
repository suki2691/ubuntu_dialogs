2012-04-12T18:45:00.000Z	tutysra	escott	- in the bios menu which is got at startup by pressing F1 there are options to change to allow non-EFI boot, the community documentation(https://help.ubuntu.com/community/X120e#Installation) recommends it and I do not know how to allow non-EFI boot, I had tried various combinations in my bios settings like - (Both, EFI, Legacy) but none worked. If setting up a bios-grub partition is an easy option then I can give it a try.
2012-04-12T18:47:00.000Z	escott	tutysra	if you have a gpt partition the space following the mbr is not guaranteed to be empty and so grub cannot embed its stage2 files in that space. a small partition with the grub_bios flag is required to tell grub where it can embed stage two when booting with an mbr on a gpt partition. see rodsbooks.com for lots of details
