2007-07-27T15:05:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey		Can someone explain to me what GTK+ Engines are?
2007-07-27T15:06:00.000Z	Juhaz	d4rkmonkey	they're what themes use to draw things.
2007-07-27T15:07:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	Juhaz	does it make much of a difference if I get a different one?
2007-07-27T15:08:00.000Z	Juhaz	d4rkmonkey	alone, it doesn't do anything, but if you also get a theme that uses it, it can make everything look pretty different
