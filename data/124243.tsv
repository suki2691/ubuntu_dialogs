2012-09-09T09:56:00.000Z	myhero1	cfhowlett	thats no help....that will take some time...and os performance cant be judged in lil time.......i asked if anyone has used them and can suggest which is better.....
2012-09-09T09:57:00.000Z	myhero1		i have used ubuntu so far with xfce kde and lxde installed on it
2012-09-09T09:59:00.000Z	pepperjack	myhero1	well xfce and lxde have similar dependencies so the comparison would really be between them, unity(default ubuntu) and kubuntu.  personally i prefer kde or a ligher gtk environment like xfce or lxde
