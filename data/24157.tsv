2011-05-31T00:56:00.000Z	KM0201	toasty	if you're looking for ease of use, and there's a person at each pc... google "Teamviewer"
2011-05-31T00:58:00.000Z	KM0201	toasty	as long as you set teamviewer to run on startup, and set a "constant password", teamviewer would still work
2011-05-31T01:08:00.000Z	KM0201	toasty	repo is downi guess ( i got the same thing)... just try teamviewer, as long as its running ont he "remote" PC, and you know the username password for it.. you should have no problem.
