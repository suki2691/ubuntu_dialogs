2010-07-17T08:12:00.000Z	drew1	thune3	it does not work at all.
2010-07-17T08:16:00.000Z	drew1	thune3	I suddenly realized my problem. I was running gksudo gconf-editor. That was editing GNOME for all users but not my current user, I guess. Just doing gconf-editor let me edit my current user's desktop and everything is working now. Thanks.
