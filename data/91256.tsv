2008-05-10T19:34:00.000Z	Nono1		I can't install Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. It comes up with 'ATA3 SOFT RESET FAILED (DEVICE NOT FOUND)' Can anyone help with my problem please? Perhaps it's because my optical drive is SATA? I don't know... (btw, if anyone can see this can they let me know, i'm not sure if my messages are working, thanks)
