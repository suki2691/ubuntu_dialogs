2008-03-26T03:41:00.000Z	unop	yowshi	you can have something like ~/data-dir/ntfs and ~/data-dir/ext2 and have both partitions mounted on them
2009-02-22T04:21:00.000Z	unop	yowshi	 it's  pastebinit  not pastebininit
2009-02-22T04:24:00.000Z	yowshi	unop	i use tab completion for pastebinit anyway so while i may make such an error here without no tab completion it is much less likely in bash
