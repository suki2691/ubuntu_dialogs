2011-07-19T06:09:00.000Z	Jensit		Hm...
2011-07-19T06:10:00.000Z	Jensit		Had the same issue on my laptop... I reinstalled ubuntu and updated and everything went fine
2011-07-19T06:11:00.000Z	Mike9866	Jensit	you didn't make any changes aside from reinstalling Ubuntu?
2011-07-19T06:13:00.000Z	Mike9866	Jensit	sounds strange. I can't imagine how that would end up fixing the problem.
