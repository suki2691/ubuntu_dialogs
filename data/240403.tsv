2007-12-09T14:02:00.000Z	rgl_		I'm trying to install ubuntu in a raid, so I've downloaded the alternate install cd, but it installs X, is there other CD that can install to raid, but without X?
2007-12-09T14:03:00.000Z	nickrud	rgl_	there's a server cd, release.ubuntu.com/7.10
2007-12-09T14:03:00.000Z	nickrud	rgl_	erm, releases. etc
