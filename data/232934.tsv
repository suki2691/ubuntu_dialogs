2006-04-21T05:15:00.000Z	Alexi5		i was thinking of using oracle on ubuntu for a databse server at work. is it ok to that with ubuntu?
2006-04-21T05:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	Alexi5	why not run Postgres for free? (if you must you can run oracle in linux)
2006-04-21T05:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	Alexi5	is not free/libre software 8^P and it cost a "few"  too...
