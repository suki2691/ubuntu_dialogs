2008-12-26T19:57:00.000Z	Zmajci	rinsmaster	cizra: it seems like a feature, not a bug, that activate itself just after upgrade... just unable to find HOW to swith it off  LOL
2008-12-26T19:58:00.000Z	rinsmaster	Zmajci	yes it is a feature, but I can't find the option either now :P It was once activatable somewhere
