2008-05-31T05:58:00.000Z	___Alex___		better yet, what file contains my gnome panel info?
2008-05-31T05:59:00.000Z	astro76	___Alex___	only when you create a user is /etc/skel copied
2008-05-31T06:01:00.000Z	___Alex___	astro76	if i log in as another user, I can just copy over the entire .gconf folders to get my gnome panel settings back? does that sound right?
