2011-04-12T02:12:00.000Z	deveras		how do i force a remove with apt-get?
2011-04-12T02:13:00.000Z	deveras		sudo apt-get remove apache2 (tells me it does it, but the funny bit is that its still in the system and still running)
2011-04-12T02:14:00.000Z	iceroot	deveras	its just in the memory after stoping it, there is no apache2 anymore
