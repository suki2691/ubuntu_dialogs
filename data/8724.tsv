2011-11-27T11:39:00.000Z	Pauluntu		yeah but that means you have to be on gmail to do video chat though i didn't like that
2011-11-27T11:39:00.000Z	phix	Pauluntu	you have to be on skype to use skype chat, I much like being a gmail member than a skype member :)
2011-11-27T11:41:00.000Z	Pauluntu	phix	true but i prefer a stand alone application instead of having to run through the web browser.  but doesn't matter when i used it a few days ago the video kept crashing on gmail so i didn't have a choice i switched back to windows until these desktop wars with gnome3 end
