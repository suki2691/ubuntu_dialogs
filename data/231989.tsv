2007-12-07T21:46:00.000Z	Electro		I'm having trouble compiling Festival 1.95, reports that gcc isn't working properly
2007-12-07T21:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	Electro	install build essential
2007-12-07T22:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	Electro	have you run ./configure
2007-12-07T22:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	Electro	also do 'sudo apt-get build-dep festival' (only works if you have deb-src repos too)
