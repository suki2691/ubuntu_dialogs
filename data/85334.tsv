2008-08-31T11:12:00.000Z	corigo		I've downloaded the HH ISO twice, but every time I burn it to disk I get an error. Anyone seeing this problem?
2008-08-31T11:13:00.000Z	blitz	corigo	whats the error? and is it in burning or running the disk?
2008-08-31T11:17:00.000Z	corigo	blitz	burning. After each ISO download and burn it fails on File1 written file doesn't match the source
2008-08-31T11:18:00.000Z	blitz	corigo	could be the burning program or your drive itself.. hard to say
