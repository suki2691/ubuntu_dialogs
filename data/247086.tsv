2005-02-28T17:39:00.000Z	sontek		Hey, I'm looking at installing ubuntu. But I have a "WinModem" does the Linux kernel have support for dialup modems in it now?
2005-02-28T17:40:00.000Z	mjr	sontek	for winmodems, it depends; see http://linmodems.org/ for more info
2005-02-28T17:41:00.000Z	sontek	mjr	I was looking there but they didn't have much info on what chipsets were in the kernel
2005-02-28T17:41:00.000Z	mjr	sontek	ah well. I don't have any first-hand info.
