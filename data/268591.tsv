2004-09-27T11:41:00.000Z	ficusplanet		Hey everyone.  I'm having trouble getting a DWL-520 Rev B (prism 2.5 chipset) working in Ubuntu with the wlan-ng drivers.  Anyone have any experience with this?
2004-09-27T11:43:00.000Z	ficusplanet		Revision B is apparrently prism 2.5, yeah.  Even according to the hal device manager.
