2009-07-11T09:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MontelEdwards	  theres flv to converters online/. try converting some videos and see?
2009-07-11T09:40:00.000Z	MontelEdwards	Dr_Willis	not the point
2009-07-11T09:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MontelEdwards	 avi is just a container.. so the point is a bit pointless also...
