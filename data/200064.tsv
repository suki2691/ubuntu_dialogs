2006-01-24T15:01:00.000Z	molotov_		I'm trying to add my second harddrive to fstab, when I try "mount /mnt/hd2" I get the error that it's the wrong fs type, bad optino or bad superblock on /dev/hdb1, any ideas?

2006-01-24T15:05:00.000Z	molotov_		I cannot change my resolution to 1024x768. When I edit the sys -> pref -> screen res. section, when I select 1024, I can only choose 87 htz, which is silly for this old monitor. I know the monitor works in 1024 at 60htz, is there a way I can force or change this?
