2008-12-05T22:32:00.000Z	guest6294		im using wicd to connect wirelessly, however when I enable the encryption options, although I give the correct key, it will not authenticate, I have read something about wpa_supplicant, is it installed by default in ubuntu 8.10?
2008-12-05T22:33:00.000Z	maximilian-schro	guest6294	do you use kde or gnome? i had the same problem in kde 4.1 becauce the network manage didn't work asit should do.
2008-12-05T22:34:00.000Z	guest6294	maximilian-schro	im using gnome, with wicd, i got rid of network manager
