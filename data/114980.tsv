2008-03-02T20:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	the-killer	you kernel failed to boot into the hard drive and you landed on the initrd image...
2008-03-02T20:31:00.000Z	the-killer	erUSUL	can u help me to resolve that ?
2008-03-02T20:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	the-killer	it is hard to konw why the boot failed... there are cases where a boot kernel option solved the issue
2008-03-02T20:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	the-killer	like all-generic-ide to weird ide chips and others google around for people with the same problem and try the proposed solutions
