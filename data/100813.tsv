2008-02-18T00:11:00.000Z	parkinm		I have apache/php/sql installed on my windows machine, how can I browse to this from my ubuntu computer? I have tried //mike and xx.xx.xx.xx ip address from the address bar :|
2008-02-18T00:11:00.000Z	craigbass1976	parkinm	is the windows box a WAMP server for real?  Is there a firewall stopping it?
2008-02-18T00:12:00.000Z	parkinm	craigbass1976	it just has WAMP installed on it, its not being accessed externally. I am in uni halls tho, so I am unsure how the network works
2008-02-18T00:13:00.000Z	craigbass1976	parkinm	well, if you can't browse in a browser to the box, then it's not serving out right
