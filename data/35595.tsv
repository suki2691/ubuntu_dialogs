2010-11-21T02:58:00.000Z	antivirtel		hello all, I've just installed 5x(the 5th try) ubuntu 10.4 to a Pentium II based system, with 147 MB RAM and with 3GB + 10 GB HDDs, and this grub "kills my ideas", never started this system, at last: "error: unknown filesystem", the partitioning: hda - 3GB[hda1|200MB,/boot, ext3; hda2|3GB,swap] & hdb - 10GB[hda1|10GB, /, ext4] What is my mistake?!... I think the partitioning is *wrong*.
