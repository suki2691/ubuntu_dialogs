2007-08-07T10:56:00.000Z	KI4IKL	DeusEvo	depends on how much yuo plan to use linux. I fyou wanna store media i'd say about 20 gb, but I have a pc that runs linux on only 10 gb
2007-08-07T10:56:00.000Z	KI4IKL	DeusEvo	just however you much yuo think you need. I'd say no less than 10gb though
2007-08-07T10:56:00.000Z	DeusEvo	KI4IKL	all my media will probably reside on the Windows partition, so 10GB will probably suffice for Ubuntu?
