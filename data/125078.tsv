2007-09-30T05:18:00.000Z	Egonis		Just did a fresh 7.04 install, but upon reboot, gdm crashes out because of 'nvidia' missing. I apt-get installed nvidia-glx-new, but what else am I missing? I can modprobe the nvidia driver with no issue, but gdm complains of no driver found
2007-09-30T05:18:00.000Z	scguy318	Egonis	wouldn't you need to install nvidia-glx?
2007-09-30T05:18:00.000Z	Egonis	scguy318	Tried that too
2007-09-30T05:19:00.000Z	Egonis	scguy318	nvidia-glx-new replaced nvidia-glx, so I tried both
