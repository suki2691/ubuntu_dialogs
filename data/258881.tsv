2006-12-25T11:51:00.000Z	Spisters		right, my question is, is there any reason to duel boot, can Ubuntu look to windows for drivers?
2006-12-25T11:52:00.000Z	Spisters		then if I have other computers with windows and need this as a server this is no reason to do that
2006-12-25T11:52:00.000Z	ken	Spisters	Ubuntu CANNOT look IN WINDOWS
