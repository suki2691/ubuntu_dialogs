2005-03-31T07:49:00.000Z	zubunt		Hello. I need help with ubuntu and accessing my printer, that is connected to a debian pc.
2005-03-31T07:50:00.000Z	zubunt		Is there any documentation about the ubuntu printing system?
2005-03-31T07:50:00.000Z	Rattboi	zubunt	it's CUPS
2005-03-31T07:52:00.000Z	zubunt	Rattboi	But how thos the gnomeprinting stuff work. I cannnot access my printer with this tools, and I don't want to do the configuration of cups with emacs. IMHO this is not the appropiate way in ubuntu, there must be a more userfriendly way.
