2009-11-23T05:22:00.000Z	Vesayth		Does anyone know how I can connect to a samba share from a computer that uses a different domain than my home network? On this computer, I'm VPN'ing in to my home network. I can access the shares by IP address just fine, but I get an access denied error when I try the host name (but I am able to ping the host name). Server is Ubuntu 9.10 64-bit and client is Windows Vista 32-bit

2009-11-23T05:25:00.000Z	Vesayth	billiard_junkee	The username is definitely added. Is there a special way to add a user from a different domain?
