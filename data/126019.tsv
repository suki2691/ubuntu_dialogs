2007-08-07T06:24:00.000Z	Thatguy	serenityUK	Really? is Compiz-Fusion still easy to install like Beryl was? Is it more demanding on the system? is it less buggy?
2007-08-07T06:27:00.000Z	serenityUK	Thatguy	Compiz was the first and original. then some people forked it to make Beryl, based on same code but more exiting effects because compiz folk worried about stability.. After a year of war and jealously they remerged recently into Compiz-Fusion, to bring the new plugins back into Compiz.. Now if you want the latest stuff you have to get COmpiz-Fusion
2007-08-07T06:31:00.000Z	Thatguy	serenityUK	ohic, thanks for the update. I knew compiz-fuson was out there but I never thought about using it. Your right though, the newest thing out gets the attetion and work force so regular old Beryl will most likely be left in the cold. Or are they actually going to officially discontinue Beryl?
