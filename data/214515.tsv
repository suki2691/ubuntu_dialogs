2007-02-26T11:25:00.000Z	holly2hottie		 hey, I have a question... while running gnome on edgy w/ all the aviliable updates my Xserver seems to be closing completly and restarts for no reason at all, is there anyone that can help me? Also does anyone know if I would be better off asking for help for this particular issue in a Xorg channel, and is there a channel like that? thanks
