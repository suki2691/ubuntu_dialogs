2007-01-23T14:47:00.000Z	[Hyarion] 	ciscosurfer	definitely not at certain times, while I usually have the same apps open x-chat, Firefox, etc. it's hard to tell if one of them were causing it, but I'm pretty sure it's happened with multiple apps too
2007-01-23T14:48:00.000Z	[Hyarion] 	ciscosurfer	well, I've only been running for a couple days, and yes everyday, the issue is only when I'm using the computer, I leave all the apps running overnight without an issue.
