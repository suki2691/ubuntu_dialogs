2012-02-14T04:16:00.000Z	MoleMan		What is the best command to copy a large amount of data AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, NOT MODIFY PERMISSIONS/OWNERS? rsync, cpio or standard cp -p
2012-02-14T04:16:00.000Z	meskarune	MoleMan	I'd use rsync
2012-02-14T04:16:00.000Z	meskarune		anwyays, I got to go. see ya'll
2012-02-14T04:18:00.000Z	MoleMan	meskarune	will rsync definately not modify the owners etc? I've just moved my entire system to an LVM and booted it to find everything is owned by root... not happy :(
