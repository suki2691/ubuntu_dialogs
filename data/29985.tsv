2010-06-21T19:56:00.000Z	joshua_roberts		nvidia-settings is not giving me what I need.  Ubuntu 9.10x64  2 nvidia video cards, 4 monitors.  2 Xserver sessions, one for each pair of monitors.  But when I do this I get a huge virtual desktop that spans both monitors, also my maximized applications span both monitors.
2010-06-21T19:57:00.000Z	joshua_roberts		I want maximized applications to only take up one monitor, having something more like the extended desktop feature in windows instead of a huge virtual desktop.

2010-06-21T19:58:00.000Z	joshua_roberts	forceflow	I can select twinview and that is the source of the problem.  Twinview generates one huge virtual desktop, one screen that is stretched across two monitors
