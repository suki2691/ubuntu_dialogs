2012-02-18T20:52:00.000Z	airtonix	gilles_	you may think so, but my laptop has a quad core i7 and 12gb of ddr3 ram and the latest nvidia card... it still slows down when i have 50 programs open
2012-02-18T20:53:00.000Z	airtonix	gilles_	i would first try 2d mode in either unity or gnome-shell, then try xfce
2012-02-18T20:55:00.000Z	airtonix	gilles_	well that's a fairly drastic reaction, did you try gnome-shell or xfce ?
