2006-10-31T13:26:00.000Z	Cmcrae		I have a few questions about Ubunto Linux... 1) How do I make it so Ubunto Desktop does not start in X. 2) How do I go and set up the root account and password
2006-10-31T13:27:00.000Z	PSUSI	Cmcrae	see above for root, as for disabling X, go into the services applet and disable gdm
2006-10-31T13:28:00.000Z	PSUSI	Cmcrae	that would be the meaning of disable... at least the meaning I intended
2006-10-31T13:29:00.000Z	PSUSI	Cmcrae	what information?  You just plug it in
