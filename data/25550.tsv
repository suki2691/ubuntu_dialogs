2011-10-17T02:40:00.000Z	penguin42	jsebean	It probably is, I'm just being cautius that if there is any part of the credentials in the logs I don't want you to accidentally make them public
2011-10-17T02:43:00.000Z	jsebean	penguin42	i ran gksudo gedit /var/log/wpa_supplicant.log and they're empty
2011-10-17T02:43:00.000Z	penguin42	jsebean	Hmm then you probably need someone who knows a bit more about wireless debug than me, that's where I would have looked
