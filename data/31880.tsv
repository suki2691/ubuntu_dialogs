2010-05-30T00:49:00.000Z	d3javu	matrixx_	well the problem is the sound applet, the gnome-volume-control-applet keep disappearing everytime i restart, so i need to do something to automatically starts it when system reboot. if there is no easy way to do it, then i would like to change the indicator session applet which has sound. remove evolution and add in thunderbird.

2010-05-30T00:51:00.000Z	d3javu	matrixx_	oh thank you for the suggestion. i'll try the link given by xangua, if it doesn't satisfy me, then i try your way. thank you again.
