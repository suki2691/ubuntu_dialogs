2008-11-16T08:48:00.000Z	samacs		here's the thing...
2008-11-16T08:49:00.000Z	samacs		I'm trying to install ubuntu from a LiveCD but got this error telling me that the live cd cannot resize anypartition, I googled it and found that when a partition is damaged MBR protects partitions from being changed, is that right? so partitions cannot be made by live cd
2008-11-16T08:51:00.000Z	EJ	samacs	you could wipe out the partitions so the drive has no partitions and then do an install ... i have seen some disrto's lock up the partitions so Ubuntu cant install be, i simply wiped out all partitions and the let Ubuntu create on a clean drive
