2012-08-03T00:18:00.000Z	D77		Can someone direct me to information on redirecting sites. I have a Ubuntu Amahi server with apache installed that hosts a virtual Ubutnu turnkey server running wordpress. I would like to my physical server to redirect "domain.com" to the local IP of the virtual Ubuntu server"
