2010-11-19T02:22:00.000Z	Wicked		hello all. im looking to install ubuntu 10.04 on a non computer savvy friends laptop. It has a ati radeon rs690m x1200 graphics card and im wondering what driver it should use to get the best performance. right now i have the livecd booted and it works well...but i dont think its using the ati driver...also under the hardware drivers in the menus it does not show anything
2010-11-19T02:22:00.000Z	Wicked		i have alwasy had nvidia cards...so everything ati is new to me
2010-11-19T02:23:00.000Z	Wicked		ok so thats normal for nothing to show up in the hardware drivers part in the livecd?
