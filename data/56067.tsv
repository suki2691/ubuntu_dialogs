2009-05-30T03:35:00.000Z	Artelus		I have a question. Right now I am dual-booting both windows and ubuntu. If i were to go into windows system recovery and reset windows that way, would it touch my ubuntu installation? and more importantly, would GRUB still work?
2009-05-30T03:37:00.000Z	Artelus		Alright, thanks guys. :)
