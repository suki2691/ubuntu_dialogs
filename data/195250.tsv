2006-05-01T12:27:00.000Z	Falc		Hi. I want to change my recently installed Ubuntu system so that X does not start at the beginning.
2006-05-01T12:27:00.000Z	Falc		I'd like it so that I have to start it manually- I do not want it uninstalled.
2006-05-01T12:27:00.000Z	Jimmey__	Falc	try downloading BUM, maybe to can stop X from starting that way
2006-05-01T12:28:00.000Z	Jimmey__	Falc	probably, I just don't know of it
