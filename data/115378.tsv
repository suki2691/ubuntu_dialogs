2008-03-09T20:33:00.000Z	iobelix		ljl, thanks. usually though, if two distros are gnome based (and assuming that they use the same kernels and gnome versions) is sharing /home a problem? reason i ask is that i installed foresight and got major permission problems
2008-03-09T20:34:00.000Z	ompaul	iobelix	that would not be a good idea - even the same OS different versions would be bad
2008-03-09T20:38:00.000Z	iobelix	ompaul	i see. the thing is i have more of my hard disk space allocated to /home (ubuntu). the extended partition i have free for testing distros is pretty small because i'd assumed i'd mount that as root and share home. is there any way i could use the same /home partition without messing things up?
