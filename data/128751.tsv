2007-08-07T05:46:00.000Z	geek	Kissaki	sure
2007-08-07T05:48:00.000Z	Kissaki	geek	i was wondering whether i can optimize the installation by picking only the needed packages and installing them, does it include the laptop packages and wireless stuff? I have never done that in ubuntu, but previously tried it in debian...
