2008-08-15T04:11:00.000Z	Daisuke_Laptop	kevin_123	nearly the same thing, but gksudo uses the current user's preferences and permissions where applicable to avoid permissions problems
2008-08-15T04:40:00.000Z	Daisuke_Laptop	kevin_123	absolutely
2008-08-15T04:42:00.000Z	Daisuke_Laptop	kevin_123	nowhere near as terrible as windows
