In Open Office 3.2.1 , Ubuntu 10.04, unix-style paste works, but not copy. System fonts ('serif', 'monospace') are not listed in the fonts dropdown either. Looks like Open Office lacks interation with the system.

I don't care much about fonts, but absense of unix style copy , which I am always using in emacs, terminal, firefox, ... , and then get suddenly stuck and see that it is open office, is very annoying. What can you suggest for a fix?
