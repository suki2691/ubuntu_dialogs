2010-05-08T16:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Czxr	 speed - doubt if you will notie any differances.
2010-05-08T16:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Czxr	 i see no need to use Mint. Unless you like how they set things up by default.
2010-05-08T16:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Czxr	 and i can see a lot of reasons to NOT use mint. I reccomend you use a actaual ubuntu  - or offically supported variant.
