2007-08-29T06:39:00.000Z	whatspy		is it possible to combine the power of bash with the power of vim? you know, when you get used to vim, you tend to miss vim's commands everywhere you can type text...
2007-08-29T06:39:00.000Z	W9ZEB	whatspy	you could replace bash with ksh, or tcsh
2007-08-29T06:40:00.000Z	W9ZEB	whatspy	I KNOW ksh can use vi style command structure.  tcsh I suspect can but I'm not 100% certain
2007-08-29T06:40:00.000Z	W9ZEB	whatspy	no problem
