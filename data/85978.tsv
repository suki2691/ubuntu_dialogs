2008-07-10T09:21:00.000Z	mikemorr		Hello all. I just booted from the 8.04.1 CD. I got past the language selection and to the menu. When I pick "Install Ubuntu" or "Check CD for defects" the logo appears and the progress bar goes back and forth and then freezes. Now it is frozen. Any ideas on what's wrong?
