2008-05-22T05:03:00.000Z	mophead		I have a Toshiba laptop and a tv.  Also a dvd player.  I don't have an s-video cord.  Is there another way to jerry rig  things so I can see my monitor output on my television?

2008-05-22T05:05:00.000Z	Fishscene	mophead	it only works if your TV supports VGA input (only come HDTV's have that ability)
