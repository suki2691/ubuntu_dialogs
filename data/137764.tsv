2010-01-27T00:57:00.000Z	desen		hello, i can't find anything really useful via google.com/linux. I can only find old topics, back from the year `05 or `07. What i have: eth0 with a ppp0 on it and an eth1. What i want is to connect eth1 with my laptop, which runs Windowza XP. Any good tutorial, please ?
