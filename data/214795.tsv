2006-10-31T11:24:00.000Z	mjbjr		I have a friend on the line and the dsl net connection has stopped working... modem lights are blinking (properly ?)... ifconfig shows eth0 is up... ping shows "host unreachable"... assuming verizon problem... some other thing to check before getting on the horn to verizon
