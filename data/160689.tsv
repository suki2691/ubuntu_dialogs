2010-01-11T01:46:00.000Z	Cuddles		Got a few quick questions. if I have an infected NTFS or FAT32 file system and I remove the files off of the drive onto my ubuntu OS can I infect other partitions of the drive

2010-01-11T02:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Cuddles	You mean 8.04?
2010-01-11T02:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Cuddles	Or 6.10?
