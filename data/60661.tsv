2010-01-03T15:02:00.000Z	AK_Dave	ubuntunewbie	none that I am aware of
2010-01-03T15:02:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	AK_Dave	? there is an option on 9.10
2010-01-03T15:04:00.000Z	AK_Dave	ubuntunewbie	I am not aware that there is an actual difference between the two. The manual command is umount. Anything else is just a menu option that does the same thing.
