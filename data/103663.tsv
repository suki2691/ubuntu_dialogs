After reboot linux speaks that cannot start check fsck and root filesystem mounted read-only then he asks to enter root the password from maintenance, any does not approach. Now I was loaded with live cd, but on any inquiry of type e2fsck/dev/sda he writes device is busy. Though normally mounts/dev/sda1 (ntfs) the others does not see.
