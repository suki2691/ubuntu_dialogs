2007-02-18T09:21:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	subopt	Did the information from ubotu help?  You know that Feisty is not officially released yet?  Installing Feisty means you are doing beta testing (which is great!).  Check out the big green box at ubuntuforums.org about "Herd 4", the name of the latest release candidate.
