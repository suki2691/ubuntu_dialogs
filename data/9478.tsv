2012-06-22T06:26:00.000Z	echo083		i have 8.04 server i'd like to upgrade to 12.04, should i do it with two updates (8.04 => 10.04 => 12.04) or one update (8.04 => 12.04) ?
2012-06-22T06:28:00.000Z	echo083		no opinion ?
2012-06-22T06:28:00.000Z	deitarion	echo083	I'd be very wary of doing that big an upgrade in one jump. I'm pretty sure it's not a supported option.
2012-06-22T06:29:00.000Z	echo083	deitarion	you think that's not even possible to upgrade from 8.04 to 12.04 ok i'll do it in two updates
