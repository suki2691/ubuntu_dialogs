2009-01-03T11:36:00.000Z	raylu	futeki	thunderbird, evolution
2009-01-03T11:37:00.000Z	futeki	raylu	Web, my ubuntu bud tells me Evolution is unstable and horrible... and thunderbird, I don't feel can even qualify as a real mail client.
2009-01-03T11:38:00.000Z	raylu	futeki	it's only missing the useless features of ms exchange server
