2005-06-23T09:43:00.000Z	talamod		can anyone tell me if it's a REALLY bad idea to add apt sources that are intended for debian unstable into Ubuntu? I've added the agnula packages...

2005-06-23T09:43:00.000Z	talamod	rob^	well that's a shame, perhaps I'll have to do a reinstall soon :)
2005-06-23T09:44:00.000Z	talamod	rob^	trygvebw, I needed Ardour. agnula also upgraded/changed libc6... so there could be some _really_ bad things happening soon :)
