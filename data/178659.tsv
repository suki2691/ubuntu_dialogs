2009-06-24T11:18:00.000Z	bodinux	space_cadet	: If I connect through tty1, will the wlan be activted automatically ?
2009-06-24T11:19:00.000Z	bodinux	space_cadet	I think I have to check the wicd command line options if there are any.
2009-06-24T11:19:00.000Z	space_cadet	bodinux	i mean on the laptop, go to tty1 instead of loggin in from the GDM, then setup the wireless connection (a bit over my head still on all the details that need to configured manually)  then tty7 it back to the GDM
