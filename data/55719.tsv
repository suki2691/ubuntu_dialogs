2009-06-21T20:50:00.000Z	Time`s_Witness		i have a general linux question ... how does the system keep its timing precision please?
2009-06-21T20:51:00.000Z	cabrey	Time`s_Witness	it uses UNIX time
2009-06-21T20:53:00.000Z	Time`s_Witness	cabrey	as i can read in wiki (even though it's not the best source), UNIX time keeps track of number of seconds since 1st jan 1970. that doesn't explain the timing precision, just how it calculates current time
