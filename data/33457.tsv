2010-05-16T06:26:00.000Z	chrismsnz		hey guys, quick question - what's the recommended desktop virtualisation solution on 10.04? kvm w/frontend? virtualbox? vmware?
2010-05-16T06:27:00.000Z	chrismsnz		want to run a windows instance and a couple of other linux instances too
2010-05-16T06:27:00.000Z	acicula	chrismsnz	kvm-qemu or vbox
2010-05-17T01:43:00.000Z	chrismsnz	acicula	yeah, the problem I think with libvirt is everything is a bit too extracted - can't get to the features you need
