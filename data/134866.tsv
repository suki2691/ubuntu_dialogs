2007-05-28T13:26:00.000Z	ompaul	M_42	it does it automagically
2007-05-28T13:29:00.000Z	M_42	ompaul	but if you want to force an application to use a particular core... how do you do that/
2007-05-28T13:30:00.000Z	ompaul	M_42	well lets see the kernel decides automatically, so I guess you let the kernel choose, or get the source out and fork your own
