2010-07-27T02:45:00.000Z	jjmartin_		i am running an update and I have this window for grub asking to install on partitions. currently the / partition is checked. should I leave it as is ?
2010-07-27T02:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jjmartin_	default is usually fine
2010-07-27T02:46:00.000Z	jjmartin_	ActionParsnip	why would i be prompt to install it in the same place again?
2010-07-27T02:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jjmartin_	because its coded to install to the same disk you installed ubuntu to by default, the alternate ISO lets you choose the disk as you wish
