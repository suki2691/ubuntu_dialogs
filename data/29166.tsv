2010-07-11T18:43:00.000Z	IMetaphysikz_	nhck	I don't really know I've just seen examples where people have been using cifs and information saying about another command that's depricated
2010-07-11T18:44:00.000Z	nhck	IMetaphysikz_	hmm I was just guessing since you are mounting from windows you could also use smbfs?
2010-07-11T18:45:00.000Z	nhck	IMetaphysikz_	would of course require samba , sambafs to beinstalled
