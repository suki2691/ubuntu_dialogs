2006-04-01T09:42:00.000Z	Luzer		did it work for you
2006-04-01T09:42:00.000Z	zenbum	Luzer	i couldn't get XGL to work with a Radeon 9600
2006-04-01T09:45:00.000Z	zenbum	Luzer	my screen cleared & it showed the spinning-pizza-of-death icon, but never finished initializing... log file didn't reveal much... i gave up fairly quickly
