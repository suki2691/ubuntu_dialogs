2006-01-04T17:39:00.000Z	vb_coder		i forgot to defrag windows xp before resizing it with ubuntu. the windows install had just been installed without any other programs installed. ubuntus documentation does not say to defrag before resizing the windows partition. will this corrupt windows?

2006-01-04T17:41:00.000Z	vb_coder	purpleheart_USMC	are you saying that ubuntu installed with xp without defragging or corrupting windows?
2006-01-04T17:41:00.000Z	purpleheart_USMC	vb_coder	yes
