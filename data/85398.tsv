2008-07-15T21:08:00.000Z	Burnaphatone		Does anyone know a method for indentifying an ide hardisk during Ubuntu installation? I have tried configuring in bios, to no avail...
2008-07-15T21:09:00.000Z	gaelfx	Burnaphatone	what do you mean identifying?
2008-07-15T21:10:00.000Z	Burnaphatone	gaelfx	when I have my external hd turned on during installation, it finds that drive fine for a place to partition
2008-07-15T21:11:00.000Z	gaelfx	Burnaphatone	ok, sorry, I don't think I can help
