Now i want to use it in windows, how can i find out which driver should i download? The device info in ubuntu shows that it's a RTL8139 card. I bought it 8 years ago

2008-11-23T11:26:00.000Z	liye	dmsuperman	yes, i did. and i did download a driver and installed, however it didn't work. I mean, maybe the card is too old, that the driver doesn't support it anymore?
