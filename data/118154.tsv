2007-10-01T05:13:00.000Z	Smegzor		I have two servers running ubuntu.  This one has a monitor, keyboard, and mouse but the other one on my network has none of that.  I can login to its desktop via Cygwin on Windows, but I want to be able to do that same thing from this Linux box.  How do I get a remote gui login from here?
