2011-04-29T07:58:00.000Z	kathie	KM0201	arand, I guess it's like anything else, just going to take some getting used to. Is there anyway to add things to the panel?
2011-04-29T07:58:00.000Z	KM0201	kathie	i couldn't figure out how to, but you can create anothe rpanel, and add items to it... (i think).. and just set it to auto hide
