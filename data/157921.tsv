2009-04-07T03:18:00.000Z	Slart	ugliefrog	you have googled for it? I'm pretty sure they have a site
2009-04-07T03:19:00.000Z	Slart	ugliefrog	oh.. so you were looking for a deb package for cinepaint? .. tried getdeb?
2009-04-07T03:20:00.000Z	Slart	ugliefrog	hmm... then I don't really know where to look.. you could use checkinstall to create your own little package I think.. I've never used it myself though so I can't really say if it's easy or not
