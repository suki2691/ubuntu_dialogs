2010-01-16T05:31:00.000Z	javatexan		I am trying to do some web development.  I want to use php/ajax/js/etc and I know that I can install LAMPP....the question is, is there an easy way to only allow localhost connections?

2010-01-16T05:34:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	javatexan	right now, my macing only allows SSH on localhost after the firewall i made
