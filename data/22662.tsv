2011-02-27T23:21:00.000Z	Aikar		so why dont they just sell their product as "download wine, and pay us for support using wine"
2011-02-27T23:22:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Aikar	CrossoverLinux is a main contributor for WINE however they put together proprietary applications to allow Windows based programs to run better on Linux... A similar free progream is called PlayOn  linux
2011-02-27T23:23:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	Aikar	it's the same reason that RedHat doesn't give out their Distribution for free... you have to buy it (you can download similar clones like CentOS which contains all the free portions)
