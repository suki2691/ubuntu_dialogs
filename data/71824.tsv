2009-04-05T07:40:00.000Z	Level15		hi. I am trying to set up a private encrypted dir using ecryptfs-setup-private from ecryptfs-utils. however, when it prompts for my password and I enter it, it says it is incorrect, though I am pretty sure I am typing it correctly. Any clues?
2009-04-05T07:40:00.000Z	eseven73	Level15	have you tried truecrypt?
2009-04-05T07:42:00.000Z	Level15	eseven73	no, I am using luks for full HD encryption, but I need an extra layer of security for certain files so that they are encrypted even if the computer is on.
2009-04-05T07:43:00.000Z	eseven73	Level15	ok, well truecrypt is very nice even has a GUI, it encrypts just about everything really easily
