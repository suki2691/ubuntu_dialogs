2010-11-07T15:21:00.000Z	nici		I could really use some help here. X keeps crashing and there's nothing in the logs (as far as I can tell) that would indicate that something bad happened. I can make it crash just by, for example, starting Opera. Is there any other logs I should be looking at apart from Xorg.0.log ?

2010-11-07T15:23:00.000Z	histo	nici	I would also try disabling power management
2010-11-07T15:27:00.000Z	nici	histo	xorg dies and I'm back to the login screen
