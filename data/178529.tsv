2009-06-10T09:04:00.000Z	brennus		Ok, gaming question. I want to run windows & mac-only games on my Ubuntu(Jaunty)-only laptop. I've tried using WINE in the past to run microsoft programs, but failed miserably. I have yet to try VMware-style virtual machines. What's the best solution to running windows/mac games on my Ubuntu laptop? As many responses/opinions as possible wanted. Oh, and I've tried open-source alternative games. Most of the time they don't work right (
