2010-01-04T18:00:00.000Z	jatt		I'm watching a movie. Stupid screensaver kicks in every 5 minutes. Is there a way to tell the screensaver to don't do that? (different than disabling it everytime I watch a movie).
2010-01-04T18:00:00.000Z	doneill	jatt	what are you playing the movie with?
2010-01-04T18:01:00.000Z	doneill	jatt	yeah, not really, since a flash applet doesn't talk to the power saver part of the PC..
2010-01-04T18:01:00.000Z	doneill	jatt	but that isn't a linux thing, that's windows, mac, etc.
