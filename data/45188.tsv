2010-08-29T13:04:00.000Z	Nk26		Hello, I just installed the latest ubuntu on a old machine I have. Im trying to VNC into the machine from snow leopard and it connects just fine but it does not update.
2010-08-29T13:05:00.000Z	Nk26		I mean it wont refresh its just stuck on whatever was on the screen to begin with.
2010-08-29T13:07:00.000Z	Nk26		Do you know if its only a bug on the latest ubuntu?
