2007-05-08T16:48:00.000Z	spiraldark		Hey, I have a problem... Last time I booted Ubuntu (7.04) it said some weird things about file systems or something and wouldn't boot... it told me to do a fchk or something like that... so I did... and after that it ran (with errors at boot still)... I haven't turned it off since... but now whenever I  turn on desktop effects it suddenly turns to only one desktop and the windows don't work...
2007-05-08T16:48:00.000Z	spiraldark		...right (the windows still wobble and if I add more desktops again it will cube with them) but it's just not loading window contents and it used to work..... any ideas?
