2007-05-16T05:11:00.000Z	Noparse		Hey guys.
2007-05-16T05:12:00.000Z	Noparse		I have a major WTF question about Ubuntu.
2007-05-16T05:13:00.000Z	Noparse		I installed Ubuntu and it won't connect to the net. I usually use wireless, but I tried wired and that didn't work either. I rebooted. I tryed everything. Nothing. I would actually use it if it would work...
