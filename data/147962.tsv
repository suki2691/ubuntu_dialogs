2007-02-10T15:35:00.000Z	jexdawg		i want to edit /etc/apt/sources.list (for beryl installation purposes) but i can't because its root access only. i can open it in gedit but cannot save it... my other option of course is sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list in terminal, but i'm not familiar with how to edit it and then save what i edited. any help?
