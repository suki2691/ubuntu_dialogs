2007-06-04T11:19:00.000Z	Deinumite	FKi	you could try frostwire, i think its just the opensource version of limewire
2007-06-04T11:20:00.000Z	Deinumite	FKi	i used automatix, although i heard that screws with packages or something
2007-06-04T11:21:00.000Z	Deinumite	FKi	if you like limewire, frostwire looks basically identical
