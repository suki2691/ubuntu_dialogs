2009-11-13T01:18:00.000Z	wysiwyg		Hey Guys, I'm trying to install a copy of Ubuntu that I snagged from a torrent site, but I really need a CD key before I start the install - I'de hate to get halfway through and realize that I don't have the key. Anyone know where I could find a key gen? Thanks a lot!
