2005-05-24T10:26:00.000Z	nalioth	defkewl	xfce is "ligher" in the cpu usage department, if thats what you're asking
2005-05-24T10:28:00.000Z	defkewl	nalioth	I have a 2.2 Gigs P4 and 128 MB RAM and I didn't see any performance difference compared to gnome :(
2005-05-24T10:28:00.000Z	nalioth	defkewl	there may not be a noticeable diff in a higher-end machine
