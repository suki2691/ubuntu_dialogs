2010-02-22T03:12:00.000Z	T3rm1l1nux	pokui	 I know that I was just wondering
2010-02-22T03:14:00.000Z	pokui	T3rm1l1nux	the skype protocol is proprietary, though skype is building sip into the mix (though that's only for calls). so for now it's not likely you'll be able to use anything else besides skype to chat with skype users
