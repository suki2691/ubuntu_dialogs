2007-02-12T11:09:00.000Z	ScreaminIke		A have a large collection of music. each is in a folder, sorted by.. album. each album cover is in its respective folder, named "cover400.jpg". i know i can change the icon of individual folders. but i'm talking about over 300 albums. is ther a simple command to change these folder's icons to the cover400.jgp inside of them?
2007-02-12T11:11:00.000Z	unop	ScreaminIke	i'm not sure, but can you place a particular file in a folder to get it to be the icon?
2007-02-12T11:19:00.000Z	ScreaminIke	unop	no. but there is a ~/.thumbnails/ folder. that useful?
2007-02-12T11:23:00.000Z	unop	ScreaminIke	 well,  i cant be sure, the files in ~/.thumbnails seem to be created by gnome/nautilus and don't have any apparent connection to the files they provide icons for .. maybe gnome/nautilus has a database has a map in a databse for this somewhere
