2011-12-24T09:48:00.000Z	usr13	blackbandit1258	The system completely locks up?
2011-12-24T09:50:00.000Z	usr13	blackbandit1258	Can you ssh in from another pc?
2011-12-24T09:53:00.000Z	usr13	blackbandit1258	You might run  tail -f /var/log/messages    and see what it says as it locks up.  Might give you a clue.
