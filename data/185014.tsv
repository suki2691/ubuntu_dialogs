2006-05-26T15:07:00.000Z	svefi		hello, ububtu users, i am very new to linux and installed yesterday ubuntu on my notebook. Everything is working ok. But when booting the screen resolution is not seelcted properly. 1280x800 would be the correct setting. But displayed text is wrapped up from the buttom to the top of the screen. Can anybody help me with this problem?
