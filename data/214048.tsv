2008-09-23T14:32:00.000Z	airtonix	Jaffarkelshac	that is controlled via gtk theme properties...
2008-09-23T14:33:00.000Z	airtonix	Jaffarkelshac	but if you look in system -> preferences -> appearance.. you will notice that by swithcing between the colour and the controls tabs...that only some themes support the usage of the coour tab to affect the colours of common elements
2008-09-23T14:34:00.000Z	airtonix	Jaffarkelshac	i recommend you install ginspector if you want to work with modifying themes.
