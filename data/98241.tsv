2008-03-12T14:15:00.000Z	doff	Linux_Fresher	bunzip2 filename
2008-03-12T14:16:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	doff	would this work ?  i pull the folder out of the archive manager --> so this is decompressing [unzipping] .. may be i can re-pack it to .tar somehow ?
2008-03-12T14:17:00.000Z	doff	Linux_Fresher	this should unpack to .tar file
