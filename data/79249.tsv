2009-05-26T01:44:00.000Z	Code-E		So how do I make AWN look like OS X's dock? :)
2009-05-26T01:46:00.000Z	nalys	Code-E	use Cairo dock it's easier ;)
2009-05-26T01:46:00.000Z	Code-E	nalys	i tried using Cairo and found it ugly and too large
2009-05-26T01:48:00.000Z	nalys	Code-E	I used awn before, and I find Cairo dock to be way more customizable, but hey, awn nice too, I just don't know how to make it look like OSX honestly.
