2010-08-17T06:25:00.000Z	nophis_		I installed Subtitle Editor but when I open the program reports a message saying I don't have a H.264 and MPEG4 AAC decoder. Which package should I install to fix this?
2010-08-17T06:26:00.000Z	st__	nophis_	try gstreamer-plugins-*
2010-08-17T06:34:00.000Z	nophis_	st__	H.264 still missing, I didnt install the dbg packages. Or I need them?
2010-08-17T06:35:00.000Z	st__	nophis_	no, they are for crash troubleshooting
