2008-06-21T00:49:00.000Z	airstrikeivanov	Yatas	Yes. As long as you have the right codecs.
2008-06-21T00:50:00.000Z	airstrikeivanov	Yatas	Just like in Windows, to play certain formats you require the right software to be able to display the content.
2008-06-21T00:50:00.000Z	airstrikeivanov	Yatas	If you try to play a video without the proper codecs, Ubuntu will ask you to find them to install.
