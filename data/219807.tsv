2008-03-11T06:24:00.000Z	ubuntu2		can i use ubuntu grub without having ubuntu install and choose to boot opnesuse or windows? right now i think i have ubuntu grub installed but it loads opensuse grb and doesn't boot up windows properly (windows freeze)

2009-10-29T13:25:00.000Z	Flannel	ubuntu2	slabbeh: No.  It'll be released within the next 26 hours.  Check out #ubuntu-release-party for updates/questions/etc
