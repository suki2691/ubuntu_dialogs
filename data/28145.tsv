2010-08-19T21:03:00.000Z	GoldWyvern		My question is that I need to know how to properly document what I believe is a bug on boot up, so I might get some assistance with it. If someone has a moment, please let me know. It's pretty busy in here.
2010-08-19T21:03:00.000Z	guampa	GoldWyvern	you can file a bug report
2010-08-19T21:06:00.000Z	guampa	GoldWyvern	it's in ubuntu launchpad where you want to file the report then, and start by describing the conditions of the error and maybe a dmesg
2010-08-19T21:07:00.000Z	guampa	GoldWyvern	seems plenty
