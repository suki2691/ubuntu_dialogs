2009-11-09T06:17:00.000Z	dragon		what's the easiest way of setting up an outgoing mail server on karmic server?
2009-11-09T06:17:00.000Z	Heebie	dragon	apt-get install postfix
2009-11-09T06:18:00.000Z	dragon	Heebie	postfix failed during karmic's installation, but i'll try again.
2009-11-09T06:18:00.000Z	Heebie	dragon	I think a lot of things don't work quite right in karmic :(
