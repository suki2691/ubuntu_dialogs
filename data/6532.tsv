2012-01-09T02:27:00.000Z	russf	wildwind	No. We just noticed it. One volume is the initial root volume, the other is another EBS volume we added later.  They both show the same ID that the added volume should have.

2012-01-09T02:32:00.000Z	wildwind	russf	didn'd see such a thing. wonder what dd think about /dev/xvdj size? :)
