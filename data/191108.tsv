2009-04-25T18:32:00.000Z	Panarchy		I'm starting to learn how to package for Ubuntu using the official guide: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Complete#rules however, at that point (rules) I can't seem to understand it. On my system (Jaunty i386 9.04) on VMware, I'm getting the following rules file: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/157886/
2009-04-25T18:32:00.000Z	Panarchy		Can someone please explain? Or can someone please suggest a better guide?
