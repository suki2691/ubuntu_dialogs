2005-02-21T08:52:00.000Z	jnk	zombics	try copying the file to /usr/lib, just to see if it works
2005-02-21T08:53:00.000Z	zombics	jnk	hehe it worked :) thx !
2005-02-21T08:54:00.000Z	jnk	zombics	ok there is a less hacky way to do it then, you must configure <I don't remember what> to look in /usr/local/lib, because you should never touch yourself /usr/lib
