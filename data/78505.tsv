2009-05-05T03:45:00.000Z	boshhead		Hi. I seem to have lost my update manager icon in the top right of the screen. How can I get it back?
2009-05-05T03:46:00.000Z	histo	boshhead	it only appears when it sees that updates are needed I thought.
2009-05-05T03:47:00.000Z	histo	boshhead	but you can run sudo apt-get update in a terminal and it will check for updates
2009-05-05T03:47:00.000Z	boshhead	histo	maybe? I've never noticed it missing before :) But maybe I'm a slacker when it comes to updating...
