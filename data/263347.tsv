2006-07-04T05:30:00.000Z	ynef	Heda	plug something in, wait a couple of seconds and see what the last lines of output from the command "dmesg" is
2006-07-04T05:31:00.000Z	Heda	pl_ice	its weird because it automounted then last night but now its not even showing then in /dev
2006-07-04T05:32:00.000Z	ynef	Heda	so how about that dmesg output?
