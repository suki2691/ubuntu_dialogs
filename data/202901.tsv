2007-03-31T11:07:00.000Z	lolbunnylol		Hey guys i screwed up... I deleted my linux partition with Partition Magic, in winxp, and converted the partition space into ntfs. Problem is GRUB is screwed, and i cant get windows mbr back. Do you think if i were to format the whole harddrive, it would fix the problem?
