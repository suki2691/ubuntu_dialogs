2006-01-25T07:13:00.000Z	Gordy3		hey guys, I made some changes to my xorg.conf and stuffed it up. gdm is auto-loading on startup...how do i kill it as i need to get to terminal? thanks in advance
2006-01-25T07:14:00.000Z	Gordy3		ohh before some one says ctrl+alt+backspace....no good. gdm launches afain....i even made a xorg backup...
