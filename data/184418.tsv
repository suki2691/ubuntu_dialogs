2006-06-10T10:34:00.000Z	dick-richardson		i'm on the laptop now...I set the display to do nothing when the lid switch is closed. when I close the lid switch, the display stays active
2006-06-10T10:35:00.000Z	SurfnKid	dick-richardson	maybe the switch is bad?
2006-06-10T10:35:00.000Z	SurfnKid	dick-richardson	whoa thats like mine
2006-06-10T10:36:00.000Z	SurfnKid	dick-richardson	 but just stays on when you close it
