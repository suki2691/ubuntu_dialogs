2012-01-04T22:56:00.000Z	AnonMasochist		how do I fix the ever so famous FREEZING problem in Ubuntu 10.04!?!, I have looked on ALL forums, and still can't find a freakin' solution, other than to switch to a less user friendly Linux OS. 
2012-01-04T22:57:00.000Z	iceroot	AnonMasochist	should we guess what the "famous FREEZING problem" is?
2012-01-04T22:57:00.000Z	iceroot	AnonMasochist	you have a bug for that?
