2007-03-13T10:27:00.000Z	zool2005		can anyone suggest why my camera sometimes shows jpeg file extension as .jpg and other times as .JPG? It is a pain as nautilus won't display thumbnails of .JPG files
2007-03-13T10:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	zool2005	 because ms often does the same thing. :)
2007-03-13T10:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	zool2005	 you mean .jpg and .JPG or is it actually using .jpeg ?
2007-03-13T10:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	zool2005	 proberly can. but i dont use gnome.
