2011-10-30T08:38:00.000Z	linus		if you can install the packages for lxde or xfce from ubuntu. then why arent you still using ubuntu?
2011-10-30T08:39:00.000Z	linus		are you going to limit the discusion in here to only unity windows manager? because I still like using gnome3 more because it is faster then unity2d
