2011-08-01T21:12:00.000Z	Guest8178		Hi, is there a way to change file associations in GNOME 2.30 ?
2011-08-01T21:12:00.000Z	th0r	Guest8178	they are called mimetypes I believe. Check into how to change those
2011-08-01T21:13:00.000Z	Guest8178	th0r	That's exactly what I did. I have edited /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache and done various .desktop file wizardry. It still doesn't work at all
2011-08-01T21:14:00.000Z	th0r	Guest8178	well, that is the extent of my knowledge of gnome. In xfce I just change it in the file's properties
