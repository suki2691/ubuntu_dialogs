2008-07-31T09:27:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Vampy	 you can browse and mount windows 'shares' using  the gnome file manager, or other ways.
2008-07-31T09:29:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Vampy	 its the default file manager you are using,. if you are using ubuntu. Theres some 'network' location you use to see the various windows network/shares.
2008-07-31T09:31:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Vampy	 you sort of just asked a different thing. :)  The gnome file manager can access shares on the windows box.  as for shareing directories to the windows machine. I always install samba, and configure it manually. Theres proberly some gnome gui tools to do it. But ive never used them,
