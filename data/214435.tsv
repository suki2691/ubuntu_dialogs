2006-11-25T07:18:00.000Z	Crell		Does anyone have a favorite jabber server to use on ubuntu?  I've been using ejabberd in the past, but I am open to new ideas for this server.  I'm mostly looking for easy maintenance and good feature set (group chats, logging, encyption).

2006-11-25T07:20:00.000Z	Crell	khermans_	Yeah, that's what I've been using.  I was wondering if anything had changed in the market in the past 2 years.
