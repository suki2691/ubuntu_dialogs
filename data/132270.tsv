2010-06-20T07:18:00.000Z	Pen		Is there a better dvd burning software for UBUNTU like "ConvertXToDVD" is for Windows. Using this program on default of Ubuntu called, "Brasero Disc Burner" and when making video, it goes by minutes instead of memory like most of the windows ones I've tried. Are their any other better DVD Burning Software for Ubuntu that are better than Brasero?
