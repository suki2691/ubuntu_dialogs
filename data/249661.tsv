2012-03-29T00:29:00.000Z	Luke	CFHowlett	i'm looking for the package name
2012-03-29T00:30:00.000Z	Luke	CFHowlett	oh I don't think thats what I'm looking for. I'm not trying to make fonts, I want to know what's responsible for rendering them on the gnome desktop
2012-03-29T00:34:00.000Z	Luke	CFHowlett	yeah I know how to change rendering settings - but it's the letter spacing that's incorrect for me
