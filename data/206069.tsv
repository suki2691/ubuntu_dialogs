2005-11-26T16:49:00.000Z	TCTCH		IRC: question: how can talk directly to a person (so that he sees the text in "red"?)
2005-11-26T16:50:00.000Z	LjL	TCTCH	by typing her nickname
2005-11-26T16:50:00.000Z	LjL	TCTCH	and it's a function of the specific IRC client anyway, not something you do
2005-11-26T16:50:00.000Z	TCTCH	LjL	ahh...ok
