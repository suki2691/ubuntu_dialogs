2011-06-12T22:12:00.000Z	HimPhoenix		hi, I have problems recongnizing a command of a programme which I have in multiple versions, because it always runs the oldest version of the program and I want to refer to newest one, how could I fix it? I think is about $PATH
2011-06-12T22:12:00.000Z	escott	HimPhoenix	put the path to the newest one first in $PATH
2011-06-12T22:13:00.000Z	HimPhoenix	escott	at the first place of the $PATH ?
2011-06-12T22:13:00.000Z	escott	HimPhoenix	doesn't have to be first just has to be before the other
