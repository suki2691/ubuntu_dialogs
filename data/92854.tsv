2008-06-07T05:50:00.000Z	musikgoat	mshanks	could be that the file is not supported,  missing codecs possibly
2008-06-07T05:51:00.000Z	mshanks	musikgoat	ok, once I know what codec the movie was encoded with, how do I see if I have that codec?
2008-06-07T05:54:00.000Z	musikgoat	mshanks	there is a single package that contains alot, ubuntu-restricted-extras
