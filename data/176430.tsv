2007-01-28T10:40:00.000Z	Jimmey		I've just put a new heatsink into a computer that's been off for quite some time. When the computer originally booted, the CPU was at 40degrees. It's steadily risen over the course of about 15 minutes to 46. Should I be worried about this?
2007-01-28T10:42:00.000Z	AlexC_	Jimmey	that isn't really Ubuntu related, but did you put Thermal Paste/compound between the CPU and heatsink first?
2007-01-28T10:42:00.000Z	Jimmey	AlexC_	Sorry about that - didn't know where else to ask. And yeah..
2007-01-28T10:52:00.000Z	AlexC_	Jimmey	yeah rendering is a very cpu intensive process
