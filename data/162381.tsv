2006-10-26T14:38:00.000Z	jdhoreOTG		i have a question, it's prolly pretty common, but it's something i want to find out
2006-10-26T14:40:00.000Z	jdhoreOTG		i use Debian and i installed Ubuntu on my dad's computer so he could try out Linux (and Ubuntu is, IMO a bit mor noobish version of Debian) in debian, i can su to be root for a terminal session, in Ubuntu, i can't, why can't i su in Ubuntu?
2006-10-26T14:41:00.000Z	jdhoreOTG		i know about sudo, but i'd rather be root for all commands if i'm doing a lot of stuff
2006-10-26T14:41:00.000Z	morphish	jdhoreOTG	sudo su - or su - still work for me!?
