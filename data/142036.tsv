2007-09-09T09:40:00.000Z	h1st0	dylock	that is the best bet then any time you reinstall you just make the installer aware that /home is seperate and all your data and settings are there.  With the exception of programs.
2007-09-09T09:41:00.000Z	dylock	h1st0	ok, so backup my /home ( i guess ill make a copy of it on the other harddrive, and then when i install i specify the /home on that harddrive?
