2007-01-22T12:04:00.000Z	eisma		could anyone walk me through installing java and flash on ubuntu?
2007-01-22T12:05:00.000Z	Flannel	eisma	for flash (you want flash9), it's in the backports repository, see !backports if you need help enabling it
2007-01-26T12:42:00.000Z	Flannel	eisma	dpkg has a lot of stuff, you should be able to remove it wihout installing it
2007-01-26T12:43:00.000Z	Flannel	eisma	probably with --force-remove-reinstreq, depends on which state the package is currently in
