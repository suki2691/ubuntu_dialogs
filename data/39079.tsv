2011-05-14T05:57:00.000Z	Max-P		 Hi, I just installed an Ubuntu-Server on my system to get a minimal Ubuntu setup. Does anyone know why an empty system with about 30 jobs in console-only takes more than 200 Mb? My older debian install took only about 40 Mb. Why is it so RAM hungry?

2011-05-14T06:01:00.000Z	tucemiux	Max-P	 well this is an ubuntu channel, not for ubuntu server,  then debian and ubuntu server are different, minimal doesnt necessarily mean it will use less memory, dont install any services on ubuntu server and youll have low memory usage
