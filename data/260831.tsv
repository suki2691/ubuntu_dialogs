2004-11-09T14:08:00.000Z	paulproteus	nozzle	I agree absolutely.
2004-11-09T14:10:00.000Z	paulproteus	nozzle	Sure thing.  It's good to see people who are willing to do the reading.  There's a problem in Linuxland where the documentation isn't quite as focused as it should be, but the reward of running Debian GNU/Linux is high.
