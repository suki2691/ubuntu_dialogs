2004-11-21T17:06:00.000Z	unperson	jjh	Yeah, my guess is that if I remove and re-add it in network settings that'd do it.  I was a bit afraid of messing something up, but I'll try it.  brb.
2004-11-21T17:36:00.000Z	unperson	jjh	You were right.  Removed my NIC entry in Network Settings and added it as a wireless card and all the options appeared.  I still wonder why it setup that way by default, though.
