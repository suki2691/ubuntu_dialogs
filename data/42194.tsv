2009-11-24T08:25:00.000Z	knoppies		Something is wrong with my VNC setup. Im in 9.04, using the default VINO server. When I log on using tightvncvweier (windows client) it takes a snapshot, and then doesnt update the image on the client (mouse/keyboard respond on ubuntu)
2009-11-24T08:26:00.000Z	knoppies		any ideas whats causing it/how to fix it?
