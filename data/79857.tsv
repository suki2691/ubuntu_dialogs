2010-04-29T18:11:00.000Z	geekphreak	subone	 you can use ubuntu on a pendrive
2010-04-29T18:13:00.000Z	subone	geekphreak	yes but my computer wont boot from USB, i need to boot from the CD and then somehow redirect to boot from the USB drive or tell the live cd that the files are on the USB drive so that install doesnt break in the middle while cd drive fails
2010-04-29T18:14:00.000Z	geekphreak	subone	 good luck with that one mate
