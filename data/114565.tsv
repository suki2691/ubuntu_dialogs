2007-11-02T21:15:00.000Z	tadah		Hello, I'm in failsafe mode now. Everything's cool here. But if I try to go on normal GNOME session, I enter my login and password, it starts loading, then the screen goes black and throws me back into the login screen. How could I fix it? Thanks

2007-11-02T21:17:00.000Z	tadah	bluefox83	any ideas how to solve it? :/
