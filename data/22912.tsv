2010-11-12T20:23:00.000Z	evdvelde		okay... a no go for a non-testing system thus :)
2010-11-12T20:24:00.000Z	claude2	evdvelde	ive read that btrfs is still pretty slow at this point
2010-11-12T20:25:00.000Z	evdvelde	claude2	i have read phoronix tests that say it is quite fast, and very fast with compression enabled
