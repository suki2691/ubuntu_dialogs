2011-07-02T23:54:00.000Z	jo-erlend	Jakman85	support is often a relative term. I would just test it and see how well it works.
2011-07-02T23:57:00.000Z	Jakman85	jo-erlend	i understand, but i am just making sure he has the correct driver and actually took the time to see if his card is supported. If it is, then we dive deeper
2011-07-02T23:58:00.000Z	jo-erlend	Jakman85	oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were talking to someone in particular. I thought it was your question. :)
