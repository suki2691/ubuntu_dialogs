2010-01-01T06:44:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009		I'm thinking of trying 9.10 out once again to see if things have improved with audio. I was gonna take my 9.10 standard CD and use ubuntu customization kit to make a disk like there selling on on-disk.com 9.10-10.01 (9.10 with all integrated updates as of Jan 2010).Pretty easy to do. So whats the deal with pulseaudio? Did they change anything with it or is it the same unreliable crap that it has been in the past?
2010-01-01T06:45:00.000Z	mezquitale	LinuxGuy2009	i've had mixed results in both my laptop and desktop, pulse audio doesn't really work flawlessly in karmic
2010-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	mezquitale		is there an admin that can take care of a couple of trolls?
2010-01-01T06:46:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	mezquitale	That sucks. If 10.04 LTS is this bad then Im staying with pure Debian from now on, its much more reliable and stable.
