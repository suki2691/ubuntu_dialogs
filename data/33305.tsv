2011-04-16T22:30:00.000Z	Steve^		Is it a bad sign if my PC does alot of disk checks on startup?
2011-04-16T22:31:00.000Z	rumpe1	Steve^	if it happens on every boot without interruption by pressing c.... maybe there's a hardware problem
2011-04-16T22:33:00.000Z	Steve^	rumpe1	it's not everytime but it seems very often and it takes forever. I'll keep an eye out thanks
2011-04-16T22:35:00.000Z	rumpe1	Steve^	too shorten the usual checks an idea would be to transfer the stuff you seldom need on an extra partition, which you only mount, when you need it...
