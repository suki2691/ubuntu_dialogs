2011-01-19T09:21:00.000Z	schwinn434		I tried to boot my Ubuntu 10.10 machine today; wouldn't boot  until I booted using the previous  kernel version (grub menu option to use previous kernel) of linux
2011-01-19T09:21:00.000Z	schwinn434		Should I just keep booting using the previous kernel?
2011-01-19T09:21:00.000Z	schwinn434		it works okay - as far as I can tell
2011-01-19T09:21:00.000Z	jook	schwinn434	what's the command for that? Looks like the problem I'm having too, and it might help
