2011-03-09T21:01:00.000Z	Camarata	Ubuntu_Fedora	10.04 is an LTS version which means it is supported longer you are fine with that and many people will use that for servers that need long uptimes
2011-03-09T21:03:00.000Z	Camarata	Ubuntu_Fedora	 http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/ubuntu-63/ubuntu-desktop-vs-ubuntu-server-462043/ - that would be a decent forum read on the differences, usually updating from 10.04 to 10.10 is just a simple terminal command, I can't remember if it's a new kernel version and would need a reboot but there are no problems with running LAMP stacks or other such stuff on 10.10 at all
