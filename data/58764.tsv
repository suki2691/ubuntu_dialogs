2009-05-06T10:19:00.000Z	sparr		is there a way to get my mouse to ignore double clicks (on any button) shorter than a certain duration?  i need a low level solution that will affect games as well as the GUI
2009-05-06T10:21:00.000Z	frenzy_usa	sparr	increase the timeout of the double-click speed.  System -> Preferences -> Mouse
2009-05-06T10:21:00.000Z	sparr	frenzy_usa	that only affects the left mousebutton
2009-05-06T10:22:00.000Z	sparr	frenzy_usa	and I am not interested in the GUI "doubleclick"
