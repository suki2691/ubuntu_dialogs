2009-01-15T20:18:00.000Z	blizzo		im having a seriously annoying problem. i upgraded my 32 bit ubuntu 8.04 to have 8GB of memory. i had to install server headers to get it all to recognize. this all worked, but now tons of dialogue boxes are completely black and such. i have been using this install flawlessly for a long while with no issues. help! :)
