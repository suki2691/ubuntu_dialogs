I clicked "revert" on menu changes I made, and it reverted the structure but just deleted any things I had in custom folders I made... how do I restore them?

2011-04-16T11:33:00.000Z	MK``	syrinx_	 I mean, I pressed delete on a folder, but for whatever reason, it moved up to its parent and deleted that. it wasn't the root menu for everything, just that group I was working on
