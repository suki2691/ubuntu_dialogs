2011-04-16T13:29:00.000Z	WaltherFI	bullgard4	that's a good question. the startup apps work very weirdly
2011-04-16T13:30:00.000Z	bullgard4	WaltherFI	Thank you for your sentiment.
2011-04-16T13:31:00.000Z	WaltherFI	bullgard4	i mean, there are some weird registry entries or smoething for the startup apps despite the .config; i've had problems with not getting autostart apps to stop autostarting
