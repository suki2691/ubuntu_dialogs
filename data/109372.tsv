2012-05-15T05:28:00.000Z	Ikelos_		Hello all, I hate to interrupt the discussions, but I recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 via wubi on my thinkpad t61 with Windows 7 and after the intial boot, it will no longer boot into ubuntu.  Just before the purple splash screen as it does some checks it mentions something about some NTFS thing failing.  I rand the windows memory tool, but nothing ever came of it.  My windows partition seems to be working fine - has anyone experience
