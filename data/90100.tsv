2008-05-27T13:06:00.000Z	acech		I have been using Ubuntu for a couple of days now without problem. This morning when trying to login some error occurs and it returns me to the logon prompt. The last time I used it was the first time I used ssh to logon and export the display to another machine, but is there any way to find out specifically what error is occuring?
