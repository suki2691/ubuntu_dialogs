2007-01-27T12:23:00.000Z	sdac_1x		hi,  i was installing a .deb package using the builtin debian package manager on Xubnutu edgy.  After installing it told me there was a problem and the software asked me to run "sudo apt-get install -f".  After running that command, it seems to be removing applications.  Suddenly the desktop disappeared and now I cannot boot into xubuntu.  It simply freezes before entering the login screen.
