2012-06-03T06:44:00.000Z	Heridan		Hi, is anybody here willing to help me with some questions concerning ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS, especially about screen and java?
2012-06-03T06:44:00.000Z	bwayne	Heridan	I've used screen some, but recently i've started using tmux and haven't looked back.
2012-06-03T06:45:00.000Z	Heridan	bwayne	So is this a yes or do you want me to look for someone else? :)
2012-06-03T06:46:00.000Z	bwayne	Heridan	well, if you're wanting java help, then definitely someone else.  :-)  maybe even in #java or something.
