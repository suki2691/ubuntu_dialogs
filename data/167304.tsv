2010-01-30T18:48:00.000Z	jrib	winterweaver	PIL is in the repositories
2010-01-30T18:48:00.000Z	winterweaver	jrib	i am aware, but this is for a sandbox install
2010-01-30T18:49:00.000Z	jrib	winterweaver	I don't see why that matters, but if you insist, what faileas said will give you the dependencies for the package in the repositories which are likely to be similar for what you are doing
