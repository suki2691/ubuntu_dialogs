2006-04-19T13:39:00.000Z	mbschonfeld		hey guys.  First of all, gotta say I love Ubuntu.
2006-04-19T13:40:00.000Z	mbschonfeld		I've been using it for a couple months now and like it more than any other distro I've used.
2006-04-19T13:41:00.000Z	mbschonfeld		I was wondering though, my question isn't about Ubuntu, but about open-source software in general - any irc channels I could ask questions in, I don't want to spam up this one.
