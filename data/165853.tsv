2009-06-04T08:21:00.000Z	johnfg		Kind of a strange question: I just installed 9.04, it went flawlessly, btw.  I thought I was installing server, as that's how I had the dvd labeled   But, how can I be sure that this is server, not desktop (not that it matters that much)?
2009-06-04T08:21:00.000Z	dthacker	johnfg	do you have a GUI?
