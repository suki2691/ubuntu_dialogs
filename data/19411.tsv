2012-09-01T19:16:00.000Z	etteyafed		Hi everyone. I am preparing to install the new 12.04.1 LTS release on my laptop (replacing an older Ubuntu install) and I have a couple of quick questions about prefered cpu architecture. Anyone up for it? Really should be fairly straight forward for anyone that has been using ubuntu regularly lately.
2012-09-01T19:18:00.000Z	etteyafed		 So for a new install of 12.04.1 LTS should I still go with the 32 bit or would 64 bit be better now?
2012-09-01T19:19:00.000Z	etteyafed		My HW can handle 64 bit and I prefer to use it. Just that in the past I have had a couple of minor issues with 64 bit.
2012-09-01T19:20:00.000Z	k1l	etteyafed	just go with 64bit if your cpu can handle that
