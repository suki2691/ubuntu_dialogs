2009-04-25T05:27:00.000Z	mondo		is there any bug about cpu freq on 9.04? because my frequency is 800MHz but there is too much noise from cpu fan ?
2009-04-25T05:28:00.000Z	mikechelen	mondo	you could check system monitor and see if cpu usage is high
2009-04-25T05:29:00.000Z	mondo	mikechelen	interesting thing is mo cpu usage, 800MHz freq. but too much noise, i hadnt such that problem 8.10
2009-04-25T05:31:00.000Z	mikechelen	mondo	is that from variable speed cpu fan? maybe search for your mobo model
