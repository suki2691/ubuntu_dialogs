2012-10-29T12:53:00.000Z	Doxin[jerb]		my server has horrible time slip, something on the order of 25000 seconds on a bad day, what is the reccomended way to keep this in check? (has to be within 3 minutes of the correct time)
2012-10-29T12:55:00.000Z	rumpe1	Doxin[jerb]	you could synchronize the clock every 3mins to an ntp-server :>
2012-10-29T12:55:00.000Z	Doxin[jerb]		lol
2012-10-29T12:56:00.000Z	Doxin[jerb]	rumpe1	I'm having it sync every hour actually atm, but that's a rather fugly solution
