2011-05-03T14:23:00.000Z	tic^	sdollins	I'm running 10.04 LTS 64bit on a dell 64bit desktop and EVERYTHING works, including sound and youtube. A stable setup can be done.
2011-05-03T14:33:00.000Z	tic^	sdollins	10.04 works very well. Install on a fesh clean drive, setup what you want and then STOP upgrading. It will remain stable that way.
