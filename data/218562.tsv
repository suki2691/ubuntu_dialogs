2010-11-01T20:20:00.000Z	vinion2000		ok let me try again, i have Ubuntu maverick, and a microsft usb mouse on a amd2600/bostar motherboard i also have an old ibm think pad with hardy on it. the problem is the mouse works perfect in hardy but crashes. freezes, and turns off in maverick. any solutions
2010-11-01T20:22:00.000Z	vinion2000		anyone?
2010-11-01T20:22:00.000Z	sipior	vinion2000	does it freeze instantly, or is there a common trigger?
2010-11-01T20:35:00.000Z	sipior	vinion2000	if you run directly from an ubuntu live cd of maverick, does the problem persist?
