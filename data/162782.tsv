2007-03-13T06:17:00.000Z	ThinkingMan		one more quick question, on my previous install I was dual booting XP and ubuntu, now I'm booting Vista and Ubuntu, before I found a driver for windows to read ext2 partitions, but apparently that won't work in vista
2007-03-13T06:18:00.000Z	ThinkingMan		So ideas on a filesystem to share data between ubuntu/vista?
