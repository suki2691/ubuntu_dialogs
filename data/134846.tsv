2007-05-15T12:53:00.000Z	Flannel	mattwalston	what do you mean by "active"?
2007-05-15T12:55:00.000Z	mattwalston	Flannel	more specifically... are enough people using the lts version so that I can get help if I need it?  If i plan on relying on irc and forums, what version would you suggest?
2007-05-15T12:55:00.000Z	Flannel	mattwalston	yeah, LTS is still alive and well.  Uh, Feisty (or Edgy) have newer versions of software (firefox 2, etc), you might want that.
