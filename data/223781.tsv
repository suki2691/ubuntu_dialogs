2010-08-09T05:35:00.000Z	StrangerDanger		I get an error upgrading to 9.10 from 9.04 and I do not know what the next step is to try and fix it.
2010-08-09T05:35:00.000Z	StrangerDanger		I have tried to google the error and I find nothing. The error is - Can not mark 'ubuntu-desktop' for upgrade
2010-08-09T05:36:00.000Z	StrangerDanger		I do not remember doing anything like that
