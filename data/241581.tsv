2005-04-24T05:08:00.000Z	yyc747__		I have a friend who recently got a free old iMac.  I want him to use linux, but he has been resistant. he's willing to try it on this iMac.  will hoary ppc be high enough quality to win him over?

2005-04-24T05:11:00.000Z	imperfect-	yyc747__	I'm telling you.. it's the best of both worlds
