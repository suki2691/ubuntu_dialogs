2006-03-08T13:31:00.000Z	Psykus		anyone have a clue why unreal tournament 2004 would have no sound, unless I launched it from a terminal?
2006-03-08T13:32:00.000Z	Psykus		i created a shortcut to it in gnome, and when I use that, there's no sound, however, when I navigate to the directory and do ./ut2004 , the sound works
2006-03-08T13:33:00.000Z	once1er	Psykus	does the shortcut properly set the working directory?
