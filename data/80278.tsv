2008-09-14T14:24:00.000Z	cads		can someone help me set up a flash player alternative with firefox? Flash player crashes my sound server and my system. I tried using gnash but it doesn't work with youtube video, and the mozilla plugin using  swfdec  doesn't seem to work with firefox 3.
2008-09-14T14:24:00.000Z	cads		does anyone have ideas?
