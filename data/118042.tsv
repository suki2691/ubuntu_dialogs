2011-09-03T19:01:00.000Z	Antony		guys, i'm stuck with this perl script
2011-09-03T19:01:00.000Z	Antony		i'm running ubuntu server
2011-09-03T19:02:00.000Z	Antony		and it is chmodded 755 - i can run it, root can run it - but no other users can. even if the user is in the same group - any ideas?
2011-09-03T19:02:00.000Z	yeats	Antony	where is the script located?  In your home dir?
