2010-05-21T10:54:00.000Z	Severian	pallgone	yes, but it needs a little help.  You need a greasemonkey script to fool youtube.  I have demonstrated it at local computer groups.
2010-05-21T10:55:00.000Z	pallgone	Severian	ok, i need gnash, greasemonkey, a script and I bet it doesn't work on hulu and others
2010-05-21T10:56:00.000Z	Severian	pallgone	I have not tried this hulu thing.  It is just tv shows and I don't watch or own a tv.
