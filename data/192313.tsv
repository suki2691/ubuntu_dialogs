2006-04-24T08:05:00.000Z	harisund	backz	Depends on what you are looking for. I have a successful Ubuntu machine running File server, SSH server, telnet server, gnump3d music streaming server, VLC video streaming server, and samba server
2006-04-24T08:08:00.000Z	backz	harisund	must I use Xorg on a apache2/samba/squid server?
2006-04-24T08:09:00.000Z	harisund	backz	Nope, I don't have it running for apache2 and samba, but I don't know about squid though. I wouldn't expect it though.
