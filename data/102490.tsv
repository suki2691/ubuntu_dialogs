2008-12-21T14:16:00.000Z	Letter_Z		My iPod keeps disconnecting halfway through transfers, I know its a problem with Ubuntu because my iPod doesn't do this on other OSs or other computers. Its getting to be annoying because I need to get some files off of it and I'm sick of it demounting halfway through. Whats the problem with it?

2008-12-21T14:17:00.000Z	Letter_Z		But it just keeps randomly demounting
