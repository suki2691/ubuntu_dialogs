2007-08-24T05:58:00.000Z	ilrepo		Hi, I just broke my /etc/sudoers file and cannot use it anymore, syntax error/parse error on line x... what should I do?
2007-08-24T05:59:00.000Z	Ursinha	ilrepo	do you have a root user?
2007-08-24T06:00:00.000Z	ilrepo	Ursinha	what do you mean? if it doesn't come as default then I don't have it
2007-08-24T06:01:00.000Z	Ursinha	ilrepo	uh, so you don't have one :/
