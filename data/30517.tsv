2010-06-24T11:14:00.000Z	raj	ubutom_	 yes :) its a TEW 644UB i had to get wireless backport modules to get it working
2010-06-24T11:16:00.000Z	ubutom_	raj	no, I meant the router, not the adapter, some devices tend to use a mixed mode or something, for example my router'S default behaviour was to use b/g and I set it to just use g
2010-06-24T11:17:00.000Z	ubutom_	raj	you could try disabling the other modes, maybe that'S enough to fix it :)
