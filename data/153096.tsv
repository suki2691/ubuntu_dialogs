2007-06-13T11:58:00.000Z	bayzider		I have Fluxbox installed, and when I right click on my Desktop to luanch an app it just has a small box that says Fluxbox on it. How do I fix my install so that I can use it?

2007-06-13T11:59:00.000Z	bayzider	IndyGunFreak	You think the package might be corrupted or something?
