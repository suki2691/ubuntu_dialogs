2008-08-17T15:40:00.000Z	Laptopuser		I have a problem! I installed ubuntu and now my internet is terribly slow.. it is a known issue! I was very disappointed.. also tried a couple of fixes and it still doesn't work. What is the best alternative for Ubuntu in terms of automatic updates, user friendliness and "it just works"
