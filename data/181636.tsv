2006-09-20T13:46:00.000Z	boink		I needed to do my own kernel when using some vortex raid controllers since neither the debian kernel nor the latest linux kernel had the latest drivers
2006-09-20T13:47:00.000Z	boink		there is a nice debian way of making the kernel, which puts the kernel into a .deb
2006-09-20T13:49:00.000Z	orinoco	boink	i mean that it is worth taking out all the rubish that loads the precompiled kernel?
