2008-02-11T21:34:00.000Z	Ackdar		once again, so the newly joining can see it... I seem to be having network problems on Ubuntu... how am I supposed to connect to the internet with my modem? I entered all the needed info, including DNS, but it won't dial. Also, I am not able to access my router over ethernet. >_<
2008-02-11T21:35:00.000Z	noodlesgc	Ackdar	do you have hsfmodem installed?
2008-02-11T21:35:00.000Z	Ackdar	noodlesgc	I used the restricted driver that was available on installation of ubuntu
2008-02-11T21:37:00.000Z	noodlesgc	Ackdar	Ive never used my modem before so I dont know how, but Ive heard that gnome-ppp helps
