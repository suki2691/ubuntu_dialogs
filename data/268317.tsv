2008-09-09T09:12:00.000Z	lucas_	mgonzalez	what?
2008-09-09T09:15:00.000Z	lucas_	mgonzalez	one way its editing the theme... placing specific icons with same name re pleasing icons of an original theme until you have them all like you want... once in /usr/share/icons edit permissions you other users can read them and owned by root...
2008-09-09T09:19:00.000Z	lucas_	mgonzalez	no problem!
