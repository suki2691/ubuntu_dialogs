2008-03-17T01:39:00.000Z	Frailmage		Hi, I am wondering if any one can help me with this. I am trying to find a simple server hosting software for Linux, I had originally tried Apache, but that went right over my head with the Linux version (I was originally trying to do it with Vista but that lead to frustration so I switched over to Ubuntu, as so I am very very new to using any Linux based OS)

2008-03-17T01:43:00.000Z	Frailmage		Sorry about that, then I asked befor but got no reply. But I am trying to find a very simple server hosting software for Ubuntu, as I am new at using any Linux based OS
