2009-06-09T21:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	irc-anope	 go read the xchat homepage/docs/forumns i guess..   I dont use botx in xchat.. if i did need a bot id use irssi, or a dedicated bot.
2009-06-09T21:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	irc-anope	 im saying i dont use xchat 'bots'  - xchat is very scriptable and could be used for a bot if you wanted.. I imagine htye have examples of such things at teh xchat homepage/scripts. I dont use them, so i dont know any more on the topic
