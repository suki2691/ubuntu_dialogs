2010-07-06T02:56:00.000Z	Ebuntu		oooooooooh
2010-07-06T02:56:00.000Z	Ebuntu		chmod -rw methinks opensourcery
2010-07-06T02:58:00.000Z	OpenSourcery	Ebuntu	chmod works on partitons too? i thought it was just for files and dirs not whole partitoins
2010-07-06T03:00:00.000Z	OpenSourcery	Ebuntu	and would the way to test if it works be to try and mount the partition w/o sudo?
