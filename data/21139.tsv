2010-12-30T10:18:00.000Z	racines		Anyone know why my Ubuntu installation will not boot? It has been stuck on: "_" and its just blinking
2010-12-30T10:18:00.000Z	racines		Then after a while the screen will go black
2010-12-30T10:18:00.000Z	racines		I just installed it onto a USB, did not use a swap partition though. Not sure why it won't boot
