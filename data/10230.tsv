2011-08-31T18:33:00.000Z	Younder	Thelmaria	That is the root passwd is not set effectively disabling it
2011-08-31T18:33:00.000Z	Thelmaria	Younder	I know that - but I got asked today for root password to update / run something, so I don't believe all the GUI's work off sudo. Don't ask what it was, though.
