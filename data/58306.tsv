2009-05-04T22:16:00.000Z	exodus_ms		Using 9.04 with nautilus 2.26.2. I use the "tabs" in nautilus so I can switch quickly from one directory to the other. Is there way to display "hidden" files in one tab but not the others?

2009-05-04T22:19:00.000Z	exodus_ms	sexybaaron	yeah, that works. Was just wondering if there was a way I could "set" it. To only apply to certain directories. I'm just lazy :P
