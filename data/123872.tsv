2009-03-05T06:59:00.000Z	snowveil		I'm trying to run an executable (freeware game, Cave Story), and when I run it by clicking on it in Nautilus it works fine, but trying to run it from terminal or from an application launcher, it opens then immediately closes
2009-03-05T06:59:00.000Z	snowveil		running from terminal yields no error messages unfortunately
2009-03-05T06:59:00.000Z	cdm10	snowveil	it might have to do with the directory it's launched from.
2009-03-05T07:00:00.000Z	cdm10	snowveil	I'm not sure, but it's possible that when double-clicking on an executable, Nautilus launches it within the folder it's in.
