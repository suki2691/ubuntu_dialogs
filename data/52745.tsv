2009-10-13T02:46:00.000Z	Dantonic		Hey I cannot connect to a remote system through SSH.  I run the command ssh user@host, it waits a while, asks for password, and after I enter it it closes the connection.  It works from another system off of the same router any ideas?
2009-10-13T02:46:00.000Z	Dantonic		I'm using openssh
2009-10-13T02:47:00.000Z	Dantonic		!ssh
