2009-01-16T07:45:00.000Z	ThePub		I've installed fluxbox and xdm, removing gdm, and for some reason now the totem plugin under firefox does not play movies.  I'm assuming something with Gnome, but what?  Any ideas?
2009-01-16T07:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	ThePub	 why did you bother removing gdm? that may of removed some other gnome related bits.
2009-01-16T07:46:00.000Z	ThePub	dr_willis	gdm has no gnome tidbits.
2009-01-16T07:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	ThePub	if you say so. then   following your logic gdm couldent of affected anything.. guess ya could prove it by reinstalling gdm and see.
