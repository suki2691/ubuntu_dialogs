2009-02-05T23:25:00.000Z	Industrial		Hi. I want to install the vim full version but the minimal version is installed. If I want to remove it with synaptic It will remove ubuntu-minimal which is ofcourse not what I want
2009-02-05T23:26:00.000Z	tv7497	Industrial	i guess sudo apt-get remove ________ should work and why do you want to remove other version
2009-02-05T23:27:00.000Z	Industrial	tv7497	because a minimal stripped down version is ofcourse inadequate for a text editor with a thousand bells and whistles :p
2009-02-05T23:27:00.000Z	Industrial	tv7497	eg I load my config file and commands are not supported.
