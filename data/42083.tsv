2009-11-22T12:35:00.000Z	zoetrope6		﻿Hi guys. I have a Toshiba TE2300 with Ubuntu Studio 9.04 installed. Recently my touchpad mouse stopped working. I plugged in a USB mouse and eventually that stopped working too. Then I plugged in an old school PS/2 mouse, and today that stopped working too. Any ideas what the problem could be?
2009-11-22T12:36:00.000Z	zoetrope6		I just stuck in a live disk of regular Ubuntu (version 9.04) and in live mode the touchpad mouse doesn't work, but the USB mouse seems to be working..
