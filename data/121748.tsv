2007-09-16T15:41:00.000Z	GreyWolfe		Hi, can anyone point me in the right direction to finding out the manufacturer of my motherboard? I want to update my BIOS but I need to know the manufacturer first.

2007-09-16T15:44:00.000Z	GreyWolfe	h1st0	It is an HP a1420n
2007-09-16T15:44:00.000Z	h1st0	GreyWolfe	ahh well if you just search on HPs site they will have a bios upgrade by model.  Are you sure you need one though?
