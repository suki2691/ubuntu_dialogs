2006-04-22T15:51:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Sharcho	Ubuntu 5.04, but you will need to first upgrade it to 5.10, then 6.06.
2006-04-22T15:53:00.000Z	Sharcho	tonyyarusso	aren't there any significant differences between the server editon and the normal edition? The 5.04 didn't have a server edition.
2006-04-22T15:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Sharcho	Ooh.  I forgot about that.  Still though, the packages will be compatible, and you can remove all the parts you don't need.  So, it will be slightly more hassle for you than non-server people, but still wiser to use Ubuntu to start than Debian.
