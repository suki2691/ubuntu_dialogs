2009-03-12T07:24:00.000Z	Raije		Just a quick question, If i'm using mplayer to play a dvd, do I have to mount the drive first? or will it do it?
2009-03-12T07:24:00.000Z	usser	Raije	no  you dont have to mount it
2009-03-12T07:25:00.000Z	Raije	usser	thanks, for some reason anytime I try it just freezes and won't play the disc :(
