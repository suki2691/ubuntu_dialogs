2009-10-21T19:58:00.000Z	Vock		I recently tried to do multiple monitors on my laptop, however, when I unplugged the external monitor, I'm stuck with 1024x768 resolution, and can't go higher. I have two black bars on the sides of my screen, indicating an improper aspect ratio? Any ideas how to fix this?
