2009-10-12T05:16:00.000Z	StarLionIsaac		I've been using the proprietary Nvidia driver, and it's been working fine except for another kernel module I've been trying to install, is there a FOSS/OSS alternative?
2009-10-12T05:16:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	StarLionIsaac	the oss nvidia driver is "nv" <- in xorg for driver.  if i where you though, i'd ditch the unified-kernel thing.
2009-10-12T05:17:00.000Z	StarLionIsaac	ZykoticK9	well, I was going to try it to see if the rumours were right about it being more win32 app compatible than just wine, but if consensus says to leave it, leave it it is then
