2009-09-14T20:56:00.000Z	ChrizC		hey, how do you open a rar file with Ubuntu 8.04?
2009-09-14T20:57:00.000Z	NakidGirl_With_I	ChrizC	"unrar" or use 7z
2009-09-14T20:57:00.000Z	ChrizC	NakidGirl_With_I	It doesn't let me sudo apt-get "unrar"
2009-09-14T21:00:00.000Z	ChrizC	NakidGirl_With_I	does 7z work fully under WINE?
