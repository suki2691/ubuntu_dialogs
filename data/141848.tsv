2007-08-27T13:52:00.000Z	parkbench		can anyone help? I have this: Intel PRO/Wireless 3945AB mini-pci, which I just purchased for my laptop because it is supposed to be compatible with linux. i cant get it to recognize by the system, even by the lspci command
2007-08-27T13:53:00.000Z	SeveredCross	parkbench	That's very odd...I have a 3945ABG and it gets recognized right off the bat.
2007-08-27T13:53:00.000Z	SeveredCross	parkbench	It shouldn't matter...
2007-08-27T13:54:00.000Z	SeveredCross	parkbench	Hmm..lspci finds nothing.
