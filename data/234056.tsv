2008-08-21T07:51:00.000Z	Maahes		I have a rather annoying problem: currenly ubuntu is only recognizing my touchpad. I plug in a USB mouse? Nothing
2008-08-21T07:52:00.000Z	andax	Maahes	usb mice are no longer supported, didn't you hear that?
2008-08-21T07:54:00.000Z	andax	Maahes	you already have two input devices. keyboard and touchpad. you got 3 hands?
2008-08-21T07:55:00.000Z	andax	Maahes	seriously, something's really wrong there, give us a dmesg | tail output please after you have connected / disconnected the mouse.
