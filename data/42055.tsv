2012-11-11T05:15:00.000Z	BobJonkman	ikonia	It may be possible to map from a WinXP computer to a Win7 share if you have admin rights on one of the computers (can't remember which one needs admin rights, or if both do).  And I don't have enough computers running Windows to be able to test...
2012-11-11T05:16:00.000Z	BobJonkman	ikonia	Do you authenticate to the Win7 computer with admin credentials?
2012-11-11T05:16:00.000Z	ikonia	BobJonkman	no
