2009-02-26T02:42:00.000Z	Nytrix		i try to install a theme and it tells me i need "GTK+ theme engine" but doesnt tell me exactly the one i need to install
2009-02-26T02:43:00.000Z	Nytrix		yeah im looking now
2009-02-26T02:43:00.000Z	bernz	Nytrix	you *might* have some luck with 'aptitude'; i could be wrong, but i think it has a good ability to find dependencies and automagically add them to your "shopping cart" for installation
2009-02-26T02:44:00.000Z	bernz	Nytrix	(in which case, you can probably select the "main" thing you need -- gtk+ theme engine -- and it'll select everything else you need for htat)
