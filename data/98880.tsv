2008-07-01T16:32:00.000Z	Chicoinc		Ok now i (the error message) says only mount can dev/sdb1 as /media/Disk_2
2008-07-01T16:33:00.000Z	legend2440	Chicoinc	did you rename the /media/Disk 2 to /media Disk_2?
2008-07-01T16:39:00.000Z	legend2440	Chicoinc	you can delete line 13 since line 8 already mounts the swap file
2008-07-01T16:55:00.000Z	legend2440	Chicoinc	in line 11     /media Disk_2  should be /media/Disk_2 you forgot the   /
