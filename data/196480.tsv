2006-03-17T09:44:00.000Z	tyler_	V4Vendetta	thanks, but how can I get xmms to play when I am logged in from another machine through the shell?  I run:   'xmms playlist.pls &'   remotely, but nothing shows up on the local machine and no sound output.  Also the process dies shortly afterward
2006-03-17T09:45:00.000Z	V4Vendetta	tyler_	dunno sorry
2006-03-17T09:45:00.000Z	tyler_	V4Vendetta	basically I want to be able to control my sound system from my other computer, anywhere in the house
