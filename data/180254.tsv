2011-09-20T20:14:00.000Z	TheKirbStomp		I am trying to teach myself a couple of computer languages for programming. I have a prior knowledge of HTML, but that is it. Suggestions?
2011-09-20T20:15:00.000Z	jrib	TheKirbStomp	python... #python for more info
2011-09-20T20:22:00.000Z	jrib	TheKirbStomp	I'd suggest you at least look at some higher level language as well and then decide.  But this conversation belongs in #ubuntu-offtopic
