2007-05-04T11:25:00.000Z	Luis07		hi, can someone tell me how to format in FAT16 a MicroSD card located in "/media/SD" using fdisk?
2007-05-04T11:25:00.000Z	eck	Luis07	fdisk is only for partitioning, not formatting
2007-05-04T11:27:00.000Z	Luis07	eck	oops sorry, didn't know that... then, how can I format it?
2007-05-04T11:28:00.000Z	eck	Luis07	i believe the package is dosfstools
