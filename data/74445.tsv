2010-08-12T03:21:00.000Z	Harry_Slaughter	a3Dman	it's not a nickname :) and in love with ubuntu after only one day... bye bye fedora
2010-08-12T03:21:00.000Z	a3Dman	Harry_Slaughter	same, I wanted a stable desktop that's the only reason I use ubuntu
2010-08-12T03:22:00.000Z	Harry_Slaughter	a3Dman	i did go a bit crazy and install compiz-fusion though :) that's pretty sick too, but it also doesn't seem 100% stable
