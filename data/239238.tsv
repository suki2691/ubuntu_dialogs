2006-12-29T07:58:00.000Z	ken		When one opens a new tab in firefox, one expects a clean URL bar, with the focus on the URL, but when i open a new tab, the URL bar is already filled with the web address of my previous tab, and moreover the cursor blinks on the URL bar so i have to backspace that whole address, and type in my new address. Whereas actually when one opens a new tab, one should see a clean url bar, so that one can start typing the new web addressright away. How do i change this behav
