2007-09-24T16:54:00.000Z	sasa		hey all....I thing I'm in deep crap...I tried to update to the latest version using update manager. I was having trouble so I ran gpg in the terminal, aborted it, then ran the update manager again. Now it says "Upgrading Ubuntu to version 6.10". I thought the version was 7.x!! I would hate to have my computer run for an hour and not accomplish anything. Please help!!!
2007-09-24T16:55:00.000Z	sasa		I forgot to mention that there is no button to stop the install
2007-09-24T16:56:00.000Z	sasa		how can I check what my current installed version of ubuntu is??
