2009-08-31T23:27:00.000Z	WACOMalt	jetole	is there a tutorial on setting it up this way? I dont have linux yet to be able to do apt-get
2009-08-31T23:28:00.000Z	jetole	WACOMalt	I don't know. Google it. I know once you have the USB disk creator it will allow you to use the free space on your disk as the Documents dir
