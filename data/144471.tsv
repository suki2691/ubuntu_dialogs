2007-11-28T05:02:00.000Z	jc		That's a good question iGeek asked, and not sure if there's a good answer from Debian / Ubuntu... Question: How to get a list of files a package installed (like rpm -ql)?
2007-11-28T05:02:00.000Z	crdlb	jc	dpkg -L package
2007-11-28T05:03:00.000Z	jc		I was thinking   apt-cache show pkgname   would do the trick, but I guess not always?
2007-11-28T05:03:00.000Z	jc	crdlb	Ok, good, thank you.
