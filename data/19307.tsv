2012-07-31T12:08:00.000Z	canobi		Hey all. A quick one - my displayport is not working in precise, but does on fedora 17. I suppose it's xorg 1.12 that I need, and tried to install it from x swat lts backports repo. The problem is I don't know how - if I try to install xorg-server-lts-backports it tries to uninstall all of the desktop components I have (kde). Any way I can install it without affecting the rest? BTW, not running pure precise, but rather mint KDE.
