2009-10-23T11:24:00.000Z	stuhlbein		hello! somehow i managed to screw up my root partition on ubuntu by doing a misconfigured installation of uClibc. and since i'm not able to boot it anymore (i got a huge bunch of ld.so-related assertion-failures, and a kernelpanic) i don't really want to rescue the root partition, but my /home partition. would i be able to do this with ubuntu 7.04, or should i grad jaunty instead? i really, REALLY don't want to lose my home partition. :(

2009-10-23T11:26:00.000Z	maco	stuhlbein	2. 8.04 and newer can install on the same partition without losing /home directory. if you actually have a /home partition, any version is fine
2009-10-23T11:27:00.000Z	stuhlbein	maco	yeah, i do have infact /home as a independent partiton, but i didn't see any option to use it in 7.04, that's why i asked... anyway, i already downloaded a copy of 9.04, so i think i'll try it with 9.04
