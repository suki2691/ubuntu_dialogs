2012-02-23T14:10:00.000Z	ft_mn		Hello, I have the $FILE='my file' variable which contains a file name.. the $FILE changes all the time so i want to put the '\' before every ' ' char in order to can use it with the mv command?? how is possible to put \ before every space character? it has to be something with sed right?

2012-02-23T14:13:00.000Z	ft_mn	syddraf	what do you mean? i want to do: mv *txt $FILE.txt ....  But what if $FILE= "name with spaces"
