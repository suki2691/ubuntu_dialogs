2009-04-22T23:23:00.000Z	akritiko		hello guys. A quick question. I have an Asus eeePC 1000h. Earlier at office I had to use is as my main machine and I plugged in it the keyboard and the mouse I use at office. Now that I opened the machine at home the keyboard does not respond appropriate. E.g. when I hit k, I get 2, when l, I get 3 and so on.
