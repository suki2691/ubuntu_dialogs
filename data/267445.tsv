2010-11-25T09:27:00.000Z	RMatt		Okay, its kinda complex.
2010-11-25T09:29:00.000Z	RMatt		so my dad got me an ubuntu live disk. I put it in, get to the very end of the install, and it stops. Cant do anything. So my step dad tells me to eject the disk and reboot. Well, ubuntu hadnt finished, and i cant overwrite the original partition. What should i do?
