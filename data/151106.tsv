2012-08-22T21:20:00.000Z	Guest54823		hi everyone, i'm trying to get my webcam working for skype, but there are some issues (continuous green flashes when camera turns on)
2012-08-22T21:21:00.000Z	Guest54823		i've checked lsusb and my camera shows up, and it works with uvc according to a website
2012-08-22T21:21:00.000Z	jano_	Guest54823	is it UVC standard caamera?
2012-08-22T21:22:00.000Z	jano_	Guest54823	I had the same issue - video OK but NO sound
