2010-10-29T00:18:00.000Z	f00bar80		I'm on ubuntu 10.04 trying to set it as a web server, I've registered a domain name, i'm asking what do i need to use it as my hostname ???, in the "how to forge" "Perfect server" guide found the hostname is in the form "server.example.com", so how can i use my domain name the same way ? also how to set NameServers too ???
2010-10-29T00:20:00.000Z	f00bar80		any comment ???
