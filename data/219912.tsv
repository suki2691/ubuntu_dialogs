2008-09-19T14:58:00.000Z	snakeacid		how can i see what a kernel version i have 64 bit or 32 bit?
2008-09-19T15:00:00.000Z	snakeacid		when i do uname -r i get 2.6.24-19-generic is generic 32 bit?
2008-09-19T15:00:00.000Z	Flannel	snakeacid	do uname -a, and read the second to the last part
2008-09-19T15:01:00.000Z	Flannel	snakeacid	I guess that'd be uname -m
