2009-10-25T12:05:00.000Z	kandjar		one quick question: i m installing the 9.10 server beta; partition wise: it set ext4 by default; but i heard of some instability with this new model. which is the advise one?

2009-10-25T12:06:00.000Z	kandjar	mgmuscari	:) i was wondering if you guys heard about such or such issue with it?
