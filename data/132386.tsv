2012-05-17T11:35:00.000Z	Anarhist		hi, i've just tried installing 12.04, i knew it would be bad, but not this bad. the panel on the left side refuses to hide and stays open (it's a serious issue on netbook), upper left corner of the screen closes the program rather than starts the menu choser, and of course when i search for an application in unity it finds nothing
2012-05-17T11:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	Anarhist	 the left side panel hideing is set to not hide by default. its setable. and i have no issues with it showing on my netbook,  as for the rest. not sure. i dont have the same issues  here.
2012-05-17T11:37:00.000Z	Anarhist	dr_willis	where's the setting?
2012-05-17T11:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	Anarhist	 no idea. i always set mine to always show. I do use 'myunity' to shrink the icon size down to 32.
