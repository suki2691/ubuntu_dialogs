2008-06-03T21:31:00.000Z	thingfish	romeo_	do you have the accelerated drivers enabled?  There is a good tool at /usr/share/applications/Screens and Graphics
2008-06-03T21:32:00.000Z	thingfish	romeo_	then use that tool I pointed you to.  You'll have to navigate there within your desktop environment, because it's not seen on the command line.
2008-06-03T21:34:00.000Z	thingfish	romeo_	you're welcome.  I wrestled and wrestled with getting my nvidia card working, until I found that tool.
