2009-12-09T05:44:00.000Z	IceReaper		Can any1 please tell me if its possible to install ubuntu on a machine which does not have an monitor? All i can do would be via lan, if possible, or tv-card which shows me the screen till i got to the installer, then its all messed up due to ntsc/pal problems.
2009-12-09T05:45:00.000Z	IceReaper		no. i see the ubuntu boot menu from the cd atm (connected tv). but whatever i choose, the screen is messed up after that
