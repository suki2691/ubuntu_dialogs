2006-06-26T09:03:00.000Z	cisa	str8edge	simplest way is sudo apt-get install vlc
2006-06-26T09:04:00.000Z	cisa	str8edge	hmm, then get latest codect from the mplayer homepage and extract them to /usr/lib/win32
2006-06-26T09:05:00.000Z	cisa	str8edge	install xine-ui and change the settings to use this path for codecs
