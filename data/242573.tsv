2005-07-14T09:33:00.000Z	dashx		Hi guys, I have a question.
2005-07-14T09:34:00.000Z	dashx		I recently decided to use Ubuntu for a server box. I installed Ubuntu using "server" instead of regular install. How come it never asks me to assign a root password?

2005-07-14T09:34:00.000Z	bddebian	dashx	Ubuntu doesn't have root
