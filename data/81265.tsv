2008-08-26T00:01:00.000Z	quanticle	mrpockets	can't do sudo
2008-08-26T00:01:00.000Z	mrpockets	quanticle	so Admin is perma sudo,  desktop user doesn't run in sudo, but can command it, and unprivleded can't do sudo at all?
2008-08-26T00:02:00.000Z	quanticle	mrpockets	I think so.  Not completely sure though.
