2005-04-17T14:00:00.000Z	eyequeue	tanek	 insert a 'sudo apt-get update' in the middle, and yes
2005-04-17T14:02:00.000Z	eyequeue	tanek	 never used it myself, i've heard it was considered for hoary then dropped
2005-04-17T14:02:00.000Z	eyequeue	tanek	 "was" being the key word :)  i'm on hoary and i don't have it here
