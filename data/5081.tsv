2012-02-28T05:28:00.000Z	mdpatrick_		I need to set a static DNS to workaround a stupid modem issue I have where it gives up on fetching DNS results more often. How do I set a static DNS for my connection on an ubuntu machine?
2012-02-28T05:28:00.000Z	mark_u	mdpatrick_	/etc/hosts is common to many *nix platforms
2012-02-28T05:29:00.000Z	mdpatrick_	mark_u	OK so given google's public DNS is  8.8.8.8, and 8.8.4.4
2012-02-28T05:29:00.000Z	mdpatrick_	mark_u	What would I place in /etc/hosts?????
