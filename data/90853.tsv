2008-05-13T22:46:00.000Z	dreamfire		I have updated from gutsy to hardy. Now in the Run-Dialog (ALT-F2) the shortcut ~/ to open nautilus with the home directory is gone. How can I get it again?
2008-05-13T22:47:00.000Z	[GSF]Martin	dreamfire	can't you type "nautilus"?
2008-05-13T22:47:00.000Z	dreamfire	[GSF]Martin	yes, but it is much longer :)
2008-05-13T22:48:00.000Z	dreamfire	[GSF]Martin	and it worked in gutsy!
