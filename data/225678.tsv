2006-11-28T15:13:00.000Z	puff	LordMilesb	I find it takes 30-60 seconds, depending on how long it takes to get an answer from the network.

2006-11-28T15:14:00.000Z	puff	LordMilesb	Rather, the biggest factor being whether or not there's a network answering (the dhclient stage takes a godo 20-30 seconds before giving up).
