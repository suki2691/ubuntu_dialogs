2009-08-16T20:08:00.000Z	xiphos		I am having some trouble with my sound playback, I can hear sound when I test it under preferences, but I dont seem to be able to get any apps to actually play sound
2009-08-16T20:08:00.000Z	xiphos		or at least use the same driver / hardware?
2009-08-16T20:10:00.000Z	xiphos		yeah, I get the little drum beat at the splash screen
2009-08-16T20:11:00.000Z	MOUD	xiphos	are you trying to listen to mp3 files? If so you need to get a plugin to play those files
