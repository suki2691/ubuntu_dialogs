2009-06-13T22:06:00.000Z	briwood1		Dual booting Vista and Hardy.  Want to run Vista in a virtual machine. Don't have Vista install disks.  Is there any way to create an image of my existing Vista install and then bring it up as a virtual machine?  Or do I have to re-purchase windows?
2009-06-13T22:07:00.000Z	briwood1		okay thanks Hajuu.  That's what I feared.  I like Ubuntu as my default os...
2009-06-13T22:08:00.000Z	briwood1		yeah, but I hate windows.
