2005-10-19T11:33:00.000Z	kaschei		How do I resolve the following error? Upgrading from hoary to breezy I get "Depends: libc6 (>= 2.3.4-1) but 2.3.2.ds1-20ubuntu13" whenever I try to install packages (as well as other broken dependencies)
2005-10-19T11:33:00.000Z	kaschei		and apt-get install libc6 shows I have the most recent version
2005-10-19T11:33:00.000Z	nalioth	kaschei	i smell unofficial repos used
2005-10-19T11:35:00.000Z	nalioth	kaschei	paste your /etc/apt/sources.list to a pastebin, please
