2005-08-07T12:37:00.000Z	floppyears	billytwowilly	try "sudo mysql"
2005-08-07T12:38:00.000Z	billytwowilly	floppyears	yah, that doesn't work either. doesn't accept my password for some reason. I restarted mysql after changing the my.cnf file too. could it be the debian.cnf file in the mysql dir that is fuxoring it up?
2005-08-07T12:40:00.000Z	floppyears	billytwowilly	hmm, I would then ask in #mysql
