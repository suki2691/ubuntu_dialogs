2011-08-10T18:36:00.000Z	zkam		Hey all...  How much space do I need for the casper-rw to do persistent Ubuntu from USB?
2011-08-10T18:38:00.000Z	escott	zkam	depends on how much data/software you want to have/install
2011-08-10T18:38:00.000Z	zkam		ideally, I want to be able to boot from USB drive, and also have extra space on that drive for Windows files
2011-08-10T18:38:00.000Z	zkam	escott	not too much.  Probably Chrome, xchat, and some addons
