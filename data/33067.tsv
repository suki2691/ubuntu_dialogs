2010-06-26T10:54:00.000Z	sweetpi	phil_	you could try adding a new user and login with that to see if its a config issue
2010-06-26T10:54:00.000Z	phil_	sweetpi	Okay, I will do that.  I'll come back after I try that.
2010-06-26T11:00:00.000Z	phil_	sweetpi	Okay, I tried that and the new user has the same problem.
