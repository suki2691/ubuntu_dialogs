2006-12-21T12:49:00.000Z	un_operateur	Olodumare	I've never come across that idiom before -- as long as it's a good thing, sure :)
2006-12-21T12:51:00.000Z	Olodumare	un_operateur	I don't know if it's a good thing!  I'm having some issues with a palm.  When connected and trying to hotsync, it never has the decency to show up in /dev/
