2006-07-07T05:09:00.000Z	andax		i have a strange problem here since I installed a few updates today, generally the problem is that the "enter key" doesn't work anymore under X. it does work when logging in via GDM, but not after i have logged into gnome. The the enter key on the numeric keypad still works. Any ideas? (dapper )
