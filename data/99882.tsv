2008-02-20T08:46:00.000Z	^CatMan^	BigCanOfTuna	sorta, i think i saw one somewhere in kde, otherwise it should be in /etc/init.d/
2008-02-20T08:48:00.000Z	^CatMan^		cool, just in case i make a mistake, huh bascule?
2008-02-20T08:48:00.000Z	BigCanOfTuna	^CatMan^	Actually, I just found it.... update-rc.d
