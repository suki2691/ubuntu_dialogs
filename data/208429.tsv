2006-06-28T12:30:00.000Z	soundray	cdubya	I have a /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf. It contains examples for basic key-based setup -- nothing about certificates, where to place them etc.
2006-06-28T12:30:00.000Z	cdubya	soundray	just wondering, because mine has LOTS of examples about different configs, including that stuff....
2006-06-28T12:33:00.000Z	soundray	cdubya	I think I saw an extensively documented wpa_supplicant.conf sample somewhere -- I'll look it up again, thanks
