2011-07-04T13:32:00.000Z	kbrown90		thats good... can someone give me opinions on which mail server i should run on my Ubuntu Server 10.10
2011-07-04T13:34:00.000Z	kbrown90		google has failed me in that area... me and my father are starting a non profit company and we are wanting to run it all on our own server... got the webserver all ready but we need a mailserver... and don't know which one to go with for a small company.
