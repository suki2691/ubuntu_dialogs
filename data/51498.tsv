2011-10-19T16:05:00.000Z	sproaty		Any idea how to get the windows-like start menu back in 11.10? I've installed gnome-panels-classic and my 'start' menu is split into applications/places - in 11.04 I had a little icon with everything unified
2011-10-19T16:05:00.000Z	rcmaehl	sproaty	try kubuntu?
2011-10-19T16:05:00.000Z	sproaty	rcmaehl	nah...I'm assuming it's there *somewhere* if it was available in 11.04
2011-10-19T16:06:00.000Z	rcmaehl	sproaty	yeah with a heck of a lot of configuration file changes and package removals/installs
