2010-06-07T03:15:00.000Z	vlt		Hello. Is there anyone using Ubuntu to sync music to his iPhone successfully?
2010-06-07T03:16:00.000Z	porter1	vlt	I have had sucess with one of the newest ipod nanos. If you haven;t upgraded the firmware in a while it might work before Apple disables the workaround.
2010-06-07T03:29:00.000Z	vlt	porter1	The iPhone runs on firmware 3.0 (or 3.1).  I can read the audio tracks using Rhythmbox but my changes (adding or deleting tracks) aren't stored to the database (due to a new layout?).
2010-06-07T03:29:00.000Z	vlt	porter1	The files are actually stored on the device (and deleted too, so a deleted file appears in the track list but isn't playable)
