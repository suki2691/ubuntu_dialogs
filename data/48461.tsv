2009-10-03T07:41:00.000Z	mo0nykit		Hi! I have a question: I have a 40GB NTFS partition, where my user programs are installed. Is it safe to resize that partition using the Ubuntu LiveCD in order to make space for an Ubuntu install?
2009-10-03T07:41:00.000Z	fccf	mo0nykit	how much empty space on the windows drive
2009-10-03T07:45:00.000Z	mo0nykit	fccf	about 15GB. Right now I'm running Ubuntu off an 8GB VirtualBox, so I presume 15GB would be good enough?
