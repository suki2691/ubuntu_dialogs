2010-02-10T05:53:00.000Z	Blue112		I have trouble opening alsa-mixer, I can't configure my sound anymore... What can I do ?
2010-02-10T05:54:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Blue112	make sure you have alsa-utils and alsa-base installed
2010-02-10T05:56:00.000Z	Blue112	BluesKaj	alsa-utils wasn't installed, now it's done but alsamixer doesn't want to start up anyway.
