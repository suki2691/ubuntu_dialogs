2009-01-16T05:16:00.000Z	Kalan		I have an interseting question... My ISP turned off my internet the other day because i was connecting to undernet a lot and they submitted an abuse case. I have blocked the IRC ports in iptables so it can't connect out but i can not find what is starting the process that keeps spawning the IRC connections
2009-01-16T05:16:00.000Z	Kalan		i can't find anything in the logs, i have killed every process but SSH

2009-01-16T05:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	Kalan	 thats weird..   this is a home lan? or some other setup?
