2008-11-06T10:48:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	Appl3Kork	well what is it your trying to configure? i mean ssh and ftp are completely independent.
2008-11-06T10:50:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	Appl3Kork	well, by default you can ftp into an ubuntu box using the same username and password as your user account
2008-11-06T10:50:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	Appl3Kork	so what other configuration do you need?
