2010-04-12T23:14:00.000Z	njs`		anyone know why a bunch of old releases have disappeared from old-releases.ubuntu.com?
2010-04-12T23:15:00.000Z	jrib	njs`	probably because they are really old
2010-04-12T23:15:00.000Z	njs`		I just pulled this old laptop out of a closet and need to get it off feisty, but the repos disappeared since last week...
2010-04-12T23:15:00.000Z	njs`	jrib	yeah thanks, I thought that was why they were *there*, not why they would disappear
