2006-10-22T16:48:00.000Z	binfalse1		i wonder why people still stick to a braindead protocol like ftp
2006-10-22T16:48:00.000Z	sethk	binfalse1	they know how to use it, is the main reason.
2006-10-22T16:49:00.000Z	binfalse1	sethk	then they deserve their passwords to be stolen
2006-10-22T16:49:00.000Z	sethk	binfalse1	no disagreement here.  I don't allow it on any system I'm responsible for.
