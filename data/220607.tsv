2005-10-04T07:08:00.000Z	apokryphos	henk	never said it was; it sure isn't (it's been done many-a-time).
2005-10-04T07:10:00.000Z	henk	apokryphos	 it seemed like you meant that getting into development of applications on linux was not profitable. Not all applications build to run on a linux machine need to be free (or open source for that matter)
2005-10-04T07:10:00.000Z	apokryphos	henk	never said that, and of course you can -- yes
