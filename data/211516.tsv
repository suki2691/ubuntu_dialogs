2011-07-18T10:12:00.000Z	bhuey		anybody here know about setting up static interfaces directly ? is /etc/network/interfaces deprecated ?
2011-07-18T10:13:00.000Z	bhuey		what about via command line remotely ?
2011-07-18T10:14:00.000Z	Dulak	bhuey	it's not deprecated, but any interface setup in /etc/network/interfaces won't be managed by network manager.
2011-07-18T10:14:00.000Z	Dulak	bhuey	so it's either/or, not deprecated.
