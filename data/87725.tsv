2009-10-30T06:18:00.000Z	dooglus		I wonder if anyone can tell me a way to get the photos off my Sony Erisson phone onto my ubuntu 9.10 laptop?
2009-10-30T06:18:00.000Z	dooglus		my current method involves using WinXP to copy them onto a memory stick, then using the memory stick to move them here
2009-10-30T06:18:00.000Z	dooglus		but that's obviously sub-optimal
2009-10-30T06:19:00.000Z	Hillshum	dooglus	I'd take LXDE over XFCE
