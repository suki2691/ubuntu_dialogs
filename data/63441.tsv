2010-02-12T00:00:00.000Z	mleger	acicula	thanks! I am a bit of a newb when it comes to ubuntu filesystem but when installing packages does it all go to ~/home? what about the root folder? is there anything there that I should copy?
2010-02-12T00:09:00.000Z	acicula	mleger	depends, it may overwrite the old grub
2010-02-12T00:10:00.000Z	mleger	acicula	any way I can avoid this?
