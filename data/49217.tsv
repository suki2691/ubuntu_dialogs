2012-04-18T09:30:00.000Z	LGSilva		is a regular desktop possible in 11.10? like old gnome?
2012-04-18T09:31:00.000Z	LGSilva		I'm running gnome 3 but its almost like unity
2012-04-18T09:32:00.000Z	boomshankerx	LGSilva	you should be able to downgrade to gnome 2.x
2012-04-18T09:33:00.000Z	boomshankerx	LGSilva	but honestly I'd get used to it...everything seems to be going to these toy desktops
