2008-11-18T05:18:00.000Z	SexyJames1337		I'm fairly new to ubuntu, and wanted to install themes. Installed clearlooks without a hitch, but I'm trying to install an icon theme, "glass icons" and it skins some icons but not others, such as firefox, whereas I'm pretty sure it skins icons like that automatically. The same happens with any other icon pack I try. What can I do to make it skin all icons?
