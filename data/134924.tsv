2009-11-19T00:12:00.000Z	comforteagle		hi, running top on my ubuntu maching I'm seeing waitio of up to 40% and load avg of of up to 4% & all memory eaten up. ideas for hunting down culprit?
2009-11-19T00:13:00.000Z	simplexio	comforteagle	waitio means that proces has to to wait io to get something done, like there is lots of read/writes in disk, if using top, M sorts by memoery, and p by process time
2009-11-19T00:17:00.000Z	comforteagle	simplexio	ok, so does one diagnose where an disk wait problem is happening?
