2011-06-05T00:54:00.000Z	hubbabubbadubba		installed ubuntu for a person on a compaq presario cq60 laptop. one big problem is that the hw-button for wireless is softblocking when used. it is next to the powerbutton so it is accidentical pressed some times. then the user is networkless until i can come and run rfkill unblock all. must find a permanent solution here... and help please!!!!
