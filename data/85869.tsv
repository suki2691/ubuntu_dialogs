2008-10-26T20:56:00.000Z	Woet		My x-server keeps randomly restarting.. usually when I click the tray icon of Kopete. How to resolve this? Running 8.04, http://pastebin.com/f7926b341 is my Xorg log. I'm using the latest restricted drivers.
2008-10-26T20:57:00.000Z	Thylacine	Woet	you should be ok with 8.10, it has a new xorg
2008-10-26T20:58:00.000Z	Woet	Thylacine	I'd prefer using a released version
2008-10-26T20:59:00.000Z	Thylacine	Woet	just 4 days left but the RC is very stable, why fix a problem in an old release?
