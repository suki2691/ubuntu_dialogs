2008-01-01T21:19:00.000Z	RickX		can anyone tell me how to stop KDE from immediately switching to the desktop that had a window opened on it?
2008-01-01T21:19:00.000Z	RickX		I rarely want to go to a desktop, just becasue an app or window opened.
2008-01-01T21:20:00.000Z	astro76	RickX	try #kubuntu
2008-01-01T21:20:00.000Z	RickX	astro76	thanks. this actually went to the wrong window.
