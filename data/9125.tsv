2011-10-23T04:36:00.000Z	templet	beli	usually a external drive is plug and play.  maheanuu can also assign a fixed mount point using a filesystem labeller if anyone wishes to help him out in that regard.
2011-10-23T04:37:00.000Z	templet	beli	you can also be right about /etc/mtab i've never had to mess with that file in the history of my life
2011-10-23T04:39:00.000Z	beli	templet	your solution will work, but something on the system changed....so the perms are not working anymore....nothing on the disk changed...so my suggestion is to fix what changed on the system....and that you can do in /etc/mtab
