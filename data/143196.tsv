2007-03-13T06:49:00.000Z	Xeper	PriceChild	My real question is has anyone gotten that chipset to successfully work in Ubuntu during an install.
2007-03-13T06:49:00.000Z	PriceChild	Xeper	tried safe graphics?
2007-03-13T06:50:00.000Z	Xeper	PriceChild	Not sure what that is.  It's not the graphics card that's the issue, though.  It's not picking up my HDD or my DVD RAM drive because it can't pick up the chipset... thus, install is broken at this point for me.
