2011-04-05T02:54:00.000Z	Belial``	ActionParsnip	or i'm sorry. DC is based on core duo, the D is based on the p4.
2011-04-05T02:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Belial``	 but that is all was outputted so its an old P4, maybe I was wrong about the 'all' bit :D, the cpuinfo points to a 32bit chip
2011-04-05T02:55:00.000Z	Belial``	ActionParsnip	yeah, you're definitely right in this situation.
