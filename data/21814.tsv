2011-01-01T09:24:00.000Z	null1		Those who are wiser than me: I am going through the installer again, and I am wondering if the installer is capable of overwriting my encrypted HD without asking me for a password? I am in the "partitions formatting" stage and I am about to re-partition my HD into just 1 hard drive, and it isn't prompting me for the password I had used to encrypt it, etc...Does that mean it hasn't actually tried to access the hard drive yet, or
