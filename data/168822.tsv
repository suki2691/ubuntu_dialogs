2006-09-02T07:38:00.000Z	rich102		I had probs with dns,  so entered name server in resolv.conf. It keeps adding my router ip as the name server everytime I boot up
2006-09-02T07:38:00.000Z	tanath	rich102	so add your nameservers to your router instead
2006-09-02T07:41:00.000Z	rich102	tanath	name servers are already in my router
2006-09-02T07:41:00.000Z	tanath	rich102	then what's the prob?
