2010-04-30T18:10:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	tarzeau	have you figured out how to move my windows buttons (ie. min, max, close) BACK to the right?  I run Ubuntu to make sure it's not confused with OSX (although I have that installed on another parition)
2010-04-30T18:10:00.000Z	tarzeau	jeeves_Moss	yes it's one command
