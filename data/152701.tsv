2009-06-01T19:36:00.000Z	pl3ktrum		any solutions?
2009-06-01T19:36:00.000Z	arand	pl3ktrum	hmm, I'm not sure wubi supports win7 yet... so the boot screen just gives you windows as usual?
2009-06-01T19:41:00.000Z	arand	pl3ktrum	I don't know what kind of boot manager win7 uses, but presumably wubi has problems with modifying it to make it boot, I know dual-booting with ubuntu on separate partition and grub as the main bootmanager should work though..
