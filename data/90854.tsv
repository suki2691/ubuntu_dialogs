2008-05-13T04:47:00.000Z	_Net		Hi I got a problem. No one is able to connect to my computer. I mean I can't remote desktop, I can use lampp only in localhost, no one use gobby (multiplayer text editor), basically anything that involves me running from my computer doesn't work.
2008-05-13T04:48:00.000Z	_Net		I dont know why, before I can go to http://<myip> and it would show me lampp now i can only do it via http://localhost
