2007-11-01T04:32:00.000Z	mr_daniel		i am searching for a pdf-tool which is able to scale a pdf to e.g. 70%, which can i use to scale a pdf file?
2007-11-01T04:33:00.000Z	mr_daniel		on this page http://www.verypdf.com/pdfinfoeditor/resize-paper/resize.htm i have a tool named 'pdftools', but is this tool available or linux/ubuntu

2007-11-01T04:33:00.000Z	mr_daniel	Jordan_U	yes, I want to modifiy it
