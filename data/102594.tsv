2008-10-27T10:58:00.000Z	riz0n		just out of curiosity, my linux server is sitting at a remote location. i use putty to remotely administer the server from a shell line. however, i have to manually startx to get gui up and running, then i can vnc to the gui remotely.. is there a way to startx from the shell via putty?
2008-10-27T10:59:00.000Z	riz0n		right now the gui (X server) is telling me i need to restart, but i know when i reboot i will not be able to startx till i physically access the server
2008-10-27T11:01:00.000Z	rww	riz0n	you can't just issue startx from the command line?
