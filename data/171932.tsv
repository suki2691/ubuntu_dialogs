2006-08-06T16:30:00.000Z	Thanatos_		Please...I just upgraded to Dapper, and now, when I boot up, it runs gdm and automatically logs me in, but instead of a desktop, it is just a terminal window, can someone help me out?
2006-08-06T16:31:00.000Z	sparkleytone	Thanatos_	the only thing i can think to do is to dpkg-reconfigure gdm
2006-08-06T16:32:00.000Z	Thanatos_	sparkleytone	I'll try that (I'll try anything)
2006-08-06T05:12:00.000Z	Thanatos_	sparkleytone	FYI  dpkg reconfigure gdm made no change.
