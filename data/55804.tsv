2009-06-01T23:32:00.000Z	chun2		Anyone help? I've shrunk my windows partition, I'd now like to increase the size of my ubuntu partition, so I booted from the live disc and ran gparted - this is the window I get - http://bluesuncorp.co.uk/files/screenshot-dev-sda-gparted.jpg - but for some reason it won't let me extend sda5 into the free space on the left

2009-06-01T23:33:00.000Z	chun2	mdm	I should be able to move it though, right? and gparted won't let me do that
