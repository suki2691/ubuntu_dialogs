2011-11-05T19:49:00.000Z	dwelch		Hmm, looking for a grep statement to find all files owned by a particular user and delete them (recursively from the directory I'm in)
2011-11-05T19:49:00.000Z	dwelch		anyone care to help me figure it out?
2011-11-05T19:50:00.000Z	Guest29391	dwelch	just type "sudo nautilus" and then delete using normal methods
2011-11-05T19:51:00.000Z	dwelch	Guest29391	I'm on a server environment
