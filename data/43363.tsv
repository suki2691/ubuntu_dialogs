2012-05-08T02:00:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Floyd42	if so, then why don't you switch to another Desktop Environment? LXDE suits me fine and can be controlled with keyboard or mouse
2012-05-08T02:02:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Floyd42	why should I assume that you use anything specific? I'm just reacting to your preference for a mouse-controlled Desktop.
