2012-01-04T00:53:00.000Z	shades		I have a 10.10 mavrick iso but for some reason I can't seem to install off of it.... It should have apache and php on there, right?
2012-01-04T00:53:00.000Z	acidfrost	shades	no apache and php are seperate packages
2012-01-04T00:54:00.000Z	shades	acidfrost	right but are they on the 10.10 install cd?
2012-01-04T00:54:00.000Z	acidfrost	shades	you'd have to install them seperately
