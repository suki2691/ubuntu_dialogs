2005-12-06T17:25:00.000Z	dooglus	ruairi	it's control-shift-c (and v) in gnome-terminal
2005-12-06T17:25:00.000Z	dooglus	ruairi	because control-c and control-v are used by a lot of the programs you might use inside the terminal
2005-12-06T17:26:00.000Z	dooglus	ruairi	you can change the shortcuts to anything you like, of course
