2004-09-27T13:19:00.000Z	sabdfl	suburbanite_fury	yes, we'll support constant upgrades from version to version
2004-09-27T13:19:00.000Z	suburbanite_fury	sabdfl	Thanks -- very cool.
2004-09-27T13:20:00.000Z	sabdfl	suburbanite_fury	also, we can open up a port to another architecture if we have a core team that will take responsibility for keeping it up to date and secure post-release
