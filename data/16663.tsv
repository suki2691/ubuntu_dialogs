2011-05-09T14:09:00.000Z	iridium		hi, I have a small problem, after the latest pidgin update from ubuntu, it works fine, but the notification icon on the task bar changed, and it doesn't update like before, showing the status or if somenoe answered, anyone knows anything of this?

2011-05-09T14:12:00.000Z	iridium	lil_pete	well, a purple icon with an "!" appears, but it doesn't change, can be changed to the older way?
