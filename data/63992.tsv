2011-10-13T23:14:00.000Z	esteeven		Hello. How do I disable bluetooth in 11.10? Or at least stop it starting in my session.
2011-10-13T23:15:00.000Z	xangua	esteeven	go to startup apps preferences and disable it
2011-10-13T23:17:00.000Z	esteeven	xangua	my problem is that I can't find the startup apps
2011-10-13T23:19:00.000Z	esteeven	xangua	or to be more precise, I can find "start up applications" but it is empty.
