2008-03-12T20:53:00.000Z	ChaosR		hi, I downloaded the most recent firefox (Firefox 3.0 beta 4), but when I try to start it, it gives this error: (crashreporter:10127): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_widget_set_sensitive: assertion `GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed. Then it gives me the option to just quit or restart firefox.
