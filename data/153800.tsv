2007-02-10T11:18:00.000Z	Phopsy		Blimey, Kopete didn't like that! Anyway, I just installed the kernel updates and now my FGLRX driver has rolled back to Mesa - how do I go about gettting the darned thing back again?
2007-02-10T11:18:00.000Z	vox754	Phopsy	there are problems with kernel updates, don't upgrade. There is more info in the forums.
2007-02-10T11:19:00.000Z	Phopsy	vox754	Thanks :D It's a tad late now, though, so I guess I'm stuck with Mesa for a while
