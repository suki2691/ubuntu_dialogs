2011-09-22T02:24:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	toodida	its an account.. works like Dropbox does, if you have ever used that?
2011-09-22T02:27:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	toodida	have you logged into Ubuntu One correctly? It can take time to sync as well
2011-09-22T02:32:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	toodida	are they any files on the web interface?
