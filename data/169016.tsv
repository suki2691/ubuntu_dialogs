2006-10-01T13:41:00.000Z	der0b		Hey folks, I'm wondering if there's a way to record all of the prompts displayed to a user and his answers in a gnome-terminal session.  I'm trying to document a how-to and this would make it a lot easier
2006-10-01T13:42:00.000Z	anon32	der0b	profile -> logging
2006-10-01T13:52:00.000Z	der0b	anon32	I'm not seeing a logging section in gnome-terminal
2006-10-01T13:53:00.000Z	anon32	der0b	it was a guess :-\
