2012-08-22T05:26:00.000Z	Eddy_		Quick question. Does anyone know what sort of functionality is lost when connecting to an Exchange 2010 server via Ubuntu (using Thunderbird or any other mail software)? Does the calendar still work? including meeting invites etc..
2012-08-22T05:27:00.000Z	Eddy_		yup, im using MAPI. So no Linux MAPI support?
2012-08-22T05:27:00.000Z	zykotick9	Eddy_	Exchange is not a mail server/client - it's so much more (or less?)
