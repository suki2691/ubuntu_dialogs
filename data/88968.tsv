2009-01-27T12:21:00.000Z	j_		Hi.
2009-01-27T12:23:00.000Z	j_		I am attempting to install Songbird, I've unzipped the tar.gz file, but I can't seem to use ./configure in the directory (It says no such file or directory).
2009-01-27T12:24:00.000Z	j_		There's a readme file, but it doesn't tell me anything...
2009-01-27T12:24:00.000Z	atom^x	j_	try ./songbird
