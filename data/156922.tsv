2009-11-18T08:11:00.000Z	metaphlex		running ubuntu through wubi - compiz occasionally jumps up to 85% of my cpu even though i'm just browsing firefox
2009-11-18T08:12:00.000Z	metaphlex		any ideas what's making compiz hog the cpu?
2009-11-18T08:13:00.000Z	thiebaude	metaphlex	you check your system processes?
2009-11-18T08:14:00.000Z	thiebaude	metaphlex	im not sure how to fix that, my compiz is ok
