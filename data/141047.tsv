2009-06-29T05:32:00.000Z	isotherm		google seach didn't show anything
2009-06-29T05:33:00.000Z	raylu	isotherm	there shouldn't be anything in .disk. what filesystem and why?
2009-06-29T05:34:00.000Z	raylu	isotherm	i think that's only for the squashfs on the livecd. they shouldn't be there on an installed system
