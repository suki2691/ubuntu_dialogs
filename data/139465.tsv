2007-06-01T14:26:00.000Z	RedACE	ChevronX	update your vmtools?
2007-06-01T14:27:00.000Z	RedACE	ChevronX	contact VMware for support.. that's what you pay them for.
2007-06-01T14:28:00.000Z	RedACE	ChevronX	sorry, I'm not that familiar with vmware.. maybe someone else it. But I'd think going directly to vmware for support would be faster, wouldn't it?
