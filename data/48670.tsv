2009-09-13T09:24:00.000Z	lstarnes	MrSchmo	it applies to the entire network that you have registered on
2009-09-13T09:25:00.000Z	MrSchmo	lstarnes	Irishmanluke: thanks
2009-10-30T07:55:00.000Z	lstarnes	MrSchmo	if it's taking a long time to update, it's because the mirrors are overloaded due to the release
