2012-02-14T21:38:00.000Z	avieros		How do you configure WPA-EAP in 11.01? my wireless adapter (ASUS usb N-13) recognizes the network just fine, but the system keeps asking me for authentication
2012-02-14T21:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	avieros	what chip does it use?
2012-02-14T21:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	avieros	can that connect to wpa-eap under Linux?
2012-02-14T21:41:00.000Z	avieros	ActionParsnip	it's supposed to be able to, but for some reason it isn't >_<
