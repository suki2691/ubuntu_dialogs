2005-02-04T17:41:00.000Z	diego		hi all. i can't seem to get this machine to boot the install disc. it's an hp pavilion 8240. the error message is "Loading isolinux: Disk error 01, AX = 4286, drive 9F". any ideas?
2005-02-04T17:42:00.000Z	kent	diego	tried burning at a lower speed? it might help, i have had problems my self booting cd's that are burnt in high speed :(
2005-02-04T17:43:00.000Z	diego	kent	did you get that error?
2005-02-04T17:44:00.000Z	kent	diego	no, not that one.. but random errors becaus the filesystem is corrupted, i think.
