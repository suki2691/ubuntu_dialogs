2011-09-08T18:42:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Lynx_	, read my post above ...maybe you missed it.
2011-09-08T18:48:00.000Z	Lynx_	BluesKaj	I missed it indeed. So I deleted all the files from that dir, there were to for a freenx repo. The error after apt-get update is still there though.
2011-09-08T19:12:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Lynx_	I didn't mean for you to delete all the files from sources.list.d , just the ppas that were giving the gpg key errors
