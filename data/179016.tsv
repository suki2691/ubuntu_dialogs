2008-06-18T17:49:00.000Z	level09		any good *code* editor to use with terminal ?
2008-06-18T17:50:00.000Z	jrib	level09	vim or emacs (I like vim)
2008-06-18T17:50:00.000Z	jrib	level09	vim-tiny is included.  You should install "vim"
2008-06-18T17:51:00.000Z	jrib	level09	be forewarned, you need to learn to use vim.  It will suck for the first couple of days.  vimtutor will help you a lot
