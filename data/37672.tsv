2010-02-07T07:21:00.000Z	SecondInfinity		What is the difference between Chrome and Chromium
2010-02-07T07:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	SecondInfinity	Chrome is based on Chromeium.  Chromeium is open source,  Chrome is closed source
2010-02-07T07:23:00.000Z	SecondInfinity	sebsebseb	I see. Yeah, closed source is not nice. What operating systems is Chromium available for?
