2007-04-18T12:23:00.000Z	Angeluz	Wikzo	I'd stick with regularily visiting the ubuntu-page for an announcement.
2007-04-18T12:26:00.000Z	Wikzo	Angeluz	-> Sounds good ... but it is a bit strange that we don't get an official release time
2007-04-18T12:26:00.000Z	Angeluz	Wikzo	Yes, but as far as I know, it's not even 100% sure, that the final Feisty will be released on 19th April.
