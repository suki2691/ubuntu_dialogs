2005-11-27T12:03:00.000Z	selutha		I have a laptop that the builtin nic causes problems and i want to stop it from loading. It is loading a 3com 3c59x. How can i stop this from loading on boot up?
2005-11-27T12:05:00.000Z	selutha		or another quesition is if i have a buitin 3c59x on-board nic and lets say i put in a 3c59x pci card how can i have it not load anything for the onboard and load the drivers for the pci card?
