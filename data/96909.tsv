2008-10-17T02:55:00.000Z	Killeroid	ricosecada	no. i guess you can call the beta versions of the next release as the unstable version.
2008-10-17T02:56:00.000Z	ricosecada	Killeroid	okay so there is just the stable release and a beta (development)?
2008-10-17T02:59:00.000Z	Killeroid	ricosecada	yes, hardy is stable and intrepid beta being the development version
