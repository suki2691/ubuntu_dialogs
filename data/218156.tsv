2005-10-21T13:24:00.000Z	Murph		I'm trying to install ubuntu 5.1 on my friend's laptop, and it is going insanely slow, does anyone know why?
2005-10-21T13:25:00.000Z	[LethAL] 	Murph	something to do with DMA not being enabled
2005-10-21T13:27:00.000Z	[LethAL] 	Murph	no, I've never fiddled with HDParm
