2006-10-02T12:00:00.000Z	aeroSoul	BiSk-8	i think none really work... password protected .rar archives are encrypted i think
2006-10-02T12:01:00.000Z	aeroSoul	BiSk-8	so the only way to hack it is a bruteforce attack... which could take years =)
2006-10-02T12:01:00.000Z	aeroSoul	BiSk-8	i dont know.. but you could install vmware and install windows as a virtual machine inside your linux
