2009-07-22T07:07:00.000Z	tehdave		Simple question: How do I change the default program for video playback (running Hardy, want to have VLC be default for video files instead of Totem, can't seem to find File Type Associations anywhere)
2009-07-22T07:08:00.000Z	jdu	tehdave	should be 'Prefered Applications' menu somewhere in Preferences or under it
2009-07-22T07:09:00.000Z	jdu	tehdave	mgolisch gave a better answer
2009-07-22T07:09:00.000Z	tehdave	jdu	Spikemcc : I was looking more for the specific-to-extension associations, mgolisch got it for me but thank you
