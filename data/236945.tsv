2005-05-23T11:29:00.000Z	Ashims	dabaSlon	most are built in
2005-05-23T11:30:00.000Z	Ashims	dabaSlon	tho I'm sure I've made it read from the mplayer win32 codecs directory before...
2005-05-23T11:31:00.000Z	Ashims	dabaSlon	its a freaking nice player tho, for watching avi's, dvd's n other mpeg media... etc. etc. etc
