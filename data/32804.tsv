2010-11-17T10:00:00.000Z	faction918	MrAnthrope	I never found a way :/
2010-11-17T10:00:00.000Z	faction918	MrAnthrope	do you know what grub is?
2010-11-17T10:09:00.000Z	faction918	MrAnthrope	I left the conversation for a minute so I don't know where you left off; search a thing called plymouth. That is what ubunutu uses to display the screen during boot. This is different, however, form the grub splash (which you should not see unless you dual boot) and different from the logon screen. Here is a reference link: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/quick-tipplymouth-themes-in-ubuntu-10-04-lucid-lynx.html
