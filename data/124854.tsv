2008-01-02T18:31:00.000Z	r-wolf		I've dl pidgin sources, trying to./configure, and it tells me "You must have the GLib 2.0 development headers installed to build." What package is it in?
2008-01-02T18:32:00.000Z	pvl	r-wolf	use synaptic
2008-01-02T18:32:00.000Z	r-wolf	pvl	sure, but pidgin 2.3.1 isn't yet at repository
2008-01-02T18:33:00.000Z	pvl	r-wolf	oh well i guess u can search synaptic around for the package, i had the same problem, think i jsut went to pidgins website adn downlaod the .deb
