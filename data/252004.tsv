2005-10-18T07:11:00.000Z	Rounin		Hey, I just built a bunch of .deb packages, but how do I install them?
2005-10-18T07:11:00.000Z	eyequeue	Rounin	 dpkg -i *.deb
2005-10-18T07:11:00.000Z	eyequeue	Rounin	 sudo of course
2005-10-18T07:12:00.000Z	eyequeue	Rounin	 after they are --install'ed, apt dpkg synaptic aptitude, all will be aware of them
