2008-06-17T16:52:00.000Z	tetraedr		how can I install xmms (1-st one) on ubuntu 8.04?
2008-06-17T16:52:00.000Z	TuniX12	tetraedr	xmms1 is obsolete
2008-06-17T16:53:00.000Z	tetraedr	TuniX12	but it's still the best one. I didn't find any player that can authorize on http-streams, intentify itself as mpg123 and work properly without all those stupid daemons mega-huge and havy intefaces etc...
