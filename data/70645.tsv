2009-12-08T01:02:00.000Z	Jamed	mneptok	not for folders there its 500 if you still want to be able to use them
2009-12-08T01:02:00.000Z	mneptok	Jamed	if you want to be able to open folders, they need the execute bit set. 500 is read/execute. read-only is 400.
2009-12-08T01:03:00.000Z	Jamed	mneptok	right but what but a folder with 400 is useless you cant even list the content
