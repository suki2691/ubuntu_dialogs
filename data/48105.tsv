2009-09-19T23:58:00.000Z	T_N_T		On Aircrack-ng I am getting a message that is saying something about the AP being on a different channel, what am I doing wrong?
2009-09-19T23:58:00.000Z	rand0ms0me0ne	T_N_T	just change the channel?
2009-09-20T00:00:00.000Z	rand0ms0me0ne	T_N_T	dunno, haven't bothered playing with aircrack in some number of months... i would guess, off the top of my head, that it might be something like -c or -C
