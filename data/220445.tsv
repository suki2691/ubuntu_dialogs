2008-08-18T00:54:00.000Z	Flannel	Dreadful	Try booting to the CD, and checking the CD for defects (its on the initial menu, and you won't have to actually boot Ubuntu).  That sometimes happens if somethign went wrong with the burn
2008-08-18T00:54:00.000Z	Flannel	Dreadful	or, if you want to assume its wrong, burn again at 4x
2008-08-18T00:57:00.000Z	Flannel	Dreadful	Try copying all the files off the CD to a folder (on your desktop or whatever) and then running wubi from there
