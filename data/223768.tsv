2009-07-31T03:24:00.000Z	th0r	BigdaveJoker	if it isn't in the repos the best bet is probably going to be compiling it from source
2009-07-31T03:24:00.000Z	th0r	BigdaveJoker	have you checked getdeb...it might be in there
2009-07-31T03:25:00.000Z	th0r	BigdaveJoker	getdeb.net, but I just checked and it isn't there
