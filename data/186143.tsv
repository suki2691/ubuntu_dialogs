2007-09-27T14:57:00.000Z	SWAT		I'm wondering: what licence does the content on the Ubuntu wiki have?
2007-09-27T14:57:00.000Z	ikonia_	SWAT	I think its listed at the bottom of the wiki
2007-09-27T14:59:00.000Z	SWAT	ikonia_	that's only the canonical disclaimer, but perhaps it's also apliccable for the wiki
2007-09-27T15:00:00.000Z	ikonia_	SWAT	ahh, I thought it had a note in te copyright statment
