2012-11-10T22:09:00.000Z	TomSlominski		Hi. I'm trying to disable one key in the move plugin in compiz via gconf. How do I set it to disabled?
2012-11-10T22:10:00.000Z	TomSlominski		It's a string that contains <Alt>F7 and I need it to be completely disabled.
2012-11-10T22:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	TomSlominski	is the string you want to disable ctrl+alt+f7?  if so, i doubt you can.  and you probably shouldn't.
2012-11-10T22:15:00.000Z	TomSlominski	zykotick9	lol, okay, thanks
