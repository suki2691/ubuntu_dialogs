2011-03-31T10:54:00.000Z	ohsix	cheshire_fox1	i use the STA drivers cuz of other problems (ones that seemingly act like heat issues, but ultimately mean dropped connections over time)
2011-03-31T10:54:00.000Z	cheshire_fox1	ohsix	I haven't needed to use that since 9.10.  Normally the STA driver works but for some reason it uninstalled itself
2011-03-31T10:55:00.000Z	ohsix	cheshire_fox1	package name probably changed, i've used bcmwl-kernel-source but i've only ran 10.04 and 10.10 on mine
