2005-10-15T10:12:00.000Z	dodgyville		I did apt-get install apache2, but I can't access localhost. I don't think apache2 is running either.
2005-10-15T10:13:00.000Z	pudland	dodgyville	did you check apache website docs
2005-10-15T10:13:00.000Z	pudland	dodgyville	they tell you how to start and stop server
