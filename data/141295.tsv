2007-03-27T12:28:00.000Z	Th3Oz		Hi, I've updated ubuntu feisty kernel from 2.6.20-11 to 2.6.20-13 and if i'll try to boot it with root=/dev/hda2 it stops at the root filesystem's mount, i've to use root=UUID=4e1d1001-cd85-440b-9f2d-4e3ddea88a13 but now if i'll try to type "mount" root is on /dev/sda1 and not on hda1, someone know why?
