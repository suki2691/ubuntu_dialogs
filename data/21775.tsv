2011-06-15T08:07:00.000Z	fizyplankton		hey i installed ubuntu 11.04 on a new partiton, in addition to my 3 existing OS's, but i want to uninstall it. i can still get to my other os's via GRUB, but i noticed that the 11.04 install changed the grub layout. if i delete the 11.04 partitons, will grub go back to how it was, stop working, stay the same, or what?
