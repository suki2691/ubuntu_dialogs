2005-04-22T13:46:00.000Z	\\Neo		hi, i installed kubuntu for the first time and i wonder how to configure my network... knetworkmanager isn't working. when i try to use "admin-mode" it asks for my password and then does nothing. is this a known problem?
2005-04-22T13:47:00.000Z	\\Neo		where are the network files stored in kubuntu
2005-04-22T13:49:00.000Z	\\Neo		that 530 have the file and you are in queue by 60
