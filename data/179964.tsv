2008-01-13T06:11:00.000Z	DaPostie		Quick Q - I have 32bit 7.10. Can i somehow upgrade to 64bit?
2008-01-13T06:11:00.000Z	jrib	DaPostie	no, not really any point to do so anyway
2008-01-13T06:13:00.000Z	jrib	DaPostie	it's there for anyone that wants it, but atm I'd recommend 32bit for a user that does not know exactly why he needs 64bit over 32bit
