2010-11-15T19:28:00.000Z	ed__		im just playing around with "mount --bind" is it bad practice to mount a folder this way with the same mount point e.g. "mount --bind -o noexec,nosuid,rw /tmp /tmp!
2010-11-15T19:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ed__	 i imagine doing so would be .. weird...
2010-11-15T19:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ed__	 try it and see. :)
