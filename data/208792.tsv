2009-02-14T04:44:00.000Z	Huufarted		Quick question:  I want to replace my router with an Ubuntu box.  Any particular RPMs that could give me a decent solution for this?

2009-02-14T04:45:00.000Z	Huufarted		bah, sorry jrib.  I work on Red Hat boxes almost all day long.  It's just a generic term for me.
