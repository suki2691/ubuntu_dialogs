2009-11-20T05:55:00.000Z	Sierradump		Can someone help me with Xorg.conf?  I just need to set resolution to 720p  (1280x720)  but I also need to adjust something like horizontal and vertical frequencies?  But I don't know what they should be set to?
2009-11-20T05:55:00.000Z	Sierradump		Is there a way to figure that out?
