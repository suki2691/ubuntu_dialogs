Even though I have Deluge set as my default torrent client when i try to download a torrent file from firefox it only asks me if i want to open it with Transmission. Deluge is not on the list and i dont know how to ad it because i dont know where the executable file is. In windows I know it would be in C:/Program Files/Deluge/Deluge.exe (with backlashes) any help? Thanks
