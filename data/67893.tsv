2009-01-22T21:30:00.000Z	facepalm_		Hey everyone, I am not sure this is an Ubuntu problem but my cd drive all the sudden doesn't get recognized by my computer (doesn't even show up in BIOS)
2009-01-22T21:32:00.000Z	facepalm_		gnea: yeah, it opens up fine. I have 2 different CD drives and they both open and close fine but don't get recognized by BIOS. I have BIOS set to automatically find them, and I checked the cables and it all appears to be fine
2009-01-22T21:33:00.000Z	vigo	facepalm_	Tried disconnecting one, then trying?
2009-01-22T21:38:00.000Z	facepalm_	vigo	I would usually agree but I put in a CD drive that I know for sure is functioning and the problem persists
