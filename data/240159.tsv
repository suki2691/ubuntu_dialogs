2008-02-11T00:00:00.000Z	nickrud	jgmcmaster	  type   sudo apt-get install wine   in a terminal, and put the full output on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2008-02-11T00:05:00.000Z	nickrud	jgmcmaster	paste the link here so I can see it :)
2008-02-11T00:09:00.000Z	nickrud	jgmcmaster	after you do that, try installing wine again
