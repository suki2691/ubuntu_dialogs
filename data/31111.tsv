2010-05-28T05:14:00.000Z	drmc		I want to migrate from 9.04 to 10.4, how can I transfer programs, configuration and data between them?
2010-05-28T05:16:00.000Z	Daekdroom	drmc	you can do a upgrade from 9.04 to 9.10 then 10.04, but it's likely to break your system.
2010-05-28T05:17:00.000Z	drmc	Daekdroom	so the only option is to backup /home and /etc and manually transfer the stuff I need to a clean install?
2010-05-28T05:18:00.000Z	Daekdroom	drmc	well, backuping /home and keeping track of your programs should be enough. Transfering /etc from one version to another is insane.
