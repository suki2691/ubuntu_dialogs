2009-12-12T16:03:00.000Z	cmdshftn		quick question for anyone; checked in forums and couldn't find much; woke up and heard my karmic server's hard drive going, ran a ps aux over ssh and found this process running on root "dd bs=1 if=/pro"  any reason why this would be running automatically during the night?
2009-12-12T16:04:00.000Z	cmdshftn		I know dd and bs=1, not familiar with the if=/pro and why it would be running on its own
2009-12-12T16:04:00.000Z	airtonix	cmdshftn	sure its if=/pro and not if=/proc ?
2009-12-12T16:07:00.000Z	airtonix	cmdshftn	dd (convert and copy file ) bs=1 (read and write bytes at a time) if=/proc (read from file instead of stdin)
