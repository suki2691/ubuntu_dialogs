2007-06-10T16:32:00.000Z	Emanon	Flannel	Thanks - do you know why -i is better than -s?
2007-06-10T16:33:00.000Z	Flannel	Emanon	they set some environmental variables differently
2007-06-10T16:35:00.000Z	Emanon	Flannel	OK, I just checked the man page, and it does seem to provide a more complete root environment
