2011-02-10T01:18:00.000Z	Williams		Hi! I've got an executable bat file that I using as a shortcut to start a program. A password is needed to start it some times, but some times not. How can I fix that ?

2011-02-10T01:27:00.000Z	guntbert	Williams	then don't use it - live with the sudo prompt - if this scary program *really* has to be run as root
