2008-07-13T01:11:00.000Z	arash_		Hi, I'm about to buy a graphics card, I've heard ATI has bad compatibility with Linux and NVIDIA has good, is it true ? Im not going to be doing any gaming, so the card can be quite old
2008-07-13T01:11:00.000Z	sunc	arash_	there are drivers for all the common nvidia and ati cards for linux
2008-07-13T01:12:00.000Z	arash_	sunc	So I can go both ways huh? what about geforce?
2008-07-13T01:12:00.000Z	sunc	arash_	should be fine
