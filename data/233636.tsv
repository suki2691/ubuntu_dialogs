2005-06-09T09:19:00.000Z	SpookyET		Windows and Ubuntu both run at 1600x1200, 75.  However, when I boot into Ubuntu, the image is shifted right by a half a cm.  I'm tired to alwasy have to adjust the image each time I boot into Windows and Linux.  Does anyone have any idea on how to fix this?  x11 problem?
