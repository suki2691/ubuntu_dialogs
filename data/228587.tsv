2006-12-12T16:05:00.000Z	JebJoya		ooh, anyone know if my DHCP clients table listing the main pc (Fujitsu) as both 192.168.1.100 and ...101, with my laptop not being listed on the table (yet being given ...101) could be my issue (not an ubuntu issue i know, but if anyone has an idea, it'd be greatly appreciated)
