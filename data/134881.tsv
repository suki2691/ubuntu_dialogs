2009-11-11T21:59:00.000Z	nvme		does ubuntu run in virtual pc (win7 x64) ?
2009-11-11T22:00:00.000Z	nvme		and would it bet better to use virtual pc over virtualbox (considering performance / features available)
2009-11-11T22:01:00.000Z	simplexio	nvme	bo idea, but vbox works very good eith 9.10 and 768Mb ram, much better that 9.04 on same amount memory
2009-11-11T22:03:00.000Z	simplexio	nvme	far as i know vbox has all features that virtual pc offer (attlest that impression vpc home gives )
