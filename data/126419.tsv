2011-03-28T14:41:00.000Z	supe		I need help resolving gtksourceview dependencies so I can compile and install it. I need it for Gobby, which I'm also trying to compile. Here are my gtksourceview compile errors: http://pastebin.com/UzmX73pJ. I've spent the last hour trying to resolve them... help please?
2011-03-28T14:42:00.000Z	th0r	supe	none of that is an ubuntu issue
2011-03-28T14:43:00.000Z	supe	th0r	How about if I were compiling gedit? - Because that doesn't compile (with gtksourceview as a dependency)
2011-03-28T14:43:00.000Z	th0r	supe	compiling software is probably best supported in #c or #programming
