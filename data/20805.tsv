2012-08-27T01:20:00.000Z	BarkingFish		evening guys, can someone remind me of where the documentation for grub2 is please? I have a guy  in #kubuntu experiencing video issues and I want to switch him to a text only boot :)
2012-08-27T01:21:00.000Z	BarkingFish		he is getting black and white alternating lines when he picks to boot kubuntu, rather than a video output

2012-08-27T01:22:00.000Z	BarkingFish	thunkee	i want to get him to edit his config, I know i switched to text only by disabling plymouth and setting a verbose boot, also took out the splash option
