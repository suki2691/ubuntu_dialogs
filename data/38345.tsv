2010-05-04T14:16:00.000Z	Baram		I'm trying to re-install grub2 via the livecd (upgrade didn't go so well), wiki says to edit /etc/default/grub, but it's a blank file...
2010-05-04T14:17:00.000Z	viliny_	Baram	iirc grub2 uses a config file that you aren't supposed to manually edit... i might be wrong though
2010-05-04T14:17:00.000Z	Baram	viliny_	right, that's callled grub.cfg, which is different from /etc/default/grub
2010-05-04T14:18:00.000Z	viliny_	Baram	Yeah sounds about right, sorry to not been of more help.
