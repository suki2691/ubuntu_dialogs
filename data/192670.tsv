2011-01-20T05:48:00.000Z	foolhardy		how can I check for an ip dodgy_script ? - what is the cli's ipconfig
2011-01-20T05:48:00.000Z	greppy	foolhardy	ifconfig
2011-01-20T06:04:00.000Z	greppy	foolhardy	after doing a "apt-cache search wpa" I came up with "wpasupplicant" try that instead.
2011-01-20T06:05:00.000Z	greppy	foolhardy	there is also wicd-cli and wicd-curses, never used it, or wpasupplicant for that matter ,but it might help.
