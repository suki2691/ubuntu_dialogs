2009-08-04T21:16:00.000Z	mezquitale	DwightShroot	just reinstall flash and see what happens, go to a video on youtube and click on the link that sends you to the adobe website
2009-08-04T21:19:00.000Z	mezquitale	DwightShroot	it looks like the same thing happened to me, go to synaptic  and click on "adobe-flashplugin"
2009-08-04T21:23:00.000Z	mezquitale	DwightShroot	 uninstall it using synaptic and then reinstall it.  All I had to go is go to synaptic, search for "flash", I clicked on the square that said "adobe-flashplugin" and it installed it and configured it automatically
