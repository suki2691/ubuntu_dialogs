2006-11-11T09:10:00.000Z	sloucher		I just got a new SATA drive. It's great but it doesn't show up with df . How do I tell how much diskspace i'm using?
2006-11-11T09:11:00.000Z	khaije1	sloucher	df measures file systems not disks, is there a file system on it?
2006-11-11T09:11:00.000Z	sloucher	khaije1	yes everything is on one partition
