2008-09-29T20:08:00.000Z	RipperJ		i did...what i did was export=$PATH:/usr/local/games/alienareana2008 where crx is and when i type crx nothing
2008-09-29T20:09:00.000Z	RipperJ		i chmod +x crx typed in crx nothing
2008-09-29T20:09:00.000Z	scampbell	RipperJ	 ./crx  assuming crx is in the current directory.
