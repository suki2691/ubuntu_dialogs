2007-12-29T12:18:00.000Z	timfrost	Pengo-lx	because there isn't room on the CD for everything.  Use the alternate install CD, which is supposed to support RAID
2007-12-29T12:18:00.000Z	Pengo-lx	timfrost	can i get it to work via an apt-get install?
2007-12-29T12:20:00.000Z	timfrost	Pengo-lx	I don't know what package(s) would be needed
