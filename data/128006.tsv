2007-07-14T13:41:00.000Z	James		hello! can someone please tell me how to use unrar?
2007-07-14T13:42:00.000Z	bbryant_	James	type "man unrar" in the terminal
2007-07-14T13:43:00.000Z	bbryant_	James	unrar is a command, that comes from a package :-p
2007-07-14T13:44:00.000Z	bbryant_	James	that's odd. "unrar e filename.rar" should extract files then
