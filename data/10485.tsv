2011-08-13T17:10:00.000Z	caravel		Help please ! Natty, fresh install, system freezes : either black screen (eg. while switching users), or just frozen screen (eg. while playing full screen video). In all cases, magic keys have no effects, network is down (no more ssh, nor ping). Any hint or idea please ?
