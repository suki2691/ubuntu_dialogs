2012-08-16T13:56:00.000Z	mat619		Hey guys, got a kinda difficult question today: Could I set up an Ubuntu based print server that hosts a PDF printer in such a way, that a ages old legacy software running on a UNIX system (old Solaris 8) can print on it? That software usually just prints to a hardware printer with a given ID, likely with plain PS or PCL.
2012-08-16T13:56:00.000Z	mat619		TBH I've got no idea how linux based print servers work. I just know that in the given environment a windows print server won't work, that's why I'm exploring alternatives
2012-08-16T13:57:00.000Z	snowgrl373	mat619	it will probably work, will just take some setup... not really sure how though, ide turn to google maybe
2012-08-16T13:59:00.000Z	mat619	snowgrl373	tried googling the issue already, can't find anything really useful since everyone seems to try to host a printer for fellow linux or windows boxes on the network, not something like this dinosaur here
