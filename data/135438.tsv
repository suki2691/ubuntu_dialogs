2007-09-05T05:13:00.000Z	Filthpig	IdleOne	sure, but the question is "does ubuntu have that software available"?
2007-09-05T05:14:00.000Z	IdleOne	Filthpig	not certain. you can check on packages.ubuntu.com or search in Synaptic
2007-09-05T05:15:00.000Z	IdleOne	Filthpig	think tyou might need to talk with a few devs and see if they cant help you with what you need. ( do any coding? )
