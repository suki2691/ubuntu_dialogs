2008-05-07T16:59:00.000Z	umangme		 Hi, I had a question. After upgrading to 8.04 Thunderbird would quit by itself when I clicked Attach while composing a mail. I couldn't always reproduce this. I tried to upgrade nautilus from Synaptic, and now I can't reproduce it. Does this mean that I'm not likely to have the same error again?
