2007-04-21T16:12:00.000Z	Blubloblu	The_Un-Named	does your disc just contain the .iso file or does it have all the filesystem folders?
2007-04-21T16:16:00.000Z	Blubloblu	The_Un-Named	try using InfraRecorder to burn your disc
2007-04-21T16:16:00.000Z	Blubloblu	The_Un-Named	what OS are you using right now?
