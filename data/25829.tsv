2010-09-19T01:54:00.000Z	winterelf		hey there, i just installed ubuntu 10.04 , and install the "docky" ... i understand that it is not the same as gnome-do, but there is nothing on the web about it, i have no idea how to add "google search" like we have in gnome-do , and stuff like that, there is a build in programs and that's it, it's very minimal
2010-09-19T01:54:00.000Z	winterelf		have any idea?
