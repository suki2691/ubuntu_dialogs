2006-04-05T15:38:00.000Z	duelboot		I have a problem...I am attempting to install creative webcam and get the error at the following:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/11179  I have source and headers installed.  Any answers?
2006-04-05T15:40:00.000Z	AstralJava	duelboot	What does uname -r show you?
2006-04-05T15:45:00.000Z	AstralJava	duelboot	I dunno really, are they restricted modules that you need? What does apt-cache policy linux-restricted-modules-386 tell you?
2006-04-05T15:48:00.000Z	AstralJava	duelboot	That's okay, I have the same.
