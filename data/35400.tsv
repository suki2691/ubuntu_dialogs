2010-09-29T22:20:00.000Z	Eighteens		question: how would i encrypt private messages in ubuntu irc chat, like you can in windows/mirc chat with fish. Is there a fish plugin for ubuntu/irc chat, i googled, but not having much luck
2010-09-29T22:21:00.000Z	bobstro	Eighteens	 to protect against local sniffing, or do you want end-to-end encryption?
2010-09-29T22:21:00.000Z	Eighteens		i guess a better question would be what is the best irc chat client for ubuntu
2010-09-29T22:22:00.000Z	Eighteens	bobstro	just want to keep my private conversations private in chat
