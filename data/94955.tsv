2008-10-11T17:27:00.000Z	Luke771	King_Kickass	you can resize an NTFS partition with gparted but I've never done that. for a new install, you can leave your windows partition unformatted and let windows format it on install

2008-10-11T17:30:00.000Z	Luke771	King_Kickass	maybe you can run some third party defrag utility under wine, I dunno. but I would do that from within windows
