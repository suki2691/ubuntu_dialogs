2010-01-26T09:49:00.000Z	bombel	Gm4n	I remember that some years ago I tried sending an email with the "mail" command to my university mail and it worked. Without configuring any mail server. I realized that it is also not in the spam box. What should i do to configure a server mail to deliver emails ?
