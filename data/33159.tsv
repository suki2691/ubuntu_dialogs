I am sure I have learned this before but:  I have an Ubuntu desktop with tons of storage space; it holds all my music, videos, etc in folders shared on the network.  I also have an Ubuntu laptop.  I would like the ~/home/music folder on my lappy to connect to the shared /music folder on my desktop.  How do I make this happen?  I am sure I need to add an entry to fstab, but is there a GUI friendly version of this?  If not
2010-05-08T01:28:00.000Z	PorkusMcG		precisely do I need to put in the fstab.
