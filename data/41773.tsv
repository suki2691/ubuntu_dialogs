2011-08-11T19:09:00.000Z	mgj	TheFuzzball	agreed. But i dont think, in the future, that its reasonable for people to host and maintain their own cloud. The time and money required is simply too much. I really do believe, down the line, we will live completely in the cloud, no matter how much that may or may not suck for the users.
