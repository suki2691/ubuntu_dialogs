2007-05-04T14:47:00.000Z	MugginsM		fiery: yes, I've found one other report of someone saying it's when it's >200GB partition, I'm trying to do a 250
2007-05-04T14:48:00.000Z	eck	MugginsM	you ought to be able to do the partitioning manually on the command line and install into that (might be tricky if you have to do resizing manually though)
2007-05-04T14:48:00.000Z	MugginsM	eck	oh ok, so it's the installers partition program, not something deeper?
