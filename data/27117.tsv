2010-10-17T06:04:00.000Z	PaulNM		Last night I started an upgrade to 10.10 from 10.04 before going to bed. This morning I looked at the screen and it looks like the window manager got shut down, I see the windows, but no title bars. As a result, I can't switch to a prompt window to continue the upgrade.

2010-10-17T06:08:00.000Z	PaulNM	yonahw	I've been doing that. For some reason xterm will open, but I can't type in it.  So i had to go to another console and write a simple script to start matacity, which fails.
2010-10-17T06:09:00.000Z	yonahw	PaulNM	sorry, I am really quite the noob myself. Not sure how to help you.
