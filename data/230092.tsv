2006-01-12T08:11:00.000Z	rhythminmind		what = when
2006-01-12T08:12:00.000Z	indigo	rhythminmind	i don't have an nvidia card, but I do have an nforce motherboard, and i was getting the same thing
2006-01-12T08:13:00.000Z	indigo	rhythminmind	i think it went away when i upgraded my kernel to 2.6.14-3, but i reboot so rarely i'm not sure :)
