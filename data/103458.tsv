2008-01-18T08:30:00.000Z	mademoisl	desertc	thanks for the advice, but ive been using linux for a long time already, its been fun messing around with it, getting stuff to work, but time after time NEW problems show up, i think its better to return to a system that just works, so i can do something more useful
