I got Unetbootin and installed it on my hard drive and was able to boot but couldnt install ubuntu because i was booting from the same hard drive I was trying to install on. So i came in here and asked for help and a guy told me to get another internal hard drive 
2008-12-31T23:16:00.000Z	hckyplayer024		can someone help me with a problem installing ubuntu on an older computer?
