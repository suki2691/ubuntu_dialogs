2006-04-03T07:08:00.000Z	NytWuff		Could someone (or several) give me their views on partitions? Specifically for sizes and which to use (for example, instead of having one ext3 and one swap, have several for different directories)
2006-04-03T07:10:00.000Z	brenner	NytWuff	well for me, / is ~10GB, /home is ~30GB, swap is 512Mb
2006-04-03T07:11:00.000Z	NytWuff	brenner	Thanks. What would you recommend for a two hard drive system (a 10 gig and a 160gig)
2006-04-03T07:12:00.000Z	brenner	NytWuff	up to you, but i'd jjust do the 10 gig as / and /home as the 160gb.  you might want to split it up into partitions like you said though
