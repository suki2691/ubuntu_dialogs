2012-05-31T04:31:00.000Z	vexaxv	CoJaBo	when creating an encrypted file container say its named "library.vol" you can delete that infact anyone can, but thats the file to open so you can enter your password and get to your stuff, how do you set it to where it cant be deleted (kinda need it not to be being its MY only way in lol)
