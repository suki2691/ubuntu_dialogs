2010-01-14T04:20:00.000Z	elTigre		hey, I am trying to use skype on ubuntu... but my system is too slow (only dual core) and the sound is very bad...(rtapi alsa underrun) and the workarounds don't improve it a lot
2010-01-14T04:20:00.000Z	elTigre		could someone help me?
2010-01-14T04:20:00.000Z	militant	elTigre	i dunno anything about that, but my core2duo does just fine
2010-01-14T04:21:00.000Z	elTigre	militant	hm, skype isn't usable for me ... the sound output is garbled
