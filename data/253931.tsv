2005-01-10T08:09:00.000Z	mon		hi, i was taking a look at the Rosetta translation site, and i noticed there is "Dutch" and "Dutch Netherlands". what's the difference, why translate things twice?
2005-01-10T08:11:00.000Z	nakee	mon	maybe one is belgian or some other sort of dutch speaking country?
2005-01-10T08:23:00.000Z	mon	nakee	belgium is mentioned as well, just once though
2005-01-10T08:23:00.000Z	mon	nakee	would be a waste of time if things are double translated for some vague reason i think
