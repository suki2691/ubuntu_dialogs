2010-06-12T22:18:00.000Z	LogicalDash		There is one particular application that looks bad under my current GNOME theme. I'd like to make that application, and no other, use a different theme. How?
2010-06-12T22:18:00.000Z	SlidingHorn	LogicalDash	what program, and in what way do you want it to look different?
