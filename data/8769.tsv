2011-10-15T02:38:00.000Z	mike9863		Can anyone else assist me? I just upgraded to 11.10 and when I try to login it gives me an error that states: "could not update .ICEauthority file /home/mike/.ICEauthority. Also the login screen is the old one from 11.04 instead of the new one.

2011-10-15T02:41:00.000Z	mike9863	escott	I tried making the permissions 777 and I still get the error.
2011-10-15T02:43:00.000Z	escott	mike9863	who owns the file?
