2010-05-11T18:52:00.000Z	Shinydan		Just upgraded to 10.04 LTS and Flash (Youtube) audio wasn't working. Removed and reinstalled Flash and now there is audio, but it's very very quiet. Any ideas?

2010-05-11T18:54:00.000Z	Shinydan	airtonix	Yes. *facepalm* My housemates bloody cats managed to knock the volume on my speakers down to zero. *wears dunce cap*
