2007-12-16T11:15:00.000Z	LOWER_CASE		Hi, I've got some MS Access databases, some of which include forms, that I would like to migrate to something more open.  Suggestions, anyone? Thanks
2007-12-16T11:16:00.000Z	C1t1zenJ0hn	LOWER_CASE	 If they're simple databases[tables], port it over to [my]|[postgres]sl and use php for the first few iterations.

2007-12-16T11:18:00.000Z	LOWER_CASE	C1t1zenJ0hn	some are just addresses, etc, one includes 1/2 dozen forms that I don't want to lose.
