2009-11-21T05:48:00.000Z	Billiard	packet-sent	drag and drop kind of requires a mouse
2009-11-21T05:49:00.000Z	packet-sent	Billiard	I am aware of that, I want move functionality much same way I can make a symlink using drag and drop with the ctrl/shift keyboard shortcut
2009-11-21T05:50:00.000Z	Billiard	packet-sent	i dont understand what you want, you want to drag something and have it moved, not copied?
