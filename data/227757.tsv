2005-10-13T06:13:00.000Z	Hali_303		Hi! how big is a minimal ubuntu install? I'd need it for an embedded PC board (No X, gnome, kde and other fancy stuff)
2005-10-13T06:13:00.000Z	apokryphos	Hali_303	you can do a "server" install which is quite small. Not more than a gig, I'd think.
2005-10-13T06:14:00.000Z	Hali_303	apokryphos	debian installs (without selecting any packages) on 80MB
2005-10-13T06:15:00.000Z	apokryphos	Hali_303	it could indeed be a *lot* less; I don't know. A full default ubuntu install is 1.8 gigs, so I'm speculating here.
