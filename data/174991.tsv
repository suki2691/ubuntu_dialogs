2009-02-12T00:38:00.000Z	abhinay		The brightness controls are working in console mode Ctrl+Alt+F1 but not working at gnome, now what does it mean? any suggestions...? btw, I'm using Macbook3,1

2009-02-12T00:40:00.000Z	abhinay	pike_	i use xbacklight for that, but, I want to adjust the brightness with the brightness keys itself
