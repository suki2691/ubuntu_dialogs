2007-08-29T07:37:00.000Z	tatters		I got 2 hard drive 1st is devoted to ubuntu ,swap etc. the second I use for storage I want to try out linuxmce, if I resize my second drive with enough free space for my storage and linuxmce , install linuxmce to my second drive will the existing grub manager pick it up without having to configure the multi boot?

2007-08-29T07:41:00.000Z	tatters	Jack_Sparrow	I have no idea how it installs, I have the quick install dvd version, I guess I should just bite the bullet and see how it goes,btw can I use the same swap space for any linux distro or do they have to have their own?
