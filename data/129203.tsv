2007-11-01T22:23:00.000Z	Marfi		what is a good bittorrent client other than azureus? it keeps crashing on me
2007-11-01T22:24:00.000Z	kane77	Marfi	I'd say either ktorrent or deluge
2007-11-01T22:25:00.000Z	Marfi	kane77	from what i remember with ktorrent, there isn't much of an interface. i like being able to look at what it is doing with azureus...is deluge like that?
2007-11-01T22:26:00.000Z	kane77	Marfi	look at what? peers? files? newer version of ktorrent can show details..
