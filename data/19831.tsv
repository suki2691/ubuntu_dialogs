2011-09-18T04:48:00.000Z	JoseeAntonioR	rww	I'm testing with a Hotmail account. In the case that it's delayed, when can I test it again?
2011-09-18T04:49:00.000Z	rww	JoseeAntonioR	give it a few days, then email rt at ubuntu.com if it still isn't working
2011-09-18T04:50:00.000Z	JoseeAntonioR	rww	Ok, thanks. I'll do that in case it happens.
