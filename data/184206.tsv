2006-06-24T14:19:00.000Z	imbrandon	yoshiznit123	thats the command name ;)
2006-06-24T14:23:00.000Z	imbrandon	yoshiznit123	uninstall the app and reinstall it
2006-06-24T14:24:00.000Z	yoshiznit123	imbrandon	i can't uninstall it, its libdbus-1-2 and a bunch of things depend on it. I tried apt-get install --reinstall, but it says 'package cannot be downloaded'
