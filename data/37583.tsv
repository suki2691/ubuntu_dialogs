2010-02-09T07:46:00.000Z	acclaimtech		Is there a utility that will show you the progress of files copied using SSH?
2010-02-09T07:46:00.000Z	acclaimtech		yes but doesn't SCP move the data to your workstation and then back to the server?
2010-02-09T07:46:00.000Z	gsgleason	acclaimtech	scp will do this by default.
