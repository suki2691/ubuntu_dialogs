2010-10-13T15:31:00.000Z	travkin	cemc	what do you mean exactly with indexing?
2010-10-13T15:33:00.000Z	cemc	travkin	there's that app that indexes your files for quick searching or whatever. there's an icon that briefly appears when it's doing that, I think at startup
2010-10-13T15:34:00.000Z	travkin	cemc	Preferences -> Startup Applications - there have to be what are you looking for, like Indexing Service
