Here is my question: I installed Ubuntu 9.10 and grub didn't load Windows 7 properly (or I may have installed grub in wrong place, anyways, when I boot I get options for everything, but when I select windows 7, it dumps me back to the grub choose list, when i choose ubuntu it works, any ideas or want more information about it ask,
