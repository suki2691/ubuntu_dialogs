2011-03-24T23:09:00.000Z	quiescens		purge doesn't really do anything useful
2011-03-24T23:09:00.000Z	quiescens		for user-level packages
2011-03-24T23:09:00.000Z	quiescens		but sure, keep telling people to purge as though it will affect things like gui settings
2011-03-24T23:10:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	quiescens	isn't purge for uninstalling everything including configs? like "remove completely" in synaptic?
