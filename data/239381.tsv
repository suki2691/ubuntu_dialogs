2006-01-18T14:36:00.000Z	binarygod		quick question for someone:  I'm trying to compile some files that are on an external HDD (/dev/sda3) but I can't seem to access it from the terminal, any advice?
2006-01-18T14:36:00.000Z	binarygod		it is
2006-01-18T14:36:00.000Z	binarygod		have an icon on the desktop, but that doesn't show up either :)
2006-01-18T14:37:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	binarygod	: type df -h and check where it is mounted
