2010-12-16T09:48:00.000Z	CyberCod		are there any SSH ninja's hanging around?  I have a pretty hard question
2010-12-16T09:50:00.000Z	CyberCod		I'm trying to figure out how to start an application on Ubuntu by using a script on an Android phone.  I don't want the app to run in the ssh terminal, I want it to start and then be able to close the terminal and the program (Boxee) continue running.  I don't want the application to display on the phone, I want it to go to the Xserver of the sshd host.
2010-12-16T09:52:00.000Z	CyberCod		will a gui app like Boxee run in screen?
2010-12-16T09:53:00.000Z	bonjoyee	CyberCod	with proper DISPLAY variable set..it will run on ubuntu
