2008-06-19T13:21:00.000Z	Phobiac		My update to 8.04 from 7.10 is hanging at "setting up libuuid1 (1.40.8-2ubuntu2) .... could not connect to database" What can I do? Is it possible to stop the update and then restart it?
2008-06-19T13:22:00.000Z	Phobiac		Btw it's the server edition, if that changes anything.
2008-06-19T13:24:00.000Z	Phobiac		I'm pretty sure I can just restart the computer and when it starts up again I'm going to have to sudo dpkg-something but I'm not sure.
2008-06-19T13:26:00.000Z	Phobiac	Phobiac	So does anyone know if restarting the computer halfway through the update will mess it up completely? It's hanging and I can't think of any other option.
