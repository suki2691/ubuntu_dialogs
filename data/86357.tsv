2008-09-24T22:57:00.000Z	indian_munnda	Calum	when i enter bios there are 2 passwd options one is supervisor passwd and another is user passwd. But my system is not demandin any passwd for booting.

Also Nallep's suggestion seems wise - try chenging something harmless and see if next time you reboot it is still there or if ti has changed back
