2009-01-14T01:38:00.000Z	Slart	phaidros	try plugging it directly into the computer ie don't use an external hub.. apart from that I don't know.. usb stuff usually get detected properly
2009-01-14T01:40:00.000Z	phaidros	Slart	nope, plug unplug won't work. in best case it falls back to uhci .. most cases .. ehci errors galore :(
