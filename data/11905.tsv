2011-07-23T21:32:00.000Z	dvdr		ive got a usb wireless usb adaptor (awuso36h), works ok in ubuntu but I can't get it to run in a linux virtual machine (under virtualbox). The wireless adaptor is detected, it shows available networks etc but when I try to connect to a wpa2 secured network it reports "bad password". The exact same settings work in the host (ubuntu) machine. Any ideas? The driver is the same for both cases (rtl8187)
