2006-03-20T12:38:00.000Z	TraceGreenbaby		Hello, i ask this question in debian channel, nobody answer me, so , i ask here, what port does ping use?
2006-03-20T12:38:00.000Z	dj-fu	TraceGreenbaby	PING sends an ICMP ECHO request, ports refer to TCP/IP.
2006-03-20T12:39:00.000Z	TraceGreenbaby	dj-fu	sorry, but i don't understand, do you mean port would change when use ping?
2006-03-20T12:40:00.000Z	dj-fu	TraceGreenbaby	it's a different protocol altogether, Ping doesn't use ports.
