2009-06-07T22:13:00.000Z	mikebeecham	Xcell	oh man you SURE got me with that one...however, if you bothered to read my post you will undoubtedly see that I'm aware of liveCDs, and I was asking if there was ANOTHER way of trying it without bruning a lveCD.....seriously, if you need to respond then please do so with a degree of intelleigence and engage brain before opening the mouth!
