2011-03-21T20:17:00.000Z	fatal_ERROR7771		hello guys, I have a question, Does Linux support intel possessors as good as Nvidia + ATI ones? By saying it, I meant the feature (shadows, shaders, and so on) support.
2011-03-21T20:18:00.000Z	ikonia	fatal_ERROR7771	do you mean graphics cards ?
2011-03-21T20:18:00.000Z	ikonia	fatal_ERROR7771	if so intel has better (open) support than nvidia / ati, although the intel cards are not often as powerful
2011-03-21T20:22:00.000Z	fatal_ERROR7771	ikonia	Thank you for a reply. I'm planning to buy a new PC with a ubuntu/ windows dualboot, but I'm not sure what to choose - Nvidia, ATI, or Intel.
