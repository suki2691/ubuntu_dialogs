2012-09-02T23:52:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	terafl0ps	 there is no PID.  it autoterminates
2012-09-02T23:52:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	terafl0ps	 the PID stops working immediately after activation via start
2012-09-02T23:54:00.000Z	terafl0ps	TheLordOfTime	You still may be able to use lsof to look for anything accessing /run/rpc_pipefs
