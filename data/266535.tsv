2009-10-31T20:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ebtek220	 i likes to remove things  :) be sure what it wants to remove is what YOU want it to remove...
2009-10-31T20:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ebtek220	 like it always wants to remove all the 'unofficial' stuff ive installed.. which is not 'unused' by my definition
2009-10-31T20:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ebtek220	 when in doubt.. leave it alone... :)
