2006-05-10T12:51:00.000Z	yaaar		is there any way to make spatial nautilus not leave windows behind everywhere i go? i just want to progress through the filesystem in one window (which would change size/properties the way the spatial windows come up) but not end up with a window leftover for each subdirectory
