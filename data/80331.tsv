2009-02-11T07:08:00.000Z	redvamp128	Dillizar	 1st place to check is the system logs..
2009-03-03T06:50:00.000Z	redvamp128	Dillizar	 I think you are thinking of Winedoors or boardeux (but both depend on a wine to be installed)
2009-03-03T06:51:00.000Z	redvamp128	Dillizar	 unless you are thinking of Dos-box
