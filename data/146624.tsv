2012-10-03T23:26:00.000Z	BluesKaj	webjocky	did you try the recovery kernel in grub , choose repair broken packages in the dialog , then reboot
2012-10-03T23:27:00.000Z	webjocky	BluesKaj	haven't tried anything yet. I'm still pretty green @ Ubuntu or any *nix for that matter. Trying the recovery kernel now...
2012-10-03T23:57:00.000Z	webjocky	BluesKaj	repair broken packages did the trick - thanks for teaching me to fish.
