2009-01-09T00:29:00.000Z	peeps[work]		i need help with the keyboard shortcut settings of gnome-terminal.  I want to disable a shortcut, but I can't figure out how.
2009-01-09T00:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	peeps[work]	Check to see if it is a shortcut in compiz as they sometimes conflict
2009-01-09T00:31:00.000Z	peeps[work]	Jack_Sparrow	I click on a shortcut and it prompts me for "New accelerator".  But I don't know what to press to tell it to just disable.  anything I press it will try to interpret as the new shortcut to use.
2009-01-09T00:31:00.000Z	peeps[work]	Jack_Sparrow	i don't use compiz, it's not a conflict, I just don't know how to tell it I don't want to use this shortcut
