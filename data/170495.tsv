2009-05-05T10:39:00.000Z	Livingroom		redsocrates: i've been trying to make this work for days. i'm not leaving ubuntu, because i want a stable linux desktop. but i'm very fed up with it not working.
2009-05-05T10:41:00.000Z	Livingroom		redsocrates: as a prospective user of a desktop OS, should i care that hardware people dont want to work with linux/ubuntu? no: i should care only to install, run some basic configuration, maybe even be asked what soundcard i have- and then have it work, out of the box. there is, again, absoloutely NO reason for it not to "JUST WORK"
