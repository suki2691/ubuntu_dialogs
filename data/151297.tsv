2007-09-05T13:51:00.000Z	kauer		here's a question: Is it possible, with GNOME and a single monitor, to have multiple separate desktops and switch between them? The window switcher is good, but all the desktops are the same (same taskbars, same icons etc).

2007-09-05T09:45:00.000Z	shriphani	kauer	it is supposed to happen automagically.
2007-09-05T09:47:00.000Z	kauer	shriphani	yes. thank you. Let me rephrase the question: Is there any way to force the udev automounting magic to happen?
