2009-06-02T04:29:00.000Z	funkyHat	dtchen	do you remember the name of the package that provided that wrapper hack for flash and pulseaudio?
2009-06-02T04:30:00.000Z	dtchen	funkyHat	which? libflashsupport/flashplugin-nonfree-extrasound?
2009-06-02T04:31:00.000Z	funkyHat	dtchen	libflashsupport I think, thanks
