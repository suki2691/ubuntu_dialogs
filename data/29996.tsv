2010-09-13T04:52:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		is there a safe way to upgrade vim to the latest 7.3 on ubuntu 10.04, after apt-get upgrade im still on 7.2
2010-09-13T04:53:00.000Z	r007	SolarisBoy	install it from source
2010-09-13T04:54:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	r007	cool thats what looked like the best option, should i have to uninstall/ do anything with the previously installed version which came with my default install?
2010-09-13T04:54:00.000Z	r007	SolarisBoy	I would remove the current package beforehand
