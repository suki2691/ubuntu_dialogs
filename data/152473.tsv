I had been looking into a Linux OS for quite soem time and felt nwowoudl be the best time. Ubuntu seemed like a good begginer Linux OS. I was wondering if someone could either explain in detail or link me to a comprehensive guidon how to intall ubuntu w/o a current OS and or a CD-Rom. I have heard of Booting from floppy and I have a USB CD reader but

2006-12-30T08:18:00.000Z	Ebagen02		is it possible to boot to a basic Ubuntu OS by floppy (one that could recognize USB devices) then install using an install CD?
