2005-04-21T10:26:00.000Z	SuperQ	capi	I'm planing to migrate my current server (Debian/sarge) to Ubuntu
2005-04-21T10:26:00.000Z	SuperQ	capi	even with 6 month releases, (I'll probably just do yearly, if they keep their promise to do updates for 18 months)
2005-04-21T10:27:00.000Z	SuperQ	capi	it's better than the uncertinty of Sarge never making it out the door
