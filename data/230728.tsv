2005-10-15T12:41:00.000Z	apollo2011		the problem I am having with xmms is due to the iTouch plugin.  Everytime I enable the plugin, xmms crashes and closes itself.  The plugin worked fine before I upgraded to Breezy.  Any ideas on whats causing this problem>

2005-10-15T12:42:00.000Z	apollo2011	TiMiDo	well I did run it, and it comes back with a vague error about GDK.  I had a Hoary installation I upgraded on my Dell Inspiron 8600 laptop, and the plugin works fine on it.
