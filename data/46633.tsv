2009-10-07T10:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	jbk_	biped I'm aware that vfat doesn't support symlinks (i actually pointed this out), but there should be a way to tell "cp" to copy the actual files instead of trying to copy the link???
2009-10-07T10:37:00.000Z	jbk_	ZykoticK9	yeah.. it's in there.. but perhaps look at the dereference option
2009-10-07T10:37:00.000Z	jbk_	ZykoticK9	try with -L
