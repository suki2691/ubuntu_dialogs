2007-01-14T17:52:00.000Z	Mersault		My installation of mplayer has stopped accepting ESC as a way of killing the video window. This happened when I upgraded to Edgy. Anyone have any ideas why?
2007-01-14T17:53:00.000Z	xiq	Mersault	perhaps a change in /etc/mplayer/input.conf ? add a line "ESC quit" if you want.
2007-01-14T17:53:00.000Z	Mersault	xiq	that line is already there.
2007-01-14T17:54:00.000Z	xiq	Mersault	hmm, dunno, sorry.
