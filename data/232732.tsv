2011-01-08T01:04:00.000Z	poseidon		So I'm setting up ubuntu for my eight year old sister.  I will be going back to uni soon.  Is tunneling X over ssh the best way for me to be able to remotely fix problems?
2011-01-08T01:05:00.000Z	poseidon		Also, any tips for setting it up for a kid?
2011-01-08T01:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	poseidon	use edubuntu ( colorfull defaul theme etc ...) plain ssh should be enough for many problems
2011-01-08T01:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	poseidon	you can install the edubuntu metapackages after install too
