2012-07-30T04:52:00.000Z	nonickmick		I have a question, i have two hard drives in my pc, one has windows installed on it, the second hard drive is brand new, if i install ubuntu on that second drive, do you see any issues from this ? I plan to just change the boot menu to the hard drive of the OS i wish to use.
