2009-08-26T02:03:00.000Z	blip-		hi all,  I'm running 8.10 for a long time and have all my configs made etc...   do you think it's worth updating to 9.04 ?
2009-08-26T02:03:00.000Z	blip-		I'm guessing it's stable enough by now
2009-08-26T02:03:00.000Z	blip-		I don't want to upgrade, I'd rather do a clean install and copy over the configs
