2008-12-02T06:48:00.000Z	ardchoille	Eurysilas	you're using nvidia with installed drivers?
2008-12-02T06:50:00.000Z	Eurysilas	ardchoille	Nope. Though, I gather they've had trouble as well. I use intel drivers (I'm integrated).
2008-12-02T06:50:00.000Z	ardchoille	Eurysilas	ah, ok, I had that problem with the nvidia 173 driver
