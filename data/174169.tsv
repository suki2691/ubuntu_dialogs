2008-07-23T11:29:00.000Z	cpk1	UBestB	I think sed will do it
2008-07-23T11:30:00.000Z	cpk1	UBestB	I am guessing since it has an option that lets you "use extended regular expressions in the script." I am going to say yes
2008-07-23T11:32:00.000Z	cpk1	UBestB	"info sed" should give you the whole manual
