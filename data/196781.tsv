2006-08-04T09:27:00.000Z	scheuri		all
2006-08-04T09:28:00.000Z	scheuri		anyone tried to install freeciv (with aptitude) and actually play it? I dont find the the appropriate command to do so ("freeciv" or alike is NOT existant)
2006-08-04T09:29:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	scheuri	dpkg -L freeciv (you will find the executable somewhere in /usr/games probably)
