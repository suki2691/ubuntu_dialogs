2007-07-12T14:03:00.000Z	user101		ok... next issue.... why does the nvidia driver installer tell me that i haven't got libc... when i got gcc.. which i think should come along with libc?
2007-07-12T14:04:00.000Z	ScorpKing	user101	i think a gcc-dev package or something is missing.
2007-07-12T14:05:00.000Z	user101	ScorpKing	didn't find it on apt-get... dunno where i could find it...
2007-07-12T14:07:00.000Z	ScorpKing	user101	sorry, i'm on a windows box. :-( but it's needed to compile packages.
