2006-08-13T10:47:00.000Z	sahasrara		ok isn't this torrent thing risky? getting files from strangers, how do i know my ubuntu is safe?
2006-08-13T10:48:00.000Z	rast4	sahasrara	if you're willing to leech it on a torrent, why not get it from the ubuntu site?
2006-08-13T10:49:00.000Z	sahasrara	rast4	isn't it faster from torrents? and i don't have to get it all at once? i'm on dialup
