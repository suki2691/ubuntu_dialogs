2008-01-25T09:23:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV	ablyss	how can i check that
2008-01-25T09:24:00.000Z	ablyss	VvWolverinevV	perhaps accessing tty8 while shutting down to watch system messages... i think that might work
2008-01-25T09:24:00.000Z	ablyss		i forget what tty stdout goes too.. it might matter
2008-01-25T09:26:00.000Z	ablyss	VvWolverinevV	fyi acessing another tty is as simple as pressing <alt><ctrl><function_keys>
