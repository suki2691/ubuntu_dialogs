2006-12-30T09:50:00.000Z	wikijeff		Is there a limitation on what USB drives work with ubuntu? I'd like to purchase this one, but would like to be sure that it will work. http://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Traveler-Flash-DTI-1GB/dp/B000AV14M2/sr=1-1/qid=1167449940/ref=sr_1_1/104-4894288-8747105?ie=UTF8&s=pc
