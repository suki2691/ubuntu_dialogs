2010-02-15T00:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	Fraxtil	pretty bad; that's where passwords are stored
2010-02-15T00:30:00.000Z	Fraxtil	erUSUL	I think when I backed up my system, it didn't copy /etc/shadow for whatever reason. How should I recover this?
2010-02-15T00:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	Fraxtil	:/ dunno if it is even possible ...
