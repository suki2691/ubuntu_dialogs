2007-05-05T09:20:00.000Z	Miles_Prower		In Ubuntu-PPC 6.10, on an Ibook G4, the mouse takes like 6 goes-across to reach the width of the screen. How can I make it travel further with the same motion?>
2007-05-05T09:20:00.000Z	Pelo	Miles_Prower	 menu > system > prefs > mouse  I believe you can set the mouse motion in there
2007-05-05T09:22:00.000Z	Pelo	Miles_Prower	that was my only suggestion
2007-05-05T09:22:00.000Z	Pelo	Miles_Prower	 you might also try chainging the mouse vailues in xorg.conf
