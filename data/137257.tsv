2008-02-06T07:58:00.000Z	gortba		Hi. Can someone tell me if this is possible. I have a USB only printer. I run ubuntu as a router, DNS, DHCP etc for my home network. Is it possible to install the usb printer on my Ubuntu computer and have my other computers access it to print?
2008-02-06T07:59:00.000Z	gortba		Or do I need to get a network printer?
