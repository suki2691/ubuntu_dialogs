2008-05-31T18:50:00.000Z	Freeaqingme		I just installed kde4 as well as kdm4, There's one problem however, kde4 is not listed as a possible session in kdm. How do I add it to kdm4?

2008-05-31T18:53:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	Freeaqingme	Or actually it should be #kubuntu-kde4, sorry about that typo.
2008-05-31T18:54:00.000Z	Freeaqingme	Steve-Cal	I got it, ty ;)
