2010-07-30T21:14:00.000Z	Alonea		how do I get my grub screen to show up now? This new kernel broke my wireless card and I want to load the previous one
2010-07-30T21:15:00.000Z	Alonea		!grub
2010-07-30T21:15:00.000Z	oCean_	Alonea	hold shift during startup should show grubmenu
2010-07-30T21:16:00.000Z	Alonea	oCean_	ok, and I remember a way to change the default one it loads somewhere.
