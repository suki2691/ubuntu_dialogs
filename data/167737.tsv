2009-11-05T03:56:00.000Z	markgreene	tormod	It is, but it is a requirement that I develop using the actual version and release
2009-11-05T03:56:00.000Z	tormod	markgreene	corporate requirement :) you can try to install the hardy packages
2009-11-05T03:57:00.000Z	tormod	markgreene	unless something important in 9.10 depends on perl 10, but I don't think so
