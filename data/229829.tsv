2005-10-25T08:37:00.000Z	sykopomp		I need a liveCD for PPC that lets me shrink existing partitions
2005-10-25T08:38:00.000Z	bimberi	sykopomp	the Breezy LiveCD has gparted (on i386, not sure about PPC)
2005-10-25T08:40:00.000Z	bimberi	sykopomp	no it doesn't :/ (something that was corrected for breezy)
