2012-06-15T13:51:00.000Z	klops	ikonia	do you know anything about debugging suspend/resume in 12.04?
2012-06-15T13:52:00.000Z	ikonia	klops	I've done bits and bobs in the past, but it's normally an issue with an ati video card module or a broadcom network card module, so I rarley bother going beyond that
2012-06-15T13:54:00.000Z	ikonia	klops	sorry to be negative but it will go no-where, suspend has knonw issues with the ati cards.....
2012-06-15T13:55:00.000Z	ikonia	klops	hence why I said earlier, I never bother going beyond that because it is just a fact that won't change at this time
