2011-01-08T10:14:00.000Z	Sterist		hello i'm having a problem with my Live CD (installed on USB) getting recognized as SDA and the internal hard drive as SDB. does anyone know how to solve this?
2011-01-08T10:16:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	Sterist	what issue is having the two recognized as such causing you?
2011-01-08T10:17:00.000Z	Sterist	q_a_z_steve	when i install ubuntu onto the hard drive (which is SDB) and try to boot i get an error
