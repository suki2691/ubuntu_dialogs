2008-12-07T05:04:00.000Z	the_grouch		I realize that ubuntu is created with multicore processors in mind; however, is ubuntu studio also optimized for dual and quad core?
2008-12-07T05:05:00.000Z	the_grouch		anyone?
2008-12-07T05:06:00.000Z	node357	the_grouch	ubuntu studio does not support multiple processors as far as I know
