2007-12-01T12:21:00.000Z	dns53		it is gui based
2007-12-01T12:23:00.000Z	dns53		how are you running it, if you run it in a terminal the DISPLAY veriable that tells the application where the screen is can get messed up, run it through the menu or another terminal
2007-12-01T12:23:00.000Z	labinns1	dns53	The problem is this document cannot be read by adobe. In fact nothing goes to my PDF directory unless I select print to file
