2008-02-02T00:40:00.000Z	somnambulist	ctrader	great, let me know what you find
2008-02-02T00:42:00.000Z	ctrader	somnambulist	are all of the clients going to be on the same subnet, sharing the same pool of IP's?
2008-02-02T00:49:00.000Z	somnambulist	ctrader	i've decided to put them on different subnets, that makes it easy, thanks :)
