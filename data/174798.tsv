2006-07-15T07:52:00.000Z	Taza		What kind of install should I pick if I want both Xubuntu and a LAMP server for a p2?
2006-07-15T07:52:00.000Z	Taza		Both Gnome and KDE are too heavy for that computer.
2006-07-15T07:53:00.000Z	hawkaloogie	Taza	I'd start with the ubuntu server install, and then apt-get install xubuntu-desktop (iirc)
2006-07-15T07:54:00.000Z	Taza	hawkaloogie	Thanks. I got the server CD and am atm installing the LAMP version of the install.
