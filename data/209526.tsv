2012-03-28T18:25:00.000Z	LjL	detch1	isn't it all installed in /opt?
2012-03-28T18:25:00.000Z	LjL	detch1	then just removing the directory from /opt/ should work
2012-03-28T18:26:00.000Z	LjL	detch1	actually i don't think you should have problems even if you *don't* remove it, but again, it should be as simple as removing the directory
