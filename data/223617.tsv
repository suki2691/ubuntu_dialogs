2006-05-29T10:50:00.000Z	kestas		hey, I'd like to order some ubuntu 6.06 CDs now, the front page seemed to give me the impression I could do this
2006-05-29T10:50:00.000Z	kestas		but the shipit page does't say which version it ships
2006-05-29T10:51:00.000Z	kestas		so Im not sure if it'll send me 5.10 or reserve me 6.06
2006-05-29T10:51:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	kestas	Yeah, you can order them now. I ordered 10 ubuntu and 10 kubuntu yesterday
