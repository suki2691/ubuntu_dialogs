2009-02-17T20:06:00.000Z	SmokeyD	HoNgOuRu	depends on how it is setup. But isn't it your home dir?
2009-02-17T20:08:00.000Z	HoNgOuRu	SmokeyD	I' ve installed it as root
2009-02-17T20:09:00.000Z	SmokeyD	HoNgOuRu	That is not what I meant. You asked what folder you end up in after you login through ftp to your ftp server right?
