2008-07-10T11:14:00.000Z	ansichart		Hello, I am having a problem changing my MAC address on my Atheros wifi card.  When I change it with ifconfig, it shows that it has changed... however my card will ignore anything addressed to the spoofed MAC address.
2008-07-10T11:14:00.000Z	ansichart		I think my chipset restricts me from doing it, but I am trying to find a work-around solution for this.

2008-07-10T11:17:00.000Z	ansichart	magnetron	I'll also look into that.
