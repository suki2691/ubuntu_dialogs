2011-08-20T23:32:00.000Z	Slart	symaxian	nautilus is responsible for rendering the icons, afaik. There are other systems for doing this in say KDE or similar.. anything special you're looking to do?
2011-08-20T23:34:00.000Z	symaxian	Slart	nothing special, just something interactive to fill the empty space on a desktop with just a wallpaper
2011-08-20T23:34:00.000Z	Slart	symaxian	you don't want to use nautilus? or it doesn't work for you?
