2006-03-14T15:48:00.000Z	Viper_0		hi , i can't connect via ssh to Ubuntu, gives me the following error Network Error : Connection Refused , why?
2006-03-14T15:49:00.000Z	djm62	Viper_0	is sshd installed /and/ enabled?
2006-03-14T15:51:00.000Z	djm62	Viper_0	ps aux | grep ssh
2006-03-14T15:53:00.000Z	djm62	Viper_0	that's the command you used to search, not sshd :-/
