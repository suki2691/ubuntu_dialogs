2006-12-07T12:50:00.000Z	OneSeventeen		I am setting up an Ubuntu 6.06 LAMP server, and want to be able to use OpenOffice.org and Inkscape from the command line (which requires me to install X)  should I install X, or just start over with a standard desktop install and add Apache, PHP , and MySQL?

2006-12-07T12:51:00.000Z	OneSeventeen	CydeWeys	thanks, I just wanted to make sure there wasn't a reason to avoid that approach
2006-12-07T12:52:00.000Z	CydeWeys	OneSeventeen	As far as I'm aware they're just different sets of initially installed packages.
