2011-03-02T04:05:00.000Z	dborba		hey fellas - having a weird problem. so i just set up a new box & when i tried to login authentication failed. i thought it was rather weird since it's a password i use by muscle memory & chances of me mistyping it twice during installation were minimal. anyways - started a root shell in recovery mode & ran passwd. got the warning password unchanged... what is going on?
