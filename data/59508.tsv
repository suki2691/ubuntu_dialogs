2009-04-24T20:57:00.000Z	snipd		Hi, i updated from ubuntu server 8.10 to 9.04 last night. the update finished, but this morning when i went to boot it up, it got stuck at GRUB. anyone know what to do when it says
2009-04-24T20:57:00.000Z	snipd		"gave up waiting for root device."

2009-04-24T20:59:00.000Z	snipd	sceo	ok, sounds like its worth a shot
