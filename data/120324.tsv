2008-04-05T19:05:00.000Z	xanax`		when you upgrade from ubuntu 7 to 8 with apt-get, is there a command that I may try in the console to be sure I run ubuntu 8.04 ?
2008-04-05T19:05:00.000Z	bazhang	xanax`	that would be in #ubuntu+1 and the command is lsb_release -a
2008-12-25T20:18:00.000Z	bazhang	xanax`	#ubuntu+1 for questions on next release
