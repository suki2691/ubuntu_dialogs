2012-01-16T02:56:00.000Z	WhiteOwl-m		I have a question (general): How is it possible that a wifi connection between two computers (say transfering files) is so much slower than wifi connection between 1 computer and the internet (say downloading files)??
2012-01-16T02:57:00.000Z	WhiteOwl-m		I have 688kb/s between Ubuntu and win7 (using samba) and a 5mbit/s connection between win7 and internet..
