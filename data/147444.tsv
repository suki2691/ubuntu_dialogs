2007-10-06T05:13:00.000Z	_Andrew	hou5ton	There is one built in. When you pop in a blank CD, an icon pops up on your desktop if you drag items into the CD icon and click burn it will burn those files to the CD
2007-10-06T05:14:00.000Z	hou5ton	_Andrew	 agreed ... but it doesn't show me how full the CD is getting as I add things, and there didn't appear to be an intuitive way to remove something from the burn.
2007-10-06T05:16:00.000Z	hou5ton	_Andrew	 you too.  :-)
