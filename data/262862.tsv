2005-11-28T11:03:00.000Z	l0cke		I am trying to find a file on my desktop through terminal. When I type dir it says desktop but when I do cd desktop it says not found. is cd even the right command?
2005-11-28T11:04:00.000Z	aspro	l0cke	try using cd de-<tab> (autocomplete)
2005-11-28T11:08:00.000Z	aspro	l0cke	I mean start typing desktop, but before you finish hit tab
2005-11-28T11:11:00.000Z	aspro	l0cke	no colon after cd
