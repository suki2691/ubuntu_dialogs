2008-04-04T03:07:00.000Z	gone		Is it just to install the new version ontop of the old one? (Pidgin)
2008-04-04T03:08:00.000Z	Pelo	gone	if it is a prog from the repos , it will update automaticaly when  a newer package becomes availbale
2008-04-04T03:08:00.000Z	Pelo	gone	you are better off waiting for the next distro but if you realy want to install a new version, remove the previous one first
