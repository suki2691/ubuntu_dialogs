2009-05-25T06:11:00.000Z	ozzmosis	boss_mc	I get A/V sync problems with AviDemux and DVB files.  I use it for editing analogue captures, where it works better, although it doesn't seem to be frame accurate.
2009-05-25T06:12:00.000Z	boss_mc	ozzmosis	I've not had problems with it, but I've not really stressed it much
