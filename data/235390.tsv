2005-08-24T07:08:00.000Z	jeremi		I am triing to get my clock to stop displaying military time can any one help
2005-08-24T07:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	jeremi	you mean 24hr time? right click, select Preferences (assuming you're in Gnome...)
2005-08-24T07:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	jeremi	in Preferences, put it to 12hr time - that works for me, altough I use 24hr time myself
2005-08-24T07:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	jeremi	might want to ask on #kubuntu?
