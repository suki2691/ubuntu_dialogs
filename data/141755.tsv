2007-04-05T13:21:00.000Z	GekiBlue		So I just burned a DVD with Gnomebaker... and my DVD Player, which is supposed to support DVD-Rs... Doesn't play it... Is it something I did wrong burning or would it be my DVD Player?
2007-04-05T13:21:00.000Z	GekiBlue		I burned it at the highest setting... and that's about the only input I had.
2007-04-05T13:21:00.000Z	tombow	GekiBlue	did you just burn a video file onto a disc or something?
2007-04-05T13:22:00.000Z	GekiBlue	tombow	no... I used gnomebaker's 'burn DVD image'
