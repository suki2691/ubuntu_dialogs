2008-12-05T13:02:00.000Z	gibobo		I just can't understand why ubuntu cannot handle dial-up modems ( on laptops) I tough that it was the easiest of the ways to connect to internet. And I don't get it that it wasn'nt a priority. Ubuntu is supposed to help people who cannot afford an expensive OS, like in poor countries ( africa). Do you think that they all have Wifi and ADSL?

2008-12-05T13:03:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	gibobo	you should have checked to see if your modem was supported to begin with
2008-12-05T13:04:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	gibobo	and ubuntu is not supposed to help people who cannot afford an expensive OS... thats not the mission statement or goal
