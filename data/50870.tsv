2009-08-31T19:52:00.000Z	gotunandan	mnaines	heavy RAM usage is ok, depending on which applications you have open
2009-08-31T19:52:00.000Z	mnaines	gotunandan	Normally, the RAM use is between 400MB and 800MB, with the heaviest processes being Pidgin and Nautilus
2009-08-31T19:57:00.000Z	gotunandan	mnaines	Its fairly normal, I am currently running Firefox, Pidgin and have 1.5 GB used, the thing is that in RAM, caching takes place, so that say you close firefox, it would not take more time to start it up again
