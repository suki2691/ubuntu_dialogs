2009-01-21T04:50:00.000Z	Fred1447		I've just installed 8.10 while carrying over the /home folder from a previous Ubuntu-mint installation. The install went fine, and the first boot was great, but after updating all packages, it asked me to restart, and then the monitor goes into powersave mode after the ubuntu loading screen. (can still hear the startup sound though). I also installed ubuntu-restricted-extras if that makes a difference...
