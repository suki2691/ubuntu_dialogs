2009-05-23T18:33:00.000Z	efjc		vim doesn't show background color, i think the terminal doesn't have 256 colors. am i right? what to do?
2009-05-23T18:34:00.000Z	jrib	efjc	set t_CO=256 ?
2009-05-23T18:35:00.000Z	efjc	jrib	yes, i've tried that. it seems to me that it's the terminal that is the problem (gvim works fine)
2009-05-23T18:36:00.000Z	jrib	efjc	gnome-terminal should work fine
