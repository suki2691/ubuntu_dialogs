2007-04-18T10:19:00.000Z	Pelo	ferret_0567_	 probably not
2007-04-18T10:21:00.000Z	Pelo	ferret_0567_	 do not turn off rsync
2007-04-18T10:23:00.000Z	Pelo	ferret_0567_	 if you would like my advice,   turning off useless processes is a very good idea,  rule of thumb, if you don'T know what it does , don'T mess with it
