2009-12-22T11:30:00.000Z	JeffOB		so I should use an older ubuntu on this PC?

2009-12-22T11:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	JeffOB	1) I'd recommend the !alternate CD for installing, 2) You could even use the low-memory installation option, but at 256 I don't think you need it.  3) Consider using LXDE for your GUI instead of Gnome - you can get it by installing a minimal system first, and then 'apt-get install lubuntu-desktop'.
