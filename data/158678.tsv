I had it set up fine, and it was working, and I was even using git with ssh to push to a server. My keys were also working properly. However, suddenly it stopped working, and I haven't tried to make any changes. This started with an attempt to access my server through ssh, and it told me that the host rsa key did not match, which was strange. I deleted the known_host

2009-02-16T03:18:00.000Z	Slart	ehsanul	oh.. no.. there was an update where after the update you had to generate new keys.. but this was.. something like a couple of months ago
2009-02-16T03:19:00.000Z	Slart	ehsanul	oh.. well.. then I don't really know
