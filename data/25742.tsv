2011-04-22T16:39:00.000Z	Festiefos		is this the right place for help?
2011-04-22T16:41:00.000Z	Festiefos		I'm new to ubuntu and I'm trying to install a printer (Canon Pixma MP499). I've downloaded the drivers (printer and scanner) but don't know where to put them or what to do with them. I'm not a computer genius, but I'm also not a total fool, I'm just very new to this OS. Any help would be appreciated
