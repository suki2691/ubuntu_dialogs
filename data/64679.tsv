2010-08-05T04:21:00.000Z	anml		I am receiving the "error: no such device" message when I try to boot into Win/Ubuntu.
2010-08-05T04:22:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	anml	likely a grub error?  are you using grub1 or grub2 (if you're not sure tell what version of ubuntu you are using, AND if it was upgraded or not)
2010-08-05T04:22:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	anml	do the change root stuff from CD and let GRUB2 try to automatically resetup
2010-08-05T04:24:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	anml	you need to read the link ubottu gave you.  best of luck man, ask if you have any questions after reading it.
