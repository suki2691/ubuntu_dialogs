2006-11-12T11:41:00.000Z	graeme	QuantumG	nope, I just wanted a app so I could channel surf. Not interested in any extra hardware. Just an internet based thingy ...
2006-11-12T11:44:00.000Z	QuantumG	graeme	dpkg deinstall blah.deb is probably what you're after
2006-11-12T11:45:00.000Z	graeme	QuantumG	there is no dpkg uninstall command ....
