2010-10-22T14:19:00.000Z	gaelfx		I'm getting an error in my log file "ata1.00: device reported invalid CHS sector 0" whenever I put something into my dvd drive, where would be a good place to look for solutions to this problem?

2010-10-22T14:19:00.000Z	gaelfx	Aer	but I personally prefer not to do that  if at all possible
2010-10-22T14:20:00.000Z	lucent	gaelfx	is there a problem, or just that error message?
