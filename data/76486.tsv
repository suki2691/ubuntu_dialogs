2008-11-26T02:47:00.000Z	xr0ckstar		slart you could make a new session of terminal and rename it to whatever you want
2008-11-26T02:48:00.000Z	Slart	xr0ckstar	yea, but I was kind of looking for something a bit more automatic.. a hidden setting, compile switch or something
2008-11-26T02:49:00.000Z	xr0ckstar	Slart	it may be possible to set up some kind of script and run a command when you open that particular session of terminal
