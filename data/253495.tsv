2005-01-13T13:42:00.000Z	ArCHoNKoG	sir_latin	yes
2005-01-13T13:43:00.000Z	sir_latin	ArCHoNKoG	how? I tried to check out with the package system, and apt-get. But they are not there. does it mean I have to do this manually and make it eventually unstable?
2005-01-13T13:43:00.000Z	sir_latin	ArCHoNKoG	I've installed it on a VM, and planning to install it on a Pentium 233 Mhz MMX with 48 MB RAM, so I'd rather not use Gnome...
