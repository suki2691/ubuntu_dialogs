2006-12-27T13:39:00.000Z	pluto		Hi, Im trying to back up one of my DVDs that I just bought to prevent scratches. It's a DVD9, and I want it to fit on a DVD5. K9copy always crashes when it gets to 99 percent of the read. Any way to copy from the command line or with another application? I want original menus etc.
