2012-01-03T18:12:00.000Z	theadmin	flatline	It's not even released yet. It's not dead, but I don't think a channel will exist for a non-existing project. When some initial release is made, we'll have one
2012-01-03T18:14:00.000Z	flatline	theadmin	I'm interested in the project, also would like to contribute since I will be using it on a work project if that goes well. :(
2012-01-03T18:16:00.000Z	flatline	theadmin	nope, indeed I've been using fedora for our server instances for a long time and started using ubuntu-server for the last 3-6 months. ubuntu-server support is pretty much superior to any other distro server edition.
