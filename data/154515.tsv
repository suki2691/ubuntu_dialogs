2006-12-14T17:40:00.000Z	GlutenBoy		Question: But first of all I must say that I'm now using Ubuntu as my primary OS for the first time and I don't regret it so far...
2006-12-14T17:41:00.000Z	drkm	GlutenBoy	same here.. how long has it been your primary OS?
2006-12-14T17:42:00.000Z	GlutenBoy		My question is: what is the best file system to share a drive between WinOS and Linux, should I use FAT32? Right now I use NTFS but I read that writing to this is still in beta (not always statble).
2006-12-14T17:43:00.000Z	GlutenBoy	drkm	About a month or so
