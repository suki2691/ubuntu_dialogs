2010-08-23T05:08:00.000Z	sihnu		hello, could someone help me? I compiled a development version of package and now I would like to get rid of it but I just don't know how
2010-08-23T05:08:00.000Z	sihnu		I would like to reinstall the older version
2010-08-23T05:10:00.000Z	ChogyDan	sihnu	how did compile and install it?
2010-08-23T05:12:00.000Z	ChogyDan	sihnu	then I think your only option is to try something like make uninstall.  But you have to read the directions in the package you downloaded
