2008-03-26T02:39:00.000Z	Jaffarkelshac		so nautilus is to explorer, what about X or Xserver
2008-03-26T02:40:00.000Z	unop	Jaffarkelshac	but nautilus, X and Xserver are all *nix terms, it's hard to find logic with that question, if you know what i mean :)
2008-03-26T02:41:00.000Z	Jaffarkelshac	unop	am new to ubuntu just trying to understand. i asked someone what nautilus was and said it was like explorer
2008-03-26T02:41:00.000Z	unop	Jaffarkelshac	yes, it is like explorer in the way it browses directories, lists files, etc
