2010-03-11T23:10:00.000Z	mickaela		I've installed Windows 7 like I used to have, and I want to Dual Boot XUbuntu with it. I've got 25 gigs of free space set aside for it. I have a few different partitions.
2010-03-11T23:10:00.000Z	mickaela		I load up he live disc for Xbuntu, it burned right. I go to install and it claims my hard disc is empty.
