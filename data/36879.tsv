2010-03-29T02:17:00.000Z	Typos_King	cehr	   can't tell, some running process get busy now and then is all we can make, what that might be... dunno what's running, so
2010-03-29T02:18:00.000Z	cehr	Typos_King	it happens a lot while using firefox, although that's not the only case and sometimes I can go days without a freeze but other times it'll only be powered on for minutes
2010-03-29T02:21:00.000Z	Typos_King	cehr	   could be any daemon service, can't really tell, check your startup/boot apps :), I mean, I get my system busy but exactly when it  happens,I have a cpu monitor on the tray, so I can tell, and I check in 'top' and is just updatedb, which does routine files indexing for services like locate or man or others
2010-03-29T02:25:00.000Z	cehr	Typos_King	hmm alright, looks like I'll have to do some more investigating then.  thanks
