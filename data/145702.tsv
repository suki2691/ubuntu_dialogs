2007-04-22T12:49:00.000Z	ricmik		is it possible to just install KDE on Ubuntu, or should I reinstall with Kubuntu?
2007-04-22T12:49:00.000Z	Flannel	ricmik	yeah, get the package 'kubuntu-desktop'
2007-04-22T12:50:00.000Z	Flannel	ricmik	because some people prefer KDE
2007-04-22T12:52:00.000Z	ricmik	Flannel	do I have to add another repository or something? I couldn't find kde-desktop...
