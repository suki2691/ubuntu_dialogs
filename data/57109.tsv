2009-10-31T06:43:00.000Z	troy1		had to shut my comp off in middle of Jaunty > Karmic upgrade. Now all it says on reboot is "/etc/fstab cannot yet be mounted"... any help?

2009-10-31T06:45:00.000Z	troy1	MenZa	Thanks, it's what I figured, I might as well get started
2009-10-31T06:45:00.000Z	MenZa	troy1	heh, better luck this time :)
