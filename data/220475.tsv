2008-06-28T04:15:00.000Z	Magicdead	Flannel	the intrepid flash 10 solves a lot of problems with pa
2008-06-28T04:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Magicdead	He can use intrepid files if he's on intrepid.  You can't mix/match files like that.
2008-06-28T04:17:00.000Z	Magicdead	Flannel	hmm that's the info i found on the forums when i had problems with flash & pa. sure it's a workaround but in this case the flashplugin-nonfree + alsa 1.0.16 works great
