2009-05-23T16:52:00.000Z	AlexStacey		hi, i'm after a bit of help with an ubuntu/vista dual boot - i installed vista clean then shrink'd the disk and have just run through the ubuntu install (installing grub onto the same partition as ubuntu) - now I have an ubuntu desktop screen with an install icon on it and i'm not sure if it has been installed of if i'm running off the cd - any ideas?
