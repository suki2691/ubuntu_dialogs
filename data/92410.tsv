2008-05-02T05:51:00.000Z	USN1520	paulcros	if you install bum you can adjust services
2008-05-02T05:51:00.000Z	paulcros	USN1520	 bum?  sudo apt-get install bum?
2008-05-02T05:56:00.000Z	paulcros	USN1520	 I installed the bum you mentioned. But its not what I wanted. I want to configure applications instead of services.
