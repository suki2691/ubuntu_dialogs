2010-01-10T04:06:00.000Z	acicula	kinja-sheep	grep
2010-01-10T04:07:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	acicula	Could you give me an example? I only know grep to search the particular string on filenames, not inside the context of files.
2010-01-10T04:07:00.000Z	acicula	kinja-sheep	id have to look at man pages or google, so best do that yourself ;)
