2010-06-18T02:35:00.000Z	igoryonya_		hello, I've installed Ubuntu on a logic partition, because on the primary, I've had a Win Vista installed. Now, I've moved everything I needed from Vista to Ubuntu and deleted the Vista partition, but now I am stuck in logic partition. How do I move my Ubuntu from a logic to a primary partition and continue working on the primary partition. I am afraid that if I just move it, using gparted,...

2010-06-18T02:38:00.000Z	igoryonya_	xray7224	I need to make it primary, and right now, my partition starts on the logic partition from the middle of the harddrive, and I have empty space in before the logic partition about the half of the hd is empty space in the beginning. I want linux to take up an entire hdd.
