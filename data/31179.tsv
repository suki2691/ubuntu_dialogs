2010-05-27T05:36:00.000Z	progesterone		Question: is there any pre-installed font on Ubunutu that resembles Verdana font?
2010-05-27T05:38:00.000Z	DeoFavente	progesterone	i do not believe so, but verdana can be installed via the msttcorefonts package - to install type "sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts" without the quotes into a terminal

2010-05-27T05:41:00.000Z	progesterone	DeoFavente	Thanks for your question. Unfortunately I can't tell every client to install it. I've to put Tahoma-equivalent font in Ubuntu in CSS.
