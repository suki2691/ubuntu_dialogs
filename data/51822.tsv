2009-07-30T03:33:00.000Z	donnybrasco		I can't open the chess application that comes with 9.04 anymore (since I enabled the 3D view option) anyone know what the problem might be?  I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling

2009-07-30T03:34:00.000Z	donnybrasco	erUSUL	I installed them
2009-07-30T03:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	donnybrasco	ok
