2011-09-15T20:02:00.000Z	webroasters		hi guys.  I was given a ";" delimited csv file, and when I go to say changes to the template (in Open Office), for some reason, a bunch of junk characters gets inserted into the file (you can see it when I open it in gedit). When I opened the file  in Microsoft Office, it was re-affirmed that open office saved a bunch of junk characters instead of how I wanted it saved. Can someone help me out here?
