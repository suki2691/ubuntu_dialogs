2008-09-19T04:35:00.000Z	cliechti	xsystemx	replace W and H with numbers, such as 1024x768
2008-09-19T04:38:00.000Z	cliechti	xsystemx	because you start many vnc severs. use vncserver -kill :1 etc to stop them
2008-09-19T04:42:00.000Z	cliechti	xsystemx	there are howtos for setting up vns with xinit. connect with vnc and you have to loging, then the desktop is laoded
