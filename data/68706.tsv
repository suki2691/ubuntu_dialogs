2009-03-18T08:58:00.000Z	kinja-sheep		I have 1024 x 600 resolution (7" subnotebook).  Is it possible to have more resolutions?  (Not the monitor but the displaying?)

2009-03-18T08:59:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	segin	What is it that I'm looking for exactly?
2009-03-18T09:00:00.000Z	segin	kinja-sheep	I don't know. I access my PC from a DEC VT100 serial dumb terminal; I don't know much of resolutions or the like :)
