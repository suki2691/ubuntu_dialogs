2010-02-16T14:53:00.000Z	shawnboy		I'm looking for opinions.
2010-02-16T14:54:00.000Z	mneptok	shawnboy	i use Komodo. i like it a lot. a bit slow on first launch, but that's a small niggle.
2010-02-16T14:56:00.000Z	shawnboy	mneptok	I was thinking about trying bluefish (& still will try it) but then stumbled upon Komodo Edit. It looks decent.
