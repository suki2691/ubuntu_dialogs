2010-03-12T05:36:00.000Z	dougmencken	Typos_King	I prefer E16 (Enlightenment 16), if you're curious; jrib, I was in #debian, I sent 5 bug reports in the last week; but I have told many times that in Ubuntu is everything fine
2010-03-12T05:38:00.000Z	dougmencken	Typos_King	yeah, e16 works well with KDE or Gnome, the only thing is to kill nautilus coz it can show only one desktop wallpaper for all workspaces
