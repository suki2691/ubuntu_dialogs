2010-02-20T17:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	EgYPaRaDoX	normalley you just sudo  when you want root for command line apps, or  gksudo for graphical, and don't need to use anything else
2010-02-20T17:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	EgYPaRaDoX	and there's a way to get a root shell all the time, but you woudn't normalley have a reason to do that
