2008-08-17T00:01:00.000Z	turdburglar		hello all... i'm extremely new to linux (have tried a few times in the past, last try was about 3 years ago) and i'm trying to install a nvidia driver. i have a shellscript, but when i try to run it it just does nothing.. and when i try to use 'sh nvidia-linux-x86-173.14.12-pkg1.run' it tells me 'Can't open ï»¿nvidia-linux-x86-173.14.12-pkg1.run' and spits me back out to the 'command prompt' or whatever you would call it
