2009-02-15T18:25:00.000Z	sammyF		hey there. how can I recursively change the owner of hidden files? chown doesn't have a -a or whatever option :/
2009-02-15T18:26:00.000Z	mastt	sammyF	maybe ls -a | chown will work
2009-02-15T18:29:00.000Z	mastt	sammyF	can you chown one of the files manually?
2009-02-15T18:30:00.000Z	sammyF	mastt	yep. just tried, it it worked
