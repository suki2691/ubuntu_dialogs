2011-09-02T00:09:00.000Z	kid	kyle__	i'm unsure if i have the same ip. in fact, i don't know how to check it. we moved locations and now our local computers cannot connect to the project server which contains all our project files.
2011-09-02T00:10:00.000Z	kyle__	kid	So you don't even know if the server is up now?
