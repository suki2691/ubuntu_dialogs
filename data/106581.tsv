2009-11-01T07:41:00.000Z	Spoom		hi folks, after upgrade i'm not seeing application icons in the upper-left of every application; instead i see a generic grey circle, instead of the x-chat icon for the x-chat window, firefox icon for firefox, etc.; googling hasn't revealed anything specific so far and i just skimmed the release notes and didn't see it, any ideas?
2009-11-01T07:41:00.000Z	Spoom		if anyone can link me to a bug report or give me a good search query for this issue i'd appreciate that too; like i said, i've searched around a fair bit already and haven't found anything
2009-11-01T07:41:00.000Z	Spoom		i'm thinking it's some sort of corrupt icon cache or something, but i have no idea where to go with this issue
