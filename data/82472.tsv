2010-02-22T02:07:00.000Z	gigawatt		if i am logged into a server what is the best way to copy files from that server to my local machine
2010-02-22T02:07:00.000Z	guntbert	gigawatt	use scp
2010-02-22T02:09:00.000Z	guntbert	gigawatt	that depends - but in any case you can use it from your local station and access the remote host
