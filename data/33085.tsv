2010-05-02T06:56:00.000Z	justin2		Hello all.  If anybody is available to help me please let me know.  Right now I am running Ubuntu 8.10 and when I upgrade to try to get to 10.04 it all goes down hill.
2010-05-02T06:56:00.000Z	justin2		I'm willing to do whatever I need to do for this machine to be able to run 10.04
2010-05-02T06:57:00.000Z	justin2		Well, I can't get the live CD to run.
