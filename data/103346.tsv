2011-06-01T06:46:00.000Z	Scunizi_	viviane	from where to where?
2011-06-01T06:47:00.000Z	Scunizi_	viviane	you could open the file manager and then hit F3 for a split screen.. manover to the directories you want in both sides and drag and drop the file
2011-06-01T06:47:00.000Z	Scunizi_	viviane	but most usb keys are fat32 or 16 and they don't like files that size.. you might have to reformat it to ext3
