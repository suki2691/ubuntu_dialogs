2007-09-08T07:08:00.000Z	MrObvious	Excalibas	Yes. Or you could even resize the hard drive and install Ubuntu, Knoppix, and XP.
2007-09-08T07:10:00.000Z	Excalibas	MrObvious	can i use the same swap or i have to mate 2 more partitions for that?
2007-09-08T07:10:00.000Z	MrObvious	Excalibas	You can use the same. You might even be able to keep the same /home but I could be wrong. Probably to be safe you shouldn't.
