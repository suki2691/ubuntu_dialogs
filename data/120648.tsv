2007-12-01T06:41:00.000Z	stodge		Just installed Gutsy - I thought this version was supposed to have complete/easier support for configuring xorg? I'm still stuck at a refresh rate of 50Hz.

2007-12-01T06:44:00.000Z	danbhfive	stodge	the nvidia driver scrambles the refresh rate information, so if you are using the driver, the wrong refreshes will get reported
2007-12-01T06:44:00.000Z	danbhfive	stodge	i have the same problem
