2010-02-07T03:30:00.000Z	chelz	excalibas	look into the persistent live USB
2010-02-07T03:40:00.000Z	excalibas	chelz	I can't find information on those sites about upgrading, I have created a live usb with perssistence using  the USB Startup Disk Creator and then booted and did apt-get update, apt-get upgrade, and it seems to be working, but it makes some questions (I think when updating grub) and I don't know what to do
2010-02-07T03:42:00.000Z	chelz	excalibas	what are the questions?
