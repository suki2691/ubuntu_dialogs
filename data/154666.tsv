2006-12-12T10:49:00.000Z	wjbaird		I upgraded from 6.06 to 6.10 on the weekend, and I'm getting weird xinerama behavior with metacity --- it won't let me drag windows completely off my primary display...  I've switched to xfwm4 temporarily, but I'd rather figure out how to fix metacity.   It was working fine in 6.06...
2006-12-12T10:50:00.000Z	ThePub	wjbaird	xserver driver?  any other apparent issues?  do you see the window appear on the other screen?
2006-12-12T10:51:00.000Z	wjbaird	ThePub	I don't think it's an X issue - using xfwm4 everything seems fine...
2006-12-12T10:52:00.000Z	ThePub	wjbaird	ok, great.  hope you can fix it.
