2009-02-05T23:00:00.000Z	dude7064		I have a folder in my system, when trying to execute the ls command on it, the console just hangs and doesn't display anything,,
2009-02-05T23:00:00.000Z	dude7064		what could be the reason for this ?
2009-02-05T23:01:00.000Z	dude7064		also, when trying to view its contents, it just hangs,,
