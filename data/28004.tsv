2010-07-31T22:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	danieldd	 #java perhaps?
2010-07-31T22:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	danieldd	 MOST likely its a 'regiestered nick only' channel.
2010-07-31T22:59:00.000Z	danieldd	Dr_Willis	Oh, Thank you, I'll try to register and check it again, I am a bit new at all this IRC stuff. Thank you.
