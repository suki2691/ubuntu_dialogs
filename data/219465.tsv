2008-10-01T12:18:00.000Z	Atax		Hi all, im trying to install Nvidia-Drivers and have to exit x-windows first. How do I exist x-windows in Ubuntu?
2008-10-01T12:20:00.000Z	Atax		Under Debian or Suse I would change to console ctrl+alt+f1, and then type "init 1". This doesent work with ubuntu, ... I cant get a console after i typed int 1!
