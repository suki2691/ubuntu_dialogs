2007-12-23T16:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Cin	firefox will use your system's default sound device
2007-12-23T16:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Cin	you can change it, but i don't know about "on the fly".
2007-12-23T16:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Cin	i'm sure there is a way, but i'm not sure, other than changing the device in your sound settings, why do you want to do this?
