2008-10-01T10:36:00.000Z	Romanian		When I type "\wine start utorrent.exe from a remote location on my file server, a bunch of errors pop up saying that the X-Window manager could not be used or something, and then when I run top on the same SSH connection, it gives me utorrent.exe and about 5 or 6 utorrent.exe<defunct> processes. Any ideas why this may be?
