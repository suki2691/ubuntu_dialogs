2006-09-13T10:58:00.000Z	total_meltdown	RideSn	I dunno, I used to use Visual Studio, I could probably come close. What was it?
2006-09-13T11:01:00.000Z	total_meltdown	RideSn	apt-cache search java | grep 1.4
2006-09-13T11:06:00.000Z	total_meltdown	RideSn	I don't know what the 1.5 packages are... Perhaps just install 1.4 without removing?
