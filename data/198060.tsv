2009-01-11T21:29:00.000Z	annaimkonki		any suggestion for a linux distro for an old machine... 256 ram 2ghz proc 20 gb hd... i installed linux-mint xface 8.04 runs well but youtube videos are kind of slow.. it was running puppy from ram and it ran fine but videos cannot be full screen
2009-01-11T21:31:00.000Z	annaimkonki		ok thanks.. i installed xubuntu w/linux mint.. it doesn't run really good... do you think if i go for older version of xubuntu it will be better?
2009-01-11T21:32:00.000Z	annaimkonki		is it recomended to use xubuntu 6.04 if it is no longer supported? will i be able to get updates?
