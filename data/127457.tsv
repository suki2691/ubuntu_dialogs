2012-02-06T15:50:00.000Z	mikubuntu		my hp deskjet printer sounds like its printing, but nothing comes out ... there IS one message that flashes momentarily that says tri color cartridge is low, but i'm trying to print black only
2012-02-06T15:51:00.000Z	mikubuntu		the paper feeds in, and the heads are going back and forth, but the paper comes out blank
2012-02-06T15:53:00.000Z	Tm_T	mikubuntu	so it's printing invisible ink, check your ink levels and that the print heads are clean
2012-02-06T16:02:00.000Z	mikubuntu	Tm_T	 how do you know if the print heads are clean?
