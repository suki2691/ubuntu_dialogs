2010-05-04T12:31:00.000Z	EmilioTucci		I have just upgraded my Ubuntu 8.10 to Karmik, and mysql server does not work, during the installation it says that the package mysql-server-5.1 had dependencies problems and could not be configured Â¿? Any clue? The server was working pretty goog in my old 8.10. Thanks

2010-05-04T12:34:00.000Z	EmilioTucci	ZykoticK9	so it's late for me? I had to remove the mysql-server and mysql-client before perfomring the upgrade?
2010-05-04T12:35:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	EmilioTucci	i'm not really familiar with the issue - i just remember reading about it in the release notes, and thus sent them to you.  Good luck.
