2009-05-19T17:39:00.000Z	jake		my samsung q45 did not work with linux until jaunty. now it works (actually boots!) and i cannot get the intel gm945 graphics working :S i thought intel graphics worked out of the box
2009-05-19T17:39:00.000Z	Slart	jake	jaunty had some problems with intel graphics
2009-05-19T17:40:00.000Z	jake	Slart	are there any known fixes or do i just have to wait?
2009-05-19T17:41:00.000Z	Slart	jake	I'm not sure.. I haven't read up on it any more, I don't have any computers with intel graphics.. it might already be fixed for all I know
