2008-09-28T17:49:00.000Z	DawnLight		hey. how can i change the default system language? I have only english values in /etc/environment. dpkg-reconfigure locales doesn't give ask me any questions, unlike in debian, which i am used to. so how does this work here?

2008-09-28T17:50:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	DawnLight	You can enable complex character entry and select languages from the login screen as well after the various language support is installed
2008-09-28T17:51:00.000Z	DawnLight	ushimitsudoki	i'd like to use the system's tools and not the GUI for this. I'd like to actually know what it is doing
