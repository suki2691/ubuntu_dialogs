2008-09-07T23:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	mykhi	ther's several good ones, utorrent works great via wine, transmission, ktorrent, etc
2008-09-07T23:50:00.000Z	mykhi	IndyGunFreak	thans mate, i actually tried utorrent under wine but its not way to go for me (emulation) and after few houres it starts to use lots of memory. i tried ktorrent aswell but its just not as good as ?torrent and its kde based (im gnome user) havent seen transmission tho, will take a look
