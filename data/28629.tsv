2010-07-23T16:35:00.000Z	herazio		I'll just be blunt. It's not really a question that needs to be solved at the moment. I just solved it by reinstalling my whole Ubuntu after Docky for some kind of reason messed up. But that led me to wonder. Suppose a program does not want to start (it's a GUI app) and it does not show any errors at all. What is the best course of action to take ?
