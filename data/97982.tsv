2009-08-07T14:50:00.000Z	cached1		this isn't strictly ubuntu, but can anyone tell me what the ip addresses of opendns' dns servers are? I think my ISP's servers are down
2009-08-07T14:51:00.000Z	fahadsadah	cached1	208.67.222.222, and 208.67.220.220
2009-08-07T14:51:00.000Z	fahadsadah	cached1	Though I'd recommend Verizon DNS instead - 4.2.2.1-5
2009-08-07T14:55:00.000Z	cached1	fahadsadah	hmm. that didnt seem to work. any idea why i'd be able to communicate with irc and google but not anything by name (eg. slashdot.org)? this is the case for all computers connected to my router
