2011-12-13T17:20:00.000Z	dw1		Is there a way to ask the installation to keep the previous version of the kernel as a boot option when you install new kernel package?
2011-12-13T17:20:00.000Z	ikonia	dw1	it should keep current -1
2011-12-13T17:20:00.000Z	ikonia	dw1	it will only remove versions older than -1
2011-12-13T17:21:00.000Z	dw1	ikonia	Mine does not seem to offer the last one as a boot option - so I need to edit my grub configuration somehow?
