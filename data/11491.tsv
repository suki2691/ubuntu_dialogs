2011-08-08T22:46:00.000Z	stealz	zykotick9	 I was just thinking it should be possible to just make the window background transparent, didnt want to install a different login manager for that
2011-08-08T22:47:00.000Z	zykotick9	stealz	unfortunately GDM isn't very configurable these days, best of luck.  I certainly have no suggestions.
2011-08-08T22:48:00.000Z	stealz	zykotick9	thanks. The Idea I had was to launch ccsm from the login screen, but that didnt work either. Gonna keep trying =)
