2005-07-02T11:36:00.000Z	lilricky		got a question, this is my first time with Ubuntu, I've been weaned on Debian and Mandrake, when I installed Hoary, it didnt ask for a root password, I've tried ubuntu, root, null cant seem to find out what it is.  What is the default root password?
2005-07-02T11:37:00.000Z	lilricky		ok, but when I run a program from the gui that requires root privileges it asks for it
2005-07-02T11:38:00.000Z	lilricky		duh, thanks, forgot about that :)
