2008-02-01T00:24:00.000Z	new2linux		is it safe to have kde and xfce and if so is there a way to switch between the 2 ?
2008-02-01T00:25:00.000Z	new2linux		right now i use xubuntu, i wanna try kubuntu
2008-02-01T00:25:00.000Z	MasterShrek	new2linux	totally save to have both, choose a different session from your kdm before you log in to switch between the two
