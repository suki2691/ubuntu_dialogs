2007-01-30T06:25:00.000Z	cablesm102		Can anyone explain the advantages of apt-get over aptitude? it seems like every guide I read specifies apt-get, even though Aptitude has more powerful dependency handling.
2007-01-30T06:26:00.000Z	thisheregiraffe	cablesm102	i've always stuck with aptitude, because of the dependency handling..
2007-01-30T06:26:00.000Z	cablesm102	thisheregiraffe	same here... juts wondering why most guides specify apt-get.
2007-01-30T06:27:00.000Z	thisheregiraffe	cablesm102	it's a slightly shorter command to type?  who knows--i've never noticed a huge difference
