2011-12-04T00:52:00.000Z	NetRunnerBlack		Hey guys, I'm having trouble with the open with feature. I'm using a program called Vault of Darkness, which creates .VML files. Ubuntu defaults to opening them with FireFox, and the Vault of Darkness program isn't showing up in the list of 'Open With' options. I tried clicking properties and going down the list, looking for Vault of Darkness to 'Add' it to the list but it wasn't there.
2011-12-04T00:54:00.000Z	NetRunnerBlack		Anyone have any ideas?
2011-12-04T00:56:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	NetRunnerBlack	 try opening Firefox and there go to File > Open > your_file
2011-12-04T00:58:00.000Z	NetRunnerBlack	MonkeyDust	I only have the 'Open File' option under File, but the issue is that I don't want FireFox to open it. I want Vault of Darkness to open it.
