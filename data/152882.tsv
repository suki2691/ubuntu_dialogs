2008-07-02T05:34:00.000Z	Plazma		is there a url out there that describes the differences between ubuntu desktop and ubuntu server ?
2008-07-02T05:34:00.000Z	Yasumoto	Plazma	essentially, you don't have the graphical interface- no mouse/gnome/kde
2008-07-02T05:34:00.000Z	Plazma	sloopy	 their all just tools, but i myself prefer vi for the fact its everywhere
2008-07-02T05:35:00.000Z	Yasumoto	Plazma	you also have the options to install an ssh server, a web server, a dns server, mail server, and maybe others (proxy server?) straight from the install
