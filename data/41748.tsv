2009-11-27T22:57:00.000Z	Rhetorical	omkar	 It's probable something very simple, I just don't have any idea to start going about it.
2009-11-27T23:13:00.000Z	Rhetorical	omkar	 I have already installed Ubuntu, so knowing what I should have done isn't much help.  I would prefer to know what I can do now
2009-11-27T23:16:00.000Z	Rhetorical	omkar	 I want to use the Windows bootloader, not GRUB.  How can I change it so it uses the Windows bootloader?
