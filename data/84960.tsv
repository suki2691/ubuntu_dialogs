2009-07-31T02:26:00.000Z	RoboJoint		anyone know of an app (thats not compiz related) that allows windows to snap together on the edges & stay stuck kinda like how winamp does it for windows?
2009-07-31T02:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RoboJoint	 theres window managers that have   'snaping' features.
2009-07-31T02:28:00.000Z	RoboJoint	Dr_Willis	is there a feature in nautilus or metacity that i'm missing?
2009-07-31T02:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RoboJoint	 not sure.  im using compiz at the moment. so the windows sort have a edge reistance that works fine for me.
