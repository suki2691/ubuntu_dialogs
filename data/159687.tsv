2007-02-26T12:29:00.000Z	snowpunk98		Im really trying to decide if I should fully switch to Ubuntu
2007-02-26T12:29:00.000Z	snowpunk98		Or if I should keep dual booting with Windows
2007-02-26T12:30:00.000Z	h1st0	snowpunk98	just dual boot and then you don't have to worry bout it.  Although I haven't been in windows in months.
