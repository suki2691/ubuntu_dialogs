2008-02-29T14:25:00.000Z	Squawk	gold44	personaly when I run an ftp server I create a new user "ftp", give him a home directory, and then give anyone who wants ftp access to that user account. YOu will have to figure out the tftpd config file yourself though
2008-02-29T14:27:00.000Z	gold44	Squawk	that's no different from ssh with sftp, if you set it up that way is there? maybe i not understand u correctly
2008-02-29T14:27:00.000Z	Squawk	gold44	he said tftpd
