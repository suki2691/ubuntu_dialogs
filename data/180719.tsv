2009-10-19T23:33:00.000Z	SnakDoc		I was considering the Karmic upgrade a little early are there any major bugs in the release ?
2009-10-19T23:34:00.000Z	SnakDoc		kaius :( any certian thing it hangs up on ?
2009-10-19T23:35:00.000Z	Kaius	SnakDoc	Nothing in particular. It's just that the process takes twice as long in Karmic as in Jaunty.
2009-10-19T23:36:00.000Z	Kaius	SnakDoc	I'm going to dl it again on the 29th and see if that problem's been corrected.
