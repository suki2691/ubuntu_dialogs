2007-07-31T07:51:00.000Z	matt_mueller		Ok I hate to show up here and ask for help.....but I am at my wits end with my intel integrated wireless (ipw3945)...and yes I know it is supposed to be supported out of the box...but its not, and none of the forum topics have gotten me anywhere...can anyone help?
2007-07-31T07:52:00.000Z	matt_mueller		heh yeh, seen the troubleshooting docs
