2006-07-03T15:04:00.000Z	RememberPOL		Hey, would anyone happen to know if it's possible to use the NVIDIA released xorg video driver ("nvidia") instead of the somewhat inferior reverse-engineered free driver ("nv") on Ubuntu "Dapper Drake" v6.06 LTS?  (And also how to add support for "1280x768" screen resolution [I tried adding the entry to xorg.conf and restarting X, with still only the original three available in Screen Resolution Preferences] ?)
