2011-09-30T02:42:00.000Z	lockyy		Hey, I just installed ubuntu for the first time, 11.04. I was just wondering if this was an appropriate place to ask questions regarding a few things.
2011-09-30T02:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lockyy	yes, ask away
2011-09-30T02:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lockyy	there may be a command you can have run at login
2011-09-30T02:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lockyy	there may be a command line to run for compiz, you could ask in #compiz too
