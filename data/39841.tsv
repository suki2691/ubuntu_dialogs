2010-01-02T06:00:00.000Z	Shinydan_		I'm wanting to reformat a USB hard drive to ext3 to allow proper read/write access for everyone on my house network. Is that sensible?
2010-01-02T06:00:00.000Z	Shinydan_		sorry to have to ask again.
2010-01-02T06:01:00.000Z	gr4p3s	Shinydan_	why do you have to format it to ext3?
2010-01-02T06:02:00.000Z	gr4p3s	Shinydan_	really? do you have that ntfs-3g or whatever it is working properly? ntfs plays nicely with my linux
