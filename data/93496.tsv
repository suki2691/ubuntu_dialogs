2008-04-28T18:02:00.000Z	gkhnoisgtht		or better yet raid 10
2008-04-28T18:04:00.000Z	case_	gkhnoisgtht	what kind of raid? hardware or software? for software: yup, for hardware, depend of the hardware (my 3ware SATA RAID1 card works like a charm)
2008-04-28T18:04:00.000Z	gkhnoisgtht	case_	really i'm just looking at software raid
