2007-07-18T09:31:00.000Z	gundam_rx78nt1		hello. I am trying out linux due to a university course and want to set up a linux network. How can I get the individual workstations to do centralized authentication? Any pointers?

2007-07-18T09:34:00.000Z	gundam_rx78nt1	IntuitiveNipple	is that all there is? Using Samba will permit to use wins and linux together on a network, what about 'pure linux' options?
