2006-08-04T08:05:00.000Z	Phrozen_One		okay better yet, has anybody succesfully migrated a casual Windows user to Ubuntu
2006-08-04T08:05:00.000Z	Phrozen_One		well what about with the support of the latest Wine?
2006-08-04T08:05:00.000Z	longwave	Phrozen_One	yep, my girlfriend was a casual windows user, now she happily uses ubuntu with openoffice and so on instead
