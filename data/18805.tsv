2012-03-03T17:06:00.000Z	Mech0z_		apparently my raid5 has a failed disk (Dont think the disk is dead, just a reboot error) how do I add a disk to the raid so its not bad anymore?
2012-03-03T17:07:00.000Z	Mech0z_		how do I list what disks a raid5 contains
2012-03-03T17:07:00.000Z	Mech0z_		then I might be able to fix it
