2012-02-09T22:39:00.000Z	bigpresh	JokesOnYou77	ifconfig should show you the bytes transferred and received; the counters can roll over though, I believe
2012-02-09T22:44:00.000Z	bigpresh	JokesOnYou77	vnstat may also be worth a look; it doesn't meet your requirement of just showing usage since boot, though
