2006-08-05T16:40:00.000Z	gatekeeper	Lynoure	mainly bug fixes i think
2006-08-05T16:42:00.000Z	Lynoure	gatekeeper	thanks, then I'll think I'll happily keep to this older one until I run into something intolerable
2006-08-05T16:43:00.000Z	gatekeeper	Lynoure	that's what I am doing, unless there is an issue I can't see a reason to move
