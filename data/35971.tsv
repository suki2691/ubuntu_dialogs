2010-03-13T00:07:00.000Z	arcaos		I have a 4.4Gb ISO and a 4.7Gb DVD (which I understand is 4.4Gb really) but it still says not enough space in Brasero and don't know how to work around it
2010-03-13T00:07:00.000Z	arcaos		it has happened many times
2010-03-13T00:08:00.000Z	sometux	arcaos	make sure the DVD is empty
