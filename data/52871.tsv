2009-07-15T07:14:00.000Z	nztal-	jwfoxjr	i recommend wicd for laptops.  if your accessing different AP's its easier on dns changes, at least at starbucks, it doesn't interfere with the different setups like network-manager-gnome does.  if you lose connectivity defining your /etc/network/interfaces file, you might want to make sure you have a wicd deb handy, just to get you back online
2009-07-15T07:16:00.000Z	nztal-	jwfoxjr	i believe under ordinary circumstances and some good examples its not too difficult to lose connectivty, at least on all interfaces, but i've had some trouble using a local dns cache which wont allow me to access the internet, but will allow me to access the lan, but it helps to have something as backup, in case of the unforseeable
