2007-02-10T12:16:00.000Z	Pelo	AMAG	 that wasn'T my point,  but my computer does boot pretty fast in ubu
2007-04-25T11:40:00.000Z	Pelo	AMAG	 doh't install 64 bit version unless you have an real need for it,   32 bit has more support for stuff like flash and such
2007-04-25T11:41:00.000Z	AMAG	Pelo	it turns out I don't care about flash (I read the forums) because I have a windows box for that
