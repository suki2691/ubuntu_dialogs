2007-06-10T13:23:00.000Z	Polygon89	RoAkSoAx	no, dont even get me started on that, lol. Bad wireless drivers. ANYWAY, what im wanting to do is get a wireless bridge setup. This is essentially a little box that when i plug in a ethernet cable to (the other end goes into the network adapter of my computer) then its supposed to act like a wiress card, taking the ethernet connection and transmitting it wirelessly
2007-06-10T13:23:00.000Z	Polygon89	RoAkSoAx	problem is i cannot figure out how to set it up.
