2012-08-03T23:30:00.000Z	Mathuin		I'm using precise pangolin and a couple of applications which try to use the entire screen (0 AD in particular) fail because the top panel won't go away.  How can I fix this?

2012-08-03T23:32:00.000Z	zykotick9	Mathuin	try the same program in unity2 (or something else that doesn't use compiz)
2012-08-03T23:33:00.000Z	Mathuin	zykotick9	how do I do that?
