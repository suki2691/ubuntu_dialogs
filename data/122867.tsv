2008-08-05T08:59:00.000Z	Jasnation		general question: about a week or two ago, I downloaded the ubuntu live cd iso and burned several disks, none of which worked. I did the md5 checks and such, but still nothing worked and there was no reason for it (the linux kernel was failing to load). The cd I requested from shipit just got here, and it works perfectly. Has anyone else had similar problems?
2008-08-05T08:59:00.000Z	wols	Jasnation	define "doesn't work" for the md5sum stuff you did
2008-08-05T08:59:00.000Z	Jasnation	wols	I did md5 checks and they said the download was fine
2008-08-05T09:01:00.000Z	Jasnation	wols	from the ubuntu startup thing when the disk loaded, I tried to verify the disk or whatever but the linux kernel failed to load (the loading bar just gets stuck)
