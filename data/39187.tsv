2010-05-24T12:46:00.000Z	maelaian		Can anyone assist me with a install problem on a fresh install of 10.04? After reboot I enter my user information, and after I hit enter, I see my background and the cursor, but thats it. Mouse is responsive but the key commans to switch to a tty dont seem to work an keyboard isn't lighting up.

2010-05-24T12:47:00.000Z	maelaian	sunson	Yes. Used the alternate CD but its a default install otherwise.
