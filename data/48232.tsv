2011-01-17T22:22:00.000Z	rapha		I just bought a new computer, and it has a SATA DVD burner, but it doesn't work under Ubuntu (can't even see it in Nautilus) - how to make it work?

2011-01-17T22:23:00.000Z	rapha	OerHeks	no it doesn't. The DVD drive doesn't appear at all; nowhere - and dmesg has this about it: http://pastie.org/private/8ypwjvdsp9pke3dexzdw
