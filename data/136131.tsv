2009-05-05T16:06:00.000Z	Prabz		Hi, ever since I upgraded to jaunty, I've been facing a problem with playing videos in vlc. The video no longer runs within the main window, rather, it runs in a separate window called "XVideo output"
2009-05-05T16:06:00.000Z	Prabz		How to correct it?
2009-05-05T16:08:00.000Z	Gnea	Prabz	just change the video output plugin in the preferences
2009-05-05T16:08:00.000Z	Gnea	Prabz	make it like opengl or x11
