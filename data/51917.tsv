2009-08-08T01:32:00.000Z	Slart	Taft	a dvdr? break it into small pieces.. grind it up... melt it..
2009-08-08T01:33:00.000Z	Taft	Slart	it's a dvdrw actually, and could i have a real answer perhaps <_<
2009-08-08T01:34:00.000Z	Slart	Taft	oh.. a dvdrw.. that seriously changes the question...not sure how to do that..never really messed with rw-discs in ubuntu
