2009-08-09T08:50:00.000Z	geezer		I have a question. Currently have Jaunty (32bit) running on a 2.0GHz Core2Duo laptop with 3GB RAM and an Intel 4500 graphics chipset. My compiz effects are pretty minimal (no desktop cube or water effects). Will installing the Avant Window Navigator dock degrade my performance?

2009-08-09T08:51:00.000Z	bazhang	geezer	why not try it out; though there are other dock options you may prefer
