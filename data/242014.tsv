2007-08-12T11:08:00.000Z	aerotim13		i don't really know what to do because i just started using linux and ubuntu yesterday
2007-08-12T11:09:00.000Z	astro76	aerotim13	close synaptic, in a terminal, type: sudo dpkg --configure -a
2007-08-12T11:09:00.000Z	astro76	aerotim13	you typed what I said with sudo? It shoudl ask for your user password
