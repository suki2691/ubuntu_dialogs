2008-03-16T07:32:00.000Z	Devyll		how can I install mod_rewrite for apache2 ? I can't finde it with aptitude search
2008-03-16T07:33:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Devyll	I think it may be included by default with the apache2 package
2008-03-16T07:34:00.000Z	Devyll	Starnestommy	and what is the name of the module ? I don't have mod_rewrite or something similar in avalable modules directory
2008-03-16T07:34:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Devyll	it's just rewrite.  The .load file is /etc/apache2/mods-available/rewrite.load
