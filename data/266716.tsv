2009-07-02T06:19:00.000Z	Godel-Paradox		how can i create
2009-07-02T06:19:00.000Z	Godel-Paradox		an iso from cd?
2009-07-02T06:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Godel-Paradox	 you can 'image' a cd to a .iso file with the proper dd command
2009-07-02T06:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Godel-Paradox	 theres other tools that can do it.. but dd will be just as easy/fast
