2008-06-30T10:30:00.000Z	Jester45	klenz87	sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-06-30T10:31:00.000Z	Jester45	klenz87	you can add the the 3 other drives into a software raid for extra speed (if they are the same speed and storage)
2008-06-30T10:32:00.000Z	Jester45	klenz87	then all 3 will act as 1 larger drive if they arent the same speed or size put them into a LVM, and that will act the same way
