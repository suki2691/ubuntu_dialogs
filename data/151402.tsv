2010-01-14T06:06:00.000Z	mlissner		Does anybody have any advice on how to share a server amongst a couple people so as to work on a group project making a website? I'd like to do it without giving them TOO much access to the config files, but I can't think of how to do it without giving them root.

2010-01-14T06:07:00.000Z	mlissner	Dr_Willis	is there a good way to do this by adding them a certain group or something?
