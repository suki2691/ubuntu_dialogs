2010-04-21T01:13:00.000Z	manohar		i have ubuntu 8.04LTS running. i want to install 10.04LTS after its release. My PC confuguration is 845 motherboard, 32bit Intel P4 2.4GHz, 512 RAM, no external graphics card(in-built present). Can i install 10.04. I had problem installing 8.10 before. So installed 8.04 back.

2010-04-21T01:16:00.000Z	boabsta	manohar	i've tried running a desktop with 512MB (think it was 8.10) and it ran like a complete dog
2010-04-21T01:19:00.000Z	manohar	boabsta	but i had problem as mentioned above wid 8.10 but after installing 8.04 back it is running like a tiger.
