2008-07-19T02:02:00.000Z	Slart	newbie_guy	reiserfs uses some kind of weird data structure for storing files.. it's supposed to be faster if you've got many small files
2008-07-19T02:02:00.000Z	Slart	newbie_guy	but it takes a bit longer to mount when you boot up
2008-07-19T02:05:00.000Z	Slart	newbie_guy	the wikipedia has some good info on reiserfs http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReiserFS
