2006-11-11T07:10:00.000Z	YogSothoth		I just updated my Ubuntu Edgy and now it says that these packages have been kept back: libggi2 mplayer
2006-11-11T07:11:00.000Z	YogSothoth		I tried a dist-upgrade, no luck either. How can I upgrade these packages? Why are they not upgraded?
2006-11-11T07:11:00.000Z	Limulf	YogSothoth	I just searched those packages in synaptic and upgraded them
2006-11-11T07:19:00.000Z	YogSothoth	Limulf	that did the trick, thanks!
