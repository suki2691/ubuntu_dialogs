2007-08-28T15:45:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg		Anybody know how I can install deluge on my Ubuntu? I tried to download and install it and it said it could not resolve a dependency with lib6
2007-08-28T15:45:00.000Z	steveatlocalhost	loquitus_of_borg	is it designed for debian or ubuntu?
2007-08-28T15:45:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg	steveatlocalhost	no idea
