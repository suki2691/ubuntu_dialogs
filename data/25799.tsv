2010-09-19T18:44:00.000Z	mestar		Hey Ubuntu. I have  a problem and I am wondering if there is any way I can fix it. Basically for whatever reason my memory stick has turned Read Only. I cant delete any files from it no matter what I do, I even tried formatting it from gparted (No important data on there at the moment). Anyone got any suggestions how I can format this USB stick?
