2011-03-21T22:40:00.000Z	lvh	cavefish	Okay. So how do my Ubuntu boxes advertise their hostname to a DNS server?
2011-03-21T22:43:00.000Z	cavefish	lvh	the DNS-protocol on the client send a signal called a lookup
2011-03-21T22:44:00.000Z	lvh	cavefish	You're explaining how DNS works. I know how DNS works. My question is how my DNS server, or my Ubuntu boxes, know that "lagavulin.local" and "bruichladdich.local" are resolvable names, and if so, how they are advertised.
