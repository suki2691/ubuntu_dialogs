2007-03-08T09:24:00.000Z	nfearnley		Anyone know how to update apt sources from 6.06 to 6.10?
2007-03-08T09:26:00.000Z	nfearnley		okay, the apt sources say they have edgy, but I can't find headers for kernel 2.6.17
2007-03-08T09:28:00.000Z	nfearnley		I've searched but apt just seems to list 2.4 headers.
