2008-09-29T06:44:00.000Z	amdpox	carandraug	is it for mpd exclusively?
2008-09-29T06:46:00.000Z	carandraug	amdpox	hmmm, now that you mention that, I never seen anywhere saying that it's exclusive for mpd, only that it's a front-end for mpd. But SMplayer also doesn't say that it's exclusively a front-end for mplayer and has mplayer has dependencie
