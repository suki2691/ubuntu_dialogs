2005-07-12T05:04:00.000Z	Matt_Arnold		hello, I'm a new Linux user.
2005-07-12T05:05:00.000Z	Matt_Arnold		I've been trying to install Linux for more than a year and Ubuntu is the first one that worked.
2005-07-12T05:06:00.000Z	Matt_Arnold		I had problems but I have lots of tech friends who helped me. So anyway, I'm just chatting here to say thank you to the Ubuntu community. Thank you!
