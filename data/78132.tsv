2009-02-04T18:01:00.000Z	jxander		is there a way to find out the names of the files that were deleted from a certain location a few minutes ago? i don't need to recover them, i just need to know what was deleted... is there a history of events like this?
2009-02-04T18:01:00.000Z	jrib	jxander	how did you delete them?
2009-02-04T18:02:00.000Z	jxander	jrib	uTorrent running through wine did...
2009-02-04T18:03:00.000Z	jrib	jxander	then only if utorrent keeps track of that
