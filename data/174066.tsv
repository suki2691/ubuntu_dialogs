2006-08-05T06:16:00.000Z	Konstable		I have hardly anythign running (Opera browser where I'm typing this now, aMsn, SciTE text editor, and a Konsole window).  But when I go to "free" it tells me I only have 60MB of free RAM (out of 512MB)   on Windows I generally have around 250 to 300MB  free with the same usage!!!  A friend on Debian running about the same tells me he has about 250MB right now.  Is there something wrong with my Ubuntu or is a general thing?
