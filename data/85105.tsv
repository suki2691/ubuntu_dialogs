2010-10-06T08:13:00.000Z	sam555		Has anyone tried to configure rsyslog and logrotate together and been successful?
2010-10-06T08:13:00.000Z	prince_jammys	sam555	tell us about the specific problem you ran into, and someone might help
2010-10-06T08:15:00.000Z	sam555	prince_jammys	we're not sure, but the symptom is that we ended up with many log files with 0 bytes long that are named mail.log  but then they get written to mail.log.1
