2009-05-22T02:59:00.000Z	phaze74		Hi. I have 70 perl modules I've built into deb packages for Gutsy using dh-make-perl. I've just deployed new Jaunty servers. Looks like I have to recreate all 70 for Jaunty. :( They're CPAN libs that are not in the distros. I guess I don't really have a question because the reality is that I have to do the work. :(
2009-05-22T03:00:00.000Z	phaze74		Anyone know a fast way to build 70 perl libs into .debs other than dh-make-perl?
2009-05-22T03:00:00.000Z	jrib	phaze74	why don't you contribute them to the official repositories?
2009-05-22T03:00:00.000Z	phaze74	jrib	I should.
