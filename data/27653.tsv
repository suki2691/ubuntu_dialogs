2011-01-09T06:00:00.000Z	sion		My Ubuntu copy has a serious problem, when I shut down the computer it won't do it properly. Everytime it starts up it performs a disk check and it comes up with a message saying that "The disk drive for /tmp is not ready yet or not present". Can anyone advise me on how to fix this?
