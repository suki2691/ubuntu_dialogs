2007-09-30T11:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Jessica	I'm not sure there's any.  You want the alternate CD, to get a text-only system
2007-09-30T11:50:00.000Z	Flannel	Jessica	You'd have to install the DEsktop system (what you have), which will give you everything you have when you boot the liveCD.  You can later strip stuff off.  Or, go the text-only and build up, or go with something light weight like Xubuntu.
