2005-07-07T12:54:00.000Z	odie5533_		Anyone know why KDE doesn't give me the option for shutdown?
2005-07-07T12:55:00.000Z	odie5533_		and my WDM manager, when I try to halt it gives me "Error Halting"
2005-07-07T12:55:00.000Z	Seveas	odie5533_	because you use GDM
2005-07-07T12:55:00.000Z	Seveas	odie5533_	KDE can only offer a shutdown option if you run KDM
