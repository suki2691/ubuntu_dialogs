2010-08-06T06:17:00.000Z	PeterFA		I'm trying to get Ubuntu to connect to my Sierra 250u CDMA modem. I've search the Internet but found no definitive information. I did find however that there is a sierra module and I loaded it. However, I did not notice any device addition to my list of devices.
2010-08-06T06:18:00.000Z	PeterFA		How do I get my Sierra 250u CDMA modem to work?
