2012-06-10T12:25:00.000Z	PhantomSpark		I have a laptop with 8Gigs of mem should I be installing x64?
2012-06-10T12:27:00.000Z	cvr	PhantomSpark	because 32bit will work on both but 64bit will not
2012-06-10T12:27:00.000Z	PhantomSpark	cvr	Ah this makes sense
2012-06-10T12:28:00.000Z	cvr	PhantomSpark	so if you dont know what you're doing and you have to choose between the two and you have a 32bit machine and download the 64bit iso you'll run into problems
