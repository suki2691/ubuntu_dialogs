2007-05-02T13:29:00.000Z	Nubbie	killerbunny	as in a different one for the dictionary?
2007-05-02T13:30:00.000Z	killerbunny	Nubbie	yes.
2007-05-02T13:31:00.000Z	Nubbie	killerbunny	in applications > accessories > dictionary you can set up a new language in there. i'm not sure but i think it will be used systemwide.
