2008-12-11T16:49:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	LBSources	you can probably use Thunderbird to get email from Exhchange as long as your company has the IMAP server set up
2008-12-11T16:49:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash		AFAIK though, there's no official rpc over http
2008-12-11T16:50:00.000Z	LBSources	Robbie_Crash	as I said - RPC over HTTPS is what I need .. anything can do IMAP :)
