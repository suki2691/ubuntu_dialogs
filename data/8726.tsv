2011-10-15T09:26:00.000Z	almoxarife1	ghostnik11	you may be able to use thunderbird too, I am not saying it can't be done, best thing to do is try, if it does not work, then you know
2011-10-15T09:28:00.000Z	ghostnik11	almoxarife1	well i did try and looked for the addon for the integration with gnome 3 but its not there, reisio, wow i thought they only removed things because it was actually beneficial but i see your point the look of mac they might be thinking are more appealing to new people who are coming from mac to ubuntu
2011-10-15T09:33:00.000Z	ghostnik11	almoxarife1	well anyway its too late i am already uninstalled thunderbird, it was okay, reisio: i just feel evolution is more versatile when it comes to integration with google calender and address book, just not as hot looking as other calender programs with all the nice graphical designs, phiscibe: no the calender in thunderbird is lighting, evolution programs calender is built in and not an add on like thunderbird's
