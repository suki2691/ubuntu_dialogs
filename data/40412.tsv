2009-12-22T23:20:00.000Z	douglasawh-work_		is there any reason ubuntu doesn't use the same encryption set up as Fedora? In fedora I can actually get to the grub menu when I do full disk encryption
2009-12-22T23:21:00.000Z	maco	douglasawh-work_	we use lvm encryption. does fedora do something else?
2009-12-22T23:22:00.000Z	douglasawh-work_	maco	yeah, they use LVM. I think they just partition it differently
2009-12-22T23:23:00.000Z	maco	douglasawh-work_	i think with ubuntu its /boot unencrypted and then the rest encrypted
