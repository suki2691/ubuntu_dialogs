2009-02-06T03:26:00.000Z	pike_	blsecres	yes during install choose manual edit partition table option and set your mount points and make sure in the dropdown it doesnt say format
2009-02-06T03:26:00.000Z	pike_	blsecres	useful for like /home and stuff
2009-02-06T03:26:00.000Z	blsecres	pike_	I'm only given that option if the partitions aren't on a LVM
