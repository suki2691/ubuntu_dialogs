2009-12-29T05:26:00.000Z	Izinucs	keeev	do you have a dual boot install?
2009-12-29T05:27:00.000Z	Izinucs	keeev	I may have the answer for you if you're still around
2009-12-29T05:29:00.000Z	Izinucs	keeev	k.. I'll take a chance anyway.. download the ubuntu live cd iso.. install virtualbox in your win7.. load ubuntu there and use the built in tools to create a livecd on a usb stick.. boot to the newly created stick and fix grub.. no cd involved..
