2007-01-24T13:42:00.000Z	Marupa	bertam	 sudo chmod 0777 the directory.
2007-01-24T13:44:00.000Z	bertam	Marupa	Ok, now I am able to write to that directory.  I originally created ~/Storage with my user, but the permissions change after I "sudo mount -a".  Will I have to "sudo chmod 077" each time I reboot?
