2008-06-14T07:00:00.000Z	R2LM	ubunubi	Thanks, I have that too... that's why I'm not sure why I still see all the startup messages. Any other ideas?
2008-06-14T07:02:00.000Z	ubunubi	R2LM	Sorry, other than that I don't. When i had the default quiet splash, and the 4th line quiet by itself (also by default) I saw none of that. So it's outta my range of experience
