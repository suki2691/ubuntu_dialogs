2010-10-16T21:08:00.000Z	graeleight	linuxguy101	(pasting) I'm on ver 9.04. I have two DVD-RW drives. System recognizes that I have them but when I put media into them it doesn't seem to realize I have done so with the following exception. If I boot with the media already in the drive it gets recognized and mounted. Once mounted the DVDs play perfectly. I do not have wubi installed.
