2012-03-14T06:15:00.000Z	cn28h		I'd like to upgrade from 10.04 to 11.10 (with 11.04 in between if required), but Update Manager doesn't show the option (I assume because these aren't LTS?). Can I still do the old "aptitude dist-upgrade" or is that no longer considered good?
2012-03-14T06:16:00.000Z	Flumpy	cn28h	I believe you type "update-manager -d" or something similar in the terminal
2012-03-14T06:17:00.000Z	cn28h		hmm
2012-03-14T06:19:00.000Z	cn28h	Flumpy	cool, with -d it's offering me the 12.04 beta which works for me :D
