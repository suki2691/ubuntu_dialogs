2009-05-07T23:37:00.000Z	Dracofodder		I am moving some configuration files from my old kde/suse desktop over to ubuntu... everything has been straightforward except this ..  amarok.  I cannot figure out where the configurations are kept.  on kde it was under .kde/apps/amarok  where is the equivalent in a gnome desktop?
