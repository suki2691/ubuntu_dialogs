2010-08-24T23:53:00.000Z	minimec	ChogyDan	I agree, but it is the newest precompiled available for lucid.
2010-08-24T23:56:00.000Z	ChogyDan	minimec	I don't know what that tagging means, but I thought all those kernels could be installed were for whatever release, since they have no ubuntu patches
2010-08-24T23:58:00.000Z	minimec	ChogyDan	THat is a good questin. But with lucid there should be this new kernel upgrade policy. So I guess there will be an official *35 kernel available sooner or later.
