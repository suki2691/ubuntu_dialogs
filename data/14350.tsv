2011-10-20T19:59:00.000Z	MatthiasHamburg	trijntje	thank you, got more output now. but the gdm comes up immediately so I can't see anything
2011-10-20T19:59:00.000Z	trijntje	MatthiasHamburg	i'm sure those messages are logged somewhere, so you can always read them back later
2011-10-20T20:10:00.000Z	MatthiasHamburg	trijntje	thank you! I think I got what I want. Although the log runs through so fast that you can't read it, I can see that just takes some time to boot. No specific line where the boot stops for some seconds, as I expected
