2010-04-17T01:06:00.000Z	Sk_Lg		I just installed ubuntu on my main hard disk, and when I connect the ethernet cord (directly from the modem) to the comp it doesn't recognize the connection. Although, when I plug the cord in this computer the internet works fine? what packet should I dl, or settings should I manually put in to ensure the connection?
