2012-02-29T11:38:00.000Z	capecarnation		just about every person in this channel is a noob.  it is rare for someone that truly knows what they're doing to be in here.  nothing wrong with that :)

2012-02-29T11:39:00.000Z	capecarnation	CFHowlett	not necessary, but thanks.  i can either disable it in the system set up menu or install a package that gives me a gui.  i'm going the route of the latter ;)
