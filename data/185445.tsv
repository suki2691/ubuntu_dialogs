2006-06-29T10:05:00.000Z	ChrisC_		what is the default system font for "Applications" in dapper/6.06?
2006-06-29T10:07:00.000Z	ChrisC_		If your breezy/6.06 system is still set at the default system font settings, can you take a look at system -> pref -> fonts and tell me what your application font is?
