2010-02-20T02:38:00.000Z	candyban		is there a reason why my ata disks are /dev/sdx rather than /dev/hdx ? ... I'm also unable to use hdparm to change some settings (e.g. enable dma)

2010-02-20T02:39:00.000Z	candyban	arand	I haven't used ata for a long while ... so I didn't really notice
2010-02-20T02:42:00.000Z	candyban	arand	haffe is there a way to enable dma ? (as I'm getting rather poor performance ... but perhaps 6MB/s is ok for a p3?)
