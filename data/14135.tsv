2011-05-20T11:02:00.000Z	TwoCircuits		So I decided to stick with 10.10... Will future Ubuntu apps still work for it?
2011-05-20T11:02:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	TwoCircuits	yes, of course
2011-05-20T11:03:00.000Z	TwoCircuits	thegoodcushion	- so there won't be a point where something will only work for 11.04?
2011-05-20T11:03:00.000Z	thegoodcushion	TwoCircuits	That would be pretty rare
