2006-04-15T06:39:00.000Z	Irving		what kind of window manager should I install if I want to run an asterix or apache server on a laptop?
2006-04-15T06:39:00.000Z	Irving		Yeah, I wanted a simple window manager, not a desktop environment or anything.
2006-04-15T06:41:00.000Z	Irving		ok thanks
2006-04-15T06:41:00.000Z	lozzd2	Irving	i can say that ubuntu as a server works pretty well, but i have nothing to compare it against :P
