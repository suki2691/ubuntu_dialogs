2006-06-14T10:38:00.000Z	usound		hey, I've a question: I started an Ubuntu 5.10 to 6.06 upgrade (with the new update-manager), but the power cut half way through. System is fine, but is there a way to continue from where it crashed?
2006-06-14T10:38:00.000Z	mbgb14	usound	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-06-14T10:41:00.000Z	usound	mbgb14	thanx, I guess its working now (maybe start over but not as bad as update-manager - "231 packages could not be installed, bla bla bla")
2006-06-14T10:41:00.000Z	mbgb14	usound	no problem, glad that helped :)
