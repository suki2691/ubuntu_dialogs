2005-10-12T10:46:00.000Z	Knelix		Hey guys... I have to do a project for a computer education class hat involves finding and demonstrating a piece of educational software. Everyone else is bringing in Windoze sw, but I want to bring in Linux-compatible software, specifically something to do with English, but anything will help. Would edubuntu have anything special or could I find the same software on synaptic?
