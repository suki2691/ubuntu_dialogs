2005-11-02T14:27:00.000Z	Javid		I am a linux noob that wants to get XMMS working
2005-11-02T14:27:00.000Z	Javid		I will assume I am not since I do now know what that is
2005-11-02T14:27:00.000Z	barongas	Javid	my biggest issue with getting xmms working was installing alsa and making sure the esd is off, lemme see if I can snag up a guide...
