I just got Ubuntu running on my laptop and I think its the flavor for me! ;) however I am having problems getting the ethernet and wireless cards working,  The wired card(Linksys NP100 pcmcia) works fine w/ Mandrake 9.1, Mandrake 10.2 does not see it.  Ubuntu Does not see it either.  I want to go w/ Ubuntu can anyone help me get it working?
