2010-10-10T20:46:00.000Z	dt_		is it safe to upgrade 10.04->10.10 yet ? :P
2010-10-10T20:47:00.000Z	dt_		hmm, so 10.10 is still in development...? I don't see an upgrade option via update manager on 10.04
2010-10-10T20:48:00.000Z	dt_		apt-get upgrade and update manager do nothing
2010-10-10T20:48:00.000Z	cupis	dt_	run update-manager and change the settings to normal
