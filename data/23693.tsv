2011-01-02T08:33:00.000Z	arvut		all this virustalk has made me brainstorm about clamav.. can you make it scan a pipe, say from eth0?
2011-01-02T08:35:00.000Z	arvut		or wait.. can you route eth0 thru clamscan?
2011-01-02T08:35:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	arvut	that would probably be the way
2011-01-02T08:36:00.000Z	shane4ubuntu	arvut	but really I don't think eth0 would be a concern unless running a server
