2009-05-06T23:50:00.000Z	w3ccv		WiFi question.  I have UNR (U Netbook Remix) kenel 2.6.28-11.  And a Netgear WG111v2 wifi dongle on loan. I also have a VPN111. The WG111 installs modules when plugged in, and works. The VPN111 does not. Ok, since I need to return the WG111 soon, how do I get the VPN111 to work. More modules ? How to load them at 'plug in time'?
