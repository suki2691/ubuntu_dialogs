2008-04-24T20:57:00.000Z	marwell		Are there any real benefits, jet, choosing 64bit vs. 32bit-x86 version of ubuntu? Is flash-plugin available in 64bit btw?
2008-04-24T20:57:00.000Z	dajhorn	marwell	Use 32-bit unless you have more than 4 GB of memory in the computer.
2008-04-24T21:01:00.000Z	marwell	dajhorn	Ok.. Not a lot of benefits using 64bit? Comparing performance? (I have 2GB)
2008-04-24T21:02:00.000Z	dajhorn	marwell	Yes, and the stuff that actually needs the 64-bit goodies, like Xen and VMware, know how to get at it.
