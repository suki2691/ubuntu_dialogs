2011-06-07T04:54:00.000Z	KM0201	NiMH	depends on how new.. a friend of mine put ubuntu on a macbook pro.. had a LOT of problems
2011-06-07T04:55:00.000Z	KM0201	NiMH	you might have some issues, i believe hers is like one of the newest available (she got it like 4-5mo ago)
2011-06-07T05:00:00.000Z	KM0201	NiMH	something you should note... my friend, could not get a USB to boot on her Macbook... she actually had to create a USB, and a CD, in order to use a linux live session.  It's documented if you do some searching (again.. very new macbook)
