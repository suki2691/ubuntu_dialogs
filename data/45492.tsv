2009-10-18T14:17:00.000Z	StockBrian		Iceroot: forgive me, I'm a bit new to Linux. tried what you said in terminal but "nmap" isn't installed. What did I miss?
2009-10-18T14:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StockBrian	 install nmap if you want to use nmap
2009-10-18T14:18:00.000Z	StockBrian		VNC problem: Two identical laptops can connect with UltraVNC through WinXP just fine. One laptop has the Non-partitioned Ubuntu install 9.04 (jaunty) and I"m trying to use inlcuded VNC to connect to XP (and vice versa, neither works)
2009-10-18T14:19:00.000Z	StockBrian	Dr_Willis	Thanks, that wasn't the source problem though. VNC is. =(
