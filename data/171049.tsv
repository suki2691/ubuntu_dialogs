2007-05-05T06:50:00.000Z	sharperguy	crazy_bus	You'll need to install beryl
2007-05-05T06:51:00.000Z	sharperguy	crazy_bus	"sudo apt-get install beryl beryl-manager beryl-effects-unsupported"  (I'm pretty sure snow and rain are in unsupported), then run beryl-manager to switch to beryl
2007-05-05T06:52:00.000Z	sharperguy	crazy_bus	ah right well I don't know about that
