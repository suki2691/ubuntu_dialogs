2006-08-12T12:44:00.000Z	Mitrovarr		 hey, I got the sound-juicer doesn't do mp3s problem fixed.  Is anyone interested in the solution?
2006-08-12T12:46:00.000Z	Mitrovarr		what's up with MP3 not being supported anyway?  I mean, there's like 1 billion free mp3 programs on the net, so obviously the license or patent or whatever can't be very restrictive
2006-08-12T12:46:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	Mitrovarr	mp3 has some patent issues.
2006-08-12T12:47:00.000Z	Mitrovarr	hyperactivecrond	 Rippon:  I know that, but the patent or whatever can't be terribly restrictive if I can get free mp3 encoders/decoders at a million net places.  Why isn't it just included?  I'm sure there's a good reason, I'm just wondering if one of you know it.
