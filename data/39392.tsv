2010-02-24T06:27:00.000Z	Jef91		is there a way I can loop through all the .deb files in a directory and install them one at a time with a single terminal command?
2010-02-24T06:28:00.000Z	DasEi	Jef91	put them in script, if they are really such many
2010-02-24T06:28:00.000Z	Jef91	DasEi	can't I run a for loop in bash?
2010-02-24T06:29:00.000Z	DasEi	Jef91	yes, can, but not needed for that purpose
