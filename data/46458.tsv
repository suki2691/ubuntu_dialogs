2010-08-21T00:15:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	JoshuaL	i don't know what format iPad uses/accepts - but i'm going to guess MP4 (with AAC audio) - so Handbrake is probably your best bet on Ubuntu right now
2010-08-21T00:16:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	JoshuaL	ffmpeg on ubuntu doesn't support AAC right now
2010-08-21T00:18:00.000Z	JoshuaL	ZykoticK9	said ffmpeg doesnt support AAC, so ill give handbrake a try :)
