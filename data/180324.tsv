2006-06-14T12:34:00.000Z	psyke83		hi, I installed xubuntu-desktop and it's changed my gdm theme. I want to keep xubuntu, but change the gdm theme back to the orange default, does anyone know how?
2006-06-14T12:34:00.000Z	untwisted	psyke83	you should be able to go to the theme manager and change back to 'human'
2006-06-14T12:34:00.000Z	untwisted		in the gdm theme manager
2006-06-14T12:35:00.000Z	psyke83	untwisted	where's the gdm theme manager?
