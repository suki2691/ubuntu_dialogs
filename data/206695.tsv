2006-08-31T06:21:00.000Z	Tomtheman70		Quick question, how do I find out what I have installed on my machine. Is there a command that can show me what programs I have installed and what I type to launch programs that I've just installed?

2006-08-31T06:22:00.000Z	sethk	Tomtheman70	you can list installed packages at the command line, etc.
2006-08-31T06:23:00.000Z	sethk	Tomtheman70	the nice thing about using synaptic is that it has a description of each package rather than just the name
