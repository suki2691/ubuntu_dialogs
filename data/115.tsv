2004-09-28T13:36:00.000Z	_1oo7		but i would think that is more bochs testing than ubuntu testing,... so..
2004-09-28T13:36:00.000Z	jdub	_1oo7	it works well under qemu, but slowly ;)
2004-09-28T13:38:00.000Z	_1oo7	jdub	; i was very excited to try bochs on a new PC i bought for the pipe dream of running windows on it and thus being able to rip win98 off my wife's laptop; but i lost my thunder after seeing how !quick bochs ran.  qemu is quicker, but is focused on emulating a linux, rather than a 386, right?
