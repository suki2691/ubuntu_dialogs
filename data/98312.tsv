2008-03-06T05:00:00.000Z	Gnea	Bigg400	should work just fine. what vm have you looked at?
2008-03-06T05:00:00.000Z	Bigg400	Gnea	not sure was thinking VirtualBox
2008-03-06T05:01:00.000Z	Gnea	Bigg400	haven't used that. vmware is my favorite, though. if you get the workstation you can get a 30-day license and create all of the virtual disks you need, then run/install with vmplayer
