2011-02-21T02:47:00.000Z	Pnux		Hey.. is it possible to tell Ubuntu to always get the same internal IP? Lets say 192.168.1.10
2011-02-21T02:48:00.000Z	kdcisit1	Pnux	you can set ubuntu to use static IP or you can create a reservation on your DHCP service
2011-02-21T02:49:00.000Z	Pnux	kdcisit1	thanks, ill explore those 2 options
2011-02-21T02:50:00.000Z	kdcisit1	Pnux	I have done both. pretty simple with network manager for static.  DHCP needs admin for reservation
