2005-08-26T06:46:00.000Z	NatureTruth		i have just successfully compiled kernel 2.6.12 in hoary.  Everything seems to be working well except that my fat volume is not mounted.  It worked before.  And my ntfs volume is mounted.  It's just the fat volume that doesn't get mounted.  And when I try to manually mount it, i get mount: /dev/hdb1 already mounted or /mnt/archive busy.  Help anyone please
2005-08-26T06:47:00.000Z	Davus	NatureTruth	did you compile with FAT support and whatnot?
2005-08-26T06:49:00.000Z	NatureTruth	Davus	 yes, I did...is whatnot a filesystem?
