2005-10-22T10:15:00.000Z	chimaera		apt-get source works as user anyway..
2005-10-22T10:15:00.000Z	ds[de] 	chimaera	but it would still download the source package into the current dir right?
2005-10-22T10:17:00.000Z	ds[de] 	chimaera	so what's the difference between typing sudo apt-get source and just apt-get source if it's downloaded in the current dir anyway?
