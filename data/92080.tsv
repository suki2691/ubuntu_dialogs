2009-06-21T13:22:00.000Z	Surlent777	benjisal	Those are just pictures...you need to go to the source images and make them bigger, I think
2009-06-21T13:24:00.000Z	Surlent777	benjisal	If you do that, you may have to manually re-load the pictures in the theme details...just in case it throws them in a cache somewhere or whatever
