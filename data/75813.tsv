2008-11-05T01:21:00.000Z	davelbarton		OK, I'm kind of leery about shoving in here, but I have a wired Ethernet connection that I can't connect to.
2008-11-05T01:22:00.000Z	davelbarton		May I ask for assistance?
2008-11-05T01:23:00.000Z	davelbarton		Apologies.  Can anyone help with an ethernet connection that I can't get going?
2008-11-05T01:23:00.000Z	DracNoc	davelbarton	if you need to ask, just ask. It's crowded here, be clear and to-the-point - it really helps (and welcome!)
