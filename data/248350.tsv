2005-06-27T06:20:00.000Z	CarlK		is there a way to run ifdown && ifup when my IP evaporates?
2005-06-27T06:20:00.000Z	cthulfuego	CarlK	evaporates?
2005-06-27T06:21:00.000Z	CarlK	cthulfuego	like just now, my pings tuned into "ping: sendmsg: Network is unreachable"
2005-06-27T06:22:00.000Z	CarlK	cthulfuego	and ifocnfig doesn't show an IP, but the "signal stength" stays at 90%
