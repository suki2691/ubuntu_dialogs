2007-03-25T13:37:00.000Z	bluefox83	Amon_Re	ibelieve you can pop the installer cd in and use the repair feature...
2007-03-25T13:38:00.000Z	Amon_Re	bluefox83	been doing that, would help if i knew exactly what i'm doing ;)
2007-03-25T13:39:00.000Z	bluefox83	Amon_Re	yeah...i see what you mean..i've never done anything with raid, so i'm afraid i can't help much in that department...
