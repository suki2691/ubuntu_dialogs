2009-04-24T10:01:00.000Z	unkmar	bonez46	are you able to reach the system from inside the LAN?
2009-04-24T10:01:00.000Z	bonez46	unkmar	no, I can't ssh to it from other machines.. despite all being on the same linksys router
2009-04-24T10:01:00.000Z	unkmar	bonez46	do you have sshd installed and running?
