2009-01-14T03:59:00.000Z	ScottG		I'm having trouble connecting to my colleges wifi while im using ubuntu on my laptop. I went there and the tech support guy gave me the XP guide to use since it explains what kind of authentication and encription to use. So I set up a custom network but it still won't connect. The only thing I see that the guide explains to use but I can't designate is that it asks to use AES for the Data Encription. There isn't anywhere to designate the type of encription

2009-01-14T04:01:00.000Z	ScottG	Adam_	Yes I do see them listed.
