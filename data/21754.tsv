I did something a bit stupid so please don't laugh haha Here is the problem: my system frozen while updating Ubuntu 10.04 to 10.10 by using the Ubunt updater and couldn't restart Ubuntu at all (I have dual boot with XP SP3). So I decided to reinstall from scratch. Then I formatted my Ubuntu partition by using the Window XP...

Grub had disappeared and I couldnt start XP anymore! the message on the screen is "error: no such partition" then "gub rescue>" on a 2nd line. I can still access my XP partiton thru the live CD. How can I repair the boot menu, by using the XP CD?
