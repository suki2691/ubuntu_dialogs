2012-10-28T05:44:00.000Z	davelindberg	rajmahendra	Ah... When I went from 11.10 to 12.04 (I think) I bought a game I forgot the name, but it wasn't compatible with 12.04 even though it ran in 11.10.  I assumed it was an issue with the game... Vendor could not get me back working so I had to stop playing. :(
