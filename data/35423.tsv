2010-03-30T20:20:00.000Z	fgfdfg		Hello, I have been trying to go into super user mode with the command su to change my password but when I type the password that I use to login it says authentication failure.
2010-03-30T20:21:00.000Z	fgfdfg		Can someone please help me with this problem?
2010-03-30T20:23:00.000Z	fgfdfg		WOW... it lets me do sudo without asking for password? This sounds very unsecure
