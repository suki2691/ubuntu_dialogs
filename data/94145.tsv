2008-04-21T20:31:00.000Z	name10135		Still looking for help with a text-based dual-boot install for a first time linux user.
2008-04-21T20:31:00.000Z	skarface	name10135	what's the problem?\
2008-04-21T20:33:00.000Z	name10135	skarface	Unsure of how to setup partition settings in the installer without destroying windows partition (I already have 20GB set aside ext3 for linux)
2008-04-21T20:36:00.000Z	name10135	skarface	/ Exteris: Again, need to hold my hand here, I'm intimately familiar w/ Win installer, but clueless in Linux.  @ the Partition Disks screen in installer, Guided options, or manual options?
