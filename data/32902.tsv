2010-05-05T06:34:00.000Z	quietone	shishire	I do not normally use mirror.
2010-05-05T06:36:00.000Z	shishire	quietone	what I meant was that if you're not mirroring, check to see where the secondary is in relation to the primary.  Seeing your wallpaper means that it's getting recognized and set up, but you don't necessarily know how to get to it.
