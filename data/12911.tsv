2011-06-25T05:01:00.000Z	xemilyx		ok, i have figured out the problem in the term, 'sudo su' duh. so now the printer installer wont accept my password
2011-06-25T05:02:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xemilyx	don't use "sudo su" -- use "sudo -i" instead!
2011-06-25T05:03:00.000Z	xemilyx	ZykoticK9	thanks for that info. but my problem with the printer installer not accepting my pw still exists
2011-06-25T05:03:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	xemilyx	?  good luck.
