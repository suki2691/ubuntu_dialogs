2009-01-13T19:56:00.000Z	Vixy		Hello everyone. I have a 64 bit processor and about 6Gigs of RAM. I'm trying to decide if I should install the 64 bit version of 8.10 or 8.04. I was told that 8.10 is still having a lot of issues, where as 8.04 is more stable. Which would be better for someone who is just starting out using Ubuntu?

2009-01-13T19:58:00.000Z	Vixy	ActionParsnip1	Even though there are still quite a few issues with it?
