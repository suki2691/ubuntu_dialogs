2005-04-14T11:48:00.000Z	apokryphos	johso	I think it was gnome-volume-control on GNOME
2005-04-14T11:54:00.000Z	johso	apokryphos	I was more thinking about the device - like, how do I configure drivers etc. for my soundcard?
2005-04-14T11:57:00.000Z	apokryphos	johso	sorry, no idea; not using GNOME here
