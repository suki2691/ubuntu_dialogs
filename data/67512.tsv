2009-06-30T00:28:00.000Z	hanasaki		I have cups-pdf installed ... where are the files going and what are they named?
2009-06-30T00:30:00.000Z	mdm	hanasaki	it makes pdf files of what you print and its default is to put them in /var/spool/cups-pdf
2009-06-30T00:31:00.000Z	hanasaki	mdm	 nope.. empty directories
2009-06-30T00:32:00.000Z	hanasaki	mdm	 they are not going here either from /etc/cups/cups-pdf
