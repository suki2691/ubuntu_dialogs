2010-01-04T23:32:00.000Z	skfet		I've got two hard disks, one with windows7, the other one with LinuxMint8 (ubuntu). Both os's are fully encrypted. In order to restore grub2 I have to manually mount the linux partitions. Does anyone know how to this, since they're all encrypted (luks)?

2010-01-04T23:33:00.000Z	skfet	Pulse9	will that solve the mounting issue?
