2008-10-20T05:47:00.000Z	MtStGabriel		If I'm trying to install ubuntu on an intel core 2 duo, do I want the 64 bit version, or the regular version?
2008-10-20T05:47:00.000Z	kyrksaeterora	MtStGabriel	that's a matter of prefrence, as it can run both.
2008-10-20T05:48:00.000Z	kyrksaeterora	MtStGabriel	I don't know how well ubuntu deals in a 64 bit environment, though
