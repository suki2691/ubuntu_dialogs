2010-11-11T11:21:00.000Z	e26063		how do I fix my init script giving an error: unable to set GID?
2010-11-11T11:22:00.000Z	e26063		I want to get my minecraft server working with an init script, but I can't get the permissions to work for non-sudoers user accounts...
2010-11-11T11:23:00.000Z	lucent	e26063	an upstart script need be run as root uid, so... that's the end of it. I think.
2010-11-11T12:02:00.000Z	e26063	lucent	thanks for the tip.  I was wondering if that was all that was needed.  so if I want to have backup admins able to restart the script, they must be in the sudoers file...
