2005-02-14T10:11:00.000Z	thechitow		I have a laptop and I want to get my wireless working, it is based on the Centrino Chipset, what would be the steps I should take to get this to work?... Ubuntu detects it and knows its there but I have no clue of how to get wireless to work.  I have a light normally on the front that indicates if it is on, but it isn't =/
