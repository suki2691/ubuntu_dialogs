2008-11-24T12:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest22181	 you can't have the wirless and wired lan on the same network at the same time
2008-11-24T12:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Guest22181	I'm not sure what your saying, when you enable your wirless card, the router has connection problems, or do you mean just the machine with the wirless card
