2005-11-24T12:00:00.000Z	progbliss		Using latest X.org and latest fglrx. Complaints in dmesg output about missing map. Only problem in Xorg.0.log is that it takes several retries to get to the device. What do I do from here to get hardware 3D acceleration working?
2005-11-24T12:02:00.000Z	tritium	progbliss	you're using ubuntu fglrx packages?  Or by "latest", do you mean you installed something from ATI's website?
2005-11-24T12:03:00.000Z	progbliss	tritium	I'm using the ubuntu. I figured those would work better. Should I use from ati's site
2005-11-24T12:04:00.000Z	tritium	progbliss	no, please don't
