2008-09-25T05:32:00.000Z	jrib	JunTa1	because youtube's page circumvents it.  Go to a regular page like http://badgerbadgerbadger.com and it will work
2008-09-25T05:34:00.000Z	JunTa1	jrib	what do you mean? i can't view youtube videos?
2008-09-25T05:34:00.000Z	jrib	JunTa1	no.  Just visit http://badgerbadgerbadger.com and click the yellow bar at the top
