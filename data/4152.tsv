2012-04-04T12:48:00.000Z	anthropos	TommoDMC	i would use x11vnc if i were you
2012-04-04T12:49:00.000Z	TommoDMC	anthropos	you mean just install x11vnc over whatever I'd installed already? I have 11.10 desktop and whatever GUI comes with it natively, so I'd have expected it to be 'vncserver'... except I can't find that in /etc/
2012-04-04T13:01:00.000Z	anthropos	TommoDMC	i think ubuntu uses vino normally. i don't use it
