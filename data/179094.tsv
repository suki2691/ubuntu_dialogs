2008-04-22T08:17:00.000Z	kittykitty		ok screw this, i've delt with this problem like a billion flipping times and it is just escaping me in my old freaking age
2008-04-22T08:17:00.000Z	kittykitty		how do i get apache / web browser to stop asking me to save the stupid .php output and just display it instead?
2008-04-22T08:19:00.000Z	kittykitty		php5 is installed, the output is fine, if i take the time to save it to disk, then rename it to .html instead
2008-04-22T08:20:00.000Z	jrib	kittykitty	follow the troubleshooting section for that problem on the wiki page
