2007-09-10T09:16:00.000Z	angel25_		ok thanks
2007-09-10T09:18:00.000Z	angel25_		after i use the command "gksudo nautilus" there is away to return to normal mode (file browser without root access) ?
2007-09-10T09:18:00.000Z	slavik	angel25_	just run nautilus ... but I don't think apps can be moved between root and nonroot access (which kind of sucks)
