2011-01-11T00:07:00.000Z	justask	Haunt_House	which autostart? the one of ubuntu?
2011-01-11T00:08:00.000Z	Haunt_House	justask	yes, it's in system>>sessions
2011-01-11T00:09:00.000Z	Haunt_House	justask	yes, the builtin stuff like notification of updates works. I guess python is not ready when the script is executed, But I don't know how to check
