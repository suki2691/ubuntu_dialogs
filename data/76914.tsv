2008-11-03T03:00:00.000Z	\Kira		Im running ubuntu server on an old pc with no moniter or keyboard. I control the system via ssh from my kubuntu box. I want to run a command on the server that takes about a week to finish, but I don't want to keep my kubuntu box up and running the whole week. Is there a way I can get the command to run, log out from the server, and log back in perodically to check on it?

2008-11-03T03:02:00.000Z	RyanPrior	\Kira	"man screen" for more information about screen. It's a very useful tool.
