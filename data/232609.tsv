2006-08-27T08:36:00.000Z	cornel1		I'd asked a question earlier.... ubotu answered with  a link.  I installed the package suggested.  The page then said to run a comand, a build or make script.  I tried.  It said I don't a c compiler.  I installed gcc and ran again.  It still says I don't have a c compiler.  What do I do now?  How do "install" a c compiler, when I just did?
