2007-12-10T06:04:00.000Z	Tuche_		noob question, i am downloading torrents, but i would like at the same time be on a low power comsumption profile, if i hibernate my ubuntu, will my torrents continue seeding ?

2007-12-10T06:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Tuche_	 i very much doubt that.
2007-12-10T06:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Tuche_	 there really is no option.. seeding is accessing the hard drive and so forth..
