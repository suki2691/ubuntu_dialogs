2007-03-08T14:10:00.000Z	craigbass1976		I'm trying to run a shell script, which I can do fine in a terminal.  Now though, I want a desktop icon that I can double lick on.  I'm using 6.06 with GNOME.  I've made the icon, but all I see is a flash of a terminal.  The script has a read-p at the end (so I can see the script output) but I'm not prompted.  What gives?
