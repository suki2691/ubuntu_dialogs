2008-10-21T16:09:00.000Z	jron_	roxan	just wanted to let you know that my bridge is working again. I removed network-manager (or network-admin) whatever that POS is called. :P added my etho settings and all is well.

2008-10-21T16:10:00.000Z	jron_	roxan	i'll find out in min. brb =)
2008-10-21T16:13:00.000Z	jron_	roxan	still working. =) For anyone having issues with their "advanced" network config, just uninstall network-manager. =)
