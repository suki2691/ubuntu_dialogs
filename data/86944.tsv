2008-07-12T10:13:00.000Z	marvin__	martosurf	you'll have to do a complete removal of teh metacity package and then reinstall it
2008-07-12T10:15:00.000Z	marvin__	martosurf	if this does happen apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2008-07-12T10:17:00.000Z	marvin__	martosurf	the metacity package is part of ubuntu-desktop, am I correct?
