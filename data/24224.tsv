2010-12-28T07:22:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	KM0201	still I believe it would still work if you add rules to the table, it'll block, pretty sure its active just with noting configured
2010-12-28T07:23:00.000Z	KM0201	psycho_oreos	i don't know.. i don't think it is.... i'm behind a router though.. and when i've needed ports open, i just open my router, and it works
2010-12-28T07:26:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	KM0201	what I meant is that if you add a rule to the iptables table, like for example drop all outgoing packets it will do so without needing to be started
