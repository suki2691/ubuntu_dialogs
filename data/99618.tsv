2008-10-26T17:55:00.000Z	jim_p	Nvidiot	samba WILL start on every boot unless you say it not to.
2008-10-26T17:56:00.000Z	Nvidiot	jim_p	it wasn't started after installing it and rebooting...
2008-10-26T17:56:00.000Z	jim_p	Nvidiot	and for service (sudo service...) to work you need sysvconf-rc installed
