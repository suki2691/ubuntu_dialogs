2011-04-28T11:36:00.000Z	x3464		Yes....  a sea of confusion.
2011-04-28T11:37:00.000Z	econnell	x3464	this is why i think not distributing a deb and not running a PPA will force their hand...  especially when they find out there's new features they can't use
2011-04-28T11:38:00.000Z	x3464	econnell	 I agree...  Mangler should go primetime now.  PPA is just ugly.
