2010-01-04T22:03:00.000Z	schilli		I booted lucid in an Eee 1005hab.  I hooked up an external monitor and it recognized it, but when I tried to make the monitors not mirror the desktop and panels went away!  The cursor was still there and moved correctly between the two monitors.

2010-01-04T22:04:00.000Z	schilli	patdk-wk	it is working fine right now in Karmic
