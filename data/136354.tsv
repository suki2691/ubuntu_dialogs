2010-03-03T02:27:00.000Z	dabaR	demonspork	doesn't sound like that would make sense.
2010-03-03T02:27:00.000Z	dabaR	demonspork	if you mean can he decrypt them magically just cause he is root
2010-03-03T02:28:00.000Z	demonspork	dabaR	Would the encrypted directories be accessible by root if he uses su to have a shell in the owners name?
