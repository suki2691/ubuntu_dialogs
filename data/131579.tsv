2007-06-07T09:48:00.000Z	nux_usr	Jordan_U	and  helfrez ,  Understood and I agree.  I just don't look forward to the upgrade.  :-(
2007-06-07T09:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nux_usr	Just so you know ( not sure if this was the case yet for breezy to Dapper ) but the upgrade procedure is *not* to change your sources.list and dist-upgrade, it's to use "gksu update-manager -c"
2007-06-07T09:54:00.000Z	nux_usr	Jordan_U	 I always do clean installs... never upgrade from one version to another.  Too many loose ends to go back and clean up.
