2005-08-24T07:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rayde	if you mean through apt/synaptic etc, it just installs the new kernel automagically
2005-08-24T07:04:00.000Z	rayde	thoreauputic	hmm... should i be seeing a change in the response to uname -a after the newer kernel is sintalled?
2005-08-24T07:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	rayde	only if you reboot
