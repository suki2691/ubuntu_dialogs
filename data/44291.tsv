2011-01-08T01:34:00.000Z	rpaisley		I've gotten a new SSD Hard drive.  Old one used encryption, new one I don't want ot pay the 50% encryption penalty.  I mounted the old encrypted one under /target during rescue, and copied everything to the new one.  When it boots, it fails to do the crypt setup.  How do I turn that off?
