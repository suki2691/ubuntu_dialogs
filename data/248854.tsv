2005-08-07T06:48:00.000Z	chiisai		Err... For some reason, synaptic refuses to start. It doesn't even give me a error message, the window never shows up. So... where do I start? How can I fix this? (No, I don't want to reboot. That's just so Windows-like. Rebooting a Linux system is just... stupid.)
