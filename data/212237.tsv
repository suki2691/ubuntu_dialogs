2005-12-09T10:50:00.000Z	Dandel	mister_roboto	what about configuring the dumb sound... i gotta remap the 5.1 outputs :/
2005-12-09T10:52:00.000Z	mister_roboto	Dandel	configure sound? remap 5.1 output?   I thought you were just talking about running Firefox 1.5?  You don't need to do anything with your sound for that
