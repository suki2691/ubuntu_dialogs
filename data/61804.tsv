2009-09-27T17:08:00.000Z	nikki93		I have an application I'm developing on Linux, but I want to test it under Windows periodically. I have a dev environment set up on my Windows parition (dual boot), is it possible to boot into it through a VM and then compile the app there (after a 'git pull')? Dual booting is getting boring...

2009-09-27T17:12:00.000Z	grawity	nikki93	Btw, it's often possible to build Windows applications on Linux.
2009-09-27T17:12:00.000Z	nikki93	grawity	Yeah, but it's hard for this program, easy for simpler programs. For this one I have to do it for all the dependencies..
