2007-04-11T13:54:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder		I want to try out the Feisty 7.04 beta. Is it possible for it to co-exist on my computer with Edgy? Do I have to put in on a separate partition? What do I need to do?
2007-04-11T13:56:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder		Ok thanks... And how about grub? Will the feisty installer modify it to show both the fesity parition installation and the edgy partition installation?
2007-04-11T13:58:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder		Anyone know how far away until the first non-beta release of feisty?
