2006-05-14T15:18:00.000Z	josh0001		Hi guys, just installed a fresh copy of dapper drake flight 6 on my 64bit amd computer, and I've come across some bugs, so I've started to report them, but I am confused at the input form. It states "Path of sendmail" I'm not sure what to put in there
2006-05-14T15:20:00.000Z	gnomefreak	josh0001	did you install and set up sendmail?
2006-05-14T15:20:00.000Z	gnomefreak	josh0001	please join #ubuntu+1 with me and i will help you
2006-05-14T15:20:00.000Z	josh0001	gnomefreak	 Nope, I've just installed it, not setup anything.
