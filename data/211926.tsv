2007-03-29T10:20:00.000Z	bill		hello... quick question... AFAICT, the apache-ssl package does not have mod_proxy included, and there is no separate package for it?  is there no way to get mod_proxy without compiling it by hand?
2007-03-29T10:22:00.000Z	bimberi	bill	it comes with apache[2] 
2007-03-29T10:23:00.000Z	bill	bimberi	i don't want to use apache2... does the plain apache 1.3 package have it? and if so, why doesn't the apache-ssl package have it?
2007-03-29T10:27:00.000Z	bimberi	bill	hm, no the apache package doesn't have it.  Not sure what the story is sorry
