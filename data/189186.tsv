2008-03-23T16:48:00.000Z	Jay_		Hi....Can I safely delete the fonts from mt "fonts:///" directory.?
2008-03-23T16:49:00.000Z	gregory	Jay_	why would you want to del them?
2008-03-23T16:50:00.000Z	gregory	Jay_	start up time of the os? or a specific program?
2008-03-23T16:52:00.000Z	gregory	Jay_	well thats true. still i would keep the fonts. unless you want to fix it afterwards booting from a live cd and manually copying them back
