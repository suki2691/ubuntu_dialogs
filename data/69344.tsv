2009-01-08T02:40:00.000Z	karelm	jesh	you mean remap some keys? Well, I would think so too, except that when I go into the shortcuts prefpane and I press for example alt + y, it shows up as "alt + y", so it seems to be correctly recognized...
2009-01-08T02:46:00.000Z	jesh	karelm	yes, i meant remapping and adjusting shifting keys (i once had broken alt gr because it was mapped for some odd reason to mod1, remove fixed it)
2009-01-08T02:48:00.000Z	karelm	jesh	and what should I remap "ALT" to? It already shows as "ALT" in keyboard shortcuts, just doesn't work for characters...
