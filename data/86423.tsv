2008-07-04T09:05:00.000Z	ftehw		curious:  why are many apps installable via apt-get but not Add/Remove Apps?
2008-07-04T09:06:00.000Z	ftehw		examples - zsh, mpd
2008-07-04T09:06:00.000Z	svenstaro	ftehw	because add/remove the meant to be the noob-version of synaptic, if you want a gui for packages use synaptic , system -> admin > synaptic
2008-07-04T09:07:00.000Z	ftehw	svenstaro	aha!  thanks.
