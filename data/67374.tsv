2009-02-14T01:24:00.000Z	tlchack5		or should i just try like kubuntu or eubuntu?
2009-02-14T01:25:00.000Z	tlchack5		k, lets start from here... will xubuntu work well for programing? like can i run kdevelop on it (cuz thats the main reason im switching my dell to linux distros is to program)

2009-02-14T01:26:00.000Z	DIFH-ice1oot	tlchack5	but apt-get is installing these libs automaticly
