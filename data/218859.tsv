2005-11-08T08:02:00.000Z	Baal		I am trying to configure a program to compile and it keeps telling me that getopt is not there.  The getopt executable is in the /usr/bin directory.  What is wrong?
2005-11-08T08:02:00.000Z	pr0tocol	Baal	direct it to where it's at
2005-11-08T08:02:00.000Z	pr0tocol	Baal	set a prefix
2005-11-08T08:03:00.000Z	pr0tocol	Baal	read the INSTALL file
