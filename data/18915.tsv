2012-08-23T14:49:00.000Z	franzmar		Hi everyone. I'm new to ubuntu and linux in general, and am currently using windows, but when I restart the computer, windows boots instead of linux, any help on making linux booting?
2012-08-23T14:49:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	franzmar	 how did you install ubuntu?
2012-08-23T14:51:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	franzmar	 on its own partition, or wubi?
