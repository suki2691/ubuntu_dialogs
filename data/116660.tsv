2008-04-28T04:29:00.000Z	demonspork	Derspankster	are you talking about firefox? because the firefox beta is in better shape than anything microsoft has ever called a final release
2008-04-28T04:29:00.000Z	Derspankster	demonspork	I don't remember mentioning MS?
2008-04-28T04:30:00.000Z	demonspork	Derspankster	I was just making a comparison, saying that beta products are not bad, in fact they are usually pretty good
