2005-10-28T13:23:00.000Z	offbyone	ateves	in the current directory
2005-10-28T13:23:00.000Z	offbyone		So if you're in a command prompt, ./
2005-10-28T13:23:00.000Z	ateves	offbyone	yes, i thought so, too. but i'm in the desktop folder, and WGET downloads the files, but they are not located in the desktop folder
