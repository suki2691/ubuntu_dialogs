2011-07-15T15:48:00.000Z	andax		i'm looking for a way to link my phone to a laptop so I can accept/decline incoming calls from the computer. ( like in a car ) What is the name of this feature? I cannot google because I don't know how this is called :) Please someone tell me the name of this feature.

2011-07-15T15:49:00.000Z	SuperLag	andax	and when a Google Voice call comes in, you have the ability to accept/reject it from your computer
