2011-04-29T22:05:00.000Z	Augustuen		Is there a way I can have FFmpeg not use as much CPU?
2011-04-29T22:05:00.000Z	Augustuen		it's making my system overheat
2011-04-29T22:05:00.000Z	DasEi	Augustuen	you could alter it's nice
2011-04-29T22:13:00.000Z	DasEi	Augustuen	please ask for pm, I almost have overseen it; with nice you can set how much cpu time a process can access, yes
