2009-11-25T23:47:00.000Z	cba123	Slart	Not even done yet, that is partial, I have another 500gig or so to put back still.  Had to move everything off, then back after destroying it when I moved from an old server to a newer one because a drive kept dropping out, guess it was this same issue though, the one that the firmware upgrade claims to fix.
