2009-07-20T23:30:00.000Z	jonathan__		hello! I want to play an matroska video (.mkv) but it can't be played by vlc nur any other media player. the codec is h264
2009-07-20T23:32:00.000Z	losher	jonathan__	a properly installed mplayer plays pretty much anything I've ever thrown at it. Wanna try that next...?
2009-07-20T23:34:00.000Z	jonathan__	losher	ok i will try. do i have to compile it or should it work to simply install it?
2009-07-20T23:35:00.000Z	losher	jonathan__	simply install it. Especially, look for the additional codec packages.
