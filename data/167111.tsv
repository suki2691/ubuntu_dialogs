2007-02-28T16:00:00.000Z	rmd_	eugman	to see what you have installed, use Synaptic and sort by the installation situation.  to auto-remove things, apt-get autoremove
2007-02-28T16:02:00.000Z	eugman	rmd_	it there a way to be more efficiently like stuff I haven't used in a long time and/or stuff with no dependencies?
2007-02-28T16:02:00.000Z	rmd_	eugman	then just look at what is installed and decide if you need/want it
