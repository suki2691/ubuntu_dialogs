2007-05-06T11:25:00.000Z	rever75		Hi all I have a bunch of WMA on my windows partition that have DRM attached to them. So I am unable to play them in Linux. Is there anyway for stripping out the drm?
2007-05-06T11:26:00.000Z	Lilacor	rever75	that's a good question
2007-05-06T11:26:00.000Z	Lilacor	rever75	there probably is a tool but I don't know if it.
2007-05-06T11:27:00.000Z	rever75	Lilacor	Yeah am thinking of using meEncoder
