2008-11-24T21:50:00.000Z	unavailable	UnknownUser56	if all goes correctly, bootpart will save the boot info from the ubuntu partition, to a file on the c drive, then create an entry in boot.ini  (you must have grub installed on the ubuntu partition NOT THE MBR) FOR THAT TO WORK CORRECTLY
2008-11-24T21:52:00.000Z	unavailable	UnknownUser56	just make sure you have the grub loader installed on the UBUNTU PARTITION before running bootpart
