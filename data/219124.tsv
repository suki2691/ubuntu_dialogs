2005-09-15T15:49:00.000Z	crimsun	mikaoj	it's perfectly feasible. You can put them in ~/.fonts/ for instance
2005-09-15T15:50:00.000Z	crimsun	mikaoj	then rerun ''sudo fc-cache -v -f''
2005-09-15T15:51:00.000Z	mikaoj	crimsun	there aren't any .fonts folder in /home/ubuntu/... isn't that where is it supposed to be?
