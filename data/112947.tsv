2007-12-13T23:28:00.000Z	MasterWitt	coopster	Yeah, I personally hate Vmware. Wine is a jerk most of the time so I don't even bother
2007-12-13T23:29:00.000Z	coopster	MasterWitt	Why do you hate VMWare?  I had to buy a license due to needing something in  a hurry, and it's been pretty good to me after that
2007-12-13T23:29:00.000Z	MasterWitt	coopster	Just to slow. On the other hand, Virtualbox is my savior :P
