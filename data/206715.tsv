2006-09-16T10:04:00.000Z	jeff2		when I run emacs, it quits with Undefined color: "black". I think this has to do with my rgb database (which exists in the RGBPath) being rgb.txt when xgl expects rgb.dir and rgb.pag (dbm files). any ideas?

2006-09-16T10:06:00.000Z	sethk	jeff2	it's not irrelevant, it's just (as I said) that the odds of finding someone here who knows the answer are low
