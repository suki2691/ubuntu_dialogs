2008-03-29T05:21:00.000Z	LZ1		hey, I'm tryng to create partitions in my raid device, but gparted says it is read-only
2008-03-29T05:21:00.000Z	leo_rockw	LZ1	do not mount partitions to use them with gparted
2008-03-29T05:23:00.000Z	LZ1	leo_rockw	it's not mounted
2008-03-29T05:24:00.000Z	leo_rockw	LZ1	ok, that's about the only idea i had, sorry.
