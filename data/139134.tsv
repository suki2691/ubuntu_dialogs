2007-05-13T11:24:00.000Z	linuxbomb	IowaDave	why cant you print?
2007-05-13T11:26:00.000Z	IowaDave	linuxbomb	i was trying to help another guy get gimp to print for him. gimp never even heard of my printer (a brother, which is a company that really supports linux.) otherwise no problems printing from ubuntu. all is well.
