2007-06-09T16:28:00.000Z	Elko		Gday. How can I get a bigger resolution than 1440x900 on my laptop?  It's a GF-7300 and I put bigger modes in xorg.conf, but in the log it always says 'No valid modes for "1680x1050"; removing'.
2007-06-09T16:29:00.000Z	spike_s	Elko	do you have an Accellerated Server built for the GF-7300?
2007-06-09T16:29:00.000Z	spike_s		it sounds like it's removing things you stick in cause it can't map them or something.
2007-06-09T16:30:00.000Z	Elko	spike_s	Do you mean the NV 3-D acceleration? That works, compiz and beryl don't complain there.
