2010-02-06T08:30:00.000Z	j0hndoe		question about docks for ubuntu. im lookin for one that works w/o a composite manager like compiz. i have to disable compiz so i can remote into 9.10 (known bug). so i have to disable it fairly often. i know docky requies this. i think awn does as well. so there are the 2 major/good docks. anyone recommend anything else?

2010-02-06T08:31:00.000Z	j0hndoe		docky is awesome. just cant use it w/o compiz :(
2010-02-06T08:32:00.000Z	xangua	j0hndoe	then activate metacity composite
