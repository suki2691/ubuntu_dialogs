2008-09-11T09:19:00.000Z	ahtmly2k		i'd like to ask a question; in the synaptic, when i'm about to remove a package, there are two options; 1.mark for removal 2.mark for complete removal... what's the difference?
2008-09-11T09:20:00.000Z	ahtmly2k		so if i choose the 1st, there'll be sum junk left... right?
