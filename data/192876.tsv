2006-04-11T15:40:00.000Z	plbgnr		hello, I use ubuntu breezy and have problem with my internet connection; I use wifi card for it with chip rt2400, module rt2400 is loaded and iwconfig (RaConfig - gtk utility for rt2400 too) show that I am "connected", but I can't ping AP. btw, If I run route command, it takes too long to display result... any ideas?

2006-04-11T15:45:00.000Z	rob_p	plbgnr	 Well, I'd double-check your network settings.  You should at least be able to ping the router.  If you can't, make sure your box is configured within the same network segment.
