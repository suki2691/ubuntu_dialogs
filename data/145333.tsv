2010-07-09T23:06:00.000Z	hwilde	Gibbs	what is your monitor native resolution
2010-07-09T23:06:00.000Z	Gibbs	hwilde	- 1440x900
2010-07-09T23:08:00.000Z	hwilde	Gibbs	you will probably have to settle for something like 1024x768 for the tty but basically you need to add vga=791 or something to your grub kernel line see this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=258484&highlight=kernel+booting+parameters
