2008-07-05T04:46:00.000Z	nickrud	kosnick	I've seen cases where the root partition was corrupted, running fsck from a live disk fixed it. Not saying it's that in your case for sure
2008-07-05T04:46:00.000Z	kosnick	nickrud	: ok
2008-07-05T04:47:00.000Z	kosnick	nickrud	: why should i use a live cd to fsck the partition? is it because i am "in" the active partition to do so?
