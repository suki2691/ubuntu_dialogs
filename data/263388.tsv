2004-10-17T05:00:00.000Z	Kamion	bagpuss_	I assume, then, that it isn't just binaries?
2004-10-17T05:01:00.000Z	bagpuss_	Kamion	it's a binary library with an interface that gets compiled against the running kernel I think.  I don't know the details though since it's proprietary
2004-10-17T05:02:00.000Z	Kamion	bagpuss_	that sounds slightly more believable
