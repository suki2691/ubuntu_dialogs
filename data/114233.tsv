2007-11-05T19:56:00.000Z	CaBa\		i am using ubuntu on a macbook and i want to define keys for the infraret remote control. but xev doesnt show keycodes for most of the buttons, but some kind of events. they work find with rhythmplayer, but i dont want to use them as media buttons... what app is responsible for that?

2007-11-05T19:58:00.000Z	CaBa\	MasterShrek	nope
2007-11-05T20:02:00.000Z	CaBa\	MasterShrek	but the keycode business does the trick, thanks
