2011-07-31T22:41:00.000Z	joepa		how do I get windows to appear on an external display in natty/unity? I'm dragging the window to the side of screen0 where screen1 is supposed to start, and instead of appearing on screen1, the window goes into full screen mode on screen0
2011-07-31T22:41:00.000Z	joepa		ideas?

2011-07-31T22:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	joepa	 multi monitor support in unity is a little on the flakey side.  I dont even have a 2nd monitor now to test it out.
