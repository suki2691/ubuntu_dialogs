2012-10-16T12:06:00.000Z	auronandace	mpathy	still considered experimental
2012-10-16T12:19:00.000Z	mpathy	auronandace	Yes but it will be the only file system actively developed in future, there is sure no ext5.. And if it is unstable or not you can ask people and everyone say sth other :)
2012-10-16T12:20:00.000Z	auronandace	mpathy	when it is used by default then it is considered stable (unless explicitly stated otherwise)
