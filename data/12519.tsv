2011-09-04T05:22:00.000Z	X-Hunter		hello
2011-09-04T05:23:00.000Z	X-Hunter		my problem is whenever I try to boot from my usb cd drive with ubuntu live 10.04 in it, the bios freezes
2011-09-04T05:24:00.000Z	X-Hunter		any ideas as to whats happening
2011-09-04T05:26:00.000Z	zykotick9	X-Hunter	if it's actually the BIOS that freezes there's not much anyone here can do.  Do you get anything on the monitor?
