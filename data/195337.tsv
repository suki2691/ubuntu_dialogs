2007-10-27T21:00:00.000Z	Strang3love		I just upgraded a motherboard and processor and am having some issues with grub, can anyone help?
2007-10-27T21:02:00.000Z	Strang3love		after replacing a motherboard and processor, grub starts normally but after making a selection it says "error 21: selected disk does not exist"  any ideas?
2007-10-27T21:03:00.000Z	pdavid	Strang3love	did you get into a boot prompt command in grub?
