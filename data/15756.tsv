2011-05-30T03:05:00.000Z	LAcan	Loshki	qin nothing valuable, im trying to erase everything on it...
2011-05-30T03:09:00.000Z	Loshki	LAcan	Good that there's nothing important on it. Next, I would unmount the disk and see if it fscks cleanly....
2011-05-30T03:09:00.000Z	LAcan	Loshki	not terribly familiar with fscks ...?
