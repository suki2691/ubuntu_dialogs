2006-08-08T12:14:00.000Z	scast	fyrestrtr	i think I didn't express myself well. I mean after installing do I need to run something or just sudo su; su - postgres;createuser myname... ?
2006-08-08T12:16:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	scast	you do need to su postgres then create users (use sudo -i not sudo su). But other than that, no. To control the server, use the init scripts (like any other daemon process). sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql -- will give you all options.
