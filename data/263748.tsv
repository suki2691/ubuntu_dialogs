2005-05-31T10:33:00.000Z	matt_		oh ya...  so xmms is like winamp?  how about xine vs totem?  Totem seems to come with ubuntu
2005-05-31T10:34:00.000Z	sri	matt_	totem is the media player, it can play dvd, music streams, whatever
2005-05-31T10:34:00.000Z	sri	matt_	vcds and all that hoopla..but without all teh complications unlike real's player..which is butt ugly
