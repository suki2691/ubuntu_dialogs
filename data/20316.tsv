2011-01-26T10:27:00.000Z	gobbe	thauriswulfa	do you get error while login? did you try to login from terminal instead of gui?
2011-01-26T10:28:00.000Z	thauriswulfa	gobbe	no errror and can't login also from terminal as i have deleted the user folder i think
2011-01-26T10:28:00.000Z	gobbe	thauriswulfa	then you should boot it in single-user mode and check logs from /var/log to see what else did you change
