2010-05-11T17:09:00.000Z	JuJuBee		Need some assistance with grub2 .  After install, my boot menu had all of my partitions/os's listed including older kernels...  How do I get rid of older kernels  in the boot menu and how do I change the names to a more friendly name if I am not supposed to edit the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file?

2010-05-11T17:14:00.000Z	JuJuBee	arand_	 never removed old headers etc... how do I go about that?
2010-05-11T17:15:00.000Z	JuJuBee	arand_	 so I don't want to add to what is there, just change the names... am I out of luck?
