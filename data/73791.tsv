2010-01-14T08:03:00.000Z	abojuser		ive recently exerienced ubuntu is getting slower. Karmic was fine until two upgrades ago. Trying xubuntu now. But it feels slow too. Thinking of switching to debian because of this. Anyone noticed something similar?

2010-01-14T08:09:00.000Z	blakkheim	abojuser	yeah, i'd do a minimal install or a debian netinstall
2010-01-14T08:09:00.000Z	blakkheim	abojuser	you should also look into using a window manager with no desktop environment
