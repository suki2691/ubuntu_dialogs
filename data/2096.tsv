2012-07-07T15:52:00.000Z	alfabravo		I know it's a little bit off topic, but I'm in my friends house and they wanted me to upgrade ubuntu. So I did and so I upgraded Thunderbird also. The problem is that they need it in German. I found some packages, but they doesn't seem to work. I don't want to take any risks here, so my question is: if I remove Thunderbird and install it again from the german site, will all accounts and content remain? Anyone tried this before?

I will back it up anyway, but as soon as I install german version, I will have no idea how to restore the data, because I don't speak german....
