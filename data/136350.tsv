2008-03-28T05:39:00.000Z	frank23	demonspork	no. windows binaries are x86
2008-03-28T05:40:00.000Z	demonspork	frank23	is there a good way to emulate windows binaries in a ppc environment?
2008-03-28T05:41:00.000Z	frank23	demonspork	I have no idea.... performance would probably be terrible even if you could
