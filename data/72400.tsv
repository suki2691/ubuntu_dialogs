2008-12-01T16:12:00.000Z	e911		It seems to work fine here with 256 MB
2008-12-01T16:12:00.000Z	ziroday	e911	yes, however the alternate cd needs less
2008-12-01T16:14:00.000Z	e911	ziroday	as u said, works here with 256MB (in save graphics mode). Is there anything bad going to happen if i'm going to use it to copy one hdd to antoher?
