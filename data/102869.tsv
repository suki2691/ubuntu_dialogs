2008-01-23T15:21:00.000Z	CosmicBat		umount /dev/sda1 doesn't work (?) (sda1 is my root partition)
2008-01-23T15:22:00.000Z	icesword	CosmicBat	you cannot umount / ,when system is still running
2008-01-23T15:25:00.000Z	CosmicBat	icesword	okay cheers :) but I can remount it it seems, 'cause I just did 'mount -fr -o remount / ' and 'mount' now tells me / is ro, and I can run fsck
