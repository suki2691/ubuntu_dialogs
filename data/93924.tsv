2008-04-28T15:59:00.000Z	norbi		Hello, every time during boot, I get an error message along the lines of "kinit: no resume image, doing normal boot".  Is this something I should be worried about?  I have no problems with the installation, everything works, just kind of an annoying message.

2008-04-28T16:01:00.000Z	norbi	Fritzel	very well, makes sense :) Thank you
