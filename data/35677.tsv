2012-10-21T18:11:00.000Z	Baribal		Hi. I'm trying to extract a tar file, and the FS doesn't seem to like some file names: Cannot open: Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide character
2012-10-21T18:11:00.000Z	Baribal		Is there an easy fix? And if there isn't, what'd be a good regex to match those characters?
2012-10-21T18:11:00.000Z	lasher	Baribal	tried redownloading the file?
2012-10-21T18:12:00.000Z	Baribal	lasher	it's not a download, and file corruption isn't the problem.
