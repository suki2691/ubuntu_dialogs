2005-04-27T08:39:00.000Z	Phr0stByte		OK - I never noticed anything that was not stable anyway - just wondering why I dont ever see the update icon anymore...
2005-04-27T08:40:00.000Z	SeamusLT	Phr0stByte	 There will be updates, just not very many...
2005-04-27T08:40:00.000Z	SeamusLT	Phr0stByte	 There's been a feature freeze  in main/restricted.  I'm not sure how universe works though.
