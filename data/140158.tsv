2007-09-06T12:53:00.000Z	Metal03		Hello everyone, I'm having an issue trying to start World of Warcraft.  I just reinstalled Ubuntu and Wine (newest version) and when I try to start WoW I get "err:wgl:X11DRV_wglGetProcAddress No libGL on this box - disabling OpenGL support" repeatadly and then "err:d3d:WineD3D_CreateFakeGLContext Can't find a suitable iPixelFormat" and that's where it freezes...  Any ideas?
