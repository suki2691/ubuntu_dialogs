2010-10-24T12:14:00.000Z	malachai		I agree with Guest34533, Linux is nice, but not for what Im trying to use it for. I want to play games and watch movies and shit. Not write programs and whatever else. Windows is a much better OS for what I want. No offense to Linux at all.

2010-10-24T12:16:00.000Z	Bert-	malachai	I do the same ... Except for some games, unfortunately working only on windows. And that not because of linux, but dev just coding for D3D :)
