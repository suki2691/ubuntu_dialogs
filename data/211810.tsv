2005-10-18T15:12:00.000Z	lampshade	karjala	 I would say they say it is more targeted for desktop users for the little things like automount, etc.  I mean Debian can do that, but Ubuntu does it automatically
2005-10-18T15:13:00.000Z	karjala	lampshade	so it's not worse than debian as a server?
2005-10-18T15:14:00.000Z	lampshade	karjala	 Telly you the truth I've never used it as a server... but I'm not a hardcore serverer so you might be talking to the wrong guy for details on it.  Like I said it just seems like they made it to be a nice desktop experience for desktop users.  Warm brown colors, OpenOffice and other things ready to go, etc
