2008-04-07T11:32:00.000Z	unop__	Sheff	in the accepted definition of a 'shell', kde and gnome do not fit that description .. but since they allow the user to interact with the system they can be thought of as shells .. but the proper term for them would be Desktop Environments (as they encompass a lot of 'shells')

2008-04-07T11:36:00.000Z	unop__	Sheff	i believe gnome uses metacity as it's window manager, it is a program yes
