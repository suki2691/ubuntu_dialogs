2008-04-06T10:54:00.000Z	tuntun		New question for yall (amule channel is totally dead). My 'mule only connects when I have my modem firewall turned off. Even though I have specified the port-forwarding and firewall rules to allow the ftp.udp connections. Whats Is wrong with it? I prefer having my hardware firewall on ;)

2008-04-06T10:56:00.000Z	tuntun	hhMish_	well, that's not really any help! (and I have a decent modem anyway)
