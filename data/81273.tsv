2009-07-11T18:54:00.000Z	Fazer2		hey, almost all Qt packages in Jaunty are in 4.5.0 version, but there already is 4.5.2
2009-07-11T18:54:00.000Z	Fazer2		is it possible to have 4.5.2 in official repository?
2009-07-11T18:56:00.000Z	geirha	Fazer2	No. If 4.5.0 is the version in Ubuntu 9.04, then that will never change.
2009-07-11T18:56:00.000Z	Fazer2	geirha	but 4.5.2 fixes bugs found in 4.5.0, it could be backported to Jaunty
