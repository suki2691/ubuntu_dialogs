2007-11-05T23:02:00.000Z	xplatinum		Is there a program that can work with RAR volumes ? can file-roller do it with the proper "plugin" ?
2007-11-05T23:03:00.000Z	xplatinum		one with a GUI hehe
2007-11-05T23:05:00.000Z	xplatinum		just searched for unrar in synaptic -- will unrar-free work the same as unrar ?
2007-11-05T23:05:00.000Z	leo_away	xplatinum	i'm using the free one and didn't see any difference yet
