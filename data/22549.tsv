2010-11-23T10:17:00.000Z	_ahaz_		datz: whil trying to reinstall ubuntu, I formatted an XP partition accidentally. The installed did not complete.
2010-11-23T10:18:00.000Z	lockersnatch	_ahaz_	if the install continued to install onto partition that was formatted, the data is prob already gone
2010-11-23T10:18:00.000Z	lockersnatch	_ahaz_	it is retrievable until it gets written over again
