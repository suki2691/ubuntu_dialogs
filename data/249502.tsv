2006-04-07T08:02:00.000Z	AstralJava	folki	There must be better ways, but I just type echo $PATH, then type 'export PATH=____' and cut&paste what I want as new PATH.
2006-04-07T08:03:00.000Z	AstralJava	folki	Sorry that was a poor explanation, new PATH value goes to that underline part. So I cut&paste the values I want after the equal sign.
