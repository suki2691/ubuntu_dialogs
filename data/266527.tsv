2010-12-29T07:14:00.000Z	woodzy		is there a way to clear out a users' configuration files either for gnome, kde, xfce, or any apps?
2010-12-29T07:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	woodzy	 all user  config files are in varioys .SOMTHING dirs in their home. so yes its possible to clear them out
2010-12-29T07:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	woodzy	 ubuntu-tweak has a feature to reset gnome settings back to default. You could also just manually delete the different .whatever dirs/files
