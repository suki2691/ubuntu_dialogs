2005-11-25T14:08:00.000Z	vbgunz		anybody here use devilspie? I just started using it and love it! I have a question though... As I am testing the script I enter "killall devilspie" then to restart it and test a new config "devilspie &"... The only problem is, when I close out the terminal, I seem to also shutdown devilspie... How to make it persistant?
