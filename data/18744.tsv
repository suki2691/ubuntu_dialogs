If you have a really hard time with it, you can email me at online@wadechandler.com and be sure and attach your logs. I might be able to help. No promises...deps on what is in the logs.

On a laptop or desktop ... at least for this programmer ... it is less productive because of the whole left side of the screen biz and application window switching is a pain...i.e. I'm in one app and want to go to another app and a specific window...using only the mouse.
2012-04-30T16:18:00.000Z	wadechandler		Other than that though I would love unity I think
2012-04-30T16:18:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	wadechandler	 i don't like/use Unity either
