2011-11-05T11:16:00.000Z	zjo		I'm new user to ubuntu running it on virtual box. I'm trying to install a piece of software. I downloaded the .gz file from the website, put it in a folder, then from terminal, I cd'd to that folder I saved the file in, gunzip'd it, then I type 'make' and I get: Fatal error X11/Xlib.h no such file found
