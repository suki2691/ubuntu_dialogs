2006-05-18T05:47:00.000Z	Falluccer		I have a few questions because I'm new to linux, and ubuntu. Is the desktop near the same as Windows
2006-05-18T05:48:00.000Z	_jason	Falluccer	you should give the livecd a try, so you can give it a test run before you install it on your hard drive
2006-05-18T05:53:00.000Z	_jason	Falluccer	no, ubuntu is its own operating system.  It doesn't run through dos
2006-05-18T05:54:00.000Z	_jason	Falluccer	you just pop in the install cd and reboot, it will boot from the cd and you install from there
