2011-02-13T18:01:00.000Z	dagnytaggart		Greetings. I am looking for some assistance in writing inputs from the command line. In particular, I can run '"gpg" [Press Enter]. Program then responds with "Enter input", I enter input, then press "Ctrl-D" - program then closes and outputs the result I want to stdout. This is the behavior I am looking for, just without the human input - need to condense it down to one statement entered on the command line. Thoughts?
