2007-06-29T14:03:00.000Z	Sepero	shiester_miester	This line didn't look very bot-ish: ubotu can you tell zachinglis to go to #ubuntu-ofttopic or shut up please?
2007-06-29T14:24:00.000Z	shiester_miester	Sepero	it would be a good idea to read a word in context with the other words around it
2007-06-29T14:24:00.000Z	Sepero	shiester_miester	I wasn't directing that at anyone. I was just curious what ubotu had to say about it. :)
