2006-11-02T13:18:00.000Z	troopa		Why are people on the ubuntu forums complaining so much about the security in Ubuntu? I have seen some posts saying "There is no firewall by default", but Ubuntu uses IPTables. Do they just think firestarter is the actual firewall?
2006-11-02T13:19:00.000Z	Madpilot	troopa	yes, probably. There are also no open/active ports by default, so little need for a full firewall
2006-11-02T13:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	troopa	because they're used to having to install a whole raft of "security' apps in Windows, and don't realize they're all unneeded in *nix?
2006-11-02T13:23:00.000Z	troopa	Madpilot	True. I am a very paranoid person (and I love security-based things) so I always apply the GRSec patch to any Linux distribution I use. Maybe ubuntu could come default with the GRSec patch or something, since users want better security.
