2011-09-29T00:54:00.000Z	RobbieCrash		I have a promise 'raid' card that I'm using as an additional SATA controller, the drives which are attached to it are part of a ZFS pool. At reboot, these devices are normally initialized as /dev/sd[e-h]. However, sometimes they're initialized before the disks attached directly to my motherboard, which causes the ZFS pool to think that they've failed, and it then fails to mount the pool. How
2011-09-29T00:54:00.000Z	RobbieCrash		can I make sure that the devices are always initialized in the same order at boot?
