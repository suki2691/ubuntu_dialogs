2007-08-20T07:44:00.000Z	miturburu	jfdbmi	the problem is that you instaled amaya
2007-08-20T07:46:00.000Z	miturburu	jfdbmi	why do you want it? it is a lame browser
2007-08-20T07:47:00.000Z	miturburu	jfdbmi	not handy, I tried it myself, just use nvu, although its buggier than amaya it will be more handy, I use gedit only for webpages
