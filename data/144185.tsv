2007-03-19T06:48:00.000Z	subMacrolize		Hi everyone, I've got a problem with editing files. I suspect that the solution will be very simple. Will anyone help me?
2007-03-19T06:49:00.000Z	subMacrolize		I'm running edgy. I don't have proper permissions to edit files on "file system".
2007-03-19T06:49:00.000Z	subMacrolize		How do I acquire these permissions?
