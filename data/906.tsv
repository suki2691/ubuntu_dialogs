2012-10-03T15:56:00.000Z	Kittens		how would I reconnect a device via terminal?
2012-10-03T15:57:00.000Z	muelli	Kittens	bluetooth? I guess hcitool
2012-10-03T15:58:00.000Z	muelli	Kittens	USB? I don't think you can. Except unloading the driver.
2012-10-03T16:02:00.000Z	Kittens	muelli	okay, so hcitool echos back hci0 <mac address of controller> but the bluetooth devices panel keeps disconnecting and reconnecting the device (or so it seems) any idea why that would be?
