2009-12-19T23:13:00.000Z	Surlent777	frankely	by opening it, correcting any weird artifacts, and then I think it works pretty much as you'd expect
2009-12-19T23:14:00.000Z	Surlent777	frankely	I think when you save in PP07 you need to use something other than the default save format, come to think of it =/
2009-12-19T23:15:00.000Z	Surlent777	frankely	Yes, that could be an issue...I'd suggest scouring google to see if anyone else knows what to do =/
