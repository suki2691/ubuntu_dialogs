2010-01-17T05:17:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	iflema	I cannot remember it's been so long. It's been perhaps 6 months since I have booted into Linux.
2010-01-17T05:18:00.000Z	iflema	SealedWithAKiss	are you on this computer now?
2010-01-17T05:19:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	iflema	I'm in Linux now in low graphics mode.
