2007-07-09T07:40:00.000Z	sdquinn		I've been using Ubuntu on my desktop for the past week or so -- when my MacBook was in for service. I love Ubuntu but I can never see me installing it on my laptop over Mac OS X. But I want to stay involved. I don't want to dual boot, so do you think I should just leave it on my desktop and mess around with it on here?

2007-07-09T07:42:00.000Z	sdquinn	newtron	this laptop was the ruin of my Linux last time. I was running it on a desktop for a while and was quite involved with ubuntu-doc, so why not?
