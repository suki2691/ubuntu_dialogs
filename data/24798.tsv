2010-10-08T01:16:00.000Z	Eltu		Hello - I have a problem that I hope someone here knows how to fix. It started today. When I open files in any file open dialog (for instance, when I try to upload images to imageshack) - I am having a very hard time selecting the file I want. Often, a COMPLETELY different file gets selected instead, once I press OK.
