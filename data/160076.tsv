2009-04-26T17:13:00.000Z	BlueEagle		Ok, so I have ubuntu 9.04 installed and all seems to be working except for one little detail. I cannot fathom how to automatically initialize dmraid so that I can mount (fake-)raid partitions from fstab. Where would I go to have dmraid -ay execute before fstab is being processed?

2009-04-26T17:16:00.000Z	traskbt	BlueEagle	in case I can't go back once I upgrade, is there a way to say "upgrade everything from 8.10 to 9.04 EXCEPT the kernel"?
2009-04-26T17:16:00.000Z	BlueEagle	traskbt	I do not know.
