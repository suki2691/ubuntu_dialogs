2011-07-22T16:32:00.000Z	wonderworld		hi i am looking for a tool that can resize batches of images graphically (frontend for imagemagick or something like that)
2011-07-22T16:33:00.000Z	kitche	wonderworld	why not just use imagemagick considering that it is a gui program also
2011-07-22T16:34:00.000Z	wonderworld	kitche	is it, whats the name of the imagemagick gui?
2011-07-22T16:45:00.000Z	kitche	wonderworld	sorry about that try display to see if that works
