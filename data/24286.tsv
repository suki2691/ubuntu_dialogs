2011-02-01T03:31:00.000Z	CaneToad		does anybody know of some network hardware that actually reliably works in linux?  I have Intel Pro/Wireless 4965 and after a period of use, it just magically stops working.... and I have realtek RTL8111/8168B ethernet hardware and it randomly stops working too.  And they stop working at different times.  I've never had them both stop working at the same time.  Honestly Ubuntu 10.10 needs rebooting more than win 95.
2011-02-01T03:32:00.000Z	KM0201	CaneToad	i'd suspect some sort of hardware issue.. cuz i have that same realtek device, and it never has caused me a problem
2011-02-01T03:32:00.000Z	CaneToad	KM0201	works perfectly under win (??????)
