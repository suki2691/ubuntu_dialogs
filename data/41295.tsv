2009-12-07T13:04:00.000Z	a2f		after running aptitude build-dep i'm seeing a bunch of packages with {a} next to their names. what does that mean?
2009-12-07T13:06:00.000Z	coz_	a2f	 well I am going to assume...since I never run aptitude, that those are the dependecies you asked for
2009-12-07T13:07:00.000Z	a2f	coz_	right but some packages do not have {a} next to their names
2009-12-07T13:07:00.000Z	coz_	a2f	 mm  then I am not sure   I generally just do  sudo apt-get build-dep  nameofpacakge
