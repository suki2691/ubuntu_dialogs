2012-09-03T22:15:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	emph	no nproblem but your question makes no sense it is lacking any real substance.
2012-09-03T22:18:00.000Z	emph	wilee-nilee	There's no "bad cause and effect", using Windows I was able to watch movies with ease, now I can't, therefore it's not my hardware but rather my software.
