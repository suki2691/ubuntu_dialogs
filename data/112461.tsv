2009-01-31T17:10:00.000Z	linduxed		i need to change the inode size of my ext3 partition. since i know (after extensive googling) that the only way to do that is formatting the partition, i need to know how to back up my current system in such a way that everything is preserved exactly as it is now. some kind of disk clone. is that doable?
