2009-11-19T01:58:00.000Z	kurt__		I am trying to setup a FTP server, on /winshare I am unable to connect to it on LAN or over the net. I used the the guide on the ubuntu forums but I dont get what I'm doing wrong.. I've tried vsftpd and am currently trying proftpd..
2009-11-19T01:59:00.000Z	mMezquitale	kurt__	why are you using ftp?  why dont you install an ssh server instead?
2009-11-19T02:01:00.000Z	mMezquitale	kurt__	 ftp is insecure I will rather use ssh which I use, it≈õ safer and easy to setup, I cant help you with the ftp setup but I can help you figure out why you cant connect from the outside, can you connect to your ftp server locally?
