2010-02-08T09:51:00.000Z	oniltonmaciel		I recently bought a toshiba a505 s-6005. it has a core i3 processor, and integrated intel graphics media accelerator 4500hd, 4gb ddr3 ram. When I try to install ubuntu from live cd it shows me a black screen, like it was running but not showing video
2010-02-08T09:53:00.000Z	oniltonmaciel		I tried ubuntu 9.10 32 and 64 bits , and ubuntu 9.04 32bits. Any idas? What it is?
2010-02-08T09:54:00.000Z	oniltonmaciel		I searched a lot but couldn't find anything concrete about this issue I got when installing ubuntu from live cd
2010-02-08T09:54:00.000Z	`mOOse`	oniltonmaciel	have you tried to right-click on the desktop and get the settings menu up?
