2008-01-21T05:34:00.000Z	reese-015		quick question guys, just out of curiosity, I just got into Ubuntu7.10 and am wondering why some programs (for example synaptic) don't react to most gtk themes I install and have a dull grey look?
2008-01-21T05:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	reese-015	 the apps ran as root. use the root users theme settings.
2008-01-21T05:35:00.000Z	reese-015	Dr_willis	but *some* themes do apply to them (like the Human default theme, if I take another theme though, Synaptic becomes dull and grey)
2008-01-21T05:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	reese-015	 could be they are gtk apps not totally gnome apps.
