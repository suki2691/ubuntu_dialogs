2009-09-11T09:13:00.000Z	scoates		for whatever reason, when I connect to 127.0.0.1, it's not connecting FROM 127.0.0.1 but from my default public IP. Can someone point me in the right direction to fix this?

2009-09-11T09:15:00.000Z	scoates	biovore	before I did whatever I did today, when I connected to 127.0.0.1, the connections would come from 127.0.0.1, not 64.x.y.z
