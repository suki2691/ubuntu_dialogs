2009-01-10T05:19:00.000Z	marabout	owh	thanks as I have a house full of children and am looking to set up ubuntu on a number of machines in the near future...
2009-01-10T05:23:00.000Z	owh	marabout	I'm guessing that was for me, no recommendations, the list is too variable. I get bitten regularly and I've been at this caper for 27 years :) Buy from a place where you're allowed to test or return if it doesn't work. Laptops are worst.
2009-01-10T05:26:00.000Z	marabout	owh	 yes sorry about the misspell.  that's good info on the laptops Thanks. I was planning to search some thrift stores for the computers so the return issue is kind of out but I will keep my ears open for which machines are better candidates. Thanks again
