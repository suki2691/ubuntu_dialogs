2009-01-11T11:27:00.000Z	YANP		I have a problem.  I am trying to install Ubuntu 8.04 on my machine and when I try to install it, it says I/O Error Reading Disk and when I try to try ubuntu without installing it on my machine...it gives me pages of errors.  What is the problem?  I am using the CD they sent me...

2009-01-11T11:29:00.000Z	DarkSotM_	YANP	does it have a check cd contents option or something similar?
2009-01-11T11:30:00.000Z	DarkSotM_	YANP	try that and see what it says
