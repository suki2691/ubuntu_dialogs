2009-01-30T06:08:00.000Z	Joeseph		I can no longer access any of my windows share drives via smb.... any help?
2009-01-30T06:09:00.000Z	faust7	Joeseph	when you go Places, Network, are you able to see your workgroup ? and are you able to see the other computer as well?
2009-01-30T06:10:00.000Z	Joeseph	faust7	I can see my workgroup, but no other  computers.... but it has always been like that.
