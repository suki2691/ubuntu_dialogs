2007-01-18T15:38:00.000Z	beniamino		hi there. i have edgy installed. it boots to the desktop, no problem. but if i hit ctrl-alt-f1 to go to a console, then ctrl-alt-f7 to go back to the desktop, i just get a beige that flashes to white and back to beige constantly. anyone know what this is?
2007-01-18T15:39:00.000Z	SilentDis	beniamino	are you running beryl?  i noticed my x session moved over to either F8 or F9, depending on if  i'd restarted it or not
2007-01-18T15:40:00.000Z	beniamino	SilentDis	i haven't turned on beryl intentionally, is it part of the default install?
2007-01-18T15:41:00.000Z	SilentDis	beniamino	no, it's not (totally seperate set of packages)
