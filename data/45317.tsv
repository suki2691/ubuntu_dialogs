2009-11-30T23:53:00.000Z	``Cube		i'm trying to find a way to access my evolution mail from command line. is there any frontend like that?
2009-11-30T23:55:00.000Z	dAlfa89_	``Cube	there's a command-line email application called Mutt, don't know if that's any good for you
2009-11-30T23:56:00.000Z	``Cube	dAlfa89_	yeah i heard about it, and i assume that i could go command-line only, but i'd like to stay with the actual evolution being used in the background just in case i need it once, but for daily use use a command line interface
