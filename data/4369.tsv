2012-04-16T17:01:00.000Z	yzhd		I'm trying to sync cm7 source. I'm following this guide: http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/HTC_Desire_(GSM):_Compile_CyanogenMod_(Linux)  -----      but when I type in the git core command, I get this error: E: Package 'sun-java6-jdk' has no installation candidate. I read that it was removed because of license issues? Any suggestions on what I can do? Thanks.

2012-04-16T17:02:00.000Z	yzhd	chriswk	sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk ?
