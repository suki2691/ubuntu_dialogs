2010-06-21T00:35:00.000Z	lfs		Hey, would any of you know if there is a way to get the bootsplash from 9.10 back in 10.4? I've been searching, and searching, google, ubuntu forums, etc. but to no avail.

2010-06-21T00:42:00.000Z	arand_	lfs	Likely, but likely it's not worth the effort and instability it would resut in, I have no idea how, either (btw the term is boot splash if you are going to be googling...)
2010-06-21T00:44:00.000Z	lfs	arand_	thanks :) I'll stay on the google
