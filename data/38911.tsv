2011-05-01T20:12:00.000Z	iandi	Omega	no this started to occur after the installation of xbmc 11.04
2011-05-01T20:14:00.000Z	Omega	iandi	Try choosing ubuntu classic at login and try it there, if it works there it's a unity bug and should be reported
2011-05-01T20:16:00.000Z	iandi	Omega	it works in classic mode (2d) not in Unity mode.. Pure fullscreen works but not windowed fullscreen, its like there's a hidden border at the bottom of the screen preventing it
