2007-09-02T09:16:00.000Z	majnoon		i can't run gnome or xfce it looks like a dbus problem
2007-09-02T09:17:00.000Z	bruenig	majnoon	dbus is not absolutely necessary
2007-09-02T09:21:00.000Z	majnoon	bruenig	 xfce say can not find net address (or similar) and gnome says something like  "message bus security policy"
2007-09-02T09:21:00.000Z	bruenig	majnoon	I have run xfce before without using dbus with no problem, perhaps this is a works for me situation and generally you need dbus or will encounter problems so I can't really help you there
