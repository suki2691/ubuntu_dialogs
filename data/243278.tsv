2011-04-19T10:12:00.000Z	finn0000		I installed ubuntu minimal and got all the packages I need for gnome (then used the PPA to get gnome3), but my notifications look like the old, ugly ones from pre 10.10 (or was it 10.04). Is there a package or something to get the newer notifications
2011-04-19T10:14:00.000Z	finn0000		yeah i installed natty minimal
2011-04-19T10:15:00.000Z	finn0000		and it has the old fashion notifications
2011-04-19T10:15:00.000Z	MaRk-I	finn0000	for natty ask in #ubuntu+1
