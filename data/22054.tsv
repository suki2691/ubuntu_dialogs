2011-01-02T20:21:00.000Z	tei		Hello all... I installed ubuntu on my mac and it was working fine, but now when I try to boot, all I get is a dark screen and blinking cursor
2011-01-02T20:22:00.000Z	tei		Can someone help?
2011-01-02T20:22:00.000Z	rs0832	tei	do you have dual boot?
2011-01-02T20:29:00.000Z	rs0832	tei	did you try disabling some of the boot options?
