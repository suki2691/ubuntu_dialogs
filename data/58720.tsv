2010-03-04T15:35:00.000Z	SpenserJ		Does anyone have some tips on getting all of the buttons on a logitech S530 (detected as an s510) mouse (keyboard mostly works) to work properly? Using 10.04 A3, however I am fairly sure its an issue with all versions, as I have yet to find any substantial information on how to make it work

2010-03-04T15:37:00.000Z	SpenserJ	Haffe	I am looking for something that makes it work in Ubuntu :P Sorry, guess 10.04 might be fairly easily confused with OS X
