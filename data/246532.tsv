2008-04-20T10:36:00.000Z	jdrake		Is there a real small ubuntu image I can use to fix a problem? I need something as small as possible (512kbps connection), and the alternate, desktop and server images are all too big.

2008-04-20T10:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jdrake	 dsl = 50mb.  if thers any smaller - i dont know of them
2008-04-20T10:40:00.000Z	jdrake	Dr_willis	looks good
