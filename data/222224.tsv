2006-03-19T15:10:00.000Z	MistaED		hey just wondering with dapper drake, will there be a really good frontend/program for xorg configuration?
2006-03-19T15:11:00.000Z	intelikey	MistaED	if by good frontend  you mean gui,  no.  how can you configure x from within x  cause most people needing to config x cant get x to start.....
2006-03-19T16:29:00.000Z	MistaED	intelikey	what kind of x? xorg?
2006-03-19T16:31:00.000Z	intelikey	MistaED	 yeah default hoary,  nothing special except the package list.  i could almost post it in here without getting kicked.
