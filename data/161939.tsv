2009-05-01T15:44:00.000Z	boss		im having some problems with "make"... i've installed ubuntu from scratch from the command line, but i take it i've missed something out
2009-05-01T15:45:00.000Z	boss		make: *** /lib/modules/2.6.28-11-generic/build: No such file or directory. Stop.
2009-05-01T15:46:00.000Z	ikonia	boss	make the directory
2009-05-01T15:48:00.000Z	boss	ikonia	fair enough i thought "build" was an app for some reason
