2008-08-19T18:07:00.000Z	Cripps	_Zeus_	I've got a goatload of stuff running. I'm trying to get Amarok to play music for me, but xine complains that the sound device is in use. I tried with mplayer as well, same result.
2008-08-19T18:08:00.000Z	Cripps	_Zeus_	if it helps, I know that a restart will solve the problem I'm having, but "/etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart" doesn't.
