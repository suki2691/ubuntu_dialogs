2008-06-14T07:57:00.000Z	avis		hmm.  i've switched icon sets to something i know had a gnome firefox icon, and purged and reinstalled firefox 3.0, though the default firefox icon did not appear.  i'm not sure what i should do.

2008-06-14T07:58:00.000Z	erin	avis	go find one on google, then put it in /usr/share/pixmaps then change the icon the usual way
