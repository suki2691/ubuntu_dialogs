2010-01-28T20:25:00.000Z	Yoshio	arand	nope
2010-01-28T20:28:00.000Z	arand	Yoshio	Yes, I've experienced very sluggish FF if I keep the profile on a usb stick as opposed to on the HD, which makes a tremendous difference, so poor disk performance is definitely a possible cause. If that is the problem in question, no idea..
