2005-09-27T12:07:00.000Z	mirak		there is really no performance gain with ubuntu amd64 ?
2005-09-27T12:07:00.000Z	Answer2	mirak	if you use programs that specifically take advantage of 64bit architecture you will see a performance gain
2005-09-27T12:09:00.000Z	Answer2	mirak	you can probably learn more by searching on google about reasons to upgrade to 64bit
