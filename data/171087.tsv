2007-04-08T13:40:00.000Z	eternal_p		good afternoon all...quick question, is there a firewall free vnc server (like logmein or gotomypc) for linux/ubuntu?
2007-04-08T13:42:00.000Z	eternal_p		like logmein  where I don't have to do any port forwarding before hand
2007-04-08T13:42:00.000Z	eternal_p		so I can support ubuntu machines easily
