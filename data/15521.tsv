2011-06-15T20:43:00.000Z	GilAz		hmm... i want to copy a large folder from a defected hard disk to a working one. if i use the gui to do so it prompts me every now and then about a problem with a file, and asks me weather i want to skip, cancel, or retry. i choose "skip" every time. is there a way to use the cp (or any other cmd) so that it will copy the whole thing, skip when theres dbout, and allow me to let it work without
