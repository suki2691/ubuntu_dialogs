2012-11-19T08:24:00.000Z	p7ank5te7		Hey, I was wondering what way I could calculate the free memory on my computer from command line? I know if I do "cat /proc/meminfo" it tells me I have about 134mb free, but if I run htop, it shows that I have 7059mb free. Is there a way to get the correct reading?

2012-11-19T08:25:00.000Z	p7ank5te7	usr13	when I do that, it's the same as meminfo.
