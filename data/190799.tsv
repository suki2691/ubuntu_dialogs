2009-07-16T08:51:00.000Z	Ratapoil		I need to reinstall OS but I have a Dell linux-preinstalled that doesn't have a separate /home partition. I have way too much data I need to keep. someone told me, resize your partition. but GParted says partition cannot be unmounted. What's the procedure? need to boot from a liveCD?
2009-07-16T08:52:00.000Z	Ratapoil		is there an ubuntu liveCD?
2009-07-16T08:53:00.000Z	Ratapoil		can you boot live with the regular DesktopEdition?
