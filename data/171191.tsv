2008-10-12T21:06:00.000Z	Xsss4hell		Hi! I've just installed Ubuntu 8.04.1 from netinstall. HOWTO update gnome and nautilus to the latest version?
2008-10-12T21:07:00.000Z	Xsss4hell		I want gnome2.24 and I have Version: 2.22.3
2008-10-12T21:08:00.000Z	Xsss4hell		I know that using intrepid in the sources.list could update it to the latest version, but it also changes many many many other things.. I do not want a dependancy problem. So Is there a howto??
