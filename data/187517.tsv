2009-10-01T00:22:00.000Z	southern_		i am dual booting ubuntu and windows 7. every time i boot up windows 7 after using ubuntu, the time is like 4 hours off. does anyone know whats going on?
2009-10-01T00:23:00.000Z	ikonia	southern_	sounds like windows is not syncing the time
2009-10-01T00:24:00.000Z	ikonia	southern_	when you boot ubuntu does it have the right time ?
2009-10-01T00:26:00.000Z	ikonia	southern_	then it looks like windows is not syncing time when it boots up
