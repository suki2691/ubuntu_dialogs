2010-12-21T00:44:00.000Z	rumpe1	developerhealey	for suspend-to-disk or if your RAM isn't enough
2010-12-21T00:44:00.000Z	developerhealey	rumpe1	  i didnt add one to my server...  has 4gb of ram and 2  one TB harddrives
2010-12-21T00:45:00.000Z	rumpe1	developerhealey	then you don't need one ... or you could always add swap-files, if you ever need them
