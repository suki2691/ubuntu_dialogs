2009-12-28T03:47:00.000Z	sda		Another question! When I start synaptic or something need sudo pw a nice windows popups. Can I use this windows for my script?
2009-12-28T03:47:00.000Z	LjL	sda	that's "gksudo", isn't it?
2009-12-28T03:50:00.000Z	LjL	sda	try "gksudo programname"
2009-12-28T03:54:00.000Z	LjL	sda	the command looks correct to me though.
