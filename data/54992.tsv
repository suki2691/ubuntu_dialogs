2009-07-29T03:40:00.000Z	Forza4Life		i have a slight issue   i have an ATI all in wonder video card that i have just installed, it runs dual monitors..the install of the ati restricted driver went ok, as far as i can tell, but when i try to go to system>prefs>display, the display windows that should pop up letting me configure the monitors does not open or freezes up, right now the card seems to be working fine, but im running the monitors in clone mode and would like an extended desktop
