2009-02-04T20:35:00.000Z	TheBase		hello.
2009-02-04T20:37:00.000Z	TheBase		I'm running gutsy and the a library called libnl-dev. Gutsy only has the 1.0 but I need the 1.1 which is only available on the distro above Gutsy. I can't just install another distro. Is there anything that I can do about it?
2009-02-04T20:38:00.000Z	jrib	TheBase	gutsy is only supported for 2 more months anyway, so you might as well update
2009-07-15T21:41:00.000Z	jrib	TheBase	meld, kdiff, vimdiff....
