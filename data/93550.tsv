2008-07-22T20:51:00.000Z	carl		For those of you who work in the IT Department of your respective companies, I was wondering what software you use to manage your hardware(whats in each machine/etc)?

This allows us to control each class of machines separately. The closest thing we use to an accounting system for them though is the records of what MAC addresses are currently on the control lists for each of them, and location queries over SNMP (etc controlled by cfengine).

Not particularly robust if you have many different kinds of systems (i.e. if most systems would be a different class) but in our environment, and many others, people have only 5 or 6 kinds of computers, and just mass numbers of them.
