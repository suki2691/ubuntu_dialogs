2007-01-24T17:36:00.000Z	Recon69		I got a problem, I need to have the nvidia dev headers for OpenGL available for a program i am using, but when I use synaptic to install them it conflicts with the manually installed drivers I have and gnome stops working. any suggestions?

2007-01-24T17:37:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Recon69	instructions are on nvidia's site
2007-01-24T17:38:00.000Z	Recon69	gnomefreak	thx, I will give that a go :)
