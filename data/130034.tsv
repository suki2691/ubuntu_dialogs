2007-06-21T13:07:00.000Z	Ethan		I have installed Ubuntu since more than two years and I would like to install windows too (yes :$ ),
2007-06-21T13:07:00.000Z	Ethan		Is there now a way to change the partition size ? :$
2007-06-21T13:07:00.000Z	Aggort_	Ethan	Without losing file.... more than likely no
