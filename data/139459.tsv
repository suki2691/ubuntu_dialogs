2010-02-26T02:54:00.000Z	petrichor		hi-- my ubuntu is going very slow with 100% CPU usage (intel core 2 duo) e8400 -- system process "mono" is taking up like 100% of the CPU. what is this and can i kill it/remove it via synaptic?
2010-02-26T02:54:00.000Z	petrichor		i'm not sure which mono app it is
2010-02-26T02:54:00.000Z	petrichor		it just shows up as "mono" in the system monitor
2010-02-26T02:55:00.000Z	drazak	petrichor	top, then k, then the pid of mono
