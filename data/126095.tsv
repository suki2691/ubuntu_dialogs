2007-08-30T05:51:00.000Z	Krussy	jrib	and mattyv yeah i read about kile, but that is for KDE? >.< i'm not really understading the whole gnome vs kde deal
2007-08-30T05:51:00.000Z	jrib	Krussy	you can use kde apps in gnome and gnome apps in kde, it just means you have to load some extra libraries
2007-08-30T05:52:00.000Z	Krussy	jrib	i see, there were screen shots available for kile which looked pretty similar to texcenter so i think i'll give that a try. (didn't enjoy lyx for windows at all >.<)
