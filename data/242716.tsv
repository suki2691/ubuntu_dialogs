2007-05-24T16:17:00.000Z	Stonekeeper		how do i know if i have a 32bit or 64bit ubuntu server installed? will it show on uname -r / -a ?
2007-05-24T16:17:00.000Z	jhaig	Stonekeeper	I think the kernel will have a different name for 64 bit.
2007-05-24T16:18:00.000Z	jhaig	Stonekeeper	What does "uname -a" say?  I have x86_64 in the output.
2007-05-24T16:19:00.000Z	jhaig	Stonekeeper	I'm fairly sure that that is x86.
