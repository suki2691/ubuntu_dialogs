2011-09-04T08:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TheGoof	 theres dozens of torrent clients out for ubuntu and linux. thats not related to 'tor' at all. :)
2011-09-04T08:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TheGoof	 correct you should not use Tor for Torrenting. It will  be very slow.
2011-09-04T08:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TheGoof	 Tor is not a browser... so now you have us all confused
