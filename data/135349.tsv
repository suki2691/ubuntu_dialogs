2009-03-30T08:17:00.000Z	Oinkness		I'm using WindowsXP on a Virtual Machine with a 20gb virtual harddrive but I need MORE! So I made a 30gb addition to slap in but How do I get my virtual WinXP to recognize this new space?
2009-03-30T08:18:00.000Z	Oinkness		Because I'm trying to edit HD video and I need the extra space >_>
2009-03-30T08:19:00.000Z	Oinkness		Please message me if you can help
