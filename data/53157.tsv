2009-10-23T20:59:00.000Z	thinkertinker	MK13	and does system calls include reading and writing into files?
2009-10-23T20:59:00.000Z	MK13	thinkertinker	no a system call would be like "system('OS-dependent-call-here')"
2009-10-23T21:00:00.000Z	MK13	thinkertinker	i move code b/tw visual studio and g++ all the time
