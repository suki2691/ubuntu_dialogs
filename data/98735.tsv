2008-02-29T08:30:00.000Z	josh13		I have a basic question. Is it possible to tell /etc/fstab to mount a certain disk under /var/foo directory, with my_user & my_group as uid/gid ?
2008-02-29T08:30:00.000Z	wols	josh13	yes it is
2008-02-29T08:32:00.000Z	josh13	wols	i've looked at the man page..but cannot find what i'm lookin for .. any hints ?
