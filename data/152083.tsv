2007-06-21T16:42:00.000Z	VSpike	HawkeV	could try ##linux - they are a bit prickly but pretty knowledgeable
2007-06-21T16:43:00.000Z	HawkeV	VSpike	this is ubuntu specific... i doubt they're going to be much help tbh
2007-06-21T16:44:00.000Z	VSpike	HawkeV	True, although I was think the method of diagnosing it would be common
