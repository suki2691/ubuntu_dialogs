2009-04-27T00:39:00.000Z	Mad_Gouki	MrKeuner	 This is probably the best you'll get.  I have a "legacy" card too, just be patient is all I can say.  the oss driver isn't THAT bad.
2009-04-27T00:41:00.000Z	MrKeuner	Mad_Gouki	I am all fine with the free driver. I just need googleearth for my thesis
2009-04-27T00:42:00.000Z	Mad_Gouki	MrKeuner	 try #ati  also, do you have another os?  if worst comes to worst, you can make a partition of 8.10 where fglrx still supports your card and use that.  If you have a windows/osx install, just use that.
