2006-08-27T08:33:00.000Z	justin_	ElephantHunter	Yes you can, change your WM however to FLUX or ICEWM.
2006-08-27T08:33:00.000Z	justin_	ElephantHunter	You will be ok if you do not use KDE/GNOME..
2006-08-27T08:34:00.000Z	justin_	ElephantHunter	Installed Xubuntu, same thing with XFCE - but with 32megs.. I would install Flux or ICEWM.
