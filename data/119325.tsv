2009-08-17T04:52:00.000Z	enthdegree		Whenever I open a fullscreen game, such as Battle for Wesnoth or something, my system tray applications (possibly all of my background apps, too?) terminate. Crunchbang 9.04, 2gb ram. When I run gnome-do in the terminal it outputs 'Thanks for Playing' right before it terminates. I have a hunch the problem has to do with openbox, but I'm not sure, can't back it up. Any help would be appreciated, thanks in advance!
