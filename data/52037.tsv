2009-11-03T01:43:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46		My isp says Speakeasy.net is their default speed test site.  Speakeasy gives me roughly 16Mb down.  However it takes 30 sec or more to open a web page.  I just installed Karmic and FF 3.5.  My pings seem to be ok, as well as xchat loading up.  This is a new issue since installing Karmic.  Any ideas?

2009-11-03T01:54:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46	lupine_85	Did you mean to type "about:config" in my browser's address bar?? If so, I see nothing there about ipv6.
