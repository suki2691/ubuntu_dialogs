2006-11-14T14:35:00.000Z	foreverconnected	Discerer	there's a tiny version of ubuntu for servers... think of ubuntu like debian, but nicer.
2006-11-14T14:36:00.000Z	foreverconnected	Discerer	it still has all the same features as every other debian build
2006-11-14T14:36:00.000Z	foreverconnected	Discerer	it's just packed up nicer, and runs really well. you can do all the same stuff without half the hassle, because there's a lot of nie gui tools
