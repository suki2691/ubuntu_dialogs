2010-07-06T07:26:00.000Z	xangua	[Screamo]	ubuntu-restricted-extras will install openjdk but if you want sun java you need to enable the partner repository first
2010-07-06T07:29:00.000Z	xangua	[Screamo]	once you enable it (system>administration>software origins>other software) you can open the software center and search for java plugin ; i repeat again that openjdk should work ass good as sun java if you want to try
