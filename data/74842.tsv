2009-07-12T10:15:00.000Z	scotlfs		Hey, I am having a problem with my mouse. It appears it's function is stuttering. I am having trouble grabbing stuff to move it as well as sometimes I get a double click when I try to grab or even sometimes when I single click, I get a double click response. It's as if the Interrupt is being shared, but not properly. Can anyone help me with this?
