2007-09-22T09:16:00.000Z	cellofellow		I've got a new computer with a nVidia GeForce Go 6100. I have used Ubuntu on other computers. I just want to know if power management works with this card and the binary drivers.

2007-09-22T09:18:00.000Z	cellofellow	Scunizi	I know as much as that, but I've not been able to get Suspend and Hibernate and particularly Resume from either to work on an older computer with the Nvidia-legacy driver.
