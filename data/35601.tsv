2010-03-20T05:59:00.000Z	Tobarja		i just did a linode install of ubuntu. i'm trying to set the hostname. all the docs i've found point to /etc/init.d/hostname.sh but i don't seem to have that. am i missing a package?
2010-03-20T06:00:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Tobarja	the hostname should be in /etc/hostname
2010-03-20T06:01:00.000Z	Tobarja	bastid_raZor	yep, got that part, but then it says to do /etc/init.d/hostname.sh start....
2010-03-20T06:02:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Tobarja	no idea then.
