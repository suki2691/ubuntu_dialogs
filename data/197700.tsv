2010-11-17T23:46:00.000Z	blocky		anyone know why in ubuntu 10.10, with compiz enabled, I can only alt tab forwards, I cannot alt shift tab backwards?
2010-11-17T23:46:00.000Z	ectospasm	blocky	that's a bug in your application switcher
2010-11-17T23:46:00.000Z	ectospasm	blocky	the static application switcher seems to work best for me (alt-tab in both directions)
2010-11-17T23:48:00.000Z	blocky	ectospasm	the static does work, thanks
