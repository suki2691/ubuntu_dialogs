2010-11-08T22:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Quagmire	 better  then what? I tend to use botoable flash drives these days
2010-11-08T22:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Quagmire	 err.. you made a cd. with a single big whatever.iso file as its contents then?
2010-11-08T22:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Quagmire	 if you look on the cd.. and it has whatever.iso   you did it wrong..
