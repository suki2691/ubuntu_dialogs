2007-09-15T14:28:00.000Z	eamonnd		I'm having a problem with compiz. The 3D cube effect and that film strip effect (the one that happens when you hit crtl+alt+down arrow) have stopped working
2007-09-15T14:29:00.000Z	eamonnd		does anyone know how to fix this?
2007-09-15T14:29:00.000Z	jrib	eamonnd	try #ubuntu-effects for help with compiz
2007-09-15T14:32:00.000Z	eamonnd	jrib	nobody is in that room so it isn't much help
