2011-10-23T15:45:00.000Z	Muloza	llutz	I downloaded it from the Software Center.
2011-10-23T15:47:00.000Z	llutz	Muloza	get enigmail-1.1.2 from http://enigmail.mozdev.org/download/index.php.html   or better try to use a more actual thunderbird from the mozilla-ppa
2011-10-23T15:47:00.000Z	Muloza	llutz	Thank you. I enabled the checkbox for Enigmail in the Software Center, I didn't know I could install addons there. Seems to work. :-)
