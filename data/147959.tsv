2007-02-10T15:47:00.000Z	shatrat	Plouj	have you tried searching around in synaptic for xview?  do you have universe and multiverse enabled?  Those are a few steps to take if youre not finding a package
2007-02-10T15:48:00.000Z	Plouj	shatrat	how do I search the synaptic?
2007-02-10T15:48:00.000Z	shatrat	Plouj	there is a search button in the upper center I believe
