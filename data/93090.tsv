2008-04-28T00:25:00.000Z	garu		does anyone have any idea on why is that there are no updates since 8.04 has been released?every other ubuntu distro has updates right after its release.
2008-04-28T00:25:00.000Z	Dr_Stein	garu	they did it right the first time? :-)
2008-04-28T00:29:00.000Z	garu	Dr_Stein	humn...probably, but the thing is, one of my lappies work fine,as it did in the previous version, but the other one, just freezes after being logged in for like 10 minutes...and the other problem, is that, It just wont allow me to enable restricted drivers...
2008-04-28T00:30:00.000Z	garu	Dr_Stein	now, the big question is, do they really start coding like each ubuntu edition from scratch, or do they try to fix the previous releases bugs? :s!lol
