2007-05-04T11:02:00.000Z	therealnanotube	damejiar	ah, without internet, eh...
2007-05-04T11:03:00.000Z	damejiar	therealnanotube	: yes, I asked if there is a lot of cd's or dvd with the repositories, like Debian
2007-05-04T11:05:00.000Z	therealnanotube	damejiar	i think there's a dvd, which includes almost all packages..? haven't used it myself, though...
