2011-05-14T03:02:00.000Z	IsmAvatar		I've got a java program with an icon, but Unity seems to scale the icon or something, and it ends up blurry. Doesn't matter if I make the icon 32x32, 48x48, or 128x128. The guys at ##java sent me here.
2011-05-14T03:04:00.000Z	kostkon	IsmAvatar	have you tried using an svg icon?
2011-05-14T03:05:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	kostkon	the icon is svg, but unfortunately Java doesn't support svg, so I have to convert it into a rasterized image at some point.
