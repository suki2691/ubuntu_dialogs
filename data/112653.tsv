2008-03-10T06:25:00.000Z	bthornton		I've got a Pentium D machine running 32-bit Gutsy whose memory I just recently upgraded to 4GB. Will I be able to use that full amount of memory by upgrading just the kernel to the 64-bit version, or will I have to change the whole OS to 64-bit?

2008-03-10T06:27:00.000Z	bthornton	sfears_	Unconfuse me.
2008-03-10T06:29:00.000Z	bthornton	sfears_	You're correct that the hard drive size doesn't come into it, but it was my memory/RAM that I upgraded to 4GB. :)
