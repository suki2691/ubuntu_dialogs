2006-08-24T08:00:00.000Z	mike_	distantbody	right.  apt-get install doesn't install it
2006-08-24T08:04:00.000Z	distantbody	mike_	select the "applications" menu then "Add/remove" then search for "mplayer"
2006-08-24T08:04:00.000Z	mike_	distantbody	doing apt-get mplayer now.  hopefully that is gmplayer
