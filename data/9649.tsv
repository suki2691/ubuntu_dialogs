2011-09-10T00:02:00.000Z	fr0ggie		ive got an application built on arch-- it uses a pci device that i'd need direct access to. I want to setup an easier to maintain system for a desktop and host this arch appliance in a vm. what's a good distro for hosting kvm/xen and a decent desktop? ubuntu server + kde?

2011-09-10T00:08:00.000Z	fr0ggie	prakas	kubuntu does kvm? Does it support nvidia fakeraid in installer? had hell with that
2011-09-10T00:10:00.000Z	prakas	fr0ggie	i just told you that kubuntu is based on kde so you dont need to install kde. no idea if it works, i er mean the kvm
