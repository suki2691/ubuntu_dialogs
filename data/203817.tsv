2006-08-05T11:41:00.000Z	oxez		How would I give my user permissions to change permissions on a FAT32 filesystem? I managed to give myself rw access, so I can move my data to that new hard drive, but I can't set permissions..
2006-08-05T11:42:00.000Z	mc__	oxez	it is impossible
2006-08-05T11:42:00.000Z	mc__	oxez	fat32 does not support permissions
2006-08-05T11:42:00.000Z	oxez	mc__	oh. I'm trying to checkout my SVN on that filesystem, that's why I guess =/
