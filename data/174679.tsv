It has no led readout but instead uses the PS to display the info. Is there a way to check if there is a linux app for this instead of going back to windows for this one thing? The product page is at http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?parentPage=search&summary=summary&cp=&accessories=accessories&produc
