2006-08-15T09:39:00.000Z	shrift	u221e	the desktop CD has a preset install image, it will install that, there is no way to tweak that until it is installed. however, you can play around more with the "server install CD" and the "alternate install CD" sounds like youw ant eh server install CD.

Honestly, the Ubuntu installer doesn't offer a lot of control over what is installed. If you want more control, you may want to try Debian.
