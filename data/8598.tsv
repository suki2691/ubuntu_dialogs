I had to reinstall drivers from a shell to get lightdm working, but now I can only log in to guest session, I cannot use my user session? any clues why this happens? Thanks

2011-10-18T12:43:00.000Z	maraujop	sivik	I did, apt-get install --reinstall nvidia-current
2011-10-18T12:43:00.000Z	maraujop	sivik	then nvidia-xconfig
