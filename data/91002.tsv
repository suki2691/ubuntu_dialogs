2009-09-11T01:36:00.000Z	cylux		Hey guys, I'm trying to install Ubuntu (tried with 2 diff cd's) and the live-cd just hangs at the boot screen. No matter what I select at the boot man, to install, to go to the desktop environment or anything- it just hangs.
2009-09-11T01:36:00.000Z	cylux		Any ideas?
2009-09-11T01:36:00.000Z	RabidWeezle	cylux	have you tried an alternative installer?
