2009-09-30T02:22:00.000Z	fearful	DasEi	RPG_Master can't seem to find away to recover these files :S I don't know if they were deleted and if we can find them in another folder. But there is no way to back them up unless otherwise :S
2009-09-30T02:25:00.000Z	fearful	DasEi	RPG_Master that actually does work, I can see the output in my /home/user/.evolution folder than of the /usr/share/evolution/2.26... maybe you can check that out
2009-09-30T02:26:00.000Z	fearful	DasEi	agreed.
