2008-01-05T09:35:00.000Z	LeChacal		hello, i have a question what does the file "/proc/modules" do for my system and is it important, because i am getting errors when working with it
2008-01-05T09:36:00.000Z	bruenig	LeChacal	just keeps track of all the running modules and such
2008-01-05T09:37:00.000Z	LeChacal	nickrud	i was trying to read it with gedit and i got the error "The file /proc/modules changed on disk.", the reason i am trying to open it is because i am looking for a line that i think should be there but something else says is not there
2008-01-05T09:37:00.000Z	bruenig	LeChacal	I would just cat it and read it in terminal
