2007-03-16T05:56:00.000Z	tom__		hi all
2007-03-16T05:58:00.000Z	tom__		I wonder if someone could help me, I want to change the default terminal emulator (the oen that gets run when you type x-terminal-emulator)
2007-03-16T05:59:00.000Z	tom__		I did it before but I can't remember how now...
2007-03-16T06:00:00.000Z	Frogzoo	tom__	just bind it to a hotkey in configuration editor -> metacity - much easier by far
