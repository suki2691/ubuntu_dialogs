2008-02-05T05:00:00.000Z	unop__	Tiikeri^	what is 6715s?
2008-02-05T05:02:00.000Z	Tiikeri^	unop__	my laptop.... Compaq 6715 with 32 bit Sempron
2008-02-05T05:04:00.000Z	unop__	Tiikeri^	ahh, thats odd -- installing a 64bit OS on a 32bit machine - doesnt make sense, i'd think it was rubbish - but there may be a good reason for doing so
