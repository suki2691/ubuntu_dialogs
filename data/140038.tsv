2008-06-08T05:11:00.000Z	kantor	tommy_	do you want to recover something ?
2008-06-08T05:12:00.000Z	tommy_	kantor	yes my holiday pics I accidently overwrote
2008-06-08T05:13:00.000Z	tommy_	kantor	I have a 5GB partition for my personal pics. I overwrote the whole 5GB partition till it said FULL. Now I want the original files back that are "under" the new data
