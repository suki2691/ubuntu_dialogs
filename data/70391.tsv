2008-12-30T12:20:00.000Z	lintunen	jtaji	 thanks, I'll give it a go

2008-12-30T18:00:00.000Z	lintunen	jtaji	 the method you suggested earlier for locking packages will not work for me because it talks about pinning to a particular distro, I want to stop custom kernel packages from getting overwritten
