2009-07-03T02:20:00.000Z	Gino		I've got some some questions about mail in ubuntu/linux, first: How much mail is "too much" for one user? Seccond: On a ubuntu installation, is there an application I can use to move mail between user accounts?
2009-07-03T02:21:00.000Z	raylu	Gino	how do you have your mail stored?
2009-07-03T02:32:00.000Z	raylu	Gino	your ubuntu 7.04 box is actually serving as a mailserver? are you sure it's not the mail client?
2009-07-03T02:32:00.000Z	Gino	raylu	yes I know.... don't get me started on the person who built the "servers" where I work....
