2009-10-18T14:57:00.000Z	icarus-c	iceroot	i didn't know that
2009-11-06T12:42:00.000Z	icarus-c	iceroot	i don't see the point.. if there are only one user using the machine, why not give it all resource? when multiple users are using and the machine is busy, it balance each users CPU cycles quite well
2009-11-06T12:43:00.000Z	iceroot	icarus-c	the users are using a heavy "make" and i dont want to allow that they use make with an option to use more then 1 core
