2008-01-09T20:52:00.000Z	glm1		hi. can anyone suggest a php/html editing environment or app?
2008-01-09T20:52:00.000Z	glm1		which is the more lightweight of the two?
2008-01-09T20:53:00.000Z	xy77	glm1	I would say quanta, but it's a KDE application and thus not as lightweight as gedit of course.
2008-01-09T20:54:00.000Z	xy77	glm1	also emacs comes to mind...
