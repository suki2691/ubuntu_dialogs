2005-04-28T10:31:00.000Z	daveist		is ubuntu faster than kubuntu?
2005-04-28T10:32:00.000Z	amiroff	daveist	the base is the same
2005-04-28T10:33:00.000Z	amiroff	daveist	you can only judge by using both gnome and kde
2005-04-28T10:34:00.000Z	amiroff	daveist	I don't think so, ubuntu just has mnimal services by default
