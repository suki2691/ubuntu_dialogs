2011-02-16T12:09:00.000Z	fuzzybunny69y		I am just not sure how to get nautilus to search the current folder I am in without searching the home folder. Like say if I wanted to find all the files in the current directory with the word php in it or something

2011-02-16T12:09:00.000Z	robertzaccour		thats a good search tool. similar to spotlight in os x
2011-02-16T12:10:00.000Z	fuzzybunny69y	robertzaccour	yeah I use kupfer instead though it doesn't seem like it is updated anymore
