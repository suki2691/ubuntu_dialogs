2008-07-16T10:02:00.000Z	dr_Willis	dbbolton	 most likely no. unless you are using 'sli'  enabled video cards.
2008-07-16T10:04:00.000Z	dbbolton	dr_Willis	how would it help sli cards?
2008-07-16T10:05:00.000Z	dr_Willis	dbbolton	 the point of 'sli' is  to allow multi video cards to share the rendering load. thus having sli video cards working together will double your rendering  power. (not quite, but it does give it a boost)
