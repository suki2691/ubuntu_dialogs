2010-03-01T09:02:00.000Z	GeekSquid	spiffythekid	I wouldn't say all distro's but /etc/crontab is the default for ubuntu
2010-03-01T09:05:00.000Z	spiffythekid	GeekSquid	you're saying it's just a file within /etc/ not within /ect/cron.daily/ or something like that?
2010-03-01T09:06:00.000Z	GeekSquid	spiffythekid	on my system /etc/crontab is a file which I haven't touched , so yes but more info follows
