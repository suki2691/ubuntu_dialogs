2009-08-04T21:47:00.000Z	shawnps		I'd like to be able to VNC into an Ubuntu machine running 9.04 Server, but it doesn't seem to be working.  Do I need other things installed aside from vnc4server?

2009-08-04T21:49:00.000Z	shawnps		It seems like I can connect, it just displays a black background
2009-08-04T21:49:00.000Z	shawnps	grawity	I'm not sure, what's the package called that would need to be installed for X?
