2009-05-24T23:35:00.000Z	geezer		Xchat-gnome crashes often on 9.04 ... has anyone else experienced this problem?
2009-05-24T23:36:00.000Z	bn43	geezer	been using it for awhile - no issues
2009-05-24T23:37:00.000Z	geezer	bn43	thanks for the input.... Maybe I'll just get the regular Xchat instead of Xchat-Gnome.... didn't have issues with that one in 8.10.
