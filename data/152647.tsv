2006-12-28T10:02:00.000Z	kitche	genius314	nothing if it's not in there don't worry about it
2006-12-28T10:03:00.000Z	kitche	genius314	my resolution is never in xorg.conf
2006-12-28T10:04:00.000Z	genius314	kitche	arrenlex: Ok. There's a help page telling me not to have them. Just making sure its right (well, it's on the Ubuntu website, so I'd assume it was).
