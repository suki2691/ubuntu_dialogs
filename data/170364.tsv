2010-09-14T05:46:00.000Z	hackel		Does the shitty binary Nvidia driver just have huge memory leaks or does Ubuntu's Xorg have a problem?  After just 3 days uptime my Xorg is using 1.6G resident memory...really pissing me off.
2010-09-14T05:47:00.000Z	gionnico	hackel	do you use compiz?
2010-09-14T05:50:00.000Z	hackel	gionnico	yes, but I don't remember it ever being this bad before...
2010-09-14T05:51:00.000Z	gionnico	hackel	yeah no if ram size increases when you do nothing or after you close something there's a leak. i can't help further
