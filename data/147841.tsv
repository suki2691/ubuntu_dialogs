2007-01-24T16:21:00.000Z	Eris		I've been looking for information regarding the screen blanking/shutting down regardless of the powermanagement or screensaver options on edgy. I've read around on the neat about simular problems but they all seem to be related to dpms and NOT turning the monitor off. I have option "DPMS" "false" (and yes ive even tried it true) still same thing, i try xset dpms 0 0 0 and it still blanks after 10 mins, driving me nuts
2007-01-24T16:22:00.000Z	Eris		it used to work fine till i upgraded from breezy thru dapper to edgy a week or so ago

2007-01-24T16:23:00.000Z	Eris	pbureau	im not sure what you mean but i have changed the settings in the powermanagement dialog
