2008-02-01T00:16:00.000Z	_0x44_		I recently purchased an Inspiron 1420n, and last night I was experimenting with suspend. I closed the laptop, and it suspended as normal, but this morning when I went to use it, the battery was dead. Apparently the laptop woke up about fifty minutes after I put it away and then never went back to sleep. How do I prevent that in the future?

2008-02-01T00:30:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_0x44_	i would suggest shutdown
2008-02-01T00:31:00.000Z	_0x44_	MasterShrek	Why? Aside from the computer waking up unexpectedly, I haven't had any issues with suspend/hibernate.
