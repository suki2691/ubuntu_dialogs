2008-06-17T19:31:00.000Z	Bricker		i instaslled ubuntu on my laptop the other night (using a shrunk drive from vista) and it seems everytime i do a system update (ie i did system update the other night, and now today for 45updates) and when i do them and restart, it seems to duplicate itself on the GRUB loader. ANy ideas?
