2007-02-08T06:43:00.000Z	deinspanjer		Hi folks, couple of quick questions about kernel upgrading.. I was poking around in Synaptic and it alerted me that there are upgrades available, namely linux-image-generic 2.6.17.11.  However, it won't upgrade from .10 because -generic depends on package linux-image-2.6.17.11-generic, and that package doesn't appear in my list (and synaptic says it is not installable).
2007-02-08T06:43:00.000Z	deinspanjer		Is there something I'm doing wrong here?
