2008-01-06T07:41:00.000Z	F-u-z-z-Y		Hi all, can someone please explain what a swap partition is and what it does. Im trying to install ubuntu on a newly created 10gb partition. I have 3 partition in total. Windows 20gb, linux 10gb and other, 120gb. Thanks
2008-01-06T07:42:00.000Z	F-u-z-z-Y		ah, so i should have 2 partitions for linux then. a 10gb partition and .5gb partition.
2008-01-06T07:42:00.000Z	F-u-z-z-Y		Is it safe to continure without a swap partition?
