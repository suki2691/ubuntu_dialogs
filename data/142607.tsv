2007-12-24T22:57:00.000Z	sarixe	Andeh	i can't even reconnect the ipod to the computer.  it seems to have bricked, and when i plug it in, there isn't even a /dev/ file for it
2007-12-24T23:01:00.000Z	sarixe	Andeh	: anyway, i'm following the advice (as of 12 hours ago) to leave the ipod unplugged for 24 hours, to drain the battery.  i was just wondering whether there was a quicker way to get it
