2010-10-10T17:27:00.000Z	Tdude		Anyone know if the 10.10 release supports the USB stick boot?
2010-10-10T17:28:00.000Z	NickyJ101	Tdude	why, you having issues?
2010-10-10T17:42:00.000Z	NickyJ101	Tdude	You should be able to get the full version now, not just the RC
2010-10-10T17:53:00.000Z	NickyJ101	Tdude	once RC is done, the update there will get the full release anyway
