2012-04-01T04:08:00.000Z	bitplane-		Hi all, I'm thinking about doing some service discovery app that finds machines on a lan. anyone have any ideas other than resorting to brute-force with nmap?
2012-04-01T04:09:00.000Z	pycoderf	bitplane-	what is the discovery for? ip use or something else
2012-04-01T04:09:00.000Z	bitplane-	pycoderf	I'd like to draw a pretty network map and be able to zoom into machines etc
2012-04-01T04:09:00.000Z	pycoderf	bitplane-	i am assuming you want free?
