2011-09-29T02:15:00.000Z	h00k	JamesMiddendorff	netbook remix has been merged into Ubuntu. They use the same interface now.
2011-09-29T02:16:00.000Z	JamesMiddendorff	h00k	Gentoo64, so if I have a 2gb hard drive it wont install on it then right?
2011-09-29T02:17:00.000Z	h00k	JamesMiddendorff	I think it fully installs to more than 2gb, yeah.
