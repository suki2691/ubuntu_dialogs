2009-04-22T15:54:00.000Z	Mohero		is there a way I can change the MOTD and still have the cron job update the packages that can be installed?
2009-04-22T15:55:00.000Z	bassliner	Mohero	that question really doesn't make sense to me.
2009-04-22T15:55:00.000Z	Mohero	bassliner	the MOTD is updated by a cron job, so when I modify the MOTD, cron over-writes it again
2009-04-22T15:58:00.000Z	Mohero	bassliner	ok, i'll do that...
