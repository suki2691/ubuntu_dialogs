2009-04-06T00:57:00.000Z	Supersaiyan_IV	Creative1412	if nvidia, buy anything that has the G96 chip
2009-04-06T00:58:00.000Z	Supersaiyan_IV	Creative1412	ati doesn't have good linux support imo, but they are getting better
2009-04-06T00:59:00.000Z	Supersaiyan_IV	Creative1412	another reason to choose nvidia is because they have developed a vdpau codec tha enables hardware h264 and VC1 decoding in linux
