2008-01-20T08:52:00.000Z	bazhang	carlos_	many have--someone set theirs up as a media server using mediatomb--no idea how he got it going though
2008-01-20T08:54:00.000Z	bazhang	carlos_	depends on the copy protection; k9copy may be able to do it--though would mean installing some kde stuff in your system
2008-01-20T08:54:00.000Z	bazhang	carlos_	if you know the drm type you should probably google + ubuntuforums before you install all that stuff
