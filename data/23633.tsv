2010-12-20T07:29:00.000Z	leslie		I am in an attempt to remove Windows 7 from my hard drive and have ubuntu running as the only os on the hard drive but i do not want to damage any of the mods i've made to ubuntu thus far. Just looking for a second opinion but will this information help me in removing windows 7 and regaining the hard drive space with it? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowtoPartition/ReformattingPartition
