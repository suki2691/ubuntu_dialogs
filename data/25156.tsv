2010-09-27T18:51:00.000Z	rquiroga		Hi guys, I need some help with Grub2 on Karmic, have to boot manually through rescue grub2 console commands
2010-09-27T18:51:00.000Z	rusivi	rquiroga	may want to search for grub2 config file(s) editing
2010-09-27T18:56:00.000Z	rusivi	rquiroga	granted this should have happened. Updating grub from one type to another is getting cute, I would reinstall unless your interested in figuring it all out.
2010-09-27T18:58:00.000Z	rquiroga	rusivi	I thought it would be easy since there is a bug report, saying that overwriting wubldr file with a patched version, booting manually and then update-grub would fix the problem
