2009-08-13T05:34:00.000Z	shadowh511	MOUD	in a terminal, type in killall man
2009-08-13T05:35:00.000Z	MOUD	shadowh511	There's a way using the Backspace if i'm not wrong
2009-08-13T05:35:00.000Z	shadowh511	MOUD	you are thinking of control-alt-backspace, but that was disabled (*sigh*) log out and back in
