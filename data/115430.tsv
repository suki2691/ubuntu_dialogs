2008-04-30T21:38:00.000Z	rubystallion		I had to install a driver with apt-get to get my sound working, but I don't remember which one it was :( Now with hardy my sound doesn't work again. I have an HP Pavilion dv6550eg notebook. Any ideas?

2008-04-30T21:40:00.000Z	rubystallion	AncientPC	I tried, but I couldn't find any results. I know it was a page about installing linux on that notebook with detailed instructions about every step...
2008-04-30T21:42:00.000Z	AncientPC	rubystallion	I couldn't find anything on Google either, the only thing left I can think of is to play around with System -> Pref -> Sound Settings and play around in there.
