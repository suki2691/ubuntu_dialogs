2011-02-26T03:41:00.000Z	MACscr		hmm, how do i get the correct key for this? W: GPG error: http://ppa.launchpad.net maverick Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 4DEF31B9A9E345C0
2011-02-26T03:43:00.000Z	MACscr		nvm, i got the key issue resolved. Had a typo when trying ot update it earlier
