2005-06-15T11:18:00.000Z	amonkey		how can i listen to a shoutcast stream? xmms doesn't seem to acknowledge it as audio and totem yells at me.
2005-06-15T11:20:00.000Z	ablyss	amonkey	have you tried a different stream?
2005-06-15T11:23:00.000Z	amonkey	ablyss	i was trying the one off of 4chan (.pls), i assume it's good cuz everyone would yell if it wasn't
2005-06-15T11:25:00.000Z	amonkey	ablyss	nm, you are right. seems to be down. oops.
