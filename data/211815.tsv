2007-07-20T14:00:00.000Z	shoofle		I need some help
2007-07-20T14:01:00.000Z	shoofle		I have an ubuntu 6.10 cd, and I booted up this computer I want to install it on.  GNOME came up and stuff, and I tried to run the "install" shortcut on the desktop.  It didn't run.  I've been waiting around for about half an hour, which I wouldn't put as *that* unreasonable for this computer.  Nothing is happening.  Any ideas why it isn't installing?  It would be nice to have someone privmsg me to help me out with this.
