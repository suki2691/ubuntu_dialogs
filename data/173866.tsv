2006-08-03T11:00:00.000Z	urakaipa		Could someone help me with this problem? I've got a msi mainboard (915) with an integrated sata controller. Everytime I reboot the computer, ubuntu shutdown the disks and at boot time I've to wait until the disks spin up again. There is no way to let the disks spinning if rebooting? Thanks in advance
