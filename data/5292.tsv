2012-07-15T16:01:00.000Z	anthony__		I have xfce.  when I go log-out-button -> suspend, what command is actually used?
2012-07-15T16:01:00.000Z	anthony__		I would like to create a custom keyboard mapping
2012-07-15T16:02:00.000Z	L3top	anthony__	I expect it is something to the effect of service xfce4 suspend.
2012-07-15T16:04:00.000Z	anthony__	L3top	ferni thanks.  pm-suspend requires root.  does xfce run as root?
