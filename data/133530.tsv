2007-08-18T06:18:00.000Z	shinichizio		Let's say I want to install something that I can't get with the package manager. Does it matter if it's a zip vs. a tar or a gz?

2007-08-18T06:20:00.000Z	shinichizio	faileas	Right, but the page I'm downlading it from says they all contain the same code. Still, I'm assuming a tar/gz would be better in this case then?
