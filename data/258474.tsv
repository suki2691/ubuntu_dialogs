2007-02-28T17:09:00.000Z	rlj		i'm going to set up a simple samba file server also acting as a PDC. but apart from file serving over samba, it won't do other server duties. any reason why i should install the server edition of ubuntu rather than from the desktop cd? (i already have one of those). cause i will probably install a desktop environment on the system anyway because i want to be able to browse files and burn dvd backups easily
