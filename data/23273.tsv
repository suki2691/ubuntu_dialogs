2010-11-09T18:59:00.000Z	cloversg	rkokkelk	play your downloaded video back from vlc and stream it
2010-11-09T19:00:00.000Z	rkokkelk	cloversg	but I have to download it before I could stream, I mean could I stream just from the source in any way
2010-11-09T19:01:00.000Z	cloversg	rkokkelk	why not ask others to just connect to the streaming video site?
