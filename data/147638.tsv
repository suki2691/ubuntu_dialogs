2007-01-26T10:09:00.000Z	pike_	Julle	you might consider damns small linux. it is a livecd based on debian i think and has apt-get. it would give you an idea of what is involved before you actually install..

2007-01-26T10:37:00.000Z	Julle	pike_	hi, i've tried Damn Small Linux but i dont think that apt-get is on the live cd.. is there any way that i could install apt-get function on DSL ?
