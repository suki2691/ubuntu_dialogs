2010-06-09T05:55:00.000Z	ubuntu		this is the kind of annoying crap i expect from microsoft software, this behavior needs to change,  otherwise there is no incentive to use linux if the applications are just as dumb as their windows counterparts

2010-06-09T06:00:00.000Z	carl-m_	ubuntu	what makes you think any of them is here?
