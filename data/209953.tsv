2006-10-26T08:11:00.000Z	LjL	onurx	yes
2006-10-26T08:13:00.000Z	LjL	onurx	upgrading should be fine. it's your choice though
2006-10-26T08:15:00.000Z	LjL	onurx	upgrading will give you all the benefits of edgy, including faster boot. however, if you have a particularly slow boot due to daemons that are started up at boottime (which you may have installed from packages), those will stay, and would have to be removed using APT if they are not needed.
