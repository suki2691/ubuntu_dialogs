2007-11-17T15:57:00.000Z	c0Ld		I googled around for a bit trying to find speed boosts for Firefox, and one in particular caught my eye. Running firefox with "MOZ_DISABLE_PANGO=1 firefox" -doubles- my rendering speed. Is there any way I can make this change permanent so that I don't have to launch it from the terminal every time?

2007-11-17T15:57:00.000Z	mavi-	c0Ld	thats the firefox "registry"
