2011-09-16T19:54:00.000Z	escott	antiphysicist	you don't want your /home on ntfs. the permission models are different
2011-09-16T19:55:00.000Z	antiphysicist	graingert	how would I disable journaling and what are the drawbacks? dr_willis so you're suggesting to use ntfs for my home partition and then windows will be able to access it?
2011-09-16T19:55:00.000Z	escott	antiphysicist	and you dont want it on fat32 because there are no permissions. you want to mount an NTFS partition to a folder ~/windows and put files you need in both there
