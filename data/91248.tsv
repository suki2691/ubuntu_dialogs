2008-06-18T14:55:00.000Z	gidna		Why receive I this error /tmp/001-1.wmv could not be opened, because the associated helper application does not exist. Change the association in your preferences.?

2008-06-18T14:56:00.000Z	wgrant	gidna	What if you right-click on it, and select an alternate application?
