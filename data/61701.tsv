2009-11-04T00:59:00.000Z	grawity	SmnLpz	...what CSWookie said, but with "sudo "
2009-11-04T01:15:00.000Z	grawity	SmnLpz	You don't... a better way is to add the "Server password" in Network Settings.
2009-11-04T01:16:00.000Z	grawity	SmnLpz	Note - try "Server password" box first. Only if it doesn't work, then try "Nickserv password"
