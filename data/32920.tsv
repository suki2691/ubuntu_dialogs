2010-07-03T07:12:00.000Z	thune3	ABBADON	i'm a proponent of hanging-back/reverting on a minor kernel upgrade if it causes problems. Stick with the one that works (unless you are into the debugging) The
2010-07-03T07:13:00.000Z	ABBADON	thune3	Ok, so stick with the working kernel for now, then.  Am I still able to use the patched Intel drivers I got from the PPA mentioned in the release notes for 10.04?
2010-07-03T07:15:00.000Z	thune3	ABBADON	i asusme so, those drivers were published two weeks ago.
2010-07-03T07:18:00.000Z	ABBADON	thune3	Ok, just making sure.  Those drivers solved my shutdown issue, which is good, but I just wanted to make sure they don't depend on the newest kernel version.  Thank you thune3 and IdleOne for your help.
