2010-10-14T00:35:00.000Z	fgh		do i need the alternate iso to be able to chose what packages to be installed?
2010-10-14T00:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	fgh	no; you need minimal iso
2010-10-14T00:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	fgh	alternate does not let you choose iirc
2010-10-14T00:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	fgh	dunno; been a while since i instaled a freshh ubuntu system ... can check in a kvm here ...
