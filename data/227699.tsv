2007-01-09T10:25:00.000Z	mteter		Does Ubuntu Server have a built-in firewall?  I don't understand why lighttpd doesn't appear to be listening on a port from outside the box
2007-01-09T10:26:00.000Z	mteter		ok, thanks. didn't realize that
2007-01-09T10:26:00.000Z	mteter		so I'll need to go allow for ports I want
2007-01-09T10:27:00.000Z	Jowi	mteter	no. iptables does not block any ports by default
