2012-10-05T21:29:00.000Z	roasted_	DJones	yes, I can select it there. What I'd like is for it to DEFAULT to a specific scanner. It always defaults to the one that doesn't work for me.
2012-10-05T21:33:00.000Z	DJones	roasted_	I can't see any way of changing/setting a default scanner
2012-10-05T21:34:00.000Z	roasted_	DJones	I hear ya. :( I was hoping maybe there was a config file I could swap around, ya know?
