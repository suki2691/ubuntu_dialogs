2010-05-13T19:55:00.000Z	saliak		Has anyone had any experience getting a USB device to work over an IP network?  for example, i have a program i've written that allows me to control my robot via usb joystick, but when I use my robot, I'd rather not have to rely on the wired usb connection to control it.  ideally i could run my program on the robot, but use something that makes the usb driver detect the joystick connected to another computer on the network
