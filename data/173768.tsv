2006-07-31T12:33:00.000Z	detien		when I check the connection , it say "Name: eth0, Status: Idle
2006-07-31T12:33:00.000Z	sethk	detien	there are a millions reasons why that might happen.
2006-07-31T12:33:00.000Z	detien	sethk	I'm pretty sure that the NIC card is working . I think there is something wrong with DHCP or something
