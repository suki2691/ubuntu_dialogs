2009-06-25T18:44:00.000Z	cemc		can somebody tell me where the current resolution is stored for gnome for a given user?
2009-06-25T18:44:00.000Z	cemc		or how can I revert to a sane resolution after I "accidentaly" changed to a resolution too low to display anything useful
2009-06-25T18:45:00.000Z	radiounix	cemc	/etc/X11/xorg.conf - it's in that file
2009-06-25T18:45:00.000Z	cemc	radiounix	nope, there are some default settings, no resolution
