2009-10-10T06:32:00.000Z	rgov	genewitch	 i pasted that but for instance /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions (nor /etc/init.d/functions) doesnt exist
2009-10-10T06:34:00.000Z	genewitch	rgov	they may not exist but did you try rebooting after doing the symlinks per the instructions?
2009-10-10T06:35:00.000Z	genewitch	rgov	i don't have any idea how init.d and rc.d work :-(
2009-10-10T06:37:00.000Z	genewitch	rgov	oh, evidently i led you astray. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpSamba
