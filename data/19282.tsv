2012-08-02T14:26:00.000Z	ThinkT510	somethinginteres	those sort of releases only apply to the lts versions though
2012-08-02T14:31:00.000Z	somethinginteres	ThinkT510	I'd need to do the install tonight unless .1 is on the way soon I guess I'll just have to download updates.
2012-08-02T14:32:00.000Z	somethinginteres	ThinkT510	no major hassle besides bandwidth.
