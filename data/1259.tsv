2012-09-06T09:05:00.000Z	gmachine_24		I am having trouble with cron . ... this is the line for the cron job          59 23 * * *  ~/Documents/scripts/rsync.script
2012-09-06T09:06:00.000Z	gmachine_24		the ~/Documents/scripts/rsync.script is fine and works...... I can run it from a terminal
2012-09-06T09:06:00.000Z	jeep	gmachine_24	use the actual path instead of ~/
2012-09-06T09:07:00.000Z	gmachine_24	jeep	ok. I can't remember where this cron file is supposed to go though.
