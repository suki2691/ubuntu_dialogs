2007-09-29T08:51:00.000Z	MattUK		so without causing an arguement, is easyubuntu safer than automatix or are they both non reccomended products?
2007-09-29T08:52:00.000Z	jrib	MattUK	both unnecessary
2007-09-29T08:52:00.000Z	MattUK	jrib	yes i guessed that, i used it when i first moved to linux to make things easier for myself - going to install 7.10 when that comes out and will be staying clear of anything such as automatix or easyubuntu
