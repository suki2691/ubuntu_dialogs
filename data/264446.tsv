2004-10-05T07:01:00.000Z	xbsd		Hello people, I can't change my screen resolution in Gnome, what's the equiv. of xfree86.config in Ubuntu?
2004-10-05T07:01:00.000Z	xbsd		thx
2004-10-05T07:02:00.000Z	|trey|	xbsd	where is it called xfree86.config?  /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 is what you want though
2004-10-05T07:02:00.000Z	|trey|	xbsd	xorg.config exists using xorg... NEVER was a file called xfree86.config though  :/
