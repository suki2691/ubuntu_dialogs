2005-12-27T06:48:00.000Z	HighHopes		Hello! Somebody knows when Firefox 1.5 will be put in Universe or Multiverse repositories?
2005-12-27T06:48:00.000Z	crimsun	HighHopes	it won't. It's a main package.
2005-12-27T06:49:00.000Z	HighHopes	crimsun	but ff 1.07 is in repositories... why won't put 1.5 ?
2005-12-27T06:49:00.000Z	crimsun	HighHopes	because they're FROZEN. They released. No new software (or versions of existing software) goes in. Period.
