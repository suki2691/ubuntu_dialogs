2009-06-20T08:10:00.000Z	Nate_		anyone know how to ID a processor in linux?
2009-06-20T08:10:00.000Z	rwlove_	Nate_	cat /proc/cpuinfo might help
2009-06-20T08:12:00.000Z	rwlove_	Nate_	dmidecode will tell you about the mobo... I don't know about AMD stuff, but maybe the socket on the mobo might be a clue
