2006-06-18T13:11:00.000Z	fluxbox	SurfnKid	Yea i'd like F2 to run /usr/bin/3desk and ardchoille Its because you need to run it to bring the desktops back up so like press F2 and it brings it up in 3d
2006-06-18T13:12:00.000Z	ardchoille	fluxbox	what I was saying is you can put 3ddesk in your startfile so it runs when fluxbox starts
