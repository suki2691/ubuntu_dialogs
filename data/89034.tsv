2010-08-10T22:53:00.000Z	britta		good afternoon- evening, or whatever. I'm trying to use my new GPS usb dongle. It's an ND-100S, but ubuntu 10.04 doesn't seem to recognise it out of the box. can anyone tell me which of these ports I should fill in instead of 'n' in this command? gpsd /dev/ttyUSBn. I've pasted the result of dmesg | tail here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/476048/  Thanks in advance.
