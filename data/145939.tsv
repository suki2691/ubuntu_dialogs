2008-05-07T19:46:00.000Z	hwilde	kaje1	search in synaptic
2008-05-07T19:47:00.000Z	kaje1	hwilde	there are several options in synaptic... I was hoping someone could give me a nudge in the direction of the preferred one...
2008-05-07T19:47:00.000Z	hwilde	kaje1	the ones that have version number with ubuntu in the name are supported
