2009-05-11T05:27:00.000Z	blaise	J-_	mind you, the cube is a compiz plugin and unafeleated with the fusion stuff
2009-05-11T05:29:00.000Z	J-_	blaise	compiz-fusion is already installed. Just install compizconfig-settings-manager. You'll get a huge amount of plugins and whatever you need to get the cube working however you like.
