2007-06-25T09:39:00.000Z	ether		would there be any major problem with installing ubuntu on a hard drive of one computer, taking that hard drive out, and sticking it in another computer?
2007-06-25T09:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ether	 i had some issues in the PAST with that.. not sure if its much of an issue now a days
