2007-07-03T11:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	rustalot	works fine for most systems, there is always a danger when modifying any partition with any program
2007-07-03T11:34:00.000Z	rustalot	Jack_Sparrow	will it move data out of the way?
2007-07-03T11:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	rustalot	yes, providing you have enough space for all the files in the partition you are making
