2009-06-29T13:00:00.000Z	qe2eqe	usicow	they look different.
2009-06-29T13:01:00.000Z	qe2eqe	usicow	however, there are few restrictions on the ms-fonts package or whatever, and it's not very hard to get those fonts you're used to in there
2009-06-29T13:01:00.000Z	usicow	qe2eqe	is there a way to make them look the same as winblows?
