2007-06-02T10:27:00.000Z	deegee	m_m_m	I have same issue with 7.04. My prob is my swap partition is too small
2007-06-02T10:29:00.000Z	m_m_m	deegee	is a gig big enough? that's about how big my swap partition is.
2007-06-02T10:30:00.000Z	deegee	m_m_m	The docs I read online is the swap should match your installed memory. My swap is 250meg and memory is 1 gig. There could be other issues
