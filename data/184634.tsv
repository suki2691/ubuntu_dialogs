2006-05-27T05:02:00.000Z	Where		Is there any way to reverse the default page printing order?
2006-05-27T05:02:00.000Z	paradizelost	Where	usually when you print, you can choose to print in reverse order
2006-05-27T05:02:00.000Z	paradizelost		usually as print last page first
2006-05-27T05:03:00.000Z	Where	paradizelost	in the OO.org print dialog, there isn't such an option :(
