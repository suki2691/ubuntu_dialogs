2011-06-16T21:45:00.000Z	Pici	rrittenh1use	8.04 desktop is already EOL. The server packages will drop from support in 2013.
2011-06-16T21:45:00.000Z	rrittenh1use	Pici	so its no longer updating? the notice was a little confusing I thought.
2011-06-16T21:46:00.000Z	Pici	rrittenh1use	Many of the packages that the desktop install uses are also in the server install, so some core things are updating.
