2009-04-11T07:36:00.000Z	rpk2012		I know people are probably all asking questions but I am seriously stuck.  Durring install and initialization, my pc froze.  When I rebooted, it said hd failure, and when I hit f1 to continue, no matter what, I can never see anything on my monitor, not even the bios info
