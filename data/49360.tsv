2011-09-07T17:44:00.000Z	[unf]		I had ubuntu installed as my primary os, then I installed windows 7... I never deleted the ubuntu partition I created a new one for the windows os... how can I access the linux partition and boot into it again? I don't get any boot options when the computer starts...
