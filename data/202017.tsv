2012-07-07T07:36:00.000Z	IdleOne	V3NG3NC3	the true question is why you are asking for support in an Ubuntu channel after you stated you were not running Ubuntu. So if you want help, please install Ubuntu and the helpers in here will be happy to oblige. Till then, stop wasting the valuable time of the people in here with your non supported distro.
