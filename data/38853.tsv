2010-01-19T09:22:00.000Z	obliv|on		turnkey is based on ubuntu so how is that offtopic?
2010-01-19T09:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	obliv|on	its not an official release by canonical so is not supported here
2010-01-19T09:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	obliv|on	many Linux releases are based on ubuntu and are equally not supported here
