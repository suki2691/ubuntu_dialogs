2005-04-18T12:43:00.000Z	Rebroad	whiskey_1	you can use GPL apps, to create your commercial product
2005-04-18T12:43:00.000Z	Rebroad	whiskey_1	but you can't modify existing GPL products and re-sell them as commercial
2005-04-18T12:47:00.000Z	Rebroad	whiskey_1	for instance. you could write a commercial program in python (which is GPL) and sell it, but if you were to make modifications to python itself, then you would be required to distribute the modifications that you made to python.
