2009-01-23T13:42:00.000Z	triplc		any "slim down" guide, please
2009-01-23T13:44:00.000Z	triplc		i disable all effect. in fact, i use dwm window manager (not gnome)
2009-01-23T13:44:00.000Z	ac13	triplc	I have effects disabled too. But is there any way I can turn on effects and not have these problems?
