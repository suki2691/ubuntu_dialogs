2012-08-10T01:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	supercom32	Swap partitions are configured to be used in /etc/fstab.
2012-08-10T01:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	supercom32	Just make sure that each installation has only one swap partition, its own, configured in /etc/fstab.
2012-08-10T01:06:00.000Z	supercom32	Jordan_U	So I can configure each instances /etc/fstab to just use the swap partition they were assigned?
