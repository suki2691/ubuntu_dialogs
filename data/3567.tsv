2012-10-07T02:44:00.000Z	jagginess	tozen	probably not, i think the linux sleeping drivers are all still a WIP (work in progress... for any linux, not just ubuntu)
2012-10-07T02:44:00.000Z	jagginess	tozen	device sleeping/waking is still *problematic with linux
2012-10-07T02:45:00.000Z	jagginess	tozen	but the "end" devices with their own "power" switch, of course they turn off themselves, but the usb port of the computer is still listening with power on
