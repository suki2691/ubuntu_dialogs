2009-05-01T06:21:00.000Z	racecar56	traskbt	if your'e resizing the partition while booted off the hard disk, the obvious answer is no way, however if you're booted off of a cd (gparted live, whatever) then i don't see what's wrong
2009-05-01T06:21:00.000Z	traskbt	racecar56	thank you, I'll boot into 8.10 live cd and give it a whirl then, I need more room on my NTFS partition for games, heh.
