2008-12-12T18:28:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowgodd		so when i edit fstab, do i declare my filesystem as ntfs-3g OR fuseblk?
2008-12-12T18:28:00.000Z	enzotib	ohletmeinnowgodd	ntfs is ok
2008-12-12T18:28:00.000Z	ohletmeinnowgodd	enzotib	will fuseblk work?
2008-12-12T18:29:00.000Z	enzotib	ohletmeinnowgodd	i don't know, but i think it doesn't work, i'm sure ntfs works
