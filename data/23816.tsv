2012-01-04T06:47:00.000Z	Argorok	blackshirt	my ubuntu doesnt recognize my nvidia card. After grub the screen goes black and my display show "NO SIGNAL"... I can use vga=791, nosplash, nofb, nomodeset, or any combination of them, and it doesnt work

2012-01-04T06:53:00.000Z	Argorok	blackshirt	dr_willis, tryed vesa with vga=791 and other options... Nothing too... Didn't try this text option... Need to delete quiet splash to add text?
