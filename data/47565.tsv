2012-02-14T21:05:00.000Z	ubernoob		has anyone here managed to run PCBSD9 within virtualbox in ubuntu 11.10?
2012-02-14T21:06:00.000Z	theadmin	ubernoob	Uh... I installed PCBSD on vbox in the past just fine (though the installer crashed cause "not enough disk space", but it appeared to be working well). Also, that's not an Ubuntu issue so...
2012-02-14T21:07:00.000Z	ubernoob	theadmin	fair point but I was just communicating my 'results' because I'd come here earlier to get some help on a related matter
