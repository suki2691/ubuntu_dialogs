2010-05-02T23:46:00.000Z	hypetech	mellis	is whatever you're connecting to on the other end also a gigabit port?
2010-05-02T23:46:00.000Z	mellis	hypetech	- yeah i have a gigabit switch
2010-05-02T23:48:00.000Z	hypetech	mellis	yes if the NIC and switch port are gigabit, you should still be connecting at gigabit regardless of the router
