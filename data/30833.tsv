I read I could do this by running Gparted Live off a USB (which I have already created). Is this a good way?

2010-06-05T21:23:00.000Z	aosys	ianwizard	I have tried to install Xubuntu 10.04 before and when I reached step 4 it gave me the 2 choices you stated. The 1st automatic one said that it would wipe out my C:\ drive (the drive that contains XP). I was scared off from installing because of this. So are you saying to just go ahead with it?
2010-06-05T21:27:00.000Z	aosys	ianwizard	i should mention that Step 4 of the Xubuntu 10.04 installer is a bit different than Step 4 of the Ubuntu 10.04 installer.
