2009-04-24T03:01:00.000Z	myk_robinson	zsquareplusc	May have found something. There is an option under Routers for "Use this connection only for its internal resources"
2009-04-24T03:02:00.000Z	myk_robinson		nope, that didnt work
2009-04-24T03:03:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	myk_robinson	if you know the gatweay IP numbers etc, you can have a look at the output of the "route" command to check the current settings
