2008-10-04T12:02:00.000Z	Lul2x		Hi. I would like to set up a web server to host my own blog and also use this server to host files that I can access from other computers on my network. I know I can do the latter with Ubuntu Desktop version, but I was wondering if I would be better-off going with the Server version for my needs. What is the main difference between these two? Thanks!
