2009-02-16T22:45:00.000Z	maximu_s		anyone had problems with k3b, that shouts that filenames are too long? (max 16 chars?)
2009-02-16T22:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	maximu_s	well you may have to activate rack ridge and joliet extensions if you want larger filenames
2009-02-16T22:46:00.000Z	maximu_s	erUSUL	strange because the options you mention are checked
