2010-07-21T07:24:00.000Z	uRock	D3RGPS31	I am not sure that is possible
2010-07-21T07:34:00.000Z	uRock	D3RGPS31	you can't set BIOS to boot automatically from DVD ROM or you want to be able to leave the disk in? Just curious
2010-07-21T07:34:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	uRock	I am lazy, and just want the option on the grub2 menu
