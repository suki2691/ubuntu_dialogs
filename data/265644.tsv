2006-04-23T05:58:00.000Z	spikeb	m_0_r_0_n	yes. system menu, administration, login screen setup, security tab
2006-04-23T06:00:00.000Z	spikeb	m_0_r_0_n	oops, it's the accessability tab, not the security tab
2006-04-23T06:03:00.000Z	spikeb	m_0_r_0_n	preferences, sound, sound events tab, scroll way down until you see log in
