2008-01-13T14:48:00.000Z	TheDarkKiller		Hey, GRUB does not work on my dualboot installation. I have 2 harddrives, 1 XP and 1 Ubuntu. XP was installed beforehand. I installed Ubuntu on the new harddrive using the normal livecd, and followed the wizard. Now, when I boot up, it says: "GRUB loading stage1.5... GRUB loading, please wait... Error 2". I've tried reinstalling, restoring GRUB, nothing works. Some help would be great :)
2008-01-13T14:49:00.000Z	TheDarkKiller		It just seems like GRUB doesn't see the stage1 and stage2 files. Why, I have no idea.
