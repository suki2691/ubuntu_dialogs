2007-05-14T12:43:00.000Z	maaike		I am new to Ubuntu and have a question about an external harddrive: when I plug it in, I can read from it but can't write to it. The error message says that I am not a root user but it also does not ask me for a password
2007-05-14T12:43:00.000Z	maaike		there is no damage, works fine under windows
2007-05-14T12:44:00.000Z	Soundless	maaike	try the NTFS tool from automatix
