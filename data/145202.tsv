2007-04-04T07:11:00.000Z	atoponce	doseryder	do you want to kill X, or just get into a usable terminal?
2007-04-04T07:11:00.000Z	doseryder	atoponce	something like that, I know i did it before can't remember what the argument for init
2007-04-04T07:12:00.000Z	atoponce	doseryder	if you just want to get to a terminal, do 'ctrl-alt-f1' to get back to X 'ctrl-alt-f7'
