2011-07-08T14:10:00.000Z	dyd	beli	if i go to "places" and chose "40 gb filesystem" i just see a few folders, but nothing about all linux folders
2011-07-08T14:14:00.000Z	beli	dyd	so you tried to dd over the whole disc not just a partition? and you are able to see the folders on your windows partitions and not your linux partition and folders? or how is your hdd setup?
2011-07-08T14:17:00.000Z	dyd	beli	a little story: i had my 500 hd with xp installed on, then i wanted to try ubuntu and used wubi to install it on this old 40gb hd, soon it became too small so made a dd of all my 40gb in an img file, then i dd this image in my new 160gb hd and resized the partition. Now i'm in ubuntu with the new hd, but if i try to browse the 40 gb filesystem i can't see nothing else than a few folders
