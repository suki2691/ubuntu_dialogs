2008-06-11T12:23:00.000Z	Uplink		why does my FireFox crash? it gives me that message when i track it down "Segmentation fault"
2008-06-11T12:23:00.000Z	Metatron	Uplink	seg faults are "usually" hardware related, but not always and be a nightmare to track down
2008-06-11T12:23:00.000Z	Metatron		trying testing your memory
2008-06-11T12:24:00.000Z	Uplink	Metatron	its a firefox 3 bug... i know that becuase FF 2 doesnt do that to me
