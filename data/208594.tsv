2005-11-16T15:36:00.000Z	mustard5	onispawn	automounting windows drive script? or something else?
2005-11-16T15:37:00.000Z	onispawn	mustard5	kind of. I have a usb harddrive that is fat32. it automounts as read only so if I want to write to it I have to umount it and mount it again manually. I would like to avoid doing that and just have it automount as r/w
