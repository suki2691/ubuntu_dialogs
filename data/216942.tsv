2006-02-28T14:47:00.000Z	pescez		what if ubuntu-calendar images are not shown in the desktop config window?
2006-02-28T14:48:00.000Z	pescez		i installed either ubuntu-calendar and the images packages...
2006-02-28T14:49:00.000Z	_jason	pescez	they should be in /usr/share/backgrounds/
2006-02-28T14:52:00.000Z	_jason	pescez	I think you could just set your background to be /usr/share/backgrounds/ubuntu-calendar.jpg and it would get updated every month with the new package, but I never actually used it before they stopped updating so I am just speculating
