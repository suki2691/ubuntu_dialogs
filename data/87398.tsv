2008-11-20T21:23:00.000Z	ompaul	MacGyverNL	ehh read my comment again - ntfs reading using ubuntu is in factoids here
2008-11-20T21:27:00.000Z	MacGyverNL	ompaul	Yes, but if you ask that question in ##Windows, we do answer. That's what I meant. It was also directed at fde's "they will laugh at him."
2008-11-20T21:27:00.000Z	MacGyverNL	ompaul	Apologies for the confusion.
