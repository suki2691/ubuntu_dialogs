2010-07-07T07:38:00.000Z	craigbass1976		I'v eused testdisk to try and recover some files that lived on an ntfs partition.  I wiped this partition and installed linux.  Doing a deep scan, I cna see the partition, but when I hit P to list files, I get "Can't open filesystem. Filesystem seems damaged."  Is that the sound of my goose cooking?

2010-07-07T07:41:00.000Z	craigbass1976	bodzilla	that was my feeling...  It happened a couple months ago, and I never booted again, think I might be able to recover some stuff when I got round to it.  Oh well...
2010-07-07T07:42:00.000Z	bodzilla	craigbass1976	 usually I see people get the best results by not booting in to the damage and running a live cd, I have never had to do it though so I'm just passing what I have seen on the UF
