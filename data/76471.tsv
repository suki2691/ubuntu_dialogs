2009-12-30T06:50:00.000Z	cmwslw		ive tried suspend/hibernation on 3 different computers and none work - am I just unlucky?
2009-12-30T06:51:00.000Z	woodyjlw	cmwslw	 are they all alptops
2009-12-30T06:54:00.000Z	woodyjlw	cmwslw	 if you are running on laptops or notebooks suspend and hibernation is not very good, I have been running ubuntu since 7.04 and I am on 8.10 now. I can not run any higher than 8.10 or my suspend is broke
2009-12-30T06:55:00.000Z	woodyjlw	cmwslw	 you may try to install 8.04 or 8.10 and see if that works
