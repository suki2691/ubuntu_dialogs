2010-02-07T07:46:00.000Z	IronRoses		giving ubuntu a go
2010-02-07T07:46:00.000Z	IronRoses		ok, so i goit ATI drivers working (the offical drivers from the ati site instead of the crap that ubuntu gives you) and got crossover and steam running just fine too
2010-02-07T07:47:00.000Z	IronRoses		my only pro0blem is with crossover and banshee. Crossover steals the sound module from every other applicationl is there a fix for this anywhere?
