2009-03-17T17:39:00.000Z	SuperLag	Akkernight	that's what I was just going to say: which gcc <-- run that
2009-03-17T17:40:00.000Z	SuperLag	Akkernight	if you run "which gcc" from the command line, it will tell you where it got installed to
2009-03-17T17:40:00.000Z	SuperLag	Akkernight	you can use "which" with any command, to find out where it is
