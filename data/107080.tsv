2008-02-06T09:14:00.000Z	nathan42100_		question: for ubuntu's install partition resizer thing, the data on it should still be in tact, just in a smaller drive, correct?
2008-02-06T09:14:00.000Z	nathan42100_		"drive"
2008-02-06T09:15:00.000Z	nathan42100_		why does no one answer my question?
2008-02-06T09:15:00.000Z	Starnestommy	nathan42100_	if you didn't resize it too much, it should be fine
