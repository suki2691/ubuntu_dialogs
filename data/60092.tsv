2011-04-30T18:00:00.000Z	Datz		hi, is there a way to upgrade to 11.04 without unity, more of a minimal upgrade?
2011-04-30T18:02:00.000Z	Datz		I don't know how large the Unity package is, but I'd like to avoid downloading it, during the upgrade

2011-04-30T18:03:00.000Z	Datz	alienkid10	ah, ok I'll look into that, thanks
