2006-01-15T12:41:00.000Z	kkathman		good day - just did an adept update, rebooted and have no connectivity to my network (system is up and running).. dhclient eth0 shows no discovery, no leases - sleeping
2006-01-15T12:41:00.000Z	kkathman		could someone offer some ideas on how to possibly rectify this>
2006-01-15T12:42:00.000Z	kkathman		btw pinging my gateway gives Network is unreachable
2006-01-15T12:42:00.000Z	trappist	kkathman	if you ifconfig eth0 does it show an ip address?
