2006-01-23T07:03:00.000Z	CyberSlug		I have recently tried to compile a number of different versions of the kernel - they compile fine, and using mkinitrd I can get the init file - but when I try to load it it complains about missing modules : module not found: /lib/modules/.../modules.dep not found - Unable to sync (or something like that)... Does anyone know what the problem is?
2006-01-23T07:05:00.000Z	CyberSlug		Anyone have any ideas?
