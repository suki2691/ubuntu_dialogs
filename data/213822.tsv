2007-12-10T05:17:00.000Z	dablueman		very well, why is it that only security bugs get fixed in ubuntu and not other bugs
2007-12-10T05:17:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	dablueman	All get fixed.
2007-12-10T05:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	dablueman	most of us don't actually memorize thousands of bug ID numbers, believe it or not.
