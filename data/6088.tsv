2012-01-30T08:39:00.000Z	Matt393727		How do I see my /home drive from windows? I have installed the ext2/3 driver but the drive is not  appearing?
2012-01-30T08:40:00.000Z	acerimmer	Matt393727	from a wubi installation of ubuntu?
2012-01-30T08:41:00.000Z	Matt393727	acerimmer	brilliant! will try. I want to backup my /home before I reinstall
2012-01-30T08:41:00.000Z	acerimmer	Matt393727	whoa, son!  I was NOT suggesting a wubi installation!
