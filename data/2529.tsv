2012-06-12T23:23:00.000Z	hotmedal		I have a problem: When I connect my LAN on my laptop and create a new wifi network to share the internet, it connects to the wireless then disconnects immediately. I may have changed some configuration files in the past.
2012-06-12T23:23:00.000Z	hotmedal		how do I troubleshoot that?
2012-06-12T23:24:00.000Z	hotmedal		sudo: /var/log/syslog: command not found
2012-06-12T23:25:00.000Z	A0D	hotmedal	sudo echo /var/log/syslog
