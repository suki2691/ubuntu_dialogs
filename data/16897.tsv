2011-03-15T01:43:00.000Z	PastorEd	tortoise7	hmm... what do you mean 'recovery option'?
2011-03-15T01:45:00.000Z	tortoise7	PastorEd	the grub comes up automatically for me..
2011-03-15T01:46:00.000Z	PastorEd	tortoise7	hmm, I don't think I can help, other than to suggest booting with a LiveCD, and seeing if you can check your grub2 install that way...
