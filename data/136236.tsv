2009-05-01T04:44:00.000Z	Gnea	TuNiX20	as opposed to bad experience? what's your question?
2009-05-01T05:05:00.000Z	Gnea	TuNiX20	it's better not to confuse specific wireless hardware with 'all' hardware
2009-05-01T05:05:00.000Z	Gnea	TuNiX20	perhaps you've got a specific list of hardware that you've discovered that ubuntu just isn't working right with that you'd like to share
