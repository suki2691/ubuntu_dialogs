2008-08-07T20:08:00.000Z	AzizLight	RussianPhysicsGu	no firefox is ff2, it updates the latest version of ff2 not ff3
2008-08-07T20:09:00.000Z	RussianPhysicsGu	AzizLight	alright, my bad then - it depends on how the developers choose to manage the updates, then, so it's different for different programs.
2008-08-07T20:10:00.000Z	AzizLight	RussianPhysicsGu	yeah. They created a different package named firefox-3.0. You can check apt-cache search firefox or aptitude search firefox
