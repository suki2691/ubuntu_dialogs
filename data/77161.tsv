2008-11-06T22:27:00.000Z	titon		i'm thinking if i should downgrade to 8.04 just for compiz to run....is it worth the downgrade?

2008-11-06T22:29:00.000Z	dulak	titon	I can't get compiz working on 8.10 but I am not downgrading, I work on my computer, eye candy is nice and all, but work is the most important bit to me so I am not downgrading
