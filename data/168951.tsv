2008-12-10T07:53:00.000Z	Yamikuronue		[21:28] <Yamikuronue> I reinstalled ubuntu after it was working (long story, was trying to do something that didn't work so I ended up reformatting again) and now the desktop won't load. I'm very much unfamiliar with the command line... can anyone help me figure out how to get it back up?
