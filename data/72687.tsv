2009-03-20T19:49:00.000Z	akahige1		I was just dealing with today's repo updates and one of them was Thunderbird. the description said it was a transitional package before the new name. I can't find anything at all about T-bird being renamed. Anybody know what's up?

2009-03-20T19:52:00.000Z	akahige1	tritium	thanks for the clarification
2009-03-20T19:52:00.000Z	tritium	akahige1	sure.
