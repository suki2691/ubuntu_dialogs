2006-08-14T10:53:00.000Z	JymmmEMC		I don't need to print. From within synaptic, right click remove hplip, then it says it needs to remove ununtu-desktop. is that right?
2006-08-14T10:53:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	JymmmEMC	Ubuntu-desktop is a package that installs other packages. Most people want hplip, so they put it as a dependency for ubuntu-desktop

2006-08-14T11:18:00.000Z	JymmmEMC	kitsuneofdoom	harisund : Thanks for the help. I have to install ununtu on a laptop too, so I'll try removing ununto-desktop on that install and see how sadistic it gets =)
