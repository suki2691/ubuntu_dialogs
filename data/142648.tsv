2007-03-15T14:45:00.000Z	XubuntuLover	nolimitsoya_	I wrote a... reasdonably complex, script to run WoW under Wine, with all kinds of tweaks to start it in its own session and such for both bragging rights, best performance, and convineience. But every time I start the script, it prompts me for "Run" "View" "Cancel". and a box that asks. "Do this every tine with this TYPE of file". I want THIS file run in a terminal every time, but certaintly not all scripts by default.
