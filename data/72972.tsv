2012-06-14T02:16:00.000Z	mickster04	kingnebex	why do you think that's a problem? how new is your pc?
2012-06-14T02:21:00.000Z	mickster04	kingnebex	it probably isn't related to how full your hdd is, but the speed at which it can read and write data...and other things...get a terminal open (ctrl+alt+T perhaps?)
