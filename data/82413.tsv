2011-06-13T00:43:00.000Z	gizmobay		I'm having a problem with sudo hanging. I enter sudo and command and it just goes to the next line and flashes as it doesn't ask for a prompt.

2011-06-13T00:44:00.000Z	gizmobay		Don't want to reboot
2011-06-13T00:44:00.000Z	guntbert	gizmobay	tell us the command you entered
