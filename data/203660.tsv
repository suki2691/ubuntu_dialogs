2005-12-22T06:05:00.000Z	flankk	ArkticWolf	I have, and came up with nothing.  Lots of stuff about podcasting, which is easy as pie.  I can't just write a bash script because there are playlist databases on the ipod that need to be edited.  gtkpod uses them.. but doesn't deal with podcasts.  I'd like to think this would be a common question..
