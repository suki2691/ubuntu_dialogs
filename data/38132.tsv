As soon as I upgraded to Ubuntu 10.04, the headset no longer pairs on either of the PCs. It doesn't even try to connect — when I select the headset in the list to pair with, it bombs out saying "Setting up 'X5 Stereo v1.3' failed".

2010-07-10T17:16:00.000Z	jayvee	Dupper	I am not going to downgrade to 9.10, because that would regress my graphics performance severely.
