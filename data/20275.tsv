2011-01-18T03:51:00.000Z	cellardoor	ubu_ply	do you have any form of desktop special-effects enabled?
2011-01-18T03:52:00.000Z	ubu_ply	cellardoor	I only have Metacity compositing, I think, I checked in Ubuntu Tweak and I turned off active and inactive window transparency
2011-01-18T03:54:00.000Z	cellardoor	ubu_ply	does Blender have any form of config relating to its appearance anywhere?
