2010-04-10T21:39:00.000Z	norbi905		I'm trying to mount a USB stick on ubuntu 9.10.  I create a directory in /media/usb .  I see device /dev/sdb which I think is my usb.  What arguments do I pass to mount /dev/sdb /media/usb?  For some reason it's not getting auto-mounted :(

2010-04-10T21:44:00.000Z	norbi905	LITESTER_	dmesg shows FAT:invalid media value(0x00) VFS: Can't find a valid FAT filesystem on dev sdb.
2010-04-10T21:44:00.000Z	norbi905	LITESTER_	should I format?
