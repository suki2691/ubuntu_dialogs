2008-02-08T23:26:00.000Z	maximilion		Hello again :) Dad visited today and saw my OSX style Ubuntu, and wanted Linux on his Compaq P3 1.1GHz+256M RAM+integrated Radeon gfx card... is there any hope for him?
2008-02-08T23:28:00.000Z	XLV	maximilion	sure.. though the ram is a bit on the low side for kde/gnome
2008-02-08T23:29:00.000Z	XLV	maximilion	its just standard sdram
2008-02-08T23:29:00.000Z	maximilion	XLV	Not on Compaqs they aren't... I've been through all that ;)
