2008-12-01T05:01:00.000Z	Draco4King		How can I setup a simple insecure (yeah, i know) FTP server with a regular Intrepid Ibex install?
2008-12-01T05:03:00.000Z	Draco4King		also, does anyone know how to clear screwy package downloads from the apt-get install?
2008-12-01T05:04:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	Draco4King	are you looking for sudo apt-get clean ?
2008-12-01T05:05:00.000Z	Draco4King	zsquareplusc	most likely, thanks
