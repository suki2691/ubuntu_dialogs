2008-06-12T02:36:00.000Z	kyncani	Darlok_Williams	you use ls and grep. You will need to read some docs about it though
2008-06-12T02:37:00.000Z	Darlok_Williams	kyncani	Yeah, I figured it was something like that... but I don't know how to make grep work in reverse ;)
2008-06-12T02:38:00.000Z	kyncani	Darlok_Williams	yep, you do need to read some basic grep howto.
