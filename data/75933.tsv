2009-01-21T02:54:00.000Z	temppy	bakermd	you can remove openoffice.  Does that work for you?
2009-01-21T02:54:00.000Z	bakermd	temppy	Unfortunately, no.  I am doing a preseed network load to clients with small disks and need OpenOffice to be excluded
2009-01-21T02:56:00.000Z	temppy	bakermd	well, I suspect you could install the server edition, and then install whatever else you want manually
