2011-09-25T01:56:00.000Z	KM0201	dfcnvt	that plugin wouldn't even make sense
2011-09-25T01:58:00.000Z	dfcnvt	KM0201	sure it does. it's for visual reception to pick things up very quickly instead, being lost or trying to find the phrase somewhere in the text. (beside I think this plugin would be very interesting to observe)
