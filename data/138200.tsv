2009-10-24T04:13:00.000Z	MarkGil		Real obvious question time, but one I can't figure out.  How do I tell (from CLI) from version of a program I have
2009-10-24T04:13:00.000Z	MarkGil		apt-cache search xxxx does not tell me
2009-10-24T04:14:00.000Z	usser	MarkGil	most program have -v or --version switch
2009-10-24T04:15:00.000Z	usser	MarkGil	ie wine --version will tell you the version
