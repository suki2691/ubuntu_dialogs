2009-01-04T00:28:00.000Z	douwe		Hi, I just installed intrepid 64 bits on a new machine, and now pulseaudio crashes after playing sound for a while (flash, mplayer and mpd all caused the problem at least once). When this happens pavucontrol says it can connect anymore and the easiest way to get things working again is by restarting x, after which it usually crashes again after a while. Does anyone know what to do?
