2009-10-30T21:07:00.000Z	mdmkolbe		How do I get a list (as text file) of programs that I've directly asked Synaptic to install?  (i.e. I don't want packages that were only installed because they were dependancies)
2009-10-30T21:07:00.000Z	gOLDfeesh	mdmkolbe	I beleive there's an option to export the list of installed software
2009-10-30T21:09:00.000Z	gOLDfeesh		Alright so I ran "dist-upgrade"  and it only wanted to download 10MB? http://pastebin.com/d6acf35be
2009-10-30T21:10:00.000Z	mdmkolbe	gOLDfeesh	I don't see an option like that
