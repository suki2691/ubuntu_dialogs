2009-01-10T09:03:00.000Z	marabout	bastid_raZor	I am referring to copying the iso onto the hard drive to get it to run off of the hard drive
2009-01-10T09:06:00.000Z	marabout	bastid_raZor	the machine in question (emachine 600ix) cannot boot from the USB. someone mentioned getting Ubuntu onto a hard drive and then just putting that HD into the machine. I am unclear if it needs to be actually 'installed' on the HD or can it be the disc image, e.g.  the iso
2009-01-10T09:09:00.000Z	marabout	bastid_raZor	what do you know about via a floppy disc. if I could just get something on there I imagine I can then download via the internet....
