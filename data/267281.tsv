2010-03-07T08:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	javatexan	 since the last .# is differnt the 2 should be able to coexist on the same system.
2010-03-07T08:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	javatexan	 or you could recompile the app to use the newer lib.
2010-03-07T09:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	javatexan	 never heard/noticed anything about it to be honest.  cant recall any explosive debates on it in here.
