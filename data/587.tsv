2012-10-30T13:55:00.000Z	gour		does ubuntu support xfce DE or one should use xubuntu?
2012-10-30T13:56:00.000Z	gour		atm i installed linux mint (xfce), but some people asking me why not ubuntu which might have more features and support
2012-10-30T13:56:00.000Z	aiFrantz	gour	: yes.. just install the xubuntu package and you can choose the xfce session on startup
