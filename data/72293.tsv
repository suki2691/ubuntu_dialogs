2008-12-03T18:34:00.000Z	zamba		is there a tool that implements the most common hashing functions? i need to figure out what function has been used to create a hash, so i need to visually compare them
2008-12-03T18:35:00.000Z	rlt	zamba	openssl. See man openssl.
2008-12-03T18:36:00.000Z	zamba	rlt	it implements all the different hashing functions?
2008-12-03T18:38:00.000Z	rlt	zamba	there's a full list of functions it implements in the man page. Looks like it does to me.
