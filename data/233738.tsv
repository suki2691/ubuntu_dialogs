2005-06-07T14:41:00.000Z	slawek		I've just found a directory /.Trash-root. du reports it eats up 6GB of space... can I delete it?
2005-06-07T14:42:00.000Z	jdodson	slawek	sure.  its basically the trash bin for the root account.
2005-06-07T14:44:00.000Z	slawek	jdodson	but the curious thing is, how come it's so big.. it contans folders like bin, bin (copy), usr, usr (copy)... it seems that entire tree got copied to this trash two times!
2005-06-07T14:45:00.000Z	slawek	jdodson	but thanks for the answer i'll delete it right away
