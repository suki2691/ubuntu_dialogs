2011-08-23T10:05:00.000Z	anth0ny		looking for recommendations on a good program to code in when using Ubuntu.  I'm currently using gedit but would like something that could collapse large amounts of lines and also save projects (ie, open a file that automatically opens 5 documents), along with the standard coding features (coloring, replace all tool, line numbers).  Any ideas?

2011-08-23T10:06:00.000Z	anth0ny		so many options... going to look into geany and nedit
