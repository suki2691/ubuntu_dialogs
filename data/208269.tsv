2005-12-27T08:31:00.000Z	frogzoo	Xenguy	to get evolution to work with exchange, it seems you need the exchange admin's cooperation to get it set up
2005-12-27T08:32:00.000Z	Xenguy	frogzoo	I tried once today and got it working, but haven't had much of a chance to play yet
2005-12-27T08:32:00.000Z	Xenguy	frogzoo	it doesn't seem an admin is necessary in my situation tho
