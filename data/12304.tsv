2012-05-19T19:27:00.000Z	hapster		so will ubuntu wait for at least a stable wayland release (stable in a sense that wine and most common apps will run flawlessly) or will they just go ahead and let developers adjust? haha
2012-05-19T19:28:00.000Z	hapster		because the way I understand it is ubuntu won't have Xorg out of the box when they shift to wayland.
