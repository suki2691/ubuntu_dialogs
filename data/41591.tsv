2011-11-18T02:17:00.000Z	cloudy_nz		Hi geoffmcc , sorry I meant I'm in 11.10 and trap is meant to be a bash builtin
2011-11-18T02:17:00.000Z	cloudy_nz		however, I can't find trap with "which trap" and it doesn't appear to be installed
2011-11-18T02:18:00.000Z	ssta	cloudy_nz	trap is a bash builtin.  man builtins
2011-11-18T02:18:00.000Z	cloudy_nz	ssta	thank you!
