2006-12-27T12:36:00.000Z	erpo	XiXaQ	Edit /etc/inittab
2006-12-27T12:36:00.000Z	erpo	XiXaQ	Yeah, actually, try recovery mode first. If that doesn't meet your needs, then edit inittab to change your runlevel.
2006-12-27T12:45:00.000Z	XiXaQ	erpo	I'm on edgy. I have two edgy installations and none of them have /etc/inittab?
