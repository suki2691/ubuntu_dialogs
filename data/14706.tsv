2011-05-03T22:32:00.000Z	miceiken		what is /dev/sde1? When I start the GRUB boot loader it seems like there are like 20 OSes
2011-05-03T22:32:00.000Z	ejv	miceiken	different kernel versions?
2011-05-03T22:33:00.000Z	miceiken	ejv	they're all 11.04
2011-05-03T22:33:00.000Z	miceiken	ejv	probably because of all the installs i attempted? many says they are in recovery mode, and their dir is /dev/sde1
