2007-05-11T09:36:00.000Z	ExxKA		Hey Guys.. Whats the difference between LTS and std editions, except the support times?
2007-05-11T09:37:00.000Z	chump	ExxKA	lts will be updated for a longer period of time
2007-05-11T09:38:00.000Z	ExxKA	chump	and less fancy stuff, right? But how about HW support?
2007-05-11T09:39:00.000Z	chump	ExxKA	well i guess you can always update the kernel for hw support .. but i'm not to sure about it...
