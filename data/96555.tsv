2008-03-24T19:41:00.000Z	bartmon		Hey guys. Is there a reason why the Ubuntu liveCD installer doesn't want to mount anything other than ext3?
2008-03-24T19:41:00.000Z	buttterz	bartmon	, are you trying to repair a volume?
2008-03-24T19:43:00.000Z	bartmon	buttterz	No, i'm installing on an already partitioned disk. I wanted to use reiserfs for /boot and / but if i choose anything other than ext3 for the 2  the installer complains that it can't mount them and returns me to the partition setup.
2008-03-24T19:43:00.000Z	buttterz	bartmon	, i'm not sure you can -- are you in a graphical installation?
