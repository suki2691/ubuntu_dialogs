2006-08-06T09:41:00.000Z	stefg	it1957	so this happens when you try to boot without any additional parameters?

2006-08-06T09:46:00.000Z	stefg	it1957	compaq sometimes has a strange way of setting the master/slave things up with cable select. Might be that the Bios and the kernel cannot agree on the IDE handling. Testing with switched of DMA might also help
