2009-02-21T07:10:00.000Z	Banjo_		<Banjo_>Hello, i just downloaded Ubuntu and need http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/wifi-radar to setup wireless internet on it. The only problem is i can't download it while running linux because i can't setup wifi, is there a way to download it using windows where i have internet and open it when i run Ubuntu? So sharing files in a way with 2 different OS.
