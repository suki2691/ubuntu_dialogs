2009-01-02T18:42:00.000Z	Moose		I have a Windows partition on the same hard drive as my Ubuntu partition. I want to back the Windows partition (but only the 130 GB in use) to an external drive. I need to do this from Ubuntu.
2009-01-02T18:42:00.000Z	Moose		Any suggestions?
2009-01-02T18:43:00.000Z	Stormx2	Moose	So you want to back up some files, yeah?
2009-01-02T18:43:00.000Z	Moose	Stormx2	I want to back up only the files that are in use, yes. I don't want to write 500 GB to the external, as it's only 250 GB in size.
