2009-02-14T20:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	codazoda	 no rc.local just gets ran at boot up.
2009-02-14T20:22:00.000Z	codazoda	Dr_willis	Perfect, that's what I suspected.  Is there another place I should put a command that needs to run on wake?
2009-02-14T20:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	codazoda	 proberly. but i dont know of it off hand. I recall some similer things with hdparm in some docs/wiki pages i read ages ago.
