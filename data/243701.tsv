2005-05-15T13:11:00.000Z	Cicada		I am having a problem transferring files between my Ubuntu video server at a remote location  and a windoze box in my studio... I am using ssh but can oly get speeds of around 10kbits/s my dsl upload is 256kbit/s and the remote server has a download of 24000kbit/s  they are both with the same ISP, both on the same telephone excahnge...
2005-05-15T13:11:00.000Z	Cicada		any idea on where to start to diagnise this... i have been stuffing around fro days
2005-05-15T13:11:00.000Z	Nula	Cicada	that's reasonable upstreamm for 256k
2005-05-15T13:15:00.000Z	Nula	Cicada	your max theoretical bandwidth is around 30-35kBYTEs a second
