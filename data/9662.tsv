2011-10-16T17:26:00.000Z	zromayn		hya: I just installed the new release 11.10 server and whenever I try either halting or shutting down the system, it would just get stuck in the "system is now halted" and the machine won't power off. has anybody seen this? If so, is there any solution available?
2011-10-16T17:27:00.000Z	jatt	zromayn	yes I have seen it, I always needed to switch to a console with alt+f1, log in as root and then run poweroff
2011-10-16T17:28:00.000Z	zromayn	jatt	do you still have to do that?
2011-10-16T17:29:00.000Z	jatt	zromayn	no after I run xfce
