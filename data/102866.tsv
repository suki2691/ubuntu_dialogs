2008-01-27T18:35:00.000Z	roy_		I have a question abt the compiz-settings-manager
2008-01-27T18:35:00.000Z	roy_		does it save the settings into a text file somewhere?
2008-01-27T18:36:00.000Z	roy_		while editing the compiz settings I accidentally made one of the "Super+Tab" hotkeys into "Delete", and now I can't set it back to "Super+Tab" and my Delete Key doesn't work :p
