2006-10-01T14:52:00.000Z	karim		is there a network hotpluging system ? because actually on linux you need to do an ifup if you connect a newtork cable after the boot sequence
2006-10-01T14:53:00.000Z	kitche	karim	actually it is a service in windows also you just don't notice it
2006-10-01T14:54:00.000Z	karim	kitche	I wonder why it's not been done in linux. windows have 7 years of advance on this level
