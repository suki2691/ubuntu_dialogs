2009-01-03T08:03:00.000Z	Mike_92		Can someone please help me? For some reason, after I come back from hibernate mode, I find myself to be disconnected from Pidgin. I realized that upon hibernating, I loose Internet connection, I even see the light go off on my router for the Ethernet port I'm connected to. Does anyone know if there's a way to make it so I don't loose Internet connection when going into Hibernate?
