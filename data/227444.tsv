2010-06-26T22:37:00.000Z	zamba		i have both a stereo output and a hdmi output on my computer.. am i able to configure pulseaudio so that i can output sound on both devices at the same time?
2010-06-26T22:37:00.000Z	zamba		is that at all possible?
2010-06-26T22:38:00.000Z	test34	zamba	it probably depend on your sound card
2010-06-26T22:39:00.000Z	test34	zamba	but probably not... you probably need to get another sound card/device
