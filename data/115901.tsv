2007-10-22T02:23:00.000Z	MaxRandor		my gutsy upgrade failed before completion while installing software update-manager and aptoncd failed to install and then it quit
2007-10-22T02:24:00.000Z	MaxRandor		how do I find out whether my failed gusty upgrade will work or explode in my face?
2007-10-22T02:24:00.000Z	asbani	MaxRandor	are you trying to upgrade from gutsy beta to gutsy final, or feisty to gutsy?
2007-10-22T02:26:00.000Z	asbani	MaxRandor	people might shout at me telling you this, but I'd recommend a fresh gutsy install, download gutsy.iso and do a fresh install :)
