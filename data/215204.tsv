2005-10-03T07:53:00.000Z	bobbobbob		I am trying to install realplayer but when I type in the command line it just says could not find package.  This is true for everything I try to install and the ubuntu guide does not tell me where i can find the packages.
2005-10-03T07:55:00.000Z	bobbobbob		how the fuck do I install realplayer or any other player that supports mpg files for that matter
2005-10-03T07:55:00.000Z	cat	bobbobbob	apt-get install realplayer
2005-10-03T07:56:00.000Z	bobbobbob	cat	I tried that, it says it cannot find package realplayer
