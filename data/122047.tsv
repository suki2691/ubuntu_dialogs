2007-09-14T14:57:00.000Z	Jowi	Sajes	yes. do you have both installed or just one and want to install the other?
2007-09-14T14:57:00.000Z	Sajes	Jowi	I have just Gnome installed. How do I install KDE?
2007-09-14T14:58:00.000Z	Jowi	Sajes	"sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop" is the easiest way. then log out, chose kde as a session then log in. you can also install kde piece by piece but that I won't go into :)
