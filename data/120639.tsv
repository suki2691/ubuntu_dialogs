2008-02-10T09:41:00.000Z	Ashnal		so ive found something that annoys me, which is that if im playing music of some sort, and my computer comes under a heavy processing load, the music will skip, is there a way to prevent this?
2008-02-10T09:42:00.000Z	Ashnal		except an older computer with a motherboard that doesnt support a dual core
2008-02-10T09:43:00.000Z	Ashnal		so theres no way to give sound output priority over other things always?
2008-02-10T09:44:00.000Z	danbhfive	Ashnal	how about nice values?
