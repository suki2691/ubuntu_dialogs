2006-05-27T09:32:00.000Z	trelayne		question, what is hot about installing reiserfs versus any other format?
2006-05-27T09:33:00.000Z	trelayne		I know that ext3 has good recovery.. does reiser have better speed?
2006-05-27T09:34:00.000Z	trelayne		I know that ReWT_AxS used ReiserFS
2006-05-27T09:34:00.000Z	hexidigital_	trelayne	reiser claims to be faster, but i found on my server it was significantly slower than ext3
