2011-02-23T03:09:00.000Z	JosephKerr001		has anyone here tried to dual boot
2011-02-23T03:11:00.000Z	JosephKerr001		i'm looking into it but i'm running an older version of ubuntu, not sure if that makes any kind of difference
2011-02-23T03:12:00.000Z	JosephKerr001		the guide i was looking at was for newest version
2011-02-23T03:12:00.000Z	Jeruvy	JosephKerr001	ppl have been successfully dual-booting for a long time, do you have a support question?  If you're just looking for advise I might suggest #ubuntu-offtopic.
