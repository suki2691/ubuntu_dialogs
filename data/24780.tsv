2010-10-08T20:56:00.000Z	Valmyr		very basic question, guys. I just installed ubuntu for the first time. I started Firefox, and got to a page which needed Flash player, so it sent me to the flash download page. On the flash download page, I have a choice of which version to install, should I choose "APT for ubuntu 9.04+"?

2010-10-08T21:13:00.000Z	Valmyr	Dr_Willis	ubottu and erUSUL - I installed the ubuntu-restricted-extras package and now my Firefox shows the addon "Ubuntu Firefox Modifications 0.9rc2", however, Flash video on the BBC page will still not play.
