2009-11-13T02:22:00.000Z	infoG		hey guys, i can't install karmic because it won't recognize my hard drives. because a livecd requires a reboot, i can't boot livecd, run an update and then try to install with fixes (since a reboot clears it ofc)
2009-11-13T02:22:00.000Z	infoG		is it possible to install ubuntu to a new partition from windows? i might be able to run an update first

2009-11-13T02:23:00.000Z	infoG	ZenMasta	ok, thx
