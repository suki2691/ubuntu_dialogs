2010-09-26T23:05:00.000Z	swiftarrow	x0rs	why don't you just right click on it and remove panel?
2010-09-26T23:06:00.000Z	x0rs	swiftarrow	it isn't a secondary panel, it's the primary one, and it isn't removable... that option is greyed out
2010-09-26T23:08:00.000Z	swiftarrow	x0rs	how about gconf-editor
