2008-04-25T06:41:00.000Z	Roscar		ok, I've got a question. Does Ubuntu release a list of changes since 7.10?
2008-04-25T06:42:00.000Z	taxman	Roscar	http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/804features is that what you meant?
2008-04-25T06:43:00.000Z	Roscar		pelo: that doesn't work.
2008-04-25T06:43:00.000Z	Roscar	taxman	I'm looking for changes since, not features in general. I'm hoping to find out reasons why I should migrate.
