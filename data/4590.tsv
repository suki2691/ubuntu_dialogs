2012-04-27T08:54:00.000Z	ItsMeLenny	A|i3N	the gnome classic interface is buggy you're probably better of getting http://mate-desktop.org
2012-04-27T08:59:00.000Z	A|i3N	ItsMeLenny	- Do you have any idea? I just want my menu bar back. I don't mind using the default desktop, I just want the usual listing of installed applications and system settings, etc
2012-04-27T09:00:00.000Z	ItsMeLenny	A|i3N	 i dunno what you're talking about
