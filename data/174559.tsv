2008-04-27T21:34:00.000Z	J_Doe		Are there any reported problems with the Internet connection? Whenever I load something from the Internet, be it via apt-get, Firefox, Gnome-Updater, the system becomes veeeery sluggish. Even the mouse starts dragging.
2008-04-27T21:34:00.000Z	J_Doe		Any ideas what it could be?
