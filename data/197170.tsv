2010-04-25T12:29:00.000Z	ShazbotMcNasty		I need to delete my swap, can I create a new swap later?
2010-04-25T12:29:00.000Z	ShazbotMcNasty		there can be 4 primary partitions on a disk right?
2010-04-25T12:29:00.000Z	ShazbotMcNasty		and a swap needs to be a primary?
2010-04-25T12:29:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	ShazbotMcNasty	four primary but no extended, you can have 3 primary and one extended.
