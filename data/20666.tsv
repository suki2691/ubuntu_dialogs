2011-05-14T14:52:00.000Z	beecarr		Hi guys can someone tell me what printer is suitable for ubuntu linux? I have had no luck in connecting to my existing old printer
2011-05-14T14:52:00.000Z	FCGreg	beecarr	what kind of printer is it?
2011-05-14T14:53:00.000Z	FCGreg	beecarr	I've had good success with the HP 5000 series and higher- both directly connected and connected via network print hub
2011-05-14T14:53:00.000Z	FCGreg	beecarr	those tend to be problematic because they require special drivers from Dell IIRC
