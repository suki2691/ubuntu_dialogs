2009-09-18T12:30:00.000Z	RukusX	krejustin1979	for you, because you have to ask, Ubuntu
2009-09-18T12:31:00.000Z	RukusX	krejustin1979	i asked myself that same question about gnome and kde and different flavors of linux before.. and i realized if i had to ask, to go with the one that seemed the most popular among peopel who are coming from windows.
2009-09-18T12:31:00.000Z	RukusX	krejustin1979	 check out linux mint too
