2010-02-05T17:57:00.000Z	memetic		Good morning.  My system has 12gb ram (verified in bios, etc.)  I'm using Ubuntu (32, x86, i686) and it only shows 2.7GB memory.
2010-02-05T17:57:00.000Z	memetic		Do I need to use the Ubuntu amd64 version to fully utilize the extra memory, or what?
2010-02-05T17:57:00.000Z	memetic		I don't suppose I can 'upgrade' to the 64-bit version, can I?
2010-02-05T17:58:00.000Z	jrib	memetic	ify ou consider reinstall == upgrade
