2011-09-19T22:28:00.000Z	majorzoheb		when installing ubuntu, is it possible to keep files that are already on the hardrive as part of a previous OS?
2011-09-19T22:30:00.000Z	majorzoheb		Thanks!!! another quick query, Ive tried ubuntu on my hackintosh already via a usb boot, is it possible to install it alongside this macos?
