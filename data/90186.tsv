2008-05-19T05:30:00.000Z	|[Petey]|	Jack_Sparrow	the laptop is a dell d610 if that's any help. I know that when i boot this laptop in windows, there some proprietary applet that can automagically disable the wired nic if the battery's unplugged to save power... is there anyway that can be affecting this? I haven't booted into windows in quite some time though
