2009-02-03T20:16:00.000Z	LukaszJ	DragonLord-	Well, I'd start by typing "top" for the procesess, and "free -m " for memory, "top" will show it up too but in another, less readable form.

2009-02-03T20:19:00.000Z	LukaszJ	DragonLord-	Check "man top" and "man free", they provide some really useful options, like "free -ms 2", will show you memory usage with 2 sec interval, and so on.
