2007-09-06T15:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jamyskis	Did you try creating a new wireless network in network-manager?
2007-09-06T15:17:00.000Z	jamyskis	Jordan_U	i did, and all it does is disconnect my wired network connection such that i dont have internet anymore
2007-09-06T15:17:00.000Z	jamyskis	Jordan_U	and my psp doesnt find the wlan connection then anyway
