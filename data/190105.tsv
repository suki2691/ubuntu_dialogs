2006-09-24T13:32:00.000Z	Warbo	MikeHawk	If you upgrade using a package manager then no, if you reinstall then yes (unless you keep /home on a seperate partition)
2006-09-24T13:33:00.000Z	Warbo	MikeHawk	Ubuntu uses "dpkg" to handle Debian packages, and "APT" as the main package manager. There are loads of GUIs for APT (update-manager, synaptic, adept, aptitude,etc.)
