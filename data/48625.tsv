2010-06-18T05:05:00.000Z	willwork4foo		I'm going to get an SDHC card and put it into this netbook's internal reader slot and use that as my root disk
2010-06-18T05:05:00.000Z	willwork4foo		the intention is to use a solid state storage device as the root disk and NOT spin up the large storage disk unless I need it (music, video, etc)
2010-06-18T05:06:00.000Z	Daekdroom	willwork4foo	set the SSD to mount as / and the HD to /home/
2010-06-18T05:06:00.000Z	willwork4foo	Daekdroom	but that will still spin the drive up whenever I do anything that involves writing to /home
