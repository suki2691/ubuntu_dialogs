2008-11-09T05:26:00.000Z	LWATCDR		I just installed a new video card an ATI 3870. Ubuntu installed the right driver but now it will not see my monitor.
2008-11-09T05:26:00.000Z	LWATCDR		I am stuck with 640x480
2008-11-09T05:27:00.000Z	LWATCDR		Anbody know how I can get Ubuntu to find the monitor without editing xorg?
