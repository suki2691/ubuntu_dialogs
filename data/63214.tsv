2009-03-22T21:19:00.000Z	renderab		When I run update manager I get this: "W: GPG error: http://ppa.launchpad.net intrepid Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 5A9BF3BB4E5E17B5"
2009-03-22T21:21:00.000Z	renderab		ppas gpg key?  Not sure what u mean, update manager never used to give this error.  It still seems to check for updates though
2009-03-22T21:22:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	renderab	 I had this problem a while back, and I cannot remember what I did to resolve it.   "The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available"
