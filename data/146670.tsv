2007-02-11T17:23:00.000Z	CrakeHunter		i did install the "libxine-extracodecs" in order to get mp3 support but still musicbox tells me : "you do not have a decoder installed to handle this file"
2007-02-11T17:24:00.000Z	n4cht	CrakeHunter	 try mpg123 or mpg321 packages.
2007-02-11T17:24:00.000Z	CrakeHunter	n4cht	should i remove the "libxine-extracodecs2?
2007-02-11T17:24:00.000Z	n4cht	CrakeHunter	 I wouldn't bother.
