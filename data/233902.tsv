2005-06-06T07:43:00.000Z	lalo		so again :-P does anyone know what's the fancy X lock thingie in hoary?   (I'm upgrading from warty but I didn't get that one for some reason)
2005-06-06T07:43:00.000Z	lalo		I upgraded xscreensaver and it looks a bit better, but it's not the same thing my colleague has on his hoary
2005-06-06T07:44:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	lalo	why not just change the screensaver then?
2005-06-06T07:44:00.000Z	lalo	tiglionabbit	I'm not talking about the screensaver itself, but the "unlock" dialog
