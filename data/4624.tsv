2012-03-14T23:41:00.000Z	jerel		I'm needing to code a custom (quite basic) app to make outgoing voip calls to landlines/mobiles. I found sipsimple which is an extensive Python library but just wanted to ask if there was a better solution (ie shortcut).

2012-03-14T23:45:00.000Z	jerel	Zeusking19	hmm ok. I've racked my brain over where "somewhere else" could be. I thought perhaps Ekiga, Empathy, etc may provide a way to do what I need
