2007-04-03T05:18:00.000Z	SpeakerMania		Okay, another question...
2007-04-03T05:18:00.000Z	SpeakerMania		Is there any way in this known universe to build a driver for my dial-up modem if it isn't supported?
2007-04-03T05:19:00.000Z	SpeakerMania		Read that. My modem isn't supprted.
2007-04-03T05:20:00.000Z	R-800	SpeakerMania	is asking about modem support.  That was something I was going to ask about too.  I gather that modem support is probably one of the more common concerns.
