2008-08-21T04:00:00.000Z	Totakeke		So how much space should I give to each partition and where should I mount them?
2008-08-21T04:00:00.000Z	usser	Totakeke	about 10g for /, everything else for /home
2008-08-21T04:01:00.000Z	usser	Totakeke	if u have more than 2gb of RAM make swap 2gb
2008-08-21T04:03:00.000Z	usser	Totakeke	no need. when it comes to repartitioning select manual delete whatever partiotions there that u dont need, and create new ones
