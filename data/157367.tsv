2007-03-17T07:29:00.000Z	wilee85		I'm using edgy and I just installed it on my laptop with an atheros wifi card. when I try to bring up the network I get an ath0 no such device error, but it detected it during the install. does anyone have any ideas?
2007-03-17T07:31:00.000Z	Dekkard	wilee85	 have you tried en0?
2007-03-17T07:36:00.000Z	wilee85	Dekkard	no I haven't. I'm still confused as to why it would detect ath0 in the install, let me configure it, and also be active long enough to give me an update notification with 100+ upgrades, but not work
