2010-05-31T12:26:00.000Z	Xpistos		I am getting ready to do a fresh install of 10.04 but I am not sure what all I should backup. I have my home folder backed up as well as my fstab and sources.list.d. Is there anything that I am missing?
2010-05-31T12:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Xpistos	 any other config files you altered in /etc/  - i also keep backps of my xorg.conf files that work.
