2010-03-31T13:44:00.000Z	maginot	duckwars	are you using ubuntu ? Just apt-get install vlc should do the trick
2010-03-31T13:45:00.000Z	duckwars	maginot	yea I already did that, but that just installed it, it doesn't make it serve up content or install a daemon... does it?
2010-03-31T13:46:00.000Z	maginot	duckwars	well, this kind of question must be done on #videolan
