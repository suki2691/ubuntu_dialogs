2006-04-22T16:09:00.000Z	Warbo	DeMoNSeED	The only decent Shockwave I've ever found is one from the "Cat-a-pult" people!
2006-04-22T16:12:00.000Z	Warbo	DeMoNSeED	Cat-a-pult is just a funny game where you slingshot rocks at cats to whack them through doors before they kill each other. It's best when you miss the doors and they hit the wall!
2006-04-22T08:25:00.000Z	Warbo	DeMoNSeED	OK. My Wifi is bust, my routers won't talk and I can't find a pencil. But that's better than average!
