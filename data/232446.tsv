2007-07-10T07:51:00.000Z	hwcd		Gutsy Gibbon Tribe 2 live CD: on boot, it loads to a brown/orange Ubuntu background, nothing more. I am able to do a Ctl+Alt+F1 to get to a terminal
2007-07-10T07:51:00.000Z	hwcd		how can I install it, or how can I boot it into an install mode like Ubuntu used to have?
2007-07-10T07:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	hwcd	do you really need to install such an alpha release??
2007-07-10T08:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	hwcd	as i pointed out earlier for gutsy help head to #ubuntu+1 please; TIA
