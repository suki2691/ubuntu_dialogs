2005-09-15T13:31:00.000Z	ale_		ok how do i tell my debian which used to be ubuntu to install the drivers again?
2005-09-15T13:32:00.000Z	ale_		this is what happened: i had ubuntu. Then i changed the package servers to debian's. And then i did apt-get upgrade. Things are fine, but i have no sound :/
