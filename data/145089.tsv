2007-12-05T04:35:00.000Z	AngryElf		despite selection every possible option for screen resolution in dpkg-reconfiger xserver-xorg, I'm still only presented with three of them in the GUI Screen resolution -- how do I get the higher resolutions --  It's a geforce 6200, I'm sure it can do the higher ones -- using the binary driver too
