If I just boot the computer up with the ubuntu cd in it, will I get the option to format the entire harddrive so that nothing is left or do I have to make a special partition?
2010-01-03T15:12:00.000Z	maffelu		Right, but I want to wipe the entire computer and just have ubuntu, so then I just chose like "wipe all!"?
2010-01-03T15:12:00.000Z	maffelu		I have not run ubuntu, I guess I should start the computer one last time and get the specs
