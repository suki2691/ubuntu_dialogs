2006-12-15T15:19:00.000Z	reverseblade	DARKGuy	click to your time diplay at top right
2006-12-15T15:19:00.000Z	DARKGuy	reverseblade	that'd work - if I had the full ubuntu, I installed it with the alternate CD and I'm using fluxbox atm (Gnome is slooooooooow) so :/
2006-12-15T15:20:00.000Z	DARKGuy	reverseblade	besides when it installed, my timezone wasn't in the list and there was no option to choose another one though
