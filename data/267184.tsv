2009-09-08T01:02:00.000Z	Farmer		I've just installed Kubuntu on a laptop with a 1280x800 screen. However, I cannto set it to that in the system settings, as the only options are for non-widescreen aspect ratio. How can I fix this? dpkg-reconfigure does nothing and I need someone to help me step by step
2009-09-08T01:03:00.000Z	Farmer		Anybody? This is a rather urgent issue and I need a response quickly, please.
