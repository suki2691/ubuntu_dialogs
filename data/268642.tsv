2004-11-02T12:27:00.000Z	retype-s		i just finished installing ubuntu, it is really great, but it has some serious flaws also
2004-11-02T12:28:00.000Z	retype-s		no support for reiserfs in the running kernel made me lose one instalation, as I made the root partition reiserfs
2004-11-02T12:29:00.000Z	Kamion	retype-s	hm, reiserfs is modular and should end up in the initrd if you make the root partition reiserfs; I've done several installations with reiserfs /
