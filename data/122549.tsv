2007-09-26T09:30:00.000Z	Busata		hi, I just bought a new external harddrive, how do I format it in ubuntu(as it's still fat32), and give my user permission to read/write it?
2007-09-26T09:32:00.000Z	newTruth	Busata	try gparted for formatting
2007-09-26T09:32:00.000Z	Busata	newTruth	yep, just found that, but how do I allow the normal user to write read it? chmod the mount pointfolder?
2007-09-26T09:33:00.000Z	newTruth	Busata	chown maybe ?
