2010-04-02T02:35:00.000Z	n0000b		i have an HFS (journling disabled) attached to my xbmc live linux box, but can't send files to it over sftp using an sftp app cos its only read only. using terminal on my mac, i ssh into the external drive attached, and if i use sudo mv to rename a file, it also tells it cant cos its read only. i hate read only!!! is it easy to change without reformatting the drive? it's a 1tb you see......
