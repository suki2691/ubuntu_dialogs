2009-07-15T03:35:00.000Z	GnomeKing		Can anyone explain why my USB mouse doesn't work? The trackpad on the laptop works, the usb mouse is recognised by dmesg as a mouse, but it doesn't move the X cursor.  Most websites say xorg.conf should have two mouse sections - but it doesn't have any in my 9.04 yet the trackpad still works?!

2009-07-15T03:37:00.000Z	GnomeKing	neoteny	I guessed as much - I used to understand it but don't now since its so empty ;) is that info listed somewhere else?
2009-07-15T03:41:00.000Z	neoteny	GnomeKing	i'm not an expert by any means.  i just know there's a lot different now and time can be wasting applying old posts.  kinda like when kernel 2.6 was new and the only posts i could find to follow were 2.4!  fun times.
