2009-05-24T11:25:00.000Z	BonezAU		hi all, i am running 64 bit ubuntu 9.04, i have an nvidia 9600GT (512mb) graph card and am using the 64 bit flash player from the repos. as soon as I try to full screen a youtube clip or something it goes all slow and choppy. This does not happen on my laptop...only diff is I am running nvidia dualview with 2x 22" monitors. Can anyone suggest how I can improve the flash performance?

2009-05-24T11:30:00.000Z	ozzmosis	BonezAU	blame Adobe, essentially
