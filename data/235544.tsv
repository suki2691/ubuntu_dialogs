2006-04-07T05:27:00.000Z	Dr_House		i've got breezy installed and i'm trying to install windows x64 to dualboot .. i just installed windows off the CD and when it restarts, i get "operating system not found"
2006-04-07T05:28:00.000Z	Dr_House		anyone know why i can't dual boot?
2006-04-07T05:28:00.000Z	Madpilot	Dr_House	probably because Windows screwed something up - it's good at that
