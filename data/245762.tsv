2009-11-01T00:23:00.000Z	Xgates	eper3z	just not knowledge for what?
2009-11-01T00:26:00.000Z	Xgates	eper3z	well like tanath said you should use Deluge, it's very similar to uTorrent, there's not reason not to use it, my god man you're in Linux, dump that Windows app and quit messing with Wine, because Wine can get complicated if you are not experienced... :)
