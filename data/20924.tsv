2011-01-04T17:01:00.000Z	gosevan		I'm running Apache2 on ubuntu, i was learning website development. Now the site runs fine on localhost. Whenever i access it through a remote location, the site opens, however the links do not work, they have been assigned with localhost,  eg. href="localhost/whatever.htm". What do i do?
2011-01-04T17:01:00.000Z	gosevan		I'm not sure what to search for on google as well. Pls help

2011-01-04T17:04:00.000Z	gosevan	sacarlson	hm. I'll check how that's done, any links on how-to?
