2012-10-03T06:37:00.000Z	edgy	muelli	L3top: I don't have a problem myself, but e.g I read on the link I pasted before that if you lost your password you can use this init=/bin/bash trick to get a shell to recover the password, I used to do this with passing single, so I wondered what's the difference?

2012-10-03T06:39:00.000Z	edgy	muelli	L3top; can you please hango on a bit so I reboot and try it?
