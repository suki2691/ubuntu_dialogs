2006-08-07T10:53:00.000Z	ubuntulover		I mean like root account
2006-08-07T10:54:00.000Z	ubuntulover		I know but is thier an option to make a root account so I could enable su...I think it is a little more secure.
2006-08-07T10:55:00.000Z	micahcowan	ubuntulover	no more secure. And sudo -sH would be the equiv to su (with "sudo -i" for su -).
