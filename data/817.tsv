2012-10-12T14:21:00.000Z	samuel_atwork	ActionParsnip	you gave me some fabulous advice regarding removing some stubborn networks from network manager, sadly they still refuse to budge i wonder if you could provide me with some more insight?
2012-10-12T14:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	samuel_atwork	you may be able to edit to connections manually
2012-10-12T14:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	samuel_atwork	look in  $HOME/.gconf/system/networking/connections/   maybe
2012-10-12T14:29:00.000Z	samuel_atwork	ActionParsnip	i have looked there but the networks that i wish to delete do not appear in that folder directory
