2009-05-24T18:16:00.000Z	finiteset		I upgraded my VLC and now the video output is separated from the controllers... before upgrading the interface was perfectly fine but now its weird... the same version on windows works correctly. Is there any way to sort this out?

2009-05-24T18:17:00.000Z	finiteset	Slart	what is the processes involved in compiling it myself?
2009-05-24T18:19:00.000Z	Slart	finiteset	go to the vlc main site, they have instructions there..
