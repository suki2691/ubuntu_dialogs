2008-02-08T02:14:00.000Z	cdm10	ufuntu	whereis program
2008-02-08T02:14:00.000Z	cdm10	ufuntu	which works too
2008-02-08T02:15:00.000Z	cdm10	ufuntu	the dpkg command works if you have a package name and want to know what files it's installed. whereis/which work if you have the name of a binary and want to find out where it is.
