2008-08-31T04:38:00.000Z	BigKahuna		can someone help with a basic ubuntu question?
2008-08-31T04:39:00.000Z	BigKahuna		thats..its my first time here so sorry if my etiquette isn't great :)  But I'm building a computer from ground up and I'd like to install Ubuntu on it...should I just download the installer file from the website then burn it to a CD?  Or is there a better and/or correct way?
2008-08-31T04:40:00.000Z	zcat[1]	BigKahuna	just one thing to be aware of, iso's get burned -to- the CD (it's a prebuilt CD filesystem) not -onto- a CD as a big file..
2008-08-31T04:42:00.000Z	zcat[1]	BigKahuna	there's a download link and also a guide to burning correctly on the ubuntu website I think.. should be fairly obvious...
