2008-07-22T12:21:00.000Z	iqson716	DJones	my nick is registered but don't hide my IP
2008-07-22T12:23:00.000Z	DJones	iqson716	In that case, have a chat in #freenode with the ops there, they'll be able to take you through the process of getting an unaffiliated cloak which will stop your ip address showing up
