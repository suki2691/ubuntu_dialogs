2011-03-04T11:09:00.000Z	visual1ce		im making a custom preseed file that loads ubuntu-standard instead of ubuntu-desktop... this seems to install no desktop environment. from here i want to install gnome but the meta-package contains apps that i wont use , like empathy, cheese, ekiga etc...
2011-03-04T11:09:00.000Z	visual1ce		is there a minimal gnome package?
2011-03-04T11:09:00.000Z	arrrghhh	visual1ce	gnome-core
