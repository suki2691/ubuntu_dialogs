2012-04-25T13:45:00.000Z	Gyro54		What can I use for remote desktop Ubuntu to Ubuntu with an easy setup and no port changes on the modem?
2012-04-25T13:47:00.000Z	Gyro54		I need to look at a machine in another state which has a problem and they cant access the modem to open port etc.
2012-04-25T13:48:00.000Z	Rienzilha	Gyro54	do they have access to that machine>?
