2005-02-19T11:47:00.000Z	redrum		how do I get those little graphs in the taskbar with cpu load, etc?
2005-02-19T11:47:00.000Z	regeya	redrum	are you asking because you're unable to play mp3s under rhythmbox, or because you don't like rhythmbox, or what :-)  because the answer to the first is in the ubuntu wiki...someone post a link...
