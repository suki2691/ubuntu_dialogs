2005-02-09T06:48:00.000Z	saif	tjs	well, none that i know of, but again i am totally new to this, I am here looking for somethn very close to what u need, there is a configuration file where u specify the sources for the packages, and then synaptec gets a shit load of packages for ubuntu, no1 is telling me where to get that file though! :(
