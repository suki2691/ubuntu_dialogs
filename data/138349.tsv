2008-12-27T05:39:00.000Z	Gehom		Could I get some advice? I just finished building my computer (Asus M3A78-EM m/b, AMD Athlon 64 x2 5000+ processor), it boots into BIOS just fine, and I configured the CD-ROM drive to be the primary boot device. There is no other OS on the computer. I put in my Ubuntu disc (which I had checked out and I know works), and...it doesnâ€™t boot into Ubuntu. How do I get it to boot?
2008-12-27T05:40:00.000Z	allquixotic	Gehom	Can you get that disc to boot in another computer?
