2006-07-11T12:03:00.000Z	Tomatix	t0dd	does iwlist scan give output?
2006-07-11T12:05:00.000Z	t0dd	Tomatix	when I type " iwlist scan " for that device, I am told it doesn't support scanning and that there is no such device
2006-07-11T12:06:00.000Z	Tomatix	t0dd	it might be another module like acx or something that is "blocking" ndiswrapper...
