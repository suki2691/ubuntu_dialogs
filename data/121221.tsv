2010-05-07T08:07:00.000Z	tamale1		I'm having a real problem with 10.04.. on my laptop, after several hours of normal behavior and performance, the machine becomes utterly unresponsive. The moue cursor still tracks, but I can't really click on anything or type anything, as it takes almost 30 seconds for my commands to have any effect.
2010-05-07T08:08:00.000Z	tamale1		I have to reboot
2010-05-07T08:08:00.000Z	roberto__	tamale1	what's "df -k" say ?
