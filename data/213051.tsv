2007-07-14T14:56:00.000Z	gnomefreak	towlieban	sudo apt-get install beryl=fullversion you want
2007-07-14T14:56:00.000Z	gnomefreak	towlieban	that is assuming its still in cache
2007-07-14T14:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	towlieban	if apt-cache show packagename shows the older version you want you can use the command i gave you. if not you cant
