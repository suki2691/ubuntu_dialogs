2006-09-10T11:57:00.000Z	jorgg		can i mount NFS drives when using the menu: Places-> Connect to server ?
2006-09-10T11:58:00.000Z	Jimmey	jorgg	naw, do it through the command line: mount ip:/Share/location /mount/point
2006-09-10T11:58:00.000Z	Jimmey	jorgg	I'd do "mount 192.168.0.2:/home/james /home/dave/sharedFiles/"
2006-09-10T12:00:00.000Z	jorgg	Jimmey	okay. Thats the way i mount now too.. Ill use that method then :)
