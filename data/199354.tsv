2006-02-19T08:45:00.000Z	BigDaddy		nevermind, sudo Nautilus does nothing
2006-02-19T08:45:00.000Z	Phelan	BigDaddy	Are you getting a poweruser error?
2006-02-19T08:49:00.000Z	Phelan	BigDaddy	I'm not very experienced with Linux, but I thought you were having a similar error I had, which I used a sudo command to gain root access. What it almost looks like to me though, is the file is corrupt or something. I say that, because it's outright failing, and not giving an access violation error or saying it isn't there...
