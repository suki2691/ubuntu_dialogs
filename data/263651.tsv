2005-07-12T12:01:00.000Z	supernix		could someone please explain why when I boot into the LiveCD that it messes my clock up ?
2005-07-12T10:06:00.000Z	supernix		that was what worried me about the liveCD
2005-07-12T10:06:00.000Z	supernix		I was worried that someone might hack it while it was connected and do some serious damage as I have a cable connection
2005-07-12T10:07:00.000Z	merriam	supernix	the live cd is reasonably secure by default.
