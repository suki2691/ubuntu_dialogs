2005-07-12T16:57:00.000Z	PDani		how can i resize a window, or put it to an other workspace from commandline?
2005-07-12T06:09:00.000Z	PDani		there's a commandline application (i don't remember its name), which can change the properties of an X11 window by its name, or title, etc... what's its name?
