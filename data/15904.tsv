2011-05-03T04:03:00.000Z	Blackcamaro8		Is there any way I can boot Ubuntu into a minimal-resources command-line mode? The computer it's on is amazing, but I need minimal resources to be used while I run a game server that's command-line operable. Any suggestions?

2011-05-03T04:05:00.000Z	Blackcamaro8	KNUBBIG	It's a Minecraft game server-- I want more resources to be dedicated to the server. I understand that I could install a server-edition, but I use the computer as a normal desktop when the server is unnecessary.
