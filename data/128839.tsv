2007-11-18T08:10:00.000Z	Lhademmor		I've got a problem with a file that ends in .avi that I can't get to play. Yes, I've installed w32codecs, gstreamer-plugins, the good the bad and the ugly, and even tried VLC, but still all I get is sound. No picture.
2007-11-18T08:10:00.000Z	Lhademmor		Can anyone help?
