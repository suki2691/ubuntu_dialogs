2012-05-01T14:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	Fleck	 you use the 'edit' feature of the grub menu and  append the item to the end of the  kernel= line, or i just use the 'nofb' option  but that may not be orrect any more

2012-05-01T14:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	Fleck	 of course not. if you want it perm. you edit the grub configs and refun update-grub
