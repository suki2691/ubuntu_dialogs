2006-06-13T10:44:00.000Z	FriendlySoviet		I'm unable to find the fstab command to mount an "ext3" partition at the beginning of boot, making it writable and readable users other than root. Can anyone help me out?

2006-06-13T10:48:00.000Z	FriendlySoviet	Dr_Willis	: Thank you very much. Works like a charm :)
