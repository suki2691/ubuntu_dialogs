2010-08-30T17:45:00.000Z	Adamus	Leman_Russ	well basically, EXT4 has the concept of ownership, right? So transferring a file to my girlfriends home folder means she cant open iit
2010-08-30T17:45:00.000Z	Adamus	Leman_Russ	if I drag files etc to an external hard disk, then format my machine, say doing an update or distro switch, will those files be locked because its not the same user?
2010-08-30T17:47:00.000Z	Adamus	Leman_Russ	ah right, I thought of just doing chmod a+rw on every file, but thats one hell of a step! lol
