2007-08-24T05:20:00.000Z	atarinox		can someone tell me where apps that i've downloaded are stored in the filesystem? I'm trying to open a file w/ a certain app, and i'm browsing endlessly looking for hte app's executable
2007-08-24T05:21:00.000Z	dho_ragus	atarinox	open a shell and do `which appname`
2007-08-24T05:21:00.000Z	dho_ragus	atarinox	eg:  `which vim`
