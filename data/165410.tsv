2006-10-08T11:11:00.000Z	eracc	ciphernemo	there is also ##kernel.
2006-10-08T11:11:00.000Z	ciphernemo	eracc	thank you eracc, becuase there's pretty much no one at #kernelnewbies
2006-10-08T11:12:00.000Z	eracc	ciphernemo	there is also #linux-kernel (9 people in there when I did a channel list here).
