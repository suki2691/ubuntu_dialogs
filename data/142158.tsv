2007-04-22T16:55:00.000Z	yigal	PurpZeY	read to do what? like lsusb?
2007-04-22T16:55:00.000Z	PurpZeY	yigal	Well I did lsusb and my device is listed (a quickcam) but I am wondering how I can control it now
2007-04-22T16:58:00.000Z	PurpZeY	yigal	lsusb is recognizing my USB device, but I have no way of controlling it...It's a webcam, I am looking to see if I can't use it for AIMing....
