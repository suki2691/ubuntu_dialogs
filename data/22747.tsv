2010-11-14T00:28:00.000Z	bilge_km	jfv34	i have installed compiz-settings-manager. i know that for open-close windows naimations we must use "animations" tab from effects groups. but i can see just these effects there : http://wiki.compiz.org/Plugins/Animation . but i want a smooth closing and opening on every window :( how to add that ?
