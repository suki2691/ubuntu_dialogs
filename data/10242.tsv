2011-08-21T14:08:00.000Z	Greyshadow1		Hi, I would like to know how can I install Windows 7, Windows XP and a Linux distro in the same computer.
2011-08-21T14:08:00.000Z	Greyshadow1		I would like something like a grub that could direct to each one.
2011-08-21T14:08:00.000Z	Greyshadow1		I can't do that, I tried.
