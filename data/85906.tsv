2011-02-24T19:46:00.000Z	rmd_		How do I tell the system to stop automounting crap so that I can format this USB stick?
2011-02-24T19:46:00.000Z	DeadPanda	rmd_	use Disk Utility to unmount the volume (not the drive)
2011-02-24T19:46:00.000Z	DeadPanda	rmd_	it's the button beneath the the volume selector
