2011-01-06T15:06:00.000Z	will___		does ubuntu by default create a seperate /home partition in the installer?
2011-01-06T15:07:00.000Z	duron23	will___	no
2011-01-06T15:07:00.000Z	will___	duron23	thanks for clarifying. it's surprising, as a seperate /home partition has saved my bacon (and made my life easier) more than a few times
2011-01-06T15:08:00.000Z	duron23	will___	but you can specify one, if you want, but its not default
