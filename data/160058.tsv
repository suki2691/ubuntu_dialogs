2006-11-15T13:49:00.000Z	netnull		hello guys. is my impression or Edgy is less stabile and fast then dapper??
2006-11-15T13:50:00.000Z	mooey	netnull	correct :)
2006-11-15T13:50:00.000Z	mooey	netnull	edgy is pretty damn stable, but dapper is the distro for you if reliablity is key
2006-11-15T13:50:00.000Z	netnull	mooey	that's bad :-) so maybe its better to come back to dapper...
