2007-02-11T11:11:00.000Z	gortba_		Hi. I have two hard drives with two different ubuntu operating systems installed. I want to remove one of the ubuntu's and install fedora. I can handle the install, but does anyone know how to look at my hard drives and then format the hard drive that has the ubuntu that I don't want?
