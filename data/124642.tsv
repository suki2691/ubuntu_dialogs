2009-02-19T22:06:00.000Z	kitche	Krooks	go find it and compile it or try another site to get the package but I rather compile a program if I need it and it's not stock
2009-02-19T22:09:00.000Z	Krooks	kitche	yeah, actually that what I want to know. if something is not stock, is there a site with experimental or customised debs that I can use ? Or my only choice is to install it from source. Also, if I were to install it from source, do I have to do make install or can I built a deb first after make so that its easy to unisntall later on.
