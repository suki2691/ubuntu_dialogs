2009-12-18T03:03:00.000Z	mike_______		anyone got a solution for very slow usb write speed after some time? like, it's fast until 25% and then it starts getting horribly slow. mount -o async,remount doesn't work for that device. -o flush didn't help

2009-12-18T03:04:00.000Z	Slart	mike_______	I used to try moving say.. a 600 MB iso file and after 300MB or so it just kind of stalled and never finished
