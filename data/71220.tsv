2008-12-17T01:59:00.000Z	gvachon		Hi all, I have a ubuntu server 8.10 as a mail server. I am receiving some spam with my domain as the FROM. is there a way to block that ?! i know i will still receive spam but at least i dont want to receive spam that has mydomain... like admin@mydomain.com

2008-12-17T02:00:00.000Z	phantomcircuit		it has nothing to do with ubuntu
