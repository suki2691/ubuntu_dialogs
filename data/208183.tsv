2006-07-08T07:08:00.000Z	Kalm_		Can anyone point me to a web site that could possibly help me to tweak my ubuntu system as its running pretty slow...
2006-07-08T07:09:00.000Z	frogzoo	Kalm_	what's top say? what's the cpu % ?
2006-07-08T07:09:00.000Z	frogzoo	Kalm_	that's not what I asked
2006-07-08T07:10:00.000Z	frogzoo	Kalm_	that's a pretty low spec - did ubuntu ever run quicker?
