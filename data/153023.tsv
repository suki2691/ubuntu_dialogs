2007-04-23T08:03:00.000Z	AnythingJ		My clock is going 1.5x too fast...anyone have any ideas why it would do that? I'm on a 32-bit system (I've heard of this problem for 64-bit users)

2007-04-23T08:04:00.000Z	sid	AnythingJ	right click on the clock on the top right, and adjust date/time, and under configuration go to manual.
