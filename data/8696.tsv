2012-10-24T12:49:00.000Z	sorseg	MestreLion	I tried to reboot, do you know a way to rebuild nvidia drivers without completely reinstalling them?
2012-10-24T12:50:00.000Z	MestreLion	sorseg	i'm not familiar with nvidia drivers, sorry. in amd/ti, it automatically rebuilds itself when I upgrade kernel, but now sure if a reinstall would be required after an apt-get distupgrade
2012-10-24T12:51:00.000Z	sorseg	MestreLion	ok, I didn't use distupgrade, I just installed package updates. It did update some glpackages though, so I will go and try to reinstall drivers, thanks =)
