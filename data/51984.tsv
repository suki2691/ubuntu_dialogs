2009-07-24T17:41:00.000Z	Guest76609		I've booted into liveCD and I want to use grsync.  But the package manager can't see it, despite the fact that I've selected multiverse.  What am I missing?
2009-07-24T17:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest76609	try running: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install grsync
2009-07-24T17:43:00.000Z	Guest76609	ActionParsnip	Can I install it while I'm booted from a LiveCD?
2009-07-24T17:44:00.000Z	Guest76609	ActionParsnip	okay, I'll give it another go.
