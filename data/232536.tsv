2009-10-20T18:45:00.000Z	Prune		Going to Applications...Accessories...Terminal, I typed "nano" and immediately a little GNU nano 2.0.9 started.  It offered some command briefs at the bottom.   I typed a little text and tried to save it, no File...Save or ...Save As commands available.  Can it start in a different interface?
