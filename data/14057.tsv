2011-06-29T04:54:00.000Z	ubuntu12321		... my issue is: can't i install libmad, in a way that programs would be able to play mp3 without fluendo? libmad has no patent issue in my country
2011-06-29T04:55:00.000Z	ubuntu12321		or some programs would play mp3 only with fluendo? (why can't ubuntu offer libmad, especially since it offered it in past?)
2011-06-29T04:56:00.000Z	sudokill	ubuntu12321	i think the medibuntu ppa sorts all that out i maybe completely wrong
2011-06-29T05:03:00.000Z	sudokill	ubuntu12321	i dont think there is..
