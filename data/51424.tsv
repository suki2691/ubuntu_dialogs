2010-04-24T19:42:00.000Z	rocket16		Hello friends. Notification area failed to start once, and I accidentally deleted it, :( What is the way to get it back? I tried Adding it again to Panel, but nothing happens.

2010-04-24T19:44:00.000Z	rocket16	airtonix	Thanks friend. I meant my problem wrongly, :( I just meant the Indicator applet. I added it successfully, and used the "pkill gnome-panel" command. Still, thanks, :)
2010-04-24T19:45:00.000Z	airtonix	rocket16	its ok, gnome-panel sometimes bugs out and wont correctly show new panel-applets.. so killing it first before adding a panel-applet is something i do as a habit
