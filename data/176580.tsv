2007-10-14T16:09:00.000Z	bluekb_		I am having trouble getting the nvidia binary (proprietary) drivers working for an 8600GS card.
2007-10-14T16:10:00.000Z	bluekb_		I have tried installing the nvidia-glx package and running nvidia-xconfig, but it results in an error upon starting gdm/kdm
2007-10-14T16:11:00.000Z	bluekb_		Also, I have tried using the nvidia.com proprietary drivers, and get an error  "failed to load the NVIDIA kernel module"
