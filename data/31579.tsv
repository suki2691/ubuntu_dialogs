2010-09-07T05:38:00.000Z	pgib		hello. I've used Linux for years, but I am installing Ubuntu on a friend's laptop (first time I've tried Lucid).  I place the CD in the drive, the screen goes through a few phases. Then, it is at what seems to be a GDM login prompt :-/
2010-09-07T05:38:00.000Z	pgib		the area that would show the users is empty, and it doesn't seem to accept any username/password combos I can think of.
2010-09-07T05:39:00.000Z	pgib		this is odd, since I never configured anything, and ubuntu isn't actually instlled on the disk. It seems like the LiveCD itself needs me to login to it :-/
