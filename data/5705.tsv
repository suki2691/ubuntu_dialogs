2012-06-19T22:33:00.000Z	javierf_		Hi! I have problem with my internet connection, that sometimes go very slow in Ubuntu 12.04. I can solve it parcially with the command "sudo iwconfig wlan0 power off". I would like to which off wlan power permanently, so I don't have to introduce that order so often... someone can asses me how to do that? Thanks!
