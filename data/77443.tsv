2008-10-20T18:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LjjjL	i wish they'd remove alien so very much
2008-10-20T19:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	LjjjL	how do you mean "no connections for a while"
2008-10-20T19:03:00.000Z	LjjjL	ActionParsnip	well, nothing showing up in netstat, i guess. no tcp connections. (i guess udp might be a problem)
