2010-01-12T11:50:00.000Z	maco	Awesome3000	if you know that some hardware you need is supported in it but not in whatever kernel you're currently using, yes
2010-01-12T11:51:00.000Z	Awesome3000	maco	 actually the latest kernal is causing a driver error
2010-01-12T11:51:00.000Z	maco	Awesome3000	ooh fun. file bug?
