2009-11-02T19:56:00.000Z	roygbiv		is the upgrade from 9.04 to 9.10 solid? i'd like to upgrade a mission critical system of mine and i want to make sure i'm not putting the noose around my own neck by doing so
2009-11-02T19:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	roygbiv	if it is mission critical it should be running a LTS in the first place :)
2009-11-02T19:57:00.000Z	roygbiv	erUSUL	i don't know what LTS is heh, but it's recoverable to a known state if i need to. i only want to understand how solid the upgrade is from jaunty to karmic
2009-11-02T19:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	roygbiv	i would wait a few weeks to do the upgrade (i allways do and my machine is desktop)
