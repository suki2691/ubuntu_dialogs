2012-04-25T17:01:00.000Z	fidel_	kaiowas	why are you buying a pc with windows preinstalled then in the first place? in some countries refunding was done already - but it might be a big hustle

2012-04-25T17:05:00.000Z	fidel_	kaiowas	do youz calculate your time as well regarding the refund? ;) might eat the money-win
