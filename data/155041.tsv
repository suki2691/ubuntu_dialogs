2007-12-29T07:13:00.000Z	kriel	cvd	yup. Just go through the options... if i remember correctly, it's enabled by default, and asks you every time if you want to save a password.
2007-12-29T07:14:00.000Z	kriel	cvd	mmm... maybe. don't quote me on this, but i think it remembers past things that have been typed in fields...
2007-12-29T07:14:00.000Z	kriel	cvd	try asking in #firefox
