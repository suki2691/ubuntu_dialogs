2005-03-27T15:58:00.000Z	Bwl	kotatsu	probably since 2.6.10-5 is considered more stable
2005-03-27T16:03:00.000Z	kotatsu	Bwl	yeah, I always had to find time to get around to compiling a new kernel, then recompiling when I found I was missing a feature =P I've compiled enough that it's no longer interesting, it's just a chore
2005-03-27T16:05:00.000Z	Bwl	kotatsu	I agree. Ubuntu actually makes one productive. :)
