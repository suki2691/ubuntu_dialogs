2012-06-30T11:51:00.000Z	Varikonniemi		is there something that could stop the installation of 12.04 on a pentium3 with 4g ram? As i run the setup it stops in an error about midway through
2012-06-30T11:52:00.000Z	Varikonniemi		afaik the normal kernel shoul run on pentium1 if there is enough ram
2012-06-30T11:53:00.000Z	Varikonniemi		i was just thinking is it worth to waste another CD and burn 12.10 alpha2 and try with that, or is it something fundamental about ubuntu that requires more than a pentium3?
