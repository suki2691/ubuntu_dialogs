2008-09-15T18:53:00.000Z	Kelderkeuken	artpoetryfiction	that is a script file, go to the directory it is in and do ./name.sh   if it comes with instructions read them
2008-09-15T18:56:00.000Z	artpoetryfiction	Kelderkeuken	no instructions, did the ./filename.sh and it said: Permission denied
2008-09-15T18:57:00.000Z	Kelderkeuken	artpoetryfiction	what xnv said, try to give it permission first with   chmod +x filename.sh
