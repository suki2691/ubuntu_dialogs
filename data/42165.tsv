2012-05-03T16:49:00.000Z	faraway		hi. i have a question to upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 form cd. first of all, i have made backups of all data. then i started form cd to do an installation and did "upgrade form 11.10 to 12.04"
2012-05-03T16:49:00.000Z	faraway		 then i was asked "how you are?" and i thought ok, i don't wan to create a new user so i stopped the upgrade process which was a bad idea :D is the only way now to do a complete reinstallation. or can i get back to 11.10 ? i only went to the step "How you are?"
