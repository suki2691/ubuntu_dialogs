2010-02-07T13:29:00.000Z	z3r0	Slart	could you give me a link or anything?
2010-02-07T13:30:00.000Z	Slart	z3r0	don't know of a good link for that.. perhaps googling for "linux network routing failover" might get you some hits
2010-02-07T13:31:00.000Z	z3r0	Slart	would that also help if i wanted to switch between connections manually on purpose?
2010-02-07T13:31:00.000Z	Slart	z3r0	I'm not sure if vpn makes it more complicated.. I've never messed with that myself
