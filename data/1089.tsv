2012-09-20T16:48:00.000Z	foo357	twitchie	how do I add an PP to sources.list?
2012-09-20T16:51:00.000Z	foo357	twitchie	could a online computer download the packages I need from the PPA, not necessarily the identical OS as my offline computer?
2012-09-20T16:54:00.000Z	twitchie	foo357	yes you cna download the individual .deb files and dependencies if required and transfer them but that is not suggested as the system cannot upgrade to new packages as required.
