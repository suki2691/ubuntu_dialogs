2011-04-17T14:32:00.000Z	merlo		hello... I broke my HD. I was moving my laptop and it felt down. Ubuntu won't run anymore so i tried reinstalling it. At first the system could run again but then I installed a bunch of updates and things screwup again. So i assume there is a part of my disk that cannot be read anymore. So my question: is it possibile to format my disk in order to avoid the use of its broken part? THX

2011-04-17T14:36:00.000Z	merlo	buff27	i did, it can be accessed. only some parts of the disk are broken in fact when i try to read files located on those parts i get a I/O error. Ubuntu cannot start because some of the files it loads at start up are located on the unaccesbile part. I was wondering if there is a way to tell the system not to write on broken sectors
