2006-01-11T08:55:00.000Z	heatxsink		where would I go to find possible kernel parameters to pass to the kernel via grub?
2006-01-11T08:56:00.000Z	mwe	heatxsink	google, forums. what do you need?
2006-01-11T09:02:00.000Z	heatxsink	mwe	 so basically I have this tvcard that wants IRQ 19
2006-01-11T09:05:00.000Z	mwe	heatxsink	I would google solving irq conflicts in linux. you can pass some parameters at boot bot I don't remember them right now. I haven't had the need in 5 years or so
