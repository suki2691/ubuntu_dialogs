2007-05-20T14:01:00.000Z	nesteaplunge		Question: Any suggestions as to why my ubuntu disc is not installing? I'm trying to switch from windows, I've gotten all my questions answered, checked the checksum, the disc is ok, optical drive boots first, but now when I try to install, I just get this long cmd prompt looking thing. Any help???
