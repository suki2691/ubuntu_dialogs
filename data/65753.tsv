2009-02-21T12:29:00.000Z	hmw		is my client filtering stuff, or did this channel just go silent?
2009-02-21T12:30:00.000Z	hmw		thanks... i dont know my epic too well and put in some /ingore command to filter out the login/logout messages, so i wondered.
2009-02-21T12:30:00.000Z	hmw		never saw this channel so silent
