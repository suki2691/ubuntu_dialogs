2011-07-07T05:50:00.000Z	soultekkie	robin0800_	I prefer Gnome, as do many other users... all I am "asking for" is for a setup choice between Unity and Gnome(hopefully 3)
2011-07-07T05:51:00.000Z	soultekkie	robin0800_	i know there are ways to put gnome back as default... but if you could choose what to use would be the cherry on top of the cake
2011-07-07T05:53:00.000Z	robin0800_	soultekkie	what I am saying is there will be no classic in 11.10 so no choice
