2007-09-01T15:53:00.000Z	bruenig	foxray	xfce doesn't need any gnome libs by default
2007-09-01T15:53:00.000Z	bruenig	foxray	gtk is not a gnome lib
2007-09-01T15:54:00.000Z	bruenig	foxray	xubuntu probably does because of all the apps it bundles and because a lot of apps depend for some ridiculous reason on the abomination that is gnome's attempt at windows registry
