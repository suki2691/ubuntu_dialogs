2009-02-16T00:06:00.000Z	blastron		Hello, I have an unusable system that I would like to get a large amount of data off of. I can use a install CD to boot into rescue mode, is it possible to mount a network drive or at the very least use SSH/SCP to transfer data?

2009-02-16T00:09:00.000Z	blastron	pop79	i think that might be the best option, thanks, I'll see if I can dig one out
