2006-01-04T12:14:00.000Z	yanis_		do you have any idea how I can do a "clean install" of ubuntu without formatting my hard disc
2006-01-04T12:15:00.000Z	sethk	yanis_	just rename all your existing directories.  I do mkdir /prev, then I move everything under /prev
2006-01-04T12:15:00.000Z	sethk	yanis_	no need to format anything, not even a partition
