2007-04-02T11:23:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	shmeelAway	if not, i would strongly suggest searching ubuntuforums.org   Because it's a hardware specific issue, it's nothing that anyone w/o that laptop could probably help with  : (
2007-04-02T11:25:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	shmeelAway	it's very possible.  Also, if other people with your model of laptop are having this issue there is a good chance someone has created a simple program or script to fix it.  best way to fin dout is to search via google or on ubuntuforums.org for you laptop model number and a few keywords related to the issue
2007-04-02T11:26:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	shmeelAway	then at the least you should report it as a bug on launchpad.net and then the developers will fix the issue (hopefully in time for feisty's release)
