2007-06-08T10:57:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom		I am having a problem, some programs (firefox and enigma) are spontaneously closing, saying that their server connection is closed. As well scrolling stops working, and when enigma closes, the pointer freezes and I have to close X to reclaim it. Ubuntu 7.04 on a laptop. I might have just installed kubuntu-desktop when it started (but I'm still primarily using GNOME)

2007-06-08T10:58:00.000Z	kitsuneofdoom	Nutubuntu	it's a game. It just happens to crash as well
