2008-07-15T22:37:00.000Z	rj_		to recover your var directory you could look for an undelete program.  main thing is to not touch that disk until running undelete.  I have seen them around but don't know offhand where to get it, try google undelete linux ext3

2008-07-15T22:38:00.000Z	Slart	rj_	nevermind.. I'm confused.. there seems to be several undelete tools for ext3..
