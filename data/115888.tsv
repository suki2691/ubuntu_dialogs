2010-09-19T22:55:00.000Z	bobstro	melkor	 yes, but i've forgotten where exactly. the option does exist.
2010-09-19T22:55:00.000Z	melkor	bobstro	I've disabled the screen saver that might have been it.
2010-09-19T22:55:00.000Z	bobstro	melkor	 maybe under power options too. i have seen option to set fade-in and out times. are you using compiz?
