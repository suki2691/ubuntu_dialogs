2010-06-08T03:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ToeKutter	The default setting is to use the first menu entry in /boot/grub/grub.cfg . If you want to change that, change GRUB_DEFAULT in /etc/default/grub and re-run update-grub
2010-06-08T03:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ToeKutter	What is your end goal? (If you want to change things via a script then you should look at GRUB_DEFAULT=saved and the utility grub-set-default)
