2006-05-01T15:30:00.000Z	Elazar		Using Synaptic to do a complete removal of gPHPEdit doesn't seem to have gotten rid of the option I get to open it in the menu that appears when I right-click on a file. Any ideas on how I can do that? I tried reinstalling it and doing a complete removal again to make sure that something odd didn't happen when I originally completely removed it, but the menu option is still there.

2006-05-01T15:33:00.000Z	Elazar	NickGarvey	I have rebooted since I did the removal of gPHPEdit, though, and that hadn't had any effect.
