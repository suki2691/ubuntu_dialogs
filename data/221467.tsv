2005-09-20T15:56:00.000Z	Quinthius	mkyb14	i dont know what geek-tool is, but it sounds like you want to watch a logfile in realtime on the desktop?
2005-09-20T15:57:00.000Z	Quinthius	mkyb14	check out root-tail
2005-09-20T15:57:00.000Z	Quinthius	mkyb14	i'm not sure if it will display properly with nautilus handling the desktop... but worth a try
