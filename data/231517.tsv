2008-11-19T05:12:00.000Z	Krzysztof		Anyone: I installed Ubuntu 8.10. And I have the nVidia video card for my laptop. But not the latest drivers. 2 questions - Where can I get the latest drivers and will that change the appearance of Ubuntu. Because right now it looks like Knoppix. =/

2008-11-19T05:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Krzysztof	 last i looked it was its own disrto and you could download the iso/isntall it.. Or you could enable the repos and install it on a ubuntu box.
2008-11-19T05:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Krzysztof	 of course thelast i tried it.. it wasent really worth trying.. :) I would suggest using Ubuntu, and try gos inside virtualbox
