2006-06-23T11:49:00.000Z	Flannel	_fluffee	you can do that, just download the debs, then burn/sneakernet them, and you can install them later.   The only problem is knowing which packages to download.
2006-06-23T11:50:00.000Z	_fluffee	Flannel	I can copy/paste names from the "Updates available" (or whatever) screen, but from where do I dl them?
2006-06-23T11:51:00.000Z	Flannel	_fluffee	oh, right.  You have internet, just not bandwidth.  Just put the repository URLs into a web browser, and navigate from there
