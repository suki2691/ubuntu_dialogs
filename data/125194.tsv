2007-09-29T09:17:00.000Z	Cryoniq		Ah now I see what I did wrong.. I used /dev/hdd1 and /dev/hdc1 instead of /dev/sdc1 and /dev/sdb1  , wonder what the difference is.. hmm..

2007-09-29T09:18:00.000Z	Cryoniq	scguy318	ah.. that makes sense.. the 2 disks are actually ATA disks, but I seen in several places and docs referers to sata etc around the topic.. confusing..
