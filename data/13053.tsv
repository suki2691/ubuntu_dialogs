2011-06-20T22:45:00.000Z	classico	sarkis	have you installed ubuntu-tweak?
2011-06-20T22:46:00.000Z	sarkis	classico	i have to install that to tweak it??? theres no default solution to modifying workspaces??
2011-06-20T22:47:00.000Z	classico	sarkis	that's a major issue with unity, not easy to tweak, that's why ubuntu-tweak (or tweak ubuntu, i'm not sure) was designed
