2005-11-08T07:25:00.000Z	Fletch		I installed the normal/full installation of ubuntu and it runs too slow on my old 400mhz 64mb ram computer and I was wondering if its possible to remove gnome and just have a window manager, or whatever will make it faster
2005-11-08T07:26:00.000Z	dducko	Fletch	do a server install
2005-11-08T07:26:00.000Z	dducko	Fletch	then get a window manger like Ice
2005-11-08T07:26:00.000Z	Fletch	dducko	tried that, but I had too much trouble with installing things because it doesn't have the internet
