2005-11-06T09:06:00.000Z	iiiears	Laz0r	- the live CD 99.44/100% the same as the install.
2005-11-06T09:07:00.000Z	Laz0r	iiiears	how much space do you have to install things and such using the live cd
2005-11-06T09:08:00.000Z	iiiears	Laz0r	- the limit of RAM?? - about five gigs for the HD install is cozy
