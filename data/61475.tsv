2012-10-04T16:00:00.000Z	JSX		hello everyone!
2012-10-04T16:00:00.000Z	JSX		I've got a question about preeseed
2012-10-04T16:01:00.000Z	JSX		is it   "d-i  mirror/country   string  enter information manually"  OR   "d-i  mirror/country   string manual"  to use your own defined mirror, and is that different per major version?
