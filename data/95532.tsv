2012-07-16T17:29:00.000Z	DJones	Taev	Transmission
2012-07-16T17:32:00.000Z	DJones	Taev	I tried it with chrome & transmission, I didn't have any problems with it, I'm not on that machine at the minute though so I can't check anything with it
2012-07-16T17:34:00.000Z	DJones	Taev	8.04 is no longer supported, I suspect that more recent versions will have an upgraded version of transmission which is able to handle the magnet links
