2011-10-14T22:35:00.000Z	choronzon		hello. I just updated to 11.10 from 11.04 and now flash is broken. I'm using 64 bits version. flash works for the most part, but on a few websites where I have to give it permision to use webcam and/or mic, I can't click the buttons. any ideas?
2011-10-14T22:37:00.000Z	choronzon		another issue after uprading, my webcam image looks black and white. with some shades of color here and there. and its mic doesn't work. logitech e2500. it worked perfectly up until last night when I made the mistake of upgrading :(
2011-10-14T22:39:00.000Z	choronzon		the whole release looks pretty screwed to me
2011-10-14T22:40:00.000Z	Tixos	choronzon	i agree, what the hell is going on
