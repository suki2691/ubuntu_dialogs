2008-10-18T00:15:00.000Z	AlexC		Why wont anyone respond to my question about 1680x1050?
2008-10-18T00:15:00.000Z	AlexC		I am having no luck getting my Dell PowerEdge server with integrated ATI video and Dell 20" widescreen monitor to display 1680x1050. I have done the steps shown in the FixVideoResolutionHowto document but I am not having any luck.
