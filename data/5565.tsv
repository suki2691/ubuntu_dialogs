2012-05-23T13:56:00.000Z	MacroMan		I'm having problems with ssh connection to a remote server.
2012-05-23T13:57:00.000Z	MacroMan		Everything works fine and I can connect. After about 20-30 connects and disconnects, I get a timeout when I try to connect. It's not the server as other people can connect fine. After I restart my local machine, I can connect again fine. What could be causing this?

2012-05-23T13:58:00.000Z	MacroMan	MonkeyDust	No, local network over ethernet.
