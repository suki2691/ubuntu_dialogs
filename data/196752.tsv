2006-03-05T06:34:00.000Z	navarone	rupan3	yeah I find xfce pretty fast too...and I'm on a Athlon 1.2ghz w/512 ram...and it's not that hard to make it seem pretty much like gnome anyway <s>
2006-03-05T06:35:00.000Z	rupan3	navarone	with all the themes and stuff, my xfce looks way sicker than i could have made gnome look
2006-03-05T06:35:00.000Z	rupan3	navarone	i've got it tricked out like a mexican lowrider
2006-03-05T06:37:00.000Z	rupan3	navarone	it will once i can figure out how to stick luminocity on here and stay with my gtk/xfwm themes
