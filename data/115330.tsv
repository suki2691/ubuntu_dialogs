2007-11-02T07:56:00.000Z	DisabledDuck		i'm running Ubuntu 64-bit and for some reason i can't get my java apps to work anymore
2007-11-02T07:58:00.000Z	DisabledDuck		for some reason everytime i open Azureus it closes about 2 seconds later, does anybody know how to fix this?

2007-11-02T07:59:00.000Z	DisabledDuck	Ebiggs	well, it opens... which makes me think that it might not be java, so i decided to be more specific, if the answer i gets works, then it's not my java
