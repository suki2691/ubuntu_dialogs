2005-06-30T14:33:00.000Z	delire	morchuboo	you need to give priority in a file called ~/.asoundrc, if you are using ALSA that is
2005-06-30T14:35:00.000Z	morchuboo	delire	 - I have done that - and ALSA has changed fine, but selecting ALSA as the default sound sink didnt change what was used for system sounds
