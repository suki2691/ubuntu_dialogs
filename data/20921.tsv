2011-10-14T19:10:00.000Z	kenanb		any ubuntu 11.10 users around that somehow achieved to reassign movement key?
2011-10-14T19:11:00.000Z	kenanb		it conflicts with some other software, but this time there is no easy place to reassign alt to super as movement key for windows
2011-10-14T19:11:00.000Z	reisio	kenanb	do what?
2011-10-14T19:12:00.000Z	kenanb	reisio	there was movement keys option under preferences>windows tab in system settings that has the option to assign movement key to super, now there isn't
