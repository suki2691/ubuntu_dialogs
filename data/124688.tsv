2008-01-30T16:03:00.000Z	yeniklasorr		When I open 10-15 tabs on firefox, it is beginning to be unstable and not responding. How can I fix this?
2008-01-30T16:05:00.000Z	savvas	yeniklasorr	if you have a lot of extensions / add-ons, they might be slowing down firefox
2008-01-30T16:09:00.000Z	savvas	yeniklasorr	if you are using i386 ubuntu and more than 2gb of memory, then yeah, that's a problem :P amd64 ubuntu version supports more than 2gb i think
