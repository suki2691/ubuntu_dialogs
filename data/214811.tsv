2005-10-07T14:36:00.000Z	mister_roboto	esac	you don't need to install linux just to get bash. cygwin runs great on windows :)
2005-10-07T14:37:00.000Z	esac	mister_roboto	yes, but its not installed by default, when writing a batch script for systems that are newly setup, its imperative to use what comes with the system as much as possible
2005-10-07T14:37:00.000Z	mister_roboto	esac	yeah, i know what you mean. that's why i'm a vi user rather than emacs ;)
