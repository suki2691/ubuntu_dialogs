2006-10-13T16:54:00.000Z	thomasmckay	david_	i highly doubt suspend/resume works.

2006-10-13T16:56:00.000Z	david_	thomasmckay	I read on the beryl forms that the AIGLX/x.org patches exist, but my laptop still hates suspend/resume.  Do you know if these patches really do exist; if so, could you point me in the direction to compile X with them added?
