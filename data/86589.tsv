2008-07-01T20:30:00.000Z	Slart	BlackCow_	gnome is a part of the core ubuntu install.. so no.. but you can install xfce and then uninstall gnome if you want.. you'll still be able to use your computer
2008-07-01T20:30:00.000Z	BlackCow_	Slart	but will it remove all my program configurations and such?
2008-07-01T20:32:00.000Z	Slart	BlackCow_	nope.. just uninstalling wont remove configurations.. unless you use the --purge option (or the "completely remove" thingy in synaptic)
