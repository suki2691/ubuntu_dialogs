2007-03-14T13:09:00.000Z	___drunken		hi everyone. I have a little problem with feisty. Usplash doesn't show up most of the time. The text-boot messages stop with a message like "pci quirk....". then nothing happens and after some time, the gdm greeter appers. anyone who can help me to track down this problem?"

2007-03-14T13:11:00.000Z	PirateHead	___drunken	no problem.
