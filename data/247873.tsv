2005-09-20T12:35:00.000Z	ompaul	ippiraman	if you are willing to have a couple of hundred megs a day upgrades it seems good enough
2005-09-20T12:38:00.000Z	ompaul	ippiraman	in fact that was unfair - there was 334 packages since colony four ~ 255 megs ... and there are 105 megs since about 12 hours ago -
2005-09-20T12:38:00.000Z	ompaul	ippiraman	 that 255 was up to 7 hours ago - different box
