2010-03-04T01:15:00.000Z	Ganang		can anyone help we me with a simple question. Is metacity just a decorator for windows? And Gtk 2.x? which parts it actually modifies?
2010-03-04T01:17:00.000Z	Ganang		petskull: what is metacity? can you explain me better? the problem is that sometimes i download a theme with just GTK 2.X and just modifies my start menu (panel). I just wanted to know who plays each role in the theme (i know about emerald and compiz, but i am not using them)
2010-03-04T01:19:00.000Z	Ganang		pici: do i need the gtk theme changer installed to automatically change it? why sometime, even putting the themes inside the right folder, i cant have the  "Appearence" of ubuntu recognizing it?
2010-03-04T01:19:00.000Z	Petskull	Ganang	what OS are you running?
