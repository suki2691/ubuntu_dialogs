2007-01-07T10:56:00.000Z	pulaski		Hello, I've been running ubuntu 6.06LTS with kernel 2.6.15-27-386 on the kde-desktop for only a little while.  I'm trying to install a package that will add a kernel module.  It's a package that will let me connect to my TI-84+ SE calculator.  The README.Debian tells me I need to know where the kernel sources are located.   The README suggests /usr/src/linux but that doesn't exist on my box.
