2010-06-10T21:54:00.000Z	coventry		I have /home on a separate partition.  I need to reinstall ubuntu.  Are there explicit instructions on how to do this without touching /home?  If I choose "Specify partitions manually", set the /home partition's mountpoint to /home, and specify that it should not be formatted, will that suffice?
