(my worry is about the streaming / recording part... as i don't know if there are good tools for that....... ideally will be done screencasts too, and i'm worrie

2010-07-24T00:08:00.000Z	adam___	ascheel	what do you suggest for video recording, post production, streaming and screencasts? (something visual which could be used by normal people.. :) )
2010-07-24T00:09:00.000Z	ascheel	adam___	for recording, something as simple as VLC will work.  For post production, perhaps OpenShot.  Streaming and screencasts?  You got me.
