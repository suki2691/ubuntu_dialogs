2006-10-17T11:04:00.000Z	colder4545	puff	i think that that lists all packages, unless he can narrow by name
2006-10-17T11:08:00.000Z	puff	colder4545	Idaknow the context, but "dpkg -l" will list all of the packages, "dpkg -l | fgrep -i somestring" will filter for a given string, "dpkg -L packagename" will list all files.
