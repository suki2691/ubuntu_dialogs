2009-10-30T11:05:00.000Z	The_Doctor	reya276	go to themes and icons and then choose human
2009-10-30T11:05:00.000Z	reya276	The_Doctor	I did that, but it seems that no icons are showing for Preferences, Administration and some others
2009-10-30T11:06:00.000Z	reya276	The_Doctor	like if the Icon theme is broken somehow
