If those words were censored i would find it impossible to talk about how to avoid ********* products, or to discuss X-*******, for example. It would not be possible to talk about ordinary household glass ******, either! Or to discuss how ********* can be defeated in the marketplace. On the whole, censorship, even of ********* or *******, is probably a bad idea.
