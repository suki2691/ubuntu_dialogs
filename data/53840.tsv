2010-05-05T06:26:00.000Z	fausto	iflema	I don't think so, when I tried enabeling on the "hardware drivres" gui it tried to download something and failed
2010-05-05T06:27:00.000Z	iflema	fausto	you need to add the install media as a package source first
2010-05-05T06:27:00.000Z	fausto	iflema	I'll try that, thanks
