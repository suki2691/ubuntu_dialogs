2011-05-27T21:48:00.000Z	philip_		I messed up my upgrade it seems. Now I want to install "update-manager-core" but am getting dependency errors. How to debug/fix? Example:
2011-05-27T21:48:00.000Z	philip_		python: Depends: python-minimal (= 2.6.6-2ubuntu2) but 2.7.1-0ubuntu5 is installed.
2011-05-27T21:49:00.000Z	philip_		tried upgrading lucid to natty, fail/mistake. am now trying lucid to maverick.
2011-05-27T21:50:00.000Z	rww	philip_	how are you doing the upgrade? do-release-upgrade, update-manager, or dist-upgrade?
