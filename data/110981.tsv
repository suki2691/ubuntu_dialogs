2010-06-23T06:46:00.000Z	iantlopp		I'm trying to write information into a .txt file from the command line. The line so far (which outputs the text I need to the screen), is "cat */_cards.dat | grep "id=" | cut -d "=" -f 2"
2010-06-23T06:46:00.000Z	iantlopp		what else would I need to add to have it save that data to a .txt file?

2010-06-23T06:46:00.000Z	h00k	iantlopp	it's okay :)
