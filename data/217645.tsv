2012-08-20T23:28:00.000Z	usr13	minimec	unless /home already exists....
2012-08-20T23:28:00.000Z	minimec	usr13	I guess /home exists...
2012-08-20T23:30:00.000Z	usr13	minimec	Well, if /home exists (and his user dir is there)  and there is not a proper fstab entry for it, then editing /etc/fstab is what needs to be done.
