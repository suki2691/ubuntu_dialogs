2009-04-16T10:43:00.000Z	Flannel	aaditya	Get involved.  Easiest way to do that: http://www.ubuntu.com/community/participate  and then once you're involved, to actually apply for membership: http://www.ubuntu.com/community/processes/newmember
2009-04-16T10:46:00.000Z	aaditya	Flannel	Thanks. When would I know that I am "involved"?
