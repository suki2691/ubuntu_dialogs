2007-09-01T13:29:00.000Z	nanley		If ubiquity fails at the migration assistant, can i triage those bugs to migration assistant or should i leave them in ubiquity?

2007-09-01T13:29:00.000Z	xtknight	nanley	 it should probably be in Ubuntu but if ubiquity is the more-encompassing package i guess that's fine
