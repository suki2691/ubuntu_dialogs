2009-03-05T12:42:00.000Z	tsrk		I have two machines.  When I try to SSH from one to the other, the login is incredibly slow (takes about 5 seconds for the password prompt to appear).  When I SSH to any other machine it works fine.  When I ssh to the server from any other machine it works fine.  This problem only occurs with this combination of client and server.  What on earth could be causing this?
