2009-12-25T19:21:00.000Z	Sensiva		Hello All, Did anyone received an error "Intel(0): No valid Modes" after rebooting the paste few days after upgrading?
2009-12-25T19:22:00.000Z	Daughain	Sensiva	Ya might wanna try a fresh install. I ran across a bunch of issues with the upgrade, so far a fresh install has solved a lot of them.
2009-12-25T19:23:00.000Z	Sensiva	Daughain	I meant apt-get upgrade not a release upgrade
2009-12-25T19:23:00.000Z	Daughain	Sensiva	Ah, sorry, can help ya there.
