2008-05-26T15:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	AcornAcorn	 compiz can use 3 different window decorators.. one of them uses the metacity themes.
2008-05-26T15:31:00.000Z	AcornAcorn	Dr_willis	so it's fine for me to just download metacity themes and drag them into the theme manager?
2008-05-26T15:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis	AcornAcorn	 it can use those.. so that should work.
