2007-04-21T13:55:00.000Z	BlackDalek		I got no sound in YouTube.. someone must know how to fix this? All I get from ubuntuforums.org search is the "FIREFOX_DSP="aoss" fix (which doesn't work now) or 1000+ posts telling me to search the forums or links to threads with the "FIREFOX_DSP="aoss" fix - which doesn't work!!! Did I mention the fix which comes up on the forums search which doesn't work?
