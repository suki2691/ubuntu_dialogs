2008-10-18T22:01:00.000Z	mcquaid		i have some vcd content i want to burn to a dvd player as is, no conversion.  The trick that works on most players is leave the video as is but upsample the audio from 44.1 to 48
2008-10-18T22:01:00.000Z	mcquaid		is there easy tools for this or a good guide?
2008-10-18T22:03:00.000Z	mcquaid		yeah i'm sure ffmpeg could do the job, but haven't used it in a bit, would rather not tweak values for a half hour till i get a compliant vcd (well except for the audio)
