2008-12-30T23:07:00.000Z	fisheater		super basic question: does 'sudo get-apt install" get info from the live CD or from the internet?
2008-12-30T23:07:00.000Z	bazhang	fisheater	is the cd in your sources.list?
2008-12-30T23:08:00.000Z	bazhang	fisheater	gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list and put a # in front of cd
