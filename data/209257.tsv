2006-12-12T08:45:00.000Z	rrittenhouse		If i were to install a base install of edgy and only want to install X (for a kiosk environment).. what package(s) would I choose?
2006-12-12T08:46:00.000Z	LjL	rrittenhouse	i'd say ubuntu-minimal and xorg
2006-12-12T08:47:00.000Z	LjL	rrittenhouse	no, xserver-xorg alone doesn't do the trick. you need xorg
2006-12-12T08:47:00.000Z	LjL	rrittenhouse	(which used to be x-window-system)
