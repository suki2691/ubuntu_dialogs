2008-11-20T14:32:00.000Z	matthew_1		I would really like to get My ATI Drivers working, but everytime i enable andactivate them..... my system wont start back up, itll have me reconfigure Xorg, Any ideas on how i can get around this issue?
2008-11-20T14:33:00.000Z	jim_p	matthew_1	are you on 8.10 AND using fglrx?
2008-11-20T14:33:00.000Z	jim_p	matthew_1	or trying to use fglrx?
2008-11-20T14:34:00.000Z	jim_p	matthew_1	then you cant do much. fglrx is STILL incompatible with 8.10's xorg 1.5! better try radeon or radeonhd as drivers
