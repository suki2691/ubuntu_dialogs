2005-05-29T15:04:00.000Z	tonquin		hi all, I'm trying to get sound working in firefox under ubuntu.  I can play cd's and mp3's but links to either format from firefox are silent.  do i need w3codecs (can't find them in synaptic) or some other magic setting?

2005-05-29T15:07:00.000Z	Seveas	tonquin	do you have a plugin that can handle these?
