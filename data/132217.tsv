2011-10-15T21:40:00.000Z	IsleVegan		Aloha, I have always upgraded by disk or via upgrade manager / synaptic but I wanted to minimize network traffic for the ubuntu.com folks and acquired 11.10 via bittorrent this time. I have 11.04 and tried sudo mount -t iso9660 ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386.iso /cdrom -o loop but that doesn't help. It mounts as a volume but I'm not sure how to make it upgrade.
2011-10-15T21:40:00.000Z	phlak_user	IsleVegan	you need to burn the iso to cd/dvd/usb
2011-10-15T21:45:00.000Z	IsleVegan	phlak_user	Do you mean there is no way to upgrade an existing 11.04 system from an iso file on the same system without creating a bootable disc or usb device from the iso? I have read online that others have done what I'd like to do and was hoping I could do the same rather than create additional network traffic from the network upgrade.
