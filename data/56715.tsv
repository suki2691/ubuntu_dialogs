2010-03-29T17:47:00.000Z	letharion		My mysql server won't start because it can't bind to a port, but there's nothing on that port, and even if change it around, it still can't bind. Suggestions?
2010-03-29T17:48:00.000Z	klappi	letharion	do you use the ubuntu package?
2010-03-29T17:50:00.000Z	letharion	klappi	I wasn't the admin to install the server in the first place. I believe so, but how do I check?
