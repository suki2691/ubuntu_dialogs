2007-01-26T08:37:00.000Z	Goldmen		If I use a partition can I access my windows files, like ooo documents
2007-01-26T08:38:00.000Z	Goldmen		Sorry, last question, If a ubuntu partition doesn't work out is it difficult to uninstall?
2007-01-26T08:39:00.000Z	shifteh	Goldmen	: just reformat the partition
