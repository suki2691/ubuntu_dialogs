2007-04-03T05:30:00.000Z	arfy		hi all. I'm trying to update my ubuntu through the console. I run apt-get update. This appears to run, but I keep getting lines like the following.
2007-04-03T05:30:00.000Z	arfy		hit http://nz.archive.ubuntu.com... and nothing seems to download.
2007-04-03T05:30:00.000Z	arfy		at the end, it says downloaded 3b/s, for instance. Is this a problem?
