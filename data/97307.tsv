2008-05-08T16:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	skurakai	 you might want to check out puppy linux, and 'dsl' linux both are designed for very low end machines.
2008-05-08T17:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	skurakai	   Thats a bit of a low end system. Depends on what apps you specificially want to run also. Abiword is a lot lighter then Openoffice.
