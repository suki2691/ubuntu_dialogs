2012-02-26T00:21:00.000Z	mongy	JustSighDudes	if yours is a bit more open, then iptables for only those ports you need, drop everything else, and fail2ban is also a good idea.
2012-02-26T00:22:00.000Z	JustSighDudes	mongy	that's exactly what I'm doing. I'm mostly worried about web app vulnerabilities.
