2010-06-11T22:15:00.000Z	philsf		hi, I can't get my bluetooth adapter to be recognized with Karmic's newer kernels. The last one I got it working it, was the 2.6.31 from beta stage
2010-06-11T22:15:00.000Z	philsf		how can I debug this, so can I open a proper bug?
2010-06-11T22:16:00.000Z	iceroot	philsf	official karmic kernels? or selfbuild kernels?
