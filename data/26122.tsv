2010-09-21T17:07:00.000Z	maedox	mikeconcepts	why would you ask that in #ubuntu?
2010-09-21T17:11:00.000Z	mikeconcepts	maedox	I ment maverick not mandrake, oops
2010-09-21T17:12:00.000Z	maedox	mikeconcepts	ok, fair mistake. Not sure why it takes longer, but I suspect it will change based on network traffic. I have only tested 10.10 for a few hours so I can't say for sure if they changed it.
