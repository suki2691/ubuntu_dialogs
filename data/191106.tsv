2008-06-08T00:35:00.000Z	Wo|f		I have two quick questions, and I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction. I'm trying to get a list of the installed packages on an Ubuntu system. I can't seem to recall how to do it (I've done it on Debian systems before). Second question: How might I go about creating a customized Ubuntu distribution for a LiveCD / install to HD?
