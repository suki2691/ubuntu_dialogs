2011-11-05T09:54:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		I'm not looking for a derivitive, I'm simply asking, if the only functioning laptop I have only has a half gig of RAM, will my Ubuntu have even half of prayer of booting so I can more easily salvage files off of it?
2011-11-05T09:55:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		my main laptop died, this is just a spare that I happened to have, it's only got 512 MB of RAM.....
2011-11-05T09:56:00.000Z	_r00t_	Geoffrey2	the problem is not booting or the OS .... the problem will be running apps. Browsers these days consume memory like it's free air
2011-11-05T09:58:00.000Z	_r00t_	Geoffrey2	why not turn the machine in to a thin client
