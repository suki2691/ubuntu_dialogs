2008-11-22T04:52:00.000Z	hmw		i had compiz running, then i accidently unchecked "Mirror Screens" in the resolution settings. Now my Radeon9600 is in clone mode and i cant activate the advanced graphics stuff anymore. Can i reset the thing? Where does the ATI driver store its settings?
2008-11-22T04:54:00.000Z	Fougner	hmw	try "aticonfig --initiate" or something in terminal
2008-11-22T04:55:00.000Z	Fougner	hmw	I mean, "aticonfig --initial"
2008-11-22T04:56:00.000Z	hmw	Fougner	aah! i now remember that i could "repair" stuff with aticonfig in my previous ubuntu, just forgot, that it existed. i will have to download it, but now i think, i am fine. thx
