2009-12-26T19:50:00.000Z	RFXCasey		I have an old machine with a geforce 4 mx and want to know which version of ubuntu or what driver will give the best video performance or directly support that card in general?
2009-12-26T19:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RFXCasey	 that old a card - its proberly not going to matter much.   the rest of the system specs will proberly be the bottleneck
2009-12-26T19:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RFXCasey	  the old nvidia drivers for that card proberly havent changed in the last few releases. So i doubt if its going tobe noticeable.
2009-12-26T19:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RFXCasey	  it depends on the exact card and exact driver.. Im not sure if that applies to nvidia cards..  since there are the nvidia-legacy drivers in the repos.. it CAN apply to ati cards
