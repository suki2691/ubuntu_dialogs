2008-05-12T01:27:00.000Z	MattCampbell		e.g. system sounds while music is playing
2008-05-12T01:29:00.000Z	MattCampbell		What I'm talking about is just the ability to play more than one sound at a time, e.g. an IM alert while music is playing, as Windows can, regardless of the capabilities of the audio hardware.
