2010-02-23T18:24:00.000Z	luismendes	stdisease	can you give me any directions?
2010-02-23T18:25:00.000Z	stdisease	luismendes	I can give you a ready made small shell script I wrote once, or you can use the package linux-igd
2010-02-23T18:25:00.000Z	stdisease	luismendes	linux-igd would do it all for you AND set up UPnP as well. Unless you're trying to learn iptables of course
