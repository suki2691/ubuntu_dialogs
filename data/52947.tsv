2010-05-23T05:16:00.000Z	pokeh		When I start my computer, I am greeted by a black screen with a blinking underscore in the upper left hand corner (after grub, mind you). After a a bit, it then goes into the Lucid loading screen with the nice graphics (plymouth). However, it is very brief. I suspect that I am spending most of my time in the blank/blink screen, and very little time in the actual loading screen. Does anyone know why this is?

2010-05-23T05:18:00.000Z	pokeh	Andorin	Lol, it's not particularly "bothersome", but if there's an easy fix I wouldn't mind getting rid of that screen and spending more time looking at my beautiful plymouth theme :D
