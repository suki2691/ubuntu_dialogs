2012-01-02T09:21:00.000Z	Golfgeo		Installing lubuntu on my girlfriends laptop (am an avind Debian user myself) and am wondering what rights the default user (one creates with the installer) gets? In other words: Should I first create an Admin type user and then add my girlfriend as a user... I want her to basicly have user level access...
2012-01-02T09:21:00.000Z	Golfgeo		wow, that was a long question in the end :D
