2009-04-27T04:34:00.000Z	MarkJones		Hi peeps, Im considering switching from i386 to AMD64 installation.What is the current standing of the differences of the two? Does the Adobe plugin on there webiste work for both systems and if so, does it work equally well on both? Also does AMD64 have an equal number of packages/apps as compared to i386?
