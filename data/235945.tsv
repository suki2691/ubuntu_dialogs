2005-05-28T11:42:00.000Z	rexykik		I just installed Kubuntu and some of my packages are corrupted...the Kcontrol package, which obviously holds a good deal of weight under KDE, seeing as many things have dependencies on it. I want to fix it, but apt-get isnt working, so I was told I need to delete all the partials from my partial directory and then apt-get update apt-get install...which directory is the partials directory?
