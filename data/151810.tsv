2007-04-30T09:55:00.000Z	wiseelben		this is weird: sometimes, I won't be able to connect to http://utexas.edu. I know it's up because other computers can connect it, but whatever I do (clean firefox private data, reset connection), the site is always "down" for me. I also tried pinging it. Any ideas?
