2010-01-05T08:37:00.000Z	tzufli		hello
2010-01-05T08:38:00.000Z	tzufli		can somebody help me install a tar.gz file....i've been reading and trying out different ways from the forums for like 3 hours now
2010-01-05T08:38:00.000Z	faileas	tzufli	you need to extract the tarball, and read the readme in it
2010-01-05T08:39:00.000Z	faileas	tzufli	tar -xf /path/to/tar would be the first step
