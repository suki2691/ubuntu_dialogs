2012-06-22T19:40:00.000Z	zeroasterisk	wylde	ubottu, L3top: well, i hit shift on boot and got into grubâ€¦ and it immediatly started saying "out of range" again on my monitor.  POST/BIOS and my RAID all displayed normally, just fine until GRUB would display, then "out of range".  I thought this was so strange I just switched out my monitor for a spare and I'm still getting it.
