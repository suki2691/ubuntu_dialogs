2008-07-22T05:47:00.000Z	Dfronius	danfg	sweet. Here's the issue. The Winxp system sees me on it's network places, but can't interact with my shares. I can't even see the XP box in my network places, or interact with the files via nautilus. I can how ever, see and interact with shares via terminal commands
