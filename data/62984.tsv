2009-07-20T19:33:00.000Z	p-f	StrangeCharm_	don't do what moncky said, it will quit without saving
2009-07-20T19:34:00.000Z	p-f	StrangeCharm_	what you want is :w, or :wq if you want to quit after saving
2009-07-20T19:34:00.000Z	p-f	StrangeCharm_	if you're still in insert mode, you'll have to press escape first
