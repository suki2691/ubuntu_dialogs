2011-05-03T21:02:00.000Z	TheRedOctober		Anyone noticing high swap usage on a rather vanillia 11.04 desktop install?
2011-05-03T21:04:00.000Z	sipior	TheRedOctober	does iostat show substantial load on the swap partition?
2011-05-03T21:07:00.000Z	TheRedOctober	sipior	not now, iowait is 1% as well.  this machine is rather chill, just sits at work for irc, personal email, ssh home.  it is just peculiar to see swap fill up like that.
2011-05-03T21:08:00.000Z	sipior	TheRedOctober	if the machine is performing fine, i wouldn't worry about it :-)
