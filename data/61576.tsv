2009-03-28T17:33:00.000Z	noxer		I want to use my ubuntu 8.10 to remotely control a laptop in the home lan which has a broken tft display ... it is connected to a TV ... its purpose is to serve as a kind of "media player" for swf/divx/xvid streams on websites ... simply watch stuff like youtube on tv .... i want to control it from my desktop pc which runs ubuntu as i said ... and now i d like to run ubuntu on that laptop too ... do i need a server or a desktop versi

2009-03-28T17:36:00.000Z	Esvandiary	noxer	that'd probably be best, yep
