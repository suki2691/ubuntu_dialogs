2005-06-30T12:05:00.000Z	vince_	budluva1	well ubuntu is a easy install and configures stuff for you. It's better for newbies because they could spend like 20 hours or more tying to configure debian to work
2005-06-30T12:06:00.000Z	budluva1	vince_	yar, my first debian install were kind of hairy, but not too many problems, so ubuntu is based off of debian and is more newbie-ish / desktop-user orientated?
2005-06-30T12:07:00.000Z	vince_	budluva1	yep it's great for desktop users! It owns! But i'm sure debian owns in othe areas like server mode
