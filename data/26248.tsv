2010-09-25T01:30:00.000Z	antIP		Does anyone have any idea how to get Ubuntu 10.04 to show proper battery life? I have a laptop that shows 8hrs in Windows 7, and only 4 hrs on the same charge in Ubuntu 10.04.
2010-09-25T01:31:00.000Z	Aemaeth	antIP	does it really last 8 hrs?
2010-09-25T01:32:00.000Z	antIP	Aemaeth	Yes, believe if it or not I have one of those laptops that has ultra long batter life.
