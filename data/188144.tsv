2006-08-07T16:04:00.000Z	T8y8		Hey,  Network Manager stopped saving the WPA key, I don't mind entering the pasword at login, but now it doesn't do that... Any ideas?
2006-08-07T16:04:00.000Z	frying_fish	T8y8	delete the gnome-keyring
2006-08-07T16:06:00.000Z	frying_fish	T8y8	open a terminal in your home directory
2006-08-07T16:16:00.000Z	frying_fish	T8y8	shouldn't be necessary.
