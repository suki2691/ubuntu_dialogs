2009-04-28T18:35:00.000Z	onats_		!raid
2009-04-28T18:36:00.000Z	markl	onats_	every raid type will be different but it is almost always possible
2009-04-28T18:37:00.000Z	onats_	markl	I enabled the hardware raid of my MOBO, but it does not seem to be replicating to the other disk.. how should i be able to check that it did?
