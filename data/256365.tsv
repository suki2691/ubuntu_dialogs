2011-07-08T23:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	l3d	 my android phone can play most anything i toss at it - with the right player.. there are converteres out.. winff with the right presets works well. arista   also works well
2011-07-08T23:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	l3d	 the main trick is to realize the 'default' video player for android is a bit limited. :) moboplayer,  i find can play most everything.
2011-07-08T23:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	l3d	 winff has presets i use all the time.. 1/2 hr show = 30mb or so..  but dont expect the video it makes to look good on anything except the phone.
