2009-05-17T00:36:00.000Z	F3k0r		any reason why I should get server 8.04 instead of 9.04 ?
2009-05-17T00:36:00.000Z	Flannel	F3k0r	It's an LTS.  Supported for 3 years on the desktop.  Vs 9.04, which is only supported for 18 months (so you'll have to upgrade sooner)
2009-05-17T00:36:00.000Z	Flannel	F3k0r	For server, 8.04 is supported for 5 years.
2009-05-17T00:38:00.000Z	Flannel	F3k0r	I would suggest 8.04 for a server, yes.  You can upgrade straight to 10.04 when it comes out, etc.
