2010-02-19T14:39:00.000Z	BusMaster		i installed acrobat reader and it has taken over firefox, which uses it to show pdf's within the browser, even though the firefox setting is set to "ask me" for pdf files. how do I fix this?

2010-02-19T14:41:00.000Z	BusMaster	kinja-sheep	Edit->preferences->Applications shows "PDF Document" set to "Always Ask"
2010-02-19T14:41:00.000Z	BusMaster	kinja-sheep	but it doesn't ask..it just opens the pdf in acrobat within the browser
