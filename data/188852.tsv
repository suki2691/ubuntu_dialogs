2006-05-01T08:08:00.000Z	N2DIY	ajayc	my laptop won't boot from the cd, I'm trying to figure out where the install file is, no joy yet.
2006-05-01T08:08:00.000Z	ajayc	N2DIY	though 4.10 boots damn fine
2006-05-01T08:09:00.000Z	N2DIY	ajayc	hmm, I have 5.10, and it is my first time playing with Ubuntu. I managed to get FC3 on the laptop.
