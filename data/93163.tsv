2009-04-27T16:54:00.000Z	ienorand	sint	I'm not sure on that one, I've had some issues with it messing the filesystem, but then, that could be just the usb-stick I run everything off becoming a bit to old...
2009-04-27T16:55:00.000Z	sint	ienorand	i just saw it while installing and thought in using it. but i care about my data and never had problems with ext3. i think i can wait until its more stable. maybe in 9.10
