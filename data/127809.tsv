2007-07-26T12:18:00.000Z	coastermaster		My Dell Inspiron 6000 keeps hanging when I try to suspend.  The system hangs with a blank screen and my only choice is to hold down the power button and do a hard-boot.  I've tried everything on Google to no avail.  I found this thread in the forums and tried it, but it didn't work (instead it hung at a login screen) [http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=471855&highlight=dell+suspend]
