2011-07-19T11:28:00.000Z	frax	kroq-gar78	the partition which would hold /home/frax/.
2011-07-19T11:29:00.000Z	frax	kroq-gar78	which is where I'm holding the backup of my old home folder as well.
2011-07-19T11:29:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	frax	have a look at this, see if it will answer your question: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/separatehome
