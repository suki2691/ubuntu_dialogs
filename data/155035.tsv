2007-12-29T07:18:00.000Z	kriel	pteague	ehheh. True. and no, i posted it for file fragmentation. What I was wondering is, is there a way to verify that my drive geometry is at least reasonably correct?
2007-12-29T07:22:00.000Z	kriel	pteague	yeah, i understand that... although i didn't know it before, i understand it ~.^;  but im talking at more of a hard drive configuration level, not necessarily a FAT* vs. ext* comparison.
