2009-06-06T09:21:00.000Z	chronographer		hi all i'm having trouble setting up my second ethernet card. First card (eth0) set using wicd connects fine, browsing internet through that. I have another card which I like yo use for crossover cable for file transfer but I can't set it up. I tried statically in interfaces and also tried using wicd. What are suggestions.
