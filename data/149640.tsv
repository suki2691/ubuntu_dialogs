2009-01-15T21:14:00.000Z	Adam_		One of the things I don't like about ubuntu, and I hope someone can tell me I'm wrong, is I can never tell where something installs via apt-get, and to remove it, I have pick through the folders manually. i.e. XBMC
2009-01-15T21:14:00.000Z	Adam_		see I tried that, but it never seems to work

2009-01-15T22:20:00.000Z	Adam_	Pici	was wondering if anyone was going to say anything
