2011-05-31T22:03:00.000Z	KM0201	phox_	but some newer nvidia devices have been problematic w/ Ubuntu.
2011-06-01T01:18:00.000Z	KM0201	phox_	no.. because to many knuckleheads come here saying "i'm very computer literate".. when in reality they are "windows literate"... the two OS's are almost completely different.. knowing and understanding one, doesn't mean you know and understand the other.
