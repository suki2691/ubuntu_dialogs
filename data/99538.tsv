2008-07-09T01:14:00.000Z	matt444	bobertdos	 i would like evolution to automatically launch into my 4th workspace when my computer starts.  currently i do this manually.
2008-07-09T01:17:00.000Z	matt444	bobertdos	 i will try that.  someone else suggested "Devil's Pie" which looks harder but i'll try that too.
