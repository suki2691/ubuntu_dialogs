2005-10-22T12:44:00.000Z	CosmoDad		can anyone explain why this is true in ubuntu (from wiki): "Be absolutely sure that you disable the debian-marillat repository and update your package database after installing the w32codecs. You will mess up your ubuntu install if you leave it enabled."
2005-10-22T12:44:00.000Z	Remmelas	CosmoDad	yeah, it's true
2005-10-22T12:44:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Remmelas	why is that so?
2005-10-22T12:45:00.000Z	Remmelas	CosmoDad	I've managed to cause file conflicts by inadvertantly installing packages that contained the same files as official ubuntu packages
