2010-07-08T19:46:00.000Z	MTecknology		How can I see what params were used to launch a command?
2010-07-08T19:47:00.000Z	gorgapor	MTecknology	do you just need the command line parameters? that's just import sys; sys.argv
2010-07-08T19:47:00.000Z	MTecknology	gorgapor	I was thinking ps could show me
2010-07-08T19:47:00.000Z	gorgapor	MTecknology	oh, you want the parameters for a command you didn't write
