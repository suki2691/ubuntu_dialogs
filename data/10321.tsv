2012-02-13T05:39:00.000Z	joallard		I am experiencing this bug (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=658600), but it says "fixed". What now?
2012-02-13T05:40:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	joallard	It might not have been pushed out as an update yet... Once something is fixed there is still more testing
2012-02-13T05:40:00.000Z	joallard	pragmaticenigma	so how I do I stop the bug?
2012-02-13T05:41:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	joallard	Most cases you may have to wait... We are only a couple months away from the realese of 12.04... I would see if it gets fixed then
