2010-04-20T10:01:00.000Z	Wingless		Is there a way to tell either gedit or scite that the encoding of the file I am trying to read is ISO-2022-JP?  If there is not, then is anyone familiar with a text editor other than vim or emacs that they know can support this encoding? Do I really just have to learn how to use emacs and vim? All I want to do is fill in the blanks in a template file...
