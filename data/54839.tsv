2009-06-09T02:45:00.000Z	rallEy4		hehe, okay more specifically: is there a way to toggle or redirect JOINS, PARTS, or QUITS to another window?
2009-06-09T02:45:00.000Z	roobly_roo	rallEy4	Yes, it's my default irc program, but I've barely scratched the surface of what it can really do.  There's a #irssi channel.
2009-06-09T02:45:00.000Z	rallEy4	roobly_roo	Yes, I'm in there as well.
