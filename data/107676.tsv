2008-04-06T23:11:00.000Z	francesco		I have a problem. This morning everything was OK, but now I can't hear any sound. I think I must set the volume control by the terminal, but don't know how. Could somebody help me?

2008-04-06T23:13:00.000Z	francesco	Skitt	Thank you. I still can't understand why my audio doesn't work. I have a double partition, and in Windows XP it works.
2008-04-06T23:15:00.000Z	francesco	Skitt	Everything seems to be OK in alsamix. What could the problem be?
