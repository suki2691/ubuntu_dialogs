2007-11-23T18:00:00.000Z	brobostigon	Indephysis	i dont think there is, you may have to go into windows t do that.
2007-11-23T18:01:00.000Z	brobostigon	Indephysis	why d yu have a vfat partition then, if yu dont have windows??
2007-11-23T18:02:00.000Z	brobostigon	Indephysis	linux iteslf doesnt need to be defrag, so n such thing exist for linux, so i dnt think you can get a defrag tool fr any filesystem in linux. b ut i may be wrong.
