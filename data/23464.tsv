2010-10-27T10:03:00.000Z	Guest2051		I added a user to the admin group but the user can't sudo su to root, anyone know why?

2010-10-27T10:06:00.000Z	Guest2051	Scunizi	sudo -i does not work.. I can sudo su to root using the user I used to install ubuntu, how do I duplicate this functionality with a new user?
