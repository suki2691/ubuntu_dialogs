2010-02-16T01:59:00.000Z	ikonia	sir_robert007	dead easy, just use fstab to point at the new partition
2010-02-16T01:59:00.000Z	ikonia	sir_robert007	make sure you've done a mkswap on it first though
2010-02-16T01:59:00.000Z	ikonia	sir_robert007	error 22 is a grub error, you must have done something to make that happen
