2009-02-06T07:19:00.000Z	dkulchenko	porter1	yep, that's the kind of thing that is (unfortunately) forcing me to use Opera
2009-02-06T07:20:00.000Z	porter1	dkulchenko	yeah, I try to use opera, but then eventually it just crashes. My guess is that Flash is still unstable
2009-02-06T07:20:00.000Z	dkulchenko	porter1	yeah, i hate opera. it can't play mp3s without freezing, its download manager sucks, and flash support is horrible
