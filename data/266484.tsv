2010-05-31T15:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Smurfie	 boot a live cd, chroot in, set a new password - is one way
2010-05-31T15:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Smurfie	 you mean you have a working system. that you somehow lost the admin password? and want to change/restore it - without any special booting of live cd, ore recovery mode?
2010-05-31T15:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Smurfie	 revovery mode or live cd.. thats your options
