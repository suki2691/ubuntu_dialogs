2012-08-16T05:36:00.000Z	NetEcho		where might I find the Screen and Device configurations for Xorg on the livecd? I'm trying to diagnose my config on a live install and the livecd seems to support my card nicely
2012-08-16T05:36:00.000Z	iceroot	NetEcho	there is no static config anymore by default
2012-08-16T05:37:00.000Z	iceroot	NetEcho	udev is doing that automaticly on every start
2012-08-16T05:37:00.000Z	NetEcho	iceroot	is there still a way to see how it's configuring it?
