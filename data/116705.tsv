2007-10-23T21:36:00.000Z	emmajane	anandanbu	when you put in a blank disk I believe it asks you what kind of CD you want to make?
2007-10-23T21:37:00.000Z	anandanbu	bruenig	is there any tutorial available for this
2007-10-23T21:37:00.000Z	emmajane	anandanbu	or do you want to "rip" the ISO of an existing CD?
