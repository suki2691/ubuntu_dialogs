2010-09-26T09:30:00.000Z	unkmar	kaizen	wouldn't -dev mean you plan to modify source code?
2010-09-26T09:31:00.000Z	kaizen	unkmar	no i am trying to build another source and it requires zlib
2010-09-26T09:31:00.000Z	kaizen	unkmar	configure: error: Zlib header (zlib.h) not found. Tor requires zlib to build.
