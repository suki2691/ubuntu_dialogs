2006-11-14T09:07:00.000Z	vincenz		Alright, I will probably get burned for asking this.  But how do I run windows inside ubuntu?  Are there any solutions for this (and don't tell me wine, wine doesn't run powerpoint)
2006-11-14T09:09:00.000Z	vincenz		I tried installing vmware but that completely borked when it tried to compile a module against the kernel
2006-11-14T09:09:00.000Z	b1ackBart	vincenz	use crossover
2006-11-14T09:11:00.000Z	b1ackBart	vincenz	download the beta version of crossover and test it to be sure; works OK for me
