2009-02-12T08:09:00.000Z	secvuln		adobe flash says that /usr/lib/mozilla is not a valid installation path. Is that not the right path?
2009-02-12T08:09:00.000Z	mzz	secvuln	are you trying to install flash by hand? Why not use the package (iirc it's called flashplugin-nonfree)?
2009-02-12T08:10:00.000Z	mzz	secvuln	I don't follow.
