2010-03-10T20:34:00.000Z	djoef		Hi, what would you people recommend to backup a ubuntu disk ? (I want the backup to be browsable) I do have a bootable resque disk having gparted etc...
2010-03-10T20:35:00.000Z	djoef		I tried using rsync, but i get errors exiting the command.. we are talking about 4million files.
2010-03-10T20:37:00.000Z	djoef		I only ask to tell me what tool you would use for my purpose
2010-03-10T20:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	djoef	rsync (or something based on it like rsnapshot)
