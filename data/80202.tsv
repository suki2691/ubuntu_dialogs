2008-12-02T20:40:00.000Z	NicEXE		I get no sound at all... when I go to sound application and press the test key this error shows up "audiotestsrc wave=sine freq=512 ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! gconfaudiosink: Could not open audio device for playback." how can I get my sound back without restarting?
