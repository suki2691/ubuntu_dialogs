2012-05-24T12:15:00.000Z	iceroot	stephanmg	yes
2012-05-24T12:27:00.000Z	stephanmg	iceroot	i just thought ubuntu would be completely different and you should not use the debian stuff.
2012-05-24T12:28:00.000Z	iceroot	stephanmg	because they use different software versions and sometimes different methods
