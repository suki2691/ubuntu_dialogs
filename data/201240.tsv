2006-02-20T15:14:00.000Z	Determinist		i have /dev/hdb , it's a 40 GB drive that's seperated into swap and root for ubuntu. i need to resize the root partition and make it 10 gigs smaller so i could install dapper flight and play with it a bit. I cant use gparted because i'm trying to resize the root partition. is there any other way to resize this partition?

2006-02-20T15:16:00.000Z	ploom	Determinist	I mean using ubuntu live cd for ex
