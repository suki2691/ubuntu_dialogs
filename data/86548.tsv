2008-08-24T23:34:00.000Z	GL-san		no, it is when you create your partition
2008-08-24T23:34:00.000Z	GL-san		and they're going to be written to disk
2008-08-24T23:34:00.000Z	TwoD	GL-san	there was no such option when I installed from the LiveCD I think. And I ran that install 3 times to make sure, before getting it right the 4th (without the IDE plugged in)
