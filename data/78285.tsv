2008-09-27T12:27:00.000Z	OneZero		Hello, I'm downloading a streaming video file at the moment with Mplayer (command:~$ mplayer -dumpstream). It is workign fine, but unfortunately I can download only one file at a time. Does anybody know, how to download several streaming video files simultaneously?
