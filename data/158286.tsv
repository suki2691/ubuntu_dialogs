2010-06-22T17:34:00.000Z	Slart	ham5	perhaps they have too long names, perhaps?
2010-06-22T17:36:00.000Z	Slart	ham5	perhaps there's some other limit you're running into.. total path length.. number of files.. weird non-ascii characters or such?
2010-06-22T17:39:00.000Z	Slart	ham5	you're burning the files as data, right? you're not creating a music cd, or a video dvd ?
