2012-01-23T00:35:00.000Z	reliability		After updating to 3.0.0.15, the internal screen of my hp elitebook 2540p keeps being blank. Strangly, the external screen works. The problem only exists for 3.0.0.15, not for 3.0.0.14. Does someone know what could cause this kind of problem and/or how to solve it?
