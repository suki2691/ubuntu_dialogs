2008-04-28T23:08:00.000Z	John_S_	thebigham	Do you know how to use the "chmod" command? That's what you need if you do it at the command line.
2008-04-28T23:09:00.000Z	thebigham	John_S_	no, can you please explain to me how to do it?
2008-04-28T23:11:00.000Z	John_S_	thebigham	Well if you're not familiar, an easier way is to open up your Nautilus file browser, right-click the file, click "properties", and then go to the "permisssions" tab.
