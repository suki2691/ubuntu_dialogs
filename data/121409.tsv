2007-09-19T15:28:00.000Z	ki4cgp		Hey, I have a USB device that shows up in my lsusb list on my session of X, but when I CTRL+ALT+F9 over to my wife's session that is running at the same time, I can't see the device with lsusb.  I probably missed a setting somewhere in gnome.  Any ideas?

2007-09-19T15:29:00.000Z	ki4cgp	sixpence	yes, I know.  But I don't know where to find the setting to turn USB back on for the other account
