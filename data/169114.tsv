2007-07-14T07:58:00.000Z	johan_		 the gnome File Browser doesn't show me PDF previews on a smb mounted volume. I have changed the preferences (Preview, Show thumbnails -> "Always") so ... am I doing something wrong?
2007-07-14T07:59:00.000Z	xhaan	johan_	did you change it from local files only?
2007-07-14T08:00:00.000Z	johan_	xhaan	yes, i changed it to "Always"
2007-07-14T08:00:00.000Z	xhaan	johan_	oh yeah, i misread sorry
