2007-01-12T06:40:00.000Z	Flannel	rkv	make sure the CD is set to boot before the HD in your BIOS
2007-01-12T06:41:00.000Z	rkv	Flannel	gyaresu : well this ubuntu livecd worked perfectly fine everytime but when i insert the windows XP cd it doesnt goto the setup or anything just directly to grub error
2007-01-12T06:41:00.000Z	Flannel	rkv	ah, in that case, yeah.  the windows CD has problems
