2009-01-15T21:23:00.000Z	ramiro		Hello. I'm trying to set up a cron job by reading https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto on 8.10, but I don't have a system->preferences->scheduled tasks. Do I have to apt-get it?
2009-01-15T21:24:00.000Z	simplexio	ramiro	good old way is to do it from cmdline
2009-01-15T21:25:00.000Z	ramiro	simplexio	I'll probably end up doing it that way even if I do it by gui first, but where do I find the gui?
2009-01-15T21:26:00.000Z	simplexio	ramiro	no idea.. havent see one
