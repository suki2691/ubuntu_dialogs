2012-09-25T17:17:00.000Z	TimothyA		I have come across an urgent issue. I find myself to be unable to start another SSH session to my server, and I'm getting this in /var/log/auth.log: error: Could not load host key: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
2012-09-25T17:17:00.000Z	TimothyA		anyone could help me with that?
