2008-06-29T23:35:00.000Z	Fryguy--	BlackRece	that's not very informative.  What's the error, what nics, what makes you think they are set up perfectly etc
2008-06-30T00:05:00.000Z	Fryguy--	BlackRece	why are you directing that to me?
2008-06-30T00:07:00.000Z	Fryguy--	BlackRece	i don't think i ever asked you to do that.  I don't know anything about firestarter.
