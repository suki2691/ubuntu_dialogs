I've already googled it to no avail, but i did find something that was similar to my problem but i have problems getting it to work : http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-321807.html

2008-03-27T23:51:00.000Z	hexon	pike__	I have 2 gigs of ram and my swap is about 3 gigs
2008-03-27T23:52:00.000Z	hexon	pike__	I was able to see that 0 out of 2996112 was being used of my swap by typing "free" in the terminal
