2007-06-24T10:34:00.000Z	Frogzoo	narthollis	only way I know is to run a console off the serial port
2007-06-24T10:34:00.000Z	Frogzoo	narthollis	but usually just fixing whatever driver is the problem is all you need
2007-06-24T10:34:00.000Z	narthollis	Frogzoo	yeah, i dont know what module is causing the issue though
