2008-07-09T17:50:00.000Z	ia	ne2k__	Ubuntu uses not vanilla kernel - it uses kernel with additional patches from Ubuntu developers. I would like to know, where can i download this patches separately.
2008-07-09T17:51:00.000Z	ne2k__	ia	ah. I presume there is a kernel source package as well as binary packages. Not sure if you can get the patches, but you'll be able to get the patched source from there certainly. other suggestion would be to join the mailing list of the kernel development and ask there
