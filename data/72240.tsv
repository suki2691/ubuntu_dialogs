2010-01-30T16:37:00.000Z	medionpal		I have a question, I installed thunderbird 3.0.1 in ubuntu but the screenshots on the thunderbird website look very different! Mine looks like the 2.0 thunderbird.. there is no "people" field in my thunderbird... what is wrong?
2010-01-30T16:38:00.000Z	medionpal		well I just depacked the archive and ran ./thunderbird
2010-01-30T16:39:00.000Z	papul	medionpal	how did u install thunderbird?
