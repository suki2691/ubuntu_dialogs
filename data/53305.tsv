2009-07-01T22:05:00.000Z	webereinc		Can someone tell me how I might add a request to have MSSQL compiled, by default in PHP5 for both the desktop and server versions going forward?
2009-07-01T22:05:00.000Z	Pici	webereinc	Have you filed a bug against the php5 package?
2009-07-01T22:06:00.000Z	webereinc	Pici	- I didn't know if this would be considered a 'bug' as opposed to just a request
