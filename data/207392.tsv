2005-11-18T14:44:00.000Z	switchcat		:(  my ubuntu keeps screwing up at different parts during the install. :(  I've seemingly made a few coasters already before I go and download the ISO again, can anybody make any suggestions on writing the ISO (right now using a winXP system) or figuring out if it's soething else wrong with the ubuntu install process?

2005-11-18T14:45:00.000Z	switchcat	kestas	- uhm in 'retrieving' different packages and stuff, on my first coaster it was at varying places, so I thought it might be dirt, on my second one, it's the kernel..
