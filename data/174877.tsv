2008-06-01T20:21:00.000Z	trident523	ImDude	Why don't you browse to the directory? Or, even better... use DAAP.
2008-06-01T20:23:00.000Z	trident523	ImDude	noobuntu: Well, atleast in rhythmbox, it's an enable-able plugin. In amarok, not so much.
2008-06-01T20:25:00.000Z	trident523	ImDude	noobuntu: I forgot how I got amarok to do that kind of sharing, but rhythmbox has a plugin called "DAAP music sharing." Enable that, and if the other computer is serving, it should show up shortly.
