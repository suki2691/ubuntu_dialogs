2008-05-01T03:57:00.000Z	AnthroTechie		I've been having a problem since upgrading to Hardy. Can't enable desktop effects in the "Visual Effects" tab in System-Preferences.  When I try to a pop window says "Desktop Effects could not be enabled." I already installed Advanced Desktop Effects Settings.
