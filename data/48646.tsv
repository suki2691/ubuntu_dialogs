After booting into Ubuntu you should properly edit /etc/default/grub ( to have GRUB_TIMEOUT=-1 ) and remove /boot/grub/custom.cfg.

2012-08-21T03:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	coldpizza72i	It's *not* that the custom.cfg overrides the grub.cfg. The grub.cfg generated by update-grub/grub-mkconfig contains a line which sources /boot/grub/custom.cfg if it exists: if [ -f  $prefix/custom.cfg ]; then source $prefix/custom.cfg; fi
