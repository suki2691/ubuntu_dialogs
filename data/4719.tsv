2012-03-11T06:48:00.000Z	YohanMeister		I have a uefi motherboard in the desktop machine I just built. I've gone through hell and back with 2 different distros before this. Can someone please tell me: If I pop an ubuntu 64 bit installation disk in that machine, is it going to install a uefi bootable system?
