2010-09-11T10:50:00.000Z	sculptured		hey everyone, i'm trying to install beryl 2.1 on lucid lynx. i added the lines suggested on http://tnlessone.wordpress.com/2007/03/17/upgrading-to-beryl-020/ so that synaptic would auto update it (and i could download beryl with apt-get), but i'm getting a 403 forbidden error from beryl-project.org. what's going on?

2010-09-11T10:51:00.000Z	sculptured	wizzzzzzard	no i havent, in fact i didnt even know it existed.
2010-09-11T10:51:00.000Z	wizzzzzzard	sculptured	Beryl was merged with the Fusion project and became compiz fusion, installing beryl would be pretty much putting your X system into a highly unstable state. Check out Compiz instead.
