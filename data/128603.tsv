2007-07-08T09:21:00.000Z	Radical		I'm trying to use gparted to manipulate my partitions but it won't let me delete or resize any of the partitions.
2007-07-08T09:22:00.000Z	nickrud	Radical	are they mounted?
2007-07-08T09:23:00.000Z	nickrud	Radical	you can't work on mounted partitions
2007-07-08T09:23:00.000Z	Radical	nickrud	okay.  I'll see what I can find on google to unmount them.
