2010-04-25T00:50:00.000Z	mozir		I'm trying to get started with GCC, but it keeps saying that my input file doesn't exist. Where do I have to put it so I can just access it via "gcc myfile.cpp"?
2010-04-25T00:52:00.000Z	mozir		Sorry, disconnected. Does somebody know what I'm doing wrong with GCC?

2010-04-25T00:53:00.000Z	mozir	moetunes	I tried it with giving the whole path too
