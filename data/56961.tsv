2010-03-11T05:43:00.000Z	CountDown	LinuxGuy2009	Thanks.  There's a lot of chatter about a bug in 9.10 regarding this feature.   Good to get another data point.
2010-03-11T05:44:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	CountDown	In 9.04 in mouse preferences there is a check box. If 9.10 is missing this then your probably screwed.
2010-03-11T05:45:00.000Z	CountDown	LinuxGuy2009	That's what I was afraid of.  Thanks for checking.
