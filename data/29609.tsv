2010-06-30T04:15:00.000Z	Jans		Trying to do a clean install of Lucid. Desktop won't format hard disks, alternate starts to install and gives message: Please insert the disc labeled: 'Ubuntu 10.04 LTS _Lucid Lynx_ - Release i386 (20100427.1)' in the drive '/cdrom/' and press enter" No joy from putting Desktop disk in and hitting enter. Can someone help? This is my office workstation and I've been down two days now.
