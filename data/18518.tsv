2012-02-15T22:15:00.000Z	Viman		When I convert OGG to AVI using mencoder/ffmpeg, the quality drops real bad. Is there another way to do it? I can't edit OGG (ironical, isn't it?).

2012-02-15T22:16:00.000Z	danileigh79	Viman	should be different quality settings in fmpeg
2012-02-15T22:17:00.000Z	danileigh79	Viman	should be to change fps rate in the main conversion window
