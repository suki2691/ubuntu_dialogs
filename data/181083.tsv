2007-09-01T15:48:00.000Z	zegevrijtty		yes you can on 128 even on 64 but performance would bne much better using fluxbox or icewm or equinox
2007-09-01T15:50:00.000Z	zegevrijtty		use xubuntu as base install and from there install fluxbox icewm .. etc and try em all
2007-09-01T15:51:00.000Z	bruenig	zegevrijtty	server probably be better
