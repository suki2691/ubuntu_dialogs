2012-06-18T02:42:00.000Z	Laban		I just re-installed 12.04 and thought I'd setup internet sharing from the GUI this time.
2012-06-18T02:43:00.000Z	Laban		I think it's working, but how do I change the internal IP-range?
2012-06-18T02:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Laban	you can set IP using network manager
