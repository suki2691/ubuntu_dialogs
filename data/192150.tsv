2006-04-04T08:32:00.000Z	nsmith		When I open the synaptic package manager I get the fallowing error W: Couldn't stat source package list http://cv.archive.ubuntu.com breezy/universe Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/cv.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_breezy_universe_binary-i386_Packages) - stat (2 No such file or directory)  What does this mean and how can I fix it?
