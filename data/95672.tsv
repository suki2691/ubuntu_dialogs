2012-03-30T02:58:00.000Z	dalek_		running ubuntu 11.04 , while using Gimp, the mouse pointer frequently locks up for no reason. I can move the pointer around, but none of the mouse button function and I can't click anything either within Gimp or Gnome desktop. This only ever happens while using Gimp. Mouse buttons eventually un-locks if I fight with the keyboard for a minute. What causes this and is there any way to fix it?
