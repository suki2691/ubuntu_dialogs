2007-04-20T15:32:00.000Z	Cryoniq		Problem: I just upgraded to 7.04. And I am using a ATI Radeon 9800 Pro. When I start up gnome things are totaly laggy and strange, and beryl resulted in 100% white screen (configured for AIGLX DRI). This sounds familiar?

2007-04-20T15:34:00.000Z	starman	Cryoniq	tons of things changed
2007-04-20T15:34:00.000Z	Cryoniq	starman	oki.. so the ati open source drivers was updated as well?
