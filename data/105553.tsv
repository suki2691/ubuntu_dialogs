2008-11-12T17:12:00.000Z	RiRa_DigiFly_		just upgraded to ubunto 8.10. very big mistake. the dont warn you that kde3.5 will be replaced with kde 4.1. i can only say kde4.1 is terrible. applet missing my font is reset. bad. and the most bad thing. kde4.1 just feels like windows and it looks like windows. and its stressing the same like windows to. kde3.5 is relaxed and better look to. whats quikest way to downgrade.  ?
