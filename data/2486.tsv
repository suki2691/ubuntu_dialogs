2012-06-15T16:51:00.000Z	gry	T3X	darkstat ntop and probably few others; 'apt-cache search monitor bandwidth' 'apt-cache search network usage'
2012-06-15T16:52:00.000Z	T3X	gry	these tools will allow me to monitor also the bandwidth of the other machines on the network? because i tried ntop and tcptrack they allow only to monitor my local interfaces on my comuter
