2008-06-09T10:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	luddite	find webpages with better quality images?
2008-06-09T10:49:00.000Z	luddite	Madpilot	those pages dont interst me ;-)
2008-06-09T10:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	luddite	heh. Seriously, are you sure it's just the browser? Install Opera or a browser w/ no connection to Firefox, and try the same pages there.
