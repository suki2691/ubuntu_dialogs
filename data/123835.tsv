2008-05-25T06:10:00.000Z	nhamilton		I've got a really annoying problem, and can't seem to find any solutions on the web. I'm using Pidgen in Hardy, and I'm getting dropped messages. I've had friends tell me they've sent mesages and I haven't got them, and in addition my messages often will fail with various failure messages from pidgen. Anyone got any ideas to point me in the right direction to fixing this?
