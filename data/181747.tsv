2006-06-05T11:01:00.000Z	traumatic		I just installed ubuntu and somehow managed to put it on a 2 GB partition, and so I have a 70 GB partition as well.  I want to combine the two of them into a single partition, but I'm not sure how to go about doing that.
2006-06-05T11:01:00.000Z	wastrel	traumatic	 easiest just to reinstall, and repartition during the install process
2006-06-05T11:04:00.000Z	traumatic	wastrel	 Should I manually partition the drive during the install, i let it do it itself and I thought I allocated 100% though that may have been me allocating 100% to a secondary partition somehow
2006-06-05T11:04:00.000Z	wastrel	traumatic	 manual partition if you have an idea what you're doing.  it's not too hard with the graphical installer
