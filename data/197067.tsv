2006-05-26T09:40:00.000Z	ubuntu233		I am trying to install GRUB using the Live CD (Ubuntu is already installed, apparently GRUB is not). grub-install -h says you need to specify install_device, so I did "sudo grub-install /dev/sda", but it says "/dev/mapper/casper-snapshot does not have any corresponding BIOS drive."
2006-05-26T09:41:00.000Z	ubuntu233		Any ideas?
2006-05-26T09:43:00.000Z	ubuntu233		What would people in IRC do if every Linux package/command had not been "thoroughly" documented?
2006-05-26T09:44:00.000Z	noiesmo	ubuntu233	ask more questions hehe
