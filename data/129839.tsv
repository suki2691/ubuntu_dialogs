2007-08-03T05:27:00.000Z	heroin	evri2	did u only install KDE and GNOME or Kubuntu-desktop and Ubuntu-Desktop?
2007-08-03T05:29:00.000Z	evri2	heroin	i actually have Ubuntu Desktop and i think i use more kde apps ,so i think installing kde would reduce my cpu usage.
2007-08-03T05:32:00.000Z	evri2	heroin	i started to think that KDE is better for me and i want to try by not harming something.I think it won't harm but incase,i wanted to ast someone who has done this.
