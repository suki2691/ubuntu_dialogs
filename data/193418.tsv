2006-04-22T16:20:00.000Z	Omeg		I've got a general Linux question. I just downloaded what is supposed to be a demo of Sim City 3000 for Linux, but after extracting the .gz, it seems that I have a .run file.
2006-04-22T16:21:00.000Z	Omeg		It's about 180 MB in size and I don't know what to do with it.
2006-04-22T16:22:00.000Z	netman1	Omeg	to check you could do "file .run-file"
