2009-02-01T20:30:00.000Z	armornick		for a commandline install, does ubuntu needs to download files during the install?
2009-02-01T20:31:00.000Z	rakudave	armornick	no, but it is advisable, as it will download the lates language packs and updates
2009-02-01T20:32:00.000Z	rakudave	armornick	it will work without a connection, you can update later
