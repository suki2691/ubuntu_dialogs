2006-07-26T06:27:00.000Z	Xui1		I am new to linux, trying to install new ATI drivers, but I get an error when running the install ( must run as root) does Ubuntu even have a root??
2006-07-26T06:27:00.000Z	sethk	Xui1	yes it has a root, but the password for root is probably not set
2006-07-26T06:28:00.000Z	sethk	Xui1	you can do what you need, most likely, with sudo, or you can set the root password
