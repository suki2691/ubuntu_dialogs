2007-12-13T12:06:00.000Z	Mondragon		Can anyone tell me the suggested ubuntu way of upgrading my kernel to 2.6.23?  (I downloaded the tarball, made a kpkg, but that's where things went awry...)
2007-12-13T12:07:00.000Z	macogw	Mondragon	not sure there is an "ubuntu way"...just compile it
2007-12-13T12:07:00.000Z	macogw	Mondragon	i guess maybe you can checkinstall instead of make install so you can remove it from apt
2007-12-13T12:08:00.000Z	macogw	Mondragon	ah idk then
