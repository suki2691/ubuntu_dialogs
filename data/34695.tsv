2011-05-21T02:47:00.000Z	lallenlowe	multipass	how are you sharing it?
2011-05-21T02:48:00.000Z	lallenlowe	multipass	well, he is probably either using smb or afp
2011-05-21T02:49:00.000Z	lallenlowe	multipass	if he is using smb, it should (theoretically) show up in the "Entire Network" location in the nautilus sidebar
