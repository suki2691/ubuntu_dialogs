2012-04-27T03:18:00.000Z	Hebram		I am interested in changing the icons of a few folders to custom icons.  Can someone please assist me?

2012-04-27T03:20:00.000Z	Hebram	Crowley2	 Thank you!  I did not see that option earlier.  I will clean my glasses and look again.
2012-04-27T03:23:00.000Z	Hebram	Crowley2	 I do not see "options" as an option.  I do have "properties", but I see no where in the tabs to point to an icon file.
