2008-06-01T05:19:00.000Z	larson9999		i've been getting lots crashes in ubuntu.  about 1-2 a day for a LONG time.  since feisty.  i always chalked it up to flash, nvidia or sometime.  i did full reinstalls as well as upgrades and no luck.  recently i did some distro shopping and discovered this machine doesn't crash as all in sabayon, arch, or slacware.

2008-06-01T05:21:00.000Z	larson9999	Bodsda	not really.  i'd like to give this laptop to my 7 year old with ubuntu since it's a bit more user friendly.  but i don't want to give it to him while it's crashy pants
