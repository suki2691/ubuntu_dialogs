2006-03-05T16:03:00.000Z	yalu		I am a Debian user and I would like to know if there are any packages in Ubuntu which are called the same as in Debian, but are actually packaged differently or built on ubuntu systems? I'm planning an Ubuntu install and I would like to share /var/cache/apt/archives like I do now with my Debian machines
2006-03-05T16:03:00.000Z	yalu		but I want to avoid making a mess
2006-03-05T16:05:00.000Z	gnomefreak	yalu	its very unsfae to mix packages
2006-03-05T16:06:00.000Z	yalu	gnomefreak	I have been mixing the three Debian branches for years. Despite what people say, I never had a single problem.
