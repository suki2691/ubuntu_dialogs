2011-01-28T23:17:00.000Z	Hans_Henrik		have a problem with a laptop, the WinXP installed on it wont boot at all, saying something about "operating system not found", and when i boot Ubuntu LiveCD, it (at first, aparently would not boot), uses 10+ hours on the loading screen to boot, how should i debug this?  ;it finally booted after loading for 10 hours +, ubuntu LiveCD 10.10
2011-01-28T23:18:00.000Z	Hans_Henrik		my dad suspects it has a harddrive problem and tries "read sector" a million times
2011-01-28T23:19:00.000Z	ezra-s	Hans_Henrik	nothing much to do against a faulty harddrive, that's a hardware problem
2011-01-28T23:19:00.000Z	Hans_Henrik	ezra-s	but why would LiveCD "try ubuntu" use 10 hours++ to boot?
