2010-10-11T03:15:00.000Z	rupok		after installing ubuntu 10.10 with wubi I cannot seem to find the place for my windows files. I checked in places, My computer lists 500gb system reserved and file system as mounted.

2010-10-11T03:21:00.000Z	rupok	sebsebseb	how would I go to host > places. All i see is places in the taskbar. Is that where I am supposed to go to see windows files? I went there but cannot find it. Am i supposed to mount anything?
