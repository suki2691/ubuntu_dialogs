2011-04-03T00:39:00.000Z	_Alex__		Is it a good idea to set up a RAID 1 (Mirroring) on 2 2Tb Drives?
2011-04-03T00:39:00.000Z	DasEi	_Alex__	yes, why not
2011-04-03T00:41:00.000Z	DasEi	_Alex__	won't save a backup , but lowers the chance of irrecoverable hardware failure for important data
2011-04-03T00:42:00.000Z	DasEi	_Alex__	yes, but backup is fine for user/software related errors
