2010-01-20T20:23:00.000Z	juniper		I am looking to create some sort of front door security system which takes a snapshot of whoever is at the door when they press the buzzer.  I already have the camera I need to use.  And I guess I could wire the doorbell in as a key press or a mouse click.  But I doubt there is any suitable software.  I would probably have to graft something.Any ideas?
