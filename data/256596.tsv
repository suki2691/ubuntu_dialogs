2011-07-25T20:16:00.000Z	abcdefg		I did into sudo apt-get install  kde-full now unity is broken with no sidebar or panel. i'm on it via unity --reset
2011-07-25T20:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	abcdefg	 odd.. kde shouldent affect unity at all
2011-07-25T20:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	abcdefg	 i will also add.. that unity is so fragile here.. i look at it wrong and it breaks.. :)
2011-07-25T20:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	abcdefg	 guess you can try. but with unity theres no guarentees. :)
