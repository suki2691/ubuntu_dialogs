2008-02-06T02:16:00.000Z	strabes	proppi	yeah, that's my problem. A lot of times I make a one-letter typo and the correct spelling is obvious. When I right click on the word, there's only one spelling suggestion. I just want to know if there's a way to make openoffice just go ahead and change it when there's only 1 suggestion anyway.
