2007-10-19T22:16:00.000Z	Colro		does anyone know why firefox might be taking 100% of my cpu time with only five tabs open? ive got an amd 1800+ and 1.5gb of ram..it never did this under windows =|

2007-10-19T22:17:00.000Z	Colro	penguin42	flash is running in one -- is flash just extremely slow for nix?
2007-10-19T22:17:00.000Z	penguin42	Colro	Try right clicking on the flash  you can tell it to be slower
