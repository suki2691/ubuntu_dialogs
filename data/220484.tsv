2007-05-30T15:54:00.000Z	virgil		Any chance somebody could help me? My computer froze while installing cedega, and now I can't open package manager because it says I need to reinstall cedega, trying to run the cedega package tells me it may be corrupt or I am not allowed to run it, and trying to remove it through aptitude tells me I need to reinstall it first.

2007-05-30T15:57:00.000Z	virgil		What is the etiquette in here? If I don't get an answer to my question do I just repeat it every 5 minutes?
