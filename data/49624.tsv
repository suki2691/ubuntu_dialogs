2012-11-01T18:21:00.000Z	LucidGuy		Got me an older Ubuntu 8.10 server I would like to upgrade to 12.04.  Now in the indeal world I would back-up the system perform a fresh clean install .. and then restore all my apps/services/data.  Unfortunately that can be a pain.  Any recommended upgrade path?
2012-11-01T18:21:00.000Z	bekks	LucidGuy	8.10->9.04->9.10->10.04->12.04
2012-11-01T18:22:00.000Z	bekks		Unfortunately, 9.04 and 9.10 arent supported anymore.
2012-11-01T18:22:00.000Z	LucidGuy	bekks	Have you tried performing an upgrade path like that?  Sounds scarry .. as in Ill break things.
