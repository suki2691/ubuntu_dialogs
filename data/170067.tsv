2007-11-07T10:29:00.000Z	jbinder		Does anyone know the year that linux is supposed to crash because the time will switch to like 19** because it will become negative?
2007-11-07T10:29:00.000Z	mssever	jbinder	2038 sometime
2007-11-07T10:30:00.000Z	mssever	jbinder	but with the changeover to 64 bit, it will be much longer
