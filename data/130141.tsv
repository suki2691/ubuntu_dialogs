2007-06-21T07:45:00.000Z	shadowarts		the code seems to be licesensed under the BSD or at your option the GPL
2007-06-21T07:46:00.000Z	RAOF	shadowarts	They're probable restricted in the same way the the ipw3945 drivers are restricted: the code is free, but you need a non-free binary firmware blob to actually do anything with them.
2007-06-21T07:47:00.000Z	shadowarts	RAOF	does ubuntu package the firmware with the distro then?
