2005-03-13T08:22:00.000Z	veristead		seemingly the file on limewire.com is in rpm format and i extract it, but in the installation files it says i need to cd to the directory i downloaded the installer, but i cnt find the installer. and then i need to go to console and type sh ./LimeWireLinux.bin
2005-03-13T08:22:00.000Z	veristead		but it doesn't exist
2005-03-13T08:23:00.000Z	angelharp	veristead	try ./LimeWire.sh
