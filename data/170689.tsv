2006-08-20T10:36:00.000Z	exs		 Hello guys. I'm currently in the process of installing my graphic chipset drivers (openchrome) here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenChrome and I'm on the part where it says "Run autogen.sh with the prefix option so that the driver is being installed in the correct directory". Should I change it to "./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/exs" because "exs" is the actual name for my user account? Thanks.

2006-08-20T10:38:00.000Z	exs	lamego	 So, I'll just leave it how it is then, e.g "./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/"
2006-08-20T10:38:00.000Z	lamego	exs	yes
