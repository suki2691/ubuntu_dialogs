2005-07-08T09:49:00.000Z	tamiya	jinnstar7	why? who cares why. fix it
2005-07-08T09:50:00.000Z	jinnstar7	tamiya	agreed, however if that same person has a problem with xp they don't go running to a xp message board or chat threatening to run to mac os or linux or bsd
2005-07-08T09:50:00.000Z	tamiya	jinnstar7	they'd probably know someone in person that could help
