2009-05-03T04:13:00.000Z	sahyuhr		hey everyone..... i was wondering if i should change the version firefox i have from the built in one to the official one from the firefox site... i've been experiencing a lot of system freezing from using it
2009-05-03T04:14:00.000Z	sahyuhr		any ideas on that? or should i just go with using konquerer
2009-05-03T04:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	sahyuhr	Konqueror, Seamonkey,  Galeon, and Epiphany all good
2009-05-03T04:15:00.000Z	sahyuhr	sebsebseb	ok thanks.. i'll stick with konqueror for now and see if i notice the difference
