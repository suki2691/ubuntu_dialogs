2008-08-23T07:30:00.000Z	carandraug	Gnea	thanks. I'll search for that
2008-08-23T08:45:00.000Z	carandraug	Gnea	one hour ago or so, you suggested foremost for data recovery. While it was running it gave me "Segmentation fault (core dumped)". I think I kind of understood it correctly from what I've read about that. COuld you give me a hand in avoiding it? I ran "sudo foremost -i /dev/sdb1 -o /media/disk/foremost/"
