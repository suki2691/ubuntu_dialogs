2006-08-03T08:48:00.000Z	`JB		I have successfully used 'fwcutter' to connect my wireless adapter. What does 'fwcutter' do?
2006-08-03T08:49:00.000Z	longwave	`JB	fwcutter takes the windows firmware and cuts out the parts that are needed to run the card
2006-08-03T08:49:00.000Z	longwave	`JB	these parts cannot be distributed with linux as technically they are not free
2006-08-03T08:50:00.000Z	`JB	longwave	thank you
