2009-05-30T06:49:00.000Z	RProgrammer_		Where can I find the boot.img.gz file for Kubuntu 9.04?
2009-05-30T06:51:00.000Z	RProgrammer_		But boot.img.gz has the partitioning and bootloader already set up
2009-05-30T06:52:00.000Z	RProgrammer_		I'm told you can just dd it onto, say, /dev/sdb and you're good to go
