2007-04-16T05:00:00.000Z	NessieLiberation	gcc_	i assume you will only need to upgrade the packages which change between beta and final
2007-04-16T05:01:00.000Z	NessieLiberation	gcc_	but at this point, i wonder if its hardly worth it with the beta unless you want to help without anything
2007-04-16T05:02:00.000Z	gcc_	NessieLiberation	u mean there might be broken packs or what?
