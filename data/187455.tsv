2011-11-15T21:25:00.000Z	x999		I need to restore the linux kernal for oneric ocelot. I used Synaptic to remove empathy and evolution. BOOM. memtest is only computer function. I wanted to look at the log and make sure, but I can't find anyone that knows how to find it.  So I just would like to get that linux kernel going in my home directory.

2011-11-15T21:26:00.000Z	ikonia	x999	removing evolution. removed the kenrel ?
2011-11-15T21:29:00.000Z	x999	ikonia	yes - synaptic showed linux ##.#.# (I don't remember the numbers) and I thought "must be an old version" and Synaptic decided to do some helpful cleaning up since it was removing stuff.
