2008-03-04T10:59:00.000Z	PriceChild	prince_jammys	yes, he will need to use the windows install cd to restore the mbr
2008-03-04T11:01:00.000Z	prince_jammys	PriceChild	he's not going to be too happy, since he doesn't have a windows cd :/
2008-03-04T11:01:00.000Z	PriceChild	prince_jammys	there are other ways, ##windows for that
