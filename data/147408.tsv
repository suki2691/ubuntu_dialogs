2007-02-10T08:33:00.000Z	LjL	_Jaak_	i don't know, but possibly vmware player, since that's already happened in the past. haven't checked it out, though
2007-02-10T08:34:00.000Z	LjL	_Jaak_	at any rate, you can always boot the old kernel from GRUB, in any event
2007-02-10T08:35:00.000Z	_Jaak_	LjL	glad i am not using vmware, but stuff like Lirc has to recompilled, but that's no hell, wifi? Yes, using old kernel.... grom, if it's new i want it! lol =D
