2009-03-20T20:17:00.000Z	tesseracter		hello, i dont want to get updates to my kernel all the time. what other things are related to the "intrepid-proposed"?
2009-03-20T20:18:00.000Z	Pici	tesseracter	Any software that has not undergone enough testing to allow its entry into the 'main' repositories.
2009-03-20T20:20:00.000Z	tesseracter	Pici	so thats lots of stuff. any ideas how to just ignore kernel updates? they happen too fast for my liking, and i end up rebuilding a bunch of stuff every time.
2009-03-20T20:21:00.000Z	Pici	tesseracter	Not really. If the package passes the testing period in -proposed, it will be moved to -updates
