2010-05-03T04:13:00.000Z	michael_	Loshki	It's not THAT old - and I kind of wanted a few of the computers I have on the same OS - to keep things consistent.
2010-05-03T04:16:00.000Z	Loshki	michael_	Understood. 10.04 is a little raw still, is all...
2010-05-03T04:17:00.000Z	michael_	Loshki	Yeah I guess - I think the biggest issue is that I can't get the wireless card driver on there because of all the barriers to install the windows drivers - which are hard to bypass without internet ;)
