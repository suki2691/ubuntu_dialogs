2007-10-24T04:10:00.000Z	SuicideSalmon		I want to create a guest account for ssh that has no password, and has access only to /home/guest/* - how do I do this? Firstly it won't let me miss out a password, and secondly I'm not sure how to restrict access

2007-10-24T04:12:00.000Z	SuicideSalmon	gerro	so in /etc/passwd I change it from guest:x:1001etc to guest::1001etc?
