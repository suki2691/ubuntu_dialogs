2010-05-19T22:34:00.000Z	jrib	noecc	why are you using such a silly command?  By the way sh is not bash by default
2010-05-19T22:36:00.000Z	jrib	noecc	just do « su - otheruser »
2010-05-19T22:42:00.000Z	noecc	jrib	other user  is for application and has no pw.  In /etc/passwd for other user is /bin/bash
