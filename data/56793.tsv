2010-12-22T20:17:00.000Z	nibbler__	amadigan	that is impossible, as there is a huge difference between usb host and client. PCs can usually only be host, and host and host wont connect
2010-12-22T20:17:00.000Z	nibbler__	amadigan	well, you can buy usb-network adapters and then network
2010-12-22T20:19:00.000Z	nibbler__	amadigan	buy one usb-wifi and connect via this (netbook should ahve it integreated)
