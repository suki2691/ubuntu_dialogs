2012-01-07T10:30:00.000Z	AlexRamallo		I have 2 cards in my computer: 1 ati and 1 nvidia. 4 monitors connected (dvi+vga on ati, and hdmi+vga on nvidia). However, only dual monitors are working. The other two monitors on the nvidia card just show a purple screen with the word "ubuntu" in the middle
2012-01-07T10:30:00.000Z	AlexRamallo		how can I get 4 monitors to work?
2012-01-07T10:31:00.000Z	AlexRamallo		does anyone know? :\
