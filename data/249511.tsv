2005-02-11T16:01:00.000Z	Bigglez		I have another - has anyone managed to compile the latest gtk-gnutella on Ubuntu?
2005-02-11T16:02:00.000Z	Bigglez		Golgotha - which apps have u tried?
2005-02-11T16:03:00.000Z	Golgotha	Bigglez	ran Mozilla fine and then no other apps wanted to work... looks like they start up, and then doesn't
2005-02-11T16:03:00.000Z	Golgotha	Bigglez	also ran gaim, and then the next app (open office) did not want to start
