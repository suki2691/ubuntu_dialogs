2008-10-10T07:41:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	zcat[1]	dont you still need to setup samba users for samba to work?
2008-10-10T07:41:00.000Z	zcat[1]	danbh_intrepid	yeah, the first time you share a folder it goes and installs samba for you.
2008-10-10T07:43:00.000Z	zcat[1]	danbh_intrepid	I used to know how to set up samba via the /etc/samba/smb.conf file but ubuntu just makes it so easy. I'm lazy. I do things the easy way.
