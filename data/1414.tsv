But if I run grub-mkconfig, the new configfile does not have those entries.  Any idea how to properly get an updated configfile with those entries?
2012-08-26T19:22:00.000Z	lidar	DHR	could manually copy/paste them in ?

(1) it would get washed away every time an ubuntu update required updating grub.cfg (eg. a kernel update), (2) it would require me struggling every time Fedora updated its own grub configuration (eg. each time a new kernel is installed).
