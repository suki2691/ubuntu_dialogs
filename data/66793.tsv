2009-02-07T04:04:00.000Z	_lbet		How can I set a locale which is different from the system language? I want my language to be English, but use european number and date formats (dd.mm.yyyy , etc)
2009-02-07T04:06:00.000Z	guntbert	_lbet	I did it step by step, choose english for language, german keyboard, later then other formats
2009-02-07T04:10:00.000Z	_lbet	guntbert	thanx. I did set my keyboard to DE during installation, and timezone was set to Berlin, so that is working. However, I chosed English as language and now I have dates in US-format (mm/dd/yy). Doing a "locale" in a terminal tells me that everything is set to en_US...   Is there a gui-way to change it, or do I have to set all the variables (where???)  NOTE: I want to keep language EN. I only want to change the rest
2009-02-07T04:12:00.000Z	guntbert	_lbet	sorry, that is about my state too, but I'm contented with that
