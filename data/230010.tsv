2005-07-02T16:01:00.000Z	Eni_		I have Nokia 447Iplus monitor, google says it has 30.0-72.0 horizontal sync and 50.0-150.0 vertical refresh. I have added those manually and x wont start. I have tried different values. What can i do?
2005-07-02T16:02:00.000Z	wolverian	Eni_	did X start without adding those?
2005-07-02T16:02:00.000Z	Eni_	wolverian	No.
2005-07-02T16:03:00.000Z	wolverian	Eni_	did the lines exist, with other values, before? try commenting them out entirely if so.
