2008-08-02T07:12:00.000Z	flats		Thank god. Ubuntu came back.  Here's my situation... I have a ext3 partition at /dev/sda1 that is just a play partition, nothing important on it.  It currently mounts on / which is not good.  How can I get it to mount on a different mount point?  Everytime I try to umount it, It says drive busy please try manually.  If I use umount -l it makes my whole drive disappear in gparted.  Any ideas
