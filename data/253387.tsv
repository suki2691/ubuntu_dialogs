2006-08-21T14:29:00.000Z	Sethalos		I have a question I was hoping I could get an answer to. I'm trying to install java for an app i'm using (first time ever using Linux) and it doesn't seem to install for me..goes through the motions, but I keep getting an error that Java is not installed, I'm wondering if maybe i'm doing something wrong installing it.
2006-08-21T14:31:00.000Z	Sethalos		Ok, let me see if i can manage to figure that out..thanks
