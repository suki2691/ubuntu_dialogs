2007-05-25T09:14:00.000Z	Mr-Z		I'm trying to run a bash script to convert some .M4A files to .MP3, but I'm getting an error:  "/bin/bash: bad interpreter: Permission denied".  Anybody know why that is?  I'm running Dapper, trying to execute the script from a Fat32 partition ...

2007-05-25T09:15:00.000Z	Mr-Z	Sh3r1ff	 I was under the impression that I just type up the script and use ./scriptname to run it ...
