2007-10-19T19:01:00.000Z	jotil	Reuben	just comment out the map commands.
2007-10-19T19:01:00.000Z	Reuben	jotil	so the maps aren't needed?
2007-10-19T19:02:00.000Z	jotil	Reuben	not really. you can see that it just maps on device to another and back. i didn't feel the need for it. experts may feel differently though. i wouldn't know. i have commented out my map lines and it works fine for me.
