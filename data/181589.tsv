2009-01-14T21:32:00.000Z	FoolsRun		I have a stupid question: is it safe to change the root password? Would doing so stop processes from starting the way it would in Windows?
2009-01-14T21:34:00.000Z	Seveas	FoolsRun	chaqnging the root password changes one thing: the root password :)
2009-01-14T21:34:00.000Z	FoolsRun	Seveas	so, for example, if I have a server that's logged in as root, but I don't know the password, I can just change it?
