2005-08-01T12:01:00.000Z	Darkest		Can someone help me? Os - Ubuntu 5.0.4. I need a package libatk. Synaptic says that ver. libatk1.0-0_1.9.1-0ubuntu1_i386.deb is the lastest. But on http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/a/atk1.0/ there is a newer version  libatk1.0-0_1.10.1-2_i386.deb. Why Synaptic don't want to see this version, and don't want to download it?
