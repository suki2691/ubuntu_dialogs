2009-01-26T01:13:00.000Z	eater9		Hi, I'm trying to turn Caps Lock into a modifier key, so I can use Caps-HJKL as arrow keys in X -- is that possible?
2009-01-26T01:13:00.000Z	kennydude	eater9	very hard but it may be possible
2009-01-26T01:15:00.000Z	eater9	kennydude	I've tried playing around with xmodmap but I can't seem to get what I want -- is that perhaps not the right approach, you think?
