2010-07-01T16:56:00.000Z	cool_boy		I just wanted to download ubuntu for my desktop - but it says the 64 bit version would not be recommended for daily usage - why is that? Will I face any Problems with the 64bit version?
2010-07-01T16:57:00.000Z	shadyabhi	cool_boy	I have always used 64-bit.. There are no issues as such
