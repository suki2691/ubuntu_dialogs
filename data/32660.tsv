2010-05-03T13:55:00.000Z	Pyrokinetics		Hello guys, can someone help me with TightVNC? It won't let me control my ubuntu (i can connect, i could type inn my login passwd, but my cursor aint working)
2010-05-03T13:55:00.000Z	coz_	Pyrokinetics	 I had that issue during the development phase... I havent tried it after release however
2010-05-03T13:56:00.000Z	Pyrokinetics	coz_	so it is a bug? nothing to do : /
2010-05-03T13:57:00.000Z	coz_	Pyrokinetics	 I couldnt say for sure... however in the repositories  I believe it was just vnc pacakges that worked  but only from lucid to karmic not the other way around for some reason  but as i said I have not tested this since release
