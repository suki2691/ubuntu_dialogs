2010-07-17T21:42:00.000Z	gafir	stanley_robertso	I'm still looking :-) But I found this in the forum: you can add your script as an Cmnd_Alias to the sudoers file and then  add 'NOPASSWD: <alias name>'  for that username. -- I believe it would do it
2010-07-17T21:44:00.000Z	stanley_robertso	gafir	guess you can keep anywhere  .. as long as .. you can track it ..
