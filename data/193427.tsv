2006-03-29T10:21:00.000Z	neo911	MistaED	they say ubuntu is debian based right? so red hat is at the same level as debian?
2006-03-29T10:21:00.000Z	neo911		how do i subscribe to a newsgroup server like comp.lang.c++ from ubuntu? thanks
2006-03-29T10:22:00.000Z	MistaED	neo911	what do you mean by level? they both have the same gnu packages and linux kernel, just one uses rpm and the other uses deb packages, plus the filesystems are structured slightly differently, and probably the inits are different
