2005-07-07T08:14:00.000Z	mlambie	cmatheson	I installed my JDK (JRE with compilers) from http://ubuntuguide.org instructions, using ubuntu-backports.mirrormax.net
2005-07-07T08:15:00.000Z	cmatheson	mlambie	hmm, i still haven't installed java... alternatively you could just set esd to give up the dsp device when nothing is using it (like, start esd w/ 'esd -as 5' or something like that)
2005-07-07T08:16:00.000Z	mlambie	cmatheson	I think I came in half way through the convo: I just thought you wanted Java, I didn't read the backlog ;)
2005-07-07T08:18:00.000Z	cmatheson	mlambie	oh ok cool
