2008-06-25T11:15:00.000Z	fredmv		I have a somewhat weird problem.     Basically, on one of my laptops, I'm running gutsy/7.10.    I went to upgrade to Hardy Heron, and it said I had 3rd party pkgs disabled. That's fine;  I went into synaptic and checked the relevent repos.    Did an apt-get update/apt-get upgrade.      Then I restarted.    I'm now in 'low-graphics' mode and the network appears not to work.      Any idea what caused this (and what the remedy is)?

2008-06-25T11:20:00.000Z	fredmv	macrobad	thanks for the info.   I'm gonna look into it more tomorrow (2AM here).    Night all.
