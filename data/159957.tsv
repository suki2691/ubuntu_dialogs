2009-01-25T10:32:00.000Z	Shakedown		How do I get the newest version of Eclipse (Ganymede) through apt-get? I have the previous version Europa, and apt-get is telling there are no updates for it.
2009-01-25T10:33:00.000Z	Shakedown		Any ideas? I should be able to get it without downloading some .tar file and extracting myself huh?
2009-01-25T10:34:00.000Z	Shakedown		I don't know what that is.  Is that going to help me get it all setup through apt-get?
