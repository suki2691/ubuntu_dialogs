2005-06-23T09:52:00.000Z	swarm		I'm having a problem at boot ("Cannot access Hardware Clock with any know method") over Ubuntu Hoary (Kernel 2.6.11-1-amd64-k8-smp). I have seen there is a bug report on Ubuntu's bugzilla (https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1659 [Created 2004-10-17 20:21 UTC] ) but it's still with status NEW.
2005-06-23T09:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	swarm	2.6.11 is bad news...
2005-06-23T09:52:00.000Z	swarm		swarm
2005-06-23T09:53:00.000Z	swarm	thoreauputic	it's the same with 2.6.10-5
