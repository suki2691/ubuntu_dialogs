2007-01-17T11:02:00.000Z	doy		quick question: is there an easy way to convert an ubuntu desktop installation into an ubuntu server installation?
2007-01-17T11:03:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	doy	get the server kernels and then the xampp packages but other than that, they should be identical
2007-01-17T11:03:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	doy	and of course uninstall ubuntu-desktop...apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop
2007-01-17T11:03:00.000Z	doy	Gevaudan82	thanks
