2012-08-27T03:03:00.000Z	LostMonk		question, if I have a 64 bit machine, is there any good reason to not use 64 bit ubuntu?
2012-08-27T03:03:00.000Z	Jack_Smirnoff	LostMonk	yes, use 32 bit
2012-08-27T03:04:00.000Z	Jack_Smirnoff	LostMonk	setup a partition of 32 and another for 64 if you want
2012-08-27T03:09:00.000Z	Jack_Smirnoff	LostMonk	I have 10 years with ubuntu and a few of those here as on op..  32 is a better choice and you will not notice any real performance issues.  To all those that read the logs and remember me..  take care
