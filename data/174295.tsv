2006-10-03T05:05:00.000Z	Warbo	maxLF	It will work with 3D by default, but I think ATI have dropped support for the latest 3D effects on that card with their non-Free non-default driver
2006-10-03T05:05:00.000Z	maxLF	Warbo	So it won't be that great for gaming?
2006-10-03T05:06:00.000Z	Warbo	maxLF	Probably not. It should be OK for modest 3D work (as in, ONLY 3D models). If there is transparency/alpha then that will slow it down
