2009-09-16T02:31:00.000Z	trism	_MrsApple_	you mean you're trying to add color to a black and white image?
2009-09-16T02:33:00.000Z	trism	_MrsApple_	not exactly sure the standard way to do this in the gimp but you could make two layers, one with the black and white image and the other with the color image and then edit the mask on one of the layers so you can see the layer below
