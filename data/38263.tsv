2010-04-30T13:33:00.000Z	Imran-UK	DragonBook	either should be fine but apt-get is somewhat easier
2010-04-30T13:34:00.000Z	DragonBook	Imran-UK	how can i check to see what the latest version on apt-get is ?
2010-04-30T13:34:00.000Z	Imran-UK	DragonBook	aptitude show flash-nonfree or whatever the package name is
