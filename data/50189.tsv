2009-09-01T19:33:00.000Z	Psi-Jack_	IdleOne	No, It's justified. It's not name-calling, it's saying what they're presribing is not sane. Which is true.
2009-09-01T19:34:00.000Z	Psi-Jack_	IdleOne	Is it more a jack ass to say use wine for very basic network monitoring, or is it jack ass to tell someone to stop suggesting such obsurdities? I think the first one. We can disagree all we want, but that's how it is.
