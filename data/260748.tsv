2006-08-14T10:36:00.000Z	aaron_		A server was donated to our location, HP Netserver 5/100 LH with 64 MB RAM and 100 Mhz processor. I was hoping to run xubuntu off of it, or ubuntu server LTS. I cannot boot off of CD, the existing SCSI CDROM is fritzy and ide is not working, I cannot get into BIOS. Booting off of a floppy doesn't work because the scsi drive doesn't fit on it. the network boot process would not work either,...
