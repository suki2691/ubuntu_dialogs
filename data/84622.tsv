2008-08-01T07:09:00.000Z	alms		i finally have all my pieces for my file server and am ready to boot up -- i have a one gig flash card on an ide adapter -- two sata drives -- want to run a file server + ssh + virtual login + encrypted file system -- should i use ubuntu or freenas or openfiler or freebsd?

2008-08-01T07:11:00.000Z	alms	adam7	whab about on a 1GB flash drive
2008-08-01T07:11:00.000Z	adam7	alms	shouldnt' be a problem, I don't think. I don't know what the minimum install size for ubuntu-server is
