2010-04-30T05:46:00.000Z	ha1331__	d4rkmt7r	I think it's as good as 9.10. Yet to spot any clear improvements
2010-04-30T05:48:00.000Z	ha1331__	d4rkmt7r	hmm, nvidia driver seems to be updated, not sure what good that does, it works as fluently as the previous one.
2010-04-30T05:50:00.000Z	ha1331__	d4rkmt7r	upgrade did unistall smplayer, if that makes any difference to you. Its still found and installable at software center. Not sure but atleast for 9.10 it was pretty old.
