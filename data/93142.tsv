2009-01-05T00:27:00.000Z	Phase		Anyone got an ideas on this? ---> For some reason Firefox loads with the top bar (the one with the title, min/max/close buttons) on it either out of view, or not there, as well as it overlaps both my top panel and bottom panel in ubuntu (gnome).. And it's not that one Compiz option that removes it (unless it can be removed from JUST firefox), because everything else is functioning normally though..

2009-01-05T00:29:00.000Z	Mimi	Phase	 you might have to do that shortcut + F11   a few several times   (I know its not full screen because i never put mine in fullscreen, but this thing is the only thing that fixed it for me)
