2011-07-29T00:45:00.000Z	Pici	BBgamer	It is still in the repos, but I believe  that the Software center is now handling .deb installs. Theres only limited space on the Live CD, so duplicated programs get removed.
2011-07-29T00:46:00.000Z	BBgamer	Pici	I've installed it manually. Thanks for the answer though, I guessed that. The Software centre is horrible for .deb installs however.
2011-07-29T00:46:00.000Z	Pici	BBgamer	Its not for me either, but thats the way things are.
