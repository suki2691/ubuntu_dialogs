2009-03-22T04:31:00.000Z	hmw		how can I search a man page for a string containing white space? (one single space in this instance)
2009-03-22T04:33:00.000Z	crdlb	hmw	searching for a string with spaces works fine here
2009-03-22T04:34:00.000Z	hmw	crdlb	then it might be the string /create which is interpreted as a command in man?
2009-03-22T04:34:00.000Z	crdlb	hmw	no, that works too (though there are no matches in the manpage I'm looking at)
