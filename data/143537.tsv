2007-03-08T15:33:00.000Z	TheVault		Got a question. My screen is able to go past the 1024x786 limit, but when I am adjusting the resolution in the System>Preference>Screen Resolution, when I click the drop down menu, there is nothing in there to select besides the 1024x786, is there anyway to make my resolution into something past that?

2007-03-08T15:35:00.000Z	TheVault		Alright, I am about to open the xorg.conf file, I will need to know what to do. I think on my Windows Xp, the resolution is 1024x1200
