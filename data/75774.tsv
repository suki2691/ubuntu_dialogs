2008-11-02T04:32:00.000Z	grav		I'm having a problem installing to a local HD from LiveCD.  When I get to the partitioner, and try to go through 'guided, largest free space', it displays that it is going to take up 100% of the disk.  When I hit next, it doesn't 'guide' me.  And I don't want to overwrite the other partitions on that drive

2008-11-02T04:36:00.000Z	grav	arrrghhh_	I've got 30GB, what would the recommended partition sizes and mount points be?
2008-11-02T04:36:00.000Z	arrrghhh_	grav	i've done ubuntu on paritions as small as 10gb.  but that doesn't leave a lot of wiggle room for downloading much.
