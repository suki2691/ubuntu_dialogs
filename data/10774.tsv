2011-08-07T16:36:00.000Z	phatjoe		hey guys, anyone can tell me how can I mount an ISO file (extracted from an Audio CD) ? it doesn't work with mount -o loop
2011-08-07T16:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	phatjoe	 by 'extracted' you mean a 'image file' made from a cd?
2011-08-07T16:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	phatjoe	 you could try a 'vlc whateverthethingis.iso' and see if it plays it..
2011-08-07T16:42:00.000Z	phatjoe	dr_willis	I did try it with VLC also.. couldn't play a thing.. anyways.. thx for the help guys ;)
