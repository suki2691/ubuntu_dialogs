2007-05-16T14:09:00.000Z	Zwei		Can anyone help me regarding XSane Image Scanner?  I have an HP LaserJet 1220 that has a scanner, but when I try to run XSane, it would say that there is no image device available.

2007-05-16T14:12:00.000Z	Zwei		Heh.  Yeah.
2007-05-16T14:12:00.000Z	hoth676	Zwei	not sure about it, but I'd say you need the appropriate kernel module lo load, and also set up the appropriate device - in /dev directory (using /dev/MAKEDEV utility perhaps). Hope this gives you some hints...
