2011-09-18T01:17:00.000Z	Doonz		Hi, In a bash script if i have a text file that is only 1 line how would i parse that one line out into a variable
2011-09-18T01:19:00.000Z	alkafoo	Doonz	source path/to/file
2011-09-18T01:19:00.000Z	alkafoo	Doonz	or, at least that works if you have FOO=bar in the file
2011-09-18T01:19:00.000Z	alkafoo	Doonz	ask #bash for more
