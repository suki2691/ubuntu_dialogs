2012-10-17T21:11:00.000Z	theadmin	maveze	Ubuntu versioning mostly does not allow the "new" software in various releases, versions are "frozen" apart from select applications and important security fixes

2012-10-17T21:22:00.000Z	theadmin	maveze	Well. If you totally *need* an updated version, try looking for a PPA. That's all I can say.
