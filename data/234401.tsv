2007-07-15T13:06:00.000Z	marl		does anyone know if there is a way to map data on one server on another, but using usernames rather than user id? eg. server 1 user marl has an id of 505 and on server 2 user marl has an id of 565, im trying to find a way of allowing data acceess but that will work by user name rather than UID, like NFS (but so far i have hit problems with UIDs on NFS)
