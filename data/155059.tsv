2008-05-06T08:39:00.000Z	maikol		if i have a 2 500gb disk semi-software raid 0 array, is it possible to add two 1tb disks to the array, or do the disks have to be the same size
2008-05-06T08:40:00.000Z	Kyle__	maikol	you'll only get 500gigs out of each drive i think
2008-05-06T08:40:00.000Z	Kyle__		if you're set on running lots of drives with raid 0 maybe try lvm? ;)
