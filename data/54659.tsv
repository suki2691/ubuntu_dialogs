2009-06-11T02:05:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	InvaderPar	you could save your session?
2009-06-11T02:06:00.000Z	InvaderPar	Rabbitbunny	I have a dual boot laptop, I'm trying Ubuntu alongside Vista (*gasp*), and I don't think I can save sessions for later boots.
2009-06-11T02:12:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	InvaderPar	Sure you can, the dual-booting doesn't matter.  Of course, I don't see how to save sessions anymore....
