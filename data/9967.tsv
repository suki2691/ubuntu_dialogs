2012-04-26T18:49:00.000Z	Aga		Hi All! Congrats with the 12.04 release! I installed 12.04 Beta 2 a week ago. Will I need to upgrade this to the final 12.04 or is it the same?
2012-04-26T18:49:00.000Z	Stanley00	Aga	I think you should upgrade
2012-04-26T18:52:00.000Z	Aga	Stanley00	Should I upgrade by waiting for the automatical upgrade via the update manager, or should I reinstall?
2012-04-26T18:53:00.000Z	Stanley00	Aga	I think just upgrade is good enough,
