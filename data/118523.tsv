2008-05-14T07:48:00.000Z	Baatti		someone please help me, I'm really upset...  I just downloaded and burned the Ubuntu 8.04 .ISO...I'm trying to install it inside windows...it goes through the checksums and then starts creating an image, it gets to about 711MB out of 733MB or something, then it stops and says "Cannot access CD, it may be being used by another program."  Which as far as I know, it ain't!  Any ideas?
2008-05-14T07:49:00.000Z	Baatti		also, I can't get it to load as a live CD...it get's to about 3% of the kernel, then it says, Cannot access Boot disc
2008-05-14T07:50:00.000Z	Baatti		ok, I'll try that
