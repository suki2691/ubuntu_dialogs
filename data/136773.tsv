2007-05-04T09:04:00.000Z	Slick_		hey guys, I've just bought and installed a 500GB drive for all of my documents, downloads, music etc.  it's running as a master on an IDE channel, whereas my primary drive which I want to install ubuntu on is the primary on a sata channel.  I want to format the new 50GB drive as a ext3, and I'm using Gparted atm, however it's asking if I want it as a primary or extended partition, which one should I choose?

2007-05-04T09:07:00.000Z	Slick_	sn0	its checked as default, what is it?
2007-05-04T09:08:00.000Z	sn0	Slick_	leave it enabled then, it mearly does what it says :)
