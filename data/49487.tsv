2009-08-31T17:18:00.000Z	Aegil		Hi, I'm trying to cut down a command I run "find /var/qmail/queue/ -type f -exec grep -l [someone@somewhere.com] {} \;"  the [someone@somewhere.com is variable everytime, does anyone know a way I could automate it so I could just name a script eg script user@domain.com so it would input that value inplace of [someone@somewhere.com] and run it?
2009-08-31T17:19:00.000Z	Aegil		I've automated most stuff so far using alias's but Im not sure the best way for automating something I need to pass a value to in the middle of it.
