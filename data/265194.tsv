2005-08-01T09:21:00.000Z	dmk2004		installed new kernel, 2.6.12...and on boot, it says kernel panic...it didnt make an initrd.img, which i assume is the problem..any help?

2005-08-01T09:22:00.000Z	jbailey	dmk2004	The best answer is really to not do your own kernel, and try to get the generic Ubuntu kernel working.
