2008-02-03T20:43:00.000Z	kodge		I need to install windows on this PC for reasons I don't wish to discuss. However whilst installing it says my HDD needs to be NTS ( or something similar to that ) for the installation to go through. Is there something I can do in ubuntu that would allow the process to happen?
