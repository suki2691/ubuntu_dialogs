2007-03-04T09:58:00.000Z	Anohaakten		you have to do everything in terminal?
2007-03-04T09:59:00.000Z	Artemis3	Anohaakten	its simple, you don't. If something is not supported, the manufacturer never released specs of it
2007-03-04T10:01:00.000Z	Artemis3	Anohaakten	cannot be helped if the manufacturer doesnt cooperate, by not released specs or a driver...
