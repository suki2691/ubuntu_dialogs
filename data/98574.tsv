2008-03-02T17:34:00.000Z	ezra1964		does anyone know what scheduler 7.04 uses? I dropped a script in cron.daily but it didnt run, and I see crontab is empty
2008-03-02T17:35:00.000Z	andi6	ezra1964	i doubt these script will appear in crontab
2008-03-02T17:37:00.000Z	andi6	ezra1964	so does /usr/sbin/cron run?
