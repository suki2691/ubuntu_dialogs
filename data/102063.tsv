2010-11-27T08:31:00.000Z	Dennis_		I'm running Ubuntu 10.04 and I seem to have lost my flash. I've tried to reinstall flash using a series of commands to Delete, Force, Install. None of these have worked, and I can't get Flash to work in Firefox. Help.
2010-11-27T08:32:00.000Z	Skapare	Dennis_	have you tried a complete uninstall AND flush of firefox and re-install it back, then add flash?
2010-11-27T08:33:00.000Z	Dennis_		No, I'll try anything at this point.
