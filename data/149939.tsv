2009-10-17T01:00:00.000Z	mdmcginn		After updating /etc/apache2/sites-available, and then running sudo a2ensite mylocalsite.com, which command should I conclude with: sudo apache2ctl restart or sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload or sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart? Do I need to sudo a2dissite first, whenever changing my virtual host configuration?

2009-10-17T01:02:00.000Z	Pici	mdmcginn	Using sudo invoke-rc.d apache2 restart (which is the same as sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart)
2009-10-17T01:10:00.000Z	mdmcginn	Pici	 http://myoldsite.com is still working, but not http://mynewsite.com. All my updates to sites-available are taking effect, except the virtual host name isn't changing.  myoldsite no longer exists in sites-enabled or sites-available. I renamed the directory, and I'm reaching it through the old virtual host name.
