2011-01-20T20:21:00.000Z	piyushmishra	genii-around	postgresql: unrecognized service
2011-01-20T20:24:00.000Z	genii-around	piyushmishra	The name may be something like postgresql-8.4  instead of just postgresql ( can't check it on this box, not installed here) but the idea is the same
2011-01-20T20:24:00.000Z	piyushmishra	genii-around	I tried the 8.4 one and nothing returned
