2006-06-04T05:43:00.000Z	Jowi	yury	open a terminal :)
2006-06-04T05:46:00.000Z	Jowi	yury	when the instructions mentio "run ./something" that assumes you are in the directory that the command "something" is located at. first you must know wheere you installed it. then "cd" to that directory (like "cd /home/yury/game/") then type ./gameEditor
