2011-03-27T10:11:00.000Z	Schala		I noticed on the Ubuntu website it has 32-bit as recommended. I'm rather curious if that's also the case on 64-bit PCs too? My concern is if I were to install 32-bit, well... I have 6 GB of memory and with 32-bit software only using up to 4 GB... will I be leaving out 2 GB?
2011-03-27T10:12:00.000Z	Schala		Hmm.... alright. So there's no performance hit either I hope?
