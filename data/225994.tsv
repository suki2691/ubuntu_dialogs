2005-07-30T15:15:00.000Z	allerbest		Anyone an idea why my 5.04-Gnome comes in 640x480 only? I reconfigured xorg.conf and removed 640x480 but no changes. I've got a Matrox G550 and a TFT with 1280x1024
2005-07-30T15:16:00.000Z	anacron	allerbest	did you reboot x with ctrl+alt+backspace
2005-07-30T15:17:00.000Z	allerbest	anacron	Yes I did a full reboot.
