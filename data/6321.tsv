2012-02-14T05:17:00.000Z	kfizz		I've written a python script and can't get a custom keyboard shortcut to run it. Using gnome-classic. I've tried it through the system settings and through compiz. I've edited /apps/metacity/ in gconf-editor. I've tried wrapping the python script in a bash script. I've tried about everything I can think of and I can't get it to work. Any have any ideas?
2012-02-14T05:18:00.000Z	zykotic10	kfizz	does your script require a terminal?  "gnome-terminal -e /path/to/script"
2012-02-14T05:20:00.000Z	kfizz	zykotic10	that doesn't work, either. I can run the command directly through the Run Application dialog box.
2012-02-14T05:21:00.000Z	zykotic10	kfizz	sorry, i don't have any other suggestions.  Good luck.
