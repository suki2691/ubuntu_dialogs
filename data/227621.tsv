2005-08-28T16:20:00.000Z	nanotech		I am using ubuntu in french and everything is fine except that the OOo interface doesn't display me accents (I have a little squares instead). My locale are set to fr_FR@euro and i believe I installed every needed fonts. I also installed localized packages of OOo. Any help ?
