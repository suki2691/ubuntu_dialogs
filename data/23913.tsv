2010-10-18T06:53:00.000Z	Tenyuu		I can only control my backlight with the brightness deamon, how can I get my shrotcut keys to work? (FN+F6 for down and FN+F7 for up) or set fn+up & FN+down to control backlight?
2010-10-18T06:55:00.000Z	cryptodira	Tenyuu	are you talking backlight on the lcd or keyboard?
2010-10-18T06:56:00.000Z	cryptodira	Tenyuu	sorry  no help from me.... I was hoping you had the keyboard backlight working... i have a toshiba satellite... the lcd works... but not the keyboard backlight.
