When I first restart the machine, it auto connects to my wireless network and it shows the bars at the top .. then about 5-10 minutes later, the bars disappear altogether and my wireless usb adaptors light goes out.. I know I just asked this, is there a forum I should try or another way to try to get help for this? It's a bit hard to search for this as there are
