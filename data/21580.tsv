2012-02-15T20:13:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Aelingil	That is the way my Grub (Legacy), is by default; most recent versions at the top and previous below that.
2012-02-15T20:15:00.000Z	Aelingil	Sidewinder1	I have 11.10 and 11.04. However on grub it shows 11.10 then "Previous versions" then 11.04, then "previous versions".. i am trying to get 11.10 and 11.04 next to each other.
2012-02-15T20:21:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Aelingil	I'm pretty sure that in Grub Legacy, one could simply edit (after making a back-up copy, of course) the menu.lst file to accomplish what you want. I'm not sure that would work with Grub 2. I'm on 10.04, and sorry I can't be more effective in my efforts to help you.
2012-02-15T20:24:00.000Z	Aelingil	Sidewinder1	i'll look up that too, thank you!
