2012-09-24T18:42:00.000Z	pseudonymous		Ok, I have a *really* central package overwritten by a ppa which I've already removed as it holds up some upgrades. If I try to force the official precise pkg from synaptic it gives me a mile long list of packages it'll nuke. I don't want that, why the heck can't it see that there's no way these packages can't stay on the system ?

2012-09-24T18:45:00.000Z	pseudonymous	bazhang	I removed the ppa itself using a gui(I'm lazy like that) called YPPA. Seems like it's gone though the packages it's overwritten are still there
