2007-08-21T11:05:00.000Z	linuxnewbie_		I have source code for Acer Hotkeys for linux but don't know how to compile or install it. I have a directory with the following in: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/34543/ - could someone point me in the right direction of how to compile and install source code like this?
