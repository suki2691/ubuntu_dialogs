2010-12-26T11:59:00.000Z	cablop	mdpatrick	check also the linux headers for that pae kernel
2010-12-26T12:00:00.000Z	cablop	mdpatrick	maybe if the live cd is able to see them... you'll have no issues to do that
2010-12-26T12:01:00.000Z	mdpatrick	cablop	not sure what you mean by linux headers... the stuff that shows up on the screen during boot?
