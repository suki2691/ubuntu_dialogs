2008-08-18T00:17:00.000Z	Chrizz_		I have to install windows vista for school, but i dont want to format my whole harddrive for it.
2008-08-18T00:17:00.000Z	Chrizz_		How can i install vista in a dualboot with linux?
2008-08-18T00:19:00.000Z	_2	Chrizz_	just drop the recovery/install disk in and install it.   then reinstall linux "cause windows ate it..." as a dual boot install the normal way.
