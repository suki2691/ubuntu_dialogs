2010-08-21T21:02:00.000Z	cwwilson721		 I have a friend that is having an issue with grub in a dual-boot, Win7/Ubuntu 10.04-64. grub lost it's mind, boots into Win7, no menu for Ubuntu. He tried reinstalling, no joy. Ideas?

2010-08-21T21:06:00.000Z	maco	cwwilson721	is he in ubuntu right now?
2010-08-21T21:06:00.000Z	maco	cwwilson721	how'd he get to it this time?
