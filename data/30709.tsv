2010-06-04T19:49:00.000Z	gsgleason	RoBanJo	You're trying to create an image, or burn the image to disc?
2010-06-04T19:53:00.000Z	RoBanJo	gsgleason	had no problems burning image of 8.10
2010-06-04T19:54:00.000Z	gsgleason	RoBanJo	are you using ubuntu now?   If so, you can use the startup disk creator to make a bootable usb flast drive from the iso image
