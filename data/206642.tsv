2006-08-06T10:41:00.000Z	avis		i failed at compiling my own kernel.  but then who can blame me ??  make xconfig needs to be studied.  plus i dont know anything about the celeron d other than its 686 with EM64T though i'm running 32-bit.  crazy.

2006-08-06T10:43:00.000Z	sethk	avis	you don't really need to change anything.
