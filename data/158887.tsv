2007-01-11T09:44:00.000Z	PwnDaWorld		you're right, gentoo people told me it was a better distro
2007-01-11T09:44:00.000Z	PwnDaWorld		another guy in another channel told me debian was more stable than ubuntu, is it true ?
2007-01-11T09:45:00.000Z	PwnDaWorld		he told me ubuntu was based off the debian unstable version.. so it couldn't be as stable
2007-01-11T09:45:00.000Z	rioghal	PwnDaWorld	if Ubuntu works for your, does it really matter who's distro is more stable?
