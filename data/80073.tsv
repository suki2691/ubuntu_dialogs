2012-11-22T22:17:00.000Z	NCsaba		Hi all. I've a quick question: Can I create a bootable linux pen drive (xubuntu preferable) which can be a full functional, updateble, configurable system that is different then a live version. So changes need to be persistent, like kernel updates, eventually custom compiled kernels, etc... so any change I do on it should stay after a reboot.
2012-11-22T22:17:00.000Z	NCsaba		it there a tool for that?
2012-11-22T22:18:00.000Z	NCsaba		yes, I found this but http://rudd-o.com/new-projects/portablelinux gives 503
