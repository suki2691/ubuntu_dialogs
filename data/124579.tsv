2007-08-24T05:52:00.000Z	dho_ragus	jrib	huh, you're right.  i always do it like that in other linux distros... let me double-check ubuntu.
2007-08-24T05:53:00.000Z	dho_ragus	jrib	yup, you're right.  that does not work in ubuntu.
2007-08-24T05:56:00.000Z	jrib	dho_ragus	usermod uses that syntax you used
