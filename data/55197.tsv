2010-08-02T01:15:00.000Z	The_Saint		Could someone give me a quick hand, 1st time using chazilla and I'm trying to connect to a channel  ip is "irc.uoorigins.com" port is "6667"  channel is "#origins" can't seem to find anywhere to manually enter the ip and port.

2010-08-02T01:16:00.000Z	edbian	The_Saint	Once you're logged onto a server you can join a channel with /join #channel-name
2010-08-02T01:16:00.000Z	edbian	The_Saint	Is it working?
