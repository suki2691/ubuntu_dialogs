2009-03-09T17:53:00.000Z	acech		I have a widescreen laptop, which is docked with a non wide screen display and want to have something like an icon I can click on to toggle the resolutions?

2009-03-09T17:56:00.000Z	acech	ActionParsnip	- ah Ok that looks interesting. Can I put a script on the panel with an icon?
