2007-07-31T09:05:00.000Z	bulmer	tcstech	why not? just curious..which mobo brand you prefer and why?
2007-07-31T09:07:00.000Z	tcstech	bulmer	asus's quality has fallen... I have seen so many people with issues with asus boards right out of the box...
2007-07-31T09:08:00.000Z	bulmer	tcstech	oh okay, that confirms what i have heard, that they put cheap stuff on their mobo, they used to be quality not no more
