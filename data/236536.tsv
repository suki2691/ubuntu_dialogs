2005-10-17T16:51:00.000Z	stinkjones		i had a question about the ubuntu live cd. I was wondering whether i could browse my windows disk when i boot into ubuntu. It is NTFf
2005-10-17T16:52:00.000Z	stinkjones		also, is there any windows utility for writing an img file to a disk, like dd in linux? that would make my life a whole lot easier
