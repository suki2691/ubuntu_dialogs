2008-10-12T16:34:00.000Z	frybye		is there some technical reson why sometimes there are loads of users listen here and in #ubuntu+1 but for ages no dialoge at all on the +1 channel?? has this anything to do with irc-netsplits or similar...?
2008-10-12T16:35:00.000Z	frybye		or is it just that more dialogue runs there than there...?
2008-10-12T16:35:00.000Z	BlueEagle	frybye	slightly off-topic, but there are many who run a detatchable irc client that is joined to the channel but they themselves don't attend the irc chat all the time.
