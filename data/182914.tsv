2007-05-31T09:03:00.000Z	Ben_		Hi, I want to install ubuntu dual-booting with Windows XP. My laptop has a hidden partition on the hard drive that is used to restore it completely to factory settings. I don't want to touch this partition. Is it easy to avoid doing so when installing ubuntu? How?
2007-05-31T09:04:00.000Z	Ben_		also, although the partition is hidden in windows, ubuntu (CD booted) can see and mount it fine... so it won't get erased, brk3?
