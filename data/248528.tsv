2010-06-21T16:23:00.000Z	anirvana		I am getting error "Cannot open /dev/modem: No such file or directory" when trying command sudo wvdial
2010-06-21T16:24:00.000Z	anirvana		I can't get my mobile broadband working due to this
2010-06-21T16:25:00.000Z	minimec	anirvana	You want a 3G connection or a simple analog modem connection? 3G would be handled by the network-manager, not wvdial.
