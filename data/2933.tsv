2012-11-15T11:13:00.000Z	Aprel		Using udfstools/mkudffs, how can I add a "title" when creating a UDF image; "title" meaning the string that displays as the drive when the cd is inserted.
2012-11-15T11:15:00.000Z	Aprel		Or does anyone know what that disc label is called? It's the equivalent of mkisofs -V "this label"

2012-11-15T11:17:00.000Z	Aprel	Stanley00	yeah, I saw that, but wasn't sure which. Wanted to dblcheck before creating and burning.
