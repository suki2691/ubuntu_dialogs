2011-02-16T20:26:00.000Z	Idris		I am using Ubuntu 10.04. I want to upgrade it to 10.10
2011-02-16T20:26:00.000Z	Idris		Is it wise to upgrade from ubuntu 10.04 to 10.10?
2011-02-16T20:28:00.000Z	Pumpkin-	Idris	really a personal preference/objectives question. 10.04 is an LTS, so if you want long term stability, I'd stay with 10.04. If you want new features, I'd upgrade.
