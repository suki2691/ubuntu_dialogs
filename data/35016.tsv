2010-10-17T02:22:00.000Z	sinisterstuf		what is 10.04.1 ? I saw it on my login for the 1st time today...
2010-10-17T02:23:00.000Z	guntbert	sinisterstuf	LTS versions get a single .1 version after several weeks
2010-10-17T02:24:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	guntbert	does it get .1 every time there is a non-LTS release?
2010-10-17T02:25:00.000Z	guntbert	sinisterstuf	no to my knowledge that only happens once - to clean out some glitches that made it through to the original release
