2005-04-16T12:05:00.000Z	snybole		How can I manage my apt in fluxbox? If I want to use the same as used in gnome?
2005-04-16T12:05:00.000Z	snybole		is there a command I could type in through a terminal?
2005-04-16T12:07:00.000Z	martinhj	snybole	"aptitude" (for terminal) works well
2005-04-16T12:09:00.000Z	martinhj	snybole	(because, when I use fluxbox, I like to use terminal programs:-)
