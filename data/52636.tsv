2009-07-13T05:49:00.000Z	xorso		I have a question about the live cd. I have a bad hard drive and it tries to read the sectors and takes forever to boot. can I skip this or boot straight to a command prompt?
2009-07-13T05:50:00.000Z	th0r	xorso	you should be able to tell the computer to look first at the cd drive....in the Setup at first boot...usually F2 or some such
2009-07-13T05:57:00.000Z	th0r	xorso	if you changed the boot order the computer would read the cd first and not hang on the hd, but the net nazi doesn't like that idea
2009-07-13T05:58:00.000Z	xorso	th0r	 I can successfully start booting the live cd. it is the live cd that checks the HD.
