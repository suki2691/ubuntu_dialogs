2012-05-28T16:50:00.000Z	zombifier		Or making it gone forever?
2012-05-28T16:51:00.000Z	MagicJ	zombifier	hide would be ok - or just not show - either one
2012-05-28T16:52:00.000Z	MagicJ	zombifier	no - I have it set to not be there until... - I have also set the sensitivity to the worst, but it still comes up of course, just less often
