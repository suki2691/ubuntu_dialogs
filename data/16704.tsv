2011-03-27T20:51:00.000Z	dannyd_	coz_	I have an .avi file and want to convert it to either (3gp, .3g2, .mp4, .wmv) so I can watch it on my phone, how can i do that?
2011-03-27T20:52:00.000Z	coz_	dannyd_	 well,, not sure they are supported with ffmpeg however to test it  open a terminal..cd to the location of the file you want ti convert and the command would be     ffmpeg -i nameof.avi  nameof.mp4
2011-03-27T20:52:00.000Z	coz_	dannyd_	 and that would apply to any format you want to convert to
