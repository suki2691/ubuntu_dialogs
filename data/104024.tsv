2009-11-03T19:41:00.000Z	marc_		I'm trying to get the propertary drivers to scan the hardware
2009-11-03T19:43:00.000Z	marc_		Is there anyway to force ubuntu to scan for drivers off the install disk? When booting from CD it finds the drivers for graphics card and wireless card now that installed on hard drive it doesn't off to use the drivers
