2007-05-23T14:59:00.000Z	kaiyilen		Hello! I'm trying to install my nvidia drivers but it says i need to get the libc header files. don't the libc files automatically come with the install?
2007-05-23T15:00:00.000Z	kaiyilen		for the drivers?
2007-05-23T15:00:00.000Z	Frogzoo	kaiyilen	libc does, the headers don't - install build-essential
2007-05-23T15:05:00.000Z	kaiyilen	Frogzoo	I just use apt-get install build-essential ?
