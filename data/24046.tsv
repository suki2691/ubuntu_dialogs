It works, but a crappy way to do it.  I hope Ubuntu doesn't continue down this path of forcing things on its users like MS does.
2011-10-23T19:52:00.000Z	yagoo	Scrambler	that's stupid. DON'T OVERWRITE BINARIES TO FIX THINGS.
2011-10-23T19:54:00.000Z	yagoo	Scrambler	u using unity or gnome-classic?
2011-10-23T19:54:00.000Z	yagoo	Scrambler	so install gnome-session-fallback (or gnome-fallback-session) and gnome-shell
