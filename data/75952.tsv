2009-03-17T03:03:00.000Z	yow|x2	calwig	- apt-get autoremove
2009-03-17T03:03:00.000Z	calwig	yow|x2	im only using one version, the rest of them arent needed
2009-03-17T03:04:00.000Z	yow|x2	calwig	- apt-get autoremove will get rid of previous sources and kernel packages etc. to actually get rid of the files in /boot/, the only way i know of is to manually delete them.
