2009-11-27T06:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Cas149	 vlc and mplayer  (such as gnome-mplayer) can handle it. You Do need to install the decss stuff from medibuntu most likely
2009-11-27T06:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Cas149	 it has a 'repository' you want to add to your list of repositories for synaptics to use.  see  medibuntu docs
