2007-06-04T08:51:00.000Z	Eric_Jardas		I have the following problem: When I open .js file in gedit I get the C syntax coloring. How can I make javascript syntax coloring default for .js files once and for all

2007-06-04T08:53:00.000Z	Eric_Jardas	Milo|SharcNET	you are so wrong :) gedit with some plugins and custom coloring etc. is more powerfull then most of the editors ;)
