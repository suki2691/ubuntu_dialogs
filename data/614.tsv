2012-10-31T08:49:00.000Z	CreepDeck		Hi, I downloaded an rss feed for viewing in the terminal, however, there is a lot of html stuff in it, is there a way to remove that, and then show the news one line after the other?
2012-10-31T08:51:00.000Z	almoxarife	CreepDeck	you want to cli rss feed stripped of html, don't like a nice gui rss reader?
2012-10-31T08:51:00.000Z	CreepDeck	almoxarife	nah, I am a terminal guy.
2012-10-31T08:52:00.000Z	almoxarife	CreepDeck	well then terminal guy, there you have it, you need a html-strip from my rss feed dump script
