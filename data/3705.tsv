2012-04-26T21:22:00.000Z	Church-	fsgxdroid	i'd choose depending on ram amount. and between 32bit or 64bit, leaving PAE out.
2012-04-26T21:22:00.000Z	fsgxdroid	Church-	ok, i have 8gigs of ram, so 64 bit is the way to go? not even considering 32bit + PAE?
2012-04-26T21:23:00.000Z	Church-	fsgxdroid	indeed. just go for normal 64bit.
