2010-11-03T09:03:00.000Z	blackshirt	Gnea	yes..exactly.. i think ubuntu was compiled for i386 support..
2010-11-03T09:04:00.000Z	Gnea	blackshirt	wrong. it requires at least 256 megs of ram to simply operate. only the pentiums started supporting such an amount of memory, primarily the pentium 2 and pentium 3.
