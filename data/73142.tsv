2009-10-27T04:02:00.000Z	alejandro		is there a way to rebuild the fstab in ubuntu?
2009-10-27T04:02:00.000Z	alejandro		I resized a windows partition then created a new one outside the local ubuntu installation
2009-10-27T04:03:00.000Z	alejandro		now I try to mount the new partition but I dont have write permissions to it
2009-10-27T04:04:00.000Z	mrwes	alejandro	check the permissions to the mount point for the partition
