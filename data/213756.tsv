2008-04-28T07:01:00.000Z	Yuji1		Why does Ubuntu crap errors at me saying something about ata2.0 SAct SErr frozen (skipped some stuff) when I try to install it? This is the 7 I got from Canonical, the one I burnt worked until I threw the disc away saying yay Ubuntu's got here.
2008-04-28T07:03:00.000Z	Yuji1		Oh and...for downloading Ubuntu 8, should I click "alternative desktop CD" to download the LiveCD version?
2008-04-28T07:04:00.000Z	Yuji1		If I click it I get the liveCD?
