2008-09-23T20:55:00.000Z	vonderer		hello there. Can anyone please help me make my mic work? I've alreade switched it on everywhere I could, but it still has no effect: there is no chance of audio recording and skype won't send my voice.

2008-09-23T20:59:00.000Z	vonderer	hog	no, mic's unmuted everywhere
2008-09-23T20:59:00.000Z	vonderer	hog	that's the first thing I've done
