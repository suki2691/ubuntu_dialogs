2009-05-06T23:40:00.000Z	mrTr0ut		In firefox on ubuntu 9.04, I'm trying to play videos(from mlb.com) that use flash player...the audio plays okay, but the video freezes or it's sped up very quickly
2009-05-06T23:40:00.000Z	mrTr0ut		I've already tried reinstalling flash player
2009-05-06T23:41:00.000Z	mneptok	mrTr0ut	how did you install Flash?
