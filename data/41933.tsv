2010-11-22T05:54:00.000Z	cabbit		Sorry if I'm being rude but this is my first time in here. Is this where I'd come to ask questions if I was having issues with Ubuntu?
2010-11-22T05:55:00.000Z	cabbit		I'm having an issue with ubuntu refusing to boot after upgrading from 10.04 to 10.10. I'm wondering if someone could give me some advice?
2010-11-22T05:56:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	cabbit	Well, we'll need more details.
