2006-06-02T05:18:00.000Z	dsas	MadMerC	No, just update and dist-upgrade as normal
2006-06-04T05:07:00.000Z	MadMerC	dsas	what program did you suggest ???
2006-06-04T05:07:00.000Z	dsas	MadMerC	I suggested using bitlbee to connect to msn using an IRC client. But that's for msn messenger not for msn groups (he just needs to know what their irc server is i guess)
