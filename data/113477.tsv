2010-05-01T07:05:00.000Z	plattypus1		The wifi in this computer was working perfectly in Gentoo yesterday, but I managed to bork my Gentoo install and I can't afford the time to re-build it, so I installed Ubuntu... and now I've got a beautiful new system with no wi-fi. It detects the card, but the card doesn't find any wifi networks.

I believe the wrapper package will auto get the firmware and install it.. if not, you may need to get the window firmware file and install in the proper place
2010-05-01T07:08:00.000Z	plattypus1	graelin	I'm not terribly interested in using NDISwrapper. The card was working fine with native drivers, in linux, yesterday.
2010-05-01T07:13:00.000Z	graelin	plattypus1	well... try perusing /lib/firmware and see if something in there looks like its for your card. just a starting place... When I had problems I used instructions similar to http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/b43#device_firmware_installation
