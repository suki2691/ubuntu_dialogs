2012-01-15T20:40:00.000Z	osmodivs		Hello. For some strange reason I can't login to the LinuxMint server, but, since that distro is based in Ubuntu, I'll ask here. I backed up all my files with mintBackup 2.0.7 and now I am restoring my files to a new fresh intall of Mint12, but Why is the restored folders have root permissions? Does that means I need to chmod all of them?
