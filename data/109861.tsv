2011-09-16T07:49:00.000Z	excelsior		Ubuntu installer crashed. I clicked into the terminal and scrolled around to watch as it installed. I hit pagedown a couple of times, and it printed to the terminal. I backspaced before it did anything else, but I wonder if I caused the install to crash. Now I'm on a live CD, with Unity desktop, and everything but the wallpaper and mouse pointer disappeared when I clicked the Ubuntu symbol top left, and now it's incredibly unresponsive. Any thoughts?

2011-09-16T07:56:00.000Z	excelsior	soreau	ok, so unity crashed, now what? Installer crashed too. Should I try reinstalling?
