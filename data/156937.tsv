2009-09-28T08:55:00.000Z	Gills		Hello. I did something stupid, but which should be easily fixable.
2009-09-28T08:56:00.000Z	Gills		I edited xorg.conf, I rebooted and now I am stuck with command-line interface only. I only added two lines to xorg.conf, so I need help using vim to remove those lines.
2009-09-28T08:57:00.000Z	Gills		Unless someone knows a command-line text editor that's more user-friendly than vim.
