2009-09-07T10:14:00.000Z	Shoe		how do I install iTunes when I have Ubuntu? And before any of you say anything, I've tried all the alternatives I'm willing to try, and they all suck
2009-09-07T10:15:00.000Z	Shoe		I tried just downloading the XP/vista version with wine, but it only gave me files that exist in XP, like C:/program files
2009-09-07T10:17:00.000Z	Shoe		so, the question still remains, how can I get iTunes on my computer. anyone?
