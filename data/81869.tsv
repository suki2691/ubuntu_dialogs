2008-10-17T05:48:00.000Z	jrib	Expl0ited	install xubuntu-desktop?  What do you mean by "taking over my ubuntu install"?
2008-10-17T05:49:00.000Z	Expl0ited	jrib	I don't want it booting into it, just added as a session option
2008-10-17T05:49:00.000Z	jrib	Expl0ited	yes, just install xubuntu-desktop.  It just adds an option to gdm
