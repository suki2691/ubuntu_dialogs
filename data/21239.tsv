2011-09-28T11:50:00.000Z	Ibis		Is there by any chance an easier way to redirect request to port 80, to a different port? Like if I running apache on port 8080,  I would like to make all requests from port 80 to go to port 8080

2011-09-28T11:52:00.000Z	Ibis	curiousx	I tried that, but it's not working the way I want it to. Visiting http://127.0.0.1:80/  shows nothing. Other than an error message generated by my web browser.
