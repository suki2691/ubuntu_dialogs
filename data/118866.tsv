2010-09-18T05:43:00.000Z	seekr		Hi.  I'm an Mint newbie - just installed Mint, and am looking for "linux-backports-modules-jaunty" to fix a wireless problem on a Compaq CQ-61 laptop.  apt-get says it can't find the package.  :-(  Is there maybe a newer version of the package appropriate for lucid lynx?
