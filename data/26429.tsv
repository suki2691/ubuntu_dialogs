2010-10-17T15:14:00.000Z	Lanks		I am trying to open a program in ubuntu 10.04 and it loads and then just disappears. Is there any way that I can get some sort of log/output from it to see if there are any errors etc?
2010-10-17T15:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lanks	launch it from a terminal
2010-10-17T15:17:00.000Z	Lanks	erUSUL	what is the command?
