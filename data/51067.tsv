2009-08-05T16:07:00.000Z	technopagan	georgefrs	Personnaly, I'd say take Nvidia. I had a Ati-card in my old laptop and it made all kinds of trouble.
2009-08-05T16:09:00.000Z	georgefrs	technopagan	I'm inclined to agree, I have run an Ati x700 under linus in the past and it was an annoyance. But I've heard good things about 780G support
2009-08-05T16:11:00.000Z	technopagan	georgefrs	I am definitely NOT up to date on these matters. But because of some trouble with my current Intel video driver I talked to some fairly geeky guys just yesterday + they said to have no trouble with Nvidia.
