2010-02-22T08:22:00.000Z	ellmoe2000		I enjoyed using Ubuntu for the first time this weekend, the only kicker is that I can't find a driver for my network printer.

2010-02-22T08:24:00.000Z	hamnegga	ellmoe2000	- try unplugging it and then replugging it back in - Usually that starts up a driver search, with a pretty big list of lexmark drivers available already
