2008-03-13T18:56:00.000Z	m3gach33zy		Can anyone tell me why I cant install ubuntu on a desktop that uses a DVI converter?  I can get the install going but the video cuts off
2008-03-13T18:57:00.000Z	m3gach33zy		idk I cant remove the converter because I need the converter to see video...
2008-03-13T18:57:00.000Z	m3gach33zy		my vid card is dvi only and my monitor is vga
