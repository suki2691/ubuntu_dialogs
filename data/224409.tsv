2006-07-28T08:31:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		I'm installing Dapper onto my D610 because Windows decided to overwrite GRUB. Will doing this kill my Windows install?
2006-07-28T08:32:00.000Z	quiet	Concord_Dawn	yeah probably... if windows is using the whole drive...
2006-07-28T08:32:00.000Z	quiet		if not, then no.
2006-07-28T08:32:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	quiet	It's not. I partitioned the drive with Ubuntu before I installed Windows, but then Ubuntu decided to not work.
