2007-02-25T07:05:00.000Z	TashKavarish		anyone happen to know why changing monitor would make some resolutions dissapear?
2007-02-25T07:06:00.000Z	TashKavarish		this is a 1920x1200 monitor which used to work fine with this, i had a 1440x900 monitor for a while, now putting back the 1920x1200 one the highest res i can pick is 1600x1200
2007-02-25T07:06:00.000Z	nutterpc_	TashKavarish	because the other monitor you are using doesn't support the higher resolutions the previous one you were using did
