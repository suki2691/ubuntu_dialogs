2006-10-25T15:24:00.000Z	SirKillalot		will my update manager recognize that I will have to update from edgy beta to final? or do I have to edit the sources.list?
2006-10-25T15:24:00.000Z	LjL	SirKillalot	it will do that automatically
2006-10-25T15:25:00.000Z	LjL	SirKillalot	you're not using the beta any longer, anyway, if you updated. you're using the release candidate + some further updates.
