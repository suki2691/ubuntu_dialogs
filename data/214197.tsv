2005-10-12T06:36:00.000Z	CosmoDad	dooglus	what's the difference between a debian .deb file and a "debian package built for debian" ?
2005-10-12T06:36:00.000Z	dooglus	CosmoDad	the format is the same, but they are built against different versions of C and C++ libraries
2005-10-12T06:39:00.000Z	dooglus	CosmoDad	I think the vast majority of packages in ubuntu are re-builds of existing debian packages
