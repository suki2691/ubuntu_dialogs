2008-03-27T06:48:00.000Z	thatGuy_		I just installed Gutsy in the last 10 minutes, and it's not seeing any updates available
2008-03-27T06:48:00.000Z	thatGuy_		I'm clearly connected to the internet
2008-03-27T06:49:00.000Z	Parsec300	thatGuy_	I've had problems due to wrong config of the DNS server settings. I was able to browse most websites, but wasn't able to see any updates. This was on OSX tho.
