2012-10-05T08:30:00.000Z	toyiak		I just updated my 12.04 and my firefox won't start.  Installed Chromium and it too would not start.  I have access to net (hence the update and installation of Chromium) but no web browser will start.  Any one else ever experience this?
2012-10-05T08:30:00.000Z	toyiak		good idea
