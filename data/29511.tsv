2010-07-03T22:17:00.000Z	MTughan		I'm trying to chainload GRUB legacy from GRUB 2 with Ubuntu 10.04. The chainload seems to be kicking off legacy fine, but it's not finding its configuration file. The distro channel for legacy said I was chainloading wrong. How should it be done?
2010-07-03T22:18:00.000Z	wildbat|GER-GOAL	MTughan	why would you need chainloading GRUB while you have GRUB2?
2010-07-03T22:19:00.000Z	MTughan	wildbat|GER-GOAL	Because I have a working GRUB setup for another distro, that I'd like it to be able to update on its own without intervention from Ubuntu.
