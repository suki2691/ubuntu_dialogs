2006-01-13T16:02:00.000Z	bob_	UncleD	You should also see linux-image-2.6.12-9-686-smp in breezy/main
2006-01-13T16:03:00.000Z	bob_	UncleD	Really strange that you would see one but not see the other.  Both are in breezy/main.  Try using smp in the search pattern
2006-01-13T16:05:00.000Z	UncleD	bob_	smp in the pattern shows me nothing..
