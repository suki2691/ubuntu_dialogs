2010-04-13T10:18:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	swoody	actually the memory usage difference between Gnome and LXDE/XFCE aren't really all that great, see http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=linux_desktop_vitals&num=1 KDE uses a lot more memory
2010-04-13T10:25:00.000Z	swoody	ZykoticK9	that's very true on higher-end systems, but with low systems - say with 512 MB RAM - lxde uses 90MB less RAM, that's about an 18% decrease in memory useage... that can mean a lot to a system.
2010-04-13T10:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	swoody	that's true!
