2009-01-18T20:50:00.000Z	ThipThip		Can anybody comment generally on the quality of Intrepid AMD64?  I ran Gutsy AMD64 and I ended up switching to 32-bit because it seemed too buggy.  However, now, I have just upgraded to a Phenom Quad-core with 8GB RAM, and I'm thinking about trying 64-bit again.

2009-01-18T20:51:00.000Z	ThipThip	zorobot	Well, we'll be there for each other :-)
2009-01-18T20:52:00.000Z	zorobot	ThipThip	I am now still in Edgy, no support anymore :( ... so I will install Intrepid soon...
