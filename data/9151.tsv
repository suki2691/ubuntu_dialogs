2011-10-05T01:49:00.000Z	Gnea	ptt	put sda7 as /home
2011-10-05T01:50:00.000Z	ptt	Gnea	i have another dev as home. my home seems to have lot of space but not the root directory
2011-10-05T01:51:00.000Z	Gnea	ptt	gparted can do that. ah, so figure out subdir in / is taking up the most room and put that on sda7
