2008-10-21T22:05:00.000Z	Neaai	MTecknology	I'm just used this way. it's a habbit
2008-10-21T22:06:00.000Z	MTecknology	Neaai	I do that too, but I take the assumption people don't understand it and may screw something up :P
2008-10-21T22:06:00.000Z	Neaai	MTecknology	guess I'd better be careful as well. :)
