2009-04-25T15:33:00.000Z	clooluss		Mint: Ademan: No, neither of those work. It hasn't picked it up automatically, and the hware drivers screen is just empty.
2009-04-25T15:34:00.000Z	clooluss		mint: admen: and if I try to find the driver in the repo it says nvidia doesn't support Jaunty or something!
