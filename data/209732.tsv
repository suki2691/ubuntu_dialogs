2011-04-28T17:27:00.000Z	william2		I get the error "GTK-Warning ** cannot open display" when I execute "sudo gedit ~/.vnc/xstartup".  What can I do?
2011-04-28T17:27:00.000Z	LjL	william2	use gksudo gedit instead
2011-04-28T17:29:00.000Z	LjL	william2	do you currently have a graphical desktop, or not?
2011-04-28T17:29:00.000Z	LjL	william2	then gedit won't work. use "sudo nano" instead, it's quite easy to use as an editor
