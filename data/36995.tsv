2010-10-05T22:23:00.000Z	dajhorn	semitones_	anything that you can do with a CD-R, plus save files
2010-10-05T22:23:00.000Z	semitones_		just install ubuntu (the old debian installer), or run it live with the graphical installer?
2010-10-05T22:23:00.000Z	semitones_	dajhorn	for some reason when I booted it up, I only got the "install ubuntu" option, plus test cd for defects, etc
