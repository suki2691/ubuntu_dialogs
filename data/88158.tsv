2009-05-04T06:20:00.000Z	draco1889		i have installed ubuntu 9.04 3 times now. however after using it a few times and rebooting, my comp fails to boot because of a filesystem error. this has happened 3 times already with fresh, new installations. windows is running just fine, so i doubt it's my hard drive. anyone know what it could be?
2009-05-04T06:21:00.000Z	thiebaude	draco1889	how did you install ubuntu?
