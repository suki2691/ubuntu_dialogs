2007-05-13T16:30:00.000Z	vorbote	Fylk	best way is to grab the sources from debian and port them.

2007-05-13T16:32:00.000Z	vorbote	Fylk	the tips (I did the backporting by hand) is to change the dependency from libnss3-dev to libnss-dev, remove the avahi-compat-howl-dev dependency and add --with-nss-includes=/usr/include/firefox/nss and --with-nspr-include=/usr/include/firefox/nspr
