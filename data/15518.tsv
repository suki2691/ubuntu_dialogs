2011-10-03T02:57:00.000Z	Guest33286		Hi, I'm trying to use the scrubyt ruby gem but am having problems. it seems to require firewatir, but when I try to install that I get "Error installing firewatir:
2011-10-03T02:57:00.000Z	Guest33286		 hoe requires RubyGems version >= 1.4. Try 'gem update --system' to update RubyGems itself." but when I do that I get "gem update --system is disabled on Debian, because it will overwrite the content of the rubygems Debian package, and might break your Debian system in subtle ways. The Debian-supported way to update rubygems is through apt-get, using Debian official repositories"
