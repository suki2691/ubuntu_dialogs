2006-05-31T07:22:00.000Z	Ng	heanol	the only problems you'll have are with things that only exist for the x86 version, such as java browser plugins, flash, multimedia codecs and so on

2006-05-31T07:24:00.000Z	Ng	heanol	it depends what the system is for really. on a desktop I'm not convinced you gain anything by going to the amd64 version - most things are waiting for disk/user data, not the cpu
