2007-05-25T15:05:00.000Z	MidMark	brylie	that is and old daily what are you linking?
2007-05-25T15:06:00.000Z	MidMark	brylie	do not confuse people with old daily snapshot Feisty!
2007-05-25T15:08:00.000Z	MidMark	brylie	no but seems logic to link to an old Feisty snapshot cd when Feisty final is out? For me not
