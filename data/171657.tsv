2006-11-12T14:50:00.000Z	neildarlow	zukalk	i don't get that impression.
2006-11-12T14:50:00.000Z	neildarlow	zukalk	unless the upgrade reverted you to a vanilla 386 kernel?
2006-11-12T15:09:00.000Z	zukalk	neildarlow	sorry, i was afk. but that's a good question. the thing is... i can't remember whether i used a 686 kernel on this particular PC
