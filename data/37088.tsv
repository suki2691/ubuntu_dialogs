2010-02-18T20:16:00.000Z	cannam		I would like to discover (programmatically, from a script) which version of a given package is available in which Ubuntu release -- e.g. by querying a web resource
2010-02-18T20:17:00.000Z	cannam		preferably without having to scrape through https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/<packagename> -- any bright ideas, anyone? is there a service for this?
2010-02-18T20:18:00.000Z	zleap	cannam	won't synaptic tell you what version is on the repository
2010-02-18T20:18:00.000Z	cannam	zleap	I should have added: I'd like the solution to work even if not actually running on ubuntu itself
