2009-03-05T18:40:00.000Z	ubuntistas		i receive a message when i suspend: 'vlc has stopped hibernate from taking place playing some media' any clue?
2009-03-05T18:40:00.000Z	funkyHat	ubuntistas	yes, press stop in VLC before you suspend
2009-03-05T18:42:00.000Z	funkyHat	ubuntistas	oh right... were you using it earlier? perhaps try opening VLC and then closing it again (maybe it crashed?)
