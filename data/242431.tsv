2011-02-13T03:08:00.000Z	ACJ		I have a simple question:  I'm aware of the distinction between "safely remove hardware" and "unmount".  Is there a way to SRH from the terminal?
2011-02-13T03:08:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ACJ	for a disk? umount
2011-02-13T03:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ACJ	note that it is "umount" not "unmount"
2011-02-13T03:10:00.000Z	gordonjcp	ACJ	hm, not sure about that, it's not something I've ever needed to do
