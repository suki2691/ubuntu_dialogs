2011-01-05T19:29:00.000Z	jacobr		When I use Alt+F2 and type in "Update Manager -d" it tells me its not found. I'm trying to update to the Natty Alpha. Anyone know how to do this? I'm on Ubuntu 10.10
2011-01-05T19:30:00.000Z	Myrtti	jacobr	it would be "update-manager" not "Update Manager"
2011-01-05T19:31:00.000Z	jacobr	Myrtti	OH geeze. XD Thanks
2011-01-05T19:31:00.000Z	Myrtti	jacobr	no prob, #ubuntu+1 for further support :-)
