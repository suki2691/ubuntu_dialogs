2004-12-13T15:26:00.000Z	kent		Is some one here using the Rpanther aqua theme for Gtk here? I cant get it to work with X-chat. It makes the font in the line where i type these messages very hard to read since the font-color is just a tiny bit less white (a bit grey) than the background. The topic-line is the same, hard to read.    Other gtk-entrys are not hard to read, they get the font-color right.  How come xchat is this?

2004-12-13T15:28:00.000Z	pepsi_		i probably should do the same for my question, but im not sure if the ui colors for xchat were set by ubuntu or if they came with an xchat update
