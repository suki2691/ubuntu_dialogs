2010-04-04T03:43:00.000Z	leagris		I can not click buttons or actions inside flash-plugin using adobe nonfree version. Same problem inside Abrowser/Firefox or google Chrome. Do you have the same issue or know a fix?
2010-04-04T03:44:00.000Z	DaZ	leagris	it happens sometimes or always?
2010-04-04T03:45:00.000Z	leagris	deanus	don't know because I have an 64bit ubuntu
2010-04-04T03:45:00.000Z	DaZ	leagris	then probably you're not using 64bit flash
