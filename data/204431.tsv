2006-12-31T09:08:00.000Z	justin_		How can I see what kernel is installed on my machine (CPU wise) --- because everytime I try to install Ardour it says that my system is not supported (i386) --- even though I am on a PIV.. so I want to make sure the I686 kernel was installed and not the i386 version of it..
