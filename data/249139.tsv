2007-09-24T11:48:00.000Z	fivetwentysix		Im going to switch from 64-bit Ubuntu to 32-bit, will I need to format my partition?
2007-09-24T11:48:00.000Z	cast	fivetwentysix	nope.
2007-09-24T11:49:00.000Z	cast	fivetwentysix	you will have to remove all the 64bit libraries/binaries however...which is an rm -fr operation rather than a 'format' one, [i'm not entirely sure what format means, mkfs?] . just mkfs it, itll be quickest
2007-09-24T11:51:00.000Z	cast	fivetwentysix	just do a fresh install :)
