2010-01-03T02:01:00.000Z	Join-D		Hi there, can someone think of a reason a cronjob cant cd to a directory (permissions should be fine)
2010-01-03T02:01:00.000Z	guntbert	Join-D	you need to give the full path
2010-01-03T02:02:00.000Z	Join-D	guntbert	ok, but on a other machine the cd /home/myname && ./backup.sh works
2010-01-03T02:02:00.000Z	guntbert	Join-D	then I don't know - was just a quick idea
