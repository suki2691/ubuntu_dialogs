2004-10-14T12:51:00.000Z	rapha_		Then I'll be curious as to how Ubuntu will compete with Windows XP for her...
2004-10-14T12:51:00.000Z	linux_mafia	rapha_	i can almost guarantee she will hate spatial
2004-10-14T12:57:00.000Z	rapha_	linux_mafia	Hehe. No way. She's gonna get spatial. It was made for people like her, and I'm finding it invaluable myself (being a programmer and power user). Besides I don't think she'll do much file management
