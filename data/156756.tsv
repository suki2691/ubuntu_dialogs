2006-12-10T16:19:00.000Z	soundray	pantalaimon_	that's the point where you want to create a script rather than an alias
2006-12-10T16:20:00.000Z	pantalaimon_	soundray	isnt there something like a variable in the alias that is initializated when we are going to execute the command?
2006-12-10T16:21:00.000Z	soundray	pantalaimon_	not in the alias that comes builtin in bash (at least not to my knowledge)
