2010-08-02T03:39:00.000Z	AviMarcus		any suggestions for getting my ATI x1400 to work for dual screens?
2010-08-02T03:40:00.000Z	AviMarcus		and.. is there an irc client that lets you see more than 1x channel at a time?
2010-08-02T03:40:00.000Z	red2kic	AviMarcus	All IRC clients do that.
2010-08-02T03:41:00.000Z	AviMarcus	red2kic	I have quassel open now, and I had used konquis something with the live USB, but I don't see how to have both channels on screen at once
