2010-05-18T05:25:00.000Z	valium		hi all - just a quick question.  Where is the conf file for xorg now ?  I just upgraded to 10.4 and cant find /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2010-05-18T05:26:00.000Z	Daekdroom	valium	xorg.conf doesn't exist anymore for quite a few updates
2010-05-18T05:26:00.000Z	Daekdroom	valium	it's just optional.
2010-05-18T05:27:00.000Z	valium	Daekdroom	- ok.  So how to do i change settings in Xorg (as my video is now broken)
