2012-02-05T04:41:00.000Z	kinou		Hello everybody. I'm having a really disturbing bug on my Ubuntu Oneric.
2012-02-05T04:41:00.000Z	kinou		I can't poweroff the computer anymore.
2012-02-05T04:42:00.000Z	kinou		I can use sudo halt. It stops the computer, but the screen is still on.
2012-02-05T04:42:00.000Z	ultrixx	kinou	go to terminal and type "sudo shutdown -r now"
