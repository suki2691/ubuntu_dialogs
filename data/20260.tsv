2011-04-28T01:01:00.000Z	ayecee	Sakuragno	you would have to describe your problem first.
2011-04-28T01:02:00.000Z	ayecee	Sakuragno	if you could sum up on one line, that would make it easier for us to follow.
2011-04-28T01:06:00.000Z	ayecee	Sakuragno	are you in ubuntu right now? could you try connecting, wait for it to fail, and then paste the output of dmesg at http://paste.ubuntu.com ?
