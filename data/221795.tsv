2005-10-07T13:29:00.000Z	mr_roboto		is switching from hoary to breezy as simple as 'sed s/hoary/breezy/g sources.list' ?
2005-10-07T13:30:00.000Z	mr_roboto		and then doing a dist-upgrade?
2005-10-07T13:30:00.000Z	Kuolio	mr_roboto	I've heard, and experienced my self, that dist-upgrade is not working proper :(
