2009-06-13T21:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucian_	antivirus not needed, but you should have a good user account password,  letters and numbers at least, resoanblly long, and having a hardware firewall is good, if you got one in a router and enabled, that will probably do it

2009-06-13T22:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	lucian_	type that in the terminal, and why are you using that?
