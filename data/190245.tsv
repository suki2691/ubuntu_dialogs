2006-08-19T15:10:00.000Z	Warbo	keithhhh	To RUN WIndows in Ubunt uget vmware-player, but I don't think that will let you install Windows in it so you may need the server
2006-09-05T12:43:00.000Z	Warbo	keithhhh	"qemu -hda /dev/hda" or something like that should work
2006-09-05T12:44:00.000Z	Warbo	keithhhh	Jus tdon't run Ubuntu in it, since your filesystems will all go read-only
