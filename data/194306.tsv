2008-02-04T19:06:00.000Z	cas		Hi, I have a question about cronjobs, my 'crontab -e' is empty as root user, but there are some old jobs still executed
2008-02-04T19:06:00.000Z	cas		anyone know where the cronjobs are hidden? I guess it has something to do with my 'sudo -s'

2008-02-04T19:07:00.000Z	pike_	cas	you should be able to see em with or without root i believe
