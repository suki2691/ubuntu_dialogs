2008-06-06T04:36:00.000Z	dimedo		is there any known problem with Qt on hardy amd64? i'm experiencing crashes with the Psi instant messenger if i try to get into the appearance options. also all the Qt apps use an uglier font and theme than before on my last ubuntu install
2008-06-06T04:37:00.000Z	kitche	dimedo	it's the same font really just an option is turned off now I believe so the fonts do not look crisp
2008-06-06T04:37:00.000Z	dimedo	kitche	do you know how i can reverse that setting?
2008-06-06T04:38:00.000Z	kitche	dimedo	have to recompile a program I do believe
