2006-07-15T09:02:00.000Z	Samus_Aran		can someone tell me what 127.0.1.1 is ?  Ubuntu has it in /etc/hosts, I've never seen a distro use something other than 127.0.0.1
2006-07-15T09:04:00.000Z	Samus_Aran		Ubuntu added for me: "127.0.0.1  localhost" and "127.0.1.1  atu"
2006-07-15T09:05:00.000Z	Samus_Aran		I've always just stuck my hostnames as 127.0.0.1
2006-07-15T09:05:00.000Z	IcemanV9	Samus_Aran	i have same thing in mine as well - 0.1 & 1.1; these are just loop connections
