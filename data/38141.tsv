2010-02-01T05:55:00.000Z	inasmu	lnx4ver	I'm not quite sure what he did, but I think it had something to do with compiz or the ATI drivers (this is a lenovo ideapad)
2010-02-01T05:56:00.000Z	inasmu	lnx4ver	it fails during boot while trying to start cups, after a few minutes the screen turns green
2010-02-01T05:57:00.000Z	lnx4ver	inasmu	ok this is more clear
