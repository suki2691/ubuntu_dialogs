2007-01-27T15:23:00.000Z	ineluki12	section31	if you want a partition to be there after rebooting, you need to make an entry in /etc/fstab
2007-01-27T15:25:00.000Z	ineluki12	section31	open up a terminal and enter 'man fstab'; this will explain what you need to do; also, take a look at your current /etc/fstab file, and try to mimmick one of the other, similar entries
