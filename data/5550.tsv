2012-02-16T14:15:00.000Z	Israfel		Is there a better VNC server other than vino-server?
2012-02-16T14:16:00.000Z	doda-	Israfel	if you need only cli check tightvnc
2012-02-16T14:24:00.000Z	Israfel	doda-	I have SSH for CLI. I just need VNC so I can log in the GUI on the server.
2012-02-16T14:27:00.000Z	doda-	Israfel	well with ssh you can start whatever vnc servers you like, most are console line with no gui, vino on the other hand is integrated in gnome
