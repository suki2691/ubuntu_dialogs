2009-11-23T13:45:00.000Z	sharpen047	faderhval	do you have surround sound?
2009-11-23T13:46:00.000Z	faderhval	sharpen047	only a 2.1 stereo set
2009-11-23T13:46:00.000Z	sharpen047	faderhval	it sounds like a speaker problem, there is only one jack for all three speakers, the system doesnt know its 2.1
