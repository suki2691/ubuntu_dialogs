2006-09-15T11:15:00.000Z	nextstate2		I just installed ubuntu desktop. There's no gcc installed. How do I install it?
2006-09-15T11:17:00.000Z	burnboy	nextstate2	make and gcc, used for compiling source files (like .tar.gz
2006-09-15T11:21:00.000Z	burnboy	nextstate2	check that your /etc/apt/sources.list has universe
2006-09-15T11:21:00.000Z	burnboy	nextstate2	might even be just build-essentials (don't think so though)
