2008-10-13T12:03:00.000Z	theCarpenter		does anyone know why the latest eclipse version in the repos is 3.2?
2008-10-13T12:05:00.000Z	theCarpenter		is there any way to force updates?
2008-10-13T12:06:00.000Z	_2	theCarpenter	are you sure that you "need" a newer version before the next release ?   8.10
2008-10-13T12:04:00.000Z	_2	theCarpenter	because that was the current stable version when the release was compiled ?
