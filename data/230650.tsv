2008-07-18T04:31:00.000Z	holmser		Hi all... I'm trying to switch my mother over to ubuntu on her laptop and we are running into a snag getting it to recognize her sony memory stick
2008-07-18T04:31:00.000Z	holmser		her card reader will read my MMC and SD cards, just not her memory stick
2008-07-18T04:33:00.000Z	holmser		any ideas on how to mount her memory stick?
2008-07-18T04:34:00.000Z	llama_	holmser	what exactly is the problem? any stuff you can offer to help people as far as diagnostics? is it just not being found, or being misidentified, etc? any interesting dmesg output?
