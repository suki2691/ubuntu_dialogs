2010-03-29T10:18:00.000Z	Intertricity_		I need to virtualize ubuntu under windows such that I have good performance on graphics- what would be the best way to go about that?
2010-03-29T10:20:00.000Z	Intertricity_		Well I need to run ubuntu and compile some things, since it's a pain inwindows- but I need it to access my graphics card :\
