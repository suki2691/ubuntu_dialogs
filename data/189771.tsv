2006-06-05T10:04:00.000Z	alth		Damnit, I keep middleclicking in firefox to autoscroll (which it does) but occasionally it opens google or one of my bookmarks instead :(
2006-06-05T10:06:00.000Z	kbrosnan	alth	you likely need to disable middle click paste type about:config in the address bar and filter on middle and find middlemouse.paste change to false
2006-06-05T10:07:00.000Z	kbrosnan	alth	you also might want to set middlemouse.contentLoadURL to false too
2006-06-05T10:07:00.000Z	alth	kbrosnan	 right, thanks, done :)
