I've noticed that in the repos, there is a linux-image 686 for smp, and one for without smp, but the one without smp is of an older version?  the one with smp is 2.6.15-26 where the other is 2.6.15-24?

2006-07-28T14:49:00.000Z	synic	lampshade	it should work fine
2006-07-28T14:49:00.000Z	synic	lampshade	I'd stick with the non-smp one
