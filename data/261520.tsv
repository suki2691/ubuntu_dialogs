2006-01-02T17:48:00.000Z	FreakyFries		Is it possible to listen music AND play a game (counterstrike) and hear both the sounds? If I start the game first and after that I start beep-media-payer, and push the play button I get this error: Please check that: 1. you have the correct output plugin selected. 2. no other programs are blocking the soundcard. 3. your soundcard is configured properly. If I start beep-media-player first and then start the game, I just don't have any sound
