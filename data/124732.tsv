2007-11-04T21:08:00.000Z	EdgEy		can you not somehow run the livecd from a partition
2007-11-04T21:08:00.000Z	EdgEy		and then install from there
2007-11-04T21:09:00.000Z	EdgEy		unless you can mount the image and then run the installer for 7.10 from 5.04
2007-11-04T21:10:00.000Z	ItchyHobo	EdgEy	we will have to assume that image will be on the primary partition cuz live cd requires a reebot
