2010-08-27T00:54:00.000Z	urthmover		I have a problem that did not exist in 9.10 but now exists in 10.04.  I use a laptop with an external monitor.  I like to leave the laptop closed and use the ext monitor along with ext keyboard/mouse.  The problem is this...the power management does not shutoff the display during idle.  It does however shutoff the display when idle if the laptop is open.  Where do I begin to troubleshoot this?

2010-08-27T00:59:00.000Z	urthmover	arielCo	that one is not really what is happening for me....the problem I face is that with the laptop closed  my monitor does not enter powersave when I lock or let my computer go idle
