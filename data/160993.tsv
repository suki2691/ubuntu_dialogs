2007-11-08T06:09:00.000Z	mwazny		I have a creative sound blaster 2NX usb sound card and it will play sound perfectly for music and videos and such but it won't play any system sounds(startup sound, etc) or anything else(sound on a webpage) Also, in sound preferences testing all the playback devices sounds a long beep, just like it should. Does any1 have any idea what could be going on?

2007-11-08T06:13:00.000Z	mwazny		does anyone know how to set up sound? my sound card seems to only play sounds from a music player but won't play system sounds or anything
