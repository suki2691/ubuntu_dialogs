2007-09-22T13:59:00.000Z	wweasel	hmhowie	Thanks for the advice :) Portable scripts are way beyond my scope right now (i'm just backing up my computer over rsync).  However, it's good to know if I ever want something to be truly cross-platform.
2007-09-22T14:00:00.000Z	hmhowie	wweasel	i only mentioned it because i got ripped apart on #solaris recently for inadvertantly using a gnu specific extention ;)
2007-09-22T14:00:00.000Z	wweasel	hmhowie	 Oops :)
