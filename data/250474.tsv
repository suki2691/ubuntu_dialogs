2005-04-20T07:08:00.000Z	kent		I just put an audio-cd in my cdrom on Hoary and it automaticly started the cdplayer and it all works well. But, should not gnome use a feature kind of like windows, where one gets to choose between "play, rip the cd, etc"?  It would be cooler, than as is now.

2005-04-20T07:11:00.000Z	kent	jintxo	i checked that one. It cant popup a dialog about what to do with the newly inserted medium. Like, play it, rip it etc.
