2007-05-02T13:17:00.000Z	yeti	bOOtMaKeR	well, kde/kubuntu has a quite good interface at system settings -> printers. did you check that one?
2007-05-02T13:22:00.000Z	yeti	bOOtMaKeR	that dmesg log looks strange... why does it unregister the printer right after registering it?
2007-05-02T13:24:00.000Z	bOOtMaKeR	yeti	that's my question ;)  i have no idea
