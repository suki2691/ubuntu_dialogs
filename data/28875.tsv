2010-10-27T00:26:00.000Z	Jygga		why does dpkg complain about /etc/nginx beeing a directory here?=> dpkg: nginx: warning - conffile `etc/nginx' is not a plain file or symlink (= `/etc/nginx')
2010-10-27T00:26:00.000Z	Jygga		is that some inconsistency with the configure process of that particular source? (nginx)
2010-10-27T00:26:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Jygga	what was dpkg supposed to be doing?
