2010-05-11T01:49:00.000Z	yondering	trond__	if you're running a 64-bit host, you can use either 32 or 64 bit guests in virtualbox without much difference.
2010-05-11T01:51:00.000Z	trond__	yondering	ok. Thanks. Any difference in "driver support" or max usage of ram? Windows 7 driver/software support for 64-bit is so-so...
2010-05-11T01:52:00.000Z	yondering	trond__	I'd say that depends on your guest OS or distribution.  what are you running the host on, and what are you going to use in vb?
