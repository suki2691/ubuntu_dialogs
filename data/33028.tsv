2010-05-03T01:41:00.000Z	JaydeeSN		Hi - I don't have enough diskspace on the ubuntu filesystem to do any updates - but there is plenty of space on the windows partition - can I move any across?

2010-05-03T01:43:00.000Z	slw	JaydeeSN	it's advisable to back up your data first though.
2010-05-03T01:43:00.000Z	slw	JaydeeSN	Sorry, it won't be called gparted in the menu. It'll be called "Partition Editor" or somehting like that.
