However when I compile it apt wants to keep overwriting it via apt-get upgrade. How can I append my own version to the end of this? like say 5.0.5-bender
2006-03-31T15:12:00.000Z	crimsun	BenderNZ	use 5.0.5-2ubuntu1.2bender1
2006-03-31T15:12:00.000Z	BenderNZ	crimsun	yes, but how do I append that version ?
2006-03-31T15:12:00.000Z	crimsun	BenderNZ	edit debian/changelog
