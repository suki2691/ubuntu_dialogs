2008-04-05T02:35:00.000Z	c0ldfusion	Snares	I've played with mono develop a little; crazy when you're used to MS visual C#
2008-04-05T02:36:00.000Z	Snares	c0ldfusion	you you know why when I try to run an older release---mono-1.1.12_0-installer.bin in the terminal I do ./mono-1.1.12_0-installer.bin and it just gives me $ right over again; no installer starts
2008-04-05T02:36:00.000Z	Snares	c0ldfusion	this same installer has worked fine on ubuntu 6.04
