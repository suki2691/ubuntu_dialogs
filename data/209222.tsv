2008-11-01T17:33:00.000Z	LjL	Monagasque	you can't, because MSN Messenger is a proprietary Microsoft application that only runs on Microsoft Windows
2008-11-01T17:33:00.000Z	LjL	Monagasque	however, there are other programs that can use the MSN protocol
2008-11-01T17:36:00.000Z	LjL	Monagasque	you've edited it with vi?
