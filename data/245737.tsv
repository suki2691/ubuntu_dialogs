2005-08-07T05:52:00.000Z	equex		i wonder why i dont get OpenGL working on my Radeon9200, i installed the drivers from ATI, the module appears to be loaded (appears in lsmod) still it is in Mesa Indirect mode.. xorg.conf says its enabled. any ideas?
2005-08-07T05:52:00.000Z	mjr	equex	dunno about the ATI binary driver, but by the way, 9200 _should_ work accelerated with the default free driver also
2005-08-07T05:53:00.000Z	equex	mjr	seems 2d acc is working , but GL doesnt work
