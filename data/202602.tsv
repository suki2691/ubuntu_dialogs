2006-06-06T11:08:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		ok, I went into man twice, and used Ctrl-Z instead of q, which apparently simply stopped the process but didn't terminate it...now I can't exit the Terminal window because it says "There are stopped jobs"...how do I shut down those two stopped jobs?
2006-06-06T11:08:00.000Z	krazykit	Geoffrey2	kill them
2006-06-11T10:45:00.000Z	krazykit	Geoffrey2	yeah
2006-06-11T10:53:00.000Z	krazykit	Geoffrey2	unless you background the process, yes
