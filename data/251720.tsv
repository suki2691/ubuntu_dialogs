2005-01-29T07:31:00.000Z	willis__		just wondering how often the ubuntu servers rebuild the Packages file (i'm anxious for the new restricted-modules)
2005-01-29T07:32:00.000Z	daniels	willis__	well, it took me 45min to throw the new tarball up my DSL, then it'll probably take about 5-10 minutes for the buildds to notice and build it, 2m2s/2m10s/3m for the various buildds to build it and then upload it, and then Packages.gz gets regenerated every half hour
2005-01-29T07:33:00.000Z	willis__	daniels	oh wow thanks for the details, and thanks for your work
2005-01-29T07:33:00.000Z	daniels	willis__	no worries
