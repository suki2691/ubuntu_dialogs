2012-05-19T16:06:00.000Z	Saw		hi guys, I have a a question about packages. I can see ubuntu got packages specifically for it. What are these? why should I install them and not the "offical" ones? can I install the offical ones anyway?

2012-05-19T16:07:00.000Z	Saw	hwilde	- for ubuntu. for example, g++. ubuntu (lucid) got g++ 4.4.3. at GCC website, you can find 4.7. any reason I should use and not the other?
2012-05-19T16:12:00.000Z	Saw	hwilde	- why? lucid got LTS, it's still supported, isn't it? :P
