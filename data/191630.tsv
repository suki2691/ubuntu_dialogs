2006-09-13T14:26:00.000Z	MTecknology		I am running Ubuntu live. I am trying to edit an ext3 partition containing /boot. When I try to open the partition in gksudo nautilus, it has errors trying to mount.
2006-09-13T14:26:00.000Z	paradizelost	MTecknology	did you mount the partition yet?
2006-09-13T14:26:00.000Z	paradizelost		!ask
