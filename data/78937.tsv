2009-02-11T06:53:00.000Z	TML		Does ubuntu have an equivalent to /etc/debian_version that tells the Ubuntu release?
2009-02-11T06:54:00.000Z	fxhp	TML	: cmd uname -a
2009-02-11T06:54:00.000Z	TML		"lsb-release -a" - awesome
2009-02-11T06:54:00.000Z	TML	fxhp	uname just tells the kernel. lsb-release works. :)
