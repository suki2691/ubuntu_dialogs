2008-12-21T02:59:00.000Z	incubii	edgimar	yeah when i goto network list and add a new server the existing ones have server/port. so for instance i added irc.au.freenode.net/6667. so i guess you could put 127.0.0.1/1234
2008-12-21T02:59:00.000Z	incubii	edgimar	i am using X-Chat 2.8.6
2008-12-21T03:00:00.000Z	edgimar_	incubii	Ok, that seems to work.  Great.  I didn't see it clearly documented anywhere, so I was trying ":" and " " as separators.
