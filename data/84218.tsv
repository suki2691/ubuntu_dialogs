2009-04-16T19:43:00.000Z	Chowder		does gnome-look have uninstall instructions?
2009-04-16T19:45:00.000Z	recon69	Chowder	dont know about uninstall instructions, but some people just use the server install as it has no gui
2009-04-16T19:46:00.000Z	Chowder	recon69	server install doesn't install xorg, though
