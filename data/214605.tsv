2005-10-23T12:38:00.000Z	schimmi		hi! is there a good reason for the open port 32771 on breezy? (seems to be by hplip)
2005-10-23T12:39:00.000Z	El_Che	schimmi	maybe add a hostbased firewall?
2005-10-23T12:39:00.000Z	schimmi	El_Che	no, I wonder why a standard install of breezy has this open port
2005-10-23T12:40:00.000Z	El_Che	schimmi	the thin line between security and user comfort. I feel your pain.
