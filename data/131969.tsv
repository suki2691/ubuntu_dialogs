2008-07-04T11:01:00.000Z	_NiC		If I use prevu to build backported packages from intrepid for use on hardy, how much trouble might I get when I want to do a dist-upgrade later?

2008-07-04T11:03:00.000Z	RAdams	_NiC	you should be ok, as the dist-upgrade will have a higher version, but YMMV :)
2008-07-04T11:08:00.000Z	RAdams	_NiC	sounds like you're all set. good luck, have fun with that :)
