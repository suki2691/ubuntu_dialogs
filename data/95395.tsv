2008-06-10T08:18:00.000Z	Bodsda	Josellis	programs from the repo'sare always in a .deb format and are installed for you without having to compile from source
2008-06-10T08:20:00.000Z	Josellis	Bodsda	but for programs that do no need compiling (e.g. thunderbird, skype, etc.) is it better to download from ubuntu server or the website (mozilla.com and skype.com)
