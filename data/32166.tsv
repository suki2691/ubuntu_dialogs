2010-05-10T01:41:00.000Z	ozzy2444		hmmm, well then. Where do the windows go when minimized?
2010-05-10T01:43:00.000Z	guntbert	ozzy2444	do you meant the panel at the bottom?
2010-05-10T01:44:00.000Z	ozzy2444	guntbert	yeah kinda, when I minimize the windows disappear down towards the trash can. I have been just alt+tab to get back and forth
