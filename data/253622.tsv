2005-04-22T15:43:00.000Z	amsaarel		Hi..Awesome distro, only complaint is that NTFS filesystems don't seem to work by default..Could you add eg "Captive NTFS" to Ubuntu default install..? It's a wrapper for using the Windows NTFS driver on Linux, apparently pretty stable
2005-04-22T15:45:00.000Z	amsaarel		hmm..You mean the code in Windows or something else..? Couldn't you just autodetect it from the hard drive or something..
2005-04-22T15:46:00.000Z	amsaarel		or is the Captive system itself on some weird license?
