2011-03-01T06:05:00.000Z	drexl	gsp2009	http://www.no-ip.com/ I used to use this I don't know if things have changed since then
2011-03-01T06:05:00.000Z	gsp2009	drexl	thanks.. dyndns.com requires user intervention like every five days for free accounts... it is a pain. I will check out no-ip
2011-03-01T06:06:00.000Z	drexl	gsp2009	I had a web server running on xp with no-ip and it worked really well
