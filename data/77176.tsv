2009-06-26T21:43:00.000Z	Neremor		I'm searching for an program to write music sheets (like capella, but that's windows only) for linux. Best would be if there is an midi-synthesizer within the program that "compiles" my melody as preview... is there something like this availible? thanks in advance :)
