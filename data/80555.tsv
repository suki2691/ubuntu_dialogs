2010-12-28T06:26:00.000Z	dotblank	naiad	open its control file find the depends copy and past it into apt-get remove?
2010-12-28T06:27:00.000Z	naiad	dotblank	that's what i've been doing, but it seems silly to be able to install all the packages with the meta but not remove them ;\ heh
2010-12-28T06:27:00.000Z	dotblank	naiad	I think it may be on purpose.. try using the computer janitor to remove them
