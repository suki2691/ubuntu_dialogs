2009-01-15T02:34:00.000Z	juggalo		Hey guys, I tried to install amarok, but it asked me for amarok xine or amarok engine, so I downloaded amarok xine and tried to install but it said "dependacy not satisfiable: amarok" what did I do wrong?
2009-01-15T02:35:00.000Z	dayo_	juggalo	sudo aptitude install amarok-xine
2009-01-15T02:36:00.000Z	dayo_	juggalo	or sudo aptitude amarok-engines
2009-01-15T02:36:00.000Z	dayo_	juggalo	oh i see.well then u'll have to dl *all* the dependencies. can be a pain in the ass
