2005-10-28T15:07:00.000Z	muszek		I have a funny issue: my friend has burnt edubuntu instead of ubuntu by mistake.  I just installed it on my parent's PC and can't really dnl Ubuntu over here.  Is there a big difference between those distros?

2005-10-28T15:08:00.000Z	crimsun	muszek	you'll have nearly identical functionality (you'll have a bit more installed)
