2012-02-05T06:31:00.000Z	worstadmin		Question: If I install linux-image-3.1.4-generic_3.1.4_amd64.deb - will it automatically update installed kernel modules too? Im upgrading my kernel so that one of the modules is rebuilt as well
2012-02-05T06:32:00.000Z	worstadmin		Or actually - given the structure of modules.. I guess it doesnt need to be rebuilt just updated

2012-02-05T06:35:00.000Z	holstein	worstadmin	just grab that .deb as well from where ever you got the other...
