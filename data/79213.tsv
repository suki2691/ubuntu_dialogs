2012-04-20T01:39:00.000Z	dhunter		I've read doc/examples/apt-https-method-example.conf and followed its advice, but when I `apt-get update` I get a message like: Failed to fetch https://bld-repo-ext-dev.oblong.com/apt/dists/lucid/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz  server certificate verification failed.
