2012-01-19T21:06:00.000Z	persiluhu		is there any ubuntu/apache channel? or someone who might help me with lost /var/www folder, after upgrade?
2012-01-19T21:06:00.000Z	jutnux	persiluhu	What's the problem?
2012-01-19T21:07:00.000Z	jutnux	persiluhu	Did you simply upgrade or do a fresh install?
2012-01-19T21:08:00.000Z	jutnux	persiluhu	type sudo apt-get install lamp-server^ if you want apache easily.
