2007-03-18T09:29:00.000Z	QsM`		Hey, can anyone please assist me on login into my server who is running ubuntu 6.0.6.1? Shamefully I've never used Linux before.
2007-03-18T09:29:00.000Z	Flannel	QsM`	hwo are you logging in? (and, it's just 6.06)
2007-03-18T09:31:00.000Z	Flannel	QsM`	are you sitting at the server?
2007-03-18T09:32:00.000Z	Flannel	QsM`	well, what interface do they give you to login?  It's probably SSH, but you should find out for sure.
