2012-06-29T09:53:00.000Z	jagginess	starbuck	probably with gnome-extensions (ppa), but it was very broken when i tried to use any gnome-extension
2012-06-29T09:56:00.000Z	starbuck	jagginess	i don't even have gnome-extension, apt-cache search can't find it
2012-06-29T09:57:00.000Z	starbuck	jagginess	sounds good, thx...
