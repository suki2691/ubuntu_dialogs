2008-12-06T09:43:00.000Z	JulioNeto	Lamo	I had a big problem with Flash. The solution was... well... nothing... I installed Gnash and it worked... after I installed Opera and it worked with both (Flash and Gnash)... I removed Gnash and for some reason... I don't know why... it (flash) is working in FF now
