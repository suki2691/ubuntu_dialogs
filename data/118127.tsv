2007-11-14T20:18:00.000Z	arghh2d2		I know this isnt an ubuntu question, but i asked on #bitchx and there arent but 3 or 4 users there and none reply, so.. does anyone know how to save aliases in bitchx?
2007-11-14T20:18:00.000Z	jrib	arghh2d2	it's  /save  in irssi.  Try that
2007-11-14T20:19:00.000Z	arghh2d2	jrib	i do save and i even /set savefile to ~/.BitchX/BitchX.sav and it still doesnt work
2009-11-15T19:15:00.000Z	jrib	arghh2d2	that's not good advice
