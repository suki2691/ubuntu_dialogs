2007-08-20T05:01:00.000Z	Polygon89		Hello, i need some help. Before, i could use torrent programs like azureus without problem, and now for some reason i cant upload at all with Azureus, but my download is fine. I havent changed anything in settings i dont think..... any suggestions?
2007-08-20T05:02:00.000Z	hetzz	Polygon89	sounds like routin/firewall problem
2007-08-20T05:03:00.000Z	Polygon89	hetzz	azureus has upnp that has worked in the past, and i do not have a firewall (besides the router itself)....
2007-08-20T05:03:00.000Z	hetzz	Polygon89	ok, cant really help. just guessing what could have changed
