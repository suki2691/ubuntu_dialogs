2008-11-23T03:49:00.000Z	Dvyjones		Sudo doesn't work for me... Upon trying to change my password, it works. Then, when I try to use something that requires sudo, it doesn't... I am part of the admin group, and haven't (intentionally) changed /etc/sudoers... It doesn't say I'm not in the sudoers file, only "Sorry, try again" as if my password was wrong... Any ideas?

2008-11-23T03:50:00.000Z	Dvyjones	Mecha25	No. I've tried to copy-paste it also...
