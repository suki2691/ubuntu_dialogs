2011-07-15T16:28:00.000Z	noip		How can I see a list of recently updated packages? I'm pretty sure it was an update from two days ago that has completely messed up my internet connection
2011-07-15T16:30:00.000Z	Pici	noip	There is a log of all installed packages in /var/log/dpkg.log
2011-07-15T16:30:00.000Z	noip	Pici	does it show updates or just when I installed packages?
2011-07-15T16:32:00.000Z	noip	Pici	I'm looking at that log file. Why does it show dates from next week?
