2008-05-15T09:54:00.000Z	deserteagle		does anyone know why WINE keeps saying there is no configured c drive?

2008-05-15T09:56:00.000Z	deserteagle	RyanPrior	well, i used to have it installed and running office 2003 just fine, but after copying a whole bunch of windows files into the drive_c dir, office stopped working so i just deleted drive_c, removed wine and installed it again... but now it doesn't work
