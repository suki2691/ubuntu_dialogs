2007-11-03T05:58:00.000Z	n00bular		upon install
2007-11-03T06:00:00.000Z	n00bular		perhaps you did not understand the question, is the firewall.. enabled.. by default.
2007-11-03T06:00:00.000Z	Pici	n00bular	iptables is installed, but it by default does not block anything. But then again, by default there is nothing listening (or not much)
