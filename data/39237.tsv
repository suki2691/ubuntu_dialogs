2010-01-10T05:02:00.000Z	thesabry		I installed vlc couple of days ago on my ubuntu 9.10 but it doesn't work. I cannot read mp3. If I had the files in the library it shows lenght = 0 and nothing happen if I press play. I also tried to launch it from the terminal in debug mode and it says playlist empty .. even if I have added music ... Anyone already had this kind of issues with VLC ?
