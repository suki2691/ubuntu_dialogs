2012-09-23T01:23:00.000Z	Marcellus		Hello
2012-09-23T01:24:00.000Z	Marcellus		is this channel for asking questions or is there another channel for that?
2012-09-23T01:25:00.000Z	Marcellus		I'm trying to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 but I don't get the option to automatically partition my hard drive, just to delete Windows 7 or manually configure the partition. But when I try that I'm unable to change the size of /dev/sda2
2012-09-23T01:26:00.000Z	Meris	Marcellus	how many primary partitions do you have in your current partitioning?
