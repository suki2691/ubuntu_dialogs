2010-02-09T11:35:00.000Z	binMonkey		if i remove virtualbox from my system will the hard drives i made with it be immediately available again?
2010-02-09T11:37:00.000Z	d9500	binMonkey	if it doesn't remove the virtual hard drives when you remove the file, then just rm -r ~?.Virtualbox (warning: this will remove ALL virtual hard disks and vbox configuration files)
2010-02-09T11:37:00.000Z	binMonkey	d9500	and the formatting that vbox did won't matter?
2010-02-09T11:50:00.000Z	binMonkey	d9500	and mneptok , thanks for the help.
