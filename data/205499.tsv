2005-12-07T07:24:00.000Z	svaksha		the resolv.conf file gets rewritten ever half hour, can some one help with this
2005-12-07T07:24:00.000Z	quacker	svaksha	install a cacheing DNS proxy if you want more control of name resolution
2005-12-07T07:26:00.000Z	quacker	svaksha	what exactly is the problem -- what is it that is not working?  Are webpages not resolving,
