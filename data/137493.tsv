2007-04-21T12:31:00.000Z	squitijax		Is there a text-based installer in the x86-desktop cd?
2007-04-21T12:31:00.000Z	Flannel	squitijax	no.  You'll need the alternate CD
2007-04-21T12:32:00.000Z	squitijax	Flannel	the problem I'm having is related to 'GNOME Session Manager"
2007-04-21T12:33:00.000Z	squitijax	Flannel	if it can be resolved by not having me download another iso, I'ld be grateful
