2011-07-22T16:31:00.000Z	AdamT_		Good morning.  I need some help with my web server (samba).  I entered a new web address into httpd.conf and set the port and everything, but I can't get it to show up in teh browser... any ideas?  Is there somewhere else I need to enter information?

2011-07-22T16:33:00.000Z	Deesl	AdamT_	what is that you are trying to achieve?
2011-07-22T17:11:00.000Z	Deesl	AdamT_	okay, each unix admin is different... the server he sets up tells his character
