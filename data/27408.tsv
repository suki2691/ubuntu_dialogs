2010-08-14T20:01:00.000Z	oCean_	freddymx	there are several issues with suspend/hibernate (&resume) at launchpad.
2010-08-14T20:04:00.000Z	freddymx	oCean_	so, for now the only solution is waiting?
2010-08-14T20:05:00.000Z	oCean_	freddymx	I don't know, you could browse the several issues to see if there are fixes/workarounds. For some reason such issues have been always around.
