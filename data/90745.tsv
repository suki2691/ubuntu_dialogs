2010-07-15T13:17:00.000Z	mike-from-canmor		Ok here is the problem I will just be using ubuntu 9.10 and all of a sudden it will freeze up nothing will respond and music or sound will keep repeating over and over in the background, I have to power the system off to fix this problem. It has been happening to me since I started using ubuntu and would like to fix it. So How do I fix this problem, and it also just occured this is it powered up after the crash so how can I
2010-07-15T13:17:00.000Z	mike-from-canmor		 get a log to diagnose the problem?
2010-07-15T13:17:00.000Z	mike-from-canmor		sorry for the run on sentence.

You might be helped by upgrade to a later ubuntu (10.04) where the kernel doesn't have your problem, but it might also be a hw problem.
