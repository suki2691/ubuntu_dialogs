2008-11-02T13:08:00.000Z	rsmith		which repository has Unison?  I can't find it on Ubuntu 8.10
2008-11-02T13:10:00.000Z	m0u5e	rsmith	apt-cache search unison (in a term)
2008-11-02T13:11:00.000Z	rsmith	m0u5e	thanks... weird, it doesn't show up in synaptic search, but does in apt search
2008-11-02T13:11:00.000Z	m0u5e	rsmith	yeah, just type sudo apt-get install unison
