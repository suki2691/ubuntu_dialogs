2010-11-07T10:01:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Dr_Willis	i thought there was no KMS for nvidia at this point. am i wrong about that?
2010-11-07T10:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jmichaelx	 im not sure about KMS. I normally have to use the nomodeset to get my nvidia systems  where they can actually boot/install, then once i install the nvidia drivers. they seem to work without he option.
