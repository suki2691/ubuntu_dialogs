2008-10-21T04:11:00.000Z	kwyjibo		anyone know of an X font that looks exactly like the vga text mode font when booting up?
2008-10-21T04:12:00.000Z	onre	kwyjibo	dunno if there's one readily made, but it wouldn't be that hard to just dump those off the character rom, if you know what you're doing. they're bitmaps, after all.
2008-10-21T04:12:00.000Z	kwyjibo	onre	i don't know what i'm doing :<
2008-10-21T04:13:00.000Z	onre	kwyjibo	then all i can suggest is googling for 'rom font' or something.
