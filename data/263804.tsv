2004-11-30T09:48:00.000Z	rapha		Why doesn't GLX work with X.Org (I just changed to that). X log file says about some unresolved symbols...
2004-11-30T09:48:00.000Z	rapha		Do I have to exchange any other packages?
2004-11-30T09:49:00.000Z	Depht	rapha	not many people will have tried XOrg on ubuntu, you may be better off searching for it on google or somewhere
