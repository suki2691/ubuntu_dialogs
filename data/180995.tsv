2006-06-20T05:56:00.000Z	Cntryboy		I just ran xpsp2 on my windows 160gig drive so I could get all my unallowcated space. I'm back into linux and mounted my /media/windows hd again, but it doesn't appear in the panel nor on desktop. Anyone know why?
2006-06-20T05:58:00.000Z	Cntryboy		Yes, I can see my windows hd both partitions, hda1 of windows was still mounted. Since I changed the 2nd partition on windows, linux didn't reconize it because it was hda5, well I changed it to hda2 since I repartitioned it because thats what it's listed as now.. The hda2 is mounted, but not coming up on desktop or panel.. but it is mounted yes
