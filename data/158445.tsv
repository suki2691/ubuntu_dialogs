2010-08-12T13:10:00.000Z	Guest33290		Hi, am locked out of ubuntu - can login as root in rescue mode & from there can make / edit / delete users & passwords ( none of which work in `production mode')   but thats it -  can anyone pls help suggest something?
2010-08-12T13:11:00.000Z	Guest33290		nope - done that even changed root's passwd - which was not accepted in either real or rescue mode
