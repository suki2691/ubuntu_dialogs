2010-04-07T09:33:00.000Z	rshakin		and also i am having issues with the radeon driver... it seemes like the opensource implemmintation of the driver is kinda laggy for X1200 chipset for ATi
2010-04-07T09:34:00.000Z	maginot	rshakin	use the official driver provided by ATI
2010-04-07T09:34:00.000Z	rshakin	maginot	for some reason when i install that one it says the card is not found and when i use the wizzard to look for the hardware restricted drivers it does not prompt me like on my laptop
2010-04-07T09:36:00.000Z	maginot	rshakin	well, I'm not a ATI user, so can't help you any further then recommending using the driver provided by ATI, all I can say is that nvidia drivers are a perfect fit
