2008-01-29T08:48:00.000Z	DCorleone		Hey now.  Got a weird problem.  I can't get CTRL-ALT-F1 to a console anymore.  F2, F3, etc either.
2008-01-29T08:50:00.000Z	DCorleone		Anybody know aht's up with that?  On occasion I have need to kill gdm and x instead of restarting them, and I need that console access to be able to do that.  What's up?
2008-01-29T08:51:00.000Z	danbhfive	DCorleone	maybe this is your problem, no idea though: https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/hardy/+source/linux/+bug/129910
