2011-11-20T22:06:00.000Z	zykotick9	freko	are you getting a firmware missing message on boot?  "dmesg | grep firmware" for the log
2011-11-20T22:08:00.000Z	zykotick9	freko	none at all?  so that would mean both nothing missing or nothing loaded?
2011-11-20T22:11:00.000Z	freko	zykotick9	how can i load this fw?
2011-11-20T22:12:00.000Z	zykotick9	freko	i don't think the kernel is even looking for firmware (based on the non-output from dmesg)
