2005-06-14T14:14:00.000Z	justin	ceu	dunno about rsync, but bittorrent can fix the file for you too
2005-06-14T14:15:00.000Z	justin	ceu	I think as long as the bytes aren't shifted over.. I think bittorrent just redownloads chunks, so if you somehow were missing the first byte it would still download the whole thing :-)
