But in my previous installs Ive encountered some probs when actually running and trying to get optimized drivers for my graphics card as well getting my NTFS partition to work properly when in linux. I cant reach the files. So I wonder if anyone knows why it is so?

2006-11-28T09:07:00.000Z	eltese	soundray	okay. And what is fuse? :)
