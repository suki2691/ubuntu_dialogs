2005-11-28T12:50:00.000Z	NoUse	Zedugh	they aren't you have to highlight a section of audio to use them
2005-11-28T12:52:00.000Z	Zedugh	NoUse	thanks, I'll try that
2005-11-28T13:01:00.000Z	Zedugh	NoUse	thanks again, they work as you said, but IMO bad UI for the other (LADSPA, etc) plugins not to be "greyed out" when there is no selection. Maybe they can be selected as a real-time effect during recording? I'll try that. If so, then that's ok, ie. how it works, but documentation should say something.
