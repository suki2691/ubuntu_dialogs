2009-11-23T21:58:00.000Z	jocco	Guest44980	I use download helper, then just watch videos in VLC, Flash in firefox is broken
2009-11-23T21:59:00.000Z	jocco	Guest44980	get VLC and all the non-free codecs and you will be fine, the GNU codecs are not really verry good yet
2009-11-23T22:02:00.000Z	jocco	Guest44980	yes always do a clean install, making a seperate /home partition is a good idea too keep data safe when experementing... I have 2 linux, and 2 windows on this system
