2008-03-07T21:24:00.000Z	_ndlovu		hi. is it possible to start a program running through ssh that will continue running after I disconnect?
2008-03-07T21:24:00.000Z	utb0t	_ndlovu	or maybe nohup
2008-03-07T21:26:00.000Z	utb0t	_ndlovu	ssh <user>@<host> nohup <command>
2008-03-07T21:27:00.000Z	_ndlovu	utb0t	that option looks simplest, thanks
