2011-09-19T03:49:00.000Z	Polah	Gnome232fanonly	you aren't forced to use only Unity past 11.04.
2011-09-19T03:49:00.000Z	Polah	Gnome232fanonly	well seeing as GNOME2 is no longer officially under development, you can depend on an unofficial fork or learn to like another environment.
2011-09-19T03:52:00.000Z	Polah	Gnome232fanonly	everything is going to GNOME3. GNOME2 is no longer under development and will quickly become outdated.
