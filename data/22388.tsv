2011-01-05T23:18:00.000Z	GeekSquid	Visuex	so ubuntuone
2011-01-05T23:19:00.000Z	Visuex	GeekSquid	yes that is an option as well and for him that would work but for me I am stuck with using windows for crap like Photoshop so I use dropbox to sync overall OSs
2011-01-05T23:20:00.000Z	GeekSquid	Visuex	ubuntuone now has a windows client in beta
