2007-10-02T05:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	vmlinuz1	are you wanting to compile a new kernel... if you update your kernel, there should be an entry in grub for it.
2007-10-02T05:38:00.000Z	vmlinuz1	IndyGunFreak	no, i just have to add acpi=off
2007-10-02T05:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	vmlinuz1	so you just want to make it where the current kernel just loads with acpi off?
