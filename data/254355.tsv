2005-01-06T15:24:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	Karnaugh	what if i set "auto" in /etc/fstab ?
2005-01-06T15:25:00.000Z	Karnaugh	da_bon_bon	well its going to try get a file system off the device to mount it, how is it going to do that without a disk
2005-01-06T15:26:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	Karnaugh	ok. but how do i do this -> i insert the cd, and it gets automatically mounted ?
