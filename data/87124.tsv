2008-06-22T20:47:00.000Z	Dusk_		I have a wireless problem. i have rt73usb drivers and Ubuntu 8.04 has recognized the wireless card automaticly. But it doesn't work full speed. I have a 1mbit connection but it only downloads with 50kb/s. I used many other sites and many other servers in Synaptic. I have also Windows Vista on other partition and wireless works perfectly
