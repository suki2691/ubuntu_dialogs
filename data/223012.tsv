2012-03-18T15:27:00.000Z	Phreak		hi, does anyone here have experience in setting up a sage math server on ubuntu 11.10 ?
2012-03-18T15:28:00.000Z	Phreak		when running the server i cant access it on port 8000 although it is running on port 8000
2012-03-18T15:29:00.000Z	Phreak		is there a default install firewall blocking port 8000 ?
2012-03-18T15:29:00.000Z	Rug	Phreak	no
