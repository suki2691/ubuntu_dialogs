2007-08-07T14:27:00.000Z	XiXaQ		how do I install a theme globally? I've unpacked one to /usr/share/themes, but it isn't available. What else do I need to do?
2007-08-07T14:28:00.000Z	Busata	XiXaQ	if it's a tar.gz file, I think you can just drag it to the theme config tool
2007-08-07T14:31:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Busata	but will that make it available to all users?
2007-08-07T14:31:00.000Z	Busata	XiXaQ	not sure, doubting it
