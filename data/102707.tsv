2011-01-28T10:22:00.000Z	rww	leapy0yo	LibreOffice is a fork of OpenOffice.org that has the support of a large amount of the OpenOffice community. Ubuntu's been using the set of patches that make up most of LibreOffice's changes for a long time anyway, so us replacing OO with LO in Ubuntu makes a lot of sense.
