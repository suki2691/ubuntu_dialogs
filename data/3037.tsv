2012-05-16T18:18:00.000Z	sunbird		hey folks. i need to nuke my evolution user files in 12.04 because i can't delete any messages (program freezes). i've tried removing the folder in .config/ and .cache and .local but it still has my account setup on startup.
2012-05-16T18:18:00.000Z	sunbird		(used to just delete ~/.evolution but they moved the files in 12.04)

2012-05-16T18:22:00.000Z	sunbird	yandex8932	that will show me the files installed by the package. i'm looking for the config files for my user.
