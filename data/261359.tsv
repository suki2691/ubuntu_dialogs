2005-05-03T12:25:00.000Z	njs12345	bluefoxicy	not currently
2005-05-03T12:26:00.000Z	njs12345	bluefoxicy	try System->Administration->Networking though
2005-05-03T12:27:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	njs12345	 I can just use ifconfig but :/ It's hard to pitch Linux when it's like "you have to do some ass like go into Admin->stuff->system->networking click the interface add your IP and do stuff. . ." rather than "Click the Wireless Networks applet here and it'll list all your wireless cards and let you plug into any network they find"
