2010-10-04T18:25:00.000Z	latagore		I installed a new kernel version and is broken for my computer; it seems the old kernel version is still on my computer. How do I remove the new kernel version and hold the new one?
2010-10-04T18:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	latagore	depends on how you installed the new version
2010-10-04T18:27:00.000Z	latagore	erUSUL	I don't know to be honest ;P I assume I did it by auto update; didn't do it manually
2010-10-04T18:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	latagore	well if it is a security update you should try to use the new kernel ... how exactly did it broke the system?
