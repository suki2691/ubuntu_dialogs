2006-08-24T08:52:00.000Z	Berto		how does ubuntu fit in one 700mb iso??   i'm used to 3 or 4 cds from mandriva....  is there way more downloading later?
2006-08-24T08:53:00.000Z	nich0s	Berto	I have installed Ubuntu 5 times on different systems on a satellite connection and I really don't think that it is that bad.
2006-08-24T08:54:00.000Z	Berto	nich0s	i have a plenty fine connection, i'm just wondering if this 700mb cd is everything or does it download way more?
2006-08-24T08:55:00.000Z	nich0s	Berto	You and I both know that there is no possible way to fit everything that you want on to a single 700mb CD (unless you are a minimalist). There is enough on the 700mb CD to get you up and running, but there is an additional download of under 200mb. :P
