2008-10-16T00:53:00.000Z	Crusader_Tech		Could someone tell me why my Ubuntu desktop will play music on the hard drive, but when I try to play off of a flash drive, totem just opens, then closes.
2008-10-16T00:54:00.000Z	mongolai	Crusader_Tech	can you access other files on the flash drive?
2008-10-16T00:54:00.000Z	Crusader_Tech	mongolai	Yes, I can open documents, and whatnot.  It's also not limited to any particular flash drive.
2008-10-16T00:55:00.000Z	Crusader_Tech	mongolai	well, I take it back.  Now it wont play an MP3 off of my desktop either.  one sec while I check my codecs
