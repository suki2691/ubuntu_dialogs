2009-01-19T11:26:00.000Z	dmsuperman		I'm getting _terrible_ performance with flash, both 32bit and 64bit (now running 64bit OS). The video gets very laggy, and firefox locks up during play back
2009-01-19T11:26:00.000Z	atm0sph	dmsuperman	which flash are you using?  The legit adobe one?
2009-01-19T11:26:00.000Z	dmsuperman	atm0sph	Yeah
2009-01-19T11:27:00.000Z	atm0sph	dmsuperman	hmm I'm not sure then.. sorry :(
