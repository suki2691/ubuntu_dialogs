2008-05-21T11:55:00.000Z	genii	proqesi	lspci -vv               and you might want to pipe it to a file and open it up after, a lot of info in it

2008-05-21T11:56:00.000Z	genii	proqesi	You might want something like:  sudo lspci -vv | ~/Desktop/systeminfo.txt                      then use a text editor to open that file on your desktop
