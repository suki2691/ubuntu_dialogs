2006-07-18T14:51:00.000Z	steve_		hey all.  I'm compiling an application.  I was wondering how you can get a list of required libraries.  Something better than running configure, having it stop and tell you what you need, get it, run it again, and it stops again, etc.  ?

2006-07-18T14:53:00.000Z	steve_	verbose	having the executable requires already building it.  :P
2006-07-18T14:53:00.000Z	verbose	steve_	i know :P
