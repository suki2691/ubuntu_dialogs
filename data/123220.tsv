2007-12-06T06:53:00.000Z	meoblast001		im having a problem.... when i double click EXE files, GNOME tries to open them in Gedit.... I tried everything i know possible to switch it to using WINE but it won't work.... can someone help me?
2007-12-06T06:54:00.000Z	Benalex	meoblast001	you can't run exe file from shell, you have to open wine file manager then dbl click exe files
2007-12-06T06:55:00.000Z	meoblast001	Benalex	i can open them with "wine <file>"
