2005-04-06T09:09:00.000Z	megabyte405	avdd	well, I think so.  You mean Computer, System Configuration, Users and Groups?  I presume GNOME 2.8 needs PAM because that's one of the reasons PatV is most likely dropping it from slack 11...
2005-04-06T09:12:00.000Z	avdd	megabyte405	I mean, how does a non-administrator change his password without opening a terminal?
2005-04-06T09:13:00.000Z	megabyte405	avdd	Yep.  Users and Groups can do that.  Just need your own password for the sudo.
