2007-11-25T16:36:00.000Z	Aaron_Mason		it was on fat32 but then it died cos the file got too big so I moved it to an NTFS partition, and it died there too
2007-11-25T16:37:00.000Z	krimx	Aaron_Mason	so use ext3?
2007-11-25T16:41:00.000Z	Aaron_Mason	krimx	- i was using ext3 under coLinux but the kernel supplied doesn't have large file support
