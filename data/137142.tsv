2007-04-23T16:24:00.000Z	chernobylrpgfree	duke3z	yes, but a minor one - does the screen slide when you move the mouse to the edge?
2007-04-23T16:26:00.000Z	chernobylrpgfree	duke3z	i wouldn't know about that, most msi files come with some installer exe (like installshield) which work fine under wine
2007-04-23T06:27:00.000Z	chernobylrpgfree	duke3z	wine is OK under feisty for me.  0.9.35.
