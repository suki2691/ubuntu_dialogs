2006-07-15T16:08:00.000Z	TyeDye		i've installed quake4 and can run the game if I click on the file and tell it to run but I can't run it from the command line,it says bash: quake4: command not found,any ideas why I can't run from terminal??
2006-07-15T16:09:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	TyeDye	because it isn't in your path
