2008-02-20T17:34:00.000Z	r3m0t		I have a crossplatform problem. I'm running Ubuntu and I have a 27G compressed ntfsclone image. I don't have enough space to store the decompressed image even if I delete the compressed version. I want to transfer all the files in the image to a new Macbook Pro. can anybody help?
2008-02-20T17:35:00.000Z	meekolope	r3m0t	how much space do u have on ure macbook? are u trying to clone the image to ure macbook and run xp on it? or just move the files to it in the form of a image file?
2008-02-20T17:37:00.000Z	r3m0t	meekolope	enough space to store the whole thing. what I want is, e.g., can I run ntfsclone on OS X to change the format of the image, can I run ntfsclone on the MBP running a Live CD which writes to the HFS+ partition... or what?
2008-02-20T17:38:00.000Z	meekolope	r3m0t	im not sure about that, if it were a matter of just figuring out a transfer I would have some ideas
