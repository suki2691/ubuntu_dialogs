I installed Ubuntu on a laptop and then later installed Windows XP on a seperate partition and it overwrote the boot loader.. what is the easiest way for me to restore it so I can boot linux again? I don't have my Ubuntu CD at the moment either so I can't use it to get into linux.. is there some other method I can use to start up linux so I can restore GRUB?
