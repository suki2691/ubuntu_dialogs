2007-09-16T12:23:00.000Z	zanth		hello, I am having some issues with sata drives automounting and the fstab configurations
2007-09-16T12:23:00.000Z	zanth		my problem is that if I config /etc/fstab it seems on boot up, the sata drives might not be mounted on the same device each time
2007-09-16T12:24:00.000Z	zanth		so sda1 might be sdb1 next time and then the moutn points get all screwed up
2007-09-16T12:24:00.000Z	dxdt	zanth	that is really weird.
