2008-03-05T06:28:00.000Z	RequinB4		I'm trying to get virtualbox to work, it says i need the modules package, which is already installed, and to run '/etc/init.d/vboxdrv start' as root'.  I do so, and it complaines that it can't find module vboxdrv.
2008-03-05T06:29:00.000Z	l815	RequinB4	did you try a clean install and adding yourself to the group?
2008-03-05T06:30:00.000Z	RequinB4	l815	i installed using add/remove, then created the machine (saying i will get error on start) then added myself and root to the group
2008-03-05T06:30:00.000Z	l815	RequinB4	oh ok, sorry i can't help further. The only problem i got was adding myself to the group
