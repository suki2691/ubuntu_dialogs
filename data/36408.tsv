2010-03-01T22:01:00.000Z	GeekSquid	dimuls	probably not, but I will tell you that HAL is probably broken in 9.10 on your system and broke when you upgraded, sometimes upgrading is not the best choice as it tends to break things, you could try to 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure hal'  .. no promises weather it will work
