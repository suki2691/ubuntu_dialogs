2010-06-26T04:59:00.000Z	colk	aretrfre34	if the compiler isdefined by $CC youd just need to export CC=arm-linux-gcc
2010-06-26T05:00:00.000Z	aretrfre34	colk	no there is CC = gcc and CXX = g++ in each file
2010-06-26T05:13:00.000Z	aretrfre34	colk	if i export them configure fails with cannot run C tests error
