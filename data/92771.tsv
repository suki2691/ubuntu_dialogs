2008-05-10T23:33:00.000Z	Aalvarez		Hello, I've just recently installed Hardy on my home system (new user transitioning from XP). All is going well, but my wife doesn't like the built in media players. She's very used to Windows Media Player and likes the way it integrates all the playlists and such..... what is my best option under Ubuntu for something that is going to mimic media player and it's functionality?
