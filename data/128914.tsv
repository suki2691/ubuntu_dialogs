2007-09-14T08:53:00.000Z	Kindredgarou		im kinda new to ubuntu as in im going to be migrating to it on my new machine and was after some general advice on things like AV and firewalls etc
2007-09-14T08:54:00.000Z	Kindredgarou		i have read some of the forums and it says that a firewall is not neccsessary but is available is this still accurate?
