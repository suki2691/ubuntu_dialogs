2012-07-12T23:00:00.000Z	crazySDman		So now that I've live booted off the SD card into RAM, I need to know if I can write to the SD card
2012-07-12T23:00:00.000Z	wols	crazySDman	"mount" will tell you
2012-07-12T23:02:00.000Z	crazySDman	wols	I think I found the right lines in the mount output; lemme paste, one sec
2012-07-12T23:05:00.000Z	crazySDman	wols	Here is the output of mount that I think pertains to the SD card and whether I can write to it from the live boot or not: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1088524/
