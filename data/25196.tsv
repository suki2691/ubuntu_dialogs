2012-06-17T21:55:00.000Z	Matthewlawson3		I downloaded and installed the  codecs needed to run dvds and play mp3 etc, and now my Youtube videos in Chrome goes black on fullscreen. Can someone help me resolve this? I assume its a conflict between Chrome flash and the flash installed in the codec pack. Fullscreen worked fine before
