2012-10-12T02:03:00.000Z	fivre		I've added a PPA with a new version of something, but running update and dist-upgrade per https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA/InstallingSoftware doesn't update the package
2012-10-12T02:04:00.000Z	fivre		it's someone else's
2012-10-12T02:04:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	fivre	Did you run a update first?
2012-10-12T02:05:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	fivre	Did you look close at the MYSTERY package to see that it was there for your distro?
