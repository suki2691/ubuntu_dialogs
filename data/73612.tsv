2009-04-07T22:34:00.000Z	camelreef		will 9.04 not be able to support iPhone/iPod Touch outside of GTKpod because of the move from Amarok 1.4 to 2.0?
2009-04-07T22:35:00.000Z	zloog	camelreef	Is amarok dropping ipod support ???
2009-04-07T22:35:00.000Z	camelreef	zloog	not really, but the iPhone/iPod Touch is a special case
