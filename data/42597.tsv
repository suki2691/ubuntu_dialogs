2010-11-18T23:00:00.000Z	Milos_SD		I installed compiz 0.9.2 from Unity PPA, but I don't know how to start it. Fusion-icon doesn't work, and from Appearance -> Visual Effects it says it can't start it
2010-11-18T23:00:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Milos_SD	compiz --replace
2010-11-18T23:01:00.000Z	Milos_SD	aeon-ltd	that doesn't work :)
