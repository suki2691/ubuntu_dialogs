2012-03-24T23:08:00.000Z	v0lksman		anyone know how to update alternatives non-interactively?
2012-03-24T23:08:00.000Z	v0lksman		IE I want to set vi as the default editor but update-alternatives requires interaction...I just want to script it
2012-03-24T23:09:00.000Z	zykotic10	v0lksman	update-alternatives is system wide - once per-system would be fine
2012-03-24T23:10:00.000Z	v0lksman	zykotic10	I know but I have many systems... :)
