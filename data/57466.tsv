2009-05-12T21:53:00.000Z	vertix		if anybody can help me out with strange boot problem when kernel refuses to mount a perfectly clean partition in a correct device, join #boot please
2009-05-12T21:55:00.000Z	str	vertix	how are you sure that is the correct path to the device, and that the partition is OK?
2009-05-12T21:56:00.000Z	vertix	str	the path is correct cause i did a find from grub and it is correct partition (i have separate /boot partition)
2009-05-12T21:56:00.000Z	vertix	str	i know 100% that /dev/sb8 is the right partion, but the drives are being swapped around during boot and i don't know at which point
