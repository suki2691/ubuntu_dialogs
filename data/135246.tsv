2009-03-23T15:37:00.000Z	ziroday	SlimeyPete	7.04 is EOL
2009-03-23T15:41:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	ziroday	I know it's EOL, but you can still get packages for it
2009-03-23T15:42:00.000Z	ziroday	SlimeyPete	sure, but not through synaptic unless you add the old-releases archive. And downloading each pacakge individually from packages.u.c is impractical
