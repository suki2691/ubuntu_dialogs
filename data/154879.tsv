2006-12-12T07:50:00.000Z	msun		HELP! Brand new ubuntu installation.  I turn on the machine, and after seeing the ubuntu logo at the top of the screen and a few things loading at the bottom, the screen changes to a resolution that my monitor doesn't support!   So I hit CTRL-ALT-F1 and got a terminal.  What can I do now?
