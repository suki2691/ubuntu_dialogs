But think about other package sources: Because of good builds and good packages you have usually only ~one~ package for debian-based dists, and it works for all of them... But in RPM you got usually at least three versions (suse, redhat, mdk)
2007-01-20T10:17:00.000Z	LjL	PSIplus	that's not true at all. "optimized packages"? when? actually, the truth is that using a Debian package in Ubuntu, or vice versa, is very likely to break things, as is using, say, a Dapper package in Edgy or vice versa.
2007-01-20T10:19:00.000Z	PSIplus	LjL	I use many dapper packages here, never seen a problem about it... I use debian for many years now, and most problems were caused by people using auto-generated dependencies in "control", and therefor denieing packages to be installed on other plattforms than the build-system... But that's only stupidity and can be resolved with the editor of your choice...
