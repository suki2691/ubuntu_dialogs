These were previously ext3, and I promptly converted them to ext4 (tune2fs -O extents,uninit_bg,dir_index /dev/sda? followed by a fsck). I also gave the same treatment to / (from a live cd, naturally) and altered /etc/fstab so that all the partitions are mounted ext4. In /etc/fstab, the mount optio

My confusion arises from this: partition management tools (like parted) list / as an ext3 partition and the other 2 [correctly] as ext4 partitions. From what I have read, invoking tune2fs with the options listed above ought to _irreversibly_ convert the ext3 partition to ext4. So why does it still appear to parted

(For the record: "sudo mount" confirms that the partition has been mounted with the ext4 driver) While still on mount options, what are the defaults on ext4? What are the "best performance" options? What are the "keep your data real safe" mount options? I have Googled a bit - unsuccessfully. Thanks.
