2010-02-28T20:44:00.000Z	DrSp0ckk		Can I remove everything that comes with Ubuntu in terms of software and start from fresh? Or at least revert the system back to a freshly installed state?
2010-02-28T20:45:00.000Z	ikonia	DrSp0ckk	no
2010-02-28T20:45:00.000Z	DrSp0ckk	ikonia	So I would just have to reload the image on the VPS?
2010-02-28T20:45:00.000Z	ikonia	DrSp0ckk	if you want it back to %100 default, yes
