2011-08-25T00:16:00.000Z	Combatjuan		I built a new kernel using the wiki and the "old fashioned debian way".  When I boot with the new kernel it fails after a minute or so with "Gave up waiting for root device" claiming that /dev/disk/by-uuid/THE-UUID-OF-THE-DISK doesn't exist.  I don't think it's either of the usual suspects because the root and root_delay match working kernels.
2011-08-25T00:17:00.000Z	Combatjuan		If I cd to /dev/, there is no "disk" entry.  I've never understood what causes something to appear in /dev/ but that definitely seems like a bad sign.
