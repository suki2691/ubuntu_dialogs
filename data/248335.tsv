2005-08-22T10:32:00.000Z	jupiterste		If I have a list of names (say in a text file) and I want to create a folder for each name, is there an easy way to do it in linux?
2005-08-22T10:32:00.000Z	jupiterste		rather than mkdir manually, having to retype the names?
2005-08-22T10:33:00.000Z	jupiterste		xargs?
