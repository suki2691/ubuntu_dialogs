2010-09-24T07:23:00.000Z	slooksterpsv	MattTheComputerG	- then backup what data you need to either cds,dvds,another drive, etc. as well as configuration files (e.g. apache2 virtual host files) and then reformat, you will have to setup the services and that again though on Ubuntu Server as it will need to reinstall the programs
