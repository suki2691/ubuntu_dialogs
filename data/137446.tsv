2007-04-21T14:56:00.000Z	Libere		Upgraded from Edgy to Fiesty.  Fiesty has no net connection, can ping the local host but can't get anything else, grub lists 2.6.20-15 and 2.6.17-11.... if I try to boot into 2.6.17-11 the OS never loads, but the router sees me as connected.  Tried changing the networking config to match what the Live Cd's said when connected, but everytime I open network it re-screws it up.  Any ideas?
