2009-02-20T00:34:00.000Z	Slart	KDesk	not that you'd notice, no
2009-02-20T00:35:00.000Z	Slart	KDesk	go with 32 bit... you'll be running with the big herd.. things will be smoother and so on.. use 64 bit when you make a new install of ubuntu 11.04 or something =)
2009-02-20T00:36:00.000Z	Slart	KDesk	I run both.. I've tried both on the same machine.. I doubt I would be able to tell if I was running 32bit or 64bit
