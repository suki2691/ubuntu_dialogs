2009-01-16T08:39:00.000Z	rogermudd		Is there any reasonable option to create a "Shared Documents" folder where all users on a single machine can read, write and execute. I've had real difficulties doing this.

2009-01-16T08:41:00.000Z	rogermudd	runderwo	I've tried that, but it doesn't apply permissions to files dumped into that folder at a later date. Only to existing files.
