2006-10-13T07:33:00.000Z	timalot	Juhaz	fair enough ... but whats the point of a password in normal mode if u can boot into recovery mode with a password

2006-10-13T07:45:00.000Z	timalot	Juhaz	you are probably right.... anyway u need to have passwords setup for network authentication etc.... but its just creepy to be able to boot straight to a root console
