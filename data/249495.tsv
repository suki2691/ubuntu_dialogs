2006-10-05T11:10:00.000Z	EddyDean		Hello everyone, I have installed the NVIDIA drivers for my graphic card today, and everything seemed to work well, but now I rebooted and it says I'm unable to load the graphic environment (X server). I am only able to use the CLI now. Trying to run GDM (GNOME) fails. Is there anything I can do except for reinstalling Ubuntu (Again...)
2006-10-05T11:11:00.000Z	EddyDean		Anyone?
2006-10-05T11:11:00.000Z	EddyDean		Meh... I'll just reinstall... Not much data on there anyway...
