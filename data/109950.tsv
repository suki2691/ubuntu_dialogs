2010-07-26T02:30:00.000Z	iskin		I just got a new monitor, native resolution '1920 x 1080', but my max available resolution is '1680x1050'. Using 10.04, and I can't find xorg.conf. How do I get '1920 x 1080'?
2010-07-26T02:31:00.000Z	soreau	iskin	Which graphics driver are you using?
2010-07-26T02:32:00.000Z	iskin	soreau	I'm using a HD4850 with the ATI drivers.
