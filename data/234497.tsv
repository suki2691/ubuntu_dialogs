2005-10-19T09:14:00.000Z	dooglus	chmuri	but it's a really bad idea
2005-10-19T09:14:00.000Z	dooglus	chmuri	what?  you asked "chmuri> ok THX but how to login as root to snome??" - I answered
2005-10-19T09:16:00.000Z	dooglus	chmuri	say reason it's a bad idea to run windows as 'administrator'.  if your windows session gets taken over, they've got root straight away.  and if you type something stupid by mistake your whole system's dead instead of just your user account
