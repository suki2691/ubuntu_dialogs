2010-10-18T00:52:00.000Z	SteelPangolin	Swian	handbrake
2010-10-18T00:53:00.000Z	SteelPangolin	Swian	also, DVDs are already in a kind of MPEG format (MPEG-2 with some junk bolted on)
2010-10-18T00:53:00.000Z	SteelPangolin	Swian	you might want to look into .mkv, which handbrake also does, if you want to capture menus, subtitles, etc.
