2008-03-06T08:06:00.000Z	NinjaPlimsoles	NobleArc	zeroing one with 4 passes takes longer :P
2008-03-06T08:08:00.000Z	NinjaPlimsoles	NobleArc	why defrag something thats being partitioned? the files wont be scattered if they dont exist ;)
2008-03-06T08:09:00.000Z	NinjaPlimsoles	NobleArc	aaaaaah, yeah wait for defrag to finish or you might get files caught in the deflate
