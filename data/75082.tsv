2008-11-19T03:25:00.000Z	Michael		Is there a way I can install Ubuntu 8 to an "iPod" and have a computer boot from said "iPod", but also allow the "iPod" to work as a music player while not plugged into a computer?
2008-11-19T03:25:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	Michael	is the player attaching as mass storage device, like a memory stick?
2008-11-19T03:27:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	Michael	if the computer supports booting from usb. using syslinux for the stick works
2008-11-19T03:28:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	Michael	there is a page in the wiki, on how to make your USb flash drive bootable. follow one of these guides
