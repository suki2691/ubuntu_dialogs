2006-03-05T14:23:00.000Z	LjL	Gargoyle	i can't think of something. except usernames and passwords of course ;)
2006-03-05T14:24:00.000Z	Gargoyle	LjL	They are OK, its just to quickly make another machine in my virtual cluster
2006-03-05T14:36:00.000Z	LjL	Gargoyle	i think you won't even be allowed to do that
