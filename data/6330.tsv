2012-01-22T13:03:00.000Z	earlybirdd	cis	well i just wanted to know how why so many people use it? especially nerds? is there some sort of package system that I dont get...or is windows that much of a fuck up?
2012-01-22T13:08:00.000Z	earlybirdd		Would there be security flaws via windows If i setup Ubuntu in a VM with a web server?
