2012-02-16T03:47:00.000Z	Ariel88		Hi. I have a basic problem. I forgot the password, but # passwd says my account doesnt exist; and if i leave it, the unix password doesnt let me write anything.
2012-02-16T03:47:00.000Z	Ariel88		Any help please.
2012-02-16T03:48:00.000Z	Ariel88		I added that just for the "please" because of fearing it would sound unpolite. Sorry.
