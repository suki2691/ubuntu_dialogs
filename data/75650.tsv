2008-11-07T22:17:00.000Z	BrickHaus	Pelo	Oh.. so Ubuntu doesn't have a /boot/grub/grub.conf file? wow that's weird
2008-11-07T22:20:00.000Z	BrickHaus	Pelo	Wow.. that's really strange to me. Ok.. so I see why you suggested to do it at bootup grub prompt. Menu.lst is just a mirror or grub.conf but it's hidden or something. Kewl. I'm learning the Ubuntu way.. heh
2008-11-07T22:23:00.000Z	BrickHaus	Pelo	making changes to /boot/grub/menu.lst are for permanent changes and ones set at the Grub bootloader screen at bootup are only temporary?
