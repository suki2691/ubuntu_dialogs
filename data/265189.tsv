2004-12-15T10:30:00.000Z	sladen	AElfwine	 sudo dpkg -i ./foo.deb  The real question is why you needed to download it separately.  If there's something missing, it would be better to make sure it gets into the main Ubuntu main/universe achives
2004-12-15T10:31:00.000Z	AElfwine	sladen	: is amsn in universe source so ?
2004-12-15T10:33:00.000Z	sladen	AElfwine	there's about 15,000 packages in Debian and Unubtu universe.  I believe that is one of them
