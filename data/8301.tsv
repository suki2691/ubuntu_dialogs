2011-10-28T00:36:00.000Z	Chraz_Ritt	mangochutney	i'm a bit curious about why you asked me about distros
2011-10-28T00:39:00.000Z	Chraz_Ritt	mangochutney	actually the plan is to multi-boot with 2 distros of linux, while keeping win7
2011-10-28T01:23:00.000Z	Chraz_Ritt	mangochutney	now days some have the space, and some don't, i think it mostly depends on the size of the lappy, and the price range of it.
