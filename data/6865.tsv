2011-12-30T04:43:00.000Z	ardian		Hello I need some help I want to Install JAVA SE on ubuntu anyone that can help there are only rpm and tar.gz on oracles java site
2011-12-30T04:44:00.000Z	ardian		I am on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
2011-12-30T04:45:00.000Z	metaspike	ardian	you can extract the tar.gz and run the installer herein. oracles java is unfortunately no longer supported due to bad licencing
2011-12-30T04:46:00.000Z	ardian	metaspike	I tried to do that but it promts me to this: There is only one alternative in link group java: /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/bin/java
