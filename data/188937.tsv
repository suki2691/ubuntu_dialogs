2006-07-01T09:08:00.000Z	Cyor		Ok I am using my wireless card to get net connection from my router (connected to my dsl modem) and I want to use my hard-wired card to share the net connection this PC has with others around it through a hub...
2006-07-01T09:08:00.000Z	Cyor		What I was going to try was moving my routers IP from 192.168.0.1 to something else so I could bridge the two connections on my pc and enable internet connect sharing (which wants to use 192.168.0.1) - BUT MY modem seems to refuse to talk to anything that is -not- 192.168.0.1, so I cannot do this...
