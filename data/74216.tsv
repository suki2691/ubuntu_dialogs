2009-07-19T05:39:00.000Z	jlaroche		hello everyone. I am running winxp and ubuntu in a dualboot environment. My xp installation got severely disrupted by a virus and I had to reinstall windows. Unfortunately my grub boot loader does not come up anymore (windows starts up when I turn on the laptop). Could anyone help me get it back?
