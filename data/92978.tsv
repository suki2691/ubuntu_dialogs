2008-06-02T22:32:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jedimind	yes, but I use xchat-gnome because it looks nicer
2008-06-02T22:33:00.000Z	jedimind	jimcooncat	i just dislike the fact that i cant get a user list on the right hand side w/ the gnome version - its the only thing and the reason i went back to xchat
2008-06-02T22:34:00.000Z	jimcooncat	jedimind	yes, it's not flexible.
