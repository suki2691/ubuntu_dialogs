2009-03-09T20:24:00.000Z	The-Compiler		Hi could anyone help me with a problem regarding locale and an Ubuntu mini on a server? I got error messages like the ones you can see at http://forum.ubuntuusers.de/topic/seltsame-fehlermeldungen-betr.-locale/ in the grey field
2009-03-09T20:24:00.000Z	The-Compiler		I get errors like "/usr/bin/mandb: can't set the locale; make sure $LC_* and $LANG are correct" etc. all the time
2009-03-09T20:25:00.000Z	The-Compiler		and "locale" wasn't installed before by the way (sorry this isn't everything in a line)
2009-03-09T20:26:00.000Z	Pici	The-Compiler	Install language-pack-en  (or -de)
