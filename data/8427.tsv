2011-10-22T19:56:00.000Z	scotty^	b1gtuna	- what about in dmesg?
2011-10-22T19:57:00.000Z	b1gtuna	scotty^	hmmm haven't checked. I don't know how to read dmesg. Doesn't it get deleted and restarted whenever I restart the computer?
2011-10-22T19:59:00.000Z	scotty^	b1gtuna	- it's in /var/log - I'm not sure if its deleted on restart.
