2005-03-16T11:35:00.000Z	andrewski		can anyone recommend a good ogg encoder frontend?  (i've been using grip for mp3s.)
2005-03-16T11:36:00.000Z	arbeck	andrewski	grip works fine for ogg...
2005-03-16T11:37:00.000Z	arbeck	andrewski	sound-juicer really can't do enough... i needed to rip to flac, and then convert to mp3, grip can do things like that sound-juicer can't
2005-03-16T11:38:00.000Z	andrewski	arbeck	yeah, i don't like sound-juicer, just wanted to see if there was anything else.
