2010-05-19T04:56:00.000Z	Woosta	onetinsoldier	I'll run apt from the cmd line and get the errors for you
2010-05-19T04:57:00.000Z	Typos_King	Woosta	  you can always just do a -> sudo apt-get -d install PACKAGE;  to just get the .deb files, and then install manually yourself from /var/cache/apt/archives :)
