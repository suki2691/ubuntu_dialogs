2009-04-09T12:36:00.000Z	Ruut		when I try to install ubuntu (8.04), right after seecting the language of the installation, the monitor becomes black and nothing happens..
2009-04-09T12:36:00.000Z	Ruut		I suspect I have some problem with the "graphical" installation, how can I use a text-base instalation?
2009-04-09T12:37:00.000Z	Flannel	Ruut	Get the alternate CD
2009-04-09T12:37:00.000Z	Flannel	Ruut	then you have the textbased installer.  Desktop is a GUI installer, Alternate is debian-installer.
