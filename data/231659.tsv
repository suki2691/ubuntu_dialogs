2005-06-23T06:33:00.000Z	HillTop		Has Ubuntu started mailing the Hoary CD packages? I know it was a while after Warty released that it was mailed. Thanks

2005-06-23T06:34:00.000Z	seth_k	HillTop	people who didn't get Warty get Hoary first
2005-06-23T06:34:00.000Z	seth_k	HillTop	however I heard yesterday that some people who had Warty just received Hoary, so shouldn't be long :)
