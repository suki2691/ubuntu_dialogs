2010-01-01T08:35:00.000Z	webbb82		i just got a new laptop and it came with windows 7 , im thinking of installling ubuntu onto my external hard drive and run it that way  what about wubi install would that be a better way than installing on external hd ??
2010-01-01T08:36:00.000Z	webbb82		if i go the external hd rout will it act just like a normal hard drive install i can save files and download and it saves?
