2007-08-12T08:38:00.000Z	exs		can someone please help me build gparted with all the required libraries, so I can install them on another ubuntu machine that has no internet access. I've been trying to use apt-zip but no help - as the tutorial is god-awful and it doesn't even work. I've tried using a .deb package from gnome partition site, but even that doesn't work. I need lots of libraries and the other machine doesn't have them. if you can help at all, that would be very,
