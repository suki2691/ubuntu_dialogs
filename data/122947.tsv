2008-08-30T13:25:00.000Z	mindrape	Kai_wp	- you using KDE or Gnome?  If so it might make sense to ask in those respective channels.
2008-08-30T13:25:00.000Z	mindrape	Kai_wp	- this is more of an operating system support channel, not so much around specific configuration issues around daemons or window managers.. ie; if you want mysql or apache help go to those channels.
