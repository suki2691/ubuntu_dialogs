2005-12-27T16:51:00.000Z	ossie		can anyone point me to the nearsest place to get some support compiling new kernel???
2005-12-27T16:51:00.000Z	cmatheson	ossie	what do you want to compile a new kernel for?
2005-12-27T16:57:00.000Z	cmatheson	ossie	just install the kernel-headers for whatever kernel your using and go from there
2005-12-27T16:57:00.000Z	cmatheson	ossie	they're headers... you don't compile them
