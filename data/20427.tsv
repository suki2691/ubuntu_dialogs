2011-01-16T07:41:00.000Z	ether-boy		is the SWAP partition necessary on an intel core2duo 2.1 Ghz, 3GB DDR2 RAM and a 5400rpm HDD???
2011-01-16T07:42:00.000Z	edbian	ether-boy	A swap partition is never NECESSARY.  But with a system like that it will be rarely used
2011-01-16T07:42:00.000Z	edbian	ether-boy	It will be used if you try to hibernate to disk
2011-01-16T07:45:00.000Z	ether-boy	edbian	so does that mean system can't hibernate if there's no swap partition because I haven't made one and there is no Hibernate option as such in the shutdown menu???
