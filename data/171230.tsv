2006-08-12T11:12:00.000Z	rob86_		does anyone know how some people get "# $Id: CHANGELOG 218 2006-08-11 14:40:20Z garrett $ #" to go at the top of their files whenever it's changed?
2006-08-12T11:13:00.000Z	digitallotus	rob86_	you've got to use a version control system like cvs or subversion
2006-08-12T11:13:00.000Z	digitallotus		at least, if you want the process to be automated
2006-08-12T11:14:00.000Z	rob86_	digitallotus	thanks.. I have subversion but am still learning how to use it
