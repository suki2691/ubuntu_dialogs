2009-05-17T05:07:00.000Z	dink		I installed 9.04 on two drives on my machine, I can boot from both and run them but I want to trash one (because I don't need it) and connect up another drive to transfer data, but when I remove any drive I get grub 21 or 22 errors.  How should I go about fixing?

2009-05-17T05:11:00.000Z	dink	Dr_Willis	I just installed +built a couple of bin and installed some stuff, would it be less effort to just format both drives reinstall?
