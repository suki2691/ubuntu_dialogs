2006-12-13T08:58:00.000Z	chrisjw		I want to share a folder across my network so my pda can map the network share, on windows I can do this easily, I've read up a little bit and seen that I'd have to use samba, isn't there many security vulnerabilities with this?

2006-12-13T09:06:00.000Z	nothlit	chrisjw	sudo aptitude purge samba
