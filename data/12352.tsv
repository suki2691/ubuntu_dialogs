(just an internal question, I know it's the Unix "networking" standard, so your answer meats the political-correctness test, but it's PITA in many ways, especially if you do not have a common administration domain)

2011-10-06T09:37:00.000Z	yacc	zykotick9	yeah, but for a long time (good question if it still applies), mount a SMB share and you get decent performance. Mount NFS, welcome to admin hell to make it perform ;)
2011-11-16T22:07:00.000Z	zykotick9	yacc	don't expect "great" performance from a USB install
