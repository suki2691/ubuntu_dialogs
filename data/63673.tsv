2009-03-10T01:42:00.000Z	henryC		anybody know of a navicat-like (but free) tool that will run on Ubuntu?
2009-03-10T01:43:00.000Z	Hans-Martin	henryC	have you tried phpmyadmin?
2009-03-10T01:44:00.000Z	henryC	Hans-Martin	sure I've used phpmyadmin but it's not as nice and as fast as Navicat...
2009-03-10T01:44:00.000Z	Hans-Martin	henryC	I must admit I never used Navicat nor did I look at screenshots until now...
