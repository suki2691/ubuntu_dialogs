2005-05-12T16:28:00.000Z	rafael		I got a huge problem with Hoary. I just did a fresh install and I can't get sound to work. I can listen to myself on the mic, but I get no system/muziek working :(
2005-05-12T16:29:00.000Z	KingArthur	rafael	do you have any games installed?
2005-05-12T16:29:00.000Z	KingArthur		if so, try doing killall esd and open the game and see if sound works in it
2005-05-12T16:30:00.000Z	rafael	KingArthur	: no, I just did a fresh install
