2009-08-28T22:52:00.000Z	gabriel__		I have a little problem: I have to reinstall windows xp because of a virus and I have a partition for Ubuntu 9.04 bits, another partition for windows xp and an empty NTFS partition, I want to know how to get grub bootloader back after windows XP install
2009-08-28T22:53:00.000Z	Slart	gabriel__	that link "Lost grub after installing windows" should explain it all
2009-08-28T22:56:00.000Z	Slart	gabriel__	the easy way is in the link from ubottu
