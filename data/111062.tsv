2008-12-25T15:23:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ycy	No, you're confused. A "dist-upgrade" updates to another Ubuntu release entirely (e.g. Hardy to Intrepid), whereas "upgrade" will install all updates to the installed packages (including the kernel package) for the current Ubuntu version (distribution)
2008-12-25T15:23:00.000Z	ycy	IntuitiveNipple	well when i launch apt-get upgrade it says that my kernel-image packages are been kept back
2008-12-25T15:24:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	ycy	That's okay, maybe all the required bits aren't ready yet. the kernel is just another package as far as the package-management is concerned
