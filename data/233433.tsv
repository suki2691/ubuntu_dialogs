2005-09-09T09:08:00.000Z	Cashel		Hello... can anyone tell me how to ununstall something installed with alien -i ? also can I have glibc2.3.2 and 2.3.4 both installed? thanks...
2005-09-09T09:09:00.000Z	Cashel		no alien -i ... it was an rpm ....
2005-09-09T09:10:00.000Z	disasm	Cashel	alien rpm_name.rpm then dpkg -i rpm_name.deb
2005-09-09T09:17:00.000Z	disasm	Cashel	not by a long shot ;-)
