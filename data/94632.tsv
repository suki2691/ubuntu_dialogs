2009-05-07T21:25:00.000Z	{g}		Hey People! Just installed Ubuntu 9. If I remember correctly, Ubuntu comes with some annoying index-service enabled by default. Any idea where to disable it?
2009-05-07T21:26:00.000Z	tecky	{g}	why would you want to disable locate ?
2009-05-07T21:27:00.000Z	{g}	tecky	because i dont use it.
2009-05-07T21:27:00.000Z	{g}	tecky	and i only want data in places i want data. not somewhere within ubuntu.
