2007-10-12T16:00:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		Heya everyone. I tried, just earlier today, getting Ubuntu 7.10 RC running, and I had 2 problems. First try, was with an ATI X1600, and it was painfully sloooow, even with the latest official AMD ATI drivers. Next I tried with an older card, the nVidia 9200, and with nvidia-glx-new, it was pretty decently fast, but text consoles stopped working after X loaded. I tried nVidia's official driver, and it didn't get any better...

2007-10-12T16:01:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		Is this a problem just with 7.10, or would I experience the same trouble in 7.04 as well?
