2010-05-12T23:19:00.000Z	feel_good	KaiForce	 i dont understand what you mean. but if you wanna say that if the file broken: i will tell you that it can be open with audacious and i think the best player for broken files is vlc. but now it is not working on vlc.
2010-05-12T23:22:00.000Z	KaiForce	feel_good	 yeah, i'm assuming there is something wrong with the file.  Audacious may be more forgiving than VLC
2010-05-12T23:23:00.000Z	feel_good	KaiForce	 i try with my mp3 player sony is not working too here... :( i think the file is broken. but i wish i can open it with vlc too because i read that vlc is the best for broken files ...
