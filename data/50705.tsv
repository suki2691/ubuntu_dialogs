2009-08-11T21:32:00.000Z	differentreality		hey!  I have installed sims 3 on my laptop, which runs ubuntu 9.04, through playonlinux.  Installation was successful and game seems to start normally but I can only hear the sounds of the game, I am not seeing any video/image.  Plus at that point I am unable to swich to another app so I have to restart my lap.  Any ideas why I don't have video?  thanks in advance!

2009-08-11T21:34:00.000Z	differentreality	Megra_	 I'll try that tnx.. even though main prob is that I have no video.
