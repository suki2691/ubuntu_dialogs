2007-03-01T12:55:00.000Z	omegabeta		Question - I use envy to install my nvidia drivers, except it stops my lan from working and crashes X when they are installed, even though it recognises my card etc.. any ideas?
2007-03-01T12:56:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	omegabeta	I had the same problem. latest drivers don't play nice with some recent kernels I think.
2007-03-01T12:57:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	omegabeta	no idea, but it messed with mine too... IRQ sharing?
