2008-05-03T05:47:00.000Z	arehm		OK, i'm running ubuntu from an external usb drive now on my laptop, i'd like to pull the internal drive, pop the drive out of the usb box and put it inside my laptop. Physically i know it will work. My question is can ubuntu be "fixed" so i don't have to reinstall?
2008-05-03T05:47:00.000Z	Bodsda	arehm	when are you planning on 'breaking' ubuntu?
2008-05-03T05:48:00.000Z	arehm	Bodsda	ubuntu won't care about me moving what it's "mapped" as?
2008-05-03T05:48:00.000Z	Bodsda	arehm	what???? can u give more info about your problem please
