2006-10-18T14:27:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	ceerrff	i think you need the linux-source package for your kernel
2006-10-18T14:27:00.000Z	HumanPrototype	ceerrff	then you put it in /usr/src and link /usr/src/linux to it and there is a program for editing the options - i think there is a guide on the forums
