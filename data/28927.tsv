2011-05-08T23:09:00.000Z	Chertograd		Hey all ! I tried out both Xubuntu and Lubuntu and they are not even close to Ubuntu in terms of usability. It must be because of Gnome... :/ Any good alternatives then? I'd install Ubuntu in a heartbeat, but it just won't fit into the 4Gig HDD... :( I don't understand how 11.04 is so freggin' big. Wish I could just take away all the "extras" like Open Office/Libre Office or something. And whatever happened to the Netbook ed

2011-05-08T23:11:00.000Z	Chertograd	tensorpudding	I know and I'm not "complaining" about the size... It's just that my mom's future laptop will have only 4GB's of HDD space. Why is she buying that crap? Because she gets it for a few dozen euros.
