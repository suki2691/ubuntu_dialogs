2012-03-04T10:07:00.000Z	indystorm		why does ubuntu lag? Firefox will freeze for up to 30 seconds and the screen dims out on it. Any ideas!?
2012-03-04T10:07:00.000Z	L3top	indystorm	has to do with flash
2012-03-04T10:08:00.000Z	L3top	indystorm	you can try gnash... but many specific things wont work... like huludesktop etc
2012-03-04T10:09:00.000Z	L3top	indystorm	was just an example
