I have a intel CPU is this normal or shall i cancel the instalation ? I also have a slow connection so i donÂ´t like to wait several hours if i did something wrong from the beginning.

2009-11-05T15:45:00.000Z	[Kilowatt]	trijntje	I have 1 GB ram
2009-11-05T15:46:00.000Z	trijntje	[Kilowatt]	than you don't need 64 bit, if your pc is quite old i'm not even sure 64 bit will work on your pc
