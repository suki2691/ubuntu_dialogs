2011-10-06T20:36:00.000Z	theadmin	Omni_Lynk	You can't really do that. Another solution is to put "mplayer /path/to/your/sound.ogg" to startup apps, and remove "GNOME Startup Sound" from there

2011-10-06T20:36:00.000Z	theadmin	Omni_Lynk	Of course, I assume you do have mplayer installed. Actually, any other command-line based player will do (cvlc, mplayer, aplay...)
