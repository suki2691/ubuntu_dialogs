2010-10-16T17:46:00.000Z	adamror		Hi ubuntu, could someone help me?
2010-10-16T17:48:00.000Z	adamror		This is a really dumb question, I'm kinda new to linux so still learning. How do I change the user directory permissions. I'm trying 'chmod 777' in terminal but get 'operation not permitted'
2010-10-16T17:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	adamror	 what 'user' directory exactly?
