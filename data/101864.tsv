2010-02-27T06:13:00.000Z	Joeseph		Hi. I'm trying to boot into Ubuntu on a Toshiba satellite s1135-s135. After selecing "Try ubuntu without any changes...", it goes to a blank screen with a black cursor, and nothing happens.  Any ideas?
2010-02-27T06:14:00.000Z	Dunkirk	Joeseph	Do you have a second monitor hooked up?
2010-02-27T06:14:00.000Z	Joeseph	Dunkirk	No.
