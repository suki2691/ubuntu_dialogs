2009-01-25T17:49:00.000Z	anokka		i'm installing ubuntu for a friend
2009-01-25T17:50:00.000Z	anokka		i did a 100mb /boot, 20gb / and 100gb /home. they're all primary partitions, is this OK?
2009-01-25T17:51:00.000Z	anokka		all partitions are primary, no logical partitions. is this cool?
2009-01-25T17:51:00.000Z	gordonjcp	anokka	should be okay
