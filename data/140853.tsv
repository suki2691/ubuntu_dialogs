2007-04-01T16:50:00.000Z	jannes	MrRio	I don't think so, I've only found screens with that ugly design
2007-04-01T16:51:00.000Z	MrRio	jannes	yuk, ugly grey, there must be a way to get it atleast looking like one of the built in themes java swt has
2007-04-01T16:55:00.000Z	jannes	MrRio	I'm not very familiar with java, but I think that's not possible atm
