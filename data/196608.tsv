2006-10-13T06:56:00.000Z	newbie		i just installed ubuntu and i cannot mount my 2nd hard drive   it's a EXT3 partition i did mkdir /mnt/mount/ but now there's commands that i forget to finish mounting this thing. Also, i'd like to know how to add this device in fstab
2006-10-13T06:57:00.000Z	chuckyp	newbie	is it an ntfs or fat32 partition?  or just linux part?
2006-10-13T06:58:00.000Z	chuckyp	newbie	that page has good instructions to look at.  The last one ubotu sent you.
