2005-03-19T07:36:00.000Z	helio7		I have a friend installing Ubuntu for the first time and he has a 2ndary internal HDD that he wants to put it on (not where Windows lives) He wants to preserve the data, so I told him he needs to partition it first.   Would people recommend he use the Ubuntu Install Disk to manage the partition or use another app to do that prior to installation?
