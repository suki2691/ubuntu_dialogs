2007-04-08T15:31:00.000Z	kuba		i've got a question:i s another command than lspci to check my hardware of software??
2007-04-08T15:32:00.000Z	dxdt	kuba	literally it is ls (list) pci (pci parts)  kinda like how lsmod will list modules
2007-04-08T15:32:00.000Z	dxdt		or lsusb will list usb devices
2007-04-08T15:34:00.000Z	kuba	dxdt	so lsmod is the list of compiled modules?
