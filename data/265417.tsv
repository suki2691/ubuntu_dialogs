2005-07-01T14:13:00.000Z	Cybermagellan		I installed webmin from synaptic....however it is supposed to be webbased and I can't find anything for it....how am I supposed to access it anyone?
2005-07-01T14:14:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Cybermagellan	Try "man webmin"
2005-07-01T14:14:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Cybermagellan	Or navigate to /usr/share/doc/webmin and check out the files... I don't know the webmin package so I can't give you any direct things.
