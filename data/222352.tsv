2005-10-16T07:04:00.000Z	poningru	CrackersKeenan	no on both not possible, wmv3 is experimental on vlc
2005-10-16T07:04:00.000Z	CrackersKeenan	poningru	 does "experimental" mean it won't work?
2005-10-16T07:05:00.000Z	poningru	CrackersKeenan	experimental means its being worked on right now, expect it very soon
