2006-04-07T13:32:00.000Z	jonas3		why can't I find this package in my Ubuntu ?? http://packages.ubuntulinux.org/dapper/net/nepenthes ?
2006-04-07T13:32:00.000Z	jonas3		what is dapper ?
2006-04-07T13:34:00.000Z	jonas3		ok, so the package is only in dapper, I have to wait until it's realeased or can I start using it already by changing my apt-sources ?
