2008-06-22T08:50:00.000Z	khaotik		i have an amd 64 turion dual core
2008-06-22T08:50:00.000Z	khaotik		so will all the applications i love to use work in 64 bit?
2008-06-22T08:51:00.000Z	unavailable	khaotik	unless you have a real need for 64 bit computing, i would say go with 32 bit... the software list sucks with 64 bit
