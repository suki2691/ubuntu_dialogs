2009-07-06T03:27:00.000Z	wahnfrieden		so how can I see what DNS servers I was automatically configured to use? Is there some way in ifconfig maybe?
2009-07-06T03:27:00.000Z	wahnfrieden		I'm using Jaunty and gnome
2009-07-06T03:28:00.000Z	adi__	wahnfrieden	make a file named resolv.conf in /etc
2009-07-06T03:28:00.000Z	adi__	wahnfrieden	and put there the nameserver xx.xx.xx.xx
