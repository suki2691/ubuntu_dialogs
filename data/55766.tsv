2009-06-14T02:10:00.000Z	sofiankrt	cabrey	sebsebseb: ok, thanks a lot!
2009-06-14T02:10:00.000Z	cabrey	sofiankrt	IMHO you should wait for 9.10 and do a clean format
2009-06-14T02:12:00.000Z	sofiankrt	cabrey	yeah, I've always had this question. So okay, I've got my files, Music, Documents, etc, which I can easily back up. But what about the other things? My firefox bookmarks? Pidgin logs? Compiz settings? Is there an easy way to move all this stuff into another system without copying the whole /home?
