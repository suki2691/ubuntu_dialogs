2011-05-31T20:08:00.000Z	m4xx		i'm trying to set up my kyocera fs-1128mfp printer via network. if i print small files it works just fine, but if i try to print this 3.7mb pdf the printer errors and the attention light starts blinking
2011-05-31T20:08:00.000Z	m4xx		anyone know what might be going on?
2011-05-31T20:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	m4xx	how much cache does the printer have?
2011-05-31T20:11:00.000Z	m4xx	ActionParsnip	when i print to that same file to the same printer from a windows machine it seems to work just fine.
