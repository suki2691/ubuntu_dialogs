2009-04-27T07:36:00.000Z	akincer	voss	Firefox performance sucks for lack of a better word. Urban Terror (my favorite FPS) plays like crap. Sound on my laptop doesn't work on boot--I have to kill Pulse Audio to make it work. The Display app doesn't work on my desktop well at all. That's all I've discovered in 24 hours.
