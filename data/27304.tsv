2010-08-29T19:48:00.000Z	houserockr		is there any way to influence the compositing behavior of metacity (i.e. the built-in compositing of metacity)? I would like to disable thumbnails in the window-switcher (ALT+TAB)???
2010-08-29T19:50:00.000Z	houserockr		i mean, thumbnails in the window-switcher are a nice feature, as long as they don't need five minutes to be created at first
