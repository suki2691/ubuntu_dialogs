2009-07-02T09:33:00.000Z	Omarman		Ok.. I have Shiretoko installed.. And yes, It's what firefox 3.5 shows up as on Linux. I love that the stable firefox stays installed as well.. WTG!
2009-07-02T09:34:00.000Z	Omarman		When ff3.5 final gets pushed up to repository, will it uninstall 3.0?
2009-07-02T09:34:00.000Z	lstarnes	Omarman	I don't think so.  It will likely be a separate package
2009-07-02T09:35:00.000Z	Omarman	lstarnes	thanks.. I can do the uninstall myself when 3.5 becomes official
