2006-04-23T08:15:00.000Z	jwiens		I've got a potential bug in dapper I'd like to see if someone else could verify before I submit it -- basically it looks like vim syntax highlighting isn't working.  There's a more excplicit log entry when you try ":syntax on", but I'd like to make sure it's not just something I've done.  Any takers?
