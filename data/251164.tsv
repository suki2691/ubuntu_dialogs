2009-10-24T05:39:00.000Z	afeijo		I setup a virtual ubuntu to be my web server, everytime I run it, I have to login, and run sudo dhclient to get ip from my router :( what can I do to automatize it?
2009-10-24T05:39:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	afeijo	edit the file /etc/network/interfaces, then it will be done automatically
2009-10-24T05:40:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	afeijo	add a line with this: iface eth0 inet dhcp
2009-10-24T05:40:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	afeijo	and make sure there is also this line: auto lo eth0
