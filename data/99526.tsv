2008-10-09T10:02:00.000Z	f|uke		I'm trying to set up vnc4server. A tutorial tells me to edit /etc/xinetd.d/Xvnc but /xinetd.d/ does not exist. Can anyone help?
2008-10-09T10:02:00.000Z	afallenhope	f|uke	 it's /etc/init.d
2008-10-09T10:03:00.000Z	afallenhope	f|uke	 there's no "X" so it's /etc/init.d/xvnc
2008-10-09T10:05:00.000Z	afallenhope	f|uke	no prob.
