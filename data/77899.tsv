2008-11-30T16:56:00.000Z	UberTaco		quick question: how would I go about upgrading an existing 8.04 install to 8.10 using the standard Live ISO?
2008-11-30T16:56:00.000Z	UberTaco		I can apt-get, but web-surfing's blocked. Otherwise I'd have googled it
2008-11-30T16:56:00.000Z	ziroday`	UberTaco	you can't. Only the alternate cd can be used
