2010-04-26T13:01:00.000Z	ojii	JenniferB	you're not supposed to have root access as a normal user. root is kinda dangerous. but if you need root type sudo su into a shell
2010-04-26T13:02:00.000Z	JenniferB	ojii	yes.. i know about sudo.. but I need it in the "folder view" as well
2010-04-26T13:03:00.000Z	ojii	JenniferB	sudo nautilus then
