2005-10-21T15:06:00.000Z	blahdeblah		Hi all.  Is there a web page where we can look up package versions in the different Ubuntu releases?  Something like http://packages.debian.org/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?
2005-10-21T15:08:00.000Z	blahdeblah		Karhuton/icewt: thanks - search at www.ubuntu.com didn't find that.
2005-10-21T15:10:00.000Z	blahdeblah		Is breezy the current stable release?  packages.ubuntu.com doesn't indicate which release is the latest & which is the oldest.
2005-10-21T15:10:00.000Z	mustard5	blahdeblah	breezy is current
