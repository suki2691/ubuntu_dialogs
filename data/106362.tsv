2010-04-03T13:24:00.000Z	subone		 try to install java6-plugin over this...
2010-04-03T13:24:00.000Z	subone		 is there any application that allows you to find lost files... i mean for example if i install files to a ../bin directory and the installer isnt a package how can i ever remember where they are or how to uninstall them? i was wondering if there is a program to scan your computer and identify files that are without "packages"
