2009-08-30T02:19:00.000Z	ceneee		ok, so I'm new to this whole linux/ubuntu thing, and I just really needed an os on my laptop and since I didn't have windows I decided to use thisold kubuntu 7.1 cd i found. OK, so I've been burning cd's with ubuntu 9.04.iso on them and all of them haven't been working and come up as corrupted. Right now I'm posting from the laptop that has kubuntu on it so I wanted to know if there was a way to download + install ubuntu directly
