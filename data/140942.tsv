2009-08-07T01:01:00.000Z	theTroy		Help. Mount.ntfs-3g is stuck on iowait and cannot be sudo kill -9. I was playing music with songbird, then disconnected portable drive (accidentally plugged off) and when trying to connect back, it does not mount, and adds another mount.ntfs-3g process on iowait, after system restart it works fine. ++ Have to make hard turn-off since otherwise it doesnt even want to turn off properly.
2009-08-07T01:03:00.000Z	theTroy		Am I asking something  incorrectly or is it just an unkown issue?
