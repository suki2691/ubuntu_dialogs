2008-03-13T11:13:00.000Z	stefano_	phuzion	yes there is a very convinient thing called the "super grub disk", just google it, it's very easy

2008-03-13T11:15:00.000Z	stefano_	phuzion	i don't think grub has a clue about filesystems and block devices, so i don't think it's able to boot off of usb, but i may be wrong.
