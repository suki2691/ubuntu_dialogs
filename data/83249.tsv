2008-09-15T17:09:00.000Z	zoed	sat_e_llite	you have one available on the live cd: System->Administration->Partition Editor
2008-09-15T17:11:00.000Z	zoed	sat_e_llite	yes, but only use it from the live cd when changing your current hard disk, because otherwise you could have data loss!
2008-09-15T17:11:00.000Z	zoed	sat_e_llite	and think carefully before deleting or changing partitions.
