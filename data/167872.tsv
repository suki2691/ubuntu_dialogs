2007-08-05T05:29:00.000Z	delmar		Anyone here know much about using Compiz ?  I have it running ok but I'm having some strange graphical issues... like, app windows going blank when being sized/resized.  playing media works in a small window, but VLC media player just closes if I enlarge it or full screen... anyone know much about compiz and these issues?
