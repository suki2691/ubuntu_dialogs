2008-04-17T03:33:00.000Z	dmsuperman		Does anybody know why my firefox location bar is messed up? It won't change to  the URL I'm currently at, like for instance if I go to google.com, it should redirect to http://www.google.com/, only the location bar still says google.com (even though it actually went to google.com. Also, when I click links the page goes, but the location bar is still the same
