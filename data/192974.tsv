2006-06-06T07:29:00.000Z	borisn		hello....im trying to install 6.06 and i have a 76 gb partition open...so i set 75 gb to the install partition and the remaining gb to swap...except when i have to choose where to install it and the swap drive, it only recognizes the partition as a whole?
2006-06-06T07:30:00.000Z	Matthewv	borisn	you set all that in the desktop installer?
2006-06-06T07:31:00.000Z	Matthewv	borisn	did you write the changes to disk before exiting the partitioner?
2006-06-06T07:32:00.000Z	Matthewv	borisn	are you still in the installer now?
