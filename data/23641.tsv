2010-10-23T04:48:00.000Z	evilson	metap0d	I design and maintain very large networks and I need to be able to "speak" to the other systems natively very frequently. Ubuntu on a laptop or two allows that pretty much out of the box without a lot of "research"
2010-10-23T04:48:00.000Z	evilson	metap0d	other linux are just fine as well but do require more time and knowledge
