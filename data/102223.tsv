2010-11-23T10:11:00.000Z	jimjankins		I am putting a fresh install on my Toshiba laptop. I am at the "Who are you?" screen and I have inputted all of the correct information and it is not allowing me to move forward. The button "forward" continues to be grayed out as if I haven't givin it all the information...any ideas?
