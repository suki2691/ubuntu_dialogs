2005-12-31T15:47:00.000Z	Dattas		hey guys, i am trying to get the most out of my ubuntu server, so my question is this: what are you using your server for and what programs are you using to serve?
2005-12-31T15:47:00.000Z	psusi	Dattas	isn't that putting the cart before the horse?  use a server to serve your needs... don't add stuff just so you can say your server is doing it
2005-12-31T15:48:00.000Z	Dattas	psusi	thats that thing i am not sure what is all out there and google is giving me odd results
2005-12-31T15:49:00.000Z	psusi	Dattas	it doesn't matter what is "out there" what do you NEED?
