2008-01-05T19:13:00.000Z	pulse00		can't find any special live image
2008-01-05T19:14:00.000Z	scguy318	pulse00	that would do I believe
2008-01-05T19:15:00.000Z	pulse00	scguy318	i copied the content of the iso to the usb-stick and made it bootable using syslinux -f /dev/sde1, but when booting from it, i get "no operation system found" or something, displayed too short to remember
