2009-09-05T21:37:00.000Z	ring0	legend2440	thanks for the article. i was wondering since pysdm somehow manages to handle my fstab, which only contains uuid entries. so the wiki und forum info seems to be outdated?
2009-09-05T21:39:00.000Z	legend2440	ring0	yes i tried pysdm a while back. it worked pretty good. i like the way it cleans up the entries so they are all nice and neat
