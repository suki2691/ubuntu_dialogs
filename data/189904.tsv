2007-04-22T15:47:00.000Z	slackern	jacquesmerde	i know you can use apt-get autoremove now so they added that so far but synaptic i'm not sure about
2007-04-22T15:48:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	slackern	does synaptic use autoremove by default? if not can i set it to? or do i have to use cli apt-get autremove?
2007-04-22T15:50:00.000Z	slackern	jacquesmerde	i don't see that option in synaptic so i don't think they added it not as far as i can see atleast
