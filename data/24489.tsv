2010-10-11T19:57:00.000Z	mari0N		my Ubuntu 10.04 install failed: I'm in a terminal at startup and when I startx many programs don't work, complaining that the "dbus" is unavailable. LiveCD works fine which is how I'm chatting now
2010-10-11T19:58:00.000Z	mari0N		and also uuidgen hasn't run as uuid is zero bytes not 32
2010-10-11T19:59:00.000Z	mari0N		does Ubuntu run on MAC?
2010-10-11T19:59:00.000Z	darael	mari0N	Yes.  It does.
