2010-06-30T02:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dbahiaz	someone else seemed to have a similar issue
2010-06-30T02:41:00.000Z	dbahiaz	sebsebseb	know  how to downgrade
2010-06-30T02:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dbahiaz	nah try another browser though?  what tends to happen with Ubuntu is this,  Flash gets issues in FIrefox, but thats on the verge of changing it seems.   and other browsers :)
