2006-09-25T16:23:00.000Z	ciplogic		Hi all, I have an Ati X700 and I have following problems: poor performance using composite (is lower performance than a GF2 Mx 200 at Compiz), I setup a dual-view display, question, I can go the mouse only in first display, the second one has a different GNOME and I don't know how to move windows to it. In Windows I can drag-drop in different displays, any ideas?
