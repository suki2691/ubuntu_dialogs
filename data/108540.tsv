2007-12-27T10:32:00.000Z	jimbo		I just put linux on my desktop it used to have windows and the os was on a raid and the raid failed so i took out the hd with the error and put linux on a new hard drive, one of the hardrives (not part of the raid) was in the computer and was hiberanted by windows and now linux wouldnt let me mount the hd because it was hibernated by windows.

2007-12-27T10:33:00.000Z	J_Laptop	jimbo	- then I don't know - if you didn't care, you could dd the drive to clear it out
