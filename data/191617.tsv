2009-08-22T21:46:00.000Z	FredWP_Yeeloong		Pfff never mind then.
2009-08-22T21:47:00.000Z	MTecknology	FredWP_Yeeloong	the installed will offer to keep them for you
2009-08-22T21:47:00.000Z	MTecknology	FredWP_Yeeloong	don't switch in one big jump though - just have the installer compress windows and offer a dual boot
