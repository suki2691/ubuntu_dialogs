2006-12-19T11:01:00.000Z	mohlertm	ski-worklap	 i am trying to play a reagular dvd on my dvd rom drive and tried to play a .avi file i downloaded.  Both failed in VLC.
2006-12-19T11:01:00.000Z	ski-worklap	mohlertm	definitely give mplayer a spin - it supports just about any codec there is
2006-12-19T11:03:00.000Z	mohlertm	ski-worklap	 when i righ click and open my .avi file with mplayer it gives me the following error.."Could not read from resource."
