2009-12-11T09:46:00.000Z	scunizi	tsunami	are you coming from another distro?
2009-12-11T09:47:00.000Z	scunizi	tsunami	ah.. no wonder you asked.. sudo is the norm with ubuntu.. there are a few instances you have to be logged in as root to get a package installed or configured.. but that's pretty rare.. sudo works fine for 99% of the time
