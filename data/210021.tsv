2006-03-03T15:51:00.000Z	topyli	elephanthunter	i have a box at work that won't get an address with the breezy kernel. i installed the old hoary kernel and all is fine. i have no idea what my university network's nameservers do, but that's what happened to me
2006-03-03T15:52:00.000Z	elephanthunter	topyli	Is there a simple way to downgrade without reinstalling?
2006-03-03T15:53:00.000Z	topyli	elephanthunter	i downloaded the hoary kernel from archive.ubuntu.com and installed it
2006-03-03T15:54:00.000Z	topyli	elephanthunter	the rest of the system didn't need any tweaking
