2010-06-09T16:48:00.000Z	zylogz80	thune3	I installed karmic and then installed the ubuntu studio packages. in order to use jack with the lowest latency I run the realtime kernel. I need to select the real time kernel on boot to boot into it. if this was grub 1 I'd edit the config file but grub2 is unfamiliar to me. I need a graphical tool to configure it.
