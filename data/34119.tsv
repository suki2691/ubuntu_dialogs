2010-04-18T17:49:00.000Z	Hans_Henrik		im running multi-boot ubuntu/Win7, i made win7 default from grub bootloader, and gave myself 1 second to chose ubuntu instead, and seemingly its a bug in grub cus no matter how much i spam the up-button, that 1 second goes down to 0 before grub responds, thus im unable to enter ubuntu.. ideas how i can fix it?
