2008-05-16T01:18:00.000Z	Gantz		what does "sudo modprobe uniput" accomplish?
2008-05-16T01:18:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Gantz	it loads the uniput module into the kernel
2008-05-16T01:19:00.000Z	Gantz	Starnestommy	it doesn't seem to want to do that, or its just not confirming such
2008-05-16T01:19:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Gantz	if that command does not output anything, it worked
