2007-04-13T12:23:00.000Z	Enselic		When I have the IDE cable of my CD reader connected to the mobo, it seems dead when I boot, e.g. the front diod doesn't blink, and the tray cannot be ejected. However, when I only have the power cable connected to the CD reader, the front diod blinks and I can eject and close the tray. Anyone know what's wrong?
