2012-01-11T21:06:00.000Z	Anomie21		I can't put files onto my external HD from other computers. I've tried cd /media/your_external_drive // sudo chmod -R 777 - any help?
2012-01-11T21:06:00.000Z	skel	Anomie21	what do you mean by "from other computers". Have you set it up as NFS or iSCSI ?
2012-01-11T21:07:00.000Z	Anomie21	skel	I've tried it on two Mac OSX and its giving me a permission error. Should've mentioned it's NTFS
2012-01-11T21:08:00.000Z	skel	Anomie21	there's a few things you need to install to OSX before you can write to NTFS
