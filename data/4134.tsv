2012-05-01T19:06:00.000Z	ggherdov		I am running Natty, i.e. 11.04. I'd like to upgrade to Precise (12.04). From https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PreciseUpgrades looks like I need 11.10 as an intermediate step. What is the exact procedure? apt-get something?
2012-05-01T19:08:00.000Z	omido	ggherdov	 This is what i did : i used ubuntu 12.04 live cd to upgrade my 11.04 installition and it just went fine
2012-05-01T19:09:00.000Z	ggherdov	omido	I see. But I have to download the ISO image then. I will try with the proc suggested by Logan_
2012-05-01T19:09:00.000Z	omido	ggherdov	 what Logan_ said is better but having the live cd may come in handy sometimes.
