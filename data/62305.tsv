2009-11-02T05:48:00.000Z	gluonman		I am trying to setup a dual-boot with Ubuntu 9.10 and Win7 (Ubuntu installed first). Now that I'm trying to install Win7 in the unallocated space, it is telling me: Setup was unable to create a new system partition or locate an existing system partition. See the Setup log files for more information. What can I do?
