2011-11-01T18:53:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex		so whats the diff between diff and patch?
2011-11-01T18:54:00.000Z	soreau	brontosaurusrex	Typically a patch contains information specific to the target package, user info and can contain several diffs in a single patch
2011-11-01T18:55:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	soreau	right, so basically a patch is one or more diffs with the target info and submiter info? and other metadata possibly?
2011-11-01T18:57:00.000Z	soreau	brontosaurusrex	Yes, or could be as simple as a single diff
