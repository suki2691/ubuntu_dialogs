2010-06-17T06:47:00.000Z	jill		I am trying to install a Lexmark printer on Ubuntu 10.04 and it simply isn't cooperating. Does anyone know how to do this?
2010-06-17T06:48:00.000Z	jill		Fuzzy, are you running Skype or anything when it happens?
2010-06-17T06:49:00.000Z	fuzzybunny69y	jill	no it happens randomly even when im just at the desktop it will do that then a little while later it will fix itself
