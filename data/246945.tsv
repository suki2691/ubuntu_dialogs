2005-03-02T07:34:00.000Z	helio7		So I'm having a problem: I'm installing Ubuntu on a variety of old machines and on some of them I have succeeded, whereas on others X will never load, and on others I have a successful environment and then one day on reboot X fails me completely... any ideas?  I have 2 machines on hand that are stuck with no X

2005-03-02T07:35:00.000Z	fsc	helio7	basically it comes down to doing a little research about your video cards, what linux drivers are available, and adjusting your X config file approprietly
2005-03-02T07:37:00.000Z	helio7	fsc	Ok i'm familiar with that... what's your first suggestion as to the part... ?
