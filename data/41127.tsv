2009-12-11T11:59:00.000Z	alexstre^		I just booted 9.10 from the live cd on an iMac G5 and right after the boot a pop up showed property drivers to install for my wireless to work, which I enabled and everything was fine. I then completed the install and reboot in the "real, installed" ubuntu and the pop up never showed up... Anyone knows how I can enable those drivers manually?

2009-12-11T12:00:00.000Z	alexstre^	Ubuntu_user	I know that already. but it works perfectly from the live cd. not so well once it's installed though... which is a bit weird
2009-12-11T12:00:00.000Z	Ubuntu_user	alexstre^	also no flash
