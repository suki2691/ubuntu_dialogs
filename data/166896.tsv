2007-03-05T17:08:00.000Z	soundray	progek	of course it does
2007-03-05T17:09:00.000Z	progek	soundray	thanks, maybe you can help. Im trying to install nvidia drivers in kubuntu. After installing nvidia-glx and running nvidia-xconfig control+alt+backspace stops working and I still have lag in 3d apps (direct rendering states its on in glxinfo however)
