2009-03-01T05:07:00.000Z	dougl		I am running 8.04 and when I try to update system there are 4 packages that give me "Error authenticating some packages" they are all xbmc related - can anyone help me out with this?
2009-03-01T05:08:00.000Z	zash	dougl	you should probably disable the xbmc repos before
2009-03-01T05:09:00.000Z	dougl	zash	- not that I know how to disable but if I accomplish this how do I update xbmc and supporting packages?
2009-03-01T05:09:00.000Z	zash	dougl	software sources!
