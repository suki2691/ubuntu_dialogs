2009-06-01T07:11:00.000Z	unixroot		I recently installed 9.04.  When I go to the Pandora site, the browser locks.  Any clues?

2009-06-01T07:14:00.000Z	ed_debian	unixroot	I think that you have to purge all of your flash packages except for one (the one you intend to use)
2009-06-01T07:16:00.000Z	ed_debian	unixroot	I don't really know what the problem is either.  I guess reinstalling is a good a choice as anything else.  I am running firefox 3.0 and the adobe-flash (proprietary) and it works (does not lock) but when I had a poor network connection it used to lock (like below 512KB/s down)
