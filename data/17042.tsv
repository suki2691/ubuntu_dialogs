2011-06-11T04:16:00.000Z	Kayne		hello? um i kind of need some help here,  I don't know what I am doing .
2011-06-11T04:17:00.000Z	Kayne		Well,  i usually run windows, but my  Media hard drive stopped being read in windows and someone told me to run unbutu.  so i  downloaded it onto  a usb and  told my computer to run it on the next boot.  I got a screen of errors , and then the red unbutu screen,
2011-06-11T04:18:00.000Z	Kayne		then a wall of  code, followed by the same  running screen of errors, and now it seems like its in a loop
2011-06-11T04:18:00.000Z	mrdeb	Kayne	did you use the usb creator to make the usb stick bootable?
