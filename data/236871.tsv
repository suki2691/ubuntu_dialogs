2005-12-06T16:16:00.000Z	Kimppa		Umm. Hi. Something weird just happened to me. I had around 150 mb free space on hda1, so I moved a 1,1 GB file to hda2, however, the when I run "df -h", the free space on hda1 hasn't increased o_O
2005-12-06T16:16:00.000Z	Kimppa		and yes, I moved the file, not copied
