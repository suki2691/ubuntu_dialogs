2010-07-02T16:13:00.000Z	VilleVicious		I'm running 10.04 and it seems to completely ingnore empy cd-rs in my drive, which makes burning cds a problematic. Can any one give me any advice on this?

2010-07-02T16:16:00.000Z	VilleVicious	IConrad01	no, it says that insert cd-r to make something other that an cd-image when I try adding files to be burned
2010-07-02T16:16:00.000Z	IConrad01	VilleVicious	It does that with all CD-R's?
