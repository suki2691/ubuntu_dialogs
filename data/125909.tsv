2007-08-05T13:07:00.000Z	JDLimbo		anyone ever heard of vista causing trouble while overwriting it with ubuntu, or anything else for that matter? I'm running a feisty/vista dual boot and want to make it just ubuntu
2007-08-05T13:07:00.000Z	JDLimbo		I remember hearing about vista causing trouble when I set up the dual boot, but can't find it
2007-08-05T13:08:00.000Z	JDLimbo		might have just been for dual booting
2007-08-05T13:08:00.000Z	xerawx	JDLimbo	if you overwrite vista it can't cause trouble anymore ;)
