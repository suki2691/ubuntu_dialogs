2008-09-30T22:34:00.000Z	scyTh3		I am having a bit of a problem after kernel update. I have set 'automatic module loading' in the kernel and after reboot into new kernel ...no modules are running..I did a make modules && make modules_install and can manually load modules..In privious kernel compiles all modules would load on boot..what am I  doing wrong if someone can help?
