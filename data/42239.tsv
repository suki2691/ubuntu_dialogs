2010-11-11T00:21:00.000Z	yotam		Hi guys, I'm trying to install race for the galaxy on my machine. I have downloaded the files from here http://www.keldon.net/rftg/ and got the following error
2010-11-11T00:21:00.000Z	yotam		gui.c:21: fatal error: gtk/gtk.h: No such file or directory
2010-11-11T00:21:00.000Z	yotam		What do I need to install (apart from libgtk2.0-dev which is installed)?
