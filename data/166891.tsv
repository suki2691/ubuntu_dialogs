2009-02-08T02:34:00.000Z	rods		If I install a program from a .deb package instead of from a repository, and then want to uninstall it, and it doesn't show up in add/remove or in synaptic package manager, what do I do?

2009-05-13T02:47:00.000Z	Flannel	rods	Unfortunately no. You can't "upgrade" from 32bit to 64bit.  You have to reinstall.  (although if you had a separate partition for /home, you could reinstall around that)
