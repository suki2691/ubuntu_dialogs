2011-08-27T17:28:00.000Z	Peppe80		Hi, I'm running ubuntu 11.04 on an zotax nd-22 nvidia ion chip computer. For some reason hardware acceleration of flash in the browser does not seem to work, I have the latest nvidia driver, and the adobe-check-box hardware-acceleration is checked, but it does not seem to use the GPU as my cpu is up around 99%. (btw additional drivers say nvidia ~activated but not in use))
