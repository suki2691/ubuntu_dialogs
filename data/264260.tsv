2005-12-16T07:13:00.000Z	ejofee		why does synaptic say some of my sources are duplicate? is it because some are "universe" and some others are "universe multiverse"?
2005-12-16T07:13:00.000Z	ejofee		does "universe multiverse" include "universe"?
2005-12-16T07:14:00.000Z	ejofee		can i safely remove "universe" or add "multiverse" to those lines?
2005-12-16T07:14:00.000Z	topyli	ejofee	yes. i just add them all to the same entry
