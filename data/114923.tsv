2007-10-28T17:51:00.000Z	jimmygoon	shredfive	that's only when it crashed the time before
2007-10-28T17:51:00.000Z	jimmygoon	shredfive	yours must be crashing on exit everytime :P
2007-10-28T17:53:00.000Z	shredfive	jimmygoon	well, yeah. I log out and all my apps die. That's not really an error.  There's some setting in about:config to prevent that.
