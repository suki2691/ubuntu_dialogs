2006-08-25T15:18:00.000Z	eXistenZ	Not-Clever	Not if you have a network connection
2006-08-25T15:19:00.000Z	eXistenZ	Not-Clever	You can download everything that is in the DVD through your network connection, so if it available, no need.
2006-08-25T15:19:00.000Z	Not-Clever	eXistenZ	Yeah, thats what I thought.  Long time since I used a linux dist.  Just gonna download an ISO for the new lappy before it arrives.
