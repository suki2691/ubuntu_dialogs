2007-10-02T08:49:00.000Z	LjL	dgjones	nope what i've seen is a few xorg drivers... specifically xserver-xorg-input-elo2300 xserver-xorg-input-evtouch xserver-xorg-input-palmax. don't know what magictouch is
2007-10-02T08:49:00.000Z	dgjones	LjL	np, thought it was worth mentioning just in case
2007-10-02T08:50:00.000Z	LjL	dgjones	ah yes, it's another driver. so bpssoft, the ones above, plus xserver-xorg-input-magictouch might be what you want.
