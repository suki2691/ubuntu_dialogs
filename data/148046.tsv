2007-03-05T06:55:00.000Z	kelsin	techie	you mean for page layout type of work?
2007-03-05T06:56:00.000Z	kelsin	techie	can you define publisher? (Sorry I just don't know what you mean)
2007-03-05T06:57:00.000Z	kelsin	techie	look into Inkscape or Scribus, I prefer Inkscape, I think there are some others, but I use Inkscape for any type of layout work
