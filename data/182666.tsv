2007-02-19T08:32:00.000Z	mazzen		hi! i can remember that for ubuntu 6.06 there were updates for gnome (gnome 2.14.2 and 2.14.3). so i thought these updates would be seen as "security updates". so i wonder if there are gnome updates planend for 6.10 or not.
2007-02-19T08:34:00.000Z	mazzen		or do i have somthing missing in my sources.list?
2007-02-19T08:36:00.000Z	paradroid	mazzen	mozilla-mplayer is in multiverse
2007-02-19T08:37:00.000Z	mazzen	paradroid	thanks, but i dindnt asked for mozilla-mplayer :). i was wondering if gnome 2.16.2 or even better gnome 2.16.3 will be there for ubuntu 6.10
