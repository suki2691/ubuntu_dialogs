2010-01-11T02:55:00.000Z	cvd		hello
2010-01-11T02:56:00.000Z	cvd		in the grub menu show to kernels .17 and .14 how can i show only the new one, the startup manager program dont have the 'Show only one kernel'
2010-01-11T02:57:00.000Z	guntbert	cvd	its wise to have two kernels to choose from
2010-01-11T02:58:00.000Z	guntbert	cvd	because it is always possible that a new kernel will not boot ...
