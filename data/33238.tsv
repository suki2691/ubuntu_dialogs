2010-05-17T21:23:00.000Z	Loshki	Um_cara_qualquer	very cool...
2010-05-17T21:24:00.000Z	Um_cara_qualquer	Loshki	by the way is it still possible to include subtitle in it? the part that matches with the part of the video?
2010-05-17T21:26:00.000Z	Loshki	Um_cara_qualquer	that depends on how the subtitles are stored. Usually the subs for an avi are in a separate (.srt) file and you'd have to edit that file separately and change all the timings. I use subtitleworkshop under wine to adjust subtitle timings. Nothing else works like it...
