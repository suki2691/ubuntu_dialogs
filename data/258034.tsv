2004-11-15T12:50:00.000Z	BrittBS	thoreauputic	from the man page, visudo edits the sudoers file in a safe fashion, analogous to vipw(8). visudo locks the sudoers file against multiple simultaneous edits, provides basic sanity checks, and checks for parse errors. If the sudoers file is currently being edited you will receive a message to try again later.

2004-11-15T12:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	BrittBS	OK - I get it now ;) Thanks for the info :)
