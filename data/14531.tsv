2011-11-26T08:24:00.000Z	bluebomber	pragmaticenigma	I still could not connect from any of the other hosts on my LAN either. (re my VNC setup issue)
2011-11-26T08:25:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	bluebomber	I eventually install x11vnc on my rig to get VNC connections to my machine... it was faster and easier for me to get it up and running... downside is the machine has to be logged in locally to a session for it to work
