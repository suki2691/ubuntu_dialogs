2011-10-30T19:44:00.000Z	meowsus		I've got an external drive that automounts each time I boot, and I want it to stop. It's at /dev/sdc and it isn't listed in /etc/fstab. Do you know how this drive might be automounting and how i can stop it? I'm using LXDE.

2011-10-30T19:48:00.000Z	meowsus	Shadow_7	it also, randomly, spins up for seemingly no reason... like I'll start a web browser or a new terminal, or just switch windows and it'll spin up, then die down again. It's my backups drive, so I don't want it mounted by default...
