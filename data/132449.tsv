2007-06-01T07:55:00.000Z	verahsa	Daverocks	That's not entirely true. There's a broad range of WoW gamers that play -more- than just WoW. :p
2007-06-01T07:55:00.000Z	Daverocks	verahsa	ok ok
2007-06-01T07:56:00.000Z	verahsa	Daverocks	I play WoW, and it's probably what I play the -most-, but I also hit up Vanguard, EQ2, the godforsaken Planetside, and a few other non-mmorpgs when I get the urge. <grin>
