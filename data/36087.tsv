2010-03-12T05:04:00.000Z	al-tabq		is there any way to create a shortcut in the applications menu for a program written in java? it won't open .jar and doesn't execute commands
2010-03-12T05:05:00.000Z	iceroot	al-tabq	make a shortcut with "java -jar /path/to/the/file.jar"
2010-03-12T05:05:00.000Z	al-tabq	iceroot	i tried that but it won't execute
2010-03-12T05:05:00.000Z	al-tabq	iceroot	i created a shortcut in .bashrc but it would be nice to have it in the menu as well
