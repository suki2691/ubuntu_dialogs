2008-07-17T21:12:00.000Z	bonez44		I just installed ubuntu.... trying to get beryl installed..... apt-cache search shows only compiz-fusion-bcop.....
2008-07-17T21:13:00.000Z	Flannel	bonez44	Beryl is dead, it re-merged with compiz and they're now compiz-fusion
2008-07-17T21:13:00.000Z	bonez44	Flannel	ok, so I have compiz-fusion installed...how do I get it running?
2008-07-17T21:13:00.000Z	Flannel	bonez44	It is likely already running.  You'll want to install compizconfig-settings-manager or simple-ccsm for configuration ease.
