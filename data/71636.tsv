2009-12-08T01:08:00.000Z	jonz_		hello, i'm having serious problems with my ftp client on ubuntu (and not any other machine - like my schools freebsd machine)
2009-12-08T01:08:00.000Z	jonz_		it times out after i type 2 or 3 commands
2009-12-08T01:09:00.000Z	jonz_		did anyone have to modify there ftp client (the cli one: /usr/bin/ftp) to use it on ubuntu
