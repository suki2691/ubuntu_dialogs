2009-04-02T22:31:00.000Z	l337ingDisorder		Hey can anyone help with an FTP question? In a web browser I can load ftp://user:pass@host to have it connect without prompting for login info... I'd like to do the same with the command-line client, so I can just create a bash script to immediately drop me into a specific FTP account connection. Does anyone know how to do that on the command line?
