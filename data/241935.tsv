2008-01-13T23:06:00.000Z	ed_		hey guys, is there a way for me to comb an ntfs partition for bad sectors?  can't seem to find a program that does it from ubuntu
2008-01-13T23:07:00.000Z	astro76	ed_	not sure if it does bad sectors though
2008-01-13T23:09:00.000Z	astro76	ed_	sudo apt-get install <packagename>
2008-01-13T23:10:00.000Z	astro76	ed_	no appologies necessary
