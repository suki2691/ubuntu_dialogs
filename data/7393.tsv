2012-05-29T17:44:00.000Z	ccolorado	zykotick9	ssh lands me to an xterm session, but what i really use is "screen" for multiplexing
2012-05-29T17:45:00.000Z	zykotick9	ccolorado	if possible i'd try using rxvt-unicode instead of xterm as a test.
2012-05-29T17:52:00.000Z	ccolorado	zykotick9	ill give it a try thanks
