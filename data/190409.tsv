2007-03-04T11:20:00.000Z	lufis		I edited my swap partition manually and now Ubuntu isn't mounting it automatically since it has moved. How do I reset the swap position?
2007-03-04T11:20:00.000Z	lufis		just use mount?
2007-03-04T11:21:00.000Z	grayman__	lufis	you changed the swap partition?
2007-03-04T11:21:00.000Z	lufis	grayman__	well, for good reason ;) I underestimated my need... ended up with a too-small swap and a lot of thrashing. Made it bigger
