2006-04-22T08:46:00.000Z	tidalwav1		hi, again, room---I've determined that ubuntu-desktop is no longer installed on my Dapper system, and when I try to install it, I get a huge list of unmet dependencies....what's going on?
2006-04-22T08:47:00.000Z	tidalwav1		anyone? this is a friend's computer and he's going to kill me.

2006-04-22T08:49:00.000Z	Agamotto	tidalwav1	 It might be faster.  Is /home on another partition?
