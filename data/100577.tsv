2008-02-19T01:26:00.000Z	{Nathan}		I have a bunch of files in folders called a.jpeg, how would I move them all to a single folder as a1.jpeg, a2.jpeg, etc?
2008-02-19T01:28:00.000Z	prince_jammys	{Nathan}	do you want to rename the files or just move them all to a single folder?
2008-02-19T01:29:00.000Z	{Nathan}	prince_jammys	I want to do both, because they are all named a.jpeg. I don't care what they are renamed to.
