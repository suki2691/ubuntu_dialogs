2007-10-07T06:41:00.000Z	DARKGuy		Hey people, having two video cards (nVIDIA GF4, main card - Trident, secondary) can I start my X normally on the main one, and run a different VT on the second display ( :1, or Trident) and control it using "screen" ?

2007-10-07T06:45:00.000Z	dystopianray	DARKGuy	you can't just do dual monitor on the main card?
