2010-04-15T01:55:00.000Z	tgp1994	knittl	You can just aptitude purge linux***, then install the new one all in one session.
2010-04-15T01:55:00.000Z	knittl	tgp1994	what if my system powers down before installing the new ones???
2010-04-15T01:56:00.000Z	tgp1994	knittl	I suppose that would be a problem :S I guess I would suggest sepeartly installing the new one, then purging the old one.
