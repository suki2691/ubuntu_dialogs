2007-08-14T12:25:00.000Z	politik		anyone? how can I debug why when I log in to my ubuntu box via xdmcp I can see the gdm login prompt and login, but gnome doesn't start afterwards?
2007-08-14T12:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	politik	Does failsafe gnome or failsafe terminal work?
2007-08-14T12:27:00.000Z	politik	Jordan_U	sorry, how do I select those when using xdmcp (via xming)? I am able to use the machine fine from a local login
2007-08-14T12:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	politik	I don't use XDMCP ( I always just do ssh -X ) so I am not very familiar with it, does it give you a standard GDM like you would get with a local login?
