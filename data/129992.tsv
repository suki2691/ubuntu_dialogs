2007-06-22T12:02:00.000Z	fiber		hello, i was wondering if anyone could give me some help setting up grub.  basically, i had ubuntu installed and then put XP on a separate partition but XP stole the MBR record so i can't get back into ubuntu (i'm on the liveCD right now)... anyone have any thoughts?
