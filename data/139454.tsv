I had no problems earlier when I was using the latest nvidia drivers through envyng, but then after a restart, I'm greeted with a blank screen at login. I've tried numerous things, including putting "Option "UseDisplayDevice" "DFP"" in xorg, as well as trying to use the restricted drivers manager instead of envyng, as well as installing the driver using nvidia's script. I even reinstal

2008-07-26T22:36:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	remu	did you uninstall apt's nvidia before nvidia's official driver?
