2011-01-10T20:35:00.000Z	jbwiv		I've checked /apps/panel/global and it doesn't have locked_down set
2011-01-10T20:35:00.000Z	jbwiv		guys, on Meerkat I can't hide or remove the bottom gnome-panel. Selecting properties and choosing autohide or show hide buttons makes it flash for a moment, but that's it. Choosing delete in the context menu  does nothing. How can this be fixed? Is there some sort of global lockdown in Meerkat?

2011-01-10T20:38:00.000Z	jbwiv	gobbe	yeah, I was afraid it's specific to me. I wonder if I need to blow away my gnome settings
