2011-02-05T23:34:00.000Z	Encry8		Hi, is there a way to use Subversion without a webhost? I want to use it on my local pc, i tried putting localhost for the URL
2011-02-05T23:36:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Encry8	does it have to be subversion?  Git doesn't really need a server at all ;-)
2011-02-05T23:36:00.000Z	Encry8	gordonjcp	is there a GUI for that?
2011-02-05T23:37:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Encry8	gitg
