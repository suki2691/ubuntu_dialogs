2009-12-06T19:48:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	MindSpark	you can do that, just don't install libapache-mod-php5 or something like that.
2009-12-06T19:50:00.000Z	MindSpark	SpaceGhostC2C	thanks, actually I just figured out there's a package called php5-cli
2009-12-06T19:50:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	MindSpark	glad you found what you needed.
