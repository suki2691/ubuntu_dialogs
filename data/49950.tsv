2009-10-07T22:28:00.000Z	Math		can grub boot up raid5 (md-raid) partitions or I have to reserve some space for /boot ?
2009-10-07T22:29:00.000Z	Math		so /boot it is, thanks

2009-10-07T22:30:00.000Z	Berzerker-	Math	RAID is defined as more than 1 hard drive working together on a single function, so yes, it is RAID.
