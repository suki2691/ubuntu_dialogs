2008-02-16T05:59:00.000Z	[dcr]		Hey, how could I go about installing Windows XP without overwriting Ubuntu?
2008-02-16T05:59:00.000Z	danbhfive	[dcr]	I would use the ubuntu disc to get a fat32 partition for windows, then install windows, then use the ubunbu disk to fix grub
2008-02-16T06:01:00.000Z	[dcr]	danbhfive	is there a wiki or any instructions i could print out for this method because I'm not going to remember how so easily, and im not sure how to fix a grub using the disc, ?
2008-02-16T06:04:00.000Z	danbhfive	[dcr]	not in my experience, but I have found the windows partitioner to suck very badly, that's why I suggested to use the ubuntu disk
