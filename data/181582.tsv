2006-07-16T11:01:00.000Z	TheStonepedo		my installer is crashing when using the same CD i used to install before
2006-07-16T11:01:00.000Z	TheStonepedo		is there a way to do a network install rather than relying on the packages on the CD?

2006-07-16T11:03:00.000Z	TheStonepedo	Warbo	i reckon i'll restart and see if the thing will boot enough to do a terminal
