2010-03-09T00:30:00.000Z	funkiwan	ZykoticK9	will give that a try. thanks.
2010-03-09T01:15:00.000Z	funkiwan	ZykoticK9	i tried recreating an xorg.conf file as you suggested and only leaving in the portion I wanted to change but it doesn't seem to have taken. i'm just trying to tweak my inputdevice but would like everything else auto-configured. any ideas?
