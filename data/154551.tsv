2007-08-01T13:51:00.000Z	scorp123	Xados	partioning is not more dangerous than crossing the street or driving a car ... it just helps when you know what you do :)
2007-08-01T13:53:00.000Z	scorp123	Xados	so you'll never going to learn how to drive a car because you heard on the news that there could be traffic accidents? ;-)
