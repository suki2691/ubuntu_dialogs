2009-02-26T22:43:00.000Z	zimbres		I installed pgplot5 via apt-get but I am not able to find the libraries in /usr/local/lib where should them have been placed?
2009-02-26T22:43:00.000Z	lstarnes	zimbres	try /usr/lib.  /usr/local/lib is used for libraries which aren't managed byt he package manager
2009-02-26T22:44:00.000Z	zimbres	lstarnes	so where can I find them?
