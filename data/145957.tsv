2007-05-01T08:46:00.000Z	Alecks		Hey, i've been having some problems lately, when I install 7.04 and it asks me to remove the CD and press enter to continue, it freezes.
2007-05-01T08:48:00.000Z	Alecks		Can anyone help me?

2007-05-01T08:51:00.000Z	hitmanWilly	Alecks	that sounds like it might be a grub problem
