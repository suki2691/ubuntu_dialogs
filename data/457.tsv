2012-11-10T05:10:00.000Z	SeducingOrange		I just installed ubuntu and decided to remove windows. I made a gparted live CD and removed the NTFS partitions. It finished (really quickly) and I rebooted. Instead of booting up ubuntu it says Intel UNDI, PXE-2.1 No bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key

2012-11-10T05:11:00.000Z	SeducingOrange	blazemore	Yeah. It was working fine
2012-11-10T05:11:00.000Z	SeducingOrange	blazemore	I am thinking that my hardrive failed and it is trying to boot from network but I am not sure
