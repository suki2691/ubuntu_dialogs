2010-03-26T17:38:00.000Z	elyob		Hi, when I got my laptop it had Win 7 which I didn't want to lose, but didn't have the disks supplied. So, i have a dual boot and use ubuntu 99.9% of the time (think I only ever booted win once). I unfortunately have used all primary drives and have 1/2 of my hard drive unallocated!
2010-03-26T17:39:00.000Z	elyob		Cannot figure out which is which, what I can delete etc
2010-03-26T17:40:00.000Z	abhi_nav	elyob	there are lots of things in win to delete. which you actually dont need e.g. restore
2010-03-26T17:41:00.000Z	elyob	abhi_nav	it's not that I have run out of space, I have 270GB unallocated which I want to recover into Linux.
