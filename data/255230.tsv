" --> is this true? (thought it would be in the next version)
2007-09-27T13:48:00.000Z	kbrooks	karel	yes it is true, there was some confusion
2007-10-30T03:10:00.000Z	kbrooks	karel	ext2 works with windows with a installer
2007-10-30T03:11:00.000Z	kbrooks	karel	and ntfs-3g on linux enables you to read/write to ntfs partitions
