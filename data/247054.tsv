2007-05-03T07:55:00.000Z	AzMoo		Hey. Every time I open Gaim it tells me that it "could not add buddy 1 for an unknown reason" and that the most common reason is that I have too many buddies. I don't have all that many contacts, and I'm not trying to add anybody, simply open the program. Anybody know what's going on?
