2010-11-06T03:07:00.000Z	RussR		 I need help! I accidently formatted a windows external HD with ubuntu. Is there any way to recover the data or un-format the drive?
2010-11-06T03:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RussR	What did you do precisely?
2010-11-06T03:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RussR	There is no way to "unformat" then. You may be able to recover some files with photorec.
2010-11-06T03:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RussR	No.
