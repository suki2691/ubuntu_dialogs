2011-12-03T08:52:00.000Z	atdiehm_lappy		installing ubuntu on a new asus zenbook ( i5 w/ SSD ) ... anything I should do to optimize ubuntu specially for this?
2011-12-03T08:53:00.000Z	thinker_	atdiehm_lappy	i'd still download the 32 bit version
2011-12-03T08:53:00.000Z	thinker_	atdiehm_lappy	other than that it should run quite smoothly
2011-12-03T08:54:00.000Z	atdiehm_lappy	thinker_	why 32 bit?
