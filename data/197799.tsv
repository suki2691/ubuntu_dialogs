2006-05-27T06:18:00.000Z	Alth		Quick question...I'm about to install Ubuntu on my desktop box, should I put it on my primary harddrive with Windows, or my secondary hard drive? They're both the same size and speed.
2006-05-27T06:18:00.000Z	spikeb	Alth	you can go ahead and put it on the secondary drive
2006-05-27T06:19:00.000Z	Alth	spikeb	does it make a difference?
2006-05-27T06:19:00.000Z	spikeb	Alth	not really
