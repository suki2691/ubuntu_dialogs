2012-08-30T02:12:00.000Z	Jay-		Ah thanks. But I wanted to ask some things about the interface, and suggestions for certain alternatives to Windows software
2012-08-30T02:13:00.000Z	Jay-		Is there any way to have a similar interface to Windows by having a horizontal taskbar at the bottom of the screen?
2012-08-30T02:14:00.000Z	Sokel	Jay-	Yes. Do not use unity. Problem solved.
