2012-04-02T19:39:00.000Z	markss		I havent been able to find anything that says what Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid will be doing for Thunderbird once Thunderbird 3.1 is End-Of-Life'd on 2012-04-24. Presumably upgrading to Thunderbird 11, but I would have expected that to have happened already, or at least be talked about like the Firefox 10 transition was. Anyone know if Lucid's Thunderbird will just be left at 3.1 or if there is an upgrade plan to Thunderbird 11? (Note this is for Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid).
