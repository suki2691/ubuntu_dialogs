2012-07-03T15:41:00.000Z	saurabh		Hello, I have created a project and setup a ppa on launchpad. I am using quickly to create my application. But when I try to push the code to launchpad, it created 12.07 version instead of 0.1 version
2012-07-03T15:41:00.000Z	saurabh		Can somebody help me to resolve this issue?
2012-07-03T15:42:00.000Z	fidel	saurabh	have you considered asking in #launchdpad
2012-07-03T15:43:00.000Z	saurabh	fidel	I thought this was a better place to ask for ubuntu development. Wait, I will ask there too...
