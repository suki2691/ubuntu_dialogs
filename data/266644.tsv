2009-05-08T02:37:00.000Z	pronik`		hello, has anyone experienced system stalling for a couple of minutes on jaunty?
2009-05-08T02:37:00.000Z	pronik`		it's happening every so often (four times this evening)
2009-05-08T02:38:00.000Z	pronik`		it seems connected to the disk activity somehow -- all disk reading/writing stall in that time too
2009-05-08T02:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pronik`	 next time it happens check the output of the 'dmesg' command its possible a hard drive is going out.
