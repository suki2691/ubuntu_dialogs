2005-04-18T10:29:00.000Z	thully		I have a question about ripping CDs - I've been ripping with lame, and this seems slower than iTunes on Windows.  Is it supposed to be like that?
2005-04-18T10:30:00.000Z	thully		OK - ripping then encoding with lame, I meant
2005-04-18T10:30:00.000Z	thully		what's that do?
