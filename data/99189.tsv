However, I'm still thinking of removing unity and installing Gnome3. I keep reading on all these issues with Gnome3 which is a bit disheartening. It seems that after installing Gnome3 you have to tweak it to get things that should have been there in the first place like a shutdown button.

2011-10-16T20:53:00.000Z	chowder	dr_willis	its a matter of personal preference
