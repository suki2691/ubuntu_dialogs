2012-07-09T05:14:00.000Z	JoseeAntonioR		guys: I've got two audio outputs on my laptop, is there any way to manage each one individually?
2012-07-09T05:14:00.000Z	Griffrez	JoseeAntonioR	I think the System Settings -> Sound gives you what you want.
2012-07-09T05:16:00.000Z	JoseeAntonioR	Griffrez	it does give me the option. It recognizes the headphones output and the Digital (S/PDIF) output, but I can only manage sound through the headphones output
2012-07-09T05:16:00.000Z	Griffrez	JoseeAntonioR	I don't know, then.
