2008-10-18T15:56:00.000Z	mirex		hi, I'd like to ask, how can I reuse downloaded deb packages on different machine, I'd like to avoid re-downloading all of the packages from internet. I tried to follow https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Personal but I don't see my packages in there. If I run Synaptic and flip to view by "Origin", I see there option "Local/main", but I see there only 4 of ~350 packages.
