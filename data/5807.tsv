2012-08-22T08:19:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Stralytic	ask in #windows
2012-08-22T08:20:00.000Z	Stralytic	cfhowlett	now there's an idea, i though a linux channel would be more helpful than a windows one though :D
2012-08-22T08:21:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Stralytic	I know there's a win8 developer forum, so irc seems likely.  good luck
