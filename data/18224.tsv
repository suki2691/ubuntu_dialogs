2011-02-16T02:19:00.000Z	MrMintanet		I am presently on an iBook G4 with 10.10 installed, and everything is running great.  I just wish I could enable 3D Compiz settings...  Anyone?  Anyone?
2011-02-16T02:19:00.000Z	BiPolah	MrMintanet	Have you got the settings manager, but they don't work?
2011-02-16T02:20:00.000Z	MrMintanet	BiPolah	Can you please stop and start at the beginning?
2011-02-16T02:20:00.000Z	BiPolah	MrMintanet	have you got the Compiz Settings Manager? sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
