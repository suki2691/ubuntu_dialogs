2009-11-10T05:49:00.000Z	krsna		any suggestions as how to enable swfdec? i installed the package swfdec-mozilla but it does not work..
2009-11-10T05:51:00.000Z	trism	krsna	you'll probably need to disable the official flash plugin to be able to use swfdec (Tools/Addons/Plugins)
2009-11-10T05:52:00.000Z	krsna	trism	i dont have any flashplayer installed currently
2009-11-10T05:54:00.000Z	krsna	trism	it seems in tools/addons/plugins of firefox no installation of an installed package as a plugin to firefox is possible (besides the fact that i use arora)
