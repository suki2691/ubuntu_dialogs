2008-01-19T14:33:00.000Z	fallingautumnlin	n30|laptop	edit manually /etc/apt/sources.list and search for errors on line 44 (from shell: sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list)
2008-01-19T14:37:00.000Z	n30|laptop	fallingautumnlin	- got it. i was looking at line 25 instead of 44. messed up something when i was manually editing the file. its fixed now :)
