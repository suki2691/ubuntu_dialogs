2006-07-11T11:58:00.000Z	t0dd		Hey.. I have a dell inspiron 5100, and I am trying to get ubuntu to properly identify my wireless card. I installed ndiswrapper correctly, and I can see there is activity when I view the connection; however, there is no signal and it is shown to be disconnected. " iwconfig " lists the device as well. Does anyone know what I need to finally acknowledge the connection?
