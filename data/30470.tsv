2011-02-14T04:37:00.000Z	Hellz_Bellz	boxbeatsy	it just runs the program only it frees itself from the terminal kinda
2011-02-14T04:38:00.000Z	Hellz_Bellz		it leaves the terminal available for your use instead of hogging it for output
2011-02-14T04:38:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	Hellz_Bellz	hmm yea i get that part, but is there any fundamental difference from the program's perspective
