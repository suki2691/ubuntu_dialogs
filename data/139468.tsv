2007-05-01T07:58:00.000Z	RedACE		I'm trying to follow Hoary's ClearType-like fonts howto here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=20976 but when I edit xorg.conf and reboot xdpyinfo output doesn't change. Anyone know why?
2007-05-01T07:59:00.000Z	LjL	RedACE	Hoary is not supported anymore
2007-05-01T08:00:00.000Z	RedACE	LjL	Well is there a way to make the fonts not blurry?
