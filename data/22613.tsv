2011-06-05T04:41:00.000Z	solteiro2		Hi I need help to create a User in my ubuntu linux to let the folks at my house or using a password and tals with a friend ... I wonder why I created using the command sudo adduser
2011-06-05T04:41:00.000Z	solteiro2		and when he went to boot error gave so much! pq this as I do?
2011-06-05T04:42:00.000Z	c2tarun	solteiro2	why did you used adduser? and I guess there is nothing like adduser, why didn't you use GUI?
2011-06-05T04:44:00.000Z	c2tarun	solteiro2	but adduser is for adding user to a group and not for creating accoutns
