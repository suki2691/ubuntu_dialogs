2010-02-08T22:56:00.000Z	sartan		Heya, what ubuntu script will update grubs menu.lst based on the installed kernels?  I had to delete a few in the interests of disk space, and would like to use something automatic to update the file
2010-02-08T22:56:00.000Z	Myrtti	sartan	how did you delete them?
2010-02-08T22:57:00.000Z	Myrtti	sartan	fine, ask the pixies for help then.
