2006-08-27T06:19:00.000Z	exs		I've installed all the correct codecs, my sound works, my wifi works, my video card ( on my motherboard ) works too ( using a laptop) BUT... My videos do not play. I understand that movies use a different visual layer on the screen (hence not being able to print screen) but I'm wondering what I should do to fix this. Thank you.
