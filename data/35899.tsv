2010-03-12T21:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	Darkstar1	i'd had issues in the past due to grub; allways ended up installed in the wrong mbr (installed with the ide drives unplugged)
2010-03-12T21:08:00.000Z	Darkstar1	erUSUL	 Thanks. I may have to unplug the IDE drive then it seems
2010-03-12T21:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	Darkstar1	if the problem is with grub then maybe that simlify things
2010-03-12T21:10:00.000Z	Darkstar1	erUSUL	 That was the initial issue but on the last attempt it refused to allocate the swap space from the partition specified
