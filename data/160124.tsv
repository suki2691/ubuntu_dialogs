2006-11-06T09:16:00.000Z	zircx	mzl1	because i want to try the kde enviroment in ubuntu
2006-11-06T09:18:00.000Z	mzl1	zircx	ubuntu is default gnome. kde should be kubuntu.
2006-11-06T09:19:00.000Z	zircx	mzl1	I'm well aware of that .. hence why I am asking howto install the kde desktop, I've already got gnome, I don't think there should be a need to download the kubuntu iso to install kde desktop..
