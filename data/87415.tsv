2008-06-17T18:51:00.000Z	Vlet_	Jack_Sparrow	mind you, I'm just making an educated guess, but I 'think' I'm right ;)
2008-06-17T18:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Vlet_	I was wondering why you would distro-upgrade when you were already on hardy
2008-06-17T18:55:00.000Z	Vlet_	Jack_Sparrow	yeah, seems like it would make more sense if they added something like 'full-upgrade'
