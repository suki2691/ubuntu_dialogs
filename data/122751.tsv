2008-02-07T07:26:00.000Z	zcat[1]		Just piakced up a cheap 2nd hand printer - lexmark x1150 .. when I plug it in, nothing happens :(
2008-02-07T07:26:00.000Z	zcat[1]		turns out lemark is about the most linux-hostile printer there is...
2008-02-07T07:27:00.000Z	nemilar	zcat[1]	yeah, that's the truth
2008-02-07T07:27:00.000Z	nemilar	zcat[1]	Lexmark printers are the win-modem equivilant of printers
