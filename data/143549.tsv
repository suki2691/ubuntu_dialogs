2008-04-29T11:54:00.000Z	AutoMatriX	reikon	you can name it a log, I guess, but which one ?
2008-04-29T11:55:00.000Z	reikon	AutoMatriX	/var/log, .bash_history, etc
2008-04-29T11:56:00.000Z	AutoMatriX	reikon	.bash_history, I knew, that's perfect for manual entered commands ... do you think I could find the rest in the /var/log direcorties ?
