2009-01-03T09:37:00.000Z	harriseldon	dr_willis	in my experience if the theme is stored in /usr/share/themes root apps like synaptic will pick it up, but if the theme is stored in ~/.themes then root apps use the default Gnome theme.
2009-01-03T09:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	harriseldon	 well the root user - couldent really be reading (well shouldent) be  accessiung user isnalled themes. :)  but  ages ago i just set the default root 'theme' colors to be bright red.. so i could tell which apps were being ran as root. I dont think  differently ran user apps can hafe for example different window-decorations,
