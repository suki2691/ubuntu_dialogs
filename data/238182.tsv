2009-09-08T17:09:00.000Z	xrfang		another quesiont, I removed a lot of packages from a ubuntu installation, as I intend to use it as server. Now it has problems: when I insert a usb hard disk,  the disk appears in nautilus, but is NOT mounted, and I cannot mount it in nautius (no folder appear under /media)
2009-09-08T17:09:00.000Z	xrfang		what package do I need to let ubuntu automatically mount external disks?
2009-09-08T17:09:00.000Z	amnesia	xrfang	none
2009-09-08T17:10:00.000Z	amnesia	xrfang	google /etc/fstab and see how to automaticly mount something
