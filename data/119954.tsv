2007-11-16T13:11:00.000Z	Gmac		quick question, ive got flashplugin-nonfree installed through the package manager, but Firefox still won't display flash (7.10)
2007-11-16T13:12:00.000Z	Gmac		do I have to do anything within FireFox to get Flash working?    (fresh 7.10 32bit install)
2007-11-16T13:14:00.000Z	bazhang	Gmac	did you have firefox running when you installed flash?
