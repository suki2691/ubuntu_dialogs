2007-02-12T06:46:00.000Z	idn		hi, I am trying to mount my housemates windows share using samba, it works fine if I specify a subdirectory to share, but there are quite a few. Is it possible to mount all directories in his share automatically?
2007-02-12T06:47:00.000Z	idn		sudo mount -t smbfs -o guest,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8,codepage=unicode,unicode  //matt/24 /mnt/matt
2007-02-12T06:47:00.000Z	idn		that works fine for example, but I want to moutn all directories not just the 24 one
