2011-05-28T12:26:00.000Z	vexati0n		why did Ubuntu invent Unity when it turns out Gnome3 does all that, and better?
2011-05-28T12:27:00.000Z	agrundner	vexati0n	good question. Just to be different, I guess.
2011-05-28T12:31:00.000Z	agrundner	vexati0n	I believe Ubuntu wants to pave its own path with Unity -- not do more of the same.
