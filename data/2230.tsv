2012-06-27T22:56:00.000Z	alberto-alt		I installed anthy for japanese inpuut but it doesn't show up in the configurable IMEs for iBus. Google doesn't know either. Any suggestions?
2012-06-27T22:57:00.000Z	trism	alberto-alt	did you restart ibus?
2012-06-27T23:01:00.000Z	trism	alberto-alt	did you just install anthy, or also ibus-anthy?
2012-06-27T23:07:00.000Z	alberto-alt	trism	Bingo, i was missing that package. Anthy up and running. Peace!
