2009-03-03T08:45:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Titan8990	mibbit is an untrusted client ?
2009-03-03T08:47:00.000Z	ibuclaw	Titan8990	it's probably best to ask one of the developers who implemented that feature into Floodbot, or read the comments in the code. Your answer may be there ;)
2009-03-03T08:48:00.000Z	Titan8990	ibuclaw	I wouldn't mind looking at the code, do you know what application is typically impletmented my floodbots?
