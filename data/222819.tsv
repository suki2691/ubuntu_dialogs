2007-06-01T16:39:00.000Z	Chicory		I have a friend in town whose MBR/GRUB died.
2007-06-01T16:39:00.000Z	Chicory		He's uninstalling Ubuntu and going with purely XP.
2007-06-01T16:39:00.000Z	Chicory		How can I fix his MBR using a LiveCD?
2007-06-01T16:40:00.000Z	mneptok	Chicory	the XP reinstall will write an Windows MBR
