2011-04-14T04:42:00.000Z	Visitt		Hello. This is my first day using Ubuntu. I'm not very knowledgeable of Linux in general. I have a number of questions. 1) I have 2 windows of Nautilus open. I select 2 files in one and Copy them. I can't seem to paste them to other Nautilus windows, or to desktop. What is up with that?
