2006-08-07T09:28:00.000Z	Linuturk		I've got a major problem. apt-get and symantic can't connect to the repos. I can ping the repos, but neither can download from them. Firefox and IRC work fine. I'm using network manager.
2006-08-07T09:28:00.000Z	andresmujica	Linuturk	maybe a proxy??
2006-08-07T09:28:00.000Z	Linuturk		no proxy
2006-08-07T09:30:00.000Z	Linuturk	andresmujica	no proxie, it's a direct connection. All other forms of network traffic work (ie Gaim, xchat, Firefox, ping)
