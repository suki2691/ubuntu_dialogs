2009-10-26T03:48:00.000Z	justfil		I got a problem with vlc media player, when I start some video it plays in its own window which annoys me very much :/ how can I set it to play in the vlc's window?

2009-10-26T03:51:00.000Z	trism	justfil	it seems to be updated to version 1.0.2 in karmic though, which will be released on thursday
2009-10-26T03:54:00.000Z	trism	justfil	I haven't tested it yet because I was too lazy to build vlc from source, but from what I heard it is supposed to be enabled again in version 1+
