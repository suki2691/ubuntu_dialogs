2011-05-19T13:41:00.000Z	Gump		my processor can support amd64 after all. can i get some thoughts on amd64 vs i386? is there really any reason to choose one over the other?
2011-05-19T13:41:00.000Z	Gump		i know amd64 generally utilizes ram better and can be faster, but it has compatibility problems. am i understanding this right?
2011-05-19T13:42:00.000Z	Gump		sweet. thats what i wanted to hear. thanks
2011-05-19T13:42:00.000Z	tsimpson	Gump	the only real reason is that amd64 natively supports >4GB of RAM (though i386 can too), and that when, eventually, x86 systems fade into obscurity, you won't have to install a 64bit version later
