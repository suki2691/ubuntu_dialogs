2006-12-18T17:20:00.000Z	sk4nK	A|arm	probably not, linux uses and reports memory usage in a quite different way to windows, so they seem large, but it's generally nothing to worry about (unless it's causing instability)

2006-12-18T17:21:00.000Z	A|arm	sk4nK	 i dont think thats a good way of memory managment. cause applications start to write on swap as well. and swap defenetely isnt that fast as ram
