2011-03-14T03:06:00.000Z	jxshxx		I just popped an SD card into my mini for the 1st time, resulting in a blank/frozen screen.  Running 10.04LTS.  Is there something I need to do before I can use that slot?
2011-03-14T03:06:00.000Z	Diamondcite	jxshxx	Was that popping in with the system already up and running?
2011-03-14T03:07:00.000Z	jxshxx	Diamondcite	Yes indeed
2011-03-14T03:08:00.000Z	Diamondcite	jxshxx	Er.. not my field.. please try someone else for card reader freezing the system
