2007-02-15T17:07:00.000Z	meredydd		Okay, new question. If I don't have a net connection, and I have to go with just what's on the CD, how much will " Ubuntu Feisty HERD-3 ALTERNATE ISO" have on it?
2007-02-15T17:08:00.000Z	LjL	meredydd	Feisty is not a stable release, and the channel to discuss the testing of it is #ubuntu+1. anyway, you'll have all packages that are dependencies of the "ubuntu-desktop" package. i'm afraid i can't get you a list right now, though
2007-02-15T17:10:00.000Z	meredydd	LjL	Rightie. (I'm aware of instability, please forgive.) So, that would give me a functioning window system, some apps, but, say, probably not a development toolchain?
2007-02-15T17:10:00.000Z	LjL	meredydd	quite correct. the alternate CD, however, *does* have GCC and friends on it, even though they're not installed by default (contrary to the Desktop CD, which doesn't have that at all)
