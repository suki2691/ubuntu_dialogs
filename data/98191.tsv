2008-03-07T16:10:00.000Z	mapkyca		hi folks... newbie question, trying to install on AMD 64bit with Nvidia 8400. Both 64bit and 32bit install fine, but boot up to a blank screen with a movable mouse cursor, anyone else seen this?
2008-03-07T16:11:00.000Z	allorder	mapkyca	both install fine but now on amd64 nothing ?
2008-03-07T16:12:00.000Z	mapkyca	allorder	on both 32bit and 64 bit versions I get the same problem (although on 64bit i get the missing splash screen issue that a lot of people get)
2008-03-07T16:15:00.000Z	mapkyca	allorder	in both cases the live cd works, but the installed version gives a blank screen where I'd expect the login, and a movable mouse cursor (with animation frozen). Keyboard seems unresponsive at this stage.
