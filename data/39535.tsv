2010-04-24T00:07:00.000Z	Losha	helo	was there some output from /etc/init.d/ssh stop ?
2010-04-24T00:08:00.000Z	Losha	helo	are you ssh'ed into the machine?
2010-04-24T00:10:00.000Z	Losha	helo	odd. If you ssh in, you fork a copy of sshd which runs as long as the connection is open. This allows you to restart e.g. an updated version of sshd while logged in via ssh...
