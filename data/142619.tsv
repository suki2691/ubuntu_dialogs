2007-03-22T07:53:00.000Z	Crescendo__		I'm trying to organize my MP3 collection.  Can anyone help with this idea:  If I could find a tool that would match my MP3 tags with last.fm, and move all the ones that didn't have a match into like, another folder, that would cut my work in half.

2007-03-22T07:55:00.000Z	Crescendo__	dimebar	I've not had much luck with ex falso either - does it support last.fm matching?
2007-03-22T07:58:00.000Z	dimebar	Crescendo__	ah, don't think so.  easytag may be more advanced for stuff like that but I'm not an expert
