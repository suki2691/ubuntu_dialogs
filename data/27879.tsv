2010-08-05T05:29:00.000Z	sparrW|2		I have requested apt-get to install some packages that require a lot of other packages to be uninstalled. I appear to be stuck with "apt-get -f install" removing those packages, and I don't want that. How can I "cancel" the operation that is pending?
2010-08-05T05:30:00.000Z	cousteau`live	sparrW|2	on my system, apt-get -f install also attempts to install or uninstall (can't remember) some packages
2010-08-05T05:30:00.000Z	sparrW|2	cousteau`live	I can't install anything else until I fix it
2010-08-05T05:33:00.000Z	sparrW|2	cousteau`live	I'm only maybe 3 packages away from getting a very conflicted package installed, and now I'm stuck
