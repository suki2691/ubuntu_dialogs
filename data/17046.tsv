2011-06-18T22:09:00.000Z	gNewPower		I just upgraded to U11.04.  Did not like Unity at all. When back to GNOME (aka "Ubuntu Classic).  Now I don't see compiz any more.  Since compiz is now part of Unity, does that mean that it is not available for GNOME?
2011-06-18T22:10:00.000Z	mrdeb	gNewPower	unity is compiz plugin. compiz is there
2011-06-18T22:10:00.000Z	gNewPower	mrdeb	where is the config menu for it then?
2011-06-18T22:11:00.000Z	mrdeb	gNewPower	it's not installed by default. you need to install two apps to get it to show up
