2007-12-29T23:20:00.000Z	Sammy88	Jordan_U_	The screen wents black, with light on. Then it shows a prompt like the station is locked: "Please enter your password" or something like that
2007-12-29T23:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	Sammy88	And if you try to enter your password?
2007-12-29T23:21:00.000Z	Sammy88	Jordan_U_	Then it logs me in and tells me (with a little popup in the right bottom corner) that suspending wasnt successfully done...
