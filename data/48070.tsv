2010-11-27T00:53:00.000Z	Dave_L		I just installed xchat-gnome.  I can't find the setting that caused it to automatically connect to #freenode and join #ubuntu.
2010-11-27T00:53:00.000Z	Alan502	Dave_L	didn't you add it to favorites?
2010-11-27T00:55:00.000Z	Alan502	Dave_L	go to xchat>network list , look for freenode and click edit
2010-11-27T00:59:00.000Z	Alan502	Dave_L	It isn't on favorite channels?
