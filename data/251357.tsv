2007-11-21T19:49:00.000Z	r3m0t	Super-Sonic-Sega	which network?
2007-11-21T20:13:00.000Z	r3m0t	Super-Sonic-Sega	if you don't give them any billing information, they can't charge you anything. it looks free to me
2007-11-21T20:14:00.000Z	r3m0t	Super-Sonic-Sega	well, they never guaranteed you it would work :-) I guess it doesn't work
