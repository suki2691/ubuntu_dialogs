2010-05-20T13:51:00.000Z	neil_d	yohannbzh	 from the terminal check if there is a file ending in '~'
2010-05-20T13:52:00.000Z	yohannbzh	neil_d	No, it is not here too
2010-05-20T13:53:00.000Z	neil_d	yohannbzh	 are you very sure you are looking in the correct place.. very strange the one file disappear let alone two.
