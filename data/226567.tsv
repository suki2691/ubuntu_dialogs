2006-01-27T09:47:00.000Z	vader		I have an old dual processor Compaq p1 200 with close to 1 gig of RAM, the problem is that when I go to install any version of Linux, it won't even get to the partitioner. I have tried Linux noauto and most of those little trix, does anyone have any suggestions as to what I can try to get passed this, I have even put in a different known good video card
