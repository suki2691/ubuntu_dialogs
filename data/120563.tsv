2007-11-24T08:49:00.000Z	tech0007	xexos	you can still use 32-bit ubuntu
2007-11-24T08:50:00.000Z	xexos	tech0007	what would you recommend
2007-11-24T08:51:00.000Z	tech0007	xexos	some apps dont have 64-bit compatibility in ubuntu yet, i use ubuntu gutsy w/ gnome and it works fine..you have a lot of choices to go with..like ubuntu or kubuntu w/ KDE
