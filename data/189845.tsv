2006-08-03T10:54:00.000Z	keleus		Under kubuntu, how do I get the REAL KDE control center back? (i dont like this watered-down one that comes with ubuntu)
2006-08-03T10:54:00.000Z	Warbo	keleus	"kcontrol"
2006-08-03T10:55:00.000Z	Warbo		Well my installation seems to be full of problems, but I will try booting it all the same
2006-08-03T10:56:00.000Z	keleus	Warbo	is there a way to permanetly and system-wide change the control back? instead of running kcontrol manually?
