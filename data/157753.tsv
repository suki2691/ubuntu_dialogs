2006-11-29T14:09:00.000Z	dfcarney		EdinNY: that's not totally true, is it?  I've had a case where I needed an initrd regardless because the majority of my modules/etc were on a RAID
2006-11-29T14:10:00.000Z	EDinNY	dfcarney	if you can build a kernel with ALL the modules needed to boot your computer you don't need an initrd...but that is not easy to do and if you do it it will be big
2006-11-29T14:11:00.000Z	EDinNY	dfcarney	I think so, so you might not be able to actually do it...I have not done it with the latest kernel, but used to do it with older kernels
