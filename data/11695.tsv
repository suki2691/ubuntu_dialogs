2011-12-22T23:01:00.000Z	gigenieks		OK guys what now?? Tcl (don't know what it is) seems to already exist in my system. What is next step?
2011-12-22T23:02:00.000Z	geoffmcc	gigenieks	why not sudo apt-get install scid
2011-12-22T23:03:00.000Z	gigenieks	geoffmcc	I don't know why. Maybe you can't install it that way. Or scid in repositories is older than in that site. Also autohor didn't mention to install that way - probably have a reason I guess....
