2009-02-27T07:29:00.000Z	gorlak		i have a question on how nfs reads writes/transfers files. i have a remote server, if i move/copy a file from one folder to the next it copies the file to my laptop first then sends it back to the server. is this normal? or is there a setting that keeps the file on the server instead. like smb/windows file copying does.
2009-02-27T07:29:00.000Z	gorlak		reason being is, i have 4-8 gig files i would like to move around on my remote server, and it would take a very long time to move them. unless i do it from vnc on the server itself
