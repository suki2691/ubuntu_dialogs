2010-06-20T17:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	zhs490770	 it was an issue (and over hyped) ages ago. and of debateable 'truth' back then.
2010-06-20T17:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	zhs490770	 the 'default' value was to use the hard drives 'default' - so it was actually the HD's makers default   settings that cuased the issue
2010-06-20T17:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	zhs490770	 if i rember right. Its really not an issue these days
