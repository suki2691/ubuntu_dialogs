2010-09-23T01:26:00.000Z	Doyle		Why isn't tcsh included by default with Ubuntu?
2010-09-23T01:26:00.000Z	losha	Doyle	cos it's kinda old and crufty. Just do 'sudo apt-get install tcsh'
2010-09-23T01:27:00.000Z	Doyle	losha	what's new and fancy?
2010-09-23T01:29:00.000Z	losha	Doyle	I suppose any recent version of bash. The one that comes by default with ubuntu should be fine...
