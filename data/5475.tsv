2012-02-25T04:43:00.000Z	pietro_		Hi. I'm running 11.04 because I don't want to move up to GNOME 3, Unity doesn't work right with enhanced zoom desktop in compiz, and other DEs don't have things I'd like (like no clicking on the laptop trackpad). I have to work with an SDL package that relies on SDL_ttf 2.0.10+, and the latest version available is 2.0.9. I can't remove it either, because it's a dependency of a number of programs I'd rather keep. What should I do? Thanks.

2012-02-25T04:45:00.000Z	urfr332gO	pietro_	at some point anyway.
2012-02-25T04:46:00.000Z	pietro_	urfr332gO	ok, thanks
