2010-12-15T21:28:00.000Z	slackguru		Last week I had notification from update-manager that Chromium Browser had critical updates but the updated package was not available in the repo I was using. I changed repos and the critical update was not listed. Today I switched to the MAIN SERVER to check to see if the previous notification was a false positive and it turns out it wasn't. Are the repos normally that out of sync?
