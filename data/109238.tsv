2010-09-29T19:15:00.000Z	ghostlines		i'm using my all of my download bandwidth, and accessing my server is going much slower than usual why is this i have 3mbit upload that's hardly being used

2010-09-29T19:18:00.000Z	ghostlines	mattgyver	hmm what kind of issue then? my upload is fine normally i don't have upload problems, this is the first time
2010-09-29T19:19:00.000Z	mattgyver	ghostlines	it might not be I just know in my experience i always find out at speedtest.net that my upload limit is really low and call the ISP and they say 'oh yeah somethings wrong'
