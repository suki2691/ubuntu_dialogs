2008-05-03T01:19:00.000Z	Lord_Devi	ArthurArchnix	I agree with that. i.e. the obvious; gentoo. Truely a great way to learn debuging skills, similair to slackware being great to learn 'standard' linux philosophy. but Ubuntu has gone through a lot of work to allow for customization, including kernels. Just I feel it is sometimes a neglected featureset.
