2012-01-23T01:45:00.000Z	daev_		anyone here experienced with xorg.conf?
2012-01-23T01:47:00.000Z	daev_		 I'm using the proprietary ati drivers at the moment and was hoping to use a different refresh rate. at the moment it's only got 60Hz available. However in windows permits higher. what would you suggest if not xorg?:]
2012-01-23T01:49:00.000Z	daev_		it's possible that 60Hz is all it actually supports then? as $ xrandr -q  says it's only 59.9 lol (can it be wrong?)
