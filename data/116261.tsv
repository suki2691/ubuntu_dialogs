2007-10-19T08:07:00.000Z	k0001	PvAdct_ubuntu	of course, since it only contains KDE apps,
2007-10-19T08:08:00.000Z	PvAdct_ubuntu	k0001	I mean as opposed to installing ubuntu and apt-getting all KDE
2007-10-19T08:11:00.000Z	k0001	PvAdct_ubuntu	of course, since after apt-geting kde, you will still keep the gnome/ubuntu stuff which has nothing to do with kde, and that will make your system completely bloated
