2006-10-21T11:22:00.000Z	sethk	Werdnum	xfce != x
2006-10-21T11:23:00.000Z	Werdnum	sethk	however, he wanted to install xubuntu, which uses xfce
2006-10-21T11:25:00.000Z	sethk	Werdnum	yes, I understand, and in fact suggested installing a desktop.  what I was responding to what the statement   "xfce is X", which I guess really meant to say "xfce is the only desktop I can install)
