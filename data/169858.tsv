2007-04-16T05:05:00.000Z	rasputnik	steven43126	it's easy with something like perl or ruby , don't know about the shell though.
2007-04-16T05:06:00.000Z	steven43126	rasputnik	i know i don't write shell scripts that often but i know there must be away of doing this through the shell, maybe sed? but i can only find options for replacing text etc etc not just outputting the matched pattern ?
