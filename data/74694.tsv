2009-05-21T08:17:00.000Z	Roasted		I'm seeing here Ubuntu is using two ways to add up the amount of data I'm using. System monitor uses GiB. Properties of a hard drive uses GB. Properties of my home directory says 171.4 GB while system monitor of the same disk says 184.1 GiB. Which one is more accurate to go by?
2009-05-21T08:18:00.000Z	phoenixz	Roasted	GiB should be factors of 1024, GB 1000..
2009-05-21T08:18:00.000Z	phoenixz	Roasted	both should be equally acurrate
2009-05-21T08:19:00.000Z	Roasted	phoenixz	- is there any way to change either style so I can have them BOTH be GB or GiB?
