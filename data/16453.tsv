2011-03-28T00:07:00.000Z	Enerccio		hello
2011-03-28T00:08:00.000Z	Enerccio		I am going to be very uncivil, but whoever thought that on the upgrade the ubuntu should replace grub already on the disk with its own should die in hell
2011-03-28T00:09:00.000Z	OerHeks	Enerccio	upgrade grub2 ?
2011-03-28T00:09:00.000Z	Enerccio	OerHeks	I just went with full upgrade, and it replaced my grub with its own, without asking for anything
