2008-01-07T05:47:00.000Z	ak5		hey all, when I boot the live cd (amd64) (even with safe grafics) it messes up somehow (no picture with normal boot & stuck at initscripts with safe-grafics) any ideas?
2008-01-07T05:49:00.000Z	ak5		I have trouble booting the live cd: it gets stuck at initscripts
2008-01-07T05:50:00.000Z	Derek_E	ak5	try cleaning the disk or writing at a slower speed?
2008-01-07T05:51:00.000Z	ak5	Derek_E	doesn't seem to be the problem, I reburnt cd 2x
