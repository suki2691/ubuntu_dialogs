2010-05-23T04:10:00.000Z	compaq		Guys I love Ubuntu, I had lots of fun, but I regret to say, I have reverted to Debian.  Why you ask?  Well, Ubuntu wouldn't support compiz on my intel graphics card(it was blacklisted) but on debian it was not.

2010-05-23T04:13:00.000Z	compaq	Beyecixramd	I couldn't unblacklist it, I even tried karmic cause it gives you the option to run some command that allows you to use blacklisted video cards, but it still didn't run
