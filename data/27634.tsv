2010-08-12T01:06:00.000Z	remoteaccess		Hi there. I'm using X11 window forwarding with SSL to use linux apps remotely on a Windows (work machine.
2010-08-12T01:07:00.000Z	remoteaccess		I find it's quite slow and am looking for abit of direction regarding testing the speed that SSL is achieving between my server and my Work machine.
2010-08-12T01:08:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	remoteaccess	it's "SSH" not SSL, and try using compression (the -C option)
2010-08-12T01:09:00.000Z	remoteaccess	ilovefairuz	I was thinking about trying that in the future but I really want to test the upload speed.
