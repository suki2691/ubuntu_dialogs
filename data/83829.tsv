2009-02-27T00:40:00.000Z	kristian_		what is the following: vlc-plugin-esd, mozilla-plugin-vlc?
2009-02-27T00:42:00.000Z	lstarnes	kristian_	vlc-plugin-esd allows vlc to use esd for sound.  mozilla-plugin-vlc allows firefox to embed vlc for certain media
2009-02-27T00:44:00.000Z	kristian_	lstarnes	: i did a "sudo apt-get install vlc" just now, but when reading on vlc official page it say to install vlc-plugin-esd and mozilla-plugin-vlc, i was just wondering if i need any of this if im just using vlc for .avi (xvid) and .mp3 and possibly flac.
