2008-05-07T20:23:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Kl4m	Who are the Ubuntu devs to override what the manufacturer suggests to be a good power setting? The ability is there for you to override the power settings, but Ubuntu doesn't do it by default, and probably never will. My suggestion: get better hardware, or fiddle with the power settings manually.
