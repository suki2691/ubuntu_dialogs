2009-09-20T19:57:00.000Z	Chun1		Hi, wonder if anyone can help: I'm having problems getting my Toshiba Satellite laptop to sleep - all that happens is that the screen goes to black (backlight still on) with a blinking cursor -- and the only apparent way to get out of that is a hard reboot

2009-09-20T19:58:00.000Z	Chun1	benn	I have 2gb of swap space on the hard drive, if that's what you mean
