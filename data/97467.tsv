2008-11-23T10:07:00.000Z	jazzyditty		Dr_Willis, since you just mentioned hard drives, is it possible to boot/install ubuntu with an external? I don't have xp anymore. Wiped it last night thinking everything would go smoothly, and now I'm stuck running livecd.
2008-11-23T10:09:00.000Z	jazzyditty		Is there a better way to go about it? I can't burn anything to disc since the only thing i can wrong without error is livecd.
2008-11-23T10:10:00.000Z	jazzyditty		Is there a number I can call to get customer service regarding ubuntu?
