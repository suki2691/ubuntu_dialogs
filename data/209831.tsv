2007-09-26T08:26:00.000Z	LjL	osiris_the_virus	sudo apt-get install subversion
2007-09-26T08:27:00.000Z	LjL	osiris_the_virus	that's because the package is called "subversion". use "apt-cache search <keywords>" when you're unsure what the name of a package is.
2007-09-26T08:28:00.000Z	LjL	osiris_the_virus	if you're trying to get SVN in order to compile and install software from source, however... have you made sure that there is not a package available for what you need?
