2005-04-29T13:31:00.000Z	Scuddie		Perhaps someone can tell me why my sound configuration reports the OSS device as a Realtek ALC650f?
2005-04-29T13:33:00.000Z	Scuddie		I honestly had no idea Realtek has anything to do with nVidia's MCP-T audio chipset
2005-04-29T13:34:00.000Z	St0n3-C0l	Scuddie	Realtek makes LAN devices ?
