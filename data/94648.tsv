2008-05-21T12:42:00.000Z	chmac		Can anyone give me any pointers on what to search for? I'd like my current app to remain "current" when I click a firefox link, but firefox to load the link in the background.
2008-05-21T12:42:00.000Z	chmac		I'm not sure what these things are actually called, "current" is a kinda generic term!
2008-05-21T12:43:00.000Z	proqesi	chmac	right-click on the link and select "open link in new tab"
2008-05-21T12:43:00.000Z	chmac	proqesi	Sorry, I mean web links from other applications, say in an evolution email
