2008-04-24T23:19:00.000Z	rlj__		i have a amd64 laptop which is starving at 512MB memory, and i'm about to reinstall ubuntu. previously ran the 32bit version. are there any benefits with running 64bit linux performance-wise, since I have such limited memory anyway. or will the performance actually be worse? also, since some (proprietary) stuff is still only usable on 32bit, i guess i'm really asking if there's any use running 64bit at all for me?

2008-04-24T23:20:00.000Z	Assid	rlj__	it can ACCESS more ram
2008-04-24T23:21:00.000Z	rlj__	Assid	yeah that's what i thought. i suppose kernel pages are bigger and as all addresses use 64bits, i'll be addressing the RAM with a ton of useless bits.
