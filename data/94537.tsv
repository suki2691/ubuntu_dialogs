2008-04-17T03:13:00.000Z	ouellettesr	jewjew	probably going from vesa driver back to nvidia driver, but i did it before and got back to normal, this time i cant
2008-04-17T03:16:00.000Z	jewjew	ouellettesr	I'm no help with nvidia drivers.  The first thing I'd do is reinstall them, maybe check and make sure everything is kosher in your xorg.conf
2008-04-17T03:27:00.000Z	ouellettesr	jewjew	thanks for the tip, as it turned out I was using the failsafe xorg.conf, I then used "dexconf" to generate a new xorg.conf file.
