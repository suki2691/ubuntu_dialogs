2007-05-19T05:31:00.000Z	arceye		After adding a line to xorg.conf  I run the command to make it auto update again but this then removes the line I added is this because I am in X at the time?
2007-05-19T05:33:00.000Z	arceye		what is an easy to use text editor for use without X running ?  I can't use vi and don't know what else there is
