2012-07-28T22:54:00.000Z	help2man		I have noticed you have alot of different programs in your ubuntu repo's but I was wondering how ubuntu went about setting this up. Did alot of the software get mirrored over from gnu/fsf/savannah 60,000 projects ... because I cann't imagine all that could was written from scratch by ubuntu ?
2012-07-28T22:54:00.000Z	help2man		since alot of software when I go thru it in ubuntu is also in gnu repos
2012-07-28T22:56:00.000Z	help2man		I guess is there away to determine or only view the software that is different then the gnu /fsf /savannah ,....etc already built code that was just mirrored over the stuff that was created new for ubuntu
