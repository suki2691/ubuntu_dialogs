2006-12-30T08:59:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet		I just want a simple email retreival system for all me and the wifes pop accounts (gmail and the like) .. then to allow us to access it both via online (squirrelmail like) or via T-bird/Evoloution and when we send mail from our web sites it should have the user@websitename.com on it .. why is that so hard?
