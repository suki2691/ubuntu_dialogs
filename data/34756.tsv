2010-10-02T13:19:00.000Z	AngryParsley		I upgraded to maverick on my netbook and now ubuntu shows a login screen (it used to auto-log in) and if I click on my username and type my password, the screen goes blank for a second and prints some text, then shows the login screen again
2010-10-02T13:19:00.000Z	AngryParsley		the text goes by too quickly for me to read it
2010-10-02T13:19:00.000Z	AngryParsley		but it looks like some sort of error
2010-10-02T13:20:00.000Z	moetunes	AngryParsley	 sounds like a graphics issue - #ubuntu+1 for maverick tho
