2008-02-04T15:01:00.000Z	Kevin`	alanbshepard71	simplest is to put it in /etc/rc.local. but yes, how do you think everything gets started on startup?
2008-02-04T15:03:00.000Z	alanbshepard71		Kevin': from what I gather there is a startup script with a list of commands to run (at some point in the boot process), I just want to add a command to that list, unless of course I'm way off.
2008-02-04T15:07:00.000Z	alanbshepard71	Kevin`	is rc.local run after gnome is started? I'm trying to make avant window manager start automatically.
