2007-08-26T07:19:00.000Z	KurtKraut	robbomx	it depends on your soundcard manufacturer. Have you searched by your model name in ubuntuforums.org ?
2007-08-26T07:29:00.000Z	robbomx	KurtKraut	hi it's me again, the Envy sound card i run  has got compatibility problems, but i haven't found an answer yet
2007-08-26T07:31:00.000Z	KurtKraut	robbomx	your issue is a bit too complicated to be dealed in real time chat. Consider posting in the ubuntuforums.org a detailed post asking for help.
