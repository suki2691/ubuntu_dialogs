2007-04-02T07:24:00.000Z	freeware_xp	hidan	whats the question?
2007-04-02T07:27:00.000Z	freeware_xp	hidan	i would try a different flavour, like mint
2007-04-02T07:29:00.000Z	freeware_xp	hidan	every flavour is different, different drivers etc, it might just be a driver issue, hey mint is a live / install cd, so you try before install
