2006-08-06T09:43:00.000Z	jared		hey guys i ran dist-upgrade and got all the way through and got the error E: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?
2006-08-06T09:43:00.000Z	jared		 what is the syntax for --fix missing
2006-08-06T09:44:00.000Z	jared		make sure you have j2re1.5 installed first
2006-08-06T09:44:00.000Z	bruenig	jared	it appears to say run apt-get --fix-missing, i might be misreadin git though
