2007-12-08T04:29:00.000Z	ikonia	taff	why do I need easy ubuntu ?
2007-12-08T04:31:00.000Z	ikonia	taff	I am perfectly capable of installing flash, re-read my original question of why I wanted someone to do a test .
2007-12-08T04:33:00.000Z	ikonia	taff	I believe the md5sum of the tar file used in the ubuntu meta package has changed on the adobe site, however I'd like someone to try a clean install of flash to verify that it is not my mirror issuing an outdated package and that the md5 has changed as there is no bug launched
