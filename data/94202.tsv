2008-08-23T22:19:00.000Z	phirestalker		my friend burnt me a cd of pictures, but it takes forever to load in nautilus. I typed cdck in a terminal and it said "! TOC and lseek() return different information about size.." am I right to assume that this is the problem? and if so how can I fix it (make a clean copy of the disc maybe?)

2008-08-23T22:26:00.000Z	phirestalker	bazhang	sorry to hijack, but doesn't that k9copy ONLY remove css and none of the newer protections like anydvd does or has it been updated?
2008-08-23T22:27:00.000Z	bazhang	phirestalker	not sure as I have not tried that with the latest DRM
