2009-03-18T22:16:00.000Z	cast	kitche	xen runs on the bare metal, what do you mean needs a host system? it needs a dom0 to be useful, sure
2009-03-18T22:17:00.000Z	cast	kitche	wouldn't refer to dom0 as a host system though, seeing as dom0 is running ontop of xen
2009-03-19T02:50:00.000Z	kitche	cast	hmm then what is called a domU?
