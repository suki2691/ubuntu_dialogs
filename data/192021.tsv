2006-07-23T09:40:00.000Z	amadeo1988		I have a question, When i installed ubuntu at first i could see my other ntfs partitions in the places > computer, but due to mounting issues i was told to change the mount place and now they dont appear there. How do i make my ntfs paritions appear there now? atm the only thing that appears there is CD/DVD Rom, Floppydisk, Filesystems
