2008-04-17T17:53:00.000Z	Flyzoola		can I use the command "sudo rm /media/disk/.Trash-root" to delete the folder? or do I need to go further into the directory to remove?

2008-04-17T17:57:00.000Z	Flyzoola	hischild	what do you mean? there's folders (but they're read only) in the .Trash-root folder. That's what i need to get rid of. How do I type in the command? "sudo rm -r /media/disk/.Trash-root"?
2008-04-17T17:58:00.000Z	hischild	Flyzoola	that'd be correct yes
