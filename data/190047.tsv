2011-04-30T00:21:00.000Z	Ahmuck		I'd like to drop back to gnome, how?
2011-04-30T00:23:00.000Z	Ahmuck		is there a proceedure for removing unity?
2011-04-30T00:24:00.000Z	fliegenderfrosch	Ahmuck	do you want to completely remove it or just use the traditional desktop? if itâ€™s the latter, just chose "traditional gnome desktop" at login
