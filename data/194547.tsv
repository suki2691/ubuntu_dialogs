2007-06-21T14:28:00.000Z	VSpike		My wife needs to write school reports - basically a standard form on A5 paper with a few fields (name, exam mark, place) that change, plus the main text field ("Must try harder, etc.")  I used to just use MS Word templates for this.  I avoided mail merge in MS Office because it's so hideous to set up.  Is there a neat way to do this kind of thing with free software?

2007-06-21T14:29:00.000Z	VSpike		Wondering if there's an even more nifty solution
