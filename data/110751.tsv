2007-12-06T00:28:00.000Z	pike_		but both fall short
2007-12-06T00:29:00.000Z	pike_		the azureus project did alot for torrent clients i guess but i wouldnt run it unless i had loads or ram to spare like a 4 gig system or something
2007-12-06T00:30:00.000Z	robeph	pike_	I still say,  rtorrent (the cli torrent app)  is prolly the best /least overhead,   and fastest running
