2007-11-02T04:19:00.000Z	Guerra		Okay. I need some help. I want to triple boot. Drive C is 100% for XP, and drive D is partitioned, 10 for ubuntu root, 60 for home, 20 for swap, and 80 I want to put to vista. However, vista won't let me install on that 80 gb, and I'm not sure why.
2007-11-02T04:19:00.000Z	Guerra		Any ideas?
2007-11-02T04:19:00.000Z	Guerra		I already have XP and Ubuntu, and I want to install vista in that 80 gb space.
2007-11-02T04:19:00.000Z	fujin_	Guerra	because it's Vista?
