2012-02-12T23:37:00.000Z	mikem94590		Question: The 3.2.5 kernel seems to be available (http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.2.5-precise/) for Precise, but I'm on Oneiric.  Is there anything wrong with installing it on Oneiric?
2012-02-12T23:37:00.000Z	ikonia	mikem94590	is there a reason you need/want it ?

2012-02-12T23:38:00.000Z	ikonia	mikem94590	it's designed for use with precise, running it on another version is not recommended
