2009-01-30T14:56:00.000Z	Hyphenex	dr4g	try sudo - (with the dash)
2009-01-30T14:57:00.000Z	dr4g	Hyphenex	sudo - gives me a syntax error. su - doesn't do anything.
2009-01-30T14:59:00.000Z	Hyphenex	dr4g	boot from a live D I guess and fix the file then :P
2009-01-30T14:59:00.000Z	dr4g	Hyphenex	that's also an option but i need access to this development server ASAP and can't waste time downloading the ISO
