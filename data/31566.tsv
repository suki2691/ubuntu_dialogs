2010-06-01T21:02:00.000Z	MichaelKohler		is there any way to compress a rar file better than just "rar -m5"? that compresses a 122MB file just to a 121.6MB rar
2010-06-01T21:03:00.000Z	iantlopp	MichaelKohler	what kind of a file are you trying to comrpess, as it seems that's likely with already compressed files, i.e. a video
2010-06-01T21:04:00.000Z	iantlopp	MichaelKohler	.jpg files are already compressed... there's no real way to get them much smaller...
2010-06-01T21:04:00.000Z	MichaelKohler	iantlopp	onetinsoldier: ah okay, thanks for the help :)
