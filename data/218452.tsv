2005-09-20T16:22:00.000Z	galorin		I'm using the latest kubuntu.  Is there anything that I need to do in orer to get cd recording to work?
2005-09-20T16:22:00.000Z	guillem101	galorin	use k3b (or install it if not yet available)
2005-09-20T16:22:00.000Z	galorin	guillem101	it complained about not having cdrdao, I installed that, but k3b can't see the drive.
2005-09-20T16:22:00.000Z	galorin	guillem101	cdrecord also fails.  I'm calling it by cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc and it seems like cdrecord locks up
