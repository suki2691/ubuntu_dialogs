2007-08-25T11:48:00.000Z	z0rz	doorsman	Something that is .tar.gz could be a binary or source code.. it could be also something else (it's essenitial just a comprossed archive) .. you can probably open with the GUI though..

2007-08-25T11:49:00.000Z	z0rz	doorsman	Well I can.. The only thing I can think of that I did was intalll rar (or was it unrar?) try sudo apt-get install rar
