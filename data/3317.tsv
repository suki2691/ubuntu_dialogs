2012-05-03T07:15:00.000Z	vexaxv		hey i have a question for you guys
2012-05-03T07:16:00.000Z	vexaxv		the fps has a noticeable difference from windows too linux no matter what gpu (is what ive come to understand) and im guessing its the drivers so whats up with this
2012-05-03T07:17:00.000Z	vexaxv		can someone help me figure out why the drivers cause such a fps drop from windows to ubuntu?
2012-05-03T07:17:00.000Z	wile-nilee	vexaxv	it is other or something other, and a custom install is not needed per say.
