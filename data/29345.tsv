2010-09-14T07:24:00.000Z	[Adam|Miner]		I installed ubuntu, then windows 7 on another partition, but windows overwrote grub (so I can't get into ubuntu), how can I still be dual bootable (either with grub or any other bootloader)
2010-09-14T07:25:00.000Z	trojan_spike	[Adam|Miner]	reinstall grub
2010-09-14T07:25:00.000Z	[Adam|Miner]	trojan_spike	How?
2010-09-14T07:31:00.000Z	[Adam|Miner]	trojan_spike	Alright, one last question, is 10.10 beta using grub legacy or 2?
