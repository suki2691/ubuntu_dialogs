2009-09-15T21:50:00.000Z	bro_		hey guys, can i update my nautilus in hardy to the version from jaunty? i'd like to have the "compact view"
2009-09-15T21:50:00.000Z	seidos	bro_	probably but I've never done it
2009-09-15T21:50:00.000Z	bro_		hi seidos. i too downgraded to hardy. the video problems are gone now
2009-09-15T21:51:00.000Z	bro_	seidos	just that i got used to some goodies in jaunty, now hardy looks so old...
