2008-03-19T03:36:00.000Z	Gladiator		Hi there. I managed to get ubuntu up and running off the live CD by removing "Quiet" and "Splash" from the startup options and adding "noapic acpi=off", and install it. Now when I try to start it up off my HD, it gets stuck about... I dunno, 15% of the way loading.
2008-03-19T03:37:00.000Z	Gladiator		Any way to fix that that anyone knows of?
