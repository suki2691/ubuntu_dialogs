2008-06-23T09:36:00.000Z	ganymede	Lenaud01	use alsamixer or gnome-mixer to bring up the mixer levels
2008-06-23T09:37:00.000Z	ganymede	Lenaud01	are there any controls for a 20 dB speaker boost or anything further right along the mixer?
2008-06-23T09:38:00.000Z	ganymede	Lenaud01	also might want to try alsamixer. alsamixer exposes more controls. even if master is at 100%, PCM or something else might not be full
