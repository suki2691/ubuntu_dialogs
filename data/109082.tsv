2007-12-23T08:22:00.000Z	RandyboY		Could anyone tell me why my SB Live sound card wount work in ubuntu? It worked in xubuntu... I have one 3,5mm jack in the card and two composite(red and white) in my amplifier in one cable.
2007-12-23T08:23:00.000Z	Stormx2	RandyboY	both xubuntu and ubuntu use the same sound drivers
2007-12-23T08:24:00.000Z	RandyboY	Stormx2	then its my brand new computer ubuntu doesnt like? Cause its the same card(picked it out of the xubuntu machine)
2007-12-23T08:24:00.000Z	Stormx2	RandyboY	could be a motherboard issue I suppose
