2007-04-21T14:38:00.000Z	Stig		Hi. I am new to Ubuntu and I am trying to add a folder to my usr folder, but it is saying "You do not have permissions to write to this folder." Does this mean I need to be logged in as root? If so, how do I login as root to do this?!
2007-04-21T14:40:00.000Z	Stig		it's actually in usr > share > cairo-clock, I just want to add a theme for it...
2007-04-21T14:41:00.000Z	Stig		Im not trying to create a new folder. I am trying to move a folder containing themes for cairo-clock into the cairo-clock folder.
