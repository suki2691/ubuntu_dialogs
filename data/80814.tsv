2009-01-16T15:45:00.000Z	koshar2	sarmisak	iam beginning to see why i prefer the partimage methood, although rsync, tar and cp with preservation are flexable and fast if you want to downsize partition size before rather than after a move
2009-01-16T15:48:00.000Z	sarmisak	koshar2	yes, that's another path you can take, I have never had to move to another disk like this, I usually install on a new disk and reinstall all packages from scratch, and just move the /etc/, so everything works like a charm
