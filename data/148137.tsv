2007-01-31T10:05:00.000Z	slyfox		Need help. Whenever I turn on Mplayer and try to play a video file, I have video and audio, but there is always this error message that pops up: "Requested audio codec family [mp3]  9afm=mp3lib) not available. Enable it at compaliation."   What do I do ?

2007-01-31T10:08:00.000Z	slyfox	pbureau	any more details? Do I go and get it in synaptic ? or what ?
2007-01-31T10:08:00.000Z	pbureau	slyfox	I would check on the mplayer web site first to make sure...most have forums with q&a that probably answer this question in details
