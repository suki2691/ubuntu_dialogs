2007-07-15T11:52:00.000Z	btsdev		Does anyone know how to make larger-resolution framebuffers properly align to the screen? (my prompt is mostly off the screen with a 1280x1024 fb)
2007-07-15T10:29:00.000Z	btsdev		question... i know it doesn't *really* matter, but if i have a storage drive, for consistency's sake with the "Ubuntu Way," should i put it at /media/storage or /mnt/storage?
