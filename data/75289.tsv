2009-09-18T20:56:00.000Z	utlo		I'm doing some work where we are remotlly detecting security vulnerblites in out of date packages.  In doing demonstrations I want to have a machine set up with old packages, but all our machines right now are up to date
2009-09-18T20:56:00.000Z	utlo		Is their a way to roll back packages easily with apt or do I have to install things manually?
2009-09-18T20:58:00.000Z	utlo		cool thanks
