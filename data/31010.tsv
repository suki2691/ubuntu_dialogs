2011-01-06T12:32:00.000Z	somethinginteres		hi all, got a bit of a problem. Ubuntu reports my "Filesystem root" is almost full. I had the same error today and removed a large number of stuff, even moving my files in /home to another drive and that left 2.8GB free. I'm now getting reports of only 384MB being free. Any ideas what's going on? I've already run Comp Janitor
