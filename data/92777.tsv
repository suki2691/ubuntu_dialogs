2008-11-18T00:56:00.000Z	rconan		can anyone tell me how to apply a kde colour scheme to kde apps running under ubuntu? I have systemsettings installed but the options for colour aren't there
2008-11-18T00:57:00.000Z	fde	rconan	ask in #kubuntu or #kde about what the kcm for the color theme is called
