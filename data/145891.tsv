2007-02-13T15:39:00.000Z	Hopposai	tretle	i think its in ntfs-3g mackage in multiverse
2007-02-13T15:40:00.000Z	Hopposai	tretle	not sure on that, it may not be. depends on how the community reacts to it. enabling ntfsread-write by default can have SERIOUS consequences
2007-02-13T15:41:00.000Z	Hopposai	tretle	ntfs-3g is pretty mature, but anything that touches NTFS is bound to be unstable.
