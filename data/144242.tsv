2007-04-22T12:59:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash		I cannot start x because my nvidia kernel module and my nvidia driver have different versions. The driver is the latest driver, and the kernel version is the second most recent. I want to keep the latest driver, how can I fix this situation?
2007-04-22T13:01:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash		After reading the ssh howto, and seeing that there shouldn't be anything additional to do after installing openssh-server, I've got an issue, I can't connect via ssh, connections time out. I'm using putty on windows, going to a lan computer, that I can ping. The connection worked fine under edgy, but after installing feisty, it no longer works.

2007-04-22T13:05:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	DShepherd	it all matches up in there, I think that it fixed itself after a full reboot, rather than just restarting x, because my x now starts up fine and I can get my glxinfo out of it
