2008-12-08T16:13:00.000Z	koshar1	[c0re]	you mean add it to the panel, or did you uninstall it completely?
2008-12-08T16:14:00.000Z	[c0re]	koshar1	 uninstall it completely
2008-12-08T16:16:00.000Z	koshar1	[c0re]	i would suspect you would have to reinstall the ubuntu-desktop metapackage otherwise you may be able to isolate the packages checking synaptic > menu > history
