2008-11-03T22:43:00.000Z	unop	jamieyg3	use sudo
2008-11-03T22:44:00.000Z	jamieyg3	unop	that seemed to work thanks, but why?
2008-11-03T22:45:00.000Z	unop	jamieyg3	because you as a user don't have write access over /etc/passwd - only root has - running a command under sudo makes the command run as root effectively.
