2009-05-28T06:31:00.000Z	robbon33		hello, i've installed ubuntu with a language 1 and i wanted a language 2, so i downloaded and installed language 2 and started using it right away, is it possible for me to delete language 1?

2009-05-28T06:34:00.000Z	VCoolio	robbon33	found it? you can also do alt-F2 and run gnome-language-selector
