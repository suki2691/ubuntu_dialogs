2012-08-13T01:34:00.000Z	crimsonmane		Greetings. I am using a dual-boot, Maverick on one HD, WinXP on another. The windows side has become infected with a virus (malware/spyware, pick a term these days right?). What is the best approach to clean the windows side? I scanned that HD with ClamAV but nothing turned up.
2012-08-13T01:36:00.000Z	crimsonmane		you don't understand. the windows side is not usable, even in safe mode
2012-08-13T01:36:00.000Z	xangua	crimsonmane	for windows support /join ##windows
2012-08-13T01:36:00.000Z	crimsonmane	xangua	it's actually ubuntu support, since i'm using ubuntu, isn't it?
