2010-04-14T06:48:00.000Z	^b0ss^		surely you can do it from the gui?
2010-04-14T06:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	^b0ss^	 i find it much SAFER to use the CLI. ive seen peopel running nautilus as root have at times really messed up their systems.
2010-04-14T06:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	^b0ss^	 you do realize you could just use the users own personal xchat directories.. theres no real need to copy it syst4mwide.
