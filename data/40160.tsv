2009-12-25T05:19:00.000Z	Shanthi		How to add podcasts to the device ? Amarok 2.2.0 KDE 4.3.2 on Ubuntu Karmic (9.10): I subscribed to podcasts and they are in Home->Playlists->Podcasts. However, I can't find a way to add it to ipod or how to synchronize with the ipod automatically. I managed to get my ipod showing under 'Home->Local Music'.
