I was thinking of removing almost all packages from sarge, changing repositories update; dist-upgrade, install ubuntu-desktop, run bash script to add any custom packages and make any custom changes, but hardest part with that is removing all the packages I possibly can without breaking apt

I'm doing this on a pilot machine so I can see how hard it will be to make the switch. with the recent debian holdup on etch my boss gave me the go ahead to start working on a migration path
