2010-02-11T18:23:00.000Z	zicho		i recently installed the latest ubuntu, and when I try to start rhythmbox it closes instantly. the output says "The program 'rhythmbox' received an X Window System error.", how can i fix this?
2010-02-11T18:24:00.000Z	pts_	zicho	check out /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2010-02-11T18:24:00.000Z	pts_	zicho	you can also try to run rythmbox from a terminal to see the output
2010-02-11T18:25:00.000Z	zicho	pts_	i did do that
