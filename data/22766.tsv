2010-11-13T12:10:00.000Z	lea123		what should I choose for the Bootloader ?? should it be installed on SDA or sda5,sda6 which is the partions for linux including the swap file area
2010-11-13T12:11:00.000Z	jep1985	lea123	you can install GRUB to SDA
2010-11-13T12:11:00.000Z	jep1985		it will install it to your MBR
2010-11-13T12:13:00.000Z	lea123	jep1985	Do you mean to say its a mistake to install on the SDA5 where drive was partioned to install Linux and that is the reason why it isn't giving me an option to boot into linux
