2011-05-01T03:04:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Senix	if you double-click it, it should run
2011-05-01T03:07:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Senix	generally speaking, files ending in .run are executable scripts (make sure that it's marked executable)
2011-05-01T03:07:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Senix	you can do this by right-clicking and going to properties
