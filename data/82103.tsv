2008-08-17T04:04:00.000Z	[mbm]		can anyone answer a quick question about the upstart boot order?
2008-08-17T04:05:00.000Z	[mbm]		the upstart init scripts have the metainit section with the "required-start" and "required-stop" .. the $remote_fs doesn't seem to be working properly as a requirement - where is $remote_fs defined
2008-08-17T04:06:00.000Z	Flannel	[mbm]	Try #upstart
2008-08-17T04:15:00.000Z	[mbm]	Flannel	doesn't seem to be any life in #upstart
