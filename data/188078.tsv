2008-11-13T01:01:00.000Z	daddyx		Hello has anyone installed cdemu by source?
2008-11-13T01:03:00.000Z	daddyx		cdemu compile by source ->  make[3]: *** [cdemud-daemon.o] Error 1    ...any hint???
2008-11-13T01:04:00.000Z	Winkie	daddyx	the actual error will be slightly higher up, but here's probably not the place to get help
2008-11-13T01:06:00.000Z	Winkie	daddyx	i really don't, i'd look for a channel specific to that software, but some sort of C programming channel would be my next bet
