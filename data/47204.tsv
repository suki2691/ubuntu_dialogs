2011-06-17T14:33:00.000Z	tasslehoff		Is there a way I can give a system account a home folder? I need the Jenkins user to have ssh-keys.
2011-06-17T14:34:00.000Z	llutz_	tasslehoff	you can specify any key-location you want with ssh
2011-06-17T14:35:00.000Z	tasslehoff	llutz_	yeah, but I have no way (in Jenkins) to specify the key location on the command line, so I need to get Jenkins a ~/.ssh/config directory
2011-06-17T14:36:00.000Z	llutz_	tasslehoff	read "man usermod" then (-a -d ...   iirc)
