2012-05-12T05:41:00.000Z	Fred219		I have purged and reinstalled unity, but still have no top panel or launcher and the same error when trying to restart unity.
2012-05-12T05:42:00.000Z	njuettner	Fred219	so a unity --reset didn't help?
2012-05-12T05:44:00.000Z	Fred219	njuettner	no, it drops all window decorations gives the "warn failed to receive configurenotify event" error and just hangs
