2006-08-13T13:01:00.000Z	DamianFinol	corevette	Easily? boot windows recovery, and type: fixmbr then resize or delete the linux partitions
2006-08-13T13:02:00.000Z	corevette	DamianFinol	last time i did that, grub didn't uninstall
2006-08-13T13:03:00.000Z	DamianFinol	corevette	 Then I wouldn't know, ask Microsoft.
