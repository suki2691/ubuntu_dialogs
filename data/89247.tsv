2012-07-29T15:05:00.000Z	fragged		Hey all, I installed xbuntu 12.04, and managed to nuke my windows XP partition, how do I get it back, and how to I get them to dual boot nicely?
2012-07-29T15:06:00.000Z	vexus	fragged	does it exist if you open some programm like gpartet?
2012-07-29T15:10:00.000Z	fragged	vexus	I can see and navigate the partition, BluesKaj that gave me nothing to indicate it'd found a Windows partition
2012-07-29T15:15:00.000Z	vexus	fragged	but BluesKaj is right if you like to boot your windows you have to update your grub, but may be i does not detect the right parameter or the partition itself so you have to do it yourself in the grub.conf
