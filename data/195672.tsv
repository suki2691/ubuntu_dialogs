2009-01-23T07:34:00.000Z	Sensai_		i have psybnc running, it will only allow 10 connections, i am trying to find ut how to increase the amount of socket connections
2009-01-23T07:34:00.000Z	kitche	Sensai_	why not read psybnc documentation?
2009-01-23T07:35:00.000Z	kitche	Sensai_	then why are you asking about psybnc in your question there is nothing limiting the connection besides psybnc could be limiting itself
2009-01-23T07:38:00.000Z	kitche	Sensai_	well it's not ubuntu limiting your connections it's psybnc itself unless you configured your ubuntu to limit connections
