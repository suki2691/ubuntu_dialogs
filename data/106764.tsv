2011-01-26T10:34:00.000Z	v		Hi, I'm looking for a software that works similarly to, if you guys know it - wordpress robot 3 autpost(autoblog) campaigns.
2011-01-26T10:34:00.000Z	v		I want to be able to set up this software (it can run on my computer no problem) to take any rss feed, news item, posting from any website (google news, yahoo news, answers.com etc.) and be able to turn it into a posting on my blogger.com account.
