2011-07-16T01:00:00.000Z	Duke_		i have two partitions in my laptop... one with windows vista and one with Ubuntu 6. is it easy to remove both and install ubuntu 10? will that be easy for a linux noob like myself?
2011-07-16T01:01:00.000Z	edbian	Duke_	I think that's easy.
2011-07-16T01:01:00.000Z	Duke_	isteve_	& edbian: thank you both. what are the steps?
2011-07-16T01:02:00.000Z	edbian	Duke_	I think Ubuntu 11.04 has a 'replace Ubuntu' option. and If you wanna remove both OS's that's REALLY easy.
