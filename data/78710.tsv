2008-09-21T02:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	Eoraptor_	 becuse I often want the features that vnc gives me.. hidden,  persistant, 'desktops'
2008-09-21T02:31:00.000Z	Eoraptor_	dr_willis	maybe i should try it, too!
2008-09-21T02:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	Eoraptor_	 i tend to have a vncserver going with jwm, and a xterm or 2. and perhaps  a torrent client.
