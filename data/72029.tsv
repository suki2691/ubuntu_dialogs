2009-02-22T12:19:00.000Z	Peddy		When I select my Windows installation from the GRUB menu, I get the error "A Disk Read Error Occured, press ctrl-alt-delete to restart". Windows is on a different hard drive, and when I set it to boot from the windows-hdd in the BIOS, it boots fine. Could someone please help me get this working?
