2007-02-24T12:09:00.000Z	elbarto		hi there, i have a machine that's quite new and i'm having problems to boot from ubuntu CD... could anyone help me?
2007-02-24T12:10:00.000Z	nowher1	elbarto	Have you made it bootable, and is the bios set to boot from cd-rom?
2007-02-24T12:12:00.000Z	elbarto	nowher1	yes, the CD is fine... i have ubuntu 6.06 for both 32 and 64 bits original cds... i also downloaded the ISOs of Edgy Eft (both 64 and 32 bits) and I had problems with all 4
2007-02-24T12:12:00.000Z	elbarto	nowher1	actually, the CD is booting, the problems is that it doesn't load ubuntu live
