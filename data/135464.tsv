2007-05-07T06:02:00.000Z	BigToe		why is kacpid using up 65% of my CPU on ubuntu server? is it safe to disable it? it's making my load go up to 1.7
2007-05-07T06:03:00.000Z	bulle	BigToe	how are you going to turn off kacpid ?
2007-05-07T06:03:00.000Z	BigToe	bulle	I don't know.
2007-05-07T06:04:00.000Z	BigToe	bulle	but it's using up all my CPU time and I want to either fix or get rid of kacpid
