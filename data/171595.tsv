2007-04-29T16:33:00.000Z	ConfidentiaL		When I'm installing ubuntu 7.04, and I'm gonna choose "Device for boot loader installation", it shows hd0. Is this the same as hda? and, if I wanna install it on my first SATA disk, should I then write sda or sd0?
2007-04-29T16:33:00.000Z	Xera	ConfidentiaL	hd0 = hard drive 0
2007-04-29T16:35:00.000Z	ConfidentiaL	Xera	so if my SATA disk is my number 2 harddisk, I should write hd1? even tho the partitions are named sdaX?
