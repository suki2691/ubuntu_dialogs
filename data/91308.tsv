2008-05-10T03:14:00.000Z	mfu		if i have two network interfaces actively connected to the internet, is there a way to set which one firefox will use?

2008-05-10T03:16:00.000Z	mfu	xri	do you know which route command specifically would determine this?
2008-05-10T03:17:00.000Z	xri	mfu	nah. i just know a bit how it works. i never had to set the metrics. but you will find out easily if you use a console and type "man route"
