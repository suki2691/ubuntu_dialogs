2009-11-15T21:35:00.000Z	dotblank	Bonz	/ets/init.d/pulseaudio run it as non-root
2009-11-15T21:35:00.000Z	Bonz	dotblank	been there tried that as both root and user with no joy
2009-11-15T21:36:00.000Z	dotblank	Bonz	ok try starting "pulseaudio" in the terminal and that should tell you why its failing
