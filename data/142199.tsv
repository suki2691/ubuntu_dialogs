2007-10-20T00:03:00.000Z	janga	PurpZeY	what is the name of the package?
2007-10-20T00:04:00.000Z	PurpZeY	janga	It isn't a package...or at least for me it wasn't...Each laptop or company might have it's own....Acer acpi...Sony acpi...Check the forums for locations and directs...That's how I fixed it...
2007-10-20T00:05:00.000Z	janga	PurpZeY	ok, i try.
