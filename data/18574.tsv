2011-02-02T03:46:00.000Z	nemetos		oh, ok - so its not just one folder in windows. Configuration files goes to one certain folder, exe-files to /bin/ etc?
2011-02-02T03:48:00.000Z	nemetos		is that good or bad? As a java developer, i like stuff OO :) why is it a good idea to spread files? isnt hard to uninstall it later?
