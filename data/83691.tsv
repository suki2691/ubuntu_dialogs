2009-12-21T04:02:00.000Z	will__		IRC question. How do I make all the $user has (quit|joined) messages go away?
2009-12-21T04:02:00.000Z	lstarnes	will__	it depends on which client you are using
2009-12-21T04:02:00.000Z	lstarnes	will__	I don't think xchat-gnome can do it
2009-12-21T04:03:00.000Z	lstarnes	will__	but I do know that the original xchat can use /set irc_conf_mode 1  or you can right-click the channel tab and uncheck show join/quit messages
