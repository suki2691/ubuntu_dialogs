2005-10-05T05:04:00.000Z	Tachyon		I've got a printer hooked up to an XP machine and want to print from Ubuntu over a network.  It's set up as an "UNIX (LPD)" printer, but I get the status message "Ready: Unable to connect to printer; will retry in 30 seconds...: Connection timed out" when I try to print something.
2005-10-05T05:06:00.000Z	Kensey	Tachyon	if you're sharing the printer from XP, I suggest you start by drinking large quantities of beverages containing not less than 5% ethanol
