2011-06-09T00:53:00.000Z	blargg	jsmith396	http://upstart.ubuntu.com/getting-started.html seems to answer your question. See the "start on" section
2011-06-09T00:54:00.000Z	jsmith396	blargg	 thanks... i thought i tried that but that only worked for special (ie. system) jobs
2011-06-09T00:55:00.000Z	blargg	jsmith396	oh, maybe so. That page isn't very clear on what it means by job.
