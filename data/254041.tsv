2005-01-01T15:07:00.000Z	eim		I'm experiencing some troubles with a fresh installed Warty version on a Dell Dimension (8300): The grub boot loader hangs during the boot process: I just get some "GRUB, GRUB, ..." on the upper left corner. Any suggestions? Thanks.
2005-01-01T15:08:00.000Z	eim		grub is installed in the MBR. Maybe I should install it on the first partition.
2005-01-01T15:08:00.000Z	naibed	eim	have a look at grub's bugs (more than ubuntu specific..)
2005-01-01T15:08:00.000Z	eim	naibed	I don't think it's a *real* grub bug but much more a miss-configuration.
