2008-09-28T09:21:00.000Z	R-800__	HollywoodJumper	You are absolutely correct.  I've noticed that Ubuntu is better at MAINTAINING weaker signals than Windows is, but I'm also finding, strangely, that in my case at least, Windows seems to be better at actually CONNECTING to those signals.  Does this sound strange to you?
2008-09-28T09:24:00.000Z	R-800__	HollywoodJumper	Do you often find that the acccess point is acquired, but the internet link remains unattained?
2008-09-28T09:29:00.000Z	R-800__	HollywoodJumper	So you're suggesting just trying to connect to a weak signal over and over again?  I didn't think to try that.  : )
