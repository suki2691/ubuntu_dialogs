2006-06-28T09:10:00.000Z	Nameeater		roughly how many MB should I need to download when I dist-upgrade from the install CD?
2006-06-28T09:10:00.000Z	mikeLaptop	Nameeater	iirc the upgrade manager tells you
2006-06-28T09:11:00.000Z	Nameeater	mikeLaptop	I forgot to install the upgrade manager before doing apt-get update with the dapper packages so I am doing it with apt-get dist-upgrade :/
2006-06-28T09:12:00.000Z	mikeLaptop	Nameeater	ahh, iirc it was 800MB give or take
