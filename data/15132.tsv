2011-04-25T19:40:00.000Z	mrgreaper		hi i have some major probs at mo , im installing ubuntu 10 10 on my mates pc over the phone lol i used teamviewer to download the 64bit iso then used the guide on the ubuntu site to create a usb drive, we rebooted the pc but it gave an error about no configuration loaded and just sat there at boot:
2011-04-25T19:40:00.000Z	mrgreaper		any ideas how to fix?
2011-04-25T19:42:00.000Z	mrgreaper		if it helps im still on the phone to him, were back inot windows and im on teamviewer looking at the usb drive im guessing theres a step missing from the guide?
