2007-05-28T06:24:00.000Z	Fivetwentysix		I don't know if this is a bug or not, but under my KInfoCenter proccessor information, it says my CPU Mhz is 1000. I'm using AMD64 3000+ and i'm pretty sure my clock speed is suppose to be 1.8 Ghz

2007-05-28T06:25:00.000Z	Fivetwentysix	crimsun	I wouldn't know :-)
