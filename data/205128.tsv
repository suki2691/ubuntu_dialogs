2011-07-10T09:02:00.000Z	twobitsprite		I'm have a strange problem on a friend's computers... I'm trying to install something from CD and in the middle of installing, it asks for you to put the cd in... but it's in alraedy
2011-07-10T09:02:00.000Z	twobitsprite		when I reinsert the disk and try to mount it, it says the mountpoint doesn't exist... I check and sure enough /mnt the directory doesn't exist any more
2011-07-10T09:03:00.000Z	twobitsprite		I have to "mkdir /mnt" again, and remount
2011-07-10T09:03:00.000Z	dli	twobitsprite	maybe, something wrong with cd-rom driver, I would try to install from USB
