2008-08-18T20:35:00.000Z	mib_73swjd		I'm a not exactly adept at using linux. I've tried to set up a desktop for my mom using 8.04. She's using the internet and is using the thunderbird email client fairly well. However soemthing that she needs to be able to work from home is from this site http://www.broward.k12.fl.us/cab/. Could anyone assist me with a problem Im having?
