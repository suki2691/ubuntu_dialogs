2007-05-21T09:29:00.000Z	AlexC_	zbrown	they simply have added a few others, such as "Applications", "Users"
2007-05-21T09:29:00.000Z	zbrown	AlexC_	well the organize the system a bit differently, who puts root in private/ lol?
2007-05-21T09:30:00.000Z	zbrown	AlexC_	sorry, /private/var, a directory which doesn't even exist in the BSD's
