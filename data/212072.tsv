2007-01-17T10:29:00.000Z	KenSentMe		I'm trying to compile a driver for my webcam. I searches for /usr/src/linux which doesn't exist on Ubuntu. Where should i let the driver compile to?
2007-01-17T10:29:00.000Z	AzMoo	KenSentMe	got the linux-headers installed?
2007-01-17T10:30:00.000Z	KenSentMe	AzMoo	yes, there is /usr/src/linux-headers etc. Should i use that?
2007-01-17T10:30:00.000Z	AzMoo	KenSentMe	yep, that's what it's looking for.
