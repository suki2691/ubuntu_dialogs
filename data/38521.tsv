2012-09-28T17:44:00.000Z	noecc		Where is the 32-bit i386 md5sum for 12.04.1?  It is not listed at http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/12.04.1/release/MD5SUMS
2012-09-28T17:46:00.000Z	tsimpson	noecc	why would it be, look at the files there. the i386 ISO is on releases.ubuntu.com, not cdimage
2012-09-28T18:05:00.000Z	noecc	tsimpson	Thanks.  How would one know of that link after downloading from http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop?
2012-09-28T18:09:00.000Z	tsimpson	noecc	it doesn't mention releases. or cdimage., so one wouldn't
