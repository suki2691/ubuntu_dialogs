2009-10-20T02:38:00.000Z	xiong	Bodsda	Yes, that's correct. I was there a few weeks ago, couldn't remember the name. I had to edit it by hand then. I think you can reach it through gparted, though.
2009-10-20T02:39:00.000Z	Bodsda	xiong	nope. I don't think gparted can modify fstab
2009-10-20T02:39:00.000Z	xiong	Bodsda	You're correct in any case.
