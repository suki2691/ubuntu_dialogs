2012-06-06T23:29:00.000Z	Garridon		im new to ubuntu, i installed ubuntu on a seperate partition just to try it out. (ubuntu 12.04) now i cant boot back into windows 7. no error, it just sits on the "starting windows" screen

2012-06-06T23:32:00.000Z	OerHeks	Garridon	i assume you tried booting in sinwos safe mode
