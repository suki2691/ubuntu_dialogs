2005-01-19T08:26:00.000Z	kotau		I am trying to install a mouse driver for my logitech mx510.  I found a driver for it [http://freshmeat.net/projects/logitech_applet/]   but when I try to compile, I get this error [  ERROR!  libusb header not found, get it from  http://libusb.sourceforge.net  or use the --with-libusb-includes option, if you have it installed in an unusual place]   I have reinstalled libusb through synaptic and it is the latest version.  I still get this erro
2005-01-19T08:26:00.000Z	kotau		r though
2005-01-19T08:27:00.000Z	kotau		yep there is, should I try installing it?
