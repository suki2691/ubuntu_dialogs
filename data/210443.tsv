2006-05-22T13:53:00.000Z	Jowi		i have a cups problem. i have an Epson Stylus DX4250 that is connected via USB and get detected properly. the driver it want to use is Stylus-800. printing testpage fail (nothing happens). it is supported with gimpprint, but I am not 100% sure that the suggested driver is the correct one. how can I verify this? I can't find the info I need at linuxprinting.org
