2010-10-11T13:11:00.000Z	peepsalot		i used to be able to take a screenshot of a single window, using ctrl-prtscrn (or maybe it was alt).  it doesn't seem to be working after upgrade, i tried all the modifier keys.  only pressing prtscrn by itself takes a screenshot of the whole screen
2010-10-11T13:12:00.000Z	peepsalot		i wonder if it has to do with enabling compiz
2010-10-11T13:12:00.000Z	soreau	peepsalot	Do you have ccsm>Gnome Compatibility enabled? (and screenshot set inside of the plugin)
2010-10-11T13:14:00.000Z	peepsalot	soreau	yeah, for some reason it just won't register the combo of alt-prtscrn.  i went into the gnome hotkey settings and remapped it to ctrl-prtscrn and it works fine now
