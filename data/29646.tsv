2010-10-09T18:49:00.000Z	HaPK_PerCar		I was wondering... When the next version of ubuntu comes out I'm going to reinstall rather that update. Do I loose all the configuration I've done previously if I do that?
2010-10-09T18:49:00.000Z	Jookia	HaPK_PerCar	Reinstalling loses all the data and configuration. Upgrading doesn't.
2010-10-09T18:50:00.000Z	HaPK_PerCar	Jookia	so if I reinstall I also loose all the files in my home folder?
2010-10-09T18:50:00.000Z	Jookia	HaPK_PerCar	I'm not sure, depends how you partitioned it. I think you will if it's all on one partition.
