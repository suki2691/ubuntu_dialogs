2009-01-14T05:34:00.000Z	Bodsda	BotLobsta	you could try 'glxgears'
2009-01-14T05:34:00.000Z	BotLobsta	Bodsda	does that run with the open source drivers?  And does that test everything?
2009-01-14T05:35:00.000Z	Bodsda	BotLobsta	It uses OpenGL and no it doesnt test 'everything' but its a first point of call
