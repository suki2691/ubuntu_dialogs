2012-05-08T16:27:00.000Z	tinux		hello everyone
2012-05-08T16:28:00.000Z	tinux		can anyone please suggest me a command which can get all active services along with their conf files ?
2012-05-08T16:29:00.000Z	Blarrffll	tinux	: service --status-all will list services.  Not sure about the config files attached to them
2012-05-08T16:30:00.000Z	tinux	Blarrffll	it do not show conf files
