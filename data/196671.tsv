2006-05-30T15:43:00.000Z	Linuturk_NB		i got debian sarge installed with gnome, and it runs slow (but not unbearable)
2006-05-30T15:44:00.000Z	Linuturk_NB		i'm running it on 500 mhz
2006-05-30T15:44:00.000Z	trpr42	Linuturk_NB	shouldn't have a problem. expect it to act as slow as it is though. xubuntu, or even just replacing kde/gnome with something lightweight will make a big difference
