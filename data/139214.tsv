2007-04-21T10:03:00.000Z	Lukemob		I bought domain ... do I need anything to redirect it to my server?
2007-04-21T10:03:00.000Z	LjL	Lukemob	is that an Ubuntu support question?
2007-04-21T10:04:00.000Z	Lukemob	LjL	I mean, do I need anything for my Ubuntu server to use that domain?
2007-04-21T10:04:00.000Z	LjL	Lukemob	i'm not very familiar with that kind of things, but i think it's more a matter of configuring things at the domain provider side
