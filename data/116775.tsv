2008-11-22T01:27:00.000Z	kilgore		I have a machine here running 7.04, I'd like to upgrade to 8.10 .. am I better off doing all the upgrades to 8.10 or just reinstalling with a current cd?
2008-11-22T01:27:00.000Z	jotil	kilgore	you need to go like this: 7.04 -> 7.10 -> 8.04 -> 8.10
2008-11-22T01:27:00.000Z	kilgore	Hikefu	that's what I was thinking.. was hoping you'd tell me the easy way would work
2008-11-22T01:28:00.000Z	jotil	kilgore	three upgrades. or you can fresh install 8.10.
