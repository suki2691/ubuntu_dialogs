2007-09-26T05:15:00.000Z	bulio		I just installed ubuntu feisty on my core 2 duo t7500
2007-09-26T05:15:00.000Z	bulio		and its 32-bit, but is there any point in using 64-bit?
2007-09-26T05:16:00.000Z	bulio		or will 32-bit run just as fast?
2007-09-26T05:16:00.000Z	pike_	bulio	unless you need to adress more than 4 gigs in a single process i wouldnt move to 64 bit
