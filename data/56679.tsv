2010-05-09T22:48:00.000Z	kuttans		hello everybody, i have the latest lucid lynx. the problem is the sudo apt-get update is downloading only 884kbs where as karmic used to download near about 11mb of update data
2010-05-09T22:50:00.000Z	kuttans		why the sudo apt-get update is downloading less while i enabled all universe, multiverse updates
2010-05-09T22:50:00.000Z	xangua	kuttans	because there are no updateÂ¿
2010-05-09T22:52:00.000Z	kuttans	xangua	if it is for sudo apt-get upgrade im not worried as there wont be any upgrade
