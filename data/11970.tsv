2012-11-12T11:49:00.000Z	somsip	Flyzoola	why do you want to install a tarball of firefox?
2012-11-12T11:51:00.000Z	Flyzoola	somsip	because that's the only available download for a newer version. Off of "getfirefox.com" they only offer a tarball download. I would use the software center for a newer version, but I'm on ubu8.04.
2012-11-12T11:53:00.000Z	somsip	Flyzoola	yeah - PPA looks like a easier way, but 8.04...
