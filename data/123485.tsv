2008-11-04T09:01:00.000Z	c0mp13371331337	natalie	Have you downloaded the VMWare package?  IIRC, that's all I ever needed.  That and the stupid serial key.
2008-11-04T09:02:00.000Z	natalie	kgod	 I downloaded the package, installed it and used the serial key, but whenever I try and run it I get "vmware is installed, but it has not been (correctly) configured for this system. To (re-)configure it, invoke the following command: /usr/bin/vmware-config.pl." And then I run it and it happens again.
2008-11-04T09:03:00.000Z	c0mp13371331337	natalie	Have you rebooted?  There are some modules that need to be loaded that may not have fully loaded if you haven't done a reboot.
