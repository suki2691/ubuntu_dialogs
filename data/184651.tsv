2009-09-30T08:06:00.000Z	Ademan		can anyone point me to some benchmarks of software raid versus fake raid? http://blog.shaf.net/?p=6 is the only one i noticed thus far, and it surprisingly (to me) puts software raid as faster than fake raid... I expect fake raid is faster but negligibly so...
2009-09-30T08:06:00.000Z	Ademan		in other words i want a second opinion

2009-09-30T08:09:00.000Z	Ademan	kermit	i honestly have no idea how it works, but that benchmark seems to suggest, it doesn't heh... software raid seems like a superior choice simply for stability's sake, but I'm just curious about performance
