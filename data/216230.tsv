2007-10-21T12:30:00.000Z	OMGWTFBBQ		i've been trying to figure out why i can't get a ./configure on the xchat tarballs to work. it says: "error: cannot find 'glib'"
2007-10-21T12:31:00.000Z	DShepherd	OMGWTFBBQ	have you install the glib dev files?
2007-10-21T12:32:00.000Z	DShepherd	OMGWTFBBQ	libglib2.0-dev is what you might be looking for
2007-10-21T12:33:00.000Z	DShepherd	OMGWTFBBQ	something like that
