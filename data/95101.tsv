2008-04-25T11:28:00.000Z	prodigel		Hi. I'm having problems with gdm or something from gnome. My desk freezes just from checking properties on a panel applet, or trying to change desktop background. Alt+tab and other window shortcut keys still function. Could you help me trace to problem?

2008-04-25T11:30:00.000Z	prodigel	harriseldon	ok, so something freezes in gnome and I don't know why. I've waited for updates hoping it will be solved, but nothing. Now 8.04 was launched and I'm still having problems
2008-04-25T11:35:00.000Z	prodigel	harriseldon	can I find somewhere in logs info about this problems?
