2007-07-24T06:32:00.000Z	Budwaa		Im missing man pages for c/c++ functions. How do I install them/
2007-07-24T06:33:00.000Z	Pelo	Budwaa	check in synaptic for  -doc packages for the package you installed
2007-07-24T06:33:00.000Z	Budwaa	Pelo	this is for general c++ functions. Would say build-essentials be the place too look?
2007-07-24T06:34:00.000Z	Pelo	Budwaa	check in synaptic ,  search for build-essential , if there is a doc package to go with it , it will show
