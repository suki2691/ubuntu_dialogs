2007-06-01T10:47:00.000Z	Danzor		I'm trying to configure a wireless network on Ubuntu, and the help files tell me to go to "Places -> Network Servers"
2007-06-01T10:47:00.000Z	Danzor		But there is no "Network Servers" option under that menu
2007-06-01T10:48:00.000Z	Danzor		And somewhere else in the help file it mentions "Networking" under "Administration" but it's not under there
2007-06-01T10:48:00.000Z	gravemind	Danzor	what exactly are you trying to set up?
