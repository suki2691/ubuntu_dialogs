2007-07-29T08:02:00.000Z	kitche	Ashfire908	did you do smbpasswd?
2007-07-29T08:04:00.000Z	Ashfire908	kitche	since i've never heard of the command before, no.
2007-07-29T08:05:00.000Z	kitche	Ashfire908	well that's the reason why most likely you can't get in you don't have a samba password setup for your user
