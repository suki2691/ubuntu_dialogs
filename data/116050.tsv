2009-06-08T05:19:00.000Z	orochi_		i'm a bit confused about eglibc...how will compiling (say) a 32-bit binary in Ubuntu with glibc affect it's ability to run in Debian or another distribution that uses eglibc? Seems like there's a lot of potential for breakage :<
2009-06-08T05:20:00.000Z	Flannel	orochi_	That's offtopic for here.  #ubuntu-offtopic might be a better place for it, or maybe one of a few others.
2009-06-08T05:20:00.000Z	orochi_	Flannel	Oh, I see
2009-06-08T05:22:00.000Z	Flannel	orochi_	Not trying to stifle conversation at all (it's a welcome discussion in -offtopic), but this channel is purely for technical support (not discussions/etc)
