2008-05-07T13:37:00.000Z	adam7	Chrysalis	right click, and the press lock to panel
2008-05-07T13:37:00.000Z	adam7	Chrysalis	you probably just need to lock it in the corner?
2008-05-07T13:38:00.000Z	Chrysalis	adam7	its locked, but it moves further to the right when i open programs and doesnt go back left when i close them and leavse empty space
