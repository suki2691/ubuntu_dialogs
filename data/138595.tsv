2007-10-22T12:49:00.000Z	magnetron	fredl	just as debian, ubuntu can have as many partitions as you want
2007-10-22T12:50:00.000Z	fredl	magnetron	- yeah I know that part. The Debian installer is somewhat more flexible in initially making those volumes (at install time) but if I can keep 'em basically the way they are that'd be nice.
