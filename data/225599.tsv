2005-08-09T16:28:00.000Z	elsha		hi guys, im just trying to boot into ubuntu, but it's not liking the GUI. I previously had a nvidia video card, which had no problems and was working fine. I've since changed it to an ATI radeon 9600 card. I've followed the instructions on the wiki for this video card, but i'm coming up with (EE) No devices detected     Fatal server error: no screens found. Any ideas/suggestions?
