2009-01-30T09:28:00.000Z	foxwoods	ravious	where are you looking for xorg.conf.....cause it's definitely still in use
2009-01-30T09:29:00.000Z	foxwoods	ravious	if usser's suggestion doesn't work, exit the x-server and use sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2009-01-30T09:31:00.000Z	foxwoods	ravious	have you tried dpkg-reconfigure yet?
