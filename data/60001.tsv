Two strategies: Use a regex engine that supports non-greedy matching (you could use perl as a filter), convert the multi-byte patterns to single characters (after escaping those single characters), then use your original approach on that and undo the escaping. Also, there's channels like ##sed, #regex, #perl, etc.
