2006-09-30T05:09:00.000Z	phire		hey everyone, Last night I managed to crash ubuntu, cause gimp had a 3.8 gb image, but I got to 80% of saving as a jpg, but the actual file is empty. Would there be a way to rescue it out of the temp or something??
2006-09-30T05:10:00.000Z	printk	phire	might try .gimp-2.2/tmp
2006-09-30T05:10:00.000Z	phire		k thanks
2006-09-30T05:12:00.000Z	phire	printk	.gimp-2.2/tmp is empty but there is a 3.8gb file called "gimpswap.10312"
