2011-07-08T06:35:00.000Z	maco	Kleus	that looks like a kernel panic. some bit of hardware is NOT happy with ubuntu
2011-07-08T06:35:00.000Z	Kleus	maco	is there a way to tell what it is that ubuntu doesnt like?
2011-07-08T06:36:00.000Z	maco	Kleus	you can try posting a bug report with that and your system info and maybe the kernel bug triager will have an idea if its an incompatibility. it's also possible for it to be a bit of hardware going bad  (kernel panics are like blue screens of death)
