2006-01-23T13:42:00.000Z	MarcN	nippur	xmms is fine, just not rhythmbox since an update a while ago.  Forget exactly when.  If there was a simple fix that would be cool.  That is why I wanted a mass mp3->ogg converter.  I'll burn the extra disk space.
2006-01-23T13:43:00.000Z	nippur	MarcN	did you get the mass mp3->ogg converter? I was looking for it too
2006-01-23T13:44:00.000Z	MarcN	nippur	nah, need to spend some more time with google.  Simple to hack, but if there is one out there...
