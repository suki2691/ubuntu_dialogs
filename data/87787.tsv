2008-06-13T03:28:00.000Z	ZeeStorm	jpastore	it's still linux :)
2008-06-13T03:28:00.000Z	jpastore	ZeeStorm	yea but in redhat/centos I seem to be fine...I also don't need video drivers which is my problem
2008-06-13T03:29:00.000Z	ZeeStorm	jpastore	i've also noticed my fedora runs really well on a nvidia machine *shrugs* (in comparison to ubuntu).. but i still like ubuntu more
