2008-03-27T23:32:00.000Z	inminic		like google.com just specified by Ubuntu
2008-03-27T23:33:00.000Z	odder	inminic	yes, there is a default start page for the ubuntu-specified browser
2008-03-27T23:34:00.000Z	odder	inminic	as far as I remember, I've seen such page in dapper, feisty and edgy, I haven't used gutsy yet
