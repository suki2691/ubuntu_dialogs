2009-09-28T16:25:00.000Z	kalakouentin		hello I have bought a Logitech QuickCam Deluxe for Notebooks and I while Cheese and Skype recognise it I am not able to adjust it's focusing. As a result I have crystal-clear image of something that is 2cm away from the lenses but awfully blurry when I sit in a normal distance. Can anyone help me to adjust it?
