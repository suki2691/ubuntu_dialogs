2009-03-07T10:34:00.000Z	Scunizi	TeamColtra[CAM||	why not just load the windows manager that crunchbang uses?
2009-03-07T10:34:00.000Z	TeamColtra[CAM||		:P Which is why I am trying to find out why my partition is showing that it has more space used up than it acutally does in gparted
2009-03-07T10:35:00.000Z	TeamColtra[CAM||	Scunizi	because there is more to it than just the beautiful windows manager that #! uses.
