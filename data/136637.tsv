But would somebody please look at it and tell me why it did it to begin with so I can prevent it from happening again... Contrary to what the computer thought, I actually do use gnome....

2007-05-13T08:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	flowingfire	Because ubuntu-desktop brings in gnome, apt was just telling you that since you removed ubuntu-desktop you might also want to remove it's dependencies, one of which is gnome
2007-05-13T08:57:00.000Z	flowingfire	Jordan_U	Ahhh ok....
