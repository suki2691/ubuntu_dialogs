2009-05-02T13:59:00.000Z	maodun		if i'm on intrepid, can i safely add the repos for later distros to my aptitude sources?
2009-05-02T14:00:00.000Z	maodun		i want python2.6 and intrepid doesnt seem to have it
2009-05-02T14:00:00.000Z	cperrin88	maodun	better not, because these might have dependencies for apps or libs for the next version
2009-05-02T14:00:00.000Z	maodun	cperrin88	ah, thanks
