2009-11-14T16:21:00.000Z	Lewis		The way i installed Ubuntu means it made a partition, but the partition doesn't have a name, and won't allow me to rename it or resize it or anything. It's really annoying because i'm running out of room in this partition. How do i give it a name?

2009-11-14T16:22:00.000Z	iceroot	Lewis	look at fdisk -l
