2008-06-09T09:48:00.000Z	ezzieyguywuf		i just installed ubuntu studio and lost one of my scripts. It was real simple but i can´t seem to remember the command. I used it to replace compiz with metacity before suspending. can anyone help me? the command went something along the lines of ¨sudo -u wolfie DISPLAY=¨0
2008-06-09T09:48:00.000Z	ezzieyguywuf		﻿¨sudo -u wolfie DISPLAY=¨0:0¨ metacity --replace
2008-06-09T09:48:00.000Z	ezzieyguywuf		i´m having problems with the ¨DISPLAY¨ part of it
