2009-04-30T20:27:00.000Z	first2di3		well... it would be, but windows didnt have a problem until I installed ubuntu, so I thought since you see people like me every other day you might have a pointer or two =/
2009-04-30T20:29:00.000Z	first2di3		ok, Thanks
2009-04-30T20:29:00.000Z	mbeierl	first2di3	do you have a windows repair or install disk?
