2007-08-07T08:02:00.000Z	level1		Hi guys.  I just built my own computer.  I'm able to install ubuntu, even get compiz running, but its very unstable.  Anything can cause the computer to hang and become completely unresponsive.  Today, I can't even boot, so if I have to reinstall, it will be the third time
2007-08-07T08:02:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	level1	Did you do it...right?  (The build)
2007-08-07T08:03:00.000Z	level1	Music_Shuffle	I don't know.... I can run it, but it crashes a lot
