2007-11-24T05:47:00.000Z	RunSeven		hello i have a question you will probably laugh at... i just installed a packet (truecrypt)... now where did the program go and how can i start truecrypt?
2007-11-24T05:47:00.000Z	Pelo	RunSeven	 probabaly from the command line,  type truecrypt
2007-11-24T05:48:00.000Z	Pelo	RunSeven	 a prog like that might be listed under prefs or admin , not in applications
2007-11-24T05:49:00.000Z	Pelo	RunSeven	 just type truecrypt in the terminal
