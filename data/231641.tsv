2005-07-26T15:04:00.000Z	IFRFLYR		hiI I have installed gtkwifi and can't seem to add it to my panel because it doesn't appear in the list when I click Add To Panel. . .  .Any ideas?
2005-07-26T15:05:00.000Z	Rugmonster	IFRFLYR	have you restarted gnome-panel?
2005-07-26T15:06:00.000Z	IFRFLYR	Rugmonster	- is there a menu to do it from or must I use terminal? I just don't want to do it rudely and have never restarted the panel
