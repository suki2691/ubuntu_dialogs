2006-06-09T07:59:00.000Z	dgm		I already have a dual boot system; I'm getting ready to reformat my XP side.  I know it will end up blasting my MBR... is there a quick tool to save that and restore it after XP destroys it?
2006-06-09T08:00:00.000Z	dgm		ok, duh, I thought it was something like that
2006-06-09T08:00:00.000Z	dgm		I'm still not used to the idea of a livecd/install on the same disk
2006-06-09T08:01:00.000Z	wildman	dgm	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop, or something like that. check the ubuntu wiki and also 6.06 reviews, it's all there ;)
