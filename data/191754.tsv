2006-11-18T08:26:00.000Z	recon0		Is there any way to create a text terminal remote-access to my computer? My problem is that the client computer only has telnet available.
2006-11-18T08:27:00.000Z	roryy	recon0	if the client is on windows, I'd recommend trying out putty (for ssh instead)

2006-11-18T08:28:00.000Z	roryy	recon0	well, telnetd is available. putty is a helluva good telnet/ssh client, though
