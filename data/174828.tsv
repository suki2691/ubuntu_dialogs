2006-11-30T08:30:00.000Z	McMadd		I think my question might be related to the discussion of dbe and Lapfunc...
2006-11-30T08:30:00.000Z	McMadd		I've got a fully configured Ubuntu machine which I need to replicate (clone) to a lot of other identical machines. Been goofing around with Ghost but it won't work. Any suggestions? (I'm not a Linux guy yet, so maybe there's an easy answer :-)
