2010-01-07T05:06:00.000Z	faileas	blakkheim	well, i feel so too. then again a server dosen't need anything but a power source and a connection to the network, as far as i am concerned ;p

2010-01-07T05:08:00.000Z	faileas	blakkheim	well, that's based off my needs. monitor, and keyboard are optional, post install though
