2007-08-14T06:17:00.000Z	Tru7h		There's two partitions on my drive called Dell Utility and Dell Restore. Can I delete one of them to make room for an Ubuntu installation?
2007-08-14T06:17:00.000Z	Tru7h		Or would that mess something up?
2007-08-14T06:17:00.000Z	bruenig	Tru7h	you can delete both if you want
2007-08-14T06:17:00.000Z	bruenig	Tru7h	just takes out the restore partition
