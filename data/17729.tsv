2011-03-01T01:14:00.000Z	JTS000ID		I was wondering which one has better support for drivers Fedora or Ubuntu.
2011-03-01T01:15:00.000Z	ThinkT510	JTS000ID	are you having trouble with certain hardware?
2011-03-01T01:16:00.000Z	JTS000ID	ThinkT510	Well not at the moment. I have a software for which I'll be providing Support. I need to place my OSes in seqence to which I'll be providing support to. So Fedora or Ubuntu.
2011-03-01T01:18:00.000Z	ThinkT510	JTS000ID	its the linux kernel that supports hardware, i'm not sure the differences between ubuntu and fedora kernel packeges
