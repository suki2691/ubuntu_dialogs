2007-04-26T12:02:00.000Z	noiesmo	bombice|laptop	are you on feisty the nvidia-glx-new might be what you want are you getting an api mismatch error
2007-04-26T12:04:00.000Z	noiesmo	bombice|laptop	maybe boot in to recovery mode and then check /var/log/Xorg.0.log see if its the mismatched api then install nvidia-glx-new also check dmesg and messages for errors
