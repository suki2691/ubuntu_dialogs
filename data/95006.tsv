2008-04-10T05:19:00.000Z	TeamColtra[NADC]		The version of amsn that i get when typing sudo apt-get install amsn is out of date, is there a way to update it?

2008-04-10T05:20:00.000Z	TeamColtra[NADC]	soundray	well it says that there is a new version available, and then when i try to sign on, everything is just blank so i figured it was because of my outdated version
2008-04-10T05:21:00.000Z	soundray	TeamColtra[NADC]	check if there is a new version in backports
