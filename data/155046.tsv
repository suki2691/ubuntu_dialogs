2011-02-18T04:14:00.000Z	AndroUser2		*vbscript
2011-02-18T04:15:00.000Z	Kyle__	AndroUser2	I (used to) know how to do it in waitr, and that just wraps com in ruby, so should be easy enough...
2011-02-18T04:16:00.000Z	Kyle__	AndroUser2	Ruby-watir is actually prety easy...maybe you could find an example and port it to vbscript (I recall this being pretty easy, but it was 3+ years ago)
