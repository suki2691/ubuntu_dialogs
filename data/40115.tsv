2009-12-26T19:12:00.000Z	kymara		try update-java-alternatives -l to list the options and check the man page to see how to set them
2009-12-26T19:13:00.000Z	kymara		i hope this is not too 'general' a question - does anyone have experience with ubuntu netbook remix, the 'about' page says it's optimised for retail sales environment which makes me think it may not be actually good as a useable OS .. i use ubuntu normally on my desktop, now want something for my netbook
