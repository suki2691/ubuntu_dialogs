2008-12-14T18:39:00.000Z	Koordin	cousteau	because it has nothing to read anymore ?
2008-12-14T18:40:00.000Z	Koordin	cousteau	yes but why he doesn't write the content of file within it ?
2008-12-14T18:46:00.000Z	Koordin	cousteau	i'm not trying to rewrite file, i'm just trying to understand the command "cat <file >file"
