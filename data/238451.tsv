2008-10-23T13:15:00.000Z	aaron	K-O-D	you just need to make sure in enable the nvidia driver in System>Administration>Hardware  then install  compiz-settings-manager
2008-10-23T13:16:00.000Z	aaron	K-O-D	ubuntu uses a fairly up to date nvidia driver
2008-10-23T13:19:00.000Z	aaron	K-O-D	yes, because you will be able to utilize the full potential of your hardware
