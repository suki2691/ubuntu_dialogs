How come that we always said that installing software on ubuntu is much easier than windows, actually it's not so easy I'm new on ubuntu and I tried to install java manually a lot of problems, first it said I need to install rpm, than again something else, what if I don't have internet ?

2008-07-17T16:22:00.000Z	EminX	koshari	thanx a lot, but as i said i'm new and i don't know exactly what is RH/fed
2008-07-17T16:23:00.000Z	koshari	EminX	and flash is a bit of a pain as the deb only installs the installer so its adobes fault if you dont have a web connection,
