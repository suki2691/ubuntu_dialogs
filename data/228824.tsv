2005-07-06T07:48:00.000Z	Redhatter		Hi all, just a question... How does one go about netbooting Ubuntu?  I've slowly been trying to set up a kernel image (with initramfs image) and startup scripts to allow a machine to download and boot it over a network, but so far haven't had the greatest of success.

2005-07-06T07:54:00.000Z	Redhatter	Justin	I noticed that :-)
