2008-02-02T02:08:00.000Z	Erik1		got video-hassles with etch2. question: is ubuntu good for web development (apache-localhost/php4-5,mysql,eclipse) ?
2008-02-02T02:08:00.000Z	soundray	Erik1	at least as good as etch, I'd say
2008-02-02T02:08:00.000Z	Erik1	soundray	you experienced in this field, if I may ask ?
2008-02-02T02:10:00.000Z	soundray	Erik1	web development? Not very. But given that Ubuntu accesses pretty much the same software as etch, with a slight edge as regards timeliness, I'd predict that you'd fare well. See also factoids (private message)
