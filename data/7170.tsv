2012-01-17T02:32:00.000Z	sroy2		Hi... ubuntu 11.10 is giving me I/O errors every time I try to open a file on a DVD... its making me think the dvd is bad, any advice on how to check if that is true (and if so recover info from the DVD)?
2012-01-17T02:34:00.000Z	RokcStar	sroy2	doesnt the dvd have a detect errors option?
2012-01-17T02:34:00.000Z	sroy2		err... its a file I burned some file to before I moved over to ubuntu
2012-01-17T02:35:00.000Z	sroy2	RokcStar	its just a DVD I burned files to before I moved over to ubuntu - as of now its the only copy of those files... :s
