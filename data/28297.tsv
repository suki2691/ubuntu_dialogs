2010-08-02T19:28:00.000Z	Steve973	blitzo	just a web page/app/whatever that will allow uploads to a specified directory.  I can run it on https.  It will alleviate the need for an scp or ftp client.
2010-08-02T19:32:00.000Z	blitzo	Steve973	there is a way to do that with http put commands and .htaccess to ask for a password but it would not be terribly secure.
2010-08-02T19:33:00.000Z	blitzo	Steve973	can you be more specific why you don't want to use ssh or ftp?
