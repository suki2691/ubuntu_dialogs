2005-08-08T07:16:00.000Z	CurtinDaVern		Hi there, I have recently tried Linspire but I am unable to get my WiFi card working could someone be kind enough to let me know if it would be possible to work under Ubuntu?
2005-08-08T07:17:00.000Z	aceb747	CurtinDaVern	your wifi would work if there is a module for it in the kernel.... u might want to try compiling a 2.6.10 kernel

2005-08-08T07:17:00.000Z	aceb747	CurtinDaVern	sure
