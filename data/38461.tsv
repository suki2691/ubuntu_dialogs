2010-01-24T02:27:00.000Z	UbuntuUser		i dont want to register with password and email adress, some days ago I had not to register. Why now?
2010-01-24T02:28:00.000Z	ripcord	UbuntuUser	 some channels have flags set that only allow registered users in them
2010-01-24T02:29:00.000Z	ripcord	UbuntuUser	it depends on if the moderators want to set the flag or not. Sometimes they will set it temporarily to stop spam bots
