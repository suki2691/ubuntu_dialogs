2006-11-18T14:26:00.000Z	sunganes		hello. I now have Ubuntu server (drapper drake version) and ubuntu-desktop installed. So far things have been a breeze and I am starting to love ubuntu. I now need to install JAVA, Eclipse, JBOSS, Hibernate, Axis. are there packages for these already? what is the best way to go about doing this.
