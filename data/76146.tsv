2008-12-04T01:46:00.000Z	fa2s		i have a partition where i put my /home, if i reinstall the system, will i save my configurations?
2008-12-04T01:47:00.000Z	mker	fa2s	yes. as long as you don't format that partition too of course :)
2008-12-04T01:48:00.000Z	mker	fa2s	nope, just the settings. you can make a list of your programs and do "sudo aptitude install program1 program2 program3" and so on. Probably works with apt-get too if that's what you use. Fast way of getting all your favorite programs back
