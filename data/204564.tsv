2005-12-16T06:16:00.000Z	zandaa	eXistenZ	go into synaptic package manager, schoose Status, and then in the list there should be the option "installed"
2005-12-16T06:16:00.000Z	eXistenZ	zandaa	I need the packages I Installed recently
2005-12-16T06:17:00.000Z	zandaa	eXistenZ	ah sorry I misunderstood you there for a moment... I dunno where it shows the date of installation for packages
