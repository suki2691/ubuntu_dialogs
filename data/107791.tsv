2008-02-22T21:27:00.000Z	Tetracomm		 Hi. I have an integrated sound card which I no longer use. I just installed an Aureal Vortex sound card and disabled the integrated sound interface in the BIOS. Whenever I hibernate or suspend Ubuntu, the sound doesn't work when I resume it. The sound works again once I restart. But when I shut down it says: "Vortex: AC'97 Codec stuck busy". Vortex is the new card I installed, and AC'97 is the integrated one. Help?
