2012-07-28T23:36:00.000Z	zykotick9	Bhalash	well - that answer one of my questions ;)  i'm guessing 1280x1024 would be a lot more reasonable then 1024x768
2012-07-28T23:36:00.000Z	Bhalash	zykotick9	1024x768 is a fallback resolution because virtually everything supports it.
2012-07-28T23:36:00.000Z	zykotick9	Bhalash	its a vesa supported resolution for sure...
