2010-12-17T03:54:00.000Z	bryhoyt	Tonus	thanks, that a helpful idea. But yeah, in this case the config migration is probably not straightforward. Nothing too serious, but we have a couple mailing lists & virtual hosts config
2010-12-17T03:55:00.000Z	Tonus	bryhoyt	that's probably too risky on a production environment then. unless you have a test environment, or set up one, virtually perhaps.
2010-12-17T03:55:00.000Z	bryhoyt	Tonus	thanks anyway :-)
