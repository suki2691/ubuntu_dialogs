2008-02-02T11:26:00.000Z	bytecolor		why would I be able to connect to a given wifi with Win2k but not Ubuntu, drivers?
2008-02-02T11:27:00.000Z	bytecolor		I mean both operating systems 'see' the connections, but Win2k, _always_ connects
2008-02-02T11:28:00.000Z	jc	bytecolor	wifi drivers can be really tricky to get working, I had to try three different ones on my desktop before I got mine working
2008-02-02T11:28:00.000Z	bytecolor	jc	I can connect, but the connections are horrible compaired to what I get on the same lappy rebooted to Win2k
