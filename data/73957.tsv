2009-05-04T07:05:00.000Z	jeffreyf1		kind of off topic - any one know of a PHP/MySQL CRM + HelpDesk/Ticketing system with possibly ERP
2009-05-04T07:06:00.000Z	cfedde	jeffreyf1	that seems upside down. there are some ERP that happen to have ticketing.
2009-05-04T07:07:00.000Z	jeffreyf1	cfedde	I know.  small startup for computer service....want to keep track of my customers, their service tickets (stuff they call me for) as well as keep track of my income....possibly ERP isn't the app, maybe accounting
2009-05-04T07:12:00.000Z	cfedde	jeffreyf1	have you looked at openerp for example?
