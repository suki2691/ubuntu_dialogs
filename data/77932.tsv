2008-10-04T05:27:00.000Z	RyanPrior	MetalHeadDead	an antivirus doesn't do much because there are no Ubuntu viruses in the wild. However, if you're concerned about passing viruses on to Windows-using friends, you can use ClamScan to check for viruses.

2008-10-04T05:28:00.000Z	RyanPrior	MetalHeadDead	there's also an online service called VirusTotal which uses a bunch of (free and non-free) virus checkers to analyze a file.
