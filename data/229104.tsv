2005-12-07T17:54:00.000Z	opnsrc		I had Kanotix and Redhat linux once and I didn't have problems compiling stuff. For some reason, I can't compile anything under Ubuntu
2005-12-07T17:54:00.000Z	opnsrc		I installed all the compiler stuff from spm
2005-12-07T17:55:00.000Z	mwe	opnsrc	why would you bother compiling it yourself?
