2009-11-12T05:10:00.000Z	rusg		I am trying to clean up a hijacked computer running xp on raid array. I booted up with 9.10 in live mode thinking I could access C drive and run a scan. I don't see c: drive. Do I need to install ubuntu 9.10 on the windows computer in order to access c: drive and run a scan? Will ubuntu run on a windows installation using raid 5 array? please help
