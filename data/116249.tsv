2007-10-19T09:51:00.000Z	gameforge		Well, I have a list of repo mirrors in Adept... I already tried a Canadian one, there aren't any Mexican ones listed - the page IcemanV9 posted has one, and it shows Gutsy, but I have no way to add it. :(
2007-10-19T09:52:00.000Z	gameforge		It's OK, I'll just wait until the load lightens up - in the meantime, if anyone is so willing, the Kubuntu Gutsy DVD has about 6 seeders and hundreds of leechers, so if anyone has the ability to help out, it would be greatly appreciated - I've only d/l'd 100 or so megs in over 3 hours on a 7 mbit connection, and I have a 4+ share ratio...

2007-10-19T09:54:00.000Z	gameforge	defrysk	MasterShrek: Well, I'm trying to upgrade - I don't want to wipe out, I've been upgrading since Dapper... I could do the whole upgrade from the net, but the mirrors are all busy and my "Find Best Server" button doesn't work - with the DVD, I could upgrade (mostly) locally.
