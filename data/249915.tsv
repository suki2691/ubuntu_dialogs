2012-02-24T16:16:00.000Z	IceHunter		I've got some problems... I'm new to Ubuntu. Just installed it on my HP Pavilion dv7. Alongside with windows. I really want to delete Windows, but there are several reasons i can't. First of all, the biggest problem is that i can't control screen brightness. Can somebody try to help me deal with it, please?

2012-02-24T16:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	IceHunter	 does it stay bright all the time? or what excactly?
2012-02-24T16:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	IceHunter	 not strange at all. the laptop makers like to do their 'own' thing and not follow any standards
