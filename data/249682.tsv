2008-01-27T08:42:00.000Z	Jakoo		just a question is it possible to get a full list of commands somewhere?
2008-01-27T08:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Jakoo	  you have all the commands in your 'path' and proberly dozens of others tha are not in the default path. I suggest reading some basic bash tutorials/guides for starters
2008-01-27T08:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Jakoo	 open up a terminaland hit tab a few times. It will complete all the names.
