2007-10-23T03:38:00.000Z	LinuxLlama		I just installed ubuntu gutsy on my computer to see what all the fuss was about, and i installed it on my second hard drive, and told the bootloader to install to hd1 instead of hd0. Now when I boot, it says "Error 22 (maybe 22, im not sure): File not found". Can someone help me adjust GRUB so it works? Thanks.
2007-10-23T03:39:00.000Z	LinuxLlama		Yes, Llama.
2007-10-23T03:39:00.000Z	Nubbie	LinuxLlama	do you have grub installed on two different hard drives?
