2007-06-03T11:15:00.000Z	ca-steve		Hi everyone - I am having some problems with screen resolution. I installed Feisty with a Radeon 9800 and a Samsung Syncmaster 243 (24-inch) and all I get is 1024x768. Any ideas?
2007-06-03T11:16:00.000Z	wols_	ca-steve	what videodriver do you use?

2007-06-03T11:17:00.000Z	ca-steve	wols_	 ok - thx - I'll try that
