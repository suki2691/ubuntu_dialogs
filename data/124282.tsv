Your preffered session type Run Xclient script is not curently installed on this computer." So I clearle have some left-overs of my xfce desktop left. What should I do?

2009-07-21T20:47:00.000Z	Sarge_TJ	bastidrazor	yes, that's the point. I actually installed Mint on my computer, but I left my home partition untouched, so there's probably some config file that should be edited?
