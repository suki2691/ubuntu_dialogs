2011-03-29T12:14:00.000Z	gaelfx	TheOriginalDude_	I don't think that's possible, and at the very least a bad idea
2011-03-29T12:17:00.000Z	gaelfx	TheOriginalDude_	it *might* be possible with VM, but even if it does work, it won't work well
2011-03-29T12:19:00.000Z	gaelfx	TheOriginalDude_	as long as your hardware permits it, that certainly would be the best way to do it
