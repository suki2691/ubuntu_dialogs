2007-03-20T13:56:00.000Z	hejsa		I got ubuntu on my macbook, i've never been able to boot any new kernels, so i'm running an older one. if i do a update-initramfs then it fails with some mdadm error... mdadm is for raid stuff right? i got one hdd with a couple of partitions on.. do i need this mdadm, i would really like to use the new kernels. Could i install some lvm instead of mdadm.. i don't really know anything, help me
