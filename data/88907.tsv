2008-06-01T01:44:00.000Z	stu	electromagnet	you probably need to use madwifi trunk
2008-06-01T01:45:00.000Z	electromagnet	stu	i was under the impression madwifi only worked with the 32 bit systems currently
2008-06-01T01:46:00.000Z	stu	electromagnet	not sure, I know ndiswrapper is only for 32bit - not sure about madwifi
