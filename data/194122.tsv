2007-12-06T03:06:00.000Z	steve_b		hey - a quick question - how do I see all of the mountable partitions on hard disks on my computer?  I seem to have lost a partition somewhere...
2007-12-06T03:06:00.000Z	pike_	steve_b	sudo fdisk -l may help
2007-12-06T03:06:00.000Z	pike_	steve_b	mount will tell you current mounted
2007-12-06T03:07:00.000Z	steve_b	pike_	thats exactly what I was looking for!  Thanks a lot
