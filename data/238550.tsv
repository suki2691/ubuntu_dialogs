2009-07-24T15:30:00.000Z	NeoTubNinja		is there something else i can use from the command line to remove programs?
2009-07-24T15:31:00.000Z	NeoTubNinja		well, if i were to install compiz with apt-get then try to remove it, i would still be able to use it
2009-07-24T15:31:00.000Z	sash_	NeoTubNinja	 do you use apt-get whathev with sudo?
