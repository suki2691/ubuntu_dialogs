Can I safely use this guide http://embraceubuntu.com/2006/01/29/move-home-to-its-own-partition/ to move folders other than the home folder to the external hard drive?

2011-03-27T02:43:00.000Z	James1293	license2grill	del_diablo: would it be safer to move the entire installation to another partition, or more problematic?
