2007-09-04T15:05:00.000Z	gerro	byonix	gnash is still in beta stage right now, best to just use adobe one
2007-09-04T15:06:00.000Z	gerro	byonix	if your using linux on desktop then don't use 64 bit use 32 bit option x86
2007-09-04T15:07:00.000Z	byonix	gerro	: what do you mean, adobe flash player is a plugin for firefox?, what about the 64 and 32 bit stuff?
