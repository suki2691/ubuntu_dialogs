2007-12-17T02:19:00.000Z	x-man		and i'm back.. got off because i was afraid the processor was going to overheat... wol: i used gparted to partition the hardrive.. clicked "install". got to the 'prepare partitions' part and it still does nothing...
2007-12-17T02:20:00.000Z	x-man		maybe suse has something which prevents ubuntu from overwriting it ;)
2007-12-17T02:21:00.000Z	lockd	x-man	i saw that before, but I think it was fedora having something that a later fedora wouldn't touch
2007-12-17T02:21:00.000Z	lockd	x-man	so I doubt it's Ubuntu specific
