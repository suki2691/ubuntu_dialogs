2009-05-16T16:40:00.000Z	Slart	Marquis-Boy	although I think that is done somewhere in the boot process already
2009-05-16T16:42:00.000Z	Marquis-Boy	Slart	- nah, i am trying to mount a NAS Media drive, but the "mount" parts of the startup scripts happen before the wirelss network is established, so it doesn;t work. A manual sudo mount -a works fine, but i want it to be auto
2009-05-16T16:42:00.000Z	Slart	Marquis-Boy	ahh.. well.. put it late in the boot process.. look at the boot factoid again
