2009-01-02T20:08:00.000Z	thorny_sun		please help anyone-- i've wasted 5 hours on this now-- I need a vim version > 7.1.138 (hardy) cuz of bad bugs in this one, and I'm running Hardy-- how do I do it?
2009-01-02T20:10:00.000Z	allsystemsarego	thorny_sun	sudo aptitude install vim-gnome
2009-01-02T20:12:00.000Z	thorny_sun	allsystemsarego	that just install the current version i have-- .138 --  i need a more recent version (something that is not more than a year old)
2009-01-02T20:12:00.000Z	thorny_sun	allsystemsarego	.138 has bad bugs and it's majorly blocking me at this point
