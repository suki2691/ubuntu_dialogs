2007-05-20T12:57:00.000Z	MacLinuxMaster		I'm having problems in kernels 2.6.12 ... 2.6.20 on Power Mac 6400 Zilog serial ports, I'm going crazy with this, how can I debug it ?
2007-05-20T12:59:00.000Z	MacLinuxMaster		ok, nobody here knows how to debug a serial line connection, right ?
2007-05-20T12:59:00.000Z	Frogzoo	MacLinuxMaster	does wireshark sniff serial lines?
2007-05-20T13:02:00.000Z	MacLinuxMaster	Frogzoo	I really don't know, I need to inspect the port, don't the packets
