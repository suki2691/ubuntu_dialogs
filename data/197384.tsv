2006-03-05T06:03:00.000Z	avu		Part of my music collection is in "strange" formats like m4a, wmv or ogg, is there any program which conviniently converts these to mp3 while/before sending them to my USB mp3 player?
2006-03-05T06:04:00.000Z	amonkey	avu	amarok now features that. atleast the svn version does
2006-03-05T06:09:00.000Z	avu	amonkey	thanks, I would like a sneak peak at 1.4 anyway, so I guess I will give it a try. Any idea if 1.4beta1 also features this already? It's not really clear to me from the changelogs.
