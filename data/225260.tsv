2006-04-03T14:24:00.000Z	brammator		i have installed 5.10 and setup 'root' and 'user' accounts, logged in to gnome as 'user' and try to run synaptic. it asks me for a password, but none of them (root's and user's) doing nothing (no error messages on screen). what's wrong?
2006-04-03T14:25:00.000Z	redguy	brammator	when did you set up the root account? did you do a server or expert install?
2006-04-03T14:26:00.000Z	redguy	brammator	if you want to make the 'user' account be able to use sudo add that user to the admin group
2006-04-03T14:26:00.000Z	brammator	redguy	yeah, thanks, reading about it.
