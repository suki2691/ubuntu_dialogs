2012-06-06T12:21:00.000Z	gvo		I'm running 11.10 and trying to Disable the "Do you want to run ... or display it's contents".  I've found instructions on how to do it using Nautilus however Nautilus is completely different.  The instructions say choose  Edit ▸ Preferences ▸ Behavior ▸ Executable Text Files Run executable ... but there are no visible menus in Nautilus.

2012-06-06T12:23:00.000Z	fidel	gvo	the idea behind global menu is to keep it central and to save space (similar to osx) - some like it - others hate it ;)
