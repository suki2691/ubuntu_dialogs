2006-05-24T13:37:00.000Z	CoffeeBuzz		hey folks. Finding a decent distro for a linux workstation (real-time C coding). I need things like oprofile, ability to configure the kernel for things like oprofile. One thing that scares me is sudo instead of "su -". i assume you can su to root somehow
2006-05-24T13:38:00.000Z	CoffeeBuzz		is the 5.10 amd64 fairly stable?
2006-05-24T13:39:00.000Z	Flannel	CoffeeBuzz	it is.
2006-05-24T13:43:00.000Z	Flannel	CoffeeBuzz	if you install the beta, or any of the RCs, updating to the final is as easy as normal security updates (with more packages)
