2011-10-20T19:46:00.000Z	lucidguy	mbeierl	You can do this with the liveCD?
2011-10-20T19:47:00.000Z	mbeierl	lucidguy	yes.  11.04.  I don't know if 10.10 or earlier actually have the 're-install' option, but i used 11.04 livecd and went into install, and it basically did a recover of the installed os.  i had to re-install some packages after, but it was pretty good at getting me 90% of the way back to operational in a very short time
2011-10-20T19:48:00.000Z	mbeierl	lucidguy	but, again, i can't stress enough - backup anything important first, just in case
