2006-01-11T12:01:00.000Z	marc__		Can someone point me toward a link that discusses the major diff between Ubuntu and mandriva.  I am a mandriva user and am looking to switch distros.
2006-01-11T12:02:00.000Z	trappist	marc__	I used to be a mandriva user.  they're similar in that they try to make everything 'just work' and they're both primarily desktop distros.  I think ubuntu does a better job, and it's community-driven rather than corporate.
2006-01-11T12:07:00.000Z	marc__	trappist	in comparison to mandriva, what is the range of installable software, I mean is there an equiv PLF type repo?
2006-01-11T12:08:00.000Z	trappist	marc__	yes, I don't know of a single thing you mandriva has packaged that ubuntu doesn't, and the 'restricted' repositories are even easier to setup and use in ubuntu.
