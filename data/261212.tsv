2005-02-06T15:49:00.000Z	chrismurf		So - I'm trying to get M4A / AAC / MP4 (not encrypted - standard ones) support working with gstreamer / rhythmbox.  I have all the gst plugins installed, but it still doesn't work.
2005-02-06T15:51:00.000Z	chrismurf		anybody know how to do AAC / MP4's under ubuntu?  I can't figure out what gstreamer plugin / whatever I am missing.
