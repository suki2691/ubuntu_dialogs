2011-07-24T03:08:00.000Z	Alexandra13		Lol sorry
2011-07-24T03:10:00.000Z	Alexandra13		Well basically, I have 3 OS's. I'm on Windows 7 now, I am using VBox to run DamnSmallLinux and Ubuntu. The first two have full internet access. Ubuntu doesn't. I'm using an ssh tunnel to get internet to firefox. It works fine. The problem is that I want to use KVIrc and it won't connect to any servers.  I don't know how to sort this out.
