2008-12-22T00:58:00.000Z	plinioplug		Hi. I installed Ubuntu 8.10 and get no resolutions higher than 800x600. Anyone knows how to fix that?

2008-12-22T01:00:00.000Z	Zalmoxis	plinioplug	check in hardware drivers if it is installed
2008-12-22T01:01:00.000Z	Zalmoxis	plinioplug	what happens when you try changing the screen resolution?
