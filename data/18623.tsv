2012-09-27T17:21:00.000Z	xwalk		I'm trying to find a way to backup home directory files from my desktop to a remote local server so that I can sync my laptop to the server every day to keep data conformed between the three machines. Rsync seems a little too much to handle that kind of thing. Is there any other appropriate alternative?

2012-09-27T17:23:00.000Z	xwalk	bootboot	That was my way of saying I'm getting terribly lost in the man pages for something I wanted to set up quickly.
2012-09-27T17:23:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	xwalk	 there's 'lucky backup', a GUI for rsync, there's also grsync
