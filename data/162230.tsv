2006-10-28T16:48:00.000Z	__osh__	nikin	Nope. Odd thing is that I get library errors on "grep", "sed" and "head" from the script but not from cli.
2006-10-28T16:50:00.000Z	__osh__	nikin	Like this -> grep: error while loading shared libraries: libc.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2006-10-28T16:51:00.000Z	__osh__	nikin	It's a normal sh-file. And yes, it appears to be linked to glibc.
