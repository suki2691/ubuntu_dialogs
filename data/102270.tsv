2010-06-26T08:13:00.000Z	SGottl7227		hello out there
2010-06-26T08:14:00.000Z	SGottl7227		is there a xubuntu server?
2010-06-26T08:14:00.000Z	rww	SGottl7227	nope. Ubuntu Server doesn't include a graphical user interface, so there's no need for a second one for different GUIs
2010-06-26T08:37:00.000Z	rww	SGottl7227	try asking in #puppylinux; other distros are offtopic for #ubuntu
