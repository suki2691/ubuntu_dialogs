2009-07-28T00:20:00.000Z	aresnick	legend2440	Yeah, I wasn't sure if that actually ran updatedb or not--I want to be sure to avoid altering the existing database.
2009-07-28T00:21:00.000Z	aresnick	legend2440	But I think I can just locate '*' > files.txt
2009-07-28T00:22:00.000Z	legend2440	aresnick	how were these files removed? because synaptic keeeps a history of packages removed in Files>History
