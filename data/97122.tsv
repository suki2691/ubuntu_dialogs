2012-10-01T00:58:00.000Z	cablop		sigh... now... i want a recommendation about ext3 or ext4 on a 2TB partition, checking cylinders and sizes it seems i'll be fine with this disk, it is a little bit below the limit
2012-10-01T00:59:00.000Z	mattias_	cablop	isn't ext4 better for everything?
2012-10-01T00:59:00.000Z	cablop		now... this partition is for fileserver and backup storage, so what partition system between ext3 and ext4 would give me better behavior/performance on that scenario?
2012-10-01T00:59:00.000Z	cablop	mattias_	afaik, yes... just two things make me think about ext3... more tools do exist for it that for ext4
