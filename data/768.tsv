2012-10-16T22:50:00.000Z	temporary	wols	 Sory I am lost already! I have Korganizer -q in my {System}{Startup Applications} but I don't think it runs. Wherre would I pu the nohup korganizer &  ?
2012-10-16T22:57:00.000Z	temporary	wols	Sorry I did not know what to do with the "command" you told me. Yes Korganizer is a GUI. I am running it from {System}{Startup Applications}. It runs fine, but I need it "silent" as a service.
2012-10-16T22:59:00.000Z	temporary	wols	So what I am hoping for (is this absurd, perhaps) is for it to run silently the way it would when I run it iin the forerground, i.e. to access its calendar and implement the "Alarms" which are programmed in.
2012-10-16T23:13:00.000Z	temporary	wols	Ah, that sounds promising -- start minimized --  it would serve the purpose, I expect. I have failed to find a list of switches which would include "-minimized", can you advise?
