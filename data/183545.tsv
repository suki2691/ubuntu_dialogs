2007-07-10T08:17:00.000Z	`Kevin		Is possible for me to install Ubuntu to my hard drive A and use it as my only operating system? I can't figure out how to install it without grub.
2007-07-10T08:18:00.000Z	`Kevin		macgow: Erm.
2007-07-10T08:18:00.000Z	`Kevin		I dunno. I keep getting errors with GRUB
2007-07-10T08:18:00.000Z	Pelo	`Kevin	 it needs grub for the other bits,  but you can change the delay so it boot directly to ubuntu with no menu
