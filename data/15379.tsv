2012-05-31T05:27:00.000Z	Gushings		Hello, I am trying to use my iGPU instead of my GPU for my monitor.  I was able to get the motherboard to use the iGPU but when it passes bios the screen turns purple then goes black permanently.
2012-05-31T05:27:00.000Z	Gushings		I need to -keep- the drivers I have for the GPU. I'm working with CUDA.
2012-05-31T05:27:00.000Z	Gushings		Any tips?
