2007-09-05T09:39:00.000Z	wishie		i am building a PC for a lady at work, and I am deciding between putting windows or ubuntu on it. I would prefer ubuntu, but have to know its going to be able to do what she needs. Internet stuff is fine, and i know Ubuntu is capable of that.. What i am concerned about though, is her Printer. Its an Epson Photo Stylus R230, and she wants to be able to print photos from her camera on it. A4 and also 6'x4' photo paper. Where can i find out about the state 
2007-09-05T09:41:00.000Z	wishie		i basically need to know if photo quality prints are available on that printer in ubuntu. Id MUCH rather give her this new pc with linux on it, as opposed to windows. especially since its got such simple tasks (no gaming etc)
