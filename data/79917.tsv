2008-09-12T06:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	X_	 depends on the filessizes. ntfs is  fine in most cases these days.
2008-09-12T06:01:00.000Z	X_	dr_willis	does that work on both systems?
2008-09-12T06:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	X_	 yes - linux can read/write ntfs. and windows can read/write ext2/3 now a days also with the right tools.
