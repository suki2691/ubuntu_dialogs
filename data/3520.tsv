2012-04-30T06:23:00.000Z	ClintZ		After an release upgrade GDM was replaced with unity-greeter (GDM seems to be broken now) and unity-greeter does not allow me to login as user "clint".  What is the issue?
2012-04-30T06:23:00.000Z	escott	ClintZ	gdm was replaced by lightdm
2012-04-30T06:24:00.000Z	ClintZ	escott	 OK.  Maybe I should give that a try?  Any ideas why user wouldn't be listed?  I suppose I could create a new one..
2012-04-30T06:25:00.000Z	escott	ClintZ	what is not listed? a normal user account? what is the uid of that user?
