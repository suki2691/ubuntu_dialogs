2011-09-24T01:22:00.000Z	NathanWW		I have some questions about Clusters as i'm looking at building one for the fun of it. however throught all my research ive not been able to get some simple questions answerd is there anyone around that knows some about clusters? and debian? and that would perhaps have a few min to spare and maby get me looking in the right directions.

2011-09-24T01:22:00.000Z	yeats	NathanWW	why don't you just ask your question(s)?
2011-09-24T01:23:00.000Z	yeats	NathanWW	someone may know - if not here, probably in #ubuntu-server
