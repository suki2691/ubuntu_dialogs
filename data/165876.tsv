2008-05-20T22:43:00.000Z	Insectoid		I'm going for my first install of Ubuntu 8.04.  I've checked my hardware, figured out how to get speech during install (I'm a blind computer user), and am generally ready to try it.  I've got an Intel t7100 or so (64-bit whatever the number)  I realize that Linux supports up to 64 gb of ram, even with 32-bit processors.  Is there any real advantage in using the 64-bit Ubuntu Desktop installation?  How about disadvantages?

2008-05-20T22:46:00.000Z	mewt	Insectoid	only the server kernel has PAE pre-compiled
