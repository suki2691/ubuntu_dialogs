2009-06-02T05:22:00.000Z	Link23		Hi, my hard drive says that there's 25 gigabytes in it while there is only 13. No hidden files ext 3.  Can I get some help?
2009-06-02T05:23:00.000Z	linxeh	Link23	how are you getting that info ?
2009-06-02T05:24:00.000Z	Link23	linxeh	I am going into properties for the 25 Gigabytes.  Also I have a 13 gigabyte folder and a 180 megabyte folder.
2009-06-02T05:24:00.000Z	linxeh	Link23	what happens if you type df -h at the console?
