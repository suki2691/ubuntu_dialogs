2012-11-22T15:19:00.000Z	Zumochi		Good day, I am unable to boot into a fresh install of Ubuntu 11.10, all I get is a blinking cursor. I don't even see GRUB nor can I force into it holding SHIFT
2012-11-22T15:21:00.000Z	Zumochi		Okay, I'll try that.
2012-11-22T15:21:00.000Z	Zumochi		Do I have to reinstall again, though?
2012-11-22T15:21:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Zumochi	 did you read what ubottu says?
