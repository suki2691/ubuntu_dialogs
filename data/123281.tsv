If the screensaver activates while the SNES is playing (which is easy to do as the controller stick does not reset the screensaver's idle count) then the keyboard & mouse both become locked out (cannot even do ctrl + alt + backspace)

2007-12-05T12:03:00.000Z	Dralid		Is there anyway to disable the screensaver while a program is running?
