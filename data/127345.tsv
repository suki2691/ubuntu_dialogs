2008-04-24T03:19:00.000Z	rhombus		So, how can I get the ubuntu mysql server to listen on all interfaces?
2008-04-24T03:20:00.000Z	rhombus		I've removed bind-address and skip-networking from the my.cnf file, as per MySQL docs, and it's still only listening on the loopback interface
2008-04-24T03:21:00.000Z	lwizardl	rhombus	did you restart mysql?
2008-04-24T03:22:00.000Z	rhombus	lwizardl	yeah
