2007-10-19T07:08:00.000Z	Dunas		Out of curiosity, is there an easy way to search my entire system for files related to Flash? I think that's the reason Firefox/Swiftweasel keep freezing on me.
2007-10-19T07:09:00.000Z	Dunas		...ok, and how would I go about uninstalling Flash plugin? :X
2007-10-19T07:09:00.000Z	Xanthus	Dunas	search the following directories: /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins, /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins and /home/user/.mozilla/plugins
2007-10-19T07:10:00.000Z	Xanthus	Dunas	delete the files flashplayer.xpt and  libflashplayer.so files when you find them
