2006-11-27T09:21:00.000Z	Brunellus	caffiendo	did it not work out of the box?
2006-11-27T09:21:00.000Z	Brunellus		I think the rausb module is in the edgy kernel
2006-11-27T09:22:00.000Z	caffiendo	Brunellus	I plugged it in once booted, and nothing happened.  I figured it wouldn't auto detect it, should I just reboot?  I've never added new hardware with Linux yet.
