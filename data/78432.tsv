2008-09-25T18:13:00.000Z	impje	ushimitsudoki	How about an nvidia card with QXGA resolution (2048 x 1536) that works under linux?
2008-09-25T18:13:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	impje	I already said the 8800GT series supports that resoultion and it works fine in linux. I would assume that particular resolution would work under ubuntu like any other supported resoultion
