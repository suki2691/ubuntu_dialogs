2009-02-02T06:55:00.000Z	koshar2	kurisuto	you may be able to install it depending on its dependencys, however adding the repo is always a better way to go
2009-02-02T06:56:00.000Z	kurisuto	koshar2	Any pointer on how to add the repo?  Do I edit /etc/apt/sources.list by hand?
2009-02-02T06:57:00.000Z	koshar2	kurisuto	you will need to manually change the sources list them
