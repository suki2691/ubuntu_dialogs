2012-05-04T20:31:00.000Z	ralfska		Can you tell me why Ubuntu doesn't fully shut down my computer? I have to press that power button and hold it.
2012-05-04T20:32:00.000Z	ralfska		yes, you too lupian?
2012-05-04T20:32:00.000Z	oCean	ralfska	adding -P to the shutdown command should send a poweroff request
2012-05-04T20:33:00.000Z	ralfska	oCean	yes, this might be a work around but I'd like it that it shut down by itself
