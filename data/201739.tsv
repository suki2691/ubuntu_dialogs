2006-04-11T10:04:00.000Z	t1n_l0tus		I'm trying to get MudOS working, but I can't seem to "make" successfully.  I've never been good at compiling, is anyone up to helping me?
2006-04-11T10:06:00.000Z	IdleOne	t1n_l0tus	you probably need to install build-essential sudo apt-get install  build-essential
2006-04-11T10:06:00.000Z	IdleOne	t1n_l0tus	then try your make command again
2006-04-11T10:07:00.000Z	IdleOne	t1n_l0tus	 put the error on pastebin paste.ubuntu-nl.org and give us the url
