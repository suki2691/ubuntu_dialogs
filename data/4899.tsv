2012-03-03T21:49:00.000Z	callaghan		Hello, I just tried to download Precise Beta 1 and went to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/TechnicalOverview/Beta1 . There is a link to the Netboot version of Ubuntu (http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/netboot/12.04/), but this Link is dead. Is there another way to get the netboot image for precise beta 1?
