2009-04-27T21:22:00.000Z	Hisotaso		i ran the jaunty upgrade, but it failed towards the end and i stupidly didnt record the error. I see some subtle changes, and when i go into system monitor, it lists my version as 9.04 jaunty, but kernel version is 2.6.27-9, and i was under the impression that jaunty used kernel 2.6.28....any suggestions?
2009-04-27T21:23:00.000Z	Hisotaso		also, when i run update manager the option to upgrade is no longer available
