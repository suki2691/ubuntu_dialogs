2007-09-01T08:09:00.000Z	HEP85		the fonts in firefox are too small. what could be the problem?
2007-09-01T08:09:00.000Z	benzs_s	HEP85	ctrl + mouse wheel (or equivalent) will make fonts bigger
2007-09-01T08:12:00.000Z	HEP85	benzs_s	I know that. But I was wondering why the same setting (normal) looks way smaller on linux than on windows
2007-09-01T08:12:00.000Z	benzs_s	HEP85	oh, i see. i can't say i ever noticed a clear difference tbh with you :\
