2012-04-29T10:52:00.000Z	gaelfx	Mayazcherquoi	you have to make it so that when the laptop lid is closed, the screens are not turned off, probably have to use gconf-editor
2012-04-29T10:54:00.000Z	Mayazcherquoi	gaelfx	Yeah, but what setting? :-/
2012-04-29T10:55:00.000Z	gaelfx	Mayazcherquoi	can't remember exactly which one, can't you search for 'lid'?
