2006-12-06T06:42:00.000Z	Myria		i downloaded and burned 6.06 both x86-32 and x86-64.  i installed x86-32 and it installed X, gnome, and such.  i installed x86-64 and all i got was a command prompt.  the x86-32 installer was graphics mode; the x86-64 installer was text mode.  i don't understand why they're so different, and selecting 10000 different things in dselect doesn't sound fun.
2006-12-06T06:44:00.000Z	Myria		why does the x86-64 installer act entirely differently from the x86-32 installer of the same version?
2006-12-06T06:46:00.000Z	Myria		i guess nobody has heard of my problem before...  guess i'll go use fedora core
