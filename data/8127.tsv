2011-11-02T08:13:00.000Z	EPops		Hello, which file system should I use on Ubuntu Server edition if I am going to be installing a bittorrent client on the server machine?
2011-11-02T08:14:00.000Z	CarlFK	EPops	the default (ext4 I think)
2011-11-02T08:21:00.000Z	CarlFK	EPops	best to just go with the defaults.  lots of though has gone into them to make sure they work.
2011-11-02T08:23:00.000Z	EPops	CarlFK	Thanks, I am new so maybe later when I learn more I will play around with LVM.
