2006-06-01T08:12:00.000Z	NobodHere		hey all!  My ubuntu server box just started acting up -big- time about 4 hours ago.  It is acting like DNS is broken, but it's not.  Apache and MySQL are fine; postfix is taking forever to respond to SMTP connections, same with cyrus and sshd.  Bind(named) is fine.
2006-06-01T08:14:00.000Z	NobodHere		anyone see my message?
