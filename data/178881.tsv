2010-02-23T06:14:00.000Z	jrib	kubuntu	be more specific
2010-02-23T06:16:00.000Z	jrib	kubuntu	you still need to be more specific.  What CMS?  What do you do exactly to see the error?  Pastebin the exact error
2010-02-23T06:19:00.000Z	jrib	kubuntu	you probably want to go to networx support channels (irc, forums, mailing list or whatever)
