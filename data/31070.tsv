2010-06-22T06:20:00.000Z	doormat81		I've been searching Google for information on how to sync my iPod Touch within Ubuntu (sans emulation).  Most of the results I've found are very outdated and the ones that are relevant mention only music.  Is there no way to also sync your installed apps?

2010-06-22T06:22:00.000Z	doormat81	xangua	and even music syncing isn't possible out of the box, right?  I see no option in Rhythmbox to sync with my iPod (though it recognizes the device and plays the files just fine).
