2008-12-30T10:18:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny		I'm having a problem with java. I can't view a java applet. http://www.javatester.org/enabled.html reports that java is not enabled, ff3 reports that it is. how do I procede?
2008-12-30T10:19:00.000Z	nickrud	Rabbitbunny	what version of java does firefox say it has?
2008-12-30T10:25:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	nickrud	Good thought path. Firefox is a liar. Installing java now.
2008-12-30T10:25:00.000Z	nickrud	Rabbitbunny	be sure to install sun-java6-plugin
