I need Read/Write access from a user account (alex). I can edit the fstab with no problems, but when it mounts it says I do not have permission to access it.

2006-04-26T09:40:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	gnaunited	what is your fstab line?
2006-04-26T09:41:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	gnaunited	uid=youruserid -- that should give you read access.
