2009-10-04T12:30:00.000Z	IvoGeorgiev		I'm compiling xsplash in Slackware, but in the log I get "[10:27:33:298546654 - WRN] Unable to call to request name.  You probably don't have sufficient privileges"
2009-10-04T12:30:00.000Z	IvoGeorgiev		any ideas?
2009-10-04T12:30:00.000Z	DecodeX01	IvoGeorgiev	you need root access
