2006-08-19T15:38:00.000Z	Aar0n		hello again
2006-08-19T15:39:00.000Z	Aar0n		I ran the md5 checker and it gave me E2E5E0BFB2EDFFD2CE02DD77BDA4558E for the 6.06 desktop install ISO.
2006-08-19T15:40:00.000Z	itsmegb	Aar0n	which disk have you downloaded?
2006-08-19T15:41:00.000Z	Aar0n	itsmegb	The 6.06 i386 700mb ISO off bittorrent. I think I have found the answer to my failing install anyway.
