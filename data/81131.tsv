2008-12-10T12:36:00.000Z	gcbirzan	Everett	you can try aptitude update; aptitude dist-upgrade
2008-12-10T12:37:00.000Z	Everett	gcbirzan	I tried apt-get update apt-get dist-upgrade with no luck.  is hat the same?
2008-12-10T12:37:00.000Z	gcbirzan	Everett	Yeah. You must have intrepid in /etc/apt/sources.list, instead of what distribution you have now.
