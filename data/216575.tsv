2012-10-10T13:23:00.000Z	rocks3		how do I write a diff command to compare two directories and output differences to a separate text file
2012-10-10T13:25:00.000Z	ardchoille	rocks3	diff /path/dir1 /path/dir2 >> /path/differences.txt  # Is that what you want?
2012-10-10T13:26:00.000Z	ardchoille	rocks3	I'm not sure that's exactly correct but won't cause any problems if the command fails
