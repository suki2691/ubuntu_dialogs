2007-04-29T11:20:00.000Z	PuRu		does anyone have some time for a noob? i use 7.04, activated the nvidia driver and x doesnt start anymore "no screens found" so i'm guessing there's something wrong with my xorg.conf
2007-04-29T11:20:00.000Z	poje	PuRu	you should switch to a terminal (ctrl-alt-f1) and run the x reconfig script - someone here knows the command or you can look it up on google
2007-04-29T11:21:00.000Z	poje	PuRu	good luck :)
2007-04-29T11:41:00.000Z	PuRu	poje	the only thing in the log is "no screens found"
