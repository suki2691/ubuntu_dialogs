2007-02-22T07:35:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	psykidellic	there's a way to do that... read the Ubuntu guide just clicking on the ? icon
2007-02-22T07:36:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	psykidellic	go in 'Working with your desktop' and then 'Advanced Desktop Configurations' and there you will find a short guide to do what you want
