2009-04-21T11:37:00.000Z	kenyon	Thursap	dmidecode --type memory
2009-04-21T11:40:00.000Z	Thursap	kenyon	in the "speed" parameter, it shows: "Unknown" :(
2009-04-21T11:42:00.000Z	kenyon	Thursap	hmm, don't know. One of my boxes gives no info, the other gives lots of info. Depends on hardware I guess.
