2010-03-07T04:22:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	sinisa	What do you mean by "nothing happens"?
2010-03-07T04:24:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	sinisa	is it just spinning the CD and such? That can take quite a loooong time, depending on your hardware
2010-03-07T04:25:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	sinisa	I don't think there is one, no. How long have you been waiting? Have you tried restarting the whole process?
