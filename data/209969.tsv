2007-03-25T08:32:00.000Z	StanRex		apparently, feisty has a better support of raid0 than edgy
2007-03-25T08:32:00.000Z	StanRex		would it be suicide for someone who never installed linux to try to install the feisty beta?
2007-03-25T08:33:00.000Z	LjL	StanRex	it's not any harder than Edgy or Dapper - *if* it works. if there's some problems (which is likely since it's a beta), you'll be in trouble.
