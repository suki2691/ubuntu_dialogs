2006-09-21T09:30:00.000Z	Teethy		Hi - i am a new to Ubuntu and want to migrate - during the installation process I continue to get error while partitioning, my questions is when I am asked ' How do you want to partion disk' is the slider to define the New Linux partiont OR does it mean how to resize the windows NTFS partition - im sorry a lame question but i need help
2006-09-21T09:31:00.000Z	scrp	Teethy	Ubuntu is asking if how big the partition should be, thus resizing your current ntfs partition to fit another partition in there
2006-09-21T09:32:00.000Z	Teethy	scrp	that means - if my old NTFS partition is 60 GB and I want 10 for Linux I woudl set the slideer down to 50 or shoudl i define it as 10GB?
2006-09-21T09:33:00.000Z	scrp	Teethy	err, not 100% sure, but i think you define it as 10GB (i've only set up Ubuntu once)
