2005-05-27T11:52:00.000Z	hillel		[Newbie]  I want to add sources to apt-get. I uncommented sources at my sources.list but I now get an error message: "couldn't stat source package..." for the uncommented sources. Any ideas?
2005-05-27T11:52:00.000Z	Seveas	hillel	run apt-get update or het the reload button in synaptic
2005-05-27T11:53:00.000Z	hillel	Seveas	OK, trying it now.
