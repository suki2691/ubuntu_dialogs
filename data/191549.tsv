2007-12-05T03:19:00.000Z	Lhademmor		Hey, I'm in need of help... The past few days, my CPU has been going nuts on my laptop. The CPU-light is constantly flashing, and the computer has become extremely slow. It sometimes even takes up to 10 seconds to exit the screensaver! What can have gone wrong?
2007-12-05T03:19:00.000Z	jimmygoon	Lhademmor	run "top" in a terminal and see what is eating cpu / memory
2007-12-05T03:20:00.000Z	Lhademmor	jimmygoon	right now trackerd is using ~45% of my CPU... Could it be that?
2007-12-05T03:20:00.000Z	jimmygoon	Lhademmor	um, yeah
