2008-02-05T09:09:00.000Z	Wrec	erawfish	my wireless issue only occurs in the new kernel. I'm using feisty's kernel right now, actually. The 2nd to most recent kernel gave me grub errors that I spent entire weekends trying to fix.

2008-02-05T09:10:00.000Z	gilda	Wrec	one of the things that u need to make sure u have installed with the new kernel is the kernel headers and then u should be able to just modprobe ath_pci
