2008-04-30T10:24:00.000Z	Mathman		ha.  this channel is madness.  kinda like gentoo back in the day
2008-04-30T10:24:00.000Z	sessh1234	Mathman	do you know of an ubuntu equivalent for emerge --depclean?
2008-04-30T10:25:00.000Z	Mathman	sessh1234	not off  the top of my head.  but if I recall there's certainly something like that.  apt-slog --euthanize--orphans or something.  ha, nah, but orphans sounds about right anyway
