2012-02-09T15:32:00.000Z	JadedJacob		If I use gnome-fallback, which version of gnome will it install?
2012-02-09T15:34:00.000Z	melvincv	JadedJacob	Gnome3 with a Gnome 2 look. Without the extra effects.
2012-02-09T15:41:00.000Z	melvincv	JadedJacob	I'm confused too, with Gnome3.
2012-02-09T18:19:00.000Z	melvincv	JadedJacob	both will work...
