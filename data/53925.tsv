2010-01-06T10:05:00.000Z	dsnyders		Is there much of a difference between 64bit and 32 bit versions of Ubuntu?
2010-01-06T10:05:00.000Z	dtownhero	dsnyders	yes, 64 bit handles memory allocation a lot better
2010-01-06T10:07:00.000Z	dsnyders	dtownhero	32 bit only goes up to 4G ram?  (I'm considering upgrading my motherboard.  I want lots of RAM for doing virtual machines).
2010-01-06T10:08:00.000Z	dtownhero	dsnyders	32bit will not handle 4gigs of ram as effectively as 64
