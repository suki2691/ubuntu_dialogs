2009-07-02T00:01:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	xiong	probably means there are updates available. Install them.
2009-07-02T00:01:00.000Z	xiong	linuxguy2009	my difficulty here is that i rely on synaptic to do that sort of stuff...
2009-07-02T00:04:00.000Z	xiong	linuxguy2009	sorry if that's a dweebish statement -- it's true
