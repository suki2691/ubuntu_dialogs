2010-07-31T06:41:00.000Z	Xaifas		installed and configured my ssh server and i want to see if I can connect to it from the internet , can I simulate it if I ssh to another box then ssh to current one?

2010-07-31T06:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Xaifas	 try the ssh -v or -vv or -vvv option to get verbose output and messages. and check the server logs.
