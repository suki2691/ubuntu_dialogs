2008-03-06T07:26:00.000Z	cellofellow		hello. I'm having a bit of trouble with Firestarter.
2008-03-06T07:27:00.000Z	cellofellow		I have a laptop, so I want to lock it down while on the road, but NetworkManager scews around with Firestarter. Firestarter refuses to start at boot, for one. It also complains about my two NIC's (one Wireless using NDISWrapper, the other is a regular onboard Ethernet.)
