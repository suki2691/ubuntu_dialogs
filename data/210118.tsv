2005-10-31T12:56:00.000Z	mikal_		I have a HP PSC on my XP box and im trying to print wirelessly from my Ubuntu notebook. I have all the connection info and the printer says "Ready" but nothing ever prints.

2005-10-31T12:57:00.000Z	CarlFK_	mikal_	- i have seen that missing username too, not sure what is going on, but I was able to print no problem to my win2000 pritner
