2008-01-09T02:21:00.000Z	bcardarella		Robyrails: are you looking for a good ROR editor?
2008-01-09T02:22:00.000Z	bcardarella		Well to add to the discussion I use Aptana Studio and Gedit. I'm slowly weening myself off of Aptana though... with a little time you can configuring Gedit to act very similar to Textmate. The only downer is that I haven't found any SVN integration yet.
