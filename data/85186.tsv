2008-07-18T02:18:00.000Z	pgreptom	Xepra	I'm trying to use the driver the "new" nvidia driver in apt-get... the one "Restricted Hardawre" uses.. but it won't startx with it, says no screen found.. if I dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, it works again.. it uses the default driver I suppose
2008-07-18T02:21:00.000Z	pgreptom	Xepra	Sigh.  What do you suggest I do?
2008-07-18T02:21:00.000Z	Xepra	pgreptom	 there are a bunch of howtos for the different nvidia drivers,  i would go with the one you download and run from the nvidia site personally
