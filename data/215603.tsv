2008-01-10T05:53:00.000Z	Murrlin		hello everyone
2008-01-10T05:54:00.000Z	Murrlin		I'm missing my window titlebars. I cannot alt tab between windows, I cannot see or put a workspace switcher on my panel, and, to top it all, 'show desktop' tells me I have no window manager running
2008-01-10T05:54:00.000Z	Murrlin		what should/can I do?
2008-01-10T05:55:00.000Z	soundray	Murrlin	run a window manager, e.g. metacity
