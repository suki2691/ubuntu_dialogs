2007-07-11T05:39:00.000Z	xcocox		Hey, I have a machine here that I don't have access to a monitor or a keyboard. I can put the cd in (ubuntu server), and assuming it boots, it'll run. Is there a way I can install it via a connection from another computer on my network?
2007-07-11T05:41:00.000Z	xcocox		Anyone? Remote installation of ubuntu?
2007-07-11T05:42:00.000Z	Vletmix	xcocox	probably gonna be pretty tricky
2007-07-11T05:43:00.000Z	xcocox	Vletmix	Hmm, would you happen to have a link?
