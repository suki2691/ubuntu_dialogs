2005-11-26T10:31:00.000Z	smo	Ep|phany	have you tried running it from a terminal/konsole to see if it spits out any errors?
2005-11-26T10:33:00.000Z	smo	Ep|phany	not sure, I've never used it.  my generic fault finding steps for any app are watching the console for errors, then trying again with strace and seeing if it stops on anything noticable
