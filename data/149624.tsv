2009-07-21T22:57:00.000Z	veritos		Can you make apt-get (not aptitude) say "install this package, but not a certain recommended package"? For example, if I want ubuntu-restricted-extras but not Flash?
2009-07-21T22:59:00.000Z	Pici	veritos	ubuntu-restricted-extras is a metapackage that depends on other packages, such as flashplugin-nonfree.  If you use your favorite package manager to show you its dependencies, then you could install any or all of them manually.
