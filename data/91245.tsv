2009-12-21T05:54:00.000Z	SilverFox		I'm interested in building a mail server.  I'm moderately familiar with qmail, but it sounds like exim is the MTA of choice for ubuntu?  I need to be able to support SMTP Auth and SSL, and plan to set up webmail as well.  I only use ubuntu server, so should I stick with qmail, or take a try with Exim?  (This needs to be a toaster as well, multiple domains)
