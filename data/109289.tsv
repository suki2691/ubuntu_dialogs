2009-08-25T03:31:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy		Again I ask--and mnaines, feel free not to answer--how can I tell Ubuntu to stop changing my power profile by itself?
2009-08-25T03:33:00.000Z	Halitech	TheMusicGuy	how does it change it? (sorry, missed most of the first part of your issue)
2009-08-25T03:34:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	Halitech	Whenever I insert or remove the AC or resume from standby, the power profile changes. It used to go to OnDemand mode, but now it seems to be going to Performance mode.
2009-08-25T03:36:00.000Z	Halitech	TheMusicGuy	never heard of that and I'm using a desktop so dont have any clue how to help
