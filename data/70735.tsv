2008-12-25T13:09:00.000Z	Caldrin_home		Hi! I updated from Ubuntu 8.04 to 8.10 recently. This removed KDE3.5 and installed KDE4 on my system. Since KDE4 is far from being usable, I want to move back to 3.5
2008-12-25T13:09:00.000Z	Caldrin_home		How can I do this?
2008-12-25T13:11:00.000Z	|peon|	Caldrin_home	unless you find a backport package or install it yourself
2008-12-25T13:13:00.000Z	Caldrin_home	|peon|	Bad. Well, thanks for your help. I'm going to open a bug report.
