2010-01-29T13:15:00.000Z	Diverdude		Is there any way you can have like a 5 day local weather forecast displayed on the desktop...e.g. in the calender window in the upper right corner?
2010-01-29T13:16:00.000Z	firekool	Diverdude	search weather in the symantic package manager
2010-01-29T13:18:00.000Z	Diverdude	firekool	isn't it called the synaptic packet manager?
