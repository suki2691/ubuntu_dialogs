2007-04-05T12:05:00.000Z	angrist		then ping the ip addresses of those dns servers
2007-04-05T12:06:00.000Z	mzanfardino	angrist	I can ping them both (and they are correct, I have confirmed them), however I still can not ping any internal servers by name (i.e. my printer which is brn_7a89F5)
2007-04-05T12:12:00.000Z	mzanfardino	angrist	how can I confirm my search path?
