2006-03-13T09:12:00.000Z	spiritz	linuxdev	no need, works as a regular keyboard
2006-03-13T09:13:00.000Z	linuxdev	spiritz	I don't use ps2/usb receivers, just use the infrared port on the board
2006-03-13T09:14:00.000Z	linuxdev	spiritz	I don't quite understand, if I put a infrared keyboard in front of my laptop's infrared receiver, will it work???
