2011-07-25T18:25:00.000Z	norpan111		Hello guys, im running into some issues while installing ubuntu 11.04 from USB. im getting at the grub menu and tries to launch live-mode but fails with hardware error. Same if i install Wubi as a windows application. Im running windows 7 with i7 870 and motherboard gigabyte p55a-ud4 and two GTX 460. Shouldnt my CPU be supported? I never had this issue before
2011-07-25T18:26:00.000Z	aetas	norpan111	giving the error would help
2011-07-25T18:26:00.000Z	norpan111	aetas	dont know the exact numbers since there is alot of them. but its saying something about CPU and just "hardware error " and a bunch of numbers
2011-07-25T18:27:00.000Z	norpan111	aetas	and then it ends with "reboots in 30 sec"
