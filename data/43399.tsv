2012-01-06T18:13:00.000Z	nightshade209	mediajunkie	is there an option to manually re-sync it or something? sorry, but i never used evolution for any amount of time...
2012-01-06T18:14:00.000Z	nightshade209	mediajunkie	i know this doesn't answer your question, but what about thunderbird?
2012-01-06T18:16:00.000Z	nightshade209	mediajunkie	ok... maybe there's something that allows you to import from evolution to thunderbird?
