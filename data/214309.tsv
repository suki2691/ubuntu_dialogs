2008-03-17T17:19:00.000Z	yowshi		wubi wtf?
2008-03-17T17:20:00.000Z	yowshi		and how does it virtually garauntee that the end user will never switch?
2008-03-17T17:21:00.000Z	yowshi		one thing i wouldnt mind though is the ability to install while already booted in windows. not into the windows partition but into it's own
2008-03-17T17:21:00.000Z	rsk	yowshi	cause it's slower than normal ubuntu afaik, gives of a bad vibe
