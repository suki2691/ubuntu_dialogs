2007-08-11T11:43:00.000Z	Aethelred		I've got a new box, and am having trouble with an Ubuntu install; 7.04, desktop, 64bit ; I think there's some issue with my 8800 GTS video card; after the kernal loads my screen goes blank.
2007-08-11T11:43:00.000Z	Aethelred		safe mode is no help
2007-08-11T11:43:00.000Z	Aethelred		and I'm wondering if this channel might help more
2007-08-11T11:43:00.000Z	paotzu	Aethelred	is that an ATI card?
