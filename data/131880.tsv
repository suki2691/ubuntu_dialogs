2007-06-06T11:33:00.000Z	xerophyte		i have IBM thinkpad T43 but i am not able to get the Fn+F7 to work to switch the LDC to the screen and back to the LCD .. does anybody know how can i switch between it
2007-06-06T11:34:00.000Z	almien	xerophyte	isn't it just f7 without the fn key?
2007-06-06T11:36:00.000Z	xerophyte	almien	mine says to press Fn +F7
2007-06-06T11:37:00.000Z	almien	xerophyte	I just meant that doesn't it do the blue-actions by default, and you use fn key to get F7 itself
