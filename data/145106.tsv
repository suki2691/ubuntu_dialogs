Things I have read seem to indicate that I could have WinXP (for dual-boot purposes) installed on an LVM-controlled partition, that it's a good idea, that it's a bad idea, that I have to wipe the whole disk in order to set it up, and that I could set it up without disturbing my existing WinXP installation and then add existing partitions to LVM control. Which parts of that are most correct? :-)
