2010-02-14T17:56:00.000Z	progre55		I have a simple bash script.. and it was two commands in it. does bash wait until the first command finishes or does it fire them one after another?
2010-02-14T17:57:00.000Z	aluex	progre55	yes if you don't use "&"
2010-02-14T17:58:00.000Z	progre55	aluex	oh I see, then I'll use &
2010-02-14T18:00:00.000Z	progre55	aluex	btw, is it just on & or two &&?
