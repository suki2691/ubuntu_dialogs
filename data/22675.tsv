2010-11-15T21:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	flone	 i dont think so.. but i have taken an app and sort of straddled both windows. then resized it to fill up both monitors. :)

2010-11-15T21:35:00.000Z	flone	Dr_Willis	thx. that was what i expected - seems i have to disable one screen before starting unreal tournament..
