2010-09-11T06:20:00.000Z	Rickmasta		Anyone mind telling me how I might add the admin usergroup?
2010-09-11T06:21:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Rickmasta	in a terminal type: sudo adduser username admin     ..substitute username with the user you want added
2010-09-11T06:21:00.000Z	Rickmasta	bastidrazor	It's saying the the admin group doesn't work.
2010-09-11T06:22:00.000Z	bastidrazor	Rickmasta	that isn't an actual error, can you be specific
