2010-11-19T06:42:00.000Z	Rogan_		Hi there, using command line cp, what option would I specify if I wanted to copy the _contents_ or a directory, not the directory and it's contents but just everything inside it? (If it's even possible, or if there is a better way to do that)
2010-11-19T06:43:00.000Z	jrib	Rogan_	use a glob
2010-11-19T06:44:00.000Z	Rogan_	jrib	Can you elaborate a little? Or should I practise using google
2010-11-19T06:45:00.000Z	jrib	Rogan_	foo/* is an example of globbing.  So is foo/.*  (for example)
