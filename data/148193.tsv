2007-06-17T09:04:00.000Z	m3thos	EnsignRedshirt_	80mb will do, it depends on the livetime of your install
2007-06-17T09:05:00.000Z	m3thos	EnsignRedshirt_	2 years of kernel upgrades will start to fill your /boot
2007-06-17T09:06:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt_	m3thos	Thanks... the computer on which I am currently installing Ubuntu has a 100Meg partition that was previously used as /boot.
