2011-08-13T10:15:00.000Z	rodhash		Hello guys.. Does anyone know how much graphical memory ubuntu need? I'm used to run lots of softwares, some took much system memory (ie notes + sametime)..
2011-08-13T10:16:00.000Z	Polah	rodhash	256-512MB as a minimum for decent operation I'd say

2011-08-13T10:20:00.000Z	rodhash	Polah	I'm facing some graphical issues mainly with firefox and lotus notes, they lost the color and some functions, sometime..
