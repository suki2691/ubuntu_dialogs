2011-09-12T10:06:00.000Z	bindi		in my country, you are allowed to make backups of what you have bought... you can even download them, as long as you own a physical copy
2011-09-12T10:07:00.000Z	mneptok	bindi	anything else on your mind while i'm opped?
2011-09-12T10:08:00.000Z	mneptok	bindi	thanks for that. an Ubuntu support channel is not the place for discussions of copying PS3 games.
