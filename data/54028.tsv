2009-12-09T16:19:00.000Z	crawler		any Xubuntu users who can help me set up a working VNC server?  i can connect, but get only a grey screen and X cursor.

2009-12-09T16:21:00.000Z	crawler	StaticPhilly	ok, i was playing around with the startup script for a bit, maybe i used the wrong command..
2009-12-09T16:33:00.000Z	crawler	StaticPhilly	looks like i was using a bum server (tightvncserver).  installed x11vnc and all is well :-)
