2008-10-25T02:39:00.000Z	mongolai	Fjss	 it will update it to the newest ubuntu release
2008-10-25T02:40:00.000Z	mongolai	Fjss	 I mean the update manager will update the kernel to the latest kernel that is in the ubuntu repositories, and unless you know differently, that's the one to get
2008-10-25T02:41:00.000Z	mongolai	Fjss	 that's the kernel I have -- 2.6.24-21
