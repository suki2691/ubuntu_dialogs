2006-11-29T12:51:00.000Z	LineOf7s	Vigor	 You couldn't, say, point me a lil more specifically in the right direction, could you?  'Users' seems a lil open-ended in the help I'm looking at...
2006-11-29T12:53:00.000Z	LineOf7s	Vigor	 Hrmm, okay.  Thanks.  I'm familiar with the System -> Administration -> Users & Groups section, but I'm clearly missing something.  I'll keep looking.
2006-11-29T12:55:00.000Z	LineOf7s	Vigor	 I know I could change the permissions of every file/folder I don't want them to touch - but I was hoping there was a 'group' already set up that had no permissions already (I guess).  Then I can just add the one or two apps I need.
2006-11-29T12:58:00.000Z	LineOf7s	Vigor	 Okay, I'm there.  I see the tab that says "Allow user to..." and I've got all of those deselected.  But I want to limit them further.  What part of this section deals with that?
