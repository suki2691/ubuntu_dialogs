2011-06-03T22:09:00.000Z	GatoLoko		can somebody tell me how/where to report that a package has been linked in launchpad to the wrong upstream?
2011-06-03T22:09:00.000Z	Pici	GatoLoko	You could mention it in #launchpad
2011-06-03T22:11:00.000Z	GatoLoko	Pici	i think it's more ubuntu related than launchpad related, but ill try, thanks
