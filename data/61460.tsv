2011-03-21T17:36:00.000Z	tsimpson		probably blkid
2011-03-21T17:36:00.000Z	Travis-42	tsimpson	blkid exists, but it's a different command and I'd like to be able to use the vol_id version
2011-03-21T17:37:00.000Z	Travis-42		ok thanks Pici
2011-03-21T17:38:00.000Z	tsimpson	Travis-42	vol_id just printed the UUID="..." part of what blkid prints anyway
