2012-11-05T18:17:00.000Z	Thor		How can I get bash_completion to work with ssh? It used to work, but now ubuntu uses hashed known_hosts file, so as far as I can see, bash_completion haven't been updated to work with the new known_hosts format

2012-11-05T18:20:00.000Z	Thor	theadmin	doesn't zsh have it's own completion thing similar to fish?
2012-11-05T18:20:00.000Z	theadmin	Thor	Nah, it depends on your configuration. I'm using oh-my-zsh, personally
