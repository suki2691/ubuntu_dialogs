2008-11-22T19:08:00.000Z	Lynx		Hey! Xorg crashed on my box, can't do anything anymore but logged in via ssh, how can I kill Xorg from ssh? kill [PID] does not work. It uses 100% CPU, too.
2008-11-22T19:08:00.000Z	ziroday	Lynx	did you try kill -9 <pid>
2008-11-22T19:09:00.000Z	Lynx	ziroday	just did, does not work
2008-11-22T19:09:00.000Z	Lynx	ziroday	ah wait, it has a new pid now...
