2008-08-23T02:55:00.000Z	nickrud	scrambledegg	get rid of windows, problem solved ;)
2008-08-23T02:59:00.000Z	nickrud	scrambledegg	I've been dual booting for years, never seen that. Can't imagine how it would even happen
2008-08-23T03:01:00.000Z	scrambledegg	nickrud	yes its really weird... first i thought it was a problem with grub, but i think its ubuntu causing trouble, caus it only happens after i've boot ubuntu
