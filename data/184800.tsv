2006-06-04T13:59:00.000Z	sambrista		Hi, i've enabled XGL on ubuntu dapper, but i had to set my desktop to 24bits. Is there any way to use it in 16bit mode?

2006-06-04T14:01:00.000Z	sambrista	Schalken	yes but if i do it xgl wont work properly
2006-06-04T14:01:00.000Z	Schalken	sambrista	oh i see. i dont know then. why do you need 16bit mode anyway?
