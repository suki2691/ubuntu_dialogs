2008-08-18T04:43:00.000Z	jacoblyles		Are the screens on the Lenovo Thinkpads matte or glossy? Do they work well with Ubuntu

2008-08-18T04:45:00.000Z	jacoblyles	Flannel	Thanks, I think I'm buying a Lenovo today. I spent days looking for a laptop that works with Ubuntu and has a matte screen. Things were simple before Dell went all-glossy.
