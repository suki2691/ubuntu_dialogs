2007-09-28T08:46:00.000Z	lavender_dream		Hello Ubuntu! New user here, completely made my switch a week ago from XP, just got bored with the OS and wanted to learn something new and was always curious about Linux... :) I have so many questions I don't even know where to start but I thought I'd say hello first.
