2006-06-07T10:15:00.000Z	jrattner2	nalioth	Is there any way that I can make all e-mail sent to an e-mail address on my server automatically print on a network printer or to fax it to a number?
2006-06-07T10:16:00.000Z	nalioth	jrattner2	there are gateways for that, but i'm ignorant of how they work
2006-06-07T10:16:00.000Z	jrattner2	nalioth	what do you mean by gateways?? I'm trying to use it as a method of documenting business e-mail on a server in paper back form
