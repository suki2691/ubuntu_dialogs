2010-11-08T23:13:00.000Z	NeedHelpBAD		I have an ASUS Apire One netbook and I had WinXP installed on it with Ubuntu dual boot. Yesterday I was trying to remove the recent documents on 10.10 Netbook and I was able to remove them from the Dekstop GUI but not the Netbook GUI so I then decided to Reinstall Ubuntu from a LiveUSB... Now I am not even able to access any of the operating systems...
2010-11-08T23:15:00.000Z	NeedHelpBAD		Seems like GRUB is damaged and I can't even access the Asus eRecovery to restore the computer to factory state..
