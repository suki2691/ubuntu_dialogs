2005-03-22T16:22:00.000Z	unperson		I wanted to show someone Ubuntu with one of the live CDs.  I have the old Warty live CD image, but is there a newer *stable* version?  I don't want anything bleeding edge, because a system that has major bugs makes a bad impression.  It looks like there's a hoary milestone Live CD out, but I really can't tell which, if any, is supposed to be stable and most recent.
