2009-02-20T12:26:00.000Z	syockit	stopie	it sometimes happen to me too. I had to start all over again when that happens
2009-02-20T12:27:00.000Z	stopie	syockit	would you recommend a mirror to use? the defualt us.ubuntu.... is hella slow
2009-02-20T12:29:00.000Z	syockit	stopie	uh, I use japan mirror because I'm in japan.... us.ubuntu will look for the optimal server for you, but you can set the mirror manually.
