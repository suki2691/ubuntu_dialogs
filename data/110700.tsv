2007-12-22T04:39:00.000Z	Stormx2	Ttech	Depends.
2007-12-22T04:39:00.000Z	Ttech	Stormx2	 Ah, care to elaborate?
2007-12-22T04:40:00.000Z	Stormx2	Ttech	heh, sorry. Extended partitions are needed if you have over a certain number of partitions, I can't remember the exact number. ie x primary partitions or (x-1) primary partitions and a logical. Where the swap partition resides won't matter though
