2008-05-03T20:28:00.000Z	Trizzle		Question:  I have just installed OSS and it is working fine based on running osstest.  I am attempting to play a file using totem movie player and I am unable to get sound and the file won't play at all.  I receive this error message whenever I try to open anything with totem:  "Failed to connect stream:  Invalid argument"  This has only happened since I installed OSS

2008-05-03T20:30:00.000Z	Trizzle	neo_	 I switched from alfa because it wasn't working with surround.  It would only play out of one speaker
2008-05-03T20:34:00.000Z	Trizzle	neo_	 I figured it out.  I'm a retard.  Thanks for the help.
