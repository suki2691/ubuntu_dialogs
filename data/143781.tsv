2007-03-26T09:34:00.000Z	dcordes	hanbush	same as iso
2007-03-26T09:35:00.000Z	hanbush	dcordes	i cant mount it, i know i can use wine with alcohol 120 or daemon tools, but id rather have something native
2007-03-26T09:35:00.000Z	dcordes	hanbush	for me, it works with mount -o loop -t iso9660 dunno what mdf you got there...
