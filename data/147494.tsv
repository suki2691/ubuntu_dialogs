2007-01-28T13:09:00.000Z	Vorondil		Hi all, I'm using ndiswrapper to use a linksys wmp11 v4 under ubuntu 6.10.  I can load the windows drivers into and ndiswrapper, load the ndiswrapper module, and get the system to recognize my card as wlan0.  However, when I try to set the ssid with `iwconfig wlan0 essid mynetwork`, I get, "Error for wireless request "Set ESSID" (8B1A) : SET failed on device wlan0 ; Invalid argument."
