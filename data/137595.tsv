2007-09-05T09:48:00.000Z	Malder	shad0w1e	hardware raid doesn't get configured through the OS - it's in hardware
2007-09-05T09:48:00.000Z	shad0w1e		I don't have a screen hooked up to my server, so doing it in BIOS will be a pain
2007-09-05T09:49:00.000Z	shad0w1e	Malder	i know it's usually done that way.... so there's no Linux app that can talk to your hardware?
