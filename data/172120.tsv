2008-05-04T21:15:00.000Z	tuna		I'm seeing a weird problem. (if it is a problem). My computer reports the total amount of memory to be 1004 mb, not the full gb it has reported previosly.  Is this a some change in how kernel memory is reported in the newer kernels, have I been rootkitted or is some of my memory failing?
2008-05-04T21:15:00.000Z	tuna		or, how do i see all the memory my kernel sees?
2008-05-04T21:16:00.000Z	stbain	tuna	type "free" on the command line?
2008-05-04T21:16:00.000Z	tuna	stbain	that reports the 1004 mb
