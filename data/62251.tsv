2011-11-04T20:14:00.000Z	bios`		hi I am looking for a tool which allows me to make anotations in pdfs (xournal is a way to limited since you can only write text on the white boarders and okular does not allow me to send the anotatins to friends who are not using okuklar as well)
2011-11-04T20:15:00.000Z	iceroot	bios`	cant "acroread" do that?
2011-11-04T20:15:00.000Z	iceroot	bios`	or was it only this "adobe reader pro" thing?
2011-11-04T20:15:00.000Z	iceroot	bios`	ah ok
