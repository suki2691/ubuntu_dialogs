2008-12-15T22:48:00.000Z	earthmeLon		Hello everybody!!!  I am having two problems:  One is that Pidgin windows wont flash when I get a new msg, and IRSSI is not beeping/flashing on hilites.  The only thing IRSSI does is make the color of the nick of the person that hilites me different.  Any suggestions?
