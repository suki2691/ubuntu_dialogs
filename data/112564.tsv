2008-01-10T10:35:00.000Z	theLichKing	dogson	don't you think pulseaudio conflicts with alsa, because they are both control sound before it goes to the hardware
2008-01-10T10:36:00.000Z	dogson	theLichKing	pulseaudio has output plugins for alsa etc , i havent tryed it myself, but with some thinkering it should work
2008-01-10T10:36:00.000Z	theLichKing	dogson	i see, i'll look more into it, thanks
