2006-10-30T07:29:00.000Z	AE_Wu		Can anyone help with my problem.  I have installed the os and I'm trying to figure out how to install ilife 06.  When I open the os it doesn't show the cd when I have it in the drive nor do I know how to copy the iso file ot the fack hdd?  Can someone tell me how to make this happen?

2006-10-30T07:31:00.000Z	Likwidoxigen	AE_Wu	iLife is designed to run on a mac, not on linux, it's not made for the linux operating system...
