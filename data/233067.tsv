2009-10-21T01:49:00.000Z	arikr		Hello everyone! Got this problem: Jaunty on laptop (HP 6735b with 140 Gb hd) root partition gets filled up after a while. Tried reinstalling, tripled size of root partition. Same problem...
2009-10-21T01:50:00.000Z	arikr		My partition is now 10 Gb. What can be causing this? apt problem?

2009-10-21T01:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	arikr	find the root couse of that
