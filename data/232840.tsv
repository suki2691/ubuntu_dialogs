2010-09-13T22:54:00.000Z	_BLAZE_		Anyone know why this would be the case?  I installed the sugar desktop for testing and after I did, whenever I left click, it drags instead of left clicks.  It shows the hand icon instead of the arrow when I left click on something.  I need to hold CTRL in order to actually perform a left click.  It sounds insignificant, but it can become a real pain pretty fast.  Any Assistance is appreciated.  Thank You in advance.
