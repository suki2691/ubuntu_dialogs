2009-01-28T03:00:00.000Z	Louis		any thoughts?
2009-01-28T03:00:00.000Z	phorensic1	Louis	just a thought but have you look at the permissions of the pics?
2009-01-28T03:01:00.000Z	Louis	phorensic1	 let me check that now.
2009-01-28T03:03:00.000Z	Louis	phorensic1	 my user owns the photos, and the photo directory allows the group (of which my user is a member ) both read and write access... so that seems to be okay
