2009-07-13T03:07:00.000Z	GiJ		Hey guys, I was wondering what the fastest Ubuntu based distro is
2009-07-13T03:08:00.000Z	Ademan	GiJ	like kevdog said, crunchbang is designed for speed, whether or not it's actually the fastest, i have no idea
2009-07-13T03:10:00.000Z	Ademan	GiJ	i don't believe so, and they haven't released a 9.04 version if i remember correctly
2009-07-13T03:13:00.000Z	Ademan	GiJ	i second that, openbox would be faster.  HOWEVER, xfce is plenty fast, unless you're on a 386....
