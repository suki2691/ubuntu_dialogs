2009-11-24T02:55:00.000Z	glen_		Hi, I have increased the size of my ubuntu partition (the main ext5 linux partition) with gparted. Even though the partition has increased, ubuntu still sees the partition as being the old size. Is there something else I need to do before ububtu can use the space? Thanks
