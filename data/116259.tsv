2009-01-25T22:50:00.000Z	ScottWegner		is there a media client for Linux which can seek back and fourth in real media (.rm) streams?  The RealPlayer client on Windows can, but it doesn't seem possible for RealPlayer on Linux..
2009-01-25T22:50:00.000Z	jrib	ScottWegner	have you tried mplayer?
2009-01-25T22:51:00.000Z	jrib	ScottWegner	mplayer includes the frontend
