2009-10-02T20:11:00.000Z	saturnin1		Oh well... for those of you who gave it a shot thanks for thinking about the font killing my mozilla aps problem.  i guess Linux just isn't ready for non system administrators to use.  It was an interesting experiment though.
2009-10-02T20:12:00.000Z	saturnin1		Before I give up completely and reinstall XP, does anyone have any suggestion where else I might find help with this problem?
