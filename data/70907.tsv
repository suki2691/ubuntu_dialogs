2008-12-22T16:01:00.000Z	mnielson		I remember being able to resize directly from the installer before, not so now?
2008-12-22T16:02:00.000Z	rww	mnielson	the "7" and "8" in recent version numbers refer to their year of release. There are two different versions of Ubuntu with each number: 7.04, 7.10, 8.04, 8.10. And you should still be able to resize from the installer: i did it the other day =/
