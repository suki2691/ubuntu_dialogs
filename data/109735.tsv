2007-12-12T17:53:00.000Z	self		Q: How can I have a bash script to run a program in the background ever 5 min, kinda like a loop, and to run that program with a unique parameter each time.  I want to download a stream to a unique filename, then pass that filename to another program, then repeat every 5 min.
