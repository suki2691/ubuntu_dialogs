2012-10-19T08:08:00.000Z	obtrusivemouse		meh, i kinda wished to see at least fedora or debian take the same path, without much community involvement, not much development either

2012-10-19T08:10:00.000Z	obtrusivemouse	ActionParsnip	yeah but it seems that the only reason why ubuntu is going forward is because the devs are now taking it as a fulltime job and it's paid with all those donations, shops, advertising
