2010-08-31T15:20:00.000Z	xeviox	mickster04	ok, but why the hell are there people that upload content to the usenet for free, where they have to pay to be able to download it ?!?
2010-08-31T15:21:00.000Z	mickster04	xeviox	because people have to pay for servers somehow? it's a minimal fee for making sure you wont get tracked?
2010-08-31T15:22:00.000Z	xeviox	mickster04	so I put my time in a work for which I have to pay and others make big money with it???
