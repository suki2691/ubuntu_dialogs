2009-10-26T19:58:00.000Z	martin_henry		I'm having some trouble burning a data DVD with my compaq laptop's internal burner in 9.04. I have tried GnomeBaker and Brasero. any ideas?
2009-10-26T19:59:00.000Z	schnetf	martin_henry	if you don't mind installing kdelibs try out k3b - it works very well for me
2009-10-26T20:02:00.000Z	schnetf	martin_henry	i think it will suit your needs ;)
2009-10-26T20:05:00.000Z	martin_henry	schnetf	just opened K3b and started the burn...looks like it's started correctly so far: write speed and 2% progress :) thanks again
