2005-10-07T09:09:00.000Z	dean		I was following http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=3713 step#2 - 1. sudo apt-get install linux-686 if you haven't already.
2005-10-07T09:09:00.000Z	dean		or -k7 or -686-smp or -386... whatever matches your kernel.=== I chose 686 when I should've done 386, now my nic won't work... can anyone help?
