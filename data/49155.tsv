2009-10-30T03:08:00.000Z	xtsuname		is it a better idea to reinstall ubuntu to 9.10 or to upgrade?
2009-10-30T03:09:00.000Z	xtsuname		it's taking more than 3hrs to upgrade it
2009-10-30T03:09:00.000Z	hajmola	xtsuname	that's because the servers are getting hammered right now
2009-10-30T03:09:00.000Z	xtsuname	hajmola	ah, that makes sense
