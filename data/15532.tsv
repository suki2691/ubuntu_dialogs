2011-08-06T07:28:00.000Z	justdave		is that still in there?
2011-08-06T07:29:00.000Z	escott	justdave	these days xorg.conf can usually be removed. nvidia drivers are the only main reason to have one
2011-08-06T07:29:00.000Z	justdave	escott	that's what I just explained: I don't have one and it doesn't work.  I'm using a composite output, and it can't detect that apparently
