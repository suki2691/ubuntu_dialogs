2011-09-07T04:01:00.000Z	maletapfc		I have sound card integrated on motherboard.  My jack where sound goes out is dead so i have to use another jack for sending sound on speakers. This works fine with realtek HD settings in  Windows 7, but i don't know how to fix that in ubuntu...any idea?

2011-09-07T04:08:00.000Z	maletapfc	usr13	cannot figure out how to declare that specific jack is for sound out...any suggestion except alsa mixer?
