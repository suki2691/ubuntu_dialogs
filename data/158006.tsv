2008-08-14T16:16:00.000Z	chronographer		Hi all. I am looking at getting a new computer, I wonder if anyone has experience with new graphics cards. AIT 4xxx or nvidia 200 series? which has best support? dual monitors, tv-out etc...
2008-08-14T16:17:00.000Z	Slart	chronographer	nvidia has had some problems lately.. check their linux forums.. ati/amd is getting better and with their new policy when it comes to open source I think they will be the choice for linux soon
2008-08-14T16:18:00.000Z	Slart	chronographer	but right now.. I'm not sure.. I'm just happy my computer works without problems..
2008-08-14T16:20:00.000Z	Slart	chronographer	before you run off buying a brand new nvidia card.. check out the nvidia linux forums.. I have a nvidia card myself which is working nicely but there seems to be many people out there with problems
