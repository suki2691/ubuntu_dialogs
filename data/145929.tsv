2007-02-19T16:28:00.000Z	Aggrav8d		hello, all.
2007-02-19T16:29:00.000Z	Aggrav8d		I have an old mandriva box that has a lot of backup data on it.  I'd like to replace mandriva with ubuntu but I don't want to lose any of the data.  I'm trying to find the best way to copy data off the box.  suggestions?
2007-02-19T16:29:00.000Z	Aggrav8d		I've tried to ssh and ftp to the box and, though I can connect, it seems to be running terribly slow.
2007-02-19T16:29:00.000Z	Quintin_	Aggrav8d	I suggest you use 5.25" floppies.
