2011-02-15T04:54:00.000Z	Gnea	magicianlord	because dbus absolutely refuses to work right. I had to generate a /var/lib/dbus/machine-id using dbug-uuidgen just to get it to start up, but when it goes through the pre-script execution, it triggers something with the kernel and panics, hard. can't even sysrq-b out of it.
2011-02-15T04:55:00.000Z	magicianlord	Gnea	i dont understand what that means
2011-02-15T04:55:00.000Z	Gnea	magicianlord	it's technical babble
