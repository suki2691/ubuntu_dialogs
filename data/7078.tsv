2011-12-15T21:27:00.000Z	Scrivnr		How can I customize the Unity launcher such that an icon appearing in it, when clicked, will run a custom command? Currently I have something running just as unpackaged source, and the launcher actually doesn't seem to launch it when I do "keep in launcher" and try to start it later. I figure if I can just give it a custom command to run the executable, it'll work.
