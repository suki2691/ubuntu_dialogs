2006-02-24T14:07:00.000Z	intelikey	Fub	turn off the onboard in the bios
2006-02-24T14:07:00.000Z	Fub	intelikey	good idea, I was actually considering if I could remove the module
2006-02-24T14:08:00.000Z	intelikey	Fub	you can..... the guys in here will gripe at you for doing it that way.... but hey it's your box and your linux.....
