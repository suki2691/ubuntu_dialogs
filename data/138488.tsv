2007-04-22T12:35:00.000Z	CarlFK		how do I disable network-manager?  I am trying to do some nifty networking things (bridge wired and wifi) and i think NM keeps helping (as in, messing it up)
2007-04-22T12:36:00.000Z	magnetron	CarlFK	think so, probably
2007-04-22T12:36:00.000Z	magnetron	CarlFK	right click it, you will see a menu etc
2007-04-22T12:36:00.000Z	CarlFK	magnetron	does that persists when I reboot?
