2010-10-08T14:09:00.000Z	mengbiping		hey, can anyone help me, how can i determine in a bash script whether an existing binary was compiled in release or debug mode?
2010-10-08T14:10:00.000Z	tarzeau	mengbiping	try to strip it or use file?
2010-10-08T14:12:00.000Z	mengbiping	tarzeau	is there some cases in which there's debug info in a optimized mode compiled binary?
2010-10-08T14:15:00.000Z	mengbiping	tarzeau	i want to know if the binary has been compiled with -O options on
