2008-06-01T01:37:00.000Z	JonDeere		Can anyone help me with my Nvidia 3D driver install?
2008-06-01T01:39:00.000Z	JonDeere		I've been reading up on it, Icqnumber, and I have a theory on the problem... But I can't even edit xorg.conf successfully, must be I need root?
2008-06-01T01:39:00.000Z	JonDeere		Can I do it from Sudo? Or do I need to learn how to log on as root?
2008-06-01T01:39:00.000Z	Starnestommy	JonDeere	sudo should work
