2005-03-18T15:22:00.000Z	jesuel		I must be missing something here. Amd64 system, new hoary install, trying to install the fglrx drivers. The system shows that fglrx loads in dmesg, But when I specify for x.org to use the fglrx driver. The system hardlocks up and i have to power it off and reboot it.
2005-03-18T15:23:00.000Z	Karlosis	jesuel	do they already do amd64 at ATI?
2005-03-18T15:24:00.000Z	jesuel	Karlosis	doesnt say they do, but there is suppsosed to be support in amd64 hoary for ati's fglrx driver
2005-03-18T15:28:00.000Z	Karlosis	jesuel	which package is it?
