I'm having trouble with the open source driver (radeon) and fglrx. In case of radeon, the video play isn't of the right color, in case of fglrx is doesn't display the video at all ...

2010-06-02T02:30:00.000Z	ikus060	oldtopman	: sure, I did. I manage to install both of them. It's not a matter of getting them working. My question is about the video playback of the driver. Both of them doesn't seams to work. So I'm wondering which one should actually work.
