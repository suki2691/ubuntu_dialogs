2007-09-13T14:41:00.000Z	Flannel	weka	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop, will install the ubuntu desktop.  xserver-xorg is the x server itself though
2007-09-13T14:42:00.000Z	weka	Flannel	i have the xserver-xorg-core ... but just want X then say twm ... gotta keep this small
2007-09-13T14:43:00.000Z	Flannel	weka	ah, then yeah, install xorg then install twm, and you'll be fine
