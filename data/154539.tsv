2007-08-15T08:32:00.000Z	sSiroSoriSs		i have a question reguarding virtual machines........ will windows detect my winsoft modem in a virtual machine while linux hosts the virtual machine? (linux doesn't support the winmodem)
2007-08-15T08:32:00.000Z	scorp123	sSiroSoriSs	I don't think so
2007-08-15T08:33:00.000Z	scorp123	sSiroSoriSs	but most VM software such as VMware or VirtualBox are able to assign USB devices to a virtual OS .. so if you had an USB modem, that would work
