2010-01-03T10:24:00.000Z	dbum_		I recently mounted a filesystem 9.10 using a Live CD, Ubuntu 9.04 and was able to access my old files on /home by changing the permissions without giving a password. Isn't that a security flaw?

2010-01-03T10:25:00.000Z	faileas	dbum_	 you ALWAYS have the option of encrypted /home folders if you're worried about that
2010-01-03T10:26:00.000Z	dbum_	faileas	ok, thx
