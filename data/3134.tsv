2012-07-31T03:05:00.000Z	BarkingFish	rax-	yes it probably is. Depends on what kernel you're running now - you can find out from a terminal by typing  uname -r
2012-07-31T03:06:00.000Z	rax-	BarkingFish	Yea, I'm on 3.2.0-26 atm but haven't restarted since before the update to 3.2.0-25 or 3.2.0- 26
2012-07-31T03:07:00.000Z	BarkingFish	rax-	then yes it definitely will be an update.  Depending on which sources you have enabled, some users are currently going up to 3.2.0-29-generic, which I think is a testing kernel
