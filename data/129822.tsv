2007-09-22T11:37:00.000Z	winbond		which distro is better slax or slackware?
2007-09-22T11:37:00.000Z	Strangelv	winbond	I would assume that full slackware would be better as an installed OS as slax is a liveCD setup
2007-09-22T11:38:00.000Z	winbond	Strangelv	ahh, ty
2007-09-22T11:39:00.000Z	Strangelv	winbond	if someone was a slackware guru they probabyl wouldn't be hanging out in here unles they've dumped it or similar
