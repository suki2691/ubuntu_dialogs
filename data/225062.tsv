2006-05-17T13:47:00.000Z	jeff303		how can I mount one of my ntfs partitions (read only of course) such that ordinary users have read access?  basically I don't want to have to "sudo totem" just to play my music from that partition
2006-05-17T13:48:00.000Z	jeff303		I try to chmod it after mounting, but it can't "read only filesystem"
