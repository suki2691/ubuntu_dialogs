2011-03-20T08:01:00.000Z	dogarrhea		this seems like a really dumb design decision
2011-03-20T08:03:00.000Z	dogarrhea		it just bugs the heck out of me.. when i type some new command and it asks me for password and it just errors after making me type my password anyways
2011-03-20T08:04:00.000Z	jrib	dogarrhea	write a wrapper for sudo then :)
