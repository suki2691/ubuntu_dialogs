2011-02-15T12:05:00.000Z	Diverdude		Lets say i have installed  a program A on ubuntu using apt-get. The packet manager finds out there is an update to the program that takes up for example 54MB. Does the update then take 54MB more from the harddisk besides what program A already fills up on the harddisk or are some parts of the program removed first so that the 54MB is just replacing some parts of the old program or what actually happens?

2011-02-15T12:07:00.000Z	Diverdude	juk	its just because sometimes the updates are like huge.....one day i think im gonna run out of harddisk space
