2006-07-07T09:04:00.000Z	FlimFlamMan	atrophic	 my recollection of bluefish is that it was buggy - i lost data with it once.  but that was months ago - maybe it's gotten better...
2006-07-07T09:41:00.000Z	FlimFlamMan	atrophic	 bluefish is looking pretty nice these days
2006-07-07T09:42:00.000Z	atrophic	FlimFlamMan	yeah, I've liked it in my use so far. It works for what you wanted then?
