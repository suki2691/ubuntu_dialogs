2008-01-17T10:37:00.000Z	zcat[1]	[deXter]	no, unfortunately it can't due to various laws and restrictions
2008-01-17T10:38:00.000Z	zcat[1]	[deXter]	if you enable the medibuntu repository, and apt-get install libdvdcss2 ubuntu-restricted-extras, you will get pretty much all of that installed for you though
2008-01-17T10:39:00.000Z	zcat[1]	[deXter]	I would point out that windows also cannot play flash, many media formats, or dvd's without adding additional software..
