2008-01-02T01:17:00.000Z	nemik		so i've hosed my system COMPLETELY. is there any way to re-install gutsy without ruining my /home ?
2008-01-02T01:19:00.000Z	nemik		well, it'll give me a reason to encrypt FS then

2008-01-02T01:21:00.000Z	nemik	pyr3	yea. well i mean i can boot to normal too. so i'll do it from there. X is just messed up up along with wireless
