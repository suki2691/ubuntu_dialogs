2007-07-07T07:51:00.000Z	Dezine		For some reason Ubuntu isn't letting me get online, it recognizes the ethernet card but won't connect. Also after it logs in I get the error "Hall failed to start" and I'm not sure if that is related to my internet issue
2007-07-07T07:52:00.000Z	Dezine		Also, I've been online before and all of a sudden I can't.
2007-07-07T07:52:00.000Z	Dezine		sorry, Hal not hall
