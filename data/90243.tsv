2008-06-01T02:10:00.000Z	jrib	mainstreet	not sure what you mean by "linux-only files" but, yes, probably
2008-06-01T02:10:00.000Z	mainstreet	jrib	Like anope... you can't run it on windows...
2008-06-01T02:11:00.000Z	jrib	mainstreet	I have no idea what anope is, but if it's just a program that runs on linux, then yes, you can run it
