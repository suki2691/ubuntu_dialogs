2006-12-29T17:42:00.000Z	Yakaty		I've got an annoying problem here.. I installed Ubuntu Edgy on a laptop a while back so it dual booted with windows - everything went fine and worked perfectly so I decided to wipe the lot off there and just stick ubuntu on.. I couldnt find the ubuntu cd so i donwloaded a new one and now when I try booting up with it it gets to the first logo loading screen and then dumps me to busybox
2006-12-29T17:44:00.000Z	Yakaty		I've checked the cd and its ok and when I do a "ls /dev/hd*" my cdrom isn't showing up in there just hda :(
