2006-08-12T09:22:00.000Z	Sir_Brizz	dougsko	because it does. Can't even run Google Earth properly in OpenGL and that is simple by Linux standards
2006-08-12T09:23:00.000Z	dougsko	Sir_Brizz	hmm...i think i have a 910, but i dont really do anything that needs sweet graphics, so i guess i never noticed
2006-08-12T09:24:00.000Z	Sir_Brizz	dougsko	makes sense :) It even crashes on PPRacer alot of times
