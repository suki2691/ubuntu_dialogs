2005-12-18T15:45:00.000Z	redguy|work	pldn	how about editing ~/.basrc and/or ~/.bash_profile ?
2005-12-18T15:45:00.000Z	pldn	redguy|work	hrmm, i think i should rephrase. It seems that on a default ubuntu install, the default ordering in an ls doesnt sort by directories, which is driving me nuts :)
2005-12-18T15:47:00.000Z	redguy|work	pldn	hmmmm, not sure that this can be done without aliases... and yes, I don't know anything about ycsh
