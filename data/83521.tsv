2011-06-25T02:05:00.000Z	chrome_	Dulak	some icons are not showing in my ubuntu. Like the Konsole one. Why?
2011-06-25T02:07:00.000Z	Dulak	chrome_	I have no idea, but I don't use kde, if it's like gnome there is a way to force it to recreate the icon cache it uses, though no idea how to do that for kde
2011-06-25T02:07:00.000Z	chrome_	Dulak	I'm using unity
2011-06-25T02:08:00.000Z	Dulak	chrome_	konsole is a kde app, so I'm gonna guess there is something causing kde icons not to show?
