2008-07-07T06:11:00.000Z	physicistjedi		I am developing a free software, it currently compiles and runs on Ubuntu. How can I turn that into a repository package? Is there a tutorial somewhere?
2008-07-07T06:11:00.000Z	rgsteele||home	physicistjedi	An official package?  Or just one in a local repo?
2008-07-07T06:12:00.000Z	physicistjedi	rgsteele||home	Goal is to make it official eventually
