2011-09-24T04:30:00.000Z	Moonstar		Hello To All, just wondering if there is an app to format dvd's, I am using ubuntu 11.04.
2011-09-24T04:30:00.000Z	angel56	Moonstar	you don't format dvd's
2011-09-24T04:32:00.000Z	Moonstar	angel56	thanks for the reply, even if the dvd is a r/w ?
2011-09-24T04:32:00.000Z	angel56	Moonstar	are you talking about trying to use it as a hard drive?
