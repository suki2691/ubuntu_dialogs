2010-05-04T07:54:00.000Z	lee_		Hello. I need help getting my cd/dvd drive to work.  Any one want to help me?
2010-05-04T07:55:00.000Z	ade2_	lee_	: why not give us some details?  What cd drive, and what is going wrong?
2010-05-04T07:57:00.000Z	ade2_	lee_	has the drive worked at all?  that is, was it working earlier, and it failed now?
2010-05-04T07:59:00.000Z	ade2_	lee_	could it be a permissions thing?  Are you in group cdrom?
