2005-02-21T12:41:00.000Z	Houligan		I have a question.  Im new to Linux, I want to install Ubuntu onto a partition I made, but when the installation asks for which storage system to use, the NTFS that is defaulted for windows is not available, Which should I choose
2005-02-21T12:42:00.000Z	BiteMeBill	Houligan	is it only showing hda1?
2005-02-21T12:43:00.000Z	BiteMeBill	Houligan	So it should show hda1 and hda2
2005-02-21T12:45:00.000Z	BiteMeBill	Houligan	after you get it installed check out the guide to set it up so you can see your windows files, http://ubuntuguide.org/
