2007-06-16T05:32:00.000Z	johso		hiya. I'm experiencing a weird problem: my disk space keeps getting filled up. I noticed that I had only a couple of mb free space on my Ubuntu partition, and started to delete stuff. when I was finished, the disk was full. rebooted, and now I can't log in, because the disk is full. everytime I delete stuff, it's replaced by.. something.
2007-06-16T05:32:00.000Z	corhere	johso	did you remember to empty the trash?
2007-06-16T05:33:00.000Z	johso	corhere	actually, I did not - but the weird thing is that the something keeps taking up more and more disk space
2007-06-16T05:37:00.000Z	johso	corhere	thanks for the tip, it worked. weird though, I used rm to delete the stuff, so I have no idea why the trash was full.
