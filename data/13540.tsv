2011-06-06T21:05:00.000Z	theadmin	ranilynn	Yes, if you have over 4GB of RAM and don't wish to use a PAE-enabled kernel.
2011-06-06T21:06:00.000Z	ranilynn	theadmin	i'm not really too sure what that means i know when i ran 64 bit with windows it made a 32 bit folder (i'm not really sure why) but i'm planning on taking windows off completely
2011-06-06T21:07:00.000Z	theadmin	ranilynn	Well, as I say, it only ever has a point if you run on a system with more than 4 gigs of RAM
