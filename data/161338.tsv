2007-11-17T10:07:00.000Z	davef	Lgndryhr	just reformat, and do a fresh install
2007-11-17T10:07:00.000Z	davef	Lgndryhr	backup your data, and do a fresh install over your current linux partition
2007-11-17T10:08:00.000Z	davef	Lgndryhr	its easier to do a fresh install then bother with upgrade problems
