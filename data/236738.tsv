2006-03-27T13:04:00.000Z	_michael_		but i can't shrink the partition i'm using, can I?
2006-03-27T13:06:00.000Z	_michael_		ok, boot to live cd, using gparted to resize current to smaller size, throw windows on the new partition, and use https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows to recover my grub?
