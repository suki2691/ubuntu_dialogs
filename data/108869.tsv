2009-03-01T15:59:00.000Z	AndroidData		hi. I've been running Ubuntu Server Edition on a spare computer to run as a server. It was hosting my websites fine and dandy until a couple of hours ago, when the machine overheated or something and broke down. Since then, I've moved the harddrive over to another machine which I intend to use to continue serving websites with.
2009-03-01T15:59:00.000Z	AndroidData		The problem I'm having is that the network card is not being detected properly, and as such there is no network connection. lspci shows the network card in the list (Realtek RTL-8110SC/8169SC) but ifconfig does not show the card.
2009-03-01T15:59:00.000Z	AndroidData		What would be the easiest way to get my network card back up and running? I should still have the original Ubuntu CD, so the drivers should eb on there. Is there a command I can run that will automatically install it for me if I put the CD in?
