2012-01-03T13:42:00.000Z	slikts		I wish it was possible not to autogroup unity icons for the same app
2012-01-03T13:42:00.000Z	slikts		and to have the Unity dock horizontal
2012-01-03T13:42:00.000Z	A_J|win	slikts	i wish for the second thing too
2012-01-03T13:43:00.000Z	slikts	A_J|win	the first thing makes it hard to use the icons, there's an additional step to select anything
