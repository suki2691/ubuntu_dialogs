2007-10-23T20:08:00.000Z	pike_	Life_bird	oh. try this 1) sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  2) select vesa driver and hit enter or select default for everything else  3) sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart   might work. ive noticed some problems with the new failsafe in x i think its almost more trouble than its worth right now
