2006-10-02T14:50:00.000Z	trm		Hi everyone, can anyone tell me if there is a way to install ubuntu without going into the live ubunut screen as I am having problems doing it that way.
2006-10-02T14:50:00.000Z	enyc	trm	yes.. you use the 'alternate' cd
2006-10-02T14:50:00.000Z	enyc	trm	there are some known problems with the "live" installer ('desktop' cd)
2006-10-02T14:51:00.000Z	enyc	trm	also note... the 6.06.1 "point release" cds have some known installer problems fixed that were present in 6.06 original cds
