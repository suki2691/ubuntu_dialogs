2010-02-03T22:02:00.000Z	biri		got a dependency problem. Trying to install libjack-dev but it depends on libjack0 0.116v, and i've got 0.118v installed
2010-02-03T22:02:00.000Z	biri		what does that mean? do i have to try finding a libjack-dev package which depends on 0.118 version?
2010-02-03T22:03:00.000Z	sayanriju	biri	try a sudo apt-get update before trying to install
2010-02-03T22:04:00.000Z	biri	sayanriju	tx 4 the tip, but i tried already :)
