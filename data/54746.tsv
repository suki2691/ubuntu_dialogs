2010-05-21T20:00:00.000Z	Monotoko	edbian_	your leaving yourself open to middleman attack
2010-05-21T20:03:00.000Z	edbian_	Monotoko	hidden SSID is a good idea but the reason I have my network open is for the convience of my parents.  They want it to be stupid simple!
2010-05-21T20:05:00.000Z	Monotoko	edbian_	why dont you make there connections auto-connect??
