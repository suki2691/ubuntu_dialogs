2007-12-15T05:19:00.000Z	macogw	askand	probably display:0
2007-12-15T05:19:00.000Z	askand	macogw	im being told that the display:0 command cant be found
2007-12-15T05:20:00.000Z	macogw	askand	i dont know the command.  i just know 0 is default display so unless someone logged in before you, itll be 0
