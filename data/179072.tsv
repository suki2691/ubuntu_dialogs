2006-07-28T05:27:00.000Z	blaamann		I can find a package with 'apt-file search packageName', but when i try to install it with 'apt-get install packageName' it says it does not exist. What is wrong ?
2006-07-28T05:28:00.000Z	jrib	blaamann	maybe apt-get and apt-file were updated at different times and there were changes in the mean time.  What package?
2006-07-28T05:29:00.000Z	blaamann	jrib	I've updated them both. It is the dvdrip package
2006-07-28T05:29:00.000Z	jrib	blaamann	pastebin your sources.list please
