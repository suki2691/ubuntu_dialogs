2007-10-03T06:03:00.000Z	redguy_work		Hi, I want to change the default firefox settings (the home page, some bookmarks) for all new users. Is /usr/share/firefox the right place to do it? Won't a firefox upgrade overwrite my changes in there?
2007-10-03T06:04:00.000Z	redguy_work		or should I create a default profile in /etc/skel ?
2007-10-03T06:05:00.000Z	redguy_work		AFAIR there's a --force-all option to dpkg...
