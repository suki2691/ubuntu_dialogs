2009-02-11T04:33:00.000Z	Wizzup		Ok so basically, my Ubuntu installer says it is resizing my partition, but it has been at 0% for 15 minutes now, and the CD isn't actively spinning either.
2009-02-11T04:33:00.000Z	Wizzup		(Would it at some point be an idea to kill the install / partitioner?)
2009-02-11T04:33:00.000Z	pike__	Wizzup	it can sometimes help to do a defrag etc in windows first ive heard (never resized myself)
2009-02-11T04:34:00.000Z	Wizzup	pike__	It is indeed ntfs, although it's not fragged alot I think
