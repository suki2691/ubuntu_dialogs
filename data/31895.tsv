2010-05-15T02:12:00.000Z	dominicdinada	dotnetted03	have you tried to manually write the wpa_supplicant.conf file
2010-05-15T02:14:00.000Z	dotnetted03	dominicdinada	not yet - but the wpa settings were working in /etc/network/interfaces before upgrading to 10.04 (as wpa-*)
2010-05-15T02:15:00.000Z	dotnetted03	dominicdinada	daemon.log shows wpa_supplicant trying to set the SSID (as what I have specified) but the association request fails
2010-05-15T02:17:00.000Z	dominicdinada	dotnetted03	is your router using wpa encryption also ?
