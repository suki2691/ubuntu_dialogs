I have a Wireless Network between my windows pc, my winlaptop and ubuntu. this is working fine however I cannot get the internet (dialup) to work at the same time as the wireless network. I have to disable the WLAN to go anywhere on the interent, any sugestions? and what is the best dvd player for ubuntu?
