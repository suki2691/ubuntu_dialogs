2011-05-25T07:51:00.000Z	JohnTeddy		So Lenovo keyboards are crippled, the Fn key is where the Control key should be. I can't change 15 years of habit.... how can I change my Fn key to be a control key also?
2011-05-25T07:53:00.000Z	JohnTeddy		damn, this is so silly. Why did they put the Fn key there.
2011-05-25T07:53:00.000Z	JohnTeddy		I hate laptop keyboards
