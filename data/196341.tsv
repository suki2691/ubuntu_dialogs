2006-05-28T10:28:00.000Z	NoelJB	lewix	depends.  type of wireless?  wireless latency is far higher than wired, so often file transfer protocols take a serious hit.
2006-05-28T10:29:00.000Z	lewix	NoelJB	I don't know the type of wireless
2006-05-28T10:30:00.000Z	lewix	NoelJB	And I still don't get why files transfer protocols in windows dont take a serious hit
