2009-01-12T14:40:00.000Z	zuberot		why I'm getting this: E: Package pidgin-msn-pecan has no installation candidate
2009-01-12T14:41:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	zuberot	because it's not in the repositories
2009-01-12T14:41:00.000Z	zuberot	SlimeyPete	solution ?
2009-01-12T14:42:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	zuberot	there's a package called "msn-pecan". Maybe that's what you want?
