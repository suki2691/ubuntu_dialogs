2007-08-28T07:19:00.000Z	Anon	genii	Yeah, I used to be a Kanotix user. But couldn't you just take Kanotix's kernel, which is downloadable on their website, and then model ubuntu around it?
2007-08-28T07:22:00.000Z	genii	Anon	You would need to ask someone who is more involved in the development end of the Ubuntu system to know if it was possible or what the plan is for driver/kernel support.
