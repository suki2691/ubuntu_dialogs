2007-07-23T07:49:00.000Z	GamingX		Hey Guys, I download some files in Ubuntu and I have dual partition with NTFS file system, I wanted to copy these files in the NTFS partition so I can access them from windows.Any Ideas?
2007-07-23T07:49:00.000Z	pi3	GamingX	you can have a shared partition between ubuntu and windows
2007-07-23T07:50:00.000Z	pi3	GamingX	the partition should be ntfs or fat32
2007-07-23T07:51:00.000Z	pi3	GamingX	you can write-read ntfs with ubuntu out of the box right?
