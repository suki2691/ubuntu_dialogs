2005-09-16T05:29:00.000Z	tga	mindframe	one crude way to go around it would be to look in /proc/acpi/battery/
2005-09-16T05:30:00.000Z	mindframe	tga	so it wont work in flux?
2005-09-16T05:31:00.000Z	tga	mindframe	I don't know any specific app that will work in flux but take a look at apt-cache search battery
