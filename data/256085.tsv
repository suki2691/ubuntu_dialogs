2012-09-20T01:52:00.000Z	jilebedev		Hello: `parted -l` lists my hard drive as /dev/sdb and its filesystem type as ext2. When I try to `sudo mount /dev/sdb /media/foobar` I get a "wrong file system type" error?
2012-09-20T01:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	jilebedev	you sure its /dev/sdb and not /dev/sdb1 or some other # ?
