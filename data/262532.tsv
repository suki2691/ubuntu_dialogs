2004-12-19T12:41:00.000Z	RomPres		I'm trying to use Synaptci (Warty) to remove postfix.  But it says that if I do THAT, it's going to remove ubuntu-base and ubuntu-desktop too!!
2004-12-19T12:41:00.000Z	RomPres		Why?
2004-12-19T12:41:00.000Z	RomPres		I don't want postfix.
2004-12-19T12:42:00.000Z	njs12345	RomPres	it's because ubuntu-base and ubuntu-desktop depend on postfix
