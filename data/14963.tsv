2011-05-03T06:54:00.000Z	traskers		I'm attempting to get Gnome Shell installed on Ubuntu 11.04 by using the gnome3-team/gnome3 PPA, but when I'm "sudo apt-get dist-upgrading" after an update, I keep running into an error with gir1.2-mutter, can anyone point me in the right direction?
2011-05-03T06:55:00.000Z	cheapie	traskers	What's the error?
