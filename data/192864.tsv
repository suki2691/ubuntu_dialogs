2006-04-01T15:36:00.000Z	infamousjeff	eth42	your usb mouse is it plugged into a usb port or is it using a ps2 adapter?
2006-04-01T15:37:00.000Z	infamousjeff		nabiki: it shouldnt affect the performance like it does windows because of the sweet filesystem.. ext3 doesnt fragment afaik
2006-04-01T15:37:00.000Z	eth42	infamousjeff	no, but maybe there is an internal ps/2 adapter? at least in xorg.conf, the protocol is ImPS/2
