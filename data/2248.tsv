2012-06-26T15:55:00.000Z	ismail_213213		i will get a backup with clonezilla of my ext4 ubuntu 12.04 parttition. it is possible to get this backup to work on another computer (with bigger partittion)? Ä±f i boot Ubuntu, it will open properly?
2012-06-26T15:56:00.000Z	fidel	ismail_213213	clonezilla just heavily dislikes smaller target-partitionsd
2012-06-26T15:56:00.000Z	fidel		having bigger targets shouldnt be an issue
2012-06-26T15:57:00.000Z	ismail_213213	fidel	ok i know. but i don't know if ubuntu 12 will start properly because it will be on another machine. driver problems etc... ?!
