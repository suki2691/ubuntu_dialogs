2006-07-04T08:42:00.000Z	JTSilius		here's my problem: I cant get any screen resolution other than 640x800. i tried reconfiguring xorg and it gave me the options for higher resolutions but in gnome i cant select any other resolution than 640x800. my video card is a 3dfx voodoo 3 3000, 16 megs of memory on it.
