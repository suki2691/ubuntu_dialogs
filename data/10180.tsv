2011-10-29T11:36:00.000Z	madsailor	antnash	 server load or network lag perhaps?
2011-10-29T11:36:00.000Z	antnash	madsailor	I would say yes but it's fine with cifs.
2011-10-29T11:38:00.000Z	madsailor	antnash	I have had no problems, and don't know of any outstanding issures w/nfs, but my experience and knowledge is very limited.  I know that it is possible to specify read/write size and (I think) caching, which might help
