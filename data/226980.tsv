2007-01-09T17:13:00.000Z	pianoboy3333		Can anyone help print to a HP LaserJet 1000 connected to a Windows XP machine on my house network? I'm on edgy/gnome. When I try and print anything, when I click System -> Admin. -> Printing -> (right click on my printer) Properties, under status it says "Printing: No %%BoundingBox: comment in header!"
