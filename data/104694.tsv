2008-08-26T19:40:00.000Z	Taza		How do I list all mounted devices?
2008-08-26T19:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Taza	mount
2008-08-26T19:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Taza	on its own lists the mountings
2008-08-26T19:42:00.000Z	Taza	ActionParsnip	Thanks. I was thinking it was some kind of switch for mount, instead of just the plain command
