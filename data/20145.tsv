2011-06-22T01:51:00.000Z	Marchitos		why does i can't run su?
2011-06-22T01:51:00.000Z	Marchitos		and i need sudo?
2011-06-22T01:51:00.000Z	joel135	Marchitos	do you mean that sudo works, but su doesn't?
2011-06-22T01:53:00.000Z	joel135	Marchitos	you need to give the user 'root' it's own password, but it isn't adviced for sequrity reasons. instead use the workaround "sudo su "
