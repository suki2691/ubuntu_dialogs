2008-07-14T23:21:00.000Z	sipior	Funcan	i don't believe there is a gui for that, but you can easily make one with dd, mkswap and swapon
2008-07-14T23:25:00.000Z	sipior	Funcan	to be more specific: "dd if=/dev/zero of=swapfile bs=1024 count=1000000" makes a gigabyte (empty) file, "mkswap swapfile" will make it a swap file, and "swapon swapfile" will make it available to the system.
