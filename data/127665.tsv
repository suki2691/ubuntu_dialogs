2010-09-01T12:22:00.000Z	Antonis		good morning folks. a friend of mine did something on my netbook (for fun) which shows a notification every x seconds (think its 15) but I can't find where or what to turn it off.. could you please help me? it's not a script or something in "Startup Applications"
2010-09-01T12:24:00.000Z	Antonis		is there a way to see what processes / apps start at startup except of that dialog?
2010-09-01T12:25:00.000Z	turt1e	Antonis	you are going to need to run top or htop and wait for it to pop up again and see what the program is called
2010-09-01T12:25:00.000Z	Antonis	turt1e	hm.. will try that right now
