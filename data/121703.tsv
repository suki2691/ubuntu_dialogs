2008-03-16T05:42:00.000Z	Fryguy--	s2a	probably, also take a look at just virtualizing an entire windows xp session using something like virtualbox
2008-03-16T05:42:00.000Z	s2a	Fryguy--	Invisionfree, ill try vmware cuz i had problems with sharing files
2008-03-16T05:43:00.000Z	Fryguy--	s2a	i would highly recommend using virtualbox instead of vmware
