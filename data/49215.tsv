2009-10-07T12:44:00.000Z	deanc[work]		Hi folks. My firefox displays a big grey box with a play icon whenever this is flash on the page. Rather than autoplaying the movies, it requires me to click play. Any ideas how to solve this?
2009-10-07T12:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	deanc[work]	do you have more than 1 flash plugin installed?
2009-10-07T12:47:00.000Z	deanc[work]	ActionParsnip1	not that i am aware of
2009-10-07T12:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	deanc[work]	i suggest you uninstall all flash packages (flashplugin-installer flashplugin-nonfree gnash swdec whatever) then install only flashplugin-nonfree
