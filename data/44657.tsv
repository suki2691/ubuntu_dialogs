2010-02-05T15:01:00.000Z	carlos24cm		I have a big problem
2010-02-05T15:01:00.000Z	carlos24cm		I wrote in terminal sudo gconf-editor and here I went to desktop> gnome> Background> and in draw_background and Picture_filename, with the right mouse button, I've set the keys as mandatory. The problem is that now I can not change desktop background
