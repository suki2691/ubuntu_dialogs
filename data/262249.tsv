2007-04-19T16:17:00.000Z	sc00t3r		Anyone having issues with the torrent? I'm getting "rejected by tracker - Requested download is not authorized for use with this tracker" - the url is "http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.04/ubuntu-7.04-desktop-i386.iso.torrent"
2007-04-19T16:18:00.000Z	sc00t3r		I already have a copy of the iso dated 15th, can I assume that this build hasn't changed since?
