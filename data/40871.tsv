2010-01-05T11:34:00.000Z	ralf_e		are there plans to replace apparmor in ubuntu? (just wondering if it makes sense to create profiles for it at this point in time)
2010-01-05T11:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ralf_e	 ive not heard mention about replaceing it.. #ubuntu+1 may know.
2010-01-05T11:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ralf_e	 actually You hear very little about apparmor really.
2010-01-05T11:36:00.000Z	ralf_e	Dr_Willis	yeah, it seems pretty much dead, that's why I'm asking.
