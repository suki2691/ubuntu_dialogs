2007-06-09T14:58:00.000Z	aamy		i'm installing ubuntu on my desktop right now, it didn't ask me to configure GRUB (to dual boot with windows) yet....i'm kinda worried, don't want to loose the ability to boot into windows just yet. is GRUB autoconfigured?

2007-06-09T14:59:00.000Z	XiCillin		GRUB will detect your windows partition
