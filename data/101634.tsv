2009-06-09T15:07:00.000Z	[nrx]		I have a weird problem, not necessarily Ubuntu related. In a hotel, I've purchased wireless access. However, once connected, the browser doesn't load the correct 'login page' so I can't get it enabled. If I boot up in XP or OSX then it's fine. Can anyone help? :(

2009-06-09T15:09:00.000Z	[nrx]	Tiede	I guess it's possible but i'm running firefox in both Linux and the others with no problems. I've been to other hotels and not had this problem. It's got me flumaxed
2009-06-09T15:12:00.000Z	[nrx]	Tiede	SunnyD: From what I can remember, it doesn't seem to give me a proper connection. Yes, it's connected to the network and I have an address assigned as well as the DNS servers etc however I can't ping any IP on the network (including the default router, DNS etc) It comes back with destination unknown or similar (can't remember, was last night :) )
