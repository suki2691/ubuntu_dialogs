2007-05-11T06:28:00.000Z	sync0		Hey, anyone know how to switch from Kubuntu to Ubuntu?  I was running Ubuntu origionally, switched to Kubuntu about 5 or 6 months ago, and now I'm still technically using Kubuntu, but under session options i'm logging into Gnome.  How can I just use Ubuntu like I did origionally, (ie. so that at startup it says Ubuntu instead of Kubuntu; using the Ubuntu login instead of the Kubuntu login, etc.)

2007-05-11T06:38:00.000Z	sync0	mobutu	it's still booting into kubuntu... if i delete kubuntu/kde, will that make it go back to Ubuntu/Gnome, or will that just fuck me over?
