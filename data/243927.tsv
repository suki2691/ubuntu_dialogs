2005-04-19T09:06:00.000Z	apokryphos	mrc3	well, no -- there is a different name :). Apart from that, lotta bug fixes, some updated apps etc.
2005-04-19T09:06:00.000Z	mrc3	apokryphos	thanks! wanted to know if there were changes from that RC, as i just downloaded it yesterday!...
2005-04-19T09:07:00.000Z	apokryphos	mrc3	hehe. Nevermind; you can always just update from apt, remember. No need to download an ISO again. :)
