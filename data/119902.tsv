2008-05-11T00:29:00.000Z	fifthrune		so can someone help me with my VLC problem?
2008-05-11T00:31:00.000Z	fifthrune		er, ok here's a re-phrase: my VLC player cannot play .mkv and some .mpg files if they have dashes or spaces in their filenames.  I am running latest version on Hardy 32-bit.
2008-05-11T00:32:00.000Z	fifthrune		did I not phrase my question correctly?
2008-05-11T00:33:00.000Z	bazhang	fifthrune	what about when you change their names
