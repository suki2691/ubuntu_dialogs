2011-10-15T20:29:00.000Z	famgod		has anyone succesfully installed the the catalyst (fglrx) 11.9 on ubuntu?  I remove (apt-get remove fglrx) but when I try to install the 11.9 drivers it says there are older drivers already installed...help!
2011-10-15T20:30:00.000Z	totex	famgod	DONT install the 11.9 driver. it is very buggy and useless!
2011-10-15T20:31:00.000Z	famgod	totex	can you be more specific about the bugs?  all I know is that the 11.9 fixes the graphical corruption if you use gnome3 (gnome-shell)
2011-10-15T20:32:00.000Z	totex	famgod	yeah but gnome 3 still dosent work. people have problems even in other DE's like kde also. it is and failure from amd...
