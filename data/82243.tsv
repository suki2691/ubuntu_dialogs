2008-08-14T19:44:00.000Z	ozpowermo1		Does anybody know how to run win 32 executables in ubuntu? I have wine installed and I use Dev C++ to do some programming, but I can't run the executables... any help?
2008-08-14T19:46:00.000Z	jrib	ozpowermo1	why not program for linux?
2008-08-14T19:47:00.000Z	ozpowermo1	jrib	I don't like any of the IDEs, and Dev C++ doesn't make their IDE for linux
2008-08-14T19:48:00.000Z	jrib	ozpowermo1	I don't really see much sense in creating windows executables in linux and running them through wine though.  Who needs an IDE anyway?  Load up your favorite text editor and compile the file with gcc
