2006-02-28T13:43:00.000Z	Bergcube		thegladiator~  Ah, but here is the rub:  Do we know that the kernel is ABLE to utilise more than 512 Mbyte RAM?  Or is there a built-in limit / cut-off somewhere?
2006-02-28T13:45:00.000Z	Bergcube		Good!  Then you people have answered both my questions on swap.  Thanks a lot!
