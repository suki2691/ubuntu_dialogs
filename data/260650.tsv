2005-03-09T09:16:00.000Z	server16		I just installed ubuntu, itr never prompted for a root password, I've tried some of the obvious ones but they did not work, is there a default that it sets for root?

2005-03-09T09:17:00.000Z	gpled	server16	sudo apt-get install bzflag
2005-03-09T09:17:00.000Z	gpled	server16	and it will ask you for a passwrd
