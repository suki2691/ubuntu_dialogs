2006-02-25T12:25:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		I need to know how to do text replacement in a file with wildcards; can someone help me through that?
2006-02-25T12:26:00.000Z	ruby123	tonyyarusso	does the file contains wildcards, or do you want to use wildcards to perform the replacement?
2006-02-25T12:26:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ruby123	I want to use them in the replacement.  The file and replacing text contain special characters that might need escaping though.
