2011-04-01T21:47:00.000Z	JeffJassky		why are there so many processes for apache running?
2011-04-01T21:47:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	JeffJassky	Probably because of the number of threads/children for apache is set that way?
2011-04-01T21:48:00.000Z	JeffJassky	KB1JWQ	Is that normal? I'm rather new to server admin..
