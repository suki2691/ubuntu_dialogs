2007-05-07T16:44:00.000Z	dping28		I was wondering if someone could help me with a mail server problem.. I have been following this howto http://flurdy.com/docs/postfix/ and have managed to get all services running however when i send mail its perm delayed with connect to 127.0.0.1[127.0.0.1] : Connection refused and any mail I send to it never comes
2007-05-07T16:45:00.000Z	dping28		sure one sec
2007-05-07T12:10:00.000Z	dping28		If I have a domain that has a mx pointing at a server handling the mail and i have no access to it for smtp other than a web browser, and i have a linux box running apache and postfix would I have problems sending mail from the linux box since the mx is not that machine and no access to the smtp portion
2007-05-07T12:10:00.000Z	Gerro	dping28	what is a mx?
