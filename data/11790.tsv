2011-07-21T07:39:00.000Z	kn100-nosound		I'm running ubuntu 10.10 (elementary os) and for some reason my sound doesn't work. It worked fine a few hours ago, and it's been known to stop working in ubuntu a few times before but a reboot generally fixed it, now it's not working at all
2011-07-21T07:39:00.000Z	kn100-nosound		can anyone suggest anything
2011-07-21T07:40:00.000Z	dli	kn100-nosound	my wild guess, pulseaudio trouble
