2006-04-17T16:20:00.000Z	Overand	patrick52222	all (real) domains names allow subdomains
2006-04-17T16:20:00.000Z	Overand	patrick52222	I use godaddy.com to register my domain names, but it's just one of countless good ones.
2006-04-17T16:24:00.000Z	Overand	patrick52222	that would be something you would do through whoever/whatever provides your DNS service.
