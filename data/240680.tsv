2006-12-26T14:28:00.000Z	josteinaj		I can't get my Alt Gr button to work. I have googled it without finding any successful solutions. Any tips?
2006-12-26T14:29:00.000Z	enyc	josteinaj	what are you trying to do ?  Alt-Gr+something ?
2006-12-26T14:30:00.000Z	enyc	josteinaj	does it work under non-xgl x-server ?
2006-12-26T14:30:00.000Z	enyc	josteinaj	hrrm sounds like xgl config is causing some problem to me ?
