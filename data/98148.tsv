2008-03-08T03:35:00.000Z	sboss		should I install Ubuntu x86 (386) or 64bit on a Intel Core2Duo based laptop?  It is a 64bit processor.  But I dont know if it will help me or not.  This is a desktop install on a laptop that will run VMWare Server that will host my WIndows XP VM.

2008-03-08T03:37:00.000Z	sboss	usse1	thanks alot.  That is what I was leaning towards but did not know if the 64bit would give me anything special.  thanks again!!
