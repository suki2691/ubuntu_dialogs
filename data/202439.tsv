2008-10-03T09:00:00.000Z	IdleOne	Pavlz	not to mention that you cannot sue Canonical or Mark Shuttleworth because it is clearly stated that Ubuntu is distributed without warranty
2008-10-03T09:14:00.000Z	IdleOne	Pavlz	what version of Ubuntu are you running?
2008-10-03T09:17:00.000Z	IdleOne	Pavlz	tritium asked earlier of what update you were speaking about. there has not been any updates to nautilus according to tritium
