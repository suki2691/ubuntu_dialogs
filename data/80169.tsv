2008-09-19T09:08:00.000Z	Shout1		When I try to look up the man page for the connect command I get the error saying there is no manual entry for connect.  But the command exists, anyone know why?
2008-09-19T09:08:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Shout1	try "info connect"
2008-09-19T09:14:00.000Z	Shout1	dmsuperman	I didnt find anything there
2008-09-19T09:16:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Shout1	Have you tried connect --help ?
