2009-12-31T03:41:00.000Z	Chrystallic		My ubuntu suddenly couldn't find the initrd.img-2.6.28-11-generic file, and as a result it won't boot..(I'm currently using vista, and it's killing me slowly...) I use linux ubuntu 9.04. I can find the file easily, but it won't recognize it... can anyone give me a hint to fix it...... I have no idea what happened. I turned the computer off yesterday, and when I tried to boot it today it was dead, or rather I got a screen filled with al
