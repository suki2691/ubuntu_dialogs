2005-03-18T16:23:00.000Z	membreya	eric	I run ubuntu because I prefer my machine to be stable :) ...and I have no real need for windows because I don't play most of the games
2005-03-18T16:24:00.000Z	eric	membreya	: there is a lot of games on linux platform too
2005-03-18T16:25:00.000Z	membreya	eric	I like the little mindless games that linux has :)
