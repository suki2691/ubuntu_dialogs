2007-06-11T06:44:00.000Z	MinceR		how can i pass a parameter to a module at booting the livecd? pressing F6 and inserting "saa7134.pinnacle_remote=1" before or after the "--" doesn't work.
2007-06-11T06:44:00.000Z	Frogzoo	MinceR	it should go on the kernel line
2007-06-11T06:45:00.000Z	MinceR	Frogzoo	but i do access that from the livecd boot menu via f6, right?
2007-06-11T06:46:00.000Z	Frogzoo	MinceR	sounds right, don't use the live cd myself
