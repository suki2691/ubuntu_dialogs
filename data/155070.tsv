2008-07-07T15:07:00.000Z	Surge_		Is there an "alternative" CD install for the server version of Ubuntu? I only see the altenative install for the desktop distro.
2008-07-07T15:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Surge_	there is no need for an alternative server cd
2008-07-07T15:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Surge_	the server cd does not install with a X11 gui
2008-07-07T15:15:00.000Z	Surge_	ikonia	That's odd - maybe I didn't have the server CD install. I got a nice live CD when I booted off it. The problem being that there is no software RAID configuration in the GUI whereas the alternative CD has it.
