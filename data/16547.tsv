2011-04-28T22:30:00.000Z	HyperShock	Stava	your update_manager under system->administration can help you with that
2011-04-28T22:30:00.000Z	Stava	HyperShock	why wont just apt-get dist-upgrade do it? :o
2011-04-28T22:30:00.000Z	HyperShock	Stava	no clue, just a user like you, different software. how come you don't want to use the gui?
