2005-02-21T09:47:00.000Z	_Syzygy_		a question for people used to IRC...why have I been *almost* kicked out of #debian when I asked a question and said I used Ubuntu??? I don't understand anything!
2005-02-21T09:49:00.000Z	_Syzygy_		that would be cool jnk :D
2005-02-21T09:50:00.000Z	_Syzygy_		yeah but it's been almost violent! they've said: "run while you can...if you use ubuntu, don't tell us"
