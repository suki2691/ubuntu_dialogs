2007-03-16T08:11:00.000Z	AzMoo		Hi, I've installed a LAMP server but I need to customize my PHP configuration. I need to add several things, such as mcrypt and PDFLib. Are there packages to do this?

2007-03-16T08:13:00.000Z	AzMoo	preaction	No, I need extra modules that don't come with the install.
