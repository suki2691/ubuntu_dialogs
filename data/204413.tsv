2006-02-21T08:08:00.000Z	jaro		Hi there. Does anyone know about some editor which works well on really large files without loss of speed?
2006-02-21T08:08:00.000Z	jaro		(for example 42MB of plain text)
2006-02-21T08:10:00.000Z	wastrel	jaro	 i've edited files that large in vim
2006-02-21T08:11:00.000Z	jaro	wastrel	I do. But loading time is quite long.
