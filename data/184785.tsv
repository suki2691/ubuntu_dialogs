2006-08-24T07:51:00.000Z	sethk	VitaminG	the libraries aren't that large, it seems foolish not to run something just because it uses kde libraries
2006-08-24T07:51:00.000Z	VitaminG	sethk	I have dial-up, so the KDE libs are a fairly large download for me
2006-08-24T07:52:00.000Z	sethk	VitaminG	ok, but if you need them, start the download and go to sleep
