2008-12-10T05:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	computer	 'sudo apt-get update' 'sudo apt-get upgrade'    Your differeance between admin and root is.. err.. not correct
2008-12-10T05:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	computer	 there is no root password..  the initial user has 'sudo' rights.. and yes it will want their password.
2008-12-10T05:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	computer	 I guess you could call the 'first' user you made the admin account.. but its rarely called that..
