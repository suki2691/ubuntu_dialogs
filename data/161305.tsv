2010-01-07T12:47:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46		I attempted to make a personal repository on my computer using the tut located here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Personal. However, the command "update-mydebs" does not work.  Could someone take a quick look, and maybe figure out why?

2010-01-07T12:51:00.000Z	nastas	Lostinspace_46	did you do exactly what the how to say?
2010-01-07T12:52:00.000Z	nastas	Lostinspace_46	while doing this (twice) did you get any error?
