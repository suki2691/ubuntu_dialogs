2007-10-10T15:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	andy_33	well, if you have a guess you can grep the output of 'ps aux'

2007-10-10T15:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	andy_33	For instance, Gnome's window manager is metacity.  'ps aux' is a command that outputs all running processes, and 'grep' is a pattern matching tool.  'ps aux | grep metacity' would display a line with information about it if it is in fact running, and no output if not.
