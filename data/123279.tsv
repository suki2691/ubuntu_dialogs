2007-10-19T00:57:00.000Z	Luca		I have an amd 64 older 3000+ you recomend x64 version or x86?
2007-10-19T00:57:00.000Z	Evanlec	Luca	there's really no reason not to run x64 in my opinion....
2007-10-19T01:07:00.000Z	Evanlec	Luca	its about 5-10% overalll like he said, some apps can be up to 60% faster
2007-10-19T01:07:00.000Z	Evanlec	Luca	if i were u i'd give ti a shot...the only way ppl are going to move to 64-bit is if they start using it!@!
