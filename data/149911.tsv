2007-06-25T08:15:00.000Z	Bogaurd		I'm having the same issue as described in this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.22/+bug/118580 - There has already been a response posted - does this mean in the next kernel release these modules will be present/enabled?
2007-06-25T08:16:00.000Z	Pici	Bogaurd	Only if you are running 2.6.22, which right now is only in Gutsy
2007-06-25T08:17:00.000Z	Bogaurd	Pici	hrmm. I'm not no. I'm running feisty. Would it be possible to somehow enable this module on feisty?
2007-06-25T08:17:00.000Z	Pici	Bogaurd	I think it would require compiling your own kernel, but I'm not sure.
