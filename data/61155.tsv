2009-09-27T20:55:00.000Z	sirninja		this is probably a longshot, but my headphone jack on my laptop is physically broken, and I was wondering if it is possible to reroute the output to the mic jack. I have a feeling it's wired so that isn't possible, but if any of you think it might be possible, I would appreciate your help.
