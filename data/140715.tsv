2007-11-06T03:22:00.000Z	roadfish		is there a recommended tool for browsing fonts? something better than xlsfonts.
2007-11-06T03:24:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	roadfish	how about just typing 'fonts:///' into nautilus's location bar
2007-11-06T03:25:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		!enter | Dimitriid
2007-11-06T03:28:00.000Z	roadfish	Paddy_EIRE	thanks for the tip ... and then I can right click to view with "GNOME font viewer". but, tsk, some non-latin fonts don't show anything :-(
