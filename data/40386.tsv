2009-12-24T16:22:00.000Z	obiwan_	dnivra	yeah, that's what i guess hehe, i just wanted to say my friends i finally ordered my first ubuntu cd from canonical, but it'll be useless if it's 32. I have yet a 64 karmic burned cd, i just wanted to have an original one sent by them :$ but guess this ain't my chance
