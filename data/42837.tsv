2010-01-12T23:48:00.000Z	Zteam	trism	 well it should rebuild but it won't work
2010-01-12T23:48:00.000Z	Zteam	trism	 See here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-180/+bug/438398
2010-01-12T23:57:00.000Z	trism	Zteam	according to apt-cache, the header is a dependency of nvidia kernel source, so it should be installed
