2011-11-25T20:52:00.000Z	broglin		i'm having trouble getting my ethernet card to work properly. currently ping drops lots of packets. It's a realtek rtl8111/8168b on the motherboard and I have changed the driver to the realtek on, but that didn't help
2011-11-25T20:53:00.000Z	broglin		any ideas on what to try?
2011-11-25T20:53:00.000Z	broglin		the main problem is that it's very very very slow at the moment
