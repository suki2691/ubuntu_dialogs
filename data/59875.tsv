2009-05-26T09:09:00.000Z	lstarnes	mase_work	that applies only to GPL-licensed free software
2009-05-26T09:10:00.000Z	lstarnes	mase_work	a lot of other free software is licensed under other licenses like the BSD license, but many of them don't require that dreivitabe works be kept free
2009-05-26T09:10:00.000Z	mase_work	lstarnes	thats true, but all of the licenses, BSD, MIT etc.. are all copyright licenses
