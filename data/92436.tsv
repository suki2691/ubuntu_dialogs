2008-11-29T02:03:00.000Z	genii	StephenF	raid5 for 4 drive setup will give most bang for the buck
2008-11-29T02:05:00.000Z	StephenF	genii	how would I handle the boot partition
2008-11-29T02:06:00.000Z	genii	StephenF	Make a small partition at start of each drive which is not in the raid. Use that to have uncompressed /boot
