2011-07-04T05:33:00.000Z	rww	Burzmali	in your case, package probably equals openjdk-6-jre
2011-07-04T05:38:00.000Z	Burzmali	rww	Do you happen to know it the upstream cares about what is posted on our side?
2011-07-04T05:38:00.000Z	rww	Burzmali	Depends on the upstream. In a perfect world, the BugSquad forwards bugs to upstream if necessary.
