I can have Nvidia's drivers working fine and everything going well, however when I restart or turn off my computer the drivers seem to unistall themselves or something because it says (I'll find the log out in a minute) that something have version blah and something else has a lower version. This is made more irritating because I can restart X until I go blue and it will work but it is when I turn off my compute
