2008-06-03T23:42:00.000Z	isleshocky78		Anyone know what this error could be from and why it causes my machine to restart right around 72 on the dmesg log? "dhco_input_option: Value 4294967295 cannot be converted to type L"

2008-06-03T23:47:00.000Z	bluk		do you know any tool that trace every action of some application, so if it crashes the system and reboot, one can still analyze what happened?
2008-06-03T23:47:00.000Z	isleshocky78	bluk	I'm going to try that right now. I thought it was since I always have the same ip. But it must've been set at the router. I'm also having a hard time finding a config dialog for network settings in KDE 4.0. So I'll have to do it through cli.
