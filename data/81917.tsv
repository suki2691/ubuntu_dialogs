2009-06-07T04:34:00.000Z	frubuntu		Hi. I just updated from 8.10 to 9.04 and cannot start Xorg any more. The machine crashes max. 5 sec after typing in "startx". I have NVidia 6600GT and tried drivers nvidia 180, 173, nv, as well as vesa! Very frustrating. Any hints what I might do wrong?
2009-06-07T04:35:00.000Z	frubuntu		Strange thing is: I can run the live disk for hours without problems!
2009-06-07T04:36:00.000Z	frubuntu		I have tried a complete reinstall ... did not work either. As soon as the system boots into the installed version, X is no longer working. I can only boot into rescue "root shell with network" and that's that.
