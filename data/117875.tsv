2007-11-21T21:28:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	erUSUL	is what i am looking for is info ow whae settings are where, so I can decide what i want to adjust. The immediate thing I want to do is reduce the number of terminals to 3, including the gui. But there were many other things I could break in the inittab. The info I have found is fragmented and incomplete for someone not very very good with linux.
