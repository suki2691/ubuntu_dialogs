2011-02-02T21:28:00.000Z	kmck	KaiForce	ok so i just need to put the disk in, the ubuntu OS will realize what's going on and the disk will allow me to reformat and completely install just win7 on my laptop?
2011-02-02T21:28:00.000Z	KaiForce	kmck	 you'll boot with the windows 7 install cd (dvd?)  ubuntu won't even be running
