2005-11-04T09:44:00.000Z	trask_trojanek		I'm looking for a nice distro that could be easily modified(very openly open-source, perhaps?) and very nice for hacking, probably with some default programming code readers, etc. Has anyone got an idea of what I could use? Or perhaps Ubuntu is the one I'm looking for?
