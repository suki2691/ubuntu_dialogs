2009-01-09T20:18:00.000Z	abuchbinder		Does anyone know where I can find an XDCC service which *isn't* sending illegal files?
2009-01-09T20:19:00.000Z	abuchbinder		I think I've found a bug in xchat-gnome's handling of autoaccepted DCC transfers, but I can't really paste an example or reproduction instructions unless I have an XDCC server to work with.
2009-01-09T20:20:00.000Z	abuchbinder		Was that "!bug" directed at me?
2009-01-09T20:20:00.000Z	Jeruvy	abuchbinder	why don't you set up your own xdcc server then?
