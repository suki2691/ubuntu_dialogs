2006-05-11T09:09:00.000Z	wizzlefish		I've mounted "sda2," but is there any way to rename it to something more recognizable?
2006-05-11T09:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wizzlefish	 you can make the name of the mount point about anything..
2006-05-11T09:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wizzlefish	 i seem to recall some how setting the 'label' on the hard drives and they got mounted with that lable name some how. :P
2006-05-11T09:12:00.000Z	wizzlefish	Dr_Willis	well, I used the automatic partition mounting script
