2010-07-10T16:51:00.000Z	aliasd	amabo	it probably just wants to be extracted over /... Look inside the archive to be sure
2010-07-10T16:52:00.000Z	amabo	aliasd	all of it to root?
2010-07-10T16:54:00.000Z	aliasd	amabo	well, it would probably have paths relevant to root. You PROBABLY just need to tar xvzf Firefoxwhatever.tar.gz
