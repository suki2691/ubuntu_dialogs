2012-03-13T17:16:00.000Z	LiNuX`sup		when I load gnome3 it doesn't load it at all. instead it appears to load the same integrated toolbar from unity only showing the file menu and docking windows to top right of screen
2012-03-13T17:16:00.000Z	WhereIsMySpoon	LiNuX`sup	are you choosing a gnome3 session via the login screen?
2012-03-13T17:16:00.000Z	WhereIsMySpoon	LiNuX`sup	have you removed unity?
