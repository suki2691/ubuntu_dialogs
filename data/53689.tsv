2009-11-26T01:37:00.000Z	FoolishOwl		I'm planning to install Windows XP and Windows 7 on a second hard drive. One problem is, my system clock is set to UTC. Has the bug with Windows failing to understand UTC been fixed, or must I change the system clock to local time?

2010-01-31T10:41:00.000Z	FoolishOwl	Dr_Willis	I think I've tried that, but I should double check. I've been trying a lot of things with changing DNS servers, and that's not helped.
