2010-03-22T20:07:00.000Z	wols_	sanju_74	unpossible. WINE is 32bit only
2010-03-22T20:09:00.000Z	wols_	sanju_74	schroot or such, works fine, like any other 32bit software
2010-03-22T20:10:00.000Z	wols_	sanju_74	btw, I meant IE 64bit on any ubuntu. running IE on a 64bit ubuntu works just fine (as fine as IE runs under wine...). Install WINE and run IE
