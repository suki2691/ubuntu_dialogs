2008-06-21T05:53:00.000Z	banet416		hello i have hardy heron 8.04 cd i have burnt, i am trying to access the desktop with the livecd option, the problem is i have no monitor, instead i have a geforce fx5500 with svideo out. this svideo out plug is connected to a svideo-to-composite video. I thought that ubunntu would recognize this and show me a desktop on my tv, but nope... so i have no way of knowing what to do
