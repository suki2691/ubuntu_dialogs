2006-02-23T15:49:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha	lsuactiafner	how does vorbis differ in quality compared to mp3?
2006-02-23T15:50:00.000Z	OmegaAlpha		im just asking because im seeing them in apps asking me what format i want to choose as default for it
2006-02-23T15:52:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	OmegaAlpha	: if you share song use mp3, if you dont then use ogg since its better quality
