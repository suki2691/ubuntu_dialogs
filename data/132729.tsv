2008-11-20T19:28:00.000Z	Andreica		Hello.i like Ubuntu, but i am newbie and i have some problems. My computer's RAM is almost full everytime.At example i just started my computer and 709mb are occupied from 1gb. And if i start some massive applications like netbeans(that occupy almost 300mb of RAM) then my computer slows down. What to do?
