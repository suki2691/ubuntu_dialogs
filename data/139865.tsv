2009-07-04T13:35:00.000Z	smoo2		hello, I'm having troubles getting my new ubuntu box to display on my HDTV - each time I restart the resolution defaults to 1024x768 - how do I set the default to 1920x1080? Im using the latest nvidia drivers and have tried using the setup program. Ive also treid several xorg.conf changes but they didnt work either
2009-07-04T13:37:00.000Z	oldude67	smoo2	have you tried setting it threw the krandr program under systems?
2009-07-04T13:38:00.000Z	smoo2	oldude67	I've tried the display settings under preferences. I'll see if I've got krandr
2009-07-04T13:39:00.000Z	smoo2	oldude67	nope, im in gnome if that makes any difference
