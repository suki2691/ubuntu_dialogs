2011-08-08T20:09:00.000Z	craigbass1976		Which ssh version am I using.  --version tacked on the end of ssh isn't helping.
2011-08-08T20:09:00.000Z	rumpe1	craigbass1976	ssh -version (?)
2011-08-08T20:10:00.000Z	rumpe1	craigbass1976	erm... or even ssh -v ;)
2011-08-08T20:10:00.000Z	craigbass1976	rumpe1	thanks.  I was being too verbose...
