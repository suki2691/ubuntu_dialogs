2009-07-22T00:42:00.000Z	CopyWriter		ok next dumb question can a data partition filesystem be converted without losing data
2009-07-22T00:42:00.000Z	CopyWriter		like ntfs to ext3 or 4
2009-07-22T00:42:00.000Z	CopyWriter		reason i'm asking it'd be a pain to archive 5 tb data
2009-07-22T00:43:00.000Z	unop	CopyWriter	with ext3 to reiserfs or JFS to XFS, is possible (though not totally safe/guaranteed) - but i wouldn't be as confident with anything to do with NTFS
