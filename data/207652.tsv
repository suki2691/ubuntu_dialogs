Then, it goes to a screen with a blinking underscore. It stayed like that for 20 minutes. I noticed that it wasn't reading the CD-ROM drive. The same thing happens when I go to check the CD contents.

2006-11-11T17:59:00.000Z	Garrett	nalioth	You mean did I select the option for that on the boot screen?
