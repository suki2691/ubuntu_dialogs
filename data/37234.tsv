2010-03-22T01:27:00.000Z	cherwin	mikelifeguard	just use kill
2010-03-22T01:27:00.000Z	mikelifeguard	cherwin	I ask if screen can do it because then you can refer to it by the name you set with -S
2010-03-22T01:29:00.000Z	cherwin	mikelifeguard	you could write a small script to fix that for you, screen doesn't have such an option
