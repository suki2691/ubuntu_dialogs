2011-04-18T00:41:00.000Z	Weeze		Hi guys, I was wondering if I could bother you with some help getting XP and Ubuntu to get along?
2011-04-18T00:42:00.000Z	Weeze		hah :)
2011-04-18T00:43:00.000Z	Weeze		I have XP and Ubuntu installed on separate hard drives. I installed Ubuntu second, but XP just boots itself. It thinks it's the only game in town.
2011-04-18T00:44:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Weeze	my XP (pro) and have been living together successfully since 2007, what do you need?
