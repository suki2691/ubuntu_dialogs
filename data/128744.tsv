2007-09-01T11:37:00.000Z	Rexor_Moon		what command do I use to uninstall a program through the terminal?
2007-09-01T11:39:00.000Z	Rexor_Moon		cool, it wouldn't let me because I'm not root
2007-09-01T11:41:00.000Z	Rexor_Moon		hmm, is there a way to circumvent root to uninstall open-ssh from linux?
2007-09-01T11:41:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	Rexor_Moon	you use 'sudo' to do things as root
