2010-06-04T01:30:00.000Z	djrwolf		I updated Ubuntu and part of it was an update to grub. When it came up in the installation I told it to keep the old one and left everything as it was. Then when I tried to reboot into Windows it gave an error message. So I went back into Ubuntu and reinstalled grub and now when I select Windows it just loops back to grub.
