2009-10-30T18:33:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	unimatrix	cryptsetup and Truecrypt is not the same thing.
2009-10-30T18:34:00.000Z	unimatrix	leaf-sheep	which one is better?
2009-10-30T18:35:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	unimatrix	It depends on one's preferences. My belief is that cryptsetup is nice/better because that's something native in linux.
