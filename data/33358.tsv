2011-01-07T06:22:00.000Z	rumpe1	paq7512	dvd or... better... any /var/cache/apt/archive-directory from any other ubuntu with the same version
2011-01-07T06:24:00.000Z	rumpe1	paq7512	look "man hier" in terminal... there is every directory with explanation
2011-01-07T06:25:00.000Z	rumpe1	paq7512	/var   This directory contains files which may change in size, such as spool and log files.
