2010-03-11T06:55:00.000Z	switch10_		When I open a terminal and list the files and folders, I am in the root directory, not my /home/username directory.  How do I fix this?

2010-03-11T06:56:00.000Z	switch10_	Some_Person	yup
2010-03-11T06:56:00.000Z	switch10_	Some_Person	I have a root account as well
