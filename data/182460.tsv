2006-12-27T10:43:00.000Z	FlightOfStairs		how would I be able to do a very minimal install of ubuntu, for flash disks and stuff (is it even possible?)? the standard install from the cd requires 2Gb+
2006-12-27T10:44:00.000Z	stefg	FlightOfStairs	start with a 'server'-install (500MB) and carefully add packages... no metapackages like ubuntu-desktop... a fairly comple /xubuntu/ with ooo-writer and wine fits in 1GB on my lappie
2006-12-27T10:48:00.000Z	stefg	FlightOfStairs	depends on what you want... X? gtk2? applications?  noooo, no way... just a console and and a ssh-client: might work...
2006-12-27T10:49:00.000Z	stefg	FlightOfStairs	look at fluxbuntu...
