2011-06-27T04:25:00.000Z	Billjuik		Hey guys, I've been trying to get ubuntu working on my hp pavilion p6777c-b, but it just doesn't want to work right. Whenever I install it, I have problems with the window manager and lose the ability to interact with my screen and or minimize close or maximize windows, can you guys give me a hint as to what the problem might be or how I can fix it? thanks!
