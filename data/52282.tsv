2009-07-20T19:01:00.000Z	Threetimes	Nitrousoxide	it would be Xubuntu Jaunty
2009-07-20T19:02:00.000Z	Nitrousoxide	Threetimes	because on a tutorial to install WINE, it asks do you have ubuntu jaunty, but i have xubuntu jaunty
2009-07-20T19:02:00.000Z	Threetimes	Nitrousoxide	it probably won't mater that much, but XFCE is different from GNOME.
