2007-07-21T11:26:00.000Z	khafra		I try to upgrade to 7.04, and it tells me to free 117 megs on /usr--but I have over a gig free
2007-07-21T11:26:00.000Z	khafra		how do I make it believe I have enough free space on /usr to upgrade?
2007-07-21T11:27:00.000Z	khafra		Can I find out why update-manager doesn't think I have enough free space when I totally, like, do?
