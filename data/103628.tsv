2010-07-25T22:11:00.000Z	jNovice		Hi. I have coputer wiht Athlon 1,4 Ghz and with 1,5gb ddr. Will be Xbuntu 10.04 much more faster on this hardware than Ubuntu 10.04 ?
2010-07-25T22:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jNovice	XUbuntu will be faster on any hardware as it is leaner than gnome and kde
2010-07-25T22:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jNovice	there is also LUbuntu which will hopefully get official status and is lihter still
