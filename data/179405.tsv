2008-05-24T04:00:00.000Z	jrib	cory	I wouldn't blame you.  I don't see this as an easy thing to track down.  You could try a different ubuntu version too and see if that works out better
2008-05-24T04:01:00.000Z	cory	jrib	I think i will take that course of action. My hardware just has problems with linux.
2008-05-24T04:02:00.000Z	cory	jrib	when i upgrade i will probably try ubuntu again. This system is about 5 years old now anyway. Thanks for your time.
