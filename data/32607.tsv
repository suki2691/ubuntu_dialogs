2010-05-13T23:09:00.000Z	Rmorgan		my ion system keeps freezing!!! first it was freezing at 59% of the 10.04 install so i installed 9.10 and now its freezing after about 20 mins of use
2010-05-13T23:10:00.000Z	Rmorgan		will it generate a log or similar so i can see the cause of the freezing?
2010-05-13T23:10:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	Rmorgan	did you verify the ISO's before burning them
2010-05-13T23:11:00.000Z	Rmorgan	CogitoErgoSam	yeah and ive used them for installs on other machines successfully
