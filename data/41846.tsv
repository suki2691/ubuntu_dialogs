2010-01-26T03:51:00.000Z	Subby		Hi! How to append a string on a bash-variable, like file="myfile"  --> $fileiscool  <-- doesn't work because interpreter looks for variable "myfileiscool"
2010-01-26T03:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	Subby	ask in #bash
2010-01-26T03:51:00.000Z	Subby		sry, looks for variable "fileiscool"
2010-01-26T03:51:00.000Z	Subby	erUSUL	okay, sorry
