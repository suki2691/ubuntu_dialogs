2007-12-27T18:29:00.000Z	bryan		i think i found fix to my problem ... (in ubuntu forums i found i should press f6 on the start and add this line : "noapic nolapic pci=noacpi acpi=off" but should i add it in the start of the line or at the end ?

2007-12-27T18:35:00.000Z	uzerzero_	bryan	try using less of the options. try booting it with "noapic acpi=off pnpbios=off --" and make sure you include those last two dashes at the end, if that doesn't work try removing each option from the end
2007-12-27T18:38:00.000Z	uzerzero_	bryan	remove the last two dashes at the end of the line, add the commands followed by -- then hit enter
