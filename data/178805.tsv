2009-07-10T23:27:00.000Z	jrib	Houba1986	why do you want to do that?
2009-07-10T23:27:00.000Z	Houba1986	vise	k, thing is, i need to link jave 6 update 14 to firefox, and i gotta make the link inside the usr/lib/firefox/plugin directory, but its not letting me do it
2009-07-10T23:28:00.000Z	jrib	Houba1986	use ~/.mozilla/plugins/ but java is in the repositories and you shouldn't need to do any of this...
