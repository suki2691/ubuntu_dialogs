2007-09-15T11:02:00.000Z	Flannel	stalker_	Ubuntu doesn't do that.  Ubuntu has frozen versions per release (1.1 will always be 1.1, plus bux fixes).  If you want that, you should maybe think about debian.

2012-05-31T19:45:00.000Z	Flannel	stalker_	It's offtopic for here, and you don't need to repeat yourself anyway.
