2008-08-10T23:18:00.000Z	Vyom1		Can anyone help me with getting media support (MP3, MPEG, DVD etc) support installed on a PC which has no internet connection?
2008-08-10T23:19:00.000Z	Vyom1		I did download the ubuntu-restricted-extras .deb file, but I am not sure if I have downloaded all the dependent packages...
2008-08-10T23:20:00.000Z	Vyom1		... is there any Wiki page that lists all the dependencies of ubuntu-restricted-extras - not just the immediate ones?
