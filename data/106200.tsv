2008-05-27T13:22:00.000Z	Lynet	ikonia	How much integration is there anyway? Would it be possible to install a "stand-alone" ff alongside?
2008-05-27T13:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Lynet	firefox is stand alone - but for it to work as firefox currently does with gnome - that would be quite an overhead to intergrate every update
2008-05-27T13:24:00.000Z	Lynet	ikonia	"is standalone" "overhead to integrate". Those sound like conflicting statements.
2008-05-27T13:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Lynet	sorry, let me clarfiy, firefox is stand alone (grab a binary pack from mozilla.org for example) however ubuntu links firefox into the gnome envionrment for better interoperability
