2008-09-01T08:44:00.000Z	odditie		Alright, I'm back for some more. Running in a higher resolution right now, but thats only because I'm not running the driver it gives me for my nvidia card. I have went to nvidia and downloaded the driver, but I can't get it to run, says it has to run in root. Any help for this sad sad noob?
2008-09-01T08:46:00.000Z	odditie		it is a .run
2008-09-01T08:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	odditie	Have you tried System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers?
2008-09-01T08:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	odditie	Do not install using the .run
