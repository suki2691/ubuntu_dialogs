2009-11-11T21:07:00.000Z	X-Seti		upgrading from 9.04 to 9.10 is worrying, I have bugs all over the place..
2009-11-11T21:08:00.000Z	Snausages	X-Seti	I just ran that upgrade overnight...  seems to have mostly worked
2009-11-11T21:09:00.000Z	Snausages	X-Seti	though I think I didn't get the feature I upgraded for, and seem to have lost audio in the deal
2009-11-11T21:10:00.000Z	Snausages	X-Seti	eh, in the history of linux upgrades I'd still have to call this a success :)
