2007-03-16T14:22:00.000Z	LjL	carlesoriol	did andygraha ask how to create a root password?
2007-03-16T14:22:00.000Z	carlesoriol	LjL	andygraha> What is default root password for Ubutu?
2007-03-16T14:23:00.000Z	LjL	carlesoriol	yeah, and the answer is "none" (with the explanation "use sudo instead"). explaining how to enable a root password -- which is possibly *far* from the best thing to do -- is not best.
