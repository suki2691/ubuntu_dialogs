2008-10-10T07:22:00.000Z	mynameistux		you know how people say certain old computers will only recognise a HDD up to a certain size, why is that, or is it all FUD?
2008-10-10T07:23:00.000Z	mynameistux		I have a computer from 2002, running ubuntu server, and I want to know if I can put a 1TB hdd into it
