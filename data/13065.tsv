2012-10-02T13:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	gbili	 theres a .profile in your home dir.
2012-10-02T13:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	gbili	 and a .bashrc
2012-10-02T13:32:00.000Z	gbili	dr_willis	thanks .bashrc was the right answer, .profile only gets executed at login I think, wheras .bashrc does at every new session or window, don't know the exact terminology
