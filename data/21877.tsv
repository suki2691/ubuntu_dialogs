2011-02-24T13:53:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	darolu	no I have mplayer for that
2011-02-24T13:54:00.000Z	darolu	Us3r_Unfriendly	I'm now curious, what do you mean then? I may need to watch Die Hard 4 now :p
2011-02-24T13:54:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	darolu	no i'm trying to get more sound effects from a bash shell...like you would see in the movies.  I'm pretty sure I'd have to make a variable to achieve this
