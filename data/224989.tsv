2005-08-07T10:19:00.000Z	nox	Phuzion	i like "screem"
2005-08-07T10:20:00.000Z	Phuzion	nox	does that have the kind of stuff that dreamweaver has, like all of the different tags, and variables in drop down menus as you're coding?
2005-08-07T10:20:00.000Z	nox	Phuzion	i have never used dreamweaver, So i don`t know what are you talking about. Try it.. it is realy comfortable.
