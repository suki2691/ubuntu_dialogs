2011-06-15T09:59:00.000Z	celthunder	dallas1	no
2011-06-15T10:00:00.000Z	celthunder	dallas1	depends on respective versions of each but yes
2011-06-15T10:01:00.000Z	dallas1	celthunder	Okay. I was just curious because apparently google is working on a plugin to get netflix to work on Chrome OS and google Chrome. Just one less reason why I need a Windows partition.
