2011-10-27T23:17:00.000Z	Essence		Anyone can give me some advice about installing 11.10 with Win7? I have tried via the liveCD but, the installer doesnt seems to recognice the windows installation, despite its able to see all the partitions.... little bit weird.

2011-10-27T23:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Essence	no idea. I've not seen it much I guess. I'm not  windows user. You could chkdsk your ntfs to be sure its healthy
