2010-05-30T00:01:00.000Z	starghost		I have a bit of a problem. Running ubuntu in a virtual box vm enviorn for a while now. But I'm running out of allocated space. So I've created another virtual drive Ubuntu could use. But the primary virtual hard disk Ubuntu is sitting on is getting full and I'm getting warnings. Is there anyway to merge the two disks or allot the Ubuntu more hard drive space without uninstalling?
