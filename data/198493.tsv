Unless someone comes up with a Linux distro that can dumb everything down so the unitiated like myself can understand what's going on without cerebral hemmorhages, I don't think Linux will ever become the mainstream OS.

2006-03-01T09:05:00.000Z	Quinch	rambo3	Actually, I did. I hate to say it, but Windows is intuitive, to the point where it leverages everything else that sucks about it.
