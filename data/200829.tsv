2006-03-20T07:31:00.000Z	Xen		hello. I have a noobish question. I have set up apache server and it works when I go to http://localhost:9999. how would I find out what the address is so that others can access from the web?
2006-03-20T07:32:00.000Z	Steve^	Xen	it's your ip with :9999 on the end
2006-03-20T07:32:00.000Z	Steve^	Xen	 open a console, does it show your ip on the command prompt? (It shows mine)
