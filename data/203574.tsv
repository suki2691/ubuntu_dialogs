2007-09-23T14:58:00.000Z	kane77		i just downloaded iso, but the md5sum differs from the one that is on the page.. do I have to redownload? (the download in firefox stalled so I used wget -c)
2007-09-23T14:59:00.000Z	curious101	kane77	yeah?
2007-09-23T15:00:00.000Z	kane77	curious101	yeah.. all the major windows versions (including 3.11) plus _lot_ of linux distros + about 5 versions of dos
2007-09-23T15:02:00.000Z	curious101	kane77	cause if the md5sum doesn't match, it's quite a risk.
