2008-03-05T02:19:00.000Z	arakthor	lastelement0	my experience with that is limited, but in the past the only way I've seen people do it to scp (or similar) data between the guest and the host
2008-03-05T02:19:00.000Z	lastelement0	arakthor	what is scp?
2008-03-05T02:19:00.000Z	arakthor	lastelement0	secure copy over a network, uses ssh
