2009-06-22T18:02:00.000Z	jerroome		hello, I need to install a minimal desktop, therefor, I'm installing the following packages :gnome-core gdm xserver-xorg xfonts-base, this is working on a few machines but not on all I want to install. I'm not getting any signal. I checked the /var/log/syslog, but there is nothing concerning gdm or X. ps aux | grep gdm returns two /usr/bin/gdm lines, one for X and another for gdmgreeter. Does anyone have an idea where I should dig
