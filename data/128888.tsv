2007-10-02T13:11:00.000Z	Sleepy		Hi, got a small question. I got 4GB Ram & a Intel Core2Duo T7250... which Ubuntu Version do I need? The 64bit isofile says "....desktop-amd64.iso", which confuses me a bit ;)

2007-10-02T13:13:00.000Z	leo_rockw	Sleepy	i really don't know, sorry
2007-10-02T13:13:00.000Z	leo_rockw	Sleepy	i believe core2duo is 64, not sure tho
