2010-09-05T02:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	jk_	Why not remove Network Manger completely?
2010-09-05T02:49:00.000Z	jk_	Jordan_U_	That I can do, but doing so was a definite no-no on Hardy. Is it now a recommended solution?
2010-09-05T02:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	jk_	I don't know why it wasn't previously recommended, or by whom, so I can't say.
