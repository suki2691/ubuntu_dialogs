2011-06-23T03:50:00.000Z	Taroven		Anyone able to help with a fairly complex install? I've got an older computer without a working CD/DVD drive, currently running Crunchbang Statler (don't ask how I installed it in the first place...), trying to install from a Natty alternate ISO located on the hard drive.

2011-06-23T03:52:00.000Z	ZykoticK9_	Taroven	if you currently have Grub installed on the system, it is possible to boot ISO images (don't ask me how, no idea)
2011-06-23T03:53:00.000Z	Taroven	ZykoticK9_	That's the plan. Problem is adding the custom menu entry to do so.
