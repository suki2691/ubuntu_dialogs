2009-11-11T02:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	sik_gerar	I believe 9.10 doesn't actually build xorg.. xrandr is now used for video configuration.. However by placing a hand written xorg in the normal location (/etc/X11) you can override xrandr
2009-11-11T02:12:00.000Z	sik_gerar	bobbyd	so how do i configure it? i have dual screen and i cannot manage to find a way to use both with both gpus.. and theyre both listed in lspci..
2009-11-11T02:12:00.000Z	Scunizi	sik_gerar	read up on xrandr and randr..
