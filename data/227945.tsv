2008-12-28T12:49:00.000Z	nathanhelp		This is a question not specifically about Blender but more about the alongside things in Ubuntu... If I get Blender, should I also get python as well or is it already installed in ubuntu? (fresh install of 8.10)
2008-12-28T12:50:00.000Z	nathanhelp		and where can i find a list of things that have been installed?
2008-12-28T12:50:00.000Z	nick__	nathanhelp	use sudo aptitude install <package> as it will check dependencies such as python
2008-12-28T12:50:00.000Z	nick__	nathanhelp	either synaptic package manager, or aptitude
