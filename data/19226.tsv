2011-10-09T13:05:00.000Z	heoa_		I need to remove iwl3945 Realtek 802.11n Wlan driver, any cmd suggestions?
2011-10-09T13:06:00.000Z	ThinkT510	heoa_	iwl3945 is intel not realtek
2011-10-09T13:07:00.000Z	heoa_	ThinkT510	well I have Realtek driver and inter driver side-by-side, actually two drivers and they intercept one another
2011-10-09T13:11:00.000Z	ThinkT510	heoa_	then you have to remove it manually
