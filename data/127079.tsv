2007-09-30T15:31:00.000Z	vocx	_seanc_	Linux works okay with multiple cores. Although ultimately the programs themselves need to be optimized (compiled) to use multiple "threads".
2007-09-30T15:32:00.000Z	_seanc_	vocx	oh...is that a hassle?
2007-09-30T15:33:00.000Z	vocx	_seanc_	well, try redoing ALL Linux programs to use multiple cores. It is difficult.
