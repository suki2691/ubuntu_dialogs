2006-03-23T06:32:00.000Z	funkyHat		Anyone know a decent alternative to audacity (ardour isn't really an option...)
2006-03-23T06:33:00.000Z	dli__	funkyHat	audacity is the easiest for me
2006-03-23T06:33:00.000Z	funkyHat	dli__	the problem isn't that audacity is hard, it's that it won't work :(
2006-03-23T06:34:00.000Z	dli__	funkyHat	if audacity won't, the chance is others are not going any further
