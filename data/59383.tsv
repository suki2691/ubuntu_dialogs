2009-11-30T12:19:00.000Z	armornick	indus	it's a long term release, which means the packages are stabler because they are working on it longer
2009-11-30T12:21:00.000Z	armornick	indus	the underlying packages (kernel, etc) are still the same so they have more time to make it stable
2009-11-30T12:21:00.000Z	indus	armornick	why is the kernel the same?
