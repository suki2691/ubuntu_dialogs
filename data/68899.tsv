Music etc, also pics for wallpaper. I've set a wallpaper to something in the menu/appearance. When i reboot the system, the background image doesn't set
2009-01-11T09:37:00.000Z	timeracerr		anyone knows what could be the problem?

2009-01-11T09:39:00.000Z	timeracerr	Marfi	you're right, its not there. Can you tell me please how i add it? Im noob. thanks
