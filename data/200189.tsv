2006-01-23T17:22:00.000Z	draconius		I just freshly reinstalled ubuntu, and I am having some sound issues: using ALSA, with both onboard and a PCI soundcard, if I do something like drag around terminals or switch virtual desktops, my sound gets terribly scratchy...but it is fine when I am not doing stuff like that...anybody have an idea?
2006-01-23T17:23:00.000Z	nbound	draconius	try a diff sound system (like OSS for example)
2006-01-23T17:25:00.000Z	draconius	nbound	does the same thing :/
2006-01-23T17:25:00.000Z	nbound	draconius	why do u need two scards any way =/????
