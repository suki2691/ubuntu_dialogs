2006-10-20T06:24:00.000Z	ptman		is there some documentation somewhere about how ubuntu accomplishes "live cd is install cd"
2006-10-20T06:24:00.000Z	variant	ptman	the live cd just contains a graphical installer..
2006-10-20T06:25:00.000Z	ptman	variant	yes, but earlier the install and live cd were separate, and now both of those fit on one cd. so how does the live cd run the software from inside the .debs (or something, I dunno, that's what I'd like to know)
2006-10-20T06:26:00.000Z	variant	ptman	I don't know either, never looked into it. I excpect it just copies accross some of the binarys from the cd
