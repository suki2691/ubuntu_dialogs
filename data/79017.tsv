2009-09-08T06:01:00.000Z	aeiah		ive got an older nvidia card but obviously they should be pretty similar. are you trying to change things through nvidia-settings?
2009-09-08T06:01:00.000Z	keres	aeiah	yes i was. I also tried editing xorg.conf manually, but that was ineffective
2009-09-08T06:03:00.000Z	aeiah	keres	ive gotta go. if you havent been doing so already, make sure you launch nvidia-settings as root, ie 'gksu nvidia-settings' so it actually saves changes to xorg.
