2010-08-02T16:01:00.000Z	Taev		hey can some one hook me up with a URL for an Ubuntu 10.04 Software Repository? I'm trying to get the newest version of ClamAV but my install of 8.04's synaptic only has an older version.
2010-08-02T16:01:00.000Z	Taev		I'm going to try installing the version thats available through 10.04
2010-08-02T16:02:00.000Z	MaRk-I	Taev	I dont think you can do that
2010-08-02T16:21:00.000Z	MaRk-I	Taev	"make uninstall" in the same folder will uninstall it, but anyways if it fails I doubt it'll go past "make"
