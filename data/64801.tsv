2010-07-31T23:19:00.000Z	lathan		can anyone help with my question? i can type it again if need be
2010-07-31T23:19:00.000Z	lathan		so, i have an SD card with Ubuntu Netbook Remix 10.4 on it. So, i boot from the SD card, and click to "test" ubuntu, but I also have a persistence file. Now, i want to install UNR on my hdd. how would i go about transferring my changes from my SD card's persistence file to my hdd install?
2010-07-31T23:21:00.000Z	lathan		does /home contain all my changes?
