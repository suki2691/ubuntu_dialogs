Unplugged and it did the same. So maybe the temporary workaround is to plug in and wait for a moment, then unplug and see if it updates?
2010-07-14T21:16:00.000Z	ottermaton__	cdubya	I _think_ I've done that, but will check it out next time. Do you have any trouble with random shutdows?

2010-07-14T21:19:00.000Z	cdubya	ottermaton__	but to me that's the whole issue. I don't want to have to keep track of how long I've been on battery and how much time is reasonable to be left
