Failing that, you can copy the file from another system, but then you'll have lost any custom changes you had on your system....
2009-07-24T22:32:00.000Z	Milos_SD		So, anyone know how to restor all groups ? I tried to restor group file from /var/backup/ but, not all are there :S
2009-07-24T22:33:00.000Z	Milos_SD	losher	it's not my system, it's theres... And I don't think they have some custom changes :)
2009-07-24T22:34:00.000Z	losher	Milos_SD	if there are no custom changes, a copy of /etc/group from a system running the same OS version will probably do the trick, then...
