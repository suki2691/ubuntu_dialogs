2009-11-11T00:57:00.000Z	furuno	nailora	: I highly recommend that you get back to pidgin :) As I do that too...
2009-11-11T00:58:00.000Z	furuno	nailora	: Pidgin >>>>> Empathy IMO
2009-11-11T00:58:00.000Z	nailora	furuno	yeah, i want to use telepathy for testing. but somehow it uses my real accounts all the time. so i want to reset the config. but i cannot find the config
