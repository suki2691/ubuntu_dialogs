2010-10-12T01:42:00.000Z	akoskm		hi! i'm just updated to 10.10, yesterday the networking worked fine, but no the network-applet managger says "no network devices available", anyone experiencing this?
2010-10-12T01:43:00.000Z	brad_	akoskm	I noticed my interface had no ip from dhcp, so yeah, I think there are some quirky things with 10.10
2010-10-12T01:44:00.000Z	brad_		install openssh-server
2010-10-12T01:45:00.000Z	akoskm	brad_	i can't manage any of my interfaces now, and if i right click to the applet the Enable Networking is checked but also greyed out :/
