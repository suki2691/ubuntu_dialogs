2007-02-02T11:58:00.000Z	Onburiiku		Hey, I got a question
2007-02-02T11:58:00.000Z	Onburiiku		I'm running Ubuntu via VMWare. Is that going to cause a problem with alot of things?
2007-02-02T11:58:00.000Z	Onburiiku		Like Wine, or my speakers not working?
2007-02-02T11:59:00.000Z	anon_	Onburiiku	that's a VMWare question, not an ubuntu one
