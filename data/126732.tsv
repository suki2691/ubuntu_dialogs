2007-07-28T13:09:00.000Z	Jimdb		any advice on retaining my system configuration when I upgrade my mobo?  I'm upgrading the mobo from a nforce4 939 athlon to nforce 590 socket am2 with an athlon 6000+? is there a way to do this without having to start all over?

2007-07-28T13:11:00.000Z	Bsims_	Jimdb	should just work
2007-07-28T13:12:00.000Z	Bsims_	Jimdb	the kernel is for all 386 so don't worry about it it should just Work
