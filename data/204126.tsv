2009-10-03T19:25:00.000Z	Doc_Lappy		well do you know where the config file is or how to do that or do I need to google it
2009-10-03T19:25:00.000Z	nutterpc	Doc_Lappy	if you want a firewall, I would suggest Firestarter, it does an excellent job and doesn't need a lot of configuration to run
2009-10-03T19:28:00.000Z	nutterpc	Doc_Lappy	check on the forums, there is a guide for how to get Firestarter working on startup, just needs a small (5mins) conf to your network requirements
