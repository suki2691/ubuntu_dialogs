2010-10-10T18:54:00.000Z	Moonlit	iflema	- I think I tried that ages ago, but in Ubuntu some of them are forced on regardless of that setting, but I'll try it again, thanks for the tip
2010-10-10T18:55:00.000Z	Moonlit	iflema	- yup, no luck, it was already unchecked :(
2010-10-10T19:01:00.000Z	Moonlit	iflema	- yeah, that's what I found, it's really annoying because in 9.04 and earlier I always used to turn all the icons off because I think they look cartoonish and horrible, but now for no good reason I'm *forced* to keep them because the Ubuntu designers say so, it's unfortunate
