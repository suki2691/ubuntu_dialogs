2008-08-29T15:29:00.000Z	agent		after installing ubuntu, i get a grub error 17, but after reinstalling ubuntu again, i get error 18. I tried re-installing windows mbr but that does not work either... any ideas? I also tried re-installing grub many times

2008-08-29T15:30:00.000Z	agent	arvind_khadri	I cannot wipe everything as I have a LOT of important information on there... partitions seem okay when I mount them in livecd
2008-08-29T15:31:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	agent	copy them somewhere...and then have a new geometry
