2008-02-21T17:52:00.000Z	tangle-tooth		Hi there :D. I've got a somewhat obscure question. I've got a large folder, full of subfolders which are regularly changed by an application. Is there an easy (read: command-line) way that I could selectively backup the ones that have changed in the last week or so?
2008-02-21T17:53:00.000Z	tangle-tooth		Okay. (still somewhat new at this)
