2006-09-22T06:58:00.000Z	KromiX		As far as Cedega goes, does it allow you to play games on linux like WOW and does just that, or does it play it flawlessly and as good as windows? Cause I really don't want to switch to a linux distro if i'm going to hinder my gaming experience....

2006-09-22T06:59:00.000Z	Samuli^	KromiX	of course you can have both.
