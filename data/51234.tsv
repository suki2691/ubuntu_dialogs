2012-07-11T00:17:00.000Z	stiv2k		what is the difference between the three sessiosn: gnome, gnome classic, gnome classic (no effects)?  The only one that doesn't crash for me is the 'no effects' one
2012-07-11T00:19:00.000Z	trism	stiv2k	gnome is gnome-shell, gnome classic is gnome-panel with compiz, gnome classic (no effects) is gnome-panel with metacity
2012-07-11T00:20:00.000Z	stiv2k	trism	how come the first two crash upon loading for me? i use the binary nvidia driver so i should have 3d working
2012-07-11T00:21:00.000Z	trism	stiv2k	yes, it should work with the proprietary nvidia module, so I don't know, sorry
