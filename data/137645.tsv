2010-03-14T22:03:00.000Z	bolexx		can't i use a uuid instead of a (hd1,5) in grub?
2010-03-14T22:03:00.000Z	bolexx		that would seem to solve my problem of using the drive on multiple computers
2010-03-14T22:05:00.000Z	bolexx		so my actual question: Is the UUID of a device persistent across different computers?
2010-03-14T22:05:00.000Z	llutz	bolexx	yes, its "part" of the filesystem
