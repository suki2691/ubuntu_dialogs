2006-08-13T14:04:00.000Z	woodwizzle		Is it possible to do an inverse find. Like say I want to find everything that ISN'T an mp3 in my music folder?
2006-08-13T14:05:00.000Z	slacker_nl	woodwizzle	find $PATH ! -name \*.mp3
2006-08-13T14:05:00.000Z	slacker_nl	woodwizzle	where $PATH is the path you want to search in
2006-08-13T14:05:00.000Z	woodwizzle	slacker_nl	thanks
