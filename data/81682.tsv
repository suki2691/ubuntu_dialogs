2009-09-03T14:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Gouda	not an issues with dydns / no-ip ;)
2009-09-03T14:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Gouda	if you access your lan from WAN then its handy so you dont have to remember or check your wan ip
2009-09-03T14:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Gouda	theres a client app for no-ip to refresh the resolution every so often so the records are updated if the dhcp lease expires and you get a new wan ip
