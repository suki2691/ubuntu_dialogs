2006-09-11T16:01:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	CalJohn	idk I would have thought wine would just give you a fresh set of new problems to deal with
2006-09-11T16:02:00.000Z	CalJohn	TheGateKeeper	yeah, very possible.  i would've thought firefox would work reasonably well though, and flash is simply an add-in.  plus it's flash9.  YMMV
2006-09-11T16:04:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	CalJohn	I'll give you the flash9 issue :-)
