2010-02-06T20:55:00.000Z	fakeer		Forgot my passphrase (have everything else). Have a revoke certificate and revoked my public key from all all main servers. Now it shows as || *** KEY REVOKED *** [not verified] || . What is this "not verified"? How can I remove or replace this key from keyservers? Or if I can't then what is the best option for me?
