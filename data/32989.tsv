2010-05-01T17:05:00.000Z	mariya	Mahara	thanks
2010-05-01T17:06:00.000Z	Mahara	mariya	from Applications->Ubuntu Software Center search for ubuntu-restricted-extras and install it; if this does not work then open Synaptic Package Manager and install gstreamer packages with ugly and bad in their names
