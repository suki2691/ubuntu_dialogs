2009-09-22T13:05:00.000Z	Ademan		i just read a little article, what are the implications of DeviceKit replacing HAL?  The only responsibility HAL had that I was aware of was hotplugging usb devices and making those events available over dbus... obviously they're more, the scope of "hardware abstraction layer" is far greater than that... but yeah...

2009-09-22T13:12:00.000Z	AfC	Ademan	that's the impression I get; could be wrong. I know hughsie is driving part of it.
