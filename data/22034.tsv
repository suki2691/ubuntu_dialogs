2011-01-15T21:30:00.000Z	MadCarburetor		I just installed the new unity 2d thingy on Ubuntu 10.10 and it's awesome. but, i can't have stuff on my desktop. how do i enable desktop icons
2011-01-15T21:30:00.000Z	MadCarburetor		There must be something that i can copy paste in the terminal to make the desktop work
