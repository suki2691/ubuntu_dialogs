2009-01-31T01:04:00.000Z	gcbzero		I want to install openoffice 3, but after adding "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/openoffice-pkgs/ubuntu/dists/intrepid/" to my sourcelist and updating apt i get a msg that  http://ppa.launchpad.net intrepid Release can't be checked because the public key is not available. Does anyone know how i add it to my apt?
