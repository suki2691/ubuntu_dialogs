2012-01-14T13:27:00.000Z	Innocent		help!  first time noob here, just installed Oneiric 11.1 and i am having a super hard time figuring out how to move my minimize/maximize/close buttons from the left to the right hand side.  i've tried to do it through Ubuntu Tweak, and i've tried it through gconf-editor...no dice.
2012-01-14T13:28:00.000Z	Innocent		are any of you using 11.1 oneiric and have you successfully managed to move those buttons?
2012-01-14T13:29:00.000Z	NQTropic	Innocent	you tried changing themes?
