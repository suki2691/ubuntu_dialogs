2007-08-09T09:06:00.000Z	aaronm	jrib	no i mean im running an app like irssi right now, if i wanted to get to bash without opening another terminal and im not running screen is there a way to have it run in the background. note it's already open and CTRL Z suspends it meaning its not actually running is it? like if it was suspended and someone typed in IRC i wouldnt recieve that data since the job was suspended if that makes sense
