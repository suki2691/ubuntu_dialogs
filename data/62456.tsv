2010-06-21T03:49:00.000Z	jharrison186		A little help please: I'm trying to install Ubuntu on my Mac. The .iso file is 733MB and too big to burn on a CD. I don't have a flash drive. Any workarounds?
2010-06-21T03:50:00.000Z	iceroot	jharrison186	cant imaging the iso is 733mb
2010-06-21T03:50:00.000Z	iceroot	jharrison186	not the cd iso
2010-06-21T03:52:00.000Z	iceroot	jharrison186	the cd iso is less then 700mb
