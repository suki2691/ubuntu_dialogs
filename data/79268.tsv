2009-03-01T15:37:00.000Z	Daft_Punk		I am looking for a remote desktop program (client and server) that is easy to use and GUI (no terminal interface or commands required), i looked at VNC but it seemed to be all terminal commands according to man pages
2009-03-01T15:39:00.000Z	user____	Daft_Punk	there are gui clients for vnc (its just a protocol), about server guis i am not sure there is
2009-03-01T15:40:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	user____	ok well i have a remote desktop program (gui client) i think it was default with ubuntu, but im more concerned about the gui server
