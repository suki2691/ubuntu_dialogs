2010-11-04T04:52:00.000Z	psycho23		Is the firefox that can be installed via "the menu" on 10.04 does it come with Add-ons already installed?
2010-11-04T04:52:00.000Z	jrib	psycho23	what addons do you want?
2010-11-04T04:53:00.000Z	psycho23	jrib	well it's not that, it's just...the way Ubuntu's firefox opens new tabs right beside each other is a feature that I want to add to Debian's iceweasel, and I don't know how Ubuntu added that feature.
2010-11-04T04:54:00.000Z	jrib	psycho23	maybe #firefox can help you better.  There's an ubuntu add-on but I think it's mainly for plug-in installation and apt-integration
