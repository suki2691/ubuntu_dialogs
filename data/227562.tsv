2006-01-09T13:54:00.000Z	leemoreau		Hey guys, is KDE or Gnome typically faster?  I have a old P2 400mhz with 32mb video and 400mb ram running Ubuntu.  I find it runs fast but its just switching windows and such that's slow.  Curious if KDE is any faster or if there's a better WM to use....

2006-01-09T13:59:00.000Z	Jowi	leemoreau	installed ubuntu on a VERY lowend p166 with 128mb ram the other day. go with the server install and then add what you need to minimise disk waste. go with a light wm. icewm is fast and use very low amount of ram
