2010-06-18T11:03:00.000Z	tripelb		Just in case you didnt know these _Bogus_ qualities of being on Ubuntu - I'd like to announce that chrome with some quantity of tabs loses audio and must be closed and restarted. (bogus).  Also Firefox plays one Daily Show Video and after that it's Audio with a Blank-White Screen.  (tripelb makes rude noises) If you have that experience you might report it. I'm too busy trying to make my system work... hard and soft and wet: been a year now.
