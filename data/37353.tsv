2010-02-28T16:19:00.000Z	linuxpjc780	Slart	- so then why is it saying it has found viruses?
2010-02-28T16:20:00.000Z	Slart	linuxpjc780	because it has? read what I wrote again..
2010-02-28T16:23:00.000Z	Slart	linuxpjc780	clam is mostly for searching for windows viruses.. there are very few, if any, linux viruses going around... so.. if you run clam on your linux machine and scans, for example, an external drive that is infected with a windows virus (from dualbooting or something like that) it will tell you that is has found a virus.. does this mean your linux machine is infected? no
