2011-05-30T06:52:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kescc	please, you mean the "Super" key (bad name in my opinion)
2011-05-30T06:53:00.000Z	kescc	ZykoticK9	yeah Super L, but the button has that Windows logo on nearly every keyboard that is
2011-05-30T06:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	kescc	oh I know what you mean.  In Gnu/Linux world we call it the "Super Key" instead of "Windows Key".
