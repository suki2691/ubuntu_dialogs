2010-05-01T12:04:00.000Z	hsr	PythonPup	ther is no such problem, it does shutdown properly
2010-05-01T12:05:00.000Z	PythonPup	hsr	You say it shuts down properly and you may think that.  But, it probably is not.  The check only happens for two reasons.  One, is the disk was not marked as having been shut down properly.  Second is after a configurable number of boots, it checks.  This number is usually 30 boots.(Maybe 40, that's from memory)
