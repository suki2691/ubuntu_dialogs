I'm running kubuntu 7.04, and i have a problem. i want to copy some files from my friend's vista business pc to mine, and have spent about 4 hours, but to no avail. so, i'm going to try it from kubuntu, and was hoping that somebody could tell me where to start. i'm connected directly through an ethernet cable, and he's configure his for open file sharing. thanks in advance
