2007-04-15T15:43:00.000Z	Nubbie	Geoffrey2	why do you want a ram disk?
2007-04-15T15:48:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	Nubbie	short answer, I have an .img file that should be written to a floppy with dd...but this computer doesn't have a floppy drive...trying to find some way to "burn" it to, well, I guess you could call it a virtual floppy.....
2007-04-15T15:49:00.000Z	Nubbie	Geoffrey2	that is really unnecessary. why not just transfer the file to a computer that does have a floppy?
