2006-07-04T09:28:00.000Z	Tonren	snoops	I know, I know.  But I'm lazy!  Besides, I built 1.4.0 from source and it crashed all the freaking time.
2006-07-08T11:40:00.000Z	snoops	Tonren	because it takes millions of operations to redraw every pixel and find the pixels behind the one where you just moved
2006-07-08T11:41:00.000Z	snoops	Tonren	not to mention all the services running, plus everything else - talking to devices, keeping the internet on.. the list goes on
