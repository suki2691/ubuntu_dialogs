2008-07-20T05:33:00.000Z	Flannel	JoshuaRL	Not with the way update-manager(-core) works apparently.  Tries to use archive.ubuntu.com
2008-07-20T05:33:00.000Z	JoshuaRL	Flannel	k, can he use http://packages.ubuntu.com/ and just install the .deb?
2008-07-20T05:34:00.000Z	Flannel	JoshuaRL	He doesn't need to install debs, he can use old-releases.ubuntu.com for that.  But he'd have to manually upgrade (which works just as well)
