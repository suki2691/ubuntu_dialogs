2006-04-28T11:10:00.000Z	pmjdebruijn	deefzi	no, you absolutely don't, I think it might even cause problems
2006-04-28T11:11:00.000Z	deefzi	pmjdebruijn	that's what i thought too, because it whined about that yesterday. but i didn't even get X running so it made me think for a second
2006-04-28T11:11:00.000Z	deefzi	pmjdebruijn	so, i don't need to compile "support for frame buffer devices" into my kernel, right?
