2007-12-23T03:44:00.000Z	vincenz		Hello, so I was upgrading my system from LTS to gutsy, since I installed a new hd.  Everything works now, ncluding wifi.  HOWEVER, gnome is acting really strange.  So I log in gdm, and gnome starts, it flashes the bars a ew times and then nothing is shown except for the background, and my hd goes into very ihgh active mode.  I've rebooted and it still does it
2007-12-23T03:45:00.000Z	vincenz		any ideas?
2007-12-23T03:46:00.000Z	vincenz		My system is completely unusable :(
