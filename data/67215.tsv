2009-02-01T08:04:00.000Z	dougztr	carpii_	seems like the 8.10 kernel is barfing on the hardware i'm trying to boot it on
2009-02-01T08:05:00.000Z	dougztr	carpii_	its a gigabyte board, sb600 / 790fx chipset with a athlon64-x2 and a hd-3870. nothing super bleeding edge, some of the pci cards aren't super well supported
2009-02-01T08:07:00.000Z	dougztr	carpii_	well its got 8G ram...
