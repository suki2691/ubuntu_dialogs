2009-02-09T06:42:00.000Z	drash	freazer	have you read through "man dpkg" to check if there's a relevant option for your predicament ?
2009-02-09T06:44:00.000Z	freazer	drash	I just did dpkg -r -a and despite not doing what the man page says it does (it was not pending to be removed, it was pending installation) dpkg --configure -a is now saying nothing - which is what I wanted, thanks
