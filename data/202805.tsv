2006-10-08T13:39:00.000Z	Normal		I had 1152x768 last night(my native's 1440x900, but i'll take any widescreen res), but when I rebooted, it's back to 1024x768..What do I do?
2006-10-08T13:40:00.000Z	faisal_d	Normal	did you modify your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file?
2006-10-08T13:42:00.000Z	faisal_d	Normal	can you check your config file if it does contains the correct res?
2006-10-08T13:46:00.000Z	faisal_d	Normal	what res are you getting now?
