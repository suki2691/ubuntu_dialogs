2010-06-08T22:10:00.000Z	ryann_	ulkn	how can I prevent this? or at least have windows 7 loader pre-written (so to speak) in the grub loader.
2010-06-08T22:11:00.000Z	ulkn	ryann_	does your windows 7 loader offer you the choice to boot other systems on other partitions?
2010-06-08T22:11:00.000Z	ryann_	ulkn	nope, straight into windows 7.
