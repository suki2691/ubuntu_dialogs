2008-11-07T22:49:00.000Z	Ximal		Can any op here help me with an issue that comes with an untimely find that someone has used some kind of logger or rootkit to get my private information...  I need to figure out how to scan for the kit or trojan or possible "virus" ?

2008-11-07T23:02:00.000Z	ardchoille	Ximal	those are normal with rkhunter
2008-11-07T23:03:00.000Z	ardchoille	Ximal	not sure, but I run rkhunter and chkrootkit on every install before doing anything else and I see those that you posted
