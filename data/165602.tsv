2006-11-06T13:27:00.000Z	seamus7	defrysk	ahh .. I only thought of installing Fedora but after looking at screenshots for many other distributions and reading that most of the same packages are available and most use Gnome or KDE ... I'm wondering why I would want to leave Ubuntu for another distribution?
2006-11-06T13:28:00.000Z	defrysk	seamus7	believe me, ubuntu is a GOOD distro and make many others seem dissapointing exept for perhaps slackware
