2008-02-26T09:14:00.000Z	EnK		A freshly downloaded Ubuntu 7.10 - when botting with the CD, I get the option to boot Ubuntu, the progress bar spins back and forth, and then text lines begin to appear and it locks up at "running local boot scripts" and it never continues.  Any wisdom or advice?

2008-02-26T09:14:00.000Z	EnK	ka2	- was 12 hours long enough?!
