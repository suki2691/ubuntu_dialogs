I have tried using ifconfig up down as well as start and stop networking, and combinations thereof to no avail.

2010-06-25T20:14:00.000Z	Gwar	eoke	I do not think it is, because when i run ifconfig after, wlan0 is not up. It's just that after I put it back up, it hangs and wont connect until I right click the applett and disable/enable by hand
