2009-11-01T22:55:00.000Z	Shikaku	SporkWitch	i am dual booting vista and ubuntu 9.10 right now
2009-11-01T22:56:00.000Z	SporkWitch	Shikaku	kk, and vista didn't give any trouble afterwards?  I just remember a couple years back there was a lot of talk about Vista rewriting the MBR to prevent dual-booting of non-MS operating systems for "security reasons" (linux, after all, is a virus, according to MS)
