2011-03-05T19:18:00.000Z	jwhisnant		i recently updated some maverick packages, then I had an apci problem which I fixed with a reinstall, but I seem to be stuck at runlevel 2
2011-03-05T19:18:00.000Z	jwhisnant		how do I change the runlevel at next boot to be 5
2011-03-05T19:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jwhisnant	 ubuntu dosent really use runlevels. - You mean to say X is not starting?
2011-03-05T19:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jwhisnant	 login and try 'startx' look for error messages.
