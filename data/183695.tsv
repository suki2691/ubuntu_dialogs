2006-08-16T10:09:00.000Z	snoops	allen	it is, it's either in multiverse or universe
2006-08-16T10:10:00.000Z	snoops	allen	it's just disabled.. if you want to go through synaptic package manager it's very easy.. you can also use a text editor to edit out comments for those repositories if you want
2006-08-16T10:11:00.000Z	snoops	allen	in synaptic if you go settings>repositories.. the dialog opened will let you scroll down and tick the repositories you want..make sure multiverse and universe is enabled
