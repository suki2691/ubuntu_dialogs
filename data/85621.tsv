2012-07-01T11:37:00.000Z	michaelrose357		Hi what packages should I need to mount an encrypted raid created with fedora?
2012-07-01T11:37:00.000Z	michaelrose357		or an encrypted raid array in general
2012-07-01T11:39:00.000Z	gaelfx	michaelrose357	not completely sure, but I would assume whatever software was used to create the encryption should be able to do it
2012-07-01T11:41:00.000Z	gaelfx	michaelrose357	so ask in the fedora room what packages anaconda uses for encryption
