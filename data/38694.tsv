2010-01-20T09:06:00.000Z	Morell		ls -d list directories?
2010-01-20T09:08:00.000Z	scunizi	Morell	although "man ls" says that is true. I just tried it and it doesn't show my directories
2010-01-20T09:28:00.000Z	scunizi	Morell	found it.. ls -d */ .. to get a list of the directories in the directory that you're in.
