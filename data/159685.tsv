2007-10-09T16:27:00.000Z	arcanistherogue		hey, I have a problem with the trident video drivers
2007-10-09T16:27:00.000Z	arcanistherogue		there are some artifacts appearing on the screen
2007-10-09T16:27:00.000Z	arcanistherogue		has anyone had anything similar happen, or are there some generic drivers I can fall back to that won't have artifacts
2007-10-09T16:27:00.000Z	h1st0	arcanistherogue	you can try vesa drivers instead
