2011-12-22T03:08:00.000Z	Octane		i remember back in the day there were many packages not available for 64 bit. has that gotten better?
2011-12-22T03:10:00.000Z	w30	Octane	I use a package called getlibs and I can run any 32bit program on 64bit machine.
2011-12-22T03:11:00.000Z	w30	Octane	you need a little bit of room for some 32 bit libs but otherwise np.
