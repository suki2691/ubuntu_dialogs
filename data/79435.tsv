2009-11-12T12:46:00.000Z	DasEi	Rods_Tiger	space issue ? how did you install ?
2009-11-12T12:49:00.000Z	DasEi	Rods_Tiger	so space shouldn't be the issue, usb creator >> too less space for the system /too big home maybe ? pendrivelinux does well for persistent, changing installs
2009-11-12T12:51:00.000Z	DasEi	Rods_Tiger	my usb did fine by always newest/maintainer version
