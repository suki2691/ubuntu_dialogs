2007-04-21T15:44:00.000Z	argesarg		After installing the ATI drivers the Desktop effects no longer work. I just get a message that says "The Composite extension is not Available"
2007-04-21T15:45:00.000Z	spikeb	argesarg	ati's drivers dont support composite.
2007-04-21T15:50:00.000Z	spikeb	argesarg	yes, much better with nvidia stuff.
