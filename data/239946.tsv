2006-06-10T14:30:00.000Z	meegaha		Hi all, need to recompile my kernel (new to Ubuntu) to get some things working, where does one get the source from? (and what's the difference between 'kernel-source' and 'kernel-headers'?)
2006-06-10T14:32:00.000Z	meegaha		I can't seem to get the most recent (patched) source via linux-source
2006-06-10T14:34:00.000Z	meegaha		and I want to recompile to get some things working
2006-06-10T14:34:00.000Z	nickrud	meegaha	I'd think you could, but try linux-source-2.6.15
