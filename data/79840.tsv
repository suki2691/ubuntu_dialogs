2008-09-12T21:02:00.000Z	kwame		hi, question, why when I ssh it takes around 5-10 seconds for the prompt to appear?
2008-09-12T21:02:00.000Z	Bandman614	kwame	probably reverse dns
2008-09-12T21:04:00.000Z	kwame	Bandman614	it's not that, I can do a nslookup my_ip dns_server and it resolves right away
2008-09-12T21:04:00.000Z	Bandman614	kwame	from both sides?
