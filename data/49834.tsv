2009-08-31T21:25:00.000Z	Makavel		Hi guys, I am running xubuntu and i am wondering what is the difference between gnome-desktop and ubuntu-desktop
2009-08-31T21:26:00.000Z	owner	Makavel	ubuntu-desktop is customized gnome-desktop
2009-08-31T21:27:00.000Z	Makavel	owner	customized in what way exactly?
2009-08-31T21:57:00.000Z	owner	Makavel	declare an extra function. my question is: does the compiler pick up the directory itself, or do i need to modify the makefile?
