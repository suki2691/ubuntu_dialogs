2010-02-11T10:09:00.000Z	rcamedialabnc		Hello I have a older PC with Windows XP a HP Pavilion a305w. I want to install Ubuntu on my PC. But the PC will not let me do it. Do any one know a way I can install it. I tried the Ubuntu Iso and Wubi. I miss Ubuntu and would like to have it on my PC. Also the Live CD does not work.
2010-02-11T10:10:00.000Z	rcamedialabnc		I download a fresh iso and burn it on a new CD.
