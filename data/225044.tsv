2006-05-14T08:04:00.000Z	paradizelost	baconbacon	probly not, IIRC, intel disables a lot of opengl hardware compatibilites
2006-05-14T08:06:00.000Z	paradizelost	baconbacon	are you using windows directx?
2006-05-14T08:08:00.000Z	paradizelost	baconbacon	there's your sign that opengl is off for the most part
