2007-09-22T06:19:00.000Z	khamael		how do I make the gnome x-chat program to show the userlist?
2007-09-22T06:20:00.000Z	tasmaniac	khamael	 use the non gnome one
2007-09-22T06:21:00.000Z	khamael	tasmaniac	that simple, eh? I usually run the regular, but the gnome one was installed here
2007-09-22T06:22:00.000Z	tasmaniac	khamael	yep it was that simple. (I thought geez this is pathetic until I tried the non-gnome one)
