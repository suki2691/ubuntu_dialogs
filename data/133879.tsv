Standard plug like for cdrom drive or one of the cables coming from the front of the unit which I *think* is for led lights, extra fans etc.  Or does it plug into someplace on mobo?

He has a 1000 gb (1 terabyte) sata drive.   What amount would you recommend for Ubuntu OS and what size for Home (likely the rest of space)
