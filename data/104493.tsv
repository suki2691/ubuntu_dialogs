2012-01-13T15:41:00.000Z	Bergcube		Yeah, I'm an idiot.  I've managed to forget my nick password.  Did three possible / likely tries at "/msg NickServ identify" but it doesn't come back to me...  Is there a way to reset or change my password?  (I know that strictly speaking this is offtopic. I have asked elsewhere, but don't get any reply.)
