2012-01-01T20:43:00.000Z	aaschez		I have dual boot OS - Ubuntu 11.10 and Windows 7 - on three systems; all connected to same network. Is it possible to access Windows filesystem while using Ubuntu when Windows session is active? If so, how?
2012-01-01T20:44:00.000Z	aaschez		acess remotely*
2012-01-01T20:45:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	aaschez	 try ssh
2012-01-01T20:47:00.000Z	aaschez	MonkeyDust	Yes, but how is Windows account accesible with ssh command from Ubuntu? like user@192.168.x.x when user is from Windows and command in executed in Ubuntu terminal
