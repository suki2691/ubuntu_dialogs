2008-03-02T20:54:00.000Z	Nibblyn		tutuxg: maybe... it reports that only while booting from floppy, not when booting from HD (after a fresh install... i`m not sure if i made the floppy well...
2008-03-02T20:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Nibblyn	SOme newer drives have a jumper that can be set to emulate a drive with 1024 max cylinders  (WHATEVER THAT NUMBER IS)
2008-03-02T20:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Nibblyn	It does not downgrade the drive, just tricks the bios limitation
