2008-02-07T22:50:00.000Z	bobbob1016	sixstorm	Depends on what new hardware you mean.  But the answer would be that companies don't make drivers for new things, and the drivers have to be made by outside people for linux.
2008-02-07T22:52:00.000Z	bobbob1016	sixstorm	The better phrasing would be your 8800GT doesn't want to work with Ubuntu.  nvidia drivers are usually good though, once they support the hardware with their driver.
2008-02-07T22:53:00.000Z	bobbob1016	sixstorm	Yeah, that is because the drivers have to be made by hand basically.
