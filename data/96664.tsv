2008-03-23T10:10:00.000Z	orksnork		Well, I've got a Canon PIXMA IP4000 that I just hooked up, grabbed from a PC house, worked perfectly fine, and after hooking it up, finding the right driver, everything seems fine...but it's printing things in the top right corner, as if the paper was 4x6 post card or something, even when printing multiple pages, it just uses the top left area and makes everything tiny
2008-03-23T10:10:00.000Z	orksnork		any ideas?

2008-03-23T10:13:00.000Z	ad_267	orksnork	hope you get it sorted out, sorry I couldn't help more
