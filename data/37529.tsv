2010-02-10T20:44:00.000Z	Inquiry		Hello everyone.  I'm trying to install NDISwrapper on Ubuntu 9.10.  I've tried very hard to figure this out on my own.  I've gotten so far as to identify my needed Windows driver, download it, get NDISwrapper, unpack it, and now I am stumped, thanks to that blasted youtube video.  : )
