2010-09-14T15:27:00.000Z	zamba		i've set up apache as a proxy for an internal web site.. the problem is that i externally use a dir name to access the internal web page that is running on the root of the server.. how can i "rewrite" the hrefs in the web page so that it refers to the correct path internally?

2010-09-14T15:28:00.000Z	tensorpudding	zamba	is this really an ubuntu question?
