2011-08-24T18:17:00.000Z	photon		hi. I'm on 10.04 LTS, I manually updated my kernel to 2.6.38-something. Synaptic shows that Canonical provides only updates until October 2011 for that kernel. Is this a bug?

2011-08-24T18:18:00.000Z	photon	Galvatron	it was the only .38 kernel available.
2011-08-24T18:19:00.000Z	Galvatron	photon	The idea behind LTS is also that a kernel will be updated for a longer period of time.
