2008-05-02T02:57:00.000Z	svl		how do I discover what soundcard my laptop has so I can effectively google for ways to fix it not muting when plugging in my headphones?
2008-05-02T02:57:00.000Z	svl		there was some command that listed all hardware on a system - but I can't bring it to mind anymore... :/
2008-05-02T02:57:00.000Z	maxb	svl	lspci would be a good first place to look
2008-05-02T02:58:00.000Z	svl	maxb	georgy28: thanks
