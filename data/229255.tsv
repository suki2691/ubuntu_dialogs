2006-12-05T17:16:00.000Z	ThePancakeMan		newbie question - how do I install this VMWare player 1.0.3 application?
2006-12-05T17:18:00.000Z	ThePancakeMan		I downloaded it and extracted it into a directory on my computer.  I think it is a package but I cannot get the package installer to recognize it
2006-12-05T17:18:00.000Z	mwe	ThePancakeMan	don't do that.
2006-12-05T17:18:00.000Z	mwe	ThePancakeMan	use the ubuntu packages instead. see what ubotu said
