2008-09-09T06:53:00.000Z	TSCDan		Now... anybody know of any ways to get WPA Enterprise to work on a hidden network?  NetworkManager just sits there trying to connect and eventually falls back to my default network.  I know it exists and the card can connect because it works on XP.

2008-09-09T06:56:00.000Z	TSCDan	kousotu	That's what I was doing, manually entering the information with "Connect to other network"
2008-09-09T06:57:00.000Z	kousotu	TSCDan	no idea then, sorry
