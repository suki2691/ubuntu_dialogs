2012-06-26T18:20:00.000Z	Squintz		I'm trying to connect to my USRP2 (software defined radio) through a wired ethernet connection. I'm on Ubuntu 12.04. When I set the ip using sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.10.1 I get a connection for about 20 seconds and then it disconnects. Any idea why this is happening?
