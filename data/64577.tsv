2010-08-15T21:56:00.000Z	OceanSurf		 I recently upgraded to 10.04.....in doing so have I lost the simple Volume Control Dial that normally sits at the top of the screen on the pull down menu.....as well the sound is not on upon every startup...and the only way for me to turn it back on is via the terminal command alsamixer where I have to go to the Speaker and take it to 100%...it is always at zero upon startup.   How do I fix all this?
