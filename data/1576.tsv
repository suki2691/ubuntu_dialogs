2012-10-06T01:19:00.000Z	thufir_		after installing ubuntu server, I installed ubuntu-extras, but am still getting mp3 playback errors:  https://gist.github.com/3841172   are the codes installed?
2012-10-06T01:21:00.000Z	thufir_		pardon, I actually see that vlc plays mp3's fine, while gnome-mplayer gives:  https://gist.github.com/3841172   so it's not codecs or drivers.

2012-10-06T01:23:00.000Z	thufir_	Scunizi	I have extras, and vlc plays fine.  so why not mplayer?  I'll install lame, but why?
