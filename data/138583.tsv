2007-08-22T12:37:00.000Z	Vlet	magnetron	10, 20 megs... sql backups
2007-08-22T12:38:00.000Z	Vlet	magnetron	yes, they can handle it, but it's very slow because they will load the entire file into memory
2007-08-22T12:39:00.000Z	magnetron	Vlet	loading the entire file into memory will make it FASTER compared to accessing it on the hard drive
