2010-07-24T01:06:00.000Z	Mead		anyone know how to deal with permissions?  I can't get a "file roller" to extract a tgz file into a ext2 partition.  Using ubunti 9.10 live
2010-07-24T01:06:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	Mead	do you have permissions to write on that partition?
2010-07-24T01:07:00.000Z	Mead	s3r3n1t7	I am running whatever is default when you boot off a live CD
2010-07-24T01:09:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	Mead	means you do not have permissions to write on your newly created disk. Do as bastid_raZor told you.
