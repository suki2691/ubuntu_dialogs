2007-02-10T10:11:00.000Z	KermitJr		I'm wondering... How do I stop a macro once it starts playing? ie... how to interrupt?
2007-02-10T10:12:00.000Z	variant	KermitJr	you mean in openoffice?
2007-02-10T10:15:00.000Z	variant	KermitJr	never used those.. if it's a command line program youc an stop it with ctrl z. use "jobs" command to list currently paused jobs and %# to start a specific job. if there is only one job just run "%" on it's own
