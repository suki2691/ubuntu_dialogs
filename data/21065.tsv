2011-05-06T16:26:00.000Z	novitololo		I'm trying to move /home into a new partition.. What's the command that will copy everything from /home to /mnt/newhome?
2011-05-06T16:28:00.000Z	beli	novitololo	man cp --> cp -R ------------> but take care of files in use/cache for /home ....you want to do that maybe in single user mode
2011-05-06T16:28:00.000Z	novitololo	beli	cp -R is going to copy hardlinks/softlinks too'
2011-05-06T16:29:00.000Z	beli	novitololo	read the manual...you can define it
