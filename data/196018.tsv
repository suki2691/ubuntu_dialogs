2006-07-09T16:03:00.000Z	Arokh		can anyone help me out with partitioning for ubuntu? I want to make the permanent switch from xp to ubuntu (no dual boot), so I imagine I can't use ntfs partitions right? whats the size limit on fat32?
2006-07-09T16:04:00.000Z	Arokh		ok whats the size limit on a ext3 partition?
2006-07-09T16:06:00.000Z	Arokh		oh ok cool. Now my last question, i'm putting all my crap on a 200gb external hdd, which will be formatted with NTFS. can ubuntu mount that to read/write files for after everything is installed?
