2008-07-19T18:48:00.000Z	milligan		I've got the dual screen working .. nvidia-settings is a very nice util. What does seem a bit strange though, is that one of the monitors is very slow loading the graphics .. i.e it seems like there's a delay before the Applications menu pops down... Any idea what might be causing that ?

2008-07-19T18:53:00.000Z	candive	milligan	just the right side buttons
