2011-03-01T09:47:00.000Z	AK|lt		Was it a bad idea to use dd to write an Ubuntu .iso to my flash drive?
2011-03-01T09:48:00.000Z	DasEi	AK|lt	depends which iso, a few only boot this way,if that was the question
2011-03-01T09:49:00.000Z	AK|lt	DasEi	The standard 10.10 x86 iso. Anyway, as I said, I seem to have lost the ability to use this flash drive. Gparted reports that it's all unallocated space but I can't create partitions or partition tables
2011-03-01T10:20:00.000Z	DasEi	AK|lt	and if it was sdb, stick with it ;-)
