2008-11-18T15:41:00.000Z	fde	Pavlz	umm, so what does winrpt do?
2008-11-18T15:44:00.000Z	fde	Pavlz	are you going to answer my question, or do you expect us to track down that software, and figure out what it does ourselves? Many here haven't used Windows in a long time.
2008-11-18T15:46:00.000Z	fde	Pavlz	based on that, I know of nothing... see if it'll work with wine  :/
