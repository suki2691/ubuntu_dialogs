2009-12-26T20:21:00.000Z	adalal	Bohemian	you can have an encrypted home folder
2009-12-26T20:21:00.000Z	Bohemian	adalal	do i do that at startup? or do i have to install that later?
2009-12-26T20:22:00.000Z	adalal	Bohemian	that is typically installed while installing ubuntu, although im sure they're guides out there to help you out on google
