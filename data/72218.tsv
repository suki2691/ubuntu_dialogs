2008-12-03T23:12:00.000Z	YerikY		Can someone help me login to gnome? I have to use the failsafe option to do it now. the following errir is in .xsessions-errors Executing /usr/bin/gnome-session failed, will try to run x-terminal-emulator
2008-12-03T23:14:00.000Z	YerikY		Is my problem too hard to solve? Should I just reinstall ubuntu? My problem is that I can't login to gnome without the failsafe session
2008-12-03T23:15:00.000Z	sipior	YerikY	i think the problem is insufficient information. what did you do that you can no longer login?
2008-12-03T23:16:00.000Z	YerikY	sipior	I installed the latest nvidia drivers when this happened. I already tried uninstalling them, compiz, and did a dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
