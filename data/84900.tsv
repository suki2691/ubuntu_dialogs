2008-07-26T07:38:00.000Z	Entropy51423		Okay, thanks
2008-07-26T07:39:00.000Z	Entropy51423		I have been trying to get answers for two days, but there are logins in the Wireshark IRC, but they haven't responded ever to anything
2008-07-26T07:40:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	Entropy51423	did you try googling it?
