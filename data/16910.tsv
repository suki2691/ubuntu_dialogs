I want to install but when i get to the part in the dialog that tells me to allocate drive space, I see a full partition (windows) that i can't resize in order to make a dual boot. my only optins are new partition tale change and delet. how do i make anew partition to dual boot?
2011-05-17T20:31:00.000Z	aureianimus	laserbeak	did you choose the "install alongside windows" option?
2011-05-17T20:32:00.000Z	laserbeak	aureianimus	where is that option?
2011-05-17T20:33:00.000Z	laserbeak	aureianimus	i don't see that option anywhere at all in the installation dialoge
