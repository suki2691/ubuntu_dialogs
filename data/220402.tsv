I looked through several tutorials to set it up so I can boot from Windows (NTFS) but it just say that the selected partition is unknown.
2006-10-29T12:41:00.000Z	RalleAb		I have grub problems with windows.. I set it all up right.. but it wont recognize my windows partitio
2006-10-29T12:42:00.000Z	RalleAb		is there a way to install windows bootloader without having to reinstall?
