2007-04-11T14:07:00.000Z	maxandneve		I have an ext3 drive shared and I can access it from various machines within my 192.168.1.1 network. On my Linux laptop I can read & write to the ext3 share. But on the Windows laptop, I can't. I can only read? Any ideas?

2007-04-11T14:10:00.000Z	maxandneve	velko	because people leave and people join. I've left it about 15 minutes since asking last, and helped a few people in the meantime. I don't think asking again is causing any harm. And yes, it might well be Windows, but it might be something to do with how I have setup the share - thus the question
