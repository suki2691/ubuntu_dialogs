2011-06-07T06:02:00.000Z	thedrewsk	lapaga	is it always the same in windows and always the same in ubuntu?
2011-06-07T06:04:00.000Z	lapaga	thedrewsk	if running from a live cd it always changes in ubuntu and with a wubi install it stays (at least for a couple days) the same but in windows it has been the same for several months
2011-06-07T06:07:00.000Z	thedrewsk	lapaga	seems very weird to me. Are the address very close to the same, or are they very different?
2011-06-07T06:08:00.000Z	lapaga	thedrewsk	one is a 76.171.* and the other is a 76.168.*
