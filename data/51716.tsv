2010-01-19T00:45:00.000Z	Pixar		Hey, should I use Deluge in gnome instead of ktorrent? since ktorrent is made for kde, i should get better performance if i'm seeding like ~200 permanent torrents, right?
2010-01-19T00:45:00.000Z	Pixar		I'm looking for best performance
2010-01-19T00:46:00.000Z	Pixar		Allright, thanks
