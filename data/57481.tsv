2010-05-03T03:58:00.000Z	lfaraone	kmdm	I beleive it is, but I'm not sure.
2010-05-03T03:59:00.000Z	lfaraone	kmdm	what mirror are you using?
2010-05-03T04:00:00.000Z	kmdm	lfaraone	darolu: de.archive... (german colocated server)... do-release-upgrade doesn't work but do-release-upgrade -d does... wonder if someone forgot to throw a switch ;)
