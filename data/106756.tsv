2010-04-03T18:55:00.000Z	crs		Hi there chaps. I am having wireless connection problems with my AR2413 using ath5k and networkmanager ubuntu 9.10. Network works very well until some point then it stops working. Network manager claims it is still connected. While I disconnect it manualy it won't be possible to connect again before reboot. It will ask for wpa key few times but nothing will connect. On the other laptop (next to not working

I have tried to use madfiwi and wicd instead but I couldn't find any networks at all. Is there a known solution? It is being extremely annoying and makes laptop unusable. Please if anyone had the same problem to speak up. I have tried to google but found only exactly the same problem posted on forums by other people
