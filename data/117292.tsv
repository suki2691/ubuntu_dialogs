2010-08-26T03:25:00.000Z	Linnk		Ive been running WoW through wine no problem mainly beacuse it was a paste/copy directory (did not install). But i have recently installed games via wine FF7 (pc) and Ultima Online. The problem is when i try to start either of these games i either get a out of memory error from UO or a swap error. I have been on gparted and made sure swap was enabled, configured wine, and still nothing, any light on this would be greatly appr
