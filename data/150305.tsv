2007-10-18T19:12:00.000Z	Fracture		i've done a clean install of gutsy, and coppied my ~/.gaim folder across, but when I start pidgin, it doesn't seem to re-use any of my configuration
2007-10-18T19:12:00.000Z	Pici	Fracture	Thats because gaim and pidgin are not the same thing
2007-10-18T19:13:00.000Z	Fracture	Pici	yeah, so, I presume that for people upgrading from feisty, the upgrade will migrate the .gaim data into a pidgin format ?
2007-10-18T19:13:00.000Z	Pici	Fracture	I don't know actually :/
