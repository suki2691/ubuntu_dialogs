2008-08-17T02:28:00.000Z	dorito		I wondering if anyone could help me, I cannot use more than one audio program at a time, like for example I pause a video on VLC and go to youtube to watch another video I cant hear anything or the video wont load
2008-08-17T02:28:00.000Z	dorito		I was told that this might have to do with audio backends but how do you configure them so that every program connect into a separate one
2008-08-17T02:29:00.000Z	Pelo	dorito	I'm in the same situation, it has something to do with pulseaudio and alsa mixer I couldn'T be bother to look on fixing it yet but it 's probably covered in the forum
