(dist-upgrade will see if there are packages downloaded and in the correct moment , will install it , within the others downloaded , no ? )
2006-11-07T16:27:00.000Z	linuxwolf		so i don't have to use dpkg -i or so
2006-11-07T16:27:00.000Z	bimberi	linuxwolf	actually the recommended path is breezy -> dapper -> edgy
2006-11-07T16:29:00.000Z	bimberi	linuxwolf	anyway, dist-upgrade won't redownload packages, it resumes
