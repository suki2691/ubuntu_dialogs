2006-09-12T09:29:00.000Z	Morten_		I about to install ubuntu, at the language-menu, which of these should i take: da_DK.UTF-8 or just da_DK?
2006-09-12T09:29:00.000Z	Morten_		i = im*
2006-09-12T09:31:00.000Z	shreevatsa	Morten_	I'd think UTF-8 thing by default, or both (if possible). But I don't know anything, so don't rely on me :)
2006-09-12T09:31:00.000Z	Morten_	shreevatsa	i'll just take the UTF-8, and hope for the best :)
