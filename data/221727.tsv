2005-09-05T10:05:00.000Z	koneng		I edited my /etc/X11/xorg.conf file and messed it up and so I need to fix it, but I don't remember what it looked like before i changed it. I found a xorg.conf~ file in the same directory so i tried using that instead and it still didnt work. I just throws me to a command prompt when i boot up. How can i repair this?
