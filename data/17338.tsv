2011-03-05T04:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	tprowx	huh? "a native Ubuntu install would corrupt ext4?" what are you talking about
2011-03-05T04:12:00.000Z	tprowx	erUSUL	due to unexpected power outages, duh
2011-03-05T04:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	tprowx	well; in that case in wubi the ext4 filesystem is inside a file inside the ntfs partition no oaprtunity to corrupt ntfs afaics
