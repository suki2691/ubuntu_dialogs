2008-12-19T00:24:00.000Z	CharonP1		I think it's made to be too easy, there should be an "Advanced" tab for things like selecting architecture. it automatically uses the amd64 iso.

2008-12-19T00:26:00.000Z	CharonP1	Pici	Ok. I'll give that a look into. was just wondering if anyone knew of an aurgument that could be passed to wubi.exe that would change anything. thanks anyway.
