2010-05-18T02:54:00.000Z	etate	twoey	what i meant to say was more, learn any programming language that you like, and then you can program in linux... for linux specific things i would recommend following the freebsd manual (its not about linux but its amazing as a starting point)
2010-05-18T02:56:00.000Z	etate	twoey	also on ubuntu most stuff is written in python fwiw, but i would recommend starting with a functional language if you can (it will save you years of headaches down the road)
