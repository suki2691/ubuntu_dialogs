2011-04-20T19:15:00.000Z	kpettit		can you run default ubuntu gnome classic and gnome3 shell on the same system?
2011-04-20T19:15:00.000Z	kpettit		I tried it on 11.04 but it seems to be one or the other.  Can't get both to work
2011-04-20T19:16:00.000Z	rumpe1	kpettit	theroticaly yes...  but gnome3 seems to have the bad habbit to damage gnome2 somehow..
2011-04-20T19:16:00.000Z	kpettit	rumpe1	that's what I've noticed.  Maybe when 11.04 final comes out
