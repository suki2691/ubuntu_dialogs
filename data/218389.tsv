2006-10-03T15:42:00.000Z	rukuartic		I'm looking to move into Eft, and do a complete reinstall. I'm planning to just copy my home directory to a safe spot and copy it back once the new version's in. Any tips?

2006-10-03T15:44:00.000Z	rixth	rukuartic	biggest gripe... boot takes 10 minutes if you have mdadm installed (another grip: the new boot screen is pretty, but all it is is the ubuntu logo and a progress bar, it doesnt tell you AT ALL what it is doing)
