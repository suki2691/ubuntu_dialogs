2010-07-01T21:10:00.000Z	Iimitk		i'm hoping to upgrade from jaunty (9.04) to lucid (10.4). do you guys recommend going thru successive upgrades or remove backup data, remove januty and do a fresh lucid install?

2010-07-01T21:11:00.000Z	Iimitk	erUSUL	i have an NVIDIA graphics card, and i'm not seeing that problems associated it when going from 9.04 to 9.10 have faded away!
2010-07-01T21:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	Iimitk	that's why i said that is your decission to make. only you know what are the issues you may encounter ... or how hard is to backup data/configurations in case of a fresh install
