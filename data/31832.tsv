2010-05-16T23:42:00.000Z	Guest59490	ActionParsnip	i dont think so.. there is no dialog shown.. but the mouse-pointer alters pointing over text-entry fields
2010-05-16T23:44:00.000Z	Guest59490	ActionParsnip	i suppose that im not loged in already when i switch since i did not enter any Passwort but merely see the black screen with moveable Pointer
