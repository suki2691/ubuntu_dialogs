2009-11-19T18:04:00.000Z	spongebob	darksector	I think /usr/share/sounds
2009-11-19T18:05:00.000Z	darksector	spongebob	no i meant sound themes installable themes not the directory where they are installed
2009-11-19T18:06:00.000Z	spongebob	darksector	well, I saw an installable sound theme from the nanami madobe pack, but I haven't tried installing it.
