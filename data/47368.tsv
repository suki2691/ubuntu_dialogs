2012-02-23T17:03:00.000Z	wily		i have a really noob question. i'm trying to install something, and it asks for the path of where i saved it. i saved it in the "home folder"... ie  mv <path_where_you_saved_it>patch-hidd-3.19-pabr3
2012-02-23T17:04:00.000Z	wily		how do i find the path of it?
2012-02-23T17:04:00.000Z	theadmin	wily	Home folder is ~ or $HOME (or literally, /home/username/)
2012-02-23T17:05:00.000Z	theadmin	wily	It's $HOME, not $home (case-sensetive, Linux is)
