2010-10-14T08:03:00.000Z	soulwarp	AHemlocksLie	you should be able to just install
2010-10-14T08:04:00.000Z	soulwarp	AHemlocksLie	then again it's been a while since I installed it
2010-10-14T08:15:00.000Z	AHemlocksLie	soulwarp	sorry, afk'd a sec. I installed ndisgtk, which installed ndiswrapper-common and ndiswrapper-utils-1.9, but it's apparently still not gonna work. ndiswrapper still works as a command line command, though, which confuses me a little
