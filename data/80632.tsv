2010-03-12T22:28:00.000Z	ashmew2	graelin	thanks , but where does all of it start ? i mean i gotta start somewhere , sometime
2010-03-12T22:29:00.000Z	graelin	ashmew2	how do you mean.. it starts with you.. d/l the source and tinker with it.. or don't... but if you do, people (meaning everyday code stupid people like me) will love you more and exhault your name through the ages
2010-03-12T22:30:00.000Z	ashmew2	graelin	Thats more than an incentive for me , Im guna log on to sourceforge :P
