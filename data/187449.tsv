2009-06-14T23:23:00.000Z	mattalexx		I always buy my hardware at NewEgg but I'm not finding really what I want there right now: I'm looking for smallish (40GB) very fast drives at a good price. A bundle discount (3 or more) would be awesome.
2009-06-14T23:23:00.000Z	mattalexx		Anybody have a suggestion?
