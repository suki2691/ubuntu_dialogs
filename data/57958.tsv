2010-02-26T00:45:00.000Z	fccf	blakkheim	if you use a fingerprint it is more secure than a bank vault
2010-02-26T00:46:00.000Z	blakkheim	fccf	using password authentication on the default port with the default ciphers is secure? it can be locked down a lot better if you take the time to learn to properly configure it
2010-02-26T00:48:00.000Z	fccf	blakkheim	like creating a RSA/DSA Fingerprint which gets copied to the client... extremly secure... whereas, on an internal network, (provided no DMZ) it is secure because the router will not allow packets to the port from outside the internal network,
