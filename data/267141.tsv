2011-08-21T02:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest25825	 run nvidia-settings and see if IT says its in use.. if it says it is.. then it is. :) theres a bug with the other apps
2011-08-21T02:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest25825	 then its in use.. if it wasent. it would post a message saying its not  in use.
2011-08-21T02:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest25825	 thats a known bug.  saying its not in use when it is..
