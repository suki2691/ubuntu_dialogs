2006-01-16T13:53:00.000Z	mrice16453	_skbera	what's the parent pid doing? (if it's != 1)
2006-01-16T13:53:00.000Z	mrice16453	_skbera	also look for children pids
2006-01-16T13:54:00.000Z	mrice16453	_skbera	I didn't parse that
2006-01-16T13:54:00.000Z	mrice16453	_skbera	does the pppd process have any children -- they may need separate signalling.... is the pppd processes parent something other than pid 1 (init)?
