2010-08-12T01:46:00.000Z	arrrghhh	dirtydevil	you can if the case is different.
2010-08-12T01:47:00.000Z	arrrghhh	dirtydevil	but you'd have issues if a windows machine tried to see it
2010-08-12T01:48:00.000Z	arrrghhh	dirtydevil	then you can, just make sure the case is different.  if they're exactly the same, of course it won't work.
