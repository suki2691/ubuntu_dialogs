2007-10-30T08:31:00.000Z	Squalish		Am I mistaken in thinking that GpartEd would be used to mount his NTFS partition if it had become unmounted somehow? Or is there another GUI way to do that
2007-10-30T08:31:00.000Z	Squalish		surely there's a console method as well

2007-10-30T08:33:00.000Z	burner	Squalish	nope... it's a different icon if it's unmounted
