2008-12-31T05:44:00.000Z	MAXI-MUM		i cant boot into ubuntu after upgrade new ram 2x2GB =4gb , vista sees them 3.3 GB i read it's a limitation of my chipset it can reed max 3.3 gb any way is there a way to limit the ability of the kernel to discover the amount of memory i need to restrict it to 2 gb only that would make me able to dual boot ubuntu and vista again
2008-12-31T05:46:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	MAXI-MUM	the 3.something GB is a limit of the 32bit address room. however, also ubuntu should see these and still work
2008-12-31T05:47:00.000Z	MAXI-MUM	zsquareplusc	no it dont boot it reach the gdm and blank just before gdm i think before X
