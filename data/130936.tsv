2007-08-26T08:12:00.000Z	Johto	inet_dude	last time i compiled my own kernel, couple years ago, modules was compiled and installed with commands "make modules" and "make modules install"
2007-08-26T08:12:00.000Z	inet_dude	rexy_	I do need to. I need some adsl modem driver to be installed. It requires that I get the kernel source and boot from the kernel.  and i am not sure whether I should use the ueagle driver provided in the kernel
2007-08-26T08:12:00.000Z	Johto	inet_dude	i bet the way kernel is compiled nowadays is easier...
