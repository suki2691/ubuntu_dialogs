2007-03-06T10:27:00.000Z	MrEgg964		Hi. I'm trying to install vmplayer from automatix. I'm stuck at the user end agreement : at the end of it there's <OK> but I can't click it to have the installation resume.
2007-03-06T10:27:00.000Z	LjL	MrEgg964	since it's right there in the standard repositories ready to be installed, why in the world would you use automatix to get it?
2007-03-06T10:39:00.000Z	LjL	MrEgg964	is it a text-mode dialog or a GNOME dialog or a KDE dialog that shows the agreement?
2007-03-06T10:40:00.000Z	LjL	MrEgg964	Tab followed by Enter, or just Enter, will do the trick in some cases, but not in all. Adept for instance is known to have a problem with debconf dialogs.
