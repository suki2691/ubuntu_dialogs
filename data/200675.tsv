2010-11-17T02:07:00.000Z	ftg2	SlackRat	well, its fair to say the newbies on aren't on vi
2010-11-17T02:09:00.000Z	ftg2	SlackRat	thats a newbie opinion, no offense.
2010-11-17T02:10:00.000Z	ftg2	SlackRat	yes. saying nano is more straightforward than vi. definitely an opinion based on how much you use both editors
