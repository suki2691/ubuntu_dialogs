2010-12-24T05:06:00.000Z	StateFarm	magicianlord	3d drivers are painful, ubuntu is set up that if you really need a certain coded, it'll offer to install it for you
2010-12-24T05:07:00.000Z	magicianlord	StateFarm	yeah, but not offline. but, i found an offline codec pack for 10.10 and the nvidia drivers install just fine afterblacklisting nouveau and installing from recovery mode
