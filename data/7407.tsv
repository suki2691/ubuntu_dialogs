2011-12-17T18:52:00.000Z	siddhion		Hi after installing MongoDB I started getting messages like "The volume filesystem root has only 1mb bytes disk space remaining". Also, Google Chrome stopped working. Now when I start up Ubuntu I get the message '"Install Problem: The configuration defaults for Gnome Power Manager have not been installed correctly. Please contact your computer administrator."
