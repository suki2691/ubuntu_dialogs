2009-08-16T01:47:00.000Z	[lan3y]		hello i am about to install ubuntu 9.04 64bit, i want to have separate partitions for: /home /usr /var /boot and /tmp what size should i make these partitions? i have a 160gb sata drive.
2009-08-16T01:49:00.000Z	[lan3y]		Dr_willis, i plan to use a mixture of ext3 and ext4, this is why i would prefer separate partitions,
2009-08-16T01:50:00.000Z	[lan3y]		ok thanks
2009-08-16T01:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	[lan3y]	if you plan to use ext3 do a boot partition to avoid problerms with grub etc... as other pointed out /boot / and /home are more than enough
