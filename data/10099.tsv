2011-08-25T00:23:00.000Z	sRq		Need advice on PHP development environment... need to be able to work on win7 machine at work and mac os x at home... running Vbox now on hosts, but managing multiple servers is becoming a nightmare... any suggestions?
2011-08-25T00:24:00.000Z	BlueEagle	sRq	I suggest #PHP (and Quanta+ on Cygwin in windows)
2011-08-25T00:25:00.000Z	BlueEagle	sRq	What I actually do is to run an X-server on the box I'm developing on and connect to the server over ssh and run quanta from that.
2011-08-25T00:26:00.000Z	sRq	BlueEagle	im thinking hosted cloud dev environment..? know any cases of others opting for this?
