2006-01-18T12:56:00.000Z	fangorious	SweetestSavage	have you googled it?
2006-01-18T12:57:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	fangorious	no I didn't know that was an efficient way of finding packages, I will try that, thanks
2006-01-18T12:57:00.000Z	fangorious	SweetestSavage	well, it might tell you what that lib is packaged with, then you can run apt-cache search to see if there's a package for it inthe repos
