2006-06-12T09:24:00.000Z	JohnsonE		ok so say I download RAR 3.60 beta for linux. it's a .tar.gz, so do i need to unarchive it first or can i install it directly from there?
2006-06-12T09:26:00.000Z	JohnsonE		oh man i totally forgot about 7zip. might as well use that.
2006-06-12T09:27:00.000Z	JohnsonE		oh my goddd why is it such a hassle to figure out how to open a rar file
2006-06-12T09:27:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	JohnsonE	that's pretty damn easy
