2008-10-30T00:35:00.000Z	NightVision		is there a way to get ubuntu to copy to ram, then boot? something like toram?
2008-10-30T00:35:00.000Z	Slart	NightVision	you mean like run from a ram image of some kind?
2008-10-30T00:36:00.000Z	Slart	NightVision	or use a ramdisk for the system?
2008-10-30T00:39:00.000Z	Slart	NightVision	take a look at the live cd.. I think that's what it does.. it has to be documented somewhere
