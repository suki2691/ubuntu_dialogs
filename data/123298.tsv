2007-11-04T12:09:00.000Z	NForc3r		ok has anyone tried wubi 7.10 alpha?
2007-11-04T12:10:00.000Z	Evanlec	NForc3r	i would not use wubi if possible
2007-11-04T12:11:00.000Z	Evanlec	NForc3r	the regular livecd/alternate cd are really quite easy to use
2007-11-04T12:11:00.000Z	Evanlec	NForc3r	wubi is not really supported in this channel
