2012-07-11T17:28:00.000Z	somethinginteres	MonkeyDust	I am wanting to extract a split .rar file. I am getting a "CRC check failed error" when trying to extract in Ubuntu's default archive manager. Before coming here I google'd for a solution and the only suggestions is to re-download the "broken" part of the file
2012-07-11T17:29:00.000Z	somethinginteres	MonkeyDust	but Archive Manager says the CRC check failed on part 1 of 3 and 2 of 3. Looks like the download completed correctly but the file sizes don't seem right. Seem bigger than it should be e.g. 209MB for a 200MB .rar
