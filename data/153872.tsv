2006-12-29T06:23:00.000Z	neurotech		I'm considering upgrading my install of Dapper to Edgy using the "$ gksu "update-manager -c"" method - is it worth the risk?
2006-12-29T06:23:00.000Z	dabaR	neurotech	what do you intend to obtain by upgrading?
2006-12-29T06:24:00.000Z	neurotech	dabaR	I just want my OS to be up to date
2006-12-29T06:26:00.000Z	dabaR	neurotech	use sudo aptitude update&&sudo aptitude dist-upgrade to be up to date. If everything works, and you are afraid, there is no need to upgrade.
