2006-05-04T07:24:00.000Z	SpecialBuddy		how would I write the bash script so that no matter where it is it can write the source code
2006-05-04T07:25:00.000Z	SpecialBuddy		it's for class
2006-05-04T07:26:00.000Z	SpecialBuddy		I know I can go cat nameoffile but if I move the script how will it know where it is
