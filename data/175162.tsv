2010-05-06T06:56:00.000Z	mc_	facugaich	under Effects, the first option should be 3D Windows
2010-05-06T06:58:00.000Z	facugaich	mc_	Under "Effects" there's Animations, Blur Windows, Fading Windows, Minimize Effect, Water Effect, Windows Decoration and Wobbly Windows
2010-05-06T06:59:00.000Z	mc_	facugaich	hmm, ok no idea then...
