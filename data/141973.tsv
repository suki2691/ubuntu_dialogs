2007-09-01T07:38:00.000Z	VladimirBG		After a long while I decided to give programming a try, so I'd like to learn C++, especialy with ALP coming (Access Linux Platform), so, is there any GOOD online tutorials, and which IDE would you suggest? I saw MS's Visual Studio, and it's seems user friendly, anything similar for linux?
