2010-05-16T12:59:00.000Z	phil_		Hi, i'm a new user of Ubuntu. I have a pretty good level of computer knowledge. Ubuntu Lucid was my first experience installing an OS other than windows. I installed Lucid alongside Win7 on the same hard drive. However, recently, Ubuntu needed some updates. I updated, and now i have 2 different versions of ubuntu in my grub boot loader list. How do I lose the older one the correct way?
