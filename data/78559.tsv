2008-11-11T18:49:00.000Z	mick02	thomc	You're welcome. There is one thing that you should be aware of though. If you are using Gnome and you install KDE then you'll see all the KDE packages when you log back into Gnome.
2008-11-11T18:49:00.000Z	mick02	thomc	There is a command that will copy all the KDE icons to the KDE profile folder I just can't find it rifght now
