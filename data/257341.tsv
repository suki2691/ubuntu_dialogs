2005-06-11T08:21:00.000Z	chombee		Hello Ubuntu! I'm fitting up a really old machine for a small volunteer organisation here. The default Ubuntu setup runs too slowly so I want to try out xfce. I saw a guide in the forums about using some installers from oscillation. But xfce is in synaptic, is there a reason I can't just apt-get xfce4?
