2009-07-15T03:31:00.000Z	pycal	jdu	do distributions that are better suited to that have the same software available?
2009-07-15T03:33:00.000Z	jdu	pycal	at the moment i'm trying it program's viablility on a better ubuntu box.  Later, when I actually set it up, I'll use something much more light weight  (the laptop is only 300Mhz anyway)
