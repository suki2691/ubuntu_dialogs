2006-05-25T08:12:00.000Z	planetcall		I dont see many softwares listed to current version in repostitories. Why is it so ?
2006-05-25T08:13:00.000Z	planetcall		so repositories wont update with newer release of most of the softwares ? like Firefox, gnome, kde etc ?
2006-05-25T08:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	planetcall	not usually. There are security updates, though
2006-05-25T08:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	planetcall	every six months the new release updates *everything* - next release is June 1st
