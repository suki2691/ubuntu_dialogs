2008-03-05T04:12:00.000Z	benanzo		I have a script that I need to be run as root -- but I want a non-root user to be able to run it.  I want to give them permission to run *only* that one script as root
2008-03-05T04:12:00.000Z	benanzo		is this possible?

2008-03-05T04:14:00.000Z	soundray	benanzo	note: use 'sudo visudo' for editing sudoers in ubuntu.
