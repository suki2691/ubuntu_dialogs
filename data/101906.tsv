2008-01-29T01:08:00.000Z	L3ttuc3		then again, that's just my opinion.
2008-01-29T01:08:00.000Z	shade052	L3ttuc3	i mean a download client that make multiple connections and hence give good speeds!
2008-01-29T01:09:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	shade052	i was personally using d4x and flashgot before my ubuntu install died on me (lousy usb hard disk).
