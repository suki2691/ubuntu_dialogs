2011-03-07T08:32:00.000Z	birdinatux	paijo_	I want to serve my own website/email  with my registered domain name.
2011-03-07T08:34:00.000Z	birdinatux	paijo_	 the website is nothing big, just a geeklog blog.  Just want to do the hosting myself as apposed to paying for hosting.  I don't expect much traffic, just probably me and a couple friends.
