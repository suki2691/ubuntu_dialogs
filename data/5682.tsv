2012-08-11T01:49:00.000Z	pseudonymous		I have no ibus(mocz) support in my legacy QT3 application on my desktop. Any ideas as to how I get this re-enabled ? First time I installed ibus (via gui) it all worked. Unfortunately that broke by itself and I redid the install by hand using a different back-end(anthy=>mocz).. No more QT3 support it seems :(
