2012-05-25T02:21:00.000Z	NewWorld	niklasfi	 what do you mean by "attach"? pipe?
2012-05-25T02:22:00.000Z	niklasfi	NewWorld	i just wrote a startup script and now i want the output of the program upstart started for me. just to check everything is fine
2012-05-25T02:23:00.000Z	NewWorld	niklasfi	 "the output of the program upstart started for me" - I don't understand. Is the program called "upstart"? How do you mean to start output?
