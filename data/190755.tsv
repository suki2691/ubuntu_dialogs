2006-04-17T15:28:00.000Z	dc2447		I am using dapper and I am having problems getting a DLINK dwl-g122 usb2 wireless dongle to be recongised - it uses the rt2500 chipset.  None of the rt modules are loaded in my kubuntu install however even after that there is no /dev/rausb* device created - anyone assist?
2006-04-17T08:45:00.000Z	dc2447		Could anyone help me work out why my dapper kubuntu install won't recognise my usb wireless adapter - a Dlink dwl-g122 with a  rt 2500 chipset?  Any assistance in getting the kernel to recognise the device would be great.
