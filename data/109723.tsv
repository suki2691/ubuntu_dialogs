2008-02-04T10:08:00.000Z	MrObvious		How do I burn audio CDs from MP3 files? I forget how.
2008-02-04T10:09:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	MrObvious	insert a blank cd.
2008-02-04T10:10:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	MrObvious	if you insert a blank cd into your burner, a dialog pops up that allows you to open up serpentine to burn mp3 to cd
2008-02-04T10:11:00.000Z	MrObvious	jeffMASTERflex	I'm trying that now. :D
