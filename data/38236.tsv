2010-10-18T17:32:00.000Z	simar		hey my live installation in a pendrive is not booting up.. Is there a way that I can enter a recovery mode like we have when we install ubuntu in hard disk.??
2010-10-18T17:33:00.000Z	ViaNocturna85	simar	have you selected usb as the bootup device at the bios?
2010-10-18T17:34:00.000Z	simar	ViaNocturna85	ya .. the ubuntu boot and then the x fails to start
2010-10-18T17:34:00.000Z	simar	ViaNocturna85	so i think if i can enter recovery mode to do some tweaking..
