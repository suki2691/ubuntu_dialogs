2008-05-08T21:54:00.000Z	Mimi	IRWolfie-	 how are you mounting it?
2008-05-08T21:58:00.000Z	Mimi	IRWolfie-	 ^^ Sorry too many messages here -  So you go to file manager, and you see your usb drive(?) and then click it... nothing happens? Do you get an error message?
2008-05-08T21:59:00.000Z	Mimi	IRWolfie-	   Can you tell me what folders are listed in /media   ?
