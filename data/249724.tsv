2008-11-19T22:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tCzern_tux	 last i looked it was installed by default. but blacklisted.
2008-11-19T22:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tCzern_tux	 so it did not auto-load
2008-11-19T22:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tCzern_tux	 because most people dont need an extra eth## device for tehir firewire cards
