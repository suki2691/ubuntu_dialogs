2010-10-21T14:04:00.000Z	pmorris		Isn't it the case that cron spawns `sh` to execute its commands?
2010-10-21T14:04:00.000Z	pmorris		I notice that sh is linked to dash instead of bash now which might be what's causing it
2010-10-21T14:05:00.000Z	cousteau`work	pmorris	afaik it's been always linked to dash
