2010-09-30T21:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Okitain	 at one time (ages ago) there was a Ignore item in the xchat menus by default when you right clicked on a nick. but it seems over the releases.. they kept removing things from xchat.. (at least they removed the default settings that had the alias/features)   One of the reasons i dumpped xchat.  Try right clickiong on a nick and see if theres a menu item there now.
