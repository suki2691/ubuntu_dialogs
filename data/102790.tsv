2008-01-25T10:46:00.000Z	mystik	baz12	whats the motivation to stay with an old, out-of-date version?
2008-01-25T10:48:00.000Z	baz12	mystik	eventually i will not be able to run the very latest versions because my hardware wont support it  and things ten to get slower and slower as versions go on!
2008-01-25T10:49:00.000Z	mystik	baz12	i see, no funds for new hardware?
