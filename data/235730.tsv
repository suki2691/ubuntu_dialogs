2006-11-28T13:14:00.000Z	_ph00		now that is nothing short of absurd: I'm trying to generate a key for my 'real world' me, and my forst name has 4 letters (Luke) but gpg says it must be at least 5. I guess I could use the 'license version' Lucas, but no one calls me that
2006-11-28T13:15:00.000Z	_ph00		how do I force it to accept a 4 letters name? (
2006-11-28T13:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	_ph00	use your full name?
