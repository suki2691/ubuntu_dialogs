2010-08-28T13:19:00.000Z	obscure^		im trying to boot ubuntu 64bit off a usb drive, but ending up in grub rescue. I booted off the live cd, mounted and saw that it works. ls /boot gives me a list of files, but from grub rescue ls (hd0,1)/boot says that the dir is empty.. wtf? (i.e. any suggestions?)
