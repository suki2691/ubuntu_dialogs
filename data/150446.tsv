2007-12-17T22:16:00.000Z	Pici	RCOMALTA	you mean Ubuntu Server? It is just a command line.  You can install the ubuntu-desktop package if you want a desktop install.
2007-12-17T22:18:00.000Z	Pici	RCOMALTA	Yes.  The server uses a different kernel, doesnt come with a gui and also can install a LAMP (webserver) off the install CD.
2007-12-17T22:19:00.000Z	Pici	RCOMALTA	you can: `sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop`  FYI: there are no restricted (closed) drivers for the -server kernel.
