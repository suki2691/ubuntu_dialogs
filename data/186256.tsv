2006-08-12T09:52:00.000Z	squidgy		Hi.  For the past few weeks, the software update manager either shows "The list of changes is not available yet. Please try again later." or is completely blank, so that I can never see what changes have occurred in upgradable software.  Any clues?

2006-08-12T09:53:00.000Z	jordanau	squidgy	sudo apt-get update
2006-08-12T09:54:00.000Z	squidgy	jordanau	no.  I'm running Dapper, but occasionally new packages are available.  In the update manager, there is a "Changes" tab and a "Description" tab.  I can install new software just fine this way, but the "Changes" tab used to show changelog info, and now is always blank.
