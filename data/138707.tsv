2009-10-29T07:05:00.000Z	phibxr	z987k	try to switch to the main repositories instead of your local repository. some of the local ones (the danish at least) have been a bit dodgy over the past few days.
2009-10-29T07:05:00.000Z	z987k	phibxr	thanks, I'll look into that
2009-10-29T07:06:00.000Z	phibxr	z987k	the closest I found was "openssh-server" when I searched for sshd though. but, still, go with the main repositories for now until things have settled down a bit. :)
