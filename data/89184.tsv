2008-05-29T17:47:00.000Z	BezNalogov		Hello. I am installing Ubuntu 8.04 on my notebook (Toshiba Satellite L350. During the installation it says that no network card has been detected and that I should install a driver. I try to install from the alternate cd. When I look with lspci it says that it found a RTL8101e network card. What should I do?
