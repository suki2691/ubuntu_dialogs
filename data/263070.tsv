2005-03-30T17:11:00.000Z	declan		I've never used this x-chat thing before, so I hope it's ok to just throw a question out there.  Is there an easy way to shift my /home directory into a new partition.  Do I simply create the partition, and then copy the contents into it. How do I make sure that the partition is mounted as /home?
