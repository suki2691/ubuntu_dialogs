2010-03-30T22:10:00.000Z	raul		When I was upgrading my aMSN, the message "configure: error: libpng is required" appeared to me. What should I do?
2010-03-30T22:11:00.000Z	WhiteDawn	raul	run "sudo apt-get install libpng3'
2010-03-30T22:14:00.000Z	raul	WhiteDawn	I typed "sudo apt-get install libpng3", but the problem stills
2010-03-30T22:15:00.000Z	WhiteDawn	raul	you could try libpng-dev instead, but thats all the ideas i have, sorry
