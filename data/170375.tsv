2006-08-21T08:09:00.000Z	bobovski	dalfz	that's a little complex. I think the best way is to install mplayer and get the plugin for that. I'd love to hear if anyone has a better suggestion
2006-08-21T08:10:00.000Z	bobovski	dalfz	problem is, mplayer's kind of tricky to install...unless someone knows an apt source for it
2006-08-21T08:11:00.000Z	dalfz	bobovski	i think i saw a package called mplayer, or do you mean the plugin ofit?
