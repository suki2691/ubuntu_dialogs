2007-08-17T11:26:00.000Z	EDP__		I've never been on here before is there some sort of system or do we just ask questions?
2007-08-17T11:28:00.000Z	EDP__		Are there any known bugs/issues that would cause Wine to install properly but still not be able to run .exe's? Everything I've read on the net says that once you install it can run them automatically.
