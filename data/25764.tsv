2010-09-20T15:43:00.000Z	Peax		Is there a smooth way to generate an xorg.conf in 10.04? Having some annoying behaviour using two monitors when they are configured inside of Gnome, so I thought the xorg.conf would be a better place to set this up

2010-09-20T15:46:00.000Z	Peax	erUSUL	thanks, that did the trick :)
2010-09-20T15:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	Peax	no problem
