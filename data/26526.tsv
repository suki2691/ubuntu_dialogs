2010-12-28T20:01:00.000Z	Ianrr		I am switching all my employees to Ubuntu, is there a way I can give them "root" access but still leave an account for myself that they can not delete
2010-12-28T20:03:00.000Z	icarus-c	Ianrr	yes. and rather than giving them sudo right to all stuff, only give them sudo right on programs they need to run as root
2010-12-28T21:24:00.000Z	icarus-c	Ianrr	only let them to use sudo for the package manager
2010-12-28T21:25:00.000Z	Ianrr	icarus-c	how would I do that
