2009-05-13T08:24:00.000Z	h00k		I'm installing 9.10 on a friends laptop, he has the BCM4328 wireless card, I /cannot/ get it  to work, even if I enable it through the restricted drivers manager, I've restarted, I've tried through the NDISWRAPPER front-end package, (yes, the radio kill switch is set correctly)

Any ideas?

2009-05-13T08:29:00.000Z	h00k	pangloss	yep.  The card shows up in network manager, just doesn't show any networks
