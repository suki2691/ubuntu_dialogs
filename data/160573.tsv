2010-04-30T22:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dangson	Yes, many people have reported that. I believe that installing "manually" works (virtually boot the iso and install ubuntu rather than the automatic script they have)
2010-04-30T22:26:00.000Z	dangson	Jordan_U	thanks, I'll try that
2010-04-30T22:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dangson	You're welcome
