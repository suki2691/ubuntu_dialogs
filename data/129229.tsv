2007-07-02T08:54:00.000Z	shiester_mieste	Stwange	do you mean just copying files from an NTFS partition to a different partition?
2007-07-02T08:56:00.000Z	Stwange	shiester_mieste	I wrote the actual problem not long back. I want to copy images from NTFS to my linux partition, but everytime I try it says I need superuser or something, but when I try using gksu or sudo, they can't access the NTFS partition at all
