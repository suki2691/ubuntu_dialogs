2006-01-25T12:43:00.000Z	antisocial_boris		i just partitioned my hard drive and tried mkds.ext3 /dev/sdb1 but got an error because its apparently mounted
2006-01-25T12:44:00.000Z	antisocial_boris		why is it mounted already?
2006-01-25T12:44:00.000Z	Shadowpillar	antisocial_boris	is that your root partition
