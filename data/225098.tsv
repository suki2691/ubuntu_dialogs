2005-08-13T05:21:00.000Z	kaffeend		Hey everyone... I was hoping someone might be able to help me out here. I'm trying to run games and so far have had 0% success even with the Linux games I've downloaded like Enemy Territory. I tried reinstalling Windows on my NTFS partition, but setup says it's detecting system hardware but leaves the screen blank indefinately. I don't know what to do here... Can anyone please help me?
