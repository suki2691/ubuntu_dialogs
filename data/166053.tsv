2006-11-23T14:11:00.000Z	hydro		I have downloaded the Edgy (6.10) Live CD ISO and burned it to a few CD-Rs ... I want to give them to some of my friends who have been dealing with the pain of Windows. However, I am in China and they all prefer to use Chinese characters for the language and they speak various dialects of Mandarin. When I tried Edgy on my laptop, the re was no language choice for Mandarin. Any ideas (thanks cntb)
