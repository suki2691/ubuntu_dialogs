2008-01-19T10:15:00.000Z	arken		Hello, I'm trying to get help for my VMware in Ubuntu 7.10
2008-01-19T10:16:00.000Z	nickrud	arken	add   deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu gutsy partner   to your sources.list, sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get  install vmware-server  is a good way to get vmware on ubuntu
