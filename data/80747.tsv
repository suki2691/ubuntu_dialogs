2009-01-10T02:37:00.000Z	frog_		hi, sorry for beeing offtopc, but can't find a solution, maybe someone here already had this problem...  i have vmware. there is windows as guest installed. i can use ctrl+mouse click to mark some dirs + files  in windows explorer. but in one program i try also to import more files but i can't even mark them. i am only able to mark one. in manual is written, that i should use ctrl+mouse. but it doesn't work for me. any clue? thanks
