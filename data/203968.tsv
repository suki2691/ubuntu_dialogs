2006-01-09T07:12:00.000Z	tRSS		I ripped a lot of tracks from CDs a few weeks back. Now I can't tell which track belongs to which artist, songs, etc. Is there a software out there they can download or determine the song by analyzing the audio itself? I have heard of musicbrainz. Is this the software I am looking for?
