2007-11-02T08:31:00.000Z	james296		can anyone help me get totem-xine to work properly instead of using totem-gstreamer for playing DVDs? I mean I already got the Medibuntu package and installed libdvdcss plugins but I still cant play DVDs
2007-11-02T08:31:00.000Z	james296		used to work right away on Fiesty

2007-11-02T08:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	james296	Will VLC? It sounds like a xine or libdvdcss problem.
