2007-04-08T12:06:00.000Z	Ali_ix	yoz	usually as visits/hits, unless robots use true user agents
2007-04-08T12:09:00.000Z	yoz	Ali_ix	so my hits/visits is no where what I think it is..in terms of people right?
2007-04-08T12:09:00.000Z	Ali_ix	yoz	yes, unfortunatley most of daily hits is generated by spam bots or feed readers !
