2006-07-19T16:20:00.000Z	boga		I need advice on a Dualhead video card for Dapper. I do not do anything unusual save for coding. Thanx
2006-07-19T16:21:00.000Z	boga		I need a cheap one too. Should I go AGP or PCI?
2006-07-19T16:22:00.000Z	mjr	boga	I'd just get an ati 9250, supported by free drivers. Failing that, ati <=x800, supported by free drivers also, though only experimental opengl acceleration
2006-07-19T16:23:00.000Z	boga	mjr	thanx,,,is that PCI or AGP? Which is better anyway?
