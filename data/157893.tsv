2010-03-24T02:10:00.000Z	rokumanxes		Hey there.  I'm going to be making the full switch to ubuntu once 10.04 is released, and I had some questions...
2010-03-24T02:12:00.000Z	rokumanxes		I've got an acer laptop with AMD64 dual core, and I know there's 32 bit, and 64 bit versions.  Is the best option to get 64 bit or does it have any drawbacks?
2010-03-24T02:12:00.000Z	Slart	rokumanxes	I would go with 64bit
2010-03-24T02:13:00.000Z	Slart	rokumanxes	there used to be some software that wasn't available in 64bit.. but that is much better now
