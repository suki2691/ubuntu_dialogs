2010-02-06T05:58:00.000Z	Out_Cold	teddymills	multiple computers working as one
2010-02-06T05:59:00.000Z	Out_Cold	teddymills	would probably be good for CUDA
2010-02-06T06:06:00.000Z	Out_Cold	teddymills	i think that it's just used for huge amounts of processing that can be split with workloads... if you don't have a use, offer it for research.
