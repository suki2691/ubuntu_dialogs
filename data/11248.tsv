2011-08-03T05:58:00.000Z	semeion	OmegaForte	try inkscape for it
2011-08-03T05:58:00.000Z	OmegaForte	semeion	Yeah, I know.
2011-08-03T05:58:00.000Z	OmegaForte	semeion	But I use gimp for everything. It even does SVG's, PDF's, PSD's, whatever I put in it, it uses. So, I don't muck about with inkscape.
