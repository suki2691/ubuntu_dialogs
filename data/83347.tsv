2008-08-06T13:12:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	Jadewolf	You're ssh'd into a machine, and you want to start a GUI on the remove machine?
2008-08-06T13:13:00.000Z	Jadewolf	joejoecircusboy	I'd rather connect with rdp
2008-08-06T13:14:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	Jadewolf	Ya, no RDP outside of Windows......  YOu can configure Ubuntu with VNC though. Did you look into that/
