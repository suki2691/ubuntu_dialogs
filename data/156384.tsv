2009-05-02T01:10:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great		Hi. Just tried to restore a file from Deleted Items. But cannot find it! How could I find a file that I just supposedly restored to its original location?
2009-05-02T01:12:00.000Z	genii	gizmo_the_great	Try something like:   sudo updatedb && locate filename-here
2009-05-02T01:13:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great	genii	i know the file was 16mb. Anyway to search by size?
2009-05-02T01:14:00.000Z	genii	gizmo_the_great	Possibly, but offhand I don't know what command for that
