2009-02-23T22:17:00.000Z	savvas	JackWinter	if your current nvidia installation works, why to update? Unless you noticed bugs in games that don't work propely, don't update :)
2009-02-23T22:20:00.000Z	JackWinter	savvas	i just want to experiment and see if i can get better low latency audio.  but if it will break dkms i don't think i'm interested, since i change kernels every once in a while when testing...
