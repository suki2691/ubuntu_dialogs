2006-09-11T10:51:00.000Z	jbmigel	EpP	id just remove the live cd and boot normally
2006-09-11T10:52:00.000Z	jbmigel		iceman your 4000 card is already supported by xorg, no need for you to install anything
2006-09-11T10:53:00.000Z	EpP	jbmigel	i reinstalled windows.... it messed up grub and now gives me a error 17... so i cant get to my lenovo windows recovery.
