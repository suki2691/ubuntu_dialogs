2009-07-21T08:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sean5446	 try the alterantive installer cd' or perhaps a bootable flash drive made with unetbootin.. You did verify the iso files and disks md5sums right?
2009-07-21T08:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sean5446	 yes could be.. hard to tell.. and those shuttles are a pain to swap things out  of.
