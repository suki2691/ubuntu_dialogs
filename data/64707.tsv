2010-10-15T02:27:00.000Z	usuario		Hey. I've got a question. Does anybody knows how to disable the automuting of speakers feature? Ubuntu mutes my front panel headphones when I plug them

2010-10-15T02:31:00.000Z	usuario	ZykoticK9	well it's mutting the ONE I am plugging in, and I have to unmute it from the volume control center to hear anything
