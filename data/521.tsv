2012-11-03T00:13:00.000Z	randybo		Hey, I was wondering if I backup using the backup that comes with ubuntu 12.04 will it back up all my settings also? like compiz settings?
2012-11-03T00:13:00.000Z	bekks	randybo	Depends on how you configure it.
2012-11-03T00:14:00.000Z	randybo	bekks	how can I go about it so it does?
2012-11-03T00:15:00.000Z	bekks	randybo	I have never used that tool, I am creating backups with my own scripts, fitting my personal needs.
