2005-06-25T15:11:00.000Z	PlutoPrime	Bauhn^DH	you can't remove Grub if u need to boot to linux
2005-06-25T15:11:00.000Z	PlutoPrime	Bauhn^DH	you simply need to change windows to the default OS in grub
2005-06-25T15:12:00.000Z	Bauhn^DH	PlutoPrime	it does'nt matter if i cant use linux. i have 2 harddrives and i'm going to remove the one with linux (and grub) and replace it with a bigger. but when i boot up i get an error that grub doesn't exist. so i need to remove it
