2010-07-29T04:18:00.000Z	the_e		how is it that I added a repository but can't find any of it's packages anywhere?
2010-07-29T04:20:00.000Z	bobo123	the_e	have you reloaded the packageinformation, and you verified what packages that should appear by going there to that repository with a webbrowser?
2010-07-29T04:26:00.000Z	bobo123	the_e	I think you should normally be able to just enter the ppa-address in the webbrowser, for example http://ppa.launchpad.net/durmieu/ppa/ubuntu and ther follow the links to dists/lucid/main/binary-i386/
