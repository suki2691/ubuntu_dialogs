2009-04-26T22:07:00.000Z	Jampiter		I have a laptop with a headphone socket, however, when I put in headphones (or external speakers) the sound cuts out entirely and there is no sound through the headphones. Removing the headphones restores sound. How can I fix this?

2009-04-26T22:10:00.000Z	Jampiter	LadyBug	When I run Alsamixer, I have Master, PCM and Front at full volume and Mic and Mic Boost at 0. I have no microphone connected.
