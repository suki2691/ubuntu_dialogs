2009-05-11T04:54:00.000Z	JoshJ	Slasher`	the problem is that the Synaptic package manager is overkill
2009-05-11T04:55:00.000Z	JoshJ	Slasher`	i'd like to see actual applications and not things like filesystems etc like synatpic shows... and honestly i'd rather not have something broken sitting around this soon after i installed it
2009-05-11T04:57:00.000Z	JoshJ	Slasher`	isn't it generally considered better practice to use aptitude than apt-get?
