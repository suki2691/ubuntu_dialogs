2009-12-16T20:13:00.000Z	Dunas		Having a problem where 9.10 will not wake from hibernate, although sleep seems to be ok. Ubuntu 9.10, Intel E5200 @2.5GHz, ATI HD4830, 4GB DDR2 generic brand RAM, both keyboard and monitor are USB. It's always a hard lock, although the power remains running to the keyboard (backlight stays on) and I can see the wifi indicator on the USB adapter flashing.

2009-12-16T20:15:00.000Z	Dunas	Walex	I was kind of hoping someone had had the same problem and could at least point me to a temporary fix. :X
2009-12-16T20:17:00.000Z	Walex	Dunas	because ghybernation is a problem-free feature that is guaranteed to work in nearly all cases, and when it does not work there is always an easy fix? :-)
