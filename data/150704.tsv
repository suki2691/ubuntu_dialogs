2012-04-24T16:35:00.000Z	krypton		hey guys i am new to linux and have a question and I wonder if you can help me.....i have ubuntu but 2 friends and a few articles i read said that unity is not as secure as gnome so I google "gnome vs unity on privacy, safety and security" and then I notice on distrowatch when I do a search for security or privacy or fire wall they all have gnome or I386 ....so why did ubuntu moved away from gnome?
2012-04-24T16:37:00.000Z	krypton		and can i turn my ubuntu 11.10 into gnome?
2012-04-24T16:38:00.000Z	krypton		so the articles I read on google on unity vs gnome are wrong?
