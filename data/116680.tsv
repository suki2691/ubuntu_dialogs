2007-10-15T06:46:00.000Z	M_WS		I've just downloaded and burned Ubuntu 7.04 on CDROM but It doesn't boot up with it, my boot sequence is ok. What did I do wrong here (I do get it started in windows) ?
2007-10-15T06:46:00.000Z	soundray	M_WS	how far does it get?
2007-10-15T06:47:00.000Z	M_WS	soundray	it doesn't recognise it as a bootable CD and goes straight to windows
