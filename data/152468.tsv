2006-12-30T06:55:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	Rick_Timmis	I think hotplug isn't around either.
2006-12-30T06:58:00.000Z	pixelmonkey	Rick_Timmis	that's cool but iirc hotplug isn't used in edgy, or am I mistaken?
2006-12-30T07:00:00.000Z	Rick_Timmis	pixelmonkey	Sure that may well be true, however there is some further reading in Udev scripting which may or may not help you. I am afraid I am more familiar with base debian then edgy, sorry if this doesn;t help
