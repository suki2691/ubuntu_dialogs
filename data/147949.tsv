2007-03-29T13:10:00.000Z	shatrat	xX-ACID-Xx	like in firefox?
2007-03-29T13:12:00.000Z	shatrat	xX-ACID-Xx	well, there are themes just for firefox for it's toolbar buttons like back and forwards.  Most other buttons in GTK apps, most of Gnome, you can skin the buttons and menus and stuff with GTK themes.
