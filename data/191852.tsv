2007-02-27T15:13:00.000Z	Hellevator		I would like to view the source of the coreutils.  I did apt-get source coreutils but where do I go now to view the source?
2007-02-27T15:13:00.000Z	mooey	Hellevator	you should now have a folder called 'coreutils-$version' with the source in it
2007-02-27T15:14:00.000Z	Hellevator	mooey	lol your right, i had no idea that it would go into my home dir.
2007-02-27T15:14:00.000Z	mooey	Hellevator	it goes into the folder you run the operation from :-)
