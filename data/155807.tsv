2006-12-04T17:22:00.000Z	miika_	achandra	well, what lines i have to add to that conf file to get my network wokring ? following parameters are required: SSID=TAMK, network authentication = wpa, data encryption = tkip, eap type = peap
2006-12-04T17:23:00.000Z	achandra	miika_	I could be dead wrong...but i believe there is a sample file in the docs that come with wpasupplicant..so id start there first..its pretty extensive
