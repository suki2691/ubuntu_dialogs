2009-12-20T22:07:00.000Z	Slart	pe	I think hard drives are automounted in the later versions of ubuntu.. double clicking on it in nautilus should be enough
2009-12-20T22:08:00.000Z	pe	Slart	Sorry I'm not all too familiar with the terminology, but I want to access my NTFS-partition without using passwords every time
2009-12-20T22:09:00.000Z	Slart	pe	no worries.. do you have to enter a password if you double click on a ntfs drive in nautilus?
