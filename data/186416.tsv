2011-07-01T12:40:00.000Z	stricjux		Perhaps somebody can help me with my networking settings on my Ubuntu 11.04 - Is there a way to run a "ip addr add xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/yy dev eth0" every time "Network Config" graphical tool configures the ip address of an adapter?

2011-07-01T12:45:00.000Z	stricjux	ikonia	I've set a static ip (without any routes) in the "Routes" popup, but it doesn't seem to get configured properly.
