2009-01-09T00:25:00.000Z	zwobble		how can i disable the "start samba on boot" whilst still allowing samba to be started with /etc/init.d/samba start
2009-01-09T00:25:00.000Z	martin__	zwobble	the init scripts are for startup
2009-01-09T00:26:00.000Z	martin__	zwobble	why not copy the script elsewhere, and invoke manually from there? :)
