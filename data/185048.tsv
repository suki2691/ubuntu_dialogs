2006-07-09T05:57:00.000Z	dli	SonicChao	there's no need for ubotu to write that message to channel
2006-07-09T05:58:00.000Z	SonicChao	dli	True...it would reduce spam...it should say nothing when it knows nothing...you're right
2006-07-09T05:58:00.000Z	SonicChao	dli	In this chan, when someone asks a question, I don't say "I know nothing about _________"....that's a good point.
