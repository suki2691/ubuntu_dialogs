2005-10-06T11:58:00.000Z	levander	mwaba	you can probably find that easily in the wiki, but it's usually safe to install a new ubuntu release weeks before it's officially released (if you don't have any uber-sensitive data especially)
2005-10-06T12:00:00.000Z	levander	mwaba	you need to ask people who have tried it, ubuntuforums.org would be a good place to look into it if there's no one here
2005-10-06T12:15:00.000Z	levander	mwaba	yes
