2010-06-15T03:38:00.000Z	FireCrotch	tmas	maybe if you explain the problem a little better than that
2010-06-15T03:40:00.000Z	tmas	FireCrotch	I'm really not sure how to. Verizon is blocking incoming HTTP requests.
2010-06-15T03:40:00.000Z	FireCrotch	tmas	Are you sure they're not just blocking incoming traffic on port 80?
