2009-02-13T01:17:00.000Z	fedormorozov		please, if someone could help me, I installed Ubuntu 7.10 and my wireless does not connect to any wifi. It detects it, but does not connects.
2009-02-13T01:19:00.000Z	fedormorozov		anybody knows why could happen that? It worked perfectly in the previous version of ubuntu
2009-02-13T01:20:00.000Z	nanotube	fedormorozov	well, first an easy question - try the latest release of ubuntu (8.10) ?
