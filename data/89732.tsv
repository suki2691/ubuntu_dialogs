2008-10-19T05:41:00.000Z	[TiZ]		Okay, one more time. Startup Manager keeps changing the names of my grub menu entries. How do I make it stop?
2008-10-19T05:42:00.000Z	bobertdos	[TiZ]	How exactly have they been changing?
2008-10-19T05:43:00.000Z	[TiZ]	bobertdos	I used to have just 4 entries: Ubuntu 8.04.1, Ubuntu 8.04.1 (recovery), memtest86+, and Windows XP. Whenever I startup the Startup Manager, it changes the names of the first three to Debian GNU/Linux, kernel blah blah blah whatever, and adds a separator before the WinXP entry.
