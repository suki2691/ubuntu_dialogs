2011-06-20T09:34:00.000Z	AQuintero		Hi ...I'm getting this error in empathy: "RequestConnection failed: Message did not receive a reply" ...  someone knows why I'm getting this error in empathy ?

2011-06-20T09:51:00.000Z	AQuintero	astraljava	yes ... I was thinking the same ...  it could be a problem with the connection to the  "Facebook" or "MSN"'s protocol ... but there is something weird, I close VirtualBox and it worked ... I'm gonna test again ...
