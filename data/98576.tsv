2008-03-02T15:31:00.000Z	Tachdelan		Hello! I'm having problems with my ubuntu 7.10 server. I've got an ftp server and teamspeak server running on it, but noone can connect. I've tried opening the ports in iptables, but that did not help. I can connect from within my LAN. Also the computer was running ftp and ts server before on windows os, but I guess upnp may have managed the forwarding of ports on my modem/router. Is there a UPnP module for linux/ubuntu?
