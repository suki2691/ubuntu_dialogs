2007-04-01T06:07:00.000Z	satti		hi all:) i want to know how i can easily remove a PCLinuxOS install and replace it with Ubuntu
2007-04-01T06:08:00.000Z	satti		oh, that sounds simple. so it will replace my '/' '/home' and 'swap' partition, leaving my other two windows partitions alone?
2007-04-01T06:09:00.000Z	bimberi	satti	yes, the partitioner will allow you to reformat and reuse those partitions
2007-04-01T06:13:00.000Z	bimberi	satti	sure, but make sure that install works ok first ;)
