2008-09-07T04:09:00.000Z	zcat[1]		problem; my laptop has ati rage mobility chipset; if I boot up with an external monitor it freezes just after I log in. This seems to be caused by the 'clone display' setting, if I log in without the externam screen, turn that off, then plug the screen in, log out and back in, sometimes everything works. But something keeps turning 'clone display' back on. What?
2008-09-07T04:09:00.000Z	zcat[1]		what is the difference between sudo -i and sudo -s ?
2008-09-07T04:10:00.000Z	zcat[1]		they both appear to do -exactly- the same thing
