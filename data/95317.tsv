2009-05-20T08:46:00.000Z	Persi		Hi, need help with high CPU usage - X eats like 70%, been reading all the guides and it doesnt go away with .30 kernel and driver from crack pushers, yes Im on intel
2009-05-20T08:47:00.000Z	Persi		https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/HighCPU says The solution in these cases is to make the daemon stop doing the expensive polling and I have no idea what does it mean
2009-05-20T08:47:00.000Z	travers	Persi	say, what's your graphics hardware?
2009-05-20T09:14:00.000Z	travers	Persi	my guess is you don't have hardware acceleration and you're running something intensive... that would creat high cpu load
