2009-10-28T21:49:00.000Z	IHS_Volunteer		jrpg, odd. I havn't found a way to burn a disk with amarok from within amarok.
2009-10-28T21:51:00.000Z	timdot	IHS_Volunteer	what's wrong with mplayer?
2009-10-28T21:51:00.000Z	IHS_Volunteer	timdot	I use mplayer. I have a user who won't switch to anything that doesn't have Windows Media Player 9, though. I'm wanting something I can use as an easy transition. Something more like WM9 than WM11, really.
