2011-02-13T04:20:00.000Z	tehbaut		anyone know how to set gedit as the default text editor for filezilla?
2011-02-13T04:20:00.000Z	tehbaut		it wants to open everything in OpenOffice :\
2011-02-13T04:21:00.000Z	tehbaut		it gives an option to set a custom editor, but when I type gedit, it says my command is not valid
