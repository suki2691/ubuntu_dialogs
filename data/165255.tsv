2010-02-03T10:05:00.000Z	Fancycakes		Hey guys, I have some TOR questions.
2010-02-03T10:05:00.000Z	Fancycakes		I found a thread (rather dated) and followed its instructions to use TOR with privoxy and Firefox.
2010-02-03T10:05:00.000Z	Fancycakes		But how do I know when TOR is working?
2010-02-03T10:07:00.000Z	mrpink57	Fancycakes	I do not know what TOR is but I assume it is a process you can just type top in CLI and see all processes
