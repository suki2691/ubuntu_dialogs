2007-08-17T10:35:00.000Z	Myelin		Hello, is Gnome or KDE more suitable for 256 MB ram?
2007-08-17T10:37:00.000Z	Myelin		Is installing Xfce4 on Ubuntu as Xubuntu?
2007-08-17T10:37:00.000Z	dxdt	Myelin	I would suggest XFCE or Fluxbox with that little amount of ram honestly.  xubuntu-desktop is the package to do that or just get the xubuntu cd :_
