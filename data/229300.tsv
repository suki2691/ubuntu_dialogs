2006-01-27T15:50:00.000Z	blotted		I've just installed Ubuntu 5.10 (64 bit) onto my laptop. The install was made on a partition with XP, and all works fine. However, when I try to browse the files from Ubuntu of the NTFS drives, I get an error telling me that I don't have the proper permissions. How can I change that?

2006-01-27T15:51:00.000Z	blotted		psychotic: Because I have many openoffice documents I would like to load from the NTFS drive.
