2006-02-20T17:15:00.000Z	ghoulee	amphi	I'd prefer to have the keys print as labled, is this possible?
2006-02-20T17:18:00.000Z	amphi	ghoulee	sure - if you can't find an exact keymap for console, you can edit your keymap to taste
2006-02-20T17:18:00.000Z	amphi	ghoulee	eg. I have the thinkpad 'pg left' and 'pg right' keys switch VTs
