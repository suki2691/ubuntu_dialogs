2007-08-04T14:49:00.000Z	kane77		I repartitioned my drive (made windows partition slightly bigger and made linux partition smaller) with Partition manager (the windows program) when I booted linux it said there were errors and I had to do fsck.. so I did (fsck -y) for a while (minute or so) then I restarted, now my grub won't come back.. what is the chance my windows partition is okay??

2007-08-04T14:51:00.000Z	kane77	binarydigit	whew.. I guess it's okay.. not that i liked vista that much, but tomorow is marathon and I'm supposed to do the results and only program I have is for windows :/
2007-08-04T14:52:00.000Z	kane77	binarydigit	and I reformated and reinstalled ubuntu partition...
