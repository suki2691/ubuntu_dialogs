2007-11-21T09:04:00.000Z	sipsipclick	dwf_starband2	what device do you need drivers for?
2007-11-21T09:08:00.000Z	sipsipclick	dwf_starband2	i doubt that will work.  i used vmware workstation with my pickit
2007-11-21T09:12:00.000Z	sipsipclick	dwf_starband2	i don't know about server version but usb works with the workstation and player version.  wikipedia claims virtualbox opensource edition doesn't support USB, btw
