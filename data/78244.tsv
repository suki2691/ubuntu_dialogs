2008-10-02T23:20:00.000Z	harisund		VirtualBox creates its own internal NAT .. haven't had any problems so far, but it becomes a pain if you want to access the virtual machine from outside

2008-10-02T23:21:00.000Z	harisund	DigitalFiz	I believe you can do some stuff like port forwarding. Otherwise, I prefer VMware virtual server since it creates a new network interface
