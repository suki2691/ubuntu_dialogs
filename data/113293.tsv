2007-12-31T07:19:00.000Z	Toker		can someone help me with reinstalling ubuntu? I'm having partitioning problems
2007-12-31T07:21:00.000Z	Toker		shadown511/harrisony: I'm getting an Error 15 on booting - some googling gives some clues to the problem, but there appears to be no way to fix it without doing stuff way over my head

2007-12-31T07:23:00.000Z	shadowh511	Toker	you should do the same thing again
