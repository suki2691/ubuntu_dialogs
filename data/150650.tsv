2008-12-09T23:17:00.000Z	Pici	lasivian	How have you enabled the vnc server within Ubuntu?
2008-12-09T23:18:00.000Z	Pici	lasivian	And did you enable a password?
2008-12-09T23:20:00.000Z	Pici	lasivian	I assume that you left the 'ask me for confirmation' checkbox unchecked, have you tried using a different vnc client?
