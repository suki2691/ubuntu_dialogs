2009-12-14T06:10:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	ActionParsnip1	hm. i'd rather not remove the driver as "nv" has issues with my 2 screen setup.  i'll try nvidia-xconfig later (as restarting X would throw me out here)
2009-12-14T06:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	zsquareplusc	then remove the nv driver and you will use vesa
