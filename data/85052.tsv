2008-07-21T22:45:00.000Z	WahbeN		Greetings! Here is my Question: My laptop was left running all  night on a surface that blocked airflow. it overheated and the filesystem was damaged. The two partitions can still be mounted but the data on one partition cannot be read. What data recovery software do you suggest I use to scan for files?
