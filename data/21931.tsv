2011-05-21T21:57:00.000Z	Deddly		Internet connectivity problem - my internet connection is through a mobile phone (tethering) and it appears to connect fine but the only web site that works is Google, no other web site will load. I have experienced the same problem on several different computers running various versions od Ubuntu and Xubuntu but never had this problem with Windows. Any ideas?
