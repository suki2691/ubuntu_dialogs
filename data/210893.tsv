2006-03-18T09:40:00.000Z	Fawzib	CarlFK	I was asking  how to do a server-expert install in dapper? Only option in the menu is 'Install a server' wich does the 'server' install
2006-03-18T09:40:00.000Z	CarlFK	Fawzib	I think it is server-expert
2006-03-18T10:20:00.000Z	Fawzib	CarlFK	just so you know, to do the 'expert' installs press 'F6 (other options)' twice, it will show you a popup menu where you can select 'Normal/Expert'. Thanks anyway
