2006-01-10T08:09:00.000Z	moshe		how do I get mkisofs to generate a dvd-video image?
2006-01-10T08:09:00.000Z	moshe		I keep getting an error with the -dvd-video flag
2006-01-10T08:10:00.000Z	CosmoDad	moshe	I like to use k3b for that instead of fiddling with CLI parameters..
2006-01-10T08:11:00.000Z	moshe	CosmoDad	I'm "fiddling with CLI parameters" because k3b is unable to do this.  k3b is just a frontend.  mkisofs is refusing to create a dvd video image.
