2010-09-27T18:45:00.000Z	Strogg		I'm a debian user that is building a .deb package.. the packages requirements are very low, so it should install with no problems onto an ubuntu system.  What's the easiest way to give the package to an new ubuntu user to have them install it? Does ubuntu have an established way of doing this?
