2012-09-09T22:12:00.000Z	Markus_on_Ubuntu	BluesKaj	if I unmute the "Front Mic" in alsamixer I can hear myself on the speaker, but I don't get any access to my mic from any application.
2012-09-09T22:16:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Markus_on_Ubuntu	most applications for recording or hearing a mic thru them have settings in them that link to alsa , so look in the app you're using
2012-09-09T22:20:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Markus_on_Ubuntu	you could try pavucontrol , for input and output settings  , it should work
