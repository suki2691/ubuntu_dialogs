2009-02-24T08:23:00.000Z	Sal__		i'm trying to do "mount --bind /var/www www" but I keep getting: mount: mount point www does not exist
2009-02-24T08:23:00.000Z	Sal__		can anyone guide me here?

2009-02-24T08:26:00.000Z	Izinucs	Sal__	I"m not really sure what the --bind does.. so I have a hard time commenting on that.. what are you trying to accomplish with it?
