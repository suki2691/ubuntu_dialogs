2010-10-28T07:11:00.000Z	ilyekkakai		I have 2 hard disks in this laptop. Ubuntu and all my files are installed on the 2nd drive. Vista is installed on the 1st drive which is also the boot drive. I want to remove Vista and reformat the 1st drive as ext4 and make the 2nd drive the boot drive. I used gparted to remove all the partitions on the 1st drive and created a new partition ext4 on it. Now how do I get the 2nd drive to be the boot drive?

2010-10-28T07:12:00.000Z	kodemage	ilyekkakai	then adjust your bios
