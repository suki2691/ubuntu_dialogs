2008-04-25T22:30:00.000Z	tyrone		hi i have question. Is it better to upgrade from 7.10 to 8.04 or to delete my partition and install 8.04?
2008-04-25T22:31:00.000Z	XLV	tyrone	a clean install is always better
2008-04-25T22:31:00.000Z	tyrone	XLV	can you explain me the difference?
2008-04-25T22:32:00.000Z	XLV	tyrone	any old incompatible package/preferences settings wont mess up a cleanly installed system, where in an upgrade some of those problems may creap up
