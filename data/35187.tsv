2010-07-21T23:39:00.000Z	LucidGuy		After deleting a local account and blowing away their home directory .. the Lucid Ubuntu login screen still shows them on the list.  Any ideas how to clear?
2010-07-21T23:39:00.000Z	monkey_dust	LucidGuy	maybe the name is still in /etc/passwd and or /etc/sudoers?
2010-07-21T23:40:00.000Z	monkey_dust	LucidGuy	and ot /etc/shadow
2010-07-21T23:40:00.000Z	LucidGuy	monkey_dust	 not in passwd .. not in /etc/sudouers
