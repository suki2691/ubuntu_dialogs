2008-03-19T23:14:00.000Z	soon	dgjones	I tried to burn one a just 8x
2008-03-19T23:15:00.000Z	dgjones	soon	another suggestion would be to download a fresh copy of the iso and try burning that
2008-03-19T23:15:00.000Z	soon	dgjones	- thanks but I tried that 3 times already, 4 different cd's of two different brands, on two different computers (one a windows, the other linux)
