2009-10-10T14:03:00.000Z	iuri		hi there, i am having troubles to use syscalls on my environment. How do i declare a syscall in a C program i wrote to call a syscall i created. I already compiled and installed the kernel image with the new syscall
2009-10-10T14:03:00.000Z	iuri		i believe the problem is in this line _syscall(long,iuri,int,i)
2009-10-10T14:03:00.000Z	iuri		does anyone know how to declare syscalls
2009-10-10T14:03:00.000Z	void_pointer	iuri	try #c
