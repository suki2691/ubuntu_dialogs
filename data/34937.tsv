2010-04-30T20:40:00.000Z	jrib	chillindave	I think it's just:  <indent>1. first item<newline><indent>1. second item ...
2010-04-30T20:41:00.000Z	chillindave	jrib	Alright, thank you.  I wasn't sure since it's normally "#" and the examples are a little jumbled together.
2010-04-30T20:42:00.000Z	chillindave	jrib	Yeap, that worked just fine.  Thanks man!
