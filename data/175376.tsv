2006-11-10T13:28:00.000Z	dorto	nol13	depends on what one is looking in a distribution
2006-11-10T13:31:00.000Z	nol13	dorto	so is there really any difference really other than package management and defaults and stuff? does redhat really add anything into RHEL other than support or what?
2006-11-10T13:33:00.000Z	dorto	nol13	I see fedora's biggest limitation to be its package manager
