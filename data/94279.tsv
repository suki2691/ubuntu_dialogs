2011-12-18T03:52:00.000Z	bjrohan_		Hey everyone. I am using Blender in 11.10, which uses alt-RMB to select. when I do so, it brings up an Ubuntu menu for maximize,minmize close, etc. How can I disable this?

2011-12-18T03:55:00.000Z	Bert_2	bjrohan_	Unity uses compiz for its effects and bindings, afaik, in the settingsmanager you can search for keybindings using the advanced search option, I'd look there and give it a try
