2008-05-15T08:55:00.000Z	brianfreud		Total newbie question, if I may.  I'm trying to switch to Ubuntu.  I've created several installation CDs, using 2 different drives, and I checked that the md5 was correct - yet no install CD gets more than halfway without erroring out as an unreadable CD.  I have created a new ext3 partition that's 850 mb - is there some way I can put the install image on there, then use that to install?
2008-05-15T08:55:00.000Z	brianfreud		Right now I am running from the CD image, which seems fine...  I just can'tget any CD to finish the install
