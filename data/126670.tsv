2008-04-19T20:21:00.000Z	mechdave	Stev1	what have you done to it?
2008-04-19T20:27:00.000Z	mechdave	Stev1	at boot hit esc and edit the grub boot line adding single to the end, that will boot into single mode so you can fix what you have done
2008-04-19T20:35:00.000Z	mechdave	Stev1	you will need to boot into rescue mode and then in a terminal type adduser <username> <group>
