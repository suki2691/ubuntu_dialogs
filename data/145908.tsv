2007-04-19T12:43:00.000Z	Enselic__	mrpoundsign	if you don't need any particular Evolution feature, I highly recomend Thunderbird instead
2007-04-19T13:00:00.000Z	mrpoundsign	Enselic__	Yeah, me too, but I need to connect to this stupid exchange server.
2007-04-19T13:01:00.000Z	Enselic__	mrpoundsign	well, I tested Evo. for a while, but as soon as I went back to Thundeberbird again, I recalled how much better it is. Unless one needs exchange :(
