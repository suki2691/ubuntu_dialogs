2007-12-21T21:41:00.000Z	bundagan		i just upgraded to Gusty, i am noticing that python and pygtk seem unstable
2007-12-21T21:41:00.000Z	bundagan		is apt-get update; upgrade advised?
2007-12-21T21:42:00.000Z	mitchp	bundagan	you should be upgrading regularly anyway.  apt-get upgrade isn't any different from the icon that shows up in gnome.  however i dont know if it does an update first or not (I would think so)
2007-12-21T21:43:00.000Z	mitchp	bundagan	and i could be wrong, but i think it's always a good idea to do a quick upgrade if something's misbehaving
