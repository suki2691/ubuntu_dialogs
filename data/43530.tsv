2009-11-06T11:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Jacquesdupontd	Most of the hardware detection scripts that used to be in the LiveCD have been replaced by things like Xorg auto configuring itself at boot, so a normall install will work on pretty much any computer you move it to, just like the LiveCD
2009-11-06T11:19:00.000Z	Jacquesdupontd	Jordan_U	i would like to be able to install it on other computer and also use it as a personal os that i can move
2009-11-06T11:20:00.000Z	Jacquesdupontd	Jordan_U	that's why i need to keep this install Xubuntu directly option but also know how to boot without all the things we need to install it, it's easy to understand no ?
