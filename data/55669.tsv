I have libdvdread4 and libdvdnav and w32codecs and all that installed, but it won't recognise the DVD at any level. The really strange thing is that I have watched some of these DVDs befor on this same machine, ont his very same installation of Jaunty.

2009-07-12T01:28:00.000Z	Clooluss		maybe I should try clearing out the .libdvdcss folder?
