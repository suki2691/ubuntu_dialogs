2010-05-13T02:59:00.000Z	TrueBlue		is a 1.3 GHz processor fast enough for Ubuntu?
2010-05-13T02:59:00.000Z	blue_anna	TrueBlue	a pentium II is fast enough
2010-05-13T03:01:00.000Z	blue_anna	TrueBlue	I'm actually having a bit of sluggishness myself (not to remind anyone of a certain yogurt commercial) -- not sure what to tell you though
