2008-05-25T16:57:00.000Z	Slart	jonnymac	same for me.. the volume jumps up and down..mutes etc.. I don't touch it anymore.. just set it once using alsamixer in a terminal
2008-05-25T16:58:00.000Z	jonnymac	Slart	how did you fix it?
2008-05-25T17:00:00.000Z	Slart	jonnymac	I didn't .. I just don't change the volume any more
