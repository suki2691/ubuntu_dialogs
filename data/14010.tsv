2012-07-19T18:23:00.000Z	jtreminio		Hi guys. My Dell laptop has a docking station with 3 video out ports (DP, DVI, VGA). All 3 work great under Windows at the same time, including the laptop screen itself so I can have up to 4 screens total. In Ubuntu, I can barely get 2 to work simultaneously. The machine has an nVidia card with Opteron (?). Anyone have any suggestions on getting 3 screens to work?

2012-07-19T18:26:00.000Z	jtreminio	OerHeks	optimus! That's why I put the (?) because I forgot the name
2012-07-19T18:27:00.000Z	OerHeks	jtreminio	oke, i have no optimus, but please take a look at bumblebee https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee and there is a #bumblebee irc channel here on freenode too, those guys are up2date
