2010-09-17T05:22:00.000Z	mikeg3		I need help.  What's the easiest way to get printing going in an Ubuntu 10.04 VM on a MacBook Pro host with Snow Leopard?
2010-09-17T05:23:00.000Z	tensorpudding	mikeg3	that's probably highly dependent on what virtualization software you use
2010-09-17T05:25:00.000Z	tensorpudding	mikeg3	I don't know OSX's printer handling, but you can probably share it over the LAN, which would be the easiest way
2010-09-17T05:26:00.000Z	tensorpudding	mikeg3	I don't think so, but it's possible
