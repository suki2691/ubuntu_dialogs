2009-03-11T13:49:00.000Z	alexmac		I'm looking at instructions that say to : export VARIABLE=~/.something/something_else
2009-03-11T13:49:00.000Z	alexmac		What does "~/.something" do?
2009-03-11T13:51:00.000Z	baz	alexmac	also the .something is a file or folder that will be hidden by default since it starts with a period - usually for config/app stuff
