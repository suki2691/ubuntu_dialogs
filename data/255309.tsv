2005-08-01T07:00:00.000Z	Jelte		hi there... i'm trying to repartition and format a 512 CF card using fdisk and mkfs.ext2, but it keeps ending up as 473MB...
2005-08-01T07:01:00.000Z	micampe	Jelte	a file system structure takes space, that's normal
2005-08-01T07:01:00.000Z	Jelte		after using mkfs.ext2 if i then use fdisk again, it doesn't see any partitions and it says  Warning: invalid flag 0x0000 of partition table 4 will be corrected by w(rite)
2005-08-01T07:01:00.000Z	Jelte	micampe	that much space is normal?
