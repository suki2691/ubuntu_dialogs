2005-03-04T17:28:00.000Z	username		I'm going to try an install of ubuntu to see what it's like. Given a hard drive that's got ample room to spare, what would be a sensible size for a partition for root, assuming /home is somewhere else and already exists?
2005-03-04T17:29:00.000Z	pybe	username	the full install takes about 1.5 gb
2005-03-04T17:30:00.000Z	username	pybe	aha - thanks. So 5GB should be plenty.
2005-03-04T17:30:00.000Z	pybe	username	so it depends what else you want to install
