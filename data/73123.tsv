2009-03-20T22:46:00.000Z	juniecho		hi, how can i completely DISABLE hibernation? like, when i click on 'turn off computer' button... i see 'hibernation' option. i know hibernation does not work, because i've set swap smaller than my system memory size, so i don't want that hibernation option appear there... is there any way i can do this?
