2010-04-11T04:27:00.000Z	elshaka		hi there, i just installed a radeon hd 5770 gpu on my pc, i'm running karmic and i'm seeing some graphics corruption in the top of the screen, i tried both the drivers that's on ubuntu repos and the lastest one you can get on amd.ati.com, any suggestions?
2010-04-11T04:28:00.000Z	elshaka		english is not my first language so i can't find the right word to express the bug, "graphic corruption" is my best shot :P
2010-04-11T04:29:00.000Z	clrg	elshaka	Did you google "name_of_graphics_card ubuntu error" or something of the like?
2010-04-11T04:30:00.000Z	elshaka	clrg	yep i've been googling for hours, i'm still looking, just wondered if anyone here had any suggestion
