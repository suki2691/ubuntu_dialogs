2010-11-02T19:21:00.000Z	GH1234		Hey folks... I have a problem :D I have a file which name is encoded wrong, I can't move it using bash then I think because it says file not found... I can't delete it with nautilus either because nautilus crashs everytime I open the dir :D Any suggestions what to do to rename or delete this file? -.-
2010-11-02T19:23:00.000Z	herzi	GH1234	did you try something like "mv foo*bar foobarfixed" (where the * replaces the location of the encoding problem)?
2010-11-02T19:23:00.000Z	GH1234	herzi	I'll test that :=
