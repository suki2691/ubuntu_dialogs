2009-03-01T16:45:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	picca-	what do you do to set it? if it's a command then put it in /etc/rc.local
2009-03-01T16:45:00.000Z	picca-	sprinkmeier	i am using the cpu frequency scaling applet
2009-03-01T16:47:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	picca-	if you have the command-line equivalent of whatever the applet does then put that in rc.local
