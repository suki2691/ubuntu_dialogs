2006-05-21T07:45:00.000Z	minimec		Hi folks. I really need your help with dpkg. Yesterday I installed the mldonkey-server package which failed because of a dpkg --configure problem. Now everytime I use apt-get, dpkg or aptitude, first I have that dpkg --configure mldonkey-server sequence again, wich obviously fails again. How can remove that sequence, or how can I remove or purge that broken package. I tell you.. I tried a lot...
