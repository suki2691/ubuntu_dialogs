2008-04-24T04:30:00.000Z	Shpook		Alright, gnome-panel is really annoying me. I'm trying to add a panel to the bottom of my screen, and on every reboot, it ends up on top. Only thing I've found through google is trying to use ubuntu-tweak, but that didn't help. Anyone know how to fix this?
2008-04-24T04:31:00.000Z	odder	Shpook	for me right clicking the panel and choosing properties --> orientation --> bottom always worked...
2008-04-24T04:31:00.000Z	Shpook		Umm...no, but for some reason that made me feel stupid. :-D
2008-04-24T04:32:00.000Z	Shpook	odder	When I tried that, everything but top was grayed out.
