2011-04-28T06:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	digdeep	oh you want to virtualmachine Ubuntu 11.04?
2011-04-28T06:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	digdeep	I can link you to some proper instructions on how to virtual machine 11.04
2011-04-28T06:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	digdeep	actsaully I think for a virtual machine of 11.04, even though 11.04 isn't out just yet, this channel would be sort of ok, because you could be virtual machining it with a previous version of Ubuntu,  as host,  and you could with another distro as host as well
