2006-08-31T16:48:00.000Z	app		Anyone know how to boot my Ubuntu partition, when I can not touch my MBR? I tried a GRUB boot CD, but failed to find right commands to boot. Can you do that with the Ubuntu live CD, to interrupt the CD boot to some boot loader prompt and then give some magical command to boot Dapper from partition 2 of my only SCSI disk (IBM Thinkpad 60m)?
2006-08-31T16:50:00.000Z	app		(I can not toch my MBR, because my Pointsec encrypted Windows XP partition 1 will not boot from GRUB. Or can someone fix that for me? Anyone booting Poinsec encrypted Windows with LILO or GRUB or anyhing that can have multiple boots?
