2011-07-04T07:29:00.000Z	KM0201	VonhintenHOME`	xdmcp.. isn't that basically for remote desktop?.. if so, i don't see why it couldn't, if you install the right apps, etc
2011-07-04T07:31:00.000Z	VonhintenHOME`	KM0201	well, apparently it was integrated before, now all the dialogs for configuring the system for remote access are gone, and I can't figure out what the story is
2011-07-04T07:35:00.000Z	KM0201	VonhintenHOME`	where is it distorted?.. there's a couple spots of the video that were distorted, but not the whole thing
