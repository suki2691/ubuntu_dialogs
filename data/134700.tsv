2007-10-19T20:55:00.000Z	Ecnarf371		Hi there. I'm new to Linux, and IRC. I just downloaded and installed the new version of Linux, and it won't even boot! I don't even get to a splash screen!

2007-10-19T20:57:00.000Z	bobbo	Ecnarf371	ah i thought you meant the CD wasnt booting, so you installed gutsy and now it wont boot?
