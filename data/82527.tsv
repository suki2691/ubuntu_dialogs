2009-04-20T01:17:00.000Z	Hascal		Hi there. I need some help creating a boot disk. I am running a PowerPC G4 Mac. I have burn disks but I don't I'm doing it right cause it my Mac doesn't boor from it.
2009-04-20T01:19:00.000Z	Hascal		Lot of folks here... Is there a better place to get boot disk help?

2009-04-20T01:24:00.000Z	guntbert	Hascal	I saw that but I cannot help you with this. Please be patient and repeat your question in about 10 minutes or so, there are not too many with mac experience...
