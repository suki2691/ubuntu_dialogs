2008-08-04T02:44:00.000Z	Hovefirse		New try ;) I'm running Ubuntu in terminal mode, and tried to upgrade from gutsy to hardy with the standard commands: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade. Lotsa stuff happened when I ran this. However, the system still says it's gutsy, and rerunning the commands tells me that everything is up to date.
2008-08-04T02:45:00.000Z	Hovefirse		Has anybody had a similar problem?
2008-08-04T02:45:00.000Z	magnetron	Hovefirse	no! you do NOT upgrade ubuntu correctly by running dist-upgrade! didn't you read the homepage?
2008-08-04T02:46:00.000Z	Hovefirse	magnetron	Bummer...I must have messed up then. I found the above on another homepage that sounded reliable'
