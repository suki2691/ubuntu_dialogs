2009-01-09T14:17:00.000Z	terminator_		Anyone know when the Nvidia 173.14.15 drivers will be updated in Ubuntu.  I need this driver for my video card.

2009-01-09T14:18:00.000Z	terminator_	adam7	does that mean I will not have use of the video driver I need.
2009-01-09T14:18:00.000Z	adam7	terminator_	no, you'll just have to install it manually
