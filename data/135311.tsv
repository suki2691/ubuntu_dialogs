2007-05-24T05:15:00.000Z	haptiK		well thing is i dont have alot of money. i just moved to a new country and i cant afford a computer. i am using my gf's machine. a friend of mine i have recently made has this 300 mhz box. it doesnt sound like much but as long as i can do my work i dont care. i want to be able to run ubuntu without things hanging or having to wait for hours to load my IDE. 300 mhz isnt fast but is it sufficient enough?
