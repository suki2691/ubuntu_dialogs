2006-04-24T13:38:00.000Z	hartz		I just ordered 30 5.10 CDs and when they arrived here I had to pay import tax.  IMPORT TAX!!!  For a FREE PRODUCT!  and what is more, I imported it back to South Africa!  Ubuntu's cradle, and the damn government wants it's pound of flesh!
2006-04-24T13:40:00.000Z	FlannelKing	hartz	didyou explain to them that it is indeed free?
2006-04-24T13:41:00.000Z	FlannelKing	hartz	since, Ive heard about import stuff before, but people just had to take teh time to explain how the software was actually free.
