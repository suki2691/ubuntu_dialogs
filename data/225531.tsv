2009-04-27T02:21:00.000Z	Mocs		I am having problems connecting to ubuntu machine from XP macine with samba.  Attempt to map network drive on XP using \\192.168.0.104 (correct ip) says nothing found
2009-04-27T02:23:00.000Z	Mocs		anyone successfully set up samba so XP can map it as a network drive?
2009-04-27T02:23:00.000Z	Lorvija	Mocs	XP also has some probs on mapping as network drive (: so might not be 100% sambas fault
2009-04-27T02:24:00.000Z	Lorvija	Mocs	so you might wanna test if you can connect to any network drive with you'r xp installation
