2010-04-22T22:06:00.000Z	VirusTB	BedMan	 i think it might be beter if I just use ubuntu as a VM... since i am still a beginer to it...... or does Win 7 run well as a VM on Ubuntu'
2010-04-22T22:07:00.000Z	BedMan	VirusTB	I haven't done it either way.. I only have XP as a VM Client on win7 at home.  I use a unix box for unix :-)
