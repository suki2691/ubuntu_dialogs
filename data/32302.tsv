2010-05-08T02:57:00.000Z	Sgeo		I'm on an Ubuntu 7.04 machine. Is there a nice easy way to upgrade to 10.4?
2010-05-08T02:57:00.000Z	Sgeo		erm, 10.04?
2010-05-08T02:58:00.000Z	xeer0	Sgeo	To be fair, you deserve a warning. I've spent the last week on this channel trying to fix my server after upgrading to lynx. Take a full backup before you upgrade.
2010-05-08T02:59:00.000Z	Sgeo	xeer0	considering how painful it would be to backup, and how little I use this system, maybe I won't bother
