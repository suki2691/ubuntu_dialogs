2005-09-29T11:07:00.000Z	furic		I am wondering, when you install a bunch of programs to try them out, you pretty much allways have to install a bunch of dependecies too, but when it comes time to uninstall the ones you dont like synaptic leaves the dependencies on your system, just floating around being useless, is there some way around this bitrot?
