2008-05-06T02:38:00.000Z	FGS|Bret`Laptop		i am using a livecd to install ubuntu 8.04. How long roughly does it take to install? I've been resizing partition now on 0% for 10 minutes
2008-05-06T02:38:00.000Z	Daisuke_Ido	FGS|Bret`Laptop	the progress doesn't update in real time
2008-05-06T02:38:00.000Z	Daisuke_Ido	FGS|Bret`Laptop	it'll jump once it's done, and that's purely dependant on the size of the drive
2008-05-06T02:39:00.000Z	Daisuke_Ido	FGS|Bret`Laptop	shouldn't take too much longer, i would expect
