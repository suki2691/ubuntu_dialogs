2007-04-30T07:29:00.000Z	Koba		Does anyone else notice that flashplayer-nonfree downloads EXTREMELY slow? I am getting about 25b/s
2007-04-30T07:31:00.000Z	Koba		No one?
2007-04-30T07:33:00.000Z	Koba		Anybody know of an alternative mirror for flashplayer-nonfree? I started the download, but its going so incredibly slow, I can't finish the download, and I can't do anything until that frickin package is done...
