2008-10-10T00:31:00.000Z	morrty		Can anyone help me with vi and ubuntu? I've used vi with CentOS before but just installed Ubuntu Server and it doesn't work right.
2008-10-10T00:31:00.000Z	kitche	morrty	you probably need to install vim-full
2008-10-10T00:32:00.000Z	morrty	kitche	so sudo apt-get install vim-full?
2008-10-10T00:32:00.000Z	kitche	morrty	don't know the full path but I know by default vim on Ubuntu is a less featured full vim
