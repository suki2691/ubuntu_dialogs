2010-01-09T19:13:00.000Z	genstorm		anyone knows where I'm supposed to submit a kernel patch to the ubuntu devs?
2010-01-09T19:15:00.000Z	genstorm		it's not so much as a bug, it is support for a linksys wlan stick that was added to linus' kernel 11 days ago
2010-01-09T19:16:00.000Z	jrib	genstorm	you're unlikely to get it in, but bugs include feature requests, etc.
2010-01-09T19:17:00.000Z	jrib	genstorm	ask #ubuntu-bugs if you need more guidance
