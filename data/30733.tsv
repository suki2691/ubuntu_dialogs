2010-10-15T09:00:00.000Z	poincare101		Hello everyone. I have atheros ar5418 based card (dlink dwa 556), I did sudo modprobe ath9k, but I still cannot see the card in lspci. What's going on? (I need pretty urgent help, if possible)
2010-10-15T09:01:00.000Z	poincare101		anyone for my question?

2010-10-15T09:02:00.000Z	poincare101	etrnl	what do you mean? I did probe ath9k, if that's what you mean
