2009-06-13T19:32:00.000Z	mib_sbadufp7		can anyone explain what's the deal with ubuntu x.04and x.10 releases? Are 9.04 users supposed to upgrade to 9.10 when it comes out, or just wait for the 10.04?
2009-06-13T19:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	mib_sbadufp7	9.04 --> 200*9* April (04) || 9.10 --> 200*9* October (10)
2009-06-13T19:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	mib_sbadufp7	10.04 --> 20*10* April (04) and so on  ...
