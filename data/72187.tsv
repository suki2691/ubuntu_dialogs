2008-12-09T07:42:00.000Z	svchost		i should know better than to trust open source, it always lets you down
2008-12-09T07:43:00.000Z	svchost		well i mean.. the fact is, free stuff is usually garbage so i shouldn't expect it would actually work, especially not out of the box :-P. at least this time it recognized my keyboard unlike last time
