2010-06-26T04:11:00.000Z	eblume	wildbat	Actually I did, but I just found a typo. However the typo was introduced AFTER the screen first showed up. I'll give this a new try and come back if it failed.
2010-06-26T04:15:00.000Z	eblume	wildbat	Well color me confused. I checked it several times and found nothing before coming here, and the moment you tell me to check my fstab again, I find an error and it fixes it. Thanks!
