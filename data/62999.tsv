2009-08-03T21:31:00.000Z	MircoPaperino		My ubuntu 9.04 crashes with apparently no particular reasons, it randomly happens, the only thing i can do is to move the cursor on the screen
2009-08-03T21:31:00.000Z	nexsja	MircoPaperino	did you try running it in safe mode and see what happens?
2009-08-03T21:33:00.000Z	nexsja	MircoPaperino	For i'd be easier just to reinstall :>
2009-08-03T21:33:00.000Z	nexsja	MircoPaperino	it's only takes _reinstall-time_ + 10 minutes :> or so
