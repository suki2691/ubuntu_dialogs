2005-03-22T17:25:00.000Z	rtuck	eyequeue	Tried to upgrade my kernel to 2.10 k7 last night, system died afterwards. Gives binfmt-000 error on boot.
2005-03-22T17:26:00.000Z	eyequeue	rtuck	 no ideas
2005-03-22T17:27:00.000Z	rtuck	eyequeue	Thanks anyways. Maybe I can throw in another kernel and modules from over the network with a livecd.
