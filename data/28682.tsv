2010-07-22T02:12:00.000Z	theoctagon	Zelozelos	what do you mean with "default unzipper"  else install the package "unrar"#
2010-07-22T02:13:00.000Z	Zelozelos	theoctagon	i dont want to install another program, i just want whatever program thats handling compressed files to handle rar files as well
2010-07-22T02:14:00.000Z	theoctagon	Zelozelos	whoever knows your reason - I don't think that'll work
