2006-08-07T10:34:00.000Z	BalNdaR		what is the difference between kernel source ant kernel headers?
2006-08-07T10:35:00.000Z	Warbo	BalNdaR	Kernel source need to be compiled, kernel headers are for the kernel you are running (also the newer kernels are called linux-source and linux-headers)
2006-08-07T10:40:00.000Z	Warbo	BalNdaR	It will be "linux-source-2.6.15" (a) always linux-source b) minor versions don't mean anything to source code)
