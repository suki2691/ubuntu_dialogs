2007-05-08T09:49:00.000Z	V15		hi, when i installed ubuntu earlier, the partition manager didnt give the option to resize my partitions, or create a new one, but just to install on /hdc, which i thought at the time was just the 10gb ext2 partition automounted. but now i have lost all of my other partitions, is there anyway i can recover this data?
2007-05-08T09:51:00.000Z	V15		it would also be useful to know whether it did a quick or full format

2007-05-08T09:53:00.000Z	stefg	V15	so if the disk was partitoned before it might be that only the first 2-3 Gigs were deleted... i'd give testdisk a try
