2012-08-01T02:49:00.000Z	Hyperbyte		I have installed a new language in Ubuntu, and the language selector shows it as installed, but in the language selection screen of Gnome the language is still greyed out
2012-08-01T02:49:00.000Z	Hyperbyte		Why can't I select the language?

2012-08-01T02:50:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	OerHeks	oh, it's even sillier.  I have to drag languages, can't click.  d'oh.  By the way, leuke nickname. :)
