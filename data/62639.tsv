2009-04-01T04:06:00.000Z	akraft		I have a brand-new install, and I don't seem to be getting usb support. Is this a common problem, and how can I fix it?
2009-04-01T04:07:00.000Z	iceroot	akraft	usb enabled in bios? onboard usb?
2009-04-01T04:07:00.000Z	akraft	iceroot	it's onboard, I guess it could be disabled in bios somehow
2009-04-01T04:07:00.000Z	iceroot	akraft	then look there
