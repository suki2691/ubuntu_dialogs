2008-05-05T19:47:00.000Z	John_S		Can someone explain to me the idea of having "subversions" separate from the main program release? I'm thinking of SWScanner, from www.swscanner.org, where I downloaded and installed the main version (0.2.2) and it didn't work for many reasons; so I wrote the author, and he told me it was a known bug and  to use the "svn" version. Are "svn" versions considered beta or something, or why not...
2008-05-05T19:47:00.000Z	John_S		...just make the svn version the main released version if it is less buggy?

2008-05-05T19:52:00.000Z	hydrogen	John_S	yes.
