2006-05-27T14:58:00.000Z	dabaR	skybox	./necflash in its dir
2006-06-03T16:52:00.000Z	dabaR	skybox	use sudo, and mv
2006-06-03T16:53:00.000Z	dabaR	skybox	only in the /home dir that would work. Also, that is only if there is nothing under that new user's directory you like. Cause it will all be gone after that command.
