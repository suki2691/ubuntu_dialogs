2008-11-15T02:57:00.000Z	deigel		i have this laptop i've just purchased that currently has vista on it.  i'd like to do a dual boot configuration on it.  it worries me because it doesn't come with any install cds, and in addition to the os partition, it apparently has a vista-restore partition.  i'm worried that if i make room and install ubuntu that when it writes to mbr i wont ever be able to access the system restore partition.  is that true ?

2008-11-15T02:59:00.000Z	deigel	zsquareplusc	you are right.  it does have that option.  thank you so much i would have overlooked that.
