2008-01-02T11:09:00.000Z	pdaoust	bob__	just downloading it now to see if it's a problem with Sound-Juicer
2008-01-02T11:10:00.000Z	pdaoust	bob__	I wouldn't mind using Grip myself, but I'm setting up a computer for my dad, and naturally everything has to be as simple as possible. Hence, I'm hoping I can get Rhythmbox to rip CDs at a respectable speed.
