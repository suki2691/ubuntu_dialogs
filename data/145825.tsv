2007-02-14T11:41:00.000Z	chrisjw_		I always ask this question but anyway I'll ask it again because no one seems to be able to know the answer.. I want to use tahoma with aMSN, I've already copied the fonts from windows into my fonts directory.. KVirc is using tahoma, so does my desktop.. I've also installed the msttf core fonts.. they're visible to aMSN but not tahoma
2007-02-14T11:41:00.000Z	chrisjw_		any ideas?
