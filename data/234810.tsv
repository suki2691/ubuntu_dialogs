2005-11-28T14:50:00.000Z	bjv		we just got pushed on to kernel 2.6.12-10.24
2005-11-28T14:50:00.000Z	bjv		which means apt-get downloaded a 18mb 386 unoptimized kernel i will never use.
2005-11-28T14:50:00.000Z	bjv		is there any way to download, for instance a k7 optimized kernel, everytime a knew version gets pushed on us?
