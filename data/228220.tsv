2005-07-13T05:03:00.000Z	serengeti		hi :) I have 3 ubuntu computers here at home and I've come up with an idea to sync my dad's profiles on all the machines so no matter which one he chooses to use, he'll have the same desktop and files and settings
2005-07-13T05:03:00.000Z	serengeti		I think rsync is the way to go
2005-07-13T05:03:00.000Z	nikkia	serengeti	if they're networked, wouldn't using a network share for the home directory be easier ?
2005-07-13T05:04:00.000Z	serengeti	nikkia	but then one of the computers'd have to be on all the time
