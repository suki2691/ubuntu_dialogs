2010-09-21T06:13:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets		Hey guys, trying to update my system and I'm getting this error: "failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/do-core/ppa/ubuntu/dists/lucid/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz/dists/lucid/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz 404 not found". Any advice?
2010-09-21T06:15:00.000Z	bodwick	MasterofPuppets	/etc/apt/sources.list ?
2010-09-21T06:18:00.000Z	MasterofPuppets	xMff	bodwick: when I look in /etc/apt/sources.list, there's no mention of anything to do with do-core
2010-09-21T06:18:00.000Z	bodwick	MasterofPuppets	and you tried system -> administration -> software sources -> other sources ?
