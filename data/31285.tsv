2012-06-03T21:01:00.000Z	bugs_bugger		i have a little bash script question: i have a folder with selected photos on my mediaplayer and want to negative-sync it with the folder of origin.
2012-06-03T21:02:00.000Z	smw	bugs_bugger	negative sync?
2012-06-03T21:04:00.000Z	bugs_bugger	smw	Church: can this be done with rsync? compare 2 folders and delete those that are not common?
