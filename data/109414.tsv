2009-05-05T05:53:00.000Z	vasi	froystig	you can file a bug on launchpad, or just mail the package maintainer (see dpkg -p PACKAGE)
2009-05-05T05:55:00.000Z	froystig	vasi	thanks.  do you know who the ubuntu-MOTU devs are?  the email address given by dpkg -p is their dev list, and I don't want to just shoot off a mail at many folks.
2009-05-05T05:57:00.000Z	vasi	froystig	i'm not sure where it's listed, maybe on the packages.ubuntu.com page for that package?
