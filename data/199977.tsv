2006-04-10T09:15:00.000Z	rapha		I do know about route.
2006-04-10T09:15:00.000Z	rapha		But how to PERMANENTLY add a route under Ubuntu, preferably?
2006-04-10T09:15:00.000Z	slavik	rapha	route?
2006-04-10T09:16:00.000Z	rapha	slavik	route does not make the routes permanent. They're lost again after a reboot.
