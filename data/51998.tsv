2009-07-24T07:29:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	SkiingPenguins	do you want a gui?
2009-07-24T07:30:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	SkiingPenguins	then xubuntu (with xfce) is probably the only one that will work at all on that hardware (mainly because of the ram, the HD space is fine for most of them)
2009-07-24T07:31:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	SkiingPenguins	no problem
