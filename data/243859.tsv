2005-04-03T15:53:00.000Z	Snelda		Hey everyone, I've never used ubuntu and am downloading now.  Does it use the same installer as debian?
2005-04-03T15:54:00.000Z	crimsun	Snelda	it uses a modified version of the Sarge installer
2005-04-03T15:55:00.000Z	Snelda	crimsun	I was trying ubuntu because Debian's installer hangs on my system
