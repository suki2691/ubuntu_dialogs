2007-04-27T13:19:00.000Z	Wubipwntvista		I installed wubi and it f**ked my windows, I can't boot into it.  I'm on vista, so it's not there.  Can anyone help modify my boot.ini, as wubi claimed to be perfectly safe and it apparently isn't.  I have an assignment due tomorrow so it's crucial I can get back my files

2007-04-27T13:21:00.000Z	PriceChild	Wubipwntvista	(vista cd.) However I am unsure where the exact program is and you will have to search microsoft.com for help.
