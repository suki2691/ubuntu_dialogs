2008-05-05T19:14:00.000Z	rchrd		hi, i am a complete newbie. i have a friend who has a virus infested computer running xp. he would normally just format his c: drive, but he has lots of pictures of his daughter that he would like to keep. i had the idea of booting with and installing ubuntu, then deleting everything except the pictures. would that work? if so, how would it be done? thanks
