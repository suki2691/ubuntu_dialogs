2012-05-10T19:51:00.000Z	time-lady-reila		weelllll...i've come across an issue with wine that seems to stem from an ubuntu bug with 64 bit processors.
2012-05-10T19:52:00.000Z	time-lady-reila		Basically, I'm getting an internal error--invalid parameters error.  Everything I've found on the forums says that it's an issue with ptrace.
