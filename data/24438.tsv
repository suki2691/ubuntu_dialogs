2010-10-18T16:08:00.000Z	iceroot	azkorl	dd if=/dev/sdX of=/path/to/iso/my.iso    (replace sdX with your dvd-drive) and be carefull with dd
2010-10-18T16:09:00.000Z	azkorl	iceroot	 Is there an utility that can help me?
2010-10-18T16:10:00.000Z	azkorl	iceroot	 I ask because you told me to be careful with dd...why is that?
