2010-03-15T15:17:00.000Z	dgz		another question, is there something like DX's DirectInput? I would really like to get rid of the mouse lag I have. My Razer Salmosa behaves like crap in 9.10 :(
2010-03-15T15:19:00.000Z	jesusm	dgz	are you experimenting mouse lag on desktop or in games under Wine?
2010-03-15T15:20:00.000Z	jesusm		i'm using a MX518 in 9.10 and is running fine
2010-03-15T15:27:00.000Z	dgz	jesusm	, only in games, but not in Wine
