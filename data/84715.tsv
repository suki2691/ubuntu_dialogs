2009-12-10T13:28:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	jtaji	I did that... it says [ 8878.345450] ttyS1: LSR safety check engaged!
2009-12-10T13:30:00.000Z	jtaji	Ascavasaion	that doesn't sound right, ttyS1 is the second com port.... do the lines around that one sound like a webcam?
2009-12-10T13:30:00.000Z	jtaji	Ascavasaion	even if it was a serial device on USB I'd expect it to be ttyUSBx
