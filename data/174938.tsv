2008-01-27T02:05:00.000Z	edju		about to dwnload kubuntu.  there's a choice - 7.10 or 6.06.  something about support level.  what do they mean, support level?
2008-01-27T02:07:00.000Z	edju		Thanks.

2008-01-27T02:08:00.000Z	edju	astro76	upgrading is why I'm moving from debian - hope this is as rock-solid.
