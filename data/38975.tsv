2010-02-10T00:12:00.000Z	mustelo	tucemiux	that's what I thought. I sent it in to the manufacturer and they imaged my drive, updated my bios, and shipped it back. it worked under windows until I tried to install linux...
2010-02-10T00:13:00.000Z	tucemiux	mustelo	is the ethernet card working right now??? hardware is hardware, its supposed to work, if linux has no drivers or can at least still recognize it
