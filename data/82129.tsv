2008-09-04T02:24:00.000Z	jrib	m3F	you can install the packages manually
2008-09-04T02:24:00.000Z	jrib	m3F	you should also be more detailed than "not working"
2008-09-04T02:27:00.000Z	m3F	jrib	i execute sudo tasksel install lamp-server and it shows me a blue screen in the terminal and it freezes at "installing 0%"
