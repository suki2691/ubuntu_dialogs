2009-03-25T05:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Saib00t	indeed it does
2009-03-25T05:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Saib00t	on the Live CD you get a choice of languages
2009-03-25T05:10:00.000Z	Saib00t	sebsebseb	i meant like... lets say you install an english version. are you able to switch languages within the OS without re-installing?
