2010-08-17T04:56:00.000Z	jrenner		can I please get some help?
2010-08-17T04:57:00.000Z	jrenner		I'm trying to install member:Ubuntu 10.04 Server on a box that has a RAID1 configuration for my HDD and I receive an error every time I try to format a partition. I tried using a 9.10 Desktop CD to format first and then use it but the install required a format. (That technique had worked for installing 10.04 Desktop). So I'm at a loss as to what to do. any help?
