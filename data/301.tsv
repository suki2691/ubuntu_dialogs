2012-11-25T19:51:00.000Z	D_Russ		i have a 12.04 install alongside windows (dual boot) i want to get rid of the windows partition and give ubuntu all of the harddrive space. Do i need a boot repair after i do so?

2012-11-25T19:54:00.000Z	16SAAK2LL	D_Russ	do you plan to enlarge ur ubuntu partition or do you want to use it as a data partition?
