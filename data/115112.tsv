2007-10-26T18:16:00.000Z	ku1	mookid	I'm not sure iwconfig is the right place for my problem. I'm using the nm-applet where I can choose networks. But there is no GUI to select a preferred network other than manually "Connect to Other Wireless Network". But when I reboot I'm getting a different network again.
