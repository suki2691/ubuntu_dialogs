2007-08-21T05:01:00.000Z	Lamego	hende07	using vmware or colinux, yes
2007-08-21T05:02:00.000Z	Lamego	hende07	dual boot would be your best option, unless you need to use both
2007-08-21T05:06:00.000Z	Lamego	hende07	if you are going to do a distro upgrade, and have a lot of customizations which include other packages or kernel drivers which are not ubuntu specific, you may get into troubles anyway
