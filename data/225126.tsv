2005-09-01T09:09:00.000Z	f_newton	Viziri	that fact coupled with the way linux files are written and stored fairly well precludes any major linux problem
2005-09-01T09:11:00.000Z	f_newton	Viziri	dont misunderstand now, there are insecurities and there are program hacks... but the basic os is fairly free from destruction
