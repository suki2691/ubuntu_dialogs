2011-04-30T11:51:00.000Z	virgilivs		i just tried upgrading from to 11.04. the upgrade failed. it froze. Is there any way to resume or restart the installation? It died at configuring udisks
2011-04-30T11:52:00.000Z	genupulas	virgilivs	 i think even though u abort the upgrade if u start again then it will continue fromwhere its stopped ....just retsart the system
2011-04-30T11:53:00.000Z	virgilivs	genupulas	I didn't abort it though. The kernel panicked, the display and peripherals froze, and I manually turned off the machine. It's running 11.04 now as if everything is fine
2011-04-30T11:54:00.000Z	virgilivs	genupulas	but everything is NOT fine because it didn't complete installation.
