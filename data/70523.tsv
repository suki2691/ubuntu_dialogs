2009-02-19T04:23:00.000Z	Sarai		My laptop dual boots vista and ubuntu, which I installed using ubuntu. Vista has crashed and is unbootable- frankly I'm not too torn up about it since I was wanting to ditch it anyway. The only thing I had stored on there was my music. Any way of accessing that part of my hard drive from ubuntu?
