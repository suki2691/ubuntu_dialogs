2007-10-09T09:30:00.000Z	linux4me	insub	- you might need "sudo" if you are not root
2007-10-09T09:33:00.000Z	linux4me	insub	- you have to edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file
2007-10-09T09:37:00.000Z	linux4me	insub	- may i recommed ubuntu fiesty 7.04, it gives you a LAMP (linux apache mysql php) in about 15 mins!
