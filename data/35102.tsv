I configured a DSL connection in the network manager, but when I try to connect, Ubuntu says: "Disconnected from auto eth0" and then tries to connect to DSL, but it doesn't work. I think it is because it first disconnects from auto eth0 (I have a DHCP server, btw) which I think is an error. What am I doing wrong?
