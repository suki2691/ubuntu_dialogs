2008-03-02T06:01:00.000Z	adaptr	joecurlee	you can reduce that, and most of it is mysql binlogs, they're harmless enough, although 46 GB is on the large side
2008-03-02T06:01:00.000Z	adaptr	joecurlee	have you tried #ubuntu-mythtv ?
2008-03-02T06:02:00.000Z	joecurlee	adaptr	no haven't tried there yet... logging in now to find out how to reduce log size
