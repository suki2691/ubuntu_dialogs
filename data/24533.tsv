2011-09-22T12:40:00.000Z	scarleo		I mean I know kernel updates require reboot but I mean like apt telling me before installing that the update will require a reboot

2011-09-22T12:42:00.000Z	scarleo	TeslaTony	No oc it doesn't force me, it's not windoze we're talking abt, but it would still be sweet if it could tell me that it needs to reboot to complete the update before I actually do the update
