2006-04-05T14:01:00.000Z	FlannelKing	ax9	the way ubuntu works, is it effectively freezes the versions for each release.  Versions will be updated again in Dapper, due to release June 1.
2006-04-05T14:02:00.000Z	ax9	FlannelKing	 so im stuck with it for now?

You could upgrade to the alpha versions of dapper, it's pretty stable, if you're just using ubuntu as a desktop, (and have nothing important that isn't backed up) you'll be fine (it's pretty stable anyway)
