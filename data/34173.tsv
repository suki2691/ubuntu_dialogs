I like to develop for GTK .. seems better for me and i found that GTK development somewhat is compilcated and some other project like gtkmm is a good start . I read also about GTK# of mono develop . I realy don't care about patents .I care about
2010-04-11T02:59:00.000Z	dr3mro		 the code be easy to manage and uses the least amount of RAM ( that's why i Left python a hello world gtk app in python uses 5.6 MB without the PY process and c++ uses just as low as 1 MB of ram).. My question ?? Do mono developed GTK apps with c++ uses as low RAM and CPU as GTKMM with geany ide example ??????????
