2008-04-26T14:11:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tony403	 depends on what apps you are wanting.   I mixx and match kde/gnome  apps depending on the task i am doing.
2008-04-26T14:13:00.000Z	tony403	Dr_willis	i just like consistency. not really in favor of one over the other. i don't think it's too much to ask anymore to install both gtk and kde apps and not have them look like crap anymore next to each other
2008-04-26T14:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tony403	 i dont really notice them looking like crap.. really I dont even notice which apps are gnome and which are kde.  I do enable those 'use gnome themes on kde apps and visa versa' tools.
