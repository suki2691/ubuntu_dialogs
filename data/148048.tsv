I know next to nothing (although i do understand a lot of the low level stuff, ie the sockets apis) I imagine there are plenty of higher level concepts though that a well designed network system would be good to adopt, the "handshake" immediately comes to mind but i imagine there are other high level concepts or patterns worth learning about
2007-12-05T07:01:00.000Z	Ademan		i know that's at least midly off topic, sorry
2007-12-05T07:01:00.000Z	Ademan		already there :-p
