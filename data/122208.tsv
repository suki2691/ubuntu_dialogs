2009-01-14T02:29:00.000Z	gnutron	Jerusalem420	the path is wrong
2009-01-14T02:35:00.000Z	gnutron	Jerusalem420	sudo crontab -e  to edit a root owned crontab, lose the root in the syntax
2009-01-14T02:40:00.000Z	gnutron	Jerusalem420	you can also sudo tail -f /var/log/messages and watch for any errors as cron executes.
