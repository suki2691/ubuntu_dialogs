2007-07-07T15:48:00.000Z	Jowi	preem	if you use gnome it is "metacity"
2007-07-07T15:50:00.000Z	Jowi	preem	that will contain the themes for metacity, yes.
2007-07-07T15:51:00.000Z	Jowi	preem	simply changing the theme to a working one in the gnome-theme-manager should take care of that. if one theme is not working, simply remove it from your ~/.themes dir.
