2007-09-01T15:22:00.000Z	arooni_		i have a microsoft mouse with forward & back buttons... how do i make it such that those buttons do forward/back in firefox?
2007-09-01T15:22:00.000Z	bruenig	arooni_	doubt that you will be able, would suggest using mouse gesture extensions or the keyboard alt + arrows
2007-09-01T15:23:00.000Z	arooni_	bruenig	really?
2007-09-01T15:24:00.000Z	bruenig	arooni_	oh nevermind that link has a way of mapping that particular button to the alt + arrow keys
