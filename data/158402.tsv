2010-01-29T01:48:00.000Z	bitzy		hello, I am a new ubuntu user... can I use Yahoo messenger on this SO?
2010-01-29T01:48:00.000Z	Slart	bitzy	yes.. you can either use empathy, that might already be installed, or try pidgin
2010-01-29T01:50:00.000Z	Slart	bitzy	usually the text message stuff works nicely.. but things like video, file sharing and other special things might not work reliably on linux
2010-01-29T01:52:00.000Z	Slart	bitzy	have a look at gnome-look.org
