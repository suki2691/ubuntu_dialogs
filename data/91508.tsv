2008-05-07T04:19:00.000Z	Requim		Maybe this is an ignorant question, but if I run Ubuntu from the live CD, and if I make changes to the system, how does Ubuntu keep track of any changes during the session if it can't write to the Live CD? Or is it simply not possible to make any changes that require writing to the disk?

2008-05-07T04:20:00.000Z	Creationist	Requim	ALL done in RAM, yes.
