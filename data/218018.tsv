2005-09-24T16:37:00.000Z	slack7384	red_blood	shouldn't gdm resolution and X.org/XFree86 resoloution be the same?
2005-09-24T16:40:00.000Z	slack7384	red_blood	so you want the gdm resolution to be 1024x768 like the desktop?
2005-09-24T16:45:00.000Z	slack7384	red_blood	you might have to hack your way through /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf file to set the resolution?
