2012-03-02T12:48:00.000Z	stephans_		Ok so I originally asked about a bunch of stuff regarding memory and performance... havin suffered really slow and unresponsiveness of my system even at a real mem use of only 60%. I have solved the problem with the help on thins chat. vm.swappiness = 10
2012-03-02T12:48:00.000Z	stephans_		the system is now at 80% mem and still responsive
2012-03-02T12:48:00.000Z	stephans_		still wakes from sleep
