2009-03-15T08:17:00.000Z	RussM_	bonez46	Should work OK, I've moved drives before.
2009-03-15T08:18:00.000Z	RussM_	bonez46	Though you mentioned ext4, I have no idea about that. Still using ext3, not planning on moving up for a bit.
2009-03-15T08:21:00.000Z	bonez46	RussM_	that's just it. I haven't moved up.. the drive in question is running 8.10 desktop, and I don't know anything about ext4 either..
