2011-08-16T23:10:00.000Z	Blues003		People, a noob is having a problem. I am running a machine with Windows 7 32bit (Sony Vaio Laptop). I wanted to try out Ubuntu, so I put it on a USB Thumbdrive, ran from it, partitioned my HDD, and installed Ubuntu on the new partition. However, whenever I now boot the laptop, it always boots on Windows and never gives me the option to boot on Ubuntu.
