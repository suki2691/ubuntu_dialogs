2008-12-12T06:10:00.000Z	badawi	n8tuser2	2 eth0 and vbox0 for virtual box
2008-12-12T06:12:00.000Z	badawi	n8tuser2	i followed the virtualbox docs, vbox does not creat it by default, i added br0 to /etc/network/interfaces
2008-12-12T06:12:00.000Z	badawi	n8tuser2	guess i can use kvpnc to connect, i'll try that
