2008-11-12T11:32:00.000Z	epoxy_	whymarkwh	somewhat.  download the latest version though.  8.10 or something.
2008-11-12T11:33:00.000Z	epoxy_	whymarkwh	dhcp should be easy (google it.. it's straight forward).  as far as the mail server, be very very very careful.
2008-11-12T11:38:00.000Z	epoxy_	whymarkwh	cancel that download and get the latest edition :)
