2007-01-27T08:49:00.000Z	SilentDis	Brady_M	system builder:  as in someone who builds their own 'puter, or something else?
2007-01-27T08:53:00.000Z	SilentDis	Brady_M	I do custom builds all the time, and do recommend ubuntu myself.  I offer a windows option, and only offer retail box options for purchasing it legally.  if someone asks me to fix their 'puter, I offer to put ubuntu on it, or they have to give me a valid windows CD/CD key with it.  period.  i don't own a shop, but I do what I can to push ubuntu that way:  keep it legal or go open source, period. :)
2007-01-27T08:59:00.000Z	SilentDis	Brady_M	I firmly believe that linux has finally come to a point of 'usable' for the normal person.  yes, there are some rough edges (synaptic, drivers, etc) but if you're custom building the machines and setting them up fully, you could probably throw in 6mo service for a VERY small fee and people would be OVERJOYED at the lower cost on their machine, and all the good that comes with a true linux OS :)
