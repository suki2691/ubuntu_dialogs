2011-08-21T21:58:00.000Z	kryl		I broke my system by trying to move partition. Actually I can read some files but some binary seems to be corrupted while the booting sequence. Do you know a way to repair the system via livecd. or something who will check binary for size or other and try to re-install them ?
2011-08-21T21:59:00.000Z	kryl		I use reiserfs partition and used gparted to move it while it crashed
2011-08-21T22:00:00.000Z	zykotick9	kryl	(old joke follows) why are you using murderfs?  Doesn't make sense to me personally.
