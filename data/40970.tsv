2009-12-14T11:10:00.000Z	oisin12		I'm currently running windows xp and trying to install Ubuntu 7.04 from a disk I was mailed.  When I boot from the disk I run the option Start or Install Ubuntu but it doesn't install.  Instead it tells me that a graphical interface could not be started and just starts a command line terminal.  Is this because there's some other Ubuntu on my system from a way back(I don't believe there is)?
