2006-11-27T12:26:00.000Z	holycow	Ronfar	that would indicate a video card driver issue by your description
2006-11-27T12:27:00.000Z	holycow	Ronfar	but what video card do you have? and what drivers are you using?
2006-11-27T12:33:00.000Z	Ronfar	holycow	thanks for the advice, I'll try a card from another one of my computers and see if thats the problem, let you know if it works or not thanks again
