2008-08-02T02:59:00.000Z	AzizLight		is it normal that when I use rm to remove a file it is completely removed (the file doesnt go to the trash)?
2008-08-02T02:59:00.000Z	glitsj16	AzizLight	yes, that's the point of rm
2008-09-04T00:51:00.000Z	glitsj16	AzizLight	have you tried the suggestion in that error report (lines 7 to 9) to reference an icon theme in ~/.gtkrc-2.0 ?
