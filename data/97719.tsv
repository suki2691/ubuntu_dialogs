2008-04-22T15:33:00.000Z	pengo	arvind_khadri	a ready available one or one i write myself?
2008-04-22T15:35:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	pengo	search the google,you might have to write one...well one way to go about is copy the /var/cache/apt/ to some file and put in a drive which wont be affected by the upgrade and then feed it back using re-direction
