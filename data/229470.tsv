2007-05-07T06:11:00.000Z	Anguis		I'm looking for help installing Feisty Fawn AMD64 - I get to the first options screen of the disc and then the computer locks up, I have to re-start.
2007-05-07T06:12:00.000Z	bimberi	Anguis	have you verified the ISO and/or the CD?
2007-05-07T06:13:00.000Z	bimberi	Anguis	no, but it's always something to check when issues such as yours arise
