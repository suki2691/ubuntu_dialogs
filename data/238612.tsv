2005-05-05T05:39:00.000Z	sebix		Hi, is there a way to prevent rythmbox from discovering the title/artists from the directories I want to import in my library ? Because the one he doesn't find out, he puts them into an "unknown artists" directory...

2005-05-05T05:41:00.000Z	sebix	BigRob	rythmbox also fails on .ogg subdirs...
2005-05-05T05:41:00.000Z	BigRob	sebix	to my knowledge rythmbox does not go based on directoris oggs have file tags also
