2008-07-28T09:26:00.000Z	santiago		no big difference between them? i mean isnt there one more advanced and more complicated to install? (asking so i dont choose that one :D)
2008-07-28T09:27:00.000Z	santiago		well i'll choose one randomly :P
2008-07-28T09:27:00.000Z	sjovan	santiago	compiz is installed by default...
