2006-06-07T14:58:00.000Z	tga		I'm having trouble with my Orinoco cards since I upgraded to Dapper.. any idea if it's a known problem?
2006-06-07T14:59:00.000Z	tga		basically I don't get a link, even though I have the right settings
2006-06-07T15:01:00.000Z	tga		how can I check what kind of WEP my wifi card is using?
