2007-04-18T11:39:00.000Z	offspring		How do I force Ununtu to install. I've got Ubuntu Server version installed but I hate the command line. I want to install the gui. How do I either A) make the desktop version install, or what do I have to enter in the server version to install the gui?

2007-04-18T11:40:00.000Z	offspring		I'll try it.
