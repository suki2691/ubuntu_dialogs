2010-01-27T23:42:00.000Z	charles__		can anyone help me for a sec.. i need to know how you refer to files with spaces in their names when yuo're using the terminal
2010-01-27T23:43:00.000Z	sayanriju	charles__	you can also "" quote the names
2010-01-27T23:46:00.000Z	sayanriju	charles__	you could try running gedit from the terminal and watch for error messages, if any
2010-01-27T23:51:00.000Z	sayanriju	charles__	does it still freeze?
