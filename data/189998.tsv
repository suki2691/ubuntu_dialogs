2006-06-23T14:23:00.000Z	nate_02631		Hi all - just an XGL curiosity - I have it working fine... but it seems like some effects/features are missing, based on what I saw on a SUSE install - such as transparency, being able to drag window over to different desktop with mouse, window peelback, "unfolding" the cube, and my windows don' wobble when maximizing/restoring (though they do when dragging)...
2006-06-23T14:23:00.000Z	nate_02631		Is this just specific to the Ubuntu implimentation? Or are there some shortcuts, or compiz directives I might be missing?
2006-06-23T14:24:00.000Z	nate_02631		Gotcha - thanks - Warbo...
2006-06-23T14:24:00.000Z	Ohzie	nate_02631	Hey. I've realized that the ubuntu compiz package is a little limited. I played with it a small bit. I suggest you check out #ubuntu-xgl for a more detailed answer. Sorry. :[
