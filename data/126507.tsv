My default (and what I prefer it at) is 1280x1024. But when I try to use 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh' to reinstate the 1280x1024 resolution, it reverts back to the original driver.

2007-08-03T06:37:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	ShackJac1	Ah I'll probably need it edit it. I don't see an fglrx in there in the first place though.
2007-08-03T06:38:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	ShackJac1	Be right on it. BRB! And Thanks!
