2012-11-30T13:53:00.000Z	iceroot	tizxxx	interfaces is just one way to edit the settings but network-manager will for example overwrite that settings
2012-11-30T13:54:00.000Z	tizxxx	iceroot	i apt-get purge network manager, ifconfig shows actual ip, but i want settings from interfaces.
2012-11-30T13:55:00.000Z	tizxxx	iceroot	i'm using script from opennebula for my vm, it puts rights settings to interfaces file, but i can't figure out how to apply them
