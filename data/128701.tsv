2007-08-23T05:06:00.000Z	AlgorthmicContro	Midnight_Abuse	and they already have, the thing is they charge a 100 dollars more just for the manufactures to install it and somehow still preloaded it with Dell shit, they don't want to use profits and money, IE a simple copy of XP Home home on a dell branded computer costs ~$99
