2010-03-30T20:20:00.000Z	fgfdfg		Hello, I have been trying to go into super user mode with the command su to change my password but when I type the password that I use to login it says authentication failure.
2010-03-30T20:21:00.000Z	fgfdfg		Can someone please help me with this problem?
2010-03-30T20:22:00.000Z	lazarus	fgfdfg	because the root password has not been set as llutz says use sudo
2010-03-30T20:24:00.000Z	lazarus	fgfdfg	if you've type your password before using su or sudo terminal remembers it for that session
