2010-11-15T23:11:00.000Z	need-some-help		i have a srt file which is written in Croatian. now all the letters with an acute or an caron look like squares with signs in it? how can i solve this? thanks
2010-11-15T23:11:00.000Z	calaen0	need-some-help	set the language for the app to utf-8
2010-11-15T23:12:00.000Z	calaen0	need-some-help	if not UTF-8, then whatever encoding the file was written with.
2010-11-15T23:12:00.000Z	calaen0	need-some-help	my guess is, the file was created using a different app, so figure out what the lang setting there was
