2009-12-06T11:13:00.000Z	Wicked		so bluetooth is still broken in 9.10....i was hoping it would finally be fixed :(
2009-12-06T11:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Wicked	 it worked for me. but i dont do a lot of fancy things with it,.. and it did take some twiddling.
2009-12-06T11:14:00.000Z	Wicked		!bluetooth
2009-12-06T11:15:00.000Z	Wicked	Dr_Willis	well its throwing errors in dmesg...looks like a issue with the module or something
