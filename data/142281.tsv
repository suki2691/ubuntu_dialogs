2010-06-22T18:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	scar_	you can not
2010-06-22T18:46:00.000Z	scar_	erUSUL	if phone to pc doesn't work i'm sure pc to phone will, just will have to setup streaming software... thanks for the quick answer
2010-06-22T18:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	scar_	then the question is « i want to play in my phone media streamed from my pc » no « i want to use my phone as a speaker » ; isn't it ? :)
