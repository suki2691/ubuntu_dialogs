2009-04-16T09:05:00.000Z	celthunder	cubays	where did you select to install grub to?
2009-04-16T09:09:00.000Z	celthunder	cubays	edit your menu.lst and add each os each one should look something like title <osname> uuid <driveid> kernel <yourkernel> initrd (optional but if you put it put your initramfs after)
2009-04-16T09:12:00.000Z	cubays	celthunder	ok.I will try it. Maybe the problem is that I have Win system primary partiton and Ubntu on Extended.
