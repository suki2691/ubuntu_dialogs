2007-02-20T15:47:00.000Z	Tzadok		it is possible to make an "live" ubuntu hd isnt it? sumtin that work on all x86.
2007-02-20T15:49:00.000Z	kelsin	Tzadok	yeah all x86, I think you were asking about x86 plus ppc and x86_64, even if you only ran it on x86 machines, if the hardware was different settings for certain packages could be drasically different and casue problems
