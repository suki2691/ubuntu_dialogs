2011-06-28T23:23:00.000Z	yaaar	trism	sorry, i don't know what ibus is (and googling it turned up stuff that doesn't seem to be related). i'm talking about the little thing in the notification area that i can click on to switch between keyboard layouts. i have two, one which is labelled "USA" (which is colemak) and one labelled "USA2" (which is qwerty).
