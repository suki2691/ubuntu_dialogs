2008-02-04T17:15:00.000Z	adrenergic		i have compiled pidgin... how can i make an icon for it in the applications menu
2008-02-04T17:16:00.000Z	Slart	adrenergic	right click on the applications menu, select edit?
2008-02-04T17:17:00.000Z	Slart	adrenergic	so because you compiled pidgin you're all of a sudden incapable of right-clicking the applications menu?? that just doesn't make sense
