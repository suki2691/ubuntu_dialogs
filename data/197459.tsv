2006-03-14T09:59:00.000Z	aroticoz		can anyone help me install maya7.0 on ubuntu 5.10 ?
2006-03-14T10:00:00.000Z	Healot	aroticoz	what's the exact problem, no debian package? need compiling?
2006-03-14T10:01:00.000Z	Healot	aroticoz	okay, i think it is rather the installer's fault... not really ubuntu-specific...
2006-03-14T10:03:00.000Z	Healot	aroticoz	did you "alien" it?
