2012-08-09T20:34:00.000Z	heisenmink		how do I change my icons in newest ubuntu? I installed an icon pack to /usr/share/icons and relogged, but I guess there's an additional step?
2012-08-09T20:34:00.000Z	trism	heisenmink	use gnome-tweak-tool or myunity
2012-08-09T20:35:00.000Z	heisenmink	trism	which one do you recommend most?
2012-08-09T20:35:00.000Z	trism	heisenmink	if you use unity and don't want to pull in gnome-shell, then myunity, otherwise I'd prefer gnome-tweak-tool
