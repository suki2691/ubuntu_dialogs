2009-11-18T23:13:00.000Z	northmanor		anybody have any experience recovering a lost partition from a drive that is failing?
2009-11-18T23:14:00.000Z	northmanor		tried testdisk and it said it couldn't recover it,. this is running it on the drive itself
2009-11-18T23:14:00.000Z	northmanor		this disk hasn't totally failed just many bad sectors/failing
2009-11-18T23:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	northmanor	 theres also 'ddrescue' and 'dd_rescue' that can work better then 'dd' in many ways
