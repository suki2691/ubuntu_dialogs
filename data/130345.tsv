2007-07-15T13:27:00.000Z	kravlin	telexicon	Its not wine. Its a dedicated server that's built to run on linux
2007-07-15T13:28:00.000Z	telexicon	kravlin	its not 64bit?
2007-07-15T13:29:00.000Z	kravlin	telexicon	I don't think that the dedicated server is because of what it's looking for.  I can't get it to run in the 64bit Arcatecture. I was wondering if there's a way to get it to work without reinstalling ubuntu again.
