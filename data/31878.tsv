2010-05-15T22:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ertu	 ive never heard of anything causing a users theme settings to reset. Unless the window manager is crashing and somthing else is starting up to replace it
2010-05-15T22:27:00.000Z	ertu	Dr_Willis	i have had the same screen blinking issue after a fresh install. it'd blink few mins before screen saver or if i started media player
