2005-08-02T15:56:00.000Z	Firetech		What can be wrong if my USB 2.0 external drive gets recognised as a high speed device, but doesn't give me speeds over 10 MB/s (approx 80 Mbps)?
2005-08-02T15:57:00.000Z	mpmc	Firetech	maybe a bottleneck?
2005-08-02T15:58:00.000Z	Firetech	mpmc	It's the same for all my USB 2.0 stuff
2005-08-02T15:59:00.000Z	Firetech	mpmc	you mean other USB stuff or?
