2011-12-05T03:38:00.000Z	codd		I'll rephrase my question; can I make an extended partition with label Linux that has 3 logical partitions, / /home and swap? Because I only have 1 primary partition left. Windows already took 3.

2011-12-05T03:39:00.000Z	codd		Great! I thought it would not be bootable :)
2011-12-05T03:39:00.000Z	codd	escott	then what is the point of the bootable flag of primary partitions?
