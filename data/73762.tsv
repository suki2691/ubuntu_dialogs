2010-01-20T11:24:00.000Z	misteralexander		I need some help making an SSH shortcut. I see on UbuntuForums, they tell you to create a link through Nautilus. That opens the remote server in a GUI view, I need a "Shortcut" as it were I can click & have it open up in Terminal.  Any Ideas?

2010-01-20T11:26:00.000Z	misteralexander	blakkheim	LOL -- I know, I usually open terminal and type in ' ssh username@server.com ' but (i'm lazy) and just want to double click an icon and have terminal open with the info already there.  I can go to Places > Connect To A Server | but that opens the remote server in a GUI, I need it open in Terminal.
