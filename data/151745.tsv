2007-11-20T14:49:00.000Z	mikebeecham		good morning all....can anyone tell me why the fonts on Ubuntu do not quite look the same as on windows?  For example I am running firefox, but even using the Arial font, it's not quite the same somehow?
2007-11-20T14:50:00.000Z	mikebeecham		but for some reason the linux one look 'wider'
2007-11-20T14:52:00.000Z	mikebeecham		so is there anything in particular that I can do to sort the fonts out, or is this a linux issue?
2007-11-20T14:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U__	mikebeecham	What is wrong with the fonts?
