2010-10-27T15:16:00.000Z	Spandi		Hello everyone  I wonder what does this error message mean hd0,0 NTF5S, No Wuibldr . Ubuntu was installed on Vista and it ran very well for a few days until I started receiveing this message ?
2010-10-27T15:16:00.000Z	Spandi		Would I be able to recover the Ubuntu system or I require to go for a fresh install ?
