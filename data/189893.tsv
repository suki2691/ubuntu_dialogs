2007-09-25T09:21:00.000Z	FFighter		Hello, can anyone tell me something about FluxBox?
2007-09-25T09:22:00.000Z	FFighter		Does it take less memory than gnome ?
2007-09-25T09:24:00.000Z	slackern	FFighter	Yes Fluxbox is very light but it's not a desktop enviroment like gnome it's only a windowmanager so it lacks alot of functionallity that gnome and kde has.
