2011-01-07T14:37:00.000Z	theduke		is there any dynamic gnome firewall manager out there? with dynamic I mean the way most windows firewalls work - by showing a popup when a unidentified connection is attempted and giving you the option to approve or deny it
2011-01-07T14:38:00.000Z	rumpel__	theduke	whats the point in that?
