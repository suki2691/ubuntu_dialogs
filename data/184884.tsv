2008-03-01T06:46:00.000Z	puff		Hi guys.  A friend wants to experiment with linux, with linux acting as the access point.
2008-03-01T06:47:00.000Z	puff		He wants to set up a freestanding hotspot (no internet connection at his house) and experiment wtih home automation devices that would communicate via wifi to a management program running on the linux box.
2008-03-01T06:48:00.000Z	puff		So he'd have to set up a dhcp server, what else would he install to have the linux box act as the router?
