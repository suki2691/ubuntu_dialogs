2007-08-04T13:04:00.000Z	WX9J		I have a slave with 4 partitions , do I need to add the drive, and then each partition  in /etc/fstab to get them mounted at boot ?

2007-08-04T13:05:00.000Z	Slart	WX9J	or.. wait.. you don't have to add the drive.. just the partitions
2007-08-04T13:06:00.000Z	WX9J	Slart	thanks, was not sure
