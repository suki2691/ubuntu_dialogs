2012-04-07T11:20:00.000Z	Shappy		On the top bar right click only let's me "Add Panel..." where I can select from a bunch of already installed stuff. I want to add Eclipse to the panel like I do with an already installed app by going into Applications >[path to app like Games] > right click on app > Add this launcher to panel
2012-04-07T11:22:00.000Z	Shappy		It seems I would have to add my application to the Applications menu first. How would I do this?
