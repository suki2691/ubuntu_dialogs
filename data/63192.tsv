2011-03-02T18:14:00.000Z	kaddi		i need soemthing like pdf-creator for ubuntu
2011-03-02T18:15:00.000Z	sipior	kaddi	have a look at pdftk
2011-03-02T18:21:00.000Z	sipior	kaddi	i thought for sure that pdftk supported n-up concatenation, but i'm damned if i can find the man page entry. pdfjam does have a tool for that sort of thing, though: pdfnup.
2011-03-02T18:22:00.000Z	kaddi	sipior	thanks, i'll look into pdfnup.. I couldn't find it with pdftk either, it would've been my first choice :P
