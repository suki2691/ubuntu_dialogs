2012-10-29T03:50:00.000Z	c_smith	abdobonna	first off you have to show sustained contributions.
2012-10-29T03:52:00.000Z	c_smith	abdobonna	but what have you contributed to the Ubuntu ecosystem? membership isn't something you apply for with out showing a good deal of contribution for a good period of time.
2012-10-29T03:54:00.000Z	c_smith	abdobonna	but that's just a LoCo team, doesn't reflect too much on Membership, but it seems to moderately help
