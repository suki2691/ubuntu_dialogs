2005-07-07T06:49:00.000Z	nbx909|linux		is there a way to use ubuntu like with out X but when you have X installed already?
2005-07-07T06:49:00.000Z	nbx909|linux		does that make any sense?
2005-07-07T06:50:00.000Z	_SWAT_	nbx909|linux	doesn't make sense (to me). Do you mean without Gnome etc. ? So that you'll only get a console login?
2005-07-07T06:51:00.000Z	_SWAT_	nbx909|linux	did you try apt-get remove gnome (or something like that? :P)
