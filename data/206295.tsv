2006-10-26T10:43:00.000Z	Mirv		I've now two machines that seem to be stalled when upgrading with the update-manager. has anyone else the same problem?
2006-10-26T10:44:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Mirv	could be becouse of high server load...
2006-10-26T10:44:00.000Z	Mirv		all packages downloaded, both are stalled in doing something. the first is setting up libpam0g (but in truth completely idle)
2006-10-26T10:44:00.000Z	Mirv	nolimitsoya	download went ok, it's in the package installation phase
