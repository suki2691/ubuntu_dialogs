2006-01-19T14:54:00.000Z	Mabus	LinuxMonk	did you verify the md5 for the iso you used? And did you burn the cd at a slow (lower than 8 if possible) speed?
2006-01-19T14:55:00.000Z	LinuxMonk	Mabus	theres nothing wrong with the cd, its been checked and rechecked and been used to install on another system of mine
2006-01-19T14:56:00.000Z	Mabus	LinuxMonk	try burning it again at 4x and go for it. When booting from CDs, it seems to be picky. My CD that I installed Ubuntu on one day didn't work the next. If you can afford the dollar for the wasted CD, just try it.
