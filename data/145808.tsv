2010-02-13T07:53:00.000Z	adudutz		I'm having trouble installing Xubuntu 9.10 (using alternate cd) with GRUB2 in an old Pentium 3 (using slot processor) system (not connected to the net). After the installation, when I rebooted, the GRUB simply drops back to grub rescue. This problem does not present in PCLOS (using GRUB). Is it possible if I replace the default boot loader during installation using GRUB instead of GRUB2?
