2011-01-14T17:22:00.000Z	Guest70653		which is the best edition of ubuntu to ask for a basic user ?
2011-01-14T17:22:00.000Z	jrib	Guest70653	10.04 or 10.10 (most recent)
2011-01-14T17:24:00.000Z	jrib	Guest70653	the advantage of 10.04 is that you won't have to upgrade for two years (when the next LTS is released).  10.04 is supported until April 2013.  With 10.10, you really have to keep upgrading every 6 months (even though it has support for 18 months)
