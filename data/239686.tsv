2005-10-18T09:36:00.000Z	fullets	jeff_	you played with haskell much?
2005-10-18T09:37:00.000Z	jeff_	fullets	C, some C++, perl, fortran, a bit of Cobol. Thats it unfortunately
2005-10-18T09:38:00.000Z	fullets	jeff_	haskell has optionally iimportant whitespace, if you use {}; it respects those, otherwise indentation is relevant. sometimes I wish python was similar
