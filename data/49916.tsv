2009-09-15T04:18:00.000Z	rejohn		kdeplasma-addons question:  Is it safe to have this package removed from a standard kde desktop system? Reason: I want to have apt-get cease downloading the kdebase-workspace-wallpapers package, because it is large (45MB) for my inet connection. [I'm running KUbuntu 904 with the ppa enabled for the latest KDE package updates.]  It was suggested to me that I apt-get remove that package, & see what other packages will be removed, or
2009-09-15T04:18:00.000Z	rejohn		When I did  "apt-get -s remove kdebase-workspace-wallpapers" it said: "The following packages will be REMOVED:  kdebase-workspace-wallpapers kdeplasma-addons plasma-wallpapers-addons".  The only concern I can think of is that removing "kdeplasma-addons" might be bad for my system.  Your suggestions, please?

2009-09-15T04:20:00.000Z	rejohn	seidos	that's what I'm asking - & i do know this is #ubuntu, not #kde ;) - but do you know if removing the "kdeplasma-addons" would be problem causing?
