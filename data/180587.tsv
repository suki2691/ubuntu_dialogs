2007-08-27T16:26:00.000Z	stefg	ttuttle	it's not so much a question of how ood *ubuntu* is at 64bit, but how to get the nonfree stuff to work (codecs, flash)
2007-08-27T16:26:00.000Z	ttuttle	stefg	Yeah, Gentoo has the same issues.  My hope would be that, once Ubuntu solved them, they would simply be available or everyone.
