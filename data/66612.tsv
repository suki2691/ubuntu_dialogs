2009-04-05T11:14:00.000Z	bernz	error404notfound	it possible that it's showing that status for another network card which isn't connected; try double-clicking the icon for more, or right-clicking it, etc
2009-04-05T11:14:00.000Z	error404notfound	bernz	when I click "Connection information" it says no valid connections found..
2009-04-05T11:16:00.000Z	bernz	error404notfound	YMMV, but i had to erase the existing (default) profile in networkmanager, then create one (i use static IP) for my LAN connection.
