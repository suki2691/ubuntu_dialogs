2007-04-13T12:47:00.000Z	smg2k7		hello, i have a problem regarding beryl. When i minimize or restore a windows, there's a delay of 1 second (more or less), even if I deactivate any other effects. Everything else in beryl runs smoothly

2007-04-13T12:50:00.000Z	smg2k7	Shafto	did you found a solution to the minimize delay?
2007-04-13T12:50:00.000Z	Shafto	smg2k7	Umm  not really, just thought it could have something to do with my ram or grfx card
