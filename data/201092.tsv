2012-05-17T03:00:00.000Z	maheanuu		I have a question, would I be better off downloading Ubuntu 12.XX the one that is most stable of the new ones and replacing my 10.04.4 64 bit LTS  that I have installed at present
2012-05-17T03:01:00.000Z	vlt	maheanuu	Better than what?
2012-05-17T03:05:00.000Z	vlt	maheanuu	Well, “better” as in newer or more stable or easier to use or more suited for older machines or older users …?
2012-05-17T03:06:00.000Z	vlt	maheanuu	My suggestion would be: Install 12.04 to a separate area of the disk and try whether it works better for your needs. (It’s “vlt”, btw.)
