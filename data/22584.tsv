2010-12-14T02:02:00.000Z	halpp		Hi. I seem to have this recurring problem: my browsers seem to chew up more memory as time goes on, and they grey out (compiz) very often after a few hours. Shutting them down and restarting them again does not fix the issue. Is there something I can use to diagnose the problem?
