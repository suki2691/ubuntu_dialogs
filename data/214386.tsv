2006-07-05T10:04:00.000Z	Ares		Hello. I have, yet, another Terminal question which I don't understand from LinuxCommand. How do I go about giving everything in a directory r/w/e access to owner? Including all of its sub-directories and files? Would it be the recursive command? If so, I don't get how to use it. =( [Pleaase?]

2006-07-05T10:05:00.000Z	ljlolel	Ares	to only give the owner rwe access, use 700
