2009-06-12T04:06:00.000Z	bdizzle		hi, having a slight error with the package manager. it was doing an auto update and it froze in the middle of it
2009-06-12T04:07:00.000Z	bdizzle		I tried switching to command line, but it won't let me use "sudo apt-get install <package name>" stating that there is an administrative lock on it. Anyonek know how to get out of that lock?

2009-06-12T04:09:00.000Z	texasjack	bdizzle	a single log out may resolve if you can't catch the right process.
