2008-05-01T13:56:00.000Z	BadSneakers	J-_	  not what he was asking I don't think.   I got the idea he wanted an mp3 player when plugged up to be seen as just another flash drive, and it'd have to conform to mass storage specs for that to happen, and Ipod don't and sandisk do.
2008-05-01T13:57:00.000Z	J-_	BadSneakers	I figured since Rockbox is Open Source, and more than an MP3 player. I thought it would be able to be used as a mass storage device as well.
