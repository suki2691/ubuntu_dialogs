2006-07-14T10:40:00.000Z	akcom		When partitioning my drive for a dual boot system, do I make my "/boot" partition bootable or my "/" partition bootable?
2006-07-14T10:41:00.000Z	Spec	akcom	it depends, if you're putting grub in your MBR it doesn't matter
2006-07-14T10:42:00.000Z	akcom	Spec	if I didn't put grub on the MBR, I would put it on hda2 (my /boot partition) correct?
2006-07-14T10:43:00.000Z	Spec	akcom	good question, i always put grub in my MBR -- i would assume you would put it on your /boot partition though, and make that one bootable
