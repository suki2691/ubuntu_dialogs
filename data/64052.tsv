2010-05-25T23:33:00.000Z	xangua	lungan	or you could not have uninstalled anything and tell wine to use pulseaudio
2010-05-25T23:33:00.000Z	lungan	xangua	I did only have "OSS" in the menu, but do you know how to get back the sound on youtube etc?=
2010-05-25T23:35:00.000Z	xangua	lungan	try with flashplugin-nonfree.extrasound for OSS support
