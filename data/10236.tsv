2011-11-09T17:52:00.000Z	ispirto		hey, i have a bin file which contains a gzip file, i'm trying to get the gzip part from it. I know gzip files starts with "1F 8B 08". So I open the bin file with a hex editor and search for that string. And get the offset. Convert it to decimal and use it in dd command. i.e: dd if=openrg-4.5.3.PRGE4202G_TEL_4.3.2.0250-DRGTW_96358.rmt of=test.img.gz bs=1c skip=28437 But it doesn't work. What am I doing wrong?
