2006-03-26T11:50:00.000Z	frans		Problem: Used to use Debian sarge, mplayer with -vo xv worked fine. Switched to Ubuntu Dapper, installed Xgl and Compiz, now mplayer is sooo slow. with xv it cant even play a small xvid. Solution??
2006-03-26T11:51:00.000Z	Healot	frans	another problem, dapper + xgl are testing version
2006-03-26T11:52:00.000Z	frans	Healot	yes, but i think the problem is in the Xorg extensions...
2006-03-26T11:53:00.000Z	frans	Healot	mplayer says XFree86-VidModeExtension missing
