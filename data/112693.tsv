2010-11-12T20:11:00.000Z	mbeierl	evdvelde	according to https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page: While Btrfs is stable on a stable machine, it is currently possible to  corrupt a filesystem irrecoverably if your machine crashes
2010-11-12T20:13:00.000Z	evdvelde	mbeierl	that is not so good, since power failure is always possible or so :-) so perhaps not the best option yet?
2010-11-12T20:13:00.000Z	mbeierl	evdvelde	you got it.  ext4 is still the better all-around option
