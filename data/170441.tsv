2008-03-24T07:29:00.000Z	zachwlewis		Okay, time for a new query.
2008-03-24T07:30:00.000Z	zachwlewis		I have an nVidia 8800GT, and since I've installed it, I can't get any advanced graphics effects working. How can I install new drivers for it?
2008-03-24T07:32:00.000Z	zachwlewis		I installed some package from nVidia and have "use restricted drivers" checked, but it still doesn't work.
