2007-09-11T16:29:00.000Z	Javid		thanks
2007-09-11T05:20:00.000Z	Javid		OK, how do I make apt aware that I have firefox? I installed from a non-repos source and really don't want to mess with it
2007-09-11T05:20:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	Javid	why did you install from non-repos?
2007-09-11T05:20:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	Javid	and I think it automatically becomes aware if you use a .deb package, or else it... doesn't.
