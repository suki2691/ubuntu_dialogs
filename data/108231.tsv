2008-03-21T21:20:00.000Z	nikitis	MasterShrek	I never had any such problems before.  One weird thing I did notice though was usplash was trying to load with 1920x1440 and my monitor can't do that.  And I know i didn't set that resolution anywhere
2008-03-21T21:21:00.000Z	nikitis	MasterShrek	I used nvidia-xconfig.  No go
2008-03-21T21:21:00.000Z	vallhalla81	nikitis	from terminal use sudo nvidia-settings
