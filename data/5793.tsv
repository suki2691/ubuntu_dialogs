2012-02-19T13:59:00.000Z	CharminTheMoose		My /etc/issue isn't being read, an old /etc/issue keeps appearing at the login prompt for some reason. What did I mess up?
2012-02-19T14:00:00.000Z	gordon1234	CharminTheMoose	isn't it issue.net?
2012-02-19T14:01:00.000Z	CharminTheMoose	gordon1234	nope, /etc/issue is what I'm having a problem with.
