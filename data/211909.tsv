2005-10-18T06:57:00.000Z	ktogias	DShepherd	I dont see Firefox 1.5beta2 anywhere in the repositories... So i think you can't
2005-10-18T06:58:00.000Z	ktogias	DShepherd	but you can try the installer given from mozilla.org
2005-10-18T06:59:00.000Z	DShepherd	ktogias	Yeah I was thinking about that...I have had probs in the pass...oh well I give it a whirl
