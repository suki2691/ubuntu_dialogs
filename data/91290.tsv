2009-04-10T05:10:00.000Z	Anacranom	pokethesmot	is it "on"?
2009-04-10T05:13:00.000Z	Anacranom	pokethesmot	is this a laptop or a desktop
2009-04-10T05:15:00.000Z	Anacranom	pokethesmot	the reason i ask is because some laptop bios's do not turn on the wireless during the live cd install wich tells the bios to have it in the "off" state upon the first boot
