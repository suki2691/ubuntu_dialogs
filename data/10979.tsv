2012-02-12T23:54:00.000Z	administrator_		i'm new to ubuntu because i don't have money for windows
2012-02-12T23:54:00.000Z	administrator_		so it's probably a simple mistake
2012-02-12T23:56:00.000Z	administrator_		but uh i extract the file onto the desktop with ubuntu, and i try to run sudo ./install.sh
2012-02-12T23:56:00.000Z	urlin2u	administrator_	is whatever it is in a linux format?
