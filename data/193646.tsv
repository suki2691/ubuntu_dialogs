2006-06-17T14:54:00.000Z	JRW_		got a question. I have a desktop using FC5, but am setting up a server on an older pentium3. Would Ubuntu be a good choice (its mainly for mail, host a page or two, irc and ftp). Also, does Ubuntu use a package manager for installs/downloads, and a gui (I would be lost with console only)
2006-06-17T14:55:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	JRW_	you can use ubuntu (or really, any distro) for that. With ubuntu, I would recommend you install the 'server' build first, then only install what you need. Its a lot easier than installing the entire desktop, and then deleting stuff.
