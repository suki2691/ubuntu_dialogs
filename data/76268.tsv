2008-12-15T09:09:00.000Z	nbeebo	mdmkolbe	, im using gnome and it doesnt say, maybe because u have multiple users??
2008-12-15T09:10:00.000Z	mdmkolbe	nbeebo	yes, I have multiple users
2008-12-15T09:11:00.000Z	nbeebo	mdmkolbe	well, it isnt possible in the settings, but maybe in gconf, but thats really complicated...
