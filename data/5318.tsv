2012-05-21T04:06:00.000Z	vik_lo		so does anyone have any ideas, i have a very specific and funny problem. i set up a ubuntu server box to act as a router, dhcp server etc for my home network. now this seems to be working fine for different devices except my mobile phone, laptop via wlan, works like a charm. wlan via iphone works like a baws, ethernet to this computer no hickups, however my samsung galaxy s2 does not access internet over the same wlan
2012-05-21T04:07:00.000Z	vik_lo		i really hardly belive it is l3top it worked on the same setup with the same hardware when i simply was bridging my isp into the network, i.e isp was doing dhcp etc. not it does not with same gear. it must be a ubuntu setting
2012-05-21T04:08:00.000Z	L3top	vik_lo	can you connect your phone to another wlan to see?
2012-05-21T04:09:00.000Z	L3top	vik_lo	dhcp is dhcp is dhcp... if it is not picking up and address but everything else is... I mean... I cannot see how the dhcp server is the problem unless that mac has been specifically blacklisted for some reason
