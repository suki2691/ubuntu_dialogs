2010-10-26T09:26:00.000Z	Deigratia		any xiphos users here?\
2010-10-26T09:26:00.000Z	rww	Deigratia	I've used xiphos, yes.
2010-10-26T09:31:00.000Z	rww	Deigratia	hrm, odd. I haven't experienced that. Occasionally, xiphos got confused and I had to close it and reopen it, but verse selection hasn't been an issue for me.
2010-10-26T09:35:00.000Z	Deigratia	rww	thanks anyway!
