2008-02-16T08:11:00.000Z	EnderTheThird		This thing has a 2GHz P4 with 768MB RAM, and it just doesn't seem to run very well at all.
2008-02-16T08:12:00.000Z	EnderTheThird		Ubuntu.  I'm using Metacity too, not Compiz or anything crazy.  Firefox runs slow and it's just not running very well.  Win2k runs better on it.
2008-02-16T08:13:00.000Z	compwiz18	EnderTheThird	I have a laptop with a 1ghz cpu and 768mb ram, and it runs fine
