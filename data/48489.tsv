2010-05-19T22:44:00.000Z	gartral|p	Cynthia	I'm literally the only person in that channel I think. That's why I asked here...
2010-05-19T22:46:00.000Z	Cynthia	gartral|p	unless someone knows how to deal with LXDE (Lightweight X Desktop Environment) in here, I don't think you'll find your answer. For regular Ubuntu with GNOME it's System / Preferences / Network Proxy.
