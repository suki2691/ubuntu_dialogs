2009-11-21T05:36:00.000Z	gdiz		hey, I was wondering if anyone knows how to modify the "places" menu
2009-11-21T05:37:00.000Z	pennywise1968	gdiz	- I know you can edit ~/.gtk-bookmarks by hand but I don't know any other way.
2009-11-21T05:39:00.000Z	pennywise1968		you can right click anywhere in the list and tick the hidden files box too
