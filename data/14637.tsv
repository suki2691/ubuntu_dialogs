2012-04-22T23:09:00.000Z	Defusal		can anyone tell me what the recommended way to work with cpusets on ubuntu is? according to http://www.bullopensource.org/cpuset/cpuset.html debian has pcreate, pdestroy, pmod, pexec and pls commands, suse has a python util, but ubuntu has nothing... i also need to setup a bootcpuset, which suse has docs for, but ubuntus man pages say stuff like "SEE ALSO bootcpuset.conf(5), bootcpuset(8)",
2012-04-22T23:09:00.000Z	Defusal		yet the links are invalid and no such pages exist
