2007-06-03T15:25:00.000Z	xukun	haydnc	gnome
2007-06-03T15:26:00.000Z	haydnc	xukun	I've been using a nautilus script that's available in synaptic with some success: nautilus-script-audio-convert. As long as you've got the codecs installed which is easy enough to do it seems to do the job nicely
2007-06-03T15:27:00.000Z	xukun	haydnc	thanks a lot, but I think I will give soundKonverter a go, I can always reinstall things if I dont like how things look
