2009-12-27T18:02:00.000Z	Letter3		I think I have found a bug in the loading/rendering of Unicode in what seems to be a problem of an underlying engine in gnome. the problem is apparent in the text editor and geany, but not in OpenOffice. However, I don't have the time/accounts to report the bug. is anyone willing to test it?

2009-12-27T18:06:00.000Z	Letter3	BinaryMan	well, I have been to #ubuntu-bugs and they have to say the least not been very helpful and don't seem to care. so why should I? let them figure it out.
