2007-04-22T10:09:00.000Z	AzMoo		Hey, after updating to feisty I can no longer see my ntfs partitions. I run 'sudo mount /media/hdd1' it tells me that /dev/hdd1 does not exist.
2007-04-22T10:10:00.000Z	AlexC_	AzMoo	it'll be sd instead of hd now
2007-04-22T10:10:00.000Z	AlexC_	AzMoo	Feisty uses a different driver and all drives are now SD instead of HD and/or SD
2007-04-22T10:10:00.000Z	AzMoo	AlexC_	oh, ok. thanks.
