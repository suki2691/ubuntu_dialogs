2006-09-18T16:07:00.000Z	Quaggo		i was wondering if there is anyone who could answer a couple questions for me, I am having trouble using ubuntu for the first time...
2006-09-18T16:08:00.000Z	Quaggo		well, i have tried to get the live cd to boot successfully on two different machines now, both with no success
2006-09-18T16:08:00.000Z	DaveyJ	Quaggo	maybe the burn went bad?
