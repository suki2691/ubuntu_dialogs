2007-04-16T05:28:00.000Z	inflex		I'm confused... gcc is installed on my ubuntu setup... (desktop, 6.10) but I can't seem to /compile/ anything without it bitterly complaining about underfined fn's and a zillion other things
2007-04-16T05:29:00.000Z	inflex		what else do I need to apt-get in order to have a properly functioning 'C compiler' under ubuntu?
2007-04-16T05:29:00.000Z	rasputnik	inflex	you need 'build-essential' - you also need header files for the libraries you're trying to build with
2007-04-16T05:29:00.000Z	inflex	rasputnik	okay, thankyou
