2009-03-09T23:44:00.000Z	tw1tch	Dr_willis	I know thats what i thought when i read it too.. but it does mount the boot partition read only dosent it that could help prevent corruption??
2009-03-09T23:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tw1tch	 i doubt if its going to help much.. and then whenever ya get a kernel update. you have to rember to remount it readwrite.. makes it a hassle.
