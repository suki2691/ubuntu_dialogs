2011-07-28T00:57:00.000Z	AaronDCampbell		Is there a log that shows what packages were recently updated?
2011-07-28T00:58:00.000Z	AaronDCampbell		I use Update Manager in Gnome for all my updates if that makes a difference
2011-07-28T01:00:00.000Z	Polah	AaronDCampbell	/var/log/apt/history.log should show recent changes from apt.
2011-07-28T01:02:00.000Z	AaronDCampbell	Polah	and rww: Thanks.  Looks like I got libqtcore4 since my last reboot...so that explains it.
