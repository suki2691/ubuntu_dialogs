2008-06-22T09:50:00.000Z	siavash_		quick question: I always get a grub 22 error when booting if I have an external hard/flash drive plugged in, is there a way to fix this?
2008-06-22T09:52:00.000Z	siavash_		has anyone had this problem where you get a grub error 22 when booting with an external hard/flash drive plugged in?
2008-06-22T09:52:00.000Z	chr0n1c	siavash_	unplug the drive when you boot
2008-06-22T09:53:00.000Z	chr0n1c	siavash_	 i'm sure there is a fix, i'd jsut uplug the drive though
