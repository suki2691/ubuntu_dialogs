2009-02-19T05:18:00.000Z	szrhawaii		im trying to get the gui for xmms to work on my desktop but not sure how any help on this
2009-02-19T05:20:00.000Z	szrhawaii		sorry it is xmms2
2009-02-19T05:21:00.000Z	tyrosine2	szrhawaii	audacious is the way to go, not xmms2
2009-02-19T05:21:00.000Z	tyrosine2	szrhawaii	just apt-get install it, it'll perform just like xmms used to
