2011-08-07T18:32:00.000Z	coz_	acicula	  scroll down a bit to  "Installing to  efi" you will see this    Ubuntu 11.04 has an extremely serious bug that causes it to erase any existing ESP, thus wiping out any existing boot loaders or other files installed there. Be sure to back up your ESP before you install Ubuntu to a (U)EFI system!
