2007-08-15T09:42:00.000Z	Fayte		Hey, i got a question. is there a way i can write a script or something so that when my comp starts up it automatically unmounts a drive?
2007-08-15T09:42:00.000Z	dystopianray	Fayte	is this drive listed in /etc/fstab?
2007-08-15T09:43:00.000Z	dystopianray	Fayte	give it an fstab entry with the 'noauto' option
2007-08-15T09:43:00.000Z	dystopianray	Fayte	man fstab
