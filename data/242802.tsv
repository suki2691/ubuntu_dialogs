2005-05-21T09:40:00.000Z	g14	thundrcleeze	search for gstreamer0.8-plugins in synaptix. You might also search for divx and install them both
2005-05-21T09:42:00.000Z	thundrcleeze	g14	I've already got it.
2005-05-21T09:44:00.000Z	g14	thundrcleeze	installing the divx stuff from synaptic made divx and xvid work perfectly for me, sorry
