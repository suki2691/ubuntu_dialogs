2007-06-29T10:20:00.000Z	dustin		This is probably a basic question, but I'm having trouble installing Ubuntu 7.04 Desktop because after the initial menu it switches to a graphics mode my monitor does not support. I've tried a changing the resolution, but I think the problem is that it needs to be 60hz. Anyone know how to set this?
