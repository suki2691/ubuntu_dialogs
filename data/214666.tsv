2005-10-17T15:57:00.000Z	psycode		Hello, I've updated from hoary to breezy (using apt-get) and now I'm experiencing some problems. mainly, the system can't find some icons (like the gnome-home icon) and also nautilus looks really ugly (icons again) -- any ideas ?

2005-10-17T15:59:00.000Z	psycode	Hendric	can't i apt-get it
2005-10-17T16:01:00.000Z	psycode	Hendric	is that something new ? (btw - what version of gnome does breezy have ?)
