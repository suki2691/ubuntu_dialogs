2008-04-16T17:23:00.000Z	unop	ggrunt	it's /etc/rc.local - but first, do you want to start this app as root or as the user?
2008-04-16T17:24:00.000Z	ggrunt	unop	as root I would assume.
2008-04-16T17:25:00.000Z	unop	ggrunt	well, be sure -- if it's an application that needs your interaction (a GUI app for e.g.) then it shouldnt go in there, if it's a one-off command that start a system service, then sure
