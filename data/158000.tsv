2009-02-01T03:48:00.000Z	Slart	mic_lovin	ubuntu is designed to use sudo/gksudo to do root tasks.. check the man pages for more options
2009-02-01T03:50:00.000Z	Slart	mic_lovin	several ways to do that.. EDITOR=gedit sudoedit /whateever/file/you/want/to.edit
2009-02-01T03:51:00.000Z	Slart	mic_lovin	or gksudo gedit file.. but I think sudoedit is the safest way.. not that I've had any problems usind gksudo gedit.. but it might (once every ten years or so) mess things up
