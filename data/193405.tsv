2011-04-28T11:06:00.000Z	kaatta		ive tried xubuntu, and lubuntu, and had high hopes for lubuntu but lxde seems to be lacking too much that im used to with ubuntu
2011-04-28T11:07:00.000Z	kaatta		Andre_Gondim, im on lubuntu now, i have been sitting in #lubuntu for 5 days asking for help getting a composite manager running (google is no help at all)
