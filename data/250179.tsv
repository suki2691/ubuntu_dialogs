2006-04-16T16:10:00.000Z	sebastianmares		Hey guys, I recently downloaded the Flight 4, 5 and 6 CDs and all of them failed to start X.org. Any idea why? I have an ATI Radeon 9600 AGP card that works fine with 5.10.
2006-04-16T16:10:00.000Z	apokryphos	sebastianmares	what's the error output?
2006-04-16T16:11:00.000Z	apokryphos	sebastianmares	no need to download ISOs btw, you can upgrade straight from your 5.10
2006-04-16T16:12:00.000Z	apokryphos	sebastianmares	can't do much without the exact error output
