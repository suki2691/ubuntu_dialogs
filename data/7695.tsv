2011-11-19T03:37:00.000Z	Jonii		Like, lemme share you my plight: I've been looking for information about Linux user system for a week now. I've been asking here, I've been reading several wiki articles about that, and asking on other irc channels. Only yesterday I was finally told what users _ARE_ in Linux. No one had that written down anywhere I could find
