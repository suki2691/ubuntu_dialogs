2009-06-20T00:03:00.000Z	packet-sent		I set up Ubuntu 9.04 using the Alternative CD lvm/encryption so that i have to enter a pass-phrase at boot time, everything worked as expected untill the latest kernel upgrade now when I boot I am not asked for the pass-phrase and obviously the machine will not boot as it cannot find root, anyone know anything about this issue?
2009-06-20T00:05:00.000Z	deany	packet-sent	I try not to do kernel upgrades, for reasons like that.  Its pretty pathetic how it breaks so much stuff.  Sorry I cant help
2009-06-20T00:06:00.000Z	deany	packet-sent	can you still boot to the old kernel? should be an option for it still
