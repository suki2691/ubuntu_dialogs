2007-05-27T08:50:00.000Z	Lhademmor		Hello please help: I want to start firefox, but it says it's already running... How can I find "running applications" and shut down invisible firefox?
2007-05-27T08:52:00.000Z	Lhademmor		"firefox: no process killed"...?
2007-05-27T08:52:00.000Z	lolman	Lhademmor	do the same for firefox-bin
2007-05-27T08:53:00.000Z	lolman	Lhademmor	you don't need the end bit, just killall firefox-bin
