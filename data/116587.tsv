2007-10-18T00:16:00.000Z	ColonelPanic45		How can I use the stock Ubuntu 7.04 LiveCD to partition the drive on my laptop?  I got a 'device busy' error when I tried to run GParted, which I assume is beacause the LiveCD is mounting the drive (??)
2007-10-18T00:18:00.000Z	Spitty	ColonelPanic45	there's also a gparted live cd that has only gparted on it
2007-10-18T00:18:00.000Z	Spitty		which has worked well for me in the past
2007-10-18T00:19:00.000Z	ColonelPanic45	Spitty	yeah, I know that, but I was trying to avoid burning more plastic... :-)
