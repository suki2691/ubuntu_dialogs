2012-05-19T00:39:00.000Z	beandog	_raven	dunno about making one, but you can find a few .. audacious has a plugin for it, ffplay does it by default, etc.
2012-05-19T00:40:00.000Z	_raven	beandog	must be exactly from a special audio file. any way to use the visualizer-plugins of any audio player for any generator?
2012-05-19T00:41:00.000Z	beandog	_raven	I'm not following you, and I'm not really audio-savvy either
