2009-11-02T19:17:00.000Z	gnuisancev5		i am unable to do any updates on my Jaunty box.. apt-get update gives a "Failed to Fetch" line for each repo and then states "Some index files failed to download, they have been ignored, or old ones used instead.".  Changing Software Sources doesn't help either.  I've tried over 10 different servers now.
