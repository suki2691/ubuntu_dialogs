2012-08-19T10:13:00.000Z	Treaver		Does anyone know how I can get a messenger like in Fedora. Like if I'm talking to someone it will popup a notification and I can reply in that notification
2012-08-19T10:15:00.000Z	Treaver		Like in fedora the notifcation pops up on bottom and I can click on it and reply from there
2012-08-19T10:16:00.000Z	crimsonmane	Treaver	maybe get in the fedora irc and ask them what that is.
