2007-05-07T08:47:00.000Z	kylefox		I have a simple question:we're looking to set up a Ubuntu server at work, just for FTP and possibly a test webserver.  The box will not be used for spreadsheets, word processing, etc.  However, none of us are familiar enough with linux to work strictly from a command line, so we need gnome.  Should we get desktop, or server edition?

2007-05-07T08:51:00.000Z	Jowi	kylefox	seriously though. if you have a reasonably decent machine (minimum 192MB ram, 6gb hdd) go with the desktop cd or alternate cd.
2007-05-07T08:52:00.000Z	Jowi	kylefox	the server cd does not install gnome (or xorg for that matter) by default. so if you want a quick way to just test use the desktop one.
