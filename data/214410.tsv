2005-10-14T08:39:00.000Z	lore_		Hi. I have a quick question. have just started using ubuntu so am very new. we have a creative soundblaster live card trough dell and we get no sound.
2005-10-14T08:40:00.000Z	lore_		have given up trying to figure it out and need to know what sound cards will work with linux.

2005-10-14T08:40:00.000Z	lore_	pl_ice	we went through all of that and i believe it's because it is not a creative card. you know can only update drivers through dell
