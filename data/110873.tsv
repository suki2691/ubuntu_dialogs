2012-07-11T00:02:00.000Z	Hilikus		hey guys
2012-07-11T00:03:00.000Z	Hilikus		i installed ubuntu desktop on a computer with very few memory because i didn't have an ubuntu server disk with me, what can i do to turn it into something more server-like? i want to start by uninstalling all the gnome crap
2012-07-11T00:03:00.000Z	Hilikus		i found some posts saying to do sudo apt-get remove gnome-desktop but that doesn't seem to work on 12.04
