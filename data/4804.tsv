2012-04-27T01:32:00.000Z	upset		I checked the iso before and after I wrote it to usb. The disk check error I have says there's a bad checksum for ./install/netboot/ubuntu-installer/i386/pxelinux.cfg/default    What can I do?
2012-04-27T01:33:00.000Z	EvilResistance	upset	redownload the image and rewrite it to the USB stick
2012-04-27T01:33:00.000Z	upset	EvilResistance	I have done that over and over all day
2012-04-27T01:35:00.000Z	upset	EvilResistance	I have used all the downloads available, dd, unetbootin, and startup disk creator to write it, and checked the md5 checksum four different ways (it's good right until I try the disk integrity check from the live drive itself)
