2012-09-14T14:47:00.000Z	blackshirt	lionrouge	why just 33 mb?
2012-09-14T14:48:00.000Z	blackshirt	lionrouge	some on ubuntu default, with one kernel, 33 mb was enough for your /boot...
2012-09-14T14:51:00.000Z	blackshirt	lionrouge	one kernel image on ubuntu was about 24 mb in size... You should sure ... 33mb would not fit to install second kernel
