2009-01-02T20:39:00.000Z	chazco		Hi... how can I mount an SFTP or FTP location in Ubuntu? Nautilus shows the root folder but doesnt redirect to the suitable folder. s/ftp from the terminal work as expected however.

2009-01-02T20:41:00.000Z	chazco	dan	- I'm considering trying to get Office 07 to install under cross-over, but would prefer OO to work. Need to be able to edit btw.
