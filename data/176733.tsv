2006-07-03T15:10:00.000Z	Cntryboy		Ya'll, all the programs I downloaded from apt-get where does it store these programs? I want to back up all the programs and burn them on a disc because im going to format and use kubuntu instead, and I can't afford to lose what I have because with 2.1KB dialup it takes sooo long to redownload..
