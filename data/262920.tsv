2008-08-03T02:52:00.000Z	pscho		I'm trying to get a dual monitor display going using ATIConfig. I have fglrx installed and all the pre-reqs (at least I think!) and X keeps freezing when I reach the login screen. Anyone have any ideas on what could be going wrong? I can provide the commands I'm using.
2008-08-03T02:53:00.000Z	pscho		also, is there a utility with similar functionality to "device manager" in windows?
2008-08-03T02:53:00.000Z	t35t0r	pscho	there are several
2008-08-03T02:53:00.000Z	t35t0r	pscho	"lspci" "lshw", "gtk-lshw"
