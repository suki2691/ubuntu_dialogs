2007-09-11T13:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	anonymouse	gksu and gksudo are graphical, and may have some subtle difference that I can't detect
2007-09-11T13:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	anonymouse	su allows you to actually switch your UID to that of another user (most commonly root)
2007-09-11T13:03:00.000Z	gordonjcp	anonymouse	and sudo allows you to run a command as another user, again most commonly root
