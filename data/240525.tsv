2005-04-24T16:03:00.000Z	queuetue	procrastinator	Agreed.  just like the kernel, or X.

2005-04-24T16:05:00.000Z	queuetue	procrastinator	No, Free Software is the philosophy. GNU is a set of utilities.  Don't preach Stallman to me - I've met the guy multiple times, and he's insulted me via email personally. :)
