2010-02-15T00:19:00.000Z	fbc-mx		Is there anything that will batch normalize mp3 files? Maybe a rythmbox plugin or a seperate app?

2010-02-15T00:21:00.000Z	fbc-mx	ZykoticK9	only does wav files
2010-02-15T00:23:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	fbc-mx	actually if you install that package you'll find the command "normalize-mp3"
