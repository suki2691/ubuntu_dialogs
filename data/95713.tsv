2008-10-04T21:04:00.000Z	[T]ank		hey folks, I have been on the 32 bit version of ubuntu for a while and have had my scanner working with no problem. now that i have upgraded computers and have gone 64 bit, when trying to connect to my hp psc 2110 i get the message, "failed to open device 'hpaio:/net/PSC_2100_series?ip=192.168.1.20': Device busy. any ideas?
