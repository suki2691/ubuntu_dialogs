2010-06-15T14:36:00.000Z	piko	pip	yes, but forget about hibernation
2010-06-15T14:49:00.000Z	piko	pip	I dod not follow the whole chat, but what should be usually sufficient for linux distro is 1) to build a swap partition by mkswap, 2) set it in /etc/fstab, 3) label partition by fdisk as linux partition
