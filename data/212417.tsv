2010-04-22T17:21:00.000Z	Olejo		Some advice please, I am installing ubuntu and want to run other linux distributions on the HD, do I need to partition the HD when installing to do this?

2010-04-22T17:22:00.000Z	syli725	Olejo	IdleOne is right. / has to be different. swap can be the same.
2010-04-22T17:25:00.000Z	syli725	Olejo	to install a linux, at minimum, you need to have / and swap the two partitions. /home and /boot etc.. can all be under / partition. To simple the answer. / has to be in different partition. swap can be shared.
