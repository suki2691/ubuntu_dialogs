2010-02-05T02:35:00.000Z	plitter		how do i connect between 2 computers that has ubuntu?? i tried rightclicking and then share folder without having to have an account, but i still didnt find it on my other ubuntu computer. I used nautilus and just clicked on the network... and nothing came up there, which is weird because it usually finds windows computers on the network and i know the network was up and running...
