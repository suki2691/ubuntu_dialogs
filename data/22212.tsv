2011-01-14T21:54:00.000Z	xil		hello. I'm having a problem connecting to an Open WEP wireless network using Wicd + Ubuntu 10.10 + wmii. Could someone help me out?
2011-01-14T21:55:00.000Z	xil		willis: if I do know what ad-hoc networks are, and I think I do, then the answer is no, it's a standard setup from my wireless router to a verizon fiber line
2011-01-14T21:56:00.000Z	xil		dr_willis: what's interesting is that it works just fine using the default desktop environment, just not wmii
2011-01-14T21:57:00.000Z	sam-_-	xil	how doesn't it work? any error messages?
