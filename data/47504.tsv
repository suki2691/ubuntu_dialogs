2010-01-23T12:25:00.000Z	abumaia		I'm a relatively new linux user, been mucking about with ubuntu for about 2 weeks now.  Do I need to be looking at any antivirus and firewall programs?

2010-01-23T12:25:00.000Z	theadmin	abumaia	Quite as any Linux system
2010-01-23T12:26:00.000Z	theadmin	abumaia	Depending on whether you want them or not :D
