2009-03-01T01:20:00.000Z	hunt577		Anyone have any advice regarding ubuntu installation?  Have burnt the image onto a CD-R but when I go into Windows Boot System after pressing Delete on startup the only option I have is Windows Vista and Ubuntu is not listed

2009-03-01T01:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	hunt577	enter your bios setup and change boot order... or enter into the boot menu (it may be one in you bios) and boot from the cdrom
