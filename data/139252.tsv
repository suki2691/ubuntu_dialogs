2008-06-06T19:17:00.000Z	jcaspe		I still have a problem about shifting to ubuntu with regards to industry strength softwares... For example, We're using dreamweaver, flash, and photoshop at school. I there any way I can run this programs in ubuntu?
2008-06-06T19:17:00.000Z	jcaspe		I've noticed that photoshop cs2 is working well in ubuntu but flash and dreamweaver are not...
