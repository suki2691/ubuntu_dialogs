2012-01-31T01:51:00.000Z	entel		ive heard its a bad idea to set roots shell to bash, can anyone explain why?
2012-01-31T01:53:00.000Z	schnuffle	entel	because if you have /usr as seperate partitions and you run into problems you can't login anymore
2012-01-31T01:57:00.000Z	entel	schnuffle	is that the only reason?
2012-01-31T01:58:00.000Z	schnuffle	entel	as far as I know. You can move bash to /sbin to sovle that problem
