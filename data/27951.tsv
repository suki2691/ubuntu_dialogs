2010-08-02T12:38:00.000Z	karen_m		I am going to try and drop ever using windows 7 again.  Other than games, is there any reason to go back.. well maybe adobe photoshop?

2010-08-02T12:41:00.000Z	karen_m		when installing 'wine', should I always try and update through the Ubuntu Software Centre or should I go to winehq.org or whatever it is?
2010-08-02T12:41:00.000Z	karen_m	koshari1	how do you run a windows vm machine?
