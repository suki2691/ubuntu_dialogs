2009-03-01T13:07:00.000Z	bamhm182		I know for a fact that it does exist
2009-03-01T13:08:00.000Z	natschil	bamhm182	you need to make the file executable (e.g. "chmod 755 /path/to/file")
2009-03-01T13:22:00.000Z	natschil	bamhm182	well, I wouldn't think that you can just "execute" random files from the iphone, as you'll probably need the iphone kernel to do this.
