2012-02-04T21:42:00.000Z	Antigone3010		I'd like to reduce my screen resolution, but keeping the same "precision" : i mean, adding "crop bars" around the screen
2012-02-04T21:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	Antigone3010	 ive seen some monitor settings have it where it either zooms less then native res. or displays it as is. with black bars around the image.
2012-02-04T21:44:00.000Z	Antigone3010	dr_willis	knjiga : i am on a laptop... I used to have that option on windows (nvidia drivers) but haven't found anything here
