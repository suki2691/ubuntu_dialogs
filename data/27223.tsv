2012-02-26T00:54:00.000Z	Oer	Stava	is there a FN key to switch external monitor ?
2012-02-26T00:54:00.000Z	Stava	Oer	actually there seems to be a monitor-icon on one of the FN-combination keys
2012-02-26T00:56:00.000Z	Oer	Stava	that could be a help, maybe you need to switch before disconnecting ... and plugout after turning off the monitor, could also help
2012-02-26T00:56:00.000Z	Stava	Oer	Currently I just managed to unplug the monitor with no issues (happens 1 in 100 times), but i'll definitely try your method next time the problem arises. Thanks!
