2006-04-23T09:53:00.000Z	Tedd		Hi, can anyone help me? I want to install Windows but I know it overwrites the MBR
2006-04-23T09:53:00.000Z	Tedd		Does anyone know how to install Windows without it overwriting GRUB?
2006-04-23T09:53:00.000Z	Tedd		Or even if there's a way to install Windows without overwriting GRUB?
