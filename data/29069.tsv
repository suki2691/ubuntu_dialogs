2010-07-14T12:31:00.000Z	iantlopp		I'm trying to find the install director of a windows program run through Wine... been searching for about 20 minutes now without even finding any references to Wine. Where would "Program Files" be?
2010-07-14T12:32:00.000Z	tech2077	iantlopp	look in .wine folder
2010-07-14T12:33:00.000Z	tech2077	iantlopp	it's ~/.wine
2010-07-14T12:34:00.000Z	iantlopp	tech2077	heh.. just found it when I looked under Browse C: :)
