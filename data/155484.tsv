2007-01-20T09:10:00.000Z	StraightShooter		ok... back
2007-01-20T09:11:00.000Z	StraightShooter		right now, in order to get it to work... i have to plug the monitor into the DVI port, using a dvi to hd15 adaptor... and restart x... after a few minutes, the tty will come up and tell me that X crashed.  Then I switch the cable back and type (blind) startx... and it comes up correctly
2007-01-20T09:13:00.000Z	StraightShooter		anyone have any other ideas other than disabling composite?
