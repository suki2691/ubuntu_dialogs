2007-07-21T06:54:00.000Z	_rd_	Newbie_Dude	  /usr/bin/vmware-uninstall.pl will do the trick
2007-07-21T06:56:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	_rd_	thanks, i dont have a reason to uninstall it yet, but just incase I'll do that :)
2007-07-21T07:02:00.000Z	_rd_	Newbie_Dude	be sure to chk /etc/vmware after unistall to be sure all the files are removed
