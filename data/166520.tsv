2007-12-10T19:47:00.000Z	sean__		I'm trying to install the drivers for my Netgear WG311v3 wireless PCI adapter. It says it wraps it ok, but when I ndiswrapper -l it says wg311v3 : invalid driver!
2007-12-10T19:47:00.000Z	wols_	sean__	what chip is this netgear using?
2007-12-10T19:48:00.000Z	wols_	sean__	lspci
2007-12-10T19:58:00.000Z	wols_	sean__	no since I don't have a marvell chip
