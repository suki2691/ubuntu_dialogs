2009-02-26T07:06:00.000Z	devilsF00d		Hi I'm having some serious issues I switched internet providers today and I just got my servers back online but I'm having some sever slowness connecting to my webserver intermittently... I've also been getting lots of log messages on my router saying that it blocked packet ... blah blah  wrong network interface (IP address spoofing)... This goes away as soon as I take the ubuntu server off the network
2009-02-26T07:08:00.000Z	n8tuserf	devilsF00d	-> how does the ubuntu host come into the picture? perhaps you can explain what you are hosting on? and what the network layout is like?
2009-02-26T07:18:00.000Z	n8tuserf	devilsF00d	-> perhaps  a drawing of the layout would be easier to follow, put as much info on it so we can sort out and trace where the packet goes trhough and mention were is the firewalling in it too
2009-02-26T07:21:00.000Z	n8tuserf	devilsF00d	-> just a box, and a label it as router or switch or whatever is enuff
