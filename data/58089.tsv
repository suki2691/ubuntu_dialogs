2009-06-21T06:03:00.000Z	jefinc	boogyDown987	I use Konversation as it is similar to mIRC
2009-06-21T06:05:00.000Z	jefinc	boogyDown987	hmm that may be true, I think you have to actually know the server you want to connect to
2009-06-21T06:06:00.000Z	jefinc	boogyDown987	but you could always reference to here: http://www.mirc.com/servers.html
