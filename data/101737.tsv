2008-02-01T18:22:00.000Z	K_Nine	jrib	Thanks. I now have Konversation set up and I don't see the constant join/part notifications. I really like that, which I couldn't figure out how to do in X-Chat Gnome.
2008-02-01T18:23:00.000Z	jrib	K_Nine	it's possible (but I don't know how offhand)
2008-02-01T18:24:00.000Z	K_Nine	jrib	 Plus you can control so much more in Konverstion.
2008-02-01T18:24:00.000Z	jrib	K_Nine	k, everyone should use what they like of course.  Glad you got it to work
