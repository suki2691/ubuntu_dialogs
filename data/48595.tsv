2009-10-18T01:32:00.000Z	Pyrophelia		2 questions please:  Is it possible to run some kind of virtual machine ontop of osx 10.5 or 10.6 so I can have Ubuntu and windows 7 on seperate monitors?  If there is no such thing, how is mac version of Ubuntu these days?  Last time I tried it the drivers were lagging
