2009-12-08T01:19:00.000Z	Trizicus		I have noticed that my BIND DNS server is not caching anything. Do I need to specify a cache directory/location in options?

2009-12-08T01:19:00.000Z	Trizicus	daftykins	I dont know how to do that :P
2009-12-08T01:20:00.000Z	daftykins	Trizicus	oh i see, look up the docs on the site then, i'm not sure off hand
