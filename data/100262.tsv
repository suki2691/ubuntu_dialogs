2008-03-06T04:23:00.000Z	mad_max02		can I remove evolution from my system ?? when I try to remove it with synaptics it requests to remove some other files that I dont know if they are important

2008-03-06T04:36:00.000Z	mad_max02	dxdt	hope ur right. I removed everything that has something to do with evolution
2008-03-06T04:37:00.000Z	dxdt	mad_max02	I'm pretty sure I've removed it in the past on a different release of Ubuntu so I'm pretty sure it is OK.
