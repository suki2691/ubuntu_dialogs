2008-04-09T21:30:00.000Z	perpetual		Hello people. Is there any command or program that can do automatic reconfiguration when you change the hardware? Such as when I move a harddisk with ubuntu to another machine, or when I install a general ubuntu image that then must be adapted to the present video-card, sound chips, ethernet card etc.?
