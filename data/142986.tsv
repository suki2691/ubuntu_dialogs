2008-10-15T06:15:00.000Z	sammyF	MetalHeadDead	it's a site from which you can get software that isn't necessary in the repository. The URL is http://www.getdeb.net/
2008-10-15T06:15:00.000Z	sammyF	MetalHeadDead	but I just checked. Open Office 3.0 for Hardy 32bit ain't there (yet). Gimp 2.6.1 is though :)
2008-10-15T06:17:00.000Z	sammyF	MetalHeadDead	put him/it on your ignore list. I'm no op btw :)
