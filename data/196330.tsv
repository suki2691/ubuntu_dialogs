2009-12-16T05:38:00.000Z	Nooneshere		Jonzbcc: One last question sadly, where do i put it? Anywhere or at the top or bottom?
2009-12-16T05:39:00.000Z	phantomcircuit	Nooneshere	btw i suspect that what you want is `grub-install --recheck --install`
2009-12-16T05:41:00.000Z	phantomcircuit	Nooneshere	dont edit the grub menu manually get grub-install to recheck for new OSs
