2006-06-03T09:18:00.000Z	BlueLaguna		I suggest you create a small root partition and make it reiser
2006-06-03T09:18:00.000Z	BlueLaguna		reiser is best for small text files such as system files
2006-06-03T09:18:00.000Z	skippy81	BlueLaguna	do you think a reiserfs root will be faster than an XFS root?
