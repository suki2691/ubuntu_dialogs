2004-09-27T05:51:00.000Z	Puumba	jdub	There are two main mirroring organization here at Purdue (csociety.org and cerias).  ftp.cerias.purdue.edu is an official debian mirror.  Would that be the preferred choice if we have to choose only 1?
2004-09-27T05:52:00.000Z	jdub	Puumba	hrm, probably a choice for the mirror maintainer
2004-09-27T05:54:00.000Z	Puumba	jdub	I've contacted both, but they may like to host mutually exclusive archives.  I'll wait and see how they respond.
