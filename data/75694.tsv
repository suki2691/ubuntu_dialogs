2008-11-06T07:58:00.000Z	nintendork87	Skry^	idk what they do
2008-11-06T07:59:00.000Z	Skry^	nintendork87	they are terminals which are running in background, and using a predefined key like F12 you can show/hide them.
2008-11-06T08:19:00.000Z	Skry^	nintendork87	first terminal, then screen, then the stuff you want to run on background, then ctrl+a+d
