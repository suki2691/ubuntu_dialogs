2012-01-31T06:53:00.000Z	bite		I have a locked folder on a hard drive, titled "lost+found.' How can I access it?
2012-01-31T06:55:00.000Z	bite		sudo cd <filepath> doesn't work for me.
2012-01-31T06:55:00.000Z	hydrox24	bite	me neither
2012-01-31T06:55:00.000Z	hydrox24	bite	log in as root (sudo -i) then just cd <dir>
