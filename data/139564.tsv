2008-11-02T02:55:00.000Z	HorizonXP	K_Dallas	That's what I usually do, but i was hoping for a more automated way of doing it. this is my cousin's backed up data, i have no idea what it is, nor should i be looking through her files
2008-11-02T02:56:00.000Z	K_Dallas	HorizonXP	I am really no expert in bash scripting but listing with sort option the folders where the files are and then piping it through the isomaker (forget the command name) and then burning the resulted iso on DVDs, one after another, something like that ;)
2008-11-02T02:57:00.000Z	HorizonXP	K_Dallas	yeah, that's what i'd do... but i need to back these up soon, don't ahve time to pile through man pages to figure out how to do that
