2012-06-18T04:15:00.000Z	Trian3		I'm having trouble installing Flash.  Upon trying to install it via Adobe's site, I get the error, "protocol (apt) isn't associated with any program"  Further, if you go to Preferences/Applications, there's no content Type associated with the apt.  Anyone know how to fix this?
