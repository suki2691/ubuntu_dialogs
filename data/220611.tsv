2012-03-05T19:31:00.000Z	ChesterX		hey, i was wondering whether there was a tool that could show the current up/down load rate of the computer? (i am using an umts stick an really need to watch my "consumption")

2012-03-05T19:34:00.000Z	sirlark	ChesterX	otherwise, Gnome, KDE and XFCE (and presumably other DEs) have widgets for their panels which track network up/down rates in real time
2012-03-05T19:34:00.000Z	sirlark	ChesterX	but the best I've ever come across for your purposes was gkrellm's network monitor
