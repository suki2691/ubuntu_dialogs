2010-02-19T04:13:00.000Z	Roasted	Sensiva	but if I remove the PPA and just apt-get firefox (after removing it) would I grab the repo version then?
2010-02-19T04:14:00.000Z	Roasted	Sensiva	good deal. WOuld I lose firefox bookmarks and whatnot in this process?
2010-02-19T04:15:00.000Z	Roasted	Sensiva	always. thanks!
