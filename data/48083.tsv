2010-06-28T05:25:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	Alan502	I use Tor
2010-06-28T05:25:00.000Z	Alan502	Black_Phantom	good :) it's just that i can't configure squid to allow connections that are not web, for example IRC
2010-06-28T05:27:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	Alan502	I barely made it to work on web lol never used Tor on IRC, sorry !
