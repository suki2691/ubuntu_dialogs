2007-12-14T23:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	vg05	 install the nvidia drivers, then use the nvidia tools.
2007-12-14T23:42:00.000Z	vg05	Dr_willis	did that, every time i reboot ubuntu says im in low-graphics mode
2007-12-14T23:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	vg05	 reconfigure the X server after installing the drivers perhaps.
