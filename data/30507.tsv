2012-03-20T06:06:00.000Z	ntr0py	Jon--	there are a few more available with gnome-tweak-tool
2012-03-20T06:07:00.000Z	Jon--	ntr0py	is that what we have to resort to using now to modify Ubuntu settings?
2012-03-20T06:09:00.000Z	ntr0py	Jon--	I hope they will improve settings, e.g. there are no text rendering options which i would consider basic enough to be in system settings (as they were in gnome 2)
2012-03-20T06:09:00.000Z	Jon--	ntr0py	This is a Gnome3 issue not a Ubuntu one correct?
