2010-08-17T18:35:00.000Z	gentooxer	ascheel	that wasn't the point
2010-08-17T18:38:00.000Z	ascheel	gentooxer	you're missing the point here.  His GPU can handle video processing, assuming it's a supported codec (which flash is)
2010-08-17T18:39:00.000Z	ascheel	gentooxer	the issue is finding out why the video players are not passing that duty off to the GPU and are instead relying on the CPU
