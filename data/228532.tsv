2006-01-23T15:19:00.000Z	mihai_	hubbadub	no
2006-01-23T15:19:00.000Z	mihai_	hubbadub	because I have ubuntu, not kubuntu. if it's good I'l install it now
2006-01-23T15:26:00.000Z	mihai_	hubbadub	this is my problem too. just that I am not yet able so use gtkpod because I must convert the backup of most aac files to mp3
