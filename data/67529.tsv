2010-12-24T09:13:00.000Z	shingen	deww	yup, thanks... just got confirm from the guys over at #transmission that transmission-daemon is what i"m lookign for
2010-12-24T09:14:00.000Z	deww	shingen	and up and until now, i didn't know there's a cli version :P been using rtorrent
2010-12-24T09:15:00.000Z	shingen	deww	I head that rtorrent can be a pig when doing multiple threads, so I've stayed away from that...
