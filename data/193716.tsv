2006-07-26T12:02:00.000Z	tgk		im running ubuntu in a vserver and trying to change the rootpass but it wont let me, i keep getting a "passwd: Authentication service cannot retrieve authentication info." when trying to run "passwd" as root
2006-07-26T12:02:00.000Z	tgk		anyone any ideas?
2006-07-26T12:02:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	tgk	use sudo, ubuntu doesn't have a root password.
2006-07-26T12:03:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	tgk	that's a bad idea.
