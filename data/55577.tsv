2009-09-18T06:27:00.000Z	linuxguy2009		Im trying to set a folder to share and it says I need to install this sharing service. When i do it says to fix broken package so I have obviously accidentally removed a required file. Does anyone know what package(s) that may be?
2009-09-18T06:28:00.000Z	dabukalam	linuxguy2009	open synaptic and click on fix broken packages
2009-09-18T06:28:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	dabukalam	yeah i did. There are no broken ones there.
2009-09-18T06:29:00.000Z	dabukalam	linuxguy2009	no idea then. I always hit a wall with the broken packages thing :|
