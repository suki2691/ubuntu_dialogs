2006-06-01T15:49:00.000Z	Verithrax		Hm, it's possible to update to dapper automatically already, right?
2006-06-01T15:49:00.000Z	Verithrax		Running upgrade-manager normally doesn't tell me about dapper.
2006-06-01T15:50:00.000Z	Verithrax		Running upgrade-manager -d does, but it dies when I try to upgrade.
2006-06-01T15:50:00.000Z	selinium	Verithrax	Have you changed your sources.list to point to dapper?
