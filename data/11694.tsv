2011-08-14T17:19:00.000Z	yeats	gigenieks	you might end up having to contact the project for more details - many open source projects docs are sparse and potentially out of date
2011-08-14T17:20:00.000Z	yeats	gigenieks	of course you can probably volunteer to improve that situation for projects you care about ;-)
2011-08-14T17:22:00.000Z	gigenieks	yeats	I probably will read everything about music, video, image etc software, so I don't think I have time to volunteer to all projects lol :) But I could for now file a bug (Xfburn) waiting for replies in Ubuntu forums
