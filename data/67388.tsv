2009-01-30T00:12:00.000Z	kollaps		Hi. I'm getting a permission denied from a .run file, actually from a lot of them (from a game server). they're all 0777 so I can't seem to reason the problem. I tried root, ./name.run and sh name.run
2009-01-30T00:12:00.000Z	Gnea	kollaps	are they binary files or shell scripts?
