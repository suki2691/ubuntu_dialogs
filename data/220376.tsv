2009-02-24T04:53:00.000Z	Mip5		Hey Gang - I have edubuntu 8.04 installed and / is on raid1 /dev/md0. I marked a disk as failed and removed, and shutdown the system. Now on power back up, I get a message that /dev/md0 is missing
2009-02-24T04:54:00.000Z	Mip5		you guys are awesome! - I'm in BusyBox - can I do a recovery from here or do I need the live cd?
2009-02-24T04:56:00.000Z	Mip5		Sorry - I thought Flannel was responding to my question about a lost md0
2009-02-24T04:57:00.000Z	Flannel	Mip5	You'll likely need a liveCD.  But I'm not extremely versed in RAID
