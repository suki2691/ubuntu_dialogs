2012-09-17T16:54:00.000Z	rigo_		i would like to ask if it makes any sence to install the quantal (beta) instead of precise?
2012-09-17T16:55:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	rigo_	i wouldn't.
2012-09-17T16:55:00.000Z	TheLordOfTime	rigo_	just because of the number of bugs I've seen being filed against the current quantal versions
