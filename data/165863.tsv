2007-04-28T13:52:00.000Z	RasQulec	yemu	It seems like it would be possible though I cant think of a way off the top of my head
2007-04-28T13:53:00.000Z	yemu	RasQulec	but there's no option in gnome-volume-manager for example?
2007-04-28T13:54:00.000Z	RasQulec	yemu	I dont that there is an easy way atm but I dont doubt it could be done
