2009-08-17T12:38:00.000Z	Flannel	pepperphd	No, because what happens there is curses doesn't re-set the terminal to a "happy" state as far as echo/etc is concerned (so its usable by a human), killing it early still won't make it reset that, your best bet is to restart the program, close it and let it shutdown properly
