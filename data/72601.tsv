2009-01-07T06:17:00.000Z	PrivateRolf		I'm looking for  someone who has a very basic (if not fresh) installation of Ubuntu with all repositories enabled to help me test a script. Does anyone meet the criteria?

2009-01-07T06:22:00.000Z	tiyowan	PrivateRolf	Neat. I'm curious as to what extra options are there that you need to compile the package with. pm me. Sounds interesting.
