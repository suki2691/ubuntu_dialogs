2006-06-30T12:17:00.000Z	leboff		can someone recommend a Wireless NIC .. i'm getting a new one, and i want one that just works with ubuntu..
2006-06-30T12:17:00.000Z	SurfnKid	leboff	my broadcomm 43xx works good, but i hear the Intel 2200 BG is good too
2006-06-30T12:18:00.000Z	leboff	SurfnKid	i had a broadcomm 43xx .. there were driver issues :/ had to use fwcutter and stuff.. know of anything that works out of the box?
2006-06-30T12:19:00.000Z	SurfnKid	leboff	wouldnt know for dapper, but bcm43xx worked perfectly with ndiswrapper, i might have to look for a card myself that is nearly 'out-of-the-box' perfect
