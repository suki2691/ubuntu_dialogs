2009-04-18T21:08:00.000Z	ktebit		 I just installed the xubuntu 9.04 release candidate, this time I used ext4 and damn it is lightning fast. An fsck took like 10 seconds.
2009-04-18T21:08:00.000Z	ktebit		Is 3 gig of swap with 2 gigs of ram enough?
2009-04-18T21:09:00.000Z	ktebit		Also, right now I have xchat connected to two servers, firefox with 5 tabs open, and pidgin running in XFCE and I am using around 330 mb of ram. Is this pretty good or could be better or about right or what?
2009-04-18T21:09:00.000Z	PhotoJim	ktebit	Lilarcor_ is right but on a larger-RAM machine swap is less important.  2-4 GiB of swap will be fine on a machine like that.  some would suggest less.  I tend to be conservative.
