2006-09-11T06:48:00.000Z	fishy		I might be buying a wireless mouse ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009N7OL6/ref=olp_product_details/102-8360799-5983319?ie=UTF8 ) but it requires drivers - will I need the drivers, and if I do, do you think I can use the mouse with Ubuntu?
2006-09-11T06:50:00.000Z	fishy		Do you think they have Ubuntu ported drivers for that mouse?
