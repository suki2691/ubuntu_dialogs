2007-07-14T10:50:00.000Z	robdeman		OK: so I have found my CUPS printer .. CUPS has a webserver running or something at port 631
2007-07-14T10:51:00.000Z	robdeman		how do I tell WinXP to use the CUPS printer?
2007-07-14T10:51:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	robdeman	yes, that's the web interface. You can point your browser at localhost:631 to see cups info and add printers.
