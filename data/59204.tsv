2009-07-09T22:30:00.000Z	Hylian		hey guys i was wondering if you could point me towards a really easy cross platform way of transferring files via the internet..?? i want to transfer files from my father's machine to mine and vice versa...
2009-07-09T22:31:00.000Z	Hylian		yeah, but my father uses windows and i use ubuntu, actually he uses 2 machines, and one is windows...
2009-07-09T22:32:00.000Z	Hylian		if the machines where physically here i would just network them, but
2009-07-09T22:32:00.000Z	VCoolio	Hylian	there is woof (commandline only, we're working on a gui version)
