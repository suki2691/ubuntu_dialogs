2007-04-21T07:39:00.000Z	kisho1		I have problem in feisty fawn fresh installation. I am attempting installation on Dell D 505.  Problem is that where as I had perfect Display in 6.06 and 6.10, the new release is not centring my screen I cannot see task bar at bottom and at top there is some not usable empty space.

2007-04-21T07:40:00.000Z	xtknight	kisho1	ah it's probably using centered mode w/ a lower resolution.  you need to use the maximum resolution
