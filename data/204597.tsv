2006-01-26T12:11:00.000Z	orkin		I enabled DMA, it still seems to be quite slow when closing, moving and sometimes opening dialogs; as well as in response time to menu clickes (ie i click a menu item and it takes 3-5 seconds for the popup to come up, and sometimes i have to click it again). it seems sluggish switching between applications. any advice on how to fix this or is this just linux?
