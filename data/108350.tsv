2008-04-08T06:59:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy		Hello, I have two questions:
2008-04-08T07:00:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy		1.  I keep seeing screen shots of a Linux desktop that has a "taskbar" at the bottom of the screen that seems to work like the OS-X taskbar.
2008-04-08T07:00:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy		Does anyone know what that app is?
