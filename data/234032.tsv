2006-06-05T06:25:00.000Z	Hajuu		hey does anyone know of a lightweight alternative to gdm thats in the breezy ubuntu repositories?
2006-06-05T06:26:00.000Z	ynef	Hajuu	xdm, kdm, gdm -- the three great ones. xdm is ugly, but should also be lighter
2006-06-05T06:28:00.000Z	Hajuu	ynef	So if I put xdm on, and remove gdm and gnome but keep gtk (if thats possible) then I can still run all my gnome apps?
