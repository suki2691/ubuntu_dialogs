2009-10-17T19:14:00.000Z	kelohippi		just wondering cause im reading some old forums about the subject.. that mixed use of aptitude and apt-get can cause some bad stuff happen
2009-10-17T19:15:00.000Z	kelohippi		and also i read about aptitude being better at uninstalling programs
2009-10-17T19:17:00.000Z	kelohippi		so should i be concerned about mixed use of apt-get and aptitude?
