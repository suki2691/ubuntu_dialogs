2006-05-19T13:53:00.000Z	Napoleon	comrade	I'm not sure, but I can install it and I only have the multi/universe/etc repos enabled. Nothing special.
2006-05-19T14:01:00.000Z	comrade	Napoleon	I'm using nubuntu so it is flight6, is it possible there isn't a repository for it yet, or is there a way to get a list of available ones for flight
2006-05-19T14:01:00.000Z	Napoleon	comrade	I don't even know what nubuntu is sorry.
