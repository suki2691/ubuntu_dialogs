2009-04-26T21:54:00.000Z	xeer		Hi everyone.. trying to get java 1.6.0 installed with swiftfox, having issues. Is it true swiftfox only comes in a 32bit flavor?
2009-04-26T21:56:00.000Z	bobertdos	xeer	Well, do you know if you have a 64 or 32-bit version installed? Java is only available in 32-bit form, you know.
2009-04-26T21:57:00.000Z	xeer	bobertdos	I am getting an ELFCLASS error to my linked java .so
2009-04-26T21:58:00.000Z	xeer	bobertdos	and I was under the impression sun just released a compatible amd64 version of 1.6.0
