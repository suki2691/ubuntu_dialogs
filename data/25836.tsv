2012-09-06T14:04:00.000Z	adcramer		Hey, so smart people: I have a broken samba (http://paste.ubuntu.com/1188635/), any attempt to change it with apt-get  errors citing samba as the issue. One guy said it was samba's config file. I'm about at my wits end trying to fix this, should I just throw everything away and reinstall?
2012-09-06T14:05:00.000Z	adcramer		No, apt-get cries in the attempt
2012-09-06T14:06:00.000Z	adcramer		can I kill it?
2012-09-06T14:06:00.000Z	belgianguy	adcramer	apt-get purge samba?
