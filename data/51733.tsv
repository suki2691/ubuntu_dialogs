2009-07-29T01:37:00.000Z	Joe-needs-help	lilcoconut	- ubuntu does have antivirus system in add/remove but rarely will you get a virus
2009-07-29T01:39:00.000Z	Joe-needs-help	lilcoconut	- there is an antivirus system but only if your transferring files from windows or downloading off illegal things but YOU DO NOT NEED ANTIVIRUS
