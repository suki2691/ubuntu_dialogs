2007-06-23T07:42:00.000Z	tom_		Hey Guys - Bit of a strange issue - just fired up Ubuntu - and none of the "system" sounds work. The only sound i can get is through Amarok - nohting else. Ive set the default soundcard, checked all the setting and everything is fine. Any ideas what i may have over looked?

2007-06-23T07:43:00.000Z	tom_	scorp123	did you just have an update as well? thats the only thing i can put it down too
2007-06-23T07:43:00.000Z	scorp123	tom_	in my case I had to disable the on-board sound card via the PC BIOS ...
