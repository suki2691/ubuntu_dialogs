2009-05-11T10:09:00.000Z	cfedde	bullgard4	icons that use a large number of colors.
2009-05-11T10:12:00.000Z	bullgard4	cfedde	Why is it necessary to put icons having a large number of colors in a separate directory? I suspect that hicolor is a defined technical term whose meaning I do not know.
2009-05-11T10:12:00.000Z	cfedde	bullgard4	these days it's probably more convention than need.
