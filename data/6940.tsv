2011-12-26T07:00:00.000Z	Tanthrix		Anyone know how to make my Ubuntu 9.10 system automatically suspend after a certain length of idleness?
2011-12-26T07:00:00.000Z	e2b04836	Tanthrix	System -> Preferences -> Power Management
2011-12-26T07:02:00.000Z	Tanthrix	e2b04836	Thanks, but I'm not using Gnome. This is a fluxbox MythTV system, not my regular desktop. Any idea on how to do it via the command line?
2011-12-26T07:03:00.000Z	Tanthrix	e2b04836	NM! Looks like I can still get to it via the Gnome Control Center. Thanks!
