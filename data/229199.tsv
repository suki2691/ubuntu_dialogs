2006-01-07T14:06:00.000Z	Apache_am		i cant change the name back
2006-01-07T14:06:00.000Z	Apache_am		when i use suo it return this message - sudo: unable to lookup 09 via gethostbyname()
2006-01-07T14:07:00.000Z	mwe	Apache_am	maybe your /etc/hosts is broken?
2006-01-07T14:08:00.000Z	mwe	Apache_am	btw does it run the command even though it complains about not being able to look up your hostname?
