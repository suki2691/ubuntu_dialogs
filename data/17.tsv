2005-06-24T12:40:00.000Z	bionic		Hello, i get this when trying to run make menuconfig in the kernel source tree, You must install ncurses-devel in order to run make menuconfig. But theres no such package ncurses-devel. I searched for ncurses packages installed, and there was quite a bunch. Plain Ubuntu 5.04 install.
