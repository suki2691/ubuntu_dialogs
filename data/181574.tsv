2006-09-05T16:40:00.000Z	moquist		is there any way for me to use a standard Dapper install ISO *without* loading up X?
2006-09-05T16:40:00.000Z	secleinteer	moquist	don't think so, unless you mod it
2006-09-05T16:40:00.000Z	secleinteer		just use the alternate instead (i know you want the standard)
2006-09-05T16:41:00.000Z	moquist	secleinteer	bbrazil: Hmm. Seems like that would be a good thing to have on there, so I could type the magic key-combo and do useful things without waiiiiiiittttttiiiinnnnngggg for X, which I usually don't even want. :p
