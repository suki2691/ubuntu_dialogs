2008-12-14T19:17:00.000Z	Lasiv		how does Ubuntu handle "non-free" packages?
2008-12-14T19:18:00.000Z	Lasiv		i'm just wondering if it's going to stay sitting on my system if I refuse to pay during the install, etc
2008-12-14T19:19:00.000Z	Lasiv		I need "unrar" and I have a free and a non-free version
2008-12-14T19:20:00.000Z	hoonteke	Lasiv	that's non-Free as in Free (what a lot folks think of as open source)
