2006-07-29T08:10:00.000Z	tjb891		i am installing a usb printer (canon pixma ip1500) and it is asking for model, is is it autodetected (it says imagerunner330s)
2006-07-29T08:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	tjb891	 im thinking that printer is not very well supported by the printing system. (cups is the name of the printing system)
2006-07-29T08:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	tjb891	 i dont think the driver  cd has linux drivers.
2006-07-29T08:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	tjb891	 from my research into pixima line of printers.. canon has not released many specs on them
