2006-03-01T14:40:00.000Z	fenris		hi, is there a way to boot my local root file system from an ubuntu live cd?
2006-03-01T14:41:00.000Z	trappist	fenris	to boot it?  you mean to mount it?
2006-03-01T14:42:00.000Z	fenris	trappist	i mean to boot my locally installed kernel, or to boot the livecd-kernel and mount my local root filesystem as root filesystem
2006-03-01T14:43:00.000Z	fenris	trappist	and i dont want to boot the complete livesystem, because it fails to start
