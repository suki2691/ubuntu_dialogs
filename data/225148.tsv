2006-05-28T09:35:00.000Z	tspier2	Madpilot	do you know what is wrong with this? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14754
2006-05-28T09:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	tspier2	do you have Multiverse enabled?
2006-05-28T09:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	tspier2	you sure? mplayer should be in multiverse
2006-05-28T09:37:00.000Z	Madpilot	tspier2	sorry, I know the trouble. There is no package actually called "mplayer" - try "mplayer-586" or something like that
