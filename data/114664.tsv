2009-02-03T09:40:00.000Z	oobe		does anyone know if i can get  a newer xchat repo or deb for 8.0.4
2009-02-03T09:41:00.000Z	binarymutant	oobe	what's the version in Jaunty? that will be easy to get if it doesn't require any dependencies
2009-02-03T09:42:00.000Z	binarymutant	oobe	actually the Jaunty idea is bad, it requires a bunch of dependencies that are probably only found in Jaunty. You can compile xchat yourself if you feel comfortable in the command line
2009-02-03T09:43:00.000Z	oobe	binarymutant	i know and i know but thanks anyway
