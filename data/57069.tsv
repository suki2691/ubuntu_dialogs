2009-05-18T03:45:00.000Z	DevilAsh		Hi all. My sound stopped working earlier today, I've checked alsamixer and my sound options in ubuntu, and they're all up. I've also had a look around the support forums, and I've got the same problem as other people, but their solutions haven't helped me at all. Don't suppose anyone's got any ideas, have you?
2009-05-18T03:45:00.000Z	DevilAsh		Sorry for the messages, by the way. Sent the wrong one first >_<
2009-05-18T03:46:00.000Z	galant14b	DevilAsh	i'm no expert, but I've had trouble w/ pulseaudio before....I  googled for a tutorial to remove pulseaudio and just run ALSA....might work for you?
