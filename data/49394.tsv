2009-11-17T21:26:00.000Z	MythBork		has anyone seen a problem in Karmic where only the first user to log in has sound? I have been experiencing this since upgrade. I tried adding all the users to the pulse* groups but the issue remains. Any help?
2009-11-17T21:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	MythBork	are the other users in the audio group ?
2009-11-17T21:28:00.000Z	MythBork	erUSUL	yes they are
2009-11-17T21:35:00.000Z	MythBork	erUSUL	no ideas? Funny thing is that if I switch to the other user and launch rhythmbox I get a light pop sound from my speakers. I also get this when logged in as the user who has sound, but music starts right after it. It's like it tries to get to the sound system but hen somehow gets kicked back off.
