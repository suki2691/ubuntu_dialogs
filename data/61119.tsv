2011-10-02T00:03:00.000Z	guntbert	Jake2	see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
2011-10-02T00:06:00.000Z	Jake2	guntbert	thanks; ansr is there: "If for some reason you have enabled your root account and wish to disable it again, use the following command in terminal...sudo passwd -dl root"
2011-10-02T00:07:00.000Z	guntbert	Jake2	yes, I know :-)
