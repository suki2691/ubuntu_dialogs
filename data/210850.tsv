2005-10-26T05:36:00.000Z	aeon17x	reiki	if you could access the internet just fine, then traceroute should go through without opening new ports, I think.
2005-10-26T05:37:00.000Z	reiki	aeon17x	that's what I thought too, but traceroute from command line says traceroute not found, and using the gui tool it just times out
2005-10-26T06:12:00.000Z	aeon17x	reiki	Possibly. After all, that's the purpose of traceroute - to see if it gets halted at some point.
