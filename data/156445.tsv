2008-01-22T06:30:00.000Z	Joel		I have a pro/wireless 3945ABG that up until today was working, but now it doesn't detect it, would anybody know what to do about this?
2008-01-22T06:31:00.000Z	Joel		yeah
2008-01-22T06:32:00.000Z	Joel		and when I run iwconfig it says that lo and eth0 have no extensions
2008-01-22T06:32:00.000Z	genii	Joel	Well, since iwconfig is for wireless devices that makes perfect sense.
