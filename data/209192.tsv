2005-11-02T08:36:00.000Z	erUSUL		someone knows where to find kernel incremental patches. The like to go 2.6.14-rc5 --> 2.6.14
2005-11-02T08:37:00.000Z	targetx	erUSUL	www.kernel.org perhaps ?
2005-11-02T08:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	targetx	no luck there you find patchs of 4MB at a time 2.6.13 --> 2.614 :(
2005-11-02T08:38:00.000Z	targetx	erUSUL	oh sorry
