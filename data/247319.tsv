2010-08-12T14:56:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Yud_Zroc	Can you put more RAM in it?
2010-08-12T14:57:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Yud_Zroc	In all reality, look into PuppyLinux or DSL for that machine. Hate to tell ya that.
2010-08-12T15:02:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Yud_Zroc	Mate, have you read any of the specs and requirements for any of the distros? I'd suggest going to www.distrowatch, looking for PuppyLinux or DSL. You've only got 128mb of RAM.
