2008-01-13T03:27:00.000Z	Asche_83m		hello! i'd like to edit my xorg.conf on dapper in order to use the dvi-out _instead_ of the vga-out. any advice?
2008-01-13T03:27:00.000Z	ikonia	Asche_83m	they should both output
2008-01-13T03:28:00.000Z	Asche_83m	ikonia	they don't
2008-01-13T03:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Asche_83m	to go from 32bit to 64 bit your suggesting not doing a re-install
