2009-12-29T05:36:00.000Z	mka	mMezquitale	rm makes you wipe a file from the hard drive
2009-12-29T05:38:00.000Z	mMezquitale	mka	"rm" securely wipes files from ext4 partitions?  I thought you had to give them a few passes for it to be securely removed
2009-12-29T05:39:00.000Z	mka	mMezquitale	not rm does not secure delete
