2011-07-16T16:40:00.000Z	johna		I  have had to rebuild me server - was running Centos 5.5 - but I am thinking of moving over to Ubuntu 10.04+. What is/are the best tools for administering a family server - phenom II x4, 8Gb, 6Tb hdd. Is LVM worth it? what would be an optimal partitioning scheme? ...
