2006-05-15T09:46:00.000Z	Zetx		I'm using a marvel card and the sky2 module and my dmesg keeps telling me that the "Link is down" then shortly after "Link is up at 100 Mbps, full duplex, flow control none" ... I'm assuming that it's turning on and off or something. Any remedies (that doesn't require me buying a new card)?
2006-05-15T09:46:00.000Z	waldo	Zetx	does it keep going up and down and up and down?
2006-05-15T09:58:00.000Z	Zetx	waldo	my wireless is off and this doesn't happen in a windows environment
2006-05-15T09:59:00.000Z	waldo	Zetx	hmm...  not sure
