2012-05-04T02:50:00.000Z	dashavoo		I don't really know what I am expecting... miracle maybe... but here I go:
2012-05-04T02:50:00.000Z	dashavoo		all of my important files have vanished... I doubt anyone can tell me how to recover them, but can anyone at least give me an idea of how?
2012-05-04T02:51:00.000Z	dashavoo		my entire music collection (most of which I still have the physical media for somewhere), my entire photo collection (no backups, lots of memories)
2012-05-04T02:51:00.000Z	MarcN	dashavoo	so what did you do that may have lost all your files? Where they all under /home/?
