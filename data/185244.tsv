2006-05-23T08:42:00.000Z	rpi		Does anybody know why my network functions perfectly well under breezy and the dapper live cd (beta2), but stops working about 10 seconds after boot under an installed dapper installation?
2006-05-23T08:44:00.000Z	green_earz	rpi	 could be the wrong module installed for the ether card ???  to find out what the module is for the ether card go to the link > http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/
2006-05-23T08:46:00.000Z	rpi	green_earz	thanks, i will check that... it's still strange that i don't have that problem booting from the live cd
2006-05-23T09:15:00.000Z	rpi	green_earz	still there? I checked, but my dapper install uses the same driver for my ethernet card as breezy...
