2007-12-02T10:13:00.000Z	Loaxes		there are xp folks?

2007-12-02T10:16:00.000Z	Hanyou	Loaxes	I beleive that on the GRUB website there is a how to on reconfiguring GRUB if you have done something like what you did. Then again that was some time ago. I would just backup my Ubuntu install and go at it again.
