2009-11-15T07:12:00.000Z	HaguMe		When I play assaultcube, The sound screws up... I noticed I have Amarok (or any music program) turned on so when I stop using it, the sound in AC is working OK, but I would like to have both apps without issues. What can I do?
2009-11-15T07:13:00.000Z	HaguMe		Can someone HELP ME?
