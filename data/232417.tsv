2008-12-20T19:26:00.000Z	LynggaardDk		I have a 64bit install, and a repository with 32bit software, how do I make apt-get use that. It keeps saying package not found
2008-12-20T19:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	LynggaardDk	you shouldn't mix the two arch's i do not think that set up is supported
2008-12-20T19:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	LynggaardDk	yes you can rn 32 bit binaries on 64 bit ubuntu but i do not think apt/dpkg can manage packages from two different arches
2008-12-20T19:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	LynggaardDk	i do not know the  technical reasons; sorry
