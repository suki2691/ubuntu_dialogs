2009-05-21T00:53:00.000Z	Ahlee		anybody know off hand how to remove the suggestions for installing a package if it isn't installed?
2009-05-21T00:54:00.000Z	Ahlee		so if i type a command name i don't have installed, it just errors saying command not found, not <search for app>, you should isntall X
2009-05-21T00:55:00.000Z	Slart	Ahlee	i think the function is called something.. like.. command-not-found.. or something along those lines
