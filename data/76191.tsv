2008-10-31T19:03:00.000Z	JesperHansen		After the Upgrade I am missing the mouse management and the window management for which allows me to enable sloppy focus (focus follows mouse). What package provides the managers?
2008-10-31T19:03:00.000Z	velko	JesperHansen	i think that this is a feature of the window manager
2008-10-31T19:04:00.000Z	JesperHansen	velko	yup. But I've missed the package that provides me the method to enable it.
2008-10-31T19:05:00.000Z	JesperHansen	velko	it was System>Preferences>Windows
