2008-03-06T20:05:00.000Z	insanitatum		anyone know how to use vncviewer (xtightvncviewer or similar) to connect to a non-standard ssh port?
2008-03-06T20:05:00.000Z	insanitatum		vncviewer -via <host> -p <port> <name:display> doesn't seem to work, just kinda pauses and hangs out in nothing-space
2008-03-06T20:06:00.000Z	bazhang	insanitatum	just searching for that but only come up with links for ssh
2008-03-06T20:06:00.000Z	insanitatum	bazhang	been looking for a bit ;)  works fine on 22 but... some yaya keeps trying to mess with my pretty lil 7.10 box
