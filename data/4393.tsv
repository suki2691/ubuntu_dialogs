2012-03-25T08:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jay_zawrotny	export EDITOR=vim
2012-03-25T08:56:00.000Z	jay_zawrotny	ActionParsnip	Thanks! I set it in my bash settings but I guess I have to do it locally from a terminal session for it to work.
2012-03-25T08:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jay_zawrotny	add it in ~/.bashrc
