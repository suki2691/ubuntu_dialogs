2011-10-19T03:10:00.000Z	TheChad		Could anyone please help me in getting an old partition erased and setting it up as a new install of Ubuntu? My Windows took a dive and I'm wanting to switch without losing all my files...

2011-10-19T03:12:00.000Z	cajunspice	TheChad	really good chance of any install attempt wrecking your exiting files
2011-10-19T03:13:00.000Z	cajunspice	TheChad	can you start windows in safe mode?
