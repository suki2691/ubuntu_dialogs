2007-10-01T08:18:00.000Z	insllvn		not sure if this is the right place to ask this but here goes  i installed kubuntu on top of an existing ubuntu install using apt-get install i now want to revert to ubuntu everything else has been removed and i seem to be running ubuntu the apt command claims i have removed kubuntu-desktop  but when i boot the machine i still get the kubuntu loading screen ie KUBUNTU with a loading bar beneath it how do i fix that?
