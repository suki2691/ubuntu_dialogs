2006-09-18T10:45:00.000Z	robert_		can somebody tell me how php4-cgi is configured under 6.06?
2006-09-18T10:45:00.000Z	Flannel	robert_	in /etc/php4/ or maybe just /etc/php, but I imagine the former
2006-09-18T10:47:00.000Z	robert_	Flannel	I would like to know where I can find out the ./configure line whoever packaged php4-cgi used
2007-06-09T15:42:00.000Z	robert_	Flannel	that may be true, but he shouldn't be talking DIRECTLY to me, if he wishes not to illicit a response from me :P
