2008-05-03T10:41:00.000Z	cmw72		can anybody tell me why ubuntu 8.04 won't let me do anything that requires sudo?  i've verified the root password, and i'm typing it correctly.

2008-05-03T10:41:00.000Z	Gnea	cmw72	you are fired.
2008-05-03T10:43:00.000Z	Gnea	cmw72	i fail to see your logic.  you should just type sudo <command>, then enter your user password.  that's it, root password has nothing to do with that.
