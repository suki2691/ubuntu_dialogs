2011-01-18T04:11:00.000Z	kgs		Hi. I have a general Linux question that google is not helping me with. What is the maximum length for a password in Ubuntu? From what I understand it is 8. Anything beyond the 8th character is ignored. Is this true?
2011-01-18T04:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	kgs	doubt it; what makes you think it is 8?
2011-01-18T04:14:00.000Z	kgs	erUSUL	A few sources have suggested as much.
