2012-07-07T06:47:00.000Z	enkari		Anyone know how to reset linux to make it redetect the monitor?
2012-07-07T06:47:00.000Z	enkari		It seems to think I'm using the same monitor, yet I've just changed it
2012-07-07T06:48:00.000Z	rigel	enkari	reboot. sometimes you have to reboot 4 or 5 times before it detects the monitor properly.
