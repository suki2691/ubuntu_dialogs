2008-09-16T16:17:00.000Z	comicinker	Debolaz	nautilus and konqueror are goog clients for webdav
2008-09-16T16:19:00.000Z	Debolaz	comicinker	Nautilus webdav is broken in hardy as far as I can tell.. I can try konqueror though.
2008-09-16T16:20:00.000Z	comicinker	Debolaz	nautilus reports sometimes error messages when using webdav, however, as far as I can tell, even with this error messages it works when you use bookmarks or in the menu Places->Connect to server
