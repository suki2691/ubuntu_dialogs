2011-09-15T19:02:00.000Z	Targen		is there a command to ask the package manager for possible names of packages that may have a command by a certain name?
2011-09-15T19:02:00.000Z	Targen		i'm trying to figure out what package has the "compress" program.
2011-09-15T19:02:00.000Z	oCean	Targen	apt-file shows files in packages, that's probably what you want
2011-09-15T19:03:00.000Z	Targen	oCean	thanks.
