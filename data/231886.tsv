2008-02-10T00:15:00.000Z	Jonathan_L		I'm installing Ubuntu
2008-02-10T00:15:00.000Z	Jonathan_L		The installer on the Live-CD is open
2008-02-10T00:16:00.000Z	Jonathan_L		How should I partition it if I want to keep Windows? I already have two partitions, and the content on one of them is unimportant
