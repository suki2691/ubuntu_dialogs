2005-12-30T08:18:00.000Z	cmatheson	penguin42	gtk2 and gtk1.x are completely different beasts... so the test scripts just won't work between the two (they *shouldn't* work between the two), i think they did get rid of gtk-confgi though (there maybe be a gtk-config2.0?)
2005-12-30T08:19:00.000Z	penguin42	cmatheson	Still, nice way to tell which version something is complaining about
2005-12-30T08:20:00.000Z	cmatheson	penguin42	yeah
