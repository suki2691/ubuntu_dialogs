2004-12-29T09:20:00.000Z	lexhider		Here's my drama, just installed Ubuntu and want to boot XP, commented out windows bit in menu.lst (yes XP partition is hda1) and I get: "filesystem type unknown, partition type 0x7" if I try to boot it.
2004-12-29T09:20:00.000Z	lexhider		Is there a solution or is lilo available.
2004-12-29T09:22:00.000Z	DonL	lexhider	in the past I've always installed windows first. I don't think it likes linux partitions
2004-12-29T09:22:00.000Z	lexhider	DonL	windows was installed 1st.
