2012-09-21T01:14:00.000Z	zykotick9	zma	other then the "Grub Customizer" that i have 0 idea what it changed.  just running "sudo update-grub" does create a new file by default!
2012-09-21T01:15:00.000Z	zykotick9		!es | ki7rw: personally, i'd ask here.
2012-09-21T01:15:00.000Z	zma	zykotick9	Grub Customizer ended up modifying /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober_proxy file. update-grub2 works based on that file, so it's not creating from scratch but based on modified conf files.
2012-09-21T01:15:00.000Z	zykotick9	zma	right.  so i can't help you.  good luck.
