2010-10-11T19:35:00.000Z	icarus-c	garstyciuks	what configuration files you mean
2010-10-11T19:37:00.000Z	garstyciuks	icarus-c	mostly keyboard and X server related
2010-10-11T19:38:00.000Z	garstyciuks	icarus-c	I just did dpkg-reconfigure console-setup and now the down arrow key does the same as the enter key, and it's not clear what others do... :/
