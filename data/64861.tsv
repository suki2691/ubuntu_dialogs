2009-10-16T00:24:00.000Z	jhaig		I have Ubuntu installed on 3 machines used by a number of people and I am frequently seeing a couple of problems with Firefox.  Firstly, the "Firefox is already running" problem and secondly this problem - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=6744603  I know how to fix these each time it happens, but does anyone know what is causing this as I don't want to have to hang around and fix it for users every time it happens.

2009-10-16T00:29:00.000Z	jhaig	ZykoticK9	The problem isn't that firefox is still running.  The problem is that it keeps leaving the lock and .parentlock file hanging around.  It is happening a lot and I can find no reason why.
