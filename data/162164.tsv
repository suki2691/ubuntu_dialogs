2006-10-28T08:33:00.000Z	Geforce		Hello guys, I have a really odd problem in Edgy eft.... Yesterday, I upgraded to 6.10 before going to sleep. Everything went well, except.... When I shut my computer down for the night, after upgrading, I came back 5 mins later. Everything was shut down, but for some odd reason, my USB devices were still powered up! (My USB keyboard was lit, as well as my USB headset's mute button). Anyone has an idea wth that is!?

2006-10-28T08:34:00.000Z	JosefK		ack :/ that's obscure
2006-10-28T08:34:00.000Z	Geforce	JosefK	It never did that before
