I am a computer networker and I know it isn't good to have both connections on the same network, but I use my wireless so I can get to the internet and sometimes use my ethernet to configure network devices (like an AP using a cross over).

2008-08-28T21:22:00.000Z	KDB9000	OllieA	I know it is possible in windows because I have done it before. I know Ubuntu isn't windows but it should be possible
