2011-11-14T23:14:00.000Z	sven_	Jonii	libre is a fork, due to unclear support of openoffice's new owner - for you it should be the same
2011-11-14T23:15:00.000Z	Jonii	sven_	"for me it should be the same"?
2011-11-14T23:16:00.000Z	sven_	Jonii	at the time of the fork taking place, both software products are 100% identical, then some names and logos get changed.... and thats where we are almost at
