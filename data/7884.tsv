2012-05-03T18:15:00.000Z	CJKay	L3top	After a complete nightmare toying with recovery mode, drivers and the likes, I have *finally* managed to get ironhide working with my card
2012-05-03T22:03:00.000Z	CJKay	L3top	Bumblee is a success, although whether it is any more stable than Ironhide... I don't know
2012-05-03T22:04:00.000Z	CJKay	L3top	So I'm still stuck with this strange lightdm thing though. Whenever I want to log in, I have to switch to tty1, stop the lightdm service, start gdm and log in with that
2012-05-03T22:23:00.000Z	CJKay	L3top	Removing .Xauthority seems to have done the lightdm trick. Thanks for all the help - glad I can finally get back to what I was doing heh
