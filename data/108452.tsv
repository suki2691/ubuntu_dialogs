2008-09-19T02:28:00.000Z	ganymede	simNIX	yeah, i already created a user with shell scponly, i can also chroot it?
2008-09-19T02:31:00.000Z	ganymede	simNIX	i'll try with scponlyc shell instead. what server are you using that has that functionality built in? i'm using the one that ships with ubuntu by default. i skimmed the manpage of sshd_config but didn't see anything about scp only
