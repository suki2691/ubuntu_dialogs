2010-07-28T11:02:00.000Z	kaeles		so i installed lucid lynx on my htpc to replace the xbmc live cd i had been running for like 6 months now, and it works fine other than the sound will cut out after using it for awhile, for example, if I click on the sounds in the sound preference over and over for ~5 seconds, the sound cuts out, and is replaced by really scratchy deep sounds instead of the glass or barking or whatnot, its weird, never had an issue with xmbc live,
2010-07-28T11:04:00.000Z	kaeles		anyone have a clue as to what would cause my sound to stop working correctly after playing sounds for ~5 to 30 seconds?
2010-07-28T11:04:00.000Z	tucemiux	kaeles	sounds (no pun intended) like a bug with pulseaudio
2010-07-28T11:04:00.000Z	kaeles	tucemiux	ok, so how would i go about changing back to alsa, if thats possible?
