2009-08-20T00:25:00.000Z	quieteyes	alankila	yes and no.  I have regular backups of 2.5 million emails stored as maildir.  It goes well but the differential backups (incrementals) sometimes take a bit
2009-08-20T00:25:00.000Z	alankila	quieteyes	yes, a lot of data. But would it be any easier if they were all in mbox?
2009-08-20T00:26:00.000Z	quieteyes	alankila	yes and know.  easier to back up, but I've had mboxes implode on me.  maildir is actually not too bad, provided you don't have users storing 8 years of unsorted email
