2011-04-28T02:54:00.000Z	jrib	sumio	what do you mean when you say "my package repository"?
2011-04-28T02:57:00.000Z	jrib	sumio	packages you installed from ubuntu's repositories will just be upgraded, you won't lose them
2011-04-28T03:03:00.000Z	jrib	sumio	yes, but you can also just upgrade and then not lose anything...
