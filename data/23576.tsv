2010-11-05T15:54:00.000Z	dw-	Travis-42	make a little script for it :)
2010-11-05T15:56:00.000Z	Travis-42	dw-	Yea, I guess I'll have to write a script.  Tonus: that only displays the last modified time of the folder, not it's contents
2010-11-05T15:57:00.000Z	dw-	Travis-42	do it in PHP then you can extend your skillz to the web later :p
