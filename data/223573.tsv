2007-01-13T10:41:00.000Z	steel_lady		can somebody tell me which is the localhost default directory for apache?
2007-01-13T10:41:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	steel_lady	/var/www I think
2007-01-13T10:44:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	steel_lady	<?php phpinfo(); ?> in a script iirc...
2007-01-13T10:47:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	steel_lady	you make a script like "info.php" in the web directory and put that in it, then when you view http://localhost/info.php from your browser it tells you heaps of info about apache and php
