2012-01-12T01:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	HSarena	 vmware emulates specific hardware, so im not sure what 'drivers' you would be needing
2012-01-12T01:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	HSarena	 normally theres some sort of 'guest' addations for vmware, or vbox. that  provide drivers for the os to work better with the  VM.
