2012-04-10T18:54:00.000Z	Al_nz1		why when I connect to my ubuntu box with vnc do I get a blank (but not black) window, with mouse. No icons, not even the option to login
2012-04-10T18:54:00.000Z	compdoc	Al_nz1	which vnc did you install?
2012-04-10T18:55:00.000Z	compdoc	Al_nz1	good, I like that one
2012-04-10T18:56:00.000Z	compdoc	Al_nz1	did you run the commands to set you vncpasswd ?
