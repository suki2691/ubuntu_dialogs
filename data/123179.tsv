2007-09-03T09:37:00.000Z	qid		So, I just installed the new kernel update on my laptop and now it doesn't boot; any suggestions?
2007-09-03T09:38:00.000Z	qid		it looks like it gets to the point of loading a CD-ROM driver and then dies
2007-09-03T09:40:00.000Z	qid		if this is the kind of junk that happens with a minor kernel upgrade, bug#1 is never gonna get closed
2007-09-03T09:40:00.000Z	ehird`	qid	bug #1 is how shall we put it... very long term ;)
