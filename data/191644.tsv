2011-08-27T02:49:00.000Z	juso		So from a general ubuntu user stand point, how many of you have osx/windows machines as well?
2011-08-27T02:51:00.000Z	user	juso	I think I'll have a Windows machine very soon if Ubuntu stops giving me problems
2011-08-27T02:52:00.000Z	user	juso	My sound works fine for a couple hours then it just stops
2011-08-27T02:53:00.000Z	user	juso	When I try a test then "sound" bombs out. I have to restart again
