2010-01-22T03:56:00.000Z	aarcane	Trek	your CLIENT wants it to not start automatically, so disable the service using bum.  your client can still start it manually.
2010-01-22T03:57:00.000Z	Trek	aarcane	& DasEi: Well, bum isn't helping much... specifically it won't let me mess with the boot script
2010-01-22T03:58:00.000Z	Trek	aarcane	& DasEi: its saying "you need deep knowledge to mess with it" and it doesn't show up as a service either
