But flash does not working on Firefox and Opera has many problems with it (i mean it is working with opera but sometimes buttons on flash does not working). I have all updates on my system. Can you help me to solve the problem please ?

2010-04-30T18:04:00.000Z	esaller	psantoni	I know that 64 bit flash is beta now. So I use 32 bit because it is more stable.
