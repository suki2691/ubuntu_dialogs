2012-09-07T22:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	Ihsan_	 totally depends on the size of sda1 and the speeds of the drives..
2012-09-07T22:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	Ihsan_	 such a command could take several hours if its a very large hd.
2012-09-07T23:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	Ihsan_	 so have you installed anything to give you the dislocker command?
