My question is when I delete something from that partition do I need to use a program such as 'shred'  or 'secure-delete' or can I just delete a file (or whatever) since it's encrypted?

2012-11-14T22:53:00.000Z	gmachine_24	Guest27757	OK, thanks. That's what I figured but I wanted a second opinion.
