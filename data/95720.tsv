2008-05-09T03:22:00.000Z	gnyffel	Don_Miguel	I could find you a howto- My original thought, though, was to just write a simple 'mount /dev/sdxx' and throw it in a bash script, seeing as mounting it manually seems to work. Then add the script with update-rc.d. I'm sure there's a better way to execute a script like this on startup, but it's an idea, this.
