2010-05-11T08:18:00.000Z	Nautilus		where is the default "It Works!" web site in the file structure?
2010-05-11T08:19:00.000Z	powertool08	Nautilus	/var/www/html I think.
2010-05-11T08:40:00.000Z	powertool08	Nautilus	"groups" shows you what groups the currently logged in user is in.
2010-05-11T08:40:00.000Z	powertool08	Nautilus	cat /etc/passwd | grep groups to see all groups on box.
