2007-07-20T11:00:00.000Z	Cubey		is it just me, or is ubuntu slower than windows xp pro? :\
2007-07-20T11:02:00.000Z	Cubey		I'm not here to glorify windows, i'm just wondering what the deal is. :/
2007-07-20T11:03:00.000Z	noodles12	Cubey	I agree with Nemesis. I just recently reinstalled windows and feisty and feisty is a lot faster to me too. I'm working on a core duo notebook.
