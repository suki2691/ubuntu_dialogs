2008-01-12T19:07:00.000Z	mykas0		Listen... for some personal reasons, I have to reinstall my Ubuntu - should I go for 7.10 or 8.04 ?
2008-01-12T19:08:00.000Z	cleaton	mykas0	8.04 is alpha, not enduser ready
2008-01-12T19:09:00.000Z	mykas0	cleaton	I know that (I'm a Computer Science student), but my problem is... will I later be able to upgrade to the next alpha(s), and eventually the final version ?
