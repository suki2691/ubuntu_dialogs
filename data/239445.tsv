2007-08-19T13:16:00.000Z	Charles_Xavier		This is a question regarding wireless networking in ubuntu feisty 7.04. - I cannot get wireless networking to work on my computer. The DLINK Wireless card (Chipset: Marvell W8300) is installed and ready to use, but I cannot install the proper drivers and do not know how to install drivers. If anyone can help me, that would be great.
2007-08-19T13:17:00.000Z	Charles_Xavier		Is there any method to install this card?
