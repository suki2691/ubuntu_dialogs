2011-04-08T04:17:00.000Z	Jon--		Been trying to get assistance in #deluge for a long time now (several hours). I'm taking my question here. I know this is not directly related to Ubuntu: My download speed is stuck at 0.00? Deluge 1.3.0 from PPA ppa:deluge-team/ppa on Ubuntu 10.04. Port is forwarded, doing a port check gets green check mark.
2011-04-08T04:18:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	Jon--	is anyone seeding?  I use deluge, but didn't mess around with port forwarding or anything just opened it up and it works
2011-04-08T04:18:00.000Z	Jon--	ubuntu4shane	There should be at least 40 seeders on one of these.
2011-04-08T04:21:00.000Z	Jon--	ubuntu4shane	Tracker reports OK, however health is 0, and it is only finding a very small subset of the actual seeders, and 0 upload from them.
