2012-04-14T04:35:00.000Z	harold		so, "apt-get dist-upgrade" and that's it?
2012-04-14T04:36:00.000Z	harold		what's the likelihood of it being a really seamless transition that doesn't break anything? this is on a server machine that's pretty slim and has just an instance of wordpress being served with apache and that's it
