While I was booting from the CD, a couple of the bullets didn't read OK as it was loading.  Does this mean that some of my hardware will not be detected if I choose to install.  Everything seemed to work fine when it finally booted up however.

2006-06-20T14:24:00.000Z	Pelo	mlndd	 an installer for propiratary stuff like  flash ...
