2008-08-10T02:28:00.000Z	Billll		 I have a 128 ram computer wanting to isntall xubuntu on it
2008-08-10T02:28:00.000Z	Billll		 question is do I want to isntall the alternate CD version or not?
2008-08-10T02:28:00.000Z	qr_	Billll	you do, the live CD requires more ram than that
2008-08-10T02:35:00.000Z	qr_	Billll	probably. I'd suggest using the server install for a really old machine. You can install a very barebones system with no gui with the server cd which should run nicely.
