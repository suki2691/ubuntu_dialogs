2010-01-23T16:22:00.000Z	richards		hey, i've got a new ubuntu 9.10 server install that i would like to have multiple IPs on different VLAN's on.  However, only the vlan I specify the gateway on works. if i specify gateway in multiple interfaces, then the last one i specify works.

2010-01-23T16:23:00.000Z	richards		thanks, will ask there
