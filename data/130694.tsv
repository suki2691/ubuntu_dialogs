2007-06-26T15:35:00.000Z	demonstealer		i attempted at downloading vlc media player from the add/remove applications function, after 2 minutes of downloading it says failed to recieve a few packages from server and asked me to chose to ignore and continue which i did, therefore, vlc media player hasnt been installed yet
2007-06-26T15:36:00.000Z	haf	demonstealer	could be server probs, just try it again, and again
2007-06-26T15:36:00.000Z	haf		if it still can't receive some of the packages, try at a later time
2007-06-26T15:36:00.000Z	demonstealer	haf	ive tried 3 times on different occasions
