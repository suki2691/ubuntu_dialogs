2005-07-03T10:41:00.000Z	evader		Hi. I switched to Breezy to give it ago - I'm not prepared to deal with the breaks and nvidia problems I've had so can I just swithch my sources back to Hoary and downgrade?
2005-07-03T10:42:00.000Z	evader		Will it work OK?
2005-07-03T10:42:00.000Z	Strife	evader	if you reinstall... yes
2005-07-03T10:43:00.000Z	evader	Strife	What do you mean? I have to reinstall from scratch? Can I just switch this current Breezy system to Hoary and let apt downgrade it?
