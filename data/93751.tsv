2008-05-15T02:31:00.000Z	ibleed	Fritzel	i had a similiar problem trying the Eve online game on hardy.  wouldn't play any sound.  it uses wine and a ubuntu configuration utility, and i'm not sure its the same problem, if it isn't it might not be flash that keeps wine and pulseaudio from communicating
