2011-09-16T06:25:00.000Z	AaronDCampbell		Ok, new laptop and I have a few things that I obviously did a long time ago on my other laptop and can't seem to figure out how to do again.
2011-09-16T06:25:00.000Z	AaronDCampbell		I set up Samba but it's not starting automatically when I boot up.  How can I make it do that?
2011-09-16T06:26:00.000Z	Dmole	AaronDCampbell	you can enable the init script
2011-09-16T06:28:00.000Z	AaronDCampbell	Dmole	or metabill: can you expound on that?
