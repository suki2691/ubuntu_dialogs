2012-04-26T15:01:00.000Z	Naemdar		Anyone know where to get drivers for a my passport drive?
2012-04-26T15:03:00.000Z	Naemdar		It won't mount for some reason.  and its in fat32 perhaps changing the file format?
2012-04-26T15:05:00.000Z	Naemdar		Or would ntfs be better, I see the ntfs volumes when I go looking for hard drives.  Just not going to torrent files to it as its my windows and game drive.
2012-04-26T15:06:00.000Z	sly	Naemdar	, why would you want in it fat32 anyway ? Ntfs is pretty widely supported........
