2011-01-08T09:26:00.000Z	yudi1		why are the kernel header files not installed with the kernel update? can any one answer this
2011-01-08T09:27:00.000Z	psusi	yudi1	because the header files are separate and only installed if you go install them... they aren't needed by most people
2011-01-08T09:28:00.000Z	yudi1	psusi	but if nvidia driver needs them, how come they do not get updated automatically? I am pretty sure for some it gets updated automatically
