2007-01-11T09:44:00.000Z	dstaudt	AmaroqWolf	i've tried many different players with mp3 working, so it's possible
2007-01-11T09:45:00.000Z	dstaudt		i tend to use 'unsupported scripts' to set up all my non-free stuff though, so i can't advise much
2007-01-11T09:45:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	dstaudt	I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I've installed every package under the sun, that I know of anyway. lol. I can't play avi's either. They play, but there's sound and no video.
