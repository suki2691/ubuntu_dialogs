2006-01-14T06:26:00.000Z	Belboz99		Hey, how would I enable DMA for an SATA HD?
2006-01-14T06:27:00.000Z	Belboz99		would it be "sdparm"?
2006-01-14T06:28:00.000Z	mjr	Belboz99	you shouldn't really have to (but if your drive really isn't communicating with DMA, I don't know how to fix that)
2006-01-14T06:29:00.000Z	Belboz99	mjr	lowman62, thanks, I just read that SATA has DMA already enabled
