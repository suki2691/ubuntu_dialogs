2010-03-22T06:54:00.000Z	xangua	Richiie	use a native torrent app
2010-03-22T06:55:00.000Z	Richiie	xangua	yeah but the problem is that Transmissoion etc is banned on big private trackers
2010-03-22T06:56:00.000Z	Richiie	xangua	is Deluge good for torrent sites that are private ? for example torrentleech
