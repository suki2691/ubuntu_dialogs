2010-02-12T16:08:00.000Z	nfd		Hello all! Apologies if this is the wrong place, but I was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction. Installed 9.10 on an Apple MBP, was expecting to see my wifi driver in Admin>Hardware Drivers, but I don't. But Network Tools doesn't see a wireless interface. How can I tell if there's a driver installed for this card, or, otherwise, what else should I do?
2010-02-12T16:10:00.000Z	ke1ha	nfd	is your card seen when you do lspci ?
2010-02-12T16:10:00.000Z	ke1ha	nfd	also, did it work during LiveCD ?
2010-02-12T16:12:00.000Z	ke1ha	nfd	ok, and in the network manager it's not bringing up the WifI card at all ?
