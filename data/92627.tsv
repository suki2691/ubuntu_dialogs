2008-05-08T17:06:00.000Z	edreamleo		Several questions: first why did I get edubuntu when I asked for ubuntu 8.04, and is there a significant difference between ubuntu and edubuntu?
2008-05-08T17:06:00.000Z	jrib	edreamleo	asked who for ubuntu?
2008-05-08T17:07:00.000Z	edreamleo	jrib	I asked update manager to update, and got edubuntu instead of ubuntu
2008-05-08T17:08:00.000Z	jrib	edreamleo	probably means the edubuntu-desktop package was installed
