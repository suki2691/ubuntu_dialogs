2009-08-05T06:19:00.000Z	bankix	Mike_lifeguard	You'll have to add the mount option "user". Then every user may mount it, own it, and unmount it.
2009-08-05T06:20:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	bankix	do I need "defaults" too?
2009-08-05T06:21:00.000Z	bankix	Mike_lifeguard	Depends. "defaults" is short for a number of options, the manpage shows which. If you need them, keep "defaults". I would.
