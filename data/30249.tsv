2010-06-17T19:26:00.000Z	FoolsRun		Hi, basic question: for an education-oriented LTSP server, would it be better to use the latest release of Edubuntu, or the latest release of Ubuntu and install the packages I need from there?
2010-06-17T19:26:00.000Z	FoolsRun		Kind of a silly question when I type itout
2010-06-17T19:27:00.000Z	projekt2	FoolsRun	latest version has the ltsp install as an option
2010-06-17T19:28:00.000Z	FoolsRun	projekt2	the latest version of which?
