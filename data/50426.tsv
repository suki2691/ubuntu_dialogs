2010-03-15T22:03:00.000Z	infid		i just ejected a dvd movie and ubuntu is acting like it's still in there, in the sense that the drive is still named after the dvd and it's not seeming to read the new DVD i put in. What should i do?
2010-03-15T22:03:00.000Z	oddy	infid	restart?
2010-03-15T22:04:00.000Z	infid	oddy	i got ubuntu since it's not windows in the sense of having to be restarted to fix every little thing though ;)
2010-03-15T22:05:00.000Z	infid	oddy	i tried that before but now it's working. thanks
