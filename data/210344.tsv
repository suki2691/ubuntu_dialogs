2010-08-18T03:38:00.000Z	nsaw		I am trying to install the Ubuntu Server CD on a SunFire v40z with an USB keybord due to lack of a ps2 one. I can open the Bios with the usb keyboard, but if i try to install ubuntu i can not leave the language selection because the keyboard seems not to work during booting the ubuntu cd. I didn't find an option to enable usb keyboard support in the bios. Is there anoter install cd which skips the language selection?
