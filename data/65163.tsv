2009-03-03T21:19:00.000Z	berkes		how do I associate filetypes in ubuntu (or more specific gedit)? I recently merged from kubuntu, in KDE there is  a sidewide configscreen for this.

2009-03-03T21:23:00.000Z	berkes	evantandersen	thanks, but that is not the one I am looking for. That tool only allows a few base apps to be set.
