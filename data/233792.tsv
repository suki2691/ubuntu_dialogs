2009-06-22T02:43:00.000Z	mannafest		Hi, I am trying to install ubuntu, I get to the screen that asks me to try without changing my computer, install, check disk etc.  I try to install but it just goes to a grey screen and doesnt do anything. I have tried the forums and couldnt find anything on this problem.
