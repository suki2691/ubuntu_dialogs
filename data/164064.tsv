2007-01-17T09:57:00.000Z	bic		im having trouble getting a cd to work, ive downloaded 3 different isos, and burned 3 different times, the lastest one i burned at 2x speed and when i did a cd check i got a bad checksum

2007-01-17T09:58:00.000Z	bulmer	bic	you can mount an iso like so...  mount -o loop  /path/to/file.iso  /mnt
2007-01-17T10:00:00.000Z	bulmer	bic	man mount .... mount is the command to mount a filesystem into your linux
