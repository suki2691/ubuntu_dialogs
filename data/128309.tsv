2007-07-11T13:33:00.000Z	peterD		I am with an uncle here and I have installed ubuntu but I dont have the option to set the resolution higher than 800x600 in the gnome panel, but I see 1024 in the xorg.conf

2007-07-11T13:36:00.000Z	peterD	dxdt	where do I set the refresh rate in xorg.conf?
2007-07-11T13:37:00.000Z	dxdt	peterD	ummm  I can't really say exactly off the top of my head and I'm not at my computer.  Usually they are commented and in there.  you can then either read the specs for your monitor or just guess some ranges and try with trial and error
