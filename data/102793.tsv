2008-01-25T08:42:00.000Z	TaintedT1x	rupestre	Possibly, some googling should find out if you are supported easily, but I think compiz fusion is installed by default on Gutsy if your card supports it...I might be wrong though
2008-01-25T08:44:00.000Z	TaintedT1x	rupestre	I know it was installed by default on my lappy as it's cars is supported, and not on my desktop as its card is not
