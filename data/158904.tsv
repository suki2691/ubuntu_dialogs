2006-11-21T09:02:00.000Z	v3xtr1		How can I open a file that has no extension?  I'm getting a "Could not add application to the application database" when trying to open trash-applet with a text editor.
2006-11-21T09:03:00.000Z	v3xtr1		I tried that, and went specifically to it.
2006-11-21T09:03:00.000Z	v3xtr1		Although VIM doesn't like it much.
2006-11-21T09:03:00.000Z	rioghal	v3xtr1	youre trying to open the trash applet with a text editor?
