2007-11-05T15:41:00.000Z	livingdaylight		i just installed ubuntu using alternate cd and it asks constantly for cd when i want to install something... its a bit annoying
2007-11-05T15:42:00.000Z	livingdaylight		odd experience with alternate cd was it asked me for region where i am but only gave me n american options . Second time it didn't
