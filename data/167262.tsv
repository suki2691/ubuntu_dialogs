2009-05-14T01:00:00.000Z	eyore15		 I'm running OOo3.0 on Ubuntu 9.04. I would like to make a "master copy" of OOo that includes the extensions and templates I've added to my personal copy.  Is there someway to do this in Ubuntu?  Some application that will meet my needs?  tnx

2009-05-14T01:03:00.000Z	Piet	eyore15	i would think that if you didi it as a normal user then they will be stored somewhere in ~/.openoffice.org2/
