2010-05-06T01:29:00.000Z	icepeda		does somebody can help me?, I just upgrade my ubuntu distro to 10.04 amd64, but the windows manager is not working, I try to enable it but it depends from swfdec-mozilla and that crash with epiphany-extensions ( one remove the other) and both are needed for install gnome package, any idea how to take out this dependencies?, or does someone face this error?
