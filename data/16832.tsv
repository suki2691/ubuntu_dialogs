2011-04-05T13:28:00.000Z	andruha		how do i display this network information IP address, routes, name servers in terminal?
2011-04-05T13:29:00.000Z	shomon	andruha	ifconfig?
2011-04-05T13:29:00.000Z	shomon		that'll give your IP and a few bits of info, maybe not all you need
2011-04-05T13:29:00.000Z	andruha	shomon	that only shows ip... no name servers or routes
