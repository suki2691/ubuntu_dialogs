2005-10-11T05:13:00.000Z	demianmax	mylastmorning	look at the alien package to use rpms etc
2005-10-11T05:14:00.000Z	demianmax	mylastmorning	you can use alien to install rpms and other packages onto a debian based machine like ubuntu
2005-10-11T05:14:00.000Z	demianmax	mylastmorning	i'd stick with deb files though, much easier
