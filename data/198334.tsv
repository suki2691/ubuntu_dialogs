2006-09-05T10:47:00.000Z	ACU		Does anyone knows about any application for Windows similar to NetMeeting (but open source if possible)?
2006-09-05T10:48:00.000Z	synic	ACU	there's something called gnome-meeting I think
2006-09-05T10:50:00.000Z	ACU	synic	Thanks, I know there is Ekiga and GnomeMeeting but they are both for Linux only and I need something for Windows (Except NetMeeting)
2006-09-05T10:50:00.000Z	synic	ACU	oh, I was all backwards.
