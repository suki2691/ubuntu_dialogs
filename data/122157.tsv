2007-09-11T11:06:00.000Z	brunner		I just installed ubuntu and when I was running off of the live cd I allowed it to use the unsupported X driver.  Now X won't start.  Within xorg.conf, how do I change it back to the default driver?
2007-09-11T11:07:00.000Z	brunner		sorry, I meant that I enabled the unsupported ATI driver and don't know what to change in xorg.conf to set it back.
2007-09-11T05:45:00.000Z	saint-takesh2	brunner	just disable it in the unsupported driver manager thing, then run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
