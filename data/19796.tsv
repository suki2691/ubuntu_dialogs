2011-03-21T19:21:00.000Z	Fuchs	Squarism	you can use dpkg -i to install .deb files, but it is not recommended and it won't take care of any dependencies
2011-03-21T19:22:00.000Z	Squarism	Fuchs	if i have one version installed.. will it "overwrite" that?
2011-03-21T19:22:00.000Z	Fuchs	Squarism	if the version is newer: yes, it will. Chances are as well that it doesn't detect that it is an already existing application and only overwrites the files,
