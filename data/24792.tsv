2010-10-09T00:32:00.000Z	semitones	theabyssdragon	is there a way to run "users and groups" from terminal to see why "add" isn't working for a13?
2010-10-09T00:33:00.000Z	theabyssdragon	semitones	like a gksudo command? I'm not sure
2010-10-09T00:34:00.000Z	semitones	theabyssdragon	like the command that actually runs "users and groups" gui
2010-10-09T00:34:00.000Z	theabyssdragon	semitones	good idea
