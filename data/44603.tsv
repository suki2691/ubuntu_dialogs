2009-12-14T04:02:00.000Z	zamba		i have a set of mp3 files that i want to make accessible over the web, by using some sort of streaming technology.. to make it simple for my users to stream these files i want to embed them in a web page and use a specialized player for it, instead of relying on client software for playback.. anyone got any idea how i can fix this?
