2011-04-03T11:38:00.000Z	morning		I seem to have broken the association between Yelp and the documents it should read. (Likely cause: I messed with a file in usr/share/gnome/help/internet/C.) And so the Help documents no longer open.

2011-04-03T11:38:00.000Z	morning		I gather that I can go to the file I messed up, click "open with," add a "custom command," add "Yelp ghelp" as the right application to use, and have that apply to all similar files. But it seems some further argument is needed.
