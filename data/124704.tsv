2007-09-04T05:12:00.000Z	ScorpKing		how is it possible to have dns but route -n shows '0.0.0.0  0.0.0.0  0.0.0.0  U 0 0 0 ppp0' ? resolve.conf shows 10.11.12.13/14 but i can't ping either. and how do i find the current dns servers?

2007-09-04T05:15:00.000Z	ScorpKing	slavik`lap	it is my default dailup connection .
2007-09-04T05:15:00.000Z	slavik`lap	ScorpKing	hmm ... I dunno what to say (never used dial up past win98)
