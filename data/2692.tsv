2012-06-06T17:50:00.000Z	Seryth		Hey guys, I just updated from 11.10 to 12.04, and I've got two problems. One is that I have no audio at all, and the other is that I cannot use apt-get....I get this error: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1026848/ I don't understand it...
2012-06-06T17:51:00.000Z	AceFace	Seryth	try reinstalling dpkg?
2012-06-06T17:51:00.000Z	Seryth	AceFace	I can't apt-get remove anything either
2012-06-06T17:51:00.000Z	Seryth	AceFace	I can't use apt-get anywhere
