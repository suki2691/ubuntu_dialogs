2006-06-24T16:06:00.000Z	nakedp		Long story short -> I was trying to install Vista on a spare parition, and when I went to delete it (via vista's installer), it also deleted my Ubuntu /home directory parition, and an old swap parition
2006-06-24T16:06:00.000Z	nakedp		Is there anyway to recreate/restore my partitions to get my /home partition back?
2006-06-24T16:06:00.000Z	splashtech	nakedp	if it actually wiped the partition, and/or worse, wrote a new one in its place, I would very much doubt it
2006-06-24T16:09:00.000Z	nakedp	splashtech	I can boot into my current install of Dapper, and I have access to gparted and anything else, I just don't know what to do
