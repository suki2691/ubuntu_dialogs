2008-02-05T22:59:00.000Z	UniverseMan		Hi everyone. I'm trying to install Ubuntu 7.10 for the first time and I have a problem.  Twice now, the installer has frozen at 15% on "Installing System | Detecting file systems..."  I've waited like 20 minutes and nothing is happening and there is no response to the mouse or keyboard; the cursor doesn't even move. Any suggestions?
2008-02-05T23:00:00.000Z	rinaldi_	UniverseMan	have you tried doing the memory check and "check cd for defects"?
2008-02-05T23:00:00.000Z	rinaldi_	UniverseMan	if you get any errors that could be your problem
2008-02-05T23:01:00.000Z	rinaldi_	UniverseMan	yes, my laptop hung in the installation and turned out the ram was faulty, just an idea
