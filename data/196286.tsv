2006-03-08T12:55:00.000Z	M_A_K		Can someone tell me how to mount my CD? I put one in, but it does not mount.
2006-03-08T12:56:00.000Z	once1er	M_A_K	 use the following command from a terminal    mount /dev/hdc /media/cdrom0
2006-03-08T12:58:00.000Z	once1er	M_A_K	gnome and kde should both have device monitors that automatically mount them
2006-03-08T12:58:00.000Z	once1er	M_A_K	if they don't, i don't know how to fix them. maybe its disable-able somewhere?
