2009-10-17T09:47:00.000Z	FAJALOU		Hi I just turned on my system and my wireless internet is not working.  I am running ath9k drivers, and it was working before, I have tried two different kernels and no luck, i was thinking that it was because of maybe me removing something important?  I would appreciate help.  WICD just sticks on "validating authentication"  I am getting in the logs that wlan0 is not ready??? help please!  I am getting also alot of direct probe to AP
