2009-04-26T07:10:00.000Z	PhotoJim	homeskill	it can, if you use the -p flag.
2009-04-26T07:11:00.000Z	homeskill	PhotoJim	thanks, is that as good as rsync -a?
2009-04-26T07:11:00.000Z	PhotoJim	homeskill	as far as ownership and such, yes, but cp and rsync are really different tools fir different jobs.
