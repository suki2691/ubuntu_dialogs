2006-01-18T09:54:00.000Z	ajmitch	GameOver	superkaramba depends on xmms, though, so it won't let you without doing Bad Things like --force
2006-01-18T09:54:00.000Z	ajmitch	GameOver	ie, you do that, you get to keep all the pieces
2006-01-18T09:55:00.000Z	ajmitch	GameOver	because some functionality in superkaramba requires xmms
