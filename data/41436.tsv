2011-06-15T06:19:00.000Z	Kevin147		I'm having trouble with Ubuntu Server. Everytime I go to install the base system, it gives me errors that 'this file' is corrupt. I've burned like 3-4 disks or more, so its not my disks. and I've downloaded it from ubuntu.com so what could the problem be?
2011-06-15T06:20:00.000Z	quant	Kevin147	your hard drive could be the problem
2011-06-15T06:21:00.000Z	Kevin147	quant	how can my HD be the problem? I can burn ubuntu 11.04 on it just fine. I just want the server version on it, and I get a bunch of crap.
2011-06-15T06:22:00.000Z	quant	Kevin147	because tens of thousands of people are downloading that same file with no problem... so I doubt that the .iso is damaged, check other options
