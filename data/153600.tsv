2012-03-07T02:43:00.000Z	junctions		Quick question: How do you upgrade a xubuntu Karmic Koala (9.10, no longer supported) with a bootable USB alternate drive for 11.10?
2012-03-07T02:43:00.000Z	junctions		 (I want to upgrade, not do a fresh install)
2012-03-07T02:44:00.000Z	junctions		In the software sources it has "Add CD-ROM" which doesn't prompt me for USB information (computer has no optical drive unit)
2012-03-07T02:44:00.000Z	Pricey	junctions	You could download the alternate cd and upgrade off off that I believe.
