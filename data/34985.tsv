2010-03-31T17:10:00.000Z	e-DIO-t		pardon: does anyone knows how to open a new gnome-terminal tab? gnome-terminal --tab-with-profile=Default actually opens a new window.
2010-03-31T17:12:00.000Z	e-DIO-t		guntbert:, gottto -> actually done -> it should be gnome-terminal --tab-with-profile ...but it opens a new windows instead of a new tab
2010-03-31T17:14:00.000Z	sjorsr	e-DIO-t	same problem here, i suppose it's a bug?
2010-03-31T17:15:00.000Z	e-DIO-t	sjorsr	dunno :°°° but it's quit unconfortable.
