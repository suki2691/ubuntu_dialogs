2005-12-16T16:46:00.000Z	peter_		that question goes out to anyone lol
2005-12-16T16:46:00.000Z	smo	peter_	that depends entirely on what you use each of them for.  in your position, I'd probably keep both until you're comfortable with which will do what you need better
2005-12-16T16:50:00.000Z	smo	peter_	given BT's track record, I'd try their software only if nothing else works.  if it's working with out it, stay without it
