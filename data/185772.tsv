2006-05-17T13:44:00.000Z	newtuxman	salmiak_	 what i want is that when i click the domain, it gives m ea list of all the other computers on the doimain... we add and remove boxes that i need to make use off to frequently to make static links all over my desktop
2006-05-17T13:44:00.000Z	newtuxman		but, even with what i see here, i can ONLY access the shared directories on the domain server, and for some reason its not even getting all of them
2006-05-17T13:46:00.000Z	salmiak_	newtuxman	ah, as i understand it, you don't want to be a samba server, you just want to be a client?
