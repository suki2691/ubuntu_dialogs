2010-09-11T17:24:00.000Z	Whacka	ilovefairuz	Is there any way to check if it's muted or not first so I can make a script that toggles it? (pulseaudio)
2010-09-11T17:41:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Whacka	here's another and simpler command but first you need to find which index mutes and umutes the device: on my system i mute with 'pacmd set-source-mute 1 1' ( or last 1 to 0 to umute) .. to check if muted:  pacmd list-sources | grep mute | tail -n 1 | cut -d ':' -f 2
