2007-10-28T20:55:00.000Z	Search4Lancer	threeseas	I've had this problem before, it's not the bios, and I've been searching high and low for the fix I used before and can't find it... one of the problems is that /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/ is empty
2007-10-28T20:59:00.000Z	threeseas	Search4Lancer	I don't know but did google "/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/ is empty" and found some things...
