2007-04-22T13:20:00.000Z	ferret_0567	braveheartlion	To install the ATI/NVIDIA drivers from repos, for (X)ubuntu, you could use 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop', for Kubuntu, 'sudo /etc/init.d/kdm stop'
2007-04-22T13:20:00.000Z	braveheartlion	ferret_0567	but first i should make sure that video card is in fact a ATI or NVIDIa, shouldn't i?
2007-04-22T13:26:00.000Z	braveheartlion	ferret_0567	i meant, if i findou out that my video card is not ATI or nvidia, can i conclude that the problem with "Check CD  for defects" blanking out my computer is not related to my video card?
