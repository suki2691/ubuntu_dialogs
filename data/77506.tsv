2012-09-22T19:43:00.000Z	BluesKaj	dada_	can you umount the partition ?
2012-09-22T19:43:00.000Z	dada_	BluesKaj	don't have much experience with umount, but I'll try that in a second if this does not work..
2012-09-22T19:44:00.000Z	dada_		sure's taking a while..
2012-09-22T19:46:00.000Z	dada_	BluesKaj	OerHeks: seems I'm able to delete the partition now (after using gparted's "swapoff"), thanks both!
