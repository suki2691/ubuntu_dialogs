2010-02-12T08:39:00.000Z	RaNdY		Hi, I was updating to bash 4.1 when I've accidentally deleted /bin/bash which was my default. And now I can't login to the system, any ideas on how to enter the system again?

2010-02-12T08:42:00.000Z	RaNdY	ZykoticK9	no other way to login? System is still up.. looking for alternative ways to enter it.
