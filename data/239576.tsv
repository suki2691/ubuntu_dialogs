2005-05-10T13:25:00.000Z	Raskall	Kisain_	yes. lots.. but gaim is the one included in the default install. but you won't get video and audio conferencing. not games either. just the chatting.

2005-05-10T13:28:00.000Z	Raskall	Kisain_	amsn is also good, but my recommendation is to just start Gaim from "Applications->Internet"
