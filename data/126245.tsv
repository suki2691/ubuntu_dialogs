2007-08-04T05:16:00.000Z	ladydoor	xenoie	Right right...I was just hoping for better compression, because I'd kind of like to try and encrypt my /home partition and don't really have a lot of available backup space, but do have a *whole lot* of data. *shrug*
2007-08-04T05:16:00.000Z	ladydoor	xenoie	Oh well.
