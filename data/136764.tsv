2007-04-30T09:46:00.000Z	Baktaah		Does anyone know of an application that will turn multiple .png pictures into .svg and resize them at the same time, and NO I am not intrested of knowing what vectors and other stuff is, -> I did manage to convert .png to .svg via inkscape, but I have ALOT of files to do, so doing it manually would take too much time
2007-04-30T09:46:00.000Z	Baktaah		if Inkscape could do it, how come others (according to you) is impossible
2007-04-30T09:48:00.000Z	Baktaah		let me rephrase
2007-04-30T09:48:00.000Z	sn0	Baktaah	check up on the command, i haven't tested
