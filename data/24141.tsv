2012-05-14T14:36:00.000Z	nailora		i have a plain text file and i'd rather not store it in plain text, but encrypt it somehow. high security is not very important, more important is that i can simply open the file, where i am asked for a password, then edit the text and saving automatically works with encryption? any ideas?

2012-05-14T14:41:00.000Z	KM0201	nailora	it's not really encryption, it just password protects the document.
