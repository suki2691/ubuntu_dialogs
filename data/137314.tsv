2007-05-29T09:53:00.000Z	eck		change the driver line in your xorg.conf to intel rather than i810
2007-05-29T09:53:00.000Z	Morpheus_74	eck	Where can I find and install the intell drivers?
2007-05-29T09:54:00.000Z	eck	Morpheus_74	xserver-xorg-video-intel (this is just a guess, it recently fixed an intel graphics issue for me)
