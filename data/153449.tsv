2007-08-17T16:05:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dorota	sure he can keep it, he can do whatever he wants, but Windows Me i believe stands for Windows MEss  it was by far the most glitchy windows OS in this era
2007-08-17T16:07:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dorota	thats what i was thinking.. use 2k for whatever lab work he needs, and ubuntu for every day stuff.
