2009-03-12T18:54:00.000Z	mcpasdgarrett		I'm still having issues with getting my xset mouse 1 1 to automatically run.  I'm thinking that the suggestions were for running it on startup, but that doesn't seem to work because it needs to be executed after login, or where X starts.  Where do a put a script to run when X starts?
