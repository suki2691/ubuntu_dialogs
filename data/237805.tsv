2005-05-23T10:15:00.000Z	anto9us		only problem with pgaccess is you have to make sure all your objects are named in lower-case in postgresql
2005-05-23T10:15:00.000Z	Lars_G	anto9us	Yes, but us Lazy Sods like PgAdmin III since it knows Pg in and out and helps you with forms for everything.. it saves typing and looking at docs.
2005-05-23T10:16:00.000Z	anto9us	Lars_G	me too, pgaccess has form and report funcionality too
