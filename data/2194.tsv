2012-07-02T01:59:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	kristenB	most service can be restarted with the command "sudo service <name> restart"
2012-07-02T01:59:00.000Z	kristenB	HelloWorld321	and that's not the case in windows?
2012-07-02T02:00:00.000Z	kristenB	HelloWorld321	i think the command 'netstop' in windows does just that
