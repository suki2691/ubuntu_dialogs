2005-04-17T11:47:00.000Z	robzulah		I'm trying to install KDE so I can use a few KDE programs, when I check KDE in synaptic it tells me a bunch of others have to be installed, so I tell it to check those then it tells me all of those packages have unresolved dependencies and wont be installed, any idea why?
