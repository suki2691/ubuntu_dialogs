2010-08-06T01:26:00.000Z	SCD[Eire]		Hey guys. Cheese can see my webcam but no other program can. How can I fix this? :P the webcam is located in /dev/video0
2010-08-06T01:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	SCD[Eire]	someone last night had a similar issue and fixed it by running "qcset /dev/video0 compat=dblbuf"
2010-08-06T01:30:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	SCD[Eire]	someone else suggested turning cheese on (to turn the camera on) - then try other programs
2010-08-06T01:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	SCD[Eire]	sorry man that's all i got - it was from someone else last night.  good luck.
