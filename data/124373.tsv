2007-11-30T21:32:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	jurgentje	you dont need the kubuntu-desktop package
2007-11-30T21:33:00.000Z	jurgentje	devilsadvocate	well... that's how I have all the apt-update stuff etc... in KDE :p
2007-11-30T21:34:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	jurgentje	not really. its needed only when first installing. an aptitude uprade will upgrade all install packages, not just kubunut-desktop
