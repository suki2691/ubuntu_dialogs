2009-06-15T10:14:00.000Z	ectospasm	kazagistar	no, my client is fine.  No need to type an extra character IMO.
2009-06-15T10:16:00.000Z	kazagistar	ectospasm	I think it is more practical to fix a client (either write the code or a bug report) than to fix other peoples habits on something as arbitrary as IRC notation
2009-06-15T10:16:00.000Z	ectospasm	kazagistar	I've only seen the @ references today, and I've been using IRC for a long time.
