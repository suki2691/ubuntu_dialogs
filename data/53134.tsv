2009-07-09T08:54:00.000Z	OttifantSir	_ged	I followed what I read yesterday, and simply copy-moved gnome-panel from /usr/bin to a folder in my home-folder. If I want it back, I'll copy-move it back to /usr/bin. The lower panel is apparently as easy as right-click and add panel
2009-07-09T08:55:00.000Z	_ged	OttifantSir	ahm, how did you copied the gnome-panel?? is there a dir or folder of gnome?
2009-07-09T08:56:00.000Z	OttifantSir	_ged	I did something dangerous, and used Nautilus as superuser. sudo mv /usr/bin/gnome-panel /backup/folder is preferred
2009-07-09T08:56:00.000Z	_ged	OttifantSir	well, just as u said, its in the /usr/bin ^_^ thanks thanks
