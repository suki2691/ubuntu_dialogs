2009-12-29T22:48:00.000Z	llutz	Ricoshady	you should use what you feel comfortable with.
2009-12-29T22:49:00.000Z	Ricoshady	llutz	that makes sense, I guess Im looking for some opinions as to why they like unbuntu more
2009-12-29T22:50:00.000Z	llutz	Ricoshady	never ask users why they like their distro more.... 99% just FUD/bashing
