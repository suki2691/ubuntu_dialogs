2008-09-01T19:48:00.000Z	Vexik		Hello, I got a problem, kind of an embarassing problem.
2008-09-01T19:49:00.000Z	Vexik		I was installing Ubuntu on this PC until it prompted me to make the user account, I filled in the form and it installed but now I think I entered the wrong password and I forgot it... is there a remedy or do I need to reinstall? :/
