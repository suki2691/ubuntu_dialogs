2008-08-11T15:28:00.000Z	prince_jammys	cherva	try mounting by mount point instead of dev, like mount /media/cdrom
2008-08-11T15:29:00.000Z	prince_jammys	cherva	sorry, i see now that you mentioned that you tried 'cdrom'
2008-08-11T15:29:00.000Z	cherva	prince_jammys	I tried that "mount: special device /dev/hdc does not exist" but when I put a cd it automounts
