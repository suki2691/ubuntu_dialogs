2008-04-20T10:54:00.000Z	kevcox_		Can anyone tell me how to troubleshoot a network issue?  It seems that in exactly 10 minutes my network connection goes down but I'm not shure why.
2008-04-20T10:54:00.000Z	kevcox_		 It is quickly restored but it goes down 10 minutes later knocking me off SSH
2008-04-20T10:54:00.000Z	kevcox_		This occures within my LAN
2008-04-20T10:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	kevcox_	 wireless?
