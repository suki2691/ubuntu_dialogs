2010-09-15T06:05:00.000Z	harovali		hi , I have a 9.10 system whose root partition needs manual recover. I'm on the phone with the user, who finds in trouble to press a key precisely in the very short span when the "GRUB Loading" message shows. I'd like the span to be longer, but what I'd need the most right now is a "deterministic" key sequence that shows the GRUB menu depending as little as posible on the short span there given. Has  anyone had to deal with

2010-09-15T06:06:00.000Z	tensorpudding	harovali	so long as the bios doesn't use the shift key
