2006-05-15T16:48:00.000Z	LittleFae		Hello there people.
2006-05-15T16:49:00.000Z	LittleFae		I am in need of a little, hopefully minor, assistance with Ubuntu Hoary Hedgehog, and the nautilus file browser.  Namely, I don't want it to run every single time, I click on 'browse to' in an application, whilst I'm running under xfce.
2006-05-15T16:51:00.000Z	LittleFae		Is there a simple way to ensure that, at the very least, this nautilus crap doesn't take over the desktop, then?
