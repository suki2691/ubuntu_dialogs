2010-12-17T01:04:00.000Z	nirazio		Sometime ago I just tested to see if I could login to desktop from root, and I succeeded. I clicked on Others on the userlist and entered root and its password and logged in. Now I'd like to know how we can disable root login altogether. I didn't see any option as such in the Login Screen.
