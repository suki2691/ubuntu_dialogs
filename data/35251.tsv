2010-04-26T01:08:00.000Z	howlymowly		hi poeple..  I used an ubuntu start-disk to create a portable operating system on my usb disk...
2010-04-26T01:08:00.000Z	howlymowly		I now want to access that system using ssh..
2010-04-26T01:08:00.000Z	howlymowly		what do I do with the password?  using "ubuntu" username it asks me for a password.. but I don't have one?
2010-04-26T01:09:00.000Z	Oer	howlymowly	if you leave username empty, pass - ubuntu
