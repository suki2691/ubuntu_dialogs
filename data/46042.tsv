2010-01-15T23:52:00.000Z	nintnint		Hey, I know this is a simple problem because I've had it before but I can't remember how to fix it.  VLC is player a video in a seperate window, not in the player itself.
2010-01-15T23:52:00.000Z	nintnint		How do I make the video and the player controls in one window?
2010-01-15T23:52:00.000Z	MASARUwota	nintnint	what player?
