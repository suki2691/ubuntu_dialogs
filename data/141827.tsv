2007-08-23T12:01:00.000Z	Slor		Just need a quick recommendation - I have a machine with dual P3-550 procs and 512MB RAM that I want to use primarily for internet services (ssh, ftp, maybe web, mail, etc.) and would also like to have at least basic local graphical desktop.  What distro might be best suited as "mostly server with some desktop" installation on that hardware?
2007-08-23T12:01:00.000Z	SeveredCross	Slor	You can get ubuntu server edition and then install xubuntu on top of that?
