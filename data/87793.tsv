2008-06-12T21:02:00.000Z	hoonteke		so, I'm trying to attach a secondary monitor on to which I'd like to extend my desktop.  are there any tutorials for this?
2008-06-12T21:02:00.000Z	XAVeRY	hoonteke	: again, it depends on the card.
2008-06-12T21:03:00.000Z	hoonteke	XAVeRY	 nVidia, but I can't use the nVidia driver, apparently.  My screen just plain doesn't work, goes haywire.
2008-06-12T21:03:00.000Z	XAVeRY	hoonteke	: well, that's bad. I don't know how to help you, then.
