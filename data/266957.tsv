2010-08-06T16:30:00.000Z	ttyX		OK, I am in a bit of confusion here
2010-08-06T16:31:00.000Z	ttyX		disk utility says my HDD has 1 bad sector but the hdd passes all seatools tests with flying colours, whom shud I trust?
2010-08-06T16:32:00.000Z	ttyX		even hdd regenerator says it has no bad sectors
2010-08-06T16:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ttyX	  i find most disks can report 1 or more bad sectors.. the sectors get remapped. thats how they work.
