2005-11-10T12:31:00.000Z	cdubya		I installed mysql, apache2 and php4 on Breezy, but I'm getting an error when I try to load up phpMyAdmin about it missing a mysql extension. Which extension do I need to install?
2005-11-10T12:32:00.000Z	SEJeff	cdubya	php4-mysql or php5-mysql
2005-11-10T12:39:00.000Z	cdubya	SEJeff	cool. php4-mysql worked like a charm. Thanks.
