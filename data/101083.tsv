2008-03-09T01:30:00.000Z	Deeppact	bartmon	yes i already know how to compile but i want to know basics like Hello world etc
2008-03-09T01:31:00.000Z	Deeppact	bartmon	i knew Html already so i got a A+ and i like that :P
2008-03-09T01:32:00.000Z	bartmon	Deeppact	Well then try googling "java basics" or sth. Java has a huge API but don't be intimidated, ignore it for now. :)
