2011-05-09T02:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fizyplankton	ask in a mac channel
2012-07-16T03:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fizyplankton	why not:  killall APP_NAME
2012-07-16T03:32:00.000Z	fizyplankton	ActionParsnip	because the internal appname is often different than the given name. for example, gnome-system-monitor is different than system\ monitor
