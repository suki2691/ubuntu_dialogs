2009-10-21T21:43:00.000Z	foul_owl		What is a .la file? I am trying to install SDL_image and SDL_net locally, since I do not have root privs. I tried building SDL_image and SDL_net from source, but I get .la files rather than .so and I don't know how to link to them....

2009-10-21T21:47:00.000Z	foul_owl	phako	thanks! I'll read the libtool docs
2009-10-21T21:47:00.000Z	foul_owl	phako	I found the libs.... :rolleyes:
