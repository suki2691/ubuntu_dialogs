2012-08-02T05:14:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy		Question: I recently had an experiance with a 1.6GHz Celeron (duel core) with 512MB of DDR RAM and integrated graphics. I used both Unity and GNOME2 fallback mode which both felt clunky and laggy. I installed CentOS and used it as a Desktop (minimal install and installed XORG/GNOME2) and it's running beatifully. The computer appears to exceed the minimial system requirements. Why would it feel as if my computer couldn't handle it well?

2012-08-02T05:15:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	steed	Never turned them on. GNOME2 fallback mode I didn't look since it was apperent it wasn't using any by default unless I'm wrong.
