2011-05-20T19:44:00.000Z	sec_goat		that's the one! Thanks Bazhang! But I thought I had recalled a way tomove them back in the past that might have been an earlier version i guess.

2011-05-20T19:45:00.000Z	sec_goat	bazhang	thanks again, I mostly use the CLI so iwill get used to the button placement
