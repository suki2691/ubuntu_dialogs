2011-02-20T09:12:00.000Z	clarkfischer_		I just installed the latest (Jaunty?) on my old tower with a nvidia GeForce video card, and I can't get resolution above 800x600, which is unusable!
2011-02-20T09:12:00.000Z	clarkfischer_		Is there anything I can do, any kind of drivers I can install to get higher resolution?
2011-02-20T09:13:00.000Z	xangua	clarkfischer_	jaunty is no longer supported
2011-02-20T09:13:00.000Z	clarkfischer_	xangua	then not jaunty
