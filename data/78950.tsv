2009-05-01T10:57:00.000Z	Kyo_Sohma2		can anybody give me some ideas as to why my ubuntu can't access the internet? its a fresh install of 9.0.4 and connected to a LAN newtork. It finds the connection and says successful, but can't get ott he internet. Yet, when I plus this vista machine into it, it connects just fine and can get on the web. Any ideas?
