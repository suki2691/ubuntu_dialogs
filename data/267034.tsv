2009-09-23T22:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dimitri	 you expect about a 5 hr dcc send? Not going to happen i imagine.
2009-09-23T22:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dimitri	 its not released yet anyway. best to wait.
2009-09-23T22:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dimitri	 trying what exactly?  Current state of 9.10 has been a bit of a roller coaster lately.
