2007-05-03T07:12:00.000Z	MoL3	xtknight	it's a 82801DBM (ICH4-M) IDE Controller
2007-05-03T07:13:00.000Z	xtknight	MoL3	well if you do decide to file a bug i'd post that.  nothing crossed my mind with regards to the ICH4 though...i only know of a problem where jmicron controllers revert to a lower DMA mode for little/no reason
2007-05-03T07:13:00.000Z	MoL3	xtknight	libata on launchpad do you think?
2007-05-03T07:14:00.000Z	xtknight	MoL3	could be the kernel.  for now i wouldn't specify a package (triagers will later handle that)
