2011-03-02T06:47:00.000Z	dandaman		is there a way to make my back audio jacks disable automatically when i plug into my front audio jack?
2011-03-02T06:48:00.000Z	dandaman		or is there software that lets me control jacks?
2011-03-02T06:49:00.000Z	Starminn	dandaman	I just found something in my Applications list I never saw before (probably installed with somehting else) called "JACK Audio Connection Kit" that may be worth a try?
2011-03-02T06:49:00.000Z	Starminn	dandaman	I know nothing about it though and even if I did I know nothing about jacks either so... ;)
