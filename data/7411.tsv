2011-12-01T03:54:00.000Z	robertfw		so, i've managed to break ~/.profile - i had added a call to launch a python script i wrote that detects if my virtualbox has provided multiple monitors, and makes the appropriate xrandr call - and now i can't login. i'm in recovery mode in the root shell, but the files are unmounted so i cant fix .profile from there. not sure where to go from here
