2008-12-24T10:23:00.000Z	mewshi		Hello!  Could I get some assistance getting Compiz/OpenGL to work properly again?
2008-12-24T10:24:00.000Z	mewshi		Well, I tried to hook up a second monitor to my laptop (for dual-head) and now it doesn't work anymore :(  How do I fix it?

2008-12-24T10:28:00.000Z	n8__	mewshi	have you tried starting compiz manually?
