2012-04-17T10:39:00.000Z	_r00t_		Hi, this is strange .... can you upgrade from 11.10 to the beta via do-release-upgrade -d ? src : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/TechnicalOverview/Beta2
2012-04-17T10:40:00.000Z	scientes	_r00t_	yes you can
2012-04-17T10:41:00.000Z	_r00t_	scientes	wow that's odd ! I'm sure you couldn't do that before ! :/
2012-04-17T10:43:00.000Z	_r00t_	scientes	so once I upgrade to the beta will I be able to do-release-upgrade once 12.04 LTS goes live ?
