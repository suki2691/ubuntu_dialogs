2011-10-29T05:23:00.000Z	napalm54		Newbie Question:  With ubuntu 11.10 how can I easily add a desktop shortcut/icon from the unity search results?
2011-10-29T05:24:00.000Z	xangua	napalm54	just drag it from the dash to the launcher
2011-10-29T05:25:00.000Z	napalm54	xangua	I would want it on the desktop, not on the launcher
2011-10-29T05:25:00.000Z	napalm54	xangua	When I drag from the unity search to the desktop it just makes a link that says is unsafe to use
