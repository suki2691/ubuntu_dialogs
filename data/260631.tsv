2004-11-19T15:03:00.000Z	theine		i mean is there a record from which repository a package has been installed?
2004-11-19T15:05:00.000Z	Azeal	theine	if you remove the 3rd party repository in Synaptic and then choose to view packages by Status they will appear under "Installed (local or obsolete)", I think
