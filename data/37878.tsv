2011-05-11T04:23:00.000Z	[V13]Axel	Snicers-Work3	I know for a fact it is; I can get them working on the Window Maker window manager, but without the ability to do much or 3D acceleration.
2011-05-11T04:24:00.000Z	[V13]Axel	Snicers-Work3	I have no idea-- It was working using Xinerama for a while, but that's only on the Window Maker manager.
2011-05-11T04:31:00.000Z	[V13]Axel	Snicers-Work3	I'm positive it works-- I can play full 3D games on either monitor, and both are using the manufacturer WDDM drivers on Windows.
