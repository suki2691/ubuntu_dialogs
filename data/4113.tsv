2012-04-23T03:10:00.000Z	bananapie		I am connected to a Windows Share using my Ubuntu 10.04 laptop. Is there an offline mode where it copies the files and syncs when the server is available ?
2012-04-23T03:10:00.000Z	yoophglup	bananapie	look up rsyn command for Linux.
2012-04-23T03:11:00.000Z	yoophglup		rsync I mean
2012-04-23T03:13:00.000Z	bananapie	yoophglup	I know of rsync, but I have only ever sent files one way. I did not know I could go bidirectional synching
