2011-01-02T03:22:00.000Z	goetter		sorry, console only i meant
2011-01-02T03:22:00.000Z	knoppies	goetter	I use the connect to menu and ssh (ts actually sftp or something I think)
2011-01-02T03:23:00.000Z	knoppies	goetter	once you have the drive mounted, I think xbmc can use it. I haven't tested that yet. Im not sure then, I haven't done much successful fiddling with samba
