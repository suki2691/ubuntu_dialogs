2008-10-18T06:41:00.000Z	KingOfDos		i'll try a "oldscool" setup with no dualscreen
2008-10-18T06:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KingOfDos	how is a single display "old skool"?
2008-10-18T06:42:00.000Z	KingOfDos		and the fact is, the "textmode" information comes only on the right screen, and the left screen is'nt working anymore :)
2008-10-18T06:42:00.000Z	KingOfDos	ActionParsnip	i was refering to my setup based on the X11 config with "single screen" setup. not for dual/single screen in general :)
