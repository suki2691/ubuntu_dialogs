2009-09-18T13:22:00.000Z	Nearsight	shivek	or at least not on an i386 installation.. try to get the package for your architecture type or considere compiling it from source
2009-09-18T13:23:00.000Z	shivek	Nearsight	Yeah I have an amd64 . I wasn't sure whether this was the problem, just wanted to confirm. What can I do to install it ?
2009-09-18T13:24:00.000Z	shivek	Nearsight	: The source is .tar.gz or .tgz , right ?!
