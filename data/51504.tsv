2011-09-19T18:23:00.000Z	kitche	rcmaehl	is the PATA setting set in your bios for SATA? that's the only way way ubuntu will recogie a drive as PATA if it is an sata if that option is set in the bios
2011-09-19T18:24:00.000Z	rcmaehl	kitche	there is no PATA setting in my bios
2011-09-19T18:26:00.000Z	rcmaehl	kitche	is there any other way because there isn't a PATA/SATA option on this netbook's bios
