2012-11-15T09:41:00.000Z	thrownawaytrash	almoxarife	that was actually what i have right now, however booting to it takes several minutes, and was told that you get a performance hit since it's still installed on an ntfs partition instead of a linux one

2012-11-15T09:47:00.000Z	thrownawaytrash	almoxarife	i will definitely do that.
