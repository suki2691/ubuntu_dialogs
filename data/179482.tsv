2007-03-08T12:04:00.000Z	Peter77		hi, I'm getting a core 2 duo laptop, should I use 32-bit or 64-bit linux on it?
2007-03-08T12:05:00.000Z	jrib	Peter77	if you like multimedia, use 32bit
2007-03-08T12:06:00.000Z	jrib	Peter77	flash isn't available on 64bit and getting some codecs like wmv is also cumbersome
2007-03-08T12:08:00.000Z	jrib	Peter77	yeah.  You could always install both and just see if you think it's worth the extra trouble to get flash and such to work on 64-bit
