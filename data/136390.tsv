2007-05-31T10:34:00.000Z	sahil		i recently installed Pidgin but the folder has a little lock icon on it and wont allow me to change the icons and stuff
2007-05-31T10:34:00.000Z	wols_	sahil	how did you install it? via ubuntu package or manually?
2007-05-31T10:35:00.000Z	sahil	wols_	i got the deb and just doubleclicked it
2007-05-31T10:35:00.000Z	wols_	sahil	then it should "just work". check the permissions of the folder with ls -l
