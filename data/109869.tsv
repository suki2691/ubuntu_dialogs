2010-01-26T01:07:00.000Z	SuspectZero		hey there
2010-01-26T01:07:00.000Z	SuspectZero		quick question, im looking at some stuff for karmic and i see that it has an xbased boot splash, is that possible already through an installion of some package?
2010-01-26T01:07:00.000Z	SuspectZero		or is that specifically for karmic?
2010-01-26T01:08:00.000Z	soreau	SuspectZero	afaik, it's specifically for karmic with open source graphics drivers
