2011-03-11T00:19:00.000Z	bajk-tragbar		any ideas why my sudoed windows in KDE have an ugly windows95-like widget style while the others have oxygen?
2011-03-11T00:19:00.000Z	bajk-tragbar		if I run systemsettings with sudo the sytle is oxygen but it isnt applied?

2011-03-11T00:20:00.000Z	Iatagore	bajk-tragbar	Not sure though
