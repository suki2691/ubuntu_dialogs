2008-05-21T03:02:00.000Z	tvynr	Gr34t3st	Oh, okay.  So you're trying to replace Windows ME with Ubuntu, yes?
2008-05-21T03:03:00.000Z	tvynr	Gr34t3st	I don't know of any good virtualization software that will run properly under Windows ME.  (For that part, I don't know very much software that will run properly in Windows ME.)  What were you using?
