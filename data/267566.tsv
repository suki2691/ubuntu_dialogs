2010-09-08T08:29:00.000Z	maco	mobasher_	what client are you using? should be able to set the password in it
2010-09-08T08:31:00.000Z	maco	mobasher_	go into the configuration thing and select the freenode server
2010-09-08T08:31:00.000Z	maco	mobasher_	click edit, then enter your password in the "nickserv password" box
