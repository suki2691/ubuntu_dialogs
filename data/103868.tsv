2012-08-22T02:31:00.000Z	benji_		Hi, I have ubuntu 10.10 and I would like to upgrade a headless server, however I do not have the package update-manager-core, what should I do?
2012-08-22T02:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benji_	I would clean install with Precise
2012-08-22T02:32:00.000Z	benji_	ActionParsnip	I should be able to run a do-release-ugrade though no?
2012-08-22T02:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	benji_	I suggest you grab the alternate ISO for Natty and MD5 test then mount it and you can upgrade that way. You will be doing a LOT Of upgrading. A clean install will get you to Precise in one jump and will be a cleaner OS
