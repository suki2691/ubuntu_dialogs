2007-02-12T17:54:00.000Z	vblanton	gh0st	you could also try a minimum ubuntu install from the alternative disc
2007-02-12T17:55:00.000Z	gh0st	vblanton	is there one for flubuntu?
2007-02-12T17:56:00.000Z	vblanton	gh0st	actually. now that I think about it, i'm not 100% sure that there is a minimal install. but if flubuntu has an alternative install disc, then it would be there
