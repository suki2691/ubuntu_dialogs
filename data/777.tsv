2012-10-16T01:13:00.000Z	ElixirVitae		What about update manager, why does it not classify updates as apt-get does, I thought it was GUI for apt-get
2012-10-16T01:15:00.000Z	ElixirVitae		How do I decide if an update is worthy, I suppose I update all of the security updates?
2012-10-16T01:15:00.000Z	ElixirVitae		Should I check even the ones that make their ways to repos for possible bugs or whatnot?
2012-10-16T01:17:00.000Z	killmark	ElixirVitae	just wait for other's feedbacks before updating
