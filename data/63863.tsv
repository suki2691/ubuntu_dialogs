2012-05-20T21:21:00.000Z	Etale		I'm going to get a 500GB, 8GB RAM, 64-bit laptop tomorrow. I want an ubuntu distro that would be ideal for that sort of computer, but also doesn't have too much garbage pre-installed. Ultimately I want to use compiz. What would you suggest?
2012-05-20T21:23:00.000Z	Etale		Not even xubuntu?
2012-05-20T21:23:00.000Z	Etale		Or minimal ubuntu? lubuntu?
