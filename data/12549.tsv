2012-03-23T03:39:00.000Z	Scott_Z		what is the default root password?
2012-03-23T03:40:00.000Z	Scott_Z		I am running a livecd version, trying things out. I need to do an su root and it is asking for a password. I tried root, leaving it blank, and ubuntu.
2012-03-23T03:40:00.000Z	zykotick9	Scott_Z	try "sudo -i" instead
2012-03-23T03:41:00.000Z	zykotick9	Scott_Z	fyi, if you claim to need root (in ubuntu), probably means you are doing something wrong...
