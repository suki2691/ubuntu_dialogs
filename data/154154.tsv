2006-12-24T11:43:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	tuxplorer	did you check the sessions chooser?
2006-12-24T11:45:00.000Z	tuxplorer	nolimitsoya	how to add an entry? which file? /et/gdm/Session is not found in ubuntu
2006-12-24T11:46:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	tuxplorer	i have no idea. :) try the 'apt-get install -f' do apply and residual configurations, and make the sessions fileby hand if you think it should be there
