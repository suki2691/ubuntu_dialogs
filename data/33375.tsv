2010-04-28T07:25:00.000Z	peanutpan	wolfwalker_prime	i have not tried k3b.  it has all kinds of peculiar software dependencies so that i'd rather not have to deal with it if possible.  surely, if a program like k3b can get the job done, then there must be a more elegant solution as well?
2010-04-28T07:27:00.000Z	wolfwalker_prime	peanutpan	elegance is not the issue.  Getting the job done is the objective, and k3b has always worked well for me.  Hence the recommendation.  Couldn't hurt to try.
2010-04-28T07:29:00.000Z	peanutpan	wolfwalker_prime	well, if you insist, i will give k3b a go.
