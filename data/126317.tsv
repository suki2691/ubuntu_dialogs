2007-08-02T09:50:00.000Z	ClNorris		Google does not like to tell me answers. My question is how do you program screensavers for ubuntu?
2007-08-02T09:52:00.000Z	ClNorris		how does ubuntu handle screensavers? and how do I find out more information on making one?
2007-08-02T09:53:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	ClNorris	you need to search gnome screensavers, not ubuntu screensavers. Ubuntu is a distribution that uses gnome. Try in #gnome for more help.
2007-08-02T09:54:00.000Z	ClNorris	fyrestrtr	I know. Everywhere I look for informationrelating to gnome-screensaver. I get nothing.
