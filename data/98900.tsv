2009-07-21T19:42:00.000Z	new2linx	legend2440	that's already checked. i made sure of that right away because I am trying to get pulseaudio working
2009-07-21T19:44:00.000Z	new2linx	legend2440	erUSUL, now that's weird. if I open mplayer first, then select play file. it plays sound, BUT if I chose open with mplayer from within nautilus it won't play sound. any thoughts?
