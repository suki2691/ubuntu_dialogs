2005-06-09T10:32:00.000Z	DanielC	babaliciouse	How much experience do you have?
2005-06-09T10:33:00.000Z	DanielC	babaliciouse	For a newbie I'd recommend nvu. More seasoned users seem to like Quanta. I prefer bluefish.
2005-06-09T10:34:00.000Z	DanielC	babaliciouse	I don't know what dreamweaver is like, so I can't say which would be most similar. Sorry. So I guess just try nvu, bluefish and Quanta and see if you like any of them.
