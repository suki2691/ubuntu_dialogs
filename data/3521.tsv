2012-04-30T04:34:00.000Z	jk4287		Hi, I am sick of the Nvidia 295.xx drivers with Ubuntu 12.04, as it keeps logging me out to login screen (getting segfault and xorg crash) . I would like to downgrade the nvidia driver to 290.xx . any idea how I can do that?

2012-04-30T04:36:00.000Z	jk4287	celthunder	yeah. i did try to download the driver from nvidia. but, i have problem to run the driver file. something to do with the dkms i think
2012-04-30T04:36:00.000Z	jk4287	celthunder	is the install straight forward?
