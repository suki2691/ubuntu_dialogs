2009-11-09T20:52:00.000Z	Lint		why Gnome is hardcoded to use Evolution? it's kinda retarded
2009-11-09T20:52:00.000Z	bidossessi	Lint	it's not hardcoded. you can use whatever you want
2009-11-09T20:53:00.000Z	Lint	bidossessi	when I'm trying to remove Evolution, it's going to remove gnome-panel. I think it's something that 'hardceded' means
2009-11-09T20:54:00.000Z	bidossessi	Lint	evolution integrates with the calendar app on the bar. but you can always ignore it and use whatever you choose.
