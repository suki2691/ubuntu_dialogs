2010-11-17T04:42:00.000Z	nemo	Buttons840	never noticed that actually. on a blank document?
2010-11-17T04:43:00.000Z	Buttons840	nemo	well, i was working on a file stored on a remote server (connected using ssh), so that might have something to do with it; but no, not a blank document, an existing document
2010-11-17T04:44:00.000Z	nemo	Buttons840	ah. could be related, sure.
