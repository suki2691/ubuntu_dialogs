2009-12-11T04:36:00.000Z	SJr|nx		Is there any reason why I can't install Ubuntu on a Mac OS X Server machine?
2009-12-11T04:38:00.000Z	syn-ack	SJr|nx	you should be able to, I don't see why not
2009-12-11T05:07:00.000Z	SJr|nx	syn-ack	what about the fact that it doesn't have a BIOS and has that EFI crap
2009-12-11T05:10:00.000Z	syn-ack	SJr|nx	I run a system with EFI just fine
