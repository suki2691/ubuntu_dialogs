2005-08-22T07:16:00.000Z	oxez		hi I'm considering moving back to linux again, and I'll try something else than Gentoo. Is Xorg currently available as a package for ubuntu? I heard it wasn't for Debian
2005-08-22T07:16:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	oxez	it's installed by default with Ubuntu
2005-08-22T07:16:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn		as long as you don't pick a server install.
2005-08-22T07:17:00.000Z	oxez	Concord_Dawn	okay, and do you know if there are enough support for my radeon 9800 (gfx card) and logitech mx510 (mouse)?
