2010-04-25T01:01:00.000Z	An_Ony_Moose		I'm trying to download the RC and am constantly losing my network connection if I don't cap the speed
2010-04-25T01:01:00.000Z	racecar56	An_Ony_Moose	if it's because it's making everything else slow, maybe try putting a download speed limit on the torrent
2010-04-25T01:02:00.000Z	An_Ony_Moose	racecar56	it's not making anything else slow. It just drops the connection after ~15 seconds when I'm not limiting the speed.
