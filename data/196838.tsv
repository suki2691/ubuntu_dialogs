2006-05-14T13:36:00.000Z	funkja		quick question (hopefully) I am trying to set up Apache on my box and I know that ubuntu comes with it installed. I messed up some of the configuration on it so I deleted the apach2 folder in /etc/. Now when I do 'apt-get install apache2' that folder does not come back... what do I need to od?
