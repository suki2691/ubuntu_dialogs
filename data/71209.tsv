2009-05-31T09:46:00.000Z	donavan01		im getting a bunch of errors on a machine I am working on when I try to boot into ubuntu from a usb stil it says something like ata2.01:stat {DRDY} and then a bunch of other junk ... is it safe to assume I have a bad mobo or cpu
2009-05-31T09:46:00.000Z	fryguy	donavan01	are you installing to a hard drive?
2009-05-31T09:48:00.000Z	donavan01	fryguy	just doing the running it from the USB ... I am actually trying to get windows to install on this machine (for a friend who is scared of linux) and it keeps hanging at the during the install but DSL linux boots just fine so I am assuming it some instruction seton the cpu or something on the mobo that cause it to crap out
2009-05-31T09:49:00.000Z	donavan01	fryguy	 ok the text just stopped and now I have a nice black screen
