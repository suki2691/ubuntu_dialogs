2005-03-26T14:51:00.000Z	djp	aracataca	nvu is fine for quick work. i would use it in parallel with something like bluefish or quanta plus. some would even suggest vim.
2005-03-26T14:58:00.000Z	djp	aracataca	there really isn't a dreamweaver out there but nvu is a huge step in the right direction. it is very basic, but it is still in beta and really is coming on rather nicely
2005-03-26T14:59:00.000Z	aracataca	djp	yeah, i had a look already.
