2009-09-01T14:07:00.000Z	negev		is there an easy way to build the ubuntu apache2/php5 packages with debugging symbols so i can use gdb effectively in the event of a segfault?
2009-09-01T14:07:00.000Z	negev		i'm trying to debug php but i just get "(no debugging symbols found)"
2009-09-01T14:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	negev	install the dbg versions of the packages ?
