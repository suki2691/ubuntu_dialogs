2010-12-23T05:57:00.000Z	itaylor57	cafejunkie	I have Intel Corporation Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 18) and have no problems in 10.10, i just don't run compiz
2010-12-23T05:57:00.000Z	cafejunkie		amanda_: have you tried checking for a proprietary driver? Go to your appearance settings, then choose either the second or third desktop effects (normal or extra) and wait for it to check for a driver
2010-12-23T05:58:00.000Z	cafejunkie	itaylor57	Yeah, it works but amanda is trying to get compiz going
