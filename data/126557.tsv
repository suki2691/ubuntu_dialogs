2008-09-10T20:07:00.000Z	[nrx]		I need a life. Can anyone help?
2008-09-10T20:08:00.000Z	[nrx]		XD
2008-09-10T20:09:00.000Z	trakinas	[nrx]	try apt-get install life. i tried with real-love but did not work. =(
2008-09-10T20:13:00.000Z	trakinas	[nrx]	i also tried ./configure --with=getting/head for true love, but did not work either. guess we might find other kind of aproaches... (enough with this joke.)
