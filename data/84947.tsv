2009-08-04T20:32:00.000Z	nibbler_	tomoyuki28jp	what do you mean by "global ip"?
2009-08-04T20:32:00.000Z	tomoyuki28jp	nibbler_	not local ip, but the global one.  one coming to the router.
2009-08-04T20:33:00.000Z	nibbler_	tomoyuki28jp	well, ifthis "global ip" is not configured on the host, but being nat'ed on the router, you shouldcheck a webpage like www.heise.de/ip
