2012-04-29T07:35:00.000Z	benjamindaines	pmp6nl	nah, just muting the spdif output since I don't use it and would rather not have a red beam shooting out of my headphone jack
2012-04-29T07:36:00.000Z	pmp6nl	benjamindaines	ok. Sorry I dont know much about that.  maybe try posting on the forums
2012-04-29T07:39:00.000Z	benjamindaines	pmp6nl	everything works, so I don't think it's an issue with the hda, it just defaults to the spdif output being unmuted.  It does the same thing in windows, but under Mac OS it will automatically turn on only when a spdif cable is inserted
