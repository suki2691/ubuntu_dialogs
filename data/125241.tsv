2010-05-06T16:37:00.000Z	Andy80		I'm trying to convert my Ubuntu 10.04 Desktop to NBR. I did "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-netbook" and it installed all the packages, but how do I switch to the NBR interface? Thanks

2010-05-06T16:38:00.000Z	Andy80	lassegul	isn't available a simple tool that allow me to easily switch between the two interfaces?
2010-05-06T16:39:00.000Z	lassegul	Andy80	probably, but i dont know
