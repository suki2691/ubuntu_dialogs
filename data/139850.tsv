2007-05-05T16:16:00.000Z	FocusRite	sanityx	yeah I think so. In windoze it'll actually keep a damn great archive per RSS folder entry in 'My documents' .. been trying how to find out how to prevent that. It does seem to aggregate feeds into the folder-file though, if you have several going into one RSS folder
2007-05-05T16:16:00.000Z	FocusRite		I assume the other ver's of Tbird would behave in a similar way
