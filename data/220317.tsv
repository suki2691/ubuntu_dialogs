2006-12-21T06:43:00.000Z	Flannel	niskel	the "desktop" CD is the live CD
2006-12-21T06:44:00.000Z	niskel	nickspoon	Flannel: so I can boot it right to the desktop?
2006-12-21T06:44:00.000Z	Flannel	niskel	yep, it boots to the desktop (and even if you wanted to isntall it, you'd have to go through the desktop)
