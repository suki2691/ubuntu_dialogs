2009-01-03T00:28:00.000Z	srx2002		hi guys/gals   quick question...I'm trying to learn a little bit of the command line, I know how to run a program from the terminal eg: vlc....and it pops up and runs fine...but how do I get back to my prompt after the program has been started so I can contnue to do other things?
2009-01-03T00:28:00.000Z	srx2002		anyone?
2009-01-03T00:29:00.000Z	l-isla	srx2002	its ctrl+z to put the program in the background
2009-01-03T00:29:00.000Z	l-isla	srx2002	then type bg to make it continue as a background process
