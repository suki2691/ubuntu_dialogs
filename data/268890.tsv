2005-09-20T12:43:00.000Z	gerger		ok os i asked ewarlier and someone, cant recall who, kept telling me to go to a link they gave... but the link for installing nvidia drivers really doesnt make sense to me
2005-09-20T12:45:00.000Z	gerger		if anyone would bother ot explain the methods for removing the current drivers, i think i can handle the rest... it doesnt quite seem to excplain removal at the faqs
2005-09-20T12:45:00.000Z	bob2	gerger	"current drivers" of what?
