2008-11-16T11:08:00.000Z	ssmy		I'm running my server on 7.10. I am trying to install finch (command-line equivalent of pidgin), but it keeps trying to install X. How can I avoid installing x?
2008-11-16T11:08:00.000Z	fryguy	ssmy	you don't
2008-11-16T11:09:00.000Z	ssmy	fryguy	let's assume I actually want to install finch.
2008-11-16T11:09:00.000Z	fryguy	ssmy	so then you install it, apt-get install finch
