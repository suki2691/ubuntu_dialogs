2010-06-26T06:47:00.000Z	matt____	Dr_Willis	Thanks for the advice, I'll look around for some info on my card.
2010-06-26T06:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	matt____	 tjheres been issues mentioned in here befor using the audio part of HDMI with some nvidia chipsets.  Ive never heard of anyone running hdmi to an 'amp' befor. doing that wiuld be the same as using the analog sound outs id imagine. Unless you got some digital amp. :)
2010-06-26T06:41:00.000Z	matt____	Dr_Willis	- thanks. i'm having trouble getting audio *and* video to the amp. (it's a digital amp.) amp receives no signal from hdmi cable from graphics card from ubuntu machine. nvidia-settings doesn't detect amp (or tv) as a device; am i likely to need to plug hdmi straight into tv to get nvidia to detect the device through hdmi? analog sound/video isn't an option with my graphics card....
2010-06-26T06:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	matt____	 theres known issues with hdmi audio  and nvidia in some cases. So it may be the thing just cant work as an audio out at this time. 10.10 may fix it. or the newer nvidia drivers. I would check the forums for your exact card. Ive never used a hdmi auidio card yet.
