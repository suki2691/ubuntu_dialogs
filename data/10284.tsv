2011-09-02T10:53:00.000Z	urlin2u	chicori	you have the classic desktop, why would you need to remove unity
2011-09-02T10:54:00.000Z	chicori	urlin2u	for one its causing screen to be black in patches.. second I dont like it at all.
2011-09-02T10:55:00.000Z	urlin2u	chicori	personally I wouldn't even if disliked, not sure if safe to do so.
