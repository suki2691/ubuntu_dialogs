2006-08-22T15:21:00.000Z	Minty	baconbacon	I have two as I have just installed 64bit paralel with a 32 bit vesion and two seems untidy
2006-08-22T15:23:00.000Z	baconbacon	Minty	ok but I remind you you wont be able to hibernate one and boot the other (it's minor but useful in my case)
2006-08-22T15:23:00.000Z	Minty	baconbacon	 thanks I never hibernate
