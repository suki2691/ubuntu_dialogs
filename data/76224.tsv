2010-10-23T18:16:00.000Z	G__81		i installed ubuntu 10.10 and then installed the nvidia drivers too but after installing when the system boots i see couple of messages being displayed on screen when the system boots, though everthing is fine but these messages come up on the screen when the Ubuntu 10.10 logo appears hence it breaks the boot up experience. Is this a known bug and is there a solution for it?
2010-10-23T18:17:00.000Z	G__81		can some one help me out ?
