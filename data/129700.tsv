2007-06-27T10:44:00.000Z	mobutu	w116tjb	because then you'd be able to edit any file on your system with your instance of gedit , whch is probably not what you want to do
2007-06-27T10:45:00.000Z	w116tjb	mobutu	Thanks. So gksudo gedit limits it to the current file?
2007-06-27T10:45:00.000Z	mobutu	w116tjb	i don't know.  i would type   'sudo gedit FILENAMEHERE'
