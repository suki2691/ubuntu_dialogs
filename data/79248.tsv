2008-11-15T22:18:00.000Z	nalys		hello, I have the following problem with intrepid: both my /root/.local/share/Trash/files and /home/nalys/.local/share/Trash/files are empty when I open these folders with nautilus. Though Trash (and I can't go to this folder when I run nautilus as root (don't know why)), isn't empty and when I want to empty it it says "read only file system", so I guess I have to change the rights with sudo...
2008-11-15T22:18:00.000Z	nalys		...chmod but I can't get to these files, I don't understand where they are...

2008-11-15T22:21:00.000Z	nalys	ActionParsnip1	Oh wait, problem seems solved... I had forgotten that I had directly deleted these files from an extern device...so I just unplugged it for the first time since, nd now the files are gone....why is that?
