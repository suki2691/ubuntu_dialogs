2007-06-17T13:20:00.000Z	Nvening		hi, i just tried to enable desktop effects (this is what beryl is called now right??) and it says they can be enabled? I'm on ATI using the their own drivers, is that the problem?

2007-06-17T13:21:00.000Z	dannyboy79	Nvening	they split awhile back. Beryl has way more options
2007-06-17T13:22:00.000Z	dannyboy79	Nvening	compiz can be changed around using gnome-compiz-manager and Beryl is still very buggy whereas compiz isn't
