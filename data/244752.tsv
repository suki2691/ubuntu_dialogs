2009-05-29T12:26:00.000Z	BigV		Hey all, I'm currently having an issue with a fresh install of Ubuntu. None of my personalised settings stay when I reboot the PC. In addition, Firefox doesn't keep any history, I can't even use the back button. It's like I dont have write access to whatever part Ubuntu uses to store these sorts of things.
2009-05-29T12:27:00.000Z	BigV		Im using 9.04. I have never had this issue before. :/
2009-05-29T12:27:00.000Z	ubuntu__	BigV	have you actually installed it
2009-05-29T12:29:00.000Z	ubuntu__	BigV	have you gone through the Installer located as a desktop icon which says "Install"
