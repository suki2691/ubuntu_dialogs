2007-06-18T12:57:00.000Z	B-nday		ok my question to someone who has time...i wanna check with md5, my brandnew "feisty" iso just downloaded
2007-06-18T12:57:00.000Z	soundray	B-nday	if you downloaded to your desktop, 'cd ~/Desktop/ ; md5sum filename.iso'
2007-06-18T13:00:00.000Z	B-nday	soundray	the problem is to obtain the md5 code, not launching the md5 command :D
2007-06-18T13:01:00.000Z	soundray	B-nday	the md5sums are available from the download site where you also got the .iso
