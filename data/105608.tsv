2008-05-07T08:24:00.000Z	Prez00	bbyever	should it show up when I run mount?
2008-05-07T08:25:00.000Z	Prez00	bbyever	thanks, I know what swap does, I just don't remember if it should show up in mount, because I had a filesystem problem a while back, after suspend./resume issue, and just want to make sure swap partition is working
