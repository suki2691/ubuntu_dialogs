2006-08-25T06:07:00.000Z	Sembiance		I'm thinking of creating a Linux box to use as a workstation (C/C++ coder) and I'm thinking of using Ubuntu. My first instinct is to actually use Gentoo but it takes so long to compile/do anything, plus the lackluster hardware support, etc.  I really don't want to spend a weekend just getting it up and running.
2006-08-25T06:08:00.000Z	Sembiance		I have a question about Ubuntu though. What package management system does it use?
2006-08-25T06:09:00.000Z	Sembiance		Do I just download Ubuntu 6.06 cd image and burn it?
2006-08-25T06:10:00.000Z	atroWork	Sembiance	yup, it's a live cd with a graphical installer
