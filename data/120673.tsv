2008-05-17T08:42:00.000Z	Cyntek		hmm... just noticed that my "refresh rate" is at 53mhz when it should be at 75mhz.
2008-05-17T08:43:00.000Z	Cyntek		Is there a solution to force change the refresh rate to 75mhz?

2008-05-17T08:47:00.000Z	danbhfive	Cyntek	the listed refreshes are wrong, if you want the highest supported value, then just pick the highest listed value.  I pick 53hz, and I get something like 75hz
