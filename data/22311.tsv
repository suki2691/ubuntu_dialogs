2010-11-25T20:30:00.000Z	SeriousSam		I'm sorry for stupid question, but how can I list all channels?
2010-11-25T20:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	SeriousSam	you probably do not want to do that
2010-11-25T20:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	SeriousSam	too much channels. use "alis" i.e. « /msg alis list *java* »
2010-11-25T20:33:00.000Z	SeriousSam	erUSUL	thanks a lot. I just forgot this command.
