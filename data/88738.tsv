2008-10-13T22:16:00.000Z	r0ach	LordFDisk	What does "read up" mean ? (really I didnt understand)
2008-10-13T22:17:00.000Z	LordFDisk	r0ach	 Read up on the command to see if that is what your looking for
2008-10-13T22:22:00.000Z	LordFDisk	r0ach	 Maybe this link might help you. http://www.bootdisk.com/bootdisk.htm
