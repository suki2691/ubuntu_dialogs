2006-03-28T10:05:00.000Z	zanth		i am trying to get an encrypted remote connection, tunneling vnc is an option I would like to avoid, I wanted to go with freenx but it won't install...apparently it is absent from the repositories and downloading from the site gives errors of nxagent refusing to install
2006-03-28T10:06:00.000Z	zanth		anyone have any suggestions?
2006-03-28T10:07:00.000Z	useruser	zanth	just curious, but why is tunelled vnc bad? I presume you know about ssh port forwarding
2006-03-28T10:09:00.000Z	zanth	useruser	port forwarding could work I suppose, but I am using NAT and sometimes I want to ssh into a different machine that my own
