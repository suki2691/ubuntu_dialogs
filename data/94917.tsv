2008-04-27T09:12:00.000Z	mouseclone	LSG	yes.. might be OpenGL
2008-04-27T09:13:00.000Z	LSG	mouseclone	They worked very smoothly 1 hour ago using Gutsy on this same computer...
2008-04-27T09:15:00.000Z	LSG	mouseclone	Any idea if there's some fix or something? Whenever i open the trash can it takes like 3 seconds to fully open
