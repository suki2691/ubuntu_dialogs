2010-04-14T04:32:00.000Z	Exterminans		Hi, i've got a little problem with a dedicated server that crashed and is not booting any longer (Last message in /var/log/dmesg and messages is HDA Intel 0000:01:05.2: PCI INT B -> GSI 19 (level, low) -> IRQ 19)
2010-04-14T04:33:00.000Z	histo	Exterminans	what happens now when you try to boot?
2010-04-14T04:34:00.000Z	Exterminans	histo	The server becomes pingable, but nothing more. The message is the last one i see when opening the logs from a liveimage
2010-04-14T04:35:00.000Z	Exterminans	histo	Tried 3 times so far, allways only the message with HDA Intel so i guess it causes a freeze
