2009-10-29T17:56:00.000Z	Jan_Fisker		Could not download all repository indexes
2009-10-29T17:56:00.000Z	Jan_Fisker		The repository may no longer be available or could not be contacted because of network problems. If available an older version of the failed index will be used. Otherwise the repository will be ignored. Check your network connection and ensure the repository address in the preferences is correct.
