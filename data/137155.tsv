2007-04-22T13:01:00.000Z	Delco2		anyone know what command line parameters I should try? using Xubuntu live CD. freezes at 'loading essential drivers'. got 256K of RAM
2007-04-22T13:01:00.000Z	Flannel	Delco2	did you check the CD for defects?
2007-04-22T13:02:00.000Z	Delco2	Flannel	I think it that its not recognising my CD Rom drive when it starts to install
2007-04-22T13:04:00.000Z	Delco2	Flannel	do you know the command line parameters for full RAM install (no swap) and noMDA?
