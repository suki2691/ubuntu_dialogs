2010-08-28T07:03:00.000Z	maurer_		I'm getting 25% packet loss on multiple different wireless networks. Any approaches to figure out what's going on with my machine?
2010-08-28T07:04:00.000Z	brandom	maurer_	What wireless card are you using.
2010-08-28T07:05:00.000Z	maurer_	brandom	Full disclosure--using Maverick, but #ubuntu+1 seems dead
2010-08-28T07:06:00.000Z	brandom	maurer_	Oh, okay.. thought you might have the same problem as me! My AR9285 drops packets like crazy.
