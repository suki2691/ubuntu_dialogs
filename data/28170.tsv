2010-07-30T06:33:00.000Z	Underscore		When dual-booting with Windows, can I read and write outside of the Ubuntu install partition? E.g. can I access and save files from my Windows partition (as well as documents) or will I have to make copies into my Ubuntu home directory?

2010-07-30T06:35:00.000Z	Underscore	Flare183	No, that's not what I meant - I mean, say I have big files in my Windows partition; I don't want to have to copy them over to Ubuntu, but I want to make a change from within Ubuntu. Can I access the file, make the change, and hit save, saving the file where I found it (in the Windows partition)?
