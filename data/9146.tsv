2011-10-10T04:34:00.000Z	comitt		i see, thanks. ill look up anyway how to set up the partitioning correctly, "just in case"
2011-10-10T04:34:00.000Z	comitt		one more thing. i have ubuntu on something like the 4th partition of the drive. i boot up with grub2 and have windows xp on the first partition. if i delete the ubuntu partition, will this mess up the boot in any way? thanks
