2008-04-15T22:48:00.000Z	kabads		I have inserted live cd in to new laptop and X doesn't start - how do I initiate the install process from command line?
2008-04-15T22:49:00.000Z	kabads		or do I want to start X by changing the config?
2008-04-15T22:51:00.000Z	kabads		in fact, how do I go about starting X.org? Is it through /etc/init.d/x11-common?
