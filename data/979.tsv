2012-11-16T12:57:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	mhr	with a text editor. I believe nano can handle html fine.
2012-11-16T13:03:00.000Z	mhr	DaemonicApathy	nano or vi is displaying the html code not the actual file
2012-11-16T13:04:00.000Z	DaemonicApathy	mhr	Sorry about that, I completely forgot about lynx - the web browser for CLI. I don't usually use terminals for PDFs/HTML.
