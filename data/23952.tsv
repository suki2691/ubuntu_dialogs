2010-10-16T14:41:00.000Z	Gnea		Okay, this is driving me up the wall: I've been trying, for weeks, to get Ubuntu desktop to install on a new computer I built: micro-itx with a dual-core P4, 4G ram, geforce 9300, onboard sound/ethernet/wifi - everytime it boots using the usb stick I made of Ubuntu Desktop 10.04.1 from usb-creator, the screen blanks on bootup, no matter what options I change. why and how can I fix this?

2010-10-16T14:41:00.000Z	Gnea	sparky74	you don't understand, I can't get anything to display, at all
2010-10-16T14:44:00.000Z	Gnea	sparky74	that's basically what I figured I'd have to do, it's just annoying that Ubuntu claims to support all of this new hardware when, in fact, it fails so hard at it
