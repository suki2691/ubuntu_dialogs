2010-04-10T07:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	enjoytheday	 the normal package manager and package manager commands update the os as needed
2010-04-10T07:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	enjoytheday	 no idea what you mean by 'patch update'  -> a simple 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get upgrade' updates  the whole system.
2010-04-10T07:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	enjoytheday	 the gui package manager tools also handle this functionality
