2007-01-15T08:36:00.000Z	agent	linux_user400354	read wiki.beryl-project.org and forums.beryl-project.org (see faq section in forums) - if that does not solve it, ask again but be more specific (what video card you use and what driver)
2007-01-15T08:37:00.000Z	agent	linux_user400354	and try #beryl
2007-01-15T08:37:00.000Z	linux_user400354	agent	i see nothing in that faq about no borders
