2006-12-11T12:39:00.000Z	kmaynard	faLUCE	you using GDM?
2006-12-11T12:39:00.000Z	kmaynard	faLUCE	does KDM have a way to change your session?
2006-12-11T12:40:00.000Z	kmaynard	faLUCE	in gdm, i can change to, say, ice or xfce, and it'll ask me if i wanna make that the default. i don't know how kdm works tho
