2009-03-04T05:26:00.000Z	nickrud_	wolter_	if they're enabled, /var/crash or the dir the app was running in
2009-03-04T05:27:00.000Z	wolter_	nickrud_	well, there is nothing at /var/crash , does that mean my system didn't kernel panic?
2009-03-04T05:28:00.000Z	nickrud_	wolter_	not sure where that would end up except there. Not even sure if the ubuntu kernel has kernel panic logging enabled by default
