2005-11-30T07:13:00.000Z	j813		I can't eject my CD/ DVD, I have to eject it thru the Desktop. Is this normal?
2005-11-30T07:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	j813	 you mean 'eject' as in hit the button and it pops out?
2005-11-30T07:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	j813	 the desktop/gnome has accesed it and has it 'locked' - its normal
2005-11-30T07:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	j813	 thats not a "DM" login screen. They are using one of the many "desklet" type tools for the weather report.
