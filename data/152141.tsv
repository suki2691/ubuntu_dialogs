2008-06-26T20:39:00.000Z	xtknight	rosros-3	what do you mean exactly for low resolution/
2008-06-26T20:40:00.000Z	xtknight	rosros-3	like a low resolution for a package-browsing interface, or finding packages that are suitable for low res screns?
2008-06-26T20:41:00.000Z	xtknight	rosros-3	technically most should work alright with 800x600 but this doesnt always pan out.  is there a particular one youre having problems with?  or do you just want a new simpler interface for everything?
