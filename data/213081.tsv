2006-05-03T15:59:00.000Z	gnomefreak	netgeek60	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2006-05-04T16:00:00.000Z	gnomefreak	netgeek60	you can use dist-upgrade the difference between upgrade and dist-upgrade is dist-upgrade will grap kernel updates along with everything else apt-get upgrade doesnt get kernels and some other stuff
