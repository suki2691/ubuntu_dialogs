2009-05-01T13:16:00.000Z	Sega		I'm trying to set up Ubuntu server 6.06 on a Sun Fire V100 with RAID1, and the partioner does not give me the option to choose "physical volume for RAID." What am I doing wrong?
2009-05-01T13:16:00.000Z	reid	Sega	what you are doing wrong, is 6.06
2009-05-01T13:17:00.000Z	reid	Sega	try 8.04 at the very least =P
2009-05-01T13:19:00.000Z	Sega	reid	8.04 does not work with SPARC as far as I can tell.
