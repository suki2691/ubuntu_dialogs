2006-07-11T09:04:00.000Z	uncmar		Has anyone reported having problems with the kernel of the Ubuntu LAMP install of v6.06 ?
2006-07-11T09:05:00.000Z	uncmar		I did a fresh install and the computer reboots directly after the boot command is executed.
2006-07-11T09:06:00.000Z	uncmar		no more messages occur. I simply reboots and goes the the process again.
