2010-08-09T08:09:00.000Z	abuayyoub		Hi. can someone help me please. I am running Ubuntu 10.04 on a Sony Viao laptop and for some reason I cannot adjust the brigntness when on battery which means my battery dies really quickly. I usually FN F5 & F6 dim and brighten the screen but I can't seem to find any way. Also in the power settings I have the option to set the brightness for when the computer is plugged in but the option is not there for battery power.
2010-08-09T08:09:00.000Z	ComputerWiz	abuayyoub	which Viao model specifically do you have?
2010-08-09T08:10:00.000Z	abuayyoub	ComputerWiz	 It's a Viao NW something I think
2010-08-09T08:14:00.000Z	ComputerWiz	abuayyoub	I think it might be an ATI driver issue.  There's not too many solutions I can find, but maybe some in this thread will help? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1466208  Also, you didn't give me a full model number, so that link is more of a guess.
