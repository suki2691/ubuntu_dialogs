Any time you play with partitions, it's possible for something to go disastrously wrong, so you need to make backups before you start messing around with them, ok?
2010-04-15T22:09:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	Losha	ok... I've been wanting to know how to make a ghost image
2010-04-15T22:09:00.000Z	millertimek1a2m3	Losha	- can you tell me how?
2010-04-15T22:11:00.000Z	Losha	millertimek1a2m3	good time to learn then. I've never used it myself, google for 'ghost for linux'. Note that there are many other choices too, e.g. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem
