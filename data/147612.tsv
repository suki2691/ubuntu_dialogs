2009-01-12T20:03:00.000Z	Slart_	IdleOne	I always end up removing it and adding it back again
2009-01-12T20:04:00.000Z	Slart_	IdleOne	mm.. it does that for me sometimes too.. never found a way to fix it, other than removing it and putting it back
2009-01-12T20:05:00.000Z	Slart_	IdleOne	you're welcome
