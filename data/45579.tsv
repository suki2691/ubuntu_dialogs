2009-10-24T21:43:00.000Z	aperson	lord_of_computi1	is there a specific error you're looking for?
2009-10-24T21:43:00.000Z	lord_of_computi1	aperson	yes. it says Reason 37
2009-10-24T21:45:00.000Z	lord_of_computi1	aperson	 this was the exact line in daemon log <info>  (ttyUSB0): deactivating device (reason: 37).
