2010-04-10T06:26:00.000Z	dancallo		Hello. Can someone answer a question for me?
2010-04-10T06:27:00.000Z	dancallo		After installing UNR-9.10 on my netbook, I can't seem to get UbuntuOne to connect. I'm on the net so that's not the issue.
2010-04-10T06:28:00.000Z	dancallo		When I right click on UbuntuOne and pick Connect, nothing happens
