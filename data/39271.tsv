2010-04-25T15:13:00.000Z	reves		Can somebody please explain to me why I can't access my ubuntu 10.04 box remotely via VNC. my remote desktop settings keep telling me i can only access this box locally. i have forwarded 5900 port on my router to it's IP. I have disabled UFW. i have tried tightvncserver. nothing i do allows me remote access to this box.
