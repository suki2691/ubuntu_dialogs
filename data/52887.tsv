2009-07-10T23:01:00.000Z	aboyz		 I know i can execute ipconfig to find out my IP. Is there a way to do it when i ssh into the box it will says my IP is xxx.xxx.xxx . Kinda like /etc/motd when you login it show the motd. How do I output what IP is on the box everytime? the reason I'm doing this because it is using DHCP. thanks..
