2008-01-28T06:21:00.000Z	viator		any idea how to fix that
2008-01-28T06:22:00.000Z	soundray	viator	go through /boot/grub/menu.lst and delete "splash" wherever you find it.
2008-01-28T06:25:00.000Z	soundray	viator	it should only say "quiet" (although you could delete that as well to see more boot messages)
