2006-11-11T11:11:00.000Z	dks_matt		hey there, I'm having massive problems with my sound setup since changing cards, could anyone tell me if there's a way to completely reinstall all of the sound systems?  Alsamixer is telling me my card doesn't exist, when the card is present in the device mixer and sound settings dialogue.  I installed the new card to play with jack etc. and do recording so it's very important to me I get everything working if anyone could help

2006-11-11T11:12:00.000Z	dks_matt		is there a sound channel?
