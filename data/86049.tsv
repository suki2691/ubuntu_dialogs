2008-07-09T10:44:00.000Z	bulazeem		i'm about to go back to windows.  nothing on the forums seems to work and envy doesn't seem to do anything either :(  anyone else struggle with hardy and nvidia drivers?
2008-07-09T10:44:00.000Z	XanghiF01	bulazeem	what are you trying to do?
2008-07-09T10:45:00.000Z	bulazeem	XanghiF01	the other day my computer messed up and for some reason the graphics drivers stopped working.  i reinstalled them in synaptic package manager and nothing worked.  then i got envyng and used that to unistall the drivers and then install the newest ones.  it still didn't do anything
2008-07-09T10:46:00.000Z	bulazeem	XanghiF01	 could it be because at one point in time i downloaded drivers from the nvidia site and installed them manually?
