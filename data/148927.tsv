2008-08-22T17:44:00.000Z	Narev		Hello, I am a brand new Ubuntu user. I just downloaded the iso and I have a blank CD in my hand.
2008-08-22T17:44:00.000Z	Narev		I wanted to look for live help to be completely sure of what I am doing
2008-08-22T17:45:00.000Z	Narev		How do I make the iso image into a usable CD?
