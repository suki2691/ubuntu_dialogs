2010-03-07T07:57:00.000Z	joshnetbook		Hello. I'm having trouble installing Ubuntu on my desktop.
2010-03-07T07:59:00.000Z	joshnetbook		I've setup a thumb drive to be bootable and mounted the ubuntu iso to it. I can reboot and get to the Ubuntu installation menu but after choosing to install(or just run) it drops me to busybox.

2010-03-07T08:03:00.000Z	_GRUB_	joshnetbook	most likely that when you copied the ubuntu iso to the drive it left files out. just format it and try putting the iso on again
