2011-05-29T00:32:00.000Z	Furry	BorgTK2001	there's an option called "Mic", but it's turned all the way down
2011-05-29T00:35:00.000Z	Furry	BorgTK2001	there's one labelled "Internal Mic" as well, should I try it as well?
2011-05-29T00:36:00.000Z	Furry	BorgTK2001	though, the last time I used Ubuntu I did end up using a USB mic
2011-05-29T00:41:00.000Z	Furry	BorgTK2001	that worked :) thanks
