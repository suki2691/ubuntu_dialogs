2009-03-10T22:23:00.000Z	amgarching		My firefox strikes. After not a very clean shutdown.  The back-nutton still is always disabled and there are no prompts in address bar. Firefox has no memory anymore! How to fix?
2009-03-10T22:24:00.000Z	Incarus	amgarching	"sudo killall -s KILL firefox" and retry
2009-03-10T22:25:00.000Z	amgarching	Incarus	ps aux | grep firefox is empty
