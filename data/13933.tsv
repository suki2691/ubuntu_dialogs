2011-05-25T08:36:00.000Z	geeksmith	Fritz750	can you be more specific?  Ubuntu has firewall, intrusion detection, and several other network security systems.  What are you trying to accomplish?  (Don't worry, your english seems just fine)
2011-05-25T08:41:00.000Z	geeksmith	Fritz750	you can use anonymizer systems like anonet to tunnel traffic and essentially hide it. If you're trying to secure your computer from attacks, then iptables is the first stop, as qin indicated.
