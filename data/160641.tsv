2007-03-03T08:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U		Can I just install LILO with the Alternate CD but not install the system ( recovering unbootable system ) ?
2007-03-03T08:32:00.000Z	transgress_	Jordan_U	you can ... or you can use a livecd and chroot into the real environment
2007-03-03T08:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	transgress_	Doesn't work, I was hoping that the liveCD would have some extra stuff for intel macs ( it does in fact ) that would make a lilo install work from the install CD
2007-03-03T08:35:00.000Z	transgress_	Jordan_U	i've done it.  it will work.  you can follow the steps in the gentoo handbook as that is how you install gentoo...
