2009-11-06T01:13:00.000Z	thinkle79		I have to get my hard drive replaced tomorrow. I'd like to back up my current set up as identically as possible (two partitions -- /home/ and /) and then restore it. This is on a laptop with no CD drive available... what tools would you recommend?

2009-11-06T01:16:00.000Z	thinkle79	sweed	I presume I'd have to push the copy across the network to another ubuntu box? What do I have to do on the other ubuntu box to get it ready for that?
2009-11-06T01:17:00.000Z	sweed	thinkle79	you could also use norton ghost and set up a ghost server on ubuntu
