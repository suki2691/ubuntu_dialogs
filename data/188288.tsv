2006-06-01T09:20:00.000Z	Beforewisdom		I tried apt-get update and got about as many unfound urls
2006-06-01T09:20:00.000Z	Beforewisdom		is there a place to get a clean sources.list?
2006-06-01T09:21:00.000Z	Beforewisdom		Isn't it wrong to run apt-get dist upgrade if apt-get update isn't successful?
