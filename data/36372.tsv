2010-05-27T18:01:00.000Z	wangzirui		Hi. When I run "sudo apt-get update," I get "E: Could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable) E: Unable to lock the list directory." What can I do?
2010-05-27T18:01:00.000Z	DarkSector	wangzirui	need to close update manager
2010-05-27T18:02:00.000Z	DarkSector	wangzirui	or anyother package manager
