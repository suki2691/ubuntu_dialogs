2010-12-26T05:03:00.000Z	xeer		when I go to open a folder from the gnome panel, mplayer is opened and que's all the files in that folder. where is the setting to change this behavior? gconf??
2010-12-26T05:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xeer	 so the default applicationm for a 'folder' is now mplayer you mean to say?
2010-12-26T05:03:00.000Z	xeer	Dr_Willis	yes, it's quite annoying.
2010-12-26T05:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xeer	 i know its setaable via the 'ubuntu-tweak' tools features. but not sure of any othe rway. theres a 'open folder' item you can set to be the default.  but i dont think you can riht clcik on a folder and change it that way
