2011-10-15T04:06:00.000Z	Aleo		how I can change resolution by editing the x11 xorg.conf, I can not find this file
2011-10-15T04:06:00.000Z	Polah	Aleo	It doesn't exist by default, Xorg is configured automatically. You can make it at /etc/X11/xorg.conf and configure X in there however you like.
2011-10-15T04:07:00.000Z	Aleo	Polah	I want that because by the graphical interface don't let me change to more than 1024x768, I am on a virtual box
