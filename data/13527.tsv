2011-06-07T11:15:00.000Z	blvnfsm		hello. i'm having a problem mounting a hard drive. i'm working on a friend's computer and trying to recover his data. i boot ubuntu live from a disk and go into the command line. i try 'sudo fdisk -l' and nothing happens. i tried sfdisk as well and still nothing. when i try 'sudo cfdisk -P r' it says "FATAL ERROR: Cannot open disk drive." any idea what the problem is?
