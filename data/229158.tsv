2006-04-18T16:00:00.000Z	uber_spaced		I used apt-get install mythtv and it failed.
2006-04-18T16:01:00.000Z	uber_spaced		I compiled mysql 5.0 on my machine, and mythtv asked for the root account password to mysql so it could create some databases
2006-04-18T16:01:00.000Z	uber_spaced		so I fired up my mysql server and gave the password to mythtv, but the shit still doesnt work
2006-04-18T16:02:00.000Z	mwe	uber_spaced	why did you compile it yourself though?
