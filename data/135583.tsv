2008-01-24T01:19:00.000Z	_LoneCrow		I just installed ubuntu server 6.06 and now it's finished, the login comes up, but no keyboards will work no matter what!  I picked the default keyboard layout and actually did the install..
2008-01-24T01:20:00.000Z	_LoneCrow		I can run the install utility keyboard works fine.. as soon as you get to login no keyboard
2008-01-24T01:20:00.000Z	bardyr	_LoneCrow	have you tried a newer version?, 6.06 seems broken on a lot of new servers lately
2008-01-24T01:21:00.000Z	bardyr	_LoneCrow	its the last (and first) long time support version, the latest is 7.10
