2006-01-10T16:28:00.000Z	LaserJock		I have Breezy and Dapper installed and grub is using the Breezy menu.1st, how would I get it to use the Dapper one instead?

2006-01-10T16:31:00.000Z	LaserJock	Falstius	yeah, I just thought that grub-install would do the trick
2006-01-10T16:32:00.000Z	Falstius	LaserJock	I've never had much luch with grub-install.
