2012-01-13T01:20:00.000Z	amt0101		Hello, I have a box with ubuntu 11.10 32 bit...I updated..and now I want to put adobe flash on the machine. When I try to install it from Software center I get: There isn't a software package called "adobe-flashplugin" in your current software sources.
2012-01-13T01:21:00.000Z	amt0101		What do I do in this case?
2012-01-13T01:21:00.000Z	epod	amt0101	I believe it's called 'flashplugin-nonfree' and you need universe enabled?
