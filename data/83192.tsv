2009-02-09T10:12:00.000Z	ryanprior	brandon_	Pretty much any. Emerald is officially dead now - it's been dropped by the Compiz team.
2009-02-09T10:13:00.000Z	ryanprior	brandon_	The new hotness is Jasper I believe, but I don't think it is ready for prime time yet. I suggest using Metacity with compositing enabled, personally.
