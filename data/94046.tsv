2008-06-12T09:45:00.000Z	adamorjames		I am trying to mount a SanDisk flash drive. The problem is it will not mount. I was following steps to get DSL to run on it through Linux and now I am at this problem. Here is the guide I was following: http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/wiki/index.php/Installing_to_a_USB_Flash_Drive . It worked before.
