2011-02-23T11:12:00.000Z	drt84233		Hello, I want all dns lookups for the domain name A to resolve to the ip of domain name B , how do I do this?
2011-02-23T11:13:00.000Z	drt84233		teh actual issue is I have a really long dyndns.org hostname, I want to be able to type something shorter,
2011-02-23T11:14:00.000Z	th0r	drt84233	/etc/hosts maybe?
2011-02-23T11:15:00.000Z	drt84233	th0r	the ip is dynamic though, thats why im using dyndns
