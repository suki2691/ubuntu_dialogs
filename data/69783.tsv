2009-04-10T05:24:00.000Z	rogue780	LakesProse	I am currently running a server with a sata drive and a desktop with two sata drives and a pata drive all on linux..no problems here
2009-04-10T05:25:00.000Z	LakesProse	rogue780	well I was thinking about sata drives connected *through* a PCI card to the motherboard
2009-04-10T05:26:00.000Z	rogue780	LakesProse	as long as the sata controller on the card is supported by linux...i'd assume it would be since that's at the hardware/bios level
