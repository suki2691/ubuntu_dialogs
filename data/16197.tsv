2012-01-27T15:04:00.000Z	prashant_123456		is vim editor and vi editor different ??
2012-01-27T15:04:00.000Z	buhman	prashant_123456	yes
2012-01-27T15:05:00.000Z	buhman	prashant_123456	some distributions actually symlink vi to vim by the way; which makes things confusing
2012-01-27T15:05:00.000Z	buhman	prashant_123456	your question is ambiguous
