2009-05-20T10:09:00.000Z	genii	ultratek	Did you try to install the 64bit firefox package from ubuntu that I directed you to earlier?
2009-05-20T10:12:00.000Z	genii	ultratek	No, the 64 bit version directly from Ubuntu is here: http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/f/firefox-3.0/firefox-3.0_3.0.10+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.04.1_amd64.deb      Note the "amd64" part in the name which designates 64bit
2009-05-20T10:12:00.000Z	genii	ultratek	If you download that file, you can install it with: sudo dpkg -i firefox-3.0_3.0.10+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.04.1_amd64.deb
