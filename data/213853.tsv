2008-05-18T09:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	PPKuma	same way you installed it.
2008-05-18T09:29:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	PPKuma	erm, why are you compiling things?  (what is it?)
2008-05-18T09:30:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	PPKuma	ah, well in that case that would be one thing to try.  The "in Linux" way is to use package management, not compile manually on individual systems, so the answer to your question as asked doesn't really apply to the particular instance.
