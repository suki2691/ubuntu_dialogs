2011-07-16T22:18:00.000Z	quiescens	pdtpatr1ck	i don't seem to have any trouble tab completing with "cat /et<tab>"
2011-07-16T22:20:00.000Z	pdtpatr1ck	quiescens	when u do cat /etc there shouldn't be a space after /etc .. it should get to the end and give u options like /etc tab should show all the listings below so this way i can type the next letter and it would tab complete over.
2011-07-16T22:22:00.000Z	quiescens	pdtpatr1ck	i'm not having any issue with it, if i type "cat /et<tab><tab>", it gives me "cat /etc/" "Display all x possibilities?"
