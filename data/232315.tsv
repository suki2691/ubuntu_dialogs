2008-01-14T02:30:00.000Z	flyingfree		quick query
2008-01-14T02:31:00.000Z	flyingfree		I just pulled my ATI AIW 128 PRo from my machine to go back to the built Trident Cyberblade Graphics card when I rebooted the machine xorg had a problem and didn't autodetect the old/new card.  How do I get xorg to do an autodetect from the command prompt that follows the error screen
