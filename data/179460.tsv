2007-09-03T06:24:00.000Z	jrib	Dalik	do you want them to not be mounted or just not to be displayed on the desktop for those users?
2007-09-03T06:25:00.000Z	Dalik	Tomcat_	 not be mounted for normal users, so if possible not mounted for normal users unless they are in the sudo file for example.
2007-09-03T06:26:00.000Z	jrib	Dalik	just don't give them permission on the drive then
