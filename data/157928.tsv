2007-05-13T06:00:00.000Z	Slart	dogshed	well.. it's not working =).. pulseadudio process hogs the mic and hangs.. can't use aoss until I kill it (9).. 2 of the config utils don't work because of some pa_new returning sometihng strange
2007-05-13T06:00:00.000Z	Slart	dogshed	it's just a mess
2007-05-13T06:04:00.000Z	Slart	dogshed	ah.. sorry about that.. nope.. it's the soundserver
