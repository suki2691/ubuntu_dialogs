2009-02-17T13:49:00.000Z	HDready		good morning folks :) I want to sort my mp3s so that i have the following path: artist/artist-album-year/trackno-artist-title; which program is good for this? and also i want to edit the mp3 tags so that they call trackno-artist-title like the one in the path view; is there a program which can lookup my mp3s in some common databases? maybe EasyTag oder exfalso?
