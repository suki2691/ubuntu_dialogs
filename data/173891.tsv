2006-07-23T10:47:00.000Z	Callahad		I'd like to export my home across campus. I'll mainly be using macs, but will want to access it from a PC on occasion. How can I decide between netatalk/samba, nfs/samba, or just samba? I've only briefly worked with nfs, and such sharing still seems to be a bit of black magic to me.
2006-07-23T10:48:00.000Z	omac	Callahad	try not using netatalk and samba.  try ssh, scp...you connect and get the files and you are in and out.
2006-07-23T10:49:00.000Z	Callahad	omac	That's what I've been doing, however, I'd like to be able to let Vim and other local tools run amok in my remote home.
2006-07-23T10:52:00.000Z	Callahad	omac	That's something I hadn't thought about. I'll look into it! Thanks!
