2007-03-15T09:12:00.000Z	cyclops		hmm, hopefully someone can help me here. i am a fedora user but one of my friends online had been raving to me about the goodness of ubuntu so i thought i would give it a try. so far only thing i can find is a 700 meg live cd. isn't there a dvd that has more packages etc with it? or do i need to install them using apt?

2007-03-15T09:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cyclops	 at this time everything has had so many updates.. its proberly better to stick with the cd and isntall what you need from the net.
2007-03-15T09:14:00.000Z	cyclops	Dr_willis	aah okay. i'll just use the live cd then. figure i would check out ubuntu. been a die hard RH man since RH5 but haven't really LOOKED at any other distros in 5+ years
