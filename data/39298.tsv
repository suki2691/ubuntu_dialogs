2010-01-10T15:12:00.000Z	nick125		Hey. Anyone here having issues installing linux-backports-modules-2.6.31-18-generic? linux-backports-modules-wireless-karmic-generic depends on it
2010-01-10T15:13:00.000Z	nick125		I'm getting an error saying that linux-backport-modules-2.6.31-18-generic is a virtual package and when I try to install linux-backport-modules-2.6.31-18-generic, it says that there are no candidates.

2010-01-10T15:15:00.000Z	nick125	ouyes	Just updated, but it's possible that the mirror hasn't updated yet.
