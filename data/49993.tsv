2009-11-23T22:23:00.000Z	TheCheeze	musicmaniac	why would you want to do that?
2009-11-23T22:24:00.000Z	TheCheeze	musicmaniac	i thought for sure there was a firefox plugin to mimic IE on those sites...
2009-11-23T22:26:00.000Z	TheCheeze	musicmaniac	ah, then I am not sure. I know wine has a pseudo IE browser, but i seem to fail at making it work for anything
