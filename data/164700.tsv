2008-02-09T06:58:00.000Z	badkitty	LjL	I dunno thats what I remember reading somewhere
2008-02-09T06:59:00.000Z	LjL	badkitty	ak5_: those magic numbers mostly make no sense. with today's amount of memory, what really matters is the ability to hibernate (AND to have some swap available, swap is not useless at all, just making it as big as the RAM itself will normally be more than fine)
2008-02-09T07:00:00.000Z	badkitty	LjL	I certainly see your point
