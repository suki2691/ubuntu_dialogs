2012-07-27T01:18:00.000Z	bwalker8981		does anyone know if upgrading ubuntu from 10.04 to 12.04 is a pretty safe process?
2012-07-27T01:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bwalker8981	 totally depends on a lot of things. I belive the official advice would be wait for 12.04.1 to come out.
2012-07-27T01:21:00.000Z	bwalker8981	Dr_willis	have you ever upgraded ubuntu before? does it keep all of your programs in place usually?
2012-07-27T01:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bwalker8981	 I always do clean reinstalls..
