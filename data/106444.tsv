2008-12-11T22:03:00.000Z	danielbw		hi. I have the latest catalyst drivers, 8.12 installed on a fresh install of ubuntu 8.10 for amd64.  I bought two ATI FireGL V3600's so I can stretch one big desktop across four monitors.  I am only able to setup two big desktops: one per gpu, but with two screens each.
2008-12-11T22:03:00.000Z	danielbw		There is no way to join all four screens to one big desktop.  How can I set it up so that i can have one big desktop across all four monitors without enabing xinerama? I can provide any info you need through pastebin. I really need help getting this to work.
2008-12-11T22:03:00.000Z	danielbw		Please msg me if you can help and I am not here.
