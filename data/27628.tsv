2010-08-12T08:50:00.000Z	bofh80	ZEKnox	NX nomachine.com and freenx server (there is free server from nomachine but it has concurrent usage limitations) it's 'enhanced' X forwarding / XDMCP . it might suit your needs

2010-08-12T08:53:00.000Z	bofh80	ZEKnox	pop on freenx from the repos' and install the client from nomachine on your end .   oh freenx removed from repo's ? i swear it was there before
