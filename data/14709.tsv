2011-05-04T00:06:00.000Z	Defusal_	tapoxi	gnome 3 is already out ;)
2011-05-04T00:07:00.000Z	tapoxi	Defusal_	Ahh, I haven't upgraded to 11.04. So if I want to go to gnome 3 instead of unity, I can just install gnome-shell?
2011-05-04T00:08:00.000Z	Defusal_	tapoxi	im not sure, but i dont think the gnome3 package will be called gnome-shell now that its stable
