2007-04-04T06:01:00.000Z	stormy|	Comrade-Sergei	 I am assuming that you have an nVidia graphics card?
2007-04-04T06:02:00.000Z	stormy|	Comrade-Sergei	 It sounds like a driver issue, but I dont know anything about that... all I can say is take a look at xorg.conf.... if you dont know how from command line... it's "sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
