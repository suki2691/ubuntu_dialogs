2008-01-15T07:09:00.000Z	erawfish	zamfir	unplug old, plug in new, run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver and restart X
2008-01-15T07:13:00.000Z	zamfir	erawfish	Do you know why a monitor on the list wouldn't be recognized by Ubuntu, or when it is set under Screens & Graphics, it resets to Unknown on restart?
2008-01-15T07:23:00.000Z	zamfir	erawfish	you told me to run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver then restart x, right?
