2011-09-12T22:11:00.000Z	serard		I want to install a paravirtualizer on my local machine. Which one of xen and kvm should I use ? I need one main desktop env for development + some VMs for testing. Need near-raw performances
2011-09-12T22:12:00.000Z	serard		testing VMs will be server machines (ubuntu, debian, gentoo)
