2009-04-25T17:44:00.000Z	ackbahr		Hi! I made the mistake of formatting / as ext4 when I installed Jaunty yesterday, so now I'm stuck because Clonzilla can't read ext4, so I can't backup my system. Does someone know if I can copy everything in / , reformat in ext3 then put everything back in place? If so, how can I make sur permissions and ownerships won't be messed up?
