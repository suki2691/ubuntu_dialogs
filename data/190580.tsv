2011-09-16T11:34:00.000Z	Pathos		Hello. I am looking for a ubuntu distribution for EEEPC. It must be lightweight and not too taxing on resources.
2011-09-16T11:36:00.000Z	ohzie	Pathos	the ubuntu netbook remix is going to be the one that is best supported.
2011-09-16T11:36:00.000Z	ohzie	Pathos	I've heard Easypeasy is easier on resources but I can't really support that opinion.
2011-09-16T11:37:00.000Z	ohzie	Pathos	Easypeasy or lubuntu then, IMO. I prefer Easypeasy's interface, though.
