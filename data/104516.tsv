2011-03-09T09:42:00.000Z	drtt		I plugged in my external usb sata hd, and it says it found new hardware and is ready to be used... but I cannot seem to find where to open it in "my computer" or anything
2011-03-09T09:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drtt	is that in windows?
2011-03-09T09:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drtt	windows is too native and cannot read or write ext4 or ext3. with software it can read ext2
2011-03-09T09:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drtt	if you want to format it then its a windows support issue and you will get help in ##windows
