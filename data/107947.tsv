2008-01-01T12:28:00.000Z	ackbahr		hello! I'd like my sound volume to reset to "mute" on startup (or shutdown, whatever).How should I do this?

2008-01-01T12:30:00.000Z	norv	ackbahr	so just mute it and logout cleanly, making sure you are saving sessions
2008-01-01T12:31:00.000Z	ackbahr	norv	Yep, but the point is precisely that I usually forget to do this...
