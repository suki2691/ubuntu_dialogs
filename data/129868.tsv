2007-06-23T06:47:00.000Z	dissection		I'm using Ubuntu 7.04 (kernel 2.6.20-15-generic). I need to edit /etc/wvdial.conf but its read-only. What do I need to do?
2007-06-23T06:48:00.000Z	tck	dissection	chmod u+w /etc/wvdial.conf
2007-06-23T06:49:00.000Z	dissection	tck	thanks. And after I finish editing it, do I need to type anything else?
2007-06-23T06:51:00.000Z	tck	dissection	save it i guess
