(cause I used cat the other day and now when I play the resulting mp3, the player stops after the first mp3 that I used in the join (I still have access to the original mp3s if nothing can be done with that one ))

2008-08-13T05:55:00.000Z	xzcvczx	delfick	cat wont work due to the structure of an mp3 file
