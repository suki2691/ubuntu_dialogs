2007-08-21T11:06:00.000Z	mosno		i'm a little confused by the behaviour of NetworkManager and /etc/network/interfaces (Feisty). It seems that the only way to get NetworkManager to manage an interface is add the 'iface wlan0 inet dhcp' line to interfaces(5) and reboot. If the line's not there, the wlan0 isn't managed. Am I on crack or is this just a bad coincidence?
