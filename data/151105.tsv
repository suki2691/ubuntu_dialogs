2007-03-07T11:32:00.000Z	justthisguy	jano_	if you run the `top` command in a terminal, it'll show you a list of what's currently running, and will order it by what's using the most cpu time.
2007-03-07T11:33:00.000Z	jano_	justthisguy	I know 'top' I was thinking more of some app that would allow me to change/disable running services...
2007-03-07T11:35:00.000Z	justthisguy	jano_	oh, ok. As far as I know the best way to change the running services, etc is by modifying the scripts in /etc/rc*.d . Apart from that, can't help, sorry
