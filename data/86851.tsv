2009-04-24T00:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	uni4dfx	you can do something to Ext3 to get partial  Ext4 suppourt, you need to clean install and set up proper Ext4 partitions yourself, for the full experience
2009-04-24T00:57:00.000Z	uni4dfx	sebsebseb	yeah i thought so
2009-04-24T00:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	uni4dfx	also apparnatly Ext4 well  the file system  I guess is alright, but Ubuntu's kernel needs some changes for it really
