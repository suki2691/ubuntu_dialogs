2009-09-15T03:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	zaggynl	infact you could first try 8.10 to see if things are alright there
2009-09-15T03:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	zaggynl	,but   apparantly for these ATI issues 8.10  probably going to be like 9.04,  with 8.04 being fine
2009-09-15T03:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	zaggynl	messaged wrong one hmm
