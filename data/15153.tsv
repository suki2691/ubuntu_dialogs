2011-04-25T11:02:00.000Z	shoeless		Can anyone guide me through submitting a bug report requesting the version of a package to be upgraded?
2011-04-25T11:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	shoeless	Is there a specific bug / problem fixed by the newer version? Do you want this to be done in a release before 11.10 ?
