2007-08-16T12:33:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	muszek	@ a terminal: which <command>
2007-08-16T12:33:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond		replace <command> with your program in question
2007-08-16T12:34:00.000Z	muszek	hyperactivecrond	I "don't know" the "command".  All I have is an opened window.  For example Alt+F2 opens a "run command" window and I want to know it's name or path.
