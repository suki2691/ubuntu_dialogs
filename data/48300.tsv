2012-06-25T01:46:00.000Z	newbeggar		hello, anyone active who wants to help? I'm using a macbook pro to install ubuntu onto a USB HDD. I've gotten the ISO file onto the external HDD, but neither "install" or "try before installing" gets beyond a black screen/white blinking line.
2012-06-25T01:47:00.000Z	newbeggar		thanks, i tried there and my specific question wasn't answered. Thus I am here.
2012-06-25T01:48:00.000Z	newbeggar		I've gotten as far as being prompted to either try it out or install it, and then it just dies on me.
