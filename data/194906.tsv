2006-03-20T09:02:00.000Z	Zanth		good day, how difficult is it to "upgrade" to dapper?
2006-03-20T09:02:00.000Z	r0bin	Zanth	as difficult to replace your apt/sources.list
2006-03-20T09:02:00.000Z	r0bin	Zanth	basically search/replace breezy with dapper
2006-03-20T09:03:00.000Z	r0bin	Zanth	that's what I did, and I'm running dapper =)
