2006-07-14T05:56:00.000Z	liran1		no apt-cache search is for packages. im talking about searching for a file within all packages
2006-07-14T05:56:00.000Z	liran1		its a dpkg command, i just cant remember the syntax
2006-07-14T05:56:00.000Z	jrib	liran1	dpkg -S, but that only searches installed packages.  Use apt-file or packages.ubuntu.com if you want to search uninstalled packages too
