2005-03-20T15:31:00.000Z	schweeb	CarlK	what kind of PC is this, and what BIOS does it have?
2005-03-20T15:38:00.000Z	schweeb	CarlK	there's nothing in Storage>Device Configuration or Boot Order... or in the Advanced menu?
2005-03-20T15:50:00.000Z	CarlK	schweeb	- I cou;nt really see a bios name - closest was "compaq computer config setup screen" or something
