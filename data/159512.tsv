2007-06-23T08:19:00.000Z	waterpie		a program is crashing, and I don't know why. Running from console doesn't say anything useful. How can I run it so that I see at which lib call it crashes?

2007-06-23T08:23:00.000Z	waterpie	kitche	it doesn't say anything on the console. just that it crashed. running strace, it says process detached, and so i can't see anything that happens later
