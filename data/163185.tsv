2007-04-21T15:58:00.000Z	dmhouse		Hey there. I'm upgrading to 7.04. I had assumed I was on the latest-but-one version, but it turned out that Dapper (which I currently have) was succeeded by Edgy. I missed that entire release cycle. In the future, where can I find out about Ubuntu releases? Is there a mailing list?

2007-04-21T15:59:00.000Z	dmhouse	bgrupe	Huffalump: sure, but Edgy was 4 months after Dapper.
2007-04-21T16:00:00.000Z	bgrupe	dmhouse	yeah dapper was delayed
