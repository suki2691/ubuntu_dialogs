2006-09-24T07:17:00.000Z	Smegzor		I need to run a terminal with root privilleges.  How do I achieve that in ubuntu?
2006-09-24T07:18:00.000Z	Smegzor		thanks
2006-09-24T07:19:00.000Z	Smegzor		the reason I asked is I ran Bastille and now I can't access my shared folder from my Windows network.  I'm pretty certain the problem is in my iptables (I'm guessing)
