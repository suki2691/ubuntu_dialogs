2010-08-31T20:41:00.000Z	SixThreeOh		ah ha, what ever happened to ctrl+alt+backspace?
2010-08-31T20:43:00.000Z	VCoolio	SixThreeOh	it's a xorg thing, ctrl-alt-backspace was removed; it's alt+sysrq+k now
2010-08-31T20:45:00.000Z	VCoolio	SixThreeOh	you can restart e17 without killing X, but that's an exception I guess
