2010-08-19T02:03:00.000Z	pZombie		Hey!
2010-08-19T02:04:00.000Z	pZombie		I am looking to install ubuntu 10.4 SERVER NOT client on a computer without a cdrom drive. Is there a way to put the iso or the extracted iso on a USB stick/drive which is bootable and install it from there with grub4dos or similar?
2010-08-19T02:05:00.000Z	pZombie		i am getting to the point where it starts the installation using grub4dos, but then complains about missing the cdrom
