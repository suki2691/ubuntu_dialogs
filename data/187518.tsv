2010-10-24T02:29:00.000Z	Condorito		Hi everyone. (?) please about forwarding ports on ubuntu for "Transmission" torrent. Not too sure what I am supposed to do. Have Belkin_N_Wireless router. Am I making any sense?
2010-10-24T02:31:00.000Z	Condorito		Know any links where I might get some education from on this subject, please?
