2008-05-26T05:53:00.000Z	sevard		Does anyone use Firebug 1.2 w/Firefox 3.0rc1 on linux?  I'm asking before I ask because I'm doubtful anyone does.
2008-05-26T05:53:00.000Z	sevard		 I've tried to get "open with text editor" on firefox 3.0rc1 working with bluefish, my text editor.   it just won't launch
2008-05-26T05:53:00.000Z	hi	sevard	i thought firebug doesn't work with firefox 3 yet?
2008-05-26T05:54:00.000Z	sevard	hi	I'm using FireBug 1.2, which is working with Firefox 3.0rc1
