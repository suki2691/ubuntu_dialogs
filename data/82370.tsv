2008-08-14T01:41:00.000Z	wnstn		When attempting dual boot install, hangs at " Resizing Partition, Please Wait 0%)  sat there for about 20-30 minutes like that. I could still move the windows, mouse etc. Cancelled install, quit out. Windows unaffected. Any ideas? It was a Fiesty Live CD on Dell with VIsta on a 320 GB drive. Set ubuntu partition to 90gb. Help?
