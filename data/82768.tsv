2010-01-04T16:32:00.000Z	beruic		Can anyone help me? I have a huge problem with load cycling, and I don't know which script files to edit for changing the options. Also I'm not surre whether I should edit hdparm options, or other. Running Karmic.

2010-01-04T16:37:00.000Z	beruic	guntbert	load cycling is the hard drive parking the reading head and resuming again. It's not good when it does it too often. In Intrepid I changed some scripts that was executed when entering battery state, but don't remember which.
