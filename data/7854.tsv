2011-12-22T01:49:00.000Z	quup		hi, upgrading from ubuntu 10.10 to whichever is currently stable, I have no monitor so I really can't have anything go wrong, what's the best way to do this?

2011-12-22T01:51:00.000Z	quup	sskalnik	any install disc that starts up ssh and lets me configure through there without need for monitor?
2011-12-22T01:53:00.000Z	sskalnik	quup	 Good question.
