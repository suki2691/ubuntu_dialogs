2012-02-08T22:14:00.000Z	Snyperx|work		Hello all.  I am hoping someone can help me or at least provide some information.  Is it possible to setup Ubuntu with 5 monitors?
2012-02-08T22:14:00.000Z	Snyperx|work		My workstation uses 5 monitors and it would be fantastic to get off of Windows 7 and move to Ubuntu.
2012-02-08T22:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis1	Snyperx|work	 should be possible. if you got the video cards with the outputs. but ive had issues when using 3+
2012-02-08T22:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis1	Snyperx|work	 my issue was differnt video cards were needing didffernt drivers. with    identical cards. it should be easier.
