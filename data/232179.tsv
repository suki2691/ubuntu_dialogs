2007-02-25T16:01:00.000Z	TylerIsGreen23		i have an intel pro wireless 3945 card but ubuntu recognizes it as IPW 2200. I am trying to set my card to monitor mode so I can use Kismet but i can't find any instructions for doing that on an ipw 3945. i did however find instructions on how to do it with an IPW 2200. My question is will it make my wireless card stop working to install the incorect drivers even though ubuntu already sees it as the incorrect card
