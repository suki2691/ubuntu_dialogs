2009-01-08T18:48:00.000Z	CarlFK		what is kacpid, and how can I keep it from loading if I don't want it ?  (it is using 85% cpu)
2009-01-08T18:49:00.000Z	gogereaver	CarlFK	that looks like a known issue
2009-01-08T18:49:00.000Z	gogereaver	CarlFK	it seems the only fix is to disable acpi
2009-01-08T18:50:00.000Z	CarlFK	gogereaver	thanks
