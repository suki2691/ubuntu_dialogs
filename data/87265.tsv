2008-06-20T07:41:00.000Z	dmsuperman	tdaharsh	tried running "sudo apt-get update" and making sure it's not your internet?
2008-06-20T07:42:00.000Z	dmsuperman		I have a nvidia 7900 GS KO video card. I have downloaded several different versions of the driver, all of which have (at some point in time) worked, so it's not that they're incompatible. Whenever I reboot, I have low settings mode. Stopping X, reinstalling the driver (even the same one I already have downloaded), and starting X again makes the whole thing run smoothly. Once I reboot again, however, I must run through this process
2008-06-20T07:42:00.000Z	tdaharsh	dmsuperman	all of my other internet services are working fine.
