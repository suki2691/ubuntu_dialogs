2011-05-27T00:33:00.000Z	nikitis		Hey guys, i accidentally overwrote Alsa/pulseaudio by installing ossv4.  Can someone tell me how to reinstall alsa/pulseaudio?
2011-05-27T00:35:00.000Z	xangua	nikitis	reinstall ubuntu-resktop metapackage
2011-05-27T00:37:00.000Z	nikitis	xangua	how do I go about doing that?
2011-05-27T00:39:00.000Z	nikitis	xangua	i installed ossv4 cause WINE needed it to compile.  But i had no idea it would overwrite alsa/pulseaudio
