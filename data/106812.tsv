2009-01-25T14:05:00.000Z	StR|Sangreal		as i installed kubuntu on defaults, my graphics started flittering and the performance was really bad; i was offered to install a proprietary driver, the performance did improve dramatically; however, any attempt to play video crashes vlc and other players play it badly(i mean 60% of frames are black, it flickers on the top of the desktop and plasma)
2009-01-25T14:05:00.000Z	StR|Sangreal		 (i have centrino2, thus i installed amd64 distro, my videocard is ati radeon mobility x1450) please could sb advise me how to set up my graphics?
