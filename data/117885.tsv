2007-10-03T14:45:00.000Z	Pelo	crispy-afk	I suggest you look up the device in the forum and in here  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport
2007-10-03T14:46:00.000Z	crispy-afk	Pelo	will check it, but really doubt its listed there ;)
2007-10-03T14:48:00.000Z	Pelo	crispy-afk	 if your device is supported in any linux distro you can make it work in ubuntu ,  but you might have to do some work
