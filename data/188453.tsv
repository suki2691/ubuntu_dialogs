2006-07-16T15:17:00.000Z	rendo		How do I recursively change a folders owner?  I tried using nautilus but it only does a single file/folder at a time, not everything in the folder.
2006-07-16T15:17:00.000Z	bakert	rendo	chmod -R from a terminal
2006-07-16T15:18:00.000Z	bakert	rendo	oops yes chown
2006-07-16T15:20:00.000Z	bakert	rendo	chown not chmod to change owners -- sorry for causing the confusion
