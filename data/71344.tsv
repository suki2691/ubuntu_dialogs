2008-12-16T13:44:00.000Z	jim_p	mosahin	do you mean set an existing os in an existing partition to work in vbox?
2008-12-16T13:45:00.000Z	mosahin	jim_p	no. I'm trying to access the files in my secondary partition using PuppyLinux live cd iso.
2008-12-16T13:46:00.000Z	jim_p	mosahin	what does vbox have to do with it? does the partition mount ?
