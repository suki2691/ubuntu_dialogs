2007-02-18T12:58:00.000Z	tovella		I set up a computer (for my 7yr old Godson) using Ubuntu and some educational software.  His older brothers use the same computer, and usually forget to logout after looking at adult material.  Does anyone have any ideas about a way to implement an "auto-logout" feature for x-sessions?
