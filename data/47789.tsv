2012-01-12T22:38:00.000Z	sfsf32		lxde, gtk, ecc...
2012-01-12T22:39:00.000Z	theadmin	sfsf32	Those are commonly known. Nobody wants to say "GIMP Toolkit" or "Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment"
2012-01-12T22:43:00.000Z	theadmin	sfsf32	Yeah, used to stand for "Oll Korrekt", from broken English. But once again, this is offtopic, please do NOT talk about subjects not related to Ubuntu support issues here.
