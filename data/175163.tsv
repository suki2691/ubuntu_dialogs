2006-11-05T10:37:00.000Z	Languid		hi ive been having problems with my ubuntu dapper install and corrupt filesystems.  my root ext3 has become corrupted for seemingly unknown reasons, and ive had to boot into a livecd and fsck it.  does anyone know some common reasons that might have caused the corruption?
