2009-06-12T22:37:00.000Z	Hajuu		Hi guys, I am trying to run an application and capture any and all console output generated. I have tried just piping it to a file, and i've tried running it in a shell and piping the output of the shell instance, but neither way has been able to capture any and all command output.. Anyone got any ideas how I can capture everything into a file?
