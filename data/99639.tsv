2008-11-05T13:03:00.000Z	Rolypoly		ok, the guides ive followed for 8.04 all tell me to get bluez, and it wont let me install that on 8.10
2008-11-05T13:03:00.000Z	Rolypoly		i think theres a new bluetooth library and bluez still wants the old one
2008-11-05T13:04:00.000Z	jim_p	Rolypoly	does the bluetooth service woek now?
