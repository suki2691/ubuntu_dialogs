2010-10-17T20:11:00.000Z	cannonball		Good morning all.  Update Manager on my Ubuntu 9.10 laptop only shows that I can upgrade to 10.04.1 LTS, it doesn't show 10.10 as an option.   I do have the "Normal Releases" selected for "Show new distribution releases" option in Upgrade Manager.
2010-10-17T20:11:00.000Z	cannonball		Will it not let me skip two release levels like that, or is there something else going on?

2010-10-17T20:12:00.000Z	cannonball	yapsol	ok, thanks.
