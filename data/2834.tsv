2012-05-27T13:40:00.000Z	planetic		Hi! I trying to install the ATI proprietary driver to ubuntu 12.10 32bit and people on the web said that it is impossible to do with 3.2.x linux kernel. How to downgrade to 3.0.0 kernel without downgrading whole system&
2012-05-27T13:42:00.000Z	IronSight	planetic	I would say... install an older version of ubuntu....
2012-05-27T13:42:00.000Z	IronSight		if that was the only way to make that driver work
2012-05-27T13:43:00.000Z	planetic	IronSight	and there is no way to do downgrade only the kernel?
