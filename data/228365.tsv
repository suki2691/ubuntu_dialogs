2006-06-02T16:40:00.000Z	The_Vox	dsas	who should have told me about it? didn't get the bot's msg :)
2006-06-02T16:41:00.000Z	dsas	The_Vox	sorry, there wasn't actually a factoid, I think it does worth without a chroot though.
2006-06-02T16:42:00.000Z	The_Vox	dsas	I know breezy doesn't (it was my first choice when I bought the box...until I realized I had to chroot stuff for it to run)...which is why I wanna find out if dapper does...guess I'm gonna have to head to the forums and ask :)
