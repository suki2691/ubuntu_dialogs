2010-11-11T21:32:00.000Z	Doug_S		I installed Ubuntu 10.10 recently, now I cannot log in. Unable to log in on main screen, or recovery mode. Any ideas?

2010-11-11T21:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Doug_S	then run:   passwd foo    replace foo with YOUR username, then run: reboot    you can now login as yourself
