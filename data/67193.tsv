2009-06-15T13:59:00.000Z	simplexio	zagabar	no idea if that was last working driver for you
2009-06-15T14:01:00.000Z	zagabar	simplexio	The vesa driver didn't work. :/ I have already tried it. What is there more to try? I have an ATI Radeon mobility X600, and when trying to boot, my screen gets stuck on a multi coloured distorted ubuntu logo. This happens just before the login prompt is to be shown. Before that, I can see the ubuntu logo load.
