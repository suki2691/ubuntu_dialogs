2012-04-13T10:49:00.000Z	gimbal		hi all, so I'm getting back into ubuntu after a bit of a hiatus in toying around with windoz. Right now, I'm trying to build a package from source, using dbuild. I'm familiar with this process, and the concept of build-depends. My question centers around that there's a script I know used to be available for downloading build-deps by parsind debian/control - I just can't remember the name of it...
2012-04-13T10:51:00.000Z	bobo37773	gimbal	get-build-deps?
2012-04-13T10:52:00.000Z	gimbal	bobo37773	I found something like that in a haskell related package. As I recall, the script I remember wasn't packaged specific to haskell
2012-04-13T10:54:00.000Z	bobo37773	gimbal	Yeah I am not sure. I usually either builkd the dependencies for packages before hand or let my package manager handle it.
