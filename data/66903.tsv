2009-02-10T00:30:00.000Z	^hashbang^	Ego86	it's very likely that the drivers won't work with the live cd because the card is newer the the livecd kernel being used.
2009-02-10T00:32:00.000Z	Ego86	^hashbang^	then how can i install it?
2009-02-10T00:33:00.000Z	^hashbang^	Ego86	hmm, good question, never needed it so I don't know.
