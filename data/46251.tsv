2011-08-01T23:45:00.000Z	lloowen		Hello all. I've just borked up my ubuntu :( I know I could fix it with a live cd but I only have access to a windows 7 OS that won't let me install any programs such as a dvd burner that that could burn an iso imae. Any ideas how I could get my ubuntu working again?
