2007-10-27T04:14:00.000Z	theTrav		why does gibbon keep prompting me for the install disk?
2007-10-27T04:14:00.000Z	theTrav		can't it get what it wants from the interpipes?
2007-10-27T04:15:00.000Z	enyc	theTrav	well it can... but if its got cd listed it will use it if that has the newest file
2007-10-27T04:15:00.000Z	enyc	theTrav	you can change the sources.list and comment out the cd entry...  or use "synaptic" and un-tick it
