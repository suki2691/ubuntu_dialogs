But when it turns off the power light flashes and I cant turn it back on. I have to cut the power and wait a few seconds. It started happening when the boot process was done but before the login screen. If I leave my monitor off during the boot up it doesn't happen. But if I watch a video or play...

2009-01-03T00:45:00.000Z	wigren	saler_	I guess. The light flashes like it's in standby, but it wont come back up. I have to pull the cord from the wall and wait till the light stops flashing.
