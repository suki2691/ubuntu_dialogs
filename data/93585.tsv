2008-04-25T05:53:00.000Z	jedimasterk		 I am having trouble using the live cd iso. When I boot I get (initramfs) blinking cursor. Tried to burns from two different mirrors. No luck. Should I try an upgrade from alternate cd instead.

2008-04-25T05:53:00.000Z	binarybandit	jedimasterk	net upgrade?
2008-04-25T05:53:00.000Z	binarybandit	jedimasterk	well, if it verified, it should be ok
