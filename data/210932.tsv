2005-10-29T08:44:00.000Z	Orborde	vnpaven	No. Sudo runs stuff as root. If you're at a root terminal, you're already running as root.

2005-10-29T08:55:00.000Z	Orborde	vnpaven	Running as a user with admin powers is better, because then you only "power up" to root for specific tasks, so it's less likely that errant software will fraggle your whole system.
