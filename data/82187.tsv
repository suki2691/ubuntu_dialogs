2008-08-15T23:20:00.000Z	jcdwrrc		I'm running Ubuntu Hardy and would like to install MYSQL 4.x using apt-get or the package manager, but have no idea where the repository is...a little help here?
2008-08-15T23:20:00.000Z	Gnea	jcdwrrc	hardy has 5.x, it's compatible.
2008-08-15T23:21:00.000Z	jcdwrrc	Gnea	and Kaushal - I was hoping to leverage dependency analysis in apt-get.
2008-08-15T23:22:00.000Z	Gnea	jcdwrrc	what's wrong with 5.x?
