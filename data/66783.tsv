2009-02-07T09:40:00.000Z	p1_	lokieee	something like "tar cvf outfile *.c"
2009-02-07T09:41:00.000Z	lokieee	ice_cream	is it just like: tar cvf panda.tar panda/  if panda was my directory
2009-02-07T09:41:00.000Z	p1_	lokieee	 the "c" is for create, the "v" for verbose, the "f" to spec ur destination file.
