2008-01-27T03:29:00.000Z	tdru		hi my sound is not working .. how do i fix it?
2008-01-27T03:29:00.000Z	tdru		lol ... it doesnt recognize my sound card i think .. just has a big red circle over it not working
2008-01-27T03:30:00.000Z	PriceChild	tdru	big read circle physically? or in a specific application?
2008-01-27T03:33:00.000Z	PriceChild	tdru	to start things off, pastebin the output of the "lspci" command in a terminal. I am not a sound expert, but hopefully someone can help.
