Then when I rebooted the next day I could not even get into the log in screen. The system frooze. Probably because I had a very slow comp and breezy was too heavy so I asked if I can install it lite
2005-10-24T07:01:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie2		yeah xubuntu. Somebody said download xubuntu. THen others said you can't download xubuntu I'm a bit confused
2005-10-24T07:03:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie2		what distro ? cause I tried BeatrIX (debian and ubuntu based too) it works fine on a alive CD setting but I could not install it properly on the hard drive, maybe still needs som e work in there
