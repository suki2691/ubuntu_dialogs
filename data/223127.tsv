2005-09-05T15:40:00.000Z	LasseL	BSG75	azureus does that in windows too, try to fiddle with the number of connections settings and set limits on up/download
2005-09-05T15:41:00.000Z	LasseL	BSG75	for me it turned out that my cheap 3com router is the bottleneck .. only handles 250 connections
2005-09-05T15:41:00.000Z	BSG75	LasseL	thanks that's what I am trying to do.  oh I have a Dlink 624 may be that's it
