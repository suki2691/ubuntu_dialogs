2010-08-13T23:01:00.000Z	distant2		is there a software for defragmenting the disk?
2010-08-13T23:03:00.000Z	distant2		but why does ext not need defrag? even after say 5 years use?
2010-08-13T23:05:00.000Z	distant2		so what about the file system. which is the default on ubuntu and which is the best to use? i'm on a core2duo w/ 2gb ram.
