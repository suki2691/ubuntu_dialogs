2005-10-13T11:50:00.000Z	RexKwonDo		Idiot question:  I still see the blue Kubuntu startup image even though I have successfully switched back to the chocolately goodness of Ubuntu.  How do I bring back the brown??
2005-10-13T11:50:00.000Z	RexKwonDo		this is from boot
2005-10-13T11:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RexKwonDo	 i disabled the whole thing. :P it looked ugly
2005-10-13T12:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	RexKwonDo	 of course I just edit the grub menu items to NOT give that ugly splash screen any way :P
