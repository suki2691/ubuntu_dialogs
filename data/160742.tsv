2007-05-29T05:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	M_Fatih	Taking something already encoded in a lossy codec ( MP3 ) and re encoding it ( more loss ) is going to give pretty poor results, let alone re-encoding at a lower bitrate
2007-05-29T05:58:00.000Z	M_Fatih	Jordan_U	but i'm not ripping, i have mp3 files only
2007-05-29T05:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	M_Fatih	I know, that is why I am saying you will likely get bad results
