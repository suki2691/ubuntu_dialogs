2005-05-13T16:29:00.000Z	Burgundavia	cyberix	it is secure by default
2005-05-13T16:29:00.000Z	Burgundavia	cyberix	and ctrl-alt-del can be spoofed
2005-05-13T16:33:00.000Z	cyberix	Burgundavia	If I login and run a gdm-loginscreen look-a-like keylogger. How is Ubuntu secure, when another user types in his password in it?
