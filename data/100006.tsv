2009-01-19T21:44:00.000Z	n8tuser	lieuwe	-> reboot the livecd again,
2009-01-19T21:46:00.000Z	n8tuser	lieuwe	-> you may have had a bad burn cdrom,  verify it first if you get to choose from the menu
2009-01-19T21:48:00.000Z	n8tuser	lieuwe	-> perhaps you really do have a bad burn, during burning - isnt there like a md5sum check to see if the iso is okay?
