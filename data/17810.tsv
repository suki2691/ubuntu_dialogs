2011-02-23T01:40:00.000Z	Perceptron		hey guys, I have instaleed Ubuntu Linux 10.10 Maverick Meerkar (server) with apache, and have set it up to run fastcgi with php. I have followed following tutorialhttp://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-set-up-apache2-with-mod_fcgid-and-php5-on-ubuntu-8.10 and it works but when i put the phpinfo.php in /var/www/ when i go url.com/phpinfo.php it downloads the file instead of running the php file...
2011-02-23T01:40:00.000Z	Perceptron		...anyone have any ideas? the stuff i found on web and forums didnt help
