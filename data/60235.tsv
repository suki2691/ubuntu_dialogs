2009-04-24T07:50:00.000Z	PlasmaSheep		Hello all.
2009-04-24T07:51:00.000Z	PlasmaSheep		I'm having an upgrade issue (some sources.list lines are 404's)
2009-04-24T07:52:00.000Z	Killeroid	PlasmaSheep	if those lines are to third party repos, just disable them(comment them out). if they are ubuntu repos, be patient, the servers are swamped
2009-04-24T07:52:00.000Z	PlasmaSheep	Killeroid	They are official ones. I suspected that that was the problem. At least I got the new version (I think).
