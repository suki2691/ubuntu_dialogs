2011-03-20T16:08:00.000Z	ceno3x		Hey, does anyone know if utouch has been ported to 10.04?
2011-03-20T16:08:00.000Z	Paddy_NI	ceno3x	I am yet to see that
2011-03-20T16:08:00.000Z	Paddy_NI	ceno3x	perhaps a ppa might have it.. but nothing official afaik
2011-03-20T16:09:00.000Z	ceno3x	Paddy_NI	bah, I don't want to upgrade to maverick just because of a library... but thx for the input : -)
