2007-10-31T05:06:00.000Z	no0n		I set up a shared folder on my box and am trying to access it from my mac I have sitting next to me on the same network, but when i try to connect to it with finder I get name or password incorrect
2007-10-31T05:06:00.000Z	Caram	no0n	what does this have to do with ubuntu?
2007-10-31T05:07:00.000Z	Caram		Is ubuntu involved at all?
2007-10-31T05:07:00.000Z	no0n	Caram	ok, so if i was on another ubuntu box how would i see the folder?
