2008-10-15T00:00:00.000Z	vexe		i got a question about dual booting ubuntu and vista?
2008-10-15T00:01:00.000Z	scientes	vexe	you really just instal ubuntu AFTER vista and it all should work without doing much
2008-10-15T00:07:00.000Z	scientes	vexe	install vmware then
2008-10-15T00:15:00.000Z	scientes	vexe	you can do that through the xp install most likely
