2008-10-19T23:19:00.000Z	Dalem50	SpinachHead	Sure, what do you mean by that? You can buy the CD using ShipIt, or do you mean putting the CD in and installing Ubuntu? That works too.
2008-10-19T23:20:00.000Z	Dalem50	SpinachHead	Yeah, and internet isn't required to install Ubuntu if you already have the CD..
