2012-10-04T15:06:00.000Z	crazydip	ThinkT510	thanks for the info, but i'm talking about LVM on an existing system - not a fresh install - very little info via google (few wiki's, but little opinions)
2012-10-04T15:07:00.000Z	crazydip	ThinkT510	I know it's theoretically possible, just like it's possible to dist-upgrade debian -> ubuntu (which I have successfully done 5 years ago) - but it does not mean it's easy and you can just follow a wiki :)
2012-10-04T15:08:00.000Z	ThinkT510	crazydip	unfortunately i've never used lvm so i can't help you
2012-10-04T15:08:00.000Z	crazydip	ThinkT510	aye, thanks!
