2010-08-29T06:58:00.000Z	DigitalDeviant		I am currently running ubuntu server 10.4 as a lamp server. It is behind a firewall, but i am looking for something software wise that will allow me to configure any attempts to access the SSH port or ftp port and ban the ip address after a few attempts. Is there one out there that can do that for me?

2010-08-29T06:59:00.000Z	DigitalDeviant		pretty easy to setup as well?
