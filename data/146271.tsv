2009-05-16T18:02:00.000Z	tzanger		good morning... I've updated my xorg driver and mesa stuff from the repository xorg-edgers and I finally have something stable and working... now how do I "lock" the packages, because those packages seem to be updated every day and I do not want to keep upgrading
2009-05-16T18:04:00.000Z	th0r	tzanger	you can disable automatic updates in System-Admin
2009-05-16T18:05:00.000Z	tzanger	th0r	I don't want to disable ALL automatic updates, just any from the xorg-edgers repo
2009-05-16T18:05:00.000Z	th0r	tzanger	then why not remove that repo from the sources list?
