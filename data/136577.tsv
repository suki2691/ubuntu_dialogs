2007-12-21T22:02:00.000Z	[locke]		replaced mobo and proc after burn out.  processor went from 2gHz to 3 gHz.  Conky still reads CPU info at 2gHz.  Do I have to reconfigure something for faster processor to be recognized?
2007-12-21T22:03:00.000Z	neverblue	[locke]	do you see the CPU speed at boot ?
2007-12-21T22:04:00.000Z	neverblue	[locke]	then maybe its the app 'conky' thats incorrect
2007-12-21T22:04:00.000Z	neverblue	[locke]	try other sources to confirm your CPU speeds
