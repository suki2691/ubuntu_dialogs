2006-10-24T16:11:00.000Z	timhaughton		How do I update the environment variables from the command line. Tried env-update - must be a Gentoo thing.
2006-10-24T16:11:00.000Z	timhaughton		I guess I want it to reload /etc/profile
2006-10-24T16:12:00.000Z	thoreauputic	timhaughton	  source /etc/profile ?
2006-10-24T16:13:00.000Z	timhaughton	thoreauputic	That did it - thanks
