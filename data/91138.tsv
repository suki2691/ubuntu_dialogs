2010-09-13T05:07:00.000Z	Izinucs	trakinas	Zyklon has a remote server (friends and commercial) with ubuntu server running .. he's using putty from win7 to ssh into it and sudo doesn't work because ssh server on the server isn't setup right to allow that.
2010-09-13T05:07:00.000Z	trakinas	Izinucs	I guess! so issue a ticket to them.
