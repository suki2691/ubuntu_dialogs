2009-06-25T22:48:00.000Z	JoelR		hi.. i have hardy and i would want to upgrade to jaunty, when i try to do aptitude dist-upgrade it says it is going to delete some packages like gnome-volume-manager, python, ubuntu-desktop, etc.. i think that if i do i will break all my system. What can i do?
2009-06-25T22:49:00.000Z	jrib	JoelR	that command does not upgrade between releases
2009-06-25T22:49:00.000Z	JoelR	jrib	wtf? of course it does, at least in debian.
2009-06-25T22:49:00.000Z	jrib	JoelR	that isn't the supported upgrade procedure, see ubottu
