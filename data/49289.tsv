2011-10-30T19:07:00.000Z	MochaLatte		I'm trying to reinstall 11.04 over my 11.10 setup. I've got a pen drive with 11.04. However, when I boot from this pen drive, it takes me to the GRUB I typically see when I boot normally (albeit with a different color). I do not know where to go from there... Any suggestions?
