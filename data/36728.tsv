2010-03-05T06:14:00.000Z	jdeloach	shane_	I have a radeon 9200! Can't get it working though :( Trying to use standard ATI drivers though.
2010-03-05T06:15:00.000Z	jdeloach	shane_	I am messing with getting it as a second graphics card. Not really there yet to that sort of stuff. Still trying to get it working at the same time.
