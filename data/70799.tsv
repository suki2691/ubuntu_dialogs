2009-01-08T10:31:00.000Z	ScottG489	raylu	yea someone else suggested that. I got ssh on this computer, but how to I use that to transfer files to the vm?
2009-01-08T10:31:00.000Z	raylu	ScottG489	not ssh, sshd. install openssh-server and connect to it from the vm
2009-01-08T10:48:00.000Z	ScottG489	raylu	ill try that
