2008-02-13T00:56:00.000Z	mzanfardino	Guerra	sounds like a strong opinion, yes, but a bit thin on facts.  nm though, if it's a personal preference issue, stick with it.
2008-02-13T00:56:00.000Z	Guerra	mzanfardino	It's fact that ATI drivers suck. It's fact that on the high end, Nvidia is better. The only thing ATI cards are good for is for watching HD movies on WINDOWS.
