2008-10-24T12:24:00.000Z	ziroday	JackWinter	and I use vsftpd :)
2008-10-24T12:26:00.000Z	JackWinter	ziroday	it's not so much that i want the best :), but since it's not really a fulltime server i'm considering something in userspace.  i'll have a look at vsftpd in any case.  just hoped that some people had been through the sorting process and could saave me some time :)
2008-10-24T12:26:00.000Z	ziroday	JackWinter	I understand completely where you are coming from :)
