2012-07-16T12:21:00.000Z	zap0		i started a win32 exe that uses wine.    how do kill-process on it?    i can't even find it in the task manager

2012-07-16T12:22:00.000Z	ikonia	zap0	you shouldn't see a process for the actual executable
2012-07-16T12:22:00.000Z	ikonia	zap0	think of wine as a wrapper, you don't see what it's wrapping
