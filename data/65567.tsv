2010-09-09T02:26:00.000Z	dixond	moronic_moron	there used to be a preferences thing for that, but it vanished a few releases back.
2010-09-09T02:26:00.000Z	dixond	moronic_moron	I know :(
2010-09-09T02:27:00.000Z	dixond	moronic_moron	probably 'by hand' replacing the files in the right place, but I don't know where...
