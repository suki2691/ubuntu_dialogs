2011-05-24T17:07:00.000Z	NyberMi1		Hello, im trying to completely remove mysql-server from my box to try and trigger the fresh install dialogue where i can set up passwords and users again
2011-05-24T17:08:00.000Z	quiescens	NyberMi1	you can most likely sudo dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server-(whatever version it is)
2011-05-24T17:10:00.000Z	NyberMi1	quiescens	that did the trick, i wish i could give you a hug right now. Been losing hairs here :p
2011-05-24T17:22:00.000Z	NyberMi1	quiescens	thanks man :)
