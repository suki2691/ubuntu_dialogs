2007-05-20T15:53:00.000Z	claesson92		My sound won't work! It works just fine in windows, and it worked when i used Ubuntu before. I reinstalled Ubuntu, and now i wont get any sound. What might be wrong? (I know i asked this before, but i has scrollback lines at 300, sp i don't know what you guys answered.)
