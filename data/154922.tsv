2007-01-04T12:20:00.000Z	tiede		hello. I have a problem. I wanted conky to load automatically on startup, so I added it to the sessions tab. It does make conky start, and I can see it for about a second or so, but when Nautilus draws the desktop, conky gets 'hidden' under it, and I have to restart it agin to see it. How do I solve this issue? I thought of passing the command sleep 10 && conky in gnome- sessions-manager, but it doesn't seem to work... Is this even allowed ther
