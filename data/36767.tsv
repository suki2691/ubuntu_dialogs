2010-02-27T16:38:00.000Z	TSK		Greetings.  I have a question about memory usage.  If I had 4 gig when I installed and had to remove 2 gig of it later due to memory gone bad, leaving me with only 2 gig now, could/would that affect (in a negative way) how efficiently my system uses the 2 gig of memory I have left?

2010-02-27T16:42:00.000Z	soicon	TSK	do you run Virtual machine ?
