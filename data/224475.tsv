2007-07-22T15:43:00.000Z	velko	Toma-	i don't think this is possible. at least i never heard of such tool
2007-07-22T15:44:00.000Z	Toma-	velko	i know its possible, its just a matter of getting the root process to start X as a different user, i presume
2007-07-22T15:47:00.000Z	velko	Toma-	they switched to upstart. i don't know which config file it uses
