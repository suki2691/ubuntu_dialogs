2007-09-07T15:07:00.000Z	firekool		gnurph96 have you looked into VNC
2007-09-07T15:07:00.000Z	gnurph69	firekool	 yes, but VNC only allows me to remote control if X is already running on the system I want to control.
2007-09-07T15:09:00.000Z	gnurph69	firekool	 no - X is installed on both systems.  In fact, I get a login screen on my X remote system - but when I use the same username/password, it fails.
2007-09-07T15:10:00.000Z	gnurph69	firekool	/ CountX:  can I log in twice with the same userID?  is that why it won't let me do it?
