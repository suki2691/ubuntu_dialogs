2008-03-03T14:51:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Antkin	because the topic is support, and you're not giving any nor asking for any
2008-03-03T14:55:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Antkin	you have given exactly ZERO advice in the hours i have watched you
2008-03-03T14:57:00.000Z	Antkin	prince_jammys	I think you are joking I have been on for 3 hours and welcomed many new visitors and pointed them in the right directions
