2011-01-10T23:49:00.000Z	Scuttle		Uhm...I have a little issue here... I have a bunch of disks with ext4-partitions on them, but fdisk tells me they are HPFS/NTFS... everything works, I'm just kinda confused what gives...
2011-01-10T23:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	Scuttle	change the partition type to 83 linux with fdisk ?
2011-01-10T23:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	Scuttle	personally if everything works is a cosmetic issue i would not bother changing
2011-01-10T23:54:00.000Z	Scuttle	erUSUL	uhm...will that nuke the partition?
