2008-12-07T14:18:00.000Z	rww	Ediferious	usually I'd be all for tutorials on fishing poles, but flash is a PITA to get working sometimes. When he asks about a less messed-up package the instructions will be better :)
2008-12-07T14:19:00.000Z	Ediferious		Haha, okay rww, I didn't have any issue with flash, but I guess I'm not 100% of the population, eh?
2008-12-07T14:19:00.000Z	rww	Ediferious	yeah... I have problems sometimes but not usually. Some people just can't get it to work at all. It works just fine for others. Flash is weird :/
