2008-02-24T19:26:00.000Z	gwork		Hi. When i log into ubuntu  (7.10, fully updated) my gnome session starts and shows desktop icons, top panel, buttom panel, some if not all desktop icons for a second or so. Next, it's only the background (again, also for a few seconds) and then everything pops up again and functions perfectly.  Any idea how to get rid of this?
