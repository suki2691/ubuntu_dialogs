2007-09-21T10:49:00.000Z	inflex		hi there all, I've added an external USB HDD (320GB) and it's all good and well, /except/ that I cannot seem to assert that it should be bound as 'sde', instead it tends to pick a random letter which completely screws up my boot scripts and fstab
2007-09-21T10:49:00.000Z	inflex		is there a way to bind '/dev/sde' only to this particular HDD ?
