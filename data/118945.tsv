2011-01-16T13:46:00.000Z	Mary-Jane		Hi, I have skype that can't locate my soundcard. I looked on troubleshooting and it says that this usually means some application is using it so I disabled the only thing, pulseaudio... It still doesn't work so I'm thinking I don't have a soundcard. What  apt-get install command can I use to get a working soundcard for an integrated setup.
