2010-01-12T23:26:00.000Z	Hautop		Hi again. I installed Ubuntu 9.10 64bit with a LiveCD. Then I tried to boot into ubuntu, but received the error "error: biosdisk write error". Reinstalled twice, still same error. Im not able to start ubuntu, but the LiveSession worked well. Does anybody know this error or how I can fix it? thx in advance
