2007-04-01T10:12:00.000Z	Draconicus		Okay, Ubuntu. This is getting serious and I have less time than a man who's five minutes late to save the world.
2007-04-01T10:14:00.000Z	Draconicus		AVI files, MPG, MOV, WMV, You name it, it freezes. No matter what I play, no matter what player, X locks up completely at some point during the file - usually the beginning. I need help, and I need it right away. I'd appreciate it if anyone who could help to choose not to ignore me in this situation.
2007-04-01T10:15:00.000Z	Draconicus		There must be somebody in the 200+ people on that list who knows a thing or two about codecs. I've reinstalled them all. I still get nothing. I've tried everything I can think of and still can't get it to play without freezing. It used to work fine. I made a LOT of changes since the last time I successfully played a video file, so I don't know what I did, exactly, to cause this.
