2011-01-09T02:37:00.000Z	brack101	Jordan_U	Grub2 is what 10.04 uses?
2011-01-09T02:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brack101	Yes.
2011-01-09T02:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	brack101	And the error you are getting is from grub legacy (so you were most likely installing the wrong version of grub, which is one reason the chroot method is preffered).
