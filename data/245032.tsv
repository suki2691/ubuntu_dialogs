2005-03-25T15:56:00.000Z	caliber		How can I change apache from trying to look for everything in /var/www/apache2-default instead of /var/www ??
2005-03-25T15:56:00.000Z	njs12345	caliber	look in /etc/apache2
2005-03-25T15:56:00.000Z	njs12345		I seem to remember the conf option is called DocumentRoot, but I might be wrong
2005-03-25T15:56:00.000Z	caliber	njs12345	ill look, thanks
