2010-11-09T09:23:00.000Z	niteshade		i haven't really logged my ip over time, so i don't know (in theory, it should change each time) but does one's ip change every time they go online?
2010-11-09T09:24:00.000Z	niteshade		I think it'd be easier if one's ip never changed so you could just memorize it like your phone number
2010-11-09T09:25:00.000Z	niteshade		you gotta set that up somehow?
2010-11-09T09:25:00.000Z	AbhiJit	niteshade	you have to request to yoru isp to get static ip
