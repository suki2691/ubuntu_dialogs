2012-09-24T07:36:00.000Z	mal10c		I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 and I'm trying to slow my mouse pointer down more than the Mouse and Touchpad window is offering, does anyone know of another way to do this?

2012-09-24T07:40:00.000Z	mal10c	WeThePeople	thanks, I hadn't thought of that. I see there's a lot of software that might help
