2011-03-15T03:21:00.000Z	mrbrdo		hello.. i seem to have had a disk failure... now when i reboot, grub enters "minimal" mode.. what does this mean about the disk? grub is still on the disk, right? so it's not totally broken?
2011-03-15T03:21:00.000Z	cchildress	mrbrdo	there are hdd testing tools...i'd suggest trying one. also, what happens when you try to boot from a livecd?
2011-03-15T03:22:00.000Z	cchildress	mrbrdo	can you read your hdd from a livecd?
2011-03-15T03:22:00.000Z	mrbrdo	cchildress	will try, thanks
