2012-03-31T16:12:00.000Z	yeats	gask8er	hmm that has always worked for me - not knowing exactly what you did, I'm not sure what to advise
2012-03-31T16:17:00.000Z	yeats	gask8er	do you have more than one version of linux installed on your computer?
2012-03-31T16:40:00.000Z	yeats	gask8er	have you installed ubuntu on this laptop before and then reinstalled? it doesn't make sense that 1) you don't see the Windows option and 2) nothing people have suggested has changed anything
