2005-06-28T10:25:00.000Z	PaloDeQueso		So I'm trying to manually install the latest nvidia drivers and I got to the point where it wants to start compiling, like it found /usr/src/linux and was happy, but then it gave an error message say ing I should read the log and exited :( So I read the log and I can't make haeads or tails of it, perhaps someone can help?
2005-06-28T10:26:00.000Z	sysrq	PaloDeQueso	use the ubuntu packaged nvidia drivers
2005-06-28T10:27:00.000Z	PaloDeQueso	sysrq	, But I was thinking I could get a small performance boost from using newer ones?
2005-06-28T10:27:00.000Z	sysrq	PaloDeQueso	doubtful
