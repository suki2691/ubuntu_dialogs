2006-08-01T07:21:00.000Z	Badm4n	longwave	: so what should i do ? i need to run iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -i eth3 --dport 80 -j ROUTE -oif eth0 but its say : Bad argument `eth0'
2006-08-01T07:21:00.000Z	longwave	Badm4n	sorry, i know a bit of iptables, but not enough to help you there
2006-08-01T07:36:00.000Z	longwave	Badm4n	you might get a response if you post on the ubuntu forums, that is better for advanced topics like iptables
