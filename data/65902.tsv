2009-02-25T02:01:00.000Z	Quontrex_Ashimi		guys is there a way to detect my network device again?
2009-02-25T02:01:00.000Z	Quontrex_Ashimi		something like dpkg-reconfigure networking or something?
2009-02-25T02:01:00.000Z	hwilde	Quontrex_Ashimi	/etc/init.d/networking restart
2009-02-25T02:02:00.000Z	Quontrex_Ashimi	hwilde	I did that, did this install in another machine and transplanted the drive due to no usb support and no cdrom
