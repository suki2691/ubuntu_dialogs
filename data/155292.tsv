2007-02-22T10:17:00.000Z	jmworx	hendrixski	How do I get a bug moved up the list?
2007-02-22T10:18:00.000Z	hendrixski	jmworx	if you open a case they can give a bug more priority, after all, you're paying for it.  Just ask them :)
2007-02-22T10:19:00.000Z	jmworx	hendrixski	No, I'm not paying for it. I just thought I'd help by trying to fix year-old bugs and things like that.
