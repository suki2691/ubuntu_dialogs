2010-09-11T19:39:00.000Z	bbbacat		I'm new with ubuntu and I'm basically a windows user trying something different. But there is one problem that is making difficult to me to experience this.
2010-09-11T19:39:00.000Z	bbbacat		   does any one knows what could cause the backspace button to "click" by itself each 4/5 seconds?
2010-09-11T19:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bbbacat	 dirty keyboard?  try it on the consold see if it still does it.
2010-09-11T19:44:00.000Z	bbbacat	Dr_Willis	I don't think its a dirty keyboard problem, 'cause it works fine on the other OS... anyway thanks.
