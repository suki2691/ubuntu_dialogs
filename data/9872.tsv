2011-10-09T21:37:00.000Z	meta-coder		Help, I have a USB ADSL router that requires the module rndis_host to get detected. I've added it to /etc/modules but still the router won't get detected.. Saw the dmesg log, and  I think that it requires rndis_wlan module too. I tried adding all the dependency modules of rndis_host and rn_wlan but still my router won't get detected... Help

2011-10-09T21:40:00.000Z	sneumann		Hi, I am bitten by https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/initramfs-tools/+bug/596554 , I had a working natty, and after updating to oneiric my logical volumes are always inactive. grub2 will drop me to busybox, where I lvm lvchange -ay /dev/path/to/lv and can continue to boot, but same problem after next reboot.
2011-10-09T21:41:00.000Z	meta-coder	sneumann	ok i'll try that.. there is a certain period of time during the boot sequence such that if I start my router during that it gets detected. I won't detect if i switch on the router too early or too late.. This is weird.. I'm using Xubuntu...
