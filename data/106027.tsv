2008-08-10T13:21:00.000Z	OsamaK		Hello! I used Ubuntu on my laptop, now, I'm planning to sell it, how do I restore my ext* (That used by Ubuntu) to get full NTSF space
2008-08-10T13:22:00.000Z	Bodsda	OsamaK	use gparted to delete the partitions (youll need a live cd for this) then reformat as ntfs
2008-08-10T13:24:00.000Z	OsamaK	Bodsda	I'll try this
2008-08-10T13:25:00.000Z	OsamaK	Bodsda	Is it come with Ubuntu 8.04 by defualt?
