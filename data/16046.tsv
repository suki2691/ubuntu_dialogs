2011-06-16T11:05:00.000Z	elijahsh		I have a problem with playing music in Ubuntu 11.04 Banshee and Rhythmbox do the same. Most time they play normally. But some time music plays  with echo and noise. Anyone experience same problem? How to fix it? (Now I restart player)

2011-06-16T11:10:00.000Z	elijahsh	bullgard4	It is not microphone. It's muted and monitor muted.
2011-06-16T11:12:00.000Z	bullgard4	elijahsh	I do not know the solution. May be another setting in alsamixer is wrong.
