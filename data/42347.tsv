2010-07-23T01:56:00.000Z	siteswapper		I let Evolution fetch my mail via POP3, and quite often two or three mails are glued together and only the top one iss shown in the messages overview window.  This way spam can hide important mail.
2010-07-23T01:56:00.000Z	siteswapper		Is this known to anybody?
