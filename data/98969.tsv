2008-02-27T22:51:00.000Z	werneck	frank232	the custom install cd is almost done is working... that's not the issue... I just need the smallest possible x server there, and I need to copy the packages to the cd
2008-02-27T23:05:00.000Z	frank232	werneck	sudo apt-get -s install packagename will give a list of what would be installed without actually doing it
2008-02-27T23:07:00.000Z	werneck	frank232	I know that, but I'm way ahead of it, sorry
