2007-02-19T12:23:00.000Z	Slart	Klick_	there are a few.. nothing stable and easy yet, I'm afraid
2007-02-19T12:24:00.000Z	Slart	Klick_	there's the cairo-dock and another called avant
2007-02-19T12:24:00.000Z	Slart	Klick_	hehe.. then avant or cairo-dock.. I think cairo needs recompiling if you want to add icons to it
