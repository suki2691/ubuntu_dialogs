2008-02-06T06:49:00.000Z	Tazbo		Ubuntu updated this morning.  Since then I am unable to use any internet access except IRC/MSN/YAHOO/etc anything in Pidgin.  Web is broken, ftp, ping, nothing but chat related stuff goes through.. Is there a way to go back to before the update, like on windows(last known good configuration), or anybody give me some ideas of where to start?

2008-02-06T06:52:00.000Z	Tazbo	RequinB5	I'm assuming something in the update... I update every day so only something on todays list of updates could have caused it... one of the updates was the kernel, which did not complete correctly, but I even tried booting with an older kernel and I have the same problems
