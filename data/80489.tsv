Power on, boot from CD, choose language, choose "Install Ubuntu Server" - at this point the machine reboots. I'm guessing it's a hardware problem or incompatibility but thought I'd ask if anyone has seen this before I start stripping bits out to find the culprit.

2009-04-08T14:35:00.000Z	stetho	ikonia	I agree but I've never seen Ubuntu (or other distro) die before it's even started the install.
