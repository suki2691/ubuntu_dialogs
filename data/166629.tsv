2011-06-21T01:20:00.000Z	io	wols_	then what is the solution? I'm not, or have never experienced this issue - it is for a friend
2011-06-21T01:21:00.000Z	wols_	io	you can rm files, but don't rm directories
2011-06-21T01:21:00.000Z	io	wols_	ok, so if you remove the directory then Ubuntu won't re-create it?
