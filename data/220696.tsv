2005-12-22T08:59:00.000Z	GlassCasket		I searched Google for this, but didnt find exactly what I was looking for.I have a hardrive with XP and on and I'm getting another drive soon. And want to tripple boot, so one drive has XP and the other drive has two distros. Anyone know of a comprehensize guide of doing so?
