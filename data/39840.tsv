2009-12-30T09:44:00.000Z	ilovealcoa		hello, is it socially acceptable to plead for help with certain problems with ubuntu?
2009-12-30T09:45:00.000Z	ilovealcoa		thanks kinja
2009-12-30T09:47:00.000Z	ilovealcoa		ok, can anybody help?  problem: ubuntu claims that certain files it has created are > 100,000 GB, despite the fact that they are entirely contained on a partition that is less than 50 GB.  this evidently leads to problems when attempting to copy the files to another medium.  does anybody know some way to work around this?
2009-12-30T09:48:00.000Z	jaem|away	ilovealcoa	are the files intact or important?  e.g. can you just blammo them and be done with it?
