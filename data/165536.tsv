2007-04-04T16:10:00.000Z	armadill0		Hi all, I'm trying to figure out which version of GCC is installed.  With gcc --version I see: gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20060928 (prerelease) (Ubuntu 4.1.1-13ubuntu5) ...  I am trying to set up distcc so its important to know which version I'm running, but I can't tell from the output if this is 4.1.1 or 4.1.2    Anyone know?  thanks
2007-04-04T16:11:00.000Z	eck	armadill0	it is 4.1.1 with patches that made it into 4.1.2 :-(
2007-04-04T16:11:00.000Z	eck		i would use 4.1.2 as the version
2007-04-04T16:11:00.000Z	armadill0	eck	ok, thanks
