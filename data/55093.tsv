2011-01-16T04:50:00.000Z	Irreducibilis		I'm worried about the implications of upcoming Ubuntu releases. Will we be forced to switch to Unity in favor of GNOME? I like GNOME.

2011-01-16T04:50:00.000Z	Irreducibilis	edbian	Okay good. I was afraid I'd have to switch to Debian.
2011-01-16T04:51:00.000Z	edbian	Irreducibilis	Of course not.
