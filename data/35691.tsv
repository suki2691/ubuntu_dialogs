2010-03-28T19:20:00.000Z	Natanael_L		Hi. Firefox froze, and now my whole X is not responding as it should. The mouse pointer moves and there's those "mouseover tips" on items on the gnome panel. How do I fix it? (I'm using irssi by hitting ^F1)
2010-03-28T19:21:00.000Z	djuber	Natanael_L	you could try to kill X. it will restart.
2010-03-28T19:21:00.000Z	Natanael_L		(and how do I hide joins/leaves in irssi?)
2010-03-28T19:21:00.000Z	Natanael_L	djuber	SHould I do that from ^F2-6?
