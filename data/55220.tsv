2011-06-27T20:49:00.000Z	thinkpad		Hey guys, how do I find out the owner of a specific file? Im having trouble getting rsync to copy this certain directory
2011-06-27T20:49:00.000Z	edbian	thinkpad	ls -l /path/to/file/
2011-06-27T21:03:00.000Z	edbian	thinkpad	turn -vv on in rsync.  It will tell you what is going on (very verbose)
2011-06-27T21:04:00.000Z	edbian	thinkpad	sure
