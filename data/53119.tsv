Problem is, how do I connect to it from Windows? I used Webmin to set it up, with a setting of allowing everybody access, but Windows says it can't find it, or that the user may not have permissions to access it.
2009-08-03T02:20:00.000Z	Lint01	OttifantSir	do you use IP adresses to connect?
2009-08-03T02:21:00.000Z	OttifantSir	Lint01	Yes. I use \\192.168.0.120\share
2009-08-03T02:22:00.000Z	OttifantSir	Lint01	the share is three 1TB discs in LVM array, mounted to \home\ottiserver\share
