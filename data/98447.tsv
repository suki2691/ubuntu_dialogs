2008-05-05T18:49:00.000Z	azuki		hey there... a quick question.. is there a way to find out in the bash (without mounting a device) to check out the drive inf? (e.g. the ATA ST 340016A and something more to be able to identify the drive contents)
2008-05-05T18:49:00.000Z	azuki		if WITH mounting.. thatś ok too
