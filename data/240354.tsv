2008-01-09T11:54:00.000Z	puargs		Hi! I have a question: I totally borked my network settings. I installed/removed dhcpd, installed/removed firestarter, and was messing with ifconfig. Suddenly, neither of my eth connections will connect to the internet. they will both resolve a proper IP, but no internet. is there anywhere i can start to fix this?

2008-01-09T11:57:00.000Z	nickrud	puargs	pointers to dns servers, more accurately
2008-01-09T11:58:00.000Z	nickrud	puargs	that was the limit of my networking ideas :)
