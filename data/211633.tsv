2007-12-20T20:50:00.000Z	Desolator		Every cracker trying to brute-force their way into your box will know it has an account named root and will try that first. What they don't know is what the usernames of your other users are. Since the root account password is locked, this attack becomes essentially meaningless, since there is no password to crack or guess in the first place. --> that's covering a big problem: if the hacker is in your system he knows your current password and he just ru
