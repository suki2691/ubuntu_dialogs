2006-03-17T17:09:00.000Z	jariep1_		does anybody here have experience with installing reiser4 file system on ubuntu 5.10
2006-03-17T17:09:00.000Z	Frogzoo	jariep1_	sigh - if you can't install reiser - you don't need it...
2006-03-17T17:10:00.000Z	jariep1_	Frogzoo	yes I do... I have a flatfile wiki that's growing, and reiser would let me add unlimited files to the filesystem
