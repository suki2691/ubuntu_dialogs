2007-06-15T10:33:00.000Z	idefixx	isherm775	sry as disasm pointed out what i said before was probably not correct. are you using a cable-modem to connect to the internet or dsl?
2007-06-15T10:34:00.000Z	isherm775	idefixx	I'm plugged directly into the cable modem -- but i have a router here that I could set up if it would help.
2007-06-15T10:35:00.000Z	idefixx	isherm775	well in that case try to plug your ethernet cable into the router just to see if you can connect to it... if necessary set a static ip.
