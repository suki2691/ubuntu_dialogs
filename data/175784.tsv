2006-07-07T05:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	vem0m	Why recommend ATI when so many people are having problems with them...  Nvidia chipsets seem to be the best choice for video cards in linux...(THis week)
2006-07-07T05:41:00.000Z	vem0m	Jack_Sparrow	although nvidia has more linux support its easy to install with the right guide 5 min max install time also of note they run quicker and faster nvidia burns in wrong and can overheat easy causing less proformance then they already do or burn out
