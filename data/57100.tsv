2009-10-31T07:32:00.000Z	D3RGPS31		I just installed ubuntu 9.10 (unteenth time) and noticed there's no xorg.conf; whenever i installed fglrx drivers i would get a blank/black screen during splash, freezing; reconfiguring xorg didn't help

2009-10-31T07:34:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	module000	none
2009-10-31T07:34:00.000Z	module000	D3RGPS31	that's not normal, why don't you run the dpkg config to gen one
