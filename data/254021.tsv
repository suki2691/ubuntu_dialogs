2005-01-02T15:49:00.000Z	bob2	siddharth	universe is not for random updates to things, it's for unsupported Free software.  firefox is in main, and in hoary is at 1.0 and 0.9.3 in warty.  the warty version will not be upgraded.
2005-01-02T15:51:00.000Z	bob2	siddharth	er, haory is the unstable version of ubuntu, and is breaking kinda regularily atm
2005-01-02T15:52:00.000Z	siddharth	bob2	oops.... Guess I'll wait for the stable version. I gave up being on the bleeding edge some time ago :)
