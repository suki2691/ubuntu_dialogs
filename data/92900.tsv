2008-10-16T04:16:00.000Z	Danskmand	rob	(00:47:02) Danskmand: Howdy :-) - After -a-lot- of work and searching and trial-and-error I found out that the driver fcpci is part of the kernel of my 8.04 Ubuntu. So finally I got capisuite to work with fcpci....But when sending a fax, I see in capisuite.error "controller doesnt support fax-services". Is that true ? - the pre-installed driver doesnt support faxing ?
