2010-04-09T04:21:00.000Z	katycorp		I have a question on dual booting Ubuntu and windows 7. If I want to create a shared partition, what's the best (most stable) format to use? fat32, NTFS?
2010-04-09T04:22:00.000Z	katycorp		I had read some posts that it was more stable than NTFS in terms of ubuntu reading/writing to it
2010-04-09T04:23:00.000Z	katycorp		but I guess it's since been resolved
2010-04-09T04:25:00.000Z	mathieu__	katycorp	I use both Ubuntu 9.10 and Windows 6.1 at the same system and accessing an NTFS partition for my documents without any problems on both operating systems.
