2008-07-25T11:04:00.000Z	stage73	Trinix	can't find those options either under F8 or as a boot parameter for tightvnc or xvncviewer, am i missing something?
2008-07-25T11:05:00.000Z	stage73	Trinix	yeah, no problem getting the client to come up - just can't scale it to fit my screen
2008-07-25T11:25:00.000Z	stage73	Trinix	if you're still there and interested in the VNC screen-scale issue... scaling down on my server is not really an option
