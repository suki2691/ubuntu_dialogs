2006-06-19T06:58:00.000Z	ghost		okay the wee networkManager applet top right of the screen has a small orange exclamation mark next to it, claiming no network connection. I can use the internet and can now access the ssh server and web server from other computers on the network. BUT i cant ping either computer from the other and this exclamation mark remains. Does anyone have any idea what is going on here?
