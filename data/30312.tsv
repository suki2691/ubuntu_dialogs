2011-05-03T18:42:00.000Z	Pici	Moopz	No. You must go through intermediary versions. The only time this isn't the case is when you are upgrading from one LTS release to the next, and 11.04 is not an LTS.
2011-05-03T18:42:00.000Z	Moopz	Pici	oh? I thought all xx.04 versions were LTS?
2011-05-03T18:43:00.000Z	Moopz	Pici	any idea when the next LTS version is coming then?
