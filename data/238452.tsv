2008-11-12T03:48:00.000Z	nathan42100		Hey, question for you guys. I just upgraded from 8.04.1 and had some trouble. First, I needed to fix all the packages using an older kernel version. Second, after reinstalling the restricted drivers for my gfx card, I have no desktop. All my icons are still in my desktop folder, they just don't show up. Any ideas as to the latter?
2008-11-12T03:48:00.000Z	aaron	nathan42100	what is your card?
2008-11-12T03:49:00.000Z	aaron	nathan42100	did you install the driver from Nvidia?
