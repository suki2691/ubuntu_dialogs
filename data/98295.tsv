2008-04-17T20:37:00.000Z	Leeuw	vlad	tommm' s answer was probably right, but is dangerous to edit xorg.conf, easy to break things; do some google 'ing on ATI and XORG, do some study, see if you understand and try from there, if there's no better answer here; but keep trying, someone might know better solution.
