2011-05-04T02:43:00.000Z	dfclark_		Any help on installing Java on Ubuntu 10.10?
2011-05-04T02:44:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	dfclark_	What flavour of Java do you want to install?
2011-05-04T02:49:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	dfclark_	openjdk-6 should install just fine or are you trying to install (gasp...) Oracle JDK 1.6?
2011-05-04T02:52:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	dfclark_	I've tried to install the Oracle one, to no avail. For simple projects openjdk-6 will do just fine. For the more complex ones, especially for closed libs, Oracle JDK might indeed be required...
