2009-12-11T22:15:00.000Z	AutumnAi		Hello everyone. I have a bit of a problem. Could someone help me out?
2009-12-11T22:16:00.000Z	AutumnAi		My Windows 7 partition disappeared from GRUB, and I don't know why.
2009-12-11T22:17:00.000Z	AutumnAi		It's a lot lighter on resources than Vista.
2009-12-11T22:18:00.000Z	chadi	AutumnAi	you said your 7 partition was gone? Were you able to re-access it?
