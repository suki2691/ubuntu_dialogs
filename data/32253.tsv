2010-05-17T07:42:00.000Z	severnaya		Hello, can someone help me get yum working in ubuntu? I already did "apt-get install yum" but it doesn't see any packages.  Thanks :)
2010-05-17T07:43:00.000Z	kyubutsu	severnaya	thats probably because ubunt uses apt not yum
2010-05-17T07:44:00.000Z	severnaya	kyubutsu	there has to be a way to get it to work or else ubuntu wouldnt have yum in the repositories
2010-05-17T07:45:00.000Z	severnaya	kyubutsu	i dont want to use apt, it sucks compared to yum
