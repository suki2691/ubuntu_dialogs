2012-05-21T21:31:00.000Z	ryuguns		I have a failed UBuntu 12.04 upgrade.
2012-05-21T21:31:00.000Z	ryuguns		It boots up and then it says "Checking battery state..." and doesn't do anything from there, this is the result of losing power while I was upgrading, what should I do?
2012-05-21T21:33:00.000Z	OerHeks	ryuguns	does your ubuntu boot up grub2?
