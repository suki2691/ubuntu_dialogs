2008-11-22T06:30:00.000Z	Shadoukun		I'm running Ubuntu 8.10 and I have a Creative X-fi with the official drivers. I have a headset plugged in, and everytime I speak it plays back. Everything I say is replayed to me and everything I play (youtube, music etc) is played back to anyone who I might be talking to (skype) Is there anyway to fix either of these?
