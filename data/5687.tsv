2012-08-11T03:36:00.000Z	deadmund	KatsumeBlisk	OerHeks I agree. One possible issue.  If you install xchat in both distros the same settings file will be used in the home folder and it is likely the settings files are constructed differently.  Therefore when Ubuntu xchat writes it's settings they will appear as nonsense to arch's xchat and visa-versa

2012-08-11T03:38:00.000Z	deadmund	KatsumeBlisk	TheMadDrizzle I agree with that
