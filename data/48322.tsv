2009-09-20T02:36:00.000Z	Maelos`		How can I go about installing newer versions of a given package?  Jaunty comes with ejabberd 2.0.3, but I'd like the 2.0.5 package.  Is it possible to install that set of packages?
2009-09-20T02:36:00.000Z	Maelos`		That is, without upgrading the entire distro?
2009-09-20T02:37:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Maelos`	either find a ppa for ejabberd or a deb package.
