2008-01-13T06:38:00.000Z	MrObvious	Sleepwal1	I haven't heard anything like that. As far as I know high end cards like 8800s tend to do fine.
2008-01-13T06:38:00.000Z	MrObvious	Sleepwal1	All I had to do on my laptop with an 8600m was download the drivers from NVidia on 7.04 and 7.10 it just worked automatically.
