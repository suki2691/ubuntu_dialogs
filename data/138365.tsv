2007-04-25T10:30:00.000Z	ytsestef		i get the following message in synaptic: "The repository might be no longer available or could not be contacted because of network problems. If available an older version of the failed index will be used. Otherwise the repository will be ignored. Check your network connection and the correct writing of the repository address in the preferences." what is wrong?
