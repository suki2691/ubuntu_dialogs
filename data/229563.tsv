2005-08-24T15:05:00.000Z	Stompey00		I have a quick que? I'm setting this os up for a friend and have connected anexternal modem.  I was told to sodu ln -s/dev/modem/devttys0 to establish a syslink to the serial port.  I'm a newbie so bear with me.  I take it i do this from terminal? I tried but it said invalid command.  How does one get the root in terminal like cd.. or such in widows?
2005-08-24T15:07:00.000Z	Stompey00		will that work from name /home/ in the terminal or do I need /?
