2008-10-18T10:44:00.000Z	FreshUbuntuNoob	Reaverbot	I am on it right now using Pidgin. Also this is not the right channel to discuss it
2008-10-18T10:47:00.000Z	FreshUbuntuNoob	Reaverbot	Working normally. Must be some sort of problem with the server responsible for that domain
2008-10-18T10:50:00.000Z	Reaverbot	FreshUbuntuNoob	Yeah, I use .net passport, maybe is that... or maybe is my e-mail direction.
