2009-10-16T03:34:00.000Z	tipi		By mistake I deleted all the applications and system->settings in the menu panel in gnome. I already tried to reset the panel which brought back the applications but not the "system->settings". How bring back the settings?
2009-10-16T03:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	tipi	right click on the panel and choose add to panel. in the list of applets there is the one that draws the menus (there are two versions one with only one button and the default Apps Places System menu )
2009-10-16T03:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	tipi	works here...
2009-10-16T03:40:00.000Z	tipi	erUSUL	but works usually but not when they are deleted I guess
