The installation went smoothly the third try, and everything was running perfecly until I decided to run the update manager; which never finished updating, and I had to force-quit it.

2011-02-10T06:56:00.000Z	PetePorty		 Ubuntu is running EXTREMELY slow, mcuh slower than when I run it with the live CD.
