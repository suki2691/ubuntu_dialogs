2009-05-07T04:36:00.000Z	smacfarl		so i just upgraded to 9.04 and my lcd screen goes to sleep when it loads the log in screen. Says unknown signal.
2009-05-07T04:37:00.000Z	smacfarl		I'm guessing I have to manual override some setting because something is not being detected correctly or there is a bug in my monitor identification hardware in the lcd. What do i change
2009-05-07T04:38:00.000Z	FrankQC	smacfarl	reinstall gdm and ubuntu-desktop
2009-05-07T04:38:00.000Z	FrankQC	smacfarl	hopefully it will work
