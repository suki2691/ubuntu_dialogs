2012-07-02T20:24:00.000Z	hudu		Question: I'm installing 12.04 LTS but I want to use LXDE and Openbox (or maybe Fluxbox).  Do I first run the standard installation and then change the DE and WM after Ubuntu is up and running?  Or is there a guideline for telling it to install initially using this software instead of the default DE/WM?  I have not been able to locate such a guideline with google.
