2009-11-17T22:11:00.000Z	Beltz		I tried Ubuntu about 2 years ago and wasn't crazy about it... but now Vista is driving me nuts. Anyway has there been much change in Ubuntu in tthe last 2 versions or so? Or just small modifications? ps - i dont really care about bundledd software personally...
2009-11-17T22:11:00.000Z	Beltz		Interface changes, interface customizability perhaps...

2009-11-17T22:11:00.000Z	starhash	Beltz	It's better in small ways, not a radical interface shift.
