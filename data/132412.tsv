2007-06-10T05:45:00.000Z	chip273		can someone tell me where to set the typematic rates and delays with numeric values instead of a no-value-showing-slider.
2007-06-10T05:45:00.000Z	n2diy	chip273	take a look at the man page for loadkeys.
2007-06-10T05:47:00.000Z	chip273	n2diy	that is of no help, no such setting in there
2007-06-10T05:47:00.000Z	n2diy	chip273	ok, maybe in .bashrc?
