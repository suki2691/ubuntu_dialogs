2011-11-22T01:31:00.000Z	reisio	sniz-	I think you'd just tell it where your Windows is (it should know already)
2011-11-22T01:32:00.000Z	reisio	sniz-	but why have two distros
2011-11-22T01:35:00.000Z	reisio	sniz-	I wouldn't say GRUB can't have an entry just for your wubi install, just that you don't particularly need one
