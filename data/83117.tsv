2011-05-15T04:03:00.000Z	Glycan		 I need to do the RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows thing, but a U livecd/usb has become out of the question. I have and odd OS entitled Slitaz. It's logo is a spider, and it seems quite a bit more intutive and robust than ubuntu, but that's not the question. What do I do?
