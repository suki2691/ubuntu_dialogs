2009-05-15T10:48:00.000Z	Flannel	Clown_Knife	feisty?  How hard is it to reinstall?
2009-05-15T10:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Clown_Knife	to get from feisty to hardy, you have to go feisty (EOL) -> Gutsy (EOL) -> Hardy
2009-05-15T10:50:00.000Z	Clown_Knife	Flannel	yeah not that hard just the backing up and all the configs etc but I think your right it would be easier to reinstall system is not remote its right next to me
