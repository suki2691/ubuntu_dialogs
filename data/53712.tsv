2010-07-10T20:30:00.000Z	idk_		how do i remove a directory with everything inside it? ive tried rm sbnc/*; rmdir sbnc  - but it asks for deletion on every file which is very annoying
2010-07-10T20:31:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	idk_	where does that dir located?
2010-07-10T20:33:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	idk_	have you tried the simpliest way? sudo nautilus? but be careful..
2010-07-10T20:34:00.000Z	scriptwarlock	idk_	i wont recommend it but in some cases we might need it.
