2006-06-02T07:09:00.000Z	anyday		can anyone point me in the right direction? i installed ubuntu 5.10 x86 then i followed the instructions to install kde using apt-get install kubuntu-desktop, now i cant figure out how to make it my default window manager

2006-06-02T07:10:00.000Z	anyday	tonyyarusso	i picked kde, it started up with the kubuntu logo then all the sudden it went back to ubuntu with gnome
2006-06-02T07:12:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	anyday	Then I am truly confused.
