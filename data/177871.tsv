2007-12-08T22:26:00.000Z	richo	Jack_Sparrow	perhaps somehow but i got no problems printing via usb, ooo i dont know really now. it says print job number 19 but it seems like queue is gone now. is this another irrational way from linux to say: "ok this is job 19" but there aren't any queue or jobs before to bother about?

2007-12-08T22:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	richo	no idea on that...
