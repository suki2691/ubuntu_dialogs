2005-06-13T08:02:00.000Z	djim		I'm trying to use the torrents to download the DVD ISOs for Ubuntu and Kubuntu, but the server keeps refusing my connection
2005-06-13T08:04:00.000Z	djim		Thanks sebby. THe topic ran off the top of my screen before I could read it. Is there any word on when the tracker will be back up?
