2005-12-07T10:24:00.000Z	Jowi	mcphail	i heard there is a newer version of skype that correct that problem. look in the forums (ubuntu or skype forums)
2005-12-07T10:24:00.000Z	mcphail	Jowi	i just downloaded it today - i assume there's no cvs version???
2005-12-07T10:26:00.000Z	Jowi	mcphail	yeah i know. there is something wrong with that .deb. I don't remember where i found it. I think if you search for the current version you have in either skype or ubuntu forums you should be able to find it.
