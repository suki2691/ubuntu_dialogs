2005-02-13T10:38:00.000Z	GIJosh		I have a questions about distro upgrades.  If I have a package installed that isn'tinstalled by default...like xfce.  If I run apt get upgrade, will it upgrade xfce to it's newest version?
2005-02-13T10:38:00.000Z	Vjaz	GIJosh	Yes it will if you have installed it with apt-get.
2005-02-13T10:38:00.000Z	GIJosh	Vjaz	 Thanks. :)  Release cycles have always been a mild point of confusion for me.
