2010-07-25T09:29:00.000Z	thune3	jvm	you are trying to add a user on a system you do not have sudo permission for?
2010-07-25T09:29:00.000Z	jvm	thune3	right.
2010-07-25T09:35:00.000Z	jvm	thune3	is that...unrealistic? i mean, on an older system it would just ve worked with chrooting and a simple "adduser", on the livecd.
