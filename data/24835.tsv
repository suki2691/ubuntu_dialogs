2011-01-15T18:06:00.000Z	Mike1		hi! I got a used Dell Latitude D600 and the key “t” is not working with Ubuntu 10.04. I guess it’s a hardware defect, but how can I validate that?
2011-01-15T18:07:00.000Z	cdbs	Mike1	Did you try pressing the same key on other OSes?
2011-01-15T18:08:00.000Z	Mike1	cdbs	no other OSes available (except some linux distros ;) )
2011-01-15T18:08:00.000Z	cdbs	Mike1	hmm, then, I can't think of any way, ask the others
