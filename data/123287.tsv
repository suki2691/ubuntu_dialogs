2007-11-05T12:16:00.000Z	pt		I want to burn an iso. But for the iso to be bootable, do I burn the actual iso or the contents of the iso?

2007-11-05T12:18:00.000Z	Evanlec	pt	yes, right click on iso file and hit "write to disc"
2007-11-05T12:20:00.000Z	Evanlec	pt	you want to burn the contents of the image file then, tho i have never seen that warning on ubuntu
