2010-04-01T22:24:00.000Z	linduxed		since pastebin.com redesigned its site, it seems pastebinit doesn't work anymore
2010-04-01T22:25:00.000Z	linduxed		in fact the only service the command works with anymore is yourpaste, which isn't the best service really
2010-04-01T22:25:00.000Z	linduxed		is there another application, or an update to pastebinit so i can have a proper pastebinning application?
