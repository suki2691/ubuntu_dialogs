2010-08-09T01:24:00.000Z	panzi		my sister has a 1st gen asus netbook and cant boot the netbook from usb to install netbook ubuntu. when she chooses the usb device it still boots the installed os (which is unusable: jollycloud)
2010-08-09T01:25:00.000Z	panzi		has anyone any idea why that might be?
2010-08-09T01:26:00.000Z	Novalok	panzi	possibly a bios setting?
2010-08-09T01:26:00.000Z	panzi	Novalok	she chooses the usb device in the bios to boot from! still the installed OS is booted
