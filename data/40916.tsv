2010-05-24T00:18:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Ganang	do you meant to 'find' a file? you want to learn the find command? is that it?
2010-05-24T00:20:00.000Z	Ganang	onetinsoldier	no sometimes i cannot perform any command operation. For example, i have an open gnome-terminal which has some text refering to an output of a mining algorithm....there are several lines and i want to search specific words....
2010-05-24T00:23:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Ganang	i hear you. not sure how to help. these other folks seem to have some idea for you though. my first thought was what erpingham already suggested. hopefully terminator might be an option for you as well. good luck :)
