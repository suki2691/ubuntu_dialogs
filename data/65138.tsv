2009-03-03T01:07:00.000Z	Droopsta		Im trying to reinstall the grub bootloader because windows wiped it out. I load the live cd and it asks for a user name and password. When I hit enter it opens the ubuntu desktop, but when I click the mouse, Ubuntu restarts. Anyone know how I can get in the live cd?
