2012-05-11T20:13:00.000Z	j605		i am trying to upgrade to 12.04 from 11.10 using a live usb, but upgrage option doesn't show up in the installations options.
2012-05-11T20:14:00.000Z	quixotedon	j605	have you tried using direct upgrade (from update manager)?
2012-05-11T20:15:00.000Z	j605	quixotedon	no, i was planning to conserve some bandwidth and also have a copy of the iso by following this method.
