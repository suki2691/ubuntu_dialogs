2005-12-13T15:26:00.000Z	DuffyX56		To anyone who can help me with gParted, I was messing with it and I made a new disklabel and now my whole second harddrive is gray and all my other stuff like the swap and the linux partition is gone....should I continue making another partition and will my stuff come back or am I screwed?
2005-12-13T15:27:00.000Z	DuffyX56		no, i just left it gray...what should I do?
2005-12-13T15:28:00.000Z	psusi	DuffyX56	then cancel the changes
2005-12-13T15:28:00.000Z	DuffyX56	psusi	how do I partition then, and how do i cancel it?
