2010-01-10T23:37:00.000Z	fatum		How can I give the user "thisuser" permission to do anything in /var/www/mydomain.com ?
2010-01-10T23:38:00.000Z	fatum		 the /var/www/mydomain.com is thisuser's home directory
2010-01-10T23:38:00.000Z	fatum		so I don't see why he cannot upload when I can connect to FTP
