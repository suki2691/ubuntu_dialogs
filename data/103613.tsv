2009-11-27T23:43:00.000Z	AJC_Z0		..which I think should be installed with compiz by default
2009-11-27T23:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AJC_Z0	if you install compizconfig-settings-manager it will install compiz too
2009-12-09T00:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AJC_Z0	i'd ask in #compiz
2009-12-09T00:38:00.000Z	AJC_Z0	ActionParsnip	Will do. Thanks
