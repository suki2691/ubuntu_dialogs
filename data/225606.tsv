2005-08-04T16:53:00.000Z	Ag-Streak		Graah. Hi, back, my 3rd time here ^^;. I have 3 Ubuntu live cd's. One for A64, one for i386, one for Kubuntu A64. All three get through the loading process, then when they go into the UI, the graphics are corrupted. I've tried using every different resolution when it asks for it, and turning off the frame buffer, to no affect.

2005-08-04T16:54:00.000Z	Ag-Streak		Anyone have any idea what would cause the corrupt graphics?
