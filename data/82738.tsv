2010-02-26T01:39:00.000Z	unixSnob		thanks guntbert.. would Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala) be better?  that's the 2nd to the latest netinst version
2010-02-26T01:40:00.000Z	guntbert	unixSnob	9.10 *is* the latest version as of now - if you want a reliable system - yes use it (at least not an alpha version)
