2012-05-18T23:17:00.000Z	bxnub		I get this error "Can't get http://ppa.launchpad.net/gwibber-daily/ppa/ubuntu/dists/jaunty/Contents-amd64.gz
2012-05-18T23:17:00.000Z	bxnub		Apparently a lot of people are getting a similar error with apt-file but nobody has a solution, what's the problem?
2012-05-18T23:17:00.000Z	bxnub		Well, I know it's a 404 error because the file doesn't exist, but why...
2012-05-18T23:18:00.000Z	xangua	bxnub	because it doesn't exist, also jaunty is no loger supported
