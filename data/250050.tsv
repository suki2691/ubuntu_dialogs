2008-03-24T13:41:00.000Z	crovax		is there annybody who emulate windows from a physical partition?
2008-03-24T13:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	crovax	 vmware and virtualox can run windows from a real install on a hd.. but its not advised.
2008-03-24T13:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	crovax	 wine can also run apps from a windows install.. (again not adviseable)
