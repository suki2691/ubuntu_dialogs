2011-10-06T16:23:00.000Z	sunson		I'm thinking of running a Ubuntu based 'cyber cafe' / work-station environment but I want to run thin clients and utilize my existing powerful box to host virtual machines. Any recommendations? I'm looking for popular, support, trouble-free hardware + software solution.

2011-10-06T16:29:00.000Z	sunson	GirlyGirl	yes. but they must be VMs. LTSP types solutions still require a 'configured' server. I just want to be able to let the workers fully 'administer' their VMs.
