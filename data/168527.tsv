2006-10-20T10:21:00.000Z	luckyone	tritium	of course, but there are debs that are ubuntu specific that aren't in the actual debian repos
2006-10-20T10:22:00.000Z	luckyone	tritium	but anything that makes it into the latest debian-stable branch trickles down into our stream too
2006-10-20T10:25:00.000Z	luckyone	tritium	I like you!
