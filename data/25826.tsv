2010-09-19T04:12:00.000Z	trakinas		I have an WiFi connection (ubuntu). and ordinary ethernet cable. I want to share tmy connection with and win machine (which does not have a wifi cable, nor a gigantic cable able to  reach the house's second floor. ). so.... My Ubuntu has "share internet connectio" checked. Rebooted. xp cant get ips through dhcp, nor ping 10.0.0.4 (my machine) if I manually setup it
2010-09-19T04:12:00.000Z	trakinas		any thought?
