2008-04-06T08:30:00.000Z	M4rotku		can i upgrade to the hardy beta without install all of the other updates for gusty?
2008-04-06T08:30:00.000Z	nickrud	M4rotku	not advised, you should be totally up to date in gutsy before upgrading to hardy
2008-04-06T08:31:00.000Z	M4rotku	nickrud	the reason i want to is because an update package that i installed in the past wiped out my wireless card configs and i had to reinstall everything, that's why i have to upgrade again in the first place
2008-04-06T08:32:00.000Z	nickrud	M4rotku	you could try, but the results are undefined
