2005-01-09T07:42:00.000Z	Benbis		I'm having problems trying to install. I can't mount CD
2005-01-09T07:43:00.000Z	Benbis		Thought it might be because I was using a DVD writer drive, so switched to a plain CD, it still says unable to mount
2005-01-09T07:44:00.000Z	Benbis		Anyone have suggestions on what I should do/check^
2005-01-09T07:45:00.000Z	JDahl	Benbis	what error do you get?
