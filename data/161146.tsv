2006-11-05T07:11:00.000Z	roadrunn1r		after building my own kernel with the vanilla kernel i have the problem that the kernel is booting but when the part of the init script should start the kernel is waiting and waiting but no kernel panic... any hints?

2006-11-05T07:12:00.000Z	roadrunn1r	mc_	i always build my own kernel because i know my hardware and it needs less ram.
