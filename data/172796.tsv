2007-10-19T00:37:00.000Z	Luca		Can I install ubuntu 7.10 without messing up the windows vista bootmgr?
2007-10-19T00:38:00.000Z	Vlet	Luca	yep - works fine if you install linux after installing windows. If you install windows after installing linux, windows overwrites GRUB
2007-10-19T00:41:00.000Z	Vlet	Luca	You don't need to create the partition in vista... just leave some blank space on the drive, and then when installing ubuntu, use that free space
