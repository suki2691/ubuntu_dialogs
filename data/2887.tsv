2012-05-24T05:18:00.000Z	Niebuhr		Hello. I'm having a problem with the Xserver, I guess -- I'm  being told at login that my graphical interfaces are not detected. I've been running 12.04, I guess with xfce fine for two weeks now and was behind on updates, so that can't be the problem. Any help?
2012-05-24T05:18:00.000Z	Niebuhr		I am trying to spare reinstalling the whole system, which I would do in other cases to spare stress.
