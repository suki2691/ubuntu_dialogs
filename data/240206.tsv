2008-01-27T08:25:00.000Z	Leila		 I installed Digikam and wanted to make a slide show with music. but it said that I needed mp2enc. It is not in the repositories. It is not availabe with apt. I did install ImageMagick but that did not work. Can I fix it. Or, is there another way to make a slide show with music?
