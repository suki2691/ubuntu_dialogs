2009-03-04T05:12:00.000Z	kopolee11		thanks ubottu, but i already had a home partition set up when i did the reinstallation. it seems that the guide you gave was for if you didn't have a home partition already set up. is there anyway, i can make my home partition become my home directory.

2009-03-04T05:15:00.000Z	nickrud_	kopolee11	if that doesn't make clear sense, just say so
2009-03-04T05:17:00.000Z	kopolee11	nickrud_	i'm checking out my fstab file, and i'll admit, i'm not exactly sure what i need to add. if you could please clarify that would be very helpful.
