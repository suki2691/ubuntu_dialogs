2007-05-18T10:27:00.000Z	hachi		what's the package necessary to do LVM on ubuntu? I installed lvm2 and pvcreate says 'No program "pvcreate" found for your current version of LVM'
2007-05-18T10:27:00.000Z	hachi		maybe lvm got renamed and I didn't notice?
2007-05-18T10:29:00.000Z	Frogzoo	hachi	having lvm1 & lvm2 on the same machine will get very confusing
2007-05-18T10:30:00.000Z	hachi	Frogzoo	I don't believe lvm1 is available in FF... I'm talking about lvm2 only
