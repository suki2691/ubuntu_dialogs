2005-11-18T08:31:00.000Z	leeroy		Hi, I am trying to install a dual boot of xp and ubuntu 5.10 on my system.  It has two harddrives, one of which is hooked up through ata, and the other of which is hooked up through a pci card with more ata slots.  When I try to install, Windows goes on fine, but then Ubuntu sort of messes things up by popping up the error of "Cannot find operating system".  Any ideas as to the source of this?
