2008-08-11T01:25:00.000Z	Grand_Master		well like what do i need to download to begin?
2008-08-11T01:26:00.000Z	Grobvok	Grand_Master	sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jdk
2008-08-11T02:15:00.000Z	Grobvok	Grand_Master	do a "sudo apt-get install vim" cause ubuntu comes with a basic version of vim which does not suport some things such as syntax highlighting.
