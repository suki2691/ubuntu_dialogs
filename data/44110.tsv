2010-07-27T02:12:00.000Z	hylian	dj_	i see what you mean, the closest i see is 2.6 minimal, 3.0 is too new? need older dependencies?
2010-07-27T02:15:00.000Z	hylian	dj_	don't know if this is what you are looking for but this is supposed to help you if you are using 10.04 and need python 2.5:http://jordilin.wordpress.com/2010/05/02/python2-4-python2-5-and-ubuntu-10-04-lucid-lynx/
2010-07-27T02:17:00.000Z	hylian	dj_	hope that works for you.
