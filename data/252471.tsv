2008-12-11T06:14:00.000Z	l337ingDisorder		Got an issue I'm hoping someone can help with.. when I run the following command...
2008-12-11T06:15:00.000Z	l337ingDisorder		 rdesktop -u<my-username> -d<my-domain> -g1024x768 <address>:33901
2008-12-11T06:16:00.000Z	l337ingDisorder		...it works just fine when I run from terminal, but when I assign it to <SUPER>F12 with gconf-editor, nothing happens when I press <SUPER>F12 (but when <SUPER>F12 is assigned to something like firefox it works just fine)
