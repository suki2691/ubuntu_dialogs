2010-01-24T11:26:00.000Z	roopeshv		so any one who can tell me what to do if kernel panics or i am in grub shell, and have no access to grub menu?
2010-01-24T11:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	roopeshv	 somthing just seems.. odd...
2010-01-24T11:29:00.000Z	roopeshv	Dr_Willis	but it works, as soon as i install ubuntu, and stops working, as soon as i update my kernel, so i hardly think it is hardware
2010-01-24T11:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	roopeshv	 id let memtest run a bit to verify..   it would seem very odd that  the last dozen or so kernel updates would all ahve the same issue..
