2010-03-15T18:29:00.000Z	LogicalDash	jcrawford	possibly the Notification Area or the Window List
2010-03-15T18:32:00.000Z	LogicalDash	jcrawford	right-click the panel. Choose Add Applet.
2010-03-15T18:33:00.000Z	jcrawford	LogicalDash	right I can do that, but I don't recall the applet name and I know it was not listed in my list on Friday.  I would need to know where to get that applet
