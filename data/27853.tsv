2011-10-26T23:00:00.000Z	captainmustard		I installed gnome shell in ubuntu 11.10, and I've installed some custom themes for it. The only problem I'm having is these "file edit view go bookmarks help" buttons showing up in the top right. I can't interact with them and they're covered up if I use a theme without any transparency.
