2010-04-29T10:16:00.000Z	Albi_	hackoo	you dont want to install lucid 'beta' as in a RC i think you mean
2010-04-29T10:16:00.000Z	Albi_	hackoo	it has a memory leaking issue which just as you run it it just fills up your ram more and more
2010-04-29T10:17:00.000Z	hackoo	Albi_	ok, yes I dont want RC. But upgrade option shows only lucid beta.
