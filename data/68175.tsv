2009-01-21T12:54:00.000Z	Alfarin		I took over a friend's laptop (legally, he no longer wants it), but I messed up when I tried to remove his user and adding myself... now when I try to start System > Admin > User & Groups or whateve, it wont let me edit anything... if I try to unlock it, it'll say it encountered an unknown error w/o asking me for password... any idea where that applet is so I can manually su before launching it?
