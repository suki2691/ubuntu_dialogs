2009-01-18T10:03:00.000Z	Guest60113		if i want to be able to run a executable without going to the folder...i need to set the PATH in the .profile right? I tried that but it still doesn't work, and when I tryp echo $PATH....i don't see the path that i entered on .profile nor do i see any of the other paths that exist already from before. Am i doing something wrong?
