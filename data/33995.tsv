2011-08-19T16:28:00.000Z	airtonix	Traintop	which ever you want
2011-08-19T16:28:00.000Z	Traintop		of ubuntu 11.04
2011-08-19T16:30:00.000Z	Traintop	airtonix	I used 32bit-linux all the years and decided to test 11.04 64bit: but now e.g the sound cracks every time I start audio for about 1.5sec... -is this a 64-bit-bug?
