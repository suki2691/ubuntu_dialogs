2008-08-08T03:07:00.000Z	uoaphys		ok i fixed my sound problem (partially) But here is the real problem: I have onboard sound which is detecting, and sblive sound which is detecting both in alsa. However, I want to listen to music, system sounds, etc.. on my sblive ( I don't even use the integrated sound). But music and desktop sounds only come out of the onboard device... any help on how to tell GNOME and all the apps to switch to the sblive? Thanks
2008-08-08T03:09:00.000Z	uoaphys		how do I switch from using one sound card to another (both installed at once)
2008-08-08T03:10:00.000Z	uoaphys		Will you help me? I have onboard sound and an SBLive pci card. I want to use the sblive, but onboard seems to be default and I can't figure where to change it... I double clicked on the sound icon and switched to sblive, but that doesn't seem to do it
