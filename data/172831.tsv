2008-05-09T20:18:00.000Z	Vixus		Does anyone else's rhythmbox just refuse to play anything without giving any errors?
2008-05-09T20:18:00.000Z	Vixus		or rather, rhythmbox won't play anything but there are no errors.
2008-05-09T20:19:00.000Z	Vlet	Vixus	if you start it from a terminal, perhaps it will report some debugging info or errors to the console
2008-05-09T20:19:00.000Z	Vixus	Vlet	tried it.. no errors at all.
