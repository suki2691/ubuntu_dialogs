2011-10-19T06:39:00.000Z	darkfears		does anyone know how I can get NDAS drivers? running Ubuntu 11.10. Have Flash plugin installed, when using firefox it still says "plug-in not installed" when I am trying to view the driver download section on ximeta's website
2011-10-19T06:40:00.000Z	darkfears		so basically i cannot see the link which would allow me to download the NDAS drivers without flash plugin working properly
