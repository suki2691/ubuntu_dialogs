2008-05-08T16:03:00.000Z	emma	askand	the colors in Open Office change when you change your Gnome themes. However, there may be other ways to set the preferences in OO.o but for that you might want to try #openoffice.org
2008-05-08T16:05:00.000Z	emma	askand	you're quite welcome. I have been in a lot of these channels on Freenode. #openoffice.org is not as busy as this one so just ask your question and then look for a reply from someone there later on.
