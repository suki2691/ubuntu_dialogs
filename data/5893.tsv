2012-08-29T17:13:00.000Z	alexr2		I'm having trouble installing ubuntu.  I have 2 hard drives.  Win8 is on the first one.  I want to install ubuntu on the same hard drive.  The installation completes successfully, but when I reboot, it auto boots to win8, without giving me the option to boot up linux.  Any suggestions?
