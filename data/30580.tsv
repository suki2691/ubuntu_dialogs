2012-04-29T00:59:00.000Z	magicJ		I have a system that when booted auto-connects to the router perfectly, the config says to auto-connect.  Yet if the router is re-booted it does not re-connect.  Any ideas?

2012-04-29T01:01:00.000Z	magicJ	sfears	ok - but why - I really want to understand the problem rather than work-around it
2012-04-29T01:02:00.000Z	sfears	magicJ	do you have another router? it may be a problem with the router.
