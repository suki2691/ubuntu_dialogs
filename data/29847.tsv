2010-09-29T20:37:00.000Z	coz_		hey guys...something odd is ocurring here... when installing an application  I get a whole list of of packages  "packages were automatically installed and are no longer equired"  however  it wants to remove default applications such as inkscape on edubuntu and many default installed dependencies as well
2010-09-29T20:38:00.000Z	dominick	coz_	it generally means you have a faulty installation!
2010-09-29T20:40:00.000Z	dominick	coz_	the few times I had the problem (always in a fresh install), I was sure it was the fault of the medium. Try burning another DVD/CD and installing!
2010-09-29T20:41:00.000Z	coz_	dominick	  this was installed with the minimal install cd  ,,,the cd itself is not corrupt however some thing is up with the past weeks updates that is making this occur...it did not happen previously ...same system...same cd...same install
