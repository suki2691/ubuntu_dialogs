2006-07-11T15:55:00.000Z	kismet		HI! There is a way yo interrupt the Dapper installation while it's istalling packages and resume it back? Beacause it seems that the cd that I'm using is broken...
2006-07-11T15:55:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	kismet	don't think so.
2006-07-11T15:57:00.000Z	kismet	Ash-Fox	fyrestrtr, Seamus there is a way to stop by command line the installer and to start it again? Because the installer is locked on gnome-icon-theme package but the console are still available...
2006-07-11T16:12:00.000Z	kismet	Ash-Fox	fyrestrtr, Seamus FYI, you can restart the last step of the installer by killing main-menu program from console :D, BTW that didn't help me :(
