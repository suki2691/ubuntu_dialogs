2006-09-19T07:23:00.000Z	marcus_		good morning.... Can someone tell me if I would see better results running the 686 kernel on a celeron 1.6 as opposed to 386?

2006-09-19T07:25:00.000Z	marcus_	Jack_Sparrow	if it isn't going to make a difference i'll just stay with 386
2006-09-19T07:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	marcus_	It isnt going to make much difference
