2007-10-12T14:44:00.000Z	acecase		anybody old enough to remember when we always had an option to "restart in msdos mode"? How hard would it be to build that in to ubuntu myself?
2007-10-12T14:44:00.000Z	ubersoldat	acecase	why would you want that?
2007-10-12T14:45:00.000Z	acecase	ubersoldat	I just realized I said that wrong. restart in msdos mode was a win95/98 thing. I mean when linux distroes always had a way to say shutdown and restart in windows
