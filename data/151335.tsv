2007-12-13T05:36:00.000Z	juano__	chd176	no just install flash from synaptic or download it from adobe just like in windows :)
2007-12-13T05:37:00.000Z	juano__	chd176	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2007-12-13T05:37:00.000Z	juano__	chd176	restricted formats have support for lots of file types, like mp3, mp4 ..
