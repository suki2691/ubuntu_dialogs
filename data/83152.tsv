I installed some drivers for my intel chipset display, from the intel website (Bad move I know) in attempts to get something working, I need to revert the display settings to back before I installed the drivers. As in the old xorg settings. Would anyone be able to tell me how to do that?

2008-08-09T01:35:00.000Z	NekoCodi	infinitycircuit	thank you. I'll see if that works.
