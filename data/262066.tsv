2005-10-07T14:07:00.000Z	drunken-wallaby		got a little problem when i try to build a little latex-gui called amyedit (amyedit.sourceforge.net). the "make" step breaks because of errors such as (/usr/include/libintl.h:40: Error: expected unqualified-id before "const"). Anyone who has a hint what I could do?
