2009-06-14T00:24:00.000Z	Shaba1		I have a windows xp machine with a 200gb HD. I want to install ubuntu server on 25 gb of that free space. But I have to have windwos for work. If I install ubuntu and I then use gparted livecd to get that space back to windows if I need to.?
2009-06-14T00:25:00.000Z	coz_	Shaba1	 do you have another hard driver you could attach ?
2009-06-14T00:26:00.000Z	coz_	Shaba1	  ok
2009-06-14T00:27:00.000Z	coz_	Shaba1	 the only problem I can forsee is when you remove the ubuntu server partition you will have to reinstall the mbr for windows I believe
