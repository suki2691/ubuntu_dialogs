2010-11-06T11:16:00.000Z	Angel-SL		hi, what's the best way to do bandwidth limiting? i'm going to stay at a holiday home for 2 days and I have to access internet via (most likely) mobile 3G
2010-11-06T11:16:00.000Z	Angel-SL		and I do not want to go over data by accident

2010-11-06T11:16:00.000Z	Angel-SL	reeniginEesreveR	afaik that does speed only, not total data
