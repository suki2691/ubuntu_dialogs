2005-09-07T08:08:00.000Z	wolki		does someone here have an idea how to build an mp3 alarm clock with ubuntu? rhythmbox doesn't work with at either :-/
2005-09-07T08:09:00.000Z	cafuego	wolki	mpg321 and cron?
2005-09-07T08:09:00.000Z	wolki	cafuego	cron might be an idea, but that is so complicated... at is so easy to use... i'll try mpg123 though
2005-09-07T08:18:00.000Z	wolki	cafuego	Nalioth: at+mpg321 works, thank you. it's not a good solution because i have to edit the script to choose a new mp3 but it's much better than not waking up until a new muine plugin is done. :) thank you very much!
