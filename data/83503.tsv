2008-08-29T06:57:00.000Z	critter		I just installed Java in Dapper, but all my Java apps are running horribly slow. Does anyone know how to fix that?

2008-08-29T06:58:00.000Z	critter	qr	the package I installed was sun-java5, so I'm thinking it's the right one.
2008-08-29T06:58:00.000Z	qr_	critter	indeed... maybe try java6? I don't know.
