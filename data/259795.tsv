2006-01-13T11:27:00.000Z	muhammad		Why isn't Firefox 1.5 available in the repos?
2006-01-13T11:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	muhammad	because it would break things, even as a backport
2007-08-10T10:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	muhammad	because it's a KDE app - ubuntu has a pdf viewer though
2007-08-10T10:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	muhammad	try kubuntu-desktop if you want to install KDE
