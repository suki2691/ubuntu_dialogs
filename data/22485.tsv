2011-01-13T01:38:00.000Z	Tekk_		how do I install a package without it's dependencies? sudo apt-get install --no-deps foo isn't working
2011-01-13T01:39:00.000Z	bencahill	Tekk_	why?
2011-01-13T01:39:00.000Z	Tekk_	bencahill	installing a package that depends on virtual packages that aren't needed(just artwork and stuff that it should take from my theme)
2011-01-13T01:39:00.000Z	Tekk_	bencahill	so I already installed all the real deps, leaving just them ;)
