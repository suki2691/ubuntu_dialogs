2005-09-12T07:32:00.000Z	dooglus	ccfiel	it depends.  my only machine is running breezy, and it's mostly been ok.  i've had about 3 days where I couldn't run GNOME, but otherwise mostly OK
2005-09-12T07:33:00.000Z	ccfiel	DVSoftware	when will be the best to update to breezy?
2005-09-12T07:33:00.000Z	dooglus	ccfiel	it's certainly safer to stay with hoary though
