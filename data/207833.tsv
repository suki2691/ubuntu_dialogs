2007-09-13T13:22:00.000Z	Textbook		is there any way to track / fix what might be causing random automatic logoffs?  I suspect it is either XGL or Compiz, but I'm not sure
2007-09-13T13:23:00.000Z	dystopianray	Textbook	is it an actual logoff or just the X server dieing?
2007-09-13T13:23:00.000Z	dystopianray	Textbook	your X server has probably crashed and died
2007-09-13T13:23:00.000Z	dystopianray	Textbook	try not using compiz/beryl and see if it still occurs
