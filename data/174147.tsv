2006-08-10T13:57:00.000Z	micahcowan	josh_	 do you have a question? It wasn't clear, and  you should really use make xconfig or at least menuconfig...
2006-08-10T14:01:00.000Z	micahcowan	josh_	that's the console pre-build configuration quiz...
2006-08-10T14:02:00.000Z	micahcowan	josh_	did you get to a part where it says it made bzimage and stuck it somewhere?
2006-08-10T14:08:00.000Z	micahcowan	josh_	are you making a stock kernel from tarball (say, from kernel.org), or are you building from the source package for ubuntu? I can only really support the latter.
