2009-04-21T02:04:00.000Z	hubbard		I have Ubuntu 8.04, when I insert a DVD-rw I get this error: http://pastebin.com/m30eb693f. My /etc/fstab is here: http://pastebin.com/m13efad1e
2009-04-21T02:05:00.000Z	hubbard		Could it be that my fstab is not correct?

2009-04-21T02:07:00.000Z	hubbard	histo	it does not happen when I insert, for example, a movie into the DVD player. It only happens with a blank DVD-rw.
