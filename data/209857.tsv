2008-02-16T21:46:00.000Z	Alp-		today i got a second monitor which i want to use for dualhead view. i have an nvidia card and activated twinview which works fine now. but i cant start compiz, i get an error: segmentiation fault (core dumped). what can i do now?
2008-02-16T21:46:00.000Z	Alp-		should i ask in compiz channel instead? i am not sure
2008-02-16T21:47:00.000Z	LjL	Alp-	it's a good idea i think
