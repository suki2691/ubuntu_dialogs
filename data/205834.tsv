2005-12-05T06:20:00.000Z	pbransford	ericmoritz	it isn't actually "released" yet. give it a day or so and some more for the package maintainer to remove his thumb from the anus
2005-12-05T06:21:00.000Z	ericmoritz	pbransford	it has been released http://www.mozilla.com
2005-12-05T06:21:00.000Z	pbransford	ericmoritz	ok, but the maintainer has to package it and get it into the repos, which then have to propigate the mirrors
