2007-10-27T07:13:00.000Z	phasegen		Anyone have ideas for a work around?  I may have hit a fatal flaw that won't allow me to install gutsy.  The installer won't recognize that I have two ide hard drives.  One for root, and one for home.

2007-10-27T07:15:00.000Z	phasegen	dystopianray	It sees hda but not hdb, and won't let me include hdb in the partitioner
2007-10-27T07:18:00.000Z	phasegen	dystopianray	I can mount hdb (home) with the live disk, but it still won't let me include it with the partitioner
