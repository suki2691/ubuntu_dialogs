2011-06-21T21:23:00.000Z	chombee		Hey, can anyone tell me how to add an "administrator" user (with the same privileges as the first user that is created at install, ability to sudo etc) from the command-line? I've been searching but can't find. Presumably it's a case of creating a user and then adding him to the right groups?
