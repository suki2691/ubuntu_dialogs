I'm new to linux and ubuntu, and, when i try to run the 7.04 beta live cd, it shows the page where you can choose to install or run, test memory, etc.  When I click install or run, it just shows a black screen.  It still makes the startup noise, and i have the video cables hooked up to the mobo and the videocard (X1600PRO).  Do i need drivers or something?
