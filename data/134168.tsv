2007-07-08T09:04:00.000Z	mo0osah		it cannot even load up the live cd
2007-07-08T09:04:00.000Z	intelikey	mo0osah	very carefully.   it's not so fun as on well supported hardware.
2007-07-08T09:06:00.000Z	mo0osah	intelikey	It's weird how my notebook with ATI X300 works fine with everything (beryl, composite, etc...) and my roommate has ATI X1400 can't even load the live cd ....
