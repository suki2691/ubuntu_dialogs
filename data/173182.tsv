2007-10-24T10:08:00.000Z	vontux		hello, does anyone in here know how to install the 2.6.17-11-generic kernel for use as a bootable kernel when you have ubuntu 7.04 installed?
2007-10-24T10:09:00.000Z	vontux		is there a source to add to sources.lst to allow you to install older kernel images?
2007-10-24T10:10:00.000Z	dystopianray	vontux	why do you want an older kernel?
2007-10-24T10:10:00.000Z	vontux	dystopianray	because some of my hardware, mainly a gps unit won't work with the current kernel, but did on 2.6.17-11-generic
