2006-07-23T14:59:00.000Z	_Indy_		Greetings.
2006-07-23T14:59:00.000Z	_Indy_		I am using Ubuntu Linux 6.06 Dapper Drake. I am using a laptop and I use its capture in order to record sound. I can record sound and I can hear my voice normally. So, there are no problems with my input or output.
2006-07-23T14:59:00.000Z	_Indy_		But when I make a call with Skype, or others call me with Skype, I can't hear anything and they can't hear anything too. Even when I called echo123 I didn't hear anything. Can you help me please? Thank you in advance.
