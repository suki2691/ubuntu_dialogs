2010-06-28T05:51:00.000Z	wad		Hi folks. I just installed Ubuntu 10.04 server edition on a new box. It has no network yet (don't ask). The one thing that's blocking me right now is installing mdadm on this box. I know it's on the install CD somewhere, but uncommenting the cdrom source in /etc/apt/sources.list doesn't help; it tried to install, but says it can't find files. Ideas?
