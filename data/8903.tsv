2011-10-13T04:14:00.000Z	karma4ya		well 2.59 wouldnt load after doing upgrade but blender people told me try to run from a file off the desktop and that works perfect
2011-10-13T04:14:00.000Z	karma4ya		but it wont let me run the 2.49 that way it gives me a lib error
2011-10-13T04:15:00.000Z	karma4ya		i ideally would like to remove the blender svn and just go back to the blender that was in the ubuntu softwre center but its not there any more
2011-10-13T04:17:00.000Z	mindsystem	karma4ya	would you be able to run a make uninstall? i know some makefiles have that built in...
