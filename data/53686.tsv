With Linux, it's always possible to fix them. With proprietary operating systems, it isn't always possible.
2010-02-08T01:22:00.000Z	FoolishOwl	vilkas	there are a lot of specific applications you can only use on Windows. For a home user, mostly just games are what you'd worry about. There are open source applications for any category of application.
