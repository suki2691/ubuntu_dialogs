2010-06-27T22:33:00.000Z	Shadowknight		I'm trying to install ubuntu, but the livecd keeps locking up. It shows a graphic at the bottom of the page on boot, but then switches to a blinking white cursor. If I press f6 during boot, I get the menu but I cannot install the O/S, I get a page worth of text showing it's starting to boot, but it hangs.
2010-06-27T22:35:00.000Z	Shadowknight		I've used xforcevesa, and it hasn't helped. I've also made sure to set the BIOS for my Asus psc800 motherboard to compatbilitiy mode
2010-06-27T22:37:00.000Z	Shadowknight		tried noapic and nolapic as well, no success
