2009-11-05T14:09:00.000Z	testi_		I'd like to set resolution 1680x1050. KVM breaks EDID. How can I enforce this resolution?
2009-11-05T14:09:00.000Z	ikonia	testi_	kvm presents a virtual graphics card, it may not support that resolution
2009-11-05T14:10:00.000Z	testi_	ikonia	sorry KVM-switch not KVM virtualization software
2009-11-05T14:10:00.000Z	ikonia	testi_	ahhh, my mistake.
