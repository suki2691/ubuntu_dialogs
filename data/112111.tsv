2011-10-22T04:25:00.000Z	NetRunnerBlack		I'm trying to get Ubuntu to run and delete my other os (genuine windows XP) with only a flashdrive and a shitty Toshiba Satellite A205-S5000. I've put the .iso downloaded from the Ubuntu website on a flashdrive and got my PC to try and boot from the drive, but it said I had no OS on the drive, so I then unpacked the files with WinRAR onto the drive and tried again, only getting the same error
