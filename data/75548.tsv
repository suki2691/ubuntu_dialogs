2008-11-03T08:32:00.000Z	HeX_Vulture		Can anyone tell me if there is a way to prevent my USB logitech mouse from freezing? After starting Ubuntu it works for like 2 minutes then dies for no reason and I have to switch to a ps/2 mouse
2008-11-03T08:33:00.000Z	jrib	HeX_Vulture	check for anything interesting in /var/log/Xorg.0.log and dmesg
2008-11-03T08:37:00.000Z	HeX_Vulture	jrib	where would I find /var/log/Xorg.0.log at?
2008-11-03T08:37:00.000Z	jrib	HeX_Vulture	/var/log/Xorg.0.log is a path
