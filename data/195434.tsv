2006-11-21T06:54:00.000Z	snido		I have GeForce 6100 GPU and chipsets too. Will the geforce driver install drivers for all of that?
2006-11-21T06:55:00.000Z	kitche	snido	you would probably have to use the nforce drivers
2006-11-21T06:55:00.000Z	kitche	snido	both the line I said gets added to xorg.conf
