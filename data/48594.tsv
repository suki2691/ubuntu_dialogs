2009-09-13T19:20:00.000Z	nelu	Sidewinder1	unfortunately, after insatalling any of ubuntu, kubuntu, xubuntu, debian, i cannot successfully go into bios after i press F2 or F12. My hope was to solve the problem by soft. (Old hard, some $ would not merit the effort... ) Also after seeing the grub, i have no recognition of the laptop keyboard.. I'll maybe try to construct some live-CD, that will chhos the Linux or the other partition to boot from...
