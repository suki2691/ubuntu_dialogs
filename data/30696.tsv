2010-06-11T08:39:00.000Z	shadows090		cittadino: yeah wireshark would be MUCH easier lol
2010-06-11T08:41:00.000Z	shadows090		cittadino: that would probably be easiest. it's possible to set up a real internal proxy server via squid (connects between the host and switch/router) that does full logs, but that's quite a hassle
