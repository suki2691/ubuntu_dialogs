2009-02-05T15:15:00.000Z	ruediix		Hello, I'm back.  Does anyone know how to override the refusal of x64 Ubuntu to install i386-i686 packages.

2009-02-05T15:16:00.000Z	ruediix	Slart	Yes, always check that you have the compatability libraries installed.
2009-02-05T15:18:00.000Z	ruediix	Slart	they should make the compatability libraries package add i386 as a supported architecture.
