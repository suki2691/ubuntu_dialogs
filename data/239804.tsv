2006-04-10T11:45:00.000Z	nickrud	bluey	because it's not in the repos. Check out the codecs on http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
2006-04-10T11:46:00.000Z	nickrud	bluey	the ubotu link takes you straight to the codecs
2006-04-10T11:47:00.000Z	nickrud	bluey	if you add some unofficial repos you can apt-get the codecs, but you need to be cautious about that.
