2008-03-17T12:09:00.000Z	dishayu		i am unable to install bin files on my PC... ubuntu7.10... i made them executable by chmod and when i execute it with "./filename.bin"  it says no such file or directory...
2008-03-17T12:09:00.000Z	qzio	dishayu	chmod +x filename.bin
2008-03-17T12:09:00.000Z	dishayu	qzio	: did that already
2008-03-17T12:10:00.000Z	qzio	dishayu	then. ./path/to/file.bin should do it
