2012-02-04T18:10:00.000Z	Barbariandude		Hey guys. If I copy everything (root and upwards) to an external hard disk, then after wiping the disk/installing another OS/doing random stuff, could I put all that data back on the disk and do boot-repair to get it working again?

2012-02-04T18:12:00.000Z	Barbariandude	dr_willis	I'll look into imaging then, thanks
