2006-09-08T05:26:00.000Z	hodges		Okay, total linux newbie here with a question that is driving the crap outta me.  Been searching on the forum and getting so many options, i feel somewhat overwhelmed.  I have installed the AMD64 Ubuntu dapper drake version and am having some issues with flash and geting it to work.  I tried flash player 7 from adobes website and it says it does not support amd64.  How could i get flash player to work correctly with an AMD64, or, would you
2006-09-08T05:26:00.000Z	hodges		 NOT reccomend using AMD64 and just installing an x86 version?  Any help would be extremely amazing

2006-09-08T05:28:00.000Z	Kuprin	hodges	that's what I recommend if you want multimedia support right now. Wine is good for it though, if you wanted to you could run an amd64 set up and a lot of things in Wine...but you're still going to be very slow with 32-bit apps. x86 may be a lot faster for you. At least it's better than XP64? :p
