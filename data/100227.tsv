2008-06-24T05:33:00.000Z	kesi		hi all.   I am trying to dual-boot vista/ubuntu.  I have a 200 GB partition that I made during vista setup to use for ubuntu.  I am at the part of the install where it wants me to manually create partitions for ubunutu.  For the swap what do I choose for primary-logical beginning-end and mount point?  same question for the ext3 ubuntu partition?
