2006-12-03T07:22:00.000Z	asjha		anyone know what packages I need to install to get gksudo (or another gui sudo) working on a Dapper Server install that has had xwin and xfce installed
2006-12-03T07:24:00.000Z	asjha		is the message I get
2006-12-03T07:24:00.000Z	strabes	asjha	gksudo isn't a package
2006-12-03T07:24:00.000Z	strabes	asjha	you use gksudo instead of sudo when you want to run a graphical application with root powers
