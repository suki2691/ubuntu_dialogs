2007-12-18T07:57:00.000Z	[pablo]		why does the add/remove packages dialog in ubuntu 7.10 tell me that I can't install vmware-player because i386 architecture is not supported?
2007-12-18T07:58:00.000Z	Pelo	[pablo]	get it from the vmware website
2007-12-18T07:58:00.000Z	[pablo]	Pelo	i tried that, but I didn't see a deb adn the tar file has an installer script that assumes rcX style init system
2007-12-18T07:59:00.000Z	Pelo	[pablo]	very odd, try asking in the #vmware channel
