2011-05-04T22:49:00.000Z	OneKorea	ThinkT510	hm this means i need to use wubi installer or the 'real' full one can do as well? (to install ubuntu but save current Window's D: NTFS partrtition, ubuntu can read NTFS?)
2011-05-04T22:50:00.000Z	ThinkT510	OneKorea	yes, ubuntu reads and writes ntfs partitions on a full real install, it won't overwrite anything there
2011-05-04T22:52:00.000Z	ThinkT510	OneKorea	its an easy install process, the hardest part is partitioning, but that is simple when you know how
