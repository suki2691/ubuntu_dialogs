2009-11-14T21:05:00.000Z	banisterfiend	om26er	the problem is very strange -- high quality scaling filters for the libdevil1c2 package work perfectly in ubuntu, but do NOT work in the equivalent package in macosx. I am trying to understand why, so i thought i could locate exactly where the libdevil1c2 package comes from in ubuntu and compare its source to the macosx package or contact the ubuntu maintainers and ask if they secretly patched the source
