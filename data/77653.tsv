2009-03-06T17:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	danniz	should be fine, why are you upgrading?
2009-03-06T17:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	danniz	use the cli update and you'll be fine
2009-03-06T17:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	danniz	make sure you read stuff when its starts talking about overwriting conf files with the new version / keep old version
