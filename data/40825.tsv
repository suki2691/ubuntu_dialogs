2010-01-03T01:14:00.000Z	burzki	benomatic	maybe something to do w/ jack setup in the new install .. about all i can offer on this
2010-01-03T01:03:00.000Z	burzki	benomatic	likely drivers ..
2010-01-03T01:10:00.000Z	benomatic	burzki	i manually installed newest alsa, and have same problem... so my thinking was that it's likely some 'post install' type step.  only off the cd can i get audio, thus far.
2010-01-03T01:13:00.000Z	burzki	benomatic	not really my area, but i had problems on a different install with alsa conflicting jack ..
