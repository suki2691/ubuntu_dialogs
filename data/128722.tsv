2007-12-02T02:13:00.000Z	txoof		I'd like to install gnome (and X and all that comes with it), but I don't want to run the whole X login frontend.  I just need gnome for some vnc stuff that will be running off this box.  Is it possible to either avoid installing the login stuff (if so, what's it called?), and if not, can it be disabled?
2007-12-02T02:15:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	txoof	you can probably do a command-line only install (use the alternate CD) and just install gnome separately
2007-12-02T02:16:00.000Z	txoof	CoasterMaster	Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do.  I would like gnome and all the X deps, just not gdm.  I think I can probably weed that out though.
2007-12-02T02:16:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	txoof	yeah, I'm not sure exactly what packages you're going to need unfortunately
