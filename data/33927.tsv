2010-05-09T02:34:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	delac	i think you put a file named forcefsck on the filesystem you want checked... for exampled sudo touch /forcefsck
2010-05-09T02:36:00.000Z	delac	onetinsoldier	ok, I'll take a look about that. Thanks!
2010-05-09T02:36:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	delac	roger. you're welcome. but don't take my word for it! yep, look it up or something :-)
