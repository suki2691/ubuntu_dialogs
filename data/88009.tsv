2012-02-19T20:56:00.000Z	helo		should i be able to use unetbootin to put a ubuntu .iso onto a usb hard drive (not just a thumb drive) to do an install from?
2012-02-19T20:58:00.000Z	helo		i swapped motherboards and now jackd is broken, so i'm going to try reinstalling :/
2012-02-19T20:58:00.000Z	rly	helo	the notion of 'reinstalling' is a Windows concept.
2012-02-19T20:59:00.000Z	helo	rly	i've spent at least 4 hours trying to get jackd working again... it always works after an initial install
