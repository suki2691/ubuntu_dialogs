2006-11-03T13:57:00.000Z	dooglus		I'm trying to get php5 and apache2 working together, but when I visit a .php file, the server sends the file to me unprocessed.  what might I have done wrong?
2006-11-03T13:57:00.000Z	waddletron2k	dooglus	are you familiar with php5 and apache2
2006-11-03T13:58:00.000Z	dooglus	waddletron2k	nope.
2006-11-03T13:59:00.000Z	waddletron2k	dooglus	that is probably the root of the problem
