2012-01-31T02:13:00.000Z	module000	alaing_	if you are running dd-wrt on your newer device - you could tcpdump and/or iptraf and get a better idea of what isn't working the way you expect
2012-01-31T02:14:00.000Z	alaing_	module000	I'm still new to dd-wrt how do i run those commands?
2012-01-31T02:15:00.000Z	alaing_	module000	I setup my router so that my server has a static ip and tried port forwarding and using dmz and it will not work
