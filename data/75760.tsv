2008-11-08T20:18:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		Hey guys, I instaled Ubuntu 8.10 and for the first time in a year my WiFi hardware finally worked under it. But after I updated 8.10 it again no longer works, it claimes the WEP key is invalid
2008-11-08T20:19:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		I have a Toshiba Satellite A215-S7413 Laptop, it's wifi hardware is listed as a Realtek RTL8187B. However, it appears to internally be wired through the USB bus instead of the PCI bus since Vista's device manager has "USB 2.0" at the end of the device's name.
2008-11-08T20:19:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		Any ideas?
