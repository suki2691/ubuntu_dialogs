2009-12-15T22:37:00.000Z	elarson		is there a simple way to add other directories to the default path environ variable? this needs to happen before the user is logged in preferrably
2009-12-15T22:38:00.000Z	Jamed	elarson	you can edit $PATH /etc/environment
2009-12-15T22:38:00.000Z	elarson	Jamed	ah ok
2009-12-15T22:38:00.000Z	elarson	Jamed	I had tried /etc/profile and /etc/bash.bashrc but neither had a default to add to
