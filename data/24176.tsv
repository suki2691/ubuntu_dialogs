2011-05-02T20:45:00.000Z	DexterF		I set up 10.10 with encrypted home - basically for testing. now I need that box to auto-login a user and so that contradicts. question: how do I permanently decrypt that home?
2011-05-02T20:46:00.000Z	DexterF		(or *can* I have enc. home and auto-login? tho it's bogus)
2011-05-02T20:46:00.000Z	KM0201	DexterF	i don't think so.. (but you might be able to)..
