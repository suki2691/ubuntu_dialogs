2008-06-06T01:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	davidmccabe	You can change edgy to feisty in your /etc/apt/sources.list   then upgrade... see the following link
2008-06-06T01:30:00.000Z	davidmccabe	Jack_Sparrow	Thanks for the link, but a bunch of meetings would have to take place before I could do that, so I was looking for a stop-gap.
