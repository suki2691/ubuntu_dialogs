2005-12-10T09:46:00.000Z	theCore	logical_mark	like bluefish
2005-12-10T09:47:00.000Z	logical_mark	theCore	chorse: Isn't bluefish used for CODING the website. I just need something that I can draw out tables and such and it writes the html in the background
2005-12-10T09:48:00.000Z	theCore	logical_mark	then nvu would be the best
