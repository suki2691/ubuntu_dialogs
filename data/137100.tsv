2007-06-08T07:53:00.000Z	scoobydoo28139		Hello again, I have a system that has only 64mb of ram and a 500mhz amd. What would be a good distro to install?

2007-06-08T07:54:00.000Z	EADG_	scoobydoo28139	min ram for xubuntu is 96Mb iirc.
2007-06-08T07:55:00.000Z	EADG_	scoobydoo28139	Look up DSL (Dam Small Linux) that is your best bet for the hardware you have. DSL is about 50Mb d/l.
