2008-01-04T05:32:00.000Z	DrBroccoli		So I installed ubuntu, didn't like and decided to delete the partition it was on, now when I try to turn on my PC, I get a "GRUB load error 17" and it won't move on

2008-01-04T05:34:00.000Z	nickrud	DrBroccoli	I know very little about windows .... I use it for games and work but that's about it
2008-01-04T05:35:00.000Z	nickrud	DrBroccoli	you could try asking on ##windows
