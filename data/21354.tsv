2012-09-05T21:25:00.000Z	atrius		hello all... i've got a 12.10LTS server system which is refusing to boot... vgscan is timing out for some reason and therefore there is no root to mount
2012-09-05T21:25:00.000Z	atrius		huh... seems this channel is magic... now it is suddenly working?

2012-09-05T21:27:00.000Z	atrius	compdoc	nothing wrong with the disk.. i could easily vgchange -ay from busybox.. i think it has more to do with my somewhat unusual setup.. the machine in question is a 16 core OpenStack server
