2008-12-25T19:59:00.000Z	jim_p	jotil	sudo init 3
2008-12-25T20:00:00.000Z	jotil	jim_p	i know init 3 will help me do it manually. i want the system to start in runlevel 3. usually one is suppoed to edit /etc/inittab but ubuntu dosn't seem to have that
2008-12-25T20:02:00.000Z	jim_p	jotil	then you can boot in rescue mode
