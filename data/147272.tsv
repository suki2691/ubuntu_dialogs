2007-03-06T13:13:00.000Z	fossilz		i installed mrtg but messed it up.. it wouldnt "update" so i did a apt-get remove and deleted the mrtg.cfg etc...
2007-03-06T13:13:00.000Z	fossilz		now when i try to apt-get install it again it doesnt give new cfg files..
2007-03-06T13:14:00.000Z	fossilz		any ideas ?
