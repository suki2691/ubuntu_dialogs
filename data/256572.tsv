2011-12-31T19:06:00.000Z	mytardis		i am having trouble getting the indie bundle #3 to work. when I try and run the launcher in crayon physics it keeps giving file not found response
2011-12-31T19:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	mytardis	 try running it from the terminal, it may give some erorr messages. also ive had issues with that game in linux and in windows.. it just seems.. well  badly done.
2011-12-31T19:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	mytardis	 and the exact error is?
2011-12-31T19:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	mytardis	 you sure thats the proper name? use TAB key to get it spelt/completed properly
