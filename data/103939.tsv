2010-10-02T23:23:00.000Z	minorursa		I'm having trouble with a live 10.04 CD. CD is OK, but system is unable to mount filesystem.squashfs. Is this the right channel, or can someone provide the name of the right one?

2010-10-02T23:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	minorursa	did you press space when you saw the stickman screen and select "Check CD for defects"?
2010-10-02T23:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	minorursa	does your ram test out ok?
