2008-02-27T12:41:00.000Z	makaveli		hey guys, got a question about graphic drivers in ubuntu. right now i'm running hardy alpha 5 release, and so i'm waitin for the new envy release to get the latest nvidia drivers. now i'm running the default ones and i'm gettin high temps while i do anything. i assume this is normal and might get fixed when i install the proper drivers?
