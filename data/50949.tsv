2010-03-28T01:00:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	darolu	xubuntu eats less ram, as the gui is light
2010-03-28T01:04:00.000Z	darolu	arvind_khadri	XFCE is lighter than GNOME, yes; but Xubuntu shares too many common processes and daemons with Ubuntu, it basically is the same system just different Desktop Enviroment, it even uses gdm and some gnome-apps. You can try Slackware with XFCE, compare it to Xubuntu and you'll see what I mean.
2010-03-28T01:05:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	darolu	oh ok
