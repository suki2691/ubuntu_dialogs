2011-03-25T02:27:00.000Z	yang_		Hi all, I have a question on 32bit vs 64 bit. In the Ubuntu document, it recommends 64bit version, buy why the 32bit version is recommended in the download page?
2011-03-25T02:27:00.000Z	_pg_	yang_	how much ram do you have
2011-03-25T02:29:00.000Z	_pg_	yang_	go 64 bit
2011-03-25T02:32:00.000Z	yang_	_pg_	dfh: I am on 64bit now. thanks. i just wonder why they are inconsistent.
