2007-04-09T10:47:00.000Z	hammedhaaret		Hi, i still have a problem installing ubuntu.
2007-04-09T10:47:00.000Z	hammedhaaret		i can boot from the Cd but after choosing either start/install ubuntu my screen goes nuts and says "warning! input signal out of range".
2007-04-09T10:47:00.000Z	hammedhaaret		try to leave it there but nothing happened.    can anyone help me?
2007-04-09T10:48:00.000Z	rob__	hammedhaaret	the problem is a misconfiguration with probably the X server, i dont know how to fix it though..
