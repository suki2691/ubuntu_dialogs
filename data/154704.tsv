2007-06-10T16:44:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic		so I want to be able to run WoW with beryl running also.  I've got a Radeon 9800 Pro, which is an ATI card.  According to http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=344271 I need to have Direct rendering enabled, but when I $glxinfo | grep render it says I don't have Direct rendering enabled.  how can I enable it?  DRI in xorg.conf?
2007-06-10T16:45:00.000Z	n2diy	shnastybiznastic	can you tell edmon how to configure the 9800?
2007-06-10T16:47:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic	n2diy	sure, what's the problem, simple 2d rendering, or 3d stuff?
2007-06-10T16:47:00.000Z	n2diy	shnastybiznastic	not sure, he was asking for help with it, and nobody responded, edmon you still with us?
