2009-05-16T19:24:00.000Z	raven_	flintwingel	what would be the best raid level then? raid 0?
2009-05-16T19:25:00.000Z	flintwingel	raven_	raid0 is not really raid... there is no redundancy
2009-05-16T19:26:00.000Z	flintwingel	raven_	you could create 2 raid1 arrays - 200+200 from the 500 and 250+250 from the 500 - 450 total
