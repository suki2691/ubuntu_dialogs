2010-04-30T16:41:00.000Z	UbuntuLily		Hey the problem is I am in the desert right now and I don't have any blank cds or a removable hard drive.  For this I need a cd.  If there is a chance I will lose my home folder (I know what it is ;) cut me a little credit) than I will just wait until I can back it up

2010-04-30T16:43:00.000Z	dabaR	UbuntuLily	just wait
