2010-12-28T17:53:00.000Z	LuciusMare		Hello, I am now installing ubuntu, and at the "Who are you?" screen, the "Encrypt my home folder" checkbox is checked and greyed out, and I am already using an old /home partition - what is it going to do? Will it encrypt my data, or will it delete and replace them with an encrypted folder?

2010-12-28T17:54:00.000Z	LuciusMare	gobbe	nope
