2007-04-11T09:11:00.000Z	NBrepresent		hi, how can i check my boot log?
2007-04-11T09:11:00.000Z	dthacker	NBrepresent	sudo dmesg | more
2007-04-11T09:20:00.000Z	NBrepresent	dthacker	how do i downgrade to Edgy? i must have installed one too many unofficial packages, and i was forced to do a distribution upgrade. The weird thing was that it said it was upgrading to 6.10, but at the end of the upgrade, it said welcome to 7.04 Feisty
2007-04-11T09:21:00.000Z	dthacker	NBrepresent	I have never downgraded sorry.  I'm very conservative on packages
