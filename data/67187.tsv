2009-02-03T20:21:00.000Z	betterhands		hey guys...recently installed ubuntu and love it (windows hard drive dies and decided to be done with MS).  Installed ubuntu.  came here to get Banshee recommended to me as an app to work with my ipod (5th gen 30gb).  Banshee discovered my ipod and i was able to create my local library from it.  no problems.  then, added some albums to the library, attempt to sync.  Banshee shows while syncing that it's deleting all songs from the ipod. wtf?
