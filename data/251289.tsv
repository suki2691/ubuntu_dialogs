2007-08-14T13:02:00.000Z	DrDabbles		Vspike, I have seen a novell project written in mono that is supposed to allow you to manage several types of SQL server, including MSSQL. I have not, however, tried to compile or run it. There are also no debian packages for it as far as I know
2007-08-14T13:02:00.000Z	DrDabbles	fox2mike	do you know what graphics chipset you have? Perhaps an intel built-in chipset?
