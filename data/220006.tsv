2006-06-09T15:14:00.000Z	Michael		hi, If I installed compwiz and XGL, will other OpenGL applications (games etc.) be slowed down?
2006-06-09T15:14:00.000Z	Flannel	Michael	yes
2006-06-09T15:15:00.000Z	Michael	Flannel	so you wouldn't recommend it if i played games?
2006-06-09T15:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Michael	I honestly don't know how much of a slowdown it is, you might try asking in #ubuntu-xgl
