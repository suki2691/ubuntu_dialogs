2009-03-03T01:13:00.000Z	DasEI	eseven73	why force it ? dpkg -I *.deb; see man dpkg
2009-03-03T01:14:00.000Z	eseven73	DasEI	 was getting "Unmet dependencies" something or another errors when i was doing it graphically
2009-03-03T01:14:00.000Z	DasEI	eseven73	so you'd risk a unstable system by overriding it, which paket ?
