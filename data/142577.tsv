2007-09-25T12:16:00.000Z	Whitor		I'm looking to enable the cube-atlantis plugin... The info I've found on how to enable that feature simply says to install the Compiz-fusion-plugins-extra package. Well, I've done this but I still see no cube-atlantis plugin available in ccsm :(
2007-09-25T12:17:00.000Z	marx2k	Whitor	restart ccsm possibly?
2007-09-25T12:17:00.000Z	marx2k		or rather restart compiz?
2007-09-25T12:18:00.000Z	Whitor	marx2k	Nope... did a reboot to be safe
