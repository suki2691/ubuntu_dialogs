2008-01-26T05:21:00.000Z	Strangelet		SEVERE problem here, I was recently attempting to install Windows XP on a separate partition and it failed, some files could not be copied over. Now, an OS cannot be discovered upon boot, I am currently using a LiveCD session to communicate. What should I do?
2008-01-26T05:22:00.000Z	ompaul	Strangelet	did you have Ubuntu on the machine you were talking about?
2008-01-26T05:23:00.000Z	Strangelet	ompaul	Yes
2008-01-26T05:23:00.000Z	Strangelet	ompaul	Oh! I don't remember seeing GRUB load up earlier, this might help! :)
