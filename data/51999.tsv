2012-05-09T02:29:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	docid	I think they started that a *few* releases ago...
2012-05-09T02:29:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	docid	hmm, maybe it's only the latest then, let me check
2012-05-09T02:31:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	docid	hmm, my other 11.10 issue doesn't have either an xorg.conf or xorg.conf.d entry... weird
