2012-10-20T04:46:00.000Z	alazyworkaholic1		I have a radeon HD 4670. Will the Proprietary ATI Catalyst Driver work with this card on 12.10?
2012-10-20T04:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alazyworkaholic1	should do
2012-10-20T04:49:00.000Z	alazyworkaholic1	ActionParsnip	I read that ATI had dropped support for the HD4000 series in their latest driver. Is ubuntu 12.10 using an older version?
