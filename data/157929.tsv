2008-04-16T03:21:00.000Z	MrGnu		hi all, I asked about this last night, and I was not sure how to best choose.  I have a built an Intel Core 2 Duo with Dual SLI , two GEforce cards in SLI configuration , should I do 64 bit Feisty or stick with 32?
2008-04-16T03:22:00.000Z	Slart	MrGnu	how much memory?
2008-04-16T03:22:00.000Z	Slart	MrGnu	64bit for you then
2008-04-16T03:22:00.000Z	Slart	MrGnu	32bit only handles 3.x GB memory
