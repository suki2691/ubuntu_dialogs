2005-02-02T10:26:00.000Z	snowblink		Got amarok now. I've run the wizard, but it dies just after it starts looking for music. Any ideas?
2005-02-02T10:26:00.000Z	snowblink		looks like KDE app doesn't like to play in GNOME
2005-02-02T10:27:00.000Z	qcompson_	snowblink	you might want to fool around with the soundserver amarok uses
2005-02-02T10:30:00.000Z	snowblink	qcompson_	have got all the soundserver bits, but it crashes with kio errors
