2010-01-02T10:09:00.000Z	LJR	ray9na	what part of "grab window" was unclear??? o.O
2010-01-02T10:10:00.000Z	ray9na	LJR	Because normally, to move a window you grab the title bar!
2010-01-02T10:11:00.000Z	LJR	ray9na	ah, but you can just click them for that. When you hold a hotkey (mine is super) you can click anywhere.
