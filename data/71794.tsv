2009-03-10T01:54:00.000Z	eseven73	nibsa1242b	but switching distros over that is like throwing the baby out with the bath water, remove pulse if it's so problematic
2009-03-10T01:56:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	eseven73	think of it like this... I have 3 computers at my house to maintain that are all used by 3 different people... and another 3-4 used by relatives with Ubuntu. Every time pulse breaks I have to spend a day or two fixing some / all of those computer. If I stay with Ubuntu, that means every six months, I'll waste a week of my time fixing pulse. Its not worth it.
2009-03-10T02:01:00.000Z	eseven73	nibsa1242b	yeah I hear you, but, if we switch distros everytime something went bad,,, well...we'd never get anything done, On the contrary, Linux gives us this flexablilty and freedome to switch when ever we feel it's needed :)  (i gotta take this to #ubuntu-offtopic before the ops strike the !OT hammer on me) hehe :D
