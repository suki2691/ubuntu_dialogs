2006-03-19T10:16:00.000Z	Falstius		Is it worth it to upgrade to dapper (from Breezy) for my only desktop?  AKA, is it stable enough?
2006-03-19T10:17:00.000Z	Xenguy	Falstius	stick with stable; what justifies a risk currently?
2006-03-19T10:17:00.000Z	Falstius	Xenguy	that's what I was wondering, what would be worth it ;)
2006-03-19T10:18:00.000Z	Xenguy	Falstius	nothing, except bleeding-edge risk :-)  It's but a month (or 2) away
