2007-03-23T05:29:00.000Z	PirateHead	tuqann	1) find a network cable. 2) plug one end into your router. 3) plug the other end into your machine. 4) enjoy interwebs.
2007-03-23T05:30:00.000Z	PirateHead	tuqann	try what rambo3 suggests, or try downloading the gnome-network-manager and asking it to configure your ether LAN for you.
2007-03-23T05:31:00.000Z	PirateHead	tuqann	that might be a problem. Try rambo3's suggeswtion: remove auto from wireless in /etc/network/interfaces
