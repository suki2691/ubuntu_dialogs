2006-10-16T09:51:00.000Z	Shakezula		Hey I have two PPC machines. An iMac with a broken cdrom drive and a Blue and White G3 with a working CDROM drive if I were to take the hard disk out of the iMac and put it in the G3, install Ubuntu, then put the hard disk back in the iMac can I expect it to work?

2006-10-16T09:52:00.000Z	Shakezula	sethk	I can fix the X stuff it's the hard disk cables I'm worried about.
2006-10-16T09:53:00.000Z	sethk	Shakezula	if the disk designations are different, that's equally easy to fix, as long as you can boot a live cd and mount the file system.
