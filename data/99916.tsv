2008-08-06T06:38:00.000Z	f190		hello, i am considering buying a new laptop from hp, and was wondering if there is a way to see if the parts are all linux compatible. the laptop is known as "dv2911us"
2008-08-06T06:39:00.000Z	f190		how would i make sure everything will be functional?

2008-08-06T06:39:00.000Z	f190	FAJALOU	i don't have the laptop. are you saying that i go into a store that has it and test it there somehow?
