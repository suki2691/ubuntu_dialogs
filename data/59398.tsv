2009-06-03T10:36:00.000Z	anr78		how can I prevent Ubuntu from trying to start the applications I used before I booted/logged out? I have unchecked "remember running applications", but it still launches stuff
2009-06-03T10:36:00.000Z	indus	anr78	ya even i have that problem
2009-06-03T10:37:00.000Z	anr78	indus	could it be some state that's stuck from when it was enabled? maybe some configfile we could clear..
2009-06-03T10:37:00.000Z	indus	anr78	its a bug iam sure
