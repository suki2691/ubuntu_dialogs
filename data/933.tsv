2012-11-14T02:25:00.000Z	k1l	cje2	that issue woul suit better in #ubuntu-offtopic . or the locochannel from SF
2012-11-14T02:27:00.000Z	cje2	k1l	thanks for the tip. I put it here because all we use in the public schools we support is Ubuntu.  It is quite exciting, so I thought that ppl here might be stoked to learn that Ubuntu is making it into public schools
