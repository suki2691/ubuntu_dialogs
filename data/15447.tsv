2012-05-03T04:26:00.000Z	escott	Vuth	ext4 is not necessary for small drives
2012-05-03T04:27:00.000Z	escott	Vuth	in general terms ext3=ext3+journal and ext4=ext3+extents (efficient storage of large files)
2012-05-03T04:27:00.000Z	escott	Vuth	so /boot has no real advantage to being ext3 or ext4 because you (a) cant recover it because you havent booted and (b) you have no large files
