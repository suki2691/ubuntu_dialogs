2007-05-03T07:40:00.000Z	jonah		hi can anyone port a linux app http://www.bellz.org/treeline/   to native mac osx somehow, i know it's cheeky asking as i don't have any money to pay anyone but thought it was worth asking. it's a great app and would be very useful on mac as is already on linux and windows. someone wrote a .app of it that wouldnt work and also i've tried to compile it from source and run  it on mac but can't get it to work....

2007-05-03T07:41:00.000Z	jonah	variant	sorry man. i use ubuntu with treeline and just looking for a cross os solution, didnt mean to offend
