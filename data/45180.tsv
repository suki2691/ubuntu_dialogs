2010-08-02T21:02:00.000Z	duiu	thune3	thanks, but could you clarify if I'm editing /etc/init/smbd.conf should this line have parentheses or not? Line is as follows: start on (local-filesystems and stopped rc)
2010-08-02T21:10:00.000Z	thune3	duiu	looks like it should have parens: http://launchpadlibrarian.net/50822127/smb.conf.diff
