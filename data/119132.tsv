2011-06-17T18:49:00.000Z	JoFo		Hello everybody.
2011-06-17T18:49:00.000Z	JoFo		I wonder whether gucharmap (Ubuntu’s default character map in the version with Gnome) has been updated to support the new Unicode 6.0 characters.
2011-06-17T18:49:00.000Z	JoFo		If that’s so, would it be possible to easily update gucharmap while remaining on Maverick ?
