2009-04-18T01:03:00.000Z	Slart	genii-around	do you know if there will be some other way of configuring the stuff that used to be in xorg.conf?
2009-04-18T01:10:00.000Z	genii-around	Slart	I imagine changes would have to made by specifying driver module arguments in modprobe.d or /etc/modules so
2009-04-18T01:11:00.000Z	Slart	genii-around	hmm.. well.. I suppose one will get used to that too. thanks
