2007-08-30T08:26:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	Okayasu	i am on comcast and yes it sucks, but there is no fix yet
2007-08-30T08:27:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	Okayasu	just have to tough it out, and hopefully there will be fixes in the next version of torrent clients
2007-08-30T08:27:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	Okayasu	technically it works, but it also sends the RST packets to your partner, so they'd need to know to drop them too
