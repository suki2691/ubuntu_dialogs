2009-06-30T07:37:00.000Z	edbian	ziroday	Boot a live CD from an ISO (without burning a CD) .  That's what unetbootin does.  ryanprior is that what you want?
2009-06-30T07:37:00.000Z	ziroday	edbian	he doesn't want to use a flash drive either. Plus its frugal install does what wubi does, just badly
2009-06-30T07:38:00.000Z	edbian	ziroday	???  What are you talking about?  unetbootin works without a flash drive.  unetbootin does NOT do what wubi does.
