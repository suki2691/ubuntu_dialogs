2008-03-04T08:53:00.000Z	Fryguy--	lolwutpear	it'll be in /media somewhere (probably /media/cdrom)
2008-03-04T08:53:00.000Z	Fryguy--	lolwutpear	you'll probably have to either mount it, or make nautilus do it for you by navigating to "computer" and then double clicking on the appropriate drive
2008-03-04T08:54:00.000Z	Fryguy--	lolwutpear	like i said, you'll either have to mount it, or have nautilus do it for you (see previous statement)
