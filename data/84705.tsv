2010-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	Sylvester_Ink		Hey, I have a quick question for a noob
2010-01-01T05:30:00.000Z	Sylvester_Ink		Buddy of mine is running Ubuntu and he got a new monitor.  It's not set up for the correct resolution
2010-01-01T05:31:00.000Z	Sylvester_Ink		What's the best way to set the resolution for a higher setting
2010-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	jtaji	Sylvester_Ink	did you try System > Prefs > Display ?
