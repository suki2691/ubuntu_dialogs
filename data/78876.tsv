2008-10-25T08:33:00.000Z	Gnuyen		anyone know how to disable fsck on boot?
2008-10-25T08:34:00.000Z	csilk	Gnuyen	 it should only happen every 30 boots or so
2008-10-25T08:34:00.000Z	Gnuyen	csilk	I know, but because I have encrypted partitions it fails and stops the boot on my server
2008-10-25T08:35:00.000Z	csilk	Gnuyen	 ahh rite, I'm pretty sure fsck has some option like "still boot on fail" not sure how to do it though
