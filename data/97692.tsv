2008-04-20T11:58:00.000Z	gh_		i cant extract them or install them, and its not letting me open it with the terminal, its like its not recognizing tar.gz or .rpm files
2008-04-20T11:59:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	gh_	you need .deb to install
2008-04-20T11:59:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	gh_	you can compile from a source i.e .tar
