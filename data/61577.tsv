2010-02-14T08:30:00.000Z	here4thegear		does anyone have some advice about installing pear packages (php pear)... I keep getting errors while trying to install using sudo pear install <packagename>
2010-02-14T08:31:00.000Z	ssmy	here4thegear	pear has never been anything but trouble for me. are you sure the package isn't just packaged in the repos? much easier.
2010-02-14T08:32:00.000Z	here4thegear	ssmy	how can I check that.. pear is one thing that is fairly new to me
2010-02-14T08:34:00.000Z	here4thegear	ssmy	even this gives me nothing but errors "pear download-all" error after error... nothing downloading
