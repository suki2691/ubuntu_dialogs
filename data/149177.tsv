2007-01-22T06:30:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	romedog	i would have thought apache2, i've never had any problems with its stability or anything, which presumably is your concern?
2007-01-22T06:32:00.000Z	romedog	CookedGryphon	I have been trying to install apache with gallery2 and I am having a problem with the php module not getting installed with mysql
2007-01-22T06:38:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	romedog	in which case i'm not sure what to advise having never played with gallery, have you asked in #gallery-support ?
