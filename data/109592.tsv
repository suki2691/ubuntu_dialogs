2007-12-27T16:57:00.000Z	rhetoric		Hi I'm having a very strange problem my Audiophile 2496 card is recognized and "Test" works under Prefs->Sound but no sound works in any application (Gutsy intel) anyone?
2007-12-27T16:59:00.000Z	etfb	rhetoric	I had similar probs in Edgy and solved it by explicitly selecting the appropriate sound driver in each program, or something.  It was ages ago, so I don't know the details, but the gist of it is that some software guesses the wrong thing when it comes to communicating with Linux's sound system.
2007-12-27T17:00:00.000Z	rhetoric	etfb	how did you explicitly select the driver?
2007-12-27T17:01:00.000Z	etfb	rhetoric	Oh gods, this was ages ago.  In some programs it's an option in preferences.  But I don't know if it really matches your problem.  I second what bullgard4 wrote.
