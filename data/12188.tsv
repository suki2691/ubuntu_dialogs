2012-02-10T04:06:00.000Z	bgs2		anyone got any experience with old (~1992) X Windows games and trying to sort out their dependencies and get them to run on 11.10?  I guess that's a good succinct way to phrase my problem.
2012-02-10T04:07:00.000Z	bgs2		okay, thanks

2012-02-10T04:08:00.000Z	zykotick9	bgs2	11.10 is supported here, not in #ubuntu+1 (that's for 12.04)
