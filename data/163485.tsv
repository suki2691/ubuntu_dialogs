2006-12-09T12:23:00.000Z	conreyt		anyone help me with gnomebaker? I installed it a min ago and I'm getting odd errors trying to burn dvd's.  CDs work fine.  error Here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/36086/
2006-12-09T12:24:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	conreyt	are you using dvdram for a drive that can only write dvd-r, or using dvd-r for a drive that can only write dvd+r?
2006-12-09T12:27:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	conreyt	try k3b instead of gnomebaker. make sure you a re using good branded dvd-r:s, make sure the brand of disc and writer are compatible
2006-12-09T12:28:00.000Z	conreyt	nolimitsoya	it's not a hw issue, I'd rather try to fix it rather than load up a different package to work around it.
