2010-01-12T03:04:00.000Z	lysek		hey, i have a question i have installed ubuntu on a drive with windows xp, i have chosen to not choose partitions so it will install it next to windows, i thought it will take the free space after the windows partition, but ubuntu has 60GB and free space was only 26 GB o.O, what that means?
