2006-11-02T15:55:00.000Z	KirikaPhoenix		No chance any could give me a hand with a problem? I can't seem to get the 2.6 kernel source no matter what im trying....
2006-11-02T15:56:00.000Z	KirikaPhoenix		Cpl -i've tried everything I can think. I'm updated the repositories as listed but its still insists that the latest kernel-source avaliable is 2.4
2006-11-02T15:56:00.000Z	KirikaPhoenix		For the life of me I can't get it to find the 2.6 source
