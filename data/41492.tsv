2009-12-01T22:52:00.000Z	cmacnau		 Hello, I'm trying to add an entry to the bootloader for Fedora 12 in 9.10.  Anyone have any experience with this?  I'm not well acquainted with grub2

2009-12-01T22:54:00.000Z	cmacnau	mezquitale	 is the syntax the same?
2009-12-01T22:55:00.000Z	mezquitale	cmacnau	I think the syntax is the same except you have to remember the partitions start being counted at 1, not 0 but maybe trism can help you on that one
