2009-09-15T23:50:00.000Z	antikap		is the ext4 file system as secure as NTFS?
2009-09-15T23:51:00.000Z	johnT	antikap	what do you mean for 'secure'?
2009-09-15T23:53:00.000Z	johnT	antikap	ext4 makes more intensive use of cache, so it might be 'less' secure in that way. I never had problems with ext4 tough, I suffered a lot of power outages here and didn't lose any data. IMHO you can use ext3 is you are really concerned
