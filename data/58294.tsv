2010-01-07T19:07:00.000Z	Dunge		I'm trying to build something, and it seems I got a broken lib in my libtool (I did a lot of not-standard builds tricks before today)... where does libtool know what are the .la files it should check? Is there a file with the list somewhere?
2010-01-07T19:09:00.000Z	Floid	Dunge	 Google "libtool search path"?
2010-01-07T19:11:00.000Z	Floid		If you have a "router" that usually includes a PPPoE client, is I think what you're saying the confusion is.
2010-01-07T19:12:00.000Z	Dunge	Floid	: google it and see, no answer there :P
