2009-02-21T21:06:00.000Z	dio444		Hi, I've somehow managed to break my gsudo. sudo from the shell still works, but from the gui, it says I don't have permission to modify system files. Any ideas about how to fix it?

2009-02-21T21:09:00.000Z	Izinucs	dio444	what are you tring to use it on?
2009-02-21T21:14:00.000Z	Izinucs	dio444	weird.. I looked in synaptic for gksudo and didn't come up with anything.. looking for sudo I came up with kdesudo .. the kde equivelent of gksudo.. sorry I'm not sure how gksudo is implemented in gnome..
