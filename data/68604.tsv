2011-11-28T15:08:00.000Z	freakynl		hi, having an issue with 11.04 live. On most computers it runs just fine, but now I have one where I see a gdm logon prompt (it should automatically log on) with an automatic login thingy, but clicking that immediately returns me to the logon prompt again
2011-11-28T15:08:00.000Z	freakynl		any way to bypass it? Just need to secure some files on the computer before reinstalling it
2011-11-28T15:09:00.000Z	freakynl		I don't know, looks like gdm, dunno plymouth tho'
