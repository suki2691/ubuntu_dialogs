2011-10-21T23:58:00.000Z	horse		hello all, i have a quick question
2011-10-21T23:59:00.000Z	horse		if i abort a download with apt-get (package with much small files) and restart it later, it wont reload all the files i allready have?
2011-10-21T23:59:00.000Z	horse		thing is, im on a very limited line here
