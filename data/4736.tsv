2012-03-17T16:39:00.000Z	cnttucme		i would love some help with the apt commands i read online that there is a command to install packaged or dependencies. I tried installing a calculator and it kept saying i needed other packages.  those packages needed other ones, and so on. Is there any cleaver shortcut?
