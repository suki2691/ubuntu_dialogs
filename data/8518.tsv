2011-12-01T06:57:00.000Z	usalabs	blawiz	in the package manager, there is a package called 'Test drive an Ubuntu ISO'
2011-12-01T06:58:00.000Z	blawiz	usalabs	i want newer versions of apps, some anyways
2011-12-01T06:59:00.000Z	usalabs	blawiz	some of the newer apps for versions high than Lucid maynot work, because of newer dependencies
