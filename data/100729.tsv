2008-02-14T02:56:00.000Z	feysalus		I'm using gutsy gibbon on a laptop with an intel pentium M processor, how do I control the CPU mhz, I have a 1.86ghz proc. and the CPU freq applet on the taskbar is showing 1.60ghz, how can I adjust it?
2008-02-14T02:57:00.000Z	feysalus		ok, but it would be nice if I could adjust it myself
