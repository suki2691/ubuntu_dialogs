2008-11-06T10:23:00.000Z	Necrogami	elpargo	not having to type in all the commands into the grub prompt myself...
2008-11-06T10:25:00.000Z	elpargo	Necrogami	if you know what you are doing the file is /boot/grub/menu.lst then you need to reinstall grub
2008-11-06T10:30:00.000Z	elpargo	Necrogami	yea also $ sudo grub-install, but that doesn't works all the time.
