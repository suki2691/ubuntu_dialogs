2009-07-10T23:53:00.000Z	maxo		I'm having huge memory issues with ubuntu. It keeps just slowing down to a halt, then I can't even move the mouse cursor, the screen freezes up and I have to press the computer's power button to switch it off. I never had this problem with previous ubuntu versions. Is there any way of fixing this or will I just have to switch back to Windows?

2009-07-10T23:57:00.000Z	noiz777	maxo	really? oh that is so disapointing...i am running the nettop remix on my msi and seem to have no problem at all, but on the virtual machine it just dies...kubuntu 9.04 didnt have this problem on me
