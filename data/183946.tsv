2008-05-27T06:41:00.000Z	nickrud	tat_	why not just use the nvidia provided with ubuntu, I think it's still the latest version
2008-05-27T06:41:00.000Z	tat_	nickrud	: is that an dpkg package ?
2008-05-27T06:42:00.000Z	nickrud	tat_	yes, if you go to system->admin->hardware drivers, it'll install them for you
