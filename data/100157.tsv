2008-03-19T05:34:00.000Z	Pawbie	pros977	Ya, and so do all the XP users, and Mac's still believe there's no malware for their platform.  Who cares? ;)
2008-03-19T05:36:00.000Z	pros977	Pawbie	So, what you're saying is that if everyone used root, more exploits would be developed and Linux as a whole would be less safe?
2008-03-19T05:37:00.000Z	Pawbie	pros977	Uh, no?  If you read some of the trends, Linux is actually the number 1 exploited plat for services.  More Apache sites get pounded than IIS.
