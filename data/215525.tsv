2007-01-23T07:44:00.000Z	fluvvell	soundray	whenever I've played with settings manually in interfaces, network manager seems to ignore them
2007-01-23T07:45:00.000Z	soundray	fluvvell	any time an interface goes up, all scripts in /etc/network/if-up.d/ get executed. Nothing to do with /etc/network/interfaces
2007-01-23T07:46:00.000Z	fluvvell	soundray	thanks
