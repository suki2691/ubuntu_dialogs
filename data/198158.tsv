2007-04-26T14:23:00.000Z	predaeus	Combatjuan	I've heard here that it is recommended to do distribution upgrades with the update manager and not with apt-get dist-upgrade as this might lead to complications. I've upgraded with apt-get in the past, so you might take the risk. But it is not recommended for people who don't know what they are doing.
