2005-06-12T07:12:00.000Z	JoshYme1		I just got ubuntu up and running and it never asked for a root password - what does it default to??
2005-06-12T07:12:00.000Z	JoshYme1		sudo??
2005-06-12T07:13:00.000Z	KragenSitaker	JoshYme1	you don't normally use root's password in ubuntu
2005-06-12T07:13:00.000Z	KragenSitaker	JoshYme1	instead you have some users who have the authority to sudo things as root
