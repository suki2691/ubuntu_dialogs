2010-08-14T12:26:00.000Z	Kurusu		I want to uninstall vim-tiny and install a full version of vim on Ubuntu 8.10, but when I use Synaptic to try and remove vim-tiny and vim-common (the only two packages with vim in their name that are currently installed), it also requires me to uninstall ubuntu-minimal.  Is that safe?
2010-08-14T12:28:00.000Z	shirtless	Kurusu	just apt-get install vim-full, and it will ask you if you want to fix that issue when you install it.
2010-08-14T12:29:00.000Z	shirtless		or vim-gnome.
2010-08-14T12:29:00.000Z	Kurusu	shirtless	Okay, I'll give that a shot
