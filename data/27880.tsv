2010-12-19T05:44:00.000Z	sparrW		I need to make files on a machine with an ubuntu live cd available over the network to another computer. Without an internet connection, there seems to not be a SMB or FTP server on the live cd. Are there other options?

2010-12-19T05:47:00.000Z	dnivra	sparrW	not even on the other computer?
