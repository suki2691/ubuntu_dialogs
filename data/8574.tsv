2011-10-19T05:42:00.000Z	unc0nnected		hmm, boot sequence hangs but if I alt-f1 and run sudo service gdm start gnome starts up.. any ideas?
2011-10-19T05:43:00.000Z	semitones	unc0nnected	try booting without 'qquiet splash' in grub and see if it says anything
2011-10-19T05:44:00.000Z	unc0nnected	semitones	I'll try that right now.. will that show me more info then when I press escape during the boot sequence to show me line by line of what's going on?
