2008-05-27T17:19:00.000Z	Escaper		Again, can anyone point me to some good dvd extractor/shrinker? I am using Ubuntu -gnome...
2008-05-27T17:20:00.000Z	Escaper		Thanks Dr_willis and ubottu... However, is there something that is not KDE?
2008-05-27T17:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Escaper	 ubottu  is a bot. and i have no idea. i dont worry about if its kde or not. I mixx and match kde and gnome apps all the time.  Im not even sure that k9copy is a 'kde' app. :) ive not used it in ages
