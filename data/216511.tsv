2010-01-12T11:55:00.000Z	Spectral_		Hi, i have recently done a new install of the latest ubuntu and it won't display the desktop. I can switch to consoles using cntrl+alt+# but the desktop (cntrl+alt_f7) gives me an "out of range" message.
2010-01-12T11:56:00.000Z	Spectral_		anyone got any ideas of how i can fix?
2010-01-12T11:57:00.000Z	Spectral_		ok, what is the best way to go about this? I'm fairly new to linux still
