2012-08-27T22:25:00.000Z	Lorra		Hi everybody! I'm developing a small website using xml and I wondered if anybody could give me some suggestions to make up my mind on whether I XSLT transformations should be performed on the client or on the server. Anyone ( : ?

2012-08-27T22:26:00.000Z	Lorra	fidel	I could ask an xslt-spefic channel, but I guess it wouldn't be as active as this one, that's why I'm asking here
2012-08-27T22:27:00.000Z	fidel	Lorra	now read the channels topic again and ask yourself if its clever to ask inhere - as channels have topics - and try to stay on them ;)
