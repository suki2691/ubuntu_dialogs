2008-02-12T07:02:00.000Z	_Oz_		can you really do work with it?
2008-02-12T07:02:00.000Z	Hajuu	_Oz_	sure, its equal to photoshop or better
2008-02-12T07:04:00.000Z	Hajuu	_Oz_	Personally, I HATE photoshop and I (as a graphic designer) fail to see how it became the industry standard except by them saying so.
