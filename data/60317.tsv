2011-04-28T08:47:00.000Z	renancoelho		Hi there, ubuntu was taking unusually longer to load and I did a reset, right before the computer turned of I saw that the ubuntu screen came up, therefore everything was fine. However, after restarting it, it goes straight into bash.
2011-04-28T08:47:00.000Z	renancoelho		Any suggestion?
