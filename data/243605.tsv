2006-06-06T10:09:00.000Z	TheStonepedo		i figured out that the ~/ folder was very handy.  it was much easier to backup before installing when everything was in my home directory
2006-06-06T10:10:00.000Z	TheStonepedo		would anyone recommend a tutorial on how to use tar and bzip for command line compression?
