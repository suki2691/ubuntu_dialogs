2007-12-10T21:03:00.000Z	benzs_s		i'm having massive trouble using the gutsy live cd to do a fresh install... afterloading the kernel and what have you, it's just saying 'User not known to the underlying authentication module'
2007-12-10T21:04:00.000Z	MasterShrek_	benzs_s	have you checked the cd for defects?
2007-12-10T21:05:00.000Z	MasterShrek_	benzs_s	how new is the hardware?
2007-12-10T21:05:00.000Z	benzs_s	MasterShrek_	fairly old, about 2 years. it worked fine and installed fine with feisty though. i'll do a cd check just in case
