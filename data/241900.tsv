2007-08-03T09:07:00.000Z	hortian		hey, I'm trying to run an install from a cd, and it seems like I don't have execute permission on the cd ... I tried to edit mtab, but whenever I put the cd in ubuntu appears to add a new line to /etc/mtab to ensure that the cd is loaded read only
2007-08-03T09:08:00.000Z	hortian		any ideas how to fix this?
2007-08-03T09:09:00.000Z	hortian		and it doesn't work
