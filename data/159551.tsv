2007-06-29T09:19:00.000Z	SlimG		Is it necessary to install realplayer when I've got w32codecs and libxine-extracodecs? If yes: Is there a way to avoid installing realplayer and be able to play realplayer files?
2007-06-29T09:19:00.000Z	stefg	SlimG	mplayer with w32codecs plays most realplayer stuff
2007-06-29T09:20:00.000Z	SlimG	stefg	Is the realplayer within the w32codecs pack? or in the mplayer package?
2007-06-29T09:21:00.000Z	stefg	SlimG	the real 9 codecs come with w32codecs
