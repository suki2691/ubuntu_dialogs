2010-04-10T20:58:00.000Z	abu1230		hi I want to back from ubuntu 10.04 to 9.10 what I do
2010-04-10T20:59:00.000Z	h00k	abu1230	you'll have to reinstall 9.10
2010-04-10T20:59:00.000Z	h00k	abu1230	there's no 'rollback'
2010-04-10T21:00:00.000Z	h00k	abu1230	if your /home is on a separate partition, sure
