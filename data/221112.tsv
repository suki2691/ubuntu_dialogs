2005-12-30T12:11:00.000Z	cmatheson	johndarkhorse	well... almost.  it won't work at all for any older cards (non-vesa compliant)--vga is a safer bet generally
2005-12-30T12:12:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	cmatheson	i've never owned a nonVESA compliant card (and i've had puters for a long long time)
2005-12-30T12:13:00.000Z	cmatheson	johndarkhorse	i otoh have only two vesa-compliant cards (my voodoo and geforce)
