2007-03-26T06:39:00.000Z	rinman		Hi, I'm having problems with installing MySQL 4.1 after having uninstalled MySQL 5.1, can anyone help me?
2007-03-26T06:40:00.000Z	babo	rinman	try #mysql
2007-03-26T06:41:00.000Z	rinman	babo	but i install it with apt-get and get the error while unpacking (it seems), so seems to me like a ubuntu related error rather than a mysql error
2007-03-26T06:41:00.000Z	babo	rinman	depends on what the error is i suppose. If it's a package problem then you might try to compile it ...
