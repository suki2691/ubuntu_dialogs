2005-11-15T07:58:00.000Z	foobar		Does anyone know why my inetd.conf file would be empty (as in, 0kb)?
2005-11-15T07:58:00.000Z	foobar		 then how would I close unneeded ports? =/
2005-11-15T07:59:00.000Z	SEJeff	foobar	Ubuntu has a policy of 0 open ports by default. If you don't believe the ububuntu devs, install firestarter from apt
2005-11-15T08:00:00.000Z	foobar	SEJeff	yea I installed firestarter, but when i nmap myself im getting open ports... am I missing something here.. =/
