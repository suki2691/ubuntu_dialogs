2007-01-22T15:57:00.000Z	i687		or will the security updates fo edgy stop when the new ubuntu version is released?
2007-01-22T15:57:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	i687	Security updates will continue
2007-01-22T15:58:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	i687	I forgot for how long, but it is definitely past the next release.
