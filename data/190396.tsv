2007-05-26T05:15:00.000Z	dnite		does anyone know where i can get a package or repo for pidgin 2.0.1 ?? Will gaim ever be updated officially to pidgin in feisty?

2007-05-26T05:16:00.000Z	lufis	dnite	feisty's repos are frozen except for security/bug fixes... pidgin will not be available in ubuntu's official repos until the next distro release
2007-05-26T05:16:00.000Z	lufis	dnite	but if you're so inclined you could compile it yourself, or more conveniently find a backport
