2005-01-10T06:23:00.000Z	defendguin		i like ubuntu i want to use it but i cant justify having to reboot twice before i am able to use it  especially on a laptop
2005-01-10T06:24:00.000Z	defendguin		i dont think it was on the hotplug
2005-01-10T06:24:00.000Z	julius_trop	defendguin	i get errors at hotplug sometimes
