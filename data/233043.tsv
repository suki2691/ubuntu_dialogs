2010-06-28T20:39:00.000Z	anigma		so I'm trying to copy some stuff from my internal hard drive through a Live CD to an external drive. I can see both of the drives on my desktop. I open a terminal and start typing "sudo cp /media/mydrive/Documents/ /media/otherdrive/anigma/Documents/" -- but then I just get cp: omitting directory Â´Documents/'
2010-06-28T20:39:00.000Z	anigma		what's up with that?
2010-06-28T20:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	anigma	to copy dirs you need -r
2010-06-30T02:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	anigma	why not
