2009-04-22T08:17:00.000Z	manpoole		x2 64 bit 5000 amd with 2 gigs of ram should i give 64 bit ubuntu a try?
2009-04-22T08:18:00.000Z	pc	manpoole	why not?  (running that here, btw)
2009-04-22T08:18:00.000Z	pc	manpoole	I didn't do a 32bit install to compare
2009-04-22T08:19:00.000Z	pc	manpoole	but I do a fair amount of video, so thought 64bit might be the best place to start
