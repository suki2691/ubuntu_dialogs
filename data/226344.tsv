2007-04-22T16:03:00.000Z	Gigi		Hi!  It is a problem to enable a restricted driver (I enabled my nvida 256mbs but nothing wrong happened)
2007-04-22T16:04:00.000Z	bjv	Gigi	restricted means that the intellectual property & the code to make the device work is not open-source
2007-04-22T16:04:00.000Z	bjv	Gigi	not that you are restricted from using it. on the contrary, Nvidia makes the closed-drivers available *for* you to use
2007-04-22T16:05:00.000Z	bjv	Gigi	the name of the package is 'beryl'   apt-get install beryl would get the basics, check around on the ubuntu web pages for more
