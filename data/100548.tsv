2008-03-24T06:02:00.000Z	AnthraxDream		Can anyone tell me why my NTFS drive is no longer showing up on ubuntu but it shows up on vista?
2008-03-24T06:02:00.000Z	AnthraxDream		Where can I find that?
2008-03-24T06:03:00.000Z	prince_jammys	AnthraxDream	check the output of: grep ntfs /etc/fstab
2008-03-24T06:03:00.000Z	prince_jammys	AnthraxDream	and you will see the line, if it's there
