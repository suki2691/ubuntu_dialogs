2006-05-27T13:36:00.000Z	fooker		Hey all. Trying to help someone install Ubuntu long-distance, and they are saying that ubuntu has no console installer? Is this true?
2006-05-27T13:37:00.000Z	fooker		Sorry, should have been clearer - command line based. Doesn't require X to be running
2006-05-27T13:38:00.000Z	gnomefreak	fooker	the install cd has that
2006-05-27T13:38:00.000Z	gnomefreak	fooker	what version of ubuntu first off?
