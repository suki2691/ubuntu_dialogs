2009-11-07T18:56:00.000Z	Milos_SD		why Karmic still has usplash when it was sad that it will be replaced by xsplash  (from grub to gdm)?
2009-11-07T18:56:00.000Z	xangua	Milos_SD	maybe you didn't update properly
2009-11-07T18:58:00.000Z	Milos_SD	xangua	I didn't installed Karmic, but on every video I could see, there is first that white ubuntu logo (usplash), and after some time, xsplash takes over...
