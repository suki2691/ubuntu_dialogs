2011-04-02T20:26:00.000Z	mynamedave		im setting up an Ubuntu system for a 82 year old guy who used to use Outlook. I dont know what he did there, but he says he has no mail in Evolution and forgets to click SEND/RECEIVE button
2011-04-02T20:26:00.000Z	mynamedave		after he clicks SEND/RECEIVE he surely gets his mail :)
