2005-03-04T13:12:00.000Z	vi11e	png	I have the same error but I just skip that
2005-03-04T13:14:00.000Z	vi11e	png	maybe that doesn't exists in hoary, and the guide is referring to warty where that directory exists,... that's my guess only
2005-03-04T13:15:00.000Z	vi11e	png	you can keep asking that if you want... if you get a better answer tell me also :)
