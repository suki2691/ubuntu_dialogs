2005-12-04T09:44:00.000Z	dabaR		when installing?
2005-12-04T09:45:00.000Z	Black_Hat	dabaR	yes. before compiling the kernel
2005-12-04T09:46:00.000Z	dabaR	Black_Hat	see, what I think is: If you need the default kernel, then you dont need to compile.
2005-12-04T09:47:00.000Z	Black_Hat	dabaR	ive been through this process once before and i ended up fucking up my kernel somewhere along the way that i had to reinstall ubuntu
