2010-01-31T07:58:00.000Z	Myke516		Yes onetin
2010-01-31T07:58:00.000Z	trism	Myke516	find folder_name -type f -exec chmod permissions {} + (assuming you mean recursively)
2010-01-31T07:59:00.000Z	trism	Myke516	replacing folder_name with the path to the folder and permissions with the permissions you want to apply
