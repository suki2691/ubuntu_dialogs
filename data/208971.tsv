2005-11-08T17:37:00.000Z	Validdot		hallo, can someone help me with gcc ?      I get error messages while gcc compiles the *.c file. The helloworld.c is right, but it seems there is a problem with stdio.h and libio.h... do I need to reconfigure something?  Thx for the help..
2005-11-08T17:38:00.000Z	Coweater	Validdot	you installed build-essential, not just gcc right?
2005-11-08T17:38:00.000Z	Validdot		Thx, Coweater
