2009-08-18T17:56:00.000Z	Polyculture		hey there, I'm working at a kubuntu 9.04 machine here and have a brother mfc206c printer installed
2009-08-18T17:56:00.000Z	Polyculture		however, the kde printer applet tells me 'cups-missing-filter' when i try to print something
2009-08-18T17:56:00.000Z	Polyculture		any idea how to fix this?
