2007-05-27T06:14:00.000Z	gpolo		is there some repository name I can use in sources.list that points to the latest repository ? instead of using "feisty" or anything, something like "latest"
2007-05-27T06:15:00.000Z	LjL	gpolo	no. when there is a new version, update-manager will notify you of that.
2007-05-27T06:16:00.000Z	gpolo	LjL	it seems if i dont change apt-sources, update-manager doesnt tell me that
2007-05-27T06:16:00.000Z	gpolo	LjL	i haven't used it, but i just tested and it gets updates for my old version and doesnt notify about new ones
