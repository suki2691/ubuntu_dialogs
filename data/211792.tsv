2008-12-31T04:08:00.000Z	w3rd_		i was able to access gnome-diplay-properties.... but im not able to apply the settings
2008-12-31T04:10:00.000Z	w3rd_		i really dont want to use gnome's interface i prefer fluxbox... everything is so convienant but if you cant use dual displays thats garbage... is there a manual way to override these settings in like a conf file or something?

2008-12-31T04:11:00.000Z	sinbox	w3rd_	i think you need fluxbox with xinerama enabled or some such, you could always ask in #fluxbox though
