2010-08-31T06:34:00.000Z	Tuplario		Hi, I was wondering how I can edit the "applications" menu because it seems to point to stuff which I have uninstalled already and I also want to add a couple of things. I have tried the program "menu editor" but it doesn't seem to be able to do anything other than hiding links.
