2008-12-24T23:14:00.000Z	dan2	Halitech	debian has something called iceweasel, which is without the firefox branding marks
2008-12-24T23:14:00.000Z	dan2	Halitech	because there is some sort of trademark dispute
2008-12-24T23:23:00.000Z	Halitech	dan2	it is called Ice Weasel and yes, it is because of trademark issues where the mozilla organization demanded certain things that were againt the gpl and debians view of software so the did what everyone is entitled to and rebranded firefox as ice weasel and thunderbird as ice dove, both of which work perfectly fine for meon 3 systems running debian
