2008-04-01T01:17:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	leonbrussels	I did not found yet. I am very new in linux. If there are rules like: use lsmod and lshw, use command xyz to remove modules and hardware one by one until you get it working, I would like to spend one month to fix it for my self :)
2008-04-01T01:18:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	leonbrussels	there are some threads talking how to debug suspend/hibernate... procedure does not looks easy for me...
