2010-09-29T06:44:00.000Z	dmar198	jsec	or Izinucs :: the help page I was pointed to says, "If you don't see something like that than either your printer is not configured correctly or your Bluetooth adapter isn't recognized. Seek help for both problems in the Ubuntu Forums or the Ubuntu Users mailing list."
2010-09-29T06:45:00.000Z	jsec	dmar198	yeah I looked at it... not a whole lot of helpful info there. I'd look at your printer's manual for how to toggleit.
