2007-03-23T15:49:00.000Z	Clint__		I'm using a laptop with Intel GMA 900 graphics, will beryl work at 1024x768? I'm also wondering if I should install edgy or the feisty beta..
2007-03-23T15:51:00.000Z	aoirthoir	Clint__	as far as beryl try #beryl ..as far as edgy vs fiesty... it depends on how far on the edge you want to be..but fiesty willbe out of beta on the 19th..i'd personally wait until then if you have no experience with Gnu before trying a beta
2007-03-23T15:52:00.000Z	Clint__	aoirthoir	well I've never used linux on this laptop, but I've used it on my desktop several times before.. I'm going to just try edgy, and this laptop is supported with wireless and graphics with novell linux as well as RHEL, so I'm assuming it'll work fine with ubuntu
2007-03-23T15:53:00.000Z	aoirthoir	Clint__	most likely..go with edgy..also go to ubuntuguide.org and get network-manager (follow that instructions) and your wireless should be fine
