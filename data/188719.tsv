2009-10-03T05:02:00.000Z	XiXaQ		is anyone here using network-manager with wlan and static ip here now? I'd like to know how nm-applets config looks like in gconf, cause it's broken in karmic and I need info to hunt down the bug.

2009-10-03T05:05:00.000Z	XiXaQ	test34	nm-applets configuration dialog works for wired and stores what you tell it to?
2009-10-03T05:13:00.000Z	test34	XiXaQ	I edited /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/resolv.conf
