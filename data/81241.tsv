2008-08-26T11:25:00.000Z	bombshelter13		Is there a way to set up Compiz so it acts kind of like the 'Spaces' feature of OS X? I tried to emulate it using Desktop Wall and Expo, but this allows windows to stretch across more than one of the virtual desktop. (i.e, if I have a window taking up most of the screen on the top left desktop and move it half a screen to the right, half of the window is now on the top left desktop and the other half is on the top right).
