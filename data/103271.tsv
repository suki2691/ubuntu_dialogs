2008-03-24T04:54:00.000Z	jedi-alex		hello, im a newbie and im tring for over 4 hours to install ubuntu 7.10 (stable) but without results... im booting with cd and choosing installation but it always freezes (same with v8 beta)
2008-03-24T04:55:00.000Z	jedi-alex		it seems that there is an incompatibility issue but how can i know the reason?
2008-03-24T04:55:00.000Z	jedi-alex		it doesnt give any message, just freezing at the logo and the progress bar
