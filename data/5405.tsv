2012-10-20T00:57:00.000Z	synaesthetik		I just installed 32bit Ubuntu on my mac, but this macbook is made to run a 64bit kernel, should I install 64 bit Ubuntu instead?
2012-10-20T00:58:00.000Z	synaesthetik		also, how would I go about updating from 32 bit Ubuntu to 64?
2012-10-20T00:58:00.000Z	synaesthetik		why not obscurant1st ?
2012-10-20T00:58:00.000Z	kurtwp_	synaesthetik	ah it does not matter - I am running 32bit on a 64bit AMD - I find the 32bit to be more stable
