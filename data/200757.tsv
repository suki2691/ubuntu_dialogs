2006-01-20T12:47:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	johndarkhorse	I see nowhere in here where it says it'll break any functionality.
2006-01-20T12:48:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	johndarkhorse	And, I don't see how it /could/ break anything. Just having direct access to root. Besides it "shouldn't be done" by just anyone, at any time, unless they know what they are doing, when they are doing it.
