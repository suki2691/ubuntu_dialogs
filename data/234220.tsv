2006-05-27T08:09:00.000Z	Tsingi		http://packages.ubuntulinux.org/dapper/net/nis states that NIS requires debconf >= 0.5.00 however debconf is currently at 1.4.72.
2006-05-27T08:09:00.000Z	Tsingi		It's been my experience that when I start installing stuff that isn't in the package manager, I break ubuntu, so should I drop ubuntu and install debian to get NIS?  Or is it safe?
