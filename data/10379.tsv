2011-09-28T02:54:00.000Z	Fail_Bot		I'm not running as root all the time, I'm formatting and installing a new distro of linux, compiling from source, it seems MORE secure to have a secondary user that can authenticate root priveleges, rather than a secure root account that RARELY gets touched

2011-09-28T02:57:00.000Z	Fail_Bot		My root account is password protected, and rarely accessed unless needed.  My everyday user account does not have root priveleges, the only way to access root is to log in as root, in theory since my "everyday" account CAN have root access, I feel like its a security threat
