2011-09-24T05:12:00.000Z	wenexx		do someone know how to find/enter the nautilus channel? I have some ideas like mindcontrol and stuff like that ;-)
2011-09-24T05:14:00.000Z	wenexx		yeah. I posted some ideas in ubuntu.brainstorm and they told me I may should try the irc.gnome.org #nautilus channel/room, but I am new in irc and was alone there, or wrong?
2011-09-24T05:15:00.000Z	xangua	wenexx	irc.gnome.org is not irc freenote
2011-09-24T05:17:00.000Z	wenexx	xangua	thanks so I try empathy again...
