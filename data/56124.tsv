2009-05-29T03:09:00.000Z	vanita_		anyone have any idea on how to enable VDPAU for VLC (or mplayer, totem, etc) in ubuntu 9.04 with supported Nvidia graphics cards?
2009-05-29T03:09:00.000Z	vanita_		this would put the load on the GPU instead of the CPU, right?
2009-05-29T03:09:00.000Z	vanita_		I'm using an i7 920 with 6GB RAM and GTS 250 (AKA Nvidia 9800GTX+ which is using the G92 GPU)
