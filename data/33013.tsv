2010-05-16T11:14:00.000Z	featherofmaat	mufasis	 you want to install on a dedicated partition?
2010-05-16T11:16:00.000Z	mufasis	featherofmaat	its gonna be in a vm on my laptop but i dont have much space left
2010-05-16T11:16:00.000Z	featherofmaat	mufasis	i see.  the official recommendation is 4 gb.  if you are using virtualbox, you can choose a resizing hard drive so that the full 4 gigs are not used right off the bat
