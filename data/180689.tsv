2006-06-11T08:51:00.000Z	nanenj		I accidentally deleted my top panel in gnome, is there a way to restore default configuration?
2006-06-11T08:51:00.000Z	nicolas__	nanenj	you can also right click and add a new panel
2006-06-11T08:52:00.000Z	nicolas__	nanenj	resetting the config is done by rm -rf ~/.gnome*
2006-06-11T08:52:00.000Z	nanenj	nicolas__	thanks :) if that's what it takes to get the default back then I'm ok with that :)
