2009-04-06T21:19:00.000Z	ant1pathy	sipior	anything in particular i should be aware about?  should the standard discs for mobo drivers and such install cleanly?
2009-04-06T21:23:00.000Z	ant1pathy	sipior	thank you for your help, it's very nice to have this kind of instant support.  can i installed off a live cd as well?
2009-04-06T22:05:00.000Z	sipior	ant1pathy	both are possible.
