2009-04-04T08:23:00.000Z	UbbyCD		that wasnt very nice.. I rly had serious question
2009-04-04T08:25:00.000Z	UbbyCD		I tried to lighten the atmosphere with a something I saw as being funny but who cares I didnt realize this room was so uptight.. I seriously want to know if all those popups that happened without me asking was some kind of exploit in Firefox and if it is fixable
2009-04-04T08:26:00.000Z	UbbyCD		because it would be a waste of resources to make them all that way
2009-04-04T08:27:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	UbbyCD	 and why are so many non LTS instead of a few LTS ?
