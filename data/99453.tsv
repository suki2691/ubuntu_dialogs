2012-02-01T14:59:00.000Z	_Ethan_		when manually creating the partitions, /home should be the biggest one in size?
2012-02-01T15:00:00.000Z	Tiven_	_Ethan_	: no need for that
2012-02-01T15:03:00.000Z	Tiven_	_Ethan_	: basically home is all that you save. i used to use Home on my headless server to save all services (webservers, gameservers, etc)
