2006-10-11T15:47:00.000Z	sladen	proudtexan	what "special driver" would you like to add?
2006-10-11T15:48:00.000Z	sladen	proudtexan	that's an Orinoco, it will work out of the box
2006-10-11T15:51:00.000Z	proudtexan	sladen	i'm trying to use the card in rfmon mode which i understand requires a patched driver
