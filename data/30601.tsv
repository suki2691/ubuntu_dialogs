2010-09-08T07:17:00.000Z	trism	etherealite	less -R doesn't color anything, it just doesn't filter the color codes
2010-09-08T07:18:00.000Z	etherealite	trism	 earthmeLon I'm piping color ouput from tree
2010-09-08T07:20:00.000Z	trism	etherealite	works for me, what comand are you using exactly? I see color with tree -C | less -R
