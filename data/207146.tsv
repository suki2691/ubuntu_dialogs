2006-07-11T16:09:00.000Z	SGershon		I am having some difficulty installing IE6 on wine (winetools). My symptoms are as in bug http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4975 .
2006-07-11T16:09:00.000Z	SGershon		I think that IE4 would suffice, but I don't see where/how to install it...
2006-07-11T16:11:00.000Z	SGershon		Any of the 3 versions.
2006-07-11T16:12:00.000Z	polpak	SGershon	I have had more success with ie4linux than with winetools
