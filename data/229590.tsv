2006-01-29T06:04:00.000Z	|37th|Trigger		Hello.. Does anyone know how to reset my password? i forgot it :(
2006-01-29T06:05:00.000Z	bimberi	|37th|Trigger	boot into recovery mode, type "passwd <username>" at the prompt
2006-01-29T06:06:00.000Z	bimberi	|37th|Trigger	no, just "passwd Nick" then it will prompt for a new password
2006-01-29T06:06:00.000Z	bimberi	|37th|Trigger	make sure it works first :)
