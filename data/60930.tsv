2010-10-19T19:31:00.000Z	leif		My laptop (Sony Vaio VPC EB11FM) won't resume from a suspend.  It suspends fine, but when I wake it up...the thing boots up as if I had shut it off.  Does anyone know what might be causing it, or should I send a bug report?  (If so, what program should I use with ubuntu-bug?, thanks).
