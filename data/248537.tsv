2011-07-09T18:59:00.000Z	minimec	tomc	Well I would do exactly the same... ;)

2011-07-09T19:02:00.000Z	minimec	tomc	there were so much changes in Ubuntu between the last LTS versions, starting with ext4, remove of HAL... I would not have tried the upgrade to Lucid. I would have installed Lucid or Natty from scratch-
