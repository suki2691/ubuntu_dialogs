2006-05-01T14:45:00.000Z	ljl	nicolito	you can not and should not save to ntfs from linux
2006-05-01T14:45:00.000Z	nicolito	ljl	_jason... why?????
2006-05-01T14:46:00.000Z	ljl	nicolito	because write support is extremely flaky (basically, there is none) --- i think the reason for that is mostly lack of open specifications
