2012-07-26T01:58:00.000Z	dhalbakken1		Hey, guys. Sorry, I'm fairly new to Ubuntu.
2012-07-26T01:58:00.000Z	dhalbakken1		I'm attempting to access my files on my ubuntu computer from a windows 7 machine, but the ubuntu computer doesn't show up in the network. Currently running Ubuntu 12.04. Anyone know a work-around?
