2005-12-15T10:33:00.000Z	pr0fess0r		I have a PCI 802.11g card that shows up as a prism in Network Settings but I cant get wpa_supplicant to work, either using ndiswrappers or the Prism drivers. Can anyone help me sort out what the wpa_supplicant errors mean?
2005-12-15T10:35:00.000Z	robotgeek	pr0fess0r	why is that a problem?
2005-12-15T10:36:00.000Z	robotgeek	pr0fess0r	no, it's just a name
