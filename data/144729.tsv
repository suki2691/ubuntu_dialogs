2008-01-06T08:15:00.000Z	marx2k		Ok.. having an issue.. installed a motherboard with the NVidia nForce 630A MCP chipset but almost everything (including video card) in 'lspci' is "Unknown Device"
2008-01-06T08:16:00.000Z	acu	marx2k	I have no specific recomendation - however NVIDIA website has preety well developed LINUX drivers - with very clear instructions how to install them
2008-01-06T08:16:00.000Z	marx2k		aptitude does not have a package called nvidia
2008-01-06T08:17:00.000Z	marx2k	acu	yes, for the video drivers.. but these are nForce motherboard issues Im worrying about
