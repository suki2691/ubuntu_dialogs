2008-04-11T17:29:00.000Z	Lamego	Beererde	you could rename it's binary, but that is something you should not do
2008-04-11T17:30:00.000Z	Beererde	Lamego	no other way?
2008-04-11T17:30:00.000Z	Lamego	Beererde	none that I am aware, update-scrollkeeper should always be available to manage gnome documentation during soft install/uninstall
