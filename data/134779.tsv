2007-05-09T14:01:00.000Z	BS|4ster1x	kbrooks	it means that your aptitude will only download from official ubuntu repositories by default
2007-05-09T14:02:00.000Z	BS|4ster1x	kbrooks	u are free to edit your /etc/apt/sources.list file to include other, not officially support repositories aswell ... so this is just a default setting
