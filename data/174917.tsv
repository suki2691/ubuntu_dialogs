2006-07-14T07:19:00.000Z	snoops		I've been using dapper on my main box for about a month and a half now.. what I'm going to do is also install it on my media pc - in that month a lot of updates have come out.. is there a way to say make my main box into a repository so my media pc grabs all the new packages the main machine has?
2006-07-14T07:21:00.000Z	snoops		isn't it frostwire or something on linux?
2006-07-14T07:21:00.000Z	ThunderStruck	snoops	no
2006-07-14T07:21:00.000Z	ThunderStruck	snoops	frostwire isnt in repos either
