2009-07-01T04:53:00.000Z	flanders		But here is another problem I am trying to solve: Whenever it tries to connect to my wireless router, it always asks me to "Connect", but with the password already filled in. How come it will not connect automatically? What is the purpose of this redundant extra step?
