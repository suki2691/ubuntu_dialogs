2009-02-20T15:49:00.000Z	fosco_	ezerhoden	some apps depends on qt libs, such as virtualbox, lastfm client and so
2009-02-20T15:49:00.000Z	ezerhoden	fosco_	sure, but why do they install qt apps with a gnome based distro?
2009-02-20T15:50:00.000Z	fosco_	ezerhoden	qt is a graphical lib, like any other, if any app needs it ubuntu repos will supply it
