2012-09-15T16:01:00.000Z	hjreessa		hello all, can you please tell me what should I type if I want to make the terminal usable without opening new tabs on it after I type a command to open an application
2012-09-15T16:01:00.000Z	hjreessa		for example if I type gedit it opens it but I can not longer use the terminal without closing gedit
2012-09-15T16:01:00.000Z	hjreessa		there was a sign or some other thing that I used to add to the command to free the terminal but I forgot it
