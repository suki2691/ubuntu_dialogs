2007-11-07T19:01:00.000Z	Blinny	neil_d	Rebooting w/ CD now to check.
2007-11-07T19:02:00.000Z	Blinny	neil_d	The choices are: "Install in text mode, OEM install, Install a command-line system"
2007-11-07T19:03:00.000Z	neil_d	Blinny	not the startup you get from the LiveCD to it must be the alternative CD.
