2008-11-09T09:30:00.000Z	will__		I'm having trouble setting up a lamp server on ubuntu desktop edition. Anybody have any help?
2008-11-09T09:31:00.000Z	will__		I've setup the server properly. It works with localhost and 127.0.0.1, but does not work externally from the network i'm on. I have also forwarded the ports 80 and 433 to the server computer.
2008-11-09T09:32:00.000Z	step21	will__	probably some kinda firewall active? also why do you use desktop edition for a server?
