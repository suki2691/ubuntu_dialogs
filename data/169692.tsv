2007-07-19T13:50:00.000Z	dwrz		I have an ATI Mobility Radeon X600. A bit confused as to which driver gives the best performance. I'm currently getting ~1600FPS in glxgears... Beryl runs ok but Google Earth is slow as hell. Should I install the driver in aptitude or the one in restricted drivers? or keep this one?
2007-07-19T13:50:00.000Z	dwrz		anyone?
2007-07-19T13:51:00.000Z	dwrz		I just want to know if I should use aptitude or restricted or if it is not worth the risk?
