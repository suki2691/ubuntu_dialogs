2011-06-08T11:23:00.000Z	royale1223		How do I delete 1st 10 charecters from each line of a file (using sed)?
2011-06-08T11:24:00.000Z	stew	royale1223	sed 's/..........//'
2011-06-08T11:24:00.000Z	stew	royale1223	this will fail if there are lines with fewer than 10 characters
2011-06-08T11:25:00.000Z	royale1223	stew	not a problem.
