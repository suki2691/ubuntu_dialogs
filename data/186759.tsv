2012-02-24T21:41:00.000Z	reesk92		ive got a question about ubuntu install
2012-02-24T21:43:00.000Z	reesk92		basically im thinking of installing ubuntu on my laptop but im worried abut wether it will cause any issues with samsung recovery studio thats on its own partition
2012-02-24T21:43:00.000Z	reesk92		if it breaks that partition in anyway i basically loose my windows 7 install media
