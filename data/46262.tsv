2009-10-04T07:16:00.000Z	shades_aus		has anyone had any luck installing the ext4 file system?
2009-10-04T07:16:00.000Z	herlimenezes1	shades_aus	ok, thanks, but the trouble is that with kopete, I can get audio channel, just video.
2009-10-04T07:17:00.000Z	herlimenezes1	shades_aus	ok, thanks, I will try.
