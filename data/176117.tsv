2007-08-22T06:47:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm		hello, is there a way to filter messages *as they come* in evolution or kmail? the filters do not seem to work upon reciept of messages in either program.

2007-08-22T06:50:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	martalli	im actually trying to filter stuff from one folder to another, I have mailing list stuff that pollutes the inbox and I don't need to see these regularly... but I tried using lots of different methods and couldn't get kmail or evoution to filter unless I explicity selected the message and applied the filter
