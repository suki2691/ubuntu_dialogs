2011-12-16T12:06:00.000Z	ravn		folks, when I have been away from my computer for some time it has done some reshuffling of the memory so there is a whole lot of swapping before there is any response from the machine. Is there some way to configure this away?

2011-12-16T12:09:00.000Z	ravn	somsip	ok, no usually I do nothing but maybe play some music...
2011-12-16T12:10:00.000Z	somsip	ravn	well, if a system is doing other things that need file access, unused processes may be closwer to respond when you next use it. But they'd have to be big music files to do that...
