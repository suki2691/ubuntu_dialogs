2009-05-20T10:25:00.000Z	subb		Hey. Can I ask a question? I'm trying to install Ubuntu 9.04. I've created a partition on my Windows 7 drive and installed Unbuntu there. Also, I've installed Grub this partition, so Windows 7's bootloader would chainload to Grub (with the help of EasyBCD). I get to the point where I can choose between 7 and Ubuntu.
