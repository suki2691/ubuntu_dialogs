2007-10-07T16:18:00.000Z	Dumptruck		my brother is interested in trying out ubuntu - what are some reasons he might want to use linux over windows - of course I have already explained the advantages of security
2007-10-07T16:19:00.000Z	Dumptruck		or is there a website he can check out?
2007-10-07T16:19:00.000Z	oscar^pepper	Dumptruck	 well, personaly, I hated ubuntu at first.  but the more I use it, and the better I understand it, I LOVE It.  Why use anything else.  I think the biggest advatanges are, 1.  It's free and 2. all software connected to it is free.  Also, I was reinstalling windows at least 5 times a month.  Ubuntu is stable and i have not had to reinstall once.

I can install my software under WINE, but the twain drive won't install and I cannot pull my videos off my camera.  But, that may change soon.  either they'll allow for it, or my video camera's manufacture may decide to do something in linux.
