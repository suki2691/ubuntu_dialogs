2008-07-19T22:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	datalus	 unless theres some security issues.. it will most likely get updated in the next release.
2008-07-19T23:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	datalus	 not normally befor then.
2008-07-19T23:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	datalus	 watch the packports and security repositories then.  Ive seen befor where ubuntu keeps an older version, but patches them to remove security issues.
