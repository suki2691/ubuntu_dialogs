2009-08-11T00:44:00.000Z	stroyan	bret	trinidad_ : I don't see evidence of an IP assigned to wlan0 on ubuntu, only on windows.  The pastebin says the AP is "not associated".
2009-08-11T00:46:00.000Z	bret	stroyan	are you looking at http://paste.ubuntu.com/251004/ ?   it's showing an ip of 169.254.11.184 for wlan0
2009-08-11T00:47:00.000Z	stroyan	bret	169.254.11.184 is just a phony address that avahi made up for itself.  It was not really assigned.
