2008-02-06T00:23:00.000Z	wil_		Hi.... I have tried to upgrade from 5.10 to the latest, but got problems... I just burnt a cd from a .iso and it boots in to the menu, but any option brings up a error and it reboots :( anyone got any ideas?
2008-02-06T00:24:00.000Z	PriceChild	wil_	you must not skip versions when upgrading
2008-02-06T00:24:00.000Z	PriceChild	wil_	5.10 > 6.06 > 6.10 etc.
2008-02-06T00:24:00.000Z	PriceChild	wil_	you may be able to go from 6.06 straight to 8.04 in april... but that's not done yet.
