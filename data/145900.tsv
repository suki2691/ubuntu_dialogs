2007-02-14T07:07:00.000Z	Vilhelms		I am having a problem where World of Warcraft has bad FPS and after about a minute hangs, as well as my whole PC and can't seem to find a solution for it. Here is some output related to my video card, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/5608/. Does anyone have any idea of what I could try?

2007-02-14T07:08:00.000Z	Vilhelms	Biovore	So what you're saying is that its probably a problem with wine?
2007-02-14T07:09:00.000Z	Biovore	Vilhelms	wine is very complex..
