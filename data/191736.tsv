2006-06-05T16:44:00.000Z	zipper_	Healot	no
2006-06-05T16:46:00.000Z	zipper_	Healot	x does not start, it only gives me that error and shuts down. if i remove BusID it works fine, but i need the setting for dualview (or well, i hope so at least)
2006-06-05T16:47:00.000Z	Healot	zipper_	is your card nv or ati?
