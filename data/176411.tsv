2006-06-27T09:17:00.000Z	userundefine	Evilscientist	possibly
2006-06-27T09:20:00.000Z	userundefine	Evilscientist	ah, you've installed ubuntu as a server?  Just use command line programs (like nano) then.
2006-06-27T09:24:00.000Z	userundefine	Evilscientist	you could, but the GUI would just be wasting cpu cycles and RAM if you keep it on there.  Your choice, really
