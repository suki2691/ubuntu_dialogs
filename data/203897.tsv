2006-04-17T05:42:00.000Z	tspier2		Hi. I set up Apache, PHP, and MySQL on my computer, because I want to make it into a little server. How can I change the URL from "http://localhost:78" to an actual URL? And also, how can I change the home page from the default file browser to one of the files?
2006-04-17T05:43:00.000Z	LadyNikon	tspier2	do you have a domain?
2006-04-17T05:59:00.000Z	tspier2	LadyNikon	what is the default page for Apache2?
