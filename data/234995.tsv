2006-06-27T10:27:00.000Z	detectiveinspekt		do I have to forward UTP for a ssh server?
2006-06-27T10:28:00.000Z	detectiveinspekt		when I try to connect to my server outside it says wrong pwsd, but inside its fine
2006-06-27T10:29:00.000Z	detectiveinspekt		but If I had two servers connected to the router how would they know which one?
