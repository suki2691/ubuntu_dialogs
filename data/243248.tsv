2005-05-20T14:10:00.000Z	Seveaz	HappyFool	he reinstalled ubuntu while keeping the data, installing sudo went wrong. So the old sudoers file was kept. But he chose a new username, which of course wasn;t in the sudoers file
2005-05-20T14:10:00.000Z	Seveaz	HappyFool	so we don't have to blame the installer :)
2005-05-20T14:10:00.000Z	HappyFool	Seveaz	ah. so his clean install of hoary wasn't quite ;)
