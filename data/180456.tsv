2006-08-01T11:47:00.000Z	DarkMageZ	ceruleantiger	please be alittle more careful with the autocomplete
2006-08-01T11:48:00.000Z	ceruleantiger	DarkMageZ	kopete is a kde app. It's kinda crummy, but it has a level of integration with kde that I like a lot...
2006-08-01T11:48:00.000Z	ceruleantiger	DarkMageZ	oh, sorry about that
