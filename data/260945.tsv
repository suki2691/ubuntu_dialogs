2007-03-22T05:41:00.000Z	billy	ZeroSystem	 because it isnt' enabled in your BIOS?
2007-03-22T05:43:00.000Z	billy	ZeroSystem	 I don't know.  maybe cuz you're using the slave to boot the master.  I don't know though.
2007-03-22T05:44:00.000Z	billy	ZeroSystem	 both masters?  now that, i've never encountered before.  maybe try using a super grub disc to install grub on the first.
