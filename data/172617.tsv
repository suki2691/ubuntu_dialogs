2008-06-16T17:02:00.000Z	dougsko	idefine	yes you can run 32bit apps, yes you might run into some compatability issues
2008-06-16T17:04:00.000Z	idefine	dougsko	if you have tried or are using 64bit ubuntu, how is/was your experience
2008-06-16T17:05:00.000Z	dougsko	idefine	ive never used it, ive always just heard that the better choice is 32bit because its the most supported
