Anyone have an idea why my firestarter might be detecting hits from my own computer on port 16680 , i think when azureus is open, while thats not the port azureus is set to work on, and while it works perfectly regardless? Its just annoying to have that icon turn red all the time for no real reason
2007-05-24T13:38:00.000Z	aryah		simply, what possible service might be running by default on port 16680?
2007-05-24T13:38:00.000Z	Pelo	aryah	if you don'T get an answer here there is a firestarter channel
2007-05-24T13:39:00.000Z	Pelo	aryah	 and I got rid of firestarter becaseu of that icon,   firestarter is just a frontend anyway,  the real firewall is netfilter
