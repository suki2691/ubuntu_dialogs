2005-11-15T07:11:00.000Z	fyrmedic	steve_	Yes and I haven't had any problems with it
2005-11-15T07:12:00.000Z	steve_	fyrmedic	what sort of xorg.conf do you use, my version seems to think the scroll wheel is being clicked all the time and pastes stuff randomly and moves icons around and all when you hover over it
2005-11-15T07:14:00.000Z	fyrmedic	steve_	You know, I am sorry but I don't know that answer. I am using whatever the default installation is when you install ubuntu. I am not so savvy with Linux yet.
