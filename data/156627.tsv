2008-01-22T21:20:00.000Z	hobbzilla		Greetings. Just installed ubuntu for the first time.
2008-01-22T21:20:00.000Z	hobbzilla		however, during the install process, it never asked me to set root's passwd.
2008-01-22T21:20:00.000Z	hobbzilla		is there a default passwd.
2008-01-22T21:20:00.000Z	riotkittie	hobbzilla	there is no root password. root is locked. use sudo.
