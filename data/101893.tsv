2008-02-03T05:12:00.000Z	Dekkharyn		Hi guys, I've been looking around the support forum and wiki all day, I've been trying to find a bootable floppy that will then load ubuntu from usb, I've got Ubuntu installed to USB just as the support stuff says, but can't make the floppy - tried this, http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/wiki/index.php/Boot_Floppies - found via google, but fails when it boots
2008-02-03T05:13:00.000Z	Dekkharyn		does anyone have a resource handy, like a ubuntu floppy usb-bootstrapper image?
