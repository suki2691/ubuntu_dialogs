2005-07-12T05:59:00.000Z	Jimbob	corey	inotify is a kernel feature
2005-07-12T05:59:00.000Z	Jimbob	corey	If your system has it, there will be a /dev/inotify device
2005-07-12T06:00:00.000Z	corey	Jimbob	I know, but I don't have a /dev/inotify. I'm pretty sure it is supposed to be in the hoary kernel though
