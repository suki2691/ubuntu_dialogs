2008-02-15T02:38:00.000Z	Webu	Cyanide1	you're trying to listen .mp3-music right?
2008-02-15T02:39:00.000Z	Webu	Cyanide1	that's a restricted format, you'll need to install support for them :) Check this out: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats#head-6c1adf157cf1aaf47a391922036b3ecc98f01796
2008-02-15T02:41:00.000Z	Webu	Cyanide1	no problem, after that .mp3 and other restricted formats should play with all related programs :)
