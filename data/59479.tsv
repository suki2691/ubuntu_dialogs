2009-05-03T11:11:00.000Z	bcleveng		Can someone help me figure out what's going wrong with my attempt at a fresh Ubuntu install?
2009-05-03T11:13:00.000Z	bcleveng		I'm trying to install 8.04, and it goes through the initial screens but then drops me on a console with no xserver.
2009-05-03T11:14:00.000Z	bcleveng		No, I mean 8.04. I'm using a dell mini 10, and the 9.04 drivers aren't compatible so I'm trying to use the version dell releases. It's the Intel GMA 500 chip.
2009-05-03T11:14:00.000Z	RedSocrates	bcleveng	Did you check the integrity of the CD?
