2009-11-30T15:26:00.000Z	Draconis		so heard someone chatting up enlightenment and decided to give it a whirl.. its pretty good. Anyone have any other recommendations? Also I am tryng to figure out how to assign a hot key to run a terminal window. I can't seem to find it in the key bindings like GNOME has
2009-11-30T15:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Draconis	lxde is my personal recommendation
2009-11-30T15:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Draconis	for the keybinding, not sure
2009-11-30T15:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Draconis	could ask in #elightenment
