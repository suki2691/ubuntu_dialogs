2012-02-19T11:58:00.000Z	alnr	head_victim	i'm pretty scared what will happen to this sys on apt-get update; not even knowing if its deb or ub. i dont know how it got this way. i'm hoping i can look at packages folder and sort it out
2012-02-19T12:01:00.000Z	alnr	head_victim	i think i musta converted it to ub from deb,at some point
2012-02-19T12:05:00.000Z	head_victim	alnr	it's Ubuntu, my /etc/debian_version also has debian release names there.
