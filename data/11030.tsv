2011-08-06T19:39:00.000Z	Cozey		Hello. I have a fresh install of Natty, apt-get updated. I want to install jde, but it's deps are missing. What am I doing wrong? I have added multiverse and canonical repositories. This site: http://packages.ubuntu.com/natty/jde says 'not available' for those dependencies (like cedet-contrib)
