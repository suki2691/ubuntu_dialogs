2008-10-28T13:03:00.000Z	alex____	murlox	you can save it as an image? and print that
2008-10-28T13:05:00.000Z	alex____		if you are keen, you could add an entry to grub like the windows one (at the bottom) corresponding to the other NTFS partition, the ones with the boot flag in your pasted output, see if windows will boot from them?
2008-10-28T13:07:00.000Z	murlox	alex____	well, it looks kinda ugly as an image; I prefer to print it normally. Thanks for the response.
