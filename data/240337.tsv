2006-06-20T10:21:00.000Z	sentinel		I currently have a GUI ubuntu install setup for remote accessing, therefore without a monitor plugged in, except after the reboot without the monitor, it seems to only be able to start X at 640x480 resolution, is there any way I could force it to run at a higher resolution?
2006-06-20T10:21:00.000Z	sentinel		nope
2006-06-20T10:22:00.000Z	sentinel		in the GUI configuration it only lists 640x480 at 60hz
