2010-05-04T19:32:00.000Z	guest42420		I need to rip MP3s in Ubuntu 9.10.  Please help me!!  I don't know how to get the right libraries installed.  This is way too f$cking hard.
2010-05-04T19:33:00.000Z	guest42420		Does anyone here rip CDs to MP3?  What app do you use?!?

2010-05-04T19:35:00.000Z	guest42420	marinus	You're talking about soundjuicer, but there are no mp3 libraries.  apparently i have to install LAME, but I can't download from the ubuntu repository and can't figure out what to do.  this is so freaking frustrating
