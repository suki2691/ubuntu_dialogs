2008-03-19T06:04:00.000Z	Flamekebab		I'm running Gutsy - how come it's possible to run X without a xorg.conf file?
2008-03-19T06:04:00.000Z	soulrider__	Flamekebab	theres always one
2008-03-19T06:05:00.000Z	soulrider__	Flamekebab	type "cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
2008-03-19T06:07:00.000Z	Flamekebab	soulrider__	it seems the Xorg config that's running works fairly well, but I can't find the config file it's using for it
