2007-10-25T07:33:00.000Z	ryy		Hello, my audio is not working since I installed Gutsy Gibbon on my Dell Inspiron 1501.  Funny thing is that it worked fine on Fiesty.  According to Vista, I have SigmaTel High Definition Audio CODEC, Sigmatel STAC92XX C-Major HD Audio Driver.  Is there anything I do to revive my audio?  Or should I just go back to Fiesty?
