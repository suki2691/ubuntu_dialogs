2009-06-24T17:20:00.000Z	_Fauchi95_	vigo	When I use a backport-package: it is better to install every new version from the sources? Than I have all securityupdates
2009-06-24T17:21:00.000Z	vigo	_Fauchi95_	I would suggest that, yes, if you install from unknown repositories then Launchpad or Ubuntu has no idea if or when a security exploit mayor may not exist.
2009-06-24T17:22:00.000Z	_Fauchi95_	vigo	Thanks, than I update my backport ejabberd to ejabberd 2.0.5
