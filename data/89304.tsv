2008-07-03T18:15:00.000Z	norman_x		somebody here knows about installing tft-monitor on a nvidia 7300gt with dvi under ubuntu 8.04?
2008-07-03T18:16:00.000Z	crusie	norman_x	plug it in ?
2008-07-03T18:17:00.000Z	norman_x	crusie	yeaah, thanks, that will be the solution... ;-) ;-) But being serius: the fonts do not work properly, the monitor is not recognized and so on
