I just noticed some insanity while trying Mint and wonder if this also happens in Ubuntu now: When you choose germany as your location during install, it creates german directory names. So "Desktop" isnt called "Desktop" but "Arbeitsfläche". Does this come from the latest Debian release or is it an invention of Ubuntu or Mint?
