2011-11-09T07:55:00.000Z	bjrohan		One more question. My audio is also garbled, both internet videos, CD's, as well as even the speaker test. Any idea why? I have selected all audio settings, the only one the works is analog stereo duplex
2011-11-09T07:56:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	bjrohan	try killing pulse audio "killall pulseaudio"
2011-11-09T07:57:00.000Z	bjrohan	WIGGMPk	- just did, still garbled :-(
2011-11-09T07:58:00.000Z	bjrohan	WIGGMPk	For a while it would work not garbled, but that was rare, so I know it is possible.
