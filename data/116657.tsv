2009-02-21T23:56:00.000Z	jatt		are there any dissadvantages in using System->Quit->Hibernate instead of System->Quit->Shut Down? Hibernate is working great with my laptop, but I'm not sure if it has dissadvantages over shutdown...

2009-02-21T23:58:00.000Z	jatt	zonyl	thanks for your reply. I see, yes I was thinking in hardware problems too, for example that hibernate would stress some hardware, but is just speculation from my part. If it doesn't have dissadvantages I will use Hibernate instead shutdown always :)
