2006-09-01T06:44:00.000Z	Rechner-Tester		Hi there! I've the following problem: I use an USB Pendrive with one Fat-Partition for Data exchange between Windows/Linux (Ubuntu 6.06). When (re)mounting (meaning plugin in the drive) all files have the executen bit enabled even for text files. Where can I change the default mount options for usbdrives? /etc/fstab dosen't seems to be the right place for me.

2006-09-01T06:46:00.000Z	Rechner-Tester	Jack_Sparrow	default fstab with no entry for /dev/sda(1)
2006-09-01T07:12:00.000Z	Rechner-Tester	Jack_Sparrow	any idea about my problem?
