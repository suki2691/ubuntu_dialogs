2006-10-25T12:14:00.000Z	whiz2		I'm trying to share a printer in Kubuntu using Samba to share with Windows XP Pro, Windows 98, and another Kubuntu PC. Any time I try to export drivers, Linux tells me there are some missing drivers. Any time I try to install the printer in one of the other computers, I get a message stating that drivers are not available on the originating PC, and install fails. How do I share my printer from Kubuntu using Samba?
