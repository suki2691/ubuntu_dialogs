2011-04-12T08:01:00.000Z	oneliner		right so there s no way to do su untill i set a root pass?
2011-04-12T08:01:00.000Z	oneliner		i know sudo acomplishes the same just looking at the options
2011-04-12T08:02:00.000Z	oneliner		is giving a user a password the only requirement to allow it to call sudo?
2011-04-12T08:03:00.000Z	Ben64	oneliner	the user has to be in sudoers
