2007-05-28T09:31:00.000Z	m0u5e		My update manager is no longer able to update things correctly, everytime I say update, it just rechecks deps and repos, and goes back to the main screen
2007-05-28T09:31:00.000Z	Lilacor	m0u5e	try an update from the terminal
2007-05-28T09:32:00.000Z	Lilacor	m0u5e	so apt-get update gives no errors but update-manager does... odd
2007-05-28T09:33:00.000Z	Lilacor	m0u5e	have you tried re-installing update-manager?
