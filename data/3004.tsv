2012-05-18T19:51:00.000Z	Darnoth		Can anyone familiar with preseeding tell me why I get prompted to confirm lvm partitioning when using http://pastebin.com/9czQPpVL on 12.04?
2012-05-18T19:53:00.000Z	Darnoth		Guess I'll try asking a different question :).. Anyone using preseeding to do fully automated installs with 12.04?
2012-05-18T19:55:00.000Z	L3tops	Darnoth	I do so with 1004
2012-05-18T19:55:00.000Z	Darnoth	L3tops	Mind sharing your partitioning scheme? I've looked everywhere online and they swear "d-i partman/confirm_nooverwrite boolean true" should fix my problem, but it doesn't.
