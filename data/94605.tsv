2008-04-16T10:02:00.000Z	AnotherNoob		Hi, hoping i can get advice on which ubuntu package to use to get best performance. I have 3x P2 400mhz 480m ram + 1x P4 2.6 1G ram. I have trialled Edubuntu + thin clients. Am now looking at Xubuntu, possibly also with thin clients or should i stick with fat clients?
