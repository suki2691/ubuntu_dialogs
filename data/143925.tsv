2007-03-19T07:21:00.000Z	Orphyux		I just installed ubuntu and I need help with installing the wireless driver
2007-03-19T07:22:00.000Z	Pollywog	Orphyux	is it rt2500?
2007-03-19T07:23:00.000Z	Pollywog	Orphyux	if there isn't a Linux driver you will need ndiswrapper and I think there is a howto in the forums or a link to one
