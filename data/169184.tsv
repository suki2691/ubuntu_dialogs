2007-04-07T16:45:00.000Z	aabrahao		<Flannel> sudo apt-get install gnome? Why install gnome instead of kde?
2007-04-07T16:47:00.000Z	aabrahao		<Flannel> what is the better, gnome or kde?
2007-04-07T16:48:00.000Z	brucedes	aabrahao	it's personal opinion, I prefer gnome, since I think KDE is bloated and ugly
