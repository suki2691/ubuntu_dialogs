2006-08-25T12:52:00.000Z	imping		I'm trying to use the Ubuntu live CD on my new Toshiba R25. I get the following error message when booting up: "Failed to start the X server (your graphical interface)." Can anyone help?

2006-08-25T12:57:00.000Z	dannym	imping	hmm, "http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1381554" says it "should" work
