2006-12-08T12:37:00.000Z	bluefox83	rpedro	dvd can hold more stuff for installation than cd can
2006-12-08T12:37:00.000Z	rpedro	bluefox83	so, it does have more packages?
2006-12-08T12:39:00.000Z	rpedro	bluefox83	because I can't even find the files to make a jigdo download of the alternate cd anymore...
