2010-09-27T10:22:00.000Z	lxsys		Hey. I'm on another IRC server, and irssi is giving out my hostname which has my ip. Every now and then somebody is annoyed that I kicked them and they DoS my low bandwidth connection. How do I stop irssi giving out my hostname?
2010-09-27T10:23:00.000Z	geekuskhan	lxsys	you'll need to enable vhost for your user / op....
2010-09-27T10:23:00.000Z	geekuskhan		not sure about the server itself
2010-09-27T10:23:00.000Z	lxsys	geekuskhan	ok, thanks
