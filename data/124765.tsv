2007-12-27T22:18:00.000Z	KlrSpz	Trent0r23	well to be honest, that comes with experience... reading specifically what you want to do is a good start though
2007-12-27T22:19:00.000Z	KlrSpz	Trent0r23	well, depends on your dedication.. gentoo/arch linux are both great at getting to understand your userspace, as well as the terminal capabilities
