2006-12-29T11:18:00.000Z	Simplechat		yet you seem to have to enter your password to do system admin tasks
2006-12-29T11:18:00.000Z	Simplechat		so, is your account a virtual root?
2006-12-29T11:20:00.000Z	wastrel	Simplechat	 the root account exists but doesn't have a password enabled.  the sudo system exists to allow you to perform system administration tasks.
