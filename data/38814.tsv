2010-02-06T08:49:00.000Z	r0b0tchicken	jack5463	at least change it to security updates and get those...
2010-02-06T08:50:00.000Z	jack5463	r0b0tchicken	what are the security problems with ubuntu?
2010-02-06T08:51:00.000Z	r0b0tchicken	jack5463	not so  much "sec problems" ,but every now and again they will find a "Possible vulnerability", and my advice is at the very least, enable "security updates only", and install them
