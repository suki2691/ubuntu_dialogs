2006-10-08T06:03:00.000Z	vega_		im trying to install WINE but cant find it in synaptic package manager, any help?
2006-10-08T06:03:00.000Z	LjL	vega_	i suppose you don't have Universe enabled
2006-10-08T06:24:00.000Z	LjL	vega_	no. but it emulates the i386 architecture, so you can install the i386 Ubuntu on an AMD64 processor
2006-10-08T06:26:00.000Z	LjL	vega_	that's fine, except that on AMD64 you lack some things that exist for i386... like some video codecs, perhaps Flash...
