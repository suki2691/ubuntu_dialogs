2012-02-06T02:45:00.000Z	ben__		how do I get rid of Ubuntu? I don't want to have to go through the whole installation and uninstalling process again. Trust me, I've done it 7 times.
2012-02-06T02:45:00.000Z	Bsims	ben__	native install or via wubi?
2012-02-06T02:48:00.000Z	Bsims	ben__	do this sudo parted -l
2012-02-06T02:49:00.000Z	Bsims	ben__	this will list the existing partitions
