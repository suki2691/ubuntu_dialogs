2008-05-13T10:00:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	TaRDy	OpenSolaris uses ggrub on their live dvd too
2008-05-13T10:01:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	TaRDy	worst case you will have to have 2 grubs, one which launches everything except opensolaris and can launch the second grub, which in turn can launch open solaris
2008-05-13T10:02:00.000Z	TaRDy	devilsadvocate	ok, i will install opensolaris 2nd of the 3 to ensure ubuntu's grub has final say
