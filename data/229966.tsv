2006-03-27T07:15:00.000Z	boo_		Another thing, is there any way to edit/backup/copy ntfs files from ubuntu?
2006-03-27T07:15:00.000Z	tristanmike	boo_	you can read from ntfs, but you cannot write to it, so no edit while on ntfs
2006-03-27T07:17:00.000Z	tristanmike	boo_	yeah, that shouldn't be much of a problem, but not natively
2006-03-27T07:17:00.000Z	tristanmike	boo_	you'll just need some other software to help you
