2011-09-27T17:04:00.000Z	theadmin	jasonmsp	Meh... find / -iname 'whatever' -print 2>/dev/null
2011-09-27T17:05:00.000Z	jasonmsp	theadmin	 thanks.  Am I understanding correctly if I run that on command line that will search the mounted folders when I click on the dash find files?
2011-09-27T17:05:00.000Z	theadmin	jasonmsp	Nah... It's just a CLI way of searching ;) Forget GUIs
