2012-11-21T01:57:00.000Z	Clair		Hi.  This is my third harddrive and my third time running completely fresh install of ubuntu with next to no extras.  First 12.04 and then 12.10 both server editions.  Each time, within a few days I get hit with a Filystem read only error and it stops working.  Why?  Is there anyway to fix this?

2012-11-21T01:58:00.000Z	OptiWork	Clair	memtest?
2012-11-21T02:07:00.000Z	OptiWork	Clair	size of drives and are you using MBR?
