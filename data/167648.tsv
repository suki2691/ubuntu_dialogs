2007-03-10T12:34:00.000Z	BigMac		Hey all. I have a dell 1501 with a broadcom chipset in ubuntu edgy eft. I Have ndiswrapper'd the driver, set it up and my wifi light is lit, but I can't find eth 1 under right clicking the networking icon in the task pane.

2007-03-10T12:35:00.000Z	BigMac	bluefox83	I have never seen that as an option
2007-03-10T12:38:00.000Z	BigMac	bluefox83	my light is on but lo, eth 0 , eth1 and sit0 all return nothing when I "iwlist scanning"
