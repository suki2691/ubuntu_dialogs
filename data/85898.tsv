2009-02-11T21:31:00.000Z	jackmayol		I messed up my /etc/fstab, with all the same mounting names.... (cant remember doing something that stupid but anyway...) those are ntfs partitions, I'd like to know which one contains what to give them the appropriate name (games, music, etc...)
2009-02-11T21:32:00.000Z	pike_	jackmayol	sudo fdisk -l and also the mount command
2009-02-11T21:33:00.000Z	jackmayol	pike_	I did already the fdisk -l but I have just theblocks size, but for 2 partitions, I dont know which is what
