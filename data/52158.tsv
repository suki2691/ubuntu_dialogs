2009-07-22T08:49:00.000Z	martyr2k6		ok, I am running windows as my native OS, I booted into the ubuntu live cd and installed ubuntu on an external hard drive (which I have been successful doing in the past) and went to reboot my computer and it wouldn't boot. this is NOT my problem, because after I went to format the external again through the live cd and reboot from the live cd to my windows, it said "GRUB Loading stage1.5. GRUB Loading, please wait... Error 21
