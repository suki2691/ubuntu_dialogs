2008-04-27T09:03:00.000Z	tokyoahead		guys can someone help me getting sound from my SoundMAX soundcard on my laptop? the external volume control works fine with the linux volume slider, but I cannot hear any sound...
2008-04-27T09:04:00.000Z	aardvarken	tokyoahead	is the correct device selected in the sound settings?
2008-04-27T09:04:00.000Z	aardvarken	tokyoahead	for instance, my surround sound car can select front, back, etc.
2008-04-27T09:04:00.000Z	tokyoahead	aardvarken	I think so. I chose ALSA for all of them, Autodeteect would not let me hear the test-sound
