2010-04-30T08:08:00.000Z	WillieDaPimp	slw	yea, ive thought about going back to arch, i've thought about going back to gentoo, but i think ill end up back with a vanilla debian install
2010-04-30T08:10:00.000Z	slw	WillieDaPimp	the only reaons I'm not on debian is the ppa's...
2010-04-30T08:10:00.000Z	WillieDaPimp	slw	yea...that has alot to do with why im using a custom ubuntu install too
