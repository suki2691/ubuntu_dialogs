2006-07-09T11:12:00.000Z	farky	Cntryboy	why would you want to do that?
2006-07-09T11:13:00.000Z	farky	Cntryboy	this is the Ubuntu Support channel, not the How to kick your buddy off IRC channel
2006-07-09T11:14:00.000Z	Cntryboy	farky	no duh, I know what the channel is for, but someone might have known
