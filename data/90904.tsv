2008-06-07T21:12:00.000Z	MightyTweek		I'm trying to mount an ancient 100MB hard drive with a USB to IDE cable and Ubuntu is detecting it as a 2TB hard drive. Anybody know how to force the detected geometry? /var/log/messages here: http://pastebin.ca/1041324

2008-06-07T21:13:00.000Z	MightyTweek	hiptobecubic	if only it could somehow work as 2TB, I'd be set :)
