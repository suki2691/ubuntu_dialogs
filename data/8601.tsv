2011-10-18T09:57:00.000Z	alexhairyman		Will an update fix a screwed python setup? I don't think it's super screwed, just a misplaced couple a files
2011-10-18T09:58:00.000Z	yagoo	alexhairyman	why not do a force reinstall instead of an update?
2011-10-18T09:59:00.000Z	yagoo	alexhairyman	backup the /etc or other python main custom setup text files u'd like to keep.. "purge" python so that maybe messy settings are wiped.. then reinstall
2011-10-18T10:03:00.000Z	alexhairyman	yagoo	I did a make install, and I tried purging..... Oh well... at least I can honestly blame myself for this reinstall and not windows, I should probably just have added a small script to point to my built version
