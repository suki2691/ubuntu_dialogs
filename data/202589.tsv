2006-09-07T09:32:00.000Z	justin_		I had mine set at 928mb haha
2006-09-07T09:32:00.000Z	krazykit	justin_	yeah, that's too big.  it was either 64 or 128.  i honestly don't recall
2006-09-07T09:33:00.000Z	justin_	krazykit	Yeah I would like to set "bios default" but.. that will change all my tweaking and I do not want that... i'll go ask a graphic room
