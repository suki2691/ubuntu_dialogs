2011-06-09T06:17:00.000Z	rsharma		Hi guys, I have a question - After Ubuntu 11.04 will the Ubuntu OS drop the GNOME enviorment and completley replace it with UNITY?
2011-06-09T06:18:00.000Z	rsharma		Oh alright, because I honestly just can not get used to UNITY, it is more of a netbook release then a desktop in my oppnion
2011-06-09T06:18:00.000Z	xangua	rsharma	unity is the default desktop from now on
