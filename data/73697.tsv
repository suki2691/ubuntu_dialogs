2009-01-28T10:20:00.000Z	carpii		if a package has the same name in two repositories, which one will it choose to install?
2009-01-28T10:21:00.000Z	carpii		eg, i added win repo's, but i think it may have installed the normal ubuntu rls
2009-01-28T10:21:00.000Z	nickrud	carpii	it will take the highest version number
2009-01-28T10:22:00.000Z	carpii	nickrud	ok thanks. i thought maybe the order in sources.list mattered
