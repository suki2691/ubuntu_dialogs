2012-05-23T04:19:00.000Z	zabomber	psusi	so if i dd my OS partition and move to new hardware i dont need to do a repair install?
2012-05-23T04:19:00.000Z	psusi	zabomber	no... but dd is kind of a sucky way to do it... requires the new disk to be >= size of old one, and you have to resize after to make use of the new space... and wastes time copying free sectors
