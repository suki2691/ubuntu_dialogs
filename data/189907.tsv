2007-04-23T06:11:00.000Z	MindOfChaos		only xchat-gnome
2007-04-23T06:12:00.000Z	slackern	MindOfChaos	you need to have universe enabled to be able to use xchat
2007-04-23T06:13:00.000Z	slackern	MindOfChaos	System -> Administration -> Software Sources and enable universe there, then after that is completed a 'sudo apt-get install xchat' will give you the normal xhcat
