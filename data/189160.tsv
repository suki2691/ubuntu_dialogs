2007-06-18T11:18:00.000Z	Spec	mtv	what do you mean you keep loosing them?
2007-06-18T11:19:00.000Z	mtv	Spec	well i just rebooted and noticed my comp wasnt recognizing my audio cd.  checked and cdrom wasnt in dev along with hdc which it was associated with.  Swap is gone as well
2007-06-18T11:22:00.000Z	mtv	Spec	It is strange after every reboot the sdx changes.  Last time i associated my drives with sda, now they are sde.  This has been happening since my update to fiesty, when i lost my swap, and did mkswap for hda5
