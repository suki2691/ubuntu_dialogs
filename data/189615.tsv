2006-04-26T06:46:00.000Z	marnanel		I just tried to upgrade from breezy to dapper, but now when I try to ifup eth0 I get "error while getting interface flags: no such device". It's not the kernel, because I tried going back to the old kernel in grub and the same thing happens. If I modprobe the right driver it still doesn't work. Can anyone suggest what I might be doing wrong?
