2010-10-20T08:17:00.000Z	Balthazar		can anyone explain to me why my ip address are different on ubuntu and windows. I have been searching for hours with no real information

2010-10-20T08:18:00.000Z	h00k	Balthazar	unless you set it statically, there's no promise you'll always get the same one
2010-10-20T08:18:00.000Z	Balthazar	h00k	Why would I get better download speeds from my windows IP than my Ubuntu IP?
