2007-01-15T14:00:00.000Z	Jozan	Jewfro-Macabbi	why's that?
2007-01-15T14:01:00.000Z	Jewfro-Macabbi	Jozan	ubuntu and debian are not the same. trying to dist-upgrade from ubuntu to deb would just break. If you want Debian, install it cleanly.
2007-01-15T14:01:00.000Z	Jozan	Jewfro-Macabbi	figured as much.. I was hoping there was some voodoo I could perform ;) thanks
