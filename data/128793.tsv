2008-10-31T17:18:00.000Z	netyire		hi all, I'm trying to upgrade to 8.10 from 8.04 with a 8.10 disc on hand, is it possible to use the disc to upgrade instead of letting the package manager fetch the packages from the internet?

2008-10-31T17:19:00.000Z	netyire	ziroday	uh oh, looks like I downloaded the wrong one; how do you go about using the alternate install disc to update the system?
