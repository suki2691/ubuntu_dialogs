2009-03-08T22:44:00.000Z	ShipwreckZombies		I am quite new and attempting having my first go at Linux. I am going to dual boot Vista64 and Ubuntu8.10 - On the download page there is a radio button for 32 or 64 bit. I am confused as to why the 64bit file name has AMD in it?
2009-03-08T22:45:00.000Z	ShipwreckZombies		I don't follow?
2009-03-08T22:47:00.000Z	ShipwreckZombies		I am running an Intel CPU, does the AMD in the file name not refer to a specific processor type?
