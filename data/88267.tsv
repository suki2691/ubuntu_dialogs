2008-06-26T22:27:00.000Z	Gnutoo		hello, ubuntu hardy is still at firefox-3.0-beta5 or something like that(a not yet released version) and firefox 3.0 has been released since some time now...is it possible to get the released version...maybe compiling a deb? because the not yet released version has got a lot of bugs...and i'd like to use firefox3...

2008-06-26T22:28:00.000Z	s0ullight		it did with me
2008-06-26T22:29:00.000Z	Gnutoo	s0ullight	ah i made apt-get update a lot of times including today...but apt-cache show didn't show me the good version
