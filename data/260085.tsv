2004-11-03T08:38:00.000Z	SmokesWater		I need to install Windows on the same hard drive as Ubuntu is (no problem with partitions) but how do I after installing windows restore grub?
2004-11-03T08:39:00.000Z	plagiats	SmokesWater	sounds easier to install MSWindows first and then add Ubuntu
2004-11-03T08:40:00.000Z	SmokesWater	plagiats	I know but its to late for it, for may reasons as first windows wouldn't install (run after formating and copying files). I had no idea why it was that way. 
2004-11-03T08:41:00.000Z	SmokesWater	plagiats	So now I remember that I changed my mouse from ps/2 to usb. So I want to give it another try but if it fails, I don't want to do another ubuntu isntall.
