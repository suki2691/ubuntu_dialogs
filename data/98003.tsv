2009-01-31T10:40:00.000Z	Shii		which version of ubuntu has the least glitchy version of pulseaudio? i'm hoping i can upgrade my way out of this Flash mess
2009-01-31T10:41:00.000Z	Shii		thanks miik! i guess i'll wait for that
2009-01-31T10:42:00.000Z	Shii		currently i'm on gutsy, i know it will be discontinued soon but pulseaudio is broken for my card
