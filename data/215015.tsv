2006-04-18T14:12:00.000Z	leo__	FlannelKing	yes , but I want my end-users to go directly in the graphical environment
2006-04-18T14:12:00.000Z	leo__		is this possible?
2006-04-18T14:14:00.000Z	FlannelKing	leo__	hmm, well, technically, yes.  If its easy... I don't know.  You'd have to ask someone who knows how it all works.  I know it's possible to make your own liveCDs with a grub menu and stuff, (we're not talking about ubuntu specific here), so.. yeah, I imagine it would be doable to pass arguments and have it not ask.  You'd want to ask the developers.  mailing list or whatnot.
