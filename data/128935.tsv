2007-07-05T10:17:00.000Z	mzanfardino		ok, I'm trying to install ubuntu feisty on a new AMD64 Athlon x2 machine.  Whether I choose the 32bit or 64 bit version, I only get as far as loading the liveCD when it seems something times out and I'm left with a busybox prompt and a message that bin/sh can't access tty.  Help!
2007-07-05T10:18:00.000Z	mzanfardino		anyone have any idea what to do when presented with a busybox shell and job control turned off?
