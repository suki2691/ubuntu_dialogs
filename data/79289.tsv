2008-09-16T06:07:00.000Z	daklan	tehboriz	are you familiar with the intel family of microprocessors? you'll notice most of them had the -86 suffix. 386, 486, 586 ... so on
2008-09-16T06:08:00.000Z	tehboriz	daklan	but why 86 lol
2008-09-16T06:08:00.000Z	daklan	tehboriz	beats me. if i knew, i'd probably own intel
