2006-08-05T16:41:00.000Z	DIguana		So does anyone know how to keep sshd from timing out on connections, or at least how to extend the timeout period to something like 30-60min?
2006-08-05T16:42:00.000Z	mcphail	DIguana	what are you connecting with?
2006-08-05T16:45:00.000Z	DIguana	mcphail	PuTTY, but it works fine for other servers.
2006-08-05T16:47:00.000Z	mcphail	DIguana	putty has issues and can be configured to behave better and not time out. The issue is partly with the software, partly with Windows and partly with the network, by the looks of it.
