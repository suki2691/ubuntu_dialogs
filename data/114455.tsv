2009-01-28T00:15:00.000Z	gavi		i am using ubuntu for since 7.10 was out and i like it very much, but theres alot of things in it which windows was much better at. for example when i save a document, it doesnt direct me imediatly to /home/user/Documents but thats just one small things. windows has alot of these small things which ubuntu dont have. Regardless ubuntu cant get screewed with spyware like windows can.. anyone can give me their thought on the topic
