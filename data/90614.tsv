2008-05-21T00:49:00.000Z	Meroveu3		this is perhaps a Gnome or Compiz Fusion issue, but I was wondering if anyone else using Ubuntu faces the same problem -- sometimes my window titlebars seem to dim even when active (has focus) -- the entire titlebar goes grey, the buttons and title text disappears
2008-05-21T00:50:00.000Z	Meroveu3		only if I hober my mouse over the titlebar, does it reappear (sometimes only for a while)

2008-05-21T00:50:00.000Z	Meroveu3	dpowerd	no, it's only the titlebar -- it basically shows as a clear space
