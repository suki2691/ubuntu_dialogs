2006-03-03T14:09:00.000Z	Drac[Server] 	unkn0wn2u	Which one has the better video card, and which one has acceleration supported?
2006-03-03T14:11:00.000Z	Drac[Server] 	unkn0wn2u	are you SURE it has acceleration supported? The drivers work? Run "glxgears -iacknowledgethatthistoolisnotabenchmark" and tell me the FPS.
2006-03-03T14:13:00.000Z	Drac[Server] 	unkn0wn2u	Um.. 'kay. I won't be around, but that plus the -iacknowledgethatthistoolisnotabenchmark thingy will give you FPS.
