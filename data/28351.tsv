2010-09-29T14:44:00.000Z	tukadafoonday		Hey guys - can someone help me out... I don't want 1 particular program to lock out the sound. Ie. If Rhythmbox is playing and i start a youtube video in chrome I want the option to turn Rhythmbox off without having to start my web browser again to capture the sound.
2010-09-29T14:44:00.000Z	tukadafoonday		is that possible?
2010-09-29T14:45:00.000Z	ceil420	tukadafoonday	use alsa instead of oss. but i thought pulseaudio allowed sound mixing :o does ubuntu not use PA anymore?
2010-09-29T14:46:00.000Z	tukadafoonday	ceil420	Thanks - where do i change it to alsa instead of oss?
