2009-11-14T18:57:00.000Z	rashed2020	jugglerbry	Same here. I just ALT+F2 then type xkill and click on the firefox window. That works much better.
2009-11-14T18:56:00.000Z	rashed2020	jugglerbry	try sudo killall firefox
2009-11-14T18:58:00.000Z	rashed2020	jugglerbry	Nah, I've been doing that since 8.04
