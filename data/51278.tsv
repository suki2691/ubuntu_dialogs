2010-07-10T03:10:00.000Z	veleno		hello. i'm following this guide http://blog.petersen.vg/post/237815372/debfile to build a deb. How do I do to install some files in the home directory of the user, instead of putting them in /usr/lib ?
2010-07-10T03:11:00.000Z	trism	veleno	you should not install files into users home directories with a deb
2010-07-10T03:12:00.000Z	veleno	trism	but is it technically possible?
2010-07-10T03:12:00.000Z	trism	veleno	yes, but you still shouldn't
