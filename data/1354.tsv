2012-09-08T08:30:00.000Z	leslie_		I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 on a tower that I have put together.  I boot fine, and all seems to be ok up to the point of connecting to the internet.  The wireless router tells me that I am connected, but firefox will not connect to any address, I don't know what I am doing wrong

2012-09-08T08:33:00.000Z	leslie_	hfic	I know but I have this computer connected and the wifes also, all are wireless I cannot seem to find out where I am dropping the ball.  All the puters are in the same location
2012-09-08T08:35:00.000Z	leslie_	hfic	all are connected thru the same router
