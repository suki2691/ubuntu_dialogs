2011-06-02T05:26:00.000Z	yassine_hell_	sabiancrash_cgx	so i should download this LSB 3.0 ?
2011-06-02T05:26:00.000Z	sabiancrash_cgx	yassine_hell_	According to their docs, yes, and according to your dpgk output, there are dependencies problems, maybe because of the mssing LSB 3.0
2011-06-02T05:27:00.000Z	sabiancrash_cgx	yassine_hell_	clear as day ---> Package lsb-core is not installed.
