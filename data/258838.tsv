2005-11-27T17:50:00.000Z	dooglus		I'm rebooting to Windows...  back soon.
2005-11-27T16:28:00.000Z	dooglus		I'm having trouble installing breezy dual-boot.  It can't resize the existing NTFS partition.  Is anyone experienced in such a field?
2005-11-27T16:29:00.000Z	dooglus		I tried resizing the NTFS partition using breezy's install disk but it told me "The resize operation did not create enough free space for the installation.  Resizing may have failed. You will have to set up partitions manually."
