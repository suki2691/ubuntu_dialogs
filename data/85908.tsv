2008-07-10T17:49:00.000Z	bushwakko		help! everything 3d uses 100% cpu on ubuntu 8.04 for me, with nvidia card. Also upgraded to 173. still the same, everthing seems to be working
2008-07-10T17:51:00.000Z	truemped	bushwakko	I nearly have the same problem... My X kind of hangs for a few seconds and then everything is fine again...
2008-07-10T17:51:00.000Z	truemped	bushwakko	what have you done so far?
2008-07-10T17:53:00.000Z	truemped	bushwakko	what is strange to me is that the CPU usage of X is very high while X hangs. Maybe its the nvidia driver in the repositories?
