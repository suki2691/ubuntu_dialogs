2007-11-24T02:24:00.000Z	bthornton		I'm trying to do a network install of Ubuntu (boot from a CD/USB stick, then point the installer at the network installation media).  However, the "mini.iso" that Ubuntu provides doesn't include the driver for my network hardware.  Any ideas how I can circumvent this?  (No, I don't have a floppy drive for the driver)

2007-11-24T02:28:00.000Z	rambo3	bthornton	i don't know maby you could find search newer mini.iso  that has that module
