2011-12-27T22:17:00.000Z	edbian	JohnJohn	most of the people who build / design virtual machines go to great lengths to make sure that isn't possible
2011-12-27T22:18:00.000Z	edbian	JohnJohn	sure
2011-12-27T22:20:00.000Z	edbian	JohnJohn	there is a such thing as side channel attacks, it's very complicated to pull one off and they are not very powerful
