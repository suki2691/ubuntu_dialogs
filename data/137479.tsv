2007-10-03T09:16:00.000Z	aschaetter		Hi all I've been trying to install sim city 3000 unlimited (native linux version) on feisty and i am have problems almost exactly like the person in here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=541215&highlight=sc3u     This sounds like an x server bug, but how could other feisty users install?
