2010-09-27T18:11:00.000Z	Wazzzaaa		Hey, I try to run a java process to listen on port 843 as nonroot. I installed/configured authbind but it still doesn't work. Any suggestions?
2010-09-27T18:11:00.000Z	Shaul	Wazzzaaa	is authbind the ones that let you use ports below 1024 ?

2010-09-27T18:12:00.000Z	Wazzzaaa	Shaul	that is what the package description says...
