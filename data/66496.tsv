2010-06-18T15:23:00.000Z	zacharysmith		does this mean I can't use 32bit Ubuntu on it?
2010-06-18T15:23:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	zacharysmith	no, it means that if you use 32 bit ubuntu, you will only be able to access 3 Gb of your memory, with a normal kernel
2010-06-18T15:23:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	zacharysmith	but like bazhang, you can use a PAE kernel to get all the memory available
