2011-10-28T19:31:00.000Z	bobweaver		Hello there !!    I am trying to write a script that when the konsole has not been touched for say 20 min  it asks  "shut me down BObweaver Please"  I figure that I would use the sleep command . but hove no clue how to go about this
2011-10-28T19:32:00.000Z	bobweaver		maybe notify-send ^^

2011-10-28T19:34:00.000Z	GirlyGirl	bobweaver	you mean terminate konsole the kde terminal app and not the pc?
