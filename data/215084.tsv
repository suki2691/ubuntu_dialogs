2006-07-11T16:09:00.000Z	SGershon		I am having some difficulty installing IE6 on wine (winetools). My symptoms are as in bug http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4975 .
2006-07-11T16:09:00.000Z	SGershon		I think that IE4 would suffice, but I don't see where/how to install it...
2006-07-11T16:11:00.000Z	kyncani	SGershon	why installing ie4 or ie6 ??
2006-07-11T16:12:00.000Z	SGershon	kyncani	I want to be able to run Outlook over wine to open PST files. No need to connect to exchange, only to open PST files.
