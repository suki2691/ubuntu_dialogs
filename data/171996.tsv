2007-07-10T06:44:00.000Z	MSIGuy		So I'm having troubles with my torrents.
2007-07-10T06:44:00.000Z	MSIGuy		I've got them downloading fine, but not uploading anything.
2007-07-10T06:44:00.000Z	MSIGuy		I've got the port for downloading unblocked, along with the tracker announce, any other things to check?
