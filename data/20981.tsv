2012-04-04T12:53:00.000Z	schnuffle1	whoaski	its a setup that is often used but has nothing to do with being secure or not. That depends on the apps you use and your specific configuration
2012-04-04T12:55:00.000Z	schnuffle1	whoaski	yes but you will find people telling you that nginx or lighty is the way to go so I only can say: It's a setup that has proved to work
2012-04-04T12:56:00.000Z	schnuffle1	whoaski	for security, check selinux, mod:_security, mod_thorottle, fail2ban, ......
