2012-05-15T20:48:00.000Z	auronandace	destinydriven	alternative has text based installer with a few mor features (lvm, raid, full disk encryption)
2012-05-15T20:48:00.000Z	destinydriven	auronandace	ahh thanks
2012-05-15T20:49:00.000Z	destinydriven	auronandace	I remember downloading and installing an alternate version and wondered what happened to the gui installer. Just wanted to be sure
