2006-07-20T08:48:00.000Z	phoez		Is there any filesystem more "resistant" to errors? I'm using reiserfs and have been having a lot of lockups lately due to overheating GFX card (nothing I can do till I get paid cept keep a big fan on the side of case) and it's killing my filesystem nearly every time.
