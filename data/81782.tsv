2008-09-21T19:33:00.000Z	xbxb	jim_p	 via an external (USB) harddrive
2008-09-21T19:34:00.000Z	jim_p	xbxb	you will MUST have it connected on every boot on each pc
2008-09-21T19:34:00.000Z	xbxb	jim_p	 I will, I'm more concerned about slightly different versions or configurations that may mess up my home folder
