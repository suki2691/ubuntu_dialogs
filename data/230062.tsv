2005-07-13T05:53:00.000Z	brad	nikkia	onkarshinde: im not sure if they are the same, most of the time its a cpu/a few components changed. broadcom is annoying and i didnt know the card reader was installed in that model. the version i looked at on the i-net had ipw2200 in it and that works fine (you can always change it)
2005-07-13T05:54:00.000Z	nikkia	brad	i wouldn't say ipw2x00 works 'fine', personally
2005-07-13T05:55:00.000Z	brad	nikkia	ok, i can say that i 50/50 agree with you......it for me at least with ubuntu it works great out of the box.....fedora on the other hand :/
