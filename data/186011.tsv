2006-09-27T12:12:00.000Z	scheuri		correction...not many normal users do this
2006-09-27T12:13:00.000Z	scheuri		I have a (probably quite stupid) question...its about different user/accounts on a machine...some accounts should be able to use application XYZ, some don't...how do I actually do that? (OOo for example, "john" may use it, but "henry" may not)
2006-09-27T12:14:00.000Z	tm	scheuri	use ACL?
2006-09-27T12:14:00.000Z	scheuri	tm	thought about that, but somehow it seems too much of a hassle just for this...
