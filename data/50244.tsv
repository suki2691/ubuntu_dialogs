2009-08-17T03:09:00.000Z	jonah1980	mrgenericuser	that doesn't specify 1366x768 anywhere so not sure how it'd help
2009-08-17T03:12:00.000Z	mrgenericuser	jonah1980	that shows how to override an edid on the vc, now where to get the edid file from, i'm still looking, and you might google edid resolution and your laptop.....
