2010-03-12T13:51:00.000Z	Jayant		does anybody know why does ubuntu live cd gives a permission denied error when i chose to "help me boot from cd" ??
2010-03-12T13:52:00.000Z	Slart	Jayant	huh? I've never seen that option when booting from a ubuntu live cd.. it's plain regular ubuntu?
2010-03-12T13:54:00.000Z	Slart	Jayant	oh.. it's probably a wubi thing.. never used that so I can't really help you
