2009-05-03T02:56:00.000Z	Quino		Can any of you tell me how to get avi files play on  Ubuntu? I can see the still previews but when I tried to play through totem & vlc, the programs open then close without playing anything
2009-05-03T02:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Quino	 try playing them from the terminal, also try mplayer/gmplayer and instll the ubuntu-restricted-extras package and perhaps the w32codecs pack.
2009-05-03T03:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Quino	 i just insgall gmplayer, and the w32codecs from medibuntu, and they normally work.
2009-05-03T03:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Quino	 its often an issue of the proper codecs being installed.
