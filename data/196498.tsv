2007-04-08T07:00:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	Henry_Bean	yes but you have to build a chroot setup first
2007-04-08T07:01:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	Henry_Bean	or runa virtual linux session in 32 bit mode
2007-04-08T07:02:00.000Z	Henry_Bean	Linux_Galore	oki, i thought that should be easy as change something link "arch" parameter :(, thanks
