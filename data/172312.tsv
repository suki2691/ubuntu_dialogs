2006-11-19T10:06:00.000Z	gza		sudo apt-get install konqueror....installs too much I think
2006-11-19T10:08:00.000Z	Aldoliel	gza	apt-get should install only what Konqueror needs, which is most of KDE
2006-11-19T10:09:00.000Z	gza	Aldoliel	yeah about 100mb of stuff, I just remember a while back that there was a way to get konqueror standalone. but no big deal
