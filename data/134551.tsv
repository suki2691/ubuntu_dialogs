2007-05-11T15:27:00.000Z	jacque1		hi folks.  i'm back again.  the links provided before were very good!  I tried everything and even checked the groups this time.  It appears that the audio group vanished.  Are there any particular things I need to do to get the audio group re-instated other than just "add" it using the 'users and groups' option?

2007-05-11T15:28:00.000Z	jrib	jacque1	did you log out and back in after doing that?
2007-05-11T15:29:00.000Z	jacque1	jrib	: no not yet.  Will try that shortly.
