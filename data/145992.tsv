2007-02-22T16:21:00.000Z	slipstream3d		Hi, does anyone have any idea what the difference between /blah/bin/ and /blah/sbin/ is?
2007-02-22T16:23:00.000Z	slipstream3d		so even though Squid *says* it should put the binary in /usr/local/squid/bin and it's in /usr/local/squid/sbin/, since it's being run by "root" anyway it should be ok?
2007-02-22T16:25:00.000Z	slipstream3d		oops, my bad
2007-02-22T16:26:00.000Z	slippyr4	slipstream3d	sbin should contain stuff for superuser only. bin contains regular system wide executables.
