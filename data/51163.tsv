2010-03-06T07:32:00.000Z	trism	AaronAaronAaron	you don't use empathy, you use a command line client such as irssi or weechat
2010-03-06T07:33:00.000Z	trism	AaronAaronAaron	you would need to sudo apt-get install irssi (or weechat), then you could run it, it isn't installed by default
2010-03-06T07:43:00.000Z	trism	AaronAaronAaron	you ssh into your remote system and run irssi, then /server irc.freenode.net and then /join #ubuntu and you're back here (screen is also useful)
