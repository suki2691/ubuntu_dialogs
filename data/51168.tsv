2012-09-12T03:35:00.000Z	trism	tambu	you need to enable normal upgrades: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QuantalQuetzal/TechnicalOverview/Beta1#Upgrading_from_Ubuntu_12.04_LTS (really more of a #ubuntu+1 issue though)
2012-09-12T03:37:00.000Z	tambu	trism	just to check can I safely do the upgrade from an SSH console? or do I need to boot into a recovery console? not sure if it updates ssh server during the upgrade might break something
2012-09-12T03:38:00.000Z	trism	tambu	you can upgrade over ssh, it usually isn't an issue
2012-09-12T03:39:00.000Z	tambu	trism	thx for the url I got the release-upgrades fixed.. here go nothing :)
