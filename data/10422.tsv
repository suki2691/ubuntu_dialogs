2012-06-05T21:34:00.000Z	wooy	olskolirc	its ykclient. If I try to uninstall the package, other packages are uninstall with it
2012-06-05T21:37:00.000Z	wooy	olskolirc	no its just yubikey client. The other dependant package is PAM module based on yubikey. I just need to make hot swap, i dont want all the other packages to be uninstalled with it.
