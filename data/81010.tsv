2008-09-01T22:26:00.000Z	Buyydee		Hi, I installed Gbrainy (some gnome brain trainer software) on my (English) ubuntu Hardy installation. Now I downloaded a German .po translation file - unfortunately, it comes without instructions. Where do I put it?

2008-09-01T22:28:00.000Z	Buyydee	test27	unfortunately not. I fear it's a module that needs to be used when compiling the programme. bad thing: I didn't compile it, I'm a repo monkey :)
