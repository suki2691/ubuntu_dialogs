2005-11-30T10:28:00.000Z	IcemanV9		i have an old box that i could try with fluxbox :)
2005-11-30T10:29:00.000Z	versipolis	IcemanV9	that would have been the smart thing to do but I just had to see the new gnome. I just removed gdm from init.d and now do the old startx at bootup
2005-11-30T10:29:00.000Z	IcemanV9	versipolis	ah. alright.
