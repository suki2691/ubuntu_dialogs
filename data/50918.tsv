2010-04-13T07:44:00.000Z	darolu	dcider	if your mike is a regular one (not a usb one... if such thing exist) it should work; your sound card may not be configured or something (hardware-wise) is not right; have you tried that microphone somewhere else? make sure you are using the right channels (analog/digital)
