2006-01-14T14:03:00.000Z	errr		Im getting ready to move from gentoo to ubuntu, I have a question about some of my spare disks. When I do the install to hda will I be able to keep the data on hdb and hde and hdf intact w/o problems, or would it be better to unplug those drives for the install then plug them in after?
2006-01-14T14:04:00.000Z	holycow	errr	plug them in after ... just in case
2006-01-14T14:04:00.000Z	holycow	errr	you will need to manually add them to /etc/fstab when you plug them in, but thats not a prob
