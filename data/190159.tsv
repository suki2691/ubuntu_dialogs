2007-03-30T09:51:00.000Z	MarkCh		help! i need a guide on how to network ubuntu to windows directly i.e. ubuntu -> cable -> windows xp
2007-03-30T09:52:00.000Z	MarkCh		windows xp says it cannot get an ip from a host, what does it mean? ubuntu doesnt report any problems.
2007-03-30T09:52:00.000Z	MarkCh		i think the cat-5 cable i have is a crossover cable enough already.
