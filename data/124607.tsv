2007-08-17T07:11:00.000Z	MBR666	NKUMike	 might be do to permissions on the windows machine, is it a windows 2000, xp machine?
2007-08-17T07:13:00.000Z	MBR666	NKUMike	make sure your ubuntu system is logged on with the same user, pass as the xp, vista machines
2007-08-17T07:13:00.000Z	NKUMike	MBR666	Is there a way to get around the same username password thing?
