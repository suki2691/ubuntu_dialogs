2008-12-01T09:38:00.000Z	WahbeN		Hi all!! I really want to test out KDE 4.1, am currently using Ubuntu distro 8.04 but I am considering installing Kubuntu 8.10. Anyone advises against it? How usable is KDE as a main desktop environment?

2008-12-01T09:42:00.000Z	__BSD__	WahbeN	KDE4 is pretty nice as well,,, ummm but personal i'd get Kubuntu 8.04 over Kubuntu 8.10
2008-12-01T09:45:00.000Z	__BSD__	WahbeN	for the long term support :)
