2008-01-26T09:17:00.000Z	syntaxerror55		because I wouldn't want to duplicate
2008-01-26T09:17:00.000Z	nickrud_	syntaxerror55	no, although it may have some of the games under different names. apt-cache show bsdgames lists them
2008-01-26T09:18:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	nickrud_	ah, k. I'm currently on my Windows partition, but I'll remember it
