2005-11-04T14:15:00.000Z	cfaun		Hello. I am interested in packaging multiple programs for both Ubuntu and Debian. Should I just submit it to Ubuntu and have them automatically go to debian (will they?), submit it to debian, and have then automatically go to debian (will they?), or submit them to both?
