I just ordered inspiron 1720 (wiping windows right away - I just need a big screen than 1420N's) in USA and need to know how AC adaptor's socket looks like before I receive it (in Europe).  is it like this?  http://muszek.mine.nu/temp/power1.jpg .  I'm talking about this socket: [laptop]  --- [socket - AC ADAPTER - this socket]  --- [wall]

2007-08-18T15:13:00.000Z	muszek	Pelo	I know, but I was told here yesterday that most laptops handle both 110 and 220/230.  take a look at my sister's laptop's AC (also bought in US): http://muszek.mine.nu/temp/power2.jpg notice it says "INPUT 100V-240V"
2007-08-18T15:14:00.000Z	muszek	Pelo	so I guess it will be similar... now all I need to know if Dell's adapters use the same sockets (anyone?  http://muszek.mine.nu/temp/power1.jpg )
