2009-07-30T15:31:00.000Z	MarkStoddart	NET||abuse	install the restricted extras
2009-07-30T15:32:00.000Z	NET||abuse	MarkStoddart	i have them, it gives me nvidia-glx-180 which is driver 180.44, i believe nvidia's drivers are up at 185.28.19, much newer with many fixes, and i have trouble with some opengl stuff with wine.. i was hoping newer drivers would help...
