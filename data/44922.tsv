2010-03-26T10:28:00.000Z	lateralus01		I'm having problems with my wireless card, intel 4965, the connection lags a lot
2010-03-26T10:29:00.000Z	lateralus01		it doesn't do this in vista
2010-03-26T10:29:00.000Z	lateralus01		it uses the module iwlwifi, specifically iwl4965 but for some reason that module isn't loaded
