2009-11-28T22:37:00.000Z	JoeBlacken	mikey	well, I don't think they will allow me to do so, and it takes a very long time.
2009-11-28T22:40:00.000Z	JoeBlacken	mikey	there must be someone here with ubuntu on a laptop that Ubuntu run on smoothly and the drivers are available
2009-11-28T22:43:00.000Z	JoeBlacken	mikey	yeah, I can buy directly from dell a ubuntu powered laptop, though it is not 9.10 but it is good, the thing is I want to get it fast, and that one will take around 8 days to ship and probably few more to get here.
