2005-09-29T05:29:00.000Z	Valo		is there any reason why after updating to kernel version 2.6.12-9 my boot and shutdown process is just a black screen?
2005-09-29T05:29:00.000Z	eazel7	Valo	perhaps a problem with the bootsplash
2005-09-29T05:30:00.000Z	eazel7	Valo	try removing the splash/framebuffer whatever be in the boot parameters, perhaps it's just that
2005-09-29T05:37:00.000Z	eazel7	Valo	no problem
