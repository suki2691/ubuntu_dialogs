2011-01-02T00:38:00.000Z	sprung		Hello. I am connected to my work VPN using nm-applet. Now, I want to connect to the datacenter VPN, which can only be done from within the work VPN. nm-applet won't let me try to connect to it, the VPN is greyed out. Does nm-applet only let me connect to one VPN at a time? What's going on here??
