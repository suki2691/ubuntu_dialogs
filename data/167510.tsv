2007-10-18T14:46:00.000Z	rgl	tonyyarusso	what changes?  aren't the images immutable?
2007-10-18T14:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	rgl	Nope - rsync can make minor changes to the images.  What those changes are varies, depending on final testing and such.
2007-10-18T14:47:00.000Z	rgl	tonyyarusso	ah.  you mean they are still rsyncing.  ok.
