2010-05-26T19:26:00.000Z	datacrusher		I use ubuntu 10.04, and now i got two monitors, both coneccted to the same vga, but everytime i boot, i have to go on settings > monitors and configure all over again so i can use an extended desktop, because it logs automatically with duplicated views. Its getting very annoying, how do i lock this configuration so i dont have to do it everytime i boot?
