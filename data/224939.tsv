2005-08-21T13:01:00.000Z	equex_		i'd wish my keyboard was functioning properly.. why on earth is keypresses getting stuck in the buffer and repeated endlessly for seconds, minutes.. people say nvidia is well supported on linux, but it seems only that applies to graphics cards or what ? i have a nforce2 chipset.. please help... a computer without even a functioning keyboard is a defunct one :(
2005-08-21T13:02:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	equex_	who said nvidia was well supported?
2005-08-21T13:02:00.000Z	equex_	hybrid_goth	everyone that happened to be listening when i complained about ATI
2005-08-21T13:03:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	equex_	all i have heard is that ATI is better support. thats what is in this iBook and it worked ootb
