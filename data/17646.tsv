2011-02-28T00:28:00.000Z	the_seraphim		i need to give myself full rw access to another users home directory without taking their permissions away and it has to be permenant
2011-02-28T00:30:00.000Z	coz_	the_seraphim	 when you gksudo nautilus  are you not able to go into their home directory?
2011-02-28T00:32:00.000Z	the_seraphim	coz_	its probably easier if i tell my mate to use a separate shared folder...
2011-02-28T00:33:00.000Z	coz_	the_seraphim	 ok that might work also
