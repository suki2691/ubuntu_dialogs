2009-08-03T08:05:00.000Z	dahlia		so is samba now the recommended way to share file systems between unix systems?
2009-08-03T08:05:00.000Z	Lunis	dahlia	it's per-person. i like ftp myself :P
2009-08-03T08:06:00.000Z	dahlia	Lunis	I mean I dont see much support for nfs and a lot for samba... so I assume everyone is using samba these days?
2009-08-03T08:07:00.000Z	Lunis	dahlia	personally i think that's because there's more demand for samba because of the amount of people networking at home between linux and windows boxes. i love nfs and i hate samba
