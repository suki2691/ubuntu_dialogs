2009-08-25T07:12:00.000Z	sudobash		Here is a question that has been bugging me for a while... If modified xboxes that run linux can play movies with nearly perfect picture then why does ubuntu jump and have distortion so much? Xboxes were 733 mhz and had 64 mb ram and my PC running Ubuntu is 20 times the power of this...
