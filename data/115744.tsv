2008-11-06T23:55:00.000Z	selinuxium	profxavier	Not sure... I believe it is because there wasn't 1.5Tb drives at the time of release and they have not been tested on the systems...

2008-11-07T00:11:00.000Z	selinuxium	profxavier	It is a possibility, but nothing that a BIOS upgrade would not resolve... PROBABLY! :)
