2008-12-06T22:16:00.000Z	wolfspirit	DavidCanarias	isn't there a properties button that defines that?
2008-12-06T22:16:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	wolfspirit	I opened Brasero and chose BURN AN IMAGE and no options at all about speed for burning
2008-12-06T22:17:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	wolfspirit	I will check what ActionParsnip: said too OK
