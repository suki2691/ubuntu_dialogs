2005-08-11T11:18:00.000Z	NicholasHill		does anyone know why after freshly installing ubuntu on my computer it doesnt work when booting and puts me back to the prompt, citing graphics not configured properly and to run gdm when i've configured stuff correctly?

2005-08-11T11:19:00.000Z	syntaxman	NicholasHill	Since X didn't run successfully, it disabled your gdm automatically
2005-08-11T11:25:00.000Z	syntaxman	NicholasHill	for the record, I think the reinstall is an unnecessary task.  But it also won't hurt anything.
