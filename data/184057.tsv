2006-06-01T06:14:00.000Z	Flannel	tested2	it does that by default.  the red highlight.
2006-06-01T06:15:00.000Z	tested2	Flannel	yeah but I only want it to highlight then
2006-06-01T06:16:00.000Z	Flannel	tested2	right, doesn't the text of the tab go red (as opposed to black) when you've been mentioned? (sorry, It's been a while since Ive used xchat)
