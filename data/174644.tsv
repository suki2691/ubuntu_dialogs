2006-10-17T12:40:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		Can anyone tell me how to burn an Audio CD with minimal effort from a bunch of mp3s, Ideal process would be like WMP10 (Open App > Add mp3s > select burn/before burning takes place the files are converted to wav for use in everyday cd players... Please tell me this is possible??
