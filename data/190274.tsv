2006-06-04T16:45:00.000Z	Warbo	freddy	gtkpod is pretty mature I think
2006-06-04T16:48:00.000Z	Warbo	freddy	iPod has it's crazy playlist system, but my Neuros player which just uses folders for playlists and you can drag'n'drop stuff onto it doesn't have that much playlist creation support (Amarok has some scripts but I haven't used them yet)
2006-06-04T16:49:00.000Z	Warbo	freddy	Just shows that popular, complex stuff has better support than simple, obscure stuff
