2009-07-26T04:12:00.000Z	Sarvatt		does anyone happen to know when the next ubuntu membership meeting for the americas might be? the wiki page says july 15th and I cant find any mention of the next date in the irc logs. -- https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/RegionalBoards/Americas

2009-07-26T04:17:00.000Z	Sarvatt	bazhang	thanks, i dont see anything on the fridge calendar for the next 3 months though. I guess I will look into applying through another country
