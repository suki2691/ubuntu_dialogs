2004-10-29T11:19:00.000Z	yfir	johnlevin	- a friend of mine did and afaik he had several problems. but i don't know details
2004-10-29T11:19:00.000Z	yfir		by 'several problems' i mean he eventually gave up
2004-10-29T11:20:00.000Z	johnlevin	yfir	ubuntu is apparently running out of disk space during the install
