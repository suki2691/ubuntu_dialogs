2007-05-17T05:21:00.000Z	dominik		does anybody know is there a way to force xchat to check group of ports while connecting with a server? for example ports from 6000 to 7000
2007-05-17T05:21:00.000Z	PriceChild	dominik	you can edit the server and add several groups of servers/ports to connect on
2007-05-17T05:22:00.000Z	PriceChild	dominik	for example I have one that checks my local ssh tunnel first, and then tries the "real" address
2007-05-17T05:24:00.000Z	PriceChild	dominik	add them as two seperate ones
