2006-03-17T08:13:00.000Z	whyami	Frogzoo	tried that. It hangs...
2006-04-07T08:57:00.000Z	Frogzoo	whyami	check the permissions & group of /dev/scd0 & copy across from /dev/cdrom
2006-04-07T09:01:00.000Z	whyami	Frogzoo	just tried it. The permissions were 777 for /dev/cdrom so that's what I set /dev/scd0 to. Still doesn't work, though.
