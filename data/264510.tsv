2011-05-04T21:22:00.000Z	nemo	baggar11	yes. irritatingly counterintuitive, but use middle mouse button
2011-05-04T21:22:00.000Z	nemo	baggar11	that shortcut reallly sucks on laptops, where it isn't exactly easy to hit both buttons on the touchpad
2011-05-04T21:22:00.000Z	nemo	baggar11	I usually resort to spawning the new app w/o using the dock
