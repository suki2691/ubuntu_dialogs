2007-06-15T14:54:00.000Z	iDN		Hi, I have a problem...
2007-06-15T14:56:00.000Z	iDN		I recently installed Enemy Territory. Every thing works fine except when I press a keyboard combination (which I don't know what it is), the player stuck in one direction. Any help?

2007-06-15T14:56:00.000Z	logmein	iDN	I've never experienced that problem myself, which key is it?
