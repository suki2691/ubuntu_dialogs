2008-05-11T07:52:00.000Z	Onyx		I've got a weird issue... for some reason, audio playback is consistently failing with smplayer (my preferred video playback option), but works just fine with mplayer.  Does anyone know how I might be able to fix this?

2008-05-11T07:53:00.000Z	Onyx	mgolisch	Where can I change that?
2008-05-11T07:53:00.000Z	mgolisch	Onyx	no idea, dont use that player
