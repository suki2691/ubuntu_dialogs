2007-03-26T13:26:00.000Z	Xinxin		another question: outbound irc connections are blocked by the firewall at my workplace. is there a way to access this channel, say over the web somehow?
2007-03-26T13:27:00.000Z	genii	Xinxin	You may be able to find some outise site running cgiirc
2007-03-26T13:29:00.000Z	genii	Xinxin	The cgiirc program is a web based interface to irc. But if you run it inside your firewall it still will be locked out of course. However you may find some site that lets you put int he server address, that is using this program
2007-03-26T13:34:00.000Z	genii	Xinxin	There is a cgiirc interface you can type in the server particulars here:  http://irc.oasis-open.org/cgi-bin/cgiirc/irc.cgi I just tried it with irc.freenode.net and it works fine
