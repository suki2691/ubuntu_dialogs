2005-01-30T07:15:00.000Z	geppy	keyshawn	 How did it crash?  Did it freeze?  Did X die?  Did you get "AAEEE!!!!!" from the kernel?
2005-01-30T07:23:00.000Z	geppy	keyshawn	 autocomplete?
2005-01-30T07:24:00.000Z	geppy	keyshawn	 Did it not get recorded in the history?  I wouldn't know of another way to look it up.
