2006-12-30T14:27:00.000Z	AlexC_	THEHso	I don't think it will tell you what socket, but if you can get hte cpu name/model and then do some googling, you'll find out what socket it is
2006-12-30T14:28:00.000Z	THEHso	AlexC_	- not really possible.. a friend of mine who no longer lives locally want to know.. his PC resets REALLY often, his bro thinks it's heat-related.. he wants to buy a new CPU fan, but there's no indication of a socket anywhere on the motherboard :(
2006-12-30T14:29:00.000Z	THEHso	AlexC_	- is there an app similar to CPU-Z, or perhaps Everest, native to Linux, or perhaps a way to get those to work via WINE preloaded onto a livecd?
