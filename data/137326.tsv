2008-05-11T02:02:00.000Z	cdeszaq		How can I make a "modprobe" command occur on system start?
2008-05-11T02:04:00.000Z	cdeszaq		﻿Pici: That directory does not yet exist, should I create it? and then, do I put the *.ko file itself, or a symlink to it?  The actual command is "modprobe ath_pci" to get my wifi card working
