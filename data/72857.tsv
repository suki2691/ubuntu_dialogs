2010-01-07T08:24:00.000Z	MrPockets		Is there any easy way to reset a user's password on an ubuntu box?
2010-01-07T08:24:00.000Z	MrPockets		without booting to removable media and editing shadow?
2010-01-07T08:24:00.000Z	MrPockets		and because it's in a VM, i'm having issues getting it into single user mode (not sure if that'll even help)
