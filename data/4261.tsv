2012-10-31T08:07:00.000Z	Gerowen		Why does Gimp from the Ubuntu repos only have XCF, Bzip and Gzip as formats to save images in?  I don't have JPG, PNG, BMP or anything.

2012-10-31T08:09:00.000Z	Gerowen	zombifier	Yeah I just noticed that while reading the Gimp help file, :p
2012-10-31T08:09:00.000Z	Gerowen	zombifier	Thanks though!
