2006-11-30T14:38:00.000Z	TGM		Can someone help me? Firefox and all Mozilla based web browsers I've tried randomly either crash on start up or crash when trying to download a site, this is a new issue and has only been bothering me since I installed Edgy. Help? :(

2006-11-30T14:40:00.000Z	CarlFK	TGM	Edgy enables some X thing that doesn't get along with flash.  there is a bug report, and I heard of a work around about 2 weeks ago
2006-11-30T14:40:00.000Z	TGM	CarlFK	Sometimes, though I've tried to completely uninstall them all, all mozilla based browsers and addition plug-ins for such and then reinstalling them with only their basic package and they just crash on start up now
