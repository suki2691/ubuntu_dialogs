2011-03-11T17:36:00.000Z	Tuxiscool		Hi. I've installed XP under VirtualBox on a 10.10 host, but XP is unable to connect to the net. I've tried setting up combinations of: a virtual adapter using NAT, a virtual adapter using "Bridged Adapter", and two virtual adapters, one of each. The devices always show up in the windows settings as not being configured (drivers not installed). Any ideas?

2011-03-11T17:38:00.000Z	Tuxiscool	DasEi	Can you tell me the right channel? & It's currently using one of the Intel interfaces... i'll try some others.
