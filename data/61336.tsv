2009-10-01T14:21:00.000Z	ursus		Hello! I have a DVD image (iso), and I would like to burn it. The problem is, that the iso file is a little bit larger than the capacity of my disk. How could I solve it? I tried DVD95, but it crashes when builds up the new iso file. I tried vamp also, but I couldn't give an iso file as a source file for compress the dvd.

2009-10-01T14:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ursus	it'll be fine
