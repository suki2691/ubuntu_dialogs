2007-10-22T04:56:00.000Z	foug		ok 7.10 is giving me a few problems. I keep getting a lot of odd tasks that boost my CPU usage to 20-90%. Some of them are "pdftotext" or "trackerd" and even a root task after i installed something. I never had any of these tasks hogging my cpu usage in 7.04.

2007-10-22T04:56:00.000Z	foug	lufis	where at?
