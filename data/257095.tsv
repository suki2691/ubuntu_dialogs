2007-08-11T08:09:00.000Z	Don9307		What is wubi?
2007-08-11T08:11:00.000Z	Don9307		So wubi runs ubuntu as guest rather than Windows as guest under ubuntu.  Correct?
2007-08-11T08:13:00.000Z	Falstius	Don9307	you can use vmware or colinux to run linux instead your windows install.  vmware is the easier of the two but less geek cred
