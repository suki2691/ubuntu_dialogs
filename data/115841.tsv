2008-10-26T00:41:00.000Z	Nvidiot		aww MAN! Finally got my ubuntu working and I realize I used the 32-bit cd while I need the 64-bit one :/
2008-10-26T00:42:00.000Z	mortal1	Nvidiot	do you like your codecs and plugins?
2008-10-26T00:42:00.000Z	mortal1		if you do, I'd recommend the 32bit
2008-10-26T00:42:00.000Z	Nvidiot	mortal1	it'll be a raid network server box so no codecs needed
