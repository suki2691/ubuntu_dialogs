2007-05-27T13:05:00.000Z	Sebs		Excuse me guys, I just downloaded the Ubuntu CD image, burnt it, and even though the internal CD check says it's ok, the installation fails due to a faulty cd at 69ish percent. I tried following the instructions depicted here ( https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromWindows ) but it's no good. Any ideas on how I can install Ubuntu with the Iso I have, from my own Hard drive? Thanks so much.
