2009-03-02T04:13:00.000Z	tswicegood_	erUSUL	the files are still there, I just can't execute mv or ln -s to get them back in place
2009-03-02T04:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	tswicegood_	well seems logical when the exe trys to load the shared libs it needs that fails... you have to find a way to get a static compiled mv or ln...
2009-03-02T04:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	tswicegood_	but given that the system is remote ... i can not think how to do that
