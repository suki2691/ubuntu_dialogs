2006-06-13T11:16:00.000Z	hastesaver	acke_	mplayer or xine
2006-06-13T11:16:00.000Z	hastesaver	acke_	sure you can. mplayer <filename> -subfile <subfile> (or was it -sub? )
2006-06-13T11:17:00.000Z	hastesaver	acke_	but use xine if you're comfortable with it already. It's better in some ways, and worse in others.
