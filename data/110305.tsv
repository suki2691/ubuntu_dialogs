2008-03-02T02:38:00.000Z	igge		what can i do if i want to remove a package but the remove scripts have somehow been lost?
2008-03-02T02:39:00.000Z	DRebellion	igge	reinstall it first
2008-03-02T02:40:00.000Z	igge	DRebellion	hm how do I do that? dpkg --install <file> tries to remove the old one first
2008-03-02T02:41:00.000Z	igge	DRebellion	reinstalling it is exactly what I want actually.. :)
