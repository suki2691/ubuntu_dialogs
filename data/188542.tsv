2006-05-04T11:26:00.000Z	drumline_	vinboy	live cd doesn't install.
2006-05-04T11:27:00.000Z	vinboy	drumline_	oh ic... i tot I can install from a live cd :D
2006-05-04T11:27:00.000Z	drumline_	vinboy	live cd is for testing and other non-install purposes...   great for folks who want to try linux without the commitment.  :)
