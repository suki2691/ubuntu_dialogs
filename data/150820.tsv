2007-01-25T16:51:00.000Z	humblerodent		My system is crashing constantly and randomly.  Total crash, without any response from mouse or keyboard AT ALL.  I just upgraded to wifi so I thought that was doing something, but then I went back to my old wired card and am still having the same problem.
2007-01-25T16:51:00.000Z	humblerodent		I'm pretty sure it's a hardware issue though, as I've never had this problem with Ubuntu after years of using it, and have tried reinstalling the OS several times.
2007-01-25T16:51:00.000Z	humblerodent		all my fans appear to be running normally.  Any help?  TIA
