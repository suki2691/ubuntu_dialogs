2008-04-27T17:16:00.000Z	Ziroday	pjv	made by different companies/corporations , they each have different features and are both argueble over which one is faster
2008-04-27T17:17:00.000Z	pjv	Ziroday	which do you prefer?
2008-04-27T17:18:00.000Z	Ziroday	pjv	erm me, well I dunno really. I suppose I use vmware more because its meant to be slightly quicker. specifically on windows computers but I could be wrong. Have been meaning to try virtualbox again
