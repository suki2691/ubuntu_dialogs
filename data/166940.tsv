2006-12-05T09:10:00.000Z	Barry_		Hey, I just wiped my Hoary laptop to put  Edgy on it, and I'm really stoked about most of what I've seen. But I'm missing a few things. Anyone know where the Apple ] [+ screensaver is available?
2006-12-05T09:12:00.000Z	Barry_		Also, Edgy seems to not have an IRC client installed by default. (I'm on a M$ box at the moment.) What's the best general-purpose IRC client for Gnome?
