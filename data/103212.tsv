2008-01-21T11:58:00.000Z	_c		i installed xmlto. that required apache, somehow. ubuntu actually started apache like a complete idiot. uninstalling xmlto doesn't seem to make aptitude realize that apache isn't needed anymore, even thoug i say to remove useless dependencies. how to fix?
2008-01-21T11:59:00.000Z	Flannel	_c	you said you wanted xmlto, Ubuntu installed apache because it needed it.  Its not stupid
2008-01-21T11:59:00.000Z	_c	Flannel	*starting* apache without permission is nuts.
2008-01-21T11:59:00.000Z	Flannel	_c	apache starts by default when you install it.
