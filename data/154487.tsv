2008-05-05T19:13:00.000Z	ZaphodBeeblebrox		Greetings. A very simple question: Is there a way to search the command history in shell? I mean I've ran a command in shell a couple of days ago and I'd like to retrieve the same command.

2008-05-05T19:13:00.000Z	nemo	ZaphodBeeblebrox	... you closed the shell that you ran the command in since then, and opened a new one, right?
