2006-04-15T15:35:00.000Z	saik0	evader	try being as specific as possible
2006-04-15T15:41:00.000Z	evader	saik0	I did apt-get install amule. It's installed. Now, I clicked on the ED2K tab and did 'get server list', and it says the server list is in the incorrect format
2006-04-15T15:42:00.000Z	saik0	evader	I've never used amule. But I'm sure thats much more likey to get a response from somebody who can help.
