2011-05-07T17:33:00.000Z	Utopiah		so I just plugged an old Canon i550 printer but lsusb doesnt show anything
2011-05-07T17:34:00.000Z	bazhang	Utopiah	check linuxprinting.org for that printer
2011-05-07T17:36:00.000Z	Utopiah	bazhang	thanks but even before looking for a driver support, it has to be physically visible on the USB bus anyway no?
2011-05-07T17:38:00.000Z	bazhang	Utopiah	I'd check the linuxprinting.org site first
