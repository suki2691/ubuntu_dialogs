2010-01-19T18:41:00.000Z	Darael		Has anyone got any idea why Firefox is segfaulting every time I try to launch it in Karmic? It was fine yesterday...

2010-01-19T18:43:00.000Z	Darael	arand	Thanks for the tip, but it segfaults with -P too!
2010-01-19T18:43:00.000Z	arand	Darael	ah, then it's probably something else, and I'm as clueless as you.
