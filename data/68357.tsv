2009-01-22T12:11:00.000Z	szer0		Hey I am wondering what ubuntu/linux kernel does if bad memory is detected (eg if it puts data in memory then it turns out corrupt) do programs crash or kernel freezes or what?
2009-01-22T12:12:00.000Z	Kevin`	szer0	yes, unpredictable crashes is the usual result
2009-01-22T12:13:00.000Z	Kevin`	szer0	although saying that the bad memory is "detected" is a little innacurate in the crash case. if you have something like ecc ram where you can actually detect problems, it won't crash
