2005-09-05T08:13:00.000Z	djur		anyone willing to give me some insight as to an error message I received when trying to install ubuntu?
2005-09-05T08:13:00.000Z	djur		I'm getting "unable to install coreutils" when it's installing the base system
2005-09-05T08:13:00.000Z	lunitik	djur	if you state the error... someone might be able to help...
2005-09-05T08:14:00.000Z	lunitik	djur	if its installed anyways... don't worry about it... dpkg -l coreutils | grep ^ii  shows it?
