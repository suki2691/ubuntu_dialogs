2007-02-27T11:49:00.000Z	marx2k__	matt1234	 i dont know that it does
2007-02-27T11:50:00.000Z	matt1234	marx2k__	i found someone port scanning me, and he's running a dns server.... probably running a bot farm or something
2007-02-27T11:52:00.000Z	matt1234	marx2k__	 to answer your question, the port scans that got past my router were all above port 32k
