2007-12-25T06:06:00.000Z	the_darkside_986		hey everyone... how can i convert a CD into mp3's? yes i would militantly defend ogg vorbis, but this is for my mom whose mp3 player doesn't like that format. any ideas?
2007-12-25T06:07:00.000Z	the_darkside_986		lame keeps saying that the wave is not in 32 bit format. i'm trying to perform lame on wav files...
2007-12-25T06:07:00.000Z	the_darkside_986		actually, the message all mp3 encoders give me is: "<file> is not in 32, 44.1 or 48 kHz!" but i'll try the Grip program thanks
