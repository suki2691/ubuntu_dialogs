2010-07-29T02:29:00.000Z	davidm777		I'd really like to RTFM, but I'm not sure what to even search for... what do I lookup to find out how to get rid of old/unnecessary Kernels (they show up in GRUB, for example)?  Or even just to understand what's going on with Kernel updates (does the old version 'go away', etc.)?

2010-07-29T02:31:00.000Z	davidm777	KE1HA	wow, thanks!  I don't even need to search :-)
