2006-09-05T13:00:00.000Z	Ma|el		no ideas why dd of /dev/mem does not work with dapper?
2006-09-05T13:01:00.000Z	Warbo	Ma|el	What is that meant to do? corrupt the data in RAM?
2006-09-05T13:03:00.000Z	Warbo	Ma|el	If "sudo xxxxxxx" even says permission denied (sometimes stuff in /proc says that) then "sudo -s -H" followed by "xxxxxxx" usually works
