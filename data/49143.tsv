2009-09-05T11:44:00.000Z	_theWarrior	thinkertinker	must be some setting/config issue I guess
2009-09-05T11:45:00.000Z	thinkertinker	_theWarrior	i enable it in the settings manager..but it disables itself(i.e the check box clears by itself)
2009-09-05T11:46:00.000Z	_theWarrior	thinkertinker	are you running the latest version of ccsm?
