2008-08-04T01:14:00.000Z	confy_		anyway i got it... thanks KlrSp1
2008-08-04T01:14:00.000Z	qr	confy_	grep -e / egrep interprets regular expressions differently than regular grep
2008-08-04T01:15:00.000Z	qr	confy_	for example, in regular grep you need to escape ('s and )'s to form groups, whereas you don't using egrep
2008-08-04T01:16:00.000Z	confy_	qr	i just wanted to ask for examples :) well i get it// it only interprets regex differently...
