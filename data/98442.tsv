(I am running 9.04 and I was running it before too) it seems like my CPU is always above 60% even when I am not running any big programs (top shows that Xorg is taking a constant 15%!!)

2009-10-09T11:30:00.000Z	snowy	DigitalKiwi	the command is somthing like /usr/X11%6/bin/X : 0 -br -audit 0 -auth /bar/lib/gdm/L0.Xauth -nolisten  tcp vt7
2009-10-09T11:30:00.000Z	snowy	DigitalKiwi	that's what htop shows to be using ~15% of the cpu (although the total cpu usage it shows is 60%)
