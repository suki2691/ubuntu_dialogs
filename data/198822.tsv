2006-04-07T15:49:00.000Z	ompaul	possie	that depends on what your trying to install - what is the program you want? and what your talking about may kill your box in new and interesting ways
2006-04-07T15:50:00.000Z	possie	ompaul	well the package mythgame , now this depends on a wrong package so i'm trying to force the installation without letting it check for that certain dependency
