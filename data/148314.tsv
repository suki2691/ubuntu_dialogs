2011-06-19T23:02:00.000Z	adamonline45	dr_willis	hehe... Good idea!
2011-06-19T23:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	adamonline45	 if the system detexts a disk error.  as a safty feature it will remounte it read only. the dmesg logs should mention any issues.
2011-06-19T23:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	adamonline45	 so if you see it suddently going 'read only' open up a term and check the output of the 'dmesg' command
