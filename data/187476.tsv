2010-11-09T00:19:00.000Z	x_or		I really screwed up my ubuntu system by accidentally using a debian repo.  It looks like python-minimal and/or python are screwed up.  It was recommended that I download those packages from http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/python2.5-minimal, but I cannot find a download link.  Does anyone have a suggestion, even for a different direction?
