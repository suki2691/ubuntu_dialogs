2006-07-08T06:43:00.000Z	blackline		I have this other cordless keyboard that first have worked, but now last weeks it just refuses to work properly. Lots of the characters don't work, for example I get digits when I write about half of the letters. What shall I do? I really need this keyboard to work. Just tried it at my neighbours and it works normally there.
