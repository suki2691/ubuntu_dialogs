2012-05-15T06:21:00.000Z	Dawn262		my VLC died an ugly death.  Please, how do I kill it from the terminal?  Is has my CPU at 100% and won't let go, or let me see the logfile on what it is hung up on.
2012-05-15T06:21:00.000Z	EvilResistance	Dawn262	 killall vlc?
2012-05-15T06:21:00.000Z	EvilResistance	Dawn262	 or killall -9 vlc if the first command doesnt work
2012-05-15T06:25:00.000Z	EvilResistance	Dawn262	 i dont recommend always using killall -9
