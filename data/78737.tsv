2008-09-26T07:17:00.000Z	randomlogic78		I would like to prevent users from logging in via ssh and allow only users in a particular group.  I've edited /etc/ssh/sshd_config  and added the line "AllowGroups groupname" but any user can still ssh

2008-09-26T07:18:00.000Z	J-_	randomlogic78	 change the ssh port
2008-09-26T07:18:00.000Z	randomlogic78	J-_	why would that help?
