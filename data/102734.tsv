2009-09-03T00:56:00.000Z	pluffsy		I have problems with a crashing server and I have very little idea of what is causing it and where to look. What should I check more than syslog?

2009-09-03T00:57:00.000Z	pluffsy	lenswipe	yeah I've done that. but can't really find anything special. it says almost all ram is used but I can't find processes that use those ram. :/
