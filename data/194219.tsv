2006-06-16T13:34:00.000Z	wweasel		Hey, anyone know much about fonts in Linux? I imported some from my windows partition, but they don't have the variations (Windows doesn't really require them). Linux does, so I can't use bold/italic with them.  Can I create the required font variations from the base font? I know OO.o is doing this automatically.
2006-06-16T13:36:00.000Z	wweasel		Could someone help me? I'd like to convert an rpm to a deb file. "sudo alien xxxxx.rpm" right? I get a message "Command not found"
