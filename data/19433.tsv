2011-02-02T21:23:00.000Z	kmck		Hello, so i have a gateway laptop that i decided i wanted to try ubuntu on... unfortunately when i installed ubuntu i choose to completely override my existing OS which was windows 7 and replace it with ubuntu instead of running it side-by-side... now i'm starting to regret it... while i love Ubuntu very much, i want to switch back to windows. Now, I contacted gateway and they gave me a link to buy a disk that would include the OS, drivers, pre-instal
