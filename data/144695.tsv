2010-06-28T19:21:00.000Z	rubbs	Andy-at-home	do you want anyone to be able to write to it or just you?
2010-06-28T19:23:00.000Z	rubbs	Andy-at-home	then I would suggest you change the ownership like this chown username:username /var/www/html/mydirectory
2010-06-28T19:24:00.000Z	rubbs	Andy-at-home	ls -l will do it
