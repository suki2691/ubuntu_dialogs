2010-11-17T10:19:00.000Z	Spoofy		I have an issue that just came up recently.
2010-11-17T10:19:00.000Z	Spoofy		I had installed ubuntu, and then made another partition and then installed windows 7, however windows 7 removed ubuntu from my bootloader. I tried following guides online with the use of the ubuntu live CD, but it never worked out and I kept getting errors.
