2008-08-25T23:41:00.000Z	Totakeke		Alright, I can't access an older IDE drive on an old computer (probably my fault, but I got all of my important files and it was too slow to do anything) and the CD drive doesn't work. I can't boot from a USB device, either. Is there a way to get Linux onto that computer without putting the old HDD into this (my new) computer?
2008-08-25T23:43:00.000Z	Totakeke		So how do I install Linux on an old PC where I can't use the Live CD, Live USB, or even the hard drive?
2008-08-25T23:45:00.000Z	sorin-mihai	Totakeke	try a distro that has a floppy as a boot media with some internet stuf on it, and then try to install from the internet. i would buy a new pc :))
2008-08-25T23:46:00.000Z	Totakeke	sorin-mihai	Way ahead of you, built this one about a month ago. :P I was trying to install it on the old one for a friend because it was just soooo slow with Windows and other crap on it
