2008-12-27T14:04:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cn28h	no.. big difference
2008-12-27T14:04:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cn28h	what if he had flash installed, bunch of extensions, had a lot custom bookmarks, ect
2008-12-27T14:05:00.000Z	cn28h	onetinsoldier	fair enough, I'm guessing his problem was he initially ran firefox as root which is why root owned .mozilla
2008-12-27T14:06:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	cn28h	could be, perhaps he used sudo -c. i use sudo -i to avoid such problems
