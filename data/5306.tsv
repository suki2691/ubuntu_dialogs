2012-02-24T09:25:00.000Z	Ian-Moone		I am running Ubuntu LTS, and often times I will click on something, and capslock and scroll lock will flash and the computer will lock up. What do I do here, and how do I prevent it?
2012-02-24T09:26:00.000Z	Ian-Moone		has anyone else had my problem, or is there something I just did massively wrong?
2012-02-24T09:27:00.000Z	L3top	Ian-Moone	What else do you have attached to USB?
2012-02-24T09:30:00.000Z	L3top	Ian-Moone	is it just a normal install, or are you running something "unusual" on it? Something which might be scanning USB... say for media or something.
