2006-04-14T09:28:00.000Z	djs_2_6		Hey all, I am having trouble with my dvd burner.  I wrote a dvd+rw by copying the files to the dvd folder, and then right clicking in the folder and saying write to disc.  Now, the disc will unmount and mount, but not eject.  I have an NEC-3500AG burner.  Can anyone PLEASE help me??!?!?
