2009-07-22T02:05:00.000Z	losher	Scunizi	usually you can run dmesg and look at the last dozen or so lines to find the mount point. Wanna paste them to pastebin for us?
2009-07-22T02:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	losher	thanks.. I'll look first.. should be evident I would think
2009-07-22T02:07:00.000Z	losher	Scunizi	good....
