2010-03-12T02:57:00.000Z	erik__		I'm having some problem with Ubuntu failsafe X "running in low graphics mode" .. Does anyone have any pointers to docs?
2010-03-12T02:57:00.000Z	dstaubsauger	erik__	what exactly did you do what made ubuntu switch to the failsafe mode?
2010-03-12T02:58:00.000Z	erik__	dstaubsauger	:-) ooh this and that. The problem is I want to figure out what went wrong...
2010-03-12T02:58:00.000Z	dstaubsauger	erik__	what exactly? installed a new graphics driver?
