2008-12-26T20:07:00.000Z	Zmajci	onetinsoldier	thanks. I already reconfigured xorg.conf to default (even screen on vesa)... so I hope it must be gnome.. wish me luck.. thanks folk
2008-12-26T20:07:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Zmajci	for example...  cd ~/ && rm -rfv .compiz .gconf* .gnome* .gstream* .gvfs .nautilus
2008-12-26T20:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Zmajci	ok, good luck!
