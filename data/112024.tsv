I wished to upgrade to 11.04 and the easiest way seemed to be installing them "side by side." Well, I did. No matter how careful I thought I was with the password, I couldn't get into 11.04. I went to try to install over it and the only option the Ubuntu installer gave me was to wipe out

I have a wireless router driver issue to fix, but that's not the point.) The point is that I've got three copies of Ubuntu installed and three file systems. I only want two of them, and the installer didn't automatically pull in my previous files and such. Could you please (a) help me remove one of these excess 11.04 installations and (b) see
