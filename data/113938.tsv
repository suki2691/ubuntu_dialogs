2007-11-15T09:40:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	helpyhelperton	i never fooled with it cuz i always thought it was above my hardware, quite surprising.  haven't tried it with kde yet, thats next :)
2007-11-15T09:40:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	helpyhelperton	or maybe something lighter even
2007-11-15T09:41:00.000Z	helpyhelperton	PokerFacePenguin	I was messing with beryl for a while before compiz fusion and I never had trouble with it.. Im kinda sad they lost the name Beryl though because I found a street called Beryl and I felt oh so special
