2008-02-01T14:03:00.000Z	VvWolverinevV	cwillu	do you know the difference between fuseblk and ntfs-3g?
2008-02-01T14:04:00.000Z	cwillu	VvWolverinevV	off the top of my head, I believe fuseblk is the userspace filesystem api, which ntfs-3g (among other projects) uses so they don't have to mess around with kernel modules
