2010-04-27T06:23:00.000Z	norbi905		A little confused.  So theres this thing called GTK, and then Metacity.  I would like to change some themes around, but what is it that i'm looking for?  Whats the difference between them?  Some themes require GTK2, how can I find out what I have.  This is off of Ubuntu 9.10 minimal install.  Any help is apreciated.
