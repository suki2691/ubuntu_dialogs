2011-07-04T22:07:00.000Z	lxs-makoto	th0r	i sort of get it, how would i tell the packet forwarding to forward where i want it to go?
2011-07-04T22:08:00.000Z	th0r	lxs-makoto	ok....you need to figure out what you want to do. If you want to forward everything from one address to another, I think you can do that with route. But if you want to do NAT you do that in iptables
