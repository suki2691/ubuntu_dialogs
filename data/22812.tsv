2010-11-12T19:44:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	Twiggy|worx	making a server out of netbook, let alone on a home network, is never a good idea. :\
2010-11-12T19:46:00.000Z	Twiggy|worx	Sir_Konrad	All I really want to do is access my mythweb, but every inbound port is blocked so I was going to use hamachi to get into my networ, but that seems to not be workign also.  Which is why I thought about try this after what rob_p suggested
2010-11-12T19:46:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	Twiggy|worx	oh ok. :D
