2012-02-20T10:26:00.000Z	Etherael		Getting very sluggish performance in oneiric running in virtualbox with opengl / compiz, I recall it being a lot faster than this (feels around 15 fps) am using 2x HD6950 so it definitely isn't the hardware
2012-02-20T10:26:00.000Z	Etherael		I remember a fix something like vsync in compiz config but I only see vblank now and ita ppears to do nothing.
2012-02-20T10:26:00.000Z	Etherael		anyone have any idea?
