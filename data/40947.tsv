2009-12-15T08:13:00.000Z	jmyers1		ok, I officially want to stab my eye with a spork.
2009-12-15T08:14:00.000Z	jmyers1		I'm TRYING to install the drivers for my ATI Radeon HD 4850.  I downloaded the drivers from the amd website.  I've ran this thing every way I can think to run it.  From the GUI, to the command line interface with --makeandinstallpkg Ubuntu/karmic switches.  It just locks up right after displying the Ubuntu symbol for a few seconds.
2009-12-15T08:15:00.000Z	Billiard	jmyers1	any reason you dont wanna use the drivers from the ubuntu repositories?
2009-12-15T08:16:00.000Z	jmyers1	Billiard	wasn't aware there were any.
