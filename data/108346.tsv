2008-03-06T16:31:00.000Z	Amerio		guys how can I change the networking settings /etc/network to stop connecting auto
2008-03-06T16:31:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Amerio	remove the 'auto eth0' or whatever
2008-03-06T16:32:00.000Z	Amerio	Frogzoo	: does it make any difference if I remove everything in the interfaces?
2008-03-06T16:34:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Amerio	no, unless you want to manually up the interface
