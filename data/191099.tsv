2007-11-03T08:22:00.000Z	docgnome		I just installed Gutsy Gibon and am having problems with getting my sound card working. I have an onboard sound card that works fine but I can't get any sound out of my Sound Blaster.
2007-11-03T08:22:00.000Z	docgnome		it seems to be detected, but no sound comes out
2007-11-03T08:22:00.000Z	regulate	docgnome	you probably need to reconfigure the kernel to enable that
2007-11-03T08:23:00.000Z	docgnome	regulate	how would I do that?
