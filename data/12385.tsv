2011-07-24T22:44:00.000Z	Alia		Hi, I'm trying to use me Bluetooth headset with Ubuntu 11.04. Pairing and connection to the device works, but I can not find any way to transfer the sound to the headset within the Sound preferences dialog.
2011-07-24T22:44:00.000Z	zykotick9	Alia	in the hardware tab of sound preferences do you see bluetooth listed?

2011-07-24T22:45:00.000Z	zykotick9	Alia	that's certainly an issue then.  Sorry, I got nothing - BT either worked OOTB or I had no success with it.  Best of luck.
