2009-09-18T00:59:00.000Z	kasansweat		Does anyone know of a directory comparison tool (like kompare/meld, even diff or a script) that allows you to compare ONLY on filename and filesize -- and not by reading the file? I have two extremely large mp3 folders to compare, and if it reads each file individually, it will literally take days. Thanks!
2009-09-18T00:59:00.000Z	neglesaks	kasansweat	does man diff offer you any such options?
2009-09-18T01:00:00.000Z	kasansweat	neglesaks	- I don't believe so, but I'm not 100% sure.
2009-09-18T01:01:00.000Z	kasansweat	neglesaks	- diff's man page is pretty scant, I've also been looking elsewhere.
