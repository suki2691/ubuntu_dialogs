2009-06-21T03:01:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		'cause I kind of need to transfer files from my ZEN to my computer, unfortunately, no Windows app recognizes them and rhythmbox isnt available for windows
2009-06-21T03:02:00.000Z	SiDi	GodfatherofEire	try to get their website, and then see if there is an irc channel listed there
