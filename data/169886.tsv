I have a question, it is this: I've just started using pidgin, and I realize this: when I am paying attention to chats, noises drive me nuts, if I turn them off however, I neglect my conversations with friends.  is it possible to make a script that would make a noise when a message containing a certian string is received?  This functionality seems to be available for chat (chimes on detecting username) but not for IM.

2007-12-19T11:52:00.000Z	zoexii	macogw	will that work with a compiled version?  (the one in packages wasn't compatible with my employer's jabber service)
2007-12-19T11:54:00.000Z	macogw	zoexii	umm....you can do "apt-get source pidgin-libnotify" and then compile that.  because no, the binary wouldnt recognize your compiled one
