2007-12-09T00:58:00.000Z	meoblast001	Raiden	remake it... make;sure you capitalize the D
2007-12-09T00:58:00.000Z	meoblast001	Raiden	if that doesnt work... restart your session
2007-12-09T01:01:00.000Z	Raiden	meoblast001	I did it, didn't work. Looks like GNOME uses only the one in the trash, it seems logical that it can't copy icons on it.
