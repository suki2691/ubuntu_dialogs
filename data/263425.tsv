2004-12-18T17:07:00.000Z	__learner___		is there any problem in removing the ubuntu-desktop package. I trying to install updated xine and it says it will remove ubuntu-desktop. I've got a bit scared because of the package name. Will anything bad happen if I remove it?

2004-12-18T17:07:00.000Z	ctd	__learner___	ubuntu-desktop is just a meta package.
2004-12-18T17:09:00.000Z	ctd	__learner___	yeah
