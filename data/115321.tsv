2009-07-31T09:18:00.000Z	Etherael		on a dev team with a bunch of people that use tortoise svn 1.6.3, the version of svn that comes with ubuntu 9.04 is *ancient* is there a way to get the latest release of svn without going through the whole source building rigmarole?
2009-07-31T09:20:00.000Z	mneptok	Etherael	have you enabled the backports repo?
2011-09-08T18:51:00.000Z	mneptok	Etherael	cp is not a good backup tool. especially when it's invoked as a non-root user ;)
2011-09-08T18:52:00.000Z	Etherael	mneptok	I invoked it as root
