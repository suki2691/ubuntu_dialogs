2008-08-23T08:13:00.000Z	cshadowrun	mrtech2122	do you have wine installed?
2008-08-23T08:14:00.000Z	cshadowrun	mrtech2122	http://www.winehq.org/site/download-deb follow these instructions
2008-08-23T08:16:00.000Z	cshadowrun	mrtech2122	after you've installed the latest version of wine using those instructions, look up the game you want to play on http://appdb.winehq.com there will be instructions on how to get it setup.
