2007-12-28T15:11:00.000Z	Wander_w	cbx33	If I recall correctly; in the partition table
2007-12-28T15:12:00.000Z	Wander_w	cbx33	and there probably is a configuarion file for initialisation in /etc
2007-12-28T15:13:00.000Z	Wander_w	cbx33	yeah, could allso be in a magic sequence of bytes at the start of each partition
