2007-08-05T16:28:00.000Z	eldkraft		is there any good way to see allowed connections in the firewall, firestarter let's you see blocked but those are not interesting.
2007-08-05T16:29:00.000Z	TtyS2	eldkraft	i would prefer to see whats closed as there are 65535 ports in all
2007-08-05T16:31:00.000Z	eldkraft	TtyS2	depends, I made an nmap and I know that only a few are open, now I would like to see a list of allowed connections. Blcoked gives me nothing as those are already sorted out..
