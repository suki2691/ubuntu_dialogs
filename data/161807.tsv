2006-11-04T08:09:00.000Z	Farm_Fresh		Alright.... when I first installed ubuntu 6.06 in august... I needed to do the ndiswrapper work around to use the netgear wireless adapter.. And just this week after not liking Edgy, I did a clean install of Dapper after formatting the entire drive and today the wireless adapter worked right after installation.. ie out of box sort of..  How is this possible?
