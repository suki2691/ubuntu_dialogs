2005-09-11T16:21:00.000Z	daveb_		Can anyone possibly help me? I'm completely screwed here, I can't even boot my old system back up
2005-09-11T16:21:00.000Z	Quinthius	daveb_	what OS is the old system? XP?
2005-09-11T16:22:00.000Z	Quinthius	daveb_	have an XP install cd? should be able to boot from it and go into recovery console, then use fixmbr
2005-09-11T16:24:00.000Z	Quinthius	daveb_	well boot from it and in the first screen there should be an option for recovery console. do that, and then run "fixmbr", then exit/reboot from hard drive. should get you booting into windows
