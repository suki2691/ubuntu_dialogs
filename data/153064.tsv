2007-06-28T07:35:00.000Z	chadeldridg2		Is there any ftp client out for ubuntu that is similar to FlashFXP ?
2007-06-28T07:37:00.000Z	chadeldridg2		Can anyone suggest a ftp client other than gftp .. it sucks horribly
2007-06-28T07:37:00.000Z	chadeldridg2		thats even worse
2007-06-28T07:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	chadeldridg2	maybe you can run the windows ftp client you prefer in wine?
