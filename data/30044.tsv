2011-01-31T08:06:00.000Z	Da_Wrecka		Oh yeah, while I'm here; I've also run into a rather annoying problem; Basically, I once set my netbook's power scheme to Performance, and shut the netbook down some time after. Now, every time I boot Ubuntu, it starts in Performance, even if I set it to Conservative or Ondemand before I shut down. Anyone have a fix?
