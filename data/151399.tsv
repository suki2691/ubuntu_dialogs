2008-05-15T02:36:00.000Z	sten_	yaman	imho, 8.04 still needs a bit of work before it's as stable as 7.10.  (for me, on my laptop.  My server runs MUCH better with 8.04...and in fact, I need 8.04 for the tape drive to work)
2008-05-15T02:37:00.000Z	yaman	sten_	, Broadcom : so what should install now ? the 7 or the 8 ?
2008-05-15T02:39:00.000Z	sten_	yaman	if you can, why not download the live CDs for both, and then test wireless and suspend with both 7.10 and 8.04?  If neither works better, than you might as well go with 8.04
