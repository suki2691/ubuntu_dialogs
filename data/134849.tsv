2007-06-07T07:16:00.000Z	kenthomson		I setup the plugin as "Generic Audio Player", i left those two pre-mount and post-mount fields blank, then i pressed connect in "media devices" and it connected fine. But when i tried to transfer a track it said "Media Device: Copying file:///home/ken/video MJ songs/number ones 2003/19-Michael Jackson - Man In The Mirror.mp3 to file:///mnt/iaudio-u2// failed". Please help.
