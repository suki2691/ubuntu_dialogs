2008-04-17T13:56:00.000Z	DJones	mamazi	its just a bit quiet at the minute, you might have to try again a bit later on
2008-04-17T14:00:00.000Z	DJones	mamazi	there's a mention of it on ubuntuforums that somebody edited theirs, they found it in arch/i386/kernel/syscall_table.S: Does that help at all?
2008-04-17T14:02:00.000Z	DJones	mamazi	Possibly /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kernel/syscall_table.S
