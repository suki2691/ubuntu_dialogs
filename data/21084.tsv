2011-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	stealthc		setup an ftp server, problem solved, it's less hassle than setting up a share and mounting it.
2011-01-01T07:49:00.000Z	stealthc		no windows computers can see ftp just fine right from the browser window
2011-01-01T07:50:00.000Z	blud	stealthc	but ftp is not a good solution because i'm dealing with large files and it would use my internet connection right?
