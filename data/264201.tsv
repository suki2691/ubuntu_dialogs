2005-02-25T10:33:00.000Z	Grev		Does anyone here use Ubuntu as a server (web, samba, ftp)? what do you think of it?
2005-02-25T10:34:00.000Z	jk	Grev	i'm using it as a small-traffic lamp server on an amd64, works fine
2005-02-25T10:34:00.000Z	Grev	Neil3	web is what I'm most interested in
2005-02-25T10:34:00.000Z	jk	Grev	you can use the 'custom' install to not install X and so on
