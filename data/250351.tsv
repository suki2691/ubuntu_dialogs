2005-10-05T07:56:00.000Z	kurtbec		thunderguy: is breezy good and stable at this point
2005-10-05T07:57:00.000Z	kurtbec		I ask because I'm probably going with kubuntu since I typically lean more towards kde than gnome although i don't have a good reason why.
2005-10-05T07:58:00.000Z	apokryphos	kurtbec	because it's better, perhaps 8)
