2008-03-31T05:36:00.000Z	arthurmaciel		is there a way to see if a hard disk has bad blocks on ubuntu? fsck does the job?
2008-03-31T05:37:00.000Z	LjL	arthurmaciel	there is a command "badblocks"
2008-03-31T05:37:00.000Z	LjL	arthurmaciel	have you considered, however, monitoring your HD's state using the SMART sensors? (the "smartmontools" package can be used to query them)
