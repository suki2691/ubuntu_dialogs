2005-05-12T13:54:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	mikail	if you want to delete, you might as well use chmod 777 filename
2005-05-12T13:54:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	mikail	that gives full rights to everyone on the file.
2005-05-12T13:55:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	mikail	try typing "man chmod" to get more info about how to use the command
