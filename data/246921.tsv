2009-11-09T01:31:00.000Z	cyrus_mc		so I run Gentoo and want to try out Ubuntu MOblin remix on my netbook. However, there is no usb-creator package for gentoo so how do I copy the ISO to a flash?
2009-11-09T01:31:00.000Z	cyrus_mc		I tried unetbootin to create the flash but that didn't appear to work
2009-11-09T01:32:00.000Z	cyrus_mc		any help would be appreciated
