2006-07-07T08:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	zheny1	 whats to tweak? its a text file
2006-07-07T08:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	zheny1	 i cant recall ever messing with .xsession, i tend to use .xinitrc for when i use 'startx'
2006-07-07T08:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	zheny1	 i think some kdm/gdm/xdm programs have a entry that will read/run the .xsession.
