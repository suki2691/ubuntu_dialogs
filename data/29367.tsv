2010-07-20T07:22:00.000Z	BigC		How many processors would show up under ubuntu for this processor? AMD Phenom II X3 Triple-Core P820. 3 or 6?
2010-07-20T07:23:00.000Z	SNN	BigC	if you're using ubuntu on that machine, cat /proc/cpuinfo and check. I'd assume three, considering it's a triple-core system, X3 usually refers to the cores, from what I see, anyways.
2010-07-20T07:24:00.000Z	BigC	SNN	I am not using that computer, but I was thinking about buying a computer that had that type of processor, and just wanted to know if it would register as 3 or 6?
2010-07-20T07:25:00.000Z	SNN	BigC	as said, I assume 3. Check the tech specs from the place you're looking to buy it from, they should have more information available :)
