2008-12-06T15:24:00.000Z	reenignEesreveR		* i need to upgrade subversion to 1.5. apt-get 'install subversion' says it is already up to date iwth newest version. Though installed version is 1.4. Any ideas?
2008-12-06T15:24:00.000Z	Ubendu	reenignEesreveR	Wouldn't it just be 'apt-get update subversion'
2008-12-06T15:26:00.000Z	reenignEesreveR	Ubendu	No, update is different. it doesn't take any param
