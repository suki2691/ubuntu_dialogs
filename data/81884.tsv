2008-08-21T06:08:00.000Z	Theaxiom		Hello, I shrunk my system partition on my harddrive that has Vista on it. I am at the partitioning part of the Ubuntu install, and I am wondering how I would use the unallocated space on the hard drive to install Ubuntu for dual-boot. I want to make sure not to overwrite my Vista partition, or I will be screwed. Can anyone help me please? Thank you.
