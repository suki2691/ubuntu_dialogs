2008-08-14T04:12:00.000Z	Kernel		how can i force a program to run in the background? its currently running in a console?
2008-08-14T04:13:00.000Z	ladyfantasy	Kernel	one way is to start the process with "nohup"
2008-08-14T04:13:00.000Z	Kernel	ladyfantasy	see the program is already running..and i need to log out then back in...without it stopping
