2009-03-10T20:19:00.000Z	rsteenwyk1		I just upgraded to 9.04 for the fun of it, but now VirtualBox is giving me an error when I try to boot up my XP Guest. It tells me to run /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup as root, which I do, but that gives me an error as well, tells me to look at /var/log/vbox-install.log. The log shows "/etc/init.d/vboxdrv: 342: /usr/share/virtualbox/src/vboxdrv/build_in_tmp: not found"
2009-03-10T20:19:00.000Z	rsteenwyk1		any idea on what I should do here?
