2010-04-08T07:37:00.000Z	W43372		I've noticed something odd since switching to Karmic. The notification area that usually appears under the clock to inform me of new messages, completed downloads, etc. It's appearing two inches below where it's supposed to and just kind of floats there. Anybody heard of this?
