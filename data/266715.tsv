2010-01-04T07:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	parkandstop	 select gnome at the GDM login screen..
2010-01-09T01:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	parkandstop	 depends on what it is . .bin is a generic extension tht means very little.
2010-01-09T01:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	parkandstop	 if its an executable   chmod +x whteever.bin   then ./whatever.bin
