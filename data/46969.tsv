2010-09-06T06:19:00.000Z	ChogyDan	dlp211	you don't need one
2010-09-06T06:19:00.000Z	ChogyDan	dlp211	then just make one with whatever you need.  xorg.conf is no longer needed, but you can make one to override the defaults
2010-09-06T06:21:00.000Z	ChogyDan	dlp211	should be the standard spot, /etc/X11/xorg.conf
