2005-04-24T14:57:00.000Z	pointwood		how do I get those nice ubuntu wallpapers they produce each month? I've installed ubuntu-artwork and ubuntu-calendar, but most of the wallpapers are missing :(
2005-04-24T14:58:00.000Z	Burgundavia	pointwood	there might be a bug related to that
2005-04-24T15:06:00.000Z	pointwood	Burgundavia	found the bug I think: https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=8721
