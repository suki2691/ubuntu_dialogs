2005-03-19T12:53:00.000Z	jnk	airox	weird I'm sure there used to be a possibility of editing gnome menus by right-clicking in them but now I try and there is no option for that... certainly they can be edited manually in gconf or something but that's not handy

2005-03-19T12:56:00.000Z	jnk	airox	file a bug in bugzilla.ubuntulinux.org
