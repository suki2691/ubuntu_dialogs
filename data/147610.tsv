2008-09-30T17:13:00.000Z	Slart_	choonming	I'm not sure if there is one easy package.. what kind of file sharing protocol do you want to use? windows file sharing? nfs? ftp?
2008-09-30T17:14:00.000Z	Slart_	choonming	then you'll need an ftp server and nfs server respectively
2008-09-30T17:16:00.000Z	Slart_	choonming	well.. ftp, nas and the rest will work.. but it might be slow depending on what you want to do with it
