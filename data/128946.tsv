2007-07-08T15:33:00.000Z	ilikec0ws	Nutubuntu	Thats the only reason why I have chose say gentoo and like arch over ubuntu, cause with them I  dont have to install an absolute load of stuff that im never going to even touch
2007-07-08T15:34:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	ilikec0ws	 well - you *don't* ... you just gotta know how :)
