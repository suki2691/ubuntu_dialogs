2005-05-29T07:45:00.000Z	anto9us		acpi suspend to ram stopped working for me after installing fglrx drivers for my radeon 9700, my screen trashes and the system locks, anyone know how to fix it?
2005-05-29T07:46:00.000Z	bob2	anto9us	is it supposed to work at all with the binary drivers?
2005-05-29T07:47:00.000Z	anto9us	bob2	it doesn't work with binary drivers?
2005-05-29T07:47:00.000Z	bob2	anto9us	I'd be surprised if it did
