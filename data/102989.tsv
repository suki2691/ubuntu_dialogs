2009-11-19T17:30:00.000Z	histo		Pichi:based on your specs I would recomend xubuntu or something lighter
2009-11-19T17:31:00.000Z	Halitech	histo	xubuntu isn't much lighter then ubuntu anymore
2009-11-19T17:31:00.000Z	histo	Halitech	sure it is. Xfce compaired to gnome is still a huge difference.
2009-11-19T17:32:00.000Z	Halitech	histo	XFCE is lighter then Gnome but Xubuntu includes alot of things Ubuntu has so the full desktop isn't much lighter, doing a minimal install of XFCE will be lighter but not Xubuntu
