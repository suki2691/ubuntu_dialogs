2006-06-09T16:25:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	Nullified	Can you not just select gnome session with gdm
2006-06-09T16:26:00.000Z	Nullified	h3sp4wn	 I select the account "Nullified" click login and it spews a message at me saying that I've been connected less than 10 seconds, and then takes me back to the accounts page
2006-06-09T16:26:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	Nullified	Change the session type (I don't use gdm so I can't tell you exactly how to do it)
