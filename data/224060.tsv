2006-02-23T16:14:00.000Z	kameron	whyameye	i don't use gnome, but there should be an 'autostart' directory somewhere in .gnome. in kde it's at ~/.kde/Autostart
2006-02-23T16:16:00.000Z	whyameye	kameron	there's no autostart directory named as such there, but you gave me a good lead. Thanks!
2006-02-23T16:17:00.000Z	kameron	whyameye	good luck
