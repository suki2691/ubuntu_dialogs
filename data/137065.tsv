2007-05-21T09:57:00.000Z	Gerro	ThePioneer	what do you like to do with a computer?
2007-05-21T09:58:00.000Z	Gerro	ThePioneer	might want to install totem and grab all the gstreamer codec packages, grab adobe flash and sun java to install for browser, get direct rendering going for your graphics card..
2007-05-27T15:45:00.000Z	Gerro	ThePioneer	look up gstreamer and install every damn one of them
