2010-09-13T20:39:00.000Z	bobstro	Bithound	 what you're describing will mount it on boot automatically, but i believe the hotplug usb mounting is different. i've been trying to do the same with an esata drive recently.
2010-09-13T20:40:00.000Z	bobstro	Bithound	 sorry i don't have specifics for you, but i don't think that's an /etc/fstab fix. there's a lot on the forums though.
2010-09-13T20:43:00.000Z	bobstro	Bithound	 there are posts indicating floppy modules can interfere. do you have a floppy drive?
