2010-03-15T04:18:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	sqwertle	you might want to check out fontforge (never used it personally)

2010-03-17T05:32:00.000Z	sqwertle	ZykoticK9	ChogyDan: It doesn't seem to be able to do that. Even after mounting the ISO it cannot find any boot media and has no option (that I've seen) for just running an ISO.
