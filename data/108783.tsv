2010-02-26T23:03:00.000Z	rifter		<Ferran> I am trying to arrange to synccontacts & calendar between *buntu & a Smartphone.  I did a bunch of reading, and there seems to be all sorts of bad feelings/opinions between Opensync, SymcML, KDE. No on-time releases, not clear what works and not, and so on.
2010-02-26T23:03:00.000Z	rifter		<Ferran> Is it even possible?  I would think SOMEBODY does it already.
