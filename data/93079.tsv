2008-04-28T01:13:00.000Z	mrbird	h4mx0r	i sometimes have no sound, cant play two sounds from separate apps at once
2008-04-28T01:14:00.000Z	h4mx0r	mrbird	after upgrading to 8.04 I had no sound because it registered 2 sound cards for some reason, I blacklisted one and now it works great try pastebin lsmod | grep "snd" and let me check
