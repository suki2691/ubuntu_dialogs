2011-06-10T11:21:00.000Z	joseph__		Hey all, I've been on 11.04 since release and I'm getting constant reproducible crashes of X when I switch from a secondary user account to the primary. I'm running an nvidia geforce 9500GT with driver 173.14.30.   Can anyone help?
2011-06-10T11:22:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	joseph__	you mean you log out of one account and then into another and X crashes?
2011-06-10T11:23:00.000Z	joseph__	noisewaterphd	it only happens if I try to fast switch from the secondary to the primary, or if I log our of the secondary. I get a scrambled screen that looks like chopped up pieces of a screen grab of the secondary account.
2011-06-10T11:25:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	joseph__	sorry, I can't really help, I was just asking because I had a lot of problems with X on 11.04 when I tested it out on my desktop with ATI. Very similar stuff to what you have going on. I didn't even bother to troubleshoot though, went back to 10.10
