2008-07-17T04:04:00.000Z	piece		i am about to do a bare-bones install, if i use my hardy mini.iso image can i just replace "hardy" with "intrepid" in /etc/apt/sources.list, aptitude update && aptitude upgrade and i'm good to go?
2008-07-17T04:04:00.000Z	piece		i will have only the cli installed when i do this
