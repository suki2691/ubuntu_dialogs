2011-01-21T11:51:00.000Z	greppy	Ahrotahntee	you can use cygwin X11
2011-01-21T11:51:00.000Z	Ahrotahntee	greppy	I see that, but between that and XMing, which would you say is more popular/reliable
2011-01-21T11:52:00.000Z	greppy	Ahrotahntee	I've never used xming, the only free one I have used is cygwin.
