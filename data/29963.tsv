2010-08-12T09:28:00.000Z	bofh80	LinuxFetus	thanks for the LOL. seriously i laughed man. PDF = Adobe = Freeze lol. no seriously is it a  fresh document your doing or opening an exiting pdf
2010-08-12T09:29:00.000Z	LinuxFetus	bofh80	Yeah, it's an existing PDF... that was probably made by an automated process.
2010-08-12T09:29:00.000Z	bofh80	LinuxFetus	try messing about with a fresh document to see if the same stuff starts happening
