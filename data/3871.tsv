2012-04-22T02:33:00.000Z	malik__	MirkoKa	i am not hating you... because I am messing withthis problem for last three days. No caps locks issue. and as i said at one time it works and at another it does not. For example: The session i am currently working in I need to try a dozen times before i could login
2012-04-22T02:38:00.000Z	MirkoKa	malik__	ok, so does your password work with sudo commands in a terminal window? this is just a very wild guess, but perhaps it's an input device problem. have never seen anything like this.
