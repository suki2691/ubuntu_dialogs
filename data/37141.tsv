2011-01-09T22:54:00.000Z	kinks		when I print multiple pages, rather than printing them all immediately one after another, my printer is pausing for a long period of time between each page. I have a Samsung ML2010, the latest version of CUPS, and I'm on 10.10 desktop. What might be causing this? I'm printing from evince..
