2010-03-27T17:45:00.000Z	Penguin_Guy	psycho_oreos	you mean instead of 'Penguin_Guy has disconnected', I could have something like 'Penguin_Guy waddles off'?
2010-03-27T17:46:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Penguin_Guy	yeah for example, though on various irc clients it would display in various fashions for a standard quit message
2010-03-27T17:47:00.000Z	Penguin_Guy	psycho_oreos	I see, thanks! Just gonna test this out.
