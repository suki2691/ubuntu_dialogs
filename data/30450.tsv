2010-06-10T08:30:00.000Z	sikihava		can anyone tell me why my *.deb package installer is showing previous versions of a package that i am trying to install as being in conflict?  it used to install right over the old versions.

2010-06-10T08:33:00.000Z	sikihava	tucemiux	just saying that the old virtualbox version is in conflict when i try to isntall the new version.  but this seems to be happening with other *.deb packages, too
2010-06-10T08:35:00.000Z	tucemiux	sikihava	what is the actual error that you are getting when attempting to install the actual *.deb package ?
