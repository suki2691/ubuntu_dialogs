2006-06-23T11:54:00.000Z	usama		i read about ajax but i am still confuse about it, can anyone tell me about ajax in easy words that what it is and whats its purpose?
2006-06-23T11:55:00.000Z	Flannel	usama	ajax is javascript, basically.  javascript that updates the html.  this isn't the place for this sort of question however, #ubuntu-offtopic would be more appropriate
2006-06-23T11:56:00.000Z	usama	Flannel	ok thanks
