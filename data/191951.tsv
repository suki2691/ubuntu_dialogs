2006-04-10T07:09:00.000Z	hellz_hunter		i know this isnt kubuntu, but i have a question about installation (since i believe they are both the same thing)
2006-04-10T07:10:00.000Z	hellz_hunter		has anyone had any troubles during installation where xwindows gets started and instead of running the necessary desktop environment, you get stuck with the grey test window with a mouse pointer in the middle?
2006-04-10T07:11:00.000Z	orbin	hellz_hunter	that is X iirc
