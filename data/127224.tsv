2007-07-23T12:28:00.000Z	lladar		Someone please help me with my graphics issues.  I am using Intel Mobile 945GM/GMS/940GML Extreme as my graphics engine but when I play games it dosn't work up to code.  Are their special drivers for Ubuntu that I need to be aware of?

2007-07-23T12:30:00.000Z	lladar		Fine, but what exactly do I have to do?
