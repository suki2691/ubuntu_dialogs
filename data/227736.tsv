2006-01-05T08:48:00.000Z	ben_underscore	raymond	in what way can you not open it?
2006-01-05T08:51:00.000Z	ben_underscore	raymond	have you installed the sun java or the blackdown one?
2006-01-05T08:52:00.000Z	ben_underscore	raymond	what does the file look like? is it a .sh file? if so, you need to run it as an executable in the terminal
