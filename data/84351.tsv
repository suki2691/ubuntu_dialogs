2011-06-22T21:56:00.000Z	SpiLoT		I've 2 partitions, C and D. C being Windows 7... I've recently installed Ubuntu via Windows 7 on the D partition.  Now I can't view the 'root files' on D however when I switch to Windows 7 I can clearly see everything in place in D. I've tried to access the folder 'root' in Ubuntu, but it gave me 'You dont have the permissions... bla bla bla"
2011-06-22T21:56:00.000Z	SpiLoT		I want to be able to view the root files on the D using Ubuntu.

I... argh, for example, D has a folder called 'Movies' in the root, when I switch to Ubuntu, I can't view the folder (can't litrally see it) but rather just see the usual Ubuntu files (root... home...etc)
