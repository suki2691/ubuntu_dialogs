2011-09-16T22:03:00.000Z	escott	VampsDaBeast	don't know much about nvidia. you probably have 2 because they keep the older nvidia drivers around for people whose cards are not supported by nvidias newer drivers
2011-09-16T22:04:00.000Z	VampsDaBeast	escott	my card is newer, its the gt 220. i was finally able to get teh newest driver installed but now, i have 2 nvidia x server settings in my system options menu.
