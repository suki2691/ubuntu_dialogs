2012-02-04T10:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	QaDeS	crashes?  someone earlier renamed there ~/.mozilla and it seemed to correct there issue, but lost there settings (something in the settings might not be compatible with firefox 10)
2012-02-04T11:00:00.000Z	QaDeS	zykotick9	didn't work :(
2012-02-04T11:04:00.000Z	zykotick9	QaDeS	the repo probably no longer has the older version though, so going back might not be possible.  Specific to your question, see "/msg ubottu pinning" for pinning details.
