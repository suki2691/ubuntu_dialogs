2010-06-11T00:52:00.000Z	shadows090		I did a fresh install of ubuntu 10.04 server (first install) with ubuntu-desktop added via apt-get, and my mouse is not functioning properly. i tried cat /dev/input/mouse and it works on there. i did another fresh install with kde instead of gdm with the same problem. anyone know what the problem could be?
2010-06-11T00:53:00.000Z	Docteh	shadows090	is it not functioning at all or wonky
2010-06-11T00:54:00.000Z	shadows090	Docteh	it's not really a concern since it's a server so I'll just configure it and leave it, but I'm quite curious if anyone may know what would cause that
2010-06-11T08:27:00.000Z	Docteh	shadows090	is there a console app to mess with power management? i just have minimal gui apps
