2008-07-13T19:12:00.000Z	gpd		My laptop has a weird acpi issue - when on it freezes until you move the mouse or press a key then starts again fine. acpi off is not ideal - where should i look? blacklist options? newer kernels? bios options?

2008-07-13T19:19:00.000Z	gpd	rockenrola	I found the acpi debug pages and there are several options for the kernel which i will try now
