2005-03-31T07:06:00.000Z	optiks		hi. I'm trying to get x running, and I keep getting 'no devices found' error .. I've ran the 'configurer' quite a few times and have had no luck ... my gfx card is a PCI-e nvidia 6600gt .. has anyone got any ideas as to what could be the problem?
2005-03-31T07:07:00.000Z	aspuru	optiks	have you tried using the nv driver first?
2005-03-31T07:07:00.000Z	aspuru	optiks	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg (or something like that?)
2005-03-31T07:08:00.000Z	optiks	aspuru	that's correct, I've tried xf86config, too
