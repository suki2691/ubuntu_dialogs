2007-07-17T06:21:00.000Z	zolty		Hi there, I am a fairly new user.  I am using a pvr 150 tv capture card and I never seen video0 appear in the dev folder, I am using 7.04 64bit.  Everything I read says this card should be supported by the kernel, it is not a pvr1600.  Could someone please tell me what it means when i can see the device in the hardware manager but it does not show up in /dev/?

2007-07-17T06:24:00.000Z	BashBang	zolty	: did you look in /proc?
2007-07-17T06:28:00.000Z	BashBang	zolty	: check   dmesg   /var/log/Xorg.0.log      see if any thing is seeing it
