2007-08-26T05:14:00.000Z	smoddy		can anyone tell me how to start Kubuntu in text mode?
2007-08-26T05:14:00.000Z	Scunizi	smoddy	you could ask on #kubuntu if no one here knows.
2007-08-26T05:15:00.000Z	smoddy		or how to install a package from repositories without going through the normal boot process
2007-08-26T05:15:00.000Z	smoddy	Scunizi	I suppose I could... I don't want to load a desktop environment, so I guess it's the same as ubuntu?
