2007-08-08T13:34:00.000Z	Flannel	ZAKhan	don't use it.  Install normal Ubuntu, since support is good.
2007-08-08T13:35:00.000Z	ZAKhan	Flannel	 just want to know how to activate the 3d GUI
2007-08-08T13:35:00.000Z	Flannel	ZAKhan	And we don't know.  This isn't an Ubuntu Ultimate support channel, you'll have to ask the guy who puts it out.  Check his website.
