2007-11-24T04:12:00.000Z	mogra		what -dev package contains the xlib library lXext?
2007-11-24T04:13:00.000Z	mogra		has anyone in here successfuly compiled Cedega from CVS, then?
2007-11-24T04:14:00.000Z	bruenig	mogra	here is a build script on arch linux that builds from cvs, you won't be able to use it, but you should be able to read it and use the commands: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cedega-cvs/cedega-cvs/PKGBUILD
2007-12-04T08:38:00.000Z	bruenig	mogra	it is not unlikely, I know in the past ubuntu has had a hard time compiling mplayer libraries with all necessary functionality. And of course since vlc is just a front end for mplayer libraries...
