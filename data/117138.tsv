2007-12-03T02:55:00.000Z	Biohazard		I have a question: when I switch to the console (Ctrl Alt F1) and login, I am inside the console. When I press backspace now, there comes a loud beep. How can I turn this beep off?
2007-12-03T02:55:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Biohazard	Go to System -> Pref -> Sounds the last tab,
2007-12-03T02:56:00.000Z	Biohazard	Odd-rationale	this is already deactivated. This works only for a terminal.
2007-12-03T02:57:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Biohazard	Oh, yes. I'm sorry. There is a command, however. But I forgot what it was...
