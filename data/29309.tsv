2010-07-08T19:26:00.000Z	Guest47854		<-- mouse and keyboard freeze @ ubuntu 10.04 (need help)
2010-07-08T19:27:00.000Z	rystraum	Guest47854	What triggers the freezes, do you have any idea?
2010-07-08T19:34:00.000Z	rystraum	Guest47854	Do you have any more information beside the freeze? And when does it happen? At boot?
