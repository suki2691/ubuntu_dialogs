2007-04-26T16:03:00.000Z	mc44	Ambience	my MAC address got messed with in feisty, it may be your problem
2007-04-26T16:04:00.000Z	Ambience	mc44	Is there any way that I can find out for sure if that's the issue?
2007-04-26T16:05:00.000Z	mc44	Ambience	you can run ifconfig and see if it matches your old MAC address? :)
