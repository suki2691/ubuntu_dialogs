2005-09-15T11:20:00.000Z	AdmiralCrunch		Will I get the same results from "apt-get dist-upgrade", as I would from installing the new CDs?

2005-09-15T11:22:00.000Z	nalioth	AdmiralCrunch	yes, dist-upgrade after you modify your sources.list will fix you up (when the time comes)
2005-09-15T11:27:00.000Z	nalioth	AdmiralCrunch	i'd wait a couple weeks
