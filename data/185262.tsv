2006-05-23T11:03:00.000Z	Mysta_	GeorgeAScott	do you want a GUI or just a terminal
2006-05-23T11:05:00.000Z	Mysta_	GeorgeAScott	if you are doing it from another ubuntu box, you can go to applications -> Internet -> Terminal Server Client
2006-05-23T11:09:00.000Z	Mysta_	GeorgeAScott	should be fine, all my clients are DHCP'd right now
