2010-03-08T00:46:00.000Z	RedNifre		Hi! Ubuntu is the right OS for me, but a friend of mine has very special requirements. Do you know a good site where I can compare different distros?
2010-03-08T00:47:00.000Z	ikonia	RedNifre	that's offtopic for here, but look at distrowatch.com
2010-03-08T00:48:00.000Z	ikonia	RedNifre	no problem, #ubuntu-offtopic maybe useful for you to use
2010-03-08T00:49:00.000Z	RedNifre	ikonia	thanks, I'll check it out.
