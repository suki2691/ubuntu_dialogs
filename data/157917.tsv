2010-04-14T17:51:00.000Z	outer_space		how come system monitor is reporting 1.6gb ram used but in processes the memory only adds up to 800mb max
2010-04-14T17:52:00.000Z	Slart	outer_space	is it showing all processes or just your user processes?
2010-04-14T17:53:00.000Z	Slart	outer_space	there is a setting.. in one of the menus I think
2010-04-14T17:54:00.000Z	Slart	outer_space	in the "view" menu.. there's "my processes", "active processes", "all processes"
