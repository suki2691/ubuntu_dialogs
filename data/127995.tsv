2008-06-08T07:22:00.000Z	sensae		I'm trying to use VMware and it's asking me for a file that exists, and when I point it to the file it asks for it recursively. I know this probably isn't quite the place to ask, but hey, it's on ubuntu

2008-06-08T07:22:00.000Z	connor	sensae	virtualbox is much better than vmware, and stuff runs better on it
