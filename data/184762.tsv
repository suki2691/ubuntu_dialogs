2006-05-27T10:28:00.000Z	Stargazers	pUm	No, both of them works fine
2006-05-27T10:30:00.000Z	pUm	Stargazers	yes, i thinking about the moment initrd <--> rootfs ... did you look at the initrd script ? debian has a extra package for netboot. i think you already applied the other changes in fstab rc.* etc ?!
2006-05-27T10:30:00.000Z	Stargazers	pUm	Uh, can you paste URL to tutorials etc?
