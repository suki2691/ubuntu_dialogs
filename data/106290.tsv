2008-01-10T09:40:00.000Z	KlrSp1	jwprox	yeah i have that.. apparently imagerotate() isn't included in that shared object htough... someone on the buglist mentioned a security issue, but have yet to state what it was
2008-01-10T09:41:00.000Z	KlrSp1		and this is damn annoying.. i just wiped my gentoo install in favor for ubuntu, but i'm getting pissed thinking of going back
