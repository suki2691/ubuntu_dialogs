2007-07-03T08:22:00.000Z	nooblinuxuser		need help installing kubuntu on my system, i can't seem to get the installation to boot, i have a raid 0 setup
2007-07-03T08:22:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	nooblinuxuser	 raid0? or raid1? if raid0, why?
2007-07-03T08:25:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	nooblinuxuser	 raid0 guarantees that if any drive in the raid dies, the whole raid dies, for good (unless you have a current, verified, safe, uncorrupted backup -- do you?)
