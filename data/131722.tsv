2010-07-06T12:48:00.000Z	nomorenick		my problem is that i want to autohide cairo-dock but i dont know how to
2010-07-06T12:48:00.000Z	nomorenick		also i would like to make the icon background transparent, not the dock.
2010-07-06T12:48:00.000Z	nomorenick		i want to keep the dock how it is, but whenever i go over an icon the icon background turns black
