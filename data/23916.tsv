2010-10-17T16:09:00.000Z	jo-erlend	ABJayo	if you use security, yes.
2010-10-17T16:11:00.000Z	jo-erlend	ABJayo	that's enough. Be careful when you're using public computers, though, since they can use keystroke listeners to obtain your password. But https is sufficient from a network security point of view.
