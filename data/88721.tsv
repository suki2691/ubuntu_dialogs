2008-06-03T17:36:00.000Z	shwan		Hi , Is there any easy way to auto mount NTFS drives on boot , read/write enabled ?
2008-06-03T17:36:00.000Z	Slart	shwan	if you edit your /etc/fstab the drives will be mounted on boot
2008-06-03T17:37:00.000Z	shwan	Slart	I just wanted to know if I need to write any thing to enable the write , maybe it is enabled by default ?
