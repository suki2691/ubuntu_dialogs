2010-01-08T07:27:00.000Z	Cubey	jgcampbell300	if you want free, wine.
2010-01-08T07:28:00.000Z	Cubey	jgcampbell300	better off with a dual boot system if you want to play games. ubuntu makes it very easy to do this
2010-01-08T07:29:00.000Z	Cubey	jgcampbell300	go check the wine appdb, most wont run well. there is a commercially available piece of software that helps runs windows games better.. the name escapes me though... cadgera? or something like that..
