2010-02-26T07:28:00.000Z	Serraphyn		Hi, I was wondering if wine the only options for running window games in ubuntu
2010-02-26T07:29:00.000Z	Nitsuga	Serraphyn	gdm would respawn itself
2010-02-26T07:30:00.000Z	Serraphyn	Nitsuga	his question was about killing xorg server not stopping gdm though
2010-02-26T07:30:00.000Z	Nitsuga	Serraphyn	yeah, but in most cases Xorg is running by gdm
