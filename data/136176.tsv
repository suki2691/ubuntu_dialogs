2009-05-17T11:30:00.000Z	ttmrichter		Try #3: anybody out there know SSH *REALLY* well?  Someone who can take the error message "channel 3: open failed: administratively prohibited: open failed" and turn this into something that can be solved?
2009-05-17T11:31:00.000Z	Gnea	ttmrichter	but what's the *problem*?
2009-05-17T11:32:00.000Z	ttmrichter	Gnea	SSH tunneling of HTTP through a remote Squid proxy.
2009-05-17T11:56:00.000Z	Gnea	ttmrichter	yeah, problems like that, if i get irritated, i go and play some video game for awhile or do something else and come back to it - better to tackle a difficult problem with a fresh start... might figure something else out in the meantime that'll help
