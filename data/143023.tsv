2007-04-16T12:45:00.000Z	ticky		ok. here i go again: does anybody know a good artile to read about what is the best way to partition a disk i will only use for storage (i.e. no operating system will be installed there). I' ve heard that is not convenient to have single one large partition. is that correct?

2007-04-16T12:49:00.000Z	qaldune	ticky	doesn't matter
