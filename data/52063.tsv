2009-10-07T13:08:00.000Z	HypothesisFrog		hi. I'm trying to set up apache2 with mod_python, and public_html in my $HOME enabled. Is there a howto on this?
2009-10-07T13:08:00.000Z	joaopinto	HypothesisFrog	google is a better place to ask for howtos ;)
2009-10-07T13:09:00.000Z	HypothesisFrog	joaopinto	haven't been able to find any relevant to jaunty.
2009-10-07T13:09:00.000Z	joaopinto	HypothesisFrog	a generic one should do
