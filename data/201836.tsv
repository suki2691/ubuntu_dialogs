2006-02-19T07:18:00.000Z	NoStress	IdleOne	because he thinks that you didn't enter a blank cd, lot of reason (your cd is not blank or is altered, your drive don't work with this kind of cd, your drive is old ) ...
2006-02-19T07:18:00.000Z	IdleOne	NoStress	 cd is blank cd-rw  drive is a couple years old but is recognised
2006-02-19T07:21:00.000Z	NoStress	IdleOne	sorry, can't help you, try with another cd
