2006-11-18T08:15:00.000Z	grunger		I'm planning on switching to Ubuntu Edgy Eft, but my Modem Drivers are not Recommended for kernel versions 2.6.17.1 to 2.6.17.7, However, 2.6.17.8+ Versions are supported. Can anybody tell me the last number in Ubuntu's Edgy Eft Kernel Version (2.6.17.x)
2006-11-18T08:17:00.000Z	grunger		Awesome. Thank You @ Orkie

2006-11-18T08:18:00.000Z	Vorbote	grunger	2.6.18 (typo, typo!)
