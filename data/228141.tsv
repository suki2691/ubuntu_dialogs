2005-10-08T06:45:00.000Z	bigfoot1		how could my zip files have gone corrupted? I just emailed the files to myself.
2005-10-08T06:45:00.000Z	bigfoot1		I thought corruption only happened with stuff like floppy disks.
2005-10-08T06:45:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	bigfoot1	it happens with bad memory and bad harddrives and bad ide controllers too
2005-10-08T06:46:00.000Z	bigfoot1	ColonelKernel	next time I'm going to use an online storage space like sendthisfile.com or opera's free 300 MB storage.
