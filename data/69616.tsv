2012-03-08T21:20:00.000Z	PhantomOcelot		Is there a program similar to GPartEd that would allow me to copy a partition? Example:  I am buying a new hard drive, and have no intention of keeping this one, as it is old and less than 100GB.  Is there a way I can just copy this hard drive info to the new hard drive WITHOUT having to do a full install of Ubuntu and lose everything?
