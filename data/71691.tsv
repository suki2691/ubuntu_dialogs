2009-05-05T19:57:00.000Z	hatter243	ubuntu_	try to fsck it before you mount it
2009-05-05T19:58:00.000Z	ubuntu_	hatter243	: I did but it says "The superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2"
2009-05-05T19:58:00.000Z	ubuntu_	hatter243	:but if I do find /boot/grub/stage1 it points out that drive out
