2012-10-05T22:59:00.000Z	forgotmynick		i've changed my graphics card and when i boot in, i can see the ubuntu login screen in the full 1920x1080 resolution but after entering the password, it just shows the background, not gnome. I can't right click but the mouse does move and caps lock works. There is no disk activity and I can access tty. Please advise?
