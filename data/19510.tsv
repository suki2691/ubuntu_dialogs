2011-02-11T12:10:00.000Z	Starminn	kwtm	Yeah, Evolution is the default although I use Thunderbird.
2011-02-11T12:13:00.000Z	kwtm	Starminn	Thanks for info.  Tried Thunderbird --ran up against an error that is apparently documented and not fixed (can't remember exact message --"SSL record too long" or something") that renders it utterly useless.  WIll try Evolution.
2011-02-11T12:14:00.000Z	Starminn	kwtm	Alright. I've not tried Evolution to be honest as I used Thunderbird before I switched to Linux as well, so I can't say good or bad about it. See how it goes. *shrug* best of luck.
