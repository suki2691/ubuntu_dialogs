2006-02-20T16:17:00.000Z	Belgain		quick question... i'm trying to change the resync speed of a RAID array my changing the value in /proc/sys/dev/raid/speed_limit_min
2006-02-20T16:17:00.000Z	Belgain		the problem is that something seems to be continually writing to that file and updating it, so I can't change the value (even as roo)
2006-02-20T16:18:00.000Z	Belgain		any idea what might be doing this?
2006-02-20T16:18:00.000Z	psusi	Belgain	what makes you think that?
