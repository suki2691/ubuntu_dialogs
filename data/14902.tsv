2011-04-29T19:04:00.000Z	mtlife		FizzixNerd: so any idea how to reset the configuration for unity?
2011-04-29T19:04:00.000Z	FizzixNerd	mtlife	you could try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure unity"
2011-04-29T19:06:00.000Z	mtlife	FizzixNerd	I get "found no decorator to start segmentation fault" when i run unity from terminal
2011-04-29T19:06:00.000Z	FizzixNerd	mtlife	it sounds like it's the same problem for both gnome and unity then - a window decorator problem
