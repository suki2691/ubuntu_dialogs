2010-01-17T04:54:00.000Z	Thunder_Drop	Izinucs	I was looking into different options other than the nvidia twinview but it seems that I can't enable any desktop effects with xinerama
2010-01-17T04:55:00.000Z	Thunder_Drop	Izinucs	I think its because my nvidia driver gets bypassed when xinerama is enabled
2010-01-17T04:55:00.000Z	Izinucs	Thunder_Drop	I use to use xinerama on 6.06 but dropped it.. now I just run a BIG monitor.. nvidia should have some docs on it..
