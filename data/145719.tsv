2007-02-16T17:40:00.000Z	varkatope	erUSUL	how to run that script and what will it do?
2007-02-16T17:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	varkatope	'python script-name' it will print a list of hardware supported by the kernel that is running
2007-02-16T17:42:00.000Z	varkatope	erUSUL	im not interested in the hardware of the current kernel but in the hardware of the feisty-kernel
