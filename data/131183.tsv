2007-06-12T14:39:00.000Z	levander	TheCougar	it doesn't matter, as long as it's at least 5 GB (about) in size
2007-06-12T14:40:00.000Z	TheCougar	levander	its giving me a bunch of choices ext3, jfs, xfs, efi
2007-06-12T14:40:00.000Z	levander	TheCougar	those aren't partitions, those are filesystem types
