2005-12-10T16:14:00.000Z	nutter426	navarone	i have the same password for my user and for root, and i've logged in successfully with that password to both users, so i dont know how it can be wrong
2005-12-10T16:16:00.000Z	nutter426	navarone	i'm on a laptop, so no numberpad, but its a more valid point, the numlock light is off, but i've toggled num lock on and off and still no help
