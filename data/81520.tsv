2008-08-21T23:33:00.000Z	dingoyoko		Hi, I'm setting up a fileserver with SMB to share with both XP and Ubuntu machines. Do I have to format as NTFS?
2008-08-21T23:34:00.000Z	aldroid	dingoyoko	no, you can xfs or jfs or ext3 or whatever
2008-08-21T23:35:00.000Z	aldroid	dingoyoko	it's not ext3 for Windows machines, it's SMB file access :)
