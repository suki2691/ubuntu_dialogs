But obviously theres doesnt work. You can get past it by going to Users and Groups and unlocking it, it gives you privileges but it should still be smart enough to not ask a non-admin for a admin level password.

2009-11-29T03:02:00.000Z	Omen_20	FOrmode	that seems like a very backwards way of doing it. But I'm not just mad about that. Making a new account on Karmic has been a nightmare. For some reason compiz has decided to not work on other accounts. Theres so many bugs in karmic it isnt even funny.
