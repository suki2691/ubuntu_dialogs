2008-06-18T18:41:00.000Z	veevi	dr_Willis	when I use mplayer, and with -vo x11 option, the video looks great, but I can't get it to full screen, it keeps the same ratio
2008-06-18T18:41:00.000Z	dr_Willis	veevi	 yep. Thats an issue with some of the -vo options.
2008-06-18T18:42:00.000Z	veevi	dr_Willis	anything I can do about it?
2008-06-18T18:44:00.000Z	dr_Willis	veevi	 use a different -vo option, perhaps check the mplayer forums.
