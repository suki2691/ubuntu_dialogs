2011-01-13T22:18:00.000Z	Tsims		Something is wrong with my nvidia driver. I cant access xconfig, I cant change any of the graphics settings, and under additional drivers, i am unable to activate the proprietary drivers.  It just shows the window that says "downloading and installing driver," then the window just closes and nothing activates

2011-01-13T22:22:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Tsims	you can't guess , in the nvidia settings gui there's a recommended driver which you must click on and install.
