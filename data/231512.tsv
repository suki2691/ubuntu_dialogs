2007-11-04T23:12:00.000Z	josh04		 Hey, can anyone help me: If I set vga=795 in menu.lst, I get  "Out of range" on my moniter, which is native 1280x1024. X  works fine at that resolution. Any ideas?

2007-11-04T23:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	josh04	 that vga= thing has a lot of options. could try 'ask' and it should post a list of res/modes it can use.
