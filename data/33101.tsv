2010-07-01T22:23:00.000Z	ratcheer	romeo_	I am. All forums are stale for the past few hours, for me.
2010-07-01T22:25:00.000Z	ratcheer	romeo_	I appear to be logged in, but it shows me as the only user on the forums.
2010-07-01T22:26:00.000Z	ratcheer	romeo_	Early this morning, it was fine, but now I can't see anything newer than 6 hours or so.
