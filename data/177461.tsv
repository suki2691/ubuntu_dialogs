2006-10-22T14:19:00.000Z	skavenge	Xaser	that shouldnt matter then, if you had to go through a proxy it would need to be set within the browser but i dont think thats the case
2006-10-22T14:21:00.000Z	skavenge	Xaser	its a resolving issue for sure, I dont know much about it but check that your dns is correct for sure
