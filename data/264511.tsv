2011-02-08T05:31:00.000Z	nemo	TheDelay	don't suppose your machine has a wifi kill switch you could toggle?
2011-02-08T05:33:00.000Z	nemo	TheDelay	if you press the kill switch while in ubuntu, that doesn't "wake it up" ?
2011-02-08T05:33:00.000Z	nemo	TheDelay	could be simply the kill switch light isn't illuminating properly
