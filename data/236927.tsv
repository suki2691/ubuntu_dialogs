2008-05-03T05:25:00.000Z	misieq		hi! I have some problem with a simple c++ code relating to writing output to files. Basicly I try to write something to file, but the output is 0-sized. Permission are set ok and if the file is not there it gets created. code is right here: http://www.nopaste.pl/4ck and there are a few comments (in red) as what the program should do. can anyone help me?
