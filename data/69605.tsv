2012-06-20T06:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	SJr	whatever I backup I normaly use rsync
2012-06-20T06:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	SJr	you could use dd to just backup the partition table info  man dd
2012-06-20T06:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	SJr	there are better docs on dd but this is all I found so far https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DriveImaging
