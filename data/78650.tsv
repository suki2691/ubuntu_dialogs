2008-09-22T02:32:00.000Z	moglenstar		Does anybody know how to switch to a regular bash shell, instead of the ash shell provided, during the Ubuntu 8.04.1 install?
2008-09-22T02:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moglenstar	how do you mean "regular bash"
2008-09-22T02:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	moglenstar	terminal gives you a regular user shell
2008-09-22T02:33:00.000Z	moglenstar	ActionParsnip	well I don't seem to be able to do anything with the "ash" shell it gives, when I press alt+f2. The installer couldn't install a kernel on the computer, so I want to do it manually.
