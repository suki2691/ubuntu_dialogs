2009-05-20T13:14:00.000Z	[ucb]kevin		perhaps someone can help me with the following: windows are opening in such an initial position that the title bare is hidden behind my main ubuntu "apps place system etc.." bar -- how can I fix this?
2009-05-20T13:16:00.000Z	ozzmosis	[ucb]kevin	I "fixed" that by enabling auto-hide on the top menu
2009-05-20T13:23:00.000Z	[ucb]kevin	ozzmosis	thanks for the suggestion -- however its more of a "band-aide" than a soln.
2009-05-20T13:24:00.000Z	ozzmosis	[ucb]kevin	yeah
