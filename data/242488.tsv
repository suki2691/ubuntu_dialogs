2007-11-20T13:30:00.000Z	BubblegumTate		I just installed 7.10 on a machine with a widescreen lcd screen and a geforce, If i start up normally I get a blank screen but If I start up in failsafe and type gdm, everything works, what's the difference?
2007-11-20T13:31:00.000Z	BubblegumTate		please help it's making me insane
