2009-01-30T11:13:00.000Z	ricecube		I've tried installing windows xp and ubuntu 8.04 in various different orders, and when I boot, it always gives and error like, "No operating system!" or takes me to "grub>"  I keep getting error 15 and 17 when I try to install grub using my live cd following the instructions found on ubuntuforums

2009-01-30T11:14:00.000Z	ricecube		I've look at all of those
