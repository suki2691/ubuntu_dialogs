2012-01-05T01:47:00.000Z	AnonMasochist		how do I fix the ever so famous FREEZING problem in Ubuntu 10.04!?!, I have looked on ALL forums, and still can't find a freakin' solution, other than to switch to a less user friendly Linux OS. 
2012-01-05T01:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	AnonMasochist	 you could be giving more details... not just repeating rather vague statements.
2012-01-05T02:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	AnonMasochist	 you stated the fix was comming out in a newer kernel earlier
2012-01-05T02:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	AnonMasochist	 and which irc client is this?
