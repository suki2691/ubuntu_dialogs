2007-02-12T14:34:00.000Z	SanguineAnomaly	shatrat	how come?
2007-02-12T14:34:00.000Z	shatrat	SanguineAnomaly	from what Ive read sudo su doesnt set up the environment variables properly so you could end up with wrong paths to home and bin and such
2007-02-12T14:35:00.000Z	SanguineAnomaly	shatrat	ah, that makes sense - since I've actually had that problem XD
