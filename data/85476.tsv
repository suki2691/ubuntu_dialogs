2008-07-15T20:50:00.000Z	sipior	Sorlag	the -q switch refers to terminal output, not the system beep
2008-07-15T20:50:00.000Z	Sorlag	sipior	its still outputting
2008-07-15T20:51:00.000Z	sipior	Sorlag	actually, checking the man page, i notice that i don't seem to have a -q switch anyway, so it is not surprising that it would do nothing :-)
