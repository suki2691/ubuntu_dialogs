2008-12-28T01:33:00.000Z	SexyMarty		Is there a way to rename my mounted drives and partitions?  I'd like something a little more uniform and less ambiguous than "Hard Drive" and "160 gb medium"

2008-12-28T01:34:00.000Z	SexyMarty	Dr_Willis_AAO	where would I do that?
2008-12-28T01:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_AAO	SexyMarty	 I do it under windows.. :)
