2009-06-16T16:01:00.000Z	anodesni		I'm looking for a way to turn off my 2nd monitor from command line, xset dpms off works, but shuts down both monitors.
2009-06-16T16:02:00.000Z	simplexio	anodesni	something like xset localhost:0.1 may work
2009-06-16T16:02:00.000Z	simplexio	anodesni	im not sure about syntax
2009-06-16T16:03:00.000Z	anodesni	simplexio	again both monitor shut down
