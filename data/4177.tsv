I installed a few with synaptic, but "update-alternatives --config default.plymouth" only shows 3 of them  3) how do I run a script on logout? I tried ~/.bash_logout, but that doesn't seem to work. is putting a "su -c foo myusername" in an init.d script instead a bad idea? (I want to write the contents of a ramdisk back on the hard drive)
