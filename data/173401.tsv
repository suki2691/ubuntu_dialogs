2010-10-11T02:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	arose	you can cancel an Ubuntu install, but then the partitin you installed on, wil be a bit messed up
2010-10-11T02:44:00.000Z	arose	sebsebseb	Too late for that, had to kill a dedicated install
2010-10-11T03:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	arose	well yeah,  and the themes have changed a bit, and a new font, and yep thats about it for the desktop version,  and then the stuff you don't just see, slightly later verisons of programs
