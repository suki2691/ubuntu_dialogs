2007-12-09T06:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Ashfire908	Under all normal conditions, right.  (For example though, changing the text of the "Start" button I believe involves editing explorer.exe)  Not for the faint of heart though, flat-out stupid when you have the source anyway, and completely useless when it's not even the right file :P
