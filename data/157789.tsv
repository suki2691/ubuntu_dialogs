2009-06-21T02:54:00.000Z	Cry__Baby		I found a bug.  When I had another user "enable automatic login", but then removed that user.. And then chose "enable automatic login" for main user, Ubuntu won't load and stops at a black screen.  The only way I can then get into Ubuntu is press Ctrl+Alt+F1 and type "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart".  Anyone know of a fix and how I can now get "enable automatic login" to work?
2009-06-21T02:56:00.000Z	Cry__Baby		I just did an upgrade to kernel etc, and now I have no sound. What can I do?
2009-06-21T02:57:00.000Z	Cry__Baby		is there a ubuntu d evelopers channel?
