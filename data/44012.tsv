2010-07-11T04:20:00.000Z	Guest82705		Hello I just installed Lucid and I'm not able to play .mp4 videos, I already tried with vlc, smplayer, and already installed gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad and gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly, I really do not know what else to do, any ideas?
2010-07-11T04:21:00.000Z	Blue1	Guest82705	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras maybe?
2010-07-11T04:21:00.000Z	Guest82705	Blue1	already did that also
2010-07-11T04:21:00.000Z	Blue1	Guest82705	sorry that worked for me.
