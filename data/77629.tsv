2009-05-05T22:15:00.000Z	rhombus		I have a server running 7.04 and I want to upgrade to 8.04 LTS. What's the safest way to do this? It's a production server, so I want to avoid a fresh install.
2009-05-05T22:16:00.000Z	yash	rhombus	upgrade to 7.10 and then to 8.04
2009-05-05T22:16:00.000Z	rhombus	yash	yeah, but 7.10 is EOLed also -- is this still the best way?
2009-05-05T22:17:00.000Z	yash	rhombus	yes
