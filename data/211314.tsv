2007-07-15T10:39:00.000Z	astro76	bluefox83	I'm not sure that it will, I think you have to mount it and/or add it to fstab
2007-07-15T10:40:00.000Z	bluefox83	astro76	i did..i'm just wondering why i even have a Places->Network if i don't have smb installed and all i use is NFS
2007-07-15T10:41:00.000Z	astro76	bluefox83	it's always there, places that are connected with Connect to Server... will also show up there
