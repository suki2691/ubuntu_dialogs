2007-09-13T06:05:00.000Z	dgjones	chris_	i use ntfs-3g very occasionally and haven't had a problem, although for safety, i'm in the process of backing up data on an ntfs drive ready to reformat to either fat32 or ext3 now i don't have any specific need to use windows
2007-09-13T06:06:00.000Z	chris_	dgjones	I found that since windows can read ext3, and linux can read ntfs, I never needed a 'middle' exchange partition
2007-09-13T06:06:00.000Z	chris_	dgjones	I installed an ext3 driver in windows - it doesn't have one as standard of course
2007-09-13T06:08:00.000Z	dgjones	chris_	i had a 320gb  drive in a windows server so needed t formatted as ntfs, i've replaced the machine with an ubuntu one now so don't need it as ntfs anymore, so for safety, im replacing it as a format natively read by linux
