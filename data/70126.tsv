2010-03-31T15:06:00.000Z	Duke_		How do I install from a .tar.gz file? I already have build-essential installed, what now?
2010-03-31T15:07:00.000Z	maginot	Duke_	did you after unpacking the tar.gz file entered his directory and typed ./configure && make && make install
2010-03-31T15:10:00.000Z	Duke_	maginot	I got to the ./configure and it says bash: ./configure: No such file or directory
2010-03-31T15:11:00.000Z	maginot	Duke_	are you inside the package directory ? So maybe it has no configure... read any HOWTO/INSTALL/README file inside the directory
