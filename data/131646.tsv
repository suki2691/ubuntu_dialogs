2007-07-21T10:22:00.000Z	malsyned	cabrioleur	you know if there's a HOWTO on getting OrCAD to work with WINE?  or is it straightforward?
2007-07-21T10:22:00.000Z	cabrioleur	malsyned	it work straightforward on my slackware machine. beside, it's uses the same config as autocad
2007-07-21T10:24:00.000Z	malsyned	cabrioleur	ok cool, thanks
