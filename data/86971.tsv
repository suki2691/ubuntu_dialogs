2008-06-26T18:37:00.000Z	MidnightJ	Dunas	I belive you. People sometime seem to go to alot of work to avoid having to learn something new :/
2008-06-26T18:39:00.000Z	Dunas	MidnightJ	Being honest for the longest time I didn't swap for various reasons- wine wouldn't work on my laptop, wireless was a pain in the butt, and of course, there were a few programs my Chem class used that didn't work in Linux, but this desktop is getting Ubuntu if I have to threaten it with a sledgehammer.
2008-06-26T18:43:00.000Z	MidnightJ	Dunas	I switched from Win just out of pure rage against MS. Didn't even think about that. But every windowsprogram I've ever needed I've been able to virtulize. I really never ever want windows again
