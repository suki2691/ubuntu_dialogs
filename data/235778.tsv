2006-09-29T08:22:00.000Z	Madpilot	thedash	you could file a bug, with as much detail as you can supply. bugs.ubuntu.com
2006-09-29T08:24:00.000Z	Madpilot	thedash	do the drive & mobo work together in other operating systems?
2006-09-29T08:26:00.000Z	Madpilot	thedash	my 120Gb SATA drive has always worked flawlessly in Ubuntu; file a bug like I suggested and see what feedback you get... not sure what else to suggest, though...
