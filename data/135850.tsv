2007-05-31T13:36:00.000Z	sgrove		hey all, I'm trying to fix up an older machin to install feisty on it, but I hooked up another monitor and it's very strange, like it's cut in half, and the bottom half is on the top of the screen and the top on the bottom
2007-05-31T13:37:00.000Z	sgrove		any common, quick solution for this?

2007-05-31T13:37:00.000Z	agn0stic	sgrove	need to do that when you hook up a new monitor sometimes
