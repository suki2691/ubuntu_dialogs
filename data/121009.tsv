2007-10-19T00:45:00.000Z	murkyMurk	avis	yes and no. Yes it will show a desktop, no it won't be optimised until it's fullt installed and you enable the restricted drivers option for nvidia cards
2007-10-19T00:46:00.000Z	avis	murkyMurk	ahh ok so i it will work in gutsy after enabling restricted drivers ?  i'm guessing that can't be done from the live cd  ?
2007-10-19T00:47:00.000Z	murkyMurk	avis	yep, all nvidia cards are supported through the nvidia driver
