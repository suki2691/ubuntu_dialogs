2011-06-07T10:45:00.000Z	crass_	brown_fern	and zsh is better anyway ;)
2011-06-07T10:48:00.000Z	crass_	brown_fern	I used to be able to work wonders with zsh, but now i've gotten lazy. I feel where you're coming from, there.
2011-06-07T10:51:00.000Z	crass_	brown_fern	I once wrote a zsh script to organize all my music, cuz the renamer that was packaged with xfce segfaulted on me *one time* ... I was hopped up on a bunch of speed though, and that sounds like a good idea when you're gakked out of your head.
