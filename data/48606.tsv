2009-09-14T01:43:00.000Z	conjurer	mefiiik	go to a terminal and type mount
2009-09-14T01:43:00.000Z	conjurer	mefiiik	but i think your problem is more likely udev/desktop related
2009-09-14T01:44:00.000Z	mefiiik	conjurer	if i type mount nothing happen.. it just write me some thing but still i cant see hdd
