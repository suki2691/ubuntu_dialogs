2007-08-16T05:17:00.000Z	iCEifer	Theimon	my package manager shows libc6 is already installed. when I tried to boot normally I get the error that I am running an X server. so the kill command will stop that error?
2007-08-16T05:25:00.000Z	iCEifer	Theimon	I tried the kill command and it worked but after "booting local scripts [OK] " it just hangs there?
2007-08-16T05:34:00.000Z	iCEifer	Theimon	you still here?
