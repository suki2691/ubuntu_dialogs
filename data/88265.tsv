2009-02-17T14:18:00.000Z	lvlefisto	Viper111	i had a problem similar to yours. Then i realized squid is not meant to be used for anything else than HTTP
2009-02-17T14:18:00.000Z	Viper111	lvlefisto	so wt should i do then ?? to enable access 110 25
2009-02-17T14:19:00.000Z	lvlefisto	Viper111	configure Thunderbird to not use the proxy
