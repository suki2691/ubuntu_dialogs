2010-10-01T12:33:00.000Z	UweBollsFunder		I'm planning to install Ubuntu Server in a VM. Does it matter whether I select 32-bit or 64-bit? Are there some packages only made for one but not the other?
2010-10-01T12:35:00.000Z	UweBollsFunder		I didn't think Vmware was 32-bit but it's installed in Program Files (x86) so you're right
2010-10-01T12:36:00.000Z	UweBollsFunder		what are the differences between Ubuntu Server and Debian? From what I know of Ubuntu, it's Debian with a focus on desktop usage and services. In a server version, what still makes it different?
