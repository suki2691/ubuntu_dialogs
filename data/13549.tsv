2012-05-13T03:46:00.000Z	BlueProtoman		Help!  I can't get Wi-fi on my Ubuntu 11.10 laptop!  It was working fine earlier today, I've done nothing to it!
2012-05-13T03:47:00.000Z	BlueProtoman		It's a Broadcom.  It's worked just fkne before, though.  I didn't even screw with the drivers or  config
2012-05-13T03:48:00.000Z	BlueProtoman		No.  Gonna see if it works on Windows
2012-05-13T03:49:00.000Z	DjKiDD	BlueProtoman	are you sure there is not a switch or button/combo of buttons you can press to turn on and off the wireless card
