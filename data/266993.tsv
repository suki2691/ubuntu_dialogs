2009-05-22T05:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BlackGrave	 clarify 'irc works' ...
2009-05-22T05:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BlackGrave	 theres dozens of irc clients.. and irc servers
2009-05-22T05:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	BlackGrave	 the term 'normal irc' means nothing.. there are many text based irc clients, such as irssi, Bitchx, and the old original ircii (now thats old!)
