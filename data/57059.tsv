2009-05-18T10:48:00.000Z	msmarc		hey i'm getting an error when trying to install build-essential with apt-get in intrepid is there some sort of bug?
2009-05-18T10:49:00.000Z	msmarc		it says it has unmet dependencies
2009-05-18T10:50:00.000Z	blz	msmarc	 sanity check -- did you enable all of the repos?
2009-05-18T10:51:00.000Z	blz	msmarc	 i'm not sure what repo build-essential is on, but try enabling the 3rd party ones for now
