2007-10-22T08:51:00.000Z	tony_		I'm having a problem booting due to a screwed up ndiswrapper. Is there a way to disable the wireless in the boot options?
2007-10-22T08:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tony_	Start in recovery mode and 'apt-get remove ndiswrapper'
2008-09-01T10:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tony_	Did you try simply letting the b43-fwcutter package download and extract the firmware itself?
2008-09-01T10:20:00.000Z	tony_	Jordan_U	no I didn't. I was just following that set of instructions.
