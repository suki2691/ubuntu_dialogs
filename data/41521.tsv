2009-12-01T05:37:00.000Z	ten80p		Hello, I keep getting DRDY ERR and ICRC ABRT messages when i access my sata disk .. there was no problem when the disk was connected to usb, and the disk works fine on windows, any ideas?
2009-12-01T05:38:00.000Z	silent_h	ten80p	try going to the "Places" menu, and see if the drive shows up there -- when I use eSATA on mine I have to mount it manually (since it is considered an internal drive)
2009-12-01T05:40:00.000Z	silent_h	ten80p	hmm, is it just a data drive or are you trying to boot the OS from it?
