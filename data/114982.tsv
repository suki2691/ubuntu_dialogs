2007-10-28T04:10:00.000Z	hexkubuntu	Narada	the only difference is the gui, just do a apt-get install gnome and apt-get remove kde
2007-10-28T04:10:00.000Z	Narada	hexkubuntu	don't i have to get the ubuntu-desktop?
2007-10-28T04:10:00.000Z	hexkubuntu	Narada	ubuntu-desktop is simply a way of combining those commands I gave you
