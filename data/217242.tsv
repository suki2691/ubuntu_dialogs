2006-03-03T17:54:00.000Z	Smegzor		I am unable to do anything as root user (running ubuntu image for vmware player).  Is there something I can run to set the root password like there is for Knoppix?
2006-03-03T17:55:00.000Z	Smegzor		oh ok.  I know all about sudo but I'm a windows user
2006-03-03T06:00:00.000Z	Smegzor		hmm.. there's a problem with using sudo.  I do not know what my existing password is.  I'm running a pre-built image made for vmware player.  I might be stuffed.
