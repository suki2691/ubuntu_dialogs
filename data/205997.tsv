2007-03-12T05:47:00.000Z	priich	aos	i guess it depends on how you installed it. From cvs or from some 3d party repo or just copy the files "manually" ?
2007-03-12T05:52:00.000Z	priich	aos	hmm you added a repo+ used wget, ehh ? Well does dpkg -l | grep -i cedega show anything ?       If not does sudo apt-cache search cedega give any results ?
