2012-01-24T19:58:00.000Z	GeminiDomino		Geek question: is there an inverse to a sticky bit? That is, setting up a directory (for SFTP use) that allows deletions WITHOUT allowing creating new files?
2012-01-24T20:00:00.000Z	auronandace	GeminiDomino	maybe i don't understand your question, but if you've just set up the directory wouldn't it be empty? so what would there be to delete if there are no files there?

A data file will be dumped into the directory daily by a local cronjob, for external retrieval. I want these guys to be able to delete the files once they've got them, rather than crying to me when the file list gets unwieldy, without them being able to send anything to the server.
