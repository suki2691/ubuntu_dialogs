2009-05-08T09:34:00.000Z	glitsj16	Strav	i thought fusion-icon is independent on what backend you use to configure compiz, it only starts/ends it no ?
2009-05-08T09:36:00.000Z	Strav	glitsj16	ain't sure of that, but I'm certain it has everything in it's depedencies to manage the config of compiz.
2009-05-08T09:36:00.000Z	glitsj16	Strav	yes probably
