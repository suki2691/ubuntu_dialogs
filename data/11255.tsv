2011-08-03T05:23:00.000Z	OmegaForte	induz	Yeah. Just set it as the install point.
2011-08-03T05:24:00.000Z	OmegaForte	induz	Latest will work, but it'd be live mode. An install would bloat to fill that twice over.
2011-08-03T05:27:00.000Z	OmegaForte	induz	you'd be basically copying a live cd to the thumbstick. It'd run fine, but like a live cd. If you want a built distro, look for damnsmall linux, or google about for slimming ubuntu down.
