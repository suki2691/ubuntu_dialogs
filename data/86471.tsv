2010-06-02T09:14:00.000Z	Pooterman		Are there any known issues with the top task bar using 10.04? Shutdown menu disappears, date doubles up?
2010-06-02T09:14:00.000Z	cellofellow	Pooterman	never heard of that. Did you try removing the extra clock applet and readding the MeMenu applet?
2010-06-02T09:16:00.000Z	Pooterman	cellofellow	the fix is to open properties and move task bar to the right side then back to the top and it will fix the whole thing.  It is a glitch with my task bar.  The bar has to be moved to the right, neither left or bottom will fix.
