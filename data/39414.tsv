2010-01-08T05:57:00.000Z	mmvx	witeshark	it's because the browser has been updated and needs to be restarted :)
2010-01-08T05:58:00.000Z	mmvx	witeshark	FF is packaged by ubuntu
2010-01-08T06:00:00.000Z	mmvx	witeshark	firefox is part of the default ubuntu install. All updates come down via the ubuntu repos
