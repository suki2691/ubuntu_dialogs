2005-03-30T12:26:00.000Z	Quinn_Storm	ferris	I'd reccomend at least checking out ubuntu/kubuntu, the debian-based distros are pretty good as far as "just works" goes
2005-03-30T12:27:00.000Z	Quinn_Storm	ferris	what issues?
2005-03-30T12:28:00.000Z	Quinn_Storm	ferris	well I don't know what to say there...make sure you have universe & multiverse in your repositories and try...what's your /etc/apt/sources.list look like?
