2007-01-13T12:36:00.000Z	Qubert		oh hay I also have question regarding that ubuntu-desktop thing
2007-01-13T12:36:00.000Z	Qubert		what exactly does that end up removing?
2007-01-13T12:37:00.000Z	Qubert		because I want to obliterate evolution if that seems feasible, and it wants to remove that too, so I'm scared lol
2007-01-13T12:38:00.000Z	odi3	Qubert	honestly, ive gotten myself into WAY too much trouble trying to remove unneeded apps. basically if you dont want to see it, just remove it from task list apps usually are small anyways
