2007-09-01T08:26:00.000Z	mojo		HELP!  K3B keeps locking my DVD-R when it fails to write to a disc...  how do I fix it?  See what I did on pastebin... the eject command sits a second, gives the error shown, but nothing ejects.  Suggestions??  Thanks! http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/35871/

2007-09-01T08:29:00.000Z	mojo	Vovk	wt-heck you talking about? I have a dvd-r that k3b is locking, and fails to unlock when it fails to burn a disc... so I can't eject.  Windows has _nothing_ to do with it at all.  I don't run windows on my desktop (home), haven't for 3+ years
