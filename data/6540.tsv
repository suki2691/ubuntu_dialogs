2012-01-08T21:00:00.000Z	bombadil_		Hi, how can I run some scripts after the system booted (or automatically login a user to do this, but in the background)?
2012-01-08T21:02:00.000Z	venkatmangudi	bombadil_	nice nick. :-)
2012-01-08T21:06:00.000Z	bombadil_	venkatmangudi	Thanks! Though I hoped to get some advice on autostarting services. Is there no other (better) way than init.d /rc.d?
2012-01-08T21:07:00.000Z	venkatmangudi	bombadil_	init.d/rc.d is the best way to do it
