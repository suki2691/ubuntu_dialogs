2007-10-03T15:11:00.000Z	VSpike		What other sources of support are there apart from ubuntuforums and this IRC channel?
2007-10-03T15:11:00.000Z	VSpike		Is paid canonical support the next step?
2007-10-03T15:11:00.000Z	stdin	VSpike	there's also the ubuntu-users mailing list
2007-10-03T15:13:00.000Z	VSpike	stdin	always worth a try.. thanks
