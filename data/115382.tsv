2007-12-10T21:47:00.000Z	SuicideSalmon		can anyone give me a hand? I'm running firefox on 7.10 x86_64 upgraded from 7.07. Firefox is so buggy it's painful - most of the plugins have stopped working (eg on youtube, a blank square will be there, no error), and firefox itself hangs for a few seconds extremely regular. Any idea what might be causing the issue?
