2008-06-19T09:35:00.000Z	cpk1		any ideas why on my network (being served and firewalled with ubuntu) there is one user who can't seem to play any kind of online game?
2008-06-19T09:36:00.000Z	genii	cpk1	Perhaps he's trying to play shockwave games
2008-06-19T09:37:00.000Z	cpk1	genii	what does that have to do with the network?
2008-06-19T09:37:00.000Z	genii	cpk1	Nothing. But shockwave doesn't work on linux
