2008-01-28T14:07:00.000Z	dandre		sorry if this is a little offtopic but I have an application that I can run because I need to set some environment variables before. I'd like to create a derivative of this application by encapsulating it in some sort of executable archive with a wrapper that could set these variables before running the real application.
2008-01-28T14:07:00.000Z	dandre		Is there any solution?

2008-01-28T14:10:00.000Z	ochosi	dandre	well that's what simple shell scripts usually are. one file.
