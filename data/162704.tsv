2007-04-18T13:39:00.000Z	Stoffer		here's another question:  when I tried to setup wireless networking from the livecd, I think I set it up correctly w/ the network manager but I still had no connection.  Is there something else I need to do besides enabling it and setting it up for it to connect?

2007-04-18T13:41:00.000Z	Stoffer		oh boo! tomorrow for 7?  Should I wait or install 6.1 today??
2007-04-18T13:41:00.000Z	PriceChild	Stoffer	I'd wait ;)
