2010-01-30T02:31:00.000Z	berty642		so that the end rar file is the same size as the original size
2010-01-30T02:32:00.000Z	berty642		yes but i dont want compression i want it set to store like you can in winrar
2010-01-30T02:34:00.000Z	guntbert	berty642	use tar for putting many files into one file without compression
