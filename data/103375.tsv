2008-01-19T14:56:00.000Z	rob45		hello! I'm having troubles booting the install cd. when I select install I get a blinking cursor. Any ideas on what could be problem? I checked the md5 of the iso and it matches
2008-01-19T14:58:00.000Z	rob45		I've checked AHCI/IDE settings and everything.. could it be a SATA cdrom? I get the same blinking cursor when i try to click "check CD for defects"
