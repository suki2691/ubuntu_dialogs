2008-04-29T03:22:00.000Z	shane2peru		I did a fresh install of Hardy 64bit, and when I go to log in, it bounces me back out with no error messages, I finally got in via Safe-Gnome  What gives???
2008-04-29T03:22:00.000Z	shane2peru		I assume it has to do with the ATI drivers???  but would that cause it to bounce me out?
2008-04-29T03:23:00.000Z	shane2peru		anyone know why a fresh install of hardy won't let me log into the normal account?
