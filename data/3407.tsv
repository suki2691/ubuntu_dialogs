2012-05-02T21:42:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ThePendulum	you can make new ones and remove those there I believe, I'm not in unity right now to check.
2012-05-02T21:43:00.000Z	ThePendulum	wilee-nilee	You can edit regular bookmarks, but apparently not the one under 'Computer'
2012-05-02T21:43:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ThePendulum	that would make sense really.
