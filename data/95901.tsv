2008-04-06T09:31:00.000Z	TheOneAndOnly	ntorido	a back up of what exactly?
2008-04-06T09:32:00.000Z	TheOneAndOnly	ntorido	i'd say archive it using bzip...
2008-04-06T09:34:00.000Z	TheOneAndOnly	ntorido	run sudo apt-get install bzip2 to make sure bzip is installed then run man bzip2, that should help you out :]
