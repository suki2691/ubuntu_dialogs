2007-11-26T08:41:00.000Z	Neatchee		Ok, new problem :D  Trying to set up an OpenSSH server.  I have plaintext auth disabled, and i've uploaded my rsa pub key and added it to the authorized key file in ~/.ssh, but it's still giving me "permissiondenied (publickey)
2007-11-26T08:41:00.000Z	Neatchee		Any ideas?
2007-11-26T08:42:00.000Z	IdleOne	Neatchee	you probably need to restart the server
2007-11-26T08:42:00.000Z	Neatchee	IdleOne	lol i'm not THAT slow :D
