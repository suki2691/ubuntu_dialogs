2011-05-01T19:00:00.000Z	iiprotocolii	vibhav	gcc: error trying to exec 'cc1': execvp: No such file or directory  <-- getting that when I try to compile. Build-essential is installed.
2011-05-01T19:02:00.000Z	iiprotocolii	vibhav	I've done that. I've also removed it and re-installed it, and nothing.
2011-05-01T19:05:00.000Z	iiprotocolii	vibhav	I highly doubt that it will work, considering that cc1 isn't anywhere in the /usr/lib/gcc directory
