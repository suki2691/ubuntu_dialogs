2008-11-22T22:44:00.000Z	jimmy_		Hey guys, I am running Ubuntu 8.10 on my new laptop, however, I have a really old laptop that can't handle Ubuntu. Is there any way to just install the kernel operate the old laptop from the command line only, without installing xwindows?
2008-11-22T22:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	jimmy_	 you could just tell X to not start.. or install  the whole desktop and enable a lighter window manager/desktop
