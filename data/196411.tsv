2009-03-01T08:25:00.000Z	mohanohi		i have 2 etx3 drive.. and not able to use it.. showing access denied
2009-03-01T08:26:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mohanohi	 the directories/files on the drives need to have proper permission./ownership set - to allow the users to access them..  root should be able to access them'
2009-03-01T08:27:00.000Z	dr_Willis	mohanohi	 chmod, and chown commands.
