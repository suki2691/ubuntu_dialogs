2010-10-23T13:55:00.000Z	anygivenname	blinkiz	i got wicd
2010-10-23T13:55:00.000Z	anygivenname	blinkiz	& network manager is working aswell
2010-10-23T13:57:00.000Z	blinkiz	anygivenname	Did not know about wicd. Anyway, it seems nice. The only thing you need to do is sudo apt-get install wicd. According to homepage of wicd, this should uninstall network-manager.
