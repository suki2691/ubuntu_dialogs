2009-11-28T09:22:00.000Z	Fandekasp		I've bugged my ssh access to my server ... Do someone know a way to kill the session ?
2009-11-28T09:22:00.000Z	Fandekasp		or to connect in a specific tty ?
2009-11-28T09:23:00.000Z	mMezquitale	Fandekasp	you mean you want to restart your ssh server? or the ssh client?
2009-11-28T09:25:00.000Z	Fandekasp	mMezquitale	: the ssh client. When I logg, I return to the previous bugged shell, I can't do anything else. And I have only 1 user enable to connect via ssh
