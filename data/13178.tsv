2011-08-02T12:22:00.000Z	GSF1200S_	stephenh	thats strange- im running Arch and using both syslog-ng and logrotate without issues
2011-08-02T12:22:00.000Z	stephenh	GSF1200S_	there's a few people posting about it but couldn't see a fix
2011-08-02T12:26:00.000Z	GSF1200S_	stephenh	odd.. I dont have a lucid setup so I cant help you their- I have Arch and Natty (11.04)
