2011-07-24T23:47:00.000Z	uhonia		Hi there, im on U10.10 and im trying to install a few things. But got a broken pack error. Is there an easy way to solve this, becasue synaptic gives me 100's of packs listed as broken... and i don't really want to remove all of them
2011-07-24T23:47:00.000Z	coz_	uhonia	 in synaptic package manager under the Edit menu I believe is a "fix broken packages" option
2011-07-24T23:49:00.000Z	coz_	uhonia	 did you try the synaptic  "Fix broken packages"  option?
2011-07-24T23:49:00.000Z	coz_	uhonia	 its under the "Edit" menu
