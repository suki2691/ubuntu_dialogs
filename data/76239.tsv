2008-10-29T22:30:00.000Z	MoonlitFate		Can anyone help me, with an issue I'm having.  I mean I looked up thins, but it just seemed to really confuse me. o_o
2008-10-29T22:32:00.000Z	MoonlitFate		I'm just trying to dual-boot both Xubuntu and Windows XP. . . and just the partitioning of the hard drive is where I get really confused.
