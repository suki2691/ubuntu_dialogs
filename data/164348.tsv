2008-07-04T04:59:00.000Z	Terabyte		any reason why i should have this error: http://solong.co.uk/index.php/about       ?
2008-07-04T04:59:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Terabyte	you don't have a function called base_url defined.. error message seems pretty obvious... why are you asking in here
2008-07-04T04:59:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Terabyte	this is #ubuntu, not #iamanoobwithphp
2008-07-04T05:01:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Terabyte	uh, why not be quick to insult, it's a plain and simple error that is easily debuggable and plainly obvious. The fact that you have to ask about it warrants an insult
