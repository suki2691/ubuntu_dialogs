2006-08-31T13:59:00.000Z	sanddrag		I installed xgl and compiz and when I select the XGL session and log in, I get an arrow on a brown screen for maybe 10 seconds, then a black screen for a second, then the round "busy" cursor on a brown screen for maybe 5 seconds, then it returns to the login screen
