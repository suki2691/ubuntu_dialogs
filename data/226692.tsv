2005-11-17T16:55:00.000Z	pjott		I need some help
2005-11-17T16:56:00.000Z	pjott		I'm a almost total noob with Linux. I found out that my ubuntu does not support *.rpm files, so I downloaded a converter called "Alien". It was all source code, and a friend of mine told me that I had to install "gcc". How do I do that in the Terminal window? If someone wants to help me, please PM or talk in the channel! :)
