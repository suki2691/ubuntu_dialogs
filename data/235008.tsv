2005-11-09T15:08:00.000Z	Vorpulus		Hello. I wiped windows from my computer yesterday and installed ubuntu. I'm finding it really difficult to install everything. I find command lines to put in the console such as: sudo apt-get install java-package java-common , but they hardly ever work
2005-11-09T15:08:00.000Z	Vorpulus		Can anyone help?
2005-11-09T15:09:00.000Z	Vorpulus		I have honestly been trying hard to sort it out
2005-11-09T15:09:00.000Z	CarlFK	Vorpulus	one problem at a time.  what do you want to install?
