2008-03-15T08:06:00.000Z	jimmygoon	sahil	set each of them to a different port
2008-03-15T08:09:00.000Z	jimmygoon	sahil	why? they are separate machines on separate networks? why not have a different address for each... that is the way it works? I just don't understand what you're wanting or why
2008-03-15T08:10:00.000Z	sahil	jimmygoon	dyndns has to refresh i want to be able to send people boxes and be able to remotely administer them
