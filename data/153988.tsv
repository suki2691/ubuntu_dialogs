2006-12-19T09:05:00.000Z	Kesman		hey, does anybody know why my cpu usage jumps to 100% immediately when I run any 3d application?
2006-12-19T09:05:00.000Z	Kesman		with fglrx
2006-12-19T09:06:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Kesman	id say you probably arent running fglrx at all, but mesa :)
2006-12-19T09:06:00.000Z	Kesman	nolimitsoya	no way, fglrxinfo gives me correct info and so does glxinfo
