2012-02-29T19:53:00.000Z	DerFlash		I've some OpenGL problem here. maybe someone can help? I'm running ubuntu 11.10 in virtual box on a mac with 3D accel activated. glxinfo seems ok, glxgears works fine. but when I try to capture the openGL window with glc-capture I get: "OpenGL Error: Failed to get size for 0x……..(glXSwapBuffers)" I've tracked down the error to the virtual box additions fakedri_drv.c but still don't know how to fix it:
