2011-07-14T19:03:00.000Z	tucemiux	Tru3fate	you mean you have files on a server and you want to access those files remotely?
2011-07-14T19:05:00.000Z	tucemiux	Tru3fate	youre not being specific enough, the resource you want to share is hosted on what OS??  You are trying to access the resource using ubuntu or what OS ?
2011-07-14T19:16:00.000Z	tucemiux	Tru3fate	ahhh... the answer is samba, apparently you can use samba to access your shared folders which is an over kill for me, I once had that same problem and decided to just host an ubuntu server and store all my files there, windows and ubuntu can access the files without a glitch
