2009-06-09T01:35:00.000Z	guntbert	Guest3630	not to be rude, but *you* asked if the difference in download speed from a web server and from torrent might be a question of "network drivers"
2009-06-09T01:36:00.000Z	Guest3630	guntbert	yes, I believe that if there was a problem with the drivers the card could struggle when dealing with many connections
