2007-10-17T19:50:00.000Z	Slart		say I want to start gnome with a different x.org config file.. how would I do that?
2007-10-17T19:50:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Slart	replace /etc/X11/xorg.conf with your other xorg.conf
2007-10-17T19:50:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Slart	back the original one up though, in case you have problems
2007-10-17T19:51:00.000Z	Slart	MasterShrek	hmm.. I've heard of a "next version" that uses another xorg.conf .. a more failsafe one... that doesn't work for me.. so I was hoping for a better answer =)
