2009-05-03T10:24:00.000Z	Madpilot	shiznebit	the official sources are secure. that's the whole point of the PGP Keys and other authentication/security stuff...
2009-05-03T10:25:00.000Z	shiznebit	Madpilot	as in they are looked over and inspected for backdoors, compatibility, etc ?
2009-05-03T10:25:00.000Z	Madpilot	shiznebit	it's all open source software. that's the whole point, ANYONE can look over the code.
