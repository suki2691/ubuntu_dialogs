2008-12-07T01:41:00.000Z	LjL	Jamaulbrown	i'm not aware there is any DNS cache by default?
2008-12-07T01:42:00.000Z	Jamaulbrown	LjL	 is it not like windows where it caches the already resolved DNS addresses?
2008-12-07T01:46:00.000Z	LjL	Jamaulbrown	not as far as i know. you can install deamons that do that (dnsmasq is the one i use), but by default i don't think there's anything like that.
