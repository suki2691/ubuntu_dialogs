2008-07-23T16:01:00.000Z	jo_e		is it possible that the driver for my sata controller has been taken out of the linux kernel? i can't update my kernel and i can't install the new ubuntu from the cd.
2008-07-23T16:03:00.000Z	jo_e		or would my problem be that i downloaded the amd64 cd? i thought that would be the correct one; i have an intel core 2 duo

2008-07-23T16:07:00.000Z	jo_e	bazhang	thanks, i guess i'll try that then, i have 2gb of ram so it should be ok
