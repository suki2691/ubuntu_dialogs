2005-12-24T12:17:00.000Z	greenpenguin13		my apache server doesnt seem to want to run .php files :/
2005-12-24T12:17:00.000Z	greenpenguin13		it just passes me the actual script
2005-12-24T12:19:00.000Z	greenpenguin13		the .phps are executable and ive got mod_php
2005-12-24T12:19:00.000Z	trappist	greenpenguin13	they shouldn't be executable unless you're running them as cgi scripts
