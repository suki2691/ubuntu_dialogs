2006-12-29T15:43:00.000Z	inverno		Okay then. I've been trying to install Ubuntu for a while now, downloading and burning the cd several times. Whenever I go to start/install the os it loads a orangish screen and gives me a cursor. After a few seconds the cursor stops moving. If I do the video safe option a box that says 'ubuntu' in the upper right comes up, and then it locks.
