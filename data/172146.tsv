2008-10-04T03:21:00.000Z	Heston		Hello, top is reporting fairly high mem usuage - Is the cache included in this total, as that is fairly high aswell.
2008-10-04T03:23:00.000Z	soundray	Heston	yes. Cache usage goes down dynamically as memory usage for application data increases
2008-10-04T03:24:00.000Z	Heston	soundray	so can i subtract "Cached" from Mem: "used" to determine how much is actually used by applications?
2008-10-04T03:25:00.000Z	Heston	soundray	er nevermind
