2008-03-27T05:35:00.000Z	njenkins		Hey all I've been happy and am familiar enough with my linux that I want to remove the XP and give the other partition to linux how do I do this?
2008-03-27T05:35:00.000Z	njenkins		Installed I have to choose from Linux or XP everytime I boot
2008-03-27T05:35:00.000Z	rbil	njenkins	just format the windoze partition as ext3 and build a mount point in fstab
2008-03-27T05:40:00.000Z	rbil	njenkins	didn't say it was, but could bring down his system, whereas the simple route is just to reformat the part. and mount it
