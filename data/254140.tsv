2009-01-17T20:45:00.000Z	portz		Trying to open a .rar file with archive manager, saying it's not supported. Suggestions?
2009-01-17T20:46:00.000Z	portz		Nope. I thought Archive Manager would have supported rar by default.
2009-01-17T20:48:00.000Z	andrew_	portz	do this: sudo apt-get install unrar-free
2009-01-17T20:45:00.000Z	andrew_	portz	do you have "unrar"?
