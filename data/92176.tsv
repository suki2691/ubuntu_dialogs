2010-07-11T05:18:00.000Z	ariqz	ubuntu	doesn't detect my modem. I'm now in windows looking at a website on dialup modem howto, however, the links for the tools on detecting my modem's chipset are linux and not windows tools, which is silly because I can't get to the page in linux. How do I figure out what drivers I need in windows?

2010-09-10T03:03:00.000Z	ariqz	ubuntu	is a mess of constant hardships. I think people that hate on windows and talk about how great linux is are crazy
