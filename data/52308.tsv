2009-07-20T09:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	R0ncoToke	 ive toyed with kde4 - its gotten more and more useable every month..   but i still use gnome more  for now.
2009-07-20T10:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	R0ncoToke	 actually add in features that people want! :) but are too 'complex' for them.. Like.. err... 'screen saver configuration!'
