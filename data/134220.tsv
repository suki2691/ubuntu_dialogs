2007-05-18T08:09:00.000Z	LuisGMarine		Hello I'm trying to install Doom 3 , but it gives me an error that I don't have write permissions to /usr/local?
2007-05-18T08:09:00.000Z	LuisGMarine		I thought /usr was owned by the user, not root?
2007-05-18T08:11:00.000Z	reanjr	LuisGMarine	no /usr/local is for user stuff that is only specific to the local installation, but can only be written by root
2007-05-18T08:12:00.000Z	LuisGMarine	reanjr	yeah , I just dug something else on google.  Apperently people use the sudo command for the installer, I thought it was some bug with AMD64
