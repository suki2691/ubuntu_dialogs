2009-10-06T14:55:00.000Z	haymaker		hey just wondering if im not the only person having this issue, but is anyone using the Karmic Koala beta getting pulseaudio issues?  it will randomly stop for me and can only be fixed by restarting the process
2009-10-06T14:56:00.000Z	krs2	haymaker	that issue has been with ubuntu since they switched to pulseaudio
2009-10-06T14:57:00.000Z	haymaker	krs2	 really.. i've had issues but not with it actually stopping, at least not until i started using Karmic
2009-10-06T14:58:00.000Z	krs2	haymaker	i had it in jaunty as well, bug is still in in karmic =|
