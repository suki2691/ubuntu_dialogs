2011-06-10T21:24:00.000Z	brown_fern	szal	I just got in here and wasn't around for the entire conversation, but pointing out the general nature of Linux distributions not including built-in support for some key media types was the point of my posting that page.
2011-06-10T21:26:00.000Z	szal	brown_fern	the issue at hand is that I installed lame and flac from *buntu installation sources and was wondering why lame won't take FLAC as input format
