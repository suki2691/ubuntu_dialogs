2005-08-10T16:26:00.000Z	kev_	Seveas	any thoughts on why it (dpkg or that little systray thing) would complain about not being able to authenticate the packages?
2005-08-10T16:26:00.000Z	Seveas	kev_	perhaps you use nonstandard repositories
2005-08-10T16:27:00.000Z	kev_	Seveas	this is in a fresh install. even on the first reboot when it goes on the network to download updated packages it complained. the install occurred ~5 min ago
