2008-08-20T08:05:00.000Z	cptreg		i am copying my root partition to another hd.  is it possible to unmount my / partition and remount the new, copied partition on the fly without restarting?
2008-08-20T08:06:00.000Z	Gnea	cptreg	no!
2008-08-20T08:06:00.000Z	cptreg	Gnea	ok, thought so,  what is the reason exactly?
2008-08-20T08:10:00.000Z	Gnea	cptreg	because ubuntu doesn't base off of the device node
