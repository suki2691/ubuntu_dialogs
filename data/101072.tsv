2008-08-15T04:36:00.000Z	stemount^	IndyGunFreak	indeed, but isn't KDE the default?
2008-08-15T04:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	stemount^	i don't think so.. i actually thought Xfce was. could be wrong though, been ages since i used it(since the idea behind slack is to be light, i'd be very surprised if it defaults to KDE)
2008-08-15T04:38:00.000Z	stemount^	IndyGunFreak	a voice application, like Skype and Teamspeak
