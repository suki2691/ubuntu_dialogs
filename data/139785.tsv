2012-03-18T04:34:00.000Z	shawnboy		I just fell and dropped my notebook PC while in 10.04 LTS. I forced off, turned on, and it freezes at the "ubuntu" with the dots underneath.
2012-03-18T04:35:00.000Z	shawnboy		Now I'm in Karmic partition on same computer, which is apparently working.
2012-03-18T04:35:00.000Z	shawnboy		any suggestions how to rescue LTS?
2012-03-18T04:35:00.000Z	velko_	shawnboy	i would guess that an fsck on the system partition that does not boot will suffice
