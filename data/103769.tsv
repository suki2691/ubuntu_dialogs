2011-02-13T18:55:00.000Z	dementekill		somebody know how to recover erased data from a hard drive
2011-02-13T18:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dementekill	backups are going to be easiest by far
2011-02-13T18:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dementekill	foremost can possibly restore data assuming it isn't overwritten with new data but its not 100% reliable
