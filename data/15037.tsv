2011-04-28T02:44:00.000Z	mw007		Hello all. After upgrading to 11.04 beta, my X session keeps freezing. The mouse cursor can still move periodically, but all of the windows will not work. This happens after I login and begin using the session. Video card = nVidia Corporation G96 [GeForce 9500 GT]
2011-04-28T02:44:00.000Z	mw007		I've read that using the nouveau driver fixes this, but how do I enable it?
2011-04-28T02:46:00.000Z	histo	mw007	you'd have to remove the nvidia binary driver if you want to try the nouveau driver
2011-04-28T02:48:00.000Z	mw007	histo	Makes sense. Just joined ubuntu recently. Is that as simple as uninstalling the nvidia driver and installing the nouveau driver?
