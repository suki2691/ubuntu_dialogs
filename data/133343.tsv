2007-06-18T15:59:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	guillem101	preferences, keyboard
2007-06-18T16:00:00.000Z	guillem101	Sh3r1ff	magnetron, OK, but I mean the way that the installer does at the very beginning (all users, console, etc)
2007-06-18T16:14:00.000Z	guillem101	Sh3r1ff	magnetron, nm, I can manage with the way you point :-)
