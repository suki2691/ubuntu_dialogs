2008-11-22T01:30:00.000Z	Reenen	cyball	I think you can just run your apt-get (aptitude) > filename.txt
2008-11-22T01:32:00.000Z	cyball	Reenen	i do not want to do apt-get into file i want to write an installation script the problem is if the package does not exist and i set more than one package to be installed the one that does not exist does not install but all the others do
