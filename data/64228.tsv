2010-04-19T08:48:00.000Z	DankNugs		 Hey, I'm wondering if someone could help me walk through some steps to figure out why my boot screen is blank after grub loads kernel.
2010-04-19T08:49:00.000Z	DankNugs		A few days ago, the latest build of lucid was working great. THen after a few updates, I can't get to gdm. It shows loading screen, goes blank. Doesn't respond to ctrl+alt+f# keys
2010-04-19T08:51:00.000Z	DankNugs		Oh, my bad.
