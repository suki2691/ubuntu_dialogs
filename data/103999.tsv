2010-11-09T01:02:00.000Z	ieri		Good - if anyone else is looking for a quicker download, I suggest sending them there.  They seem to have more bandwidth available (which isn't surprising, since ubuntu.com must get a lot more traffic)

2010-11-09T01:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ieri	then wait you must :(
