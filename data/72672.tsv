2008-12-04T12:07:00.000Z	dav7	bdelin88	you might also say why audacity isn't working... it's actually pretty good
2008-12-04T12:07:00.000Z	bdelin88	dav7	yes i know it's great, but the freaking sound doesn't play on mine, it works perfectly on windows!
2008-12-04T12:09:00.000Z	dav7	bdelin88	well, if audacity isn't working, it's likely a sound issue. there are no real absolutes there; you might just try poking around in preferences->audio
