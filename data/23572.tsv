2010-10-24T10:30:00.000Z	gMinuses	rww	you are right. I did try to remove them. so they are developed by evolution but not relate to the email client?
2010-10-24T10:31:00.000Z	rww	gMinuses	as I understand it, it was developed for evolution and is now used by gnomish things in general.
2010-10-24T10:34:00.000Z	gMinuses	rww	Got it. I will try to not remove them the next time. Thanks
