2010-04-02T00:33:00.000Z	Hollyecho		I have ubuntu 9.10, want to use a printer that is connected to a Windows 7 machine. I have the printer shared, and the shared works with the other windows computers, but when trying to connect with Ubuntu, it keeps asking for a user name and password.  I have never setup a password on any of my windows machines.  How to make it connect to Ubuntu?

2010-04-02T00:34:00.000Z	Hollyecho		Windows os is doing the sharing
