2007-04-06T07:43:00.000Z	rysiek|pl		I am about to install ubuntu from ground up - and obviously I need to make the choice between edgy and feisty beta
2007-04-06T07:44:00.000Z	rysiek|pl		is feisty stable enough for a n00b and will beryl work on it? or should I start with edgy now and dist-upgrade to feisty later?
2007-04-06T07:44:00.000Z	jin	rysiek|pl	nope
