2006-03-25T08:29:00.000Z	Gwynn		I remember a time when my 40Mb HD had to be formatted in 32 and 8 Mb cause the current dos version couldnt handle larger, and you consider *what* wastefull? :-D
2006-03-25T08:31:00.000Z	Gwynn		I could put my games (leisure suit larry, police quest, kings quest) all on the 8 Mb part, now a game patch is 3x the entire ancient HD
2006-03-25T08:33:00.000Z	Gwynn		and the only reason Im staring at an M$ machine is oss adept dont get them games runnin' .. silly cause like the jesuits said: gimme a child under 12 and I give you a christian for life.. SUPPORT GAMES dammit! :-D
