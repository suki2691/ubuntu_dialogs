2007-02-12T13:21:00.000Z	mojo	fiberchunks	omg it was that easy all along.  thanks a lot! i haven't the greatest eyesight so, like, i would hug you if i could or something
2007-02-12T13:35:00.000Z	fiberchunks	mojo	the setting you want (after fiddling with it), is under Edit->preferences->Content "Fonts & Colors" (click advanced) and change the 'minimum font size setting to something else (like 16)
2007-02-12T13:36:00.000Z	mojo	fiberchunks	was 16, changed to 20 for my tastes.. and thanks again
