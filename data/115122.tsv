2007-12-19T18:41:00.000Z	Nallep		I need to restart a remote computer, how can I send a message to the users x windows that the system is being rebooted, and they need to save all their work?

2007-12-19T18:43:00.000Z	Nallep	icedwater	I did, but it doesn't send a message to the users desktop that the system is being rebooted.
2007-12-19T18:45:00.000Z	Nallep	icedwater	If the user has a console open, they will see the message, but if they don't, I want a dialog box to open up on the users desktop notifying them that they need to save work.
