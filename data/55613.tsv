2009-06-04T00:38:00.000Z	EndlesslyCurious		Is a dell mini 10v netbook with 1.6GHZ cpu, 1GB ram and 16 gb SSD drive going to run Ubuntu fine?  And would the netbook remix be a better choice?  I'm looking to surf and code python on it...
2009-06-04T00:39:00.000Z	fccf	EndlesslyCurious	the netbook remix is designed for the dell mini -- works great
