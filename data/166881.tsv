2006-09-27T05:11:00.000Z	Scorched		i'm running Ubuntu Dapper, and have completely confused my apache2 and php5 install, is there an easy way to reinstall apache2 to get a clean slate so I can start over instead of trying to fix the mess I made?
2006-09-27T05:11:00.000Z	mrcuteo	Scorched	sudo apt-get remove apache2
2006-09-27T05:12:00.000Z	Scorched	mrcuteo	I tried that, and it left everything in place and apache was still running
2006-09-27T05:13:00.000Z	mrcuteo	Scorched	do you install apache2 from .deb packages? or manual compilations?
