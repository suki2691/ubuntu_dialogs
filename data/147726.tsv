2007-01-26T10:43:00.000Z	oljanx		hey, linux newb question here, is there a decent web based IDE like dreamweaver that I might find a in the package manager?
2007-01-26T10:44:00.000Z	timephoenix	oljanx	Have you looked at Nvu?
2007-01-26T10:45:00.000Z	oljanx	timephoenix	I'll look it up.  Chatty:  I've used eclipse as a c/c++ IDE before, I hadn't thought of that
