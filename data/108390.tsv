2009-05-22T23:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Airion	and so  it still thinks  it's running and so Ubuntu can't just open and use it
2009-05-22T23:51:00.000Z	Airion	sebsebseb	no, i had that problem earlyer and got a message that i can't mount, but no i can mount perfectly, in can go into the folder and see in dolphin how much space is left
