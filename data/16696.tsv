2011-10-23T18:44:00.000Z	HelloWorld321		I fuond that Ocelot "broke" my synergy.  I let it over-write my session scripts, and now I'm following http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/autostart.html to get it going again, but gdm doesn't see it.
2011-10-23T18:45:00.000Z	jrib	HelloWorld321	you know lightdm, not gdm is default now?
2011-10-23T21:10:00.000Z	jrib	HelloWorld321	if you want to, sure.  But what exactly did you do to "mess it up"?
2011-10-23T21:12:00.000Z	HelloWorld321	jrib	glad you asked ... I tried to setup synergyc to auto-start, like I had it under gdm.  my gdm installation followed http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/autostart.html
