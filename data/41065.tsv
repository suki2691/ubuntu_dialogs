2010-03-20T10:54:00.000Z	misterB		Does anybody know how to get DSL working in karmic? I've tried pppoeconf. That messed with my network devices and caused a big headache. I tried adding the launchpad ppa, and I had no wireless. Can anybody help me out?
2010-03-20T10:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	misterB	thats the way you set it up, if you grab a router you don't have that hastle ;)
2010-03-20T10:56:00.000Z	misterB	ActionParsnip	Like I said. pppoeconf broke my computer before. That's why I'm here asking.
2010-03-20T10:56:00.000Z	misterB	ActionParsnip	and the person I'm setting it up for doesn't have a router and doesn't want to buy one.
