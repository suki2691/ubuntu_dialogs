2009-10-06T00:48:00.000Z	th0ger		Hi, could someone please try if they can see flash on this page: http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/e90b813d#/e90b813d/1 ... It tells me that my flash version is too old, and quickly displays a grey page.
2009-10-06T00:49:00.000Z	th0ger		I have the newest flash player (adobe-flashplugin 10.0.32.18-1jaunty1)
