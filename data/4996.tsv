2012-04-20T08:06:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	YohanMeister	look at the minimal net download.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
2012-04-20T08:12:00.000Z	YohanMeister	Fyodorovna	It appears they don't have 12.04 available for that. I know it isn't released yet, but it's beta 2 now so should be useable. I found a link for a 12.04 core system but don't see any specific info about whether it's for 64 bit sytems or if it can install to an efi system (an efi installation). Any ideas?
2012-04-20T08:13:00.000Z	YohanMeister		Is there a way to do it from the standard install cd, or I would have to go in an remove the desktop environment after install if I installed that way?
2012-04-20T08:14:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	YohanMeister	efi I would not know myself how but I believe if needed can be done.
