2007-07-06T07:28:00.000Z	ScottLij		I'm just trying to transfer a file from the ubuntu box to the Windows box but I can't because the Ubuntu box can't connect to any windows box on the network and the windows boxes need a valid username and password
2007-07-06T07:29:00.000Z	ScottLij		ok, now where is that located?
2007-07-06T07:29:00.000Z	macogw	ScottLij	probably under /etc with all the other config stuf
2007-07-06T07:30:00.000Z	ScottLij	macogw	Yup, thanks
