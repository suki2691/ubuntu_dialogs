2007-02-13T09:41:00.000Z	Dev-		i get an error message saying that my screen is not configured correctly whenever i try to boot from the live cd, and it never goes to the splash screen.  does anyone know how to fix this?
2007-02-13T09:42:00.000Z	shatrat	Dev-	try the safe graphic setting entry on the boot menu, and if that doesnt work, Id just try downloading the alternative text based install CD, sometimes the liveCD is more hassle than it's worth
2007-02-13T09:43:00.000Z	shatrat	Dev-	hmm, dont even get to the splash screen.  Maybe it was a bad burn or corrupt iso download?
2007-02-13T09:45:00.000Z	shatrat	Dev-	Yeah I wouldnt be surprised.  I usually only burn at high speed with audio disks, data disks I burn at like 4x
