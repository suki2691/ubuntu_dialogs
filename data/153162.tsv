2007-07-12T06:01:00.000Z	ind73		Need some advise,  I installed Ubuntu server for my web server.  I know have a project that i need to get the server running in production environment,  Problem is i am still learning Linux.  Should I A) Stick with Ubuntu Server B) install Ubuntu Desktop so i can at least use a GUI if i run into problems, or C) Go back to Windows2k3  I currently use Mac OS X as my primary desktop so i am fairly familure with the command line

2007-07-12T06:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ind73	wel, then go w/ ubuntu desktop
2007-07-12T06:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ind73	but you specifically said, "i'm still learning linux"..
