2009-05-13T03:37:00.000Z	careta		i'm going to install ubuntu on a friends notebook. is there any problem in installing the 64bit version, like incompatible drivers or programs?
2009-05-13T03:38:00.000Z	careta		i'm just asking because windows had lots of problems with that, and i heard there is not 64-bit flash player
