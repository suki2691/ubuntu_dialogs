2009-07-20T18:24:00.000Z	rhpot1991		ok so printing, I have a pixma ip 8500, cups had a setting for this by default.  Image quality is pretty bad, I'm thinking its because it can only do 600dpi.  So I guess the first thing I'd like to know is if there is a way I can change this, I can't seem to find a ppd associated with the printer to modify.
