2007-07-21T09:25:00.000Z	macgeek		is there a way I can upgrade from 5.10 to 6.06 or 7.04 without needing a CD? Perhaps a large update or something? I only have the 5.10 CDs and haven't had any luck burning my own CDs in the past
2007-07-21T09:25:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	macgeek	I believe there is
2007-07-21T09:25:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	macgeek	I think its like sudo update-manager -c or something
2007-07-21T09:26:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	macgeek	you'll have to upgrade to 6.06 then 6.10 then 7.04
