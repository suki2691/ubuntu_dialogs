2006-09-28T13:34:00.000Z	thedash		ok, so mkfs.vfat is giving me an error about a 'full-disk device' that I don't really understand
2006-09-28T13:36:00.000Z	thedash		lupine_85::  I was trying to format a drive to FAT32
2006-09-28T13:37:00.000Z	thedash		lupine_85:: the drive has no partitions atm, it is new and completely blank
2006-09-28T13:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	thedash	 you did fdisk it and make a vfat partition on it then to format?
