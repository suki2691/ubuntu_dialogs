2008-06-27T03:57:00.000Z	khari	Guest81952	so you edited xorg.conf to this - http://pastebin.com/m3a832035 and it made no difference at all? including the horizsync and vertrefresh lines?
2008-06-27T04:04:00.000Z	khari	Guest81952	have you tried changing nvidia settings using the nvidia-settings app?
2008-06-27T04:08:00.000Z	khari	Guest81952	there isn't much you can change in there, just wanted to check it was picking up the res correctly. you could try clicking on Detect Displays and see what that does for you
