2008-08-08T03:58:00.000Z	TiredWolf	timothywcrane	why don't you post them as bugreports with attached patches into launchpad?
2008-08-08T03:59:00.000Z	TiredWolf	timothywcrane	few chances there's any core dev here reading right now
2008-08-08T04:00:00.000Z	TiredWolf	timothywcrane	perhaps try #ubuntu-devel instead.
