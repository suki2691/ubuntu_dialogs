2007-04-20T09:11:00.000Z	RAOF	Antioch	There's no 64bit flash player.  That's about it.
2007-04-20T09:12:00.000Z	Antioch	RAOF	cant you use the 32-bit version on the 64-bit system? I thought tehre was backwards compatibility
2007-04-20T09:13:00.000Z	RAOF	Antioch	Yes, you can use the 32bit flashplayer, but you'll need a 32bit firefox, etc.  Basically, it's a bit more hassle.
