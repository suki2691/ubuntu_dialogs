2009-08-28T05:42:00.000Z	aj_444		I decided to download ephiphany browser using the add/remove programs. I can't find it on my system though.
2009-08-28T05:43:00.000Z	linux	aj_444	try in GNOME, left drop down menu, internet; if not there, go to terminal and type ephiphany like judgen said
2009-08-28T05:46:00.000Z	linux	aj_444	try right clicking applications at the top right and see if there is an option to edit menu? might be under system -> preferences -> edit menu also
2009-08-28T05:47:00.000Z	aj_444	linux	judgen: I figured it out. Thanks for the help. :)
