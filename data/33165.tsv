2011-02-10T02:18:00.000Z	blind	Loshki	it's a generic brand from radioshack. my guess is i wont be able to see if it'll work without trying it
2011-02-10T02:22:00.000Z	Loshki	blind	depends on the chipset usually. Is there a model number anywhere on the card?
2011-02-10T02:47:00.000Z	blind	Loshki	is Empia a brand name that sounds familiar? i opened it up and the only chip with clear writing says empia em2862
