2007-03-23T11:29:00.000Z	Stormx2		Hey folks. Used ubuntu 6.06 live cd to shrink an ntfs partition containing windows 2000, and created 2 further ext3/swap partitions. it looked like it worked, but now the fs can't be recognised on any of the partitions and my bios won't boot windows (can't find operating system). Any suggestions? The mobo won't boot burnt cds..
