2010-12-30T12:32:00.000Z	cody_		hey, i'm trying to install IE7 on Wine 1.2.2 through Winetricks, and right after the extraction finishes (just as the installer actually starts) I get a "The program has encountered a serious error" message, I have a pastebin with the contents of Terminal at the time of the error, i've been trying this for a couple hours now.
2010-12-30T12:33:00.000Z	gobbe	cody_	should IE7 work with wine?
2010-12-30T12:38:00.000Z	gobbe	cody_	you should know that most of the windows-games are not working under linux
2010-12-30T12:38:00.000Z	gobbe	cody_	i mean with wine etc
