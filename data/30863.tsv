2010-06-01T17:31:00.000Z	bogeyd6-		I am using a Compaq 6715b laptop and I can set my laptop to feed the display out to my monitor. When I close the laptop lid my monitor blanks out. I checked the power settings and on the part for "When I close the lid" it gives me only 4 options "blank, suspend, hibernate, shutdown". How can I set it so I can close my lid and it does not blank the screen?

2010-06-01T17:32:00.000Z	bogeyd6-	mguy	no
