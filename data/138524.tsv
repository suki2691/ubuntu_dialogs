2008-05-27T15:31:00.000Z	Slasher`		hi all, i was wondering if someone could give me a hand... i installed apache2 and completely buggered it up so i did an apt-get remove and removed the apache2 directory in /etc/... now when i reinstall apache2 via apt i cant get it back... is there any way i can get the apache2 directory back?
