2007-10-01T08:55:00.000Z	hjmills	clouder	are you legally allowed to install them?
2007-10-01T08:55:00.000Z	hjmills	clouder	aka, do you have a windows license and a license for some form of software such as powerdvd/windvd etc for each format that is there.
2007-10-01T08:56:00.000Z	hjmills	clouder	i think that is the law in most places anyway
