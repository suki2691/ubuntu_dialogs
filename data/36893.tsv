2010-04-18T05:46:00.000Z	dantix		night! I'm trying to install sogo package on karmic, but it needs libssl0.8.9k and karmic comes with 0.8.9g. I've found Lucid have the version I need. How can I install it? I've tryed adding lucid as source at source.list later apt-get update and apt-get -t lucid install libssl with no luck...
