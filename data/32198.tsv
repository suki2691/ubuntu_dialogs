2010-09-03T21:56:00.000Z	martez89		I upgraded to 10.10 today, but when I try to start evolution nothing happens. When I put sudo apt-get install evolution in terminal I get this: The following packages have unmet dependencies: evolution : Depends: evolution-data-server (>= 2.30.2) but it is not going to be installed Depends: evolution-data-server (< 2.31) but it is not going to be installed E: Broken packages
2010-09-03T21:56:00.000Z	martez89		what can I do to solve this?
2010-09-03T21:56:00.000Z	undecim	martez89	10.10 support is in #ubuntu+1
