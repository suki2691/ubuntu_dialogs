2006-06-23T09:18:00.000Z	sid		Hi, I installed a program with wine (wine setup.exe)  .  now how do I launch that program ?
2006-06-23T09:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	sid	 see where it put the executable and try 'wine /path/to/whatever.exe'
2006-06-23T09:20:00.000Z	sid	dr_willis	: wine says wine: cannot find '/path/to/bioedit.exe'
2006-06-23T09:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	sid	 and you do understand that you need to use the ACTUAL PATH,,, not the example /PATH/TO/  eh?
