2009-01-17T00:02:00.000Z	danes_		I know this is not the appropriate channel to ask this, but I do not know where else to do it. Anyone knows of an emulator to check if a usb drive made bootable works without restarting the computer?

2009-01-17T00:04:00.000Z	danes_	simplexio	thanks, that was the one I was looking for, but I couldnt remember the name
2009-01-17T00:04:00.000Z	simplexio	danes_	i know for fact that virtualbox binary release allow using usb as "raw" device
