2007-06-12T15:54:00.000Z	emgstn		I killed x-window, and now ubuntu loads directly to console and when I startx, it goes straight to gnome, skipping the session manager.  I want to be able to choose my desktop environment again; how do I get the session manager to load on start up again. :(  Forgive my noobness. hehe..
