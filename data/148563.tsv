2010-07-30T11:23:00.000Z	fiber		hi.... i was wondering what the name for the program is to change the restricted drivers.  I downgraded the graphics driver and now i can only see half the screen (and can't get back to the window!).
2010-07-30T11:25:00.000Z	fiber		can someone please check what the program name for the gui to change the restricted drivers is (the one in system->administration)
