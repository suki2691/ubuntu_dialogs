2008-05-06T18:53:00.000Z	pajamian	lmosher	that doesn't say a lot, most cards will have the label of the card manufacturer, but what Linux cares about is the chipset make and manufacturer which is often times different.
2008-05-06T18:54:00.000Z	lmosher	pajamian	Well you can usually figure it out once you identify the card, but you're correct
2008-05-06T18:55:00.000Z	pajamian	lmosher	I owuld just boot to the ubuntu minimal CD or the alternate install CD (has a rescue mode that is a console linux) and do an lspci from there.
