2011-11-13T02:06:00.000Z	LSymonds	monsemannen	perhaps it is already installed?
2011-11-13T02:07:00.000Z	monsemannen	LSymonds	no. I don't think so at least. Installing rdoc after ruby removes ruby, and vice versa.
2011-11-13T02:09:00.000Z	monsemannen	LSymonds	I'm using oneiric: could that be problematic.
