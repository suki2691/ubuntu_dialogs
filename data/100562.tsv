2009-09-10T11:23:00.000Z	NeroGoth		Hello just have a quick question if someone can help (yes I am a noob)
2009-09-10T11:25:00.000Z	NeroGoth		I can Create or Make  a Link of a file or such, how do I edit that link? Or better yet see where it is linked to so I know where the file actually exist. For example my link to FoxFire, but where is the bin and so forth, easiest solution, look at where the launching link goes, but hwo do I do that?
2009-09-10T11:27:00.000Z	NeroGoth		FYI From GUI please
