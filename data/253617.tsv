2005-01-10T09:31:00.000Z	nordle		Hello, is it possible to install Ubuntu-AMD64 on /dev/hdb2, where the 3 partitions on the second hard disk are all primary, and then get grub to install on /dev/hda MBR?  I ask because I have installed ubuntu successfully on /dev/hda2 and grub on the mbr of hda, but when I try hdb2 grub fails to do anything when the PC us booted, it sais "grub stage 1.5 please wait..." then does nothing for 5 mins.  Does it matter that grub is on hda and ubuntu is on hdb?  O
2005-01-10T09:31:00.000Z	nordle		r could the error be cause by having 3 primary partitions on hdb, rather than logical?  Any ideas please?

2005-01-10T09:33:00.000Z	nordle	dr_willis	I should have mentioned that on hda it was ubuntu i386, and its the amd64 version which wont boot on hdb (with grub still hda)....mmmmm ok, I will check grub now (mount partition from other distro) thanks.
