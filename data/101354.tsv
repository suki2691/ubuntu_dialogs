2008-06-01T06:18:00.000Z	jack_spratt	Packerfan	theres lots of more efficient distros,
2008-06-01T06:19:00.000Z	jack_spratt	Packerfan	tinyme springs to mind, but there are others that are better still for old machines
2008-06-01T06:21:00.000Z	jack_spratt	Packerfan	there are ways to install without CD, I dont know how to do it with buntu, i can only advise regarding other distros. in windows however you could presumably create a virtual cd drive and then mount an iso you could import from somewhere or download, and then install buntu using wubi
