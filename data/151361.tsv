2007-02-11T11:52:00.000Z	AmaroqWolf	mytruehero	ctrl+alt+left or ctrl+alt+right arrows
2007-02-11T11:53:00.000Z	mytruehero	AmaroqWolf	That's not quite what I'd like to do. I want to set alt+caps lock to cycle through all of my workspaces. I can figure out how to set it to move to the workspace to the right, or move to the workspace to the left, but not how to get it to cycle through all of them continuously. Is there a way to do that?
