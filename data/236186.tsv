2006-01-05T14:18:00.000Z	Nik--		is it silly to install Windows and Ubuntu on the same drive different partitions?
2006-01-05T14:19:00.000Z	Nik--		right
2006-01-05T14:21:00.000Z	Nik--		what happens if i want to format and reinstall the Windows partition? would Ubuntu have to be formatted and reinstalled as well, or would the bootloader just have to be reinstalled?
