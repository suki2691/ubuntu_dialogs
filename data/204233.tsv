2005-12-18T17:07:00.000Z	earldude1		Hey everyone!  I just installed a default version of Breezy.  Is there a way modify some sort of config file or something in order to make the OS NOT automatically load gnome but rather just boot to a prompt or should I have done a server install instead?

2005-12-18T17:08:00.000Z	earldude1	stef65	 how do I do that? or, where can I read about runlevels and how to change them
2005-12-18T17:09:00.000Z	stef65	earldude1	complex question... 'google and read' is my suggestion
