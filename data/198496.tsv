2006-05-24T16:02:00.000Z	hobojoe		Ok i installed ubuntu with ext3, everything worked, then i rebooted and it started to install some other packages.
2006-05-24T16:03:00.000Z	hobojoe		anyway I believe it just tryed to start X, because my screen went out of sync. I can go to a normal term, but I havn't even setup a root account yet
2006-05-24T16:03:00.000Z	Quinch	hobojoe	It sounds like it's installing updates for the packages you already have installed?
