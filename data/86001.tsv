2008-07-10T03:37:00.000Z	macrobad	shade2	Hey! I'm glad that you managed. So, what was wrong with the switch?
2008-07-10T03:40:00.000Z	shade2	macrobad	I'm not really sure. I had tried once to change the cable to a different port, but that didn't fix anything, and I could still receive promiscuous traffic, so I didn't think that was the problem. Well, later I swapped it's cable with one from one of my vista boxes, and it worked. Strangely, when the internet downstream cable was plugged into port 2, only ports 1 and 3 (out of 8) could use the network. Later I moved the main netw
2008-07-10T03:42:00.000Z	macrobad	shade2	Indeed, weird! Especially, given that you have an unmanaged switch... But hey, I've repeated all the basic troubshooting commands while trying to help you! :)
