2010-07-11T22:03:00.000Z	andre_pl		I've been avoiding 64-bit distros for years due to reports of instability, lack of ported apps etc... and today I'm wondering if thats still a valid reason? should I be running a 64-bit linux? what are the advantages?

2010-07-11T22:06:00.000Z	switch10_	andre_pl	stick with the 32 bit.
2010-07-11T22:07:00.000Z	andre_pl	switch10_	I think I might, I just feel like I'm missing out on something.. .but it seems like that something might just be "problems"
