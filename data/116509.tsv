2007-10-27T14:50:00.000Z	ifireball		hi I just got a system-crash during an upgrade to gusty, how can I resume it?
2007-10-27T14:50:00.000Z	[chr0n0s]	ifireball	start over, it takes 30-40 mins anyways
2007-10-27T14:52:00.000Z	ifireball	[chr0n0s]	it was right in the middle of upgrading gdm, I'm running dpkg --pending --configure in single mode right now, not sure I can even get back to gui at this stage
2007-10-27T14:53:00.000Z	ifireball	[chr0n0s]	I just want to know what the "cleanup" stage does
