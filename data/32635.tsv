2011-02-12T12:42:00.000Z	_jesse_	aaron_	strange, what about running `gksudo synaptic` from the cli?
2011-02-12T12:44:00.000Z	aaron_	_jesse_	gksudo works fine, however the dialogue box is slightly different - selecting synaptic from the gui gives a dialogue box that includes options to remember the password for the session, doesn't matter what I choose there, the dialgoue doesn't recognize my password
