I've got a script that spoofs my mac address that runs on startup: http://pastebin.com/kaPpG7CD and while it does change my mac, and NetworkManager does attempt to connect, something stops it from going through with the connection, I get the network key prompt with the _correct_ WPA key sitting in the passphrase textbox. I have tried a variety of things, including telling...

I'm thinking it MIGHT be that when I toggle the card, it reloads the drivers and that's what the issue is, but I haven't found a way to verify. I thank you for your help in advance.
