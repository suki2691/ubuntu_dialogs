2006-10-08T14:54:00.000Z	Alexus		I'm trying set adsl connection and have already installed the driver (ADLS indicator is ON). But I can't connect to Internet. My provider uses PPPoE. Here is the log after " sudo pppd call ueagle-atm": Using interface ppp0; Connect: ppp0 <--> 0.51; LCP: timeout sending Config-Requests; Connection terminated; Modem hangup.
2006-10-08T14:54:00.000Z	Alexus		Can anybody help me?
2006-10-08T14:55:00.000Z	Alexus		what can I do, where should I move?
2006-10-08T14:55:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Alexus	is your modem detected properly? I don't think its working correctly.
