2007-10-27T00:09:00.000Z	jambon		would someone here give me a hand with my dual monitor setup? I'm running 7.10 on a laptop (ati card), and it was running fine, except for the refresh rate and resolution being low on my second monitor. I tried to fix it, telling ubuntu what the second monitor was, and to make it default (the laptop screen is broken, and I don't want it to turn on. ever.) Now I'm stuck in 800x600 and AWN won't show. Any ideas?
2007-10-27T00:11:00.000Z	jambon		is dual monitors really that much of a problem?
2007-10-27T00:12:00.000Z	jambon		I'll give it a shot
