2007-05-06T12:26:00.000Z	Dremth		Does anyone know the maximum size for my splash screen image?
2007-05-06T12:26:00.000Z	ciscosurfer	Dremth	no...what is it?
2007-05-06T12:30:00.000Z	Dremth	ciscosurfer	I don't know what it is. That's why I was asking. I have a splash screen that's 1440x900 because after I login I want my splash screen to look like my background with text on it. But when I set it to that image, it will just change to the default gnome splash image
