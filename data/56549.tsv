2009-12-11T05:48:00.000Z	cn28h	aliendude5300	when you say upgrade, you mean do a fresh install?
2009-12-11T05:49:00.000Z	aliendude5300	cn28h	yeah... but I want to everything the same and restore it easily, like firefox settings and my home folder. would copying the home folder be enough? I was thinking about installing both Ubuntu 32bit and 64bit at the same time and then deleting the 32bit when I copy everything, but it might break something. I have a 1.5TB hard drive. Space is not an issue.
