2010-11-16T06:16:00.000Z	Chaos2358		hey guys i am running 10.10 on a laptop and have the laptop connected to a 46 in television via s-video cable. i have great picture but the text is a little small. I have tried desktop zoom function from compiz and it apparentlly isnt compatible with video out and i have also tried changing the screen resolution. when i change resolution the text is enlarged but the second monitor "television" flickers really really badly. any ideas on how to either fix
2010-11-16T06:16:00.000Z	Chaos2358		 this or an app i can use to get same results?
2010-11-16T06:17:00.000Z	bawn	Chaos2358	do you have the appropriate drivers?
2010-11-16T06:20:00.000Z	bawn	Chaos2358	i happened to have the same problem too, before, and figured out that tv's arent my thing
