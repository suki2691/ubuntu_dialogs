2009-06-05T22:16:00.000Z	mneptok	Wipster	what kind of mouse? manufacturer? model?
2009-06-05T22:18:00.000Z	Wipster	mneptok	lithax, the mouse is a Kensington wireless usb mouse - I cant test it on another system easily, tho it detects what the mouse is so its probably working just not set as the input device
