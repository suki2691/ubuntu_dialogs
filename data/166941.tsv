2009-07-12T23:30:00.000Z	swtaarrs	Flannel	ok, is there a way to get 64-bit builds from mozilla? I haven't found any on their ftp site
2009-07-12T23:31:00.000Z	Flannel	swtaarrs	I have no idea, sorry.  You might ask #ubuntu-mozillateam, they'd be more familiar with the way mozilla does stuff by me
2009-07-12T23:31:00.000Z	swtaarrs	Flannel	alright, thanks
