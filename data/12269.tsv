2011-11-25T00:37:00.000Z	WinCamXP-Phone		I've had a problem with KDE on ubuntu 11.10. I installed it from the software center and it starts up fine, but after maybe a minute the images on the desktop start having trouble updating
2011-11-25T00:38:00.000Z	WinCamXP-Phone		anyone know what my problem is?
