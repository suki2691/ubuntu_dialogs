2008-09-04T11:58:00.000Z	mynameistux_		Hi, I did some repartioning with the gparted live cd, and now when I try and boot, it says L 99 99 99 and the screen fills up with 99's I am using LILO, because GRUB doesn't work for me. I assume that LILO is confused, because my partiton is in a different place. How do I fix it?
