2010-03-10T07:40:00.000Z	cboyer1951		I'm a newbie, i just installed utuntu using inetboot(something) sorry can't remember spelling, when I boot up and set a program (like Pidgin) then I shut down the computer, when I boot into ubuntu again, Pidgin is not there. So... does this me i've just got a virtual install, and need to install on my physical drive.. or that I need to do something?

2010-03-10T07:40:00.000Z	cboyer1951	blakkheim	ok, 'what' is a live system?
2010-03-10T07:40:00.000Z	blakkheim	cboyer1951	one that doesn't save changes..
