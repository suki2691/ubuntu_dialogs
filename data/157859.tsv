2009-01-25T09:36:00.000Z	Panxy		hello everyone. i have a question... i installed virtualbox and i'm trying to make raw vmdk, to boot my /dev/sda1 partition, which is running windows XP, but i keep getting: Error while creating the raw disk VMDK: VERR_ALREADY_EXISTS ... anyone saw such error yet and has an idea what's wrong ?
2009-01-25T09:36:00.000Z	Dante123	Panxy	have you tried the vbox forum.  A guy named erstazi is VERY knowledgable.
2009-01-25T09:38:00.000Z	Dante123	Panxy	 Erstazi is one of the most knowledgable in the channel.  Others are helpful too.  Sorry I cant help on that particular question.
