2008-08-17T04:20:00.000Z	l337ingDisorder		good afternoon wise ones, can anyone tell me a way to extend the default length of notification popups in the gnome desktop popup stack? It seems by default they expire after 5 seconds, but that's not nearly long enough. (I'm specifically trying to extend the expiry time for Evolution calendar notification popups)
