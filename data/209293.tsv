2006-10-20T05:21:00.000Z	LjL	soobnauce	you don't manually "download" packages. you just use the appropriate APT frontend to have them automatically fetched and installed.
2006-10-20T05:21:00.000Z	LjL	soobnauce	try typing "sudo apt-get install xmms"
2006-10-20T05:26:00.000Z	LjL	soobnauce	i had the bot send you another message that tells you what are, and how you can enable, other repositories. if you decide to enable all of them, you'll have around 20000 packages available through Synaptic or apt-get
