2011-02-21T04:36:00.000Z	comeback89		first time using ubuntu server, no gui. ive set up LAMP, but cant seem to connect remotly using SSH on a local network

2011-02-21T04:38:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	comeback89	Right - then it appears as though your ssh either isn't installed or setup; however, have you tried to just telnet into it? Did you install telnet?
