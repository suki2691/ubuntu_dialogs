2006-06-14T15:10:00.000Z	geeksauce		cause prices for those notebooks are really low comapared to their pc counterparts
2006-06-14T15:11:00.000Z	geeksauce		do you know if it can dual-boot ubuntu and mac osx?  or even tri-boot those and windows xp?
2006-06-14T15:12:00.000Z	Yoosah	geeksauce	afaik that should be possible
