2008-05-05T10:11:00.000Z	Braydon619		is there a way to have both rhytmbox and firefox play sounds without having to close rhytmbox?
2008-05-05T10:12:00.000Z	Braydon619		it says it's for firefox crashing?
2008-05-05T10:12:00.000Z	cwillu	Braydon619	there's a bug in the adobe's flashplayer that causes it to crash firefox if it uses mixing
2008-05-05T10:14:00.000Z	cwillu	Braydon619	you can install libflashsupport if you want, sound mixing will then work (after a firefox restart), but there's a good chance you'll experience crashes once in a while
