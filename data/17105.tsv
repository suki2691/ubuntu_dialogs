2011-03-08T14:42:00.000Z	Mosselmaniac		Our company needs a webserver, a LAMP-installation, for internal use, so within the network domain. We developed with an external company a web application, which is currently running on a development server on their side. Now we want to migrate the application internally. But first question is: What hardware do i need for such a thing? We have 25 employees, expecting a max of 10 users working with the application concurrently.
