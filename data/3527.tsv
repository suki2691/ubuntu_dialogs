2012-09-22T07:14:00.000Z	jagginess	hashem	you should be using the latest of things, X11 and kernel.. the X11 by default understands the 'intel' driver
2012-09-22T07:15:00.000Z	hashem	jagginess	I'm on 12.04, all up to date. It outputs to the TV, but it just cuts 20px from all the edges
2012-09-22T07:16:00.000Z	jagginess	hashem	that doesnt sound good.. is it just the font that appears too large or does it include desktop space?
