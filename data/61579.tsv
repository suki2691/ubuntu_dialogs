2010-02-14T08:07:00.000Z	Tommy89		Hi, can someone tell me, do you need samba running on a web server?
2010-02-14T08:09:00.000Z	here4thegear	Tommy89	you need Samba server running, it doesn't have to be on a server it just has to be a discoverable machine within your network
2010-02-14T08:10:00.000Z	here4thegear	Tommy89	is this a server at a work location?
2010-02-14T08:12:00.000Z	here4thegear	Tommy89	if you have other developers on that site, they may be using samba. it's a way of 'mounting' folders to windows (for network mapping)
