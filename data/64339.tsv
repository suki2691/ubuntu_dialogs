2011-09-08T16:54:00.000Z	sre		hi community friends. I have a problem that is probably my fault. I am to fast for my keyboard. when I type to fast the letters doesn't turn up on the screen. double letters like 'ee' or double backspace is the same. I can't remember doing any settings to get this delay. any suggestions on where to fix it. or get the default keyboard settings back ?
