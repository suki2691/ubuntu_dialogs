2009-09-22T20:05:00.000Z	occy1		is there an easy tool to allow me to recover files after I accidently formated a drive?  I know this sounds stupid...  said drive is on removeable media attached to my ubuntu laptop.
2009-09-22T20:06:00.000Z	occy1		is there something for Ubuntu though? that's open source?
