2008-12-03T00:28:00.000Z	Jophish		I'm sure it is possible to do, how can I make a "folder" that will just be a portal to another folder somewhere else. So if I save something in the link folder, it will appear in the real folder, and so if i change something in the real folder, it will be changed in the symbolic folder, Thanks
