2006-11-15T13:51:00.000Z	netnull		i dunno if it depends on compiz, but my distro get blocked quite often
2006-11-15T13:51:00.000Z	netnull		guys forgive me for my english :-)
2006-11-15T13:51:00.000Z	dcordes	netnull	i share your impressions about edgy! i tried it on my desktop and rolled back to dapper after i noticed there were strange changes like i couldn't run sh scripts and my ati driver could not be installed.
