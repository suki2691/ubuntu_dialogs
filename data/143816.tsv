2007-11-26T05:27:00.000Z	nfusco		Anyone had any joy installing NDiswrapper on a Broadcom 4306 (rev 2) chipset?  Its a dell truemobile 1300 card?
2007-11-26T05:28:00.000Z	nfusco		Ive done numerous HOWTOs and still cant get it running, Im running feisty, if that makes ny difference
2007-11-26T05:28:00.000Z	astro76	nfusco	shouldn't be necessary, open source driver is perfect on the 4306... did for me on feisty too
2007-11-26T05:31:00.000Z	nfusco	astro76	also mines the 4306 (rev 02)
