2007-01-21T15:02:00.000Z	ShadowX		just using general computing knowledge, Im assuming there is still no safe reliable way of converting one filesystem to another without totally reformatting, is there?
2007-01-21T15:03:00.000Z	Pobega	ShadowX	Not that I know of, but you could always back up the data on another partition, create a new partition, and move the files over.
2007-01-21T15:03:00.000Z	Pobega	ShadowX	Depends, what are you looking to do exactly?
2007-01-21T15:04:00.000Z	Pobega	ShadowX	Well yeah, I've never done it before but I'd think that you have to back everything up. How big is the drive and how much is in use?
