2007-05-01T12:20:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	grndslm	actually, it's not illegal to watch DVDs under linux, the problem is nobody has bothered to put out a licensed DVD decoder, as of yet
2007-05-01T12:21:00.000Z	grndslm	Geoffrey2	so i can watch DVDs legally, it's just not "supported" by anybody?
2007-05-01T12:37:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	grndslm	the problem is that the DVD encoding standard is closed source, proprietary, and patented/copyrighted...anyone wanting to make a DVD player/decoder needs to pay a licensing fee....about $10,000...a minor matter for the major software manufacturers...but for an operating system you get for free, who's going to pay the fee?
