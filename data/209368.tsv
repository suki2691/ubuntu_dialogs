2006-10-29T15:39:00.000Z	NoobUbuntu		Can someone please help. I tried to install nvidia driver according to ubuntu guide and after that x did not start. I typed in dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg it asked me many question and I enterd wrong values, i had no idea what to put. Now x started but wrong resoluiton and x is configured wrongly I think. Do i reinstall ubuntu ? I am a new user. Please help.
