2007-11-30T21:39:00.000Z	MasterShrek	ptn107	ive seen that error before, google it for a quick fix
2007-11-30T21:39:00.000Z	ptn107	MasterShrek	ive followed several tutorials on google each suggests to change something in /etc/hosts but no fixes are working for me
2007-11-30T21:45:00.000Z	ptn107	MasterShrek	oh i think i got it, i can't just add to the /etc/hosts file, i need to use ipv6 format or something
