2006-04-18T16:13:00.000Z	Drazool	mjau	are there linux drivers for that card, or are you using ndiswrapper?
2006-04-18T16:15:00.000Z	mjau		its a ive used ndiswrapper and the windows drivers for my card, it all works and it is activated. the problems begins when i try to connect using a wpa-psk key.
2006-04-18T16:18:00.000Z	mjau	Drazool	i've tried to follow the how-to's at ubuntu wiki but... it won't work when i try to use the wpa_supplicant.conf in terminal-mode... (i believe i've edited it correctly)
