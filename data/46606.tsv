2011-05-31T00:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	fbdystang	zfs cannot be included as a "native" filesystem for linux :(  It will only ever have userland support, due to some licensing issue - so I would recommend against zfs (although it's a truly amazing file system for BSDs)
2011-05-31T00:48:00.000Z	fbdystang	ZykoticK9	I understand the licensing issues but what does userland support mean?
2011-05-31T00:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	fbdystang	zfs can be used with fuse somehow
2011-05-31T00:52:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	fbdystang	zfs is supported on both solaris and the BSDs
