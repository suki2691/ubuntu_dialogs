2010-01-13T14:21:00.000Z	twright	Akkernight	that depends - ubuntu netbook remix has a different interface
2010-01-13T14:22:00.000Z	twright	Akkernight	yes although you might have issues with opengl
2010-01-13T14:23:00.000Z	twright	Akkernight	there are some serious bugs with graphics, 64bit and Wine (although they might have been fixed since I used it)
