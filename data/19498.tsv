2011-01-31T02:30:00.000Z	hardbop200		hey all! my wife has agreed to let me replace xp on her netbook w/ ubuntu (yay!), but she has an iphone and uses itunes. am I screwed, or is there a solution out there for this?
2011-01-31T02:31:00.000Z	hardbop200		is it just as simple as installing itunes via wine?
2011-01-31T02:31:00.000Z	kstar66	hardbop200	: Yes
2011-01-31T02:31:00.000Z	hardbop200	kstar66	thanks. I just don't want her to loose all of her music b/c of me ;)
