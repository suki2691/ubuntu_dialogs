2012-11-06T05:30:00.000Z	theBIGelectron		Hi there all I was just wondering if to change from Ubuntu 12.10 beater to 12.10 release is there anything that one must do to change the repo's or does it happen automagicly?
2012-11-06T05:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	theBIGelectron	just upgrade and you will have the RC
2012-11-06T05:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	theBIGelectron	they both use the same repos
2012-11-06T05:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	theBIGelectron	no harm done :)
