2009-11-13T11:26:00.000Z	jauntyjoe		i.e. already compressed (with flac) and has a cue file to boot - to enable decompression
2009-11-13T11:27:00.000Z	mneptok	jauntyjoe	can you mount the actual image file?
2009-11-13T11:28:00.000Z	jauntyjoe	mneptok	no can't mount a flac image file - it's quite different to the usual iso/bin and the rest
