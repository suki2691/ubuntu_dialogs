2004-11-19T17:41:00.000Z	hypa7ia	chuck__	are you in gnome?
2004-11-19T17:42:00.000Z	hypa7ia	chuck__	nautilus is what you use to access your files.  so go to the computer menu at the top anc click "home"
2004-11-19T17:44:00.000Z	hypa7ia	chuck__	nope, nothing like that.  insert a blankcd and a window pops up.... right-click on an iso and "burn to cd"
