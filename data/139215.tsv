2007-11-25T20:54:00.000Z	MolePrince		Howdy, I've got a really old pii300 128m ram laptop that I use mostly as a typewriter and network security tool.  Would ubuntu-server be a good choice for that please?

2007-11-25T21:00:00.000Z	MolePrince	Jack_Sparrow	 It's my personal laptop, not an actual server, more a terminal for them.  But I don't use X or any desktop environment or anything, so I was wondering if ubuntu-server would eb good for that.
