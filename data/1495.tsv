The laptop model is Fujitsu Lifebook AH532.....anybody have any experience on howto install ubuntu on such a system

2012-08-21T00:12:00.000Z	nathanael	viillinny	uefi is relatively new so it's a slightly different problem... does wireless etc work well on the lifebooks you have though?
2012-08-21T00:14:00.000Z	viillinny	nathanael	, no problems :)
