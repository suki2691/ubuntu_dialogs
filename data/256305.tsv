2012-01-29T12:49:00.000Z	Silpelit		Noob question, but I just downloaded a driver from https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/i686/xf86-input-synaptics/
2012-01-29T12:49:00.000Z	Silpelit		It's downloaded, I'm looking at the file, how do I get synaptic package manager to open it?

2012-01-29T12:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	Silpelit	 if the driver is in the repos.. use the package manager tool to search for and install it.
