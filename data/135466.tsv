2007-05-08T05:32:00.000Z	bulle	troughton	depends a bit on what you mean with side by side
2007-05-08T05:32:00.000Z	bulle	troughton	you can always run two x servers, and run kde on one and gnome on the other
2007-05-08T05:32:00.000Z	bulle	troughton	sure, just install both kde and gnome, and then choose either kde or gnome session, at login time
