2008-12-04T10:20:00.000Z	izinucs	mabus	partimage has worked well for me.. it's a live cd partition imaging program
2008-12-04T10:20:00.000Z	mabus	izinucs	is there not a way I can do it with just 'cp' and some arguments?
2008-12-04T10:20:00.000Z	izinucs	mabus	part of the rescuecd.. it's google-able... cp will work if it's simple data with no hidden directories..
