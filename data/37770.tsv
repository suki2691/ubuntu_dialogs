2010-03-23T04:48:00.000Z	Roasted		Has anybody had any weirdness with Network Manager? I was at work earlier sitting RIGHT next to an access point with 100% signal, and I dropped connection. I dropped connection two or three more times that morning. I come home, power on laptop, and haven't lost a connection in 5 hours that I been on it.. Wow???

2010-03-23T04:50:00.000Z	Roasted	NetScr1be	No... I set up the wifi network at work. It's the only network there, and all of the APs are on different channels. There shouldn't have been any confusion.
