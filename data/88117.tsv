2008-06-25T08:06:00.000Z	ionstorm		My friend tried to install Ubuntu on a AMD Athlon 3000  A PATA hard drive, 160GB. and it hung at the formatting phase of the install, he used the 32 bit livecd, did he use the wrong one?
2008-06-25T08:06:00.000Z	philh	ionstorm	did it fail on multiple attempts?
2008-06-25T08:07:00.000Z	ionstorm	philh	yes
2008-06-25T08:08:00.000Z	philh	ionstorm	in theory the 32bit livecd should be absolutely fine on such a machine, it is worth giving the alt CD a got instead though
