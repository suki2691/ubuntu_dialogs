2008-12-27T05:20:00.000Z	levidos		some of my programs (miro, firefox, qbittorrent) randomly quit, disappear, whithout any error message. what logs should i check to diagnose my problem?
2008-12-27T05:20:00.000Z	cn28h	levidos	try starting them from a terminal and see if they print any output
2008-12-27T05:24:00.000Z	levidos	cn28h	i get this error when starting miro... it quits after 2 - 3 seconds. all these programs that "quit" use a lot of connections. can you take a look at the log, please? http://paste.ubuntu.com/93474/
2008-12-27T05:27:00.000Z	cn28h	levidos	sounds like it's saying something is too slow (maybe your connection? or video display?)
