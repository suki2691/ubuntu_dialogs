2007-02-23T14:16:00.000Z	bestadvocate		Could someone point me in the right dirrection on how to get a better keybord driver? I'm trying to learn emacs and one of my Alt Keys isnt working.
2007-02-23T14:18:00.000Z	grndslm	bestadvocate	 i'm with you, i'd really like my right alt key to work like my left one!
2007-02-23T14:20:00.000Z	bestadvocate	grndslm	unfortunately I have no idea where to start with driver replacements.
