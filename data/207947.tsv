When I click my applications and see the installed program "Wine" to the right of it there is still a windows program which I already erased, sort of uninstalled programs in the start menu of windows that are still there even though you uninstalled them before. How do I get rid of it?

2007-03-08T08:07:00.000Z	techie_		<__david> it is interesting that now the Applications do not show the word Wine! I assume this is correct since I do not have any programs installed in Wines. I imagine if i were to setup another windows program, then the word "Wine" in applications would appear again. Does that make sense to you?
