2009-07-27T20:23:00.000Z	ShortWave		I'm trying to do an install, and I'm getting a failure on libxapian
2009-07-27T20:24:00.000Z	ShortWave		I find it hard to believe that someone smart enough to get into IRC, and EVIDENTLY knowledgable to know about rtlinux, has to be in here, ASKING if any of us knows of an rtlinux channel. I find that confusing.
