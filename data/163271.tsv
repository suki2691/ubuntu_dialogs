2010-10-28T02:50:00.000Z	mvblair		I'm using Windows right now at the library, 'cause I can't get Ubuntu to load at home! :-) Any suggestions for getting into the GRUB menu when ESC or ESC+SHIFT doesn't work?
2010-10-28T02:51:00.000Z	mvblair		Do I just do CTRL or CTRL+ESC?
2010-10-28T02:52:00.000Z	mvblair		Thanks, Elisboa. I'm pulling my laptop out right now to try it. Praxi, I'm not sure what !grub2 means. I'm a dope.
2010-10-28T02:52:00.000Z	Praxi	mvblair	just type !grub2
