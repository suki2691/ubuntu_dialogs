2009-06-23T00:22:00.000Z	jon678	FFMike	easy more than you need
2009-06-23T00:23:00.000Z	jon678	FFMike	fits fine in 4gb for me, but i store my data on a different partition
2009-06-23T00:24:00.000Z	jon678	FFMike	sure, ubuntu can read and write to it just fine. windows wont know what your ubuntu partition is, and will be eager to reformat it if you let it
