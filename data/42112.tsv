2010-05-02T11:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	zerq	w32codecs is for 32bit systems, and w64codecs is for 64bit systems - they should be the same content
2010-05-02T11:28:00.000Z	zerq	ZykoticK9	ok, thanks.  Not sure why nothing seems to play, these aren't obscure codecs or anything
2010-05-02T11:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	zerq	what media player are you using?  try installing mplayer and see if it will play anything (or vlc if you wish)
