2007-07-04T13:08:00.000Z	Flannel	barnydan_	yes, that's the point.  If you fire up synaptic, it should be listed there.  Or you can use dpkg
2007-07-04T14:14:00.000Z	Flannel	barnydan_	no.  Gutsy is alpha software, you don't want to.  You should use prevu to backport whatever you need.  Er, what is it that you're looking for?
2007-07-04T14:17:00.000Z	Flannel	barnydan_	ah.  Uh, is liboil a normal dependency for anything? (does the normal system require it?)
