2012-07-14T19:20:00.000Z	jyg		I was running 64-bit 11.10 amd switched to 32-bt.  About a month after the switch, when I would log in, the wireless would not connect.  So after trying a bunch of thinks, I thought I'd just jiggle the LKM, so I'd 'sudo rmmod iwlagn; sleep 3; sudo modprobe iwlagn'.  This fixed the problem every time.  Any idea how I might have to keep from doing this?
2012-07-14T19:21:00.000Z	jyg		er, like how to fix it permenantly?
2012-07-14T19:22:00.000Z	jyg		that makes no sense
