2009-09-29T21:36:00.000Z	solifugus		I have noticed, to devistating affect, that when I copy text off a browser page and then close the browser window... my copy buffer appears to loose what I copied... wtf is going on?  (this didn't happen with kde, but I am using gnome now since kde 4 is to messed up)
2009-09-29T21:37:00.000Z	solifugus		Is there any way to recover my copy buffer, after closing firefox seems to have eliminated it (in gnome)?
2009-09-29T21:37:00.000Z	swiftarrow	solifugus	that's one thing about gnome that keeps surprising me.
2009-09-29T21:37:00.000Z	solifugus	swiftarrow	 any way to recover it?  I mean, this couldn't be behavior by design...
