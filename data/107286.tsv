2008-06-17T02:57:00.000Z	TheOther_		Hi, how do I get LUKS with cryptsetup to read a keyfile on boot?  I've seen use of a boot parameter which can specify the path from a specific device and even sector, but it doesn't do anything
2008-06-17T02:58:00.000Z	TheOther_		anybody have any experience w/ cryptsetup luks??
2008-06-17T03:00:00.000Z	TheOther_		where can I find a more specific room on security?
