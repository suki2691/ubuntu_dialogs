2007-06-27T08:43:00.000Z	dan1		hello everyone, i'm measuring performance of usb flash drive. benchmark prog (iozone) reports read speeds of, as an example, 1261238 kbytes/sec
2007-06-27T08:44:00.000Z	dan1		this is clearly way too high, i have turned off caching, but these results cannot be right. can anyone help explain/suggest why
