2010-03-21T00:25:00.000Z	Pantcho		I really need a quick help on understanding this, i compiled the kernel once and now i wish to recompile with a small change to the kernel source, what should i do?
2010-03-21T00:25:00.000Z	xiven	Pantcho	did you install it or just build it?
2010-03-21T00:26:00.000Z	Pantcho	xiven	i first build it to see if can build the kernel and it worked and i even booted from it, now i am back to the original kernel, deleted the one i build and now i wish to build a new one with a small source code change...
2010-03-21T00:29:00.000Z	Pantcho	xiven	but the first build makes .o files, now if i change the .c file will it compile a NEW .o file that will replace the original on the second build?
