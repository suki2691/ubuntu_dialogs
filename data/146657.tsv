2007-02-06T11:05:00.000Z	kiratik		Is there any way of checking the integrity of the disk without unmounting it - i need to keep this server up but i suspect the file_system may be going bad - i just need to diagnose - if its bad i'll be able to take it offline and treat it - but is there any way to tell without takign everything offline ?

2007-02-06T11:06:00.000Z	Quintin	kiratik	No, they are not.
