2007-01-17T06:26:00.000Z	Prometheum		Hello, I appear to have killed my taskbar. I can only view launchers and applets, and non of my other programs can use the taskbar. I accidentaly removed the barrier between the left side with the menus on it and the right side with the time and whatnot. How would I be able to fix it?
