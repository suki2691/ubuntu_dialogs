2009-04-06T04:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Tr0pW3N	32 or 64 bits?
2009-04-06T04:48:00.000Z	Flannel	Tr0pW3N	32bit OSes can address up to 4GB of memory at a time.  You'll get around 3.2GB of usable RAM for normal circumstances.  If you really, really want more, and can't move to 64bit, you can use PAE, which does a paging type thing to give you more than that total (but still only that much at a time)
