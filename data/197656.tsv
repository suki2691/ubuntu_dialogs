2006-02-27T09:57:00.000Z	kc1933		Question: I running Ubuntu 5.10, along with VMWare Player running Windows XP Home. Printing is giving me trouble. Priting works fine in Ubuntu, but once I load VMWare Player, Ubuntu won't print. Windows XP Prints fine, but not Ubuntu. Even if I click the button in VMWare Player to disconnect the printer fro Windows XP, Ubuntu still won't print. Any ideas?

2006-02-27T09:59:00.000Z	kc1933	redguy|work	seems like it. But I'm not sure where to debug
2006-02-27T09:59:00.000Z	redguy|work	kc1933	try asking VMWare people..., or wait here until somebody more silled answers your question
