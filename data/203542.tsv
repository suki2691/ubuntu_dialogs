2005-12-22T15:05:00.000Z	zardoz		renato: sorry, I am a newbie, but isn't Ubuntu Breezy utf-8 by default? And why does convmv not change my  and  characters to the same characters?
2005-12-22T15:05:00.000Z	LjL	zardoz	yes, ubuntu comes with utf-8 set by default
2005-12-22T15:08:00.000Z	zardoz	LjL	have I understood this correctly: when moving my files from my vfat-partition to my Ubuntu partition, they automatically become utf-8??
2005-12-22T15:09:00.000Z	LjL	zardoz	i am not sure if that happens
