2009-03-16T00:30:00.000Z	jphenow		can anyone help me? I uninstalled my ubuntu x86 8.10 so I could use Kubuntu 64bit 8.10 and now the X won't even open up for an installation much less actually using it

2009-03-16T00:32:00.000Z	gartral	jphenow	what graphics card do you have, i doubt its the issue, but it might be cause you dont have the restricted drivers (ATI/Nvidia)
2009-03-16T00:35:00.000Z	gartral	jphenow	try getting the restricted drivers, but i don't know the package name
