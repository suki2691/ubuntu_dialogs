2010-07-08T23:48:00.000Z	e-head		I'm curious if anyone has Ubuntu running on an external USB drive?
2010-07-08T23:48:00.000Z	jngdwe	e-head	ive run ubuntu on an external USB before.

2010-07-08T23:48:00.000Z	e-head	jngdwe	do you have to do anything special during the install? Or post install?  Like modify the initrd or anything?
