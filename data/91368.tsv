2009-05-25T01:11:00.000Z	LjL	Wraithan	i'm sorry if there is no support channel for the product, but you really can't expect it to be supported here, either - your problem may have to do with the "ubuntu side of things" but there's little way people here could know. it's the same reason why derivatives like Mint are not supported.

2009-05-25T01:18:00.000Z	LjL	Wraithan	this channel is not "any OS you download stuff from the ubuntu repositories on".
