2007-08-25T14:17:00.000Z	halfbloodprince		Hey people.. i just burned the ubuntu ISO image to CD using K3B.. the image seems to have burned properly, but it's not booting from the CD. My bios is set to boot from CD though.. any ideas?
2007-08-25T14:19:00.000Z	halfbloodprince		i thought k3b would burn it as a bootable CD?

2007-08-25T14:21:00.000Z	halfbloodprince	Rat409	yes, the md5sum was proper
