2009-11-27T21:48:00.000Z	lucka_		I've installed wicd and now my default network manager is gone... how can I get it back. What's the package name of the network manager?
2009-11-27T21:48:00.000Z	nytek_	lucka_	gnome-network-manager?
2009-11-27T22:02:00.000Z	lucka_	nytek_	gnome-network-manager isn't the name :S for default gnome manager
2009-11-27T22:04:00.000Z	nytek_	lucka_	network-manager-gnome , try that :(
