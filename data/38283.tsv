2010-01-27T04:28:00.000Z	methano1		Hello I just installed Ubuntu 9.10 and whenever I boot it will begin loading then go to a black screen and sit or it will begin loading and then drop me to the login prompt and suddenly go to a black screen before I can type in anything.  The only way I can get into ubuntu is boot into recovery mode and then choose resume and let it boot.  Anyone know why it would do this and how to fix it?
