2007-10-10T08:02:00.000Z	Pici	XTaran	apport automagically reports bugs when things crash, and points you at launchpad.net
2007-10-10T08:02:00.000Z	XTaran		which launchpad doesn't output anything
2007-10-10T08:03:00.000Z	XTaran	Pici	Ok, "apport" looks like a point to start searching for more infos. Thx.
