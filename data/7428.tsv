2011-11-28T10:46:00.000Z	XaeroX252		Okay, I'm hoping to turn some heads here, but I'm working on getting Netflix support working on Ubuntu. I've made progress (I've managed to get a loading bar on the Instant watch screen, but it errors out) Enabling logging through chromium, I see this error directly related, and am asking here for ideas on how to correct it:
2011-11-28T10:48:00.000Z	XaeroX252		pepper_plugin_registry.cc(135) Unable to load plugin /opt/google/chrome/pepper/netflixplugin.so libssl.so.0.9.8: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2011-11-28T10:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	XaeroX252	 native netflix support is comming sometime  'soon' i hear.
2011-11-28T10:50:00.000Z	XaeroX252	dr_willis	true, would help if I just used autolinking for nicks.
