2011-07-23T10:26:00.000Z	aureianimus	xgt001	i don't think so, but i don't know where to check that. Also, i'm running bumblebee, which i think updated the nvidia driver, so big chance that's it
2011-07-23T10:27:00.000Z	xgt001	aureianimus	yes most likely, so u have to reinstall the nvidia driver
2011-07-23T10:27:00.000Z	xgt001	aureianimus	most likely the video driver has failed to build against the newer kernel
