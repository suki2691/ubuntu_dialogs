2007-02-15T12:01:00.000Z	KarlosII		hello, I've installeed gallery 2 nad goto http://localhost/gallery2/ but file is not found, anyone know why? It has not worked since upgrading from ubuntu 6.06, I have apache2 installed and mysql installed, and the ubuntu pkg supposedly presets it up? Any idea why where to start to find the issue?
