2006-04-19T10:57:00.000Z	TheMonoTone		I'm looking for a library, libavcodec, how would I find the package that provides it?
2006-04-19T10:57:00.000Z	TheMonoTone		there is no libavcodec, only libavcodec-dev...
2006-04-19T10:58:00.000Z	jetscreamer	TheMonoTone	it's probably in that non-free repo
2006-04-19T11:03:00.000Z	jetscreamer	TheMonoTone	you may or may not need some other codecs
