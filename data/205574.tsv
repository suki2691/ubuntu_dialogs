2005-12-04T08:05:00.000Z	cddesjar	AndiM	why are you switching from debian?
2005-12-04T08:05:00.000Z	AndiM	cddesjar	because I *think* Ubuntu has more user-friendly config, but then I'm not sure ;) (my wife is a bit Linux-phobic, ya know, and Debian didn't quite cut it...)
2005-12-04T08:08:00.000Z	AndiM	cddesjar	alienating .rpms went fine, AFAICT.
