2006-03-26T17:51:00.000Z	ana		No matter what I do I can't seem to change the root passwd or enable root login from the login screen. Please help.
2006-03-26T17:51:00.000Z	lullabud	ana	do you really need root login from the login screen?
2006-03-26T17:51:00.000Z	ana	lullabud	if possible, yes
2006-03-26T17:52:00.000Z	lullabud	ana	i find that hard to believe.
