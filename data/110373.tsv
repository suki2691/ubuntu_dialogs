2008-12-23T17:38:00.000Z	spdz2		My Windows machine has completely died.  I have booted into Ubuntu from the CD.  Bizarrely I cannot eject the CD.  Is there a reason for this?
2008-12-23T17:38:00.000Z	spdz2		It is also unable to mount volume?
2008-12-23T17:39:00.000Z	DRebellion	spdz2	perhaps a hard drive failure?
2008-12-23T17:41:00.000Z	DRebellion	spdz2	ubuntu doesn't provide the option to load to ram by default. The only livecd i can remember off the top of my head would be backtrack that does this, but I don't really use many livecds ; )
