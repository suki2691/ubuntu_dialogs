2007-06-23T08:44:00.000Z	matthew1429		I'm connecting my windows computer to an ubuntu server for vnc (i typed vncserver in console)... why do clients not ask for user name and just password?
2007-06-23T08:45:00.000Z	matthew1429		does anyone use vnc regularly?
2007-06-23T08:45:00.000Z	Pici	matthew1429	I do.
