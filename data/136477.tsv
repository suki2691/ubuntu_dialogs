2007-04-30T06:47:00.000Z	Gohalien		I have a TP-Link W551G (Atheros chipset). It detects it fine, but signal is very low 20/94, in windows works just fine with good signal, so I wanted to use the windows xp drivers, I managed to install ndiswrapper, and I managed to install the driver, but, how I tell ubuntu to use that driver ? Thanks for your time !
