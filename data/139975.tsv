2007-04-14T13:50:00.000Z	CheesyJedi		over the course of being an ubuntu n00b, I blindly installed many things which I then discarded and maybe uninstalled, but in the process left lot's of crap like unused libraries and dependent stuff. I wanted to know if there was a way to see stuff that is installed but not doing anything (nothing's depending on it) so that I could go through and delete them to speed up my computer
