2012-09-29T11:18:00.000Z	nomike		I have a tar file containing a directory "foo" with files "blah" and "blubb". I now want to extract all contents of "foo" directly to the current directory without "foo" being created.
2012-09-29T11:18:00.000Z	nomike		Anyone knows how this could be done?
2012-09-29T11:20:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	nomike	So you just want to extract the tar to a directory right?
