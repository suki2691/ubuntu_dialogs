2009-11-14T01:31:00.000Z	nostalgicBadger		Hey guys, I'm running Ubuntu on a netbook. I kind of want a less bloated distro, but my USB only boots from certain drives, and I don't own one. Does anyone know of a good tutorial for stripping down Ubuntu?
2009-11-14T01:31:00.000Z	MoTec	nostalgicBadger	are you using Ubuntu Netbook Remix?  Runs great on my Mini-9
2009-11-14T01:32:00.000Z	nostalgicBadger	MoTec	- yeah, I am. It runs fine, but it does a lot more than I need it to do.
