2008-10-24T09:55:00.000Z	kastner		I need to install apache 2.2.10 for PCI compliance, is compiling from source my only option?
2008-10-24T09:57:00.000Z	kastner		and if I do compile apache 2.2.10, how do I make it as ubuntu-like as possible?

2008-10-24T09:58:00.000Z	kastner	Flannel	this PCI compliance thing is _insane_, I have to use 2.2.10 :(
