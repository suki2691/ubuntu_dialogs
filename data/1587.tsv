2012-08-13T17:31:00.000Z	L3top	sanrabbit	typically it means a package had a name for a long time, and people are used to looking for it by that name, though there is a new package under a new name, so a dummy transitional package is there.
2012-08-13T17:38:00.000Z	sanrabbit	L3top	thanks, but is it just a 'link'? once I installed ruby1.8, but the 'ruby' package is still purge, then I exec 'aptitude install ruby', apt downloads a package named 'ruby' and install it.
