2008-04-15T20:14:00.000Z	MrBill		This might be a bit out of place, but perhaps someone can point me in the right direction anyways. I'm wondering if anyone knows of a good software package for turning some xvid and divx files into DVD that will play in a regular DVD player.
2008-04-15T20:14:00.000Z	MrBill		I had some programs in WinXP that woudl take care of this, but I don't know how to tackle this from Ubuntu
2008-04-15T20:15:00.000Z	genii	MrBill	I also recommend devede, you can import almost any format and create a dvd which plays in regular standalone
2008-04-25T21:34:00.000Z	genii	MrBill	add bash to the first part then save the line into the file /etc/init.d/rc.local
