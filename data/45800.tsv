2010-05-08T19:52:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer		I'm trying to use wine to run an installer off a cd. However, it's complaining about the executable bit not being set. How can I do that for a read only cd?

2010-05-08T19:53:00.000Z	Paddy_NI	SoftwareExplorer	or create and iso image and mount that
2010-05-08T19:53:00.000Z	SoftwareExplorer	Paddy_NI	Ok, I'll try that. It seems a little convoluted though...
