2005-04-13T05:26:00.000Z	stang		Hey everybody!  I was installing ubuntu for a friend yesterday and we got it all installed and rebooted his machine and was prompted for host name- but the keyboard wouldn't work anymore!
2005-04-13T05:26:00.000Z	stang		Tried several different ideas, but never got it working
2005-04-13T05:26:00.000Z	stang		anyone have a suggestion?
2005-04-13T05:27:00.000Z	saik0	stang	is it a USB keyboard?
