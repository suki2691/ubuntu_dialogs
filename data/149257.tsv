2010-05-18T04:05:00.000Z	upgrdman		i have a text file that i want to have every "PD;" replaced with a "," ... no quotation marks of course. this seems like something a one line script could do but i am clueless. anyone wanna help? :)

2010-05-18T04:09:00.000Z	Pici	upgrdman	throw -i on there if the results look good to save the output to the same file.
