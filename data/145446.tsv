2007-02-19T12:12:00.000Z	siegfried__	rmd_	 I'm trying to following the directions at http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/10/13/enabling-cupsys-web-admin-interface/. It says to add a user cupsys. There is already such a user and I tried to change the password on it. When I go back to http://localhost:631 it does not accept this username/password.
