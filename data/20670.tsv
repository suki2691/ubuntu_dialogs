2011-01-14T15:57:00.000Z	HugoGF	kwtm	Yes, sound still comes out of the speaker when I plug in headphones. I don't think that it's a hardware problem because it works in Windows. Yes, I have a dual boot installation.
2011-01-14T15:58:00.000Z	kwtm	HugoGF	Interesting.  So it is under software control. Do you think it's a driver problem for the sound card?  (ie. your sound card needs a special driver found only under Windows?)
2011-01-14T15:59:00.000Z	HugoGF	kwtm	Yeah, I think I need a special driver.
