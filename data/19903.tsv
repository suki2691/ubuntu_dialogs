2011-11-05T05:19:00.000Z	Ruzu		where in the filesystem does apt-get put things when you use install?
2011-11-05T05:20:00.000Z	pnorman	Ruzu	I had weird problems on my install until I made a gparted boot drive and wiped out all my raid volumes
2011-11-06T08:40:00.000Z	pnorman	Ruzu	You want to look at logs for what happened before you hard-restarted it. try in /var/log
