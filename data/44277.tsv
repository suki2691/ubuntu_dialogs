2009-11-24T02:38:00.000Z	Shwack	Tartaros	does that mean I have to use wine if the only file offered is .exe?
2009-11-24T02:41:00.000Z	Tartaros	Shwack	that, or you could compile it yourself if you can get hold of the sources (which you should be able to since it's sourceforge project)
2009-11-24T02:42:00.000Z	Shwack	Tartaros	I would love to compile it myself - I'm going to read up on compiling and look for the source files.  Thank you
