But on that note - does anyone know of ANY linux distribution, livecd or otherwise that is specifically aimed at web development? I've been searching distrowatch for an hour and the best I can find is the rails livecd, and their website doesn't even work

2007-12-13T02:01:00.000Z	debaser	logankoester	I agree it would be awesome to have a "livecd" builder to select packages or set of them, so that you can download something only with what you want
