2006-04-18T11:16:00.000Z	ryness	tonyyarusso	thank you... i'll checkout nvu... are there any other possible programs?
2006-04-18T11:17:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ryness	Yeah, offhand I'm thinking screem and something, but I'm not sure what.  If you don't need the GUI goodness and just want a powerful editor, even Dapper's gedit is getting up there.
