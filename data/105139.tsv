2010-04-24T02:58:00.000Z	pzn		I'm using ubuntu 9.10 alternate CD. I opted for encrypted root filesystem. now it is asking me about "encrypted private home". I think I should answer "no", because I'm the only user of this notebook and root is already encrypted. is my way of thinking ok?

2010-04-24T03:00:00.000Z	pzn	ActionParsnip	answering "yes" will only make things slower...crypt-over-crypt, ok?
2010-04-24T03:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	pzn	your call dude, ive not used encryptfs
