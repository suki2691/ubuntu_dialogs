2006-07-26T05:00:00.000Z	davey_	Dimensions	Fat32 can be read by linux ntfs works better in linux
2006-07-26T05:06:00.000Z	davey_	Dimensions	Fat32 is probibly good enough and it's the most veristal, not the best but the most compadible with everything so if I was you I would guess fat 32 if you don't need any files over 4 gigs
