2012-01-23T07:14:00.000Z	zacarias		I tried making backups with BackInTime. It looks nice. It has scheduled backups, but apparently I have to launch it in order to have the scheduled backups done. Am I wrong? Is there a backup app that can run the backups in the background without my help and without me having to think about it and launching it?

2012-01-23T07:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zacarias	not sure, I just have a cron'd job which copies the stuff I care about in $HOME to a firewire drive
