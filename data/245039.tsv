2010-08-26T19:03:00.000Z	mandravel		Is there a way to automatically install all updates without requiring user input?
2010-08-26T19:04:00.000Z	gasull	mandravel	some updates require user input
2010-08-26T19:07:00.000Z	gasull	mandravel	try apticron as other suggests.  I tried this other thing time ago and didn't work: http://kevin.vanzonneveld.net/techblog/article/schedule_automatic_updates_on_ubuntu/  I'll try apticron myself now.
