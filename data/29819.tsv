2011-01-05T22:10:00.000Z	SwedeMike	delinquentme	it's not the number of open ports, it's the number of different applications listening to them. One application with 64000 ports open is less of a problem than 1000 applications with a single port each

2011-01-05T22:11:00.000Z	delinquentme	SwedeMike	ok thanks .. so ive got a mini issue on my hands
