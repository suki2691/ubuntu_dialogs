2005-04-18T07:53:00.000Z	SirGrok		I have a problem: I was upgrading to 5.04 via apt-get dist-upgrade and my system crashed. Now I try to boot up and I can't start X11... I can get into the recovery mode (and I finieshed up apt-get dist-upgrade) but it still isn't booting... Any ideas.
2005-04-18T07:54:00.000Z	SirGrok		Yes I do.
2005-04-18T07:54:00.000Z	Fackamato	SirGrok	Check the X log.
2005-04-18T07:55:00.000Z	SirGrok	Fackamato	I am somewhat of a linux n00b.... I have only been on it for about 6 months. Is it /etc/X11/ somewhere?
