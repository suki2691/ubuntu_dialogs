2007-11-17T00:41:00.000Z	kasansweat		I've got a burner "pretending" to burn cds, that is, i burn the iso, it goes through the motions, but when the disc is reinserted, it acts as if it is blank. Physical inspection of the CD makes me think it is still blank. Any help?

2007-11-17T00:51:00.000Z	BlueDevil	kasansweat	did you insert the disc upside down? :))
2007-11-17T00:51:00.000Z	kasansweat	BlueDevil	Ha no-- not only that, I've tried multiple disks. This is so bizarre. I've burned successfully with it before.
