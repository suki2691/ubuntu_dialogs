2009-01-30T13:57:00.000Z	step21	_2	testdisk might work ... wasn't aware that there was anything stable for linux/ext2
2009-01-30T13:58:00.000Z	_2	step21	it really depends only on what exactly was happening on the disk when the power failed.   chances are it will work.  but there are things that could have been happening that will destroy the data  so....
