2008-04-05T15:35:00.000Z	lesshaste		how do I see the contents of a package I install via apt-get in general? I.e. which files were in it
2008-04-05T15:35:00.000Z	lesshaste		I feel dpkg should be able to do it somehow
2008-04-05T15:36:00.000Z	artenius	lesshaste	I think dpkg -l packagename
2008-04-05T15:36:00.000Z	lesshaste	artenius	that doesn't list the files
