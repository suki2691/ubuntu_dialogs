2006-06-06T08:48:00.000Z	m6s		Hello
2006-06-06T08:49:00.000Z	m6s		I saw that 6.06 is out, can I do an upgrade without downloading the ISO?
2006-06-06T08:49:00.000Z	m6s		apt-get dist-upgrade would do the job? What steps should I take?
2006-06-06T08:49:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA	m6s	don't forget the "sudo" ;)
