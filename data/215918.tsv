2008-09-14T03:21:00.000Z	Dante123		hi all, wanting to go from my pc that has radeon 9250 (although lspci says 9200 pro) with s-video out into a tv with s-video input.  When I try this, I do see text on the tv screen when first booting (very jumpy however) but when system loads the screen goes black.  My cable is 4 pin (although I notice that from the graphics card there are seven holes for 7 pin cable)....any ideas?
2008-09-14T03:22:00.000Z	Dante123		Was told not to go higher than 800 x 600....and keep refresh rate at 60 hz which is tv standard.....still no go?  Any ideas?
2008-09-14T03:22:00.000Z	Dante123		is there something in ubuntu for tv out or using tv as second monitor????
