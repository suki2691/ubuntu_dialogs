2009-03-03T20:33:00.000Z	ravster		My gnome panel just disappeared, and I was hoping someone might be able to help me get it back.
2009-03-03T20:33:00.000Z	Flimm	ravster	log out and log in
2009-03-03T20:33:00.000Z	ravster	Flimm	tried that. I had to do a ctrl-alt-backspace to get out, but it still didn't fix the problem.
