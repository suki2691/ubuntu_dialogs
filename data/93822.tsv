2008-05-31T09:14:00.000Z	Flannel	rich_freecomm	dump and restore for what?
2008-05-31T09:15:00.000Z	rich_freecomm	Flannel	wasn't aware dump and restore had any other purposes than to backup partitions...ok..I'll re-read
2008-05-31T09:16:00.000Z	Flannel	rich_freecomm	Well, dump and restore might've been arguments to some other program, they're not really specific to a particular domain (although those programs are)
