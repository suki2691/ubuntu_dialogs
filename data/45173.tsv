2010-08-15T00:30:00.000Z	AzizLight	thune3	I tried that..the -a option is to display hidden files not folders
2010-08-15T00:37:00.000Z	thune3	AzizLight	tree -a displays hidden folders for me as well. Are you asking for "hidden folders only" option?
2010-08-15T00:39:00.000Z	AzizLight	thune3	tree -a displays hidden files/folders but only .git/ which is weird...
