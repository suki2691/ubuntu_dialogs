2006-08-27T14:58:00.000Z	krikke		i would like to resize a fat 32 in order to create open disk space, should i defragment the partition?
2006-08-27T14:58:00.000Z	krikke		should i defragment other partitions too?
2006-08-27T14:59:00.000Z	eyequeue	krikke	only if the fs becomes fragmented, not an issue with ext3 etc
