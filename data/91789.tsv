2009-05-12T03:18:00.000Z	`brandon`		How do i find where a serton file is?
2009-05-12T03:18:00.000Z	`brandon`		like a IRCd
2009-05-12T03:18:00.000Z	joaopinto	`brandon`	what are you trying to achieve ? an ircd is not something easy to setup
2009-05-12T03:23:00.000Z	joaopinto	`brandon`	sudo apt-get purge ircd-hybrid, if you want to do a clean removal
