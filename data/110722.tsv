2008-03-15T17:11:00.000Z	LimCore		what is nowdays better, nvidia ~7500 or radeon ~x1650pro or ~hd2600pro ? I need good quality, excelent stability and good 3d games performance. If it can be done on open driver then the better

2008-03-15T17:13:00.000Z	LimCore	lesshaste	so which closed driver is better? for nvidia or radeon?
2008-03-15T17:13:00.000Z	lesshaste	LimCore	I am probably not the best person to judge.. but someone here will have an opinion :)
