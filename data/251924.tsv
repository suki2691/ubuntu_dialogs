2007-07-03T12:29:00.000Z	crolle17		i have question concerning vi. i edited a file with gedit. opening that file with vi again there is a '^M' at the end of every line. i wanted to delete them by regexp with :%s/^M/. but regexp returns that this pattern is not found.
2007-07-03T12:29:00.000Z	crolle17		how to delete them?
