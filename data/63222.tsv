2009-03-27T08:40:00.000Z	tweaksource		I've been using Linux, mainly Ubuntu, for about 3 years. Haven't used Windows @ home in a while. I have several thousand dollars in Audio Production software which is winblows only. I wanted to use it again so I installed fresh WinXp. Everything is fine. I installed Xubuntu 8.04 and the Network Autoconfig failed. I tried to manually configure and it won't initialize the interface. So I tried a Mandriva 2009.0 disc - no network. DSL
