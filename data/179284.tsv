2009-08-11T06:40:00.000Z	Statix138		GUYS I NEED HELP.  Where is the recycle bin on Ubantu, I did a rm -fr /etc/ and I need to get those files back
2009-08-11T06:40:00.000Z	jrib	Statix138	rm doesn't move things to any recycle bin
2009-08-11T06:42:00.000Z	jrib	Statix138	right click -> Move to trash   moves it to trash.  The « gvfs-trash » command moves it to trash on the command line.  « rm » does what it is supposed to: deletes things
2009-08-11T06:43:00.000Z	jrib	Statix138	just backup, reinstall, and find a new source of advice...
