2009-11-25T01:34:00.000Z	tophu		every time I shutdown for about a 1/4 sec there is an error about compiz it's not a big deal but is there an easy way I can see what that error is?
2009-11-25T01:35:00.000Z	Slart	tophu	it's probably the error that your screen isn't composited and you need to run something like compiz
2009-11-25T01:35:00.000Z	Slart	tophu	it's just there because compiz shuts down before X does
2009-11-25T01:36:00.000Z	tophu	Slart	thanks that's what I figured but I'm paranoid still learning the ropes and earning my beans ;-)
