2008-10-11T19:49:00.000Z	Mimi		When you do a distro upgrade, are your settings and extra applicactions (like skype, opera, Prism, etc)  gone? I've been with ubuntu since edgy, but I can't remember :-X
2008-10-11T19:49:00.000Z	pyro	Mimi	some configurations and obsoleted packages will be gone, and/or change but that's about it
2008-10-11T19:51:00.000Z	pyro	Mimi	custom config's will be left untouched but they may not work with the newer applications
2008-10-11T19:52:00.000Z	pyro	Mimi	for most applications ubuntu runs 'update' scripts that will help you merge your old configs to comply with the newer applications.  but that's a select case
