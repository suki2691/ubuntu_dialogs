2006-04-13T13:36:00.000Z	criminy		I'm installing gaim from cvs using checkinstall..what version # could I use that would not try to be overwritten when a dist-upgrade
2006-04-13T13:37:00.000Z	xfcefreak	criminy	there are repos for gaim beta 3 other than that you would have to pin it
2006-04-13T13:38:00.000Z	criminy	xfcefreak	I'd much rather build it myself
2006-04-13T13:39:00.000Z	xfcefreak	criminy	build it yourself than im just telling you grabbing the repo will stop 1.5 from conflickting or you can pin gaim2 so you dont get updates for it
