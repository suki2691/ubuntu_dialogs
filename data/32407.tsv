2010-05-06T20:55:00.000Z	IsmAvatar		If my computer has 64 bit support, is there any reason to not run 64 bit linux?
2010-05-06T20:56:00.000Z	junctions	IsmAvatar	my wife uses kubuntu-amd64, it's no problem except for some things that change like flash... also if you program you have to keep in mind that your binaries won't run in other computers
2010-05-06T20:56:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	junctions	good point. I am a heavy programmer.
2010-05-06T20:58:00.000Z	junctions	IsmAvatar	I'm not a heavy programmer, I imagine there are workarounds if you do use 64 bits (since it can still run 32bit programs I imagine it can also compile them, but you have to specify that when compiling)
