2008-02-11T08:12:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		ok I've lost my sound, I updated System76, rebooted, nothing is working. I tried going into update manager and package manager, i get this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/55563/plain/
2008-02-11T08:13:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		then I just realized I blindly followed forum posts and got the system76 driver, and I don't have a system76
2008-02-11T08:13:00.000Z	ahorriblemess		so... first step IO'd like to take is removing that system76 update haha
2008-02-11T08:13:00.000Z	frank23	ahorriblemess	heh I was just thinking if you a system76 computer you're in good hands
