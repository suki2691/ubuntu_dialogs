2008-05-09T18:52:00.000Z	babolat		hello all.. i have a weird issue here. i've been trolling forums and whatnot looking for something to tell me why i cannot ping or load google.com, google-analytics and anything to do with a google domain. this sitch does not change with opera, firefox or iexplorer.. last thing i did was create an ntpdate file but i hardly think that has anything to do with this
