2006-05-05T07:12:00.000Z	linux_galore	criminy	you have a running process that blocking access
2006-05-05T07:13:00.000Z	linux_galore	criminy	 use top to see whats running then kill it will killall -9 appname  most common problem is that dpkg-reconfigur is running so type sudo killall -9 dpkg-reconfigur
