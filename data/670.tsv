2012-10-25T04:31:00.000Z	AaronCampbell	PatrickDickey	Yeah, actually su root says "Unknown id" and su root_something is the one that says my passwd is wrong
2012-10-25T04:32:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	AaronCampbell	I would do a combination of what bin_bash and BusyBoxes are telling you. Boot to a live cd, mount the file system, and fix the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files.
