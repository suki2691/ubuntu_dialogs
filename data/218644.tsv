2010-04-28T21:09:00.000Z	fehrp		if I have a configure file called configure.ac and not configure as usual, how do I install that thing?
2010-04-28T21:11:00.000Z	fehrp		How do I install a package that comes with a "configure.ac" file instead of a "configure" file? I thought autoconf, but that only gives me errors about undefined macros
2010-04-28T21:12:00.000Z	sipior	fehrp	does autoreconf work for you?
