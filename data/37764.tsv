2011-02-17T00:40:00.000Z	Odaym		I was thinking of something more along the lines of the global Linux community agreeing on standard distros for Desktop usage, standard distros for Server usage and so on
2011-02-17T00:41:00.000Z	Odaym		but that does limit freedom since it would kill a lot of initiative in a lot of people/developers
2011-02-17T00:42:00.000Z	ohsix	Odaym	commercial distros are there to provide a standard for people that want one maintained over time
