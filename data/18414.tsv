2011-05-01T14:35:00.000Z	Simpson_2		will upgrading to 11.04 always replace my gnome2 desktop ?
2011-05-01T14:36:00.000Z	Simpson_2		is there a way to default it back to gnome2 ?
2011-05-01T14:37:00.000Z	Simpson_2		my parents around 70 won't survive such a dramatic switch so I would like to have the gnome2 as default for them
