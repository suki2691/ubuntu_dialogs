2005-11-04T16:52:00.000Z	kevix	deFrysk	that could be a problem. what boot loader would support it.
2005-11-04T16:54:00.000Z	deFrysk	kevix	if you would have a seperate /boot with no reiser4 on it so I would be able to keep on using grub
2005-11-04T16:54:00.000Z	kevix	deFrysk	that would seem the best way.
