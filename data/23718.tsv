2012-01-03T04:31:00.000Z	MaxHR		so why would rekonq and muon have security cert problems, and firefox doesn't? and how can I fix it?
2012-01-03T04:32:00.000Z	d1g1ta1	MaxHR	install the certificates into the other browsers
2012-01-03T04:37:00.000Z	MaxHR	d1g1ta1	how do I do that?  and how can I get Muon package manager to get them also?
2012-01-03T04:38:00.000Z	d1g1ta1	MaxHR	I'm afraid I'm not familiar with the browsers you are using
