2009-03-05T07:47:00.000Z	Awsoonn		I have a friend that wants to try linux, but her laptop only have 192Megs of RAM. What might I try? Full Ubuntu runs not so well.
2009-03-05T07:47:00.000Z	_VIM_	Awsoonn	Xubuntu maybe
2009-03-05T07:47:00.000Z	_VIM_		!xubuntu
2009-03-05T07:52:00.000Z	Awsoonn	_VIM_	I fear Xubuntu will not be enough alone, I use it at work on a machien with 256MB of ram and it is sluggish as all heck.
