2007-03-27T09:15:00.000Z	Brismetal		Hi, I've been having problems with 6.10 Ubuntu so I just installed the beta of the new one, after I complete installation and re-boot the grub loader does not show up.  I tried following a guide to set it up but still nothing, what can I do to check what's wrong?
