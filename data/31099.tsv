2011-05-23T20:14:00.000Z	arosen1		Hello, I rebooted my machine today and I'm getting this error on boot.  "add_mountroot_fail_hook: not found" Any idea what I need to do to fix this?
2011-05-23T20:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arosen1	 so the system is failing to boot? or just showing a message and booting normally?
2011-05-23T20:15:00.000Z	arosen1	Dr_Willis	Its failing to boot (I have the system booted off a live cd right now and I'm chrooted in)
2011-05-23T20:18:00.000Z	arosen1	Dr_Willis	do you have any idea?
