2008-01-08T04:16:00.000Z	Xintruder		any ideas why my laptop crahes?
2008-01-08T04:16:00.000Z	amarillion	Xintruder	hard to know, have you tried turning off all desktop effects?
2008-01-08T04:18:00.000Z	amarillion	Xintruder	yeah, if turning off desktop effects leads to fewer crashes then it could be compiz. But it could easily be something else as well, so you just have to try it for a while
