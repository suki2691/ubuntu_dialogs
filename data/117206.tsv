2012-06-17T09:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bwayne	 it uses a database. so is faster
2012-06-17T09:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bwayne	 users can have their own custom locate database of just their files and so forth if you want to index just your personal files.
2012-06-17T09:27:00.000Z	bwayne	Dr_Willis	I didn't know that.  I'll look into that, thanks.
