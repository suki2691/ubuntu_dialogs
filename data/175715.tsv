2006-07-06T10:09:00.000Z	Evilscientist		so I have a silly question....if you want to tranfer files (like for backup) between a windows client and dapper server....what should you format the drive as, ntfs, ext3?  does it matter?
2006-07-06T10:10:00.000Z	Evilscientist		anyone??
2006-07-06T10:11:00.000Z	Evilscientist		stpere...so it should be ext3 regardless?
2006-07-06T10:11:00.000Z	CptAJ	Evilscientist	make it ext3, you can upload from windows regardless
