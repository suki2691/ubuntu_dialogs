2010-10-16T11:11:00.000Z	Asthar		I mean, the radio button appears selected, but the effects don't work, and when I go back to the appearance and check the visual effects the NONE is selected again....
2010-10-16T11:11:00.000Z	Asthar		yeah soreau that's what I noticed, but how do I restore my old visual settings?
