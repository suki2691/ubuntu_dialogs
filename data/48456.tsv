2009-09-29T17:20:00.000Z	joaopinto	mo0nykit	no, a lot of makefiles do not provide an uninstall rule
2009-09-29T17:20:00.000Z	joaopinto	mo0nykit	you should use checkinstall to build .debs from source based builds
2009-09-29T17:21:00.000Z	mo0nykit	joaopinto	okay.. so it depends on the makefile. I'll check out CheckInstall.
