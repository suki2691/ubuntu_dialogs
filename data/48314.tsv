2012-06-24T00:14:00.000Z	xpistos		Hey everyone I am having a slight problem. I am trying to flash my WRT54G with DD-WRT from my Ubuntu 12.04 laptop. The Eth0 connects fine at first, but I have to repower the router, my connect does not come back up unless I reboot. Any ideas what I am doing wrong/

2012-06-24T00:26:00.000Z	OerHeks	xpistos	how often do you flash your router?
