2012-02-27T08:05:00.000Z	Sasori2501		hey guys... need some advice.  thinking of buying Alienware M14x, but REALLY concerned about video card, nvidia 555m and integrated video (optimus tech i believe) will be instsalling 11.04.  will i be able to disable the integrated video for pure nvidia use????
2012-02-27T08:07:00.000Z	dlentz	Sasori2501	avoid optimus like plague
2012-02-27T08:09:00.000Z	Sasori2501	dlentz	i know, but what solid gaming laptops come without it these days??? practically none...
2012-02-27T08:13:00.000Z	Sasori2501	dlentz	ok i will look into that.  need a viable solution cause i really want to run effects on it.  last attempt with optimus was a nightmare.
