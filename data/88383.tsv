2008-06-05T22:06:00.000Z	m_newton	uncle_billy	it is diffrent and some of my favorite plugins dont work,but it is faster
2008-06-05T22:07:00.000Z	uncle_billy	m_newton	- faster than 3.0b5?  I think that was the version released with Hardy...
2008-06-05T22:09:00.000Z	m_newton	uncle_billy	ya a little bit, not as much as 2 to 3 but still faster
