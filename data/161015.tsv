2007-04-22T14:22:00.000Z	Danltn		Could someone explain to me the workaround for this error? Link: http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/GRUB#Error_18
2007-04-22T14:23:00.000Z	Danltn		I know, but I'm not very competent, what changes should I make?
2007-04-22T14:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Danltn	Did this error start poping up recently?
2007-04-22T14:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Danltn	Or has GRUB never worked on this machine? Also have you changed hardware at all recently?
