2009-12-11T09:05:00.000Z	declan2		Hey guys. I have a very old machine with ubuntu on it in the other room. It actually has internet, and I can connect and browse. But I'm having some major trouble updating, it just keeps saying "404 not found" and stuff when I do sudo apt-get update
2009-12-11T09:06:00.000Z	Kensey	declan2	maybe very old repo files?
2009-12-11T09:06:00.000Z	declan2	Kensey	I would guess so. How can I fix that?
2009-12-11T09:07:00.000Z	declan2	Kensey	You mean using the GUI one?
