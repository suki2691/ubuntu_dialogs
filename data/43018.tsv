2010-03-27T08:23:00.000Z	Leif		I justt bought a new laptop, and it came with windows 7 64-bit, and I need to know, do I want the x86 ubuntu iso, or the AMD64 one?  It has an intel processor.
2010-03-27T08:23:00.000Z	WhiteDawn	Leif	amd64
2010-03-27T08:24:00.000Z	WhiteDawn	Leif	amd64 is named for x86_64 processors because amd was the first one to do it
2010-03-27T08:24:00.000Z	Leif	WhiteDawn	Ah, okay
