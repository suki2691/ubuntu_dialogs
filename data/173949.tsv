2009-12-07T02:23:00.000Z	SmokeyD		hey everyone, I am using karmic with grub2, but I am not getting the boot menu which let's me choose the kernel to boot, but I do have multiple kernels installed and present in /boot/grub/grub.cfg
2009-12-07T02:24:00.000Z	maco	SmokeyD	press esc a bunch really quick during boot
2009-12-07T02:24:00.000Z	maco	SmokeyD	just like with grub1 you have to press esc. unlike grub1, it doesnt *tell* you that
2009-12-07T02:24:00.000Z	SmokeyD	maco	is there a way to have the menu appear by default? I knew how to do it in the old grub, but not in the present one
