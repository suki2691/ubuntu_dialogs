2006-01-09T13:26:00.000Z	La_PaRCa		For whatever its worth, I cant get my embedded firefox totem player to play wmv files
2006-01-09T13:28:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	La_PaRCa	the latest WMV format and encrypted WMV don't work, so far as I know
2006-01-09T13:30:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	La_PaRCa	works for me... a bit choppy, but I do get vid/audio
2006-01-09T13:31:00.000Z	La_PaRCa	PuMpErNiCkLe	same setup here... used to be able to do it
