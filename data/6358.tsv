2012-01-25T18:16:00.000Z	DamienCassou	[u]ser	and remove the share when the user logs out ?
2012-01-25T18:17:00.000Z	[u]ser	DamienCassou	exactly
2012-01-25T18:19:00.000Z	DamienCassou	[u]ser	sorry, I don't know. To create the share, you can write a script and put it in the startup applications list. But I don't know the equivalent for log out applications
