2009-05-26T03:14:00.000Z	burvowski		Can someone explain to my why youtube videos play flawlessy in Movie Player, but are jittery/jumpy in my browser? Flash is flash, so I would think good performance in one would be the same in another app
2009-05-26T03:16:00.000Z	burvowski		So when mplayer loads a youtube video, is it not using Flash or something?
2009-05-26T03:17:00.000Z	burvowski		Ah oh well, I'll just live with it. When I need to watch a youtube video, I'll just copy and paste the the youtube video name into mplayer search. Is there anyway to get mplayer to play Hulu vids? That would solve all my problems
