2005-08-09T08:44:00.000Z	WebMaven		hello folks. I have successfully setup my SB Live 24-bit sound-card with alsa, but I am unsure how to get the microphone to work as well.
2005-08-09T08:46:00.000Z	WebMaven		how can I easily tell if the microphone is working?
2005-08-09T08:47:00.000Z	WebMaven		it's annoying to keep recording and listening to the file.
