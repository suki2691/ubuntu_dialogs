2008-01-04T03:51:00.000Z	Arelis		WHAT THE.. guys, all of the sudden my panels went crazy, kept reappearing and disappearing, and now i have no panel anymore.. not even when i run gnome-panel.
2008-01-04T03:52:00.000Z	IdleOne	Arelis	what did you install or uninstall before this started happening?
2008-01-04T03:52:00.000Z	Arelis	IdleOne	Nothing. I just.. clicked a youtube video
2008-01-04T03:57:00.000Z	Arelis	IdleOne	Okay, i tried killing X, and removing some files in /tmp. I had a panel again, but it started disappearing and reappearing again. What's causing that?
