2005-10-09T05:56:00.000Z	ompaul	umberleigh	well you fire up a firewall and then say I don't want it running - hmm - maybe remove the rules - bottom line those rules are only there to protect services and ubuntu does not run services you do not install
2005-10-09T05:59:00.000Z	umberleigh	ompaul	perhaps i'm not being very clear. i want to allow azureus the outbound connections it needs, but is there any way of restricting this to certain ports? atm azureus seems to be trying ports at random.
2005-10-09T06:00:00.000Z	ompaul	umberleigh	is that not the way azureus works? to be honest it is not something I run myself
