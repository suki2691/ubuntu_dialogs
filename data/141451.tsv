2007-04-07T09:31:00.000Z	matej		hello.. I have installed Kubuntu and later ubuntu-desktop and soon realised I prefer gnome. What would be the best way to uninstall kde and everything associated with kubuntu (I'd only like to keep a few kde apps which I can install back later)?
2007-04-07T09:31:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	matej	remove kubuntu-desktop
2007-04-07T09:31:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	matej	it's a meta-package which links to all the kubuntu stuff
2007-04-07T09:32:00.000Z	matej	SlimeyPete	hmm..I've tried but  it says only about 300kb would be removed...
