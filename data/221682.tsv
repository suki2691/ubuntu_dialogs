2008-08-26T18:55:00.000Z	cs02rm0		is there any software in the ubuntu repos that can shrink a dvd?
2008-08-26T18:55:00.000Z	frank23	cs02rm0	I think k9copy does it
2008-08-26T18:55:00.000Z	cs02rm0	frank23	thanks... is that kde dependent though?
2008-08-26T18:56:00.000Z	frank23	cs02rm0	well it depends on kde libraries
