2006-08-05T16:26:00.000Z	bob_		Does anyone know how to mount multiple windows partitions? I use this command ( sudo mount /dev/hdd1 /media/windows/ -t ntfs -o nls=utf8,umask=0222 )but it only mounts one partition at a time. My two windows partitions show up as hdd1 and hdd5 when I do ( sudo fdisk ) command.
