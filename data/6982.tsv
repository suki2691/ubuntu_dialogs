2011-12-19T18:20:00.000Z	CommanderMeat		Hi; I'm a pretty heavy gamer and I installed linux to get a smoother mouse input, But, I'm experiencing some sort of 'input lag' for lack of better terms, And I'm really not sure how to remedy it

2011-12-19T18:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	CommanderMeat	 you just installed ubuntu/linux to get a better gaming experience?
2011-12-19T18:23:00.000Z	CommanderMeat	dr_willis	Yes, But I only play quake2/live, Which both have linux support
