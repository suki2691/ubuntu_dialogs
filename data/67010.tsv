2010-02-01T23:32:00.000Z	hardcorE0x1a4		I have a Realtek 8172 wireless card aka Realtek 8192se in windows and I cannot for the live of me get it to work with ubuntu 9.10 32 bit or 64 bit: is there anyone that can provide some advice?
2010-02-01T23:33:00.000Z	hardcorE0x1a4		I've gone the route of ndiswrapper and I've tried the native driver from the website
