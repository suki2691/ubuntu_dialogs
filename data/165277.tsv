2006-11-03T09:29:00.000Z	luisbg		I'm going to buy a new monitor today... should I change the hsync vsync info at xorg.conf or will ubuntu handle that for me? will I need to reboot

2006-11-03T09:32:00.000Z	ifireball	luisbg	you should try commenting out the lins 1st and see if it works for you, you should already have an 'Option "DPMS"' line there
