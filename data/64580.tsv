2010-12-31T07:52:00.000Z	Jezek		alright im trying to generate an openssl key
2010-12-31T07:53:00.000Z	Jezek		but when i enter in the command it just shows a > and a blinking cursor

2010-12-31T07:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Jezek	you could try typing "eof" which should finish the command - but i still think there is an issue
