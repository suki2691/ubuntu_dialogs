2005-12-10T12:45:00.000Z	Necrocide		I got a question. I'm new to linux so don't kill me for my stupid questions. I just installed Ubuntu, and rebooted to login. I'm like in this console window, what's the command to start the GUI of Ubuntu? Also, under the installation I did not get promted to create a root password? So I can not login as root.
