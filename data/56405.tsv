2009-05-25T09:22:00.000Z	KoshB5_		I have an ehternet network (no internet) and a wireless (has internet). How do I configure apps to use the wireless for internet access?

2009-05-25T09:24:00.000Z	KoshB5_	fryguy	how do I do that? Right now, when I plug in the cat5 I loose the wireless
2009-05-25T09:25:00.000Z	KoshB5_	fryguy	yes
