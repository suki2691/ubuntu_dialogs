2010-01-15T04:48:00.000Z	ckhikuzad		I recently installed Xmonad, and i set it as my default window manager, i am now stuck in either my mouse cursor or command line, how can i change my default window manager from the command line interface?
2010-01-15T04:49:00.000Z	blakkheim	ckhikuzad	that "my mouse cursor" is xmonad
2010-01-15T04:50:00.000Z	ckhikuzad	blakkheim	i assumed that on the first run. but i dont have any xmonad commands written down, and i go directly to my desktop without the login screen
2010-01-15T04:51:00.000Z	ckhikuzad	blakkheim	i need to know how to set GNOME as my default again
