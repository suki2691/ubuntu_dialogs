2009-01-07T04:40:00.000Z	faileas		*sigh* i sometimes think ubuntu needs to come with a little text file with IRC etiqitte, and rexpect people to read em ;p
2009-01-07T04:41:00.000Z	Zinbur	faileas	don't people read that list of suggestions for asking questions in the irc?
2009-01-07T04:41:00.000Z	faileas	Zinbur	nope. people don't do anything unless its practically pasted on their eyelids. lucky for me, i started IRC elsewhere ;p
2009-01-07T04:42:00.000Z	Zinbur	faileas	I at least try to read up on proper etiquette even if I do ask some dumb questions sometimes
