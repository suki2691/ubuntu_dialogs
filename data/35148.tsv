2011-02-12T05:41:00.000Z	tripelb	Prillicy	be nice. have you looked at the ubuntu documentation pages. how far have you gotten
2011-02-12T05:43:00.000Z	tripelb	Prillicy	and then when you rebooted what happened? you might want to boot from the cd and do an integrity check on the cd. no sense doing a lot of work before then.
