2011-09-29T16:14:00.000Z	mamirulamin		I have upgraded ubuntu 10.04 to 11.04, I had a LAMP environment setup, after upgrade LAMP is not there and most horrible thing is that I don't see var/www/ folder now

2011-09-29T16:15:00.000Z	mamirulamin	MonkeyDust	actual issue is with /va/ww removal, how can I get it back?
