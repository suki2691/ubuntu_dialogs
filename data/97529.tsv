2009-09-30T01:20:00.000Z	ltcabral	arand	well my vlc is not playing it... what plugin do i need?
2009-09-30T01:25:00.000Z	arand	ltcabral	vlc shouldn't need any plugins I don't think, for totem you'll probably need the ubuntu-restricted-extras package (specifically gstreamer I assume)... But then again, if vlc won't play it, it might be just the file is faulty...
