2010-05-05T01:11:00.000Z	Paradigm_Shift		I upgrade to 10.04 from 9.10 using apt, and when now grub 2 displays nothing until my desktop comes up.
2010-05-05T01:11:00.000Z	Paradigm_Shift		how can I restore graphical boot
2010-05-05T01:11:00.000Z	superfirelord42	Paradigm_Shift	you have to hold shift to get grub to come up
2010-05-05T01:11:00.000Z	superfirelord42	Paradigm_Shift	but you can edit the config file to get it to come up by default
