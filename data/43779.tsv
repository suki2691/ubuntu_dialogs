2009-11-07T08:15:00.000Z	wrgb	designer	i think that's the way it's going to be - 9.10 will recognize ext3 but not vice versa
2009-11-07T08:15:00.000Z	designer	wrgb	I was told that ext4 is backwards compatible
2009-11-07T08:16:00.000Z	designer	wrgb	is there anything I can install on 8.10 (actually I got 8.10 and not 9.04, sorry) so that I can access ext4 ?
2009-11-07T08:17:00.000Z	wrgb	designer	not that i'm aware of
