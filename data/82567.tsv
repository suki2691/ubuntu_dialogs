2009-11-14T01:10:00.000Z	tom__	guntbert	phil_fl:  has it ever been in the repositories?  like in some early alpha version or so?  because the tab-completion of aptitude finds the freecad package on my computer.,..   seems like if something left "a trace" of it on my computer.. although I personally nevere installed it...

2009-11-14T01:16:00.000Z	tom__	guntbert	 phil_fl thx anyway :) I will just try the version on the website then... :)
