2011-10-16T03:40:00.000Z	Phail_Quail		Is there a petition somewhere that I can sign to help prevent Ubuntu, which used to be a really neat OS, from traveling further down the fail path it seems to be on? (i.e. Unity, et al)
2011-10-16T03:41:00.000Z	Phail_Quail		It is not just Unity - this is the first Ubuntu that doesn't recognize my monitor, my mouse, or my keyboard out-of-the-box. All previous issues worked flawlessly.

2011-10-16T03:43:00.000Z	Phail_Quail	danslo	Is that what we're going to have to do? I've been with Ubuntu since 8.04 and now Ubuntu is completely unrecognizable. Why does Ubuntu feel the need to emulate OSX and Windows when it was already head-and-shoulders above those two? Does it really have nothing else to contribute to the software community these days?
