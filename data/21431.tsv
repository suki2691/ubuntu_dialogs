2012-04-12T03:07:00.000Z	FrozenFire		Curious. I installed Ubuntu via Wubi (to dual-boot with 7), and it failed to boot. Drops to initramfs and says it gave up waiting for root device.
2012-04-12T03:08:00.000Z	FrozenFire		The two possible issues I see are that 1) I have a Truecrypt-encrypted system disk, and 2) It looked like it was downloading the amd64 ISO, and this is an Intel 64-bit processor.
2012-04-12T03:08:00.000Z	FrozenFire		Any ideas?
