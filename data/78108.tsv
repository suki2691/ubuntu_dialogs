2008-10-01T13:23:00.000Z	Sdz	Crungmungus	try to google a tutorial about "flash player" and "pulseaudio" on ubuntu forums
2008-10-01T13:30:00.000Z	Sdz	Crungmungus	when i'm at home if you're there i'll pm you the URI of that tutorial
2008-10-01T13:30:00.000Z	Sdz	Crungmungus	actually most of the packages wont work good in all situations. There's one install that doesnt work bad at all for me, but i don't have the tutorial under hand
