2012-03-29T05:00:00.000Z	EvilResistance	ActionParsnip	 is there a way for me to make a custom LiveCD image that installs gnome-shell by default along with Unity?
2012-03-29T05:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EvilResistance	sure, you can remaster the ISO and make itas you desire
2012-03-29T05:00:00.000Z	EvilResistance	ActionParsnip	 is there a way to exclude Unity, as well?  Or is unity a dependency of GNOME3 :P
2012-03-29T05:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EvilResistance	you can remove the unity packages, I pulled unity2D and Unity off today after adding a PPA that screwed my OS
