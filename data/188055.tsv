2006-11-29T14:44:00.000Z	Minty		hello
2006-11-29T14:44:00.000Z	Minty		how can I boot and see if all boots up rather than just the slash screen
2006-11-29T14:46:00.000Z	LjL	Minty	... by... doing it and seeing if it does?
2006-11-29T14:46:00.000Z	Minty	LjL	what I mean is that I am sure I have a problme with the reseau and I would like to see the text mode at booting to see if I have OK or failed
