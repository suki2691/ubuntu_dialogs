2007-06-30T12:57:00.000Z	Plantain		Okay, I borked my xorg.conf file, how might I reset it?
2007-06-30T12:59:00.000Z	lmc_phx	Plantain	you want to: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-06-30T13:06:00.000Z	Plantain	lmc_phx	I've got two screens, a dual screen setup
2007-06-30T13:06:00.000Z	lmc_phx	Plantain	oh, I see, I have no skills in that area. sorry
