2009-02-27T03:16:00.000Z	rww	loras	xorg does autodetection by default, now. If you need to add manual configuration stuff, just add it to the file.
2009-02-27T03:17:00.000Z	loras	rww	so it won't try to "reconfigure" it, every boot? Well, thank you :) :) :) Will try it
2009-02-27T03:17:00.000Z	rww	loras	correct, settings you put in there override any autodetected ones.
