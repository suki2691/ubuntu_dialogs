2010-01-05T18:07:00.000Z	uncmar	knoxville	I don't know.  I always end up disconnecting,  changing directory and then reconnecting.  A real pain but... that is what I do. :(
2010-01-05T18:08:00.000Z	knoxville	uncmar	Ahhh.. That can't be true, there must be a way.
2010-01-05T18:08:00.000Z	uncmar	knoxville	I didn't say it couldn't be done.  I said I don't know how.
