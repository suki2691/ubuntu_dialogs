2010-08-23T20:27:00.000Z	anders_		I've got a (probably simple) question about permissions for an FTP account. I want to upload files to /var/www using FTP. I considered it wise not to use my ordinary account, so I created a special user for this. But how do I grant this user permission to upload use /var/www?
