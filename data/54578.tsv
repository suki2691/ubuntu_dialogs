2010-03-26T15:01:00.000Z	Sensiva	_Luca_	are you trying to install Lucid?
2010-03-26T15:03:00.000Z	Sensiva	_Luca_	great, it seems you didn't read Lucid's release notes carefully, the current wubi is buggy, you need to download it from here http://releases.ubuntu.com/10.04/wubi.exe
2010-03-26T15:03:00.000Z	Sensiva	_Luca_	for further info, please ask in #ubuntu+1
