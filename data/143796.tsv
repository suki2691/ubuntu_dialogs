2007-03-06T11:58:00.000Z	Remowylliams		Hello everyone. I have a command line question and I hope someone can answer it for me. what is the utility to find the date for a given unix time? in BSD date -r 1173696400, tells me what date, timezone etc it is.
2007-03-06T11:59:00.000Z	nikosapi	Remowylliams	date?
2007-03-06T12:00:00.000Z	Remowylliams	nikosapi	No it seems sys V date doesn't do that conversion. I can give it a date and see the seconds but not the other way around.
2007-03-06T12:00:00.000Z	nikosapi	Remowylliams	ohh
