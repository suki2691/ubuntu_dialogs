2008-04-20T03:49:00.000Z	Animortis		Is there a way a program is initialized but does not appear in ps -A
2008-04-20T03:51:00.000Z	Animortis		Let me rephrase: I have a program in /etc/init.d that will start and stop like any other script but it won't start when the system boots. Does anyone know why?
