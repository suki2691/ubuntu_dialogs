2010-04-29T04:18:00.000Z	canozan		i was trying to make room in order to install xp, and i wanted to resize one of my primary partitions, win7 installed on it. windows manager and gparted didn't let me do that, and i run magic partition, which started with an error warning, i said ok, and i think it changed starting and endind values of my partitions
2010-04-29T04:19:00.000Z	canozan		i had 196GB partition with win7 on it, and now it is only 33GB, i can mount it but with gparted, my entire hard disk seems to be unallocated, although i can see my partitions in terminal
