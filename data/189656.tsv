2007-03-20T10:45:00.000Z	warlock		Hey guys, when doing a apt-get upgrade It wants to upgrade the kernel too, is there a way to not upgrade the kernel but everything else?
2007-03-20T10:45:00.000Z	warlock		Anyone? :(
2007-03-20T10:46:00.000Z	warlock		Does anyone know how to upgrade a specefic thing (such as gzip) and nothing else?
