2010-06-14T00:43:00.000Z	underdev		hi!  I tried using the Places->Connect to server for the first time.  I can connect to my ftp server, but instead of opening a folder, it opens a tab in firefox.  Is there anyway I can open it as a folder to simplify transfering files?

2010-06-14T00:45:00.000Z	underdev	ActionParsnip	ty, but that's disappointing
2010-06-14T00:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	underdev	not something i've used
