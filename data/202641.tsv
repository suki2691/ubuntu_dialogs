At 65% it is as whisper, at 50% it is completly silent (this is with my speakers cranked up fairly high). Can anyone shed some light on what's wrong?

2006-06-11T14:20:00.000Z	wweasel	krazykit	i think this is just master. it's the speaker in the top panel. how would i check PCM?
2006-06-11T14:21:00.000Z	wweasel	krazykit	no, i double clicked on it. and pcm is at about 80%
