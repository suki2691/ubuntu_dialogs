2006-05-20T14:12:00.000Z	chowells		you typed 'firefox' in the wrong terminal?
2006-05-20T14:12:00.000Z	pozdiy_	chowells	no, remote system has Konqueror (and I do not have KDE locally), so I have no problems
2006-05-20T14:13:00.000Z	chowells	pozdiy_	huh? 'ssh -X <hostname or IP>' then type 'firefox'. It can't not work
2006-05-20T14:13:00.000Z	pozdiy_	chowells	local firefox gets launched, I remember the same behaviour few years ago on remote SGI ssytem - must be some X default
