2011-06-21T06:32:00.000Z	spaghetti		Hi! I am a Ubuntu newbie needing help with video settings under Xubuntu 11.04.  Would someone kindly help me?
2011-06-21T06:34:00.000Z	spaghetti		I am running Xubuntu 11.04 on a Dell Inspiron 8500 old laptop. Somehow all of the desktop icons as well as the mouse cursor are very blurry.  How do I fix it?
