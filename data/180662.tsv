2007-12-28T11:30:00.000Z	muaddib		How does one rebuild ubuntu kernel. There seems to be 2 methods the first is to either download via apt-get source linux-source-2.6.22 or get it from the git repository
2007-12-28T11:30:00.000Z	muaddib		Which one
2007-12-28T11:30:00.000Z	bruenig	muaddib	either
2007-12-28T11:32:00.000Z	muaddib	bruenig	what is the difference... From what I can tell the documentation says the kernel-source package is older than the git repository and doesn't have latest patches is that correct
