2010-10-16T07:02:00.000Z	eboyjr		How can I install Ubuntu M on my netbook without a cd drive or usb stick? I already have the iso image and it would be good to use that if I can. I also have grub installed already
2010-10-16T07:04:00.000Z	i2v8an	eboyjr	when unity crashes it immediately restarts and the programs are still there
2010-10-16T07:05:00.000Z	eboyjr	i2v8an	Which programs? does it crash very often
2010-10-16T07:06:00.000Z	i2v8an	eboyjr	I'm just assuming that it's crashing.  sometimes the sidebar will disappear and then reappear
