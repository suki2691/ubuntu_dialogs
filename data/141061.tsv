2009-01-05T15:22:00.000Z	Trenter		I'm a migrating windows user and I am trying to find the Linux equivilant of Task Manager, mainly because I am trying to force stop a program in wine
2009-01-05T15:24:00.000Z	Trenter		I have a window titled "Untitled Window" but it does not show up in the list of processes

2009-01-05T15:26:00.000Z	raylu	Trenter	but what you probably want is wineserver -k
