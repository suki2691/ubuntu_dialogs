2006-10-01T15:04:00.000Z	cM0ss		I've already done all that
2006-10-01T15:05:00.000Z	cM0ss		I have ran the programs...my radeon does not support flgrx....I put ati back as the driver and am using it now...but I need hardware acceleration and am told DRI will do that....but don't know how to enable.
2006-10-01T15:06:00.000Z	bronklavier	cM0ss	put Load "DRI" in the MOdules section in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-10-01T15:13:00.000Z	cM0ss	bronklavier	the dri module is already in X11....I still have no hardware acceleration
