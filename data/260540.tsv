2006-05-27T12:55:00.000Z	superm1		could someone make me a recommendation on a window manager?  I'm looking to have no window decorations but still maintain a focus-follows-mouse model.  Ratpoison would be perfect had I been able to enable focus follows mouse for it

2006-05-27T12:56:00.000Z	freakabcd	superm1	you wan only focus follows mouse, with simple window deco? then *box is your answer iirc
