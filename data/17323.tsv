2011-06-05T11:36:00.000Z	floodplain	robin0800	hi, how do you mean completely remove? apt-get remove --purge apache2 mysql-server php5 phpmyadmin
2011-06-05T11:37:00.000Z	floodplain		I'm looking at ubuntu-tweak at the minute
2011-06-05T11:39:00.000Z	robin0800	floodplain	yes that sort of thing and a reboot before reinstall
