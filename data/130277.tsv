2008-04-26T07:02:00.000Z	theunixgeek		I installed Ubuntu on my MacBook but now I can't boot from the Ubuntu partition. How do I fix this?
2008-04-26T07:02:00.000Z	ffm_	theunixgeek	What happens when you try to boot?
2008-04-26T07:03:00.000Z	theunixgeek	ffm_	when I hold down alt, I don't get a choice to boot into the Linux partition - only the OS X partition
2008-04-26T07:04:00.000Z	ffm_	theunixgeek	I don't use OSX, so I can't be _all_ that much help. Sorry.
