2004-09-29T14:23:00.000Z	stragier		first of all, hi ! I'm having troubles playing mp3's with totem through my samba network. Is this the right place to ask questions ?
2004-09-29T14:25:00.000Z	stragier		rythmbox doesn't seem to be lauched correctly by nautilus ... Nothing seems to happen ...
2004-09-29T14:26:00.000Z	stragier		Totem seems to be the default mp3 player. I suppose i should change this
2004-09-29T14:27:00.000Z	psi	stragier	let me know if you CAN change it
