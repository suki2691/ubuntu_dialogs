2009-10-14T08:37:00.000Z	jumpkick_		Hi, I was wondering if there is a way to make the ubnuntu splash screen actually tell me when it's going to do a fsck?
2009-10-14T08:38:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	jumpkick_	You could turn off the splash screen.
2009-10-14T08:39:00.000Z	jumpkick_	leaf-sheep	can I just uninstall it or is there some funky deps
