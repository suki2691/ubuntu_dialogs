2012-05-03T20:45:00.000Z	thomas91991		anyone know how to change the screen dimming timeout in 12.04?
2012-05-03T20:47:00.000Z	Captain_Proton	thomas91991	brightness and lock in system settings
2012-05-03T20:49:00.000Z	thomas91991	Captain_Proton	 there is no setting to set the timeout
2012-05-03T20:57:00.000Z	Captain_Proton	thomas91991	you have to install gconf-editor and dig around in there
