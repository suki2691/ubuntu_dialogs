2007-09-24T11:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	rellik__	A re-install is almost never necessary
2007-09-24T11:07:00.000Z	rellik__	Jordan_U	yeah, I know..  but I'm dealing with this small issue that I can't seem to figure out...
2007-09-24T11:10:00.000Z	rellik__	Jordan_U	at login (to gnome) I was getting an error msg abot trash applet (for the panel), and the panel was screwed up, and I couldn't alt-tab, alt-f2, etc..  so I took trashapplet off the panel, and the error msg doesn't come up anymore..  but all the other issues are still there
