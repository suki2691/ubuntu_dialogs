2006-01-06T16:31:00.000Z	andrew_		lemme run something by y'all: there's the adm group for users created as admins, and the users group (assumedly) for those who are not in adm.  however, there's no group that encompasses both (e.g. for allowing all users on a system access to a folder).  it seems like that should be something that happens automatically.  am i missing something or could i file a feature request for that?
2006-01-06T16:32:00.000Z	yaaar	andrew_	i thought the users group *did* encompass the adm group?
2006-01-06T16:33:00.000Z	andrew_	yaaar	at the moment (new install from yesterday) i have no members in users at all; i created 5 for my family yesterday.
