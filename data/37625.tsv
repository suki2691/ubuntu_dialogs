2010-02-08T06:43:00.000Z	dht123		so let me get this straight -- there are NO tax applications AT ALL for Linux?
2010-02-08T06:44:00.000Z	dht123		I dont care if it's under wine as long as it works and I don't have to buy a copy of Win7...
2010-02-08T06:46:00.000Z	dht123		Now is there a program that works under wine that lets you import a 2008 TurboTax file created under Windows Vista?
