2007-09-19T08:06:00.000Z	Sayed		Also, I want to boot off of a USB hard disk, do I place the ISO in the main directory?
2007-09-19T08:07:00.000Z	Pelo	Sayed	you'll need to unpack the iso and make sure it is at the top level
2007-09-19T08:07:00.000Z	Sayed	Pelo	Alright. Does the rest of the top level have to be clear?
