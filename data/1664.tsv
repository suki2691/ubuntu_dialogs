2012-08-07T03:32:00.000Z	js___		I just installed Ubuntu on my laptop, and I notice I get poor battery life. Does anyone know of a utility I can install to get more power management configuration options?
2012-08-07T03:33:00.000Z	js___		ive done that.. no dice.. I had windows 7 on here before this, and the battery life was better.. decent..

2012-08-07T03:34:00.000Z	js___	danielboston26	I realize that.. what I am asking for is a program to help me manage the power better.. not magically generate power
