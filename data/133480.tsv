2007-05-21T08:00:00.000Z	ebees		Hi all, I have 6.06 installed on my l my desktop and laptop. I have a scanner which works as user on the desktop, but despite comparing settings between the two machines, I can only use it as root on the laptop. I've google-boogled the problem and checked UbuntuForums (where I posted my own fix the first time around on my desktop). Any advice or assistance would be appreciated.
