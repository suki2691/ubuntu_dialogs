2010-01-25T21:54:00.000Z	jph_		I have a small scale web server for a small organization... we don't really want to be listed anywhere, don't want to be bothered... the website is for basic information distribution and employee login...  How do i keep us in the gray i have already created the robots.txt with useragent: * and disallow: all  hat else can i add to that file and what else can I do to the box to keep people form just randomly finding us

2010-01-25T21:56:00.000Z	jph_	DreamDemon	can you recommend a template file or something that i can then modify to meet our needs like one that says if your not coming from some IP from within the US disallow
2010-01-25T21:56:00.000Z	DreamDemon	jph_	there is a ton of info which can be found on google for it
