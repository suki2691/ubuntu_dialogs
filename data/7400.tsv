2011-12-02T23:22:00.000Z	zagabar		How can I see where a loaded ELF file searches for a particular .so file? I do have the file on my system but it cannot find it.
2011-12-02T23:23:00.000Z	Guest67345	zagabar	find
2011-12-02T23:23:00.000Z	Guest67345	zagabar	or locate
2011-12-02T23:24:00.000Z	zagabar	Guest67345	I am not looking for the file itself. I am looking for where the ELF file looks for it.
