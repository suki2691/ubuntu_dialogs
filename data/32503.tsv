2012-01-30T10:10:00.000Z	Josh|KilljoyX23		having some trouble booting from USB on my old VAIO to install Ubuntu. Can't seem to change the boot from Windows Vista. Can anyone help?

2012-01-30T10:12:00.000Z	|Anthony|	Josh|KilljoyX23	when you boot your laptop, there should be a boot screen that gives you available Fx buttons... might be F2 or DEL sometimes
2012-01-30T10:14:00.000Z	|Anthony|	Josh|KilljoyX23	 could be F10 or F12... ask google about your laptop and a manual
