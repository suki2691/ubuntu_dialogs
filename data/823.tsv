2012-10-11T20:06:00.000Z	ubuntu_user_need		My wife mounted a hard drive on her account, now I am using the computer on my account, and I can't see the hard drive (can't mount it or use it unless I force unmount then remount). Does anyone know how to fix this issue so both of us could use the hard drive?

2012-10-11T20:08:00.000Z	L3mce		of course... if it were in fstab, you should both see it
