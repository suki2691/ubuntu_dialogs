2008-03-28T17:23:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Bryan_sierra	use gparted, rightclick, and set the boot flag
2008-03-28T17:25:00.000Z	Bryan_sierra	Svenstaro	is there an easier way ?
2008-03-28T17:25:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Bryan_sierra	well there always is the way using fdisk, cfdisk, parted, which I dont recommend you attempt or you could break stuff in horrible ways
