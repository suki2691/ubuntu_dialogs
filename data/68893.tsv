2009-02-19T21:59:00.000Z	jamiejackson		i've got to try to find a draggable spot on the top panel. it's crammed
2009-02-19T22:00:00.000Z	Cotowar	jamiejackson	possibly add another top panel?
2009-02-19T22:00:00.000Z	Cotowar		i did that to my bottom panel, i have a panel where stuff shows thats running, and a panel where all my quickstart icons are located
2009-02-19T22:01:00.000Z	jamiejackson	Cotowar	if only i could find a spot to drag... :-O i'll figure it out eventually
