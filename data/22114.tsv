2011-01-28T22:34:00.000Z	geekbri	itaylor57	i found even the JRE wanted to install packages i had no use for.
2011-01-28T22:35:00.000Z	itaylor57	geekbri	good luck tracking down the errors and finding the dependancies at run time
2011-01-28T22:36:00.000Z	geekbri	itaylor57	it was more things like asound, and x11-common that i dont want.  I can always install thngs like debuggers after the fact
