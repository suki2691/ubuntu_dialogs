2012-10-20T18:45:00.000Z	freijon		I'll try it again. I'm trying to watch DVDs with my new laptop. I installed libdvdcss2 (using the instructions from http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/10/how-to-enable-dvd-playback-in-ubuntu?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+d0od+%28OMG%21+Ubuntu%21%29 ). I still cant play DVDs. I can open the DVD with my file browser but cannot play the files. Help is appreciated

2012-10-20T18:45:00.000Z	freijon	tacomaster	I have the same problem at school. I think its the wireless security they use there which causes problems with linux. it works everywhere else
2012-10-20T18:46:00.000Z	tacomaster	freijon	that would make since because the router i have at home is using wep atm and there is no issues at all but the work is wpa2
