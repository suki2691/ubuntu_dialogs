2005-08-25T13:40:00.000Z	newman	jtan325	i usually do my linux work in blackbox, however sometimes when i want a full multimedia PC and it is good enough i run KDE
2005-08-25T13:42:00.000Z	newman	jtan325	granted, but for ease of use w/ unfamiliar people gnome usually suffices as opposed to metacity or enlightenment
