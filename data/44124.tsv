2009-11-01T00:52:00.000Z	SporkWitch	mebigfatguy	guess just bad timing on my part, then; buddy swears up and down by ubuntu, figured i'd give it a shot since i'd heard it usually sees most laptop stuff out of the box, but yeah, once the GUI loads (which takes about 10-15 minutes, no exageration), i get no response from keyboard or touchpad (not even the numlock indicator, when i hit numlock), and it eventually puts itself to sleep due to lack of input

2009-11-01T00:54:00.000Z	SporkWitch	mebigfatguy	heh, been using Gentoo and FreeBSD off and on since i was a kid, i know better than to slap a new distro on without a test drive :P
