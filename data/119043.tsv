2007-11-21T21:38:00.000Z	kski		anyone know why i'd get an error on the linux-server package when doing a fresh install?
2007-11-21T21:39:00.000Z	kski		it says try doing apt-get upgrade
2007-11-21T21:39:00.000Z	kski		but i can't find the apt-get program on the cd
2007-11-21T21:40:00.000Z	bazhang	kski	that is a terminal command not a program
