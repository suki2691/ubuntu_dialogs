2008-02-06T07:56:00.000Z	mac43123	kenalex	it kinda depends are what you are doing with it - running openoffice you won't be able to tell - but I presonnely notice better perfomace with some intensive apps like virtual box
2008-02-06T07:57:00.000Z	mac43123	kenalex	bear in mind 64 bit often has challenges with sound and java and what not - for the everyday user 32bit is still easier imho
2008-02-06T08:01:00.000Z	mac43123	kenalex	absolutely 32bit then
