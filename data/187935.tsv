2006-05-11T11:12:00.000Z	ChrisC		during my weekly security update today, I'm told that I must upgrade 68 packages ... looks to be mostly x.org stuff.  How do I tell which drivers my x.org setup is using?
2006-05-11T11:12:00.000Z	ChrisC		so I can uninstall the unused driver packages
2006-05-11T11:13:00.000Z	ChrisC		yes
