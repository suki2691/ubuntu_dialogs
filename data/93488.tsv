2008-04-26T15:54:00.000Z	otarid		anyone got 8.04 to detect nvidia cards at start up? I tried enabling restricted drivers, reconfiguring xserver, using the binary, using envy, modifying xorg.conf, but I keep getting into a low graphics mode when I boot. I'm using the -14 kernel version from the grub menu because I couldn't get my 3945 network card to work with the newer kernel :<

2008-04-26T15:56:00.000Z	zeno	otarid	try ndiswrapper, and your windows driver
2008-04-26T15:57:00.000Z	otarid	zeno	ndiswrapper didn't work
