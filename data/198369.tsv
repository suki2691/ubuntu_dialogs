I have a Sony Vaio, VGN-NR385E, and when i plug in head phones the internal speakers still broadcast.  It is annoying and makes the laptop unusable in public if I want to hear web content

2008-08-15T08:48:00.000Z	tom_	mzuverink	I had the same problem on a dell laptop...I don't remember what I did, but I removed something -- I'm pretty sure it was a package
2008-08-15T08:53:00.000Z	mzuverink	tom_	Well if you think of the package that would be great, it is a new shiny laptop, came with Vista which I never even booted into but I am sure that it worked like it should have in that OS since they probably designed it to work with Vista.  I am desperate to get this fixed as my classes start soon and i will be using it at school.  So if you think of the package, let me know and Ill give it a try.  Thanks
