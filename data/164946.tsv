2008-05-20T20:03:00.000Z	Gasten		Hi! on my gdm-login screen I got a resolution that's waaay off (too big). How can I change it (it is perfectly fine when I log into the system)? thanks
2008-05-20T20:03:00.000Z	neil_d	Gasten	try System->Preference->Screen Resolution

2008-05-20T20:06:00.000Z	neil_d	Gasten	I don't know how to affect that.
