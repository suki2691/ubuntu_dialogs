2008-06-28T19:01:00.000Z	slide		I'm trying to install Ubuntu on an empty area of my hd where I already have xp and osx installed on, i got to the point in the install where it says loading partition manager but nothing ever came up so I went to another console and ran top and see that "ntfsresize" is running and consuming cpu and memory, did this thing automatically resize my partitions? i never told it to do anything wtf
