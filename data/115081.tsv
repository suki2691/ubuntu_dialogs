2007-11-16T01:28:00.000Z	torkel_		Could anyone tell me if it's possible to install ubuntu on an external usb-drive and make it boot from a macbook? I've installed ubuntu on the external drive, but it won't leave the bootrecord alone... turning it from a GUID boot record to MBR
2007-11-16T01:29:00.000Z	ir4d0m	torkel_	im pretty sure it is from what i did...
2007-11-16T01:31:00.000Z	torkel_	ir4d0m	I deleted the partitions on the external drive, made it a GUID disk using Disk Utility. Booted the macbook on the livecd, installed ubuntu on the external usb-drive.... next time I hold down option when booting the mac no external drive is available booting from... only the internal drive and cdrom. Any tips?
2007-11-16T01:31:00.000Z	torkel_	ir4d0m	did you manually partition the external drive with the ubuntu installer or did you "use entire disk"?
