2007-12-13T21:12:00.000Z	barongas		My ndiswrapper problems seem to arise from irq assignments, checked my acpi log and from what I read I think it might be colliding with a usb hub, as you notice I am a layman and don't know what the next step would be. I want to be able to help myself though but if anyone could give me a nudge in the right direction I'd be grateful.
