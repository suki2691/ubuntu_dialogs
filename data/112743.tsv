2008-07-06T09:27:00.000Z	earlmred	naynay	yes, grub can boot xp.
2008-07-06T09:27:00.000Z	earlmred	naynay	should be the first result on google for "boot windows from grub"
2008-07-06T09:28:00.000Z	naynay	earlmred	 okay, i looked some but the solultion i found gave me a grub error somethign about invalid executable type, but i'll look again, i probably messed it up
