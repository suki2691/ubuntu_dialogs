2011-08-28T23:55:00.000Z	valberg		hi - i'm having problems getting my wine (running on ubuntu 11.04) to detect my dvd drive (i'm trying to burn a iso file using imgburn which is a win program)
2011-08-28T23:55:00.000Z	valberg		somehow ubuntu just got too fancy and i can't just write /media/cdrom for the drive location
2011-08-28T23:55:00.000Z	valberg		any ideas?
2011-08-28T23:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	valberg	/media/cdrom is a mount point NOT a device!!!
