2010-03-30T07:17:00.000Z	Syndey		my Ubuntu freezes. I think it is flash. I'd like to remove flash. I've been asking about my freezing for over a week on and off.
2010-03-30T07:17:00.000Z	coz_	Syndey	 is this only happening when viewing flash?
2010-03-30T07:22:00.000Z	Syndey	coz_	I dont know. It happens. there are a lot of tabs open usually. I am NOT watching flash at that time. Nor is any specifically youtube tab open. I am trying to avoid it. I'd like to disable flash but I just changed my default browser from chrome ot firlfox in case it is chrome.
2010-03-30T07:22:00.000Z	coz_	Syndey	 mm  which video card do you have?
