2008-06-07T20:22:00.000Z	sluxor		Hi I've been running multi-boot systems for a while, can I get any advice on dualbooting with windows vista when installing windows vista last.. and a way to be able to wipe and reinstall windows without overwriting the MBR
2008-06-07T20:22:00.000Z	sluxor		is it possible to load grub back into the MBR from windows?
2008-06-07T20:23:00.000Z	fsckd	sluxor	no but you can use a live cd to do it
2008-06-07T20:25:00.000Z	fsckd	sluxor	lol well I learned something new
