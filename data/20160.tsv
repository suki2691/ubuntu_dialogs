2011-01-18T11:54:00.000Z	Hi-TechHate		Just wondering if anyone can help. Recently installed ubuntu 10.10 and everything was working fine for a couple days now it seems whenever i run more then one app or sometime just firefox it just freezes up and i have to reboot.... there a bug fix or a update im missing?

2011-01-18T12:04:00.000Z	Hi-TechHate	smerz	thanks checked the update manager and its up-to-date i guess i will just keep a eye on what im doing everytime the mouse freezes and it locks-up and see if i can get it worked out then. Forums seem to be filled with the same problem just no solution.
