2012-02-29T00:10:00.000Z	Cognitive		Hi everyone. Trying to get compiz up and running on Xubuntu. I installed nvidia-current and it works fine (I get full resolution and everything) but whenever I run nvidia-xconfig and generate a xorg.conf the system crashes.
2012-02-29T00:11:00.000Z	Cognitive		does compiz force using xorg.conf?

2012-02-29T00:13:00.000Z	Cognitive	iceroot	well, it won't run giving me an error Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0" followed by Compiz (opengl) - Fatal: glXCreateContext failed
