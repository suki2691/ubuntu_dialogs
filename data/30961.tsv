2010-05-31T11:08:00.000Z	electrohouse	switchgirl	try gstreamer.. and all its plugins. it works fine with wma codecs
2010-05-31T11:10:00.000Z	electrohouse	switchgirl	the plugins arent there, because of licensing issues. i found out a bunch of them from from a ubuntu website..
2010-05-31T11:13:00.000Z	electrohouse	switchgirl	try sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
