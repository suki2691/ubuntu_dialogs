2011-02-24T13:19:00.000Z	coraxx	rww	ok then... here is another tiny challenge ... everything seems to work ..except there a a couple of places in the document where the string is not replaced ... I'm assuming its in all instances where the string occur more than one time in one line ...and only one replaced is done per line ...by default....<--- if that's true...how do I make it take all replacement into account ?
