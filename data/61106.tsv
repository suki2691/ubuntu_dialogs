2010-08-12T21:51:00.000Z	SomeoneE1se		I'm trying to ping a box on my local network via it's hostname, and every so often it just doesn't work any more.  Any thoughts on why localhost names will just stop working?
2010-08-12T21:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SomeoneE1se	  how is the network getting the hostnames? for my home lan of 3 pc's i edit their hosts file to define the host to ip mapping.
2010-08-12T21:52:00.000Z	SomeoneE1se	Dr_Willis	dhcp I'd assume
2010-08-12T21:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SomeoneE1se	 I dont think DHCP does that..   at least its Never done it for me.. (guess it could be my routers dhcp server limitions)
