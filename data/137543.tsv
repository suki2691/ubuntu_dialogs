2007-09-06T14:37:00.000Z	cineva		I can't save the modifications I've made to /etc/X11/xorg.conf. It says that I don't have permission. I am running a wubi installed version of ubuntu and it didn't asked or talled me anything about the root account. Is there a workaround?
2007-09-06T14:39:00.000Z	cineva		make what again?
2007-09-06T14:41:00.000Z	cineva		is there a default password for the root account?
2007-09-06T14:42:00.000Z	Doctor_Nick	cineva	you can change the root password by doing 'sudo passwd', but its not recommended
