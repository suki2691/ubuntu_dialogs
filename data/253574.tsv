2005-01-11T11:14:00.000Z	grumbel		after switching from debian unstable to ubuntu I seem to have some problems with the dns resolution, I know get more or less random 'can't resolve some_host', retrying again makes it work, config is the same as under debian, any idea what could be wrong?
2005-01-11T11:16:00.000Z	ohyeah2005	grumbel	not sure, but you could get rid of the ipv6 stuff and see if it gets any better
2005-01-11T11:17:00.000Z	grumbel	ohyeah2005	how can I get rid of it? rmmod, apt-get remove?
