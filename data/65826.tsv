2009-02-20T00:11:00.000Z	Nicador		Hello. I have an Ubuntu Server 8.10 Intrepid. I want to disable the feature that closes my monitor after a while of inactivity. I tried searching on the forums( http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1074563 ) and on Google, but with no luck. Can you please help me ?
