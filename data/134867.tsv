2007-10-19T18:32:00.000Z	Hewus		Could someone link me to a page listing the features / key-combos for the compiz effects? I've looked but can't find anything, surely it's out there somewhere!
2007-10-19T18:33:00.000Z	seamus7	Hewus	you need to install compizconfig-settings-manager ... it will be called Advanced Desktop Effects Settings in the System/Preferences menu
2007-10-19T18:35:00.000Z	seamus7	Hewus	within the Advanced Desktop Effects Settings window, eash feature of Compiz is listed ... go to its Actions tab for each feature and you will find the key bindings ... and you can change them or set mouse gestures and such
