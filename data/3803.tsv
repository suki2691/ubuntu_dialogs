2012-04-23T10:30:00.000Z	ioboku		hello guys, just a simpleton question: if I download and install the latest beta from the ubuntu website for 12.04, is it likely that I am to face upgrade problems to final?
2012-04-23T10:30:00.000Z	ioboku		don't have much time to do distro switching in the next few days :P
2012-04-23T10:30:00.000Z	fidel_	ioboku	maybe - but i guess not. apart from that #ubuntu+1 for 12.04 questions
