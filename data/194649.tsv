2006-05-25T15:43:00.000Z	DBO	xor_not_and	for the most part, newer kernel, newer modules, more packages...
2006-05-25T15:45:00.000Z	DBO	xor_not_and	no, dapper uses 2.16.15
2006-05-25T15:47:00.000Z	DBO	xor_not_and	ubuntu is on a 6 month release cycle, debian is on a geological release cycle... thats a good enough reason for lots of home users
