2008-11-17T04:31:00.000Z	kansascanuck		Hello all.  I've finally ditched windows for linux and I am using Ubuntu, but I have been having thought of moving to another distro.  I like Ubuntu, but I want to make sure I am using the best distro with the best support.  Can anyone talk me out of changing?
