2011-07-18T11:05:00.000Z	os_		Which port does Evolution mail use for sending mails via smtp.gmail.com by default?
2011-07-18T11:06:00.000Z	os_		Can someone please suggest how can I find the default port being used by Evolution for sending mails
2011-07-18T11:07:00.000Z	Dulak	os_	sending mail is port 25 or 587 for email
2011-07-18T11:09:00.000Z	Dulak	os_	outbound email is typically blocked by residential isps, I'm guessing it's maybe using port 80, but that's kinda weird
