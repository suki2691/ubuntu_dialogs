2010-10-27T02:41:00.000Z	MatBoy		what is the issue with a intel 5100 agn card ? It sees networks but cannot connect right because of the WPA key or whatever
2010-10-27T02:42:00.000Z	maco	MatBoy	wpa key shouldnt be related to hardware. thats the password you need to connect to that network. the owner has setup a password to encrypt the traffic
2010-10-27T02:43:00.000Z	MatBoy	maco	yes, but network-manager does not see networks with the card and wicd has password problems
