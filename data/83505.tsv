2008-08-14T05:29:00.000Z	qr_	bastid_raZor	no, I'm right.  adding him to the admin group is another way of doing it.
2008-08-14T05:31:00.000Z	qr_	bastid_raZor	why are you telling me this.  I think it would have been a lot more productive to tell _him_ this if you really feel this strongly about it.
2008-08-14T05:32:00.000Z	qr_	bastid_raZor	fair enough.  Either way, he's gone now, and did seem to know what vi was, so I think he'll be ok (or he'll be back, I guess).
