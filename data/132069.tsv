2007-06-04T13:56:00.000Z	zacs7		Hey all, i've got a few probs
2007-06-04T13:57:00.000Z	zacs7		I had to reinstall Windows, because I got a new CPU, MB, GFX card. Now windows has swipped the MBR, I can't boot into ubuntu, So I went to go and fix grub using the live CD. However: It doesn't work, the X-server fails to find my monitor. I have a 8600GT any suggestions?
