2009-05-09T08:19:00.000Z	mzz	garchotron	so far I'm wildly guessing dns issues
2009-05-09T08:20:00.000Z	mzz	garchotron	(I have no idea how pidgin connects, but if it happens to have a hardcoded master server ip or something it'd work in that case)
2009-05-09T08:20:00.000Z	mzz	garchotron	pointing him at me has the bonus that I'll see any malfunctioning proxy in my server log (as long as it still connects)
2009-05-09T08:21:00.000Z	mzz	garchotron	although in hindsight I shouldn't have mentioned the address in here, log's a bit noisy this way :)
