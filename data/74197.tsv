2009-07-08T18:25:00.000Z	tommck		Can anyone else explain to me why the new kernel support for the RocketRaid 1740 doesn't recognize an existing RAID-5 array defined with the open source drivers in the past?
2009-07-08T18:26:00.000Z	oskar-	tommck	 suggestion: it does not seem to be a real raid controller, so the raid format depends too much on the drivers
2009-07-08T18:28:00.000Z	tommck	oskar-	interesting.  So, the new kernel stuff would have chosen a different way to represent the RAID from the open source drivers written by HighPoint?
2009-07-08T18:29:00.000Z	oskar-	tommck	 yes, possible... if you see the single drives, you can perhaps fit them together with device-mapper and maybe get it compatible. but i have no clue how ;)
