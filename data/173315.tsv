2009-09-15T08:13:00.000Z	Oneshade		can anyone help me on a ubuntu server edition (already installed, and with a LAMP already on it) get it to connect to the internet? whenever I try to use the ping command on any outside adress it wont work. Im new to linux, and this is a fresh install so barely anything has been changed (except it has a static ip set up)

2009-09-15T08:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Oneshade	What kind of server are you doing?
