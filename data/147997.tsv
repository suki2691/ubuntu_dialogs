2007-01-24T07:23:00.000Z	coshx		i'm running off of the eft install cd. it sees my wireless card and loads the rt2500 module, but i'm not able to get an ip address when activating the card. can someone help me get this working?

2007-01-24T07:26:00.000Z	coshx	mzanfardino	it's wide open
2007-01-24T07:27:00.000Z	mzanfardino	coshx	ok.  just curious.  I haven't done wireless with linux yet, but I'm going to try soon... watch the thread, I think there is a wireless conversation going on now.
