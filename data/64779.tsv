2010-02-28T22:37:00.000Z	Promille		A little question. Would the speed be any different with transfering through sftp rather than ftpes?
2010-02-28T22:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Promille	i'm guessing there would be a small amount of overhead for encryption, doubt it would be noticeable.
2010-02-28T22:39:00.000Z	Promille	ZykoticK9	but ftpes uses the same encryption as sftp, doesnt it? is it "more" encryption at ssh2 level?
2010-02-28T22:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Promille	oh sorry, when i read it i assumed you just mean ftp - i don't even know what FTPes is.  Sorry i have no idea then.
