2011-05-17T10:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	pixxi451	You can download the iso separately and point wubi to it. Why are you using Wubi rather than doing a normal dual boot install?

2011-05-17T10:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	pixxi451	You're welcome. You still haven't answered why you want to use Wubi instead of a normal dual boot though...
