2010-03-03T15:36:00.000Z	c_nick		I installed Geany 0.18.1 on windows.. but it lags a lot i mean when u scroll down the image comes a little slowly
2010-03-03T15:36:00.000Z	meowbuntu	c_nick	this is not windows
2010-03-03T15:38:00.000Z	c_nick	meowbuntu	i know but i had to work on windows.. basically geany is a linux app.. and it works well for me in ubuntu
2010-03-03T15:39:00.000Z	meowbuntu	c_nick	go to #windows and ask them we provide help for #ubuntu only
