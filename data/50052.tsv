2010-05-15T01:20:00.000Z	deadpigeon		Since I upgraded to 10.04, I boot normally and keyboard input and mouse lock up after a few moments, soon after it completely freezes. Works out okay in recovery mode with failsafex.
2010-05-15T01:21:00.000Z	deadpigeon		What's the solution? Change my kernel?
2010-05-15T01:23:00.000Z	Serendippo	deadpigeon	i can't really help, but only say that I had the exact same problem when installing kubuntu 10.04. I started again installing ubuntu 10.04 & didn't have that problem anymore.
