2010-01-14T01:51:00.000Z	Hydrosis		Cany anyone tell me why all HD videos are choppy in Ubuntu but they play fine with the same hardware in Windows?  ALL HD vids are choppy on this machine, but the windows partition plays them flawlessly.  Why doesnt this work and how do I fix it?
2010-01-14T01:53:00.000Z	Hydrosis		Ubuntu is becvoming a joke to me.  So many problems that I never had with windows.  No sound via speakers from mic, cocputer goes to sleep and doesnt wake up (set to NOT sleep), no sound in games (especially when FireFox is open) etc.  Why was this version of Ubuntu even released when it has so many problems compraed to the competition?

2010-01-14T01:55:00.000Z	coz_	Hydrosis	 are you using the current version karmic?  if so you might want to use the previous version if that worked better and wait for ubuntu lucid to be released
