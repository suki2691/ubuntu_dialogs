2008-04-14T01:57:00.000Z	pcglue		I have a 400GB HD that's failing.  I want to copy the contents over to a 500GB HD so it's a duplicate.  Can I use dd even though the sizes are not the same?

2008-04-14T02:00:00.000Z	pcglue	stefg	 if I don't want to waste the space, will cp (making sure all permissions stay the same) work?
