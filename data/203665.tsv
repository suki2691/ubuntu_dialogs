2008-03-30T19:53:00.000Z	mgi	amenado	I'm just trying to get samba to talk nicely with PAM to authenticate users
2008-03-30T19:56:00.000Z	mgi	amenado	I just don't get how to do it - I've followed the samba docs suggestions, but they are pretty crappy.
2008-03-30T19:56:00.000Z	mgi	amenado	I just want to not bother with samba auth - can samba be pointed at PAM and forget about its internal db?
