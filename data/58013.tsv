2009-05-08T02:37:00.000Z	pepperjack	pronik`	id investigate turning off indexing maybe
2009-05-08T02:37:00.000Z	pronik`		it's happening every so often (four times this evening)
2009-05-08T02:38:00.000Z	pronik`	pepperjack	I doubt it's the indexing (it's disabled anyway AFAIK) since overloading would cause the beep to hang for example
