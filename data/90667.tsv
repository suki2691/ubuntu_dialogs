I have an idea. recently I realized that running my external hard drive to load my music from it was a bit of a pain. So I though of an Idea to sort of fix this issue, although I don't know much about programming. My idea is to take my 14 gigs of music and compress is into a very small format then have something like rhythmbox read it and play them as normal. My format would convert 14 gigs persay into 5

2008-08-22T04:59:00.000Z	mollusk	Odd-rationale	yeah but thats no fun. I am into innovation and revolutionary ideas such as my idea which so far I have not found to be true
