2007-09-11T15:02:00.000Z	Scunizi		How do I use wget with a variable to download several files ending in .gif?  I've tried "wget http://www.foo.bar/*.gif" with no success.

2007-09-11T15:04:00.000Z	Scunizi	kane77	unfortunatly I don't know the file names just that they end in .gif
2007-09-11T15:04:00.000Z	kane77	Scunizi	there is an option to recursively download... you can try the gwget (if you don't need it for some kind of script)
