2006-06-22T07:21:00.000Z	smtkr	thomas	I had the question about Serpentine not burning mp3s anymore. It turns out that on my breezy install I was using gstreamer0.8-lame. For dapper, I needed to install a package called gstreamer0.10-fluendo-mp3. I guess serpentine is using the newer version that can't utilize the .8 plugins. Thanks for the help.
