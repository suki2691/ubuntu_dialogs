2008-02-21T07:47:00.000Z	speeddemon8803		I have a question, isnt ubuntu supported for 5 years on the server side?
2008-02-21T07:48:00.000Z	Jangari	speeddemon8803	i think 6.06 is supported until '11
2008-02-21T07:58:00.000Z	speeddemon8803	Jangari	please dont do that in open, if you must "play" with the bot do it in private by typing /msg ubotu command :)
2008-02-21T07:59:00.000Z	speeddemon8803	Jangari	that way we have more room for support and not just users trying to figure out commands for ubotu :)
