2007-05-22T15:21:00.000Z	Burnwood		Hey.
2007-05-22T15:21:00.000Z	Burnwood		I'm on the Ubuntu livecd part. Can I install Ubuntu to an NTFS partition?
2007-05-22T15:22:00.000Z	Burnwood		I can? I've got an NTFS partition with 20GB free space, using the LiveCD can I cut 5GB out of it or so and format+dedicate that to Ubuntu?
