2005-09-10T09:55:00.000Z	kalias	chombee	have you dealt with vs .net 2003?  The darn thing didn't even install properly.
2005-09-10T09:56:00.000Z	chombee	kalias	- yeah I was a pro developer in vs .net 2003, and indeed it failed to install most times for most people while I worked with it, good luck, keep trying
