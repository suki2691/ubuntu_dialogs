2006-08-29T12:32:00.000Z	jbroome	farshim	check out launchpad and see if it has already been reported
2006-08-29T12:32:00.000Z	jbroome		!launchpad
2006-08-29T12:34:00.000Z	farshim	jbroome	This is quite a specific bug: the same compiled program works on Redhat Kernel 2.9.6 but Seg faults on ubunutu 2.6.15
