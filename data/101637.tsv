2008-01-31T20:04:00.000Z	STM		hi all, could someone explain why accessing my samba shares on a windows computer results in a request for a username and password?
2008-01-31T20:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	STM	becouse windows is not that insecure after all
2008-01-31T20:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	STM	you have to provide your windows username and pass iirc
2008-01-31T20:06:00.000Z	STM	erUSUL	windows user and pass does not work either
