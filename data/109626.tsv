2008-01-08T20:28:00.000Z	AJC_Z0		In the default gnome/compiz environment, how to I get windows to stack from right to left instead of the default left to right?
2008-01-08T20:29:00.000Z	pike_	AJC_Z0	might be a setting in the compiz config manager or whatever its called
2008-01-08T20:29:00.000Z	pike_	AJC_Z0	that isnt installed by default
2008-01-08T20:29:00.000Z	AJC_Z0	pike_	Thanks
