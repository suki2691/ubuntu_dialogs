2007-12-14T20:29:00.000Z	ip_helper		I have a laptop with 160G drive, I just attached a 160G USB drive, qparted only shows /dev/sdb, is that the USB one?
2007-12-14T20:30:00.000Z	sn0	ip_helper	you can type sudo fdisk -l at the terminal to list partitions
2007-12-14T20:31:00.000Z	sn0		this will also show the sizes of the partitions
