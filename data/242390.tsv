I have a headless server with no video that i need an OS on.. does anybody know of a distro that can be install and accessed remotely with no video.. i understand ill have to PXE boot but the remote desktop or ssh thing is whats stopping me
2012-10-23T21:21:00.000Z	fr05tbyt3		right but ill have to ssh to myself to create the key which i cannot do easily with no video on the machine
