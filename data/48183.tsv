2012-06-20T05:51:00.000Z	vjacob		hiya. any idea how I can achieve the same end result more or less as http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-desktop-74/howto-install-mate-on-ubuntu-12-04-with-no-other-desktop-environments-942438/ without having to reinstall using the netinstall image?
2012-06-20T05:51:00.000Z	vjacob		i.e. how does one simply _remove_ packages until only MATE is installed?
2012-06-20T05:52:00.000Z	OerHeks	vjacob	mate is not supported here.
