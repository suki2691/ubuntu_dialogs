2009-12-26T20:27:00.000Z	andyl		is there any problem in doing linux development in a linux virtual machine instead of on the bare system
2009-12-26T20:28:00.000Z	Slart	andyl	I think the virtual systems have some slightly special hardware
2009-12-26T20:28:00.000Z	Slart	andyl	but for general stuff I don't think it will be a problem.. you might want to be prepared for a bit more diversity when it has to run on real systems
