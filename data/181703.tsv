2007-03-01T10:46:00.000Z	eck	alex_mayorga	ifconfig, route and the /etc files
2007-03-01T10:51:00.000Z	alex_mayorga	eck	can you elaborate a bit please, total n00b here
2007-03-01T10:53:00.000Z	eck	alex_mayorga	you can change all of the interface settings with ifconfig, and all the DNS stuff with route
