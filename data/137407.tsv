2008-12-31T00:46:00.000Z	hak5fan	zelda	so it works now?
2008-12-31T00:47:00.000Z	zelda		Hak5Fan: yeah mines working fine. Its that autoconfigure crap. Tell him to disable that feature and try to dkpg in 8.10. if not throw in a live 7.10 disk and dpkg command, then copy and paste that in teh 8.10 xorg.
2008-12-31T00:48:00.000Z	zelda	hak5fan	yeah thats his problem.
