2007-07-24T09:37:00.000Z	needhelp		Hi, I'm just trying to install Ubuntu 704 with dualboot for WinXP. I have some problems I dont know what to do about. If anyone please can check here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31109/ and tell me what I'm doing wrong ?

2007-07-24T09:40:00.000Z	needhelp	jhaig	If you saw the link, the reason for not having sda (the SCSI disk) the first in boot sequence, is that then Windows XP loads, and I cant enter ubuntu
