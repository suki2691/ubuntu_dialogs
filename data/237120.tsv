2005-05-19T10:24:00.000Z	ih8evil		I'm attempting to install sidenet, and it says it's simulating a reboot, and I keep getting new windows titled "Start Menu Shortcuts" that never respond. The install seems to not be progressing any. Anyone have any advise?

2005-05-19T10:25:00.000Z	bob2	ih8evil	do you mean "I'm trying to install sidenet using wine..."?
2005-05-19T10:25:00.000Z	ih8evil	bob2	yes, exactly
