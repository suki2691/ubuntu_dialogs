Probably not the right forum, but any advice welcome (btw, ubuntu runs fine!). Grub menu comes up, but when I select the Vista option, I get the microsoft progress bar which just goes on and on.
2007-04-06T09:30:00.000Z	Pelo	denys	  check the forum,  I know there is an issue with grub booting vista,   you should be able to find a fix in there
2007-04-06T09:34:00.000Z	Pelo	denys	  is your windows install on a diferent drive ?
