2010-02-06T10:33:00.000Z	Gryllida		I know Ubuntu 10.4 will come on April 29th. It is going to be Long-Term-Support. Should I wait for it? Or should I install 9.10 Short-Term-Support and than update to 10.4 L-T-S later? When updating, will I have to install my favorite applications (LyX, for example) from scratch?
