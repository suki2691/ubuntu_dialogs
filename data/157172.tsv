2007-10-10T10:01:00.000Z	valehru		Meh, I updated to gutsy for one package only, it got a few extra dependancies.  Now I reverted back to Fiesty and I am getting the following error trying to install php5-dev: php5-dev: Depends: libssl-dev but it is not going to be installed

2007-10-10T10:02:00.000Z	valehru	MasterShrek	should I just upgrade for the hell of it?
2007-10-10T10:02:00.000Z	MasterShrek	valehru	yea i would, im running gutsy right now just fine
