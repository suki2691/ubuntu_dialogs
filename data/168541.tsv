2006-10-04T14:19:00.000Z	jiphex	edgy	i know its something to do with usb, i guess its more specifically to do with kb/mouse as its a hid error
2006-10-04T14:25:00.000Z	edgy	jiphex	my guess is either a kernel problem ( and you can try to an old kernel) or a really defective usb port
2006-10-04T14:27:00.000Z	jiphex	edgy	yeah, i guess i'll try that, have to wait till im actually at the computer (ssh'ing at the moment). I dont like rebooting remotely ;-)
