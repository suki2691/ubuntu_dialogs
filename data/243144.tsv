2007-12-05T04:28:00.000Z	NightKnight		I mounted a Secondary Drive (Shared Between Linux and Windows) and when I explore it I see folders (System Folders) like "RECYCLER" and "System Volume Information" which don't show up on Windows. Is there any way to "Hide" those 2 folders under Linux?

2007-12-05T04:32:00.000Z	mdmcginn	NightKnight	no, I guess not. I had a extra Dell partition that was mounting.
