2006-01-28T12:17:00.000Z	folki		 Can anybody give me advice please...What codecs (or libraries) I need to install if I want to play video (.avi) but I can only listen music but I can not see that?
2006-01-28T12:19:00.000Z	folki		I have installed w32codecs...majority of videos I can play but I have one film, which I can not
2006-01-28T12:19:00.000Z	tristanmike	folki	you may be out of luck, have you tried vlc?
2006-01-28T12:21:00.000Z	tristanmike	folki	yeah, but the .avi was made with a particular codec, and it's that codec you're shooting for
