2009-12-31T04:08:00.000Z	jellow	David2311	install vnc server on window 7 and use a vnc client on ubuntu
2009-12-31T04:09:00.000Z	David2311	jellow	is this the only way?
2009-12-31T04:10:00.000Z	jellow	David2311	I think windows has its own remote "help" , though i have no idea how to access it on ubuntu
