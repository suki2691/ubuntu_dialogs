2007-04-29T10:24:00.000Z	vox754	jk-home	jaiii, I would use Knoppix because it is also Linux, a Debian based Linux, so you may test your hardware first with it.
2007-04-29T10:26:00.000Z	jk-home	vox754	fyi, the very same is true of gparted live (it's linux)   and all you want to do is set partitions so you don't need all the extra stuff to load
2007-04-29T10:27:00.000Z	vox754	jk-home	okay, I've never tried Gparted CD since Knoppix and Ubuntu Cds work okay, but yeah, I may download it
