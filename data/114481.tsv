2007-11-02T19:47:00.000Z	cinch		Hi - I went through the BinaryDriverHowto and it says I should have 3D support on my Radeon Mobility 7500 but I can't get Desktop Effects to work.
2007-11-02T19:47:00.000Z	LjL	cinch	having 3D support doesn't imply that Desktop Effects are supported
2007-11-02T19:48:00.000Z	cinch	LjL	- How do I tell if they're supported?
2007-11-02T19:49:00.000Z	LjL	cinch	that's a good question, i don't know where to find a list
