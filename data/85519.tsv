2008-08-21T00:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Candale	slow reverse name resolution ?
2008-08-21T00:20:00.000Z	Candale	ikonia	 no,  when i browse to a server it takes forever for the folders to populate. it hangs up everything on my computer
2008-08-21T00:21:00.000Z	Candale	ikonia	 if i need to browse the network to add an attachement or something through evolution the speed is great
