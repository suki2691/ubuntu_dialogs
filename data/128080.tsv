2010-11-09T08:41:00.000Z	Tetracomm		Does anyone know anything about recovering files after a partition table is corrupt?
2010-11-09T08:42:00.000Z	mbeierl	Tetracomm	there were some programs I used a few years back (something like photo recover?) which would scan the raw data of the disk for specific jpeg/png/etc formats and attempt to recover data that way
