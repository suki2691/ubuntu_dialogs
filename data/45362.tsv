2009-12-02T01:36:00.000Z	jcrawford		alright enough from me i have to get back to work :)
2009-12-02T01:37:00.000Z	jcrawford		oh and cookie, milk and hug is OT?
2009-12-02T01:37:00.000Z	mMezquitale	jcrawford	what's so wrong with a hug from a guy or gal?  As long as no kissing is involved, in my culture hugging is acceptable social behavior
