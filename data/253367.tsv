2007-03-13T05:58:00.000Z	padan		I am trying to compile the new evolution and it wants libgtkhtml-3.14 ... however I can't seem to locate this package anywhere
2007-03-13T05:59:00.000Z	padan		it seems that ubuntu comes with 3.12
2007-03-13T05:59:00.000Z	padan		but I can't even find a place to dl the 3.14 version
2007-03-13T05:59:00.000Z	poningru	padan	pretty sure its in feisty
