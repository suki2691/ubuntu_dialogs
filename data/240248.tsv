2007-12-26T10:23:00.000Z	nickrud	American-Tech	what video card do you have
2007-12-26T10:24:00.000Z	nickrud	American-Tech	  applications->accessories->terminal , type in there:  lspci | grep -i vga, it'll tell you in detail
2007-12-26T10:28:00.000Z	nickrud	American-Tech	system->admin->restricted drivers, enable the nvidia one, and reboot. You should get better video support.
