2011-02-23T02:09:00.000Z	Citizenwarrior		is anyone who is knowledgeable about the differences between Ubuntu 32 and 64 bit willing to join me in a privet chat, I have Dell on another chat and I am trying to work out some hardware configurations on a system I am trying to order
2011-02-23T02:11:00.000Z	Citizenwarrior		ubuntu 64 the .iso is something something 'amd64' does that denote that it is AMD processors only and not any intel?
2011-02-23T02:12:00.000Z	Citizenwarrior		so a duel Intel xeon E5405 system should handle Ubuntu 64 just fine?
2011-02-23T02:12:00.000Z	Logan_WP	Citizenwarrior	yes, definitely
