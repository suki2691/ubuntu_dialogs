2010-05-04T05:36:00.000Z	Loshki	j800r	it's only been out a couple of days. Come back in a month...
2010-05-04T05:37:00.000Z	j800r	Loshki	lol. i'm just surprised at the huge volume of people with issues. it's working fine for me. juast as good as 9.10, in fact, better
2010-05-04T05:38:00.000Z	Loshki	j800r	me too, but actually I think 10.04 has had fewer problems than the 9.X releases, and in a few months I hope it will be as stable as 8.04
