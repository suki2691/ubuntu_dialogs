I've now set up a number of *fresh* 12.04 desktops from mini ISO, and consistently there are little crashes all aver the place. I'm now prepping a new box to a potential recruit, and wondering they they won't be better of with the W7 who's licence is slapped on the side

2012-08-21T12:48:00.000Z	kieppie	auronandace	I've tried it with the new Gnome shell, and although it's actually better, is simply not good enough. This is supposed to be an LTS, and upgrading to the next minor release as a way to fix what broken now is a terrible cop-out, I'm sorry to say
