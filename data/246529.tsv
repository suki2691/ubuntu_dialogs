2005-03-16T08:04:00.000Z	hoinar		i have a question: why don't I see my NTFS partitions under ubuntu live cd?
2005-03-16T08:05:00.000Z	monoxide_	hoinar	linux doesnt support NTFS
2005-03-16T08:07:00.000Z	monoxide_	hoinar	then the live cd doesnt have the packages on it for that. no idea what that package is tho.
