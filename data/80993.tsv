2008-10-01T12:18:00.000Z	Atax		Hi all, im trying to install Nvidia-Drivers and have to exit x-windows first. How do I exist x-windows in Ubuntu?
2008-10-01T12:19:00.000Z	Mordocai	Atax	Well, either log out or reboot.
2008-10-01T12:20:00.000Z	Mordocai	Atax	Oh, i was thinking you need to resart x. You can also change run levels...
2008-10-01T12:21:00.000Z	Mordocai	Atax	well, if all else fails, you can go into the configuration and change the default run level to 3, instead of 5, then reboot...
