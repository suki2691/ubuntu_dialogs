2010-04-30T00:58:00.000Z	dugger5688		Several kernel updates are being held back by nvidia? Normal?
2010-04-30T00:59:00.000Z	darolu	dugger5688	install them manually via Synaptic
2010-04-30T01:00:00.000Z	dugger5688	darolu	Are they being held back because the new drivers aren't compiled for the kernel?
2010-04-30T01:01:00.000Z	darolu	dugger5688	that's a possibility, I don't know of a certain way to find the exact reason; other reasons include them (the updates) not being in Main repositories
