2006-11-19T13:52:00.000Z	rioghal	JeffBell	i had my doubts about gimp until i found those two sites  those sites have helped me do tons of stuff in the gimp
2006-11-19T13:53:00.000Z	JeffBell	rioghal	I will go through them, but I am highly skeptical.  There is no doubt that the GIMP has many powerful tools.  But I balk at the prospect of serious work. =]
