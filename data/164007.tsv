2007-08-18T10:07:00.000Z	Alethes		anybody know if there's a good way to determine all that files in /etc that I've changed from the installed defaults?  I want to back just these up.
2007-08-18T10:09:00.000Z	bulmer	Alethes	a lesson learned..back up config files before modifying...anyhow you may as well re-install
2007-08-18T10:10:00.000Z	Alethes	bulmer	I'm not having any problems.  I just want a list of all the files I've modified
2007-08-18T10:10:00.000Z	bulmer	Alethes	 look at your history, you may be able to garner which files you touched
