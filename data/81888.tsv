2012-10-28T09:30:00.000Z	Izinucs	ix_	you can.. what are you looking for?
2012-10-28T09:31:00.000Z	ix_	Izinucs	that's not quite true, if you try to install gimp 2.8 on ubuntu 10.04, I'm pretty sure it will not work
2012-10-28T09:33:00.000Z	Izinucs	ix_	you have a couple of ways.  First is to compile it yourself making a .deb to install or google for "gimp PPA".  PPA's are unsupported program space where someone else has compiled the program for specific versions of ubuntu.. the ppa is installed as part of your package manager and the program(s) in it are then available through the normal package manager.
