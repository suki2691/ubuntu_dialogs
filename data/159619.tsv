It gives a real good indicator on the health of the drive as well.  I have ruled out hard drive problems that were actually controller problems using it as well.  It is pricey at $90, but when it works, it is worth it.  If it doesn't help, they have a 100% money back guarantee, I think.
2006-11-10T11:40:00.000Z	Vuen	lnxactvst	i'm not interested in recovering the data. i just erased the partition table :p. i just want to check the drive for defects to see if it's useable.
2006-11-10T11:41:00.000Z	lnxactvst	Vuen	I know.  It does that as well, somewhat definitively.
