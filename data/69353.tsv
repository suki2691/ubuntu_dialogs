2009-01-16T13:12:00.000Z	Zero_FeniX		I'm trying to install ubuntu with VirtualBox on a windows machine just to play around with. I got it all set up and it loads the image just fine but when I try to install, try it, or check to see if the download was good it just freezes and doesn't do anything. Any suggestions. I've tried both the 32 and 64 bit versions and there are no other virtual machines using the same disk image.

2009-01-16T13:13:00.000Z	Zero_FeniX	tritium	I'm using 8.10
2009-01-16T13:14:00.000Z	tritium	Zero_FeniX	just checking, as the release notes state that the kernel used in the jaunty alphas won't boot as a virtualbox guest
