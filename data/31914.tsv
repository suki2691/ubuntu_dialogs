In the worst case, you could use partimage to get the unencrypted partition into an image file on an external HD, then reformat the whole drive, and retreive the backup. partimgage doesnt work with ext4 apparently, in this case you can use any similar method like dd and tar or whatever

2010-05-14T16:09:00.000Z	Str82DHeaD	hmw	OK but I think that the problem is somewhere in mdadm...
