2007-09-14T16:41:00.000Z	walkover		Hey! i have kubuntu nicely set up on my mashine. But i wonder if there is an easy way to compile all the whole lot for my particular mashine. something like "apt-get everything i already have, compile, and install it" does anyone know?
2007-09-14T16:43:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	walkover	any reason the interest in compiling everything?
2007-09-14T16:43:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	walkover	just to see if there was a command to do it or see how long it takes or what?
