2007-05-31T05:09:00.000Z	jrib	Watcher_	format the partition it's on to uninstall ubuntu
2007-05-31T05:10:00.000Z	Watcher_	jrib	but if i reinstall the ubuntu, the installer will have to do the partition process again, or it will push ubuntu towards the EXT3 partitioned disk automatically?
2007-05-31T05:10:00.000Z	jrib	Watcher_	not sure, it should explain what it wants to do though
