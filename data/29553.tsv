2010-07-22T01:05:00.000Z	_jesse_		hey all, my netbook likes to randomly crash (just completely shuts off w/o warning) this usually coincides with me pressing a button on the keyboard, where could I start looking to debug this?
2010-07-22T01:05:00.000Z	_jesse_		nothing suspicious is in /var/logs/syslog

2010-07-22T01:07:00.000Z	_jesse_	racethesunlive	yeah 58 degrees, it's never when I'm doing anything intensive, but it's always when I'm in the middle of typing
