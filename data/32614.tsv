2010-05-05T06:33:00.000Z	Silly		I have a desktop machine with a wireless card. I generally don't have a monitor attached and access this machine through ssh. I want this machine to conect to my appartments wifi internet service automatically.  I can't seem to figure out how to keep the wireless card connected to the network and ignore all other wifi networks.
2010-05-05T06:33:00.000Z	Silly		Every 10 minutes or so the card seems to disconnect (and the network leaves the little menu in network manager) and I have to tell it to reconnect to a hiden network with the wifi network name to get it to reconnect. I have tried setting the allow this network to be accessed from all users but it didn't seem to have any effect that I could see. What should I do?
