2005-02-17T16:24:00.000Z	Phr0stByte		I have just connected through a router and now my speed is much slower - any ideas here anyone?
2005-02-17T16:24:00.000Z	|QuaD-_	Phr0stByte	are other comps on the router?
2005-02-17T16:26:00.000Z	Phr0stByte	|QuaD-_	Yes 1 - But my speed is slow even when mine is the only one on.
