2011-12-25T20:00:00.000Z	jollymac		i'm trying to install ubuntu on a 320gb hd that already has a 100mb and a 50gb partion for windows 7.. but gparted shows it as a whole free space .. no solutions I found in google applied to my case (cant use partition magic on win7) .. anyone ever had that problem?
