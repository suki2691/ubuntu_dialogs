2005-06-22T11:57:00.000Z	vol0za		Hello, I have a problem relative to the font rendering in gnome under Hoary. I'm trying to use the Sans font but some characters with diacritics (czech) are taken from a different font - Nimbus Sans L. Text with mixed characters looks really ugly. This problem occurs in all gnome-applications I have tested. Can you direct me to some solution? plz
