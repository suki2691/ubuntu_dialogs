2008-11-21T02:22:00.000Z	JoeDaMac		Is there a way to change resolutions, blindly, in Ubuntu? My display is out of range when I try to use the LiveCD or the alternate install.

2008-11-21T02:31:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	JoeDaMac	maybe you can switch to the text console using ctrl+alt+f1. it works on PC like machines.. dont know about macs
