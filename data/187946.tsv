2006-06-10T08:12:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser		i want to ask why a package was removed from ubuntu, where would i look for that info?
2006-06-10T08:14:00.000Z	rpedro	Kamping_Kaiser	if it's part of MOTU try searching http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages, it may have been removed in debian and hence universe
2006-06-10T08:15:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	rpedro	hte package i'm talking about is 'xmail', its not in the default install anymore, but it is part of the distro
2006-06-10T08:15:00.000Z	rpedro	Kamping_Kaiser	then maybe launchpad.net may have something, but I'm not sure, sorry
