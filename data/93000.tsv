2009-11-14T05:34:00.000Z	tommynz1975		ok shu.  when  you put the wirelss adapter into this other pc, what comes up when you put into the terminal iwconfig

2009-11-14T05:37:00.000Z	tommynz1975	leftyfb	 yes you are right....  or  shu short option is take the pc downstairs and hard wire it to the router. and plug the wirless in.  Has shu said whats running on the other pc?
