2006-01-16T16:26:00.000Z	martinex		short question - how to _downgrade_ from dapper to breezy?
2006-01-16T16:27:00.000Z	robotgeek	martinex	that will be a good experiment, lol
2006-01-16T16:31:00.000Z	martinex	robotgeek	unfortunately there's nothing funny - I have to downgrade because dapper is broken - I lost access to internet - it hangs on "detecting hardware' and doesn't install NIC's drivers
