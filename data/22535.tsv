2010-12-26T05:21:00.000Z	Doinkle	magicianlord	i just spent 3 months running 64bit 10.04.  I found it to buggy for me.  I went back to 32bit and it is much more stable for me.  I have 8Gb RAM but PAE works fine for me.  Your mileage may vary.
2010-12-26T05:21:00.000Z	magicianlord		why not
2010-12-26T05:22:00.000Z	magicianlord	Doinkle	thanks
2010-12-26T05:22:00.000Z	magicianlord	Doinkle	should i stick with 1 partition, or reinstall with separate boot /home and / partitions?
