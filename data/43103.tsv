2009-11-10T19:26:00.000Z	mahngiel	zaoul	just burn under data dvd/cd
2009-11-10T19:26:00.000Z	mahngiel		zaul: if you want an image burned to be executable, then you burn the iso to disk. not the same as putting it on the disk as traditional data
2009-11-10T19:27:00.000Z	zaoul	mahngiel	I want to rip, and no its not bootlegg, it's a previously created dvd
