2012-07-03T18:14:00.000Z	samba35	glitsj16	is 2d and 3d use same hardware or 3d require better hardware
2012-07-03T18:17:00.000Z	glitsj16	samba35	if it states "Unity 3D supported' it should work on present hardware .. might be something else causing the issue .. have you checked /var/log/Xorg.0.log for errors/warnings ?
