2011-01-03T17:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	akash6190	 how have you tested the webcam so far?
2011-01-03T17:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	akash6190	 how have you even tried to use it on linux? you tried it in the program 'cheese' yet?
2011-01-03T17:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	akash6190	 it may be its not supported if cheese dont see it. You coudl try the next alpha relase of ubuntu and see if it works in that.
