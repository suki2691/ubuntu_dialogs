2009-08-05T19:18:00.000Z	foormea		my current hardware clock is set to local time. i want to change it to UTC and have my system adjust my local time to my timezone. do you know how to do that? i'm only finding info dating back from 2007 on the internet...

2009-08-05T19:19:00.000Z	foormea	Syka	oh hahaha you know what... i'm such an idiot.. i was looking for the file they talk about, /etc/default/rcS in another distro...
