2008-05-28T14:59:00.000Z	Mat1		hi, just looking for someone who might be able to help me out with a usb/permissions problem since upgrading to 8.04
2008-05-28T15:01:00.000Z	Mat1		recently installed hardy, ever since my usb devices are not automounting. some of them appear to be in the computer menu, but when you try to open them it says "you do not have permission to mount this drive"

2008-05-28T15:03:00.000Z	Yachaziel	Mat1	Huh, that's odd.
