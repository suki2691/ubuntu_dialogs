2006-07-25T06:55:00.000Z	_stev_		how do I get my total used size of all partions together?
2006-07-25T06:56:00.000Z	Whatsisname	_stev_	you could probably write a simple perl script to calculate that
2006-07-25T07:02:00.000Z	_stev_	Whatsisname	ah ok , df -h doesn't give me the total used off all partitions, I just thought that there was an option that slipped my mind
2006-07-25T07:02:00.000Z	Whatsisname	_stev_	I don't think there is
