2007-03-03T10:52:00.000Z	dignick	eobanb	i meant super grub disk.  i can't boot the live cd, easily anyway.I'm just looking for a command to install grub to the mbr - presumably its the setup command?
2007-03-03T11:05:00.000Z	dignick	eobanb	i've looked there.  there is nothing I can see relating to the errors I am getting.
