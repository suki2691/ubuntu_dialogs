2011-05-10T08:20:00.000Z	ohelig		since updating to 11.04, i haven't been able to start firefox without it using 100% of a core and never starting. I decided to use the -jsconsole option with firefox, and it turns out that I'm missing a chrome.manifest file

2011-05-10T08:23:00.000Z	PalinBachman2012	ohelig	yes, it would be in your users folder
