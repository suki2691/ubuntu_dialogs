2010-10-13T02:49:00.000Z	aloon		howdy , long time linux user here in a bad way with Sony Vaio and Nvidia 330M card. Took a while under lucid to get things right , now no matter what I do I cannot install the Nvidia after the 10.10 upgrade
2010-10-13T02:50:00.000Z	aloon		I've tried nvidia-current after purging all nvidia from root shell , and Jockey does not see any Nvidia drivers , also I tried installing from the nvidia site but it gave kernel errors
2010-10-13T02:51:00.000Z	aloon		anyone have a good link for installing nvidia drivers under 10.10 ? I'm having a hell of a time
2010-10-13T02:51:00.000Z	talntid	aloon	what card?
