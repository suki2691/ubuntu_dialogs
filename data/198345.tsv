2007-04-21T08:01:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	axiom	that means the next version after feisty ???
2007-04-21T08:02:00.000Z	axiom	wickedpuppy	i'm just not sure if it means the next major release or something less major. as it is, my system will not update to feisty because i don't have 50MB of free space on my /boot partition (only 40MB)
2007-04-21T08:03:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	axiom	i don't remember ubuntu having a minor release between major releases .. whats the minor release between dapper and edgy ??
