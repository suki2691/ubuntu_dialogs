Last night my buddy linked me to a hilarious animated .gif file that was hosted on some stupid Geocities or similar site, but now when I try to load that page the hoster says the person has exceeded their daily bandwidth, therefore I cannot view it..  Is this .gif saved in my cache anywhere or anything like that?  Is there any way I can find this picture?
