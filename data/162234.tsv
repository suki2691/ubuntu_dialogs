2006-10-28T16:59:00.000Z	Knova		ok, well maybe someone can help me with this one. I just installed my wireless card, on 6.06 using the second method here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/NetgearWG111                           And it seemed to go fine, ndiswrapper states that the device is in and working properly, though it is not connected to my network... is there anyway i can connect it to my network via the terminal? thank you very much
