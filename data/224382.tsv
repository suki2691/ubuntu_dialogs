2005-08-12T07:33:00.000Z	pfp	soaz	at least with 'qtconfig' and 'kcontrol' but i dunno how much kde dependencies they have
2005-08-12T07:35:00.000Z	soaz	pfp	thank you for the tip. i'll try ..
2005-08-12T07:47:00.000Z	soaz	pfp	qtconfig helped with the font size. and does not depend on anything beside libqt. now if i find out, how to apply qt themes without kde that would be great. but i think that will not be possible without kcontrol. but anyway the fonts are set. THANKS!
