2008-03-30T06:28:00.000Z	geirha	symptom	shipit.ubuntu.com ... not sure when they'll be available for pre-order. I ordered gutsy CDs a week or so before its release
2008-03-30T06:29:00.000Z	symptom	geirha	thats the site I was looking at... youre saying they should be up there soon?
2008-03-30T06:31:00.000Z	geirha	symptom	I'm not saying they will, I'm just saying they were available a week or so before the previous release, so it's probable that the same holds for hardy
