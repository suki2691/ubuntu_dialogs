2010-11-09T00:44:00.000Z	mngrif		how do i change runlevels?
2010-11-09T00:46:00.000Z	mngrif		need to drop to single user so i can add a drive to my raid, 'init 1' doesn't work as expected...
2010-11-09T00:47:00.000Z	mngrif		i should hope that the provided mechanism to change runlevels, you know, actually changes runlevels...
