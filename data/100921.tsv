2009-10-04T22:54:00.000Z	ubuntuz45		hey all, i was just wondering if anyone has knowledge of triple boot systems and boot managers that could help me out.
2009-10-04T22:55:00.000Z	ubuntuz45		right now, i'm using the Win 7 boot manager
2009-10-04T22:55:00.000Z	ubuntuz45		if I happen to upgrade 7.10 to 8.04 using the update manager, will it overwrite the win boot manager?
