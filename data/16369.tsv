2011-06-07T12:53:00.000Z	tlhonmey	nopf	There's a program in the repository called swapd that will create swapfiles on the fly when needed.
2011-06-07T13:00:00.000Z	nopf	tlhonmey	hm, yes, thanks for that hint. since i found only much swap keeps firefox from crashing
2011-06-07T13:01:00.000Z	tlhonmey	nopf	No problem.  I use it quite a bit on thumb-drive installs where you don't really want to use swap unless absolutely necessary.
