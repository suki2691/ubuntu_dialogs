2009-01-17T13:14:00.000Z	Flynsarmy		Is there any diff between the open source and proprietry nvidia driver? Is one better than the other?
2009-01-17T13:15:00.000Z	Robert_Surcouf	Flynsarmy	the version available on synaptic are usually good
2009-01-17T13:16:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Robert_Surcouf	if the proprietry one is working fine for me, would it be worth upgrading to an open source one? I wouldn't mind being able to play videos on my laptop without 100% cpu
2009-01-17T13:18:00.000Z	Robert_Surcouf	Flynsarmy	never tried the open source one like nouveau
