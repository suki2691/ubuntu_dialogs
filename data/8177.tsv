2011-11-01T08:49:00.000Z	zykotick9	ScottE	actually - that's the output i get with top (not using ubuntu though)
2011-11-01T08:49:00.000Z	ScottE	zykotick9	but everything wanted there is available via uptime
2011-11-01T08:50:00.000Z	zykotick9	ScottE	i agree, and lvidal already knows about uptime
2011-11-01T08:50:00.000Z	ScottE	zykotick9	sure, just trying to help lvidal if the uptime info is what was wanted
