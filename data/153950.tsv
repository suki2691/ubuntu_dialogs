2006-12-20T10:08:00.000Z	cmiuc007		hello I am trying to install another distro along with ubuntu and win xp...what changes do i need to do in grub and how should I partition the drives?
2006-12-20T10:09:00.000Z	mebaran151	cmiuc007	they can share swap and maybe even the home partition
2006-12-20T10:09:00.000Z	mebaran151		though the home partition might result in oddness
2006-12-20T10:10:00.000Z	cmiuc007	mebaran151	my second distro is going to be Opensuse how can I make it share swap, but I am definitely going to do a differnt partition for suse
