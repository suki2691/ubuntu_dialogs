2007-06-27T11:29:00.000Z	wols	hellslinger	linux-image
2007-06-27T11:35:00.000Z	hellslinger	wols	linux image doesn't appear to have the kernel source code in it, is there any other way to get ubuntu kernel source?
2007-06-27T11:35:00.000Z	wols	hellslinger	I told you.apt-get source linux-image... doesn't give you anything?
