2009-01-02T08:03:00.000Z	mizery		A friend of mine just installed Ubuntu on their computer.  Their keyboard used in X as well as at terminal/console is strange.  I'm trying to figure out how to fix it.  they have a standard QWERTY keyboard but the following keys result: Pushing "q" shows 5, "w" shows 6, "e" shows q, "r" shows ., "t" shows o and "y" shows r.  I'm not sure what layout is being used or if it's a standard layout.  How can I find out how to change the keyboard
