2011-01-14T08:13:00.000Z	JasonSN		What do I need to change to allow git to work?  Would messing stuff in the passwd file mess it up?
2011-01-14T08:14:00.000Z	jrib	JasonSN	huh?  git works as soon as you install it...
2011-01-14T08:14:00.000Z	jrib	JasonSN	then you need to be more specific about what your issue is
2011-01-14T08:15:00.000Z	jrib	JasonSN	modify /how/?  How are you trying to make it work?  What exactly are you executing?  What exactly is the output? (use a pastebin and answer all questions)
