2008-04-05T01:12:00.000Z	unop__	Peddy	what the exact NT_STATUS message?
2008-04-05T01:15:00.000Z	unop__	Peddy	i'd be inclined to say that a firewall is the cause of the problem here
2008-04-07T12:36:00.000Z	unop__	Peddy	looks like that windows just has it's "window decorations" removed .. I dont use gnome so i cant say where this is .. but have a look in tht' window's menu (right click title bar) or in the terminal's options
2008-04-07T12:37:00.000Z	Peddy	unop__	isn't it pointing out from the dock, though? I'm pretty sure its connected to it
