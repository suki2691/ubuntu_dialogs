2006-10-22T14:54:00.000Z	philipsmith		I just upgraded to 3Mip internet service. My pages load really slowly with Ubuntu, but very quickly with XP. I "tuned" Firefox to work faster. What else can I do to load web pages faster?
2006-10-22T14:56:00.000Z	philipsmith		Sorry for asking again: I just upgraded to 3Mip internet service. My pages load really slowly with Ubuntu, but very quickly with XP. I "tuned" Firefox to work faster. What else can I do to load web pages faster?
2006-10-22T14:56:00.000Z	FuzzyBear	philipsmith	: are you using the same nameservers?
2006-10-22T14:57:00.000Z	FuzzyBear	philipsmith	: and do the pages load faster with another browser like opera?
