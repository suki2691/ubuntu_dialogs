2011-06-26T20:28:00.000Z	leafpile		I'm currently on an LTS release.  If I were to install Natty, could I resume sticking with LTS releases after the next one is released?
2011-06-26T20:30:00.000Z	BluesKaj	leafpile	you would have to upgrade twicew , whereas if you stick with the presnt LTS , then next april you upgrade directly to the the 12.04 LTS
2011-06-26T20:31:00.000Z	leafpile	BluesKaj	but if i install natty, i would only have to stick with 12.04 LTS (once I upgrade to it) in order to be back on the "LTS path", correct?
2011-06-26T20:34:00.000Z	BluesKaj	leafpile	well, you're on the LTS path as you call it , right now . I assume you're on 10.04
