2008-03-03T02:25:00.000Z	MasterAslan		I really really really hope someone can help me.  I somehow managed to mess up my permissions.  Everything got set to 777 and now I can't boot into the system other than in recovery mode.  Is there a script or something that I can run to set all file permissions to what they should be?

2008-03-03T02:27:00.000Z	prince_jammys	MasterAslan	no, when you say "everything" you mean your home dir?
2008-03-03T02:29:00.000Z	prince_jammys	MasterAslan	big mess
