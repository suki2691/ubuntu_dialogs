2008-06-24T23:26:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cuco	Really? What file system are you using? ext3?
2008-06-24T23:32:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cuco	The problem may not be on your side.
2008-06-24T23:33:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cuco	Is it just a single file you are unable to get? Or have you tried with several from several different servers?
