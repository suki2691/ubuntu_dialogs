2011-07-13T11:28:00.000Z	com64		I'm having trouble transcoding with mencoder. I get "Audio LAVC, couldn't find encoder for codec libfaac."

2011-07-13T11:30:00.000Z	zykotick9	com64	i'd guess Handbrake would work for that (but i don't have a PSP so can't be sure)
2011-07-13T11:30:00.000Z	zykotick9	com64	there is a PPA
