2011-11-16T13:18:00.000Z	MagicJ		what is the parameter to apt-get so that I can upgrade from 10.04 to 10.10 at the command line?
2011-11-16T13:18:00.000Z	click170	MagicJ	Are you looking for 'apt-get dist-upgrade' ? (IIRC)
2011-11-16T13:19:00.000Z	MagicJ	click170	 that does not do it - I thought it would but that still keeps me at 10.04 because that is a LTS version
2011-11-16T13:22:00.000Z	click170	MagicJ	A brief (very brief) google search would suggest the way to upgrade is with update manager, the gui program.
