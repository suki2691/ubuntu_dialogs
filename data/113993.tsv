2008-01-14T05:02:00.000Z	Hamelin		I've got a question, if someone could help me out
2008-01-14T05:03:00.000Z	Hamelin		Ok, well, I'm trying to use the gnome screensaver program to run an image slideshow, I've got it set up, but it scales all the images to fullscreen, which makes many of them look fairly crappy, is there any way I can stop it from resizing the images?
