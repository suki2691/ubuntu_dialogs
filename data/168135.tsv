2007-02-24T09:20:00.000Z	_ceed_		Question: I run Ubuntu on my desktop, and now I want to move it to a laptop. Since I am using it for work I do not have time to mess too much with it. What kind if laptop should I get where Ubuntu just runs and wireless, lan, display, powermanagement and standby just works?
