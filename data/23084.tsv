2011-03-23T21:25:00.000Z	GeekyAdam		just installed fresh ubuntu 10.10 on a machine and every time i run sudo apt-get install <package> i get a warning "WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!" which is weird because i havent added any repos or anything. fresh install using default ubuntu repos, why aren't they authenticated?
