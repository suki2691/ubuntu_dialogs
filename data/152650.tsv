2006-12-29T12:33:00.000Z	vulcanius	Afief	got a separate file system for boot?
2006-12-29T12:34:00.000Z	Afief	vulcanius	nope, only home and root. I never understood why i would need a boot FS(perhaps you can tell me?)
2006-12-29T12:34:00.000Z	vulcanius	Afief	well put it this way, if you ever fill up your root partition on accident or without noticing
