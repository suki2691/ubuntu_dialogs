2009-05-08T21:15:00.000Z	matreya6		Using Ubuntu 9.04. My Gnome top panel got corrupted. I can re-add the Main menu, but how can I add the "Applications", "Locations" and "System" menus again?

2009-05-08T21:19:00.000Z	matreya6	chuck_	thx, I'll try that
2009-05-08T21:25:00.000Z	matreya6	chuck_	thanks a bunch! Your suggestion brought back my panel as it was before!
