After googleing for a while i found many possible solutions but all of em involved a sys re-install or a grub re-install or anyway some long and maybe difficult and uncomfy stuff. I solved it just by opening my desktop and unplugging and replugging both the power cables and the sata connector of my main hdd, reboot and it works! i thin
