2012-10-18T04:15:00.000Z	actionParsnip	somethingoranoth	sudo is for CLI commands only, gksudo is to be used for GUI apps
2012-10-18T04:15:00.000Z	actionParsnip	somethingoranoth	but can be used for both CLI and GUI apps :)
2012-10-18T04:16:00.000Z	actionParsnip	somethingoranoth	yes but it isn't setup right and you can damage the ownership of files in yur home folder
