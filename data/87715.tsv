2008-10-06T22:01:00.000Z	homy	recon69	yes, thats right. It's also correct when making a pdf and evince displays it correctly. But it's easier to edit when it really shows the page in original size and just doesn't pretend...
2008-10-06T22:05:00.000Z	homy	recon69	so how can I make openoffice use the same dpi value as evince and other applications?
2008-10-06T22:24:00.000Z	homy	recon69	yes, for me its 93%. But that's a dirty hack. I should be able to set the screen dpi value, or, even better, 100% should be 100% by default!!!
