2009-11-09T18:11:00.000Z	MD-11		hi folks! a question:  i have openssh runing nice on my home desktop. What i want to do is to run openssh on startup thru a script. I have been reading some stuf about rc.d and others. I would be glad if someone could explain me what are the rc files, and how can i do it with openssh! (as u can see i am new to linux)

2009-11-09T18:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MD-11	 check google for 'sysv init' tutorials :) they are fancy scripts. but ubuntu is slowly changeing over to the UPSTART init systemm
2009-11-09T18:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MD-11	 so a lot of things in the sysv guides/tutorials dont always apply to ubuntu
