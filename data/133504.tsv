2007-08-23T12:01:00.000Z	Slor		Just need a quick recommendation - I have a machine with dual P3-550 procs and 512MB RAM that I want to use primarily for internet services (ssh, ftp, maybe web, mail, etc.) and would also like to have at least basic local graphical desktop.  What distro might be best suited as "mostly server with some desktop" installation on that hardware?

2007-08-23T12:05:00.000Z	faileas	Slor	I tend to use 6.06 LTS server on my servers.. thats the LTS.My GUIed Terminal server (VM) is running on Feisty. both seem pretty good
