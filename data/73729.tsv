2009-12-29T01:50:00.000Z	urthmover		Gmail desktop notification.  I have multiple gmail accounts.  cGmail doesn't seem to work under 64bit  Does anyone have an email notification app that they like?  Will it utilize notify-osd?
2009-12-29T01:51:00.000Z	blakkheim	urthmover	i've used both gmail-notify and checkgmail
2009-12-29T01:51:00.000Z	blakkheim	urthmover	i'm not sure if they are in the ubuntu repos though
2009-12-29T01:52:00.000Z	blakkheim	urthmover	i've never used notify-osd and only have one gmail account so i can't answer either of those sorry :(
