2009-01-23T06:21:00.000Z	dubside		I have a 64 bit compatable computer and I am curious what the difference between the 32 and 64 bit versions of ubuntu?
2009-01-23T06:21:00.000Z	Heliodor	dubside	64bit version can handle more RAM and in-memory data
2009-01-23T06:21:00.000Z	Heliodor	dubside	only use 64-bit if you have over 4gb ram
2009-01-23T06:22:00.000Z	Heliodor	dubside	stick with 32bit version
