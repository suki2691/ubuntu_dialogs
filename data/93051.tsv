2008-05-12T07:50:00.000Z	StephenF		Any ideas why an ubuntu 8.04 desktop CD would freeze on the loading bar?
2008-05-12T07:51:00.000Z	StephenF		I selected install ubuntu, and then the logo and loading bar showed. The loading bar then stops moving and sits there
2008-05-12T07:51:00.000Z	StephenF		ok I will try those
