I ran a registry cleaner, after i had just installed language packs before i restarted, it also screwed my xp partition, now neither will reboot, how can i run system restore for my vista partition _without_ a vista\xp boot cd? anyway to do it from linux? i have hard access to both partitions any ideas?
