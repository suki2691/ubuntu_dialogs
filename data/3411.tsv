2012-10-19T21:12:00.000Z	kingfisher64		can someone tell me if updating from ubuntu 11.10 64 bit to ubuntu 12.10 32 bit will cause problems. I've just updated and it appears to be fine. Could there be potential problems under the surface?
2012-10-19T21:13:00.000Z	kingfisher64		i know it's an odd question
2012-10-19T21:14:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	kingfisher64	Not a advised upgrade.
