2008-04-26T18:52:00.000Z	otarid		Hi, I'm having trouble getting connected to wireless networks after upgrading to 8.04, my network card is Intel Pro/Wireless 3945 (also the wireless on/off LED doesn't work anymore, not that it matters..)
2008-04-26T18:53:00.000Z	otarid		Wireless does work if I pick the older kernel version (-14?) from the boot screen, but that gives me issues with nvidia graphic card
2008-04-26T18:54:00.000Z	josh04_	otarid	Still here? ;)
2008-04-26T18:56:00.000Z	josh04_	otarid	I'd offer to help, but I don't know anything about intel cards : /
