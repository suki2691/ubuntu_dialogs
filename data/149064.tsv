2007-02-23T07:35:00.000Z	deadeyes		hi all, if I log in on my computer through VNC I always get logged in automatically, instead of having the ability to choose which windowmanager I wan't to use
2007-02-23T07:37:00.000Z	unop	deadeyes	 thats how VNC works -- there are no display managers, it's a session the user has started and VNC starts the window manager set in ~/.vnc/xstartup
