2008-02-09T03:14:00.000Z	singlesun	chaosrl	fdisk should show you it... just use p to show partitions
2008-02-09T03:15:00.000Z	chaosrl	singlesun	i'm not really sure how to use fdisk command in terminal, how would i use 'p'?
2008-02-09T03:16:00.000Z	singlesun	chaosrl	go into terminal... and type "fdisk /dev/hda" for your drive maybe something besides hda though
