2008-05-08T15:04:00.000Z	InterestedPanthe		[Ubuntu 8.04 and FireFox 3.0b5] Sound is working on all applications I've tried in Ubuntu except for FireFox.  This comes in when at YouTube, etc.  I've searched ubuntuforums, but the prospects look bleak.  Is there anything anyone can recommend?  Thanks!

2008-05-08T15:07:00.000Z	ryukun	InterestedPanthe	I haven't noticed any other difference except the sound.
