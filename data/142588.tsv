2009-04-02T18:45:00.000Z	clearscreen		Guess I'm the one asking the question this time :) I was trying to install vista. Booted into ubuntu live cd and resized my ext3 partition. Problem is that vista install does see the reserved space and apparently is able to create a 'new' partition in that space, but it can't find 'a partition suitable for installation' for some reason. I'm now trying to create an ntfs partition from ubuntu, but gparted cant make ntfs partition.. MY QUESTI
