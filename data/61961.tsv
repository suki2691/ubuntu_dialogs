2009-08-31T11:26:00.000Z	grawity	jeff6780	How are you installing them?
2009-08-31T11:55:00.000Z	grawity	jeff6780	And why are you using such an old client, then?
2009-08-31T11:56:00.000Z	grawity	jeff6780	I suggest just using Pidgin or Empathy. While they're not official, they do get updated often (and so far work perfectly with AIM)
