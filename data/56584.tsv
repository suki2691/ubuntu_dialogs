2009-06-21T16:03:00.000Z	IRConan		is it possible to make ubuntu get two IPs for eth0 and eth0:1 both from dhcp?
2009-06-21T16:03:00.000Z	Warp4	IRConan	think so
2009-06-21T16:04:00.000Z	IRConan	Warp4	do I just add an entry to /etc/network/interfaces for eth0:1
2009-06-21T16:04:00.000Z	Warp4	IRConan	check your query window
