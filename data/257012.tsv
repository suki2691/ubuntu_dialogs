2005-01-01T11:58:00.000Z	cryptomatt		i get this error right at the boot process saying that VFS: Can't find ext3 filesystem on dev hda6.
2005-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	cryptomatt		this is because its an reiserfs
2005-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	cryptomatt	do you even use ext3?
2005-01-01T12:02:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	cryptomatt	if you find out... enlighten me ;)
