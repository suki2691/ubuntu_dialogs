2005-09-19T10:41:00.000Z	sewoyl	BlueEagle	i dont think so, i had two files on a CDRW thn the next day i dragged a file in burn:// and clicked the 'burn' buton and all that was on my cd was .... that one last file :(
2005-09-19T10:42:00.000Z	BlueEagle	sewoyl	Hmm.. ok. I've never used that, so I wouldn't know. :)
