2010-09-16T02:05:00.000Z	The_Paco		I've been dinking around this past hour (slow) learning regular expression bits and setting up this grep of a large file: grep -o "http://[^ ]*[/>]" big.file... I want to redirect it's output, but I also want to insert newlines between each found instance. Is that something I can put in the command, or do I need to write a script for that?
