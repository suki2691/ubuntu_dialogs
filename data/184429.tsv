2006-05-28T07:19:00.000Z	Quintok	Anusien	it's not the same, root password by default is randomly generated each install of ubuntu
2006-05-28T07:20:00.000Z	Quintok	Anusien	well you need to be able to use root somehow, lol
2006-05-28T07:21:00.000Z	Quintok	Anusien	it's so your account is sort-of-root.  so you can use root powers when you need it but for the most part they're disabled.  Yea I know what you mean I was waiting for the root password question too.
