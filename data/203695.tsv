2009-02-03T07:31:00.000Z	eross		i have the mx-3200 logitech wireless keyboard and mouse. is there a reason why in openarena, W (forward) + A (left) + spacebar doesn't work? It works with the right strafe key
2009-02-03T07:31:00.000Z	eross		spacebar = jump
2009-02-03T07:33:00.000Z	madmax__	eross	try a wired kbd see if its the keyboard or OA
