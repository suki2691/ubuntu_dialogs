2009-09-07T14:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	admini123	  You mount the windows filesystem to some location, then access the drive that way
2009-09-07T15:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	admini123	 you mount the windows FILESYTEM then access the windows drive as if it was any other drive/folder.
2009-09-07T15:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	admini123	 see what jasa  says.. then you sould   access /wheretomount/Documents/Whatever/whever/Desktop/Porn  or whatever the path would be to the files
