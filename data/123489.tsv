2007-11-03T20:15:00.000Z	c0mp13371331337		Anyone know how to suppress a particular update?  I just went through the pain and agony of rolling back my ATI drivers to the Feisty versions and I don't want Update Manager telling me about the Gutsy version all the time.  Is there a way to tell it not to upgrade that one?
