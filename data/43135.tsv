2009-11-10T09:03:00.000Z	Wesgizmo365		Hi, I was wondering if anyone could help me. I just finished building a computer for the first time, and am trying to install ubuntu on it (obviously). However, the screen keeps saying "operating system not found," and I have no clue what to do.

2009-11-10T09:04:00.000Z	Bell_Labs	Wesgizmo365	also check your installation media, preferably with an md5 hash
2009-11-10T09:06:00.000Z	Bell_Labs	Wesgizmo365	reboot and try pressing F* keys
