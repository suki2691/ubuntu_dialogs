2005-12-19T10:01:00.000Z	JairunCaloth		I just upgraded to a new video driver, and I'm getting an error when X trys to start saying the kernel driver and the X driver are different. I don't remember the commands to recompile the kernel that I used last time I did this.
2005-12-19T10:03:00.000Z	JairunCaloth		Do I only need to recompile the restricted modules?
2005-12-19T10:04:00.000Z	sklav	JairunCaloth	why not install the latest restricted modules?
