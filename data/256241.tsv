2011-11-14T13:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	stryke297	 you cecked the md5sum of the iso file also?
2011-11-14T13:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	stryke297	  for 11.10 you can use dd to put the iso on a pendrive. theres also a dozen tools to do it at  the pendrivelinux web site. I tend to do the 'use grub2 to boot iso' type methods these dsays
2011-11-14T14:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	stryke297	 that would make sence.
