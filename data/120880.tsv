2008-03-18T05:42:00.000Z	DFlame		Evenin' folks. Having a bit of trouble booting from a live CD (7.10). After hitting star/install the screen blacks out and i get beeps from the compy. I think it's a gfx prob. The gard is a nvidia 8500
2008-03-18T05:42:00.000Z	Stroganoff	DFlame	use alternate cd.
2008-03-18T05:44:00.000Z	DFlame	Stroganoff	I'd like to be able to partition manually. Is that possible on the alternate?
2008-03-18T05:44:00.000Z	Stroganoff	DFlame	yes it is
