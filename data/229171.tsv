2007-05-18T16:45:00.000Z	double-H		i have a question: i am new with linux/ubuntu and i want to try it first with a live-cd... ok i downloaded the file and burned it on cd. but i will not start after i restart windows. what is wrong?
2007-05-18T16:46:00.000Z	mwe	double-H	you should boot the CD not windows
2007-05-18T16:47:00.000Z	mwe	double-H	it's not meant to be run from windows rather to be run instead of windows
