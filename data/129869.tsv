2007-10-08T12:27:00.000Z	dissection		Hello. I was just trying out wireshark. Can that capture packets only from the system its running on, or any system on the LAN?
2007-10-08T12:29:00.000Z	h1st0	dissection	system its running on.  Unless you arp poison the other computer on the lan
2007-10-08T12:31:00.000Z	dissection	h1st0	What do you mean by arp poison? Is there something I need to install on the other PC?
