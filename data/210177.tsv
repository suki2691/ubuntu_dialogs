2007-04-30T11:38:00.000Z	Tarkus	kevix	im installing azureus (bittorent client). its already in the ubuntu repos, and i installed it, but it doesnt work. the program closes half a second after the splash screen finishes. so i asked in azureus, and they told me to download the tarball from the site instead..
