2009-12-18T08:21:00.000Z	slix	apanda	I was looking through the Ubuntu Software Center and saw one in the programming section.
2009-12-18T08:23:00.000Z	apanda		thanks slix, but that means i'd have to install it, right? i thought it would come with a hexeditor installed
2009-12-18T08:23:00.000Z	slix	apanda	Yeah, you'd have to install it. I don't know if Ubuntu comes with a hex editor.
