2009-02-21T23:38:00.000Z	tensei		Can someone help?  I want to create a shared folder on 1 ubuntu 8.04 desktop that I can access from another ubuntu 8.04 desktop.  I read a turorial on sharing, which seems easy enough.  In windows you can map a folder as a network drive, do you do the same thing on the client desktop??
