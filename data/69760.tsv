2009-01-06T03:11:00.000Z	__MAV		What program can I use to backup my Ubuntu installation (including partitioning) and burn it to DVD so later I can boot from that DVD and restore the system ?
2009-01-06T03:13:00.000Z	Matisse	__MAV	you could make a installed packages list and also put all personal data into a tarball, but I wouldnt make a DVD to but from. To much work. Just reinstalling with internet connection would be better
2009-01-06T03:14:00.000Z	Matisse	__MAV	(reinstalling using that package list)
