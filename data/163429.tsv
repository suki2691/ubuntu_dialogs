2007-02-05T16:17:00.000Z	GreySim	Music_Shuffle	What are you trying to change about it?
2007-02-05T16:17:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	GreySim	its always mounted as read-only, I want it as read/write.
2007-02-05T16:17:00.000Z	GreySim	Music_Shuffle	Ah, I don't know how to do that, but someone else hopefully does.
