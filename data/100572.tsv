2008-08-17T07:20:00.000Z	prince_jammys	squarebracket	go to #bash, and type /topic
2008-08-17T07:20:00.000Z	prince_jammys	squarebracket	the Bash guide there is the best guide. you can also apt-get install abs-guide
2008-08-17T07:21:00.000Z	prince_jammys	squarebracket	but the one in #bash is the best.
