2009-02-21T05:27:00.000Z	hmw	sagredo	- i dont know mikroska, but try mplayer
2009-02-21T05:28:00.000Z	hmw	sagredo	- mplayer is a console app, you need mplayer-gui for using it within gnome
2009-02-21T05:28:00.000Z	sagredo	hmw	I'll try that, I just found a google search that said vlc supports it the best currently. We'll see
