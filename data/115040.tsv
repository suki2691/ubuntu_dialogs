2008-06-15T11:41:00.000Z	ackbahr		Hello! I know its kind of a common issue, but I couldnt figure out any solution using web ressources, so I turn to you. I have this ATI Mobility 9600 M10 graphic card, I now I got compiz to work I cant play a video (very slow FPS), Im not really sure I have 3D acceleration (glxgears gives me something like 60FPS, but I already saw better with other drivers) and my keyboard layout is wrong (although xorg.conf seems right). Anyone could help?
