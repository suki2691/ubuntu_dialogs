2005-08-31T15:32:00.000Z	munir		I am new to Linux. Is ubuntu fine to me?
2005-08-31T15:33:00.000Z	munir		Thanks <nicholaspaul>. Can you compare it with SuSE?
2005-08-31T15:35:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	munir	- no i dont know Suse... but from what i've heard, Ubuntu is easier to use. You can custom install it from a slim, fast 500Mb distro up to a couple gigs if you want.
