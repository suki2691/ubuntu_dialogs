2007-10-18T12:55:00.000Z	generalsnus		a question:  as ive understood, win xp 64bit lacks a lot of drivers and app support.. is it the same issue with ubuntu 64bit?  is there any problems that might arise when choosing 64bit over 32?

2007-10-18T12:55:00.000Z	scguy318	generalsnus	kernel modules shouldn't be a problem, its just a matter of recompilation
2007-10-18T12:55:00.000Z	scguy318	generalsnus	but its better to stick with 32-bit
