2007-03-06T10:12:00.000Z	schwachs		hey all, i have ubuntu running under vmware but my clock is way off and doesn't seem to want correct itself.  does the "keep clock sync..." function work under this situation?
2007-03-06T10:12:00.000Z	crund	schwachs	doesn't vmware have an option to sync guest OS with host OS?
2007-03-06T10:12:00.000Z	crund	schwachs	i thought that's what i used to do ...
