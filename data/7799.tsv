2011-11-18T09:32:00.000Z	Hilikus		i was running an update but my console crashed. now i see the terminal being connected (pts/2) and the processes are still there. how can i re-grab or re-attach to pts/2?
2011-11-18T09:34:00.000Z	brjannc	Hilikus	were you using screen or anything like that?
2011-11-18T09:34:00.000Z	Hilikus	brjannc	no, i was running a distro upgrade
2011-11-18T09:35:00.000Z	brjannc	Hilikus	I'll agree with askhader then, I don't think there's any way to reattach to a pty. Surprised it's still there, actually
