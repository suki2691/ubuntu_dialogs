2005-09-20T08:38:00.000Z	cmatheson		ok so i got a new isp... and now for some reason all my linux boxen are unable to connect w/ gaim, irc, most websites w/ firefox, etc.  everything works fine on my family's windows box(es).  the strangest thing is that i can connect to Yahoo! M$N etc using centercicq, and links is able to browse all pages.... if i connect to other networks everything works fine (as normal), this is blowing my mind and i don't get it.  any clues?

2005-09-20T08:41:00.000Z	cmatheson	dcraven	rad, i'll check that out... (have to do it at later, i was forced to wait til work to ask since i can't get on irc at home heh)
