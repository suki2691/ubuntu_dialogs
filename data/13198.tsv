2012-05-14T23:07:00.000Z	maheanuu		Good Morning, I would appreciate it if someone might help me removing a application and then re-installing it, it is a skype problem and only occurred after the re installation of 10.04.4
2012-05-14T23:08:00.000Z	designbybeck	maheanuu	 why are you still using 10.04?
2012-05-14T23:09:00.000Z	maheanuu	designbybeck	I installed it after having a major hd failure and did the install of Lucid 10.04.4 LTS 64 bit
2012-05-14T23:10:00.000Z	maheanuu	designbybeck	should I be using something faster?  I like the layout of 10.XX
