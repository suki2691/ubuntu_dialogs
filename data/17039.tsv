2012-07-15T02:07:00.000Z	mrdeb		hello. i copied theme to /usr/sharethemes but cant change it with obconf. no permission
2012-07-15T02:08:00.000Z	trism	mrdeb	does obconf let you edit the theme? if so, try unpacking to ~/.themes/ instead
2012-07-15T02:09:00.000Z	mrdeb	trism	no it wont. i want it in usr/share/themes it worked before
2012-07-15T02:10:00.000Z	trism	mrdeb	no idea then, either directory should work in general, but I haven't used obconf in a very long time, sorry
