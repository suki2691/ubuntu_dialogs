2009-01-21T21:16:00.000Z	hmw	alesan	there is network tools in the graphical user interface, containing traceroute. i dont know how to "properly" do it in command line, i installed traceroute manually.
2009-01-21T21:30:00.000Z	hmw	alesan	you can just temporarily ifconfig your if
2009-01-21T21:31:00.000Z	alesan	hmw	that's the point, network manager messes with my manual config
