2007-05-29T06:43:00.000Z	cholera		I have tried Dia, does anyone have any recommendations for a program I could use to create a layout designed more for architectural use?

2007-05-29T06:48:00.000Z	cholera	LjL	yep, sure does.....I feel stupid. Thanks, it has been a disaster trying to edit files lately :)
