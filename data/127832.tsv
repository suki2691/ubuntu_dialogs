2007-08-11T15:04:00.000Z	endo		I'm having a problem all of the time. My desktop freezes up, can't do nothing with it. Not even Ctrl+Alt+Backspace

2007-08-11T15:05:00.000Z	endo	sauvin	i'm assuming it's the compiz-fusion
2007-08-11T15:05:00.000Z	sauvin	endo	maybe you'd be better served in #ubuntu-effects
