2007-04-20T11:17:00.000Z	Rage__		Hi, was just wondering if there is a way to install ubuntu with only xserver all setup and maybe gnome but not all the programs that I dont need so I can install only things I want... Is the best way to do that to in stall server edition and install xserver? TBH I dont even want gnome I use evilwm. :)
