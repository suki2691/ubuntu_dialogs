2007-07-09T10:33:00.000Z	Crnd	OldPink	well my laptop already has 256 but i'm just wondering if i should double that... would also help me with windows quite much.
2007-07-09T10:34:00.000Z	OldPink	Crnd	Ah, just the person I need then! How is 256 treating you on Ubuntu?
2007-07-09T10:35:00.000Z	Crnd	OldPink	haven't installed ubuntu yet :) wondering if i should first get more memory
