2009-09-27T02:47:00.000Z	slashzul		is there a way to upgrade from 8.10 to 9.04 with a cdrom
2009-09-27T02:48:00.000Z	slashzul		so cant do upgrade-manager method, Ive got the dvd though
2009-09-27T02:49:00.000Z	slashzul		damn, I did use 8.04, but thought I had to upgrade first
2009-09-27T02:51:00.000Z	guntbert	slashzul	maybe #ubuntu-server is the better place for your problem?
