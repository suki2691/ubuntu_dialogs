2006-03-03T16:40:00.000Z	LjL	beena	i would probably use the winehq repository. edit your /etc/apt/sources.list, add ubotu's wine "deb" line to it, issue a "sudo apt-get update", then use "sudo aptitude install wine" (or use synaptic)
2006-03-03T16:43:00.000Z	beena	LjL	i am inside Synaptic now. which shud i install? windows-el, wine, wine-dev, winesetupk ?
