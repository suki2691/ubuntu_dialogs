2012-06-26T07:56:00.000Z	battlehands		I am in terminal.  After executing some python commands, my terminal starts displaying "funky characters" when I try to type.  I ctrl+d and I can begin typing letters again, but I cannot get back to my default command line.  This is a repeating problem.  Please advise.

2012-06-26T07:58:00.000Z	battlehands	jrdnn	I'm looking for a fix that doesnt require me to exit terminal
2012-06-26T07:58:00.000Z	jrdnn	battlehands	 "clear" maybe?
