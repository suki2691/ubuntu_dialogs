2010-05-02T02:54:00.000Z	Glacer		Hello, I upgraded to ubuntu 10.04 about 2 days ago and sometimes my actual time on the system shows wrong, but the package  gdesklet with time was right, is that a bug or a error probably on my side?
2010-05-02T02:54:00.000Z	Glacer		I have to restart to fix time
2010-05-02T02:55:00.000Z	Monotoko	Glacer	are you running Windows as well?
2010-05-02T02:57:00.000Z	Glacer	Monotoko	it seems to be working fine for right now, maybe it will not do this again I hope
