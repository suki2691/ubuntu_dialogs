2007-09-05T11:27:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	dew	sry, screenlets?
2007-09-05T11:35:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	dew	sure, maybe someone knows. I'm nutubuntu myself ;P
2007-09-05T11:43:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	dew	yes, problem persisted through three revs of Firefox, if I'm counting right ... since I installed Feisty, in fact, on this newly built box. AMD64 X2, 32-bit Feisty ... I suspect it's something to do with the CPU and the kernel, but really that's a total guess. strace says it's trying to stat64 a nonexistent directory in ~/.mozilla when it segfaults
