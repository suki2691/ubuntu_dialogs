2012-05-22T04:29:00.000Z	Gyro54		A quick question - How do I shutdown in Gnome 3. I only have a suspend button?
2012-05-22T04:30:00.000Z	compdoc	Gyro54	are you logged into the console?
2012-05-22T04:30:00.000Z	Gyro54		I can be but I thought I could shutdown from the GUI
2012-05-22T04:32:00.000Z	Gyro54	compdoc	I only have a suspend option from the desktop and can't see how to change it to "shutdown"
