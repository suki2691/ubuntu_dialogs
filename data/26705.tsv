2011-02-09T04:25:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	area51pilot	A bit more specific? There is postfix, courier, dovecot - and more...
2011-02-09T04:27:00.000Z	area51pilot	YankDownUnder	It is kind of general, I migrated out of exchange last night to Google Apps...Google Apps is working but not all emails are flowing, I wanted to see if anything still points to the old server
2011-02-09T04:27:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	area51pilot	Hmmm....confusing that. Sorry mate, can't think of anything to help ya on that one.
