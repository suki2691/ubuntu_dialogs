2008-12-04T08:05:00.000Z	Zoffix		Hello, I've installed Ubuntu 8.10 from a "Minimal" CD and I'm having a hard time installing "Restricted Drivers Manager". Anyone have a clue in which package that thing is?

2008-12-04T08:08:00.000Z	Zoffix	arrenlex	uh, that is it. It shows up in Synaptic here at the home box, but I searched for "restricted" at $work on that "minimal" install and didn't see it. Well, at least now I know for sure the name of the package. Gonna check the sources tomorrow. Thanks.
