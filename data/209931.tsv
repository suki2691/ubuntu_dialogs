2007-12-23T19:50:00.000Z	LjL	thorm	wha? no. i assume you meant to say *Java* applications anyway?
2007-12-23T19:52:00.000Z	LjL	thorm	anyway, you should be able to install 'azureus' by just typing « sudo apt-get install azureus ». it's a package that's available in the repositories.
2007-12-23T19:54:00.000Z	LjL	thorm	remember to *always* search for packages in the repositories before installing them in other strange ways (which are likely to break your system).
