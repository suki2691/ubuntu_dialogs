2005-09-10T09:14:00.000Z	josh_		quick question (I don't have a Ubuntu system, helping someone who does): what's the path to the SSH server init script?
2005-09-10T09:14:00.000Z	Ng	josh_	init scripts almost always live in /etc/init.d/
2005-09-10T09:14:00.000Z	josh_	Ng	thanks
2005-09-10T09:14:00.000Z	Ng	josh_	so in this case, /etc/init.d/ssh
