2011-08-23T23:49:00.000Z	stwange		I've got a dual monitor setup, with the laptop being the main monitor and another off to the right (not that it matters). I've set the configuration and it's fine, but every time I login (without fail), after about 6 seconds it reverts to showing the same image on both and changing the resolution on the laptop. How can I fix it?
