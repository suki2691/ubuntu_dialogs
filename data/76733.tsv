2008-10-22T14:31:00.000Z	digitig		Hi. New to Ubuntu. I can't work out how to make new applications available on the desktop. I've just added IDLE, and it starts just fine from the "New application has just been installed" box but I can't work out what file that's starting -- searching the file system for "idle" doesn't turn up anything that works. Can anyone help?
