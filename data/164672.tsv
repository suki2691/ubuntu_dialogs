2008-01-15T11:00:00.000Z	nataku_		does anyone know of an orange-on-black GTK theme?
2008-01-15T11:01:00.000Z	nataku_		I've searched art.gnome.org, gnome-look.org, and a couple others from top to bottom :(
2008-01-15T11:01:00.000Z	nataku_		actually maybe I'll just poke around in the gtkrc file for a theme I already like
