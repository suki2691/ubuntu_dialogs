2008-03-26T01:51:00.000Z	pike_	zeptit	ubuntu is based on debian. what youll find is that its at its strongest in handing packages/apps much better than even windows. there is a add/remove program app that automatically removes or uninstalls whatever you want from a central reposistory no hunting no manual installs or uninstalls
