2009-12-19T09:25:00.000Z	losha	Danielpk	which os version are you running
2009-12-19T09:25:00.000Z	Danielpk	losha	latest.. just downloaded.
2009-12-19T09:28:00.000Z	losha	Danielpk	9.10 (karmic) then. In the past I've renamed /usr/sbin/gdm and /usr/sbin/gdm-binary to stop them being executed at login. You will get a login prompt instead of a gui screen...
