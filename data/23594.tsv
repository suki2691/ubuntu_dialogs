2010-10-24T06:59:00.000Z	AkivaLivecd1	AlanMeta	you mean to use, or to create?
2010-10-24T07:01:00.000Z	AlanMeta	AkivaLivecd1	to use, I want to edit a remote server from a local install ubuntu
2010-10-24T07:02:00.000Z	AkivaLivecd1	AlanMeta	you should run virtual box, and then run a remote desktop within that of your host computer
