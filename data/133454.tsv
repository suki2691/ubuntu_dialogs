2007-05-23T16:11:00.000Z	rococo	swatF1RESTORM	or at least the ones you like the best
2007-05-23T16:11:00.000Z	rococo	swatF1RESTORM	start looking at all the programs for things you'll use every day and pick the best ones
2007-05-23T16:12:00.000Z	swatF1RESTORM	rococo	i was thinking more along the lines of things like easy-ubuntu, automatix2.. i don't want to go installing everything under the sun. just the common stuff... like i know i need the w32codes and libdvdcss(sp?)
