2008-10-24T14:40:00.000Z	ikonia	scopecreep	depnds what your doing, if you want to use suspect / hibernate you should at least match your ram
2008-10-24T14:48:00.000Z	ikonia	scopecreep	you can, but resizing any partitions has a risk associated with it, so be careful
2008-10-24T14:48:00.000Z	ikonia	scopecreep	be aware you uuid number of that parttiion will change
