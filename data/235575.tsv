2007-01-02T10:13:00.000Z	tehArtist		Hey everyone, just wanted to say, I got my Disc Drive problem fixed with Ubuntu, and finally got the LiveCD install working..now I'm stuck in the install (this is my first *nix install in a long time). I have an unallocated amount of space on the HDD set aside for Ubuntu...
2007-01-02T10:13:00.000Z	tehArtist		I'm not sure how to do the swap/root stuff...
2007-01-02T10:14:00.000Z	Madpilot	tehArtist	depends on how much space you've got to play in. I'd got w/ 5-10 Gb for root, maybe 1Gb for /swap
2007-01-02T10:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	tehArtist	you should have a seperate / (root) partition too
