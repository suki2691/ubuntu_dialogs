2010-10-03T01:52:00.000Z	sark666		i have a friend i set up with ubuntu a couple of years ago.  i can't even recall what version 8.04 i think.  haven't talked to him in a bit and he's trying to play a video that doesn't work in gnomeplayer or vlc, mplayer etc
2010-10-03T01:53:00.000Z	sark666		i tried a clip and it works fine.  anyway, I just wanted to get him the latest vlc
2010-10-03T01:54:00.000Z	sark666		that's the thing, can he now upgrade to latest ubuntu directly, or does he have to upgrad x number of times?
