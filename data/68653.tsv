2012-06-08T06:21:00.000Z	mouse		I'm trying to install a package but I keep getting a dependency error.  It says it needs ia32-libs but the version of ia32-libs I have installed is the most recent.  Is there something else I need to do to setup ia32-libs so the system can make use of it?
2012-06-08T06:22:00.000Z	phunyguy	mouse	is it coming from a 3rd party repo?
2012-06-08T06:22:00.000Z	mouse	phunyguy	The package I'm trying to install is coming from the humble bundle.
