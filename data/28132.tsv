2010-08-08T16:38:00.000Z	Legendary_Bibo	abhijit	Playonlinux is a frontend to Wine which makes it easier to setup and tweak games to play in wine
2010-08-08T16:40:00.000Z	Legendary_Bibo	abhijit	I think play on will install Wine anyways, it doesn't hurt to have both
2010-08-08T17:01:00.000Z	abhijit	Legendary_Bibo	ok
