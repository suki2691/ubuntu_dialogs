2006-01-23T11:18:00.000Z	George_Harrison		I'm having troubles getting sound to work in flash. I have Firefox 1.5 with ubuntu breezy. I have followed two guides on ubuntu forums but it still does not work
2006-01-23T11:19:00.000Z	George_Harrison		so.. how about that flash..
2006-01-23T11:20:00.000Z	George_Harrison		so why is the sound in flash corrupt in ubuntu
2006-01-23T11:21:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	George_Harrison	I'm not sure.  I had that issue once, but I think I ended up reinstalling flash (or maybe it was part of getting ff1.5), and it worked later.
