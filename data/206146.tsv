2005-12-02T11:05:00.000Z	Max-T		Mine's just starting for the first time and it had 'fail' for one thing but it went to fast for me to read what it was
2005-12-02T11:07:00.000Z	Max-T		I thought it was booting up but it's not... It's now 'installing packages' I could swear it did that before it ejected the CD and rebooted
2005-12-02T11:07:00.000Z	psychocat	Max-T	that's normal. It was just selecting packages and now it has to install them
