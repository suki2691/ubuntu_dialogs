2007-09-19T15:31:00.000Z	Bulazeem		i have a Western digital My Book and i cant write anything to it.  it says i dont have permission even if i open it up with gksudo nautilus and then try and put stuff on it
2007-09-19T15:31:00.000Z	nickrud	Bulazeem	is that an ntfs volume
2007-09-19T15:32:00.000Z	nickrud	Bulazeem	no, you can use ntfs-3g to write to ntfs
2007-09-19T15:43:00.000Z	Bulazeem	nickrud	i got ntfs-3g installed and checked the boxes to enable writing and can still only open files but not write.  do i need to reboot?
