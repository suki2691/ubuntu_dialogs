2008-08-07T07:32:00.000Z	zozoman		Hello everyone, I have a quick question -- I have just downloaded and have been trying to install Ubuntu. When the installer starts Ubuntu freezes and the window gets distorted, only the installer window and nothing else. The background and top bar are fine. Also when this happens I cannot click on anything and I am forced to restart. Any help will be extremely appreciated!

2008-08-07T07:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	zozoman	well, yeah.. most likely
