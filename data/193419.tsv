2010-08-30T09:52:00.000Z	mallory		i can't even nuke gnome. it says it isn't installed if i look in synaptic
2010-08-30T09:52:00.000Z	mallory		but all sorts of gnome things are installed
2010-08-30T09:53:00.000Z	mallory		i'm not using kde although there were two applications installed that use kde4 libraries. i got rid of them because i thought the settings write problems were because of a kde/gnome conflict
2010-08-30T09:53:00.000Z	avi_	mallory	I also had that result of my problem.. Like i said, I just wiped the whole OS. Have you tried running the dpkg tool at single uyser mode?
