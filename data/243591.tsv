2005-10-31T13:14:00.000Z	Keito		i ordered ubuntu 5.04 cds with the shipit service, will i recieve breezy cds without any additional effort? (couldn't seem to log in to my account, so i wondered if ubuntu's gotten a new account system or something)
2005-10-31T13:14:00.000Z	frank	Keito	I think they will be breezy
2005-10-31T13:15:00.000Z	Keito	frank	i mean, like, i did recieve hoary cds, but will i also recieve breezy when they're ready for takeoff?
2005-10-31T13:15:00.000Z	frank	Keito	oh, you proabably have to order again if you already recieved cds
