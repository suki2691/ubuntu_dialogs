2010-07-22T15:48:00.000Z	mapreduce		Hi.  I've installed llvm-gcc-2.4, but when I do llvmc test.c I get told "Can't find program: llvm-gcc"
2010-07-22T15:48:00.000Z	mapreduce		Any suggestions?
2010-07-22T15:48:00.000Z	Gryllida	mapreduce	#gcc ? I don't really know.
2010-07-22T15:49:00.000Z	mapreduce	Gryllida	I expect Ubuntu packaging issues for projects that aren't gcc to be off-topic in #gcc.
