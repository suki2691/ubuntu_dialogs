2009-03-20T19:49:00.000Z	akahige1		I was just dealing with today's repo updates and one of them was Thunderbird. the description said it was a transitional package before the new name. I can't find anything at all about T-bird being renamed. Anybody know what's up?
2009-03-20T19:50:00.000Z	LjL	akahige1	they're merely renaming "mozilla-thunderbird" to "thunderbird" methinks
2009-03-20T19:51:00.000Z	LjL	akahige1	the package is changing names, not the software itself
2009-03-20T19:51:00.000Z	akahige1	LjL	really? that's... weird. LOL thanks
