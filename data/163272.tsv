2010-10-28T21:41:00.000Z	Tjkent		I am having a problem downloading files, I keep getting this as the problem  http://pastebin.com/NuGvwq5x
2010-10-28T21:41:00.000Z	Tjkent		when I try the same file on another computer it is fine
2010-10-28T21:42:00.000Z	Praxi	Tjkent	how are you trying to download the file, and whats the URL?  I'm an ubuntu noob, but have some experience downloading using wget on my server hehe
