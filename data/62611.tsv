2009-08-20T15:08:00.000Z	tarelerulz		I just had windows system Vista just restart and keeps restarting for no reason. I think it might be virus .  Is there any Linux anti-virus I could use to scan  windows with ?
2009-08-20T15:09:00.000Z	iceroot	tarelerulz	antivir (the same as for windows), clamd
2012-01-27T14:29:00.000Z	iceroot	tarelerulz	no
