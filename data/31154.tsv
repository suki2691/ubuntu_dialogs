2012-07-15T19:51:00.000Z	peterrus	jericom	probably because chrome packs its own 'adaptation' of flash
2012-07-15T19:53:00.000Z	jericom	peterrus	- I have looked and apparently allot of people are having this issue but I haven't found a solution
2012-07-15T19:53:00.000Z	peterrus	jericom	I gave up on firefox a while ago
