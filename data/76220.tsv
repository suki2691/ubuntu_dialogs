2010-04-17T15:33:00.000Z	akssps011		I want to install a package at location other than /usr. How can I do this using make install ?
2010-04-17T15:33:00.000Z	bloopletech	akssps011	usually you pass options to ./configure
2010-04-17T15:34:00.000Z	bloopletech	akssps011	run ./configure --help
2010-04-17T15:45:00.000Z	bloopletech	akssps011	perhaps; without detailed knowledge of the software you are attempting to comile, we are unable to help you
