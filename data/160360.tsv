Is there a good explanation as to what as going on on the backend for this screens and resolutions utility.  I would rather just bypass it all together have just use my own xorg.conf that I have manually edited

2007-12-03T04:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	miles8	That is because your version of the xorg.conf resulted in X not starting
