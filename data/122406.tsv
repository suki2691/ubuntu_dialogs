2008-01-27T22:01:00.000Z	gnurph69		I've got Ubuntu up and running, with 2 NICs...and this strange virtual NIC called eth:avahi showed up.  What is this?
2008-01-27T22:03:00.000Z	gnurph69		oops, I meant eth0:avahi
2008-01-27T22:03:00.000Z	Seveas	gnurph69	eth0:avahi can be ignored
2008-01-27T22:03:00.000Z	gnurph69	Seveas	 thank you
