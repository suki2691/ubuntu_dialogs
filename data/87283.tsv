2008-06-21T03:44:00.000Z	rainabba		Using vmware-any-any-116 I managed to get VMWare Workstation 6.5 Beta installed and I created a VM, but when I try to run I get "Version mismatch with vmmon module: expecting 198.0, got 167.0". Anyone know what install step I goofed on to end up here?
2008-06-21T03:45:00.000Z	jengelh2	rainabba	don't use any-any with workstation6.
2008-06-21T03:45:00.000Z	rainabba	jengelh2	 So I should uninstall and try again without any-any?
2008-06-21T03:52:00.000Z	rainabba	jengelh2	 That was it (no any-any). Thanks.
