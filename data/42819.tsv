2009-11-16T13:45:00.000Z	klpt		nobody knows how to figure out where pvscan is looking?
2009-11-16T13:45:00.000Z	jcdutton	klpt	what is the problem?
2009-11-16T13:47:00.000Z	klpt	jcdutton	i run pvscan and it doesn't find my raid5 based lvm array
2009-11-16T13:47:00.000Z	klpt	jcdutton	but archlinux (the source of the lvm array) still finds it OK. i can't get ubuntu to find it even by copying the entire /etc/lvm folder into ubuntu
