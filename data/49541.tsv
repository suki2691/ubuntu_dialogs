2009-08-31T13:23:00.000Z	ikonia	derwin	no such thing
2009-08-31T13:24:00.000Z	derwin	ikonia	I am, again, deb/ubuntu novice.. is it similar to rpm with spec file and etc, could I just get the "spec" from the previous ver and "hack" it for the +1 ?
2009-08-31T13:24:00.000Z	ikonia	derwin	yeah, not to dis-similar
