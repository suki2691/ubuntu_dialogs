2009-06-22T03:52:00.000Z	MattCampbell		How do I get Ubuntu (default GNOME desktop) to use a USB audio device by default instead of the onboard audio?
2009-06-22T03:54:00.000Z	MattCampbell		OK, if I change the settings in System/Preferences/Sound, will I bypass PulseAudio?  I know PulseAudio is widely disliked, but I assume it's there for a reason.
2009-06-22T03:55:00.000Z	tiyowan_	MattCampbell	Yep - change the settings to ALSA
2009-06-22T03:58:00.000Z	tiyowan_	MattCampbell	Because PulseAudio is the default. Change it.
