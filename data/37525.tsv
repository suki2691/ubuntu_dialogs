2010-02-10T20:09:00.000Z	textchimp	KE1HA	that's all part of one bluetooth connection, or several?
2010-02-10T20:10:00.000Z	KE1HA	textchimp	just one key on the box, and it controls both the mouse and keyboard.
2010-02-10T20:12:00.000Z	KE1HA	textchimp	im not promoting brands or anything, but Fisby was the only one I could find that guaranteed to work with Linux
