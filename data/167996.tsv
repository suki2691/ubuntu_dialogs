2011-04-30T16:02:00.000Z	d3vlin		how can I manually start the unity dock? I only have an empty desktop now with cursor
2011-04-30T16:03:00.000Z	jubei	d3vlin	 I have the same problem
2011-04-30T16:08:00.000Z	d3vlin	jubei	a unity --reset and logging out/back in solved it for me
2011-04-30T16:09:00.000Z	jubei	d3vlin	the thing is that I've deleted my boost libraries and upgraded to the latest version of boost and how compiz is looking for libboost1.42.0 :(
