2009-10-27T13:02:00.000Z	vtec_		What is a linux shell? Basically a command?
2009-10-27T13:02:00.000Z	ziroday	vtec_	Synaptic lists every application (including libraries and *-dev packages) whilst Add/Remove only lists applications. If you're not sure use Add/Remove
2009-10-27T13:02:00.000Z	ziroday	vtec_	as for the linux shell, its similar to the windows or mac shell, its a command line :)
