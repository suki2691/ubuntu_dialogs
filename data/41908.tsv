2010-03-05T01:57:00.000Z	markit		hi, I need to install ubuntu in one pc, configure it with packages I need, and then replicate the config in other 10 pc, which is the best way? (pc hardware is different, i.e. different hd size, cpu, etc)

2010-03-05T01:58:00.000Z	markit	SpaceGhostC2C	but I have also to configure the programs / environment
2010-03-05T01:59:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	markit	then try saving the configs. usually located in ~/.<programname> or in /etc/
