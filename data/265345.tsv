2004-09-27T13:17:00.000Z	suburbanite_fury		Will it be possible to perpetually upgrade Ubuntu releases, just like one can upgrade Debian 3.0 to 3.1?
2004-09-27T13:17:00.000Z	LoneTech	suburbanite_fury	surely possible, but I wonder if it'll be obvious in the interface. it isn't in xandros.
2004-09-27T13:18:00.000Z	suburbanite_fury	LoneTech	The reason I ask is because in Fedora it's basically not supported to upgrade with apt/yum; they recommend a complete reinstall.
2004-09-27T13:19:00.000Z	LoneTech	suburbanite_fury	yeah, but that isn't debian based. it has basically no concept of upgrading configurations.
