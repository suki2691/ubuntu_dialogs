2008-03-14T09:19:00.000Z	Hamled		I compiled my own kernel, so I couldn't install the proprietary nvidia drivers through the restricted drivers manager application (says I need to have linux-restricted-modules-2.6.24.2-mykernel, which doesn't exist obviously), so I used envy to install the drivers, but now I can't select custom settings in the appearance configuration, to use compiz, is there any workaround?
2008-03-14T09:20:00.000Z	saikor	Hamled	can't select or doesn't appear?
2008-03-14T09:21:00.000Z	Hamled	saikor	I can select it, but it prompts me to enable the restricted drivers, and when I select yes, it overwrites the custom-compiled ones with stock ones for a different kernel (2.6.22-14) that don't work at all, and x falls back to vesa
2008-03-14T09:22:00.000Z	Hamled	saikor	thanks anyways :)
