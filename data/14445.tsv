2011-05-18T03:18:00.000Z	adam61		i just reinstalled ubuntu 11.04 and followed some instructions to install alsa firmware and tascam drivers, but instead of adding the tascam, it erased both. when i do cat /proc/asound/card it returns nothing. any help is greatly appreciated

2011-05-18T03:20:00.000Z	adam61	celthunder	here (minus the third step): https://help.ubuntu.com/community/TASCAM_US-122  and here: http://monespaceperso.org/blog-en/2010/05/02/upgrade-alsa-1-0-23-on-ubuntu-lucid-lynx-10-04/
2011-05-18T03:24:00.000Z	adam61	celthunder	ooops lol... i know for sure based on past installations that the first link is at least mostly good. the second i hadn't tried till now and it was looking good until the test came back negative for soundcards
