2009-04-25T20:01:00.000Z	Leenucks		Hi all, I installed jaunty on my previous version 8.10 and seems to have a problem with video... any video player crashes on opening file and when I scroll down any webpage it seems to rewrite every single move..
2009-04-25T20:01:00.000Z	Leenucks		anyone can help?
2009-04-25T20:01:00.000Z	roxan	Leenucks	do you have intel board?
2009-04-25T20:02:00.000Z	roxan	Leenucks	seems like you need to revert the graphics to 8.10
