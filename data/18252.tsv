2011-02-14T02:21:00.000Z	Logan_WP	andycc	right click channel, settings, hide join/part messages
2011-02-14T02:21:00.000Z	andycc	Logan_WP	thanks, that worked. (at least for one channel)
2011-02-14T02:22:00.000Z	Logan_WP	andycc	you can also set it globally in settings-->preferences-->advanced-->hide join/part messages
