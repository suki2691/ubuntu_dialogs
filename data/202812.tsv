2006-04-03T14:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	timfrost	nice - did you just add that?
2006-04-03T14:39:00.000Z	timfrost	Madpilot	no.  Not sure when that was added (by cafuego?), but it has been there a while because of thew number of people caught by broken sudo after expert installs.  I just remembered it in the context of the problem that brammator describes
2006-04-03T14:39:00.000Z	Madpilot	timfrost	yeah, I wish I'd know about that tell a few days ago, we had about three people in a row who'd broken their sudo...
