2009-02-23T07:57:00.000Z	tlacaelel		do you need to completely re-install the system when the new ubuntu gets released, or does it "upgrade"?
2009-02-23T07:58:00.000Z	tlacaelel		so it's better to install ubuntu onto it's own partition & keep media etc. on a different partition
2009-02-23T08:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tlacaelel	thats what i do.... windwos gets 30gigs, ubuntu / gets 30gigs, then 100gigs or so is simply for movies, music, pics, etc, that is shared between the two.
