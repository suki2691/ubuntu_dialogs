2007-03-16T05:03:00.000Z	kupesoft	Kyral	dhclient3 on debian/ubuntu AFAIK
2007-03-16T05:03:00.000Z	Kyral	kupesoft	*shrug* Last I knew dhcpcd also worked
2007-03-16T05:34:00.000Z	kupesoft	Kyral	I beleive dhcpcd's name was changed to dhclient to prevent the server (dhcpd) from being mixed up with the client (dhcpcd).
