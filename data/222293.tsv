2005-09-18T09:20:00.000Z	carlos_		anybody help, I'm trying to compile some drivers for a modem but after ./configure when I do make I receive some errors I do not understand
2005-09-18T09:22:00.000Z	intelikey	carlos_	the configure exits cleanly ?
2005-09-18T09:29:00.000Z	intelikey	carlos_	how old is this package ?     it looks to me like the problem is in the way gcc handles the code.   like it was written for a very earily gcc maybe.      any chance of finding a newer package ?
2005-09-18T09:32:00.000Z	intelikey	carlos_	well the question is not ubuntu specific it is a compile error.   you might have someone in #linuxhelp  or #c++   or someplace have a look at the error.
