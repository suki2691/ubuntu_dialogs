2010-10-22T02:04:00.000Z	ftornell		question: have a wifi card (Dlink DWA140 that only works when I use "sudo rmmod rt2800usb") I have to do that every time I boot the computer. Is there anyway of removing that completely so I don't have to manually do the removal every single time?

2010-10-22T02:06:00.000Z	ftornell	ActionParsnip	add the module? i want to remove that module so my d-link works...they collide!
