2008-04-05T22:59:00.000Z	orkun	Studiosus	i am pretty sure that sbackup does that
2008-04-05T23:00:00.000Z	orkun	Studiosus	it creates a list of all packages installed at least
2008-04-05T23:00:00.000Z	orkun	Studiosus	and by default settings does not backup things like /usr - but you should google it
