Similar to cryptsetup which creates an encrypted blockdevice at /dev/mapper/soandso based on an existing blockdevice. Doing that on top of ftp or ssh so that the encryption happens on the client would let you store sensitive data on hosts you dont trust.

2009-05-05T18:31:00.000Z	narnarnar	grawity	sshfs doesnt store the data encrypted on the host, right?
