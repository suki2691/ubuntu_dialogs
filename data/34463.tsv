2011-06-13T01:42:00.000Z	robinabo		how do you view your encryption pass-phrase? I just installed ubuntu and I pressed cancel before I could write it down
2011-06-13T01:44:00.000Z	robinabo		so, how do you view your encryption pass-phrase?
2011-06-13T01:45:00.000Z	aj00200	robinabo	I'm not aware of any way to see that. I get the felling that it must be stored somewhere encrypted by your password, but I don't know how to get it.
