2008-07-07T08:12:00.000Z	Mana|Ubuntu		Anyone here know how to set up dual monitors (I have an 8800GTS)? I used envy and nvidia-settings, and I can see stuff at the proper resolutons on both monitors, but when I maximize stuff, I want it to just show up on the main monitor, and I only want my desktop on one monitor.

Take a look at compizconfig-settings-manager to see if it has an option for configuring that, otherwise you'll have to use another window manager (or many play around with xinerama settings in X11 since compiz should be xinerama-aware)
