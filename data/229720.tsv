2006-11-06T08:01:00.000Z	skittz04		Looking for some assistance setting up 6.10 with multiple monitors -- not the usual questions though - the live CD won't work with my video card (Nvidia FX 5200) , so I think I need to do a manual install -- do I use the alterntive install CD for that, or do I throw switches on the live cd ?
