2007-06-21T13:44:00.000Z	intangir		but id like to do it on linux (from a live CD or something)
2007-06-21T13:44:00.000Z	intangir		want it to be restorable exactly if needed
2007-06-21T13:44:00.000Z	RoC_MM	intangir	although it's proprietary, I have had great success with the proprietary and commercial Acronis True Image v10.  Windows is fragile and all the other things I tried did not result in a working system after restore.
