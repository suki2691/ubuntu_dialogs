2008-11-01T00:34:00.000Z	_Carrie_		is there anyway to check if I'm updated to Ibex? I've just done updates but there was no mention of a new distribution.
2008-11-01T00:35:00.000Z	BikgerGeek	_Carrie_	 I had to go into the preferences and enable the update checker to check for new releases.  If it upgraded it should have taken quite a while to do it.
2008-11-01T00:36:00.000Z	_Carrie_	BikgerGeek	ok, thanks I'll poke around and see if I can find it (Not finding it where you said it was)
2008-11-01T00:37:00.000Z	_Carrie_	BikgerGeek	I see "Show new distribution releases: Long Term Support Releases Only" but I'm not getting informed via Updates Manager about the new release :(
