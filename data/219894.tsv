2008-07-14T04:53:00.000Z	_xyz		can I dual boot xp and ubuntu by installing ubuntu + grub loader on a new separate drive and setting it as the primary HDD boot device? (that way the old XP HDD would be untouched)

2008-07-14T04:54:00.000Z	Flannel	_xyz	Correct
2008-07-14T04:56:00.000Z	Flannel	_xyz	Thats true.  You may need to modify the grub config slightly to get windows to boot happily.  come back here and ask about grub mapping if you do have that problem.
