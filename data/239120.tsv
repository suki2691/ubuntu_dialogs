2008-12-20T12:31:00.000Z	cyphase		I have a problem that started with one of my hard drives and is now affecting another.. whenever i do something that takes more than about 8 MB/s of throughput, the entire computer begins to freeze up.. the faster  the data is being read of written, the worse it is
2008-12-20T12:31:00.000Z	cyphase		or written* .. does anyone know what might be wrong and how to fix it?
