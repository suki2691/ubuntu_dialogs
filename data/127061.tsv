2008-09-14T08:03:00.000Z	Ashkore		I have a Playstation 3 and I got both the Ubuntu desktop/server CD's via the mail how would I go about installing Ubuntu on it?

2008-09-14T08:05:00.000Z	vocx	Ashkore	I've never installed Ubuntu on any console, so I don't know the exact steps to follow. But I'm pretty sure you'll find guides at ubuntuforums.org It can't be that hard.
