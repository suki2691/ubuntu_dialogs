2009-10-24T21:20:00.000Z	evilaim		Heres a question for you all... I have data on an drive formatted to ext4, but it's only 75% full.  I want to make this drive ext3.  Should I format that to ext3, move as much data over as I can from the ext4 -> ext3 then then expand the ext3 as large as I can and keep doing it till the drive is fully ext3?
