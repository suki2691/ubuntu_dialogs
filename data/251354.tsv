2007-12-31T23:12:00.000Z	r3m0t	RoxanneEDM	if your destination disc is large enough, yes
2007-12-31T23:13:00.000Z	r3m0t	RoxanneEDM	if you're running ubuntu, you will need to run it in wine. works well though
2007-12-31T23:14:00.000Z	r3m0t	RoxanneEDM	you asked for the best. dvdshrink is simple and works well for me
