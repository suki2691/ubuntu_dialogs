2012-08-21T19:09:00.000Z	schoppenhauer		hello. recently, xubuntu (precise) complains that it cannot download http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/precise-updates/universe/binary-amd64/Packages, so automatic updates fail. this file apparently does not exist, but a Packages.gz exists. Is there any solution to this?

2012-08-21T19:11:00.000Z	schoppenhauer	epinky	the file does not exist in us.archive.ubuntu.com as well
2012-08-21T19:11:00.000Z	epinky	schoppenhauer	you'll have to look for it
