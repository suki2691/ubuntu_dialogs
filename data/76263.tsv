2010-01-09T10:07:00.000Z	Izinucs		I've added another partition to fstab and mounted it.. I want to make sure that when it auto mounts it's "read/write" capable.. fstab line looks like "UUID="7d4a2d7f-aee9-4dfa-bb47-76314a1acf79"     /media/Data     ext4    defaults        0       2
2010-01-09T10:07:00.000Z	Izinucs		.. do I need to add anything else to the line?
2010-01-09T10:08:00.000Z	Hammerjak	Izinucs	that looks good to me
2010-01-09T10:09:00.000Z	Izinucs	Hammerjak	Awesome3000   however I can't copy anything to it.. How do I check the owner and permissions?
