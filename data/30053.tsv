2010-06-19T07:09:00.000Z	MournGrym		I have a triple boot system 2 ubuntu and 1 windows 7 if I use gparted to delete one of the ubuntu partitions and merge them will it mess up the boot sequence and or grub loader?

2010-06-19T07:11:00.000Z	mmomjian	MournGrym	10.04... can you post a screenshot of gparted? do you know what that is?
