2007-06-22T15:58:00.000Z	crabgrass	axiom	 i have no idea, but why do you need/want to do that?
2007-06-22T15:59:00.000Z	axiom	crabgrass	make use of address space that isn't addressed
2007-06-22T15:59:00.000Z	axiom	crabgrass	there are some kernels (often mandrake kernels) that when you boot, there followed a user-defined RAM map, I wonder how it's done
