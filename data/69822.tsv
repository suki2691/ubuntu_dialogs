2009-07-02T00:59:00.000Z	Barridus	xnox	depends heavily on the speed of the device (like one flash drive etc can be tons faster than another)
2009-07-02T00:59:00.000Z	Barridus	xnox	also depends on what the file(s) is.  one huge file is faster than several smaller ones
2009-07-02T01:00:00.000Z	xnox	Barridus	Ubuntu installation =) so many small ones
