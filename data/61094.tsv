2009-04-02T13:17:00.000Z	fungin	magnetron	but it won't launch svn command
2009-04-02T13:18:00.000Z	fungin	magnetron	when I launch it manually it works ok, but cron stucks on svn command, what's more I have >> results of svn update to a file and though the script is launched the log file I have created is empty
