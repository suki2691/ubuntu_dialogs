2010-04-27T08:47:00.000Z	Izinucs	gp5st	try 0000
2010-04-27T08:48:00.000Z	gp5st	Izinucs	when i paired it a few mins ago it gave me some random number 3375... and i'm setting up gammu and i thought that was the pin i needed?
2010-04-27T08:48:00.000Z	Izinucs	gp5st	maybe.. it was just a guess on my part
