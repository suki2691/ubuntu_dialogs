2008-10-22T04:28:00.000Z	Miesco		Is there a program to get a section of an image and save it as a new image?
2008-10-22T04:28:00.000Z	LjL	Miesco	the GIMP can do that... or do you want one that does it without any user intervention?
2008-10-22T04:29:00.000Z	Miesco	LjL	Well I want to make a rectangle border around something in the image as well
2008-10-22T04:30:00.000Z	LjL	Miesco	the GIMP can do that too.
