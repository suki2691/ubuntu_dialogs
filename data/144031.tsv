2007-03-04T11:41:00.000Z	lufis	reanjr	sudo chown owner directory
2007-03-04T11:43:00.000Z	lufis	reanjr	and you may need to make it recursive ... sudo chown -R owner directory
2007-03-04T11:44:00.000Z	reanjr	lufis	what I mean is I have a directory with owner dirguy:dirguys and a user userguy who belongs to dirguys group.  When userguy creates a file in dirguys I want the owner of that file to be dirguy:dirguys
