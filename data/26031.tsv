2010-09-17T01:51:00.000Z	Ganesh_R		Hi Are there any ubuntu applications to access Exchange 2007?
2010-09-17T01:52:00.000Z	warflyr	Ganesh_R	is firefox connecting to outlook web access an acceptable answer? :)
2010-09-17T01:53:00.000Z	warflyr	Ganesh_R	im pretty sure any application other than outlook or win mobile active sync uses OWA to connect to exchange;
2010-09-17T01:53:00.000Z	Ganesh_R	warflyr	Unfortunately not :( I use too much email to rely on OWA
