2008-03-17T06:18:00.000Z	crotte		Hi, I justed installed ubuntu and the apps are start slowly. So I ran hdparm to verify my hard disk speed: Timing buffered disk reads:   10 MB in  3.05 seconds =   3.28 MB/sec is this fast enought?
2008-03-17T06:18:00.000Z	Fryguy--	crotte	that is very very slow
2008-03-17T06:19:00.000Z	Fryguy--	crotte	possibly
2008-03-17T06:20:00.000Z	Fryguy--	crotte	my drive does read speeds of around 250MB/s
