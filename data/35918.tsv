2011-01-31T03:06:00.000Z	Mathuin		I need to install some packages from Natty on my Ubuntu Netbook Edition.  How do I do this?  I'm in a class on Arduinos, and the stuff in the repo didn't work. :-(
2011-01-31T03:08:00.000Z	Mathuin		Can someone point me at how to install Natty packages on UNE 10.10?  It's kinda urgent as I'm in a class. :-(
