2005-06-05T08:41:00.000Z	uc50_ic4more		folks, i have spent about 2 days now with my first install of Ubuntu and love it - so much so that I would like to convert some friends, family and clients... However, I know a few people who are very, very fond of Microsoft's Picture Manager utility that comes w/ Office 2003... Does anyone know of a GUI program for *NIX that kinda sorta does what Picture Manager does?
