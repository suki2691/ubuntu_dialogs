2006-10-15T14:30:00.000Z	LinuXubuntu		hi you guys! I'm a newbie! And I need a little help. I've been using Xubuntu for just a few days, and that is the situation: I have to HDs and I'd like to know how to config Xubuntu do detect and mount my Slave HD automatically. Does anybody can help me? Thanks for the attention.
