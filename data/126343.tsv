2007-10-20T13:30:00.000Z	PriitM		Has anyone else problems with CPU usage in 7.10? Mine is between 50-75% and i only got sys monitor,gnome, gmail notify and pidgin running
2007-10-20T13:30:00.000Z	crshman	PriitM	i have issues with CPU usage
2007-10-20T13:31:00.000Z	crshman		i have no idea why, i think it has to do with my kernel though
2007-10-20T13:36:00.000Z	PriitM	crshman	perhaps it's just a bug - my cpu usage is ~90%, but temperatures are fairly cool and cpu utilization is on 45%(Cool'N'Quiet)
