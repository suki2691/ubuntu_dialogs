2010-01-12T23:12:00.000Z	nibbler	ubuntu	can that not be done with the usb startup disk creator (system->administration)?
2010-01-12T23:13:00.000Z	ubuntu	nibbler	what would the best way to create an installation where programs could be added/removed and files stored permanently?
2010-01-12T23:14:00.000Z	nibbler	ubuntu	for the files there is a slider in that program. about programs i dont know. basically you can install ubuntu to any media, just use a usb stick instead of a harddisk, or follow http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-mini/Hard-Disk-Upgrade.html to transfer an existing installation
