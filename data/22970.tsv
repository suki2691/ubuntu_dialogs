2010-11-08T01:41:00.000Z	Firartix		Hey... silly question... i tried installing flash both through the package manager (along with the firefox plugin package) and through the in-browser installation stuff, but it doesn't seem to do anything
2010-11-08T01:41:00.000Z	Firartix		is there some step i could've missed or done wrong?
2010-11-08T01:41:00.000Z	plantsVSme	Firartix	where u installing while the browser was open?
2010-11-08T01:42:00.000Z	plantsVSme	Firartix	and did u restart after installation
