2006-08-15T13:57:00.000Z	carrus85		Anyone know where I can look to see if my mouse is even being detected anymore?  (So I can determine if X is at fault or if something else has broken)...
2006-08-15T13:58:00.000Z	argument	carrus85	cat /dev/input/mice
2006-08-15T13:58:00.000Z	argument	carrus85	move your mouse, if you get funny chars your mouse is detected
2006-08-15T13:58:00.000Z	carrus85	argument	I've already tried that, nothing is actually printed...
