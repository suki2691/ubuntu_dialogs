2010-05-29T19:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	deostroll	the apt session locks the packages so multiple parograms cannot access the same packages and cause possible issues
2010-05-29T19:12:00.000Z	deostroll	ActionParsnip	i realize that...but isn't there any program which handle all the installs the correct way, but allow multiple download sessions...?
