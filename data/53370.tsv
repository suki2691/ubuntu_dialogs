2009-07-01T02:08:00.000Z	tel0s	ThePulgarcito	i love the cleanliness and keybindability of openbox, so something along those lines with tiling please.
2009-07-01T02:11:00.000Z	ThePulgarcito	tel0s	Most of the differences between tiling WMs is in the language they use for configs. Wmii uses bash,s so it's pretty easy to understand and pick up, but Awesome is nice if you know lua, and openbox has the "Poor man's Tiling" somewhere.
