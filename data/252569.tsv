2006-03-23T16:17:00.000Z	baquero22		what is that issue a python??
2006-03-23T16:18:00.000Z	HappyFool	baquero22	that means run the command 'python setup.py' -- 'as root' means you need to run it using sudo
2006-03-23T16:20:00.000Z	HappyFool	baquero22	i'd recommend investigating checkinstall before installing non-ubuntu software
