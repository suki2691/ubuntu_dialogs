2006-04-10T05:18:00.000Z	Steveire		I installed lots of useful stuff on fedora. Will I have the same available if I install ubuntu?
2006-04-10T05:19:00.000Z	IdleOne	Steveire	packages.ubuntu.com to search for the stuff you want
2006-04-10T05:19:00.000Z	IdleOne	Steveire	I guess it is :)
2006-04-10T05:20:00.000Z	IdleOne	Steveire	there are over 18000 packages there so you prolly find what you want
