2007-07-02T08:06:00.000Z	shiester_mieste	Bob_le_Pointu	people USE sauerbraten?
2007-07-02T08:06:00.000Z	shiester_mieste	Bob_le_Pointu	i thought it was just a little experimental graphics engine
2007-07-02T08:06:00.000Z	Bob_le_Pointu	shiester_mieste	I was planning to use it, but it's quite unplayable with ATI cards.
