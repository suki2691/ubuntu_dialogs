2009-11-17T21:45:00.000Z	LeonBrussels		Is there anyway I can dist-upgrade with the normal install CD?
2009-11-17T21:45:00.000Z	Halitech	LeonBrussels	no
2009-11-17T21:46:00.000Z	LeonBrussels	Halitech	But the packages are on there somewhere, there has to be some way to get them off there? I am willing to jump through hoops...
