2008-03-05T13:34:00.000Z	xeer		im on a live cd right now,  7.10 and im trying to get this installed on my fakeraid. problem i'm having is that dmraid does not recognize my drives as a raid. i want to retrieve the raid meta info manually but fdisk (-u -l /dev/sda) says it can't open the device. the partition manage reads it fine though. what could be wrong?
