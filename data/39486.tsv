2010-04-23T03:20:00.000Z	Razion		I installed an application...And now I have no idea where it is. Is there a way to search for it?
2010-04-23T03:22:00.000Z	Losha	Razion	go to /var/cache/apt/archive and find the deb package for the application. Is it there?
2010-04-23T03:24:00.000Z	Losha	Razion	run dpkg -contents on the deb package. Look for anything with bin in the path...
2010-04-23T03:25:00.000Z	Losha	Razion	run dpkg --contents <package>  <-- two dashes. Look for anything with bin in the path...
