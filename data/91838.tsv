2010-10-16T13:49:00.000Z	cfenix		hello everyone, i need some help with the "grub"
2010-10-16T13:51:00.000Z	cfenix		sorry about that, i'm new here.. the thing is that every time that i update ubuntu (the kernel) it add a new version in the list of the grub instead of just change it
2010-10-16T13:51:00.000Z	lucent	cfenix	I notice that also
2010-10-16T13:52:00.000Z	lucent	cfenix	running 'sudo update-grub' does it
