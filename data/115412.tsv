2009-08-12T22:37:00.000Z	frostburn	arcanez	yes, you can use the command dd for that
2009-08-12T22:38:00.000Z	arcanez	frostburn	is there docs on that?
2009-08-12T22:39:00.000Z	frostburn	arcanez	man dd otherwise google it, there's plenty out there, just be careful of your arguments as you might inadvertently destroy your disk
