2009-04-24T22:55:00.000Z	yoasif	Travis-42	what settings?
2009-04-24T22:56:00.000Z	Travis-42	yoasif	I was thinking of things like how long it stays on the screen.  I have 3 monitors, and so sometimes it takes me a brief moment to even notice.  by then, the message is already disappearing before I can read it.
