2012-10-23T07:32:00.000Z	orlok		I am installing Ubuntu 10.04 LTS - In the installer, it shows there being 7 steps
2012-10-23T07:33:00.000Z	orlok		However, it jumps from Step 5 (Account details) to Step 7 (Ready to Install)
2012-10-23T07:33:00.000Z	crimsonmane	orlok	there is an "alternate installer" that works well if the normal installer has issues.
2012-10-23T07:34:00.000Z	orlok	crimsonmane	 it installs fine, its just i'm documenting each step for our auditors, and wondering where the hell step 6 is :)
