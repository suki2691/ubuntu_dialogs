2007-04-12T11:12:00.000Z	farruinn	somafm	open gconf-editor, go to /apps/nautilus/desktop/and deselect volumes_visible
2007-04-12T11:13:00.000Z	farruinn	somafm	gconf-editor may not be in the applications menu, you may have to open it with ctrl+f2
2007-04-12T11:13:00.000Z	farruinn	somafm	The option might also be configurable from within Nautilus preferences
