2012-01-21T04:55:00.000Z	murfie	RiotingPacifist_	but I use LTS
2012-01-21T04:57:00.000Z	RiotingPacifist_	murfie	a kernel upgrade will not change your usefacing apps at all, if you want newer apps/unity you need to upgrade the install (e.g 10.4->11.10) i'm not suggesting that, just saying that messing with your kernel is unlikely to help
