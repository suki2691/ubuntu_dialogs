2012-01-16T19:33:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne		Is there any way to use GNOME 2.0 on Ubuntu 11.04 or later distro which comes with Unity by default? (I'm not an unity fan.. no offense)
2012-01-16T19:33:00.000Z	robinduckett	Bruce_Wayne	no, just use Gnome 3
2012-01-16T19:33:00.000Z	robinduckett		sudo apt-get install gnome-shell
2012-01-16T19:35:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne	robinduckett	I don't like GNOME 3.0 much either.. :(  I like standard gnome which came till Ubuntu 10.10.. which's support is expiring on the release of 12.04 ... & I'm very much confused on the road ahead.
