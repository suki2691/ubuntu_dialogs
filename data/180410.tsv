2006-09-19T11:02:00.000Z	nox-Hand		with flashplayer, what fonts should be installed? I cant see the MTV Music Awards flash text :(
2006-09-19T11:04:00.000Z	Psychobudgie	nox-Hand	 be aware that a lot of more recent flash movies and sites use flash 8 or 9 which do odd things like not showing text, no pictures but audio and the opposite
2006-09-19T11:05:00.000Z	nox-Hand	Psychobudgie	Yeah :(
