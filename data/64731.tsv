2010-12-17T00:17:00.000Z	detrix42		I am trying to find a way to convert docx to odt  I have tried to get odf-converter, but the links to the page to get it are no longer valid.
2010-12-17T00:17:00.000Z	detrix42		is there another way to do this?
2010-12-17T00:17:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	detrix42	i ran into problems with docx earlier this month - had to get the origional creator to re-save as a doc, before open/libre-office would do it.
2010-12-17T00:18:00.000Z	detrix42	ZykoticK9	ok.
