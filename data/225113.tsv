2005-08-07T12:09:00.000Z	Sighkick		Amaranth : so, do you suggest I give up or go the hard route and go to www.alsa-project.org?  No...never compiled anything other than basic and C about a million years ago
2005-08-07T12:09:00.000Z	Razor-X	Sighkick	I don't think compiling ALSA will get you anything
2005-08-07T12:10:00.000Z	Sighkick	Razor-X	: they do have sound card drivers and found one for the other card I have ESS1868F... but didnt know how to proceed
2005-08-07T12:10:00.000Z	Razor-X	Sighkick	is it an ALSA patch, or Kernel patch or something?
