But a DVD-R will hold about 6 times the amount of data (about 4.3GB) that a CD-R will hold, so they aren't interchangeable and the contents of a DVD simply won't fit on a CD

2009-06-03T06:26:00.000Z	losher	bert1	if its a CD blank, the maximum content is about 750M. If it's a DVD blank, the maximum is about 4.3GB. There are dual-layer DVD blanks that will hold about 8.6GB. They are not interchangeable. You must buy the correct kind of blanks, and also your burner must support the kind you buy. To hold 6.4GB you'd need a single DVD-dual, or a pair of DVD-Rs, or about 8 CD-Rs
