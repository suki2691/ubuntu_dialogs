2006-10-03T13:46:00.000Z	Jowi	morbid88_ghost	depends on the modem and where you live. you don't dial but need to configure the connection. Try pppoeconf
2006-10-03T13:47:00.000Z	morbid88_ghost	Jowi	isn't pppoeconf for modems and dial-up?
2006-10-03T13:47:00.000Z	Jowi	morbid88_ghost	dsl modems. some cable modems use the same connection type
