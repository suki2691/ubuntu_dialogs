2006-12-26T08:57:00.000Z	wizard		Hey all.  I just got an HP Officejet 5610 for Christmas.  It prints fine, but Xsane doesn't detect it as a scanner.  I also don't know how to set it up as a fax in openoffice.  After I follow the fax config settings, it asks for a command line to communicate with my device.  I don't know where to find/learn this...  Any help is appreciated.
