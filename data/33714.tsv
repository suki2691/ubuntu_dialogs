2011-09-30T12:13:00.000Z	Sulejman		hi, I have a question. I've been using irssi IRC client lately, set on my friend's computer. Have been connecting to the session using PuTTy. However, I've quit from irssi and cannot get back. when I type /screen -r [screenadress] I shows I've got 2 screens attached. Don't know what to do. Could you help me?
