2011-03-07T04:48:00.000Z	Muelli	thesaucypauper	boot from pretty much any medium and do a "grub-install"
2011-03-07T04:49:00.000Z	thesaucypauper	Muelli	how exactly do i do that? do i put that in the command line when it says "Error: file not found" "grub>"
2011-03-07T04:50:00.000Z	Muelli	thesaucypauper	check the interwebs. googling for "grub-install" revealed http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/Installing-GRUB-using-grub_002dinstall.html
