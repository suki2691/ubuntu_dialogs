2007-09-05T09:20:00.000Z	MrDeadLock		I want to setup a server. File/Media possibly even a website. Would ubuntu server work well? Would it be better to start off with say XCFE or just stick with CLI.

2007-09-05T09:26:00.000Z	neverblue	MrDeadLock	you can always setup the gdm/kdm later, if you miss the GUI
