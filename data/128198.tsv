2008-03-11T06:13:00.000Z	Optimus55	kanuha	i use it. it works. though it doesnt seem to want to connect to networks with WEP
2008-03-11T06:14:00.000Z	kanuha	Optimus55	I am on the road all day and connect to free wifi, but I have a wep enabled network at home. Do you recommend wifi radar?
2008-03-11T06:15:00.000Z	Optimus55	kanuha	sure. download it and give it a shot. i have wpa supplicant installed, but it still doesnt want to connect to wep for me. test it out. you may have different results
