2007-06-03T11:09:00.000Z	FFighter		Guys, I just downloaded Acrobat Reader in the form of a tar.gz, however, it has come with a mime type of plain text and I can't manage to open it (it tries to open it using gedit)
2007-06-03T11:09:00.000Z	FFighter		Is there a way to fix it ?
2007-06-03T11:10:00.000Z	p1ls	FFighter	did you uncompress it?
