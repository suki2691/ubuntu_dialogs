2011-03-13T15:36:00.000Z	Note-book		Im trying to install my Ricoh webcam on my HP Dv6000 using these instructions: https://launchpad.net/~r5u87x-loader/+archive/ppa...........everything works fine but when I follow the last step it says: cd: 78: can't cd to r5u87x......I tried googling but no one else seems to have this problem :(
2011-03-13T15:36:00.000Z	Note-book		is there something wrong with my connection? :(
2011-03-13T15:36:00.000Z	Note-book		how come everyone's quiet again? :/
