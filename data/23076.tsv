2011-01-30T23:27:00.000Z	Ugons		Question: I'm on OS X as of now and I don't feel like partitioning my HD. I want to get an external HD to install ubuntu on, but I'm not sure which would be best. Any suggestions?

2011-01-30T23:30:00.000Z	Ugons		So basically you can boot Ubuntu from any computer if you have the external HD with you?
