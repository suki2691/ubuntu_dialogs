2008-10-25T11:57:00.000Z	Smegzor		I'm about to back up my root by copying it.  I'm skipping home, mnt, media.  Are there any other folders I do not want to include in my backup?  My home is in a different partition.
2008-10-25T11:58:00.000Z	jim_p	Smegzor	i suggest fstab, xorg.conf, menu.lst and any specific one you may need like samba or network interfaces
2008-10-25T11:58:00.000Z	jim_p	Smegzor	all the others are trivial in front of these 3
2008-10-25T11:59:00.000Z	jim_p	Smegzor	and sources.list ! 4 then
