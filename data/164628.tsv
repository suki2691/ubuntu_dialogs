2009-02-10T07:00:00.000Z	K`zan		How can I get ahold of the 2.6.27.11 kernel that comes with 8.10 in 8.04 - my new MB resources are not in the 8.04 kernel.  I do NOT want to go to KDE4 nor gnome.  TMIA!
2009-02-10T07:01:00.000Z	K`zan		I did get the latest kernel from kernel.org and built it, but evidentally the ubuntu patches are not in it :-(.
2009-02-10T07:01:00.000Z	pike__	K`zan	might still be on packages.ubuntu.com
2009-02-10T07:01:00.000Z	K`zan	pike__	 Thanks, checking.
