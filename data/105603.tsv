2008-01-24T20:01:00.000Z	XiXaQ		I have an internal harddisk, and an external one. I want to install ubuntu onto the external one so that it's bootable when I take the internal one out. This means I have to install grub on the external one, right? Or will it still be dependent on the MBR on the internal disk?

2008-01-24T20:03:00.000Z	lettuc3	XiXaQ	i should know, that's what i'm doing right now :P.
