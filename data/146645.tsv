2007-08-10T10:45:00.000Z	BigToe7000		bear in mind I've just started downloading the live CD and it'll be a while until I actually install it
2007-08-10T10:46:00.000Z	Falstius	BigToe7000	it is either noacpi or acpi=off in the kernel options.
2007-08-10T10:48:00.000Z	BigToe7000	Falstius	if I put noacpi and acpi=off will it generate an error or just ignore the one that doesn't work?
