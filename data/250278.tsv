2005-04-18T06:55:00.000Z	_ReDRuM_		n/m i think its a kubuntu thing
2005-04-18T06:56:00.000Z	_ReDRuM_		why not when i built mozilla by hand i could remove it whenever i felt like :P its a user dir shouldnt matter...
2005-04-18T06:57:00.000Z	apokryphos	_ReDRuM_	wouldn't matter because it's a user dir? =) I agree that it should replace it, (kde does so with .kde) but I don't quite know what mozzy is like
