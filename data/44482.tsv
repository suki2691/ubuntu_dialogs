2009-11-21T19:28:00.000Z	Daremonai		hello... I just bought a 2 TB HD, and I am just wondering how i should format it, and to what format? ext3 or ext4?
2009-11-21T19:30:00.000Z	Daremonai		well i have 6 HDs other than that one.. they're all in ext3 format
2009-11-21T19:30:00.000Z	Daremonai		don't feel like formatting the others to ext4... so i was wondering if i should put that as ext3 or 4...
