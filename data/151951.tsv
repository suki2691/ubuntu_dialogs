2007-01-08T16:08:00.000Z	fuffal0		i've got another computer with onboard video, and it's got *extremely* laggy video in X, i assume it has the wrong driver - but i dont know what kind of onboard video it is - any ideas?
2007-01-08T16:09:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	fuffal0	the xorg log reports it all - but I can't remember where I saw it earlier today :(
2007-01-08T16:10:00.000Z	fuffal0	IntuitiveNipple	- i think it's using the wrong driver tho and i don't know what/how to tell it otherwise
