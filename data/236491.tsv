2005-12-04T12:38:00.000Z	jason0_		Trying to install apani vpn client, I can get it to compile (with some modifying of CC enviorment variables) but when I execute insmod I get an error complaining that its an invalid format. dmesg says: version maigc 2.6.12-9-i386 gcc-4.0 should be 2.6.12-9-386 gcc-3.4
2005-12-04T12:39:00.000Z	jason0_		any ideas?
2005-12-04T12:41:00.000Z	jason0_		Can I install gcc-3.4 using synaptic?
