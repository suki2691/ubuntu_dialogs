2007-01-28T06:33:00.000Z	Bridawg		I'm trying to load the 6.10 liveCD but after the ubuntu loading screen all I get is flashing coloured lines.  I have an nvidia card if that is important, ut even safe graphics mode gives me bizzarre lines.  all the things I've found only work once ubuntu is installed.  any ideas?
2007-01-28T06:34:00.000Z	Bridawg		that's what I'm trying to do ubuntu1
