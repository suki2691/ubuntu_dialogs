2005-11-07T13:42:00.000Z	johnw		i have seriously jacked myself.  /etc/sudoers somehow changed owners to root:named and now no sudo command works.  I can't even delete the user named because sudo doesn't work.  HELP! sudo su doesn't work either
2005-11-07T13:43:00.000Z	johnw		ok
2005-11-07T13:43:00.000Z	johnw		i'll be back
