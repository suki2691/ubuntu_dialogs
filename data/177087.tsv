2006-06-22T10:24:00.000Z	roland-erau		anyone feel like helping me configure dual-head?
2006-06-22T10:24:00.000Z	KenSentMe	roland-erau	just tell us what you problem is, and maybe someone can help
2006-06-22T10:25:00.000Z	roland-erau	KenSentMe	and everyone else, fresh ubuntu install. i'm highly confident in my xorg.conf (talking to you from a rhel dual-head now). "nv" drivers don't seem to do it in any configuration.
2006-06-22T10:26:00.000Z	roland-erau	KenSentMe	rdz, i've installed the more current "nvidia" drivers using the nvidia driver installation tool and made the appropriate changes to xorg.conf, however gdm throws errors and says it can't find the "nvidia" driver
