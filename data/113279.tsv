2010-10-15T23:32:00.000Z	jonathan		but I read a few places that if the passwords were the same, gnome would automatically enter the keyring password for you

2010-10-15T23:34:00.000Z	jonathan	hiku	that's what I thought, I just saw a few people in the forums claiming that's what happened.  I guess I'll stick with the annoyance for the added security
