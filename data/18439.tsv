2011-02-05T16:36:00.000Z	DanielParker		anyone: how can I backup my printer-settings+drivers?
2011-02-05T16:37:00.000Z	mkanyicy	DanielParker	why would you want to do that?
2011-02-05T16:38:00.000Z	DanielParker	mkanyicy	I want to because it was a real hassle installing it... I'm upgrading from 9.10 to 10.10 and it doesn't seem to be a lot better there... so just in case I want to save the printer-settings/drivers
2011-02-05T16:41:00.000Z	mkanyicy	DanielParker	just note down the steps you took to install them and proceed
