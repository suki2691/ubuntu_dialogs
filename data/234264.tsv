2005-06-17T10:53:00.000Z	reka	decaf	use gtk2 apps?
2005-06-17T10:54:00.000Z	decaf	reka	do you know a gtk2 replacement for amule and dvdrip ?
2005-06-17T10:56:00.000Z	reka	decaf	no, i don't use them, but i'm sure someone else would be able to come up with a few.  i tried to fix xmms' fonts (it uses gtk1)  i gave up and now use beep (gtk2).
