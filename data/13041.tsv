2011-06-19T19:33:00.000Z	mBull	m4lvin	no expert but have checked your jacks ?
2011-06-19T19:34:00.000Z	m4lvin	mBull	you mean hardware? yes, it crackles even with headphones directly in the usb soundcard.
2011-06-19T19:35:00.000Z	m4lvin	mBull	yes. the card is a sound blaster x-fi and the problem seems known around the forums but nobody solved it yet.
