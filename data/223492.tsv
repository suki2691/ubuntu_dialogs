2005-08-24T08:53:00.000Z	felipe_linux		Hi... I cant find /etc/apt/apt.conf or any apt.conf file in my Ubuntu 5.04 box. I am behind a proxy. Can anyone help me?
2005-08-24T08:54:00.000Z	ctp	felipe_linux	I don't have apt.conf on mine either, maybe you are looking for /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-08-24T09:00:00.000Z	felipe_linux	ctp	the /etc/apt/source.list just list the repositories. I need to make apt work behind a proxy. Do you know how can I do that in Ubuntu?
2005-08-24T09:00:00.000Z	ctp	felipe_linux	sorry no i don't :(
