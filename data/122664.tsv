2007-09-04T15:47:00.000Z	Y_O_U_		afternoon everyone. i just installed ubuntu 7.04 onto vmware server 1.0.3 (all of which is on slackware 12). whats weird is i can ping google.com (or any other site), but cant surf there via firefox  by hostname or ip (can get to intranet sites though, via dns). tried via nat'ing and bridged connections. anyone have any suggestions? thanks!
