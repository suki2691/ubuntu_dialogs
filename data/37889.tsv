2010-02-05T02:52:00.000Z	Rubyiris		Would someone be able to explain to me why even though ubuntu is advertised to run basic programs, and even some games faster than windows, ubuntu actually runs significantly slower? Also would someone be able to help me improve my performance?
2010-02-05T02:53:00.000Z	EinoVirtanen	Rubyiris	where have ubuntu been advertised to run windows games faster than windows itself? :o url!
2010-02-05T02:54:00.000Z	EinoVirtanen	Rubyiris	yeah that is pretty common "it has been advertised" and the next thing people say "well I dont remember exactly where" etc
