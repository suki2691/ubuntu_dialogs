2007-04-29T12:49:00.000Z	giggsey		I downloaded and installed fiesty this morning, and when it boots it stops early on. In the recovery mode it shows that modprobe is segfaulting.

It looks like modprobe is segfaulting but I can't figure out why - does anyone have any ideas? I obviously can't get into Ubuntu to troubleshoot it ;)
