I tried to load the old ubuntu breezy cd and change up the partitions and set the root partition again, but it keeps saying my target file system is not clean so it wont install. I am using an other computer right now. But I have the other computer that is messed up right next to me.
2006-07-01T12:25:00.000Z	pvd		I am having a problem with grub, I get grub error 15 when I boot my computer up.  I had a partition that I resized in half with gparted and then when I rebooted system I got this grub error. I tried to load the ubuntu 5.10 cd to redo the partition tables and then reinstall grub but it wont work. I get an error that says target system isnt clean.
2006-07-01T12:26:00.000Z	pvd		Maybe I can use the new ubuntu live cd to get into a gui environment and re-install grub?
