2010-08-17T06:29:00.000Z	rich__		I would like to run multiple operating systems.  I have recently gained interest in virtual machines and was thinkin about running vmware with windows and ubuntu on top.  Will I get the same performance as if I partitioned my hard drive?
2010-08-17T06:30:00.000Z	rich__		anyone?

2010-08-17T06:33:00.000Z	st__	rich__	windows installation with Ubuntu in vm; or partition if you need your sound and 3d graphics in Ubuntu too
