2010-08-16T23:19:00.000Z	pete1		IanWizard - how do i execute grub-update. I have booted a Ubuntu from USB
2010-08-16T23:19:00.000Z	IanWizard	pete1	go to a command line, and type grub-update
2010-08-16T23:19:00.000Z	IanWizard	pete1	but you should probably do os-probber first from live
2010-08-16T23:21:00.000Z	IanWizard	pete1	 don't know on that one...
