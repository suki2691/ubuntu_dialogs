2006-12-28T13:38:00.000Z	Nomaggiz		quick question: I just plugged into my system a HD, with fedora installed on it, which is on LVM. How do I access that drive from within my current edgy system?
2006-12-28T13:40:00.000Z	Nomaggiz		what does !fstab mean? what's the ! for?
2006-12-28T13:40:00.000Z	astronouth7304	Nomaggiz	say just "!fstab" (no quotes)
