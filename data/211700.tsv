2005-10-21T08:05:00.000Z	EasterSunshine		hi all. one question, i have installed java using dpkg -i from a deb in my home directory, and i left that .deb there, but now it is getting in my way, can i delete that deb from my homedir and still have java work?
2005-10-21T08:05:00.000Z	EasterSunshine		and by java working, i mean packaging related to java
2005-10-21T08:06:00.000Z	Ekibyougami	EasterSunshine	you can delete the .deb file, it is just an installer
2005-10-21T08:06:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	Ekibyougami	and if i ever decide to remove the package, dpkg wont complain that the deb is missing?
