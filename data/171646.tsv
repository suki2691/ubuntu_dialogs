2006-08-29T11:08:00.000Z	cliffd		can someone help me with something. Is there a way to make the ubuntu install ask more questions? like where to install and what packages?
2006-08-29T11:09:00.000Z	fdoving	cliffd	no, you're not supposed to choose that.
2006-08-29T11:10:00.000Z	cliffd	fdoving	so I do it after the fact? I can uninstall the things I dont want?
