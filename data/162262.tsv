2006-10-27T09:36:00.000Z	dawn_	jrib	yeah i have tried all those, this is beyond normal operation
2006-10-27T09:37:00.000Z	jrib	dawn_	hmm those are the only odcs I know about for wireless, i've never set it up myself on ubuntu.  Other thing you can do is search the forums to see if anyone had a similar experience
2006-10-27T09:38:00.000Z	dawn_	jrib	thanks, the forums have the same question/issue, but no responses an how to correct
