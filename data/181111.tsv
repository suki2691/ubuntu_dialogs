2007-06-30T16:30:00.000Z	oush		iv got a question or two
2007-06-30T16:30:00.000Z	oush		with Normal ubuntu when it installs updates it rquires you to reboot but does it do the same with Server Edition?
2007-06-30T16:30:00.000Z	bruenig	oush	you do not need to reboot after installing updates on either with the exception of kernels
