2011-12-03T20:52:00.000Z	jinho		If I have a personal development machine, and another machine acting as a local server with multiple accounts, should I be creating ssh keys for each account, or is it normal to use just one private/public key pair when ssh-ing into the 3 different accounts?

2011-12-03T20:54:00.000Z	jinho	ssta	actually one more question: do you name your keys after the account you'll be using them for?
