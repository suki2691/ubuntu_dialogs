2007-08-17T10:30:00.000Z	Journeyman		why hasn't pidgin been added to the repository?
2007-08-17T10:30:00.000Z	macogw	Journeyman	because updates are for security only
2007-08-17T10:31:00.000Z	macogw	Journeyman	security and bug fixes, but not for adding features.  with features comes instability
2007-08-17T10:32:00.000Z	macogw	Journeyman	because nobody's bothered.  backports are rare.  you can get pdigin 2.1 from getdeb.net or from debuntu.org
