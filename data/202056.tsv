2012-08-06T11:47:00.000Z	whyohwhy		does 12.04 auto update packages ? I got rkhunter crying out about all kind of files that are getting changed
2012-08-06T11:48:00.000Z	IdleOne	whyohwhy	it will offer to update but not do it without your permission.
2012-08-06T11:50:00.000Z	IdleOne	whyohwhy	just don't run apt-get upgrade and/or dist-upgrade
2012-08-06T11:51:00.000Z	IdleOne	whyohwhy	not a very good idea though because you won't be getting any security updates unless either
