2009-02-07T21:32:00.000Z	makito249		I have some questions about email setup. Right now I use evolution, but I want to set up a more unixy email setup. Most places recommend procmail, but I am not running a server?
2009-02-07T21:33:00.000Z	makito249		OK, if I wanted to have a daemon running that would check my mail, but not be running evolution all the time, what would I use?
2009-02-07T21:34:00.000Z	makito249		fetchmail, OK. Thanks OldMonk!
