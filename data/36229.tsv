2010-07-21T22:16:00.000Z	zongo_	tgall_foo	yes you would, the weirdest is that you can most definetely read FAT 32 when formated with Windows on Ubuntu but not the opposite
2010-07-21T22:17:00.000Z	zongo_		I was just wondering as for my personal curiosity why is that
2010-07-21T22:17:00.000Z	tgall_foo	zongo_	sounds like a bug
