2005-11-20T15:06:00.000Z	shtron		I can't compile on breezy... I installed gcc, g++ and make but I can't even compile a simple hello world program...
2005-11-20T15:06:00.000Z	polpak	shtron	what are you typing, and what errors do you get
2005-11-20T15:10:00.000Z	polpak	shtron	should be /usr/include/stdio.h
2005-11-20T15:13:00.000Z	polpak	shtron	I don't think that's the issue
