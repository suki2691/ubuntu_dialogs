2009-01-28T20:20:00.000Z	jsnikeris		I just restarted my computer after an update and after logging in, was immediately logged out.  The window manager noticed that I was logged in for such a short amount of time, so it displayed ~/.xession-errors for me.  I'm logged into failsafe Gnome right now, and am trying to figure out what is going wrong.  Can anyone point me in the right direction of where to start looking?
