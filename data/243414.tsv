2005-05-31T05:36:00.000Z	chrissturm		blueeyed: ls -l /etc/X11/X
2005-05-31T05:37:00.000Z	blueyed	chrissturm	I think it's not done by just linking the X binary, as there are libs etc, too.?
2005-05-31T05:38:00.000Z	chrissturm	blueyed	the last 2 problems with x on breezy that i had were wrong font paths in xorg.conf and a wrong link in /etc/X11/X
