2008-01-05T00:48:00.000Z	gentoo	Enselic	as my name probably indicates I am not in ubuntu :P the fact is i need to get my ethernet controller to work and was hoping to find the kernel patch that made it work when I was using ubuntu
2008-01-05T00:48:00.000Z	Enselic	gentoo	ah :) I should've guessed that
