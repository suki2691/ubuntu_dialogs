2009-09-26T15:46:00.000Z	shabda		i want to rename a folder to its parent, so I do "mv photos/migrations/migrations1 photos/migrations/"
2009-09-26T15:47:00.000Z	shabda		thats doesnt work
2009-09-26T15:47:00.000Z	ziroday	shabda	because  photos/migrations already exists
2009-09-26T15:49:00.000Z	ziroday	shabda	try cp photos/migrations/migrations1/* photos/migrations and then rm photos/migrations/migrations1 if the copy was performed correctly
