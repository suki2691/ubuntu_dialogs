2008-02-14T15:01:00.000Z	snailrails		Hi, I've got a ubuntu minimal install ( 50 MB gziped ) I'm having so many problems installing a lamp server... permissions of /tmp were wrong. Bind9 cannot access /dev/console. help.
2008-02-14T15:02:00.000Z	snailrails		is there there no 'apt-get 'setup a working lamp system' command
2008-02-14T15:03:00.000Z	ph0rensic	snailrails	yah hold on 1 sec.. what php version you want?
2008-02-14T15:21:00.000Z	ph0rensic	snailrails	Hmm... I think there are smaller webservers than apache . if your going for pure size limitations
