2006-05-27T16:40:00.000Z	charlesJacobs	njan	wait.. doesn't that contradict with what you were saying?
2006-05-27T16:41:00.000Z	njan	charlesJacobs	not really, I never said ext3 had no disadvantages.
2006-05-27T16:41:00.000Z	njan	charlesJacobs	but last I looked there are data recovery tools for ext3, and if you're properly administrating a system you should never accidentally delete backups, so journaling is more of an issue. Like all things, it's all about priorities ;)
