2011-01-29T17:33:00.000Z	Avi__		I am installing ubuntu server after activating raid during setup. I have to configure iSCSI volumes. After I select Log into iSCSI targets, I need to enter the "iSCSI target portal address". After entering the ip, I get the following error: "No iSCSI targets discovered".
