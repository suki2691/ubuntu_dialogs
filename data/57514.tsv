It happens when 'mc' is running, which makes sense, but can I somehow make an exception for the message if only 'mc' is running?

2009-05-22T08:26:00.000Z	she_dyed	dkulchenko	why dont you just exit it?
2009-05-22T08:27:00.000Z	dkulchenko	she_dyed	yeah, but i'm used to just closing the terminal, and letting mc terminate.
