2009-02-05T17:30:00.000Z	Atan		hello, anyone here who could help me with a GRUB related problem?
2009-02-05T17:31:00.000Z	Atan		I have a MSI P965 Neo motherboard with a JMicron controller and after installing ubuntu on a sata disk GRUB gives error 21 in stage 1.5, I googled and it appears to be an infamous problem...
