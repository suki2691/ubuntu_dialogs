2011-09-07T09:55:00.000Z	zHammeRz	html	I seem to have plenty of speed.  I just use a nvidia 8800gts 320mb .. the only issue i have is when moving windows around it pauses..haven't been successful at turning off the 'show windows contents while dragging' option (B/c I can't find it) :)
2011-09-07T09:55:00.000Z	zHammeRz		Other than that issue, I love Unity and the way it flows
2011-09-07T09:57:00.000Z	html	zHammeRz	  nvidia is  a bit better at linux ,  but try going the 150.00 to 299.00$ range  and for what ive seen  its hard,, i just as  go with system 76
