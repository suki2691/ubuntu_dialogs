2012-10-10T02:11:00.000Z	bigbill		I just setup a ubuntu file server for a small office and put it on the network. Now I want to be able to log in from home, but I'm lost on where to go from here. Any suggestions?

2012-10-10T02:13:00.000Z	bigbill		I can access from within the lan, but how to I access it from outside the lan?
