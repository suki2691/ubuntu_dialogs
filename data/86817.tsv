2008-07-19T12:53:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		how can I increase the number of terminal/bash history lines? I'm not looking for scrolling lines, which can be set in the terminal profile gui... but when I do: -bash-3.20$ history, it only shows approx 500 lines... this is a product of bash correct? and not terminal?
2008-07-19T12:53:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		ie: the "history" command
