2007-10-20T17:22:00.000Z	JohnRobert	aata	yes, just follow the upgrade instructions on the site
2007-10-20T17:27:00.000Z	aata	JohnRobert	that involves having a download-upgrade... i cant afford to do something like that because i often lose electricity to my house (live in pakistan)... if i lose power in the middle, the install could get corrupted...
