2009-08-14T18:02:00.000Z	i00nsu	bazhang	all... listed in backtrack distro or others... i know that are too much, maby some i will never use't, but in my point of view, i will like to have them all implemented on my gnome ubuntu instalation, so if i need to explore some venurability according to my needs, i don0t need to install or look for one, as i have them all... but thinking there is a sweet pack like the lzm pentest file that they did implemented in bt3 slax based..
