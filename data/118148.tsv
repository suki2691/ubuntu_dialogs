2007-10-01T05:54:00.000Z	hjmills	Creationist225	you are going to need to reinstall grub as vista will have overwritten the mbr - you need a live cd and instructions are on help.ubuntu.com
2007-10-01T05:55:00.000Z	Creationist225	hjmills	I'm running a live CD right now.  Tried running "grub-install sda1" but it said that the device isn't recognized.
