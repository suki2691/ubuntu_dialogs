2006-06-08T09:00:00.000Z	joe_		hi, i'm trying to install gaim2.0 and apt-get tells me i'm missing deps? where can i find those?
2006-06-08T09:01:00.000Z	KenSentMe	joe_	doesn't it tell you what dependencies it's missing?
2006-06-08T09:01:00.000Z	joe_	KenSentMe	yeah, but i don't know where to get them
2006-06-08T09:03:00.000Z	KenSentMe	joe_	maybe google for them, but as gaim2.0 is not in the repositories yet, so it's possible that there aren't any deb for the other packages yet
