2005-10-16T11:10:00.000Z	ZeZu		i have tried everything to get these fglrx drivers working ;(  can anyone think of any suggestions, fglrx still says mesa
2005-10-16T11:10:00.000Z	ZeZu		i just replaced w/ the 686 fglrx driver and no help
2005-10-16T11:11:00.000Z	ZeZu		else this is going to be one more distro down the drain due to crappy ati drivers
2005-10-16T11:12:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	ZeZu	ati support is always crappy on all distros
