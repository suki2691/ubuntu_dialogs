2011-10-23T04:44:00.000Z	th0r	hammersend	there are several good howtos on the web. It only involves two commands, ifconfig and iwconfig...and isn't hard to do. All the configs for permanent configs are stored in /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/
2011-10-23T04:44:00.000Z	th0r	hammersend	oops....went to look for that second file and slipped <smile>.
2011-10-23T04:47:00.000Z	th0r	hammersend	can't find that second file right off...it is for the wpa configs. Once you read one or two of the web pages you will see it isn't hard to configure wifi at all.
