2011-04-08T21:17:00.000Z	NerwenGreen		Hi, I have questions about the advantages and disadvantages of installing ubuntu via the windows wubi installer...
2011-04-08T21:19:00.000Z	NerwenGreen		in particular, the description says wubi puts ubuntu on a virtual disk? does that mean ubuntu is running virtually on top of windows? or is it an actual real install of the OS?
2011-04-08T21:19:00.000Z	NerwenGreen		what I'm hoping for is a dual boot setup with windows and ubuntu .. does the wubi installer do that?
