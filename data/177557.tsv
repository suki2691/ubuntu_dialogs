2008-02-05T20:04:00.000Z	wwalker		how do I get dpkg to just list the names of the packages, when they were installed, and sorted by install date?
2008-02-05T20:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wwalker	PAckage list is easy, the rest... let me know if You figure it out
2008-02-05T20:08:00.000Z	wwalker	Jack_Sparrow	so there is no way to know what packages were last installed on a machine that has recently flaked out?  Major failing in dpkg :(
2008-02-05T20:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	wwalker	there may be.. I just dont know it
