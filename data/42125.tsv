2009-11-22T00:26:00.000Z	bashar		because i have 64bit CPU i thought better to have 64bit to use all power of the dual core stuff
2009-11-22T00:27:00.000Z	bashar		is there any issues for having 64bit ubuntu instead of 32bit ? like flash wont work or some applications wont even install ?
2009-11-22T00:27:00.000Z	sobczyk_	bashar	64bit can be slower in some cases
2009-11-22T00:35:00.000Z	sobczyk_	bashar	usually 1 licence = 1 installation
