2010-04-16T03:08:00.000Z	dougm		Hi.  I just tried to grow a 20gig partition to 30gig.  Gparted resized the partition but has also increased the used space by 10gig.  Any ideas?

2010-04-16T03:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	dougm	if it is the root partition just « sudo touch /forcefsck » and reboot
2010-04-16T03:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	dougm	if it is not the easiest way is to use a livecd (gparted can be used)
