2009-04-11T02:06:00.000Z	part-time-jerk		Quick question, is there any reason that my xorg.conf file would revert or change on it's own?
2009-04-11T02:07:00.000Z	got_milk4	part-time-jerk	driver updates, maybe?
2009-04-11T02:08:00.000Z	part-time-jerk	got_milk4	not really sure, I had to add some lines to get my g5 working and after a restart it stopped working so I checked the xorg.conf file and it had reverted to the vanilla file intrepid loaded with
2009-04-11T02:09:00.000Z	got_milk4	part-time-jerk	that's odd, the only reason i would think xorg.conf would change would be that it was modified by driver installations
