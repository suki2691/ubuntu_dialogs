2007-12-23T01:43:00.000Z	soundray	ubuntux	you can interface with JDBC-compliant DBMS through OpenOffice.org. It works nicely, once you get it configured...
2007-12-23T01:43:00.000Z	ubuntux	soundray	some alternatives? i used to use squirrelsql, but im wondering if there are some alternatives?
2007-12-23T01:44:00.000Z	soundray	ubuntux	I don't know of any, but have a look at the output of "apt-cache search mysql frontend"
