2010-02-17T18:38:00.000Z	xav3s		Hi, I installed linux kernel 2.6.32 and, when I select it on grub it shows the following error message: Kernel panic- not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown block. Is there a solution?
2010-02-17T18:38:00.000Z	ikonia	xav3s	where did you get that kernel ?
2010-02-17T18:39:00.000Z	xav3s	ikonia	on kernel.ubuntu.com. It worked at first time but now it shows that message
2010-02-17T18:40:00.000Z	ikonia	xav3s	I'm not aware of that repo
