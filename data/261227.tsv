2005-04-16T15:03:00.000Z	WeirdAl		Hey, um... I'm trying to build gproftpd but it's telling me it can't find the package gtk+-2.0
2005-04-16T15:04:00.000Z	kent	WeirdAl	and you have checked that you have the libgtk+-2.0-devel packages? not sure if its named like that, but search for it with synaptic.
2005-04-16T15:09:00.000Z	kent	WeirdAl	Usually there is a few *devel packages that needs to be installed. Gtk, Gnome etc.  But the configure script will tell you which.. just search for them in synaptic and you should be ok.
