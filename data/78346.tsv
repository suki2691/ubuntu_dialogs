2008-09-27T03:47:00.000Z	detrix_		hello all. I need some one to walk me through on how to set up a USB/WIFI in the iwconfig file.
2008-09-27T03:48:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	detrix_	can you set it up with iwconfig?
2008-09-27T03:48:00.000Z	detrix_	danbh_intrepid	 I am not sure what to up in the iwconfig file
2008-09-27T03:49:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	detrix_	well, iwconfig is a command, not a file...   Are you sure you cant stick with network-manager?
