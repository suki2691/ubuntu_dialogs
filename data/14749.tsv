2011-05-11T16:54:00.000Z	cassio	MagePsycho	Im trying to give Unity a fair chance. I like the screen gains it brings... I have no major major problems... but this flickering is pretty annoying. I don't understand why they followed the OS X integrated menu bar idea but not show the menu bar unless you keep the mouse over it !
