2008-09-12T19:34:00.000Z	jlaeret		I just installed ubuntu 8.04 on a Lenovo Thinkpad X61 Tablet, works fine apart from some minor issues I've been able to correct using info found on the internet, however the microphone doesn't work and I haven't been able to find out how to fix it. I'm not an experienced ubuntu user. Can anyone help?
2008-09-12T19:34:00.000Z	jlaeret		It is not a settings issue, I'm pretty sure
2008-09-12T19:34:00.000Z	maxx_	jlaeret	have to ask - have you tried unmuting it in the mixer?
2008-09-12T19:35:00.000Z	maxx_	jlaeret	maybe try install alsamixergui and see if changing something in that helps
