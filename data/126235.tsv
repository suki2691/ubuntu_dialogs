2007-08-03T11:41:00.000Z	Tromb		OK, after trying sudo chmod 777 /file/directory it still is not working
2007-08-03T11:42:00.000Z	Seveas	Tromb	put the output of 'mount' on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2007-08-03T11:43:00.000Z	Tromb	Seveas	ok
2007-08-03T11:45:00.000Z	Tromb	Seveas	it is saying there is errors??, possibly from unplugging before unmounting?
