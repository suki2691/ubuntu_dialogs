2008-06-11T09:51:00.000Z	w33d5		yesterday i uploaded 1000's of images but i found a bunch a dupes - i deleted them locally but what can i use to compare the directories and delete the "removed dupes" remotely?
2008-06-11T09:51:00.000Z	Bhavesh	w33d5	may be faster to delete all from remote and reupload the files ( if bandwidth / time permits)
2008-06-11T09:52:00.000Z	Bhavesh	w33d5	that could take a while
2008-06-11T09:53:00.000Z	Bhavesh	w33d5	that may work.. but unfortunately i am not the right person to help with rsync
