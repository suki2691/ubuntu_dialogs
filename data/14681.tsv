2011-05-04T12:38:00.000Z	DJones	nicolaslara	ok, I thought you just wanted to get back to the previous gnome desktop instead of unity, I don't use kubuntu so can't help with that
2011-05-04T12:40:00.000Z	nicolaslara	DJones	thanx anyway.. I think it's an issue with X in general, more than kubuntu itself, though. I tried installing gdm and running X manually and get the same problems no keyboard/mouse recognized
