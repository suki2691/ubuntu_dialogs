2007-05-04T12:20:00.000Z	kermitus		hey I was wondering why is it every time I plug in my usb pen drive, mount it and get ready to use it.. and the darn thing is set to root? If I mounted it why can't I manipulate it how I wish? I hate having to reset permissions every time I plug it in.. is there a workaround so that when I plug in my usb pen drive that the permissions are set to the user that mounted the dumb thing? Sry for...
