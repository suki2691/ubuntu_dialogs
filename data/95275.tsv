2008-04-12T21:31:00.000Z	_Silhouette_	dmsuperman	yes, there is no fdd in the boot order
2008-04-12T21:32:00.000Z	_Silhouette_	dmsuperman	it's messed up whatever I put the order as. I will try just booting from HD
2008-04-12T21:34:00.000Z	_Silhouette_	dmsuperman	I can't access my hard drive, though. It just gives me that message first.
