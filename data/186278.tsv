2006-05-13T11:37:00.000Z	Fusion		as you can probably imagine...i'm here because i'm having some ubuntu problems =\
2006-05-13T11:39:00.000Z	Fusion		here's my problem:  I downloaded the newest version...and in installation, it gets the part about copying packages to the hard disk, and i get an error about it not being able to copy them, and says the problem may be i burnt the cd wrong, and i did it 3 times using iso recorder...anyone have any ideas?
2006-05-13T11:40:00.000Z	metajon	Fusion	what's the burn speed (I've encountered problems with CDs burned at > 8x on older drives)
