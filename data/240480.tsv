2008-01-17T07:48:00.000Z	nickrud	cgould	more complete configuration, integration, that kind of thing. Same packages pretty much
2008-01-17T07:48:00.000Z	nickrud	cgould	nothing you could't do in debian though
2008-01-17T07:49:00.000Z	nickrud	cgould	wiki.ubuntu.com is the developer's site, roadmaps and specs and the like
