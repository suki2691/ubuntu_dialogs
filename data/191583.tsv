2006-04-24T06:34:00.000Z	aryeh		For my second installation I chose "expert".  After the "recommended" installation I did not have these problems but for a day and a half I failed to find any IDE that would compile a simple C++ program.
2006-04-24T06:35:00.000Z	walden	aryeh	just do the recommended install. then apt-get install build-essential anjuta
2006-04-24T06:36:00.000Z	walden	aryeh	ok :) do what tonyyarusso said about expert up there.
2006-04-24T06:36:00.000Z	walden	aryeh	then install build-essential and anjuta(which is an IDE)
