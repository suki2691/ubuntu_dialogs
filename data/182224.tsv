2007-09-26T07:43:00.000Z	jhonny		does anyone know how to set up an undetected usb printer manually? i've tried localhost 631 CUPS install and ubuntu standard... nada
2007-09-26T07:45:00.000Z	stefg	jhonny	first check dmesg if there's an USB event when the printer is plugged in. If so, what Make/model is taht?
