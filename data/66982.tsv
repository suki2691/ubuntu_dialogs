2011-12-27T03:50:00.000Z	janisozaur	cliffybx	they have different package managers, (slightly) different ways of achieving similar goals and they have a bit different target audience
2011-12-27T03:50:00.000Z	janisozaur	cliffybx	yes, they do. you can list many distros on distrowatch.com
2011-12-27T03:58:00.000Z	janisozaur	cliffybx	most probably there is also #gnome channel
