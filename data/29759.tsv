2010-06-27T09:46:00.000Z	sha1sum		Hey all. I think my disc got corrupt somehow, and I don't have another burner around. I'm using the livecd for 10.04 now, and I'd like to know if there's a way I can just install from the network packages, but from the live cd?

2010-06-27T09:47:00.000Z	sha1sum	gommle	awesome. where can I get it?
