2006-09-27T09:59:00.000Z	Kurgan		Cool, thanks.
2006-09-27T10:00:00.000Z	Kurgan		Ok, simply put, as of this morning I've just about had it with Windows. I want to install Ubuntu, but am not sure about how to go about it, or, more importantly, if my motherboard and video will work. Using nforce4 mb and a GeForce 6600 vid card.
