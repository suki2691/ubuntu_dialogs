2006-02-24T09:24:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	moonunit	why? you can't
2006-02-24T09:25:00.000Z	moonunit	hatake_kakashi	ive just never done it
2006-02-24T09:25:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	moonunit	you can't, different programs, etc are stored in different locations, you can't just ask to make it install in a certain part
