2008-01-03T20:31:00.000Z	Gpalco	DSpair	I have a Q to you: How can I tell Ubuntu which IP to use in case it fales to receive one from a DHCP server ??? (Special thank you to Jowi_n1 and c9s who helped me learn how to specify one in addition the one given by DHCP! That's an amazing feature, but it only works if DHCP server DOES respond)
