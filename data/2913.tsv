2012-05-23T15:56:00.000Z	Mitchell_M		Hey ppl, I was wondering if anyone knew how to edit a .desktop file so that the shortcut to a program appears on the Ubuntu Launcher for easy user access? Is there a command or something I should add? Is there another way other than this to create a launcpad icon with a script?
