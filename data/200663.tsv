2006-01-17T10:07:00.000Z	Lil-Abner		I just ordered the disks. I have a linux system on it now, but as a newbie to linux, it's a litte difficult to get the thing working right.
2006-01-17T10:09:00.000Z	Lil-Abner		Thanks, all. What irc program is bundled with ubuntu? I'm using mIRC on this machine and kopete on the linux machine.
