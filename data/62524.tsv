2010-02-10T20:36:00.000Z	axos88		Hello! Is this the place to ask a wget related question? I have a CGI script that sends a file name (content-disposition: attachement; filename:xxx) along with the file contents. Is there a way to make wget use that filename to store the file as?

2010-02-10T20:38:00.000Z	iceroot	axos88	ok
