2010-06-14T02:02:00.000Z	purpley		If I have a quad core cpu and I installed ubuntu on my system would it take advantage of all 4 cores?
2010-06-14T02:03:00.000Z	purpley		How do I view the load on each seperate core?
2010-06-14T02:03:00.000Z	chmac	purpley	I have 2 load cpu_freq applets on my panel. Lets me watch each core separately.
2010-06-14T02:04:00.000Z	chmac	purpley	ALT-F2 gnome-system-monitor, lets me see each core as a separate cpu under the Resources tab
