2008-03-14T03:07:00.000Z	cge	jack-desktop	Slart: Firefox is actually in /usr/lib/firefox or /usr/lib/mozilla, if I recall correctly.
2008-03-14T03:08:00.000Z	cge	jack-desktop	It is /usr/lib/mozilla?
2008-03-14T03:08:00.000Z	cge	jack-desktop	Strange; I thought it was changed to /usr/lib/firefox years ago. Oh well...
