2007-05-01T16:57:00.000Z	casual_moron		not as far as i can see
2007-05-01T16:58:00.000Z	casual_moron		on ubuntu i dont get any options for that kind of thing, i also tryed out elive (which has the exsact same problem of just no output atall on the screen) and that had various options to pick different drivers, none of them made any difference
