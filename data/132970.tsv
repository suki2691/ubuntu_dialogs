2008-06-07T22:45:00.000Z	jonaskoelker		hi all; I installed kubuntu on my laptop; then i (apt-get) installed ubuntu-desktop, and purged a bunch of kde packages, including compizconfig-backend-kconfig.  Now, when running compiz, it doesn't respond to my keyboard; alt-f2 doesn't open "run", alt-drag doesn't move windows, alt-tab doesn't switch, etc.  how can I make compiz work normally?
