2010-04-06T04:18:00.000Z	histo	Niennor	you could find files with certain errors and rename them
2010-04-06T04:21:00.000Z	histo	Niennor	there is a rename command on debian based systems as well. you could do something like rename -v 's/\.something/\.somethingnew/' *.blah
2010-04-06T04:22:00.000Z	histo	Niennor	you'd have to look at the man page for a better explaination and to see some examples
