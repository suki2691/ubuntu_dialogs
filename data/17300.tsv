2011-08-31T02:35:00.000Z	japro		is there a way to have firefox on multiple xscreens in a multi head configuration?
2011-08-31T02:35:00.000Z	japro		all i can find is a bug report from as far back as version 1.5 O_o
2011-08-31T02:36:00.000Z	Jeruvy	japro	its been a bug for a while, no resolution in sight.
2011-08-31T02:37:00.000Z	japro	Jeruvy	so i'll have to continue with the "epiphany fix" ... turns out a lot of sortware behaves wierdly with multiple xscreens, is that something exotic to do? everyone using twinview?
