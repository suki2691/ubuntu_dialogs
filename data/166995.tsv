2008-03-27T12:06:00.000Z	devilsadvocate		i've use *buntu on a 800 mhz laptop with 384 gigs of ram. it was a bit sluggish, but not terribly slow
2008-03-27T12:07:00.000Z	damo22	devilsadvocate	xubuntu would work faster
2008-03-27T12:08:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	damo22	 i know. didnt really like the xubuntu xfce though. eventually moved to vector linux and then ubuntu with fluxbox
