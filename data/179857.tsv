2010-09-01T18:11:00.000Z	lucenut		Hi peeps. I have a machine with 10.04 installed and I want to make it dual boot with windows 7.
2010-09-01T18:11:00.000Z	lucenut		I booted into a live cd and tried gparted but it says you have to have root priviledges to run gparted.
2010-09-01T18:11:00.000Z	lucenut		What do I do?
