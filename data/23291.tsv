2011-09-25T12:07:00.000Z	tp43	Ibyss	when you are in grub, scroll down
2011-09-25T12:07:00.000Z	Ibyss	tp43	I tried that part. But that isn't happening. (Theres onl ubuntu on that harddrive).
2011-09-25T12:08:00.000Z	tp43	Ibyss	whenever I install Ubuntu, I get two boot options for each install, one is regular and one is single user mode which is Linux version of safe mode for Windows
