2011-06-21T01:35:00.000Z	Happy		anyone have idea why my wireless worked fine in livecd and after installation ubuntu can't recognise my wireless card?
2011-06-21T01:35:00.000Z	wols_	Happy	what does your kernel say? what does iwconfig say?
2011-06-21T01:38:00.000Z	wols_	Happy	then check your kernel output
2011-06-21T01:39:00.000Z	wols_	Happy	output from your wlan card driver. or even the lack of it
