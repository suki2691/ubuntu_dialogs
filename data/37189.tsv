2010-02-22T12:18:00.000Z	emghazal		When I boot the computer, I get "The application 'NetworkManager Applet' (/usr/bin/nm-applet) wants access to the default keyring, but it is locked", and I have to enter the keyring password to access the wireless network. How do I let it connect to the wireless network without asking for the keyring password?

2010-02-22T12:22:00.000Z	emghazal	sslaccessrocks	I don't have "System -> Preferences -> encryption and keyrings", did you mean "Applicatins -> Accessories -> Passwords and Encryption Keys"? I looked there and didn't find an option to not ask for the keyring password
