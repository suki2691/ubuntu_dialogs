2010-01-09T07:29:00.000Z	knipknup		Hi there.  I am getting the infamous broadcom wireless driver dropping intermittantly thing with my laptop and karmic.  I attempted to follow a couple of the ubuntu forum suggestions to fix it and that really messed things up.  Does anyone have a sound solution they can guide me to? When I activated via the menu option System/Administration/Hardware Drivers in gnome, there were two drivers listed, a Broadcom STA and a Broadcom 43x.
