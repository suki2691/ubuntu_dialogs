2007-06-06T09:10:00.000Z	hwilde	not_a_k	recursively change the permissions to add group write permission:   chmod -R g+w [directory] 
2007-06-06T09:10:00.000Z	not_a_k	hwilde	i want the files to already be group writable on creation
2007-06-06T09:11:00.000Z	not_a_k	hwilde	if bob and sue are members of the same group. and have group write access to a folder, i want to ensure that the files they create are also group writable. without forcing them to do a chmod everytime
