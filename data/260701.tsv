2004-11-07T06:27:00.000Z	TheMuso	Craigory	Universe is Debian unstable frozen back in June I think.
2004-11-07T06:30:00.000Z	TheMuso	Craigory	All packages in Universe are a copy of Debian testing but built against a Ubuntu base.
2004-11-07T06:30:00.000Z	TheMuso	Craigory	So you are not able to mix unstable with it. I suggest to grab the unstable sources and rebuild against Ubuntu.
