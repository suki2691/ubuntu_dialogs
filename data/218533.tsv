2005-10-30T09:09:00.000Z	pesco		How do I find out which package will provide a file "foo" again?
2005-10-30T09:11:00.000Z	brenner	pesco	dpkg -S foo (package needs to be installed) or packages.ubuntu.com
2005-10-30T09:11:00.000Z	pesco	brenner	Hm, I'm sure there was a command that could do it for uninstalled packages, too, somehow...
2005-10-30T09:12:00.000Z	brenner	pesco	probably....i don't know it obviously
