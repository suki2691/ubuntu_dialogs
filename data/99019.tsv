2008-04-28T22:56:00.000Z	jughead		I have a server running ubuntu that I can connect to using samba and ssh, but it will not access the internet so I can't do updates.  How can I start troubleshooting this?

2008-04-28T22:57:00.000Z	jughead	LainIwakura	it's mine it's a home server
2008-04-28T22:57:00.000Z	LainIwakura	jughead	oh nvm
