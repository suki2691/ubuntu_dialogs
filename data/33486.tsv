2010-04-26T05:23:00.000Z	Majora_		I have Ubuntu 9.10 installed on a white macbook version 4-1 and would like to roll back its mouse drivers and all mouse-related settings back to those used in Ubuntu 9.04 and earlier. How can I do this?
2010-04-26T05:25:00.000Z	Typos_King	Majora_	  we did see you, btw,  firstly I didn't know what to make out it, I don't think you can on a new version, unless the version allows, and I can't be sure, though sounds to me you may be asking the wrong question
2010-04-26T05:28:00.000Z	Majora_	Typos_King	I'm following the 10 minute repeat question guideline in case anyone's AFK and have recently came back. What question should I ask?
2010-04-26T05:29:00.000Z	Typos_King	Majora_	    dunno, tell us what 'not working' means, and what you'd like or expect instead :)
