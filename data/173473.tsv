2009-07-01T03:08:00.000Z	LogicalGhost		<-- Newb needs help - I've been trying to install Ubuntu on my old laptop but was having issues and out of curiosity when I restarted it with the boot CD I hit "Check Disk Integrity" and now it says I have errors in 1 files - what do I do?
2009-07-01T03:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	LogicalGhost	ok  maybe  you got a dirty or sractched  CD
