2008-03-20T08:56:00.000Z	Zimbo		Could someone clue me in as to what the different between aptitude and apt-get is?  The later retrieves "bundles" of packages all at once rather than just individual packages or something?
2008-03-20T08:57:00.000Z	Zimbo		And "aptitude SomeRandomPackage" will generally work the same as "apt-get SomeRandomPackage" ?
2008-03-20T08:58:00.000Z	Stroganoff	Zimbo	generelly yes, but there are minor differences
2008-03-20T08:58:00.000Z	Stroganoff	Zimbo	in gutsy you should always use apt-get
