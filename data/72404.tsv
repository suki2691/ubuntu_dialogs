2008-12-01T14:00:00.000Z	jan247	HRshovinstuff	easiest way is to click on the icon on your desktop showing your flash drive, then hit eject
2008-12-01T14:01:00.000Z	jan247		i mean, unmount volume
2008-12-01T14:01:00.000Z	HRshovinstuff	jan247	that option is not available, I have unmount.  Will that do the trick?? Only question i'm asking is because when I eject the hardware within windwos the light on it goes out, when I unmount it in *Nix the light stays on, hasn't created any problems just curios.
