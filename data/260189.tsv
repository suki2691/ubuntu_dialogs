2005-03-26T11:25:00.000Z	zerovertex		i just installed ubuntu 5 preview on my pc (i already have it on my powerbook) but wtf is the default root pass? on my powerbook I had to drop into single user mode and reset it.
2005-03-26T11:25:00.000Z	zerovertex		is there a easier way?
2005-03-26T11:25:00.000Z	eruin	zerovertex	there is no root pass
