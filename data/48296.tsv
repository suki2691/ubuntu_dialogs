2012-10-20T20:48:00.000Z	User123		So, no more help for me?
2012-10-20T20:50:00.000Z	User123		ok, then another question : is it possible that compiled program will be 64bit and wont work on my 32bit OS?
2012-10-20T20:52:00.000Z	OerHeks	User123	ofcourse 64 bit apps do not work on 32 bit. ubuntu 64 bit is multi arch, so you can run 32 bit apps on that
2012-10-20T20:54:00.000Z	User123	OerHeks	ok. I just thought that you can choose to compile program to be 32bit or 64 bit :) noob here. Thank you.
