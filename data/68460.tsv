2009-02-17T01:58:00.000Z	danbhfive	ArcSighter	upgrade to jaunty, when it comes out
2009-02-17T01:59:00.000Z	ArcSighter	danbhfive	actually, I was looking for the way to do something like sudo aptitude -t jaunty install kde4
2009-02-17T02:01:00.000Z	danbhfive	ArcSighter	well, jaunty is being offered as the best way.  That's where Canonical/etc will do all their testing...   Other than that, I dunno
