2010-09-12T00:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xiaclo	 ive seen external laptop sized hd's that have weird 2 headed usb conectors. guess they need power from 2 usb ports.
2010-09-12T00:09:00.000Z	xiaclo	Dr_Willis	yes, most laptop drives are around 700-800mA, USB1-2 is only 500mA ... there is low-power laptop drives that will run off one usb port, but most don't
2010-09-12T00:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xiaclo	 i noticed this laptop has an 'always powered on' usb port also. wonder how many mA it gives.. :)
2010-09-12T00:10:00.000Z	xiaclo	Dr_Willis	probably still just the 500mA, it was part of the USB specification
