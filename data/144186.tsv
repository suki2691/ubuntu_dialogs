2007-03-02T07:51:00.000Z	jussi01	invisibleman	it can be, just depends what you want. if dapper is working fine, dont bother
2007-03-02T07:52:00.000Z	invisibleman	jussi01	dapper is really good, but there is a better performance on edgy? is it too slow?
2007-03-02T07:55:00.000Z	jussi01	invisibleman	edgy has similar performance - have you thought about trying xubuntu?
