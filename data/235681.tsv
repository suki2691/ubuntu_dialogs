2007-06-06T13:57:00.000Z	Madpilot	JW_606	you can delete ~/.mozilla/firefox - but that will kill ALL your firefox settings, including bookmarks and such
2007-06-06T14:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	JW_606	anything with a dot in front of it is a hidden config file or directory - so .mozilla
2007-06-06T14:02:00.000Z	Madpilot	JW_606	and ~ is shorthand for "your user's home directory"
