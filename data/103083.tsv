2010-03-29T04:31:00.000Z	ubutom	histo	yeah, but it could be the samething, other OS doesn't terminate the device right and next OS can't use it
2010-03-29T04:31:00.000Z	histo	ubutom	well its a firmware issue that you are described causing the locking.
2010-03-29T04:32:00.000Z	ubutom	histo	yeah, did dual boot while having that issue, I think it was an internal NIc or modem, don't remember exactly
