2007-03-25T07:25:00.000Z	skar	StoneNote	thanks for the freenx pointer, what i'd prefer is to run a gnome app on the network machine and view it from my ubuntu dekstop
2007-03-25T07:26:00.000Z	StoneNote	skar	I can run a gnome x window session over freenx. but good luck finding what you're looking for
2007-03-25T07:27:00.000Z	skar	StoneNote	ok i don't need remote gui login, as that'd mean i can't alt+tab between my firefox browser on my desktop and the gui html editor on the network machine
