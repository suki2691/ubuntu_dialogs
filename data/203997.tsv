2005-12-18T11:51:00.000Z	B166ERX		I juste finished reinstalling ubuntu breezy, but my Windows HD  is now represented by a HDA1 icon, and ...is unnacesible
2005-12-18T11:52:00.000Z	techrush	B166ERX	you need to access it as root for some reason......so try this in a console "sudo nautilus"
2005-12-18T11:52:00.000Z	techrush		then browse to hda1
2005-12-18T11:53:00.000Z	B166ERX	techrush	its the first time i have to acess my other HD by root only... there must be a way to change it
