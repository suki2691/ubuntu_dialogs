2010-05-02T08:40:00.000Z	TMK_		Hi...I'm having a problem in Lucid...  Whenever I go to just drag or move a window, the whole xserver freezes up.
2010-05-02T08:41:00.000Z	TMK_		i'm seeing this in my syslog: nouveau 0000:05:0d.0: PGRAPH_NOTIFY - nSource: METHOD_CNT, nStatus: INVALID_STATE
2010-05-02T08:43:00.000Z	TMK_		seems like lucid is having a ton of xserver issues.
