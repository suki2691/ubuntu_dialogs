2009-01-17T02:51:00.000Z	alexb2283	guntbert	thanks for not helping me at all :) the console-kit bugs are unrelated to jaunty and appear in hardy and intrepid as well
2009-01-17T02:52:00.000Z	alexb2283	guntbert	my question was more like: "what do i need dbus/consolekit for on an xless server install" or "can i get rid of them without breaking anything important"
