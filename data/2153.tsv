2012-07-03T18:22:00.000Z	maxmc		Sorry for asking agin, but noone answerd so far:  I'm running ubuntu 12.04 on my thinkpad x220 and since today my headphones don't play sound. as soon as I unplug them sound plays through the notebook speakers. This is independent of the sound source (browser, soundsettings-test, rhythmbox,...) any ideas how to fix this?
