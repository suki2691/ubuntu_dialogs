2008-06-06T16:21:00.000Z	meltingclock		i don't see any obvious central time options under adjust time/date...are developers looking into redoing the way clock settings are changed under ubuntu? i.e. listing by time zone instead of places?
2008-06-06T16:23:00.000Z	meltingclock		or better yet, is there a way to manually change the time without selecting a location?
2008-06-06T16:24:00.000Z	soundray	meltingclock	'man date', then set the time with 'sudo date'
2008-06-06T16:24:00.000Z	meltingclock	soundray	thanks
