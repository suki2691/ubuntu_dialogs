2012-10-31T03:20:00.000Z	overdub		I have a fresh 12.10 install and it keeps shutting down when I leave it idle, any ideas what might be causing this?
2012-10-31T03:21:00.000Z	quince	overdub	is this on a laptop?  I guess power management might be responsible?
2012-10-31T03:21:00.000Z	overdub	quince	yes, a Lenovo which ran previous versions with no problems
2012-10-31T03:24:00.000Z	overdub	quince	thanks for the insights, i checked my power setting and will keep an eye on it
