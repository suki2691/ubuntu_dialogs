2009-10-17T02:45:00.000Z	dios_mio		ubuntu firefox 3.5 is messed up in its right click menus!!!
2009-10-17T02:46:00.000Z	cxo	dios_mio	i have to click on the shirtiko (or however its called) icon like 10 times before it opens
2009-10-17T02:47:00.000Z	cxo	dios_mio	i suggest if you really want the extra +0.5, get the generic tarball from the mozilla website and use that instead of the one from the ubuntu repo
2009-10-17T02:47:00.000Z	dios_mio	cxo	, good idea
