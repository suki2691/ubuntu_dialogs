2009-07-15T11:16:00.000Z	klown	josephdyland	with my nvidia drivers, and my "monitor"(my tv), i had to set the resolution for it to work correctly.
2009-07-15T11:17:00.000Z	josephdyland	klown	Resolution is already set to 1920x1080, Is there any way to calibrate or something
2009-07-15T11:17:00.000Z	klown	josephdyland	excuse me..wrong wording, i had to change the dpi to get it to fit on the screen.
