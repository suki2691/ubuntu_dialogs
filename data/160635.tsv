2007-03-04T16:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	truvisionary	What kind of dock, there should be a panel there by default\
2007-03-04T16:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	truvisionary	Do you have Compiz / Beryl installed?
2007-03-04T16:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	truvisionary	Because OSx has a GPU accellerated window manager, to get a truly OSx like dock you need one too ( hence Beryl / Compiz )
