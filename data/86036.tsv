2008-07-09T15:01:00.000Z	trupheenix		i'm facing issues running Ubuntu hardy on a Pentium D 3.0 Ghz CPU with 1 GB Ram. After I log in the GUI stalls. I'm using a 945 Chipset.

2008-07-09T15:15:00.000Z	trupheenix	djhash	i started in GNOME failsafe. it seems there's some problem with the 945GMA and compiz fusion. i was surprised :)
