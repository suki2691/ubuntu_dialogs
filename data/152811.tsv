2006-12-27T15:42:00.000Z	Graviton	adaptr	Trouble is that every time I upgrade my kernel (whether it be vanilla or ubuntu's) my /boot/grub/menu.lst is changed so I get the splash-screen
2006-12-27T15:43:00.000Z	adaptr	Graviton	yes, but if you check what is actually changed, it is the menu items that ubuntu has put in there, so just add your own and boot with those - you might even exchange the names of ubuntu's kernel and initrd for your own, so they won't be changed either
