2010-06-22T11:03:00.000Z	Gwar		Hi all. is it possible to allow sudo to be able to run at boot for (say) a Minute after login? I currently have to run a program manually as sudo every time I login and it's frustrating to have to type out a 20+ long password twice, especially since I just logged in! D:

2010-06-22T11:05:00.000Z	Gwar	jook	thank you. I know how to make the script run on login, the problem is it needs to run as sudo, which then asks for my password, 2 seconds after I just typed the thing in to login! D:
