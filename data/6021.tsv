2012-02-14T17:48:00.000Z	RawProduce	uni4dfx	use cmake, autotools will drive you insane
2012-02-14T17:49:00.000Z	uni4dfx	RawProduce	you can say that again, but it's not my choice
2012-02-14T17:50:00.000Z	RawProduce	uni4dfx	in that case, I'm sorry for the pain you're about to experience and I have no idea where to find good docs :)
