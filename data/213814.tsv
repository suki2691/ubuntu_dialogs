2009-12-06T12:55:00.000Z	kevdog		any thoughts on ion netbooks?  Anyone have any problems with ubuntu installation on these?
2009-12-06T12:56:00.000Z	kevdog		I heard ext4 has problems with large files > 2GB.  I've been warned to stay away
2009-12-06T12:57:00.000Z	kevdog		Heard some ubuntu developers chattering about this once -- they said don't use if mission critical
