2008-08-10T20:28:00.000Z	Taladan		Okay....I have an old HP d class 9000 server box that was gifted to me when my company was cleaning out old machines.  It still runs (presumably) well, however it has no vidcard in it (uses ISA slots and I have been unable to locate one for it) is there a way to do a completely headless server install without needing to log into the machine and prompt it through the installation options?
