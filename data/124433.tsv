2010-09-16T15:02:00.000Z	Random832	adrian__	probably you're just supposed to run it - what is the file from?
2010-09-16T15:03:00.000Z	adrian__	Random832	it is adobe reader and I want to install it
2010-09-16T15:03:00.000Z	Random832	adrian__	why do you want to use the bin file instead of using the partners repository?
