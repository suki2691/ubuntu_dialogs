2009-10-08T02:53:00.000Z	SquirrelMan		So basically, I just need someone to trust me and help me figure out why blacklisted drivers are being loaded anyway
2009-10-08T02:54:00.000Z	joaopinto	SquirrelMan	black listed drivers will be loaded if you do a manual load
2009-10-08T02:54:00.000Z	SquirrelMan	joaopinto	I'm not doing a manual load. Perhaps the kernel is when it fails to load the resume file?
