2011-12-06T14:49:00.000Z	astro771		I tried to install it while Microsoft Clikc-to-run had a virtual partition available and the install crapped out on it ... removing the virtual partiiton and trying again ... unable to get it working
2011-12-06T14:51:00.000Z	astro771		given that I need to create a dedicated partition -- will the ubuntu installer be able to resize a ntfs partition during install or will I have to do it in Windoze?
2011-12-06T14:51:00.000Z	theadmin	astro771	It can resize ntfs but SLOOOOWLY, I suggest doing it in Windows instead
