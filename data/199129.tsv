2008-06-04T13:17:00.000Z	Jangari		update-grub didn't change the menu.lst entry from 24-17 to 24-18. Can I just change it manually?
2008-06-04T13:17:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Jangari	I doubt that's true
2008-06-04T13:18:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Jangari	where did 24.18 come from?
2008-06-04T13:19:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Jangari	usually new kernels get added to menu.lst without any problems
