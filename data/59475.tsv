2009-04-26T08:09:00.000Z	skierpage		Yo, I downloaded the 9.04 ISO and burned a CD.  I see it has wubi.exe on it.  I'm running Windows and have a spare D: partition I want to reformat as ext4 and use for ubuntu. Can I run wubi.exe from this disk or must I boot from the CD?

2009-04-26T08:12:00.000Z	skierpage	corinth	 OK thanks, I'll reboot.  BTW https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide isn't at all clear on that point.
