2007-04-11T11:01:00.000Z	SperMite_		Why do people from other distros call ubuntu evil? i've been seeing that alot lately
2007-04-11T11:02:00.000Z	geekytrent	SperMite_	and probably because ubuntu is including an easy to use codec installer (and a lot of codecs are proprietary or have licensing issues)
2007-04-11T11:02:00.000Z	geekytrent	SperMite_	and this goes against their thought of everything free, nothing proprietary kinda attitude....
