2009-03-17T23:46:00.000Z	curtmack		presumably
2009-03-17T23:47:00.000Z	x_or	curtmack	 OK.  Another question, is it possible to switch from using one video card to another using software?  For example, if I wanted to use one card, and then remotely configure and disable that card so that another would work.
