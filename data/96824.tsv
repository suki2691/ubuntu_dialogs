2008-03-28T01:01:00.000Z	odder	crazy_elf	what do you mean saying 'reset gnome' ?
2008-03-28T01:01:00.000Z	crazy_elf		I deleted the .gnome folder, .gnome2, and .gconf folders but my problem with gnome is still is there.
2008-03-28T01:02:00.000Z	crazy_elf	odder	when I drag an icon on the desktop it makes a copy instead of moving it.
