2011-02-04T14:41:00.000Z	BLuEGoD		I've succesfuly upgraded my php version in hardy manually to 5.3, however, I don't know how to "update" apache to get the new php working... google didn't help me on this.. could anyone point me in the right direction?
2011-02-04T14:43:00.000Z	BLuEGoD		oh I don't think I would do the same in Ubuntu, FreeBSD or Windows, so I don't think it's unrelated
