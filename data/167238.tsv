2006-09-19T11:25:00.000Z	hydrozen		Can I get a 1280x800 resolution without installing the ati drivers? I've been trying for hours to install the drivers but everytime X doesnt want to start.... i dont care all that much about 3d, but if i could at least get out of 1024x768 it would at least be that!
2006-09-19T11:26:00.000Z	Daniel_X	hydrozen	: similar prob here.. low res on ati card
2006-09-19T11:27:00.000Z	hydrozen	Daniel_X	there must be something that can be done...
2006-09-19T11:28:00.000Z	Daniel_X	hydrozen	: i know the card is old, but as i said, i got the higher res in windows
