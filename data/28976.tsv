2011-06-25T14:23:00.000Z	Jaugenya		Hello Guys, I'm using Ubuntu Natty and need to translate a webpage displaying in Chineese to display in English. How can I do this
2011-06-25T14:24:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Jaugenya	you can use google translate on the page, but that doesn't change the page, it just redisplays the text
2011-06-25T14:24:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Jaugenya	it also is a really bad translation for chinese
2011-06-25T14:25:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Jaugenya	automatic translation tools like google translate are the reason why china has notably bad english signage
