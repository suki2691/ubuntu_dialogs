2012-02-26T00:46:00.000Z	moddinati		Hello.  I need to create a bootable XP install disk (I currently do not have windows on my machine).  Anyone know of linux alternatives to WinToFlash?  unetbootin did not work.

2012-02-26T00:47:00.000Z	moddinati	xangua	 Thanks for responding.  I don't believe the windows channels would know anything about linux software (correct me if I'm wrong).
