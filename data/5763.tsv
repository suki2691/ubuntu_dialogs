2012-02-09T11:19:00.000Z	dooglus	superdave321	that's what I'm trying, but there's nowhere to type the name of the script I want it to run
2012-02-09T11:20:00.000Z	superdave321	dooglus	did you try the "open with custom command" expand option?
2012-02-09T11:21:00.000Z	superdave321	dooglus	just under the application selection...
