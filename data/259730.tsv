2005-06-02T05:51:00.000Z	florian_		sorry for this, but Im now a rather experienced user and every distro I've installed up to now came with emacs, so whats the standard ubuntu editor for programming?
2005-06-02T05:53:00.000Z	florian_		emacs I dont know exactly, I installed a deb package from the latest debian. But for sure something like xemacs (with a GUI) is not installed.
