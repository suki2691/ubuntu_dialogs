2009-05-19T23:05:00.000Z	mzz	eross	you can do that during the install
2009-05-19T23:05:00.000Z	mzz	eross	(that is: assuming you simply want to mount that partition on /home)
2009-05-19T23:05:00.000Z	mzz	eross	(it's not something more complicated, like mounting that partition elsewhere and symlinking one directory on it to a directory in /home)
