2011-06-28T11:04:00.000Z	firstIRCtest		I have a machine (the one I'm on) on which I have ubuntu 8.04 on one partition...this has been there for some time. I just installed ubuntu 11.04 on a new partition, and I have no sound on that partition. Any help? I figure that having one partition working ought to be of some use.

2011-06-28T11:06:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	firstIRCtest	the few times I've had no sound with an ubuntu install, alsamixer was the only remedy. must be certain audio hardware
