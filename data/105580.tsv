2008-04-09T23:29:00.000Z	nucco	QuickGold	probably refresh rate
2008-04-09T23:29:00.000Z	QuickGold	nucco	 Yes. how do I fix the refresh rate?
2008-04-09T23:32:00.000Z	nucco	QuickGold	I can't remember that off-heart but I would suggest re-run dpkg-reconfigure and then choose advanced for the monitor settings, and input what you think is correct
