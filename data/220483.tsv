2008-04-29T23:41:00.000Z	Flannel	mrichman	The desktop is a liveCD, and uses Ubiquity installer to install, Alternate CD is text-only and provides more options for installation.  They both can install the desktop system (and an identical one at that)

2008-04-29T23:42:00.000Z	Flannel	mrichman	DVD is Alternate + Desktop + Additional packages in the disc repository (expanded Alternate CD).  You don't need the DVD if all you want is to install Ubuntu.
