2008-07-19T05:03:00.000Z	Blaqlight		Im curious as to why this program (E16) wants to remove ubuntu-desktop. problem is this, its supposed to be a dummy/virtual file and it would be safe to remove, so when I tried it said it was going to remove 142MB os stuff... hence NOT a dummy file.

2008-07-19T05:04:00.000Z	Blaqlight		not apt-get
