2007-03-17T06:04:00.000Z	{NmE}		I have a question about Wine.. When I run 'wine setup' everything seems to go fine.. It finishs, however, with this message.. 'wine: could not loadL"c:\\windows\\system32\ \setup.exe": Module not found'
2007-03-17T06:05:00.000Z	{NmE}		Can no one see what I type??
2007-03-17T06:06:00.000Z	{NmE}		Has anyone used wine here? or no?
