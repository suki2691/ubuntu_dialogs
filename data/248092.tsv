2008-01-20T00:19:00.000Z	Hilikus		ok so let me change my question
2008-01-20T00:20:00.000Z	Hilikus		what's adduser --system
2008-01-20T00:20:00.000Z	ompaul	Hilikus	you are only giving permission to a user to be able to run things with permissions of UID 0 - you are not setting them up as UID 0 subtle difference but important
