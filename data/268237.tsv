2005-04-16T10:11:00.000Z	pressureman		i'm a first time caller (first time with ubuntu anyway)... nice work guys
2005-04-16T10:12:00.000Z	pressureman		i have a question about groups in ubuntu - why does the installer create a group of the same name as my user, and add me to that group?
2005-04-16T10:12:00.000Z	pressureman		doesn't it make more sense to simply add my user to the 'users' group, as would be the case on most other *nixes?
