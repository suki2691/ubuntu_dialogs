2009-07-10T22:28:00.000Z	lstarnes	majikman	/var/lib is used for storing variable information
2009-07-10T22:28:00.000Z	lstarnes	majikman	/usr/share is used for storing information that doesn't vary often
2009-07-10T22:29:00.000Z	majikman	lstarnes	that might be the standard definition of /var/lib but i don't think thats what applies for the tomcat package
