2010-10-05T14:00:00.000Z	iTroll		hey guys, any recommendations for a versioning backup tool in the repos?  Basically I want incremental/versioned backups from my webserver over ftp
2010-10-05T14:01:00.000Z	ddilinger	iTroll	svn, git, mercurial, although none are specifically designed for websites they can handle the task
2010-10-05T14:01:00.000Z	ddilinger	iTroll	graphics in them will be a bit of bloat though
2010-10-05T14:02:00.000Z	iTroll	ddilinger	yea I use git at work, but i dont really want to manage using it as a backup tool, I was thinking of backup-manager, which sounds quite good
