2009-11-02T13:19:00.000Z	sPaM_mer		is the Adobe Flash player open source?
2009-11-02T13:19:00.000Z	d9500	sPaM_mer	no.
2009-11-02T13:21:00.000Z	d9500	sPaM_mer	adobe will not release the source code. if you want open source flash playback, you need gnash or swfdec. those, however, do not play all flash. most youtube seems to work, for example, but slowly. other wistes may not work at all
