2009-01-28T16:35:00.000Z	xiroV		Hi all.. I just installed 8.10, and I got problems with making my Graphics driver work.. I have a nvidia 7000m, and apparently it's set as "supported" in both nvidia-glx-177 and nvidia-glx-180, but they doesn't work?

2009-01-28T16:37:00.000Z	xiroV	cwillu	well.. they act like nothing happened.. I download and install with synaptic, and when thats done, i restarted, just in case it needed that. And then it just booted up as usually.. i don't see any change at all.. and besides i still only got the 800x600 as the highest resolution.
