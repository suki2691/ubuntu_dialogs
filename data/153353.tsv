2008-06-12T20:18:00.000Z	evariste		I have another question, I'm pretty new to Linux (exWindows user) and I was wondering what firewalls, antispyware, antivirus software there is out there for Linux? I used to use things like zonealarm, ad-aware, avg, etc.. for Windows.
2008-06-12T20:20:00.000Z	evariste		Do I have to configure these iptables or enable them? Or should this already be done?
2008-06-12T20:21:00.000Z	evariste		So in terms of security, I shouldn't worry too much?
2008-06-12T20:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	evariste	just common sense.. i personally hate software firewalls, whether i'm using linux or Windows, so I always recommend a good router/firewall w/ stateful packet inspection.. beyond that, i do nothing.
