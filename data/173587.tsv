2010-04-27T02:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	barbarella	yes I didn't tell him to do 10.04 untill final
2010-04-27T02:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	barbarella	this whole thing that LTS becomes so much more stable after a point release, I am not so sure about that, since as far as I know LTS is only security updates as well.
2010-04-27T02:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	barbarella	sure, but as far as I know most of those bugs won't get fixed, unless security updates, and so instead got to wait untill the next version of Ubuntu.
