2006-03-08T15:49:00.000Z	jordo23		is that true?
2006-03-08T15:51:00.000Z	jordo23		I was just asking because I was reading a lot of flame wars on Gnome vs. KDE, and if OpenOffice was built in GTK+ then Gnome is a clear leader in the workplace.
2006-03-08T15:51:00.000Z	mdeboer	jordo23	don't read those flame wars. waste of time
