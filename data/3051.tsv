2012-10-16T21:28:00.000Z	john_doe_jr		alright I know that the -i (from the man pages) stands for in place substitution....
2012-10-16T21:28:00.000Z	john_doe_jr		is the brackets like /apache2/ the things we are looking for ?
2012-10-16T21:28:00.000Z	crizis	john_doe_jr	correct way for to do what that command likely is trying to do: sudo a2enmod mod_mono
