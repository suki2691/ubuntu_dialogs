2006-06-12T16:45:00.000Z	cwillu		my mouse broke;  I was attempting to play vegastrike, but it was unplayable (mouse moved every 10 seconds or so);  I killed vega from another machine, x itself seems to be working fine (I'm on it right now), but the mouse is frozen (replugging didn't fix)
2006-06-12T16:46:00.000Z	cwillu		I'd really really prefer not to restart x
2006-06-12T16:47:00.000Z	sladen	cwillu	try starting vegatstrike again and quiting properly
2006-06-12T16:47:00.000Z	sladen	cwillu	that may clear it up
