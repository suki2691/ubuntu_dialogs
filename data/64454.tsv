I reinstalled 10.10 because I was always seeing "Networking Disabled" from the boot os though a live usb was able to see wireless networks properly. Ran the Live USB, went to Disk Util and formatted my hard drive clean. Tried to reinstall Ubuntu 10.10 and Fedora 10 but they both failed. Both installations hanged at the same place: Examining Stroage Devices

2011-11-05T19:15:00.000Z	procrastuabtor		but not viable in the long run
