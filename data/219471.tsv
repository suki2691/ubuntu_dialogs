2009-01-23T03:57:00.000Z	Starhero		I am sure I know how to ask a dam question.
2009-01-23T03:57:00.000Z	Flannel	Starhero	did you have an Ubuntu question?  also, please watch your language.
2009-01-23T03:59:00.000Z	Flannel	Starhero	No.  Try #ubuntu-offtopic instead.  But really, that distros channel is your best bet for support.
