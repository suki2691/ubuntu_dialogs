2005-10-31T16:47:00.000Z	LjL		hello, i've just recently installed ubuntu and have some doubts about repositories... the basic idea is that 1) the "breezy" repository only contains the same packages (and package versions) as there are on the Breezy CD  2) the "breezy-updates" repository contains the same packages as the "breezy" repository, with no new features or new packages, but only fixes to major bugs  3) the "breezy-security" repository contains only packages with fixes 
2005-10-31T16:47:00.000Z	LjL		is this correct?
2005-10-31T16:48:00.000Z	LjL		voodoo: isnt multiverse basically about "non-free" packages?
