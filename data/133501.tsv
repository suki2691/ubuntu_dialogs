2010-01-30T14:36:00.000Z	faileas	lilzeus-web	probably /var/www/???
2010-01-30T14:36:00.000Z	faileas	lilzeus-web	but eh, it might be easier not to use the package manager for that
2010-01-30T14:39:00.000Z	faileas	lilzeus-web	seriously, its probably gonna be easier to download the latest phpbb, untar it appropriately, fix permissions...
