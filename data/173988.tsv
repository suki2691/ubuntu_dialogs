2007-05-22T13:01:00.000Z	mdious	DBO	 sorry to interrupt...what cuts down dramtically on bot attacks?
2007-05-22T13:02:00.000Z	DBO	mdious	moving ssh off port 22 will cut down on brute force bot attacks (provided they are just scanning around)
2007-05-22T13:02:00.000Z	DBO	mdious	obviously not a final answer but it does cut down on simple load issues
2007-05-22T13:03:00.000Z	mdious	DBO	 ah gotcha ;)
