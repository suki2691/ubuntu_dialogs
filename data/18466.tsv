2012-02-29T04:57:00.000Z	munkyBeatz		why does aptitude show Many upgrades/updates from repositories, while apt-get shows system is up to date?
2012-02-29T04:58:00.000Z	Muelli	munkyBeatz	I think aptitude on Ubuntu tries to install recommended packages as well whereas apt-get doesn't necessarily. But I don't fully know
2012-02-29T04:59:00.000Z	munkyBeatz	Muelli	guess it just has to do with how each one handles packages?
2012-02-29T04:59:00.000Z	Muelli	munkyBeatz	yeah. Although not necessarily single packages but the whole package system.
