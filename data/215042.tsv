2005-12-23T15:55:00.000Z	K^Holtz	seanj	how did u boot from it?
2005-12-23T15:56:00.000Z	seanj	K^Holtz	my bios has a setting for boot devices, so i inclued the cd-rw drive as a bootable device, the *first* bootable device so it wouldn't try the HD which already has an OS on it
2005-12-23T15:57:00.000Z	seanj	K^Holtz	some BIOS aren't able to boot off CD.. and that part I haven't gotten past yet :/
