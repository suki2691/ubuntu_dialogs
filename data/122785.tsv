2007-09-05T10:03:00.000Z	jafoo0		Hey guys, I need your opinion, I tried dual booting ubuntu with windows yesterday, and 3/4ths through the ubuntu install, it died (CD was faulty).  I can boot a (working) ubuntu cd and access the NTFS partition, but there aren't any options for a guided install.  I've tried doing a manual install (by creating two partitions), but my computer doesn't want to seem to boot. Any suggestions?
