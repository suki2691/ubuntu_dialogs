2011-07-18T10:58:00.000Z	lollab		hello, I mounted an external harddrive through smbmount, but arabic characters are showed with ???? marks, anybody can help?
2011-07-18T10:58:00.000Z	Autodidactite	lollab	sounds like corruption to me.
2011-07-18T11:00:00.000Z	lollab	Autodidactite	no, I don't think so, I see english characters normally
2011-07-18T11:01:00.000Z	Autodidactite	lollab	then I would say that there is some sort of corruption going on.
