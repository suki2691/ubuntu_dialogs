2012-09-29T14:43:00.000Z	RWOverdijk		Is there an alternative to empathy? I mean, empathy is completely integrated with ubuntu 12.04, and I really don't like it. It doesn't even work (it signs me in everywhere but I always have to manually sign in my msn account)
2012-09-29T14:44:00.000Z	RWOverdijk		If there was a way to solve that, I guess empathy would be fine.

2012-09-29T14:44:00.000Z	RWOverdijk	MonkeyDust	I know pidgin, I usually use pidgin. But it doesn't integrate with ubuntu as well. Like the status thingy and the notifications.
