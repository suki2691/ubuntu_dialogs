2008-02-11T08:07:00.000Z	arpan		hi, my CD drive on my PC has stopped working, and i want to reinstall Ubuntu. I was wondering if it would be possible to install it off my pen drive
2008-02-11T08:08:00.000Z	arpan		my motherboard seems to support booting of usb devices (hdd, fdd, cd) and I do have a 1 GB pen drive
2008-02-11T08:08:00.000Z	arpan		can anyone suggest me a way of doing it?
