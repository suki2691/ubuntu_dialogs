2011-05-26T15:47:00.000Z	supercabbage_uk		I've got Wubi installed, I want to delete the windows partition and make a solely Ubuntu machine. I've backed up my Ubuntu installation. Can I simply wipe the entire HDD and then overwrite the new files with files from the backup? I don't really want to lose my server config I have a LAMP setup and all sorts going on I don't want to redo
2011-05-26T15:49:00.000Z	supercabbage_uk		Anyone?
2011-05-26T15:51:00.000Z	supercabbage_uk		Can anyone confirm this?
