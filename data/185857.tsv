2006-09-11T10:17:00.000Z	Tonren	sp0rk	I just use CLI anyway
2006-09-11T10:17:00.000Z	sp0rk	Tonren	yeah, just do some research and untinstall it, is what i'd do.  I haven't had any issues with it, but you problem sounds annoying
2006-09-11T10:18:00.000Z	Tonren	sp0rk	Yeah, I uninstalled it w/ aptitude
