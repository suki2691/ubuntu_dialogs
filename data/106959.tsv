2008-03-19T21:30:00.000Z	sisif		Hello guys. Can somebody please recomend me a good tool for converting flac to ogg / mp3 ?
2008-03-19T21:31:00.000Z	soundray	sisif	oggenc should read flac
2008-03-19T21:32:00.000Z	sisif	soundray	: preferably a nice GUI tool. I`m not that founded with command line
2008-03-19T21:33:00.000Z	soundray	sisif	oggenc is incredibly easy to use. Use 'man oggenc' and have a go
