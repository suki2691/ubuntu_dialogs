2008-03-03T10:35:00.000Z	D-Unit		wen u do sudo apt-get install then a program, it downloads then installs the program...and with synaptic there is an option to only download an app...i have a ubuntu comp without internet and was hoping i could use that option and get a .deb to transger thru a usb device to that comp so that i have that app (k3b)
2008-03-03T10:35:00.000Z	D-Unit		would that work?
2008-03-03T10:37:00.000Z	tritium	D-Unit	apt-get automatically handles dependencies
2008-03-03T10:38:00.000Z	D-Unit	tritium	wat does handle mean? do i do that on other comp? cuz if thats the plan, it wont work since there is no internet...
