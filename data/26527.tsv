2010-09-14T01:07:00.000Z	aprovencio	dugger5688	where would this encryption config be ?
2010-09-14T01:09:00.000Z	aprovencio	dugger5688	i see only an option to change from 128bits to 56bits and that did not work out
2010-09-14T01:10:00.000Z	dugger5688	aprovencio	I think that's the option. Sorry I have no experience with Windows 7, but that worked for a friend.
