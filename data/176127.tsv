2012-03-07T02:43:00.000Z	junctions		Quick question: How do you upgrade a xubuntu Karmic Koala (9.10, no longer supported) with a bootable USB alternate drive for 11.10?
2012-03-07T02:43:00.000Z	junctions		 (I want to upgrade, not do a fresh install)

2012-03-07T02:44:00.000Z	jhutchins_wk	junctions	So you'd do 10.4, 10.10, 11.4, 11.10
