2010-09-18T17:24:00.000Z	belgianguy		anyone have an idea how I 'drop to cmd line' when booting _any_ linux?
2010-09-18T17:25:00.000Z	belgianguy		is there something like 'hit Esc'?
2010-09-18T17:26:00.000Z	magnetron	belgianguy	ctrl+alt+f1 usually works (ctrl+alt+f7 to get back)
2010-09-18T17:26:00.000Z	belgianguy	magnetron	ah thanks, I'll try that
