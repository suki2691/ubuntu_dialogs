2006-07-03T09:39:00.000Z	Aluvia		I have a problem: I'm unable to view a file (or rather, I get caught in an eternal loop that seems to require xkill to end) using Dapper on a dvd I burned under WinXP.  The file contains about 1000 folders, each containing at least one file.  I was able to transfer the file to my HD, but I got caught in another seemingly eternal loop on folder 500-something (it was an mp3).  Can anyone help?
