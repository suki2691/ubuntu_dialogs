2011-08-23T08:11:00.000Z	HeGuru	Onlyodin	try GPointingDeviceSetting, not sure if it has that setting though
2011-08-23T08:14:00.000Z	Onlyodin	HeGuru	is GPointingDeviceSettings in gconf-editor or something?
2011-08-23T08:15:00.000Z	HeGuru	Onlyodin	you have to install gpointing-device-settings package
2011-08-23T08:16:00.000Z	Onlyodin	HeGuru	thanks, looking now.
