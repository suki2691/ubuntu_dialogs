I've had two in last few days, one just after updating the kernel, so I tought that might have caused it, but now I'm thinking maybe it could be the fglrx drivers causing it , since I enabled them at about the same time.

2006-06-20T05:49:00.000Z	rpedro_	crimsun	you wouldn't happen to know if there are 'workarounds', or possibly some bug I can track till the issue is resolved?
2006-06-20T05:50:00.000Z	crimsun	rpedro_	I have no idea; there may be; check the wiki, #ati on this network, and the ATI forums
