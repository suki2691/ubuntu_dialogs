2006-10-14T13:21:00.000Z	XiXaQ		I just installed nx client. How do I run it?
2006-10-14T13:23:00.000Z	ArrenLex	XiXaQ	is your question is "how does this program work", have you looked at the documentation? If your question is "where can I find the program it installed", do "dpkg -L <package>" to list all the files for that package.
