2007-09-13T09:35:00.000Z	blkdg		hi, I was reading https://jdk-distros.dev.java.net/ubuntu.html because I found a press release that said that ubuntu and debian were granted licences to distriibute Java JDK.  Is this package shipped on the CD or does my machine need to be connected to the internet to get these packages?
2007-09-13T09:37:00.000Z	blkdg		does the current stable version of Ubuntu / Kubuntu ship with the JDK?
2007-09-13T09:37:00.000Z	blkdg		ok, thanks pedahzur
