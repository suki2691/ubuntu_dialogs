2007-12-21T06:12:00.000Z	Urim	Jack_Sparrow	i installed winxp first from toshiba recovery disk.. then installed ubuntu 7.10... but i am not able to boot back to winxp getting error 29: disk write error... is that cuz the toshiba-ms disk is a recovery disk not installer
2007-12-21T06:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Urim	can you get into ubuntu?
