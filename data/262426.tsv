2007-05-05T06:57:00.000Z	deejay		I have a little problem with changing my screen resolution to above 1024*786, it is not in the drop down list when i enter the "Screen Resolution" screen, is there somewhere I need to edit to make a resolution like 1600*1200 available?
2007-05-05T06:57:00.000Z	deejay		Ah hmm
2007-05-05T06:57:00.000Z	deejay		Looked there, should i just change the 1024*786 to something higher?
