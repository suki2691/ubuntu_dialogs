2006-03-27T14:54:00.000Z	counterclockwise		hi, I'm trying to build firefox and it says it needs gtk+-2.0 package. "locate gtk+-2.0.pc" only finds a file on my windows partition. I looked through the available development packages in synaptic and it's not obvious what deb do I need to install
2006-03-27T14:55:00.000Z	nickrud	counterclockwise	libgtk2.0-dev
2006-03-27T14:58:00.000Z	nickrud	counterclockwise	very wierd since it's in main to begin with
