2006-05-25T07:06:00.000Z	arrick		guys, I have a pc here that wont install any windows OS(bluescreens at reboot), will boot ubuntu server, wont boot Ubuntu default, and freezes at the "Grub Loading, Please Wait....." with the default install. This is a 500mhz, 374mb Ram pc, ran checkit and it tells me everything is good. Any suggestions?
