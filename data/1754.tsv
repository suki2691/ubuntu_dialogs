2012-08-13T16:56:00.000Z	Blazemore		How can I manage my gnome keyring? change passwords etc? preferably from GUI
2012-08-13T16:56:00.000Z	bobweaver	Blazemore	 use seahorse
2012-08-13T16:57:00.000Z	Blazemore	bobweaver	I didn't realise seahorse did that. I've just been using it for pgp keys
2012-08-13T16:59:00.000Z	bobweaver	Blazemore	 like ActionParsnip  said just type in passwords (you can also type in seahorse) and get the same thing.
