2009-01-25T02:56:00.000Z	Deathspike		Question: Does NTFS actually have a negative impact on performance when comparing with ... EFS3 (whatever the partition name was)?
2009-01-25T02:57:00.000Z	Deathspike		Yeah, EXT. But does it affect performance?
2009-01-25T02:58:00.000Z	Deathspike		I've had some real bad experiences with GRUB/EXT3 and rather avoid it for my other box.
