2004-11-04T14:37:00.000Z	Paleon		here's what I hope is a simple Gnome question.  I seem to have lost the feature where active programs are listed at the bottom of the screen.  I still have the panel.  It's jsut empty no matter how many apps I have open.
2004-11-04T14:37:00.000Z	Paleon		How do I get it back?
2004-11-04T14:38:00.000Z	Zindar	Paleon	right click.. add to panel...
2004-11-04T14:38:00.000Z	Zindar	Paleon	and then it's named something with window list or whatever
