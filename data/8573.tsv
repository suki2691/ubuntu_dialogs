2012-03-27T03:09:00.000Z	benwalburn		I'm trying to use wget to download a 105mb file on a poor connection, but the download always completes at around 20mb higher than it's supposed to be. What am I doing wrong?

2012-03-27T03:12:00.000Z	benwalburn	haz3lnut	I've downloaded the file 4 times and I get a different size each time
2012-03-27T03:12:00.000Z	haz3lnut	benwalburn	that's a problem
