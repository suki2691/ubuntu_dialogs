2005-03-17T12:04:00.000Z	noddaba		I've used Debian for years, today was my first time installing Ubuntu (Warty).  WHen running Debian, I was using unstable sources.  Would the equivalent in Ubuntu be Hoary?
2005-03-17T12:05:00.000Z	Xenguy	noddaba	pretty much, except that I think of Hoary as Experimental ;-)
2005-03-17T12:05:00.000Z	noddaba	Xenguy	heh.  so then I shouldn't try dling the Hoary install CD's?  (and what is Array-6, btw?)
2005-03-17T12:07:00.000Z	Xenguy	noddaba	I can't offer any specific advice about Hoary - I don't use it.  Some people do tho I hear.
