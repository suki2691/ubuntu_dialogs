2006-12-19T12:29:00.000Z	touchscreen		I'm trying to get my Aspen touchscreen to work with Kubuntu, but my limited driver knowledge of Linux is proving to be challenging. It connects VIA USB, and Aspen's site provides drivers for Mandrake, Fedora, and SUSE, but it isn't so kind as to tell us how to install them, or how to modify them for Ubuntu. Can someone please walk me through this? Thanks.
