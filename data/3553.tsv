2012-06-04T09:34:00.000Z	coraxx	jagginess	(remember criteria: no use of VMWare softwae)
2012-06-04T09:35:00.000Z	jagginess	coraxx	dunno what you mean.. .vmdk that's sort of a closed format.. don't complain if the merge fails.
2012-06-04T09:38:00.000Z	coraxx	jagginess	in order to use VMWare software I will need to install it ...since there is no .deb-package for it, then the installation procedure is script-based and difficult to manage....so therefore I will not be installing vmware software ... (unless there is a .deb package for it)... so I'm looking for a tool that cn merge the files.  Not complaining about any error, cuz I haven't merged...
