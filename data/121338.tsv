2007-09-21T15:28:00.000Z	z9999		Using ubuntu 6.06. I closed the lid on the notebook yesterday and opened it today, and the wireless connection shows active, but disconnected. I tried deactivating and activating it which worked last time, but not this time. How to I reconnect to the router?

2007-09-21T15:30:00.000Z	jaggz1		I've had that problem.. (not with opening/closing.. just sometimes it happens)
2007-09-21T15:31:00.000Z	z9999	jaggz1	I'll give that a try when it's the other computers aren't using it. Thanks.
