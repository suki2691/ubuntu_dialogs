2006-07-31T15:43:00.000Z	htv8		if I want to install ubuntu, what iso file do i have to download? http://nl.releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/
2006-07-31T15:44:00.000Z	htv8		if you download the desktop CD (so you can try ubuntu without installing), can you still install with the same .iso afterwards?

2006-07-31T15:47:00.000Z	Madpilot	htv8	when you're running the liveCD, there's an "Install" icon on the desktop; that will do the install - including partitioning- for you
