2011-06-08T19:39:00.000Z	econdudeawesome		Hey all! How do I make a bash script run at startup--not at login, but at startup? (goal is to write a bash script to send me output of ifconfig at startup)
2011-06-08T19:39:00.000Z	rumpe1	econdudeawesome	add it to /etc/rc.local
2011-06-08T19:40:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	rumpe1	thats it? Seems to easy :-)
2011-06-08T19:43:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	rumpe1	what extension do I need to save the bash script as? .sh?
