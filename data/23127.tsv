2011-10-29T17:13:00.000Z	gregor3000		clonezilla is a cloning distribution to clone hard disks. it has an ubuntu based and debian based version.
2011-10-29T17:13:00.000Z	gregor3000		however mine doesn't boot.
2011-10-29T17:14:00.000Z	iceflatline	gregor3000	when you say it doesn't boot you mean it gets to a point and you can't see anything on the screen?
