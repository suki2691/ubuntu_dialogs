2012-03-06T22:26:00.000Z	theadmin	f4stra	For example, http://www.google.ru/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cts=1331054748792&ved=0CCQQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2F&ei=oEhWT56KGYLS4QTI1pCvCg&usg=AFQjCNFbkYxzDIXuUwBwoB2QRwTWALaVrQ -- not just http://example.org
2012-03-06T22:33:00.000Z	f4stra	theadmin	whats that? how did you get that? how do i decipher the addresses from the page source?
