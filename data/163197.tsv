2007-07-28T12:49:00.000Z	user1		Hi, I am trying to install Ubuntu 7.04 on a laptop ( ASUS PRO31S), installation keeps falls to a shell -- (initramfs) and I cannot proceed further. Could any one help?
2007-07-28T12:49:00.000Z	lietu	user1	does it give you any errors?
2007-07-28T12:52:00.000Z	lietu	user1	have you tried booting with "debugging options" like nodma or noapic?
2007-07-28T12:54:00.000Z	lietu	user1	sorry, I'm out of ideas, I've seen many people complain about the same problem, but haven't seen any fixes to it
