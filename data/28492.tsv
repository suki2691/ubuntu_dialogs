2010-08-18T18:16:00.000Z	luist	ilovefairuz	well anywhere... im trying to access it from inside the liveCD
2010-08-18T18:16:00.000Z	luist	ilovefairuz	im trying to copy a /boot folder to be able to boot that image...
2010-08-18T18:18:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	luist	your best shot is to attach it into an existing VM or something and ssh to it, i've searched before for a tool to mount virtualbox partitions and couldn't find much
