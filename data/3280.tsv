2012-05-04T03:28:00.000Z	Praxi		Where is a good place to ask about rails ide's on ubuntu.  Specifically, I want a notepad++ style thing that looks like this http://imagebin.org/210869 but without all the bloat.  ie tabbed editor, file explorer thing on the left, console/terminal on the bottom.  syntax? highlighting for the editor.  I tried Jedit, but its file explorer was hideous
