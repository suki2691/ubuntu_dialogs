2010-03-11T05:55:00.000Z	proman		here is a tricky one. I have been using ubuntu for a while on my netbook and used it on the laptop I had before with no problems. I have been trying to run linux on my PC. Mandriva, Suse, and ubuntu 64 bit installed ok but all had the same problem. The pc is connected to the internet with regular ethernet cable. I can open google with all their variations(gmail, etc). I can't open anything else. They cant even connect to do updates. T
