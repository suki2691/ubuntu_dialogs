2009-10-06T14:51:00.000Z	RadJohn		Does anyone know anything about installing an ATI Radeon X1300 video card in Ubuntu 8.04?
2009-10-06T14:52:00.000Z	RadJohn		ï»¿I think I have tried everything to get my Radeon X1300 to work on Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.  I am using my motherboard's onboard graphics, and surprisingly I am able to get some Compiz desktop effects (wobbly windows, ...), but would really like to know why Ubuntu won't finish startup when attempting to use the Radeon X1300 video card.  Any suggestions?
