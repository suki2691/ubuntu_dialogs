2008-01-09T22:14:00.000Z	anipy		i have mounted a windows share which i have browsed with nautilus (ubuntu 7.10). where do i find the configuration of that now? i can't find the mount entry in /etc/fstab, /media/ nor /mount/

2008-01-09T22:16:00.000Z	anipy	NixerX_	but the share is already mounted, isn't it? i can see it in the menue panel "Places -> My-shared-name" and in the side-panel of nautilus.
2008-01-09T22:16:00.000Z	anipy	NixerX_	and it works perfectly
