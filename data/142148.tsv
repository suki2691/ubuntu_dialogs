2007-06-19T09:30:00.000Z	pike__		you guys aware of problems with vmlinuz-2.6.20-16-generic and nvidia? i dont feel like investigating so ill just use 15 kernel instead

2007-06-19T09:32:00.000Z	pike__	PurpZeY	yeah i manually installed with same issue. i used nvidia.sh first actually and package and old kernel last resort
2007-06-19T09:33:00.000Z	PurpZeY	pike__	I upgraded on my desktop which is an nvdia with no worries, but I am still hesitant to make the jump on my laptop as I hear it causes issues...although I am running an intel chipset over here.
