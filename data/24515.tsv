2010-10-11T06:15:00.000Z	rypervenche		I just upgraded to Maverick, and when I start my computer, on the bottom of my screen I keep getting windows that open then close very quickly. I think it says configuring or something on them. Has anyone experienced this?
2010-10-11T06:17:00.000Z	rypervenche		Where can I find the log of my upgrade to Maverick?
