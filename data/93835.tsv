2008-06-09T02:14:00.000Z	soundray	absnt	not necessary. Go through System-Admin-Hardware Drivers, then reboot
2008-06-09T02:14:00.000Z	absnt	soundray	when installing the drivers from nvidia.com it requires me to not be running a xserver
2008-06-09T02:15:00.000Z	soundray	absnt	you shouldn't install those if you can at all avoid it
