2007-05-28T10:38:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	Freddie5	you must mount the drive you want to write first
2007-05-28T10:39:00.000Z	Freddie5	Ropechoborra	im having issues getting windows to boot when i have two hard drives plugged in, so im just going to use the live cd to get one document file that i need from this hard drive. do i just say mount /dev/hd0 or whatever? its been awhile since ive physically mounted something
