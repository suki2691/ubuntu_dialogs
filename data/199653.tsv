2008-05-04T08:10:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Aaron_Mason	 ive been having issues with my SATA and IDE burners under  hardy.. but dident have any issues under 7.10 - Odd that you are having issues.  You might want to check the forums.
2008-05-04T08:10:00.000Z	Aaron_Mason	Dr_willis	i've had no problems with burners in the past... i'll have a look
2008-05-04T08:11:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Aaron_Mason	 yep. Ive had no issues in the past.. and now - all sorts of issues. :(
