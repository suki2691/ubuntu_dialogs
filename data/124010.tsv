2007-09-07T14:46:00.000Z	jrib	randy026	system -> preferences -> themes
2007-09-07T14:47:00.000Z	randy026	jrib	what about if I am using compiz-fusion and emerald does that make a difference?
2007-09-07T14:47:00.000Z	jrib	randy026	I don't think so, but give it a try and come back if it does.  You may want to ask in #ubuntu-effects if what I said doesn't work
