2009-05-08T18:16:00.000Z	hackoidz	tdn	what converter are you using?
2009-05-08T18:16:00.000Z	tdn	hackoidz	no matter. I install what you recommend. It just needs to be simple.
2009-05-08T18:17:00.000Z	tdn	hackoidz	it is because I have ripped all my music in FLAC and when I need to play it on my mp3 player, I need to convert it to mp3, because it cannot play FLAC.
