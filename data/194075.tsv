2006-03-20T09:56:00.000Z	jonnyzero		I'm trying to burn the flight5 iso to a CD-RW disc under Breezy, but the disc doesn't seem to be becoming bootable. My machine just hangs with Boot CD: on the screen. After burning the disc won't mount, claiming wrong fs type. Do I have to burn in some special mode? DAO? to use a rewritable disc to boot do I have to set something special before burning?
