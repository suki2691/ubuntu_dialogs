2011-05-07T15:11:00.000Z	AlanBell		I have a problem booting ubuntu natty 64 bit on my laptop bug 774349
2011-05-07T15:12:00.000Z	AlanBell		any idea how to get it to boot, or whether installing Maverick then upgrading to Natty would work? don't really want to install, upgrade and break
2011-05-07T15:14:00.000Z	abrakazam	AlanBell	have you tried the 10.10 livecd?
2011-05-07T15:15:00.000Z	abrakazam	AlanBell	if maverick 64 bit works for you, stay with it until its fixed in natty
