2009-11-05T03:23:00.000Z	Pholious		Does anyone know why there's no MenuBar in my Terminal? or is it new in karmic 9.10? http://nopaste.info/8179603c82.html (it does have "Show MenuBar enables with right-click)
2009-11-05T03:24:00.000Z	Pholious		btw, anyone on xchat here? xchat should also have a menu bar right?

2009-11-05T03:24:00.000Z	trism	Pholious	oh sorry, confused what you were talking about, nm
