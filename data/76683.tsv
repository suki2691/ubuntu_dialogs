2008-10-23T00:00:00.000Z	fastkeys38	TJ-42	gparted or partedmagic
2008-10-23T00:39:00.000Z	fastkeys38	TJ-42	I'd have thought it would make little difference on a single home PC. On a server with millions of files and hundreds of concurrent accesses it makes a huge difference
2008-10-23T00:40:00.000Z	TJ-42	fastkeys38	oh ok, thanks
