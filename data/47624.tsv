2011-09-04T16:59:00.000Z	PsiKloPx		g'morning, is it possible to change the default email client to Thunderbird in the messaging menu? I've already made the change in 'Preferred Applications' but the messaging menu will only launch Evolution.

2011-09-04T17:00:00.000Z	PsiKloPx	theadmin	Thanks, guess I'll have to wait for .10...Google wasn't much help...
