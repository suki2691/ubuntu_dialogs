2010-11-17T13:51:00.000Z	replicasex		I have a whooole bunch of epub files I'd like to extract ... does anybody know how I would, say, extract numerous separate epub files in a dir?
2010-11-17T13:53:00.000Z	rautamiekka	replicasex	Have you tried using 7-Zip or WinRAR on one of the packs to see if it's supported ?
2010-11-17T13:54:00.000Z	replicasex	rautamiekka	winrar?  Really? the default archive package manager seems to do fine I just want to do it all en masse
2010-11-17T13:55:00.000Z	rautamiekka	replicasex	Well, any decompressor. Just used these two as likely ones supporting it.
