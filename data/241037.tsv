2006-09-05T08:24:00.000Z	hondje	klaxian	No, but Evolution stopped wanting to sign my emails recently :-/
2006-09-05T08:24:00.000Z	klaxian	hondje	that sucks...it seems evolution is still working for me
2006-09-05T08:25:00.000Z	hondje	klaxian	so probably unrelated then...though I usually don't use seahorse
