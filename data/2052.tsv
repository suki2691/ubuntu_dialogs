2012-07-11T02:33:00.000Z	philmeister		Hello. I have two monitors set up in twinview (nvidia). Though everytime i boot my computer, only my right monitor works and i have to go into nvidia x server settings to enable my primary one
2012-07-11T02:33:00.000Z	philmeister		Anybody got a clue what the problem might be?
