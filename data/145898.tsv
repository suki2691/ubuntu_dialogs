2007-02-15T10:06:00.000Z	Vilhelms		I just installed xubuntu-desktop and have ran it successfully, but whenever I try to click on an icon on my desktop my whole desktop moves (including the background) each click it toggles from moving up and down, and I can't click on anything because of it. Why would this be? Does anyone have any idea on how I could fix this?
