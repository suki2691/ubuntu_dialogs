2009-02-14T03:42:00.000Z	illumin8		Hello everyone, i realize my question is a slight matter of opinion, and have read the diffirences in the distros, but which version of ubuntu 8.04 or 8.10 would be a wiser choice for a new linux user?
2009-02-14T03:44:00.000Z	macd_	illumin8	being a new user, I dont think either version will present or take away any challenges in learning Linux, however the LTS version are supported longer, and tend to be more stable (however not as cutting edge)
2009-02-14T03:46:00.000Z	illumin8	macd_	i am interested in haveing a fast stable system that i can run some games, wine based software (windows type things) and learn to replace them with ubuntu alternatives as i go. would 8.04 function well for this generally (again i realize its specific to the software and user)
2009-02-14T03:47:00.000Z	macd_	illumin8	I would be all over 8.04 if I were you, already ;)
