2007-07-16T07:11:00.000Z	MasterNe0		Does anyone know how to grow the ext3 volume? I got both windows and ubuntu installed. Want to divert some windows space over to ubuntu.
2007-07-16T07:12:00.000Z	Flannel	MasterNe0	ext3 can only be expanded backwards (foot can move, head can't).  Depending on the size of your partitions, you can manuever it around and get it to work if you're moving the head though
2007-07-16T07:13:00.000Z	Flannel	MasterNe0	How much space you looking to give Ubuntu?  And how much space (actual space, not just partition size) is it already using?
2007-07-16T07:14:00.000Z	Flannel	MasterNe0	and how much space is Ubuntu currently using?  (Less than 10?)
