2008-12-24T00:31:00.000Z	justizin	mezquitale	install rdesktop, or do what ASULutzy said. :)
2008-12-24T00:36:00.000Z	mezquitale	justizin	canI be logged on to the XP machine when I log in remotely or will I have to log out first???
2008-12-24T00:40:00.000Z	mezquitale	justizin	forget it, I figured it out, I didnt have a password set on my XP machine, thank you for the 411, rdesktop works like a charm!  :-)
