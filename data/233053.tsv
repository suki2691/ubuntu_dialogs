2010-02-09T20:12:00.000Z	Tek-5-8-6		What is the next step if the ubuntu-9.10-alternate disc was not able to load the drive for my on board RAID ?

2010-02-09T20:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	Tek-5-8-6	bios raid is fakeraid. true hardware raid cards are 600 $ and up
2010-02-09T20:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	Tek-5-8-6	yes you need the desktop cd as i said. read the wiki page
