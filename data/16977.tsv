2011-07-02T03:29:00.000Z	KM0201	ramzy_	i disagree, i think xfce has denegrated horribly
2011-07-02T03:30:00.000Z	ramzy_	KM0201	you mean from a memory consumption point of view?
2011-07-02T03:31:00.000Z	KM0201	ramzy_	i mean from memory consumption, to overall bloat... Xfce, part of its appeal, used to be that it was less bloated than Gnome or KDE... now, IMO.. it's just as bloated (maybe a bit less so) than both of them..
