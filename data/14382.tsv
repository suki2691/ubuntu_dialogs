2011-05-12T19:46:00.000Z	OttifantSir		I didn't think it possible, but I'm going to give up Ubuntu because of Unity. It has given me naught but problems since I installed it on my new laptop. Distro-searching, here I come....

2011-05-12T19:48:00.000Z	Trey-		just because you hate unity doesn't mean you need to give up ubuntu because quite frankly I'm not sure about you but I don't have the time to sit there and compile gentoo kernels over and over again to get it just right
2011-05-12T19:48:00.000Z	OttifantSir	Trey-	Had forgotten that. Will try that as a last-ditch effort before I try Unity Linux or Ubuntu Customization Kit and other distros
