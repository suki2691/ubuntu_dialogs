2005-09-12T15:46:00.000Z	LasseL	GhostFreeman	there is a program called Mail Notification you can try
2005-09-12T15:47:00.000Z	LasseL	GhostFreeman	try searching for it in synaptic
2005-09-12T15:47:00.000Z	LasseL	GhostFreeman	be warned that Mail Notification core dumps on my machine ... but when it works it looks great :)
