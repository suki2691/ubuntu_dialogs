2009-06-17T09:04:00.000Z	Loganhoup		Coulse someone help me, I'm having sound issues. I can hear all sound that plays through flash (youtube etc.) but I can't hear sound coming from banshee or various other programs. Looking at pulseaudio it says my sink is auto_null and it is using auto_null.monitor under sources. it also has alsa_input.pci_1002_4370_sound_card_0_alsa_capture_0 under sources. ATI IXP AC97 Any help is appreciated. thanks
