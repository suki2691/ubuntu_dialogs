2009-08-21T08:19:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	puff	that's what you get from the error message when runningb mysql
2009-08-21T08:20:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	puff	what needs to start is mysqld but it needs to be configured first
2009-08-21T08:40:00.000Z	Irishmanluke	puff	nmvictor so it seems like we need to figure out some way to start mysqld or mysqld_safe but nothings working?
