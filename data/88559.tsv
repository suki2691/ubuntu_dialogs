2008-12-18T09:25:00.000Z	ASULutzy		So still the question, does anyone know how to make metacity the default instead of compiz? I'm sure I could add something to gnome sessions via system->preferences->sessions, but I'd really like to just know where the default config is stored

2008-12-20T01:30:00.000Z	fryguy	ASULutzy	that is only the case if you have raid support or ahci enabled in the bios, if neither of these are enabled then it will install just fine with no extra drivers
