2008-12-09T11:09:00.000Z	arrenlex	gaelfx	That's 17 mb/s, that's more than I get out of USB usually. :)
2008-12-09T11:10:00.000Z	arrenlex	gaelfx	Sorry, I misread. That's 34mb/s.
2008-12-09T11:10:00.000Z	gaelfx	arrenlex	sorry, maybe I was unclear, the speed is fine for the first 140MB chunk, but after that, it slows almost to a halt
