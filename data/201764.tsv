2007-02-27T17:54:00.000Z	epignosis		I just checked for upgrades with the upgrade manager and got the following message:
2007-02-27T17:54:00.000Z	epignosis		Not all updates can be installed. Run a distribution upgrade, to install as many updates as possible. This can be caused by an uncompleted upgrade, unofficial software packages, or by running a development version. I have been running 7.04 for a week now
