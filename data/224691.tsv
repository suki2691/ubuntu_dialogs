2008-04-26T14:46:00.000Z	Saladin		Hey guys, any ideas why flash videos have suddenly stopped working for me, in terms of sound. Video is fine, but no sound plays at all. I have played around with the ALSA Mixer (Kudos for the new interface for that) but nothing seems to work. All other sound seems to be fine
