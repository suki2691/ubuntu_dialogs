2007-12-26T13:26:00.000Z	jgoo		Yes, torrents work - no I don't like this app and I am trying to find out where it caches the torrent files, and why isn't there a list of current sessions...
2007-12-26T13:26:00.000Z	jgoo		Anyone use this BitTorrent (default) handler for torrents?
2007-12-26T13:26:00.000Z	HardDisk	jgoo	you should be using www.deluge-torrent.org :)
