2012-04-26T21:03:00.000Z	GriGi		Hi, I just updated 11.10 to 12.04 and got little problem with Unity :/. In 11.10 bar on the left was "fixed" but it was hiding when I maximalized something or drag some window over that bar. But now it doesn't hide :/. I found option in Settings -> Apperance, called "autohide", but then bar hide even when nothing is maximised.
2012-04-26T21:04:00.000Z	GriGi		I want it to hide when some window is maximalised, but when everything is minimalised it shouldn't hide :/. Can I do that? I was trying MyUnity, but it have only the same option like Settings -> Apperance.

2012-04-26T21:05:00.000Z	GriGi	Dan-The-Man	Yes, it was window dodge :/. Im afraid that you're right, it's not a bug it's a feature -,-.
