2006-05-15T10:42:00.000Z	motoko		what do I run to reconfigure my video settings?
2006-05-15T10:43:00.000Z	Ademan	motoko	what exactly do you want to reconfigure?
2006-05-15T10:44:00.000Z	motoko	Ademan	I just installed Ubuntu and X is failing. It's because I have a Radeon X1300 which isn't supported by the ATI driver yet but it's trying to use it.
