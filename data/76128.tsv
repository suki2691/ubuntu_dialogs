2009-04-24T22:02:00.000Z	geboy	porter1	i know...back then after a fresh install of the old version, i always have to do hardware driver download for activating my fxlgr (or something) driver for the ati card. now, it said there is no driver needed on the list
2009-04-24T22:03:00.000Z	porter1	geboy	maybe it's already installed? Have you tried running soemthing that is graphics intensive to see if it is working?
2009-04-24T22:04:00.000Z	geboy	porter1	i can't activate the extra setings on the appeariance window
