2009-03-28T23:30:00.000Z	Hobz		Hi, I'm having trouble getting the audio to work with vlc under Ibex.  I've played with the output settings (oss, alsa, etc.) but it isn't working!  Any advice?
2009-03-28T23:32:00.000Z	Hobz		anybody?  VLC audio not working, yet all other audio works?

2009-03-28T23:33:00.000Z	Hobz	SlimeyPete	I've been through ALSA and OSS modules.  Same problem
