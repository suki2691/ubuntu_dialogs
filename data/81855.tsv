2008-12-13T10:49:00.000Z	Wickk		I'm having a problem trying to reinstall xchat. I keep getting the error message "configure: error: 'Cannot find glib' and I've tried searching for it in the repos and I can't find it. I'm running off intrepid and aren't sure what the name of the library is that I would need.
2008-12-13T10:50:00.000Z	fryguy	Wickk	install libglib2.0-dev and see if that fixes it
2008-12-13T10:51:00.000Z	Wickk	fryguy	installing now, will let you know if it works or not :)
2008-12-13T10:58:00.000Z	Wickk	fryguy	libglib2.0-dev helped but now it's telling me that I don't have gtk installed and I'm pretty sure I do <.<;; and the only one in the repos is for KDE4 which I don't think would help much
