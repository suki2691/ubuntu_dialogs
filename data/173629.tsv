2010-06-20T02:35:00.000Z	Eko		Hey guys.  Just switched to ubuntu... how do I configure upstart services?  There seems to be a lot of legacy documentation about the init/rc system, and nothing about setting up what starts up when with upstart, let alone a graphical tool for it.
2010-06-20T02:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Eko	yeah a lot of the documention is old, but by 10.10 it seems a lot of it will be re done on a newer sub site
2010-06-20T02:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Eko	well same site, but re done , or something
2010-06-20T02:36:00.000Z	Eko	sebsebseb	Yes, I read through that, but I can't find any of the files that are supposed to have those event and startup setups
