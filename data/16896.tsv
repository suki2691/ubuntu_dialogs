2012-02-15T16:10:00.000Z	kaiowas		Hi, just wondering if anyone here has installed Ubuntu on a Mac and could answer a couple of questions?
2012-02-15T16:11:00.000Z	kaiowas		How much space will Ubuntu take installed? I thought 20gb should be enough for a Ubuntu partition, so i can play around some with it.

2012-02-15T16:13:00.000Z	kaiowas	Myrtti	First time install.. so this will be just a partition so i can learn Ubuntu.
