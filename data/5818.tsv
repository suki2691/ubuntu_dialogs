2012-02-16T04:39:00.000Z	sere		i have a 1000gig portable drive and i only had it for a a month, and used about 500gig...not sure why but in linux it slowly stopped reading it and now in winblows....i believe its the drive at fault but my question is what can cause this so early
2012-02-16T04:39:00.000Z	sere		is it already bad?
