2009-09-16T21:09:00.000Z	jeromel		I have a problem with my partitions. I want to update the size of my linux partition, but Gparted does not accept that. Can anyone say me why?
2009-09-16T21:10:00.000Z	nooc	jeromel	probably the partition is monted, try tu use a boot cd
2009-09-16T21:11:00.000Z	jeromel	nooc	: no I used a boot cd. adalall : I moved the free space after my partition I want to resize
