2010-07-23T03:44:00.000Z	WillWork4Foo		hi all... this is a painfully n00b kinda question to ask, but - if I decide I want to install and try out xinetd and then change my mind, after I do sudo apt-get remove xinetd how do I get back to the good old-fashioned inetd?
2010-07-23T03:44:00.000Z	WillWork4Foo		apt-get install inetd doesn't seem to work.
2010-07-23T03:45:00.000Z	^peanut^	WillWork4Foo	why not use xinitd?
2010-07-23T03:45:00.000Z	WillWork4Foo	^peanut^	things like update-inetd don't work
