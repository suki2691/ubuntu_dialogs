2008-07-21T03:25:00.000Z	soundray	skylighter	it doesn't stand for anything now. Historically, it's 'advanced package tool'
2008-07-21T03:28:00.000Z	soundray	skylighter	Ubuntu tends to provide tried and tested software instead of the bleeding edge
2008-07-21T03:29:00.000Z	soundray	skylighter	you can check the backports and proposed repository for more recent (and somewhat more risky) packages
