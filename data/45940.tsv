2010-06-08T08:13:00.000Z	Aeroraptor		So I'm about to install ubuntu on my laptop again. I have 4GB RAM and am wondering if I should go with the 64bit version instead of the 32 to be able to access the extra ~700MB of RAM. I won't be doint anything that requires that much RAM but being able to access it could be nice. Thoughts?

2010-06-08T08:15:00.000Z	Aeroraptor	codebrainz	I have a core2duo, so yeah it's 64bit - will there be any issues in so far as applications (especially media codecs) are concerned?
