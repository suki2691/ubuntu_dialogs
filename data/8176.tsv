2011-10-31T20:22:00.000Z	Guest24012	ActionParsnip	that's not my concern or what I was getting at. I just noticed when I was in the home dir of my user, I didn't have any pictures/desktop/documents/videos folders like you get by default. So my question is, are those items created upon system login for the first user? Would it be fixed by me putting this drive back in my desktop and booting it up?
