2008-12-01T23:06:00.000Z	Rainarrow	matitaccia	of course, the speed depends on what torrent you are using..
2008-12-01T23:06:00.000Z	matitaccia	Rainarrow	kk... yeah I know that I was using azureus and utorrent on windows.
2008-12-01T23:08:00.000Z	Rainarrow	matitaccia	it's fine to try things out of course
