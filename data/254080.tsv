2010-05-07T23:01:00.000Z	ChrisC_		Where do I get support for Virtual box. I'm sure my problem is simple.
2010-05-07T23:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ChrisC_	 perhaps start with the vbox homepage/forums and the manual?
2010-05-07T23:03:00.000Z	ChrisC_	Dr_Willis	Maybe you  could help, is it a common problem after a kernel update to get this non compiling error?
2010-05-07T23:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ChrisC_	 I got the vbox ose working with no hassles.  Not seen any errors with it
