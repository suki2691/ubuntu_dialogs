2009-02-05T19:59:00.000Z	beamsjr		So is there any other troubleshooting I can do to try and figure out why I get error 17 at grub?
2009-02-05T20:00:00.000Z	beamsjr		I have used this raid 5 on windows and it came up fine/
2009-02-05T20:01:00.000Z	JackWinter	beamsjr	i don't know grub all that well.  but the supergrub cd has come in handy at times :)
