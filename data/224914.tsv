2005-08-07T14:18:00.000Z	Raf99		when installing linux driver (which is a simple sh "file"), its telling me to exit X-server.  Is this implying to exit the GUI and be at a root terminal ?

2005-08-07T14:23:00.000Z	Raf99	cafuego	- if I did want to install a updated driver though, how would I exit X server todo this installation properly? ( will I ever need to ? )
