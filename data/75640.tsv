2011-03-05T20:18:00.000Z	aadem		i just installed ubuntu on my girlfriends dads computer because he kept getting viruses surfing the web.  Every time ubuntu loads , even during the install, the screen flashes and scrambles at least once every 30 seconds.  Ive already installed the proprietary drivers that ubuntu found, this IS a display driver issue correct?
2011-03-05T20:19:00.000Z	ruan	aadem	looks like a driver issue
2011-03-05T20:20:00.000Z	ruan	aadem	could possibly be the monitor,does it scramble after 30 seconds in the bios?
2011-03-05T20:21:00.000Z	ruan	aadem	ah ok
