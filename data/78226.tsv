2008-10-17T03:17:00.000Z	erUSUL		 PoisonArrow which driver?
2008-10-17T03:17:00.000Z	PoisonArrow	erUSUL	the Realtek rtl8187b
2008-10-17T03:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	PoisonArrow	the new kernel of 8.10 (2.6.27) got support for that chips (a patch was added) so the new ubuntu supports it
2008-10-17T03:20:00.000Z	PoisonArrow	erUSUL	I see. would you happen to know what I might need to do to get the drivers working under another distro with the kernel 2.6.25. Would I only need the header files for 2.6.27? or would I need the patch also?
