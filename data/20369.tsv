2011-01-14T12:10:00.000Z	Valathar		Put Ubuntu on a 7 year old Dell laptop that had bit the dust, 48 hours ago.  Fell in LOVE instantly... now I got it on my netbook too :)
2011-01-14T12:11:00.000Z	tntc	Valathar	haha! Awesome! I'm seriously considering putting Ubuntu on my Macbook Pro and Mac Mini because I'm sick of not being able to rip DVDs or use Python.
2011-01-14T12:12:00.000Z	Valathar	tntc	- I'm seriously loving it.  I was ready to buy a new computer... they were getting so slow with Windows.  Now, they're faster than the day they were new... both of them.  Install was easy with few issues, and good documentation available for those issues... I'm definitely converted.
