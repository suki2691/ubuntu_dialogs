2010-07-08T01:51:00.000Z	glace	thune3	er.. I use "less" in gnome-terminal to show a file.. and then I press "/" and some words.. and when I press the enter key , it does not work... just add "ESCOM" behind what I input...
2010-07-08T01:58:00.000Z	thune3	glace	seems bizzare. unless you have some keybindings in a ~/.less file, I can't think of anything.
2010-07-08T02:16:00.000Z	glace	thune3	thanks a lot.. When I do the same thing under tty1 , it just work normally ... >_< I really don't know the reason...
