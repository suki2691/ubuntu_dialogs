2011-04-29T21:07:00.000Z	Janusman		Just upgraded from 10.10 to 11.04 (I'm on WUBI) however, uname -r says I'm still using an older kernel... how do I use the new one?
2011-04-29T21:07:00.000Z	Janusman		(also, on boot time the boot menu didn't show the new kernel)
2011-04-29T21:07:00.000Z	larstorben	Janusman	reinstall it.
2011-04-29T21:07:00.000Z	Janusman	larstorben	you mean, instead of upgrading I should reinstall everything? =)
