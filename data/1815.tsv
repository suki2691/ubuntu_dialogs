2012-07-27T18:54:00.000Z	indigoferal	animus123	i have the same problem with nvidia installed / not installed - am not sure so would also be happy to know what the solution is :-)
2012-07-27T18:57:00.000Z	indigoferal	animus123	nope, that was / is a minor problem in a the dark shadow or a major fatal error problem
2012-07-27T19:05:00.000Z	indigoferal	animus123	interesting - thats my take too - the problem emanates from /home but xorg is confused and crashes the system - so it may not be an xorg problem but is certainly a problem they get affected by - but they have no solution - which actually is now seeming far more simpler than the xorg reconfigure thingys
