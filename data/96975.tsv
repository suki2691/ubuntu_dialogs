2008-03-19T22:07:00.000Z	Conexio1		Hey guys, I was wondering, how do you change the effect that is used when an application closes? I've seen interesting fire or color effects, but I can't find anything like that in the CompizConfig settings manager

2008-03-19T22:10:00.000Z	danand	Conexio1	- i'm no expert on compiz, but open ccsm, click on preferences then look under the plugin list tab... hopefully that will help you out some
