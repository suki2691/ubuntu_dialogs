2010-05-12T19:58:00.000Z	klask		Hello everybody, I've got a questions, Hope I do it right... I've got an ubunut-server system and accidently executed "rm *" while my working directory was / (i intended to delete some logfiles...). It didnt delete that much since rm does not delete directories by default, but since then, it seems that my root user has no rights at all. I can see that for example /bin/ls is there but if i want to execute it, it says"file not found".
2010-05-12T19:58:00.000Z	klask		to restore that?
2010-05-12T20:00:00.000Z	klask		yes it is
2010-05-12T20:00:00.000Z	soundray	klask	is that literally what it says? Or does it say "command not found"?
