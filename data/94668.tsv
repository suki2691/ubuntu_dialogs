2008-05-08T09:21:00.000Z	Explo		Can someone help me? I need to figure out how to execute a file from a cron job (the file is /home/<myname>/scripts/backup, and i usually execute it with ./backup), but it won't let me do that from cron. ( I seem to have to be able to do a ./home/myname/scripts/backup, but it won't do that.) :(
