2012-08-27T06:40:00.000Z	whereami		I just did a dist-upgrade from oneiric to precise. While it was installing, gnome-shell quit working. After it rebooted, lightdm starts in a bad mode, and keyboard and mouse don't work. What should I do?
2012-08-27T06:40:00.000Z	whereami		by "gnome-shell quit working" i mean it exited, but the upgrade continued without a WM.

2012-08-27T06:42:00.000Z	whereami	Gaming4JC	well, I can't even get to console, since the keyboard isn't working.
