2007-09-08T08:30:00.000Z	fuoco		for some reason my firefox on linux is really heavy, whereas in windows and in mac osx it is really fast - is there some problem with my settings ?
2007-09-08T08:30:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	fuoco	do you have a bittorrent software running at the same time?
2007-09-08T08:31:00.000Z	fuoco	howlingmadhowie	occasionally yes, but not all the time, and firefox seems heavy all the time
2007-09-08T08:32:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	fuoco	then i don't know. let me think. maybe something will occur to me
