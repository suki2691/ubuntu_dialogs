2011-10-22T22:38:00.000Z	_rob_	escott	I just want my nephew to learn some things on his own without bugging me all the time

2011-10-22T22:43:00.000Z	_rob_	escott	 yeah that's the thing I'm worried about. He loves reading but if it's too technical he wont read it. He asked to borrow my c++ school book one time and didn't make it past the first chapter. lol
