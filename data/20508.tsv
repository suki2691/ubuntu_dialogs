2011-08-10T14:42:00.000Z	WaltherFI	IdleOne	i do know how to fix that in old grub, but haven't been messing 'round that either in the newer... So, is it possible to default to windows (again, my dad's computer)
2011-08-10T14:48:00.000Z	IdleOne	WaltherFI	/etc/default/grub
2011-08-10T15:26:00.000Z	WaltherFI	IdleOne	huh, weird inconsistency
