2012-03-25T21:10:00.000Z	didja		what is the most "human" sounding text-to-speech program available? i want to cook and hear something read a research paper aloud to me (otherwise cooking feels like a waste of time)
2012-03-25T21:10:00.000Z	didja		i have festival on my computer and possibly some others, but if i have to focus very hard to figure out what the text-to-speech program meant, it's not worth it
