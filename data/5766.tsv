2012-02-09T03:05:00.000Z	SHOVELL	T_H_X	i am sorry but i have looked and searched for the things you have mentioned and as far as i could see in the first 4 google pages(i did read the ones that were remotely close) there was nothing to indicate how to run two terminal windows and pass commands to each
2012-02-09T03:40:00.000Z	T_H_X	SHOVELL	you could also use a pipe
2012-02-09T03:41:00.000Z	SHOVELL	T_H_X	i forgot abpot the pipe it is this "|" correct?
