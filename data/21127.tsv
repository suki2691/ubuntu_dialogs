2011-01-08T15:45:00.000Z	Okitain	brianmunk	how about asking devs?
2011-01-08T15:45:00.000Z	Okitain	brianmunk	Or compiling yourself?
2011-01-08T15:47:00.000Z	brianmunk	Okitain	I was thinking like VLC player if I were to compile myself, and wanted to change one option but I would like the rest to be 'default' 10.10
