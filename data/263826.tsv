2004-10-10T09:02:00.000Z	vasi		has anybody had any problems with the hfsplus fs?
2004-10-10T09:02:00.000Z	vasi		it seems to be convinced atm that i have a FS mounted read-only, but mount says it's read-write
2004-10-10T09:03:00.000Z	tseng	vasi	yeah i read something like that on gnomeplanet today
2004-10-10T09:56:00.000Z	vasi	tseng	the hfsplus problem i saw was fixed by doing hpmount/hpumount for some reason...
