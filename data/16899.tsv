2011-03-15T17:39:00.000Z	Grexeo	keyzs	thanks - just to clarify, I am reinstalling Ubuntu on a new drive, but still have my old drive connected, which set up has detected. I am now being asked: "Install the GRUB bootloader to the Master Boot Record (MBR)?", but I will be disconnecting the old drive after installation. Should I choose "no"?
