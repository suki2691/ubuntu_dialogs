2005-03-31T10:52:00.000Z	moder_		hello. I'm trying to run apt-get update but it fails to fetch some of the packages. Should I change the archive address to something else than http://fi.archive.ubuntu.com? I'm running Hoary :)

2005-03-31T10:53:00.000Z	moder_	LinuxJones	ok, I'll try that then :p
2005-03-31T11:03:00.000Z	moder_	LinuxJones	I'm having problems with installing VLC too
