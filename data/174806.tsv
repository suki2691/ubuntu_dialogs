2009-03-11T00:27:00.000Z	Win32		Hello, does anyone here use a 64-bit based OS and GRUB on the same machine?
2009-03-11T00:28:00.000Z	Win32		I need to know if it would be possible to have GRUB boot up a 64-bit version of Ubuntu 8.10 and XP (x86 based) all on the same machine
2009-03-11T00:29:00.000Z	Win32		I don't know if GRUB can handle booting up x86 and x64 OS'es on the same machine
2009-03-11T00:30:00.000Z	LMJ	Win32	: it works for sure, makes no difference for Grub
