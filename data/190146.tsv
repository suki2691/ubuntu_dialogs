2006-04-25T10:12:00.000Z	Warbo	monsterb	I have 250GB. I have 20GB /, 150GB /home/chris/Files and the rest to play with different OSs
2006-04-25T10:12:00.000Z	monsterb	Warbo	Thanks
2006-04-25T10:13:00.000Z	Warbo	monsterb	I like to keep my prefs and configs seperate from my files, hence the Files folder (so I can use multiple OSs with the same files)
