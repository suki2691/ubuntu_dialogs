2009-12-10T14:54:00.000Z	Daemonis		Okay another question... are there any programs out there that let you create your own Ubuntu themes?
2009-12-10T14:56:00.000Z	Daemonis		Ah, okay. Thanks ;)
2009-12-10T14:57:00.000Z	Daemonis		Would you be able to use something like GIMP to do it too?
2009-12-10T14:57:00.000Z	DASPRiD	Daemonis	but then, with gimp you can only create pixel-icons, not vector-icons
