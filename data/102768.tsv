2008-06-11T19:16:00.000Z	Stephmw		howdy, I'm trying to upgrade from gutsy to hardy without using a network connection - but every time I tell the upgrader not to, it keeps failing the upgrade because it couldn't fetch packages from the net... what am I missing?

2008-06-11T19:17:00.000Z	Stephmw	KOJV	I'm using the alternate CD that contains a dist upgrader
2008-06-11T19:17:00.000Z	Stephmw	KOJV	my understanding is that it should contain all the required packages already
