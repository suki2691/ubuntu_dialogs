2007-09-08T13:33:00.000Z	Arcad3z		how can i restart some services using init and not ruin my uptime ?
2007-09-08T13:33:00.000Z	SeveredCross	Arcad3z	sudo /etc/init.d/service-name restart
2007-09-08T13:34:00.000Z	SeveredCross	Arcad3z	Um...init 0 kills everything.
2007-09-08T13:35:00.000Z	SeveredCross	Arcad3z	Honestly, that's a STUPID way to do it.
