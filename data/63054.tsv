2009-03-23T01:14:00.000Z	cipherZen	Cheery	I have, fast as hell, just as unstable
2009-03-23T01:15:00.000Z	Cheery		anyone proposed ubuntu to move their interest from firefox to chromium?
2009-03-23T01:15:00.000Z	Cheery	cipherZen	yeah, and it's damn incredible, firefox can never provide that same experience
