2009-10-18T21:35:00.000Z	krooler	dhalsimm	it's ok to remove ubuntu-desktop
2009-10-18T21:36:00.000Z	dhalsimm	krooler	really? isn't all gnome stuff in that package?
2009-10-18T21:40:00.000Z	dhalsimm	krooler	IdleOne: Ok I removed ubuntu-desktop and evince but if I try to remove libpoppler, it wants to remove lots of packages including GIMP
