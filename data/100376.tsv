2008-02-15T23:57:00.000Z	tknudsen		greetings, How do I build a package from source with all the 'configure' params that I want, as I would with FreeBSD?
2008-02-15T23:58:00.000Z	MasterShrak	tknudsen	first you need to install build essential: sudo apt-get install build-essential
2008-02-15T23:58:00.000Z	MasterShrak	tknudsen	then just build it like normal
2008-02-16T00:29:00.000Z	MasterShrak	tknudsen	ubuntu is not really the distro to use if you like to compile alot of stuff from source, slackware or gentoo would probably be better choices
