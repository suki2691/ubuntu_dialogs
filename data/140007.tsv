2007-06-22T16:43:00.000Z	tommus		I need to remove Tranmission from my ubuntu system, but I've been looking for some time now and I cant find a way to remove it since its not in synaptic nor can I use the sudo make uninstall, so, how do i remove tar.gz-installed items?

2007-06-22T16:44:00.000Z	tommus	wols_	can i assume all those files are in the one same direcotyr?
