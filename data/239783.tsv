2006-08-12T08:27:00.000Z	smacky_wolf		Quick question. As an idiot, I set up mySQL on my machine. I then changed the acces to @*myname* instead of @localhost. Now I can't login. parsing mysql --user=smackywolf@chakat does nothing... anyone got any ideas?
2006-08-12T08:27:00.000Z	kennethlove	smacky_wolf	remove mysql and reinstall?
2006-08-12T08:28:00.000Z	kennethlove	smacky_wolf	use synaptic and do a 'force remove'. that'll delete the configs too
