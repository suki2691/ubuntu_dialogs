2008-09-15T02:23:00.000Z	x-flow		how do I know who is the packager of a certain application?
2008-09-15T02:24:00.000Z	Slart	x-flow	check in synaptic, it's in the info for the package
2008-09-15T02:24:00.000Z	Slart	x-flow	you can probably get the info using apt-cache too but I don't know the exact command
