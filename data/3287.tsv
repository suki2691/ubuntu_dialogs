2012-05-03T23:29:00.000Z	Sicp		I'm trying to install Ubuntu on my iMac and this is the third attempt, I keep getting "Error loading operating system" when I boot back up
2012-05-03T23:29:00.000Z	Sicp		the first 2 attempts had the Mac OS alongside Ubuntu
2012-05-03T23:29:00.000Z	Sicp		this time around it's only Ubuntu and it just finished installing, I reboot and I get that error again
