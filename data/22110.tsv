2012-06-15T00:42:00.000Z	ska		I'm installing another version of ubuntu on a AMD LLANO A6 system for HTPC. I want to install a lightweight version of Ubuntu that is mostly compatible. What version should I run, ?
2012-06-15T00:43:00.000Z	ska		Can I run 32-bit system? Should I? 32 would run faster i bet.
2012-06-15T00:44:00.000Z	ska		I can access all my memory by using a special PAE kernel in 32bit right?
