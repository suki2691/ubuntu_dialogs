2010-01-08T07:51:00.000Z	Cubey		I had two actually. the latest was if anyone knows how to disable the drum sound in 9.10 at the login screen. I have checked everything... sound, login screen...
2010-01-08T07:52:00.000Z	zkoo	Cubey	drum sound?  is that kde iirc?
2010-01-08T07:52:00.000Z	Cubey	zkoo	No, it's the ubuntu login screen. (I have gnome & XFCE installed)
2010-01-08T07:53:00.000Z	Cubey	zkoo	it does it when the login screen comes up. doesn't seem to be associated with gnome, xfce, or any other window manager
