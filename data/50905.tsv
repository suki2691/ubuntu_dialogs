2009-08-07T06:01:00.000Z	Loup		I foolishly misspelled my username on a new installation.  When I go to alter it as admin with the manage users and groups tool, username is grayed out and unalterable.  How do I fix this?

2009-08-07T06:02:00.000Z	Loup	Flannel	I created another admin account to try and alter it from there but it was still grayed.  But you say I can do it from recovery?
2009-08-07T06:03:00.000Z	Flannel	Loup	you can, yeah.  usermod and stuff.
