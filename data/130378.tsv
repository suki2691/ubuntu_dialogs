2007-06-22T09:36:00.000Z	natbet	mezziah	just out of curiousity, how do you use the purge command (couldn't get rid of vmware-player a few weeks ago, was recommended to use purge instead of remove)
2007-06-22T09:37:00.000Z	mezziah	natbet	it would be 'apt-get remove <app> --purge'
2007-06-22T09:37:00.000Z	natbet	mezziah	thanks
