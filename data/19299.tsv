2012-10-02T16:55:00.000Z	et		hi. I'm looking to install ubuntu on unused disk space of a windows computer without a cd drive. If i read http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/install-ubuntu-with-windows correctly, the installer does not let me pick the unallocated space, it only lets me choose between drives. is this intended?
