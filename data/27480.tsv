2010-10-25T16:06:00.000Z	Diamondcite	zagabar	This probably isn't proper.. but maybe for eth1 you can configure it to share the intertnet with automatic dhcp? (I don't know if all the needed packages are there)
2010-10-25T16:10:00.000Z	zagabar	Diamondcite	SpaceGhostC2C I'll try doing it with dnsmasq then. But for clarity, here is what I am trying to achieve and how: http://pastebin.com/bSUREW3u
