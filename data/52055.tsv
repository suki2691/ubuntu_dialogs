2009-07-28T02:13:00.000Z	koltroll		I'd like a text editor (for coding) where I can create projects, and if I like add ftp-information for each project so that i can work directly against the ftp, or work local and simply upload the content. Any tip on this ?

2009-07-28T02:15:00.000Z	koltroll	th0r	will check that out as well. thank you
