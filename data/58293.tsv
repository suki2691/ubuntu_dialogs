2009-05-29T19:35:00.000Z	Dunge		I just checked /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libc.conf and it already contain /usr/local/lib but it don't seems to work
2009-05-29T19:37:00.000Z	Dunge	scampbell	: sorry, my mistake, examples compile and install fine. The problem happens on execution
2009-05-29T19:38:00.000Z	scampbell	Dunge	so when it runs it cannot find the library?
