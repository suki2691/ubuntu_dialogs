2007-02-20T13:01:00.000Z	Flannel	zooted_	logical volume UUIDs, LVM abstracts away physical disks
2007-02-20T13:05:00.000Z	zooted_	Flannel	are you using LVM for your root install?  If so could you please check "/sbin/dumpe2fs /dev/volgroup/logvol | grep UUID" against the output of lvdisplay and compare it to the values in /etc/fstab, and /boot/grub/menu.lst?
