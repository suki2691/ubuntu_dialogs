2007-03-28T08:04:00.000Z	wolfeon	Jeeves_Moss	check the cable? :)
2007-03-28T08:05:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	wolfeon	 it's connected, it's just not pulling an address.  I've checked the cable, it works under M$ (that I'm running right now).  And the WiFi card has problems pulling an address as well
2007-03-28T08:07:00.000Z	Jeeves_Moss	wolfeon	 any ideas?
