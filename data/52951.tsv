2009-08-31T07:08:00.000Z	Andorin		aMSN froze on me. I'm trying to kill it and having zero luck. I don't see a name for it in the process list. How do I kill this program?
2009-08-31T07:09:00.000Z	Andorin		I know there's a terminal command for displaying a list of running processes, but it has never done a THING for me.  I have absolutely no idea how to use it.
2009-08-31T07:09:00.000Z	lstarnes	Andorin	was it ps aux?
2009-08-31T07:09:00.000Z	Andorin	lstarnes	Actually, it's just ps.
