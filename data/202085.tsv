2010-04-24T07:09:00.000Z	someDude		i am running lucid rc right now, though i dont think this issue is exclusive to that. somehow as the result of an update my grub menu had all kernel choices removed from it - i.e. only memtest remains
2010-04-24T07:09:00.000Z	someDude		i am running from a liveusb right now. i dont need to reinstall grub2, i just need it to check for installed kernels again, anyone know how to make it do that
