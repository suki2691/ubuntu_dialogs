2006-06-26T05:51:00.000Z	Migit03		Anyone know if a AMD64 version of wine exists for Ubuntu (DD)? I've looked all over and I've turned up no working (i.e. works for a noob like me) solutions.

2006-06-26T05:52:00.000Z	Migit03	Raito	It won't even let  me get the package for wine though (using synaptic)
2006-06-26T05:53:00.000Z	Raito	Migit03	I would recommend just using the 32bit version of ubuntu, it is pretty much the same >_>
