2009-01-07T01:09:00.000Z	ichbinesderelch	klikklak	try restarting X
2009-01-07T01:09:00.000Z	klikklak	ichbinesderelch	ok, I'll do that (later) thanks.  it was kind of weird that it just suddenly started doing that.
2009-01-07T01:10:00.000Z	ichbinesderelch	klikklak	had same problem on my own, never figured out why, but restarting X always solved that
