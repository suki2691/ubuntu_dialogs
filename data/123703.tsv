2010-06-17T18:35:00.000Z	unop	mick_laptop	ha ha, that's a gross over simplification.  it actually means, place the vm in the same network segment.
2010-06-17T18:36:00.000Z	mick_laptop	unop	i figured a simple answer for a simple person :P
2010-06-17T18:37:00.000Z	unop	mick_laptop	well, i'd argue it's also a wrong answer -- a vm in other modes can still get an address from a DHCP server, nothing special about "bridged mode" in that respect.
