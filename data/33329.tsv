2011-08-20T05:00:00.000Z	marriedman624		I need some help upgrading firefox from 5.0.1 to 6.0 on ubuntu 9.10
2011-08-20T05:01:00.000Z	marriedman624		I downloading the tar.gz but not sure what to do now...........or should I wait until the repository gets updated?
2011-08-20T05:03:00.000Z	marriedman624		yeah i know 9.10 isn't supported anymore, but it took me forever to get my wifi working so I don't want to lose that
2011-08-20T05:03:00.000Z	rumpe1	marriedman624	why not try a newer ubuntu as live-medium to check, if your wifi now works out-of-the-box?
