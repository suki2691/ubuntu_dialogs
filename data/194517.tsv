2006-09-18T05:17:00.000Z	encode		hello people - ive done something really dumb, need to reboot to single user mode, but i never set a root password - how is that going to work?
2006-09-18T05:17:00.000Z	schmirgo	encode	set a root PW with "sudo passwd"
2006-09-18T05:18:00.000Z	schmirgo	encode	thats what i would do but there might be an other solution
2006-09-18T05:18:00.000Z	encode	schmirgo	the really dumb thing i did was to screw up sudo
