2007-03-25T14:08:00.000Z	rickyfingers_	Mugwump09	are you installing from the 64 bit cd?
2007-03-25T14:10:00.000Z	rickyfingers_	Mugwump09	but you can boot off other cd's?
2007-03-25T14:11:00.000Z	rickyfingers_	Mugwump09	You've got boot sequence right in the bios? Check that, and you may want to flash the bios as well.
