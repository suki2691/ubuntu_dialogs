Ive appended /usr/local/apache2/bin to PATH in the /etc/bash.bashrc file     now a regular use can run a program in there, however because it needs to be run with root... when i sudo apachectl start, it tells me that the command is not found... ive cheked by su - that PATH in root does have the added directory.     any ideas on how to make the PATH addition globally (as in working globally? )
2009-01-24T07:39:00.000Z	iajrz	PC_Nerd1	you have to put it in sbin
