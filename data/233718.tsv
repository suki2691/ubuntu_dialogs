2005-06-27T14:53:00.000Z	r2d4		Hi! Just installed Ubuntu to my hard disk. The sound is not working. Funny thing is it worked from the Live CD. I mucked around a bit haplessly. I don't know much of how the sound internals work. I did read the unofficial FAQ and did what it said. Didn't help. The sound is playing (can see the oscillations in media players) but won't sound out. Volume is fine. Sound works from Windows partition.
