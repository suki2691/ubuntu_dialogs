2010-08-06T15:01:00.000Z	nicark	jhattara	or if you feel really lazy about it and it's sensible data then use dropbox
2010-08-06T15:01:00.000Z	nicark	jhattara	I meant to say not sensible data
2010-08-06T15:02:00.000Z	jhattara	nicark	i'd need a software that can connect to various servers that i have either sftp, ftp or both connections available and synchronize the remote files with local files
