2008-11-23T20:33:00.000Z	diegorodriguezv		Hello.I have a weird problem. I installed a new hard drive. Connected it at IDE-0. The other drive at IDE-1 has 2 NTFS partitions for windows. When I boot 8.04 LiveCD I can see both /dev/sda and /dev/sdb with the partition editor. I Installed Ubuntu to the first hard drive but when I boot it doesn't seem to recognize /dev/sdb (I can't see it with partition editor). How can I diagnose this?
