2005-05-13T14:25:00.000Z	TQuid		How do I get going with character composition in X?
2005-05-13T14:27:00.000Z	anto9us	TQuid	what do you mean by character composition?
2005-05-13T14:29:00.000Z	TQuid	anto9us	 I just had the brainwave of using Google Linux.  At any rate, I mean mapping a key to the old Compose key, so I can generate extended Roman letters.
