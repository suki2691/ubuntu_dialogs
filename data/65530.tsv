2009-06-16T05:52:00.000Z	binskipy2u		or is that not a big deal in linux having tooo many codecs
2009-06-16T05:53:00.000Z	stealth-	binskipy2u	shouldnt cause any issues, the programs will use what they want to
2009-06-16T05:55:00.000Z	stealth-	binskipy2u	as a general rule, apt-get will take care of stuff if there is conflicts, so it either wont allow you to install the new package or will remove the conflicting one
