2007-08-22T05:32:00.000Z	Stoffer		can someone tell me why k9copy created a video_ts folder too big for k3b to burn onto a single layer disk?
2007-08-22T05:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Stoffer	Did you copy a dual layer DVD?
2007-08-22T05:33:00.000Z	Stoffer	Jordan_U	yeah, but I reauthored and shrank it with k9copy into a single layer size.  However, k9copy failed its burn, and the video_ts folder it created was 100mb too big for k3b for some reason...
2007-08-22T05:34:00.000Z	Stoffer	Jordan_U	I assume all I need are the 5 VOB files, but they add up to 4.5GB so K3b won't put it on a single layer disk
