2011-09-15T13:16:00.000Z	ikonia	blue_eyed_lady	is it hard locking (hit numlock on your keyboard, see if the lot goes on/off)
2011-09-15T13:17:00.000Z	ikonia	blue_eyed_lady	in those situations it is normally a hardware issue
2011-09-15T13:19:00.000Z	ikonia	blue_eyed_lady	that doesn't mean it's not a hardware issue, or a hardware incompatability with ubuntu
