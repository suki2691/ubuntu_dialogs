2008-03-24T21:24:00.000Z	TitoN		sup i just wonder if there is a way to setup so my mic input on my lap can send out sound?
2008-03-24T21:24:00.000Z	TitoN		so i can run 4 speakers
2008-03-24T21:24:00.000Z	Creeture	TitoN	the input will not work as output.
2008-03-24T21:26:00.000Z	Creeture	TitoN	Not in this case. The circuitry for input and output is completely the opposite.
