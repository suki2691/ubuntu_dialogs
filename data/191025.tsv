2006-04-15T12:24:00.000Z	Skiria		is there a wireless network detector on the live CD?? I'm wanting to install ubuntu, but want to make sure i can connect to the net on it first and couldnt find any network detector while running the live CD, I've entered my WEP key and SSID and everything, but it wont connect out to the internet.  Any suggestions?
