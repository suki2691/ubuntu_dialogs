2007-02-27T09:18:00.000Z	Kaso	black_13	i got real audio streams working by installing realplayer, then removing the totem real-plugins from firefox's plugins directory
2007-02-27T09:18:00.000Z	black_13	Kaso	what is the package that installs real audio?
2007-02-27T09:20:00.000Z	Kaso	black_13	im not sure there is a package, i grabbed it off the real homepage manually
