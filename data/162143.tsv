2007-10-18T06:19:00.000Z	tsukasa		okay so i have a bunch of programs launching at startup... and gnome never remembers the window positions... is there anything i can do about it?
2007-10-18T06:20:00.000Z	CITguy	tsukasa	do you want those programs launched?
2007-10-18T06:20:00.000Z	tsukasa	CITguy	yes, but i want them in the same window positions as when i either logoff or when i set them
2007-10-18T06:20:00.000Z	tsukasa	CITguy	preferably to the extent that minimized programs stay minimized too
