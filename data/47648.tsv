2010-05-04T15:59:00.000Z	rayne		Just a quick question to confirm something. I just got a notification saying Ubuntu 10.4 is available. I am running Xubuntu 9.4 on this computer. If I install the Ubuntu 10.4 will I have Gnome installed by default?

2010-05-04T16:00:00.000Z	theadmin	rayne	Update manager won't change the desktop environment :P It will use XFCE
2010-05-04T16:02:00.000Z	theadmin	rayne	theadmin is not same as "Admin" :D
