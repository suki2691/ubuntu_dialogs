2008-04-29T07:58:00.000Z	Shadow_X	brrybnds	strange. because my install works fine one time, then if something drops it, it acts up. how can you refresh the DNS entries without using the stupid GNOME thing?
2008-04-29T08:02:00.000Z	brrybnds	Shadow_X	that's beyond my abilities, I'm newish to ubuntu - just able to confirm that I had no issues with it, was straight forward (unlike most networking stuff I seem to come across)
2008-04-29T08:03:00.000Z	Shadow_X	brrybnds	ah its cool. i was just wondering
