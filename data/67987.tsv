2009-08-30T10:03:00.000Z	timbojimbo_		my ethernet card is an intel corp 82801db pro/100. My main problem is it is not sending or receiving from the cable modem. i recently tried modprobe e100 then i restarted ~init.d/networking. worked the first time but after the computer went into hibernation the connection dropped and i tried again with no luck. i then tried ifup eth0 and it gave me this message: Ignoring unknown interface eth0=eth0. I have been scowering the web for any help to no avail.
