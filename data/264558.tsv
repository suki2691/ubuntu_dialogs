2004-11-24T10:51:00.000Z	claus		i have a question about configuring my printer, I have a epson stylus c82. this printer isnt named in the printer setup wizard. i tried new-stylus-color-series, but printing a test site resulted in an empty page. what can i do?
2004-11-24T10:53:00.000Z	claus		to be honest, it had to shut off the printer to stop producing more empty pages.
2004-11-24T10:53:00.000Z	Treenaks	claus	there is a solution
2004-11-24T10:55:00.000Z	Treenaks	claus	install cupsys-driver-gimpprint-data and the right printer will appear in the list
