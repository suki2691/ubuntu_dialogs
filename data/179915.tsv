2008-04-18T03:13:00.000Z	fyreofchaos13		Can somebody help me? I've randomly lost access to my programs.
2008-04-18T03:14:00.000Z	fyreofchaos13		I can't open the majority of my programs (Such as Mozilla, or even the pictures on my desktop).
2008-04-18T03:14:00.000Z	fyreofchaos13		And it just happened, without anything being done to cause it.
2008-04-18T03:15:00.000Z	jrib	fyreofchaos13	what *does* happen?
