2006-10-04T06:57:00.000Z	b-rad		Has anyone had an issue with Kubuntu Edgy and the resolution being set to something your monitor cannot deal with?  It starts to boot up, but then the resolution changes to something the monitor can't display and I'm stuck...  anyone got any ideas on what I could do?  I attempted to install the Nvidia drivers, but no such luck.
