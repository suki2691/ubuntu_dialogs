2007-04-20T05:18:00.000Z	TaJMoX		Has anyone done a dist-upgrade?   Is that reccommended?
2007-04-20T05:20:00.000Z	TaJMoX		So many problems with dist upgrading - best way is to install from start i guess...
2007-04-20T05:20:00.000Z	TaJMoX		Wastrel : my question wasnt on how to upgrade - it was more like asking if I should because everyone is having problems upgrading
2007-04-20T05:21:00.000Z	wastrel	TaJMoX	 wait a week, the major problems will have been found by then probably
