2007-08-20T07:19:00.000Z	eggzeck		Why would Ubuntu read an ATI Radeon 9250 as a 9200?
2007-08-20T07:19:00.000Z	Pici	eggzeck	Because its part of the 9200 series.
2007-08-20T07:19:00.000Z	Pici	eggzeck	It doesnt really matter though, as its going to use the same driver either way.
2007-08-20T07:20:00.000Z	eggzeck	Pici	Yes, you're right about the driver. But my other machines read it literally. Doesn't matter, just checking.
