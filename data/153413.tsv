2007-04-21T10:00:00.000Z	eternalswd		I'm having problems with feisty and my ati x300 card.  Initially it didn't load, so I set the driver to vesa and it loaded up.  I then tried setting it back to radeon which is what I had it as for edgy and restarted X and it restarted fine.  In the middle of watching a video, X died and I had to hard reboot.  Now it won't load even with vesa as a driver.  I booted up using edgy's kernel, and it worked, though X dies after a time on it now,
