2008-02-26T03:22:00.000Z	trippss		any ideas on why my notification area doesn't show many icons that are supposed to be there? azureus and wine apps show but no xchat, tomboy notes and others
2008-02-26T03:24:00.000Z	ere4si	trippss	xchat has an option to show in the tray
2008-02-26T03:25:00.000Z	trippss	ere4si	yes and it's enabled. all that stuff was there a couple of weeks ago but not any more
2008-02-26T03:25:00.000Z	ere4si	trippss	have you done a recent update?
