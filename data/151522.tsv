2007-01-10T17:51:00.000Z	Enverex		What happened to the different kernels? (k7, 686, etc) Should everyone just use the generic one now? If so what happened to the optimisations?
2007-01-10T17:52:00.000Z	xopher-	Enverex	theyre all in the one kernel now
2007-01-10T17:52:00.000Z	Enverex	xopher-	... how can you have multiple machine optimisations in the same kernel? Or does it check when you install it?
2007-01-10T17:52:00.000Z	xopher-	Enverex	dont ask me, that just what Ive been told :)
