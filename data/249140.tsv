2006-06-03T06:30:00.000Z	AlexC		Hey,
2006-06-03T06:31:00.000Z	AlexC		Is there any other FTP client apart from gFTP - because it really does suck when it comes to navigating many different folders due to no tree-view
2006-06-03T06:33:00.000Z	AlexC		Is there any other good FTP client that has tree view ?
2006-06-03T06:34:00.000Z	pussfeller	AlexC	there is kbear which is sometimes confusing, but has the tree view you want
