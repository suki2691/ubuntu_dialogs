2006-03-01T17:26:00.000Z	LjL	B_166-ER-X	but make sure that .deb is not already in the repositories first
2006-03-01T17:27:00.000Z	LjL	B_166-ER-X	feel free to ignore me. i assume that, as you don't know how to do something as basic as installing a .deb, you might not really know about repositories either. but then you're surely way smarter than i
