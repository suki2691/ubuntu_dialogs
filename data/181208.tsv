2007-03-24T09:53:00.000Z	_daedalus		I made some changes to xorg.conf last night.  I had a backup.  I reverted back to the backup later, but something must have gone wrong becuase now I can't start X.
2007-03-24T09:53:00.000Z	_daedalus		Is there a place I can find the default xorg.conf for Dapper?
2007-03-24T09:53:00.000Z	bruenig	_daedalus	just sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-03-24T09:54:00.000Z	_daedalus	bruenig	thanks, I will try that
