2007-12-08T10:17:00.000Z	AprilHare		i installed a third party application under ubuntu. it does not particularly know anything specific about ubuntu (it installs itself with a shell script) and the only way to run it is via shell script. is there any way to add it to the applications menu, or as a shortcut on the desktop?
