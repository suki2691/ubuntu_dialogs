2007-07-18T15:09:00.000Z	zweiundzwei		hello, i have a very persistent problem with my screen resolution, would anyone be willing to help me out there?
2007-07-18T15:10:00.000Z	zweiundzwei		I have a nvidia geforce 6100 video card and the resolution won't go over 1024x786, even after editing xorg.conf or installing the official nvidia driver. any ideas?

2007-07-18T15:12:00.000Z	zweiundzwei	vox754	or ubuntu, for not supplying me with a working driver either? ;)
