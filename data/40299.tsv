2010-03-02T03:37:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Maletor	software raid; "fake raid" combines the CPU load of software raid with the adaptor-lockin of hardware raid; worst of both!
2010-03-02T03:40:00.000Z	Maletor	zcat[1]	can you elaborate on NEVER just a bit?
2010-03-02T03:42:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Maletor	"NEVER" -- fake raid is just software raid with proprietary drivers and tied to a particular controller. There are no advantages, only disadvantages
