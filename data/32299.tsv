2010-05-19T04:11:00.000Z	coolbtk		Hello. I have a custom built computer with a ATI Radeon 4870X2, and the integrated card is a Radeon 3300. On Ubuntu 9.10 x64, the 4870X2 worked perfectly. I did a clean install of 10.04 and now the 4870X2 won't work with my TV anymore. What's worse is that while the integrated card works, Ubuntu seems to think that it is an NVidia card. Anyone have any thoughts?
