2005-08-07T07:35:00.000Z	FatManWalking		I want to use gtkpod.  I need to load libid3tag.  I downloaded libid3tag0_0.15.1b-7_i386.deb,  but now I don't know how to install it.  Help.
2005-08-07T07:37:00.000Z	FatManWalking		I have synaptic.
2005-08-07T07:37:00.000Z	bimberi	FatManWalking	gtkpod is available in the ubuntu repositories - or are you installing a later version?
2005-08-07T07:42:00.000Z	bimberi	FatManWalking	i can't see gtkpod-aac in my synaptic.  Do you have extra repositories?
