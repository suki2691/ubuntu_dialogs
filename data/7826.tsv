2011-11-12T04:09:00.000Z	symb0l__		I really dig unity, but I'm wondering if there is a way to disable the top bar and have the side panel extend to the top of the screen.  anyone done this?
2011-11-12T04:09:00.000Z	symb0l__		historically I would just remove the gnome-panel executable

2011-11-12T04:11:00.000Z	symb0l__	jayar	yes I like docky also.  I used docky/gnome do for a long time, but I really want to give unity a chance.
