2012-03-25T22:59:00.000Z	Oscailt	Roasted	Why would you be looking to change it?
2012-03-25T23:00:00.000Z	Roasted	Oscailt	because my setup is kind of unique... 4gb flash drive for root, and 2x500gb raid mounted @ /media/NAS for data for the file server. I want to route it o /media/NAS/public
2012-03-25T23:00:00.000Z	Roasted	Oscailt	that way I can host data versus the flash drive I'm bottlenecked at like 300 meg since that's all I have free.
