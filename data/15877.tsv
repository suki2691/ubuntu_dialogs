2012-11-30T19:46:00.000Z	spm-Draget		The 32bit Version of Ubuntu 12.04 is recommended. Any rough guess how much more instability I should expect with ubuntu 12.04 64bit? Like, is this just 'a bit less well tested' or should I relly expect occasional problems?
2012-11-30T19:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	spm-Draget	its not about stability
2012-11-30T19:49:00.000Z	spm-Draget	ActionParsnip	I am aware of some propetarian drivers and 64bit issues etc. But as for stability, I should expect about the same experience as in 32bit? Okay, thanks.
2012-11-30T19:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	spm-Draget	yes both are equally stable. proprietary drivers are also 64bit
