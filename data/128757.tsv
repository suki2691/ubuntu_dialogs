2007-08-18T06:48:00.000Z	Taffy-nay		Azureus has broken on me, I think it's because I moved a file that was being shared (and subsequently edited). Terminal gives DEBUG::Sat Aug 18 13:27:47 BST 2007  Data Missing /home/nathan/Desktop/cybotron. It also has a host of other information in the error. Does anyone know a way I can sort this out?

2007-08-18T06:50:00.000Z	Taffy-nay	Jordan_U	Thats where it currently is
2007-08-18T06:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Taffy-nay	No, I mean move the directory as it will contain all the preferences for Azureus, moving it will reset those preferences ( and moving it back will restore them )
