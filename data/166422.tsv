2008-01-01T20:41:00.000Z	Radius		Hi there, is anyone willing to anser a quick question of mine?
2008-01-01T20:43:00.000Z	Radius		Right ok :D, well I have (somewhere) an Ubuntu live disc, and I always thought that this was a live-only disc, ie can't become a permanent installation, but can I install Ubuntu properly onto a hard drive with this CD, rather than having to download the ISO file? (sorry if that's confusing)
2008-01-01T20:44:00.000Z	wols	Radius	yes. it'S a live and a installer CD
