2009-09-27T14:16:00.000Z	wonderboy	HazeFaze	 thanks but it seems to be working only on laptop.. i don't have any battery here so there is no sense in "discharge time profile" etc..
2009-09-27T14:17:00.000Z	HazeFaze	wonderboy	maybe another tool is powertop
2009-09-27T14:19:00.000Z	wonderboy	HazeFaze	yeah i just tried it.. it said "No ACPI power usage estimate available"
