2007-04-01T08:58:00.000Z	SzaraHill		I mean, come on, they provided the card, there's got to be a way to apply the driver?  unless they're written in such intirely different ways that they're simply not applicable

2007-04-01T08:58:00.000Z	ikonia	SzaraHill	for interest sake you may want to check the ati site for general compatability info
