2009-04-25T19:58:00.000Z	ph8		hi all, strange question but i've just upgraded to jaunty and i need to know which kernel it's using, i.e. what should grub be booting to? I left my grub/menu.lst unaltered and now i think it's borking because it's trying to boot into an old kernel
2009-04-25T19:59:00.000Z	ph8		can anyone using jaunty give me a uname -a?
2009-04-25T19:59:00.000Z	roxan	ph8	uname -r
2009-04-25T19:59:00.000Z	roxan	ph8	its 2.6.28-11
