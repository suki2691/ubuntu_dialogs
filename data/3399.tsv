2012-08-10T06:37:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	esolyt	use the latest release 12.04
2012-08-10T06:38:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	esolyt	you are subject to the process of venting stuff in the repos to a update to be put there for use.
2012-08-10T06:39:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	esolyt	you can install what you want, but always be backed up if you are going to go out of the repos in case you brick the setup.
