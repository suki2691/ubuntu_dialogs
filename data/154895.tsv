2006-12-15T06:00:00.000Z	mOZ		i've never worked with linux before so i have no idea. If I install ubuntu on a USB stick, will I be able to install software and use them, or will it be as if i was inserting a live cd?
2006-12-15T06:02:00.000Z	mOZ		great thnx. it's exactly what i need. I need to develop a project for the university under linux, so having it on usb stick will be no problem moving my job from uni and back
