2010-03-10T07:25:00.000Z	DasEi	progesterone	sda is first hd, sdb 2.nd ;; sda1 is first partition on first hd and so on
2010-03-10T07:26:00.000Z	progesterone	DasEi	ZykoticK9 Why do they use 'sd' in stead of 'hdd' or something for harddisk? What does 'sda' stand for?
2010-03-10T07:27:00.000Z	DasEi	progesterone	these are just identifiers,  hd (0,0) is same then sda1
