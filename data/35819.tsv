2010-03-13T21:51:00.000Z	yekimoto	acicula	cool... so i've got a problem here... It's a books example, that works perfect in ubuntu x86 and doesn't in x64... I saw it under gdm and was wandered... read() systeam call doesn't work after lseek() system call...
2010-03-13T21:55:00.000Z	acicula	yekimoto	the behaviour of the calls should not differ significantly?
2010-03-13T21:58:00.000Z	yekimoto	acicula	sorry, I don't understand the question. What do you mean "not differ significantly"?
