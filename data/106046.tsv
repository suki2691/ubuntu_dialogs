2009-07-27T12:14:00.000Z	xshadowx		Anyway, yeah, does anyone know about the ms-sys program thing for linux? I need it to fix my mbr.
2009-07-27T12:15:00.000Z	Bodsda	xshadowx	dont know about ms-sys, and ive missed most of the convo but a 'fixmbr' command from a windows recovery console should fix your mbr
