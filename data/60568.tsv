2011-06-05T02:57:00.000Z	Undead_Tomato		Hey guys. I'm wanting to build an indie game and I want to include linux support so I've got a quesiton.
2011-06-05T02:57:00.000Z	Undead_Tomato		I want to develop an indie game for PC, Mac, and Linux. I can't decide if I should code it in Java or C++. I can't remember if C++ games run natively on linux or not. And Mac, I have no idea. I know that C++ is more optimized than java which is why I want to do C++, and I know linux can run C++ under wine but I don't want it under wine.
