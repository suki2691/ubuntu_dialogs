2006-09-17T06:39:00.000Z	Nihil85		hi! i have a strange problem: it's one week that i cannot start ubuntu (even in safe mode). It crashes at "mounting local file system", even if i start ubuntu with the live version.
2006-09-17T06:39:00.000Z	Nihil85		any clue?
2006-09-17T06:40:00.000Z	sethk	Nihil85	boot the live cd and try running fsck on the root file system
2006-09-17T06:49:00.000Z	Nihil85	sethk	the live cd doesn't work... it crashes also at "mounting root file system"
