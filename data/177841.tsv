2008-06-30T04:12:00.000Z	Dezine		I'm trying to get dual screens set up. I have an nvidia card, try setting it up via nvidia-settings and I can get them both to work but one of my screens keeps flickering on and off

2008-06-30T04:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dezine	ok.. cuz the other wont work
2008-06-30T04:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Dezine	Because xinerama doesnt work with compiz
