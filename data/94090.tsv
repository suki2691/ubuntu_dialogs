2010-05-08T21:36:00.000Z	atomati		I am trying to figure out why play/pause forward etc. buttons aren't responding for me when watching videos on sites. For example youtube, also other sites with video load but will not play video. I'm thinking its goto do with adobe. Can any one point me into the right direction please?
