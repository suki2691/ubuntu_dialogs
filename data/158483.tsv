2010-02-10T21:06:00.000Z	Slart	kreator	I read somewhere that it was implemented in kernel X.X.X.X... don't remember the numbers though
2010-02-10T21:08:00.000Z	Slart	kreator	this is the best hit I got from google http://communities.intel.com/message/68630;jsessionid=06E39E88DE5BD0BC1DB75B49FC25263D.node5COMS
2010-02-10T21:09:00.000Z	Slart	kreator	and since Karmic uses 2.6.31-19 it sounds like it should be working already.. not sure how to verify that though
