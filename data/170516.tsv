2007-07-08T07:20:00.000Z	tchmnkyz		hey there, looking for a way with ubuntu that i can authenticate (this is the desktop btw) against a 2000/2003/samba PDC instead of the local users... is this a possibility?

2007-07-08T07:21:00.000Z	tchmnkyz		is there any docs anywhere i can read on this subject?
