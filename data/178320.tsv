2008-06-11T18:35:00.000Z	cjohnson	Jack_Sparrow	it's not that I want to use wubi, it's just that I'm tyring to figure out why Ubuntu in general is having trouble with my machine
2008-06-11T18:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	cjohnson	You are asking wubi specific questions..
2008-06-11T18:36:00.000Z	cjohnson	Jack_Sparrow	right, because wubi was the only way I could even get it to install. the normal installation, and alternate, for 8.04 and 7.10, all fail to load the installer. wubi installed, so that's what I'm using to debug
