2010-01-14T01:36:00.000Z	ysmn2		is there a program where it will read text I paste into a text box aloud?

2010-01-14T01:38:00.000Z	ysmn2	DJones	will it read all the text onscreen, because i don't want it to do that.
2010-01-14T01:39:00.000Z	DJones	ysmn2	I'm afraid I don't know about that, it snot something I've used, i'm just aware that it offers a text to speech capeability, I'm sure somebody here might be able to answer questions on usage though
