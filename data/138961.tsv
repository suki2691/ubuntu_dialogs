2008-05-09T10:36:00.000Z	Ollie	Rat409	I downloaded realtek-linux-audiopack-5.01.tar.bz2, extracted it, and ran sudo ./install - it went on for a while, and then came up with an error "Make[2]: *** [ja.gmo] Error 1"
2008-05-09T10:37:00.000Z	Rat409	Ollie	try alsa,org and see what it says for your soundchip. i don't have realtek here,but most are supported bt default kernel,just need to know module  to load
