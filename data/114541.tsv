I have a laptop and external monitor attached to it. I'm having a bit trouble with the ATI's proprietary drivers and getting the resolution right for my monitor (1680x1050). I don't need the picture in my laptop screen, only the monitor..  (I have ubuntu8.04)

2008-05-08T19:15:00.000Z	elmix	ikonia	ok, but I'm willing to take some info as a private message if possible :)
