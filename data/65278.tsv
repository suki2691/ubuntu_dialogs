2009-02-27T22:05:00.000Z	Tod-Laptop		I need to install an older version of perl.  I can only see 5.10.0-11.1ubuntu2 and .10.0-11.1ubuntu2.2, but I need 5.8.7-10ubuntu1.2   It's ubuntu server 8.10.  I get the version numbers I can see from apt-get showpkg perl
2009-02-27T22:06:00.000Z	Tod-Laptop		How would I get info about the older versions so I can install it?
