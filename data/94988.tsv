2008-06-11T07:08:00.000Z	unavailable		with firefox, chatzilla is installed, any way to make chatzilla open without opening firefox?

2008-06-11T07:10:00.000Z	dmsuperman_	unavailable	you close the window, but technically firefox is still running
2008-06-11T07:11:00.000Z	dmsuperman_	unavailable	in windows at least, when I close the window but chatzilla is still open, the firefox.exe process continues to run
