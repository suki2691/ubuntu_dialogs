2007-04-19T15:56:00.000Z	pressureman	PirateHead	it's easy
2007-04-19T15:57:00.000Z	PirateHead	pressureman	I tried creating a jigdo file to make an ISO, and I couldn't get it to work. It failed at something or another. Then again, that might have been because I was trying to do it on my windows box. I actually haven't tried it using ubuntu.
