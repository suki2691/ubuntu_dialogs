2010-10-05T17:22:00.000Z	heslam	timothy	external devices IS checked under the "user privileges" tab (on the user settings window)
2010-10-05T17:23:00.000Z	heslam	timothy	mount user-space filesystems (FUSE) is unchecked though, and i remember installing an MTP library that mentioned FUSE. i'll get back to you if i figure it out :P
2010-10-05T17:23:00.000Z	timothy	heslam	ok
