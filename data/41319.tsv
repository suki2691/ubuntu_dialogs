2009-12-10T03:21:00.000Z	eremite		Sometimes I lose sound in video games.  Trying to play AssaultCube and it has no sound.  Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesnt. Anyone got a fix or know what might be the problem? On karmic, compiz disabled.  No sound in AssaultCube, but on the odd occasion it works.
