2008-10-26T07:36:00.000Z	Shakedown		So after reading the man pages I'm still not clear on what the difference between 'sudo apt-get clean' and 'sudo apt-get autoclean' is. Which should I use?
2008-10-26T07:36:00.000Z	CjMaster	Shakedown	Either will work, just use autoclean
2008-10-26T07:41:00.000Z	CjMaster	Shakedown	You don't really have to do anything
2008-10-26T07:55:00.000Z	CjMaster	Shakedown	Yes
