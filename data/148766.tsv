2007-01-16T09:53:00.000Z	Daemonic		When I boot the 6.10 live cd it works fine until I get to the desktop where it freezes are random times. Is this a common problem? I've run memtest and had it check the CD for errors.. none were found. I'm pulling my hair out here. =\
2007-01-16T09:55:00.000Z	Daemonic		Anyone else heard of hardware problems with 6.10? Athlon 64, 512 ram, ATI X700pro, with just about everything else disabled that isn't needed. It boots and I can open a terminal and stuff but it will hardlock at random times.

2007-01-16T09:58:00.000Z	TheHoly08	Daemonic	my guess is that its an issue with the amd64 iso.
