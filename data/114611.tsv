2008-01-13T01:07:00.000Z	Slyboots		Im having a odd ACPI issue with a Thinkpad R61 and the latest updates of Ubuntu Gutsy in that it does not seem to work at all, Shutting the lid does not make the laptop enter suspend and disconnecting the AC line makes the machine hibernate :P
2008-01-13T01:08:00.000Z	evil_tech	Slyboots	have you tried ThinkWiki? They had some good how-tos
2008-01-13T01:08:00.000Z	Slyboots		Hibernate does not work either as I get graphical corruption and the inablity to log into the desktop enviroment (although GDM loads) untill I reboot
