2011-09-06T21:45:00.000Z	DeltaEpsilon		another question related to Ubuntu. it looks like an gnome-panel applet crashes from time to time during startup. Does any one experiencing this problem?

2011-09-06T21:47:00.000Z	glebihan	DeltaEpsilon	unfortunately I'm not sure it will get fixed as gnome 2 is on the way out
2011-09-06T21:47:00.000Z	DeltaEpsilon	glebihan	it is these kind of basic features problem that  make me go back to Windows 7 every time
