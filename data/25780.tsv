2010-09-20T01:12:00.000Z	mgolisch	gimlep_p0	its probably not in the repo you added? did aptitude spit out any errors?
2010-09-20T01:14:00.000Z	gimlep_p0	mgolisch	no errors.
2010-09-20T01:15:00.000Z	gimlep_p0	mgolisch	it is on the repo. i add it manually. it has to work on ubuntu 10.04 because it is the repo link for lucid. it writes on official site.
