2007-07-31T12:28:00.000Z	Desktom		hi all. I have 2 interfaces eth0 and eth1. They have an ip like 192.168.0.x. I want to force the use of eth1 for routing to the 192.168.0.0/24 subnet.. how do I do that ?
2007-07-31T12:30:00.000Z	Desktom		hey all. I have 2 interfaces in the same subnet. How can I force my machine to use eth1 to communicate to the subnet instead of eth0?
