2012-05-07T23:19:00.000Z	_dolmen_		Is there a reason why my 11.10 amd64 system does not get the 12.04 in update-manager?
2012-05-07T23:21:00.000Z	Sidewinder	_dolmen_	Update Mgr. won't list that until 12.04.1 is released; sometime in June, I believe.
2012-05-07T23:22:00.000Z	_dolmen_	Sidewinder	do you have a pointer to a bug or a document?
2012-05-07T23:23:00.000Z	Sidewinder	_dolmen_	It's not a bug, so the answer to your first is no; the second I have heard, many times, here..
