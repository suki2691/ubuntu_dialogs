2010-09-03T22:31:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ClassyYap	ok - well i don't have the foggiest how to manually add libraries, maybe it's just a matter of copying them in there - but i'm not sure.  i don't really think it's the greatest ideal to try manually adding libraries actually... but you need to use sudo to copy anything into /usr.  best of luck.
