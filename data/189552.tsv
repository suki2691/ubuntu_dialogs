2006-04-27T16:03:00.000Z	eneried	o_o	see if there's an installer on the live CD, fourm said it will be developed to final version
2006-04-27T16:04:00.000Z	o_o	eneried	yes, my plan exactly =) downloading as we speak, thx
2006-04-27T16:24:00.000Z	eneried	o_o	there's no installer n the live CD? i'll try to do that from the ubuntu itself, from windows you'll have the trouble that windows doesn't have the full support to file system needed
