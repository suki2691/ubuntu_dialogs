2007-11-04T03:41:00.000Z	Fryguy--		How do I save changes to preferences I make in compiz-config settings manager?  I changed some keybindings for scale and the old ones are still active and the new ones aren't
2007-11-04T03:42:00.000Z	Pelo	Fryguy--	ask in #compiz-fusion
2007-11-04T03:43:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Pelo	it's related to the recent ubuntu upgrade of compiz packages (was working fine before the upgrade), so I thought that this would be a more appropriate place
2007-11-04T03:43:00.000Z	Pelo	Fryguy--	I'm not saying it is not , I don'T know anything about compiz so I am directing you to their channel
