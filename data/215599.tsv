2007-10-14T15:20:00.000Z	soundray	antec	yes, you can upgrade to 6.10 and from there to 7.04. But it's better to wait for 7.10 and do a fresh install using that, imo
2007-10-14T15:23:00.000Z	soundray	antec	yes. You should do a backup first. Or have 7.10 resize your existing partition and use it as /home
2007-10-14T15:23:00.000Z	soundray	antec	are you on 64bit?
