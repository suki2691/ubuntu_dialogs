2007-02-08T08:06:00.000Z	ericskiff		Hey there folks :) I've got a silly question. I just got a mac, and I'd like to install ubuntu on it for dual booting
2007-02-08T08:06:00.000Z	ericskiff		I know I don't want the powerPC version, since I've got an intel chip
2007-02-08T08:06:00.000Z	ericskiff		but can I use the general i386 ver?
2007-02-08T08:06:00.000Z	blameless	ericskiff	no, you'll want the x86 version, but i'm not sure how you boot efi on a mac
