2011-01-20T08:47:00.000Z	Wiesshund		My favorite way to install (with 2 HD) is install windows in HDA, then unplug HDA and install linux on HDB. then either drive could explode, and the other os would boot just fine

2011-01-20T08:48:00.000Z	txdv		i got 9 os'es on one disk
2011-01-20T08:49:00.000Z	Wiesshund	txdv	i was being over dramatic :) but the point was one disk can disapear and the other wont care (In my case it dissapears cause i pull it and take it to another machine)
