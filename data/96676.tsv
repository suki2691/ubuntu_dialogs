2008-05-01T07:16:00.000Z	kneeki		After doing my 8.04 updates from Beta to Live, I'm missing all of my screen resolutions (only have 640x480 and a smaller one to choose). I've already attempted to do a 'nvidia-xconfig' to reconfigure my xorg.conf file, but it did not seem to have any effect. Any ideas what my next step should be?
2008-05-01T07:17:00.000Z	mophead	kneeki	how did you do the nvidia-xcionfig?  I'm having trouble
2008-05-01T07:18:00.000Z	kneeki	mophead	I typed 'sudo nvidia-xconfig' in cli, and it regenerated my xorg.conf file
2008-05-01T07:18:00.000Z	mophead	kneeki	so sudo <name of program> will run it then?
