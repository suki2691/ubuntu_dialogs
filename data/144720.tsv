2007-02-27T14:42:00.000Z	Matic`Makovec		Okay now. I have this AGP Graphics card (Nvidia 6600 GT) and so I downloaded some nvidia drivers and all that and did nvidia-xconfig. After that I rebooted the computer and X server couldn't start because of Fatal error: no screens found. Does anyone know the most common reason for that issue?
