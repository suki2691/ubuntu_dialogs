2005-04-17T12:18:00.000Z	Enspyron		I want to install  a new linux distribution on my webserver, and if everything works well I will also install it on my workstation... would you recommend Ubuntu?
2005-04-17T12:19:00.000Z	Enspyron		dunno.. just give me your opinion as to why ubuntu is the better
2005-04-17T12:19:00.000Z	kisielk	Enspyron	lol, strange place to be asking :p
2005-04-17T12:20:00.000Z	kisielk	Enspyron	kind of like going to Microsoft and asking if they recommend Win2k3...
