2007-06-28T08:30:00.000Z	jrib	Kyle123	none?  I'm not sure I understand the question...
2007-06-28T08:32:00.000Z	jrib	Kyle123	the dvd has all of the main and restricted repository including kubuntu, xubuntu, etc...
2007-06-28T08:34:00.000Z	jrib	Kyle123	ubuntu uses gnome by default, kubuntu uses kde, xubuntu uses xfce.  They all use the same repository and you can install the same programs (including kde on ubuntu).  The difference is the default programs and settings
