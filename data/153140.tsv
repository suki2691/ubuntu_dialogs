2007-07-13T12:36:00.000Z	ArtesMagae		I am pretty new to IRC (I must live under a rock, eh?) and I am a bit confused. I used GAIM to connect to this chat. When I check the room list, this chat has the most users in it. Is this only true for chats on freenode's network?

2007-07-13T12:38:00.000Z	ArtesMagae		Indy: Because they have nothing else currently. :P
