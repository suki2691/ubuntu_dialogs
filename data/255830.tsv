2004-12-07T09:14:00.000Z	sladen	magik_	as long as you understand that hoary is in *development*.  Will and *does* break from time to time
2004-12-07T09:14:00.000Z	magik_	sladen	yeah thats cool, but aside from that... anything else?
2004-12-07T09:15:00.000Z	sladen	magik_	you don't need to change anything else to upgrade, if that was your question
