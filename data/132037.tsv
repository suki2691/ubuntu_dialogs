2007-06-19T13:49:00.000Z	AisDeck		OK, another try: My ubuntu keeps crashing/freezing randomly not even ctrl+alt+backspace helps, I've checked the logs, but theres nothing. I also checked the core temperatures and they were normal. I have absolutely no idea what might be causing this.
2007-06-19T13:50:00.000Z	hatredx	AisDeck	is this after long periods away from X session?
2007-06-19T13:51:00.000Z	hatredx	AisDeck	run memory testing yet?
2007-06-19T13:52:00.000Z	hatredx	AisDeck	there is an option at the Grub boot screen for memtest86 or something of that nature. It will test the integrity of the memory as that could be a potential cause... just a step in troubleshooting.
