2009-01-23T08:22:00.000Z	chasmarang		is Intrepid Ibex 8.10, kernel 2.6.27-11 or is the kernel 2.6.27-9?
2009-01-23T08:23:00.000Z	Flannel	chasmarang	Likely both.  (well, one at one time, and the other at the other time)
2009-01-23T08:25:00.000Z	Flannel	chasmarang	I believe its currently at -13, but I can't say that for certain.  Just regular updates will install the latest kernel, which will be chosen at your next reboot (you can manually choose at the GRUB menu)
