2007-12-21T23:55:00.000Z	negativo-	smultron	its true what they say about skype uses ticks interval to execute some stuff and this couldnt be detected?
2007-12-21T23:57:00.000Z	smultron	negativo-	so is it a pretty big security hole? say, on a windows machine?
2007-12-21T23:58:00.000Z	negativo-	smultron	i read something about that. it use a time space betwen interrupts do some stuff, on windows and unix based systems.
