2009-11-13T06:37:00.000Z	nvme	acu	the NTFS drive is internal, the external drive was HFS+, i was trying to transfer data between mac and windows
2009-11-13T06:40:00.000Z	acu	nvme	does not matter where it is NTFS sucks with regard to compatibility - for mac - I have no ideea - I know that fat32 it is easier and more consistent than NTFS - so you are runing a windows machine with NTFS and want to transfer your HFs files on the pc? I doubt that ubuntu chanel can help you with that
2009-11-13T06:41:00.000Z	nvme	acu	well considering the partition broken when i was transferring files in ubuntu, i thouight this was the right place
