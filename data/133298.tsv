2007-05-31T06:49:00.000Z	kevincastfiction		The opera .deb file I'm trying to open keeps giving me an error. It says it's either corrupted or my permissions aren't set-up. The permissions are fine, so how is the file corrupted? It's from the Opera's official website. I tried to install it before I ran dpkg --configure -a.
