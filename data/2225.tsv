2012-07-03T00:38:00.000Z	JustAPerson		Hi! I've fucked up my 2 day old 12.04 install, is it possible to reinstall it without burning a CD? i.e. via command line

2012-07-03T00:39:00.000Z	JustAPerson	shaneo	Idk, I installed a few things and now nautilus won't open because of a dynamic lib problem, and a lot of visual problems
