2011-06-03T23:14:00.000Z	oal		How can I search through a secondary hard drive for a file? locate only works on my main drive, it seems.

2011-06-03T23:16:00.000Z	oal	_mike__	and oCean I can browse it and it shows up under "Places" as 976 GB file system. sudo updatedb doesn't appear to do anything?

The fact that updatedb does not do 'anything' means that is has nothing to update. As soon as you have mounted the 2nd filesystem, you should run the updatedb command
