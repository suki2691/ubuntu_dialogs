2008-10-18T03:02:00.000Z	IdahoEv		how do I figure out which package contains the application 'gzcat'?   I've tried both package search, apt-cache search, and google with no success
2008-10-18T03:03:00.000Z	soundray	IdahoEv	it should be zcat and it's default
2008-10-18T03:04:00.000Z	soundray	IdahoEv	you can always alias gzcat=zcat  so you don't have to change your habit
2008-10-18T03:05:00.000Z	IdahoEv	soundray	okay, muchas gracias guys.
