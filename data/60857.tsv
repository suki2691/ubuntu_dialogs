2009-04-05T23:35:00.000Z	basement		Question (Newb):  I have installed Ubuntu 8.10, setup user ect.. when I try to copy a file to /usr or /ect the permissions are set to only allow root.  I know I can go to terminal and do sudo su (but i'm not so good with CLI), but other than log-off log-on as Root, is there a way in Ubuntu Gnome GUI to give a user temp root privilages so I can copy my files?.

2009-04-05T23:37:00.000Z	aar	basement	sorry: sudo -i
2009-04-05T23:38:00.000Z	basement	aar	Thank you as well, will remember, no sudo su
