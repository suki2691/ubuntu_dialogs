2008-10-09T03:22:00.000Z	xomp		help, I can't install this theme I have, says it failed. I'm dragging the theme package "theme.tar.gz" to the "Appearance" window in Gnome and that's when I get the error.
2008-10-09T03:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	xomp	 uncompress the package to some other directory and look at whats in it.. it may be in nexted subdirs..or the wrong kind of theme file
2008-10-09T03:24:00.000Z	xomp	Dr_willis_	when I extract the theme package there are several folders like 16x16, 48x48 etc. EXTRAS, scalable, index.theme.
2008-10-09T03:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	xomp	 looks like an icon theme package to me.
