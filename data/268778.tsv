2005-05-07T12:54:00.000Z	Lanlost		How do I disable suspend mode? My laptop needs to be closed and right now I have to keep it open all the time to use it
2005-05-07T12:54:00.000Z	Lanlost		I want to VNC to it and have it closed but it goes into suspend when I close the lid
2005-05-07T12:55:00.000Z	Lanlost		yes?
2005-05-07T12:55:00.000Z	bob2	Lanlost	suspend on lid close isn't enabled by default
