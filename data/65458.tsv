2010-03-13T19:39:00.000Z	dbeav		hi everyone. I just installed Ubuntu for the first time, and need some help
2010-03-13T19:40:00.000Z	dbeav		thx
2010-03-13T19:41:00.000Z	dbeav		after the install, two out of three times, the bios doesn't get past the RAM check. I never had this problem before. It does not happen when I disconnect the HD. I tried installing on a different HD, but still the same problem.
