2007-04-23T12:02:00.000Z	aunes	underwatercow	sounds like that would be fairly easy to do with cron.
2007-04-23T12:02:00.000Z	underwatercow	aunes	I suppose... it would be nice if there was a GUI option though. I don't feel like setting up a cron tab right now, lol
2007-04-23T12:04:00.000Z	underwatercow	aunes	I just found a utility for Gnome, it sits in the panel notification area and sets a random wallpaper at login, or on a regular basis (or on demand)
