2005-02-13T13:48:00.000Z	__Penny		I'm looking for some help getting japanese input to work in openoffice on ubuntu... does someone have a minute?
2005-02-13T13:49:00.000Z	__Penny		I'm following a tutorial, and it asks me to edit .gnomerc but I'm not sure where that is or where it should go... can someone help?
2005-02-13T13:50:00.000Z	__Penny		thanks pvh.  if it doesn't exist, I should create it?
