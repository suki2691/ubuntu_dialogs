2009-03-30T09:45:00.000Z	RickZilla		Should rhythmbox be able to rip a cd directly to mp3 format? I have the codecs installed, but it's not an option under the preferred formats. However, when I click to edit the preferred formats, it's listed as an option. Any advice with this? Thanks in advance for your help.
