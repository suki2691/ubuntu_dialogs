2005-04-13T07:09:00.000Z	ewhitten		I have an amd64 box that only runs for about 5-10 mins. before it completely locks up.  this happens in every distro that I've tried.  I've also swapped out every piece of hardware in the box (aside from the motherboard and cpu).

2005-04-13T07:09:00.000Z	aquo	ewhitten	so the cpu or the mainboard is broken
2005-04-13T07:10:00.000Z	ewhitten	aquo	 it actually runs fine in windows.
