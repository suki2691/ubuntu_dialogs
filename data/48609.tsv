2009-09-25T01:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	quantumlemur	Yes that's what some of us do here, help others with Ubuntu
2009-09-25T01:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	quantumlemur	and unfortunatly no one that helps in here, can help with most problems, or so it seems
2009-09-25T01:45:00.000Z	quantumlemur	sebsebseb	well, even if a lot of problems don't get fixed here, it at least gives people a place to start, and plenty of things do get fixed
