2007-01-12T17:52:00.000Z	acke_ubu	Vigo_	yes installed winxp after. no i would think ubuntus boot would be on sda4 while my winxp partition would be on sda1 and did replace another winxp on the same partition
2007-01-12T17:55:00.000Z	Vigo_	acke_ubu	I did the same, sorta, wiped XP off and put a stable Win2k on it, niw no Ubuntu boot, I am figureing it is in the BootVolume Manager, prolly just a line of text , I wanted to see if I could fix it without Win anything.
