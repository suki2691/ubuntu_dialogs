2006-10-31T17:11:00.000Z	dnite		ok. I haven't had any problems before today, but Firefox has just frozen my computer solid about 6 times now. My mouse still moves. The system still works in the background (i unplugged a harddrive and got messages that said i should have hit eject), but the system doesn't respond to the mouse or keyboard at all.. anyone else run into this problem? The only thing that changed today was an adblock plus update in firefox..

2006-10-31T17:13:00.000Z	dnite	LjL	I actually haven't tried to restart the x server with ctrl alt backspace.. i've tried alt f4, alt f2, alt f1..  and i've tried to get to another console with ctrl alt f1. nothing responds..
2006-10-31T17:14:00.000Z	LjL	dnite	*shrugs* try uninstalling that adblock thing. i don't really know :-\
