2012-10-02T10:29:00.000Z	cjs	Domincii	If you're asking what you should use, I'd start with chromium and see how you like it. It's generally a bit faster and a bit more secure. But if things about the UI start to bug you, try Firefox.
2012-10-02T10:30:00.000Z	cjs	Domincii	Well, chrome rendering processes crash way more often that Firefox ever did for me, but on the other hand that doesn't crash the browser itself; you can just go back and reload the page.
