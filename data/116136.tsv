2008-10-10T07:48:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Geoffrey2	yes, java went open source, and it still works as well as it ever did
2008-10-10T07:52:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	zcat[1]	would that be Sun's java implementation, or a different one?
2008-10-10T07:52:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Geoffrey2	sun open-sourced their java afaik.. not sure which version this applies to but the open source once now is genuine sun java
