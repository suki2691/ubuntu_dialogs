2006-10-03T13:01:00.000Z	SeanTater		Someone seems to be scanning my web server looking for something, daily or even more often. They are looking for some php chat software or something, but I cannot block them because each scan comes from a new IP, but the same domain. What do I do?
2006-10-03T13:02:00.000Z	kothz	SeanTater	in a .htaccess put the line deny from somedomain.com?
2006-10-03T13:02:00.000Z	SeanTater	kothz	um-- okay
2006-10-03T13:02:00.000Z	SeanTater	kothz	I;ll try that
