2012-08-28T19:37:00.000Z	Alpha-Omega		one thing that should be fixed though in the Ubuntu minimal install is having the default suggested place of Grub to be installed be the drive which the install was done and root was installed, not sda when sdb is what was used for the install, had an issue with that yesterday

2012-08-28T19:39:00.000Z	Alpha-Omega	jrib	yep, it seems that firefox will be updated with every new release, odd why they chose to do that, most likely because of the frequent updates and wide-spread usage of the browser I'm guessing
