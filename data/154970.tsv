2006-12-11T10:48:00.000Z	Amaranth	ragawu	No, grub runs at like 640x480
2006-12-11T10:48:00.000Z	Amaranth	ragawu	I doubt you want to use that on the desktop
2006-12-11T10:49:00.000Z	ragawu	Amaranth	in the middle of a graphics card switch, agp slot is damaged, ubuntu freezes after grub. gentoo loads fine. I need to force a console mode on ubuntu.
