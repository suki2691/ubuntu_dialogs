2008-11-17T12:57:00.000Z	toastedmilk	DIFH-iceroot	I found it, but this is my real problem:  I ping 82.211.81.158(myself?  the router?) and get 0% successful packet transfer, as appossed to entirely not finding the address.  I have already tested my ethernet cords, and they are working fine.  I have also tested other computers on my network, and they work fine, but mine won't work even when they aren't using bandwidth.
