2010-05-14T00:55:00.000Z	juanca		I'm using Ubuntu lucid and some programs are hanging and making the system feel like I'm in a bad virtual machine... can System Monitor help me find something wrong with the memory management?

2010-05-14T00:57:00.000Z	juanca	cellofellow	ironic, but anyway, with that info do you know how to detect something wrong?
2010-05-14T00:57:00.000Z	cellofellow	juanca	if my ram is full I'll SortBy mem in htop and find out what is hogging ram, same with CPU.
