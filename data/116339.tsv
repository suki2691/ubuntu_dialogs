2007-10-27T02:54:00.000Z	oxeimon		what's the bash command to open up a terminal window?
2007-10-27T02:55:00.000Z	oxeimon		what I want to do, is write a script to somehow open 3 terminal windows, positioned exactly as I say on the screen, with specified sizes
2007-10-27T02:56:00.000Z	oxeimon		why does xterm look different from the terminal I open from Applications->Accesories?
2007-10-27T02:57:00.000Z	rayb0t	oxeimon	because the one you open from applications/accessories is gnome-terminal
