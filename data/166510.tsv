2008-05-18T08:40:00.000Z	wols_	misngh	it doesn't, but: every new ubuntu release has a number of people with problems. never update to it immediately...
2008-05-18T08:44:00.000Z	wols_	misngh	this is a SUPPORT channel, not a RANT channel. so yes you are OT
2008-05-18T08:45:00.000Z	wols_	misngh	so you can ask about the specific problems you have but not rant about them.
