2008-10-06T02:46:00.000Z	bep		i ran across http://www.ubuntu-eee.com/ and was wondering if it is basically just for the eeepc?
2008-10-06T02:46:00.000Z	bep		i was also wondering if its an official release from ubuntu or a spin off
2008-10-06T02:47:00.000Z	open_sauce	bep	I run it, its highly customised for eeepc in terms of drivers and various fixes
2008-10-06T02:48:00.000Z	open_sauce	bep	Im sure it will boot on other laptops, but its focused on working with tht eeepc hardware
