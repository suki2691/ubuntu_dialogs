2009-10-20T17:52:00.000Z	jrib	meowmintx	I appreciate the info but that's not really helpful in this channel unless someone specifically asks about it.  A better approach would be to create a nice wiki page with the directions made specific to Ubuntu and then create a thread on the ubuntu forums about it so anyone interested can try it out
