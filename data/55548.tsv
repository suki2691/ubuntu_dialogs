2009-06-05T00:30:00.000Z	Finswimmer		Hello, I have installed an own kernel. Now I need lircd modules which are built against my own kernel. dpkg-reconfigure lirc-modules-source gives me: Error! Could not locate lirc_atiusb.ko for module lirc in the DKMS tree.

2009-06-05T00:30:00.000Z	Finswimmer	ikonia	Hmm. Where else?
