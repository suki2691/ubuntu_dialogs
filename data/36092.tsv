2010-03-08T10:24:00.000Z	HPtwhite		ok this is prolly gonna sound like a dumb question, but im a n00b so please bare with me; im running dual displays on ubuntu 9.10, how do i get the main screen to be on the left monitor? i found out how to turn off the mirroring to make it span, and to have it show the correct position on my desk so my cursor will span from monitor to monitor left to right properly, but the menus and stuff...
