2007-12-07T07:42:00.000Z	scguy318	MikeyMike	silly suggestion, but have you defragged? :P
2007-12-07T07:42:00.000Z	MikeyMike	scguy318	 i'm pretty sure it's not fragmented but i can check again
2007-12-07T07:43:00.000Z	MikeyMike	scguy318	 i just analyzed my partition and it says i do not need to defrag
