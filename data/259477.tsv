2006-04-04T16:54:00.000Z	neomancer911		what's an ideal hard disk free space for ubuntu? thx
2006-04-04T16:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	neomancer911	depends what you want to do with it - about 4 gig minimum I'd say
2006-04-04T16:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	neomancer911	!.8 or 2 gig won't give you any room though
