2008-10-25T22:23:00.000Z	PeterBye		I'm using /set irc_conf_mode 1 in xchat but I still see notifications from people entering and exiting
2008-10-25T22:23:00.000Z	PeterBye		shouldn't those notifications be supressed ?
2008-10-25T22:23:00.000Z	legend2440	PeterBye	you have to restart xchat
2008-10-25T22:23:00.000Z	PeterBye	legend2440	thanks!
