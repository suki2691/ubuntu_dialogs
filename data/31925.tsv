2010-05-14T09:33:00.000Z	Phayt		Hi.  I'm trying to install Ubuntu 10.04 - this will be my first Linux distro.  I've burned the iso onto a CD-R using Alcohol 120.  When I try to boot from it, it goes to a loading screen, then freezes up on a black screen with a white prompt in the top left (though you can't actually type anything).  Why is this happening, and how can I fix it?

2010-05-14T09:34:00.000Z	magn3ts	Phayt	can you describe the loading screen?
2010-05-14T09:37:00.000Z	Phayt	magn3ts	iirc, it says ubuntu towards the bottom.  It's got a little image that I think is supposed to be a battery?  Not sure.  It's a dark, warm color, I think red.  From that it goes into a black screen that says something to the effect of STARTING ISOLINUX, something about debian, a copyright.  then it goes into the blank screen with the white prompt.
