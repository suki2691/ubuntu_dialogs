2007-03-23T10:17:00.000Z	l90bpm		ok..  you know how you can take your mouse to the corner and make all the windows show up together?  Is there a way on dual monitors to only make one monitor do that.. kind of like a piler..  and still have one monitor showing a full screen browser?  hope that made sense
