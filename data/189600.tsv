2007-03-14T07:13:00.000Z	TelVGG-Ariel		any apt-* command returns segment violation
2007-03-14T07:14:00.000Z	rm_you	TelVGG-Ariel	yeah, go to packages.ubuntu.com, download the packages you need manually, and install them with dpkg -i --reinstall whatever.deb
2007-03-14T07:14:00.000Z	rm_you	TelVGG-Ariel	dependencies are normally a pain in the ass, but since you're only reinstalling, it won't be a problem ;P
