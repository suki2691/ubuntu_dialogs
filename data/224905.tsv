2010-10-24T06:01:00.000Z	KimLaRoux		I have a simple question regarding upgrading an hard-drive with Ubuntu installed on it
2010-10-24T06:02:00.000Z	KimLaRoux		Has anyone ever succeeded in a simple "sudo cp -a /"? or am I just crazy to think about it?
2010-10-24T06:02:00.000Z	yhager	KimLaRoux	you are crazy :)
2010-10-24T06:04:00.000Z	yhager	KimLaRoux	cause not all "files" there are files, like /proc and /dev
