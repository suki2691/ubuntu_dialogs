2010-10-21T21:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	danieru	 whats the exqact command you are using anyway?
2010-10-21T21:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	danieru	 you have a directory named *. Hmm..    could be you should do some fancy quoteing. or rename it using some other file manager.
2010-10-21T21:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	danieru	 try the 'mc' file manager.  why are you trying to chmod it and not rename it?
