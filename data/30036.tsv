2010-10-18T00:10:00.000Z	ChogyDan	augdawg	doesn't look like a problem
2010-10-18T00:11:00.000Z	augdawg	ChogyDan	: it says that it failed to update the repository information. it also tells me t check my internet connection, but it is working fine.
2010-10-18T00:11:00.000Z	ChogyDan	augdawg	but none of those repos are vital
