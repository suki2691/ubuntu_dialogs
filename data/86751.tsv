2008-07-08T10:21:00.000Z	Fryguy--	dunas	open both files up in text editor and copy/paste from one to the other
2008-07-08T10:21:00.000Z	dunas	Fryguy--	Gah, I meant folders. And there's a LOT of files to sort through here. ._.
2008-07-08T10:24:00.000Z	dunas	Fryguy--	The ultimate problem being I'm used to Windows, where it's drag the two folders with the same name, then tell it to Merge them, while here it wants to overwrite.
