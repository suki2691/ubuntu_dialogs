2010-05-02T10:40:00.000Z	shadow0		I just installed 10.04, and all seems well, except my wifi (a ASUS PCI-G31) is not willing to connect.  It sees SID's in the list, but I've tried to connect to two routers that I can connect to with other PC's, and it always fails.  Both routers are OPEN (no security)  what should I check?
2010-05-02T10:41:00.000Z	keyhive	shadow0	what is the failure message?
2010-05-02T10:44:00.000Z	shadow0	keyhive	Connection Established, followed by Connection ....
2010-05-02T10:44:00.000Z	keyhive	shadow0	hhaha
