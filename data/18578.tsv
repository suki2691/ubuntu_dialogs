2011-02-02T02:22:00.000Z	ubuntuuuss		Question about shell scriptting --> If I have got a string variable and want to assess what's inside it with an IF statement, so that the IF takes as yes that the variable contains a given word (inside the string, which could be much longer), what form should the IF statement follow ?
2011-02-02T02:23:00.000Z	Agent_bob	ubuntuuuss	it's not likely that anyone in here will answer that.    try in   #bash
2011-02-02T02:27:00.000Z	Agent_bob	ubuntuuuss	again    /join #bash     that's what it's there for.
2011-02-02T02:27:00.000Z	ubuntuuuss	Agent_bob	okay, I will do that, excuse me.
