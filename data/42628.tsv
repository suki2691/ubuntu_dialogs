2010-08-26T02:38:00.000Z	Roland		hi.. how to achieve this: I have 2 identical drives, I'd like have half of it in raid 0 and half in raid 1
2010-08-26T02:39:00.000Z	Roland		actully more than 2 hopefully
2010-08-26T02:39:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Roland	if they're identical why would you want half mirror half extended on each, why not just have one whole hdd for storage and the other hdd mirroring?
2010-08-26T02:44:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Roland	sorry to be harsh, but i think your money was probably better spent on other hardware upgrades to net speed gains rather than buying a 2nd HDD
