2008-12-29T19:51:00.000Z	bakermd		I tried installing Ubuntu linux on a machine with an IDE to CF card adapter.  The install went fine, but the machine will not boot on its own: First I get an exception that says 0x6 frozen from initramfs, the last 2 errors are ata1.00: status: { DRDY ERR } and then ata1.00: error: { ICRC ABRT }  any ideas?
