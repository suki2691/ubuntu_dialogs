2006-01-21T12:59:00.000Z	smarco	jeffgr	install iptables and apache?=
2006-01-21T13:00:00.000Z	jeffgr	smarco	i might use iptables if there is a tutorial to configure it
2006-01-21T13:01:00.000Z	smarco	jeffgr	yes there are many, might wanna look at the ubuntu site or forums. but you will have to invest a little time to learn this stuff so dont be frustrated too soon :)
