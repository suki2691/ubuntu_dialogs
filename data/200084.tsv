2009-07-30T02:59:00.000Z	loufoque		how can I select custom settings for compiz in appearance? I installed compizconfig-settings-manager, but the option doesn't appear.
2009-07-30T02:59:00.000Z	nanotube	loufoque	it should show up under system -> preferences somewhere
2009-07-30T03:01:00.000Z	loufoque	nanotube	CompizConfig does appear under system > preferences, but that's not my question, i want to be able to select "custom" in system > preferences > appearance > visual effects.
2009-07-30T03:02:00.000Z	nanotube	loufoque	hmm, don't know, then. i don't even run compiz. :) maybe someone else can point you true.
