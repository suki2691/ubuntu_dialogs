The last distro I ran on h ere was Red Hat 9, and it did... but Slackware and Suse always had problems with this.
2007-01-15T10:15:00.000Z	Jowi	samalex	the 686 kernels have smp enabled
2007-01-15T10:16:00.000Z	Jowi	samalex	the name of the kernel to use depends on which version of ubuntu you're installing.
