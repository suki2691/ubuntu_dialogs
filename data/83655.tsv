2008-08-01T21:43:00.000Z	MikeSeth	JeanEaccentaiguD	on my laptop, aticonfig did all of that for me
2008-08-01T21:45:00.000Z	JeanEaccentaiguD	MikeSeth	but with compiz fusion, nvidia, and a bad principal screen, it appears to be another pair of manches !
2008-08-01T21:46:00.000Z	MikeSeth	JeanEaccentaiguD	i dont have an nvidia card so I wouldn't know, but it went smooth on my ATI X300
