I've had two machines go down at the same time that have had 120+ loads that take 10 minutes for ssh to log into, then 5 minutes to come up with a command prompt and either don't respond at all or take 10+ minutes to issue commands

2009-08-10T15:01:00.000Z	frogzoo	JediMaster	sorry - /etc/security/limits.conf
