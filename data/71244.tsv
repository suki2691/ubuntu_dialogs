2008-12-26T03:07:00.000Z	AndySaunders		Hey all, despite installing libdvdcss2 and setting my region code, I am still having issues with encrypted DVDs not playing. Is there anything else that I need to do?
2008-12-26T03:09:00.000Z	AndySaunders		I am getting the "The source seems encrypted...are you trying to play an encrypted DVD without libdvdcss"? error in totem-xine, and I have installed libdvdcss2. Anyone able to help?
