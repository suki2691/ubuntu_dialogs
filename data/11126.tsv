2011-08-05T08:12:00.000Z	cjs_		I have a laptop that's currently dual-boot (10.04 and XP). I'd like to run my XP partition in a KVM instance; is there a way to do that? Setting the instance's block storage device to /dev/sda gets me a grub menu, but when I boot Windows from that it fails with "A disk read error occured. Press Ctrl-Alt-Del to restart."
