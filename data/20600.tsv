2011-01-22T16:41:00.000Z	bicyclerepairman		I come from gentoo. for some reason su doesn't work in ubuntu so for now I use "sudo bash"
2011-01-22T16:41:00.000Z	bicyclerepairman		is there any way to get that working?
2011-01-22T16:42:00.000Z	schnuffle	bicyclerepairman	the root passwd is disabled in default ubuntu o sudo -i or udo su -
2011-01-22T16:44:00.000Z	schnuffle	bicyclerepairman	it' not disabled, the root passwd is disbaled
