2010-02-11T08:13:00.000Z	Bennage		is there a ctrl+alt=del type command that can be used if my system crashes?
2010-02-11T08:15:00.000Z	darolu	Bennage	you can press "ctrl+alt+F1 to get a command line where you can kill any specific process
2010-02-11T08:16:00.000Z	darolu	Bennage	I forgot to say, you can return to the GUI with ctrl+alt+F7 (took me a while to figure it out the first time I tried lol)
