2010-11-18T21:54:00.000Z	lock		hey guys, i installed BT4 in a multiboot with ubuntu and winXP, and now GRUB is not pointing to the correct location for the ubuntu boot (ie cant boot ubuntu), suggestions?
2010-11-18T21:55:00.000Z	lock		should i find original grub and update it to include BT4 or should i use the BT4 grub?
