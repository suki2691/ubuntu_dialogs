2006-10-03T15:36:00.000Z	JordanB		can I update to EdgyEft beta without using the GUI manager?
2006-10-03T15:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	JordanB	 i would advise against updating to edgy at this time.
2006-10-03T15:38:00.000Z	JordanB	Dr_willis	 thanks, I am just stuck.  I need to get Gnome reinstalled and I am just not sure where to start.  I thought updating might be easiest.
2006-10-03T15:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	JordanB	 you did good - if you managed to break gnome. :P
