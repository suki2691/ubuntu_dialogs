2010-01-14T03:20:00.000Z	hiexpo_		yes i have found a replacement for everyone i have ever had and find them to usely be better
2010-01-14T03:20:00.000Z	max1	hiexpo_	 because windows sucks but some of their programs like word are very common to have to use
2010-01-14T03:23:00.000Z	max1	hiexpo_	you can edit word docs in linux but its hard to convert the edited office file back to word
