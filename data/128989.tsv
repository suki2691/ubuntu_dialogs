2009-10-28T18:05:00.000Z	Jimmio		Hey all. I have my public key and the secret passcode that made the key... but not my private key. Can I still decrypt my files? If no, I'm never encrypting again >_<
2009-10-28T18:07:00.000Z	ks3	Jimmio	Probably not... the private key is very important
2009-10-28T18:08:00.000Z	Jimmio	ks3	...FUCK!
