2008-03-07T12:59:00.000Z	Ubuntu-Noob		was wondering if someone could help me with a prob - basically, fresh install of linux, all the updates done, but whenever I try to play a vid from the net (a stream) its very jerky, you notice it loads with larger vids. With smaller vids it aint that noticeable. ANyone help me? Plz
