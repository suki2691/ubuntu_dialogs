2009-11-28T00:43:00.000Z	pbunbun		Hey, I'm using Kubuntu and basically networking isn't started until I log into KDE and KNetworkManager connects, so if I go into a different XSession or virtual terminal it won't connect to the network
2009-11-28T00:43:00.000Z	pbunbun		Is there any program I can get, or settings I can set to have network-manager auto-connect at boot?

2009-11-28T00:44:00.000Z	pbunbun	maco	Not if my other session is just the console, or Virtualbox :P
