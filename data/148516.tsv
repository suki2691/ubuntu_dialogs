2009-09-06T01:49:00.000Z	suman		i am kinda confused... when i type 'su', the password i type seems to be wrong but when i type 'sudo su' it goes to the root user without asking the password...
2009-09-06T01:49:00.000Z	suman		what is the deal with this??
2009-09-06T01:50:00.000Z	jussi01	suman	sudo -i for a root prompt
2009-09-06T01:51:00.000Z	suman	jussi01	Dr_Willis  so does that mean su is kinda deprecated in ubuntu??
