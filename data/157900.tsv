2009-05-22T21:30:00.000Z	Slart	Raex93	the speakers don't work?? what kind of high-tech space age speakers are these?
2009-05-22T21:31:00.000Z	Slart	Raex93	hmm.. sounds like a soundcard problem.. but anyways.. I thought they were special digital speakers or something
2009-05-26T03:03:00.000Z	Slart	Raex93	yes.. most of the time they are the same thing
