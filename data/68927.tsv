2009-07-13T22:28:00.000Z	aaron		I'm having an issue when trying to copy files from a dying hard drive to a  new one.  It will copy several files and then start throwing up exceptions and I/O errors that I don't really understand.  I know the drive has been overheating so I'm worried about continuing to try if it may result in a loss of data.  Any ideas?
