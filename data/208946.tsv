2005-11-02T13:00:00.000Z	dooglus	Mea_Culpa	there are a lot more architectures supported for debian, so there are a lot more package files available for debian
2005-11-02T13:01:00.000Z	dooglus	Mea_Culpa	as for different packages though, I'm not sure.  I guess ubuntu's "universe" contains all the debian packages, so ubuntu has more different packages than debian
