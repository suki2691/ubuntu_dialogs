2008-01-07T06:29:00.000Z	gerzel_		Q: I got a problem.  I need to access a web adress that begins with a '-' however the linux resolver (following the standard) does not recognize the address as a properly formed one.  Windows does.  I need to find a work around.

2008-01-07T06:31:00.000Z	tanath	gerzel_	er, my bad
2008-01-07T06:34:00.000Z	tanath	gerzel_	i guess you'll have to use a web dns service or something and use the direct ip address
