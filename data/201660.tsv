2006-08-15T14:29:00.000Z	egkamp		hello, I'm trying to install over a windows xp using the Live CD, but it is *slow*, taking over an hour to display the desktop, and clicking "Install" icon has taken over 20 minutes to open a window, which is still trying to fill the language selection...is there still a non-live installation CD? where to get the iso? any help is appreciated!
