2007-06-17T11:51:00.000Z	Heme		behold! I'm back with another problem. Got ubuntu (7.04) installed but cant get my pppoe-based (I think) internet to work, found this: https://help.ubuntu.com/7.04/internet/C/connect-to-internet.html#modems-adsl-pppoe <-- and followed it but after typing that "sudo pppoeconf" it asks for password. I cant even type anything to that as it just blinks blankly and only registers enter.
2007-06-17T11:53:00.000Z	Heme		make my internet connection working
2007-06-17T11:54:00.000Z	Heme		it doesnt work on ubuntu so I have to switch to XP when I want to use net
