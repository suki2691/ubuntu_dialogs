2006-01-07T15:53:00.000Z	pat		Can anyone help me with the configuration of the multi bootloader grub? I've installed ubuntu and now after restarting my desktop I get a menu with OS choice and 10 seconds timeout. I would like to change the sequence of the menu items and reduce the timeout. Where can I do that? I've seen a menu.lst file in the bootload directory, but this file is readonly. Where can I make modifications?
