2007-11-05T02:40:00.000Z	vms		I've installed Ubuntu on my sony vaio picturebook c1vpk.  It uses a crusoe processor.  When Ubuntu boots up, it says the CPU is too old for the kernel.
2007-11-05T02:41:00.000Z	vms		How should I go about getting a generic kernel on this so I can compile a kernel more appropriate for the system?

2007-11-05T02:42:00.000Z	fatcatmatt	vms	maybe try a basic debian install ??
