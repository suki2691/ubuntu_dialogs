2006-10-12T08:44:00.000Z	ACETACE		quick question... console shell problem... i setup my ubuntu console shell color nicely so everything fit... when i ssh to my school server (yes i'm still in university.... struggleing to complete my degree) all the sudden i realized the color does not work so well anymore.... is this a configuration on my local machine console or configuration on my school console? what should i do?

2006-10-12T08:46:00.000Z	ACETACE	ellioTb	and tritium, the problem is when i log onto the school server using ssh, i appear to be using a different set of colorscheme with the same background (black)
2006-10-12T08:46:00.000Z	ACETACE	ellioTb	and tritium, i guess my question is whether if there is a method to syncronize both? or configure them to be the same?
