2006-06-07T14:38:00.000Z	bigfoot1		my question is: what's the difference betewwen what i did and what you are telling me to do?
2006-06-07T14:40:00.000Z	leenks	bigfoot1	eject will always try and umount before it ejects
2006-06-07T15:11:00.000Z	bigfoot1	leenks	ok. so i don't need to remember the hard-to-remember command "umount".
