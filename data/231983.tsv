2010-10-17T18:35:00.000Z	nemchik_		im back, same problem as before, i cannot seem to start X on my desktop, it looks like my xorg.conf is calling for the nvidia driver which is not installed, the one available to me through apt-get seems to have some issues (which is how i landed at the terminal in the first place) im currently booted from a livecd (or rather liveusb) and it dont seem to have an xorg.conf here - would removing the xorg.conf from my main drive cause 
2010-10-17T18:36:00.000Z	nemchik_		p.s. im using ubuntu 10.10 with an nvidia graphics card and i have the xorg ppa installed (i think that's what it's called)
