2007-04-15T10:29:00.000Z	phr0ze		My video files will not play with default player. I installed VLC but it is not the default. How can I properly make it the default?
2007-04-15T10:30:00.000Z	LaNCeloT_RW	phr0ze	 man, right click on the file, then, open with .. Other Programa .. then select VLC, and then check the button, Open always with VLC .. (something like that)
2007-04-15T10:33:00.000Z	LaNCeloT_RW	phr0ze	 well dude, which player do u want to use, once VLC is not the right one? (it doesnt show video)
2007-04-15T10:38:00.000Z	LaNCeloT_RW	phr0ze	 man, i use Windows Media Player to run .wmv here.. because my system is 64Bit, and i didnt find 64-bit codec for that video extension
