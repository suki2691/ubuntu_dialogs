2012-08-17T17:10:00.000Z	daemontux		look in your sound settings i had that problem and my volume was just all the way down
2012-08-17T17:10:00.000Z	daemontux		well that was under xine
2012-08-17T17:11:00.000Z	zykotick9	daemontux	hiding the mouse cursor would be application specific (for instance, right now when i move my mouse to my other monitor with MythTV my cursor disapears - an option in Myth).  What are you using for video?  i don't use xine, so i'm no help.
