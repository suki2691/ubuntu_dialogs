2010-11-22T19:26:00.000Z	malkoun	pradeep	I believe so, just make sure you satisfy the requirements, a friend of mine has ubuntu on a netbook
2010-11-22T19:27:00.000Z	pradeep	malkoun	i know there is a netbook version called remix but i was asking if u can actually install the desktop version
2010-11-22T19:28:00.000Z	malkoun	pradeep	yes that is what I meant, he installed the desktop edition, just make sure you have enough ram etc., which you should if it is relatively new
