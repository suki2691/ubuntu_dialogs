2006-07-01T16:41:00.000Z	dsas		could someone explain to me how to add http://people.ubuntu.com/~jdub/edgy/ to my sources.list? I know that I need to add another deb line, but how do I find out the section name?

2006-07-01T16:42:00.000Z	dsas	andi5	I still need to know the section name to do that.
2006-07-01T16:42:00.000Z	andi5	dsas	sorry! i mean system->administration->software properties (do not know english name)
