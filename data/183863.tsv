2006-06-02T10:05:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos		Am I allowed to ask a drivers question for Dapper Drake?
2006-06-02T10:05:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos		I'm running 6.06 on a PowerBook G4 1.5GHz with a Radeon 9800 128MB GPU. Apparently ATI doesn't have a PPC fglrx driver...is there nothing I can do to use XGL?
2006-06-02T10:06:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos		The installed driver, radeon, doesn't have any 3D acceleration enabled.
