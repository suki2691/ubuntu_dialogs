2007-10-05T09:51:00.000Z	xsacha	peepsalot	i just right click, quit and then i choose never run on startup
2007-10-05T09:53:00.000Z	peepsalot	xsacha	mihaX14 well i mean, i was doing an update.  it was just taking forever.  you know when some window does an update, and it pulsates in the taskbar to show that something happend?  you can usually just clikc to it once, and it will stop pulsstaing, but not the update manager
