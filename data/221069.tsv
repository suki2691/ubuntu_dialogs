2005-09-11T05:45:00.000Z	sml12	pussfeller	unfortunately my apt-get has now broken twice with breezy :(  not sure why
2005-09-11T05:46:00.000Z	pussfeller	sml12	then maybe you should start over with a fresh, up to date iso :)
2005-09-11T05:47:00.000Z	sml12	pussfeller	downloaded the latest kubuntu build so I will give that run i think
