2007-12-27T15:41:00.000Z	JacobSingh	gobbles414	thanks!  Is there anyway to have it ask me where I want to save it?
2007-12-27T15:43:00.000Z	gobbles414	JacobSingh	You're welcome. I do not know of any way to "print" to a different location. But you can always create a shortcut of the PDF folder in another location for quicker access
