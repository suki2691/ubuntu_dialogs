2007-03-23T13:29:00.000Z	nclife		what is the command to set the write permissions for a folder? I want it to have write permission
2007-03-23T13:29:00.000Z	Jello-red	nclife	sudo chmod +w, I believe it is.
2007-03-23T13:32:00.000Z	nclife	Jello-red	it gives write access to the first folder, but not to the milliard other folders that are inside it
2007-03-23T13:34:00.000Z	Jello-red	nclife	My apologies then.
