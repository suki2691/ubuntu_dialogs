This is extremely obnoxious, as whenever I close a tab in gedit, or gnome-terminal, the next tab is unresponsive. The only way I have found to recover the focus is to launch a new application, then close it, and rely on the window manager's focus stack to regain control of the app

2011-02-12T23:26:00.000Z	ohsix	PurplePeter1	are you using rdesktop as well?
2011-02-12T23:26:00.000Z	PurplePeter1	ohsix	Nope.
