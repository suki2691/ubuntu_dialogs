2012-04-30T19:23:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat		My network notification disappeared - what package can I install to make it come back?
2012-04-30T19:24:00.000Z	theadmin	FunnyLookinHat	That'd be "networkmanager" (or something along the lines. Might be "nm-applet" or "networkmanager-gnome" or somesuch)
2012-04-30T19:24:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	theadmin	yeah networkmanager doesn't exist - I'll search for the nm package though thanks
