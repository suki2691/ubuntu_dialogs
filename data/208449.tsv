2006-04-14T06:56:00.000Z	tkup	leagris	what other types of "authentification media"? could you elaborate on that?
2006-04-14T06:58:00.000Z	leagris	tkup	like ldap or any other pam plugins involving anything not related to shadow, users, group files
2006-04-14T07:00:00.000Z	tkup	leagris	are you suggesting that he should modify those parameters through systems commands (ex: usermod)?
