2008-04-28T08:19:00.000Z	underscore		hey, I just booted ubuntu from windows where I did openGL programming. I would like to do some more openGL programming: how do I get the openGL packages for ubuntu? i.e. gl.h, glu.h, and glut.h?

2008-04-28T08:20:00.000Z	underscore	SeveredCross	where can I find those?
2008-04-28T08:20:00.000Z	SeveredCross	underscore	No idea to be totally honest, apt-cache search oughta help you.
