2010-08-27T06:11:00.000Z	SteelWing		This is odd. I plugged in a USB Flash drive and Ubuntu (10.04) just froze on me. Upon rebooting trash is gone I now have cd drive 0 permanently stuck in my places tab and computer,trash and most other things done with Nautilus are coming up as unsupported actions. Would anyone have any idea as to why this is happening?

2010-08-27T06:14:00.000Z	SteelWing	the-erm	No I was just plugging it in to grab a picture from this laptop and bring it to my desktop
2010-08-27T06:17:00.000Z	the-erm	SteelWing	the problem would like in a ~/.config file.
