2009-01-12T07:56:00.000Z	imyousuf		I have libnss3 and libgnutls13 installed but pidgin (for gtalk & msn) still complains it can not find suitable ssl, any hints please? (Ubuntu 8.04, Pidgin 2.1.1)
2009-01-12T07:57:00.000Z	Starnestommy	imyousuf	what about openssl's libssl?
2009-01-12T07:57:00.000Z	imyousuf	Starnestommy	ok, installing that as well
2009-01-12T07:58:00.000Z	imyousuf	Starnestommy	I have libssl0.9.8 installed as well :(
