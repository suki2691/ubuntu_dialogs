2012-09-18T14:02:00.000Z	tomboy64		i am using ubuntu 12.04 and need a quick hint on how to check/modify crda
2012-09-18T14:04:00.000Z	tomreyn	tomboy64	what's "crda"?
2012-09-18T14:12:00.000Z	tomboy64	tomreyn	well, logs never show any info, so i fear it's not being used
2012-09-18T14:14:00.000Z	tomreyn	tomboy64	i'm afraid i can't help with CRDA, I've never worked with it before, and the system I'm working with noe has a wired connection only, so can't test.
