2006-08-14T09:44:00.000Z	erf`		Is there anyway to stop the default vnc server on boot in dapper?
2006-08-14T09:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	erf`	 ive never noticed a default vnc service.
2006-08-14T09:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	erf`	 in fact i manually set up a default vnc server, so  i could vnc in and get the GDM login.
2006-08-14T09:46:00.000Z	erf`	Dr_Willis	 I've setup my own vnc server but I want it to use the default port (5900), but the default vnc server (vino-server) is still using it
