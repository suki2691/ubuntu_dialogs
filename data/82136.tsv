2008-08-16T14:47:00.000Z	SmileyTSL		*switched
2008-08-16T14:47:00.000Z	SmileyTSL		And yes, 10 is very stable.
2008-08-16T14:48:00.000Z	DistroJockey	SmileyTSL	ahh, ok. I recently tried Intrepid with FF 3.0.1 and install flash 10 and it crashed straight away. Where as Hardy with FF 3.0.1 with flash 9 works fine for me
