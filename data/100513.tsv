2008-08-12T00:46:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey		I have an .avi video that I'm trying to upload to facebook, but its too large to upload (its like 717.4 MB). How would I shrink this to 300 MB or less?
2008-08-12T00:47:00.000Z	prince_jammys	d4rkmonkey	heh. that's huge. i'm amazed that facebook allows that
2008-08-12T00:58:00.000Z	prince_jammys	d4rkmonkey	have you ever been able to open one? you may be missing some libs
2008-08-12T00:59:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	prince_jammys	well I've been able to play some movies that I... completely legally aquired... that are in .avi format, so I don't know what the issue is with the videos I'm trying to shrink now...
