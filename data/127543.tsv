2010-02-09T07:11:00.000Z	DasFlo		I am trying a Dual Boot - Windows 7 and Ubuntu 9.10 64bit. Windows is on my internal hdd, Ubuntu is on an external hdd. The external hdd has 900GB ntfs for general storage, 100GB ext4 for / and 4GB swap. Grub is installed on the external hdd. I can choose a OS in grub. Windows loads fine. If I chose Ubuntu, the system immediately freezes
