2004-10-16T16:19:00.000Z	djuuss	sivang	yes, and failed miserably
2004-10-16T16:21:00.000Z	sivang	djuuss	: it's intended to be a router machine. However I havn't got past d-i. it enters an endless loop of "Enterting lowmem moade"
2004-10-16T16:22:00.000Z	djuuss	sivang	there are router-livecd's for that
