2011-06-10T20:29:00.000Z	AdvoWork		how do i find out my ati name, without opening the case?
2011-06-10T20:29:00.000Z	edbian	AdvoWork	sudo lspci -k
2011-06-10T20:29:00.000Z	edbian	AdvoWork	(-k not really needed)
2011-06-10T20:29:00.000Z	edbian	AdvoWork	perhaps sudo lspci | grep ati    would be helpful
