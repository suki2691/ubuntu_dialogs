2008-05-25T17:32:00.000Z	Slart	Isador	don't run your os as root.. it's just bad.
2008-05-25T17:38:00.000Z	Slart	Isador	if you want to run everything as root, I don't think ubuntu is the distro for you.. try one of the others
2008-05-25T18:14:00.000Z	Slart	Isador	noone forcing you.. we just don't want to help you.. big difference there
