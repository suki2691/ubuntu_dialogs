2009-05-23T03:14:00.000Z	|ntegra|	Xarver	what is your flash problem?
2009-05-23T03:26:00.000Z	|ntegra|	Xarver	these are all in firefox i presume? >you'll have to 'clean up' the other installation(s) ...apt-get will clean out one nicely (the two of them will be conflicting) and then $locate flash (inside .firefox prolly) and rm
2009-05-23T03:26:00.000Z	Xarver	|ntegra|	It's in all browsers
