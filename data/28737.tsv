2010-07-20T14:43:00.000Z	manje		hi there. in the past, i've been able to copy .deb files into /var/cache/apt/archives from one host onto another, preventing re-downloading of the packages, but trying to do so now, from 9.10 to 10.04 makes no difference. i.e. the upgrade process is downloading all the packages again. has anything changed?

2010-07-20T14:45:00.000Z	manje	Beyecixramd	yes, i've copied lucid packages from an already upgraded machine onto the one which i want to upgrade
2010-07-20T14:45:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	manje	maybe there's a different dir, i'm not sure
