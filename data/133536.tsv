2010-01-05T19:58:00.000Z	faileas	btz	lostchat is nice, VERY light and simple
2010-01-05T19:59:00.000Z	faileas	btz	i use it on my minimal installs. i'd use it if not for being so used to konversation ;)
2010-01-05T20:00:00.000Z	faileas	btz	btw, ubuntu and xubuntu use xchat. kubuntu uses quassel (which is an interesting concept) though lots of people prefer konversation or kvirc. there's also a bunch of cli clients like irssi
