2009-11-07T05:19:00.000Z	MoTec	Thrawn	sudo mkdir /mnt/hd && sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/hd
2009-11-07T05:20:00.000Z	MoTec	Thrawn	your drive might be sda or hda and the number after that represents the partition..
2009-11-07T05:21:00.000Z	MoTec	Thrawn	so make a mount point for it like /mnt/hd and then mount /dev/sda1 /mount/whatever
