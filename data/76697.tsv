2008-10-25T14:21:00.000Z	Some_ux		I have a bit of a problem, most of the help i find for ubuntu management is GUI based. but I run everything in commandline. I need some help in how to setup a hdcp and routing (with firewall)
2008-10-25T14:23:00.000Z	Some_ux		I need a good tutorial on how to setup my ubuntu as a router and dhcp server. The box has two eth ports, but is not connected to a monitor. I use ssh to login remotely.
2008-10-25T14:24:00.000Z	[admin]	Some_ux	search for iptables chains, and use dhcp3-server
2008-10-25T14:25:00.000Z	[admin]	Some_ux	iptables is not easy though , you have to learn alot
