2007-12-09T21:52:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm		ok...so it looks like i have nothign in mime.types to indicated that .js should be turned into a mime type of text/x-matlab... but when i double click on the file for editing, it changes mime types from application/javascript. any pointers?
2007-12-09T21:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	radioaktivstorm	what about not double clicking and trying a diff editor..
2007-12-09T21:54:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	Jack_Sparrow	the file will open if i select an editor and not double click, but the issue i have is that i never had matlab in the first place.
