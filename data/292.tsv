2012-11-26T02:19:00.000Z	oneremainsclear		I'm trying to delete old system files in Windows 7, I switched into Ubuntu to delete the files there but now I can't see the files. They are on my D: drive and I can see all of the files on my C: drive, but not the D.
2012-11-26T02:20:00.000Z	yeats	oneremainsclear	ubuntu doesn't enumerate drives the same way as windows, so no C: or D:, just /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, etc.
2012-11-26T02:21:00.000Z	oneremainsclear		I know, the files I am trying to delete are on a partition, I have found the partition in ubuntu but I can't see the files.
