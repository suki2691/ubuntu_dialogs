2009-03-19T19:20:00.000Z	Zzeiss		I let one of the system manglers try to set up my laptop so that the KVM vm of Fedora could access the Internet; he set up a "bridge" that never worked.  We reset the /etc/network/interfaces file back to what it was before, but now my wired network (eth0) won't reconnect unless I do a "sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart".  What else might he have buggered?
2009-03-19T19:21:00.000Z	Zzeiss		and moreover, what can I do to fix it?
2009-03-19T19:21:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Zzeiss	you should ask in #fedora :)
2009-03-19T19:22:00.000Z	Zzeiss	Jeruvy	Oh, he didn't bugger Fedora.  he buggered the Ubuntu.  :(  Which is what I mainly boot....
