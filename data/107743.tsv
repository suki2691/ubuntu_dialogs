2008-01-09T11:16:00.000Z	Shai_A		anyone here knows when a fix for the flash plugin is supposed to be released? approximately? I'm new to linux so I don't know how long it usually takes...
2008-01-09T11:18:00.000Z	fallore	Shai_A	do you need help getting flash installed, or just want to know when the automatic installations will be fixed?
2008-01-09T11:19:00.000Z	Shai_A	fallore	the latter
2008-01-09T11:19:00.000Z	fallore	Shai_A	ah, dunno. sorry
