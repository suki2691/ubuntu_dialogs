2009-04-27T08:54:00.000Z	SoulNothing		Hey quick question im trying to install 9.04 but no video shows up, I have a 9600gt, i know appending vesa to the grub line which worked before 9.04 but no go now.  I'm aware of the altnerate install cd however i dont have any spare blank cds, ive tried deb bootstrap, and a usb flash drive and no go booting it up, is there any option i can append to get it to go to vesa on the live installer?
