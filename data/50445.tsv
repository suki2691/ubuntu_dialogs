2010-05-30T17:44:00.000Z	azolap		hey.. does anyone know about using e2fsck to repair a damaged hard disk? i ran it overnight and it did this badblocks check.. and now it says "Error reading block xxxxxx while getting next inode from scan. Ignore error<y>?" and "Force rewrite<y>?" .. it does this for thousands of blocks. i have been holding down the enter key for 10 minutes to say yes to them all, is this normal??
2010-05-30T17:46:00.000Z	azolap		oh dear :( LjL can this -y option be toggled while it is running? i don't want to have to run e2fsck again it took like 6 hours to get this far
2010-05-30T17:48:00.000Z	azolap		haha yes that is a good idea. LjL i am running e2fsck from the ubuntu livecd because i couldn't boot up ubuntu normally (i dropped my laptop soi think the hard disk got damaged).. do you know if it is likely that after e2fsck has finished i will be able to boot into ubuntu normally again?
