2009-04-07T00:07:00.000Z	tmbigrigg		is it possible to install kde4.2 in Hardy?
2009-04-07T00:09:00.000Z	tmbigrigg		so far I have had no luck in finding out how to get 4.2 in 8.04 Hardy
2009-04-07T00:09:00.000Z	e3co	tmbigrigg	sudo apt-get install kde
2009-04-07T00:09:00.000Z	tmbigrigg	e3co	will that install kde4.2 or 3.5?
