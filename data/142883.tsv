2007-06-09T05:45:00.000Z	psst	Enverex	actually it's cyg-apt, but it's the same deal
2007-06-09T05:46:00.000Z	Enverex	psst	Right, so your entire windows install is managed through a repo as are all the apps installed in it?
2007-06-09T05:47:00.000Z	psst	Enverex	no - just some of it.  I write software.  No machine I use a lot is ever going to have ALL of its software managed by one package management system
