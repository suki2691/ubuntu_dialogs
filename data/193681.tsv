2006-07-08T11:09:00.000Z	Breezy-CA		Hi all ... I am looking for a fool-proof (because I have been a fool from time to time) upgrade procedure from Breezy to Dapper. When I went to Breezy, I didn't make sure that ubuntu-desktop was installed (something I'd done had taken it away, apparently), and lived without Ubuntu for a day or so until, with help from people here, I fixed my errors. Is there a quick and easy guide to avoiding such n00bie errors when I move to Dapp

2006-07-08T11:10:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Breezy-CA	should be easy with the upgrade wiki entry.
