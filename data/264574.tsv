2005-01-16T17:35:00.000Z	RavingIdiot		I have a quick question regarding updating Ubuntu. Now, in the FAQ, it mentions adding extra sources to the apt sources. If you actually add those, then do a upgrade, could that potentially break Ubuntu because none Ubuntu supported packages get installed in place of the Ubuntu ones?
