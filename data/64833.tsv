2010-11-26T03:52:00.000Z	number9		hey all I can't boot my laptop... the only thing that shows is this error:"GLib-WARNING **: getpwuid_r(): failed due to unknown user id (0)" in the bug reports it seems like people only get it sometimes and it doesn't prevent gdm from loading but not for me, I can't get it to boot at all, and get droped to an init shell.... any ideas?
