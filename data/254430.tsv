2004-12-26T11:05:00.000Z	mart		can I umount a usb stick without using sudo?
2004-12-26T11:05:00.000Z	mart		seems strange that it is mounted automatically, but I can't seem to umount it as a normal user
2004-12-26T11:06:00.000Z	sjoerd	mart	pumount
2004-12-26T11:08:00.000Z	mart	sjoerd	thanks, but now it doesn't even automount....
