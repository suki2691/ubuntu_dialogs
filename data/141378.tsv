2007-04-01T09:35:00.000Z	m_		hello, I recently am not able to open my *.odt documents anymore. The OpenOffice splash screen pops up and then nothing happens. I'm on Kubuntu Feisty beta1.
2007-04-01T09:36:00.000Z	m_		what log can i look in for errors?
2007-04-01T09:36:00.000Z	kbidd	m_	if you try and load openoffice directly, instead of trying to open an .odt file, does it load?
2007-04-01T09:37:00.000Z	m_	kbidd	no, it does the same thing. splash and exit.
