2010-01-19T06:12:00.000Z	marc__		I have a HTPC running winxp, another computer running linux most of the time for web development but booting in WinXP for gaming. I want to create a file/print/torrent server in the closet with a spare computer I have. Should I go with NFS or Samba?
2010-01-19T06:13:00.000Z	linxeh	marc__	CIFS (samba), or do both
2010-01-19T06:13:00.000Z	linxeh	marc__	nfs is easier for unix hosts, but a PITA for Windows
2010-01-19T06:16:00.000Z	linxeh	marc__	what happens using the command line ?
