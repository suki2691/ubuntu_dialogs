2007-07-22T09:48:00.000Z	tambu		Can someone at least say they don't know, to my question i'm getting paranoid my messages aren't being received :) Does anyone know where/how to get truss onto ubuntu? Thx

2007-07-22T09:49:00.000Z	tambu	IndyGunFreak	thx.. I need to install truss. I can't seem to find it pre-installed nor a package for it
2007-07-22T09:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tambu	then you'll likely have to compile it from source
