2008-08-25T04:48:00.000Z	Rhodetrem	carandraug	that's right ;) can I update it via apt-get?

This would make taking care of dependencies easier than just downloading the deb file. Also, I've heard you can get msnp15 support with previous versions if you compile it yourself and make a small changes. The code for has been there for quite soem time but had some bugs
