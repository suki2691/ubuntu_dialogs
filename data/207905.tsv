2005-12-05T14:32:00.000Z	derrickw		can anyone recommend a good linux alternative to dreamweaver? or are linux users too hardcore for wysiwyg editors? i know html, of course, but coding elaborate CSS based web sites in Kate can be a nuisance

2005-12-05T14:33:00.000Z	derrickw	djm62	- thanks. do you have a preference between the two?
2005-12-05T14:33:00.000Z	djm62	derrickw	my preference: emacs, but I do know there are alternatives
