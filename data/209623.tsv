2011-05-30T15:41:00.000Z	spacetime		what does the "l" command do? I could'nt find any man pages.
2011-05-30T15:41:00.000Z	LjL	spacetime	it's an alias for "ls" i believe
2011-05-30T15:42:00.000Z	LjL	spacetime	specifically, it's an alias for "ls -CF"
2011-05-30T15:42:00.000Z	LjL	spacetime	you can open the file ~/.bashrc to see that
