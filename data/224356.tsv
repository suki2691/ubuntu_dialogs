2007-03-12T13:45:00.000Z	dimeotane		I need help doing batch rename.  I have 40 files spread all over a hard drive, & named the same: database.cvs   I can do a find in ubuntu, but then when I try to copy all the files in nautilus it only copies one.  If I drag over another, it will overright.  Do I have to rename each by hand, or can I do a batch find and rename somehow?
2007-03-12T13:47:00.000Z	dimeotane		ie.  database1.cvs database2.csv etc
2007-03-12T13:48:00.000Z	dimeotane		I need a locate/find/search and batch rename program or script I guess
