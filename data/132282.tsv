2010-06-20T09:44:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Fudge	drag it from the places menu to the desktop?
2010-06-20T09:47:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Fudge	heh, when it is opened from places it creates an icon on the desktop
2010-06-20T09:51:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Fudge	create a launcher to mount the remote box, but i'm guessing it will add a 2nd icon with the actual mounted place
