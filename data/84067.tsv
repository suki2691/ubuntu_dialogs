2008-08-08T04:09:00.000Z	edmoore		hi - every time I restart, (hardy) and then ssh in, it seems to go back top the default ubuntu ssh motd, rather than my own custom one. any idea why?
2008-08-08T04:11:00.000Z	harisund	edmoore	Edit the /etc/motd file? (I think?)
2008-08-08T04:11:00.000Z	edmoore	harisund	that is the one that gets reset
2008-08-08T04:11:00.000Z	harisund	edmoore	oh all right one sec, let me check something
