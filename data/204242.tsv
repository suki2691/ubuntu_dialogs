2006-03-24T07:37:00.000Z	Dewi	nalioth	what's off-topic about getting sudo to work correctly?
2006-03-24T07:38:00.000Z	Dewi	nalioth	last time I checked ubuntu DOES rely heavily on sudo
2006-03-24T07:38:00.000Z	nalioth	Dewi	nothing is offtopic, but the channel IS less frequented than here (it's a quiet place to talk)
2006-03-24T07:38:00.000Z	Dewi	nalioth	... oh. fair enough :)
