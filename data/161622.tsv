2006-10-31T11:10:00.000Z	Elbourne		I am getting satellite internet through Direct TV and they were not very happy that we will be running ubuntu linux - or any linux for that matter.

2006-10-31T11:12:00.000Z	Elbourne	dcraven	they come friday to install it. I never used satellite internet before. should the OS matter? I want it to go into the wireless router
2006-10-31T11:15:00.000Z	dcraven	Elbourne	it really depends on the ISP. Short answer is "No, it doesn't matter.". Long answer is that a) they don't know how to use Linux when they come to install, or b) they have spam/spyware software that they want you to use that works on Windows only.
