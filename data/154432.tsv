2006-12-16T06:36:00.000Z	mborg		hey i'm a noob and i'm having some totem issues. .wmv, .avi, .mov video formats do not work at all in totem
2006-12-16T06:38:00.000Z	mborg		is there a reason why totem shouldn't be able to play wmv, mov, or avi video formats?

2006-12-16T06:38:00.000Z	Blah93	mborg	no, I have just recently switched to ubuntu from fc
