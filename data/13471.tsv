2011-06-09T04:40:00.000Z	yoghrt1		hello, I have a question, can I upgrade any debian based distro simply by changing /etc/apt/sources.list (as shown here http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/apt-get-upgrade-debian-lenny-5-to-debian-6-squeeze/ )?
2011-06-09T04:40:00.000Z	LjL	yoghrt1	that's not the recommended method for Ubuntu
2011-06-09T04:40:00.000Z	LjL		!upgrade > yoghrt1
2011-06-09T04:47:00.000Z	yoghrt1	LjL	why it is not recommended?
