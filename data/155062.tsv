2010-07-09T23:28:00.000Z	electronoob		Ok, so I don't even think I'm asking the right question, so feel free to point me in a diffrent direction. I want a script to run, after the install of ubuntu is complete and it boots for the first time. Can someone point me in the direction of what I'm looking for?
2010-07-09T23:29:00.000Z	Kyle__	electronoob	On first boot only, or on every boot?
2010-07-09T23:31:00.000Z	Kyle__	electronoob	So you're making a custom install image... Umm... Humm.  I know RHEL has a firstboot package for that... maybe if you look at the ubuntu OEM install?  That may be the way...
