2007-11-19T12:05:00.000Z	xxw		hello, any one knows how to handle serial interrupt in C?
2007-11-19T12:05:00.000Z	bruenig	xxw	might try ##c
2007-11-19T12:06:00.000Z	bruenig	xxw	yeah they probably told you that because they didn't want to deal with an ubuntuer
2007-11-19T12:06:00.000Z	bruenig	xxw	but your question has nothing to do with ubuntu, it has to do with c
