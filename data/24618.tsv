2012-10-15T07:50:00.000Z	Tynach		Hello, I have a printer that only understands Postscript (not PDF), an HP Laserjet 1300. When printing documents from LibreOffice, it allows me to change the printer settings to Postscript, and things print fine. However, by default, it prints as a PDF - and this causes it to take several minutes to print even a simple one-page document.

2012-10-15T07:55:00.000Z	Tynach	Jordan_U	I thought I had, so I went and double checked. There are indeed no options in system-config-printer for choosing Postscript/PDF.
