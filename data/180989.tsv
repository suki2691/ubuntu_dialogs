2006-06-20T05:38:00.000Z	JohnP789		How can I get Dapper to install into an existing LVM logical volume?
2006-06-20T05:39:00.000Z	zybrid	JohnP789	by choosing the LVM partition?
2006-06-20T05:40:00.000Z	JohnP789	zybrid	The graphical installer doesn't seem to recognize LVM LV's, and only offers to reformat a partition.
2006-06-20T05:40:00.000Z	zybrid	JohnP789	oh, dunno.
