2011-03-28T06:37:00.000Z	FransWillem		Hi, I just installed MythBuntu on a system with a Radeon 9800 Pro, and now just after the splash screen the screen goes and stays black. SSH works, but I can't seem to get it to show anything. During the installation I was given the choice between open source and AMD drivers where I picked the AMd drivers.
2011-03-28T06:37:00.000Z	FransWillem		Would anyone be able to help me troubleshoot this from the command line ?
2011-03-28T06:38:00.000Z	smw	FransWillem	is mythbuntu still under development?
