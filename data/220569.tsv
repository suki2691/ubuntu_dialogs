2005-09-15T16:09:00.000Z	weirdgeordie		Hey, I have a quick question. I have a FAT32 partition mounted as /linwin . When I try to chmod it so other users can write to it, nothing happens and the permitions remain the same
2005-09-15T16:10:00.000Z	shawnz	weirdgeordie	does fat32 even support chmod?
2005-09-15T16:10:00.000Z	shawnz		:/
2005-09-15T16:10:00.000Z	weirdgeordie	shawnz	 No, but still the permitions are set to read only for anybody other that root
