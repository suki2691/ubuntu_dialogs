2007-02-26T13:30:00.000Z	nero		quick question- I am a long time fedora/redhat user, but am thinking of giving ubuntu a try.  I have noticed that there is a desktop and a server version.  I do both desktop (web development) and light serving (web/php/mysql for said web dev).  If I go with the desktop version, is it still easy to install the server apps?

2007-02-26T13:31:00.000Z	nero	dyrne	great.. so the desktop install is ready/can install apache/mysql/php etc?
2007-02-26T13:31:00.000Z	dyrne	nero	yeah. same repos packages etc
