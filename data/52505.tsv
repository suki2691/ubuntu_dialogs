2009-10-31T17:32:00.000Z	Bodsda	web5|org|ua	It does not exist by default, as in 9.04. You can create one if you like
2009-10-31T17:32:00.000Z	web5|org|ua	Bodsda	ok, but where is now stored info for display and xserver ?
2009-10-31T17:33:00.000Z	Bodsda	web5|org|ua	I am not sure. But the best way to influence it is to create an xorg.conf in /etc/X11/
