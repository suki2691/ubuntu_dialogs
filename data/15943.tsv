2011-05-28T11:09:00.000Z	Zerst		Like, my machine has a decent gpu, so should I be using one desktop environment or another to fully utilize it?  I spent quite a while playing around with gnome and compiz and emerald to get it the way that I liked it.  If I decide to install kde and choose it from the login menu, will it disturb my gnome/compiz settings at all?
