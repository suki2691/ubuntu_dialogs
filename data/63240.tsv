2010-01-08T07:56:00.000Z	john3		Hey guys, if I use a ubuntu 9.10 livecd, is the entire disk automatically loaded to the ram or only the parts it needs as i use it? also, when usiing the live cd is there ANY data written to the local hard drive that could leave potential traces?thanks

2010-01-08T07:57:00.000Z	soreau	john3	and everything you do is in ram so will not be saved in any way
