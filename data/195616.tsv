2007-04-27T12:52:00.000Z	Rex_		ok... thanks. So here is my question. I know my monitor supports higher refresh rates than what displayconfig-gtk is setting in my xorg.conf. How can I manually add a line for say, 1280x1024 at 80Hz? The numbers in the strings mean nothing to me. Here is the paste from xorg.conf. http://pastebin.ca/461532
