2009-10-06T19:35:00.000Z	shortlord		hi, everyone, I have a question that is not really ubuntu related, but I don't know where to ask, because I can't connect to freenode (that's the problem). I have a VPN connection here and it seems to refuse freenode...
2009-10-06T19:35:00.000Z	scunizi	shortlord	you're on freenode noqw
2009-10-06T19:38:00.000Z	scunizi	shortlord	try chat.freenode.net/8001
2009-10-06T19:41:00.000Z	scunizi	shortlord	with irc.freenode.net the port is 6667 or something similar..
