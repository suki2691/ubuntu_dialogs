2011-11-27T22:58:00.000Z	oCean	Kimble	there is no 'undo', you have to apt-get remove (or apt-get purge) the packages you just installed
2011-11-27T22:59:00.000Z	Kimble	oCean	I tried that - I repeated the exact command except with "remove", but it only offers to remove 3MB of downloads, where the install was 400MB.
