2009-07-31T16:07:00.000Z	grawity	ikanobori	I thought Pidgin doesn't have webcam support _at all_?
2009-07-31T16:07:00.000Z	ikanobori	grawity	Apparently it shows the message that it is not supported ‘yet’ :-)
2009-07-31T16:08:00.000Z	grawity	ikanobori	If I understand correctly, adding support for webcams and/or voice requires a lot of work, because Pidgin is essentially a GUI to the libpurple libs - and they must keep working without that GUI (on Finch, Meebo, etc).
