2012-01-13T23:24:00.000Z	ALMarshun		running xubuntu on netbook and have home network setup with wpa2-psk, try to connect to network with ssid 620 but everytime i do it just disconnects right away
2012-01-13T23:24:00.000Z	ALMarshun		same problem persists whether i try it on ubuntu or kubuntu as well and when i try to add the network to the network manager it deletes right away
