2010-08-17T04:31:00.000Z	tupi		Hi guys, last night i'd a suddenly power shutdown and i cant pass by ubuntu splash screen, so i disabled the splash at the boot parameters and got it: "init: eucalyptus-network (lo) main process (704) killed by TERM signal", and thats the last message the terminal gives me, then i cant boot the front end. Any idea?
