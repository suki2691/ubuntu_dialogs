2008-03-29T21:43:00.000Z	dougsko	ubuntu_	sudo is nice because it gives you a finer grain of control over the privileged commands a user can run
2008-03-29T21:43:00.000Z	dougsko	ubuntu_	for a single user system, it doesnt matter
2008-03-29T21:45:00.000Z	ubuntu_	dougsko	good point, sudo or gksudo is good if your need more privildges, with 1 root who cares what you do
