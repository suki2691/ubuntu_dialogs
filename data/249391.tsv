2005-02-13T11:25:00.000Z	Tirno		hi all. I've just installed ubuntu, first linux install for me. Everything seems to work out of the box, except sound. I've tried searching around on ubuntulinux but haven't found much info. I've used unix a lot, but I have little idea about the nuts and bolts...
2005-02-13T11:25:00.000Z	Tirno		btw, I have an acer travelmate 4000. there are reports on the laptop page of installs to similar computers without sound problems

2005-02-13T11:26:00.000Z	jasonf	Tirno	like apt, and the such
