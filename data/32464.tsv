2010-05-18T09:13:00.000Z	jabirali	twiztid	hmm... I have little experience with ATI cards (been 5 years since last time I used one with Linux), but it might improve performance to try out the proprietary drivers there too. Although they might be more unstable, as I said, I'm not used to dealing with ATI :)
