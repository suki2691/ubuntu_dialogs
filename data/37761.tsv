2011-05-13T10:38:00.000Z	FordPrefect		I am trying to install a .tar.gz file and when I download it and do tar xvpf name.tar.gz it works fine but after that nothing works
2011-05-13T10:38:00.000Z	FordPrefect		it tells me comment not found when I do name.tar.gz build or name.tar.gz install
2011-05-13T10:39:00.000Z	ohsix	FordPrefect	what's supposed to work? you just extracted the file
2011-05-13T10:39:00.000Z	FordPrefect	ohsix	 after I extract the file I am trying to use an install and build command
