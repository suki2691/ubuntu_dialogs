2007-03-13T05:35:00.000Z	craigbass1976		How does one install mplayer? apt-get install gives me "Package mplayer is not available, but is referred to by another package. blahblah"  It shows up in the add-remove software gui tool, but still won't install.  I've added a couple of archive source lists to sources.list (based on an ubuntu site recommendation) but get the same error messages.

2007-03-13T05:38:00.000Z	craigbass1976	poningru	thanks.  It's working.  Btw, the whoel reason for it is to watch a new dairy queen commercial here http://www.dairyqueen.com/en-US/DQ+Ads/default.htm.  Wicked funny.
