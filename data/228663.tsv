2005-12-11T10:17:00.000Z	spola		i had a problem with getting google to load (on FF) that went away after i deleted cookies n cache. if you can ping google i'd try that first (not sure how to do it in lynx tho)
2005-12-11T10:19:00.000Z	spola		hehe ... ajax on lynx, *good luck*
2005-12-11T10:20:00.000Z	eyequeue	spola	is gmail and google on ajax?  is that perhaps why we can't get to it from breezy?  (trying to determine the causative factor)
2005-12-11T10:29:00.000Z	spola	eyequeue	then scroogle.org it!
