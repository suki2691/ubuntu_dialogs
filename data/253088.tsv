2005-01-16T14:26:00.000Z	pe7er		ok. i try a more detailed question: how do i know what packages are "prebuilt" into the ubuntu kernel? this manual i got tells me i've got to patch the kernel if it isn't patched in order to make it work for my configuration. google = no luck, wiki = no luck. but maybe i just don't know the corresponding lockpick (keyword) yet
2005-01-16T14:27:00.000Z	emwson	pe7er	You can look at /boot/config-2.6.8.1-4-386
2005-01-16T14:29:00.000Z	pe7er	emwson	i'll have a cd to record in a couple of hours, will ps -x while it gets done if you're still there and don't know yet
2005-01-16T14:29:00.000Z	emwson	pe7er	Yeah, thanks. I'm stumped as to how Nautilus works and really could use some cues.
