2009-09-18T05:42:00.000Z	dsnyders		Hi all!  Any sed experts?  I need to convert a web page file with urls into a series of wgets.
2009-09-18T05:43:00.000Z	mezquitale	dsnyders	try #web channel, this channel is ubuntu support channel
2009-09-18T05:45:00.000Z	dsnyders	mezquitale	No good.  I'm looking for help with sed, not with anything directly web related.
2009-09-18T05:46:00.000Z	mezquitale	dsnyders	well maybe someone from #web can direct you to someone with that expertise, this channel is for ubuntu support, you might find someone who knows about sed if youre lucky, just try different times
