2008-07-28T03:22:00.000Z	ikonia	mad	autoremove is the option I think
2008-07-28T03:23:00.000Z	mad	ikonia	autoremove is not anoption with apt-get there is autoclean but it just remove distfiles and not the installed packages i believe
2008-07-28T03:24:00.000Z	ikonia	mad	autoremove should get rid of obsoulte package
