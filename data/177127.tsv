2006-07-07T16:37:00.000Z	MushroomN		hi all, i have a HP nx6120 Laptop that i think isn't displaying 1400x1050 res. I have downloaded the 810 drivers that are from http://www.fairlite.demon.co.uk/intel.html but how do i install it?
2006-07-07T16:39:00.000Z	MushroomN		ok, if they are installed why do i not get the option to set it to 1400x1050 in the screen resolution?
2006-07-07T16:40:00.000Z	MushroomN		system/preferences/screen resolution
