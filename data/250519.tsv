2005-04-13T12:40:00.000Z	Dreamer31	Daehlie	i'm looking at that, but i'm trying to figure out how to do some stuff that the API doesn't seem to make obvious, plus there is no examples
2005-04-13T12:41:00.000Z	Dreamer31	Daehlie	like i want to deliniate all the currently open notebooks then add them to a menu
2005-04-13T12:41:00.000Z	Dreamer31	Daehlie	i have no idea where to start
