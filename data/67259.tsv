2009-01-31T21:28:00.000Z	yoyoned	riley_dt	what are you trying to do
2009-01-31T21:29:00.000Z	riley_dt	yoyoned	I usually always run as root in my dev enviroment and typing sudo takes extra time
2009-01-31T21:30:00.000Z	yoyoned	riley_dt	it can be done, but the channel ops don't like that advice being given in this room
