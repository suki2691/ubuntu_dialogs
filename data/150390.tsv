2009-06-19T23:25:00.000Z	dsgross		> if i wanted to create a awk command that would look at the file crval1_temp.dat which has an entry of the following nature CRVAL1 =3.57870000000000E+00 / Iraf zero point, extract only the 3.57.... and output that to file crval1_.dat what would it look like?
2009-06-19T23:25:00.000Z	dsgross		right now i have "awk '{print $3}' crval1_temp.dat > crval1.dat" but that doesn't seem to work
