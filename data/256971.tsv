2004-11-26T13:03:00.000Z	boldii		how do I upgrade to hoary?
2004-11-26T13:03:00.000Z	|0__0|	boldii	if you have to ask, you're probably not ready
2004-11-26T13:04:00.000Z	|0__0|		hoary is still very rough around the edges
2004-11-26T13:04:00.000Z	boldii	|0__0|	ok, then I leave it. I don t want to break the glibc like in my old gentoo install ...
