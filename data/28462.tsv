2011-01-17T05:14:00.000Z	Daniel		Gah I'm going nuts... can't mount this bloody drive (internal SATA, 250G, NTFS), Ubuntu recognised it at first, no problems, then I moved around SATA ports, then I installed Win7 (seperate new drive) and it won't mount... et al :(. I can access it in Win7 but, says no errors. Ubuntu says "File system NOT clean", and refuses to mount, but can see it in the manager...

2011-01-17T05:16:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Daniel	ok then, boot back into ubuntu
2011-01-17T05:16:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Daniel	hopefully you checked the right drive!
