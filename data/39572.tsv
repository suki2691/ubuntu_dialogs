2010-01-05T10:24:00.000Z	SetiAmon		I don't know there are dozens of sets i was just wondering what i should be going after
2010-01-05T10:26:00.000Z	SetiAmon		terinjokes:they all seem to say "windows certified" and such. I have no experience with this so i was just wondering what i should do or if it was worth the stress,but it sounds like most should be PnP
