2007-09-02T16:44:00.000Z	HomerSimpson		Hi Guys.. I want to change the console resolution on my Feisty server. Setting vga=791 causes the error "You passed an undefined mode number" I think I'm missing a component, as this works on my desktop version. Can anyone help?

2007-09-02T16:45:00.000Z	HomerSimpson		OK... will do
