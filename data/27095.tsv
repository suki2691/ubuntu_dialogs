2010-08-31T00:01:00.000Z	dendrite		no ihavent. ok i might try that. has anyone else had problems installing dotnet 2.0 on ubuntu x86_64?

2010-08-31T00:05:00.000Z	dendrite	Pici	yea its simply "sh winetricks" and you get a list of options. but i've tried that. i have dotnet 1.1 installed. but for some reason 2.0 always fails no matter if i use winetricks or do a manual download/install
