2011-08-02T04:16:00.000Z	ZeZu		why does apt tell me packages are held back and i need to do a dist-upgrade to get them?   I thought dist-upgrade was meant to move to the next release?   ie:  when unstable is moved to stable ...

2011-08-02T04:17:00.000Z	ZeZu		I was thinking that they were being held back because of incompatibilities w/ binary drivers,  but was surprised to see dist-upgrade lets me
