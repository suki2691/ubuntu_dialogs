2010-06-15T15:41:00.000Z	jimi_		Using alsamixer, how can i set the max output above 100% like you can in pulsaudio controller?
2010-06-15T15:43:00.000Z	unop	jimi_	don't think that's possible
2010-06-15T15:43:00.000Z	jimi_	unop	so i have to go back to pulseaudio?
2010-06-15T15:45:00.000Z	unop	jimi_	I guess - there might be some other util that might be able to do this - i know vlc can do this ..
