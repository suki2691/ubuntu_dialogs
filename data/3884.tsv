2012-04-22T01:50:00.000Z	MarcWeber	mirko2	I had in mind there was a service you can sign up getting access to a VNC like virtual ubuntu running in the cloud you can customize without having too much administration work.
2012-04-22T01:54:00.000Z	mirko2	MarcWeber	locally or remote?, really in the "cloud" (OMG, I hate that term!) ? if it isn't any of the VNC, RDP protocols, I have no idea
2012-04-22T01:55:00.000Z	MarcWeber	mirko2	really in the cloud. And tehre is some cloud management service.. But I had something similar but different in mind. MAybe I'm mistaken or they dropped the idea again.
