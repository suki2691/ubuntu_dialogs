2008-07-17T10:14:00.000Z	spiderfire	Reformer81	have a seperate config in your homdir for each browser
2008-07-17T10:15:00.000Z	spiderfire	Reformer81	2 users, 2 configs, 2 browsers
2008-07-17T10:15:00.000Z	Reformer81	spiderfire	That's really kind of defeating the purpose.  I shouldn't have to completely change users just to use a different browser.
