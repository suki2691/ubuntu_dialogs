2010-05-28T05:45:00.000Z	maco	psusi	probably depends how long... could probably bg it though to prevent that
2010-05-28T05:45:00.000Z	maco	psusi	because i know someone who hit ctrl+z and then started irssi again all confused and i told him he could fg it and he was in awe
2010-05-28T05:45:00.000Z	psusi	maco	can't be it since it will try to write output to the tty and fsck up whatever else you're doing
