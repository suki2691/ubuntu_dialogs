2012-03-21T07:18:00.000Z	Hail_Spacecake		I want to have a linux distro with gparted already installed on it to have on a usb drive
2012-03-21T07:18:00.000Z	Hail_Spacecake		so if the 10.11 .iso I downloaded has it already that's fine
2012-03-21T07:20:00.000Z	xangua	Hail_Spacecake	sudo apt-get install gparted
2012-03-21T07:21:00.000Z	xangua	Hail_Spacecake	the live cd/session have it, if you want a persistent usb install you can also install gparted later
