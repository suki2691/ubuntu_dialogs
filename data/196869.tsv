2007-03-20T15:58:00.000Z	Whoopie		hi, I'd like to test something with gnome-screensaver on Feisty LiveCD. but for that, I need to enable screen locking. I already enabled it in screensaver preferences and gave a password to user "ubuntu". but there's no password dialog at gnome-screensaver. any ideas?
2007-03-20T15:59:00.000Z	Whoopie		sudo also needs no password.

2007-03-20T16:05:00.000Z	Whoopie	soundray	ok, thanks.
