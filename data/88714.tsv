2008-07-15T21:54:00.000Z	ubilicios		Hi guys I am trying to see shares on a AS400 using samba.  Now I can view the shares when I list them in terminal but either using Dolphin in KDE or Nautilus in GNOME the directories and files show only question marks in there names and I see nothing in the directories at all
