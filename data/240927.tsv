2005-06-29T13:38:00.000Z	j4sp		Hi , I have a laptop with an Athlon XP 2800 processor. It is capable of running at 1600 mhz, but in ubuntu it runs at 800 mhz.
2005-06-29T13:38:00.000Z	Choubaka	j4sp	it's in powersacing mode.
2005-06-29T13:39:00.000Z	Choubaka	j4sp	I think it should use the entire 1600 MHz if you need it :P
2005-06-29T13:40:00.000Z	Choubaka	j4sp	That's how it should work at least.
