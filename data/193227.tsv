2006-07-02T14:54:00.000Z	Gooofy		I am installing UT2004, asking for CD#2, how to unmount/mount
2006-07-02T14:54:00.000Z	lamego	Gooofy	sudo umount cd_path
2006-07-02T15:03:00.000Z	lamego	Gooofy	sudo mount /device /mountpath
2006-07-02T15:06:00.000Z	lamego	Gooofy	that means the cd media you are trying to install does not have a recognized file system type
