2011-07-19T08:23:00.000Z	dstufft		I'm having an issue. Compiz keeps locking up my computer and I have to ctrl alt f4 and kill -9 compiz to get a responsive desktop again (and then I Have to reboot because killing it messes things up majorly)
2011-07-19T08:24:00.000Z	dstufft		it's using 100% cpu when I have to kill it
2011-07-19T08:26:00.000Z	nit-wit	dstufft	how are you confirming that compiz is the problem?
2011-07-19T08:27:00.000Z	dstufft	nit-wit	top shows compiz is using 100% cpu whenever my desktop locks up, and if I kill -9 compiz responsiveness is restored
