2008-08-11T07:49:00.000Z	hwilde	FreshUbuntuNoob	why don't you go search the manufacturer website for tech specs.
2008-08-11T07:53:00.000Z	hwilde	FreshUbuntuNoob	yep
2008-08-11T07:54:00.000Z	FreshUbuntuNoob	hwilde	Well this is odd. The site says that my card supports a max of 20 dBm. Right now it is on 27 dBm as per iwconfig :|
