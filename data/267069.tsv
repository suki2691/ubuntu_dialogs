2006-05-17T09:00:00.000Z	Adyeths		pressing esc will FIX the problem?
2006-05-17T09:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Adyeths	 could boot with the 'nosplash' option and disable the splash screens totally (i think)
2006-05-17T09:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Adyeths	 that would mean uninstalling all the splash related packages and installing the proper ones - woul dbe my guess.
