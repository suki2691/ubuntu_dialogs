2007-12-26T03:14:00.000Z	phrantik		just curious: how do you do that rotating cube thing?  I have the "advanced desktop settings" installed and i have enabled the "desktop cube" but how do you make it actually do it?
2007-12-26T03:14:00.000Z	cdm10	phrantik	you first need to have horizontal virtual size set to more than one
2007-12-26T03:15:00.000Z	cdm10	phrantik	then try the shortcut ctrl-alt-right/left arrow
2007-12-26T03:15:00.000Z	phrantik	cdm10	i must have it set on only1... how do i change that?
