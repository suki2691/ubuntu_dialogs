2007-09-20T08:19:00.000Z	Fluffy-Wuffy		im trying to compile a program for the first time since i cant find it anywhere in a synaptic compatible package and i really need it, i got my terminal to say "myaccountname@computername: ~/Desktop/ProgramName-0.1$" but the "less install" or "./configure" commands wont work, what am i doing wrong?
2007-09-20T08:19:00.000Z	hajhouse	Fluffy-Wuffy	not all programs use ./configure. What is the program you are trying to install?
2007-09-20T08:20:00.000Z	hajhouse	Fluffy-Wuffy	and by doesn't work do you mean ./configure is missing or that it fails when you run it?
2007-09-20T08:20:00.000Z	hajhouse	Fluffy-Wuffy	correct. but you need many programs that are not installed by default to install new software from source
