2012-09-29T01:43:00.000Z	paul_uk		if i installed 11.04 and upgraded to 11.10.  if i do another upgrade to 12.04 and i have apps installed this time, would it screw up the system?

2012-09-29T01:44:00.000Z	paul_uk	jrib	that goes without saying.  but im abroad at the moment and dont have access to anything right now
