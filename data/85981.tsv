2009-04-09T20:12:00.000Z	monostone		hi, I'm looking for a way to rename via commandline a whole directory of files, maintaining partially the name like the following example: image_123_l.jpg -> image_123_m.jpg basically i need to maintain everything except the last letter, how could I apply a regex to the mv or cp commands?
