2008-02-04T04:25:00.000Z	BobboL	gilda	I just put a pci sata/pata card in :)
2008-02-04T04:25:00.000Z	gilda	BobboL	i had some issues with sata on my ubuntu gutsy install i had to append the grub loader with all_generic_ide for it to see my sata drives
2008-02-04T04:32:00.000Z	gilda	BobboL	try changing ur /boot/grub/menu.lst so where it has the kernel line it has   all_generic_ide at the end - then reboot see if that works
