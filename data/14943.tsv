2011-11-16T21:31:00.000Z	barcef	gaurav_sood91	 There is no fix for this? When I boot into windows they mute automatically when I plug in my headphones. In ubuntu they don't. There has to be CONF file somewhere I can edit this behaviour.
2011-11-16T21:32:00.000Z	gaurav_sood91	barcef	i dont know. let me check if there is, cos i did not have to change anything and they automatically get muted
