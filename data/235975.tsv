2005-08-13T06:14:00.000Z	Chaotic_Reality		i have a big problem. :) for some reason my filesystem went to read only, i rebooted and now I can't even boot up, it says grub,error code 17. anyone know what this means? should i just reinstall?
2005-08-13T06:14:00.000Z	morbidi	Chaotic_Reality	check gentoo grub errors :)
2005-08-13T06:16:00.000Z	Chaotic_Reality	morbidi	doesn't help much. i just get put back at a black screen with the error. no ability to modify or look at anything
2005-08-13T06:17:00.000Z	morbidi	Chaotic_Reality	does your hd failed ?
