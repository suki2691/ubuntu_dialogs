2012-07-20T11:33:00.000Z	robertzaccour		I understand this chat is for ubuntu help, just wondering if anyone knows.
2012-07-20T11:34:00.000Z	histo	robertzaccour	you may want to ask the mint people. The reason certain formats don't work is because you don't have codecs installed by default in ubuntu
2012-07-20T11:38:00.000Z	robertzaccour	histo	thanks, but all but 4 of the formats say unsupported this or that
