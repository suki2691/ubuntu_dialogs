2007-10-22T08:13:00.000Z	Kidaf	spiker611	and mindrape: First, Gutsy recognized my IDEs as SCSI, but I don't think that will mess up. Problem is, I can't make Gutsy to mount the NTFS partitions I use for Windows and for data.
2007-10-22T08:14:00.000Z	Kidaf	spiker611	 I have a partitioned HD and an old 6.4 extra HD. Gutsy "finds" the old 6.4, but just wont show the partitions on the main HD.
