2006-03-10T14:51:00.000Z	h0me5k1n		if I add a hard drive to store music... what filesystem should I use (ext3,fat32) if I want to store music on it for all users?
2006-03-10T14:52:00.000Z	LjL	h0me5k1n	are some of the users using windows?
2006-03-10T14:52:00.000Z	LjL	h0me5k1n	then there's nothing wrong with ext3
2006-03-10T14:53:00.000Z	LjL	h0me5k1n	doesn't really matter. /mnt/music would be fine
