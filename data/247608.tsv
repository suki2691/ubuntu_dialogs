2007-02-03T15:54:00.000Z	godtvisken		I installed postresql with apt-get.. Does this create a security risk because I was root? I am reading something that there should be a postres user?
2007-02-03T15:56:00.000Z	godtvisken		Is there a command like `su' but for changing to anther regular user?
2007-02-03T15:57:00.000Z	ompaul	godtvisken	that is su, su - username
2007-02-03T15:57:00.000Z	ompaul	godtvisken	no that is for using root - and that is not the right way to do that
