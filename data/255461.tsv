2005-11-06T06:19:00.000Z	hackersend		how about the speed of the ubuntu?
2005-11-06T06:20:00.000Z	thenuke	hackersend	a bit hard question to answer.
2005-11-06T06:20:00.000Z	thenuke	hackersend	but I guess I can answer to you that it is not slower or faster then the other distros generally
2005-11-06T06:21:00.000Z	thenuke	hackersend	I run ubuntu on p120, p3-500, and amd XP3200+
