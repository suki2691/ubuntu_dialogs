2009-08-01T17:34:00.000Z	Boohbah	eoch	do you get any useful error message running it from a terminal?
2009-08-01T17:35:00.000Z	eoch	Boohbah	 you mean during startup on ongoing while it's running?
2009-08-01T17:36:00.000Z	Boohbah	eoch	i mean when it crashes... but i second ikonia's advice, use the stable version unless you really like debugging
2009-08-01T17:37:00.000Z	eoch	Boohbah	well I was hoping to trouble shoot the issue instead of just roll back, that way it's a learning experience for me.
