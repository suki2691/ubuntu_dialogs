2009-05-09T03:08:00.000Z	drbobb	boaslad	I tried the obvious stuff - using another port, running dosfsck on the flash stick, even reformatting it
2009-05-09T03:09:00.000Z	drbobb	boaslad	I have no nautilus windows open now, and copying to the flash stick is sloooow
2009-05-09T03:10:00.000Z	drbobb	boaslad	actually I'm now using rsync to copy files and not nautilus, but that didn't help much either
