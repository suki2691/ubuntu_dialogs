2006-11-25T11:45:00.000Z	asfalt		hello, am i able to use network-manager-gnome in edgy with WPA wireless connections? the Network Monitor app seems to have no provision. In meantime I edited a wpa_supplicant.conf and /etc/network/interfaces run wpa_supplicant and all works, however it is a major pain to change networks, ie requires edits of two files manually and creating the passphrase and in case of switching to another wpa, wep or open network. there has to be a better way?
