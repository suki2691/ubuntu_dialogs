2006-11-19T08:03:00.000Z	axa-axa	deadlydeathcone	I have Athlon 3000+ and 2GM of RAM.
2006-11-19T08:03:00.000Z	axa-axa	deadlydeathcone	I thought that since KDE is written in pure C++ (not C# or something like that) it would run faster.
2006-11-19T08:05:00.000Z	deadlydeathcone	axa-axa	it's worth a shot, but on a Athlon XP-2200 it didn't seem to make such of a difference
