2009-06-30T22:45:00.000Z	yvan_		whats the policy with firefox by the way? will 3.0 be replaced now that 3.5 is stable in jaunty, or if I want to use it I should stick still try firefox-3.1-branding instead of waiting(though as far as I see this way I'll lose the ability to use the extensions packed in ubuntu and have to install them manually)
2009-06-30T22:46:00.000Z	yvan_		ah ibuclaw might have just answered my question...
2009-06-30T22:46:00.000Z	Dulak	yvan_	I don't think 3.5 will supercede 3.0 in the repos, the packages will remain seperate for jaunty
2009-06-30T22:47:00.000Z	Dulak	yvan_	karmic on the other hand will probably go to 3.5 as default
