2009-10-30T13:03:00.000Z	filgy	Kartagis	first off.. NEVER do a release upgrade via apt-get dist-upgrade
2009-10-30T13:08:00.000Z	filgy	Kartagis	upgrading to a new release via apt-get dist-upgrade has a HIGH chance of breaking your system.. do not try it
2009-10-30T13:09:00.000Z	filgy	Kartagis	you want to upgrade by doing apt-get install update-manager-core running sudo do-release-upgrade
