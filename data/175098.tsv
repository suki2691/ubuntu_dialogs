2009-05-28T14:47:00.000Z	peleg		Hello there. I have a cruzer U3 4GB that worked perfectly so far (half a year or so). Suddenly, in the middle of using it, I can't mount it anymore. It got stuck in the middle of copying (from the usb to my computer), and I had to unmount it, and trying to mount it again fails.

2009-05-28T14:48:00.000Z	peleg		I tried it on a Windows XP machine, there it claims that the drive is "unformatted", and asks if I want to format it now
