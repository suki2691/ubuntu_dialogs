2008-06-23T23:44:00.000Z	joaopinto	mortal1	you should have no need to install java from java.sun.com, you should install the one available from the repositories
2008-06-23T23:45:00.000Z	mortal1	joaopinto	eh azureus and java from the repositories is not stable in my experience
2008-06-23T23:46:00.000Z	joaopinto	mortal1	and make sure you are launching azureus with the "true" java, not the first one found by the azureus launcher script :P
