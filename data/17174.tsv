2011-08-31T08:19:00.000Z	Polah	jules	sudo
2011-08-31T08:21:00.000Z	Polah	jules	sudo rm <file1> <file2> <file3> and so on. If it's write-protected then chances are you shouldn't be deleting it
2011-08-31T08:21:00.000Z	Polah	jules	And the day will come when you install something that requires those icons and you're left with a blank symbol or an error symbol instead
