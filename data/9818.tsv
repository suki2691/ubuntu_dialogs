2011-09-03T14:59:00.000Z	Chrysalid	Sidewinder1	They are on seperate channels, but I guess it is an old board and might be doing something strange with channels. I'll go try changing them a bit.
2011-09-03T15:00:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Chrysalid	Best of luck.
2011-09-03T15:18:00.000Z	Chrysalid	Sidewinder1	Changing the channel settings seems to be working right now. Thank you for the help. Have a good day everyone
