2008-05-05T21:50:00.000Z	PokerWolf		is someone able to help get my head around this partitioning issue so i can get on with installing hardy heron.. im a linux newbie and im sorry for that but i do want to give it a go. i tried a suse distribution but i had some issues with that and i would prefer ubuntu.
2008-05-05T21:50:00.000Z	PokerWolf		i need to over write the suse partitions with ubuntu
2008-05-05T21:51:00.000Z	PokerWolf		if i do it manually what partitions do i need to create for ubuntu
2008-05-05T21:51:00.000Z	ejer	PokerWolf	u could say use existing linux partitions in installer, but will wipe all linux parts
