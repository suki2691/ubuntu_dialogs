2008-10-15T00:45:00.000Z	Trae		Can anyone tell me how to remove all the kde stuff I installed when I tried out Kubuntu?  I'm sure it's great for those who like it.  But I just want default Ubuntu / Gnome stuff.  (my boot-up is still kubuntu too)

2008-10-15T00:46:00.000Z	Trae	Slade605	I did install Ubuntu
2008-10-15T00:47:00.000Z	Trae	Slade605	I, a bit later, tried Kubuntu
