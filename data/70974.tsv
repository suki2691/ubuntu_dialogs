2008-12-21T12:47:00.000Z	SuperCrackMunkey		I have an odd problem. Anyone willing to help? (it involves the install of a custom-ish 7.04)
2008-12-21T12:48:00.000Z	SuperCrackMunkey		lol, because it seems rather busy in here :P Here goes: The installer tells me I don't have a / partition even when I have it set. The first error it gives it just a bunch of question marks.
2008-12-21T12:49:00.000Z	raylu	SuperCrackMunkey	is / marked as being formatted?
2008-12-21T12:55:00.000Z	SuperCrackMunkey	raylu	Yeah, it's set to be formatted. The odd thing is it works just fine in VmWare
