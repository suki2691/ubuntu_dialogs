2009-11-28T07:53:00.000Z	KenBW2		is there any reason not to put swap in an extended partition and expect Hibernate to work?
2009-11-28T07:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KenBW2	Swap on an extended partition should work fine wrt hibernation
2009-11-28T07:55:00.000Z	KenBW2	Jordan_U	should or does?
2009-11-28T07:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KenBW2	I see know reason why it shouldn't but I haven't done it myself ( and hibernation could fail for many other reasons )
