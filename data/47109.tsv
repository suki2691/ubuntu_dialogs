2011-12-20T21:56:00.000Z	llutz_	charles_	you'll have a system without root-access
2011-12-20T21:57:00.000Z	charles_	llutz_	that's bad enough, but that's still the best case scenario. /me wonders if there are worse outcomes though
2011-12-20T21:57:00.000Z	llutz_	charles_	sudo apt-get purge sudo -s                to check what it'll do
