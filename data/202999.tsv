2005-12-28T16:57:00.000Z	xbang		i'm trying to use the livecd version of 5.04 to test sound on my motherboard. however, after I hit enter to boot - it displays some info such as PCI and stuff, and then just goes to a black screen - can anyone help me?
2005-12-28T16:58:00.000Z	ispiked	xbang	my advice: try 5.10.
