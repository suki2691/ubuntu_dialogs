2009-04-22T03:18:00.000Z	elexodus	MarkJones	yes. The easiest way to do what you're looking to do, is burn a live CD on the 23RD (that's when the latest final will be released, and reinstall. The new install will aquire all media from your older install.
2009-04-22T03:19:00.000Z	MarkJones	elexodus	What image will I need? Is there gonna be a 8.04.3 is that what it is? or a final intrepid image?
2009-04-22T03:19:00.000Z	elexodus	MarkJones	it's 9.04. Jaunty.
