2011-11-19T23:47:00.000Z	cryptodira		i have recently moved to ubuntu from OS/2 and OS X which both offer 'mouse cursor wrap around".... (the mouse cursor appears on the opposite edge of the screen when reaching one edge)..... how is this achieved in ubuntu 10.10??
2011-11-19T23:47:00.000Z	Gentoo64	cryptodira	not sure its possible
2011-11-19T23:48:00.000Z	Gentoo64		i could be wrong
2011-11-19T23:49:00.000Z	cryptodira	Gentoo64	I would be suprised if it is not possible.... this is a very handy feature... especially for large monitors.
