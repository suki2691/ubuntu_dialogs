2012-07-26T13:06:00.000Z	BotaniCar|2		i bought a pc with onboard GPU. Is it ok to do initial setup and later add a nother gpu(nvidia). Can both GPU work at same time and serve monitors ?
2012-07-26T13:06:00.000Z	theadmin	BotaniCar|2	Yes (I have 2 GPUs myself), but I have no idea how to switch between them or something.
2012-07-26T13:07:00.000Z	BotaniCar|2	theadmin	so adding 2nd GPU after initial install is not a issue ?
