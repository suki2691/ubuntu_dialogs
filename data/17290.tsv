2011-03-07T04:30:00.000Z	ubuntu_		I need some help guys. I had a windows partition and an ubuntu partition on the same hard drive but I delete the ext4 partition that had grub on it. Now when  choose to boot off that drive I get a grub error. How can get rid of grub for mbr so it goes to normal windows 7 loader? I am running a live version of ubuntu
