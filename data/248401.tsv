2007-09-05T16:00:00.000Z	Asuka4321		I'm trying to download a driver from nvidia so that I can reach 1440x900 on my graphics card. with Ubuntu 7.04, do I select Lunux x86 or linux x64?
2007-09-05T16:01:00.000Z	Asuka4321		i dont think i need to restart my x
2007-09-05T16:03:00.000Z	Asuka4321		nevermind, i think if i actually install ubuntu, it will let me access 1440x900 once it detects my settings, currently i am running off a live cd
