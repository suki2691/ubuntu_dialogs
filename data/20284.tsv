2011-02-04T15:00:00.000Z	bc81	UbuntuNub	the only way to know for sure is to try it out :-)  once booted, you can test @ System >> Administration >> System Testing
2011-02-04T15:03:00.000Z	bc81	UbuntuNub	good luck, and enjoy Ubuntu
2011-02-06T13:08:00.000Z	bc81	UbuntuNub	you mean you want windows to be the default OS in your grub menu?  see StartUpManager https://help.ubuntu.com/community/StartUpManager
