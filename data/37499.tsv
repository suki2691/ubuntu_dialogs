2010-02-10T19:37:00.000Z	h2o0		I've a Core 2 Duo with 4GB of RAM, which version of Ubuntu can be better? Ubuntu 32-bit, Ubuntu 32-bit with PAE or Ubuntu 64-bit?
2010-02-10T19:38:00.000Z	h2o0		what about 32-bit with PAE ?
2010-02-10T19:38:00.000Z	KE1HA	h2o0	any would be good, C2D's I think are 64-Bit, but ya need to verify.
