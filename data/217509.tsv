2005-10-01T10:30:00.000Z	firestor1		How dangerous is it to run Breezy instead of Hoary in your experiences?
2005-10-01T10:31:00.000Z	eyequeue	firestor1	 the closer to the release date (oct 13) the safer, generally
2005-10-01T10:32:00.000Z	firestor1	eyequeue	so on oct 13 it will be considered stable then?
2005-10-01T10:32:00.000Z	eyequeue	firestor1	 that's the current release date, though hoary was a few days late
