2009-04-25T15:58:00.000Z	Axx83		I need this script to be processed at start, when I unplug ac, when I plug it, when I suspend, when I get back from suspension and when I shut down/restart the notebook.
2009-04-25T15:58:00.000Z	Axx83		In Intrepid I putted it in: /etc/pm/power.d AND /etc/pm/sleep.d BUT but it wasn't run in all the cases I needed to, especially from suspend and restart.
