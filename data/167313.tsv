2007-08-19T05:18:00.000Z	nickrud	miles800	it's like a really stripped down shell
2007-08-19T05:18:00.000Z	miles800	nickrud	I know what it is, I am just wondering what its function is in the boot process
2007-08-19T05:19:00.000Z	nickrud	miles800	my bad. I'm not sure, I just liked having it during the install.
