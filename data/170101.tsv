2006-09-12T16:08:00.000Z	Adam		Emacs is still the most convenient shell there is, of course not for running Vim inside it.
2006-09-12T16:08:00.000Z	Flannel	Adam	emacs is an operating system, not a text editor.
2006-09-12T16:09:00.000Z	Adam	Flannel	I don't think the other parts (mail reader, newsgroups, etc.) are still viable nowadays, but the shell definitely rocks.
