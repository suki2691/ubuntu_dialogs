2009-08-12T13:21:00.000Z	nuckle		Hello, can someone please give me a clue as in how to unrar files on ubuntu 9.04 using gnome?
2009-08-12T13:21:00.000Z	jedc	nuckle	can you right click and extract here?
2009-08-12T13:22:00.000Z	nuckle		I downloaded the unrar-free but now I can only view the content of the archive and cannot unpack it...
2009-08-12T13:22:00.000Z	nuckle	jedc	did that, won't unpack
