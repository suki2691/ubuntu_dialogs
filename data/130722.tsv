2008-02-06T19:46:00.000Z	titusg	natbet	why on earth would you want that?
2008-02-06T19:47:00.000Z	natbet	titusg	working with several mp3s that aren't properly named, it works fine with wave files, just not mp3s
2008-02-06T19:49:00.000Z	titusg	natbet	I see. Still sounds weird to me, I'd rather not hear them unless I deliberately play them
