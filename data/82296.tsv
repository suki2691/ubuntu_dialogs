2008-11-13T20:14:00.000Z	akahige		got a question about samba permissions... I had a shared directory on my desktop that is no longer shared, and won't let me as a user re-share it.  I had moved /var onto a different partition, and everything seems to be working, but then I discovered this... can anyone help me troubleshoot...?

2008-11-13T20:15:00.000Z	akahige	spree	thanks.  I'm wondering if there aren't probs with my having copied /var.  thoughts on that?
