2009-02-08T05:52:00.000Z	kazagistar		I installed Jaunty, and I noticed that "System -> Preferences -> Sound" has disappeared... how/where can I find it?
2009-02-08T05:52:00.000Z	rww	kazagistar	Jaunty support is in #ubuntu+1, not here. Thanks :)
2009-02-08T05:52:00.000Z	kazagistar	rww	sorry, thank you!
