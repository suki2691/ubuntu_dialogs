2007-06-01T07:17:00.000Z	ivanneto	sipior	OK, thanks!
2007-06-01T07:17:00.000Z	sipior	ivanneto	or you can count packets with ethereal or the like and compare timing information
2007-06-01T07:18:00.000Z	ivanneto	sipior	I don't have ethereal at the machine. But I'll try through ifconfig, which gives me the number of packets. I wish there was a better way, but it seems that thre isn't.
