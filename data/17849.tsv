2011-05-11T22:53:00.000Z	Camarata		should i update my shell from 10.04 to 11.04, any benefits for a webserver?
2011-05-11T22:54:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Camarata	you'd need to go through 10.10 first
2011-05-11T22:55:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Camarata	since its a server though its probably better to leave it and update to the next lts which would be 12.04
