2008-06-03T14:13:00.000Z	c0Ld		I've got everything set to 100% volume and still my sound isn't nearly as loud as just 10% of the volume I can get with other distros/windows -- any ideas?
2008-06-03T14:14:00.000Z	c0Ld		PCM's 100%
2008-06-03T14:15:00.000Z	Light-	c0Ld	did you turn up teh volume for every mixer?
2008-06-03T14:15:00.000Z	Light-	c0Ld	try using OSS, ALSA, Pulse etc see which one has loudest volume
