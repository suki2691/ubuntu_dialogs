2005-04-25T15:55:00.000Z	bassMonkey		I would like to switch to the k7 kernel from the 386 becouse I can't get all my ram to work, will the nvidia driver work after this and if not what do I need to do?
2005-04-25T12:52:00.000Z	bassMonkey		when I try to open a .rar file I made in winace with archiver it says archive type not supported... The question is why, becouse I have installed rar
2005-04-25T12:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	bassMonkey	 try it from the shell.
2005-04-25T12:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	bassMonkey	 thers also some non-free versions of rar/unrar out that may be newer
