2006-08-17T12:36:00.000Z	harisund		hello everyone! Does anyone know how to stop the gnome-keyring-daemon from starting during Gnome boot? I have looked everywhere (/usr/share/gnome/default.session, /etc/X11/Xsession.options, /etc/xdg/autostart) but nowhere am I able to find what's responsible for autostarting the silly gnome-keyring-daemon
