2011-05-30T03:32:00.000Z	kozup		My dad upgraded to natty and not the computer won't boot and drops to grub. I booted using a liveCD to see if I could reconfigure it, but it looks like there's an LVM? I have no idea what that is there for considering nothing (that i know of) is RAIDed. Anyone have any debugging tips?
