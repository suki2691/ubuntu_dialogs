2007-04-03T06:08:00.000Z	lodxcol		Hi, I was just wondering what command I'd use to change my password via command line
2007-04-03T06:09:00.000Z	lodxcol		So type passwd newpasswdhere ?
2007-04-03T06:09:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	lodxcol	"passwd"
2007-04-03T06:09:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	lodxcol	no, just "passwd" and it will explain what to do :-)
