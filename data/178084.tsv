2008-02-13T04:37:00.000Z	JJBuntu		Wireless LAN help needed: I have a Dell laptop currently running on 6.06 Ubuntu. When going to network settings it sees a wireless LAN card "not active", I activate then type in the name of the router and pass - no connection. The card in my comp is Broadcom BCM4306
