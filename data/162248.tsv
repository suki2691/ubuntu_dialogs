2006-11-01T07:20:00.000Z	Kannix		Is anyone using edgy in the AMD64 version? I am experiencing graphics problems on bootup. The ubuntu-logo is b/w and the throbber is screwed up. Everything is fine once gdm kicks in, though.

2006-11-01T07:22:00.000Z	Kannix	TGPO	And it works fine with the same hardware, using ubuntu x386
2006-11-01T07:23:00.000Z	Kannix	TGPO	Maybe a bug in the frambuffer driver that only shows in 64bit mode?
