2011-10-14T00:03:00.000Z	FrozenFire		Weird question. My laptop has to go in for repairs, and I probably won't have a computer for two or three weeks at best. However, I have a headless server, which I can put a graphics card into, running Ubuntu Server 11.04. Is there a desktop environment that I can install that will support a browser and video player, but won't dick with the operation of the server?
