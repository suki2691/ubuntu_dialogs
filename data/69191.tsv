2009-04-10T16:01:00.000Z	maxagaz		what command line can i use to find a string in all the files of a directory ?
2009-04-10T16:02:00.000Z	oCean_	maxagaz	use grep  "grep <string> *"
2009-04-10T16:03:00.000Z	oCean_	maxagaz	grep -i to make case insensitive and grep -R to do recursive (i.e. including subdirectories)
2009-04-10T16:09:00.000Z	maxagaz	oCean_	clearscreen: thanks
