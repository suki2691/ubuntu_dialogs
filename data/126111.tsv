2009-11-20T02:51:00.000Z	badp		Hello. How can I tell wheter I'm running Ubuntu 32bits or 64bits, and can I switch to the latter without a full reinstall?
2009-11-20T02:52:00.000Z	roboboy	badp	type uname -a
2009-11-20T02:52:00.000Z	roboboy	badp	also I'm pretty sure you could switch out the kernels but then all your binaries might not work, probably best to reinstall
2009-11-20T02:52:00.000Z	roboboy	badp	the i686 part makes me think you aren't running 64 bit, otherwise it would say x86_64
