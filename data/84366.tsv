2011-11-14T03:08:00.000Z	prower		hello :> i've noticed this problem in both 11.04 and 11.10, i've been trying to find a bug on launchpad but so far i've been unsuccessful...basically, 1) insert a usb key, 2) try to copy data to and from it, 3) either a kernel panic occurs or the transfer fails and you need to reboot to get usb functionality back :<
2011-11-14T03:10:00.000Z	szal	prower	no such problem here; probably a hardware defect (USB stick and/or port)
2011-11-14T03:12:00.000Z	prower	szal	possibly, yes...i've tried two different sticks on all the different ports with no luck though...in addition to that the "safely remove" option for USB storage causes a kernel panic when you use it :< that bug is on launchpad, a fixed kernel is in -proposed but who knows when that will be out
2011-11-14T03:14:00.000Z	szal	prower	so far I had no unsolvable problem w/ my removable USB media..  had an SD card that is probably fried, transfer was slow and error-prone..  other card and all my USB sticks (as far as I have tried them yet) show no problems, neither w/ automounting, nor w/ transfer, nor w/ safely removing
