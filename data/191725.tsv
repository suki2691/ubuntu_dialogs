2007-10-07T13:54:00.000Z	baver		Is there a 32-bit package of X that I can install on a 64-bit ubuntu?
2007-10-07T13:54:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	baver	nope.
2007-10-07T13:54:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	baver	you'd have to compile it, but not really needed.
2007-10-07T13:55:00.000Z	baver	fyrestrtr	ok, thanks. I have a commercial app that is complaining about libXext.so.6 missing ... I'm guessing it wants a 32-bit version, since I have the 64-bit version.
