2009-07-08T05:00:00.000Z	tristanmike		I'm trying to dual boot Linux and XP. I've installed XP first on an IDE drive (sdb) and I've installed Ubuntu on the SATA (sda). Installation for both went fine, but upon boot, selecting the XP option yeilds the following "Starting up..." then the screen blinks (as it's handing it off) then it stays at a "black" screen and does nothing. I must power the computer off/on. Any ideas ? Here's my menu.lst http://paste.ubuntu.com/
