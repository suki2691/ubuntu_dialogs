2005-01-26T17:30:00.000Z	Ileden		Hi! I'm still a bit confused about package management system and installing software. If I install a program not in the package management system (like Opera), does it appear on the installed packages after install?
2005-01-26T17:30:00.000Z	Ileden		If not, where does it appear, and how do I unistall it if required? Or is it possible to install external programs through the package managemet system?
