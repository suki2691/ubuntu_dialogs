2008-02-29T00:29:00.000Z	SpudDogg	WGGMk	 good question...if you get that resolved soon, let me know the answer.  my guess is you'll need a cross connect though
2008-02-29T00:29:00.000Z	WGGMk	SpudDogg	asking out of curiosity or you have a similar issue?
2008-02-29T00:29:00.000Z	SpudDogg	WGGMk	 just curious
2008-02-29T00:30:00.000Z	WGGMk	SpudDogg	my first thought was the ethernet card was bad, but it was recognized by the install of the server handling the DMZ. I have the DMZ set to push to a static IP and it answers ping's locally (on the same server) but can't get anyway except loopback on the Ubuntu server
