2006-09-08T10:41:00.000Z	bill__		I have a question about partitions. I have some free space on my harddrive and would like to setup a dual boot with another linux distro. can I use the same swap partition for both ubuntu and the other distro? or do they both need their own swaps?

2006-09-08T10:41:00.000Z	Spec	bill__	same swap
2006-09-08T10:41:00.000Z	Spec	bill__	unless you hibernate, because that'll save your ram into your swap
