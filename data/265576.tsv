2009-04-26T10:48:00.000Z	Carrie_		Are there any pre-installed IM clients other than pidgin? or, any packages readily available?  for AIM specifically...
2009-04-26T10:48:00.000Z	calc	Carrie_	no, pidgin does them all
2009-04-26T10:48:00.000Z	calc	Carrie_	you can install other ones if you want to use something else
2009-04-26T10:53:00.000Z	calc	Carrie_	same with linux but not nearly as bad just your $HOME has dot files ;-)
