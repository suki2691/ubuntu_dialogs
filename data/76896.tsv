2008-12-01T01:05:00.000Z	Fougner	\Kira	aha, why vnc into a server? a server is supposed to run CLI only ;)
2008-12-01T01:05:00.000Z	\Kira	Fougner	CLI? I have had a increadible ammount of difficultly setting up certian things remotely, like CUPS and such (wich are made to be set up locally and need a GUI to do that)
