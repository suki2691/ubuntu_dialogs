2008-04-22T03:28:00.000Z	vad		why do i need to restart after i enable the ati proprietary driver?
2008-04-22T03:28:00.000Z	Starnestommy	vad	because it loads a kernel module on the next boot and loading that module while running may cause problems
2008-04-22T03:34:00.000Z	vad	Starnestommy	is there a way that i do it without a restart?
2008-04-22T03:35:00.000Z	Starnestommy	vad	I don't think so.  Is there any particular reason why you need to avoid a restart?
