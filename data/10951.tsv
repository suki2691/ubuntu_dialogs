2011-09-12T05:20:00.000Z	JoFo		Hello. I’ve tried to make a boot USB flash drive with Ubuntu Lucid (the last LTS) 32 bits. When I try to boot on the USB flash drive, on two different computers, I get the message “vesamenu.c32: not a COM32R image”. Is that a deficiency of the flash drive which I should replace or did I forget something important?

2011-09-12T05:29:00.000Z	urlin2u	JoFo	unfortunately I can't read French.
