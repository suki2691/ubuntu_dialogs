2008-01-17T04:42:00.000Z	Shpook	OmegaCent1	Not sure, I know there was a fix to keep the HDD from staying spooled though.
2008-01-17T04:43:00.000Z	Shpook	OmegaCent1	That's right, it was the mounting problem, not spooling. :-)
2008-01-17T04:45:00.000Z	OmegaCent1	Shpook	looks like it is a load/unload cycles problem, checking it out now though
