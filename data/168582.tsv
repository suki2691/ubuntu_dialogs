2009-12-13T09:17:00.000Z	scunizi	Newbie-Widget	there were a lot of fixes and upgrades with the .1 version
2009-12-13T09:18:00.000Z	scunizi	Newbie-Widget	which brings to mind.. if you install that don't up grade to 10.04 LTS until it's 10.04.1
2009-12-13T09:35:00.000Z	scunizi	Newbie-Widget	8.04 will be end of life next year.. so will 9.04.. whichever you want.. but you'll be forced into an upgrade next year for security updates regardless.
