2006-05-14T16:23:00.000Z	Drac|Win		libglib2.0-0 is installed on my system, but this configure script complains that there is no "glib-2.0" package on my system. It's a very new configure script, and should be up to date. What gives?
2006-05-14T16:24:00.000Z	soundray	Drac|Win	install libglib2.0-dev
2006-05-14T16:25:00.000Z	Drac|Win	soundray	Yeah. Figured that out, but thanks. :)
2006-05-14T16:26:00.000Z	soundray	Drac|Win	you still get that error?
