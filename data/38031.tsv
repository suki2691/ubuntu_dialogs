2010-11-11T17:18:00.000Z	littlegirl		Well, I recently switched from Kubuntu Hardy Heron to Ubuntu Lucid Lynx andlike an idiot, I allowed Ubuntu to just create one big partition. I suspect that the ridiculous delays when loading large text files and when using the keyboard to scroll through long lines of text could be swap related. The symptoms don't happen when I load up the same file using the live CD. Any ideas?
