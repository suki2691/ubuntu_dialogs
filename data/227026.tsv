2010-06-12T21:41:00.000Z	Zela		I want to delete Unreal3.2.1.8.tar.gz can anyone tell me how to remove it? I used rm but I think it just removed it from the folder.

2010-06-12T21:44:00.000Z	funkyHat	Zela	rm is delete. removing it from a folder is the same as deleting, it doesn't go somewhere else ‚¢Å)
