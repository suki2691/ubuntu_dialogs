2011-04-19T18:43:00.000Z	jdu		hello. I would like to install a 32 bit-only plugin for libreoffice that requires java onto a 64 bit ubuntu system. Forcing the 32 architecture during the installation of libreoffice led to crashes.
2011-04-19T18:43:00.000Z	jdu		Any advice on how I could get 32 bit openoffice or libreoffice running on a 64bit system?

2011-04-19T18:45:00.000Z	jdu	mynameistux	there seem to be other 32 bit prequesites
