2008-10-04T16:21:00.000Z	tellerium		i am currently using PCLinuxOS and if i create a new partition, can i install ubuntu and keep my existing /home and swap paritions and use them in both distros?
2008-10-04T16:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	tellerium	well shouldn't be major problems using the same home partition on both distros if the usernames (ang uid and gid do not colide)
2008-10-04T16:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	tellerium	you will have to be extra carefull though
