2008-11-12T11:50:00.000Z	potissimus		Hopefully someone can help me out.  I am in a live session right now trying to copy some files on a mounted local disk across the network to another computer.  However, it is complaining about permissions, justifiably.  How to I go about inputting my login details for a local disk through a live session?
2008-11-12T11:50:00.000Z	matthudson	potissimus	sudo cp?

2008-11-12T11:52:00.000Z	potissimus	matthudson	i can use sudo, but that gives me root permissions for the live session.  I need my root permissions or user permissions from my local disk.
