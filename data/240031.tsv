2006-03-18T06:21:00.000Z	nickrud	Nubuntu	nah, you're limited to the 386 kernel on a live cd
2006-03-18T06:22:00.000Z	nickrud	Nubuntu	yes. Not that you need anything better to run everything
2006-03-18T06:23:00.000Z	nickrud	Nubuntu	um, that last one was a pretty expansive statement, but I do think it's true
