2009-12-29T23:08:00.000Z	InsomniaCity		Hi! Compiz seems to have stopped working - I've lost all my effects and so on. Are there any logs I can look at?
2009-12-29T23:10:00.000Z	mka	InsomniaCity	there was something like compiz-check back in the day, google for it
2009-12-29T23:10:00.000Z	mka	InsomniaCity	otherwise type "compiz --replace" on terminal and check the messages that come out
2009-12-29T23:11:00.000Z	InsomniaCity	mka	hmm, ta for that. It was turned off in the Appearance applet, but that wasn't me. I'll take a look at those if it happens again.
