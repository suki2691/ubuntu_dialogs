2005-05-01T10:43:00.000Z	darkaudit	Burgundavia	it took a bit of hollering for 2.8 to get moved to Sarge... it was sitting in experimental for a couple months before it finally moved
2005-05-21T09:02:00.000Z	Burgundavia	darkaudit	see my comment above about backporting security fixes
2005-05-21T09:03:00.000Z	Burgundavia	darkaudit	the .4 stuff hasn't been backported yet
