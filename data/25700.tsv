2010-12-29T07:52:00.000Z	aerolite		Is anyone able to help me with a free disk space issue? I downloaded around 10GB of data onto a drive overnight last night, and I transferred it to another computer today and then deleted it, but the space does not seem to have been reclaimed. And I've searched for 'trash' folders and have found none
2010-12-29T07:53:00.000Z	aerolite		I have also run du on the drive to find out the amount of space the contents occupies, and it returned 1325701944, but when I run df it says I have used 1335751040
2010-12-29T07:53:00.000Z	aerolite		so there is roughly a 10GB discrepancy
2010-12-29T07:54:00.000Z	vectory	aerolite	there are trash folders
