2009-06-30T01:49:00.000Z	anon__		Why is it possible to use drivers for my ATI Radeon 9550 on Ubuntu 8.xx, but not on 9.04?
2009-06-30T01:50:00.000Z	joaopinto	anon__	because AMD/ATI removed supported for older models
2009-06-30T01:52:00.000Z	joaopinto	anon__	I don't think so, the oldests drivers will not work with the current Xorg
2009-06-30T01:52:00.000Z	anon__	joaopinto	alright, thanks for the info.
