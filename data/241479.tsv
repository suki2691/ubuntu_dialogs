2010-10-17T06:04:00.000Z	dijonyummy		the problem with /home is its linux only, so i'll make a medium size /home, and a larger data partition both windows and linux can access, how does that sound
2010-10-17T06:06:00.000Z	dijonyummy		what is i make my /home partition ntfs? then windows can also see it? is that a good idea?
