2007-03-15T15:19:00.000Z	StoneNote	bcochofel	are you using firefox?
2007-03-15T15:19:00.000Z	bcochofel	StoneNote	yes, but what has firefox to do with apache config?
2007-03-15T15:21:00.000Z	StoneNote	bcochofel	the long answer is: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/content-negotiation.html  the short answer is type "about:config" on a firefpx address bar and then "langauge" in  the filter and see if your firefox is set up to negotiate an ENGLISH session with apache web servers
