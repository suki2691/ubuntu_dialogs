2006-11-16T07:42:00.000Z	CarinArr		can i put an alias for an ip address to save me from remembering it all the time?
2006-11-16T07:43:00.000Z	Crankymonky	CarinArr	dns servers--dyndns.org
2006-11-16T07:44:00.000Z	CarinArr	Crankymonky	well it's a static ip, i can bind a dns to it, but i more meant just add an alias so whenever i'm using a terminal i can use an alias instead of the ip address
2006-11-16T07:45:00.000Z	Crankymonky	CarinArr	you mean on the machine it's on?  I'm not sure how to do that><
