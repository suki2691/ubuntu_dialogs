2010-02-28T16:14:00.000Z	linuxpjc780		I have a question - is it hard to do a fresh install of Ubuntu 9.10?  I have my computer dual-booted with Linux and Windows (i.e. drive is partitioned)?  Can I simply re-install Ubuntu 9.10 fresh on the current partition it sits on?
2010-02-28T16:14:00.000Z	linuxpjc780		I think I might have gotten a virus or two.

2010-02-28T16:17:00.000Z	linuxpjc780	apparle	- I don't know.  I'm running "Virus Scanner" (the ClamTk app) on the IBM_Preload.  It's only 10 percent done - and it's already telling me it's found 8 viruses.  Is this BS?
