2009-10-30T06:51:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	zatlite	best performance comes from ext4 filesystems created from nothing - ext3 upgraded to ext4 is 2nd best
2009-10-30T06:52:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	zatlite	faster boot is a product of both using ext4 (which, even in jaunty, made a big difference) and using upstart (new in karmic)
