2006-09-03T11:47:00.000Z	calistos_28		Hi, I'm  running a Ubuntu 6.06 distro on a AMD64 processor. Whenever I try to watch some Youtube Videos I get a white screen where the video would be supposed to be played.
2006-09-03T11:47:00.000Z	calistos_28		any idea about how could i see the youtube videos?

2006-09-03T11:50:00.000Z	calistos_28	cherubiel	but the macromedia flash plugin doesn't work for AMD64
