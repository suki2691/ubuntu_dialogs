2007-12-13T08:05:00.000Z	sky_		hi. I have a problem where apt-get says something failed to install, but when i run apt-get install again, it says it's already installed
2007-12-13T08:06:00.000Z	sky_		thanks zenrium. I suspect there are other packages with similar problems.  Is there a command to check the entire pkg db?
2007-12-13T08:08:00.000Z	sky_		that's ok. thanks.  Actually i'm just trying to apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree. I tried it twice but it complains of md5sum mismatch after downloading. anyone have similar problems?
