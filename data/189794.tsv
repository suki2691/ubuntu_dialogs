2006-05-02T07:22:00.000Z	MrProper__	konfuzed	 how do you mean an incremental update?
2006-05-02T07:24:00.000Z	konfuzed	MrProper__	I dont recall the option but once you have a tar file you can tell tar to do it again but dont bother if the file hasnt cahnged
2006-05-02T07:41:00.000Z	MrProper__	konfuzed	i know the update option but what is the one to tell me what its going to do without performing it (like a pretend option)
