2007-11-29T09:07:00.000Z	macogw	adam__	because that's what it's supposed to do.  it's supposed to make the restricted ubuntu one be the only one in use.  disable it if you dont want it
2007-11-29T09:08:00.000Z	macogw	adam__	you mean when you enable the restricted driver, the one you installed gets disabled, right?
2007-11-29T09:09:00.000Z	macogw	adam__	enabling restricted disables all other drivers for that part.  you can only use 1 driver at a time.  it's either the one you compiled or the one it offers
