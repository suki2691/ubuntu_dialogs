2012-07-11T19:46:00.000Z	rocki34	BarkingFish	What? Why not?
2012-07-11T19:47:00.000Z	rocki34	BarkingFish	So I need to install a different distro if I want to use it?
2012-07-11T19:48:00.000Z	BarkingFish	rocki34	there are distros which include it, such as backtrack, but we don't support that either.
