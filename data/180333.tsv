2009-09-08T12:19:00.000Z	vikas	fredl	you need to find the link for that video in source page and use 'wget <filename> to pull that file
2009-09-08T12:20:00.000Z	vikas	fredl	i cannot see such link, javascript is used, so i guess there is no easy way for that
2009-09-08T12:20:00.000Z	fredl	vikas	- tried that but can't find which is the source.
