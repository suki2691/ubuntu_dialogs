2011-04-24T17:00:00.000Z	_Twystd350_		hey guys. Bit of a long shot but I have this program called navifirm, it's for finding firmware for nokia phones. and for the life of me I can't get it running in Wine though I know it has been done. Anyone got any ideas how to at least get the program open?

2011-04-24T17:02:00.000Z	_Twystd350_		Ahwell. I'll just wait till I build my misses' comp to get new firmware since she wants XP. I refuse to dual boot :P
