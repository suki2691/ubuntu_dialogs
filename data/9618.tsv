2011-10-18T10:28:00.000Z	OnkelTem		Hi. How to remove left panel in Unity?
2011-10-18T10:28:00.000Z	OnkelTem		or place it on top
2011-10-18T10:28:00.000Z	Viking667	OnkelTem	I don't think you can. That's the dock, and doesn't seem to be removable
2011-10-18T10:28:00.000Z	OnkelTem	Viking667	so now we have no option in 11.10 to get top gnome panel back?
