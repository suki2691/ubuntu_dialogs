2009-01-06T07:18:00.000Z	Bogaurd		is there an issue with feisty repo's atm? I don't seem to able able to do and apt-get update no matter what sources I use...
2009-01-06T07:20:00.000Z	Bogaurd		I will do an upgrade, it's just a question of preparing a replacement machine, can't really have any downtime on the machine running feisty currently, it's a router :)

2009-01-06T07:23:00.000Z	Bogaurd	omarco_pizza	Flannel, I usually use LTS on most of the machines i manage, but from memory i used feisty on this box because of a requirement I had which the LTS at the time didnt meet :)
