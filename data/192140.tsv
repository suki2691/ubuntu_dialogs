2006-04-21T08:00:00.000Z	naxxtor		i have a new interesting problem! yesterday I added the CPU scaling applet to the gnome taskbar - and it worked, it scaled according to demand and everything - but when i boot up today it says "CPU scaling is not suppoorted" and sticks to 100%

2006-04-21T08:02:00.000Z	naxxtor	saik0	ok, it works now ... so how come that didn't work when i started it up?
