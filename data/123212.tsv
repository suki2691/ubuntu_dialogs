2009-04-20T10:11:00.000Z	solid_liq	RandomUsr	aptitude install win32codecs    perhaps?
2009-04-20T10:14:00.000Z	RandomUsr	solid_liq	thanks for the try. it almost worked
2009-04-20T10:15:00.000Z	solid_liq	RandomUsr	google for  "ubuntu multimedia"  then...  there are plenty of step-by-step howto's out there which tell you how to install all codecs and everything
