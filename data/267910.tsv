2005-03-12T14:33:00.000Z	welly		Hello all.. just a quick question regarding open source, if someone has a minute and doesn't mind an off topic question! someone is making the argument that making the source code available for software, browsers for example, makes it open to security risks.. i kind of understand the argument against but can't quite put it into words
2005-03-12T14:34:00.000Z	crimsun	welly	are you looking at the pros or the cons of having the source freely and publicly available?
2005-03-12T14:35:00.000Z	crimsun	welly	as johnnybezak and Zanz-2 have both stated, having the source available corresponds to security-savvy open source programmers patching the vulnerabilities much faster
2005-03-12T14:38:00.000Z	crimsun	welly	well, to be pedantic toward the guy with whom you're conversing, firefox relies on external (system) libssl
