2011-05-14T20:52:00.000Z	Shwaiil		Q: this is happening lots of times. I finished installing a app trough ubuntu software center and the app doesnt show up on Applications menu. Not even in menu options (sometimes I just go there and find new apps, but no in this case). The App is called VIM. Is there something I can do ? Thakns
