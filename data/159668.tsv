2010-02-13T07:38:00.000Z	hipitihop		my bluetooth mouse and/or keyboard keeps timing out when not in use and I have to repair via 'sudo hidd --search' .. driving me nuts, can someone help
2010-02-13T07:40:00.000Z	thechris	hipitihop	so far i've had good luck with just pressing random keys for a while until it wakes back up.  it can take a while
2010-02-13T07:42:00.000Z	hipitihop	thechris	yes but frequnelty it does not and other times the the device flashes the pairing leds... surely ther eis a way to disable the timeout
2010-02-13T07:42:00.000Z	thechris	hipitihop	thus far i haven't been able to find a way to disable the timeout for my keyboard
