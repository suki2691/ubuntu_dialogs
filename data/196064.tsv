2006-06-15T05:41:00.000Z	userone		which channel for the newbie questions? I just want to know how to back up my evolution emails?
2006-06-15T05:41:00.000Z	delire	userone	good question, re backing up mail. i don't know whether it's automatic.
2006-06-15T05:42:00.000Z	delire	userone	i would back them up manually regardless. you might want to ask in #evolution to be sure (if that channel still exists).
