2005-04-29T13:25:00.000Z	bourrin		someone knows how to repare some broken packages ?
2005-04-29T13:26:00.000Z	dcooper	bourrin	in synaptic there is a filter for broken packages and a choice to repair
2005-04-29T13:28:00.000Z	bourrin	dcooper	yes but it doesn't work because it says that in "coreutils" i have an empty file
