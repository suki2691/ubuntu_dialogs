2007-10-03T13:32:00.000Z	ogenewbie		Jussie I was never trying to add a repository and I dont know what a repository is. I want to download and instal xchat because (I thought) it is a simple but better than lostirc irc program. I like mirc - you know, I just wanted to be able to open a pm window by myself and not have to type /msg juss01 is this the newbie channel or the confusion zone
