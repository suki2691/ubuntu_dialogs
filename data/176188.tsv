2006-11-16T16:58:00.000Z	azcazandco		I currently have 1 x70gb sata drive & 1 x 200gb sata drive (with my os on it), I have 3 x 250gb IDE drives I want to install but by my understanding, if I put an OS on one of them the ide will boot before my sata drive, I want to install edgy eft 64bit as my main OS and have a win xp partition for playing my old games etc, can anyone advise me on the best way to go about doing this without screwing up my system and loosing all my sata stu

2006-11-16T16:59:00.000Z	azcazandco	cafuego	but do I not need to install xp first, followed by edgy on one of my ide drives?  I kinda want to do a clean install of edgy if I can without screwing everything up
2006-11-16T17:04:00.000Z	azcazandco	cafuego	is it possible to install windows on a separate drive *after* installing edgy eft?
