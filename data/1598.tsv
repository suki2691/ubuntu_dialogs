2012-08-12T19:19:00.000Z	royphelps		I have a question.  When I take a photo/ video, on my iphone, and the pictures are uploaded to Photo cloud in Ubuntu one.  However, when I try to put a photo on ebay, it flips it for some reason.  Also when I view my video on my system, it is upside down.  Any fixes?
