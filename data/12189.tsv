2011-11-25T03:55:00.000Z	irule	zykotick9	it is 10, should it be 1?  ..still, if it is 10, why is it acting like 0?
2011-11-25T03:55:00.000Z	zykotick9	irule	10 would be fine.  Why it's behaving like 0 i have no idea.
2011-11-25T03:56:00.000Z	irule	zykotick9	btw I just TESTED 0 and it started right away as I wanted, no waiting for imput :s whazap/fyi :s
