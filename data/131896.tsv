2007-06-09T09:15:00.000Z	slackmagic	non|linear	virtualized as in vmware?
2007-06-09T09:16:00.000Z	non|linear	slackmagic	sure, or virtualbox or crossover or parallels, only tried virtual box seamless, but it's so slow to open 'networked' drives
2007-06-09T09:17:00.000Z	slackmagic	non|linear	yes it should be no problem, I for example transfer my files via ssh (winscp) from vmware winxp to my slackware gnu/linux distro
