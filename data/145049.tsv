2011-01-18T22:18:00.000Z	Julia_23		QUESTION: Is it a smart idea to have a dedicated GRUB partition if you plan to dual boot windows and ubuntu?
2011-01-18T22:20:00.000Z	Julia_23		Dr:  nice. Will a grub partition avoid the problem of windows copying over my grub loader?
2011-01-18T22:20:00.000Z	Julia_23		if I want to say, reinstall windows 7
