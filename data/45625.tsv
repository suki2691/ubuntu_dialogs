2010-10-03T16:34:00.000Z	c3l	kaddi	setting GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true could be nice too, as it changes the default depending on your last choice in the menu. also in the /etc/default/grub file
2010-10-03T16:35:00.000Z	kaddi	c3l	I am not getting to the menu anymore.. I go directly to grub rescue.. I asked in grub and they advised me to just reinstall grub
2010-10-03T16:35:00.000Z	c3l	kaddi	oh, sorry I must have misunderstood
