2007-07-25T16:52:00.000Z	needhelp		Hi, Help needed! I have installed WinXP and then just recently Ubuntu 704. Now trying to setup dualboot with grub. I have this partitionlayout: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/31169/ . Ubuntu loads fine, but I have not found a way to make Grub load Windows. How do I make Windows load from Grub ?
