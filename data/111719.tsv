2009-10-06T00:38:00.000Z	Sala		as i dont have any clues left (i binged) and forums only seem to adress issuses with beta of windows 7 im kinda worried if wubi is working at all on x64 bit system. maybe someone can just share menu.lst file for 9.10 wubi installation of ubuntu?
2009-10-06T00:38:00.000Z	Sala		Help! I have a wubi problem. Have run both 9.04 and 9.10 installations, both fail at the same part. Im missing menu.ltr file in boot folder. As result im not able to boot to ubuntu (i can see ubuntu in windows bootloader) as it stops either on grub (9.10) or on some other console (9-04). Any ideas? Running Windows 7, have tried Vista compactability mode. Also note that installation itself...
2009-10-06T00:38:00.000Z	Sala		...completes with no error. Im also running x64 bit system.
