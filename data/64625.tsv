2011-06-05T02:51:00.000Z	Terabyte		i'm running the "ubuntu installer for windows" on an intel atom 330 box, and for its decision on which iso to download, it's decided to download amd64.iso. Is this normal?
2011-06-05T02:53:00.000Z	Terabyte		ok thanks

2011-06-29T02:39:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Terabyte	yes
