2012-02-10T04:21:00.000Z	jschall		where can I reliably find a deb package of the latest nvidia beta (currently 295.17)? I tried just downloading the deb from xorg-edgers, but it has dependencies within xorg-edgers and I do not want to run an unstable version of X. any help?
2012-02-10T04:23:00.000Z	jschall		they're most definitely not going back to gnome 2

2012-02-10T04:25:00.000Z	jschall	mgaunard_	would rather use the package because installing nvidia drivers myself breaks things badly if i want to go back. i've ended up with many a hosed box that way.
