2012-10-29T10:48:00.000Z	nikolam		do you think it is safe to use ubuntu with BTRFS file system as root? And do upgrades between non-LTS releases with it?
2012-10-29T10:48:00.000Z	nikolam		Also what do you think with using ZFS as root for Ubuntu
2012-10-29T10:48:00.000Z	xangua	nikolam	it is safe to use ext4
2012-10-29T10:49:00.000Z	nikolam	xangua	But I think snapshots are a killer feature. And I already got used on ZFS
