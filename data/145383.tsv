2007-02-18T06:40:00.000Z	CRHZ		Hi all. I am new to Ubuntu and I need to set up a VPN connection to an ISAKMP server. What is a good VPN client to use (supports IPSec IKE hopefully has easy to use GUI - supports certificates either .key/.crt or .p12 etc) -- anyone?
2007-02-18T06:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak_	CRHZ	there's a couple VPN clients in the repos, try them, sorry i don't know which is better,
2007-02-18T06:42:00.000Z	CRHZ	IndyGunFreak	How do I learn their names? I am very new to Ubuntu - is there a place I go to see them?
