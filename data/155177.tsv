2007-02-10T15:46:00.000Z	adaptr	profoX`	no reason it's the "best choice", but it's simply the default... install xine, vlc, mplayer, whatever you want
2007-02-10T15:47:00.000Z	adaptr	profoX`	get rid of the delusion that "default" == "best choice"...
2007-02-10T15:49:00.000Z	adaptr	profoX`	that's just stupid - there are a lot of players to choose from, who would decide what is "best" ?
