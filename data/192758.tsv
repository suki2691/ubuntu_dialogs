2006-03-29T08:26:00.000Z	Serpente		I'm going to be setting up an intranet server and am trying to decide between ubuntu, centos, fedora and gentoo.. right now I'm leaning toward fedora just because I have more experience with redhat style systems

2006-03-29T08:29:00.000Z	danf_1979	Serpente	I really would recommend you an apt based system
2006-03-29T08:31:00.000Z	danf_1979	Serpente	yes you can
