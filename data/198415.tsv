2009-11-26T10:07:00.000Z	Naex		Hello all, I had a quick question about ubuntu (specifically network remix): I used to use Archlinux but I accidently destroyed it and don't want to reset it, can ubuntu be used just text-based and only load up graphical programs like firefox?

2009-11-26T10:08:00.000Z	cablop	Naex	then the same thing pdragon_ asked
2009-11-26T10:08:00.000Z	cablop	Naex	install a server version or install a full ubuntu and disable GDM service
