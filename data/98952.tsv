2009-06-22T20:13:00.000Z	satch5150		I just downgraded from gcc-4.3 to gcc-4.2 now because of a problem i was having compiling util_linux2.12r on ubuntu server (jaunty) - now when I run the configure script for util_linux its telling I don't have any of the required headers or functions, such as inet_aton, fsync, lchown, etc. = what can I do ?
2009-06-22T20:14:00.000Z	legend2440	satch5150	have you tried channel    #gcc?
