2010-10-01T23:23:00.000Z	Friar		I am going to do a fresh install with the 10.10 release candidate. Is there a problem if I use: sudo cp -R /home /media/'My Passport'   to backup my home directories and then put them back once the upgrade is done? Might I have permissions issues? or problems with incompatible config files?

2010-10-01T23:26:00.000Z	Friar	AndrewMC	thanks. I have pretty small home partitions though....I have an SSD so all my media is on external drives anyways.
