2005-08-26T14:27:00.000Z	__Lamont__		Can anyone tell me how to stop Xwindows without changing the runlevel? I need to install newer nvidia drivers

2005-08-26T14:32:00.000Z	__Lamont__	nickrud	thx. Says gdm is already running, but I messed with GDM already trying. doing a shutdown -r and will try that again
