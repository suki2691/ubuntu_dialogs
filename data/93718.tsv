2009-05-23T07:11:00.000Z	Frijolie		whenever I'm downloading a torrent my other web traffic comes to a complete hault (dial-up speed)
2009-05-23T07:11:00.000Z	Frijolie		any idea what would cause that? torrents suck up all bandwidth...
2009-05-23T07:11:00.000Z	darthanubis	Frijolie	a great torrent connection?
2009-05-23T07:12:00.000Z	Frijolie	darthanubis	yeah it's pretty "healthy"
