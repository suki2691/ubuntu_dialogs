2008-11-19T01:35:00.000Z	sambagirl		just out of curisosity is there much of a difference with the 64 bit version and 32 ver? if you are using 32 bit applications (if that is true in linux or not i am not sure).
2008-11-19T01:37:00.000Z	sambagirl		another question is this. i bought this cable to use a laptop as a console to a sun 240 enterprise server that i never got to login to, but cant i use a laptop as a console for the linux 1u server? i have a thinkpad here. i know i cant use my macbook because it doesnt have any video ports like that.
