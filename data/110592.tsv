2007-12-21T02:26:00.000Z	white_eagle		hello, is there any way to continue the broken downloads in ubuntu, especially those made with the terminal (2-3 times when I try to download KDE the connection brakes and I have to redownload again and it again fails and besides that I have problems with my ISP and the downloads go by 2-3 KB/s)
2007-12-21T02:27:00.000Z	mneptok	white_eagle	use a torrent
