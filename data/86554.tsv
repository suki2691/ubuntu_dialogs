2008-07-03T03:28:00.000Z	sdtr443w		I'm upgrading from 7.10 to 8.04 and I got some scary error messages.
2008-07-03T03:28:00.000Z	sdtr443w		Particularly, it claims it couldn't install linux-image-2.6.24-19-generic-2.6.24-19.34_amd64.deb
2008-07-03T03:29:00.000Z	sdtr443w		Gees why does the help site have "(recommended)" on the live upgrade instructions then?
2008-07-03T03:29:00.000Z	xel_	sdtr443w	Cause they would like the upgrade to work all the time
