2011-09-29T00:17:00.000Z	sven_		hi! i just booted my well working 11.4, 64bit, lvm2-root-on-sda5 system with a system that is basically the same just 32bit and sdb.... how can i access my lvm partitions?
2011-09-29T00:17:00.000Z	tomodachi	sven_	does the decies pop up if you type lvdisplay
2011-09-29T00:18:00.000Z	sven_	tomodachi	nope, just my usbsticks (sdb) devices :/
2011-09-29T00:20:00.000Z	sven_	tomodachi	just to mention, my sda still works fine, i can boot it etc. just need to access some data (need 32bit for that)
