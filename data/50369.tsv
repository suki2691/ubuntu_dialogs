2010-06-21T01:04:00.000Z	kaziem		hi, could someone help me setting up a vpn server on my lucid? Like, point me to some documentation resource
2010-06-21T01:04:00.000Z	kaziem		i know i have to give the vpn client an IP range
2010-06-21T01:05:00.000Z	kaziem		should it be the same IP range as the private subnet of the server?
2010-06-21T01:05:00.000Z	arand_	kaziem	I'm not sure if that is of any help though...
