2005-06-29T08:39:00.000Z	ninwa		How do I add "backports" (backports.ubuntu.org) to my repository list. I need to download mono 1.1.6+ and the normal repositories do not contain this, and the documentation said for ubuntu users to use the aforementioned backport site. Do I browse it and download the .deb files, or is there a way to add this to my repository list?
