2011-07-10T17:01:00.000Z	SpamapS	babu	gcj compiles java into machine code, open jdk uses a traditional jvm
2011-07-10T17:02:00.000Z	SpamapS	babu	it isn't a jvm, its a runtime.. sort of like Objective C
2011-07-10T17:03:00.000Z	SpamapS	babu	the "runtime" is just a set of library calls that run as native code. A JVM is a virtual machine.
