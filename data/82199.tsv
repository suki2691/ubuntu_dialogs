2008-08-15T15:56:00.000Z	Elven2		Could somebody please help me? I installed Ubuntu 8.04 and when it runs my video gets all messed up
2008-08-15T15:58:00.000Z	b0rsuk	Elven2	What do you mean 'all messed up' ?
2008-08-15T15:58:00.000Z	Elven2	b0rsuk	it becomes full of lines and double images, it's hard to even read anything
2008-08-15T15:59:00.000Z	b0rsuk	Elven2	I haven't heard of that, I can't help.
