2006-04-15T07:18:00.000Z	jozzer		for a test box with xgl what ubuntu version of dapper should i go for?
2006-04-15T07:18:00.000Z	jozzer		if even dapper?
2006-04-15T07:19:00.000Z	kameron	jozzer	what? the latest dapper. but it doesn't matter what version, because by the time it's installed, there's plenty of updates to get.
2006-04-15T07:19:00.000Z	kameron	jozzer	and if you need xgl support i wreslted it all weekend, just let me know. there's also #ubuntu-xgl, but it's dead a lot of the time.
