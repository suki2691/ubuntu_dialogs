2008-10-08T21:28:00.000Z	NIghtVision		any idea why transmission in ubuntu does not have a blocklist deal compared to the mac version?
2008-10-08T21:30:00.000Z	kbrosnan	NIghtVision	might be an older version than what transmission releases on their website
2008-10-08T21:31:00.000Z	kbrosnan	NIghtVision	i.e. the feature was added after Ubuntu locked the version of applications for the distro for release
2008-10-08T21:33:00.000Z	NIghtVision	kbrosnan	yea apt-cache show info says  1.06-0ubuntu4
