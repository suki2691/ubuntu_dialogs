2011-08-29T03:19:00.000Z	Polah	antid	Yes, although for the sake of a 600MB ISO downloading a later one and burning it to a CD or putting it on a USB may be easier than upgrading a bunch of times
2011-08-29T03:21:00.000Z	Polah	antid	No, you could get the 11.04 ISO if you wanted that, get the ISO of the release you were going to upgrade to.
