2010-06-19T21:24:00.000Z	saxin		I see more people with the same problem at the launchpad.net/gwibber page
2010-06-19T21:24:00.000Z	brobostigon	saxin	do you have a terminal window open?
2010-06-19T21:25:00.000Z	saxin	brobostigon	yes, launched it with gwibber-service  -o -d
2010-06-19T21:26:00.000Z	brobostigon	saxin	you see the output from that, add that to the bug on launchpad,
