2006-12-12T07:01:00.000Z	sethk	wasp_ems	a backslash at the end of a string
2006-12-12T07:01:00.000Z	wasp_ems	sethk	i get it when i press tab to continue a path..why does it come up?
2006-12-12T07:02:00.000Z	sethk	wasp_ems	probably because there is a space at the end of the file name, and you are really seeing  backslash space
