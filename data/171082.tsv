2006-11-02T12:31:00.000Z	firebird619	clearzen	I have Intel and Beryl works great.
2006-11-02T12:32:00.000Z	clearzen	firebird619	 I have beryl installed but when I try to enable it I get a black screen then it kicks me back out to the login screen. Do you have any idea what my problem could be?
2006-11-02T12:34:00.000Z	firebird619	clearzen	No, sorry. maybe try #ubuntu-xgl channel. I just followed the Howto on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BerylOnEdgy and it worked great.
