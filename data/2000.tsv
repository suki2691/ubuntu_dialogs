2012-08-24T00:46:00.000Z	W4sp	Salah	That's a good thing given its history of security flaws and Adobe's lack of capabilities to fix it.
2012-08-24T00:48:00.000Z	Salah	W4sp	Is there a disadvantage to moving to HTML5 ?
2012-08-24T00:50:00.000Z	W4sp	Salah	Very much so. While Flash is 'free' in the sense it doesn't cost you anything to have a Flashplayer it is not free as in 'Open Source'. HTML5 is to become a standard that is supposed to support other media (movies and such).
