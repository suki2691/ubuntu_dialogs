2006-11-21T06:44:00.000Z	Litropy		Hi, all. My ubuntu installation is hanging at "Starting up the partitioner" (scanning disks...). I previously installed Yellow Dog Linux, and that might have something to do with it. I formatted my 2GB swap partition using the GNOME Partition Editor, then within the ubuntu installer I selected the partition I used for YDL, and checked the option to format it. I am currently running on the install CD. Thanks in advance for your help.
