2010-07-06T13:50:00.000Z	iflema	Waltywalt	have you ever tried just plain old Ubuntu on the same system? There is a good chance its sluggish because its Kubuntu (KDE4). Activating 3D acceleration, if not already, would help some.....
2010-07-06T13:51:00.000Z	Waltywalt	iflema	I did run ubuntu w/ gnome at one point - but I'm not sure if it was 64 bit.  How can I enable 3d acceleration ?  I'd like to try that first.
