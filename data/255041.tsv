2005-07-07T10:06:00.000Z	ogami1972		i've noticed that after being "up" for a few days, my memory load stays at about half- is there a quick way to clear this other than rebooting?
2005-07-07T10:07:00.000Z	njan	ogami1972	cached/buffered or inuse memory?
2005-07-07T10:08:00.000Z	njan	ogami1972	have you been up for a few days now?
