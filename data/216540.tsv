2006-09-29T10:24:00.000Z	ardchoille		I'm learning about how to design a gui with glade and I ran ./automake.sh and it says "**Error**: You must have `glib' installed." Which package do I need for that?
2006-09-29T10:24:00.000Z	RaD|Tz	ardchoille	glib2
2006-09-29T10:25:00.000Z	ardchoille	RaD|Tz	I don't see a glib2 package
2006-09-29T10:25:00.000Z	ardchoille	RaD|Tz	I have libglib1.2 and libglib2.0-0 installed
