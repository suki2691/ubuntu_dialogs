2007-08-15T14:53:00.000Z	BrowneR	ryness	it runs on the standard smb ports
2007-08-15T14:54:00.000Z	ryness	BrowneR	but how do i doublecheck inside the OS?
2007-08-15T14:56:00.000Z	BrowneR	ryness	i'm not sure you can even change the ports it uses, it wouldnt make any sense otherwise. it should be 137-139 and 445
