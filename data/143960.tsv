2007-05-16T14:05:00.000Z	predaeus_	freeza	right click on an empty area on the panel and "remove panel" or something similar. you can re-add the application/window list to the top panel by right clicking and adding applets

2007-05-16T14:06:00.000Z	predaeus_	freeza	that will remove the whole panel on bottom. the window list is just an applet
