2006-12-08T15:02:00.000Z	Cephei		can i ask a question , or is there a different channel for help?
2006-12-08T15:03:00.000Z	orion2012	Cephei	you're in the right place
2006-12-08T15:18:00.000Z	orion2012	Cephei	you have to actually mount it as well
2006-12-08T15:18:00.000Z	orion2012	Cephei	something like "sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/device_name /media/windows"
