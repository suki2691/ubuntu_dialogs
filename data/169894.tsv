2007-08-14T05:14:00.000Z	docta_v		are there any alternate ubuntu kernels besides generic, servier and lowlatency? specifically i'm looking for something with preemption disabled
2007-08-14T05:15:00.000Z	docta_v		since my system is apparently crashing due to a preempt bug
2007-08-14T05:15:00.000Z	macogw	docta_v	with that? probably not, i'm guessing. there's 686 with SMP and a few others...
2007-08-14T05:16:00.000Z	macogw	docta_v	not really...i mean, the taking an hour bit....but overall its not hard
