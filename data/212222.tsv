2009-10-14T10:32:00.000Z	carpediem	eshannon	well, install xfsprogs, and then it will probably let you
2009-10-14T10:32:00.000Z	carpediem	eshannon	xfsprogs isn't installed by default, and so gparted will grey xfs out
2009-10-14T10:32:00.000Z	carpediem	eshannon	but once you install it, it will be enabled in gparted
