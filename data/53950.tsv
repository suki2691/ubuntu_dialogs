2009-06-21T18:40:00.000Z	julianoliver	boss_mc	no, and probably never will be.
2009-06-21T18:40:00.000Z	boss_mc	julianoliver	why not, they released a flash player?
2009-06-21T18:40:00.000Z	julianoliver	boss_mc	i don't know. i've been using Linux for 10 years as my primary system. it was always promised, never delivered.
