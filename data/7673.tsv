2011-12-05T07:09:00.000Z	Jimmy_Kash		Is there a command I can run to delete all files older than todays date?
2011-12-05T07:10:00.000Z	Jimmy_Kash		nop, thought I would ask here
2011-12-05T07:11:00.000Z	Kimble	Jimmy_Kash	I think it's polite and expedient to check the manual first for such questions.
2011-12-05T07:11:00.000Z	Jimmy_Kash	Kimble	Sorry mate I just thought if someone knew they could help.  A simple no is okay :)
