2012-04-28T02:35:00.000Z	trism	taime1	just run it: /usr/lib/notify-osd/notify-osd; although there isn't any reason to, since it is started automatically when someone sends a notification
2012-04-28T02:36:00.000Z	taime1	trism	it isnt starting for some reason. thats why i want to try and run it manually
2012-04-28T02:38:00.000Z	taime1	trism	okay, that worked.. thanks
