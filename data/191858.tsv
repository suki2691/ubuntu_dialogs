2006-04-16T12:14:00.000Z	iegary	stjepan	You can get the sources with "apt-get source <packagename>"
2006-04-16T12:14:00.000Z	iegary	stjepan	get the dependencies with "apt-get build-dep <packagename>"
2006-04-16T12:15:00.000Z	iegary	stjepan	then when you've made your changes, run "dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot" (install dpkg-dev and fakeroot packages first)
