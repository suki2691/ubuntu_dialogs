2005-04-16T08:24:00.000Z	thinhthang		*help* I just started to install Ubuntu (i386) on my old computer.  It partitioned my drive and then it stopped at 100% and it's been at that screen for like the past 30 minutes.  Should I just restart and try again?
2005-04-16T08:25:00.000Z	thinhthang		I just downloaded the CD off bittorrent and burnt it using Roxio Toast on my Powerbook.
2005-04-16T08:26:00.000Z	thinhthang		it verified properly as well, so I'll just restart it and see what happens
