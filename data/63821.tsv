2009-03-07T01:17:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ulamSpiral	it's very different.  doesn't have nearly the hardware or software support that Ubuntu does, for a desktop they are night and day.  you pretty much have to have a compelling reason to choose Solaris over Ubuntu...
2009-03-07T01:18:00.000Z	ulamSpiral	ZykoticK9	It not really choosing one over the other for me, I'm an expirenced ubuntu user and I have a few extra machines lying around, I figured it would be fun to play with Dtrace and the ZFS
2009-03-07T01:19:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ulamSpiral	ok - just making sure you weren't a desktop user...  Solaris is "fun" to play with -- but this whole discussion is very OT, good luck man
