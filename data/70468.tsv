2009-03-29T10:58:00.000Z	FluffyBehemoth		how do i get online with ubuntu 8.10? i use a modem-router that i connect to via ethernet, windows connects fine, in theory all i need to do is get linux to see my router and i'll be online
2009-03-29T10:58:00.000Z	FluffyBehemoth		i've looked at many forums and tried lots of things but nothing's helped, any help would be great, one thread suggested that nForce4 mobos could be a problem

2009-03-29T11:00:00.000Z	sirstan	FluffyBehemoth	.... heh ok
