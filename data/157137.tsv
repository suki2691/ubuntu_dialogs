2007-10-24T07:42:00.000Z	leftyfb		Could someone help me out with getting the touchpad to work properly on an HP Pavilion tx1000 please? http://pastebin.ca/747504 should be all the information needed to help troubleshoot. The problem is the calibration being WAY off .. it detects touches, but doesn't so much move, but just resets where the mouse cursor is. I've got this far from the posts on the ubuntu forums btw.
