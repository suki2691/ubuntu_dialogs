2007-02-11T08:37:00.000Z	BoMEpsilon		Hello. I'm not quite sure how, but while editing the preferences in Beryl, /etc/X11/xorg.conf deleted. I'm running Windows right now on a dual-boot computer.
2007-02-11T08:37:00.000Z	BoMEpsilon		I know Beryl made a backup of it while installing- is there any way to recover that?
2007-02-11T08:38:00.000Z	vox754	BoMEpsilon	the backup should have a name like "xorg.conf~" or something appended.
2007-02-11T09:00:00.000Z	vox754	BoMEpsilon	you have to set those things up inside the "xorg.conf". Need to boot in rescue mode.
