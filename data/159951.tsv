2009-09-25T08:21:00.000Z	cellofellow	shawn_	not much different from 9.04, except a new (though still orange) theme and a new App Store to replace Add/Remove Applications. That's the thing with 6mo releases, they are incremental.
2009-09-25T08:22:00.000Z	cellofellow	shawn_	as far as I know no, but I'd actually welcome it. Donate to upstream devs on open source projects, and pay for commercial Linux apps.
2009-09-25T08:24:00.000Z	cellofellow	shawn_	that's fine
