I just bought a used one (and yes, I saw it before I bought it), and when I had issues with resolution, I started playing with the xorg.conf file, but now I'm getting a blank screen.  When I turn it on, the lamp flickers on for a second, then flickers off.  The LED is initially green, then becomes yellow.  What does this mean?
