2008-11-16T09:59:00.000Z	PeskyJ	Anacranom	I wouldn't say that... I'm a noob (well I've used debian a lot on servers but I've never used X before) and I found ubuntu great to switch to
2008-11-16T10:01:00.000Z	Anacranom	PeskyJ	mindrape i am a n00b too, and if i were faced with this crap,,, i would have turned away by now, tru, maybe just me but 8.10 is a mess
2008-11-16T10:04:00.000Z	PeskyJ	Anacranom	I've spent hours on end getting shit working in windows before now too... I think it's down to system setups and hardware combinations glitching each other... sure windows probably handles more varied setups better but I think ubuntu does a good job handling a fairly wide variety too - I've installed it on 4 different machines so far and not had any serious problems, except with this printer, but that was a nightmare in windows too
