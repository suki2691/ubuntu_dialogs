2008-04-12T19:37:00.000Z	Makdaam	dmsuperman	just check properties of an installed package... it usually has something like "installed files"
2008-04-12T19:37:00.000Z	Makdaam	dmsuperman	there's aptitude, however I don't use it daily
2008-04-12T19:37:00.000Z	Makdaam	dmsuperman	so I can't really tell you how to check the installed files... it has a nice menu interface though
