2008-01-05T07:21:00.000Z	rob3r		Hi, I am running Ubuntu 7.10. I am running advanced desktop effects, I am wondering if there is a way to have icons on one desktop and not on another? I currently have four desktops. An answer would be greatly appreciated : )

2008-01-05T07:24:00.000Z	rob3r	PurpZeY	hmm, thanks for the answer even though it isn't the one I am looking for
