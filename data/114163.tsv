2007-11-19T21:18:00.000Z	kjetilkWork		Seems like I need to upgrade alsa to 1.0.15 to correct a problem with my mic.
2007-11-19T21:18:00.000Z	kjetilkWork		Anyone know if I can run the packages from Debian sid (or from hardy, but they are not all at 1.0.15), on my Gutsy system?

2007-11-19T21:21:00.000Z	kjetilkWork	MasterShrek	OK, thanks, it seems like all dependencies are satisfied for the sid packages, so I'll give it a shot
