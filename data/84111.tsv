2008-07-31T05:58:00.000Z	Sylph-DS_		I've got XChat-gnome 0.18 running on xUbuntu, and I want to get a more 'normal' style user-list (who's in the channel) to the right of my chatwindow. I now have a little box saying "10 users" on the left-bottom. I haven't managed to change it in the settings. Could anybody help me?
2008-07-31T05:58:00.000Z	Sylph-DS_		Eh.. ok..
2008-07-31T05:59:00.000Z	Sylph-DS_		Is there such a big difference between xchat-gnome and xchat?
2008-07-31T05:59:00.000Z	Yondering	Sylph-DS_	sudo aptitude remove xchat-gnome, then sudo aptitude install xchat.
