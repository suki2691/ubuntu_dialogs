2011-07-03T23:39:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	aleph-2	dist-upgrade will install new version of packages (or new packages), while upgrade will not
2011-07-03T23:40:00.000Z	aleph-2	ZykoticK9	ok, which one of them shoud i use to update my system?
2011-07-03T23:41:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	aleph-2	honestly the "safest" would be to install aptitude and use the command "sudo aptitude safe-upgrade", BUT dist-upgrade is the same as the GUI update manager does.
