2010-03-31T19:43:00.000Z	Franklin		Anyone has installed ubuntu on old PC's?
2010-03-31T19:43:00.000Z	frxstrem	Franklin	yeah, I've done it (if you consider a PC from 2001 old)
2010-03-31T19:44:00.000Z	frxstrem	Franklin	I believe I did it on an older PC too (from <1998), and I think it mostly worked (except for a few driver issues)
