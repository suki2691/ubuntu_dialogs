2009-06-20T10:43:00.000Z	khelvan	lich0r	- thank you - but is there a way to make it use the Intel sound card on my motherboard rather than the internal speaker? I don't mind having notifications, I just don't want it to be my internal speaker, and right now in the Gnome Sound Preferences my sounds are set to HDA Intel Conexant Digital (ALSA)
