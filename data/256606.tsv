2008-11-30T21:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	W8TAH	 you can install any services on a desktop machine. theres not a lot of 'differance'  in desktop and server.. (well theres some, but not that differnt)
2008-11-30T21:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	W8TAH	 the 'server install' has some different tweaks, and settin gs by default - is the 'core' differance.
2008-11-30T21:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	W8TAH	 you should be able to access it as you normally do.
