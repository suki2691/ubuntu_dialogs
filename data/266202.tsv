Yesterday I changed to 2x512 RAM and could not boot up.  Tried 1 256 and 1 512 and no go.  tried 1 512 and no problems.  How can I add Ram without reinstalling or is it possible?

2005-12-24T11:16:00.000Z	tritium	Killer_Smurf	perhaps you installed the ram incorrectly.  It is not a linux issue.
2005-12-24T11:18:00.000Z	tritium	Killer_Smurf	still, not a linux or ubuntu issue
