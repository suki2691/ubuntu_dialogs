2009-07-20T03:33:00.000Z	hvgotcodes		i am removing local/obsolete files.  when i try to remove libpcre3 it wants to remove a ton of files, include apache2, compiz, gnome* etc. whats going on?
2009-07-20T03:33:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	hvgotcodes	looks like those packages all depend on libpcrfe3
2009-07-20T03:34:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	Sh3r1ff	but libpcre3 is labeled as obsolete
2009-07-20T03:41:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	hvgotcodes	in update manager
