2005-07-28T10:10:00.000Z	cdawson		Does anyone here know of a good distro that still uses 2,4 kernel.  I assume I cannot use ubuntu because of udev, which relies on 2.6, no?
2005-07-28T10:11:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	cdawson	slackware 7.1
2005-07-28T10:11:00.000Z	cdawson	hybrid_goth	 a modern distro, I should have said.
2005-07-28T10:11:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	cdawson	good luck there
