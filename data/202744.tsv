2010-04-18T05:50:00.000Z	JamieK		I've tried setting up apache2 on my ubuntu computer - I can get the "It works!" message when browsing to localhost or 192.168.1.67 from the computer I have the server on
2010-04-18T05:51:00.000Z	JamieK		But I can't connect from a different computer on the same network
