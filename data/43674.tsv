2009-11-26T19:52:00.000Z	Snausages	Younder	yeah I haven't really noticed much difference between 9.04 and 9.1
2009-11-26T19:58:00.000Z	Snausages	Younder	I dunno man...  everything worked in 9.04, and then I did an upgrade to 9.1 and...  everything worked!  Except color management anyway, but that seems like an uphill battle in linux anyway.
