2009-06-17T03:14:00.000Z	evaluate	Niphlod	universe is enabled. just like i said, i'm running the 64bit version, could this be the problem?
2009-06-17T03:16:00.000Z	evaluate	Niphlod	yes. it seems that it show up under apt-cache search kvirc. but it seriously doesn't show up in synaptic. could this be a bug or something?
2009-06-17T03:17:00.000Z	evaluate	Niphlod	no i didn't, i wanted to use synaptic, but it seems i don't have any other option ...
