2008-01-13T08:00:00.000Z	craigbass1976	truna	nope.  I have a Xubuntu disc that I just installed another box with a couple days ago (so I know it's a good disc) and I'm getting errors.  Can't remember what they were, but itwas related to the corrupted filesystem somehow.
2008-01-13T08:01:00.000Z	craigbass1976	truna	I was hoping, then run fsck from that.
