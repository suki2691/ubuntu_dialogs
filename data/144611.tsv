2007-04-28T15:00:00.000Z	Ernz		Quick question >> Can someone please tell me the name of the dialog for running an application (the one that appears when you press ALT+F2) - I would like to associate a new shortcut with it but I can't see it anywhere in the process manager.
2007-04-28T15:01:00.000Z	crdlb	Ernz	gnome-panel-control --run-dialog
2007-04-28T15:02:00.000Z	Ernz	crdlb	- Ahhhh, it's a gnome-panel perameter, that's why I didn't see it. Cheers, just what I was looking for! Bye
2007-04-28T15:11:00.000Z	Ernz	crdlb	Hey again, I tried gnome-panel-control --run-dialog but that doesn't open the run dialog window. Am i doing something wrong?
