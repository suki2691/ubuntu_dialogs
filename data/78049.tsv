2008-11-16T02:25:00.000Z	deathtech		Im having a really hard time with getting my wireless set to start at boot, I have followed multiple tutorials, and for some reason i just cant get it to come up. I have to log in locally through gnome and use network manager to connect. I use this Machine as a toy, so i can browse the web and goof off at work, so obviously it is quite important to me
