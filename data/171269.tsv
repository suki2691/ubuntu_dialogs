2006-08-12T08:51:00.000Z	malefactor		Hmm, ok, thanks visik7
2006-08-12T08:52:00.000Z	z1pp3r	malefactor	well, my honest suggestion is for you to use vfat. It's by far the easiest way to go, and vfat isn't all that bad. Just use it at a storage partition only
2006-08-12T08:52:00.000Z	malefactor	z1pp3r	yeah, looks like I have to use it further, as I am doing now...
