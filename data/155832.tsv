2007-01-14T14:16:00.000Z	Shaba1		what is ./configure
2007-01-14T14:16:00.000Z	Shaba1		so it runs the c compiler and preproccesor on its own?
2007-01-14T14:17:00.000Z	BackPacker	Shaba1	./configure checks the environment in which the compilation will take place, and it builds a makefile. The command then runs the commands in the makefile
