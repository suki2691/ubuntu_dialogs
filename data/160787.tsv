2006-11-11T10:41:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet		Hi all .. looking for a little advice .. Got my this old 450mhz PIIi/128MB ram/Nvidia NV4 AGP machine, It runs "okay" but not well. Would tossing in 256MB more ram help it enough to be worth it? My mom uses this for paperwork, printing, e-mail and the internet.

2006-11-11T10:42:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	Jordan_U	I'm in Gnome currently (she's VERY NOT into switching from MS's stuff) .. I thought about KDE but I've always had more resources spend on that WM (desktop manager) than Gnome (I tossed xubuntu on here too, but she hated it)...
