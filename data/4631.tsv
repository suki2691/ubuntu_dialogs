2012-03-14T12:28:00.000Z	AdvoWork	cookie1980	just set their shell to Bash, I can now ssh in, but I still cant do connect to server via ssh?
2012-03-14T12:40:00.000Z	AdvoWork	cookie1980	i can't connect via telnet, but I can ssh in as that user fine, under that port 8082. I just can't do it via the Connect to server method. It ranges from please verify your details to permission denied. Root works fine,  username and pass are correct :S
