2010-03-31T03:46:00.000Z	infid	Typos_King	sound randomly stops working in firefox, which makes me have to go use chrome when i want to view a flash movie. and when sound randomly stops working in chrome i have to open firefox.
2010-03-31T03:49:00.000Z	Typos_King	infid	  not sure.... I've never had that myself.... a plugin that works only now and then.... I'd think something is wrong with the plugin installation or the plugin itself
