2007-04-06T09:35:00.000Z	succeeddesigns		Hello, Ive been running ubuntu for a week or so and have noticed a slowness with just about anything menu related,  Im running 64bit ubuntu on a Dv8000, which has a ml-32 turion 64bit proc, could it be that im using a 64bit version?
2007-04-06T09:35:00.000Z	succeeddesigns		slowness like between tabs in firefox, and just opening up different windows at the same time to clarify
