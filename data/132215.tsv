2007-06-07T07:32:00.000Z	tengil		could anyone that knows about harddrive problems take a look at http://pastebin.ca/547649 and tell me what this possibly means. Fucked up disks or some other problem?
2007-06-07T07:33:00.000Z	logmein	tengil	what type of hardrive and model? what output this error? what file system and partitions? did you screw up hdparm?
2007-06-07T07:33:00.000Z	tengil		messed up disks i ment to say :)
2007-06-07T07:35:00.000Z	tengil	logmein	its output by dmesg. i also get the error "read only filesystem" when i try to create something on it now. its a maxtor drive. filesystem is ext3, and i havent changed anything with hdparm anyways
