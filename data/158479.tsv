2009-01-27T19:43:00.000Z	Cadair		cool
2009-01-27T19:44:00.000Z	Slart	Cadair	ok.. that should have made the bot tell you about irc clients.. but apparently it's sleeping or dead or something
2009-01-27T19:45:00.000Z	Slart	Cadair	I'll do it manually then... =) there's xchat and xchat-gnome.. both pretty mIRC like if you like that.. then there's irssi for command line.. and quassel.. there's probably a couple of others that people will yell at me for forgetting
