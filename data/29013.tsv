2010-07-15T05:32:00.000Z	infinitux	thune3	yes. i'm sure that's what's happening.

2010-07-15T05:34:00.000Z	thune3	infinitux	you should have all your physical memory available. livecd will also use any swap partition it finds on fixed disks. If all the physical memory is really available, the only solution is to kill memory hogging applications before you run out of memory.
