2007-03-17T06:32:00.000Z	dhaval		when is the next version going stable?
2007-03-17T06:33:00.000Z	dhaval		how good an idea is it to keep porting to the latest distro version?
2007-03-17T06:34:00.000Z	EdgEy	dhaval	i see no problem with keeping up to date :p
2007-03-17T06:34:00.000Z	dhaval	EdgEy	well, generally with other distros i tend to wait for some time (and esp with windoze :) )
