2006-08-16T06:49:00.000Z	pseudomorph		hi, i have a problem where my /home partition is reporting as full, when i check the properties of the drive in nautilus it shows that 1000+ files take up 87Mb or so and only a few 100k of space left. is it possible the rest of the space is taken in hidden files/folders that I can't see? any help appriciated.
