2011-03-16T22:36:00.000Z	_antant_		Hi guys. I'm having a problem. I'm using a Radeon 5450 connected to my TV with HDMI and I don't get any video after installing
2011-03-16T22:38:00.000Z	BluesKaj	_antant_	installing  the driver for the radeon ?
2011-03-16T22:39:00.000Z	_antant_	BluesKaj	yeah on install rather than using the open source one
2011-03-16T22:41:00.000Z	BluesKaj	_antant_	usually the recommended driver in 'hardware' will work, rather than the one off the website
