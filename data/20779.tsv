2011-01-10T00:06:00.000Z	doalittledance		I have an AMD Athlon processor with onboard sound as well as a second sound card. I would like to enable the onboard card, but it's not showing up in the Sound preferences. Is there anything I can do to enable it? I believe it uses Realtek AC97 drivers on Windows.
