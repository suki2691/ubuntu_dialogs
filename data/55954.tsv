2009-06-01T03:12:00.000Z	joaopinto	sere84	keepassx uses the same encryption algorithms as many other tools/services, it is just as crackable as them, the password quality is always a matter of concern
2009-06-01T03:22:00.000Z	joaopinto	sere84	if you are aware of a security issue with the keeppassx, please report it on launchpad, if your concern is just about the encryption safety itself, feel free to do a better suggestion, using a text editor with gpg encryption/decryption for everytime you need a password, is not usable, and not safer either
