2006-12-17T09:17:00.000Z	gaurav19		Hi again, un_operateur1. I am trying to install Ubuntu 6.06 - drapper drake, I have the iso image mounted on the CD-ROM, when I restart the machine, the Ubuntu installer does not come up, even though the boot sequence is CD-Rom first
2006-12-17T09:19:00.000Z	gaurav19		no, I just put the iso Cd in the drive and restarted the machine, expecting the CD-Rom to get precedence over the primary hard disk and start the Installation
2006-12-17T09:20:00.000Z	gaurav19		I guess that i have to initiate the installation through the CD while it is windows environment.. and then it will restart itself in a diff environment
