2012-05-01T13:29:00.000Z	tatty		Yup. Pae enabled. Thanks :)
2012-05-01T13:30:00.000Z	tatty		So ubuntu 12.04 kernel is by default pae enabled
2012-05-01T13:32:00.000Z	PsynoKhi0	tatty	I think 12.04 is the last release without the PAE kernel being default, although should the installer find more than 4GB of RAM on the machine, it will pull the PAE kernel
