2004-10-09T08:12:00.000Z	dan_a	Kamion	I thought so, is it correct that I can select linux-image-2.6-686 for installation in aptitude even though linux-image-2.6.8.1-3-686 is installed already?
2004-10-09T08:14:00.000Z	dan_a	Kamion	I guess having linux-image-2.6-686 installed just ensures I am kept up to date
2004-10-09T08:15:00.000Z	Kamion	dan_a	yep
