2009-09-28T07:04:00.000Z	djzn	solid_liq	excuse me, according to Phoronix, Nvidia is not supporting SLI or Hybrid Graphics under Linux, ATI Radeon HD 3200 is already well supported under Linux, and CrossfireX is supported.
2009-09-28T07:04:00.000Z	solid_liq	djzn	have you even *tried* to use the amd drivers?  I have.  It made me buy an nvidia card
2009-09-28T07:05:00.000Z	djzn	solid_liq	I am talking about this particular ATI chip....
