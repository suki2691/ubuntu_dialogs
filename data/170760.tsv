2006-10-16T13:56:00.000Z	mikedep333		hey, I just upgraded from dapper to edgy and now I just see a blank screen during startup
2006-10-16T13:56:00.000Z	mikedep333		is there a way to restore either the boot messages or the graphic?
2006-10-16T13:56:00.000Z	mikedep333		I'm guessing I would dpkg-reconfigure something
2006-10-16T13:57:00.000Z	mnepton	mikedep333	afaik there are no boot messages displayed in the GUI loader in Upstart
