2010-08-07T21:41:00.000Z	uBUTTtu		i am extracting an archive of a linux filesystem and after it "extracts" it gives me this error http://pastebin.org/453450
2010-08-07T21:42:00.000Z	uBUTTtu		what does that error mean?
2010-08-07T21:43:00.000Z	Israfel	uBUTTtu	it means you don't have permission.
2010-08-07T21:45:00.000Z	Israfel	uBUTTtu	Were the old archives using a different file system?
