2010-08-23T00:24:00.000Z	pyTopher		My cursor is acting funny,  when I try to click inside a window it just grabs the window instead, why is it doing this?
2010-08-23T00:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pyTopher	could your ALT key be stuck down?
2010-08-23T00:26:00.000Z	pyTopher	ZykoticK9	thats wierd when I hold alt down it works fine
2010-08-23T00:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	pyTopher	so it's acting in reverse - sorry no idea how to fix that.  Good luck.
