2005-09-28T05:17:00.000Z	crimsun	mindframe	not by default. Why do you need the source? Do the headers not suffice?
2005-09-28T05:17:00.000Z	mindframe	crimsun	im trying to compile a newer version of ndiswrapper that i cant find a package for and it needs the kernel source for some reason
2005-09-28T05:20:00.000Z	crimsun	mindframe	I'm pretty sure you only need linux-headers-$(uname -r)
