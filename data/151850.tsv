2007-05-19T10:23:00.000Z	Rynoo		I am trying to transfer files between 2 ubuntu machines, I have NIC cards in both, and a single cat5e. I dont have another cable to connect to the router, so is there a way to connect the 2 machines directly to transfer data?

2007-05-19T10:24:00.000Z	Rynoo	th1	they both do
2007-05-19T10:24:00.000Z	th1	Rynoo	then you just connect the cable and you are on
