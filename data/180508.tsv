2010-04-28T19:21:00.000Z	rldowling03		I am preparing to get ready for 10.04, and I have always wondered, should I be using 64 bit or 32 bit version? I have a 64 bit processor and have used 64 bit windows, just wondering if it is beneficial to use 64 bit version or just stick to 32 bit
2010-04-28T19:22:00.000Z	anodesni	rldowling03	how much RAM?
2010-04-28T19:22:00.000Z	anodesni	rldowling03	definitely 64bit
2010-04-28T19:23:00.000Z	anodesni	rldowling03	not really unless you use zsnes
