2007-08-07T07:24:00.000Z	ma1		hi, my wireless network manager does not show unprotected networks, but the network settings shows them. how can i show them in network manager applet?
2007-08-07T07:25:00.000Z	serenityUK	ma1	maybe try manual config..  i found mine stuck on roaming mode because of a weak signal.. try clicking choosing unprotected manually
2007-08-07T07:26:00.000Z	ma1	serenityUK	the signal is like 93-96% simply the unprotected networks are not shown...
2007-08-07T07:26:00.000Z	ma1	serenityUK	there is a security setting that disables the unprotected networks?
