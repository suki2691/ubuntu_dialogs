2006-06-15T11:42:00.000Z	rob138		does anyone know how to help me troubleshoot my problem?
2006-06-15T11:43:00.000Z	Ademan	rob138	have you tried just installing the version of wine straight out of the ubuntu repositories?
2006-06-15T11:44:00.000Z	rob138	Ademan	yeah but it will not get CS:S working, so i want to try different options like the dx9 version and the cedega version
