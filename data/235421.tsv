2005-12-21T09:22:00.000Z	BrianB04		Is there any list online that shows the hardware that Ubuntu will work with, or is it pretty much whatever linux can deal with?
2005-12-21T09:23:00.000Z	BrianB04		And, does Ubuntu have a 64 bit version?
2005-12-21T09:24:00.000Z	Madpilot	BrianB04	there's a 64bit version, as well as x86 & PPC
