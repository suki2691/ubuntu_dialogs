2007-05-19T16:02:00.000Z	fumanju		just wondering...xp/vista has the remote desktop thing...does ubuntu have something like that?
2007-05-19T11:16:00.000Z	fumanju		just wondering, i got 3 partitions on my Hdd, 2 primaries and 1 logical...the logical partition being FAT32 formatted...is it possible to install ubuntu on the 3rd partition?

2007-05-19T11:18:00.000Z	Lilacor	fumanju	I'm pretty sure FAT32 isn't going to fly for the installation...I *could* be wrong
