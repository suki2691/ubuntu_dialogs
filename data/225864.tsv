2005-11-19T13:13:00.000Z	trappist	skippy	you can't give something away, make it free for other people to redistribute it, and collect fees for included proprietary software
2005-11-19T13:14:00.000Z	skippy	trappist	I'm not entirely familiar with the licensing details; is it impossible to purchase a license for use without fees?   Lots of Wintel DVD playback software is bundled without (an outright, to the customer, at least) fee
2005-11-19T13:15:00.000Z	trappist	skippy	trust me, fees are paid for that stuff and passed on to the customer.  but the gpl makes it illegal to bundle software for which distribution fees are required, because ubuntu itself has to stay redistributable.
