2009-09-23T22:18:00.000Z	urthmover	bullgard4	I would like to install the latest stable evolution 2.28 on my jaunty 64 system here.  I am unable to find a PPA with it.  I have attempted to download and compile myself but I get a number of dependenciy errors (even after sudo apt-get builddep evolution)  What do you reccomend?  Do you know of a PPA that has the latest evolution 2.28 on it?
2009-09-23T22:21:00.000Z	bullgard4	urthmover	Today I have heard that a stable Evolution 2.28 is to be released with Karmic. So my advice would be that you install now the stable Evolution version that you can obtain now and upgrad at the end of October to Karmic and Evolution 2l.28.
