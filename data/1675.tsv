2012-08-06T10:51:00.000Z	highbuzz	AzzIzzA	I don't see anything, GRUB doesn't even load up. I can't alter the video settings (or I don't know how rather) because it doesn't give me the option. I had to use the alternative CD to even install because this would happen if I tried the liveCD as well
2012-08-06T10:55:00.000Z	AzzIzzA	highbuzz	ok, out of my league I'm afraid, I'm more of a slackware guy in general. It is strange though, the fact that you don't see grub suggests it is grub that is messing up the display, but I'm fairly sure that the livecd just uses syslinux without grub
