2012-04-01T05:46:00.000Z	Grivvel		I had a crazy idea and I'm wondering if anyone has any idea where I should start. I have a 24-minute .ogg file of rain sounds that I'd like to layer over an mp3 stream of piano music. Does anyone know of any programs that will let me layer the two and access it as one audio file/stream through my music players?

2012-04-01T05:49:00.000Z	Grivvel	Patrick_DJ	Yeah, I'd definitely use Audacity if I were dealing with static songs, but since one is a live MP3 stream, audacity doesn't seem to work.
