2010-04-04T11:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dragontech	 live cd + gparted is one way. Windows can resize its own ntfs also. (depends on the windows version)
2010-04-04T11:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dragontech	 the installer can also resize.
2010-04-04T11:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dragontech	 try removeing it via the command line.. mention what errors it says
