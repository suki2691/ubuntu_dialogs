2007-05-30T10:06:00.000Z	cerealkiller219		I used the update manager to get 7.04, but it failed some file about 3/4 of the way through the installation, now when I boot up it only boots up some of the programs... is there a way to repair that?

2007-05-30T10:07:00.000Z	cerealkiller219		no
2007-05-30T10:08:00.000Z	cerealkiller219	ablyss	but I know it needs repaired
