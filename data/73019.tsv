2009-09-05T18:19:00.000Z	whileimhere		Hi. I am going to buy a netbook. I am not sure what one I want. I love the smallness and lack of a CD drive with the extended battery. What I would like to know is this can I install Ubuntu to any of these and will I be able to do things like simple powerpoints, word-processing, and skype?
