2010-09-26T09:46:00.000Z	Pentium3		Why doesn't Ubuntu come with the gstreamer packages, so people who dont have internet can play MP3's?
2010-09-26T09:46:00.000Z	Izinucs	Pentium3	the mp3 codec is a paid codec..
2010-09-26T09:47:00.000Z	Pentium3	Izinucs	thanks, I was just curious, cause a year ago that was a pain in my neck, I didnt have internet then.
