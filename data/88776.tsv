2008-06-02T23:19:00.000Z	hank221	gronne	I would disagree. Java is a fantastic starting programming language on my opinion.
2008-06-02T23:20:00.000Z	hank221		It is a simple(ish) start of the fundamentals for most other programming languages.
2008-06-02T23:21:00.000Z	gronne	hank221	ok! I had the impression hardly anyone used it apart from for internet-software as it's cross-platform. I'm using X-chat now, is that java?
