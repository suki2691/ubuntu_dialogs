2008-06-01T22:13:00.000Z	ColdFingers		I am trying to remove the BRontok Virus from a WinDoze box using the Hardy LiveCD but I don't know how to find all the 44.3KB EXE files easily? Does anyone know how to search for EXE's of a certain size/date?
2008-06-01T22:15:00.000Z	ColdFingers		I am having success deleting the little bastards one by one but there are about 73 exe named the same as the folder they are in spread all over the harddrive and I don't know how to make a script to find them all...!
2008-06-01T22:17:00.000Z	ColdFingers		I have not been able to delete the files in windoze in normal/safemode so I had to approach it with some bigger guns! = hardy!
