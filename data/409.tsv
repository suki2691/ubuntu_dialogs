2012-11-15T03:16:00.000Z	Raugturi		Does anyone know how I can install moonlight in Google Chrome?  I downloaded the CRX file but it won't let me install it as it isn't from the Chrome store.

2012-11-15T03:18:00.000Z	Raugturi	_axel_	I found that answer in a couple of places too, but it doesn't do anything at all.
2012-11-15T03:19:00.000Z	Raugturi	_axel_	I drag the file out of nautilus, hover over the extensions window and in some screenshots I saw it pop up a message saying to drag/drop there, but I don't get that no matter where I hover with the file.  And when I let go nothing happens.
