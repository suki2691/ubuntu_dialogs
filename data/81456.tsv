2008-11-05T01:36:00.000Z	Cyberia		Hey, how do I find out what libraries I need to install a program? I'm getting errors when I run 'make'. :)
2008-11-05T01:36:00.000Z	Pelo	Cyberia	hve y ou run ./configure first ?
2008-11-05T01:37:00.000Z	Pelo	Cyberia	first install build essential ,   sudo apt-get install build-essential ,  then open a terminal , cd to the folder with your source in it and run  ./configure  that will tell you if you have everytihng you need to install
2008-11-05T01:38:00.000Z	Cyberia	Pelo	I was suggested build-essential, I did that and have the most recent files. And there is NO configure file :S
