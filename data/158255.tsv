2009-01-05T01:35:00.000Z	DawnLight		help! i've just installed ubuntu on my machine and i've a kernel panic because it can't mount root filesystem for some reason. i don't remember the reason, though. should i check or is this a common issue. i've never experienced this
2009-01-05T01:35:00.000Z	Slart	DawnLight	you should check.. it's not a common issue
2009-01-05T16:01:00.000Z	Slart	DawnLight	there are some accessability options for controlling the pointer with the numeric keyboard.. but I don't think gnome was meant for keyboard only operation
2009-01-05T16:03:00.000Z	Slart	DawnLight	but that would of course depend on how you use it.. what programs you run and so on..
