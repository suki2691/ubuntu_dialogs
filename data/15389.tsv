2012-05-25T22:01:00.000Z	do1080		does it not count myself?
2012-05-25T22:01:00.000Z	escott	do1080	who only counts tty's and psuedo ttys. not all terminal like applications open a tty
2012-05-25T22:02:00.000Z	escott	do1080	guake for one doesn't although im not sure what it does if it doesnt have a tty...
