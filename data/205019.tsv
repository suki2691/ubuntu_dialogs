2006-01-05T08:22:00.000Z	david_m_e		i'm looking for a site that is for those new to Linux and with (obviously) quality info... Linux.com's home page says it's for those new to Linux, but then thier list of good, free distributions doesnt' include UBUNTU and the general tone seemed to imply it's just a front door for sales
