2011-08-25T17:46:00.000Z	Jonii		Does anyone know if Ubuntu has a media player that plays mkv files properly?
2011-08-25T17:46:00.000Z	Jonii		I'm thinking I should try running Media Player Classic using WinE, but I'd like a native program if possible
2011-08-25T17:46:00.000Z	Jonii		mplayer doesn't work
2011-08-25T17:46:00.000Z	hiwk	Jonii	why doesn't mplayer work?
