2009-06-26T10:49:00.000Z	vince_		Can anyone help me with this Evolution issue.  Ever since I did the last updates it freezes immedialty after start.  I attemped to move the .evolution folder out of my home directory to let it rebuild the databases but it sill will not work properly.  I really don't know what else to do.
