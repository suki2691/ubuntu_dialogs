2007-05-08T05:30:00.000Z	bulle	Alonea	i have some random lockups with firefox aswell, and i run new flash
2007-05-08T05:30:00.000Z	Alonea	bulle	yeah. I have not installed the new version yet. one day when I said firefox crashed he started talking about this flash problem
2007-05-08T05:33:00.000Z	Alonea	bulle	I would post an older version of the install, but I no longer have the install file. I deleted a bunch of unneeded files the other day because I needed space
2007-05-08T05:33:00.000Z	bulle	Alonea	no worries
