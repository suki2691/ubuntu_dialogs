2010-09-19T20:41:00.000Z	SeaOrifice		My laptop uses  Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Desktop Edition and I have these questions : 1) I had seen an application which on every keystroke displays ascii value of it and some more information about it . I need to know its name 2) I am doubtful about the version i am using , my processor is 64 bit but gnome system manager displays only 2.96gb than 4gb of mine
