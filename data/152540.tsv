2007-12-12T06:25:00.000Z	Centaur5	simplechat	I can't access windowsupdate.microsoft.com, apple.com, hotmail.com ever since I started using an iptables script.
2007-12-12T06:25:00.000Z	simplechat	Centaur5	are you using moblock or peerguardian?
2007-12-12T06:26:00.000Z	Centaur5	simplechat	no. I was using firestarter up until Sunday and everything worked.  Ever since I switched to ipkungfu and now this custom script I can't go to those sites.
