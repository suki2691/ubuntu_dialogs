2007-07-05T16:20:00.000Z	pipegeek		Phrased differently, what's the recommended way to get reiser4 working in ubuntu feisty?  The reiser4 packages that it includes don't seem to do the trick
2007-07-05T16:21:00.000Z	lufis	pipegeek	the kernel should already support reiserfs, it's just a matter of formatting the drive
2007-07-05T16:21:00.000Z	pipegeek	lufis	reiserfs 3, not 4
2007-07-05T16:21:00.000Z	lufis	pipegeek	ooh, i don't know
