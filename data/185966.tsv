2006-05-31T05:39:00.000Z	mattikoo	Agent_bob	I'm not in nautilus. I was in gnome-terminal.
2006-05-31T05:42:00.000Z	Agent_bob	mattikoo	you can use [alt] +[ctrl] +[f1]   and login the console,  and there use sudo rm .*auth*    and [alt] +[F7]   will take you back to the gdm screen
2006-05-31T06:01:00.000Z	mattikoo	Agent_bob	I'm back. Now I hope we solve why my gdm will restart again and again
