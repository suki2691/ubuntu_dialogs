2008-01-13T05:12:00.000Z	marylou		Hey. I just finished getting a new Ubuntu installation all set up, and I restarted once, and it was all fine, but had changed the resolution. I went to the display preferences and changed it to something that worked, and all seemed well. But the next time I turned the computer on, it was outside the monitor's display range. I'm currently on the liveCD.
2008-01-13T05:12:00.000Z	marylou		Can anybody help me out here?
