2009-01-25T04:36:00.000Z	Izinucs	El	why when you have Open Office.?
2009-01-25T04:38:00.000Z	Izinucs	El	templates might work in Open Office and you can also save in MS format.. Better? that's very subjective .. for the vast majority of people it doesn't make one hoot of difference..
2009-01-25T04:42:00.000Z	Izinucs	El	 if you absolutely have to it is typically possible with wine.. you should check the winehq site first to see what versions and how well it's supported..
