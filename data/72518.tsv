2008-12-25T11:10:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Tim__Reichhart	perhaps the 'dd command. see it's man page. or perhaps search for this utility on google  Ghost Unix(aka g4u)
2008-12-25T11:12:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Tim__Reichhart	 Ghost Unix  -  search for that on google. some people think its overkill for what they need, but it is supposed to ghost HDD's without any fancy networking or whatever. but i can't say i ever used it
2008-12-25T11:15:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Tim__Reichhart	ok, this might better since you want to umount your whole hard drive, it contains Ghost for Unix(g4u)  -->  http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/
