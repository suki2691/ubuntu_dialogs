2007-04-19T10:56:00.000Z	Stig		Hi all. I would like to upgrade to Feisty from Edgy, but I would like to reformat first, so Edgy is completely erased, because it's full of problems with graphics drivers, Beryl, etc. I think a fresh install would be better. How do I reformat and install Feisty? Do I just download the .iso, but it on a CD and boot it? will there be an option to reformat? or do I need to do something else? Cheers.
