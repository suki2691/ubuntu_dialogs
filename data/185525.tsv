2006-05-20T12:00:00.000Z	Linuzo		I made an error, I know when doing a dual boot you should always install windows first then linux or else windows will over write the bootloader and you won't be able to boot Ubuntu, I had to reinstall windows because that's how windows is needs to be reinstalled so often but I had a whole bunch of stuff on Ub untu and don't want to lose itr. how do I install a bootloader now?
