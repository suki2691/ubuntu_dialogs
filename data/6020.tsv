2012-02-14T17:44:00.000Z	Walther		Is there a way to remove the entire graphical interface from Ubuntu? I want to have a CLI-only Ubuntu install, but ALT CD did not work properly
2012-02-14T17:45:00.000Z	Walther		Is there a metapackage I could remove which would have all the dependencies
2012-02-14T17:45:00.000Z	Walther		Already tried removing unity and ubuntu.desktop
