2009-05-17T01:18:00.000Z	Kai_wp		I'm running Ubuntu 8.10 Hardy Heron and now when I attempt to boot it it brings me to the BusyBox shell. Why would this be? Only a week ago at most it was perfectly fine.. I need to get into Ubuntu to copy files to my file server as my Window's installation's security has been compromised.
2009-05-17T01:20:00.000Z	Kai_wp		Anyone? I'd really like to get backing up my files. Does anyone have any idea why I'd suddenly be getting the BusyBox shell?
2009-05-17T01:21:00.000Z	lstarnes	Kai_wp	did you do any recent updates?
2009-05-17T01:22:00.000Z	Kai_wp	lstarnes	Last time I was in it it installed a mass amount of updates, but I'm pretty sure I rebooted back into Ubuntu just to make sure it all worked out.
