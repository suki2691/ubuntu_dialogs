2005-08-02T15:56:00.000Z	Firetech		What can be wrong if my USB 2.0 external drive gets recognised as a high speed device, but doesn't give me speeds over 10 MB/s (approx 80 Mbps)?
2005-08-02T15:58:00.000Z	azik	Firetech	i think that is not a bad speed
2005-08-02T15:58:00.000Z	Firetech	azik	well... High speed usb should go up to 480 Mbps
2005-08-03T16:00:00.000Z	azik	Firetech	uhm, then near 60MB/s... my hard disk  don't go so fast :)
