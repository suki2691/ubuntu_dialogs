2010-01-20T14:21:00.000Z	Polysics		anyone has pointers on how to get rid of PulseAudio?
2010-01-20T14:22:00.000Z	Polysics		if i can't do that i have to go back to Windows, which might mean i will start screaming
2010-01-20T14:23:00.000Z	Kentrel	Polysics	just kill the process
2010-01-20T14:23:00.000Z	Polysics	Kentrel	i then need to replace PulseAudio with ALSA, i suppose
