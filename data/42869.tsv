2009-12-20T22:10:00.000Z	Lauer		is it okay to install a single package from 9.10 when running 9.04? (its a server) - and how should I do it?
2009-12-20T22:11:00.000Z	Slart	Lauer	sometimes.. but generally.. it will be more problems than it's worth
2009-12-20T22:11:00.000Z	Lauer	Slart	its just a websystem, otrs2 - else I would just install it from source
2009-12-20T22:12:00.000Z	Slart	Lauer	if it doesn't have a lot of dependencies it should be ok.. try opening it with gdebi.. it will tell you if it's happy =)
