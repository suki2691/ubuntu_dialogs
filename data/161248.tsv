2006-12-04T11:57:00.000Z	Madpilot	ademan	same way you'd join a mailing list w/ any other client - generally, send an email asking to subscribe...
2006-12-04T11:57:00.000Z	ademan	Madpilot	ah ok, i'm relatively unfamiliar with mailing lists
2006-12-04T11:58:00.000Z	Madpilot	ademan	if it's Ubuntu lists you're trying to join, all their pages have basic info on joining
