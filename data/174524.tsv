2006-08-01T14:10:00.000Z	cmatheson		this is slightly OT... i'm trying to figure out how to enable quotas for my virtual users on one domain... it seems that their are two ways to do this, courier maildir quotas (bad option?) or the postfix vda patch.  could someone tell me more about the vda patch? (why isn't it part of standard postfix?)
2006-08-01T14:12:00.000Z	cpk2	cmatheson	there is a #postfix channel
2006-08-01T14:13:00.000Z	cmatheson	cpk2	yeah, there's just no activity there
2006-08-01T14:14:00.000Z	cpk2	cmatheson	yeah you usually have to wait a while to get an answer in there heh
