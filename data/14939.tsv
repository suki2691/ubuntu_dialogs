2011-04-29T03:31:00.000Z	Drumm96		I was doing a system upgrade, and at about 99% it crashed. Now on normal boot I'm having issues, but I can boot in failsafe mode.

2011-04-29T03:33:00.000Z	Drumm96	Galvatron	Thankyou. Got many similar issues tonight?
2011-04-29T03:34:00.000Z	Drumm96	Galvatron	I'll try a reboot. Hope it works!
