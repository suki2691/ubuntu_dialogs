2008-06-17T15:30:00.000Z	Da_Putzler	skurakai	go into synaptic package manager and search for "linux-" it will list all of the kernels, so you can remove the old -16 and -18... but make sure -19 is installed ok 1st
2008-06-17T15:33:00.000Z	skurakai	Da_Putzler	you mean "linux-headers" ?
2008-06-17T15:34:00.000Z	Da_Putzler	skurakai	basically the image files and headers ending in -16 and -19 are the old ones, the one's ending in -19 are the new ones
