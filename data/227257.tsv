2005-09-01T12:07:00.000Z	userc479		does this ubuntv also work with Windows Application?
2005-09-01T12:08:00.000Z	ce33na	userc479	there is a project called WINE which allows some windows apps to run under linux, but generally...no
2005-09-01T12:09:00.000Z	ce33na	userc479	we are reaching a point in the linux world where there is a linux equivalent to most windows apps anyway.
