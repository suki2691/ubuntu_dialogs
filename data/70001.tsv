2009-01-04T02:44:00.000Z	vileli8ves		I'm playing around with the terminal and just discovered the program less. when I scroll to the end of whatever file I am working, I get the message "waiting for data (interrupt to abort)." I've read the man page, but I can't figure out any way to do this, so I get stuck and have to close bash. What do I do?

2009-01-04T02:46:00.000Z	vileli8ves	Slart	Aha! Ctrl+C did the trick. q wasn't doing it, but I didn't think of that. Thanks!
