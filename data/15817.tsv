2011-10-12T03:19:00.000Z	Random832		I unisntalled and reinstalled openjdk-7-jre-headless and now I don't have a "java" command
2011-10-12T03:19:00.000Z	Random832		how do i 'reset' it so it'll set up alternatives or whatever
2011-10-12T03:19:00.000Z	dtigue	Random832	i find that sun-java is a better package to have
2011-10-12T03:21:00.000Z	Random832	dtigue	i forgot, i'm on 11.10. still, as a general question, how do you "reset" a package so it'll do everything when you install that it did on first install
