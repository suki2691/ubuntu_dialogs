2010-10-03T17:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	knolls_	 proberly not without them setting somthing up.. or you having some things setup beforhand to log what hes doing..
2010-10-03T17:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	knolls_	 'screen' can be used to share a session with someone so you both can see whats going on at the same time.. theres other tools out i think also
2010-10-03T17:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	knolls_	 there used to be some ttysnoop type tools.. but you need to have them setup  befor the users start connecting i recall.
