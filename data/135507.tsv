2008-05-08T07:56:00.000Z	zChris	tinytimmytoes	i recommende Xubuntu becouse it uses less resources than Ubuntu
2008-05-08T07:57:00.000Z	zChris	tinytimmytoes	pretty much the same i would say
2008-05-08T07:58:00.000Z	zChris	tinytimmytoes	 the X in Xubuntu stands for xfce , its another WM . Google it and youll see how it looks
