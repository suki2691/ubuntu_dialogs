2006-04-20T08:00:00.000Z	joh6nn	TABASCO	you're trying to change files on a linux partition from a windows partition?
2006-04-20T08:04:00.000Z	joh6nn	TABASCO	check to see if there's a file named sources.list~
2006-04-20T08:06:00.000Z	joh6nn	TABASCO	the ~ file has the changes in it too?
2006-04-20T08:07:00.000Z	joh6nn	TABASCO	then you're SOL as far as restoring goes.  try apt-get update, and hope for the best
