2005-12-15T17:47:00.000Z	freelove		are there any rules that hdb1 should be swap pr / partition or primary partition?
2005-12-15T17:48:00.000Z	runevi	freelove	No.
2005-12-15T17:49:00.000Z	freelove	runevi	during installation i saw that swap was my primary partition....and home & / were logical ones............is this ok?
2005-12-15T17:49:00.000Z	runevi	freelove	I think so .. I usually have / as hda1 or whatever, then make the rest be logical volumes, but I think it
