2005-08-26T15:36:00.000Z	Crissy		Hey guys, I may be female but i'm not dumb, and I can't believe that installing a pluging nor the upgrading of an app (firefox) is that hard. how about some help. I have read wiki's, installs from the mozilla site, soundforge etc and still no worky!!!
2005-08-26T15:37:00.000Z	Crissy		crimsum, install firefox and flash either the defualt plugin or the gplflash
2005-08-26T15:37:00.000Z	Crissy		my firefox is v1.02 and want to upgrade to the more recent. apt-get -u update has not worked
2005-08-26T15:38:00.000Z	umboto	Crissy	 just use the ubuntu update manager
