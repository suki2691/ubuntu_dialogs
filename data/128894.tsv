2007-08-23T11:44:00.000Z	wit_273		I just updated to Gusty Gibbon and now I do not have the title bar along the top of my windows.  Does anyone know how to get that back?
2007-08-23T11:45:00.000Z	leo_rockw	wit_273	are you using beryl/compiz?
2007-08-23T11:46:00.000Z	leo_rockw	wit_273	ok... then idk (i asked because it is a common compiz problem)
2007-08-23T11:47:00.000Z	leo_rockw	wit_273	beats me, i don't use eye candy, but i'm aware there's a problem with compiz that makes your top bar disappear
