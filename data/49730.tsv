2009-09-02T02:15:00.000Z	cryptopsy	bigdavejoker	google pieces of the error, whichever you deem more relevant.
2009-09-02T02:16:00.000Z	cryptopsy	bigdavejoker	seemingly random number strings are to be omitted.
2009-09-02T02:16:00.000Z	bigdavejoker	cryptopsy	thanks I'll give it another try the camera is supposed to be supported and works with other programs but kills ekiga everytime
