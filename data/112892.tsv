2007-11-23T15:05:00.000Z	Frenzy		I'm on 6.10, i need apache with support of >2gb files. Is there any way to upgrade apache to 2.2 WITHOUT upgrading distro and without compiling?
2007-11-23T15:06:00.000Z	Mortice	Frenzy	you could see if there's a backported package, or you could compile apache yourself.
2007-11-23T15:06:00.000Z	Frenzy	Mortice	compiling means checking manually security updates...
2007-11-23T15:06:00.000Z	Mortice	Frenzy	indeed.
