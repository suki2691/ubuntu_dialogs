2011-05-05T11:49:00.000Z	Gerowen	DawnLight	Thanks, I just mounted an encrypted volume with Truecrypt, and I'm trying to re-open it to unmount it, however the notification icon is done, and when I try to just click the normal icon again I get a message telling me that Truecrypt is already running, :-(
