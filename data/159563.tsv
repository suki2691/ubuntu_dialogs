2007-07-08T12:28:00.000Z	whta		anyone know of a good resource for learning bash commands? I know google will offer me thousands of results, but that's just the problem. Too many to choose from and I don't know which cover the most and in the best way. So if anyone has a personal favorite resource I'd like to know it. Please.
