2009-12-08T16:47:00.000Z	Rajasun		Ok guys, I have 2 questions. I used to know this but somehow cannot now recall.
2009-12-08T16:47:00.000Z	Rajasun		1. How can I tell how many packages I have installed on my Ubuntu box from the commandline?
2009-12-08T16:47:00.000Z	Rajasun		2. How can I find out the total number of packages available for install in each of the "main", "restricted", "universe", "multiverse", "karmic-updates", "karmic-updates", "karmic-backports" and "karmic-security" repos again, from the commandline?
