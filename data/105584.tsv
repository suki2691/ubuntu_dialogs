2008-01-17T00:37:00.000Z	th0r	atlanix-org	I would install a lightweight wm like xfce or fluxbox...wouldn't waste space on gnome or kde. But like you pointed out start at run level 3 and just invoke X if you need it
2008-01-17T00:38:00.000Z	atlanix-org	th0r	good point.  we shell in so much just seems pointless to have a GUI
2008-01-17T00:38:00.000Z	th0r	atlanix-org	yeah...for the most part I agree...but there is always that one exception <smile>
