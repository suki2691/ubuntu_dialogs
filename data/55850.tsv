2009-06-01T04:45:00.000Z	tvbox		i've got a set of commands using xrandr that enable my s-video out so my TV works but i want to know how to enable them on login or boot
2009-06-01T04:45:00.000Z	fryguy	tvbox	add them to whatever you use to initialize your x11 session (gnome-session unless you changed things)
2009-06-01T04:47:00.000Z	tvbox	fryguy	i'm happy to add them to the gnome-session file, where is it kept (reasonably clean install)
2009-06-01T04:48:00.000Z	fryguy	tvbox	no idea, i don't use gnome, probably gnome-session-properties or something
