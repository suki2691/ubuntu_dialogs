2010-05-28T09:08:00.000Z	blackstar	bastid_raZor	I ony use root to create the files or folders, for a user with no administration or root rights, under his account or home folder for the standard users , ... now whenever the standard user is trying to delete the files or  folders using the terminal he can't not do it, but if he uses nautilus it allow him to delete the files, maybe someone here can try  and they will see what i mean
