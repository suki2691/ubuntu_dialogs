2007-07-05T08:32:00.000Z	rendo		I've always used alt+d in FireFox, And FF is broken from the updates I just installed so I'm using Opera for now, and alt+d doesn't work for Opera :/

2007-07-05T08:34:00.000Z	Stwange	rendo	we all learnt something today :) I wish they could be consistent though, would be nice if there was a way of changing that shortcut
