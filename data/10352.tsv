Everything runs fine once I hit the desktop, but typing in passwords, selecting a username, anything on the login screen takes at least ten seconds or so to register. Any idea why?

2012-07-02T21:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ForSpareParts	 is it slow as soon as you boot up? or have you noticed it just being slow if it waits for a user to login for some time
2012-07-02T21:06:00.000Z	ForSpareParts	Dr_Willis	I saw this immediately after logging out. I did a hard reset, and the same thing happened. Logged in and back out, just to check, and again, same thing.
