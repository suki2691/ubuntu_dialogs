2009-09-08T08:23:00.000Z	Jester_		I have a question. I had a dual boot vista/ubuntu installation that i wanted to ditch vista from. I backed up my ubuntu via partimage, reformatted the drive, and restored it via partimage, and now grub wont load properly. I've tried editing the menu.lst, but with the uuid lines i'm not really sure what to do. Any ideas?
2009-09-08T08:24:00.000Z	Jester_		Thanks. I'll try that.
2009-09-08T08:25:00.000Z	losher	Jester_	the uuids have to match for the root partition indicated in menu.lst, and also in /etc/fstab if you used them there...
2009-09-08T08:32:00.000Z	losher	Jester_	if you reformatted and created new partitions, the uuids should change. So I'm suspicious of the root uuid not needing to be updated. Especially if it's still not working...
