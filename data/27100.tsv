2010-08-23T22:05:00.000Z	nnilk46		I would love to just install from the 10.04LTS disc however the OS install always hangs at just before the disk partitioner starts up. Same on 9.10. The only one that seems to work is 9.04 (Which installs grub legacy, and I want everything to upgrade for this new machine.)

2010-08-23T22:07:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	nnilk46	you could reinstall grub manually using the live cd
2010-08-23T22:07:00.000Z	nnilk46	ilovefairuz	I'll try that
