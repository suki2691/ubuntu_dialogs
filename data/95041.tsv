2008-04-13T01:08:00.000Z	tuxus	didy	do you want the complete KDE desktop, or...?
2008-04-13T01:15:00.000Z	tuxus	didy	if you have Ubuntu installed, then install the kde desktop, you probably get a HUGE start menu
2008-04-13T01:19:00.000Z	tuxus	didy	when installing Debian, you can pass an extra command before booting that will install both gnome & kde (Debian is gnome too by default). Look into that, but I wouldn't recommend it. Even if everything integrates nicely, you'll get a huge list of apps
