2010-05-27T06:35:00.000Z	Sereph		can someone tell me how to install grub to the mbr of a specific hard disk?
2010-05-27T06:36:00.000Z	acerimmer_	Sereph	during installation, just before HDD writing starts there's a screen with "advanced options".  Grub install is there
2010-05-27T06:37:00.000Z	acerimmer_	Sereph	of course, if you've ALREADY installed...?
2010-05-27T06:43:00.000Z	Sereph	acerimmer_	yes I already installed it I just need to replace grub in the MBR on this disk
