2010-08-13T05:52:00.000Z	_DGM_		shouldnt have anything to do with the video driver.. i cant imagine that having anything to do with eachother
2010-08-13T05:53:00.000Z	Wiesshund	_DGM_	his video driver doesnt appear to be working. he can go back to gnome with same issue and cant enable desktop effects etc
2010-08-13T05:54:00.000Z	_DGM_	Wiesshund	either way i dont see how that could be related. Even if he had a standard vga or vesa driver he prolly still cant move windows
2010-08-13T05:58:00.000Z	Wiesshund	_DGM_	i had same issue while i had driver removed and was building a new driver.
