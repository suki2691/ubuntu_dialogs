2005-04-25T14:57:00.000Z	delire	alexwillmer	less efficient albeit ;)
2005-04-25T14:58:00.000Z	alexwillmer	delire	what, my way? it made sense as i interpreted 'man grep' but no joy, jgeorgeson's worked fine
2005-04-25T14:59:00.000Z	delire	alexwillmer	yes, but there's nothing wrong with a pipe. you just used grep badly ;)
