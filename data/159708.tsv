2007-02-12T14:44:00.000Z	fiXXXerMet		I have 2 SATA drives in my machine and I am attempting to install ubuntu 6.10 server.  I create 1 partition on each as raid, and then go to configure raid, which creates a 3rd device (md0).  I make my first partition (/boot) on it, and then it won't allow me to use the rest of the drive.
2007-02-12T14:44:00.000Z	fiXXXerMet		Why is this?
2007-02-12T14:45:00.000Z	fiXXXerMet		1
2007-02-12T14:45:00.000Z	h1st0	fiXXXerMet	are you making the /boot the entire size of the raid?
