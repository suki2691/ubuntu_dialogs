2010-01-22T05:04:00.000Z	mathew		i can't find 256MB NVIDIA GeForce Go 7900 GS drivers for ubuntu
2010-01-22T05:05:00.000Z	aliendude3500	mathew	the open source noveau drivers should be plenty...
2010-01-22T05:06:00.000Z	aliendude3500	mathew	if you have the latest updates, you probably already have open source nvidia drivers installed.
2010-01-22T05:07:00.000Z	aliendude3500	mathew	try this "sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-nouveau" in the terminal. I don't even have an nvidia card, but that might work for you.
