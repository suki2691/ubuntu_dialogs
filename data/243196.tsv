2006-06-16T11:30:00.000Z	j-linux		Has anyone else had a problem with broken Synaptic just after installation? (I think that sudo is the thing that is broken).  I've already reinstalled Dapper 3 times today and am still having the same problem (1st time was ok, second two were broken)
2006-06-16T11:30:00.000Z	hkais	j-linux	what is your problem?
2006-06-16T11:32:00.000Z	j-linux	hkais	I installed Dapper today (erasing my Breezy -- upgrade from scratch).  First time worked, but I wanted to go back and change partitions.  Went back and reinstalled two more times but updates won't start.  I think the problem is with sudo because I get this message when trying sudo: sudo: unable to lookup 272010432842 via gethostbyname()
2006-06-16T11:32:00.000Z	hkais	j-linux	sorry cannot help. I thought it is a deb issue...
