2011-03-05T01:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	drakekin	wubi has issues in itself... no matter the "guest" OS... wubi install are way to fragile imho
2011-03-05T01:04:00.000Z	drakekin	erUSUL	Ah. That might explain why it won't finish installing.
2011-03-05T01:05:00.000Z	drakekin	erUSUL	Could you recommend a guide to dual-boot ubuntu?
