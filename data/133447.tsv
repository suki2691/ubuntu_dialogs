2007-05-22T06:33:00.000Z	Jang1		Hey, can anybody give me an advice on beryl? I use Feisty Fawn and Beryl seems to work just fine until I try to add it to autostart. If I do so and reboot, after logging it would say that the "last session lasted less than 10 seconds and blah-blah" and get me to the logging screen again. Is there a way to fix it? Thanks!

2007-05-22T06:34:00.000Z	Jang1	rococo	yeah that's what i meant
2007-05-22T06:35:00.000Z	Jang1	rococo	it still does not work though :) thanks i'll try another channel
