2007-02-23T08:39:00.000Z	akv2		I just upgraded my workstation from edgy to feisty and now i have a problem with my dualhead setup. I have a ATI x1300 and did a setup with aticonfig --initial=dual-head --server-layout=right. It seems like it's two seperate X servers, i cannot move a application from one screen to an other and the second screen has some problems rendering correct...anyone knows a solution?
