2010-01-16T21:45:00.000Z	meindian523	buttons840	same timings as in?
2010-01-16T21:46:00.000Z	meindian523	buttons840	they need to be of the same generation AFAIK
2010-01-16T21:46:00.000Z	buttons840	meindian523	well, i have an old 512 ram stick in one slot, and i was wondering if i could put in 2 new 1 gig sticks (thus filling 3 of the 4 slots)
