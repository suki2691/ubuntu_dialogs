2010-06-08T20:17:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr		does ubuntu come with a vnc server?
2010-06-08T20:18:00.000Z	ubutom	rafaelsoaresbr	or just install tightvncserver through software center
2010-06-08T20:24:00.000Z	ubutom	rafaelsoaresbr	you will likely have to share the host manually every time, tightvncserver starts automatically on system boot
