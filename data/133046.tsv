2007-11-07T11:55:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	UndertakerX2	well, it's, sort of nautilus, i can't remember. i just inserted a blank CD. when it prompts you about what type of CD you wanna make, choose data, and then just drag in the files. if it's only a single ISO, choose 'burn CD from image' or however that one is phrased
