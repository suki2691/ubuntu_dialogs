2007-11-04T00:57:00.000Z	PirateHead		How do I revert to an earlier version of the Linux kernel? I am experiencing hardware regressions and I want to go back.
2007-11-04T00:58:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	PirateHead	choose it in grub?
2007-11-04T00:58:00.000Z	PirateHead	MilitantPotato	That only works if you have it already installed. I want to install an older version.
2007-11-04T00:58:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	PirateHead	ah, sorry I can't help there.
