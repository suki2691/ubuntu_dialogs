2012-07-16T19:22:00.000Z	auronandace	gitesh	install them and logout then pick them at the login screen
2012-07-16T19:23:00.000Z	auronandace	gitesh	there's unity, gnome3, kde4, xfce, lxde and enlightenment
2012-07-16T19:24:00.000Z	auronandace	gitesh	i like using synaptic, but the software centre or just apt-get would do just fine too
