2012-06-27T01:58:00.000Z	ceed^		I'm running  12.04. After reboot I am not seeing any applications in the HUD, no music files either. I do see files though. How do I get the HUD back to show everything?

2012-06-27T02:00:00.000Z	ceed^	xangua	I mean the dash I guess. Let's say I start writing an application name, there's no results for applications
2012-06-27T02:02:00.000Z	ceed^	xangua	the only applications I can open are the ones in the launcher
