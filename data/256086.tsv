2006-08-20T12:40:00.000Z	BrokenSegue		are there any known issues with the XP ext3 driver, because ubuntu keeps complaining about fs erros on bootup?
2006-08-20T12:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	BrokenSegue	 ive seen a few isues with that as well. I think it depends on how xp closes/reboots/crashes
2006-08-20T12:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	BrokenSegue	 never seen the hd get messed up hpwever.
2006-08-20T12:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	BrokenSegue	 yep. :(
