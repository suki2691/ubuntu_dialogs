2006-06-12T12:24:00.000Z	q0m		question, if you install ubuntu as a client, how do you upgrade it to a server, if at all possible
2006-06-12T12:25:00.000Z	Spec	q0m	server is like a client install, without all the 'crap' that's not needed by a server
2006-06-12T12:25:00.000Z	Spec	q0m	Theoretically you could apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop
2006-06-12T12:26:00.000Z	Spec	q0m	but i would back up any data before you did that
