2006-05-01T05:54:00.000Z	scorchsaber		Hey, I want to install firefox 1.5.0.2, and I was wondering: Should I compile from source, or follow the directions for the default tar.gz that you can download (instructions:https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion)

2006-05-01T05:59:00.000Z	farruinn	scorchsaber	I would go with the the tar.gz - it won't take as long
