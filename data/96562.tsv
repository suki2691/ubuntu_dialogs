2008-03-25T05:19:00.000Z	rbil	kindofabuzz_	do you mean a mount on the client to the nfs share on the server side?
2008-03-25T05:19:00.000Z	kindofabuzz_	rbil	yes
2008-03-25T05:20:00.000Z	rbil	kindofabuzz_	on the client side it's just a mount point, so anything put in there is actually going to go to the share on the server side
