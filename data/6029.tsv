2012-04-06T06:56:00.000Z	skel	thetinyjesus	I like chrome, I used to use firefox and I know this is going to sound stupid but I stopped using it when they started advancing a major version point like every other week
2012-04-06T06:57:00.000Z	thetinyjesus	skel	i like chrome, but i cannot tell if its my imagination or what, but it seems firefox completely loads the website faster where chrome loads the majority faster but takes longer to completely load
2012-04-06T06:58:00.000Z	skel	thetinyjesus	hm yeah I haven't really noticed either way. I do like firefox's plugin system better. Chrome still seems to lack there. I know they've got the market but it seems more geared for games and stuff
