2011-06-02T09:14:00.000Z	kbrown_		well, i'm running ubuntu 11.4 on my laptop, and i'm not able to use the sudo command anymore
2011-06-02T09:14:00.000Z	Loshki	kbrown_	what happens when you run sudo ?
2011-06-02T09:16:00.000Z	Loshki	kbrown_	you're saying you accidentally changed the mode on /etc/sudoers?
