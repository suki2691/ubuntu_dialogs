2007-02-01T07:58:00.000Z	Nontitle		sorry, just curious
2007-02-01T07:59:00.000Z	LjL	Nontitle	nope, swedish... if you're asking about the , no, they're not on the keyboard (not directly, it's altgr+z and altgr+x), i'm just trying to get used to typing them because they're less ambiguous for people when given with commands
