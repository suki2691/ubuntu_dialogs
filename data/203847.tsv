2011-02-20T22:22:00.000Z	mc1		Morning! Anybody can help me with this: I upgraded from Jaunty to Maverick. In this process I lost proprietary display drivers and thus the ability to have 3D and desktop effects and certain windows games I play on Wine and no screen-savers either. The upgrade was through Internet download.
2011-02-20T22:24:00.000Z	vega-	mc1	reinstall them?
2011-02-20T22:25:00.000Z	vega-	mc1	the missing drivers?
2011-02-20T22:27:00.000Z	vega-	mc1	don't know then why they disappeared, you did know that jaunty -> maverick upgrade was not supported?
