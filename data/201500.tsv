2006-01-07T15:27:00.000Z	Tobbe|livecd		Hi. I have two 200gb sata disks (and one 80gb sata). In windows the two 200gb disks appears as one disk because I have them raided with raid1. But in Ubuntu I them as sepperate drives. Why is that?

2006-01-07T15:33:00.000Z	Tobbe|livecd	wizardjames	but I have them connected to the raid controler on my motherboard, I thought that would be hardware raid? Or do you need some kind of raid controler even if you're only doing software raid?
