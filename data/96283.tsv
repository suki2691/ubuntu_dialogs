2009-12-14T21:56:00.000Z	conb123		Why is this configure script telling me that xmms is not installed when i have installed everything it could possibly want look http://pastebin.com/m1f67b548 ?
2009-12-14T21:57:00.000Z	nacitar	conb123	Isn't xmms replaced by something else now, anyway?
2009-12-14T21:57:00.000Z	conb123	nacitar	Well i don't think it's that, here is what the script said http://pastebin.com/m3938ef
2009-12-14T21:59:00.000Z	conb123	nacitar	Should i perhaps set this /home/connor/.config/xmms2 as $XMMS_CONFIG in .bashrc ?
