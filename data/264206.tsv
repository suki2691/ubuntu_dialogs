2004-10-07T15:44:00.000Z	linux_mafia	nick01	try mepis, its debian based, meant to be very good, and kde focused
2004-10-07T15:46:00.000Z	linux_mafia	nick01	well i think you can install kde from universe, but basically this distro is based around gnome, i'm not even sure of kdes completeness in the ubuntu repos
