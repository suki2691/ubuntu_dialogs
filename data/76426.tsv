2010-09-20T23:42:00.000Z	ohad		I'm having a bit of a problem. I have an R60 thinkpad and I'm using lucid (10.04), and the machine keeps getting hot, and when I'm watching flash/youtube sometimes in full-screen it can get extremely hot. it never happened under winxp. I couldn't find an answer in any forum. can someone help me or direct me to somewhere I could get help?
