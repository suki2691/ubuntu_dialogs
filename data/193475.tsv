Now I have it installed, dual boot works, but loading Ubuntu gives me a kernel panic and tells me to load with 'noapic' again. I tried editing the grub menu 'e', including 'noapic' in the command line, but it doesn't save the new command once I go back to the menu 'ESC' and try loading Ubuntu. Always gives me the same APIC kern
