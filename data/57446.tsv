2010-02-14T07:54:00.000Z	bluephase	chalcedony	hi, the problem im having is that when i connect the iphone it just mounts it as a digital camera rather than a drive.  ive checked google and it suggested using sudo ifuse /media/phone but thats not doing anything either?
2010-02-14T07:55:00.000Z	chalcedony	bluephase	i do hope other people here will have had some experience mounting an iphone on ubuntu
