2012-03-01T08:20:00.000Z	c_smith		My Flash Drive shows it is mounted when it is not connected, yet when I connected, it tries to mount a duplicate of it.... is there anything I can do about this?
2012-03-01T08:21:00.000Z	c_smith		and this flash drive is only listed in the sidebar in Nautilus, it's not actually in /media
2012-03-01T08:23:00.000Z	urfr332gO	c_smith	did you add the flash to fstab?
2012-03-01T08:24:00.000Z	urfr332gO	c_smith	it has to be mounted to show in media.
