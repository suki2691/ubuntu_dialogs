2008-09-28T19:41:00.000Z	dougemd		Hey guys, I just installed ubuntu AMD64 and I have 4 gigs of RAM. The OS is registering 3.8 gigs of RAM. I checked my bios and it is properly identifying two 2 gig sticks. I read a lot of stuff on the forums, but never found a good conclusion.
2008-09-28T19:41:00.000Z	dougemd		Is there something I need to change in the kernel. Since, I'm running a 64bit OS I should need PAE correct?
2008-09-28T19:41:00.000Z	ikonia	dougemd	please show me uname -a
2008-09-28T19:41:00.000Z	ikonia	dougemd	you don't need pae
