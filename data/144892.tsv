2007-03-31T09:02:00.000Z	Acanar		I just got an update that says its a distribution upgrade. Does this mean there is a new release of Feisty? Beta 2 maby?
2007-03-31T09:03:00.000Z	Acanar		WaZ, I'm already running Feisty I don't understand what "distribution" i'm upgrading right now
2007-03-31T09:04:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	Acanar	for Feisty support please go to #ubuntu+1
2007-03-31T09:04:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	Acanar	you'll get better help there
