2007-04-21T07:52:00.000Z	mojo		I have a question...  Why is it that I can't seem to get digg.com to load in Firefox but when I try it in Konqueror it works fine?  It will eventually load in ff but only if I retry SEVERAL times.  Very annoying!
2007-04-21T07:52:00.000Z	mojo		Or at least someone give me an idea on what I might check to see where the problem lies
2007-04-21T07:52:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	mojo	shouldn't you ask this to ff devs ?
2007-04-21T07:52:00.000Z	mojo	wickedpuppy	maybe...
