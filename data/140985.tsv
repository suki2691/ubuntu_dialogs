2007-12-18T16:45:00.000Z	NekoKun		Hello folks! Im starting to think about move to ubuntu... but there are few questions that I have: Long ago I used linux (96) and that time we could make good installs all from scratch... But a friend of mine told me that ubuntu requires ~3gb is that it?!
2007-12-18T16:46:00.000Z	void^	NekoKun	the base system is probably around 200-300mb.
2007-12-18T16:48:00.000Z	NekoKun	void^	Is there a way to see, online, the default packages?
2007-12-18T16:50:00.000Z	void^	NekoKun	well, you can probably find a list of software that comes with a full ubuntu installation somewhere on ubuntu.com, if you're actually interested in packages i suppose you can look at the dependencies of ubuntu-desktop, http://packages.ubuntu.com/gutsy/metapackages/ubuntu-desktop
