2011-02-24T15:10:00.000Z	samitheberber	tryagainplss	what kind of help do you need?
2011-02-24T15:14:00.000Z	samitheberber	tryagainplss	I'm not sure if XChat can provide IRC-server, but there are some other software, which do that
2011-02-24T15:16:00.000Z	samitheberber	tryagainplss	like ardchoille told, you can't do that with XChat
