2009-02-02T10:16:00.000Z	emsenn		I'm building a custom liveusb, and am wondering if there is any way to force ubuntu, via boot parameters, to look in a nonstandard directory for /casper/filesystem.squashfs
2009-02-02T10:16:00.000Z	emsenn		Its most likely been raided and/or shut down again, skeebo
2009-02-02T10:16:00.000Z	emsenn		But there's nothing certain yet
2009-02-02T10:17:00.000Z	skeebo	emsenn	thanks
