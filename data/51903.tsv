2009-11-02T05:27:00.000Z	Stevoisiak		Ok. I don't like the default "Arcade" icon in Ubuntu, so I downloaded a .png file from the web to use as an Icon. I'd like to move it into the icons folder to keep thinks organized. I tryed using the terminal as Sudo to move the file, but it keeps saying the file or folder doesn't exist even though it is on the desktop, and I copied and pasted the exact file name into the terminal. How can I move the .PNG file into the folder without act
