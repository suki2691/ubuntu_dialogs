2012-01-09T23:57:00.000Z	Vinzent		Hello. I have a problem with compiz "Place window" plugin. I have a rule for pidgin (match string is "class=Pidgin"), but its roster opens on the current workspace instead of specified one. 'xprop WM_CLASS' for the roster window returns 'Piding'. Also note that chat window opens on the correct workspace. Any ideas?
2012-01-09T23:58:00.000Z	Vinzent		Is there a unity-specific channel?

2012-01-10T00:02:00.000Z	Vinzent	theadmin	well, then I'll try to ask later again
