2006-12-17T07:24:00.000Z	Erb		Hi, how do I open GVim? I installed it but it didn't appear in the Applications menu (I am obviously new to Linux).
2006-12-17T07:24:00.000Z	Ralith	Erb	if it's really not in the menu, hit alt-f2 and enter 'gvim' and hit return
2006-12-17T07:26:00.000Z	Erb	Ralith	thanks, that worked, however, is there a way so that GVim can be included as a shortcut?
