2008-05-24T23:33:00.000Z	rym		I just updated my ubuntu version to 8.04, now grub shows me two ubuntu installs, both 8.04
2008-05-24T23:34:00.000Z	rym		one with the new kernel, one with the old one
2008-05-24T23:34:00.000Z	rym		i can edit the grub loader, thats not a problem. But is it normal for ubuntu to do this ?
