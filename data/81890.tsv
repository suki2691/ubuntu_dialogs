2012-08-21T12:56:00.000Z	monkey_	ix_	I have resized and moved some partitions on my hdd and now I cannot boot(i don't get grub), i have "fixed it" with boot-repair to place grub somewhere else on harddrive and now I am able to boot only windows ( I have dual boot win 7 and ubuntu) but after few trials I have successfully installed grub on usb stick and i can boot to ubuntu with my usB :) (kinda stupid ;) ) and now since I am ubuntu I have tried to reinstall grub to my /dev/sda with grub-ins
