2009-04-04T15:29:00.000Z	guest_visitor		I have a serious problem: much (not all) of the system text have been replaced by squares (black border, white inside). I have tried rebooting several times. It's not just my user, its the same thing for the label text when logging in.

2009-04-04T15:31:00.000Z	guest_visitor	geffen	No, it happend after a normal reboot
2009-04-04T15:31:00.000Z	geffen	guest_visitor	Try to post on ubuntu forums ... maybe someone had the same problem before !
