2009-09-12T05:16:00.000Z	Addicts		Rookie question: im getting a new hard drive and I want to format it in ext4, is there a tool in default ubuntu to do that?
2009-09-12T05:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Addicts	ok Ext4 is  great, the fast boot up, the fast shut down, the fast disk checking, thing is in 9.04 it's not great overall, because of the kernel they have and that
2009-09-12T05:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Addicts	9.10 will have that kind of stuff sorted out,  because it uses Ext4 by default :)
2009-09-12T05:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Addicts	I never had any issues persoanlly with Ext4 in 9.04, but some people get for example  some kind of lock up issue when deleting big files from such a partition
