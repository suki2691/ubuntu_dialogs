2008-05-04T20:33:00.000Z	luca		Hi, I have a problem with ubuntu 8.04 and evolution-data-server. This package send the cpu to the 100% of use.....
2008-05-04T20:34:00.000Z	luca		someone knows a solution?
2008-05-04T20:35:00.000Z	stbain	luca	any error messages? Also, did you ask in #evolution?
2008-05-04T20:36:00.000Z	stbain	luca	kill it then. If you're not using Evolution, I'm going to guess you probably don't need the data server
