2010-03-25T02:17:00.000Z	Typos_King	Madwill	   java home?   or jvm home?
2010-03-25T02:23:00.000Z	Typos_King	Madwill	   java home?     that will be a TOMCAT  variable you have to set I gather.... anyway usually java home is at -> /usr/lib/jvm/java-X-sun-1.XXXXXX/bin     on those XXX version number is where the java symlink to the binaries are
