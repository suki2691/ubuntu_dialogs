2011-04-18T23:55:00.000Z	itilious		i'm trying to make ASLA my default audio instead of pulseaudio and the guide i'm using calls to extract into that folder, but it doesnt exist
2011-04-18T23:56:00.000Z	LjL	itilious	i'm not sure it's supposed to exist before it gets created by something in the first place. anyway, just create it?
2011-04-18T23:57:00.000Z	LjL	itilious	how's about you just type "sudo mkdir /usr/local/bin" before the tar part?
