2010-03-18T03:24:00.000Z	henkpoley	Soul_Sample	personally I just gave up about that, there are about 3 or 4 systems in parallel setting cpufreq

2010-03-18T03:25:00.000Z	Soul_Sample	henkpoley	i know, it's really bugging me. the default is "ondemand", and it's not doing it for me, i would liek to make it 100%, BUT since I have 4 cores i have to use 4 cpu applets and it looks messy and unnecessary :S
