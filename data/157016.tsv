2006-11-26T11:08:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Nemesis2	its good its not being used :) You want full use of RAM (RAM is faster than swap). If you swap is being hit a lot, your system will slow down.
2006-11-26T11:10:00.000Z	Nemesis2	fyrestrtr	i remember swap being used before. I have 700 MB of ram. Is this normal swap not being used?
2006-11-26T11:11:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Nemesis2	yes. Swap is only used when RAM is full and programs ask for RAM, then it 'swaps out' RAM to the disk.
