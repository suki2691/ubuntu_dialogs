2008-01-02T01:55:00.000Z	chimp		I had set up a new install of ubuntu on my familys puter, and had created an account for my little bro, i had sort of set up my account upwith stuff he needed, so i figured that i would delete his account, and change my username and home directory. to his. This has now made it impossible to log in as it says the home folder has the wrong attributes. How can i fix this considering i cant log in as root?
