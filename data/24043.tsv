2011-10-14T09:38:00.000Z	yagoo	Reallycool	probably one of the default themes..
2011-10-14T09:41:00.000Z	Reallycool	yagoo	changing UI themes does nothing at all
2011-10-14T09:42:00.000Z	yagoo	Reallycool	 u can probably copy a non-modified theme from /usr/share (not sure exactly).. and copy it back into your themes folder..
