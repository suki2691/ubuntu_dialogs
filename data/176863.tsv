2012-06-27T17:13:00.000Z	etfb		Here's a question to introduce /dev/cat to /dev/pigeons: on my brand new i7-3770, currently running Windows 7 64-bit, should I install Ubuntu 32-bit or 64-bit edition?
2012-06-27T17:13:00.000Z	etfb		If it helps, I mainly use Emacs, Firefox and VMWare Player.

2012-06-27T17:17:00.000Z	fidel	etfb	well 64 bit then
