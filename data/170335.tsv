2006-09-10T05:51:00.000Z	SirKillalot		am I able to CONTINUE a file copy process with "cp" or some other program when the copy process was interrupted the time before?
2006-09-10T05:51:00.000Z	SirKillalot		I want to copy a big file from Cdrom to my HDD
2006-09-10T05:51:00.000Z	SirKillalot		it already copied 80% and crashed, I do not want to start the copy process once again, but continue it
2006-09-10T05:52:00.000Z	lupine_85	SirKillalot	maybe try wget -c file:// ?
