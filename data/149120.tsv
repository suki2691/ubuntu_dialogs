2008-07-02T05:06:00.000Z	dolags32128		my xserver keeps restarting when i hit backspace to delete a whole line of text i'm using hardy any tips?
2008-07-02T05:07:00.000Z	unop	dolags32128	are you sure you aren't pressing CTRL+ALT by mistake/intention when hitting backspace ?
2008-07-02T05:09:00.000Z	unop	dolags32128	two things could be wrong -- one, your ctrl+alt keys might be stuck down (faulty keyboard) -- two, firefox is somehow crashing so bad it causes X to quit ? so question, does the backspace problem manifest itself in other applications other than firefox?
