2005-01-29T14:52:00.000Z	^jude^		can someone advise me? is it possible to run ubuntu with KDE? I really don't like the gnome interface, but I'm interested in trying ubuntu...
2005-01-29T14:53:00.000Z	Omoshiroi	^jude^	you could install KDE I suppose.
2005-01-29T14:53:00.000Z	^jude^	Omoshiroi	Yeah, I supposed the same - I was hoping to chat with someone who had actually done it :)
