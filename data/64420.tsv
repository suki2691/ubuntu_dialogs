2009-03-05T19:10:00.000Z	Naraht		So, I don't know is anyone can help, but it looks like my Ubuntu installation on the other PC is toast.  I no longer have sudo access, boot is hanging looking for nonexisitant groups...I don't know what's going on, but I can't use the computer now...
2009-03-05T19:10:00.000Z	n8tuserf	Naraht	-> use your livecd to repair it
2009-03-05T19:12:00.000Z	n8tuserf	Naraht	-> its not an automatic repair, "repair" i meant is generic term,
2009-03-05T19:35:00.000Z	Naraht	n8tuserf	I guess I'm off to "repair" which at this point looks to involve me backing up my /home directory and completely reinstalling the OS.  gg.
