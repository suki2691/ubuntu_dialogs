2007-08-18T12:11:00.000Z	bergman		hey i would have a question about taking off ubuntu and putting on xubuntu. the boot menu and how its done formatting off linix
2007-08-18T12:12:00.000Z	bergman		good question but i usualy like to format
2007-08-18T12:12:00.000Z	bergman		i don't just want to put the files on
2007-08-18T12:13:00.000Z	velko	bergman	if you install xubuntu from the livecd the partition will be formatted anyway. i don't wanted it but the installer is currently unable to do any better
