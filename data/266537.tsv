2010-11-02T14:13:00.000Z	StaRetji1		Ubuntu was booting and in between I had power loss. Now, Grub offers me prompt, but actually never times out? Wtf? I mean, shouldn't it autoboot after 30 seconds or something?
2010-11-02T14:14:00.000Z	StaRetji1		I don't have keyboard as it is HTPC, but I will get it. The thing is, I want to avoid this next time, I would just like to autoboot after some timeout.\
