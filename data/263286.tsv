2007-02-12T12:58:00.000Z	Richi1		I need to burn an iso asap and i'm struggling
2007-02-12T12:59:00.000Z	Richi1		i tried gnomebaker but that doesn't load properly it just crashes, can't use k3b because no kde, and cd/dvd creator gives an error
2007-02-12T13:00:00.000Z	Sanne	Richi1	you can install k3b in Gnome (it just installs some additional kde libs)
