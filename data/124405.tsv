2007-08-18T10:57:00.000Z	bruenig	DaBeowulf	mplayer in virtual console with ascii
2007-08-18T10:59:00.000Z	DaBeowulf	bruenig	then I'd have output in ASCII? Okay a bit more heavyweight to play them proper would be appreciated.
2007-08-18T10:59:00.000Z	bruenig	DaBeowulf	the ascii is not too bad, and very lightweight for sure
