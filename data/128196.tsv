2008-03-28T19:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	Optimus55	define recover you nedd some files? is the filesystem corrupt or the partition table?
2008-08-31T01:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	Optimus55	too large an answer for irc i guess ... but basically (simplifying too much )windows has the gui included in the kernel (to make it faster) linux has not and many other details
2008-08-31T01:57:00.000Z	Optimus55	erUSUL	thanks man. from that little bit i can understand why. any more info? a website link or sum?
