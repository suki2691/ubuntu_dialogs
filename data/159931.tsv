2006-11-08T13:22:00.000Z	Jibbler		i couldn't find anything about installing 6.10 under MS Virtual PC, but i can't install it because the graphics go corrupt.  any tips?
2006-11-08T13:22:00.000Z	variant	Jibbler	ask in #microsoft
2006-11-08T13:23:00.000Z	Jibbler	variant	i figured this would be a more sensible place, seeing as the wiki has instructons on getting 6.06 to work...
2006-11-08T13:24:00.000Z	variant	Jibbler	well, graphics corruption is most likley to be an issue with virtual pc rather than ubuntu.. what graphics device does virtual pc emulate?
