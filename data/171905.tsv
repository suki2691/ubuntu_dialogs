2007-10-20T05:58:00.000Z	redrumloa		Question: Is there known problems with Nvidia cards in Gutsy?
2007-10-20T05:59:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	redrumloa	I haven't experienced any. I'm not sure about the black window bug though...give me a sec to test that theory
2007-10-20T06:01:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	redrumloa	nope, black windows bug is gone.
