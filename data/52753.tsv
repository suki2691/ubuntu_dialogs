2009-07-20T21:18:00.000Z	cfm		Hi, I've just installed my first 64-bit Ubuntu (8.04.03), and apt-get update is failing with a Hash Sum Mismatch.  Is this a 64-bit thing that I need to configure differently, or a transient error that will likely be fixed tomorrow?
2009-07-20T21:20:00.000Z	Mud|brb	cfm	strange error, never got it before
2009-07-20T21:20:00.000Z	Mud|brb	cfm	: did you try to google the error ?
2009-07-20T21:21:00.000Z	cfm	Mud|brb	Yes, there's a few hits from March that pointed to a problem that would be fixed soon, but nothing recent.
