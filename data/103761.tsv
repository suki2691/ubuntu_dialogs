2009-09-10T17:49:00.000Z	Tutunkommon		Problem:  Trying to do an apt-get install linux-headers-2.6.28-15-server  so I can try out the VMWare player.  I am unable to connect to archive.ubuntu.com or security.ubuntu.com which causes the install to fail.  I can ping google, but pinging security.ubuntu.com fails as well
2009-09-10T17:51:00.000Z	Tutunkommon		odd.  ping isn't dropping the packets, it is just sitting there
2009-09-10T17:52:00.000Z	Tutunkommon		right.  I was just letting it sit to see if it snapped out of it at some point.
