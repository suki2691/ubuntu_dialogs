2007-02-17T11:59:00.000Z	boredandblogging	tabman	I just wanted to see what the hoopla was with beryl...I have yet to even see Vista in action
2007-02-17T12:01:00.000Z	tabman	boredandblogging	no i'm not asking you I'm asking in general I saw beryl related question yesterday as well, its like all the OS community now realizing after vista that they want 3d interfaces
2007-02-17T12:03:00.000Z	boredandblogging	tabman	competition is natural...everyone wants the coolest toys!
