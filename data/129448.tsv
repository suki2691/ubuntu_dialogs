2007-10-18T22:42:00.000Z	adante		hi folks, i need to clean up some space in my /boot, is it safe to delete the  vmlinuz-2.6.20-15-generic initrd.img-2.6.20-15-generic files?

2007-10-18T22:44:00.000Z	adante	pike_	oh okay, thanks
2007-10-18T22:44:00.000Z	adante	pike_	i'll leave it to things smarter than me (synaptic) then :P
