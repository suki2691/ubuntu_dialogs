2010-09-07T10:33:00.000Z	alkemann		im having really big issues getting this Nvidia X Server settings to behave. Changing setups I get this "apply what is possible" bull, but im still not able to get the monitors up. and also it lacks the option to turn the monitor 90 degrees. Is there a better option to use ?
2010-09-07T10:34:00.000Z	alkemann		or how do i restart the x server in lucid?
