2007-01-25T17:04:00.000Z	MoxJet		ok that's better, I now have my old keyboard layout and 1600x1200 res and so on
2007-01-25T17:05:00.000Z	MoxJet		what does a (EE) xf86OpenSerial: Cannot open /dev/wacom: No such file or directory error message when doing startx mean? I get six of them. How can I fix it?
2007-01-25T17:06:00.000Z	pbureau	MoxJet	 have you tried to create the directory in question ?
2007-01-25T17:07:00.000Z	MoxJet	pbureau	no I did not... isn't it to be filled with lots of interesting and mysterious files?
