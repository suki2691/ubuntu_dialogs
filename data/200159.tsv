2010-12-23T05:45:00.000Z	Ken	SuperLag	I can't speak for everyone but I have a laptop with a Nvidia and i've never had graphic card issues.
2010-12-23T05:46:00.000Z	SuperLag	Ken	I'm looking for a dual-head card that I can put in a 64-bit Ubuntu desktop
2010-12-23T05:47:00.000Z	Ken	SuperLag	For what it counts in a lot of tutorials that state things like, "This may not work if you have an ATI card" etc. Nvidia seems to be the way to go but don't rely solely on my advice. Some (rare) gaming and Compiz are about as hard as I push my laptop.
