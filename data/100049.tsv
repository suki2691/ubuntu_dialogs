2008-02-17T18:05:00.000Z	aeleon		ok- I've set a VPN up with my ubuntu box being the server and a vista client. So when I try to run utorrent on it, it doesn't seem to get past like 15Kb on avg, though my upload is quite fierce, and I am apparently "not connectable: a firewall/router is limiting my network traffic". My ports are open and all that; could it be ubuntu's firewall?

2008-02-17T18:09:00.000Z	aeleon	peppers	don't mean to press, but in case you didn't see, my vpn is over tcp. my place here in the uk blocks udp.
2008-02-17T18:10:00.000Z	peppers	aeleon	dunno sorry. I thought it could be a problem with the client to host connection but I don't know anymore
