I am trying to use the shared to other computers option for my wired connection to share my 3g connection in Ubuntu 10.04, but when I use this setting my wired connection refuses to connect. I previously had a problem where the connection would connect and reconnect and I google searched it and fixed the problem been dnsmasq, there is an official bug registered with solutio

I click to connect the wired connection and it says wired network disconnected. I am using this method of sharing the internet over many other computers with different distro version
