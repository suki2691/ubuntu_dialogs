2011-10-15T06:02:00.000Z	aioe		so is there any hope for gnome users in the future or should we just use natty until the end of time? heh
2011-10-15T06:03:00.000Z	xangua	aioe	unity runs on top of gnome if that is what you ask
2011-10-15T06:03:00.000Z	aioe		also can someone familiarize me (debian user) with the ubuntu bts, cause from my brief preview of 11.10 today I have a mile long list of bugs against various gnome components
2011-10-15T06:04:00.000Z	aioe	xangua	yeah but I'm talking about people who know what a computer is and aren't mentally challenged and dont use unity
