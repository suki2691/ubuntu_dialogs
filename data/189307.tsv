2009-05-17T19:08:00.000Z	coz_	vinview	 have you checked online for any ubuntu how to 's or references?
2009-05-17T19:10:00.000Z	coz_	vinview	 from what I am reading clearcase doesnt support ubuntu   you might want to use clearcase web or clearcase remote client
2009-05-17T19:10:00.000Z	coz_	vinview	 clearcase remote client is eclipse based  so if you use eclipse IDE  you can try clearcase remote cliente
