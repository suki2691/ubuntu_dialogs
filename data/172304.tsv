2006-08-03T16:05:00.000Z	_Spire_		Any help with this? "The default theme schemas could not be found on your system.  This means that you probably don't have metacity installed, or that your gconf is configured incorrectly"
2006-08-03T16:05:00.000Z	_Spire_		That happens when I try to launch the theme manager in gnome
2006-08-03T16:05:00.000Z	LeetWanker	_Spire_	have you tried installing Metacity?
2006-08-03T16:06:00.000Z	_Spire_	LeetWanker	I'll try that :P
