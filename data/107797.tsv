2008-01-05T09:04:00.000Z	Leechzilla		I need to install the latest version of smartdimmer, but when I try to uninstall the one I have already, it says acpi-support* powermanagement-interface* and ubuntu-desktop* will also be removed. What do I do to install it?

2008-01-05T09:05:00.000Z	Leechzilla	PurpZeY	I don't need it?
2008-01-05T09:05:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Leechzilla	Perhaps nickrud can verify that, but as I understand it ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage sometimes when taking out other packages it gets removed and it is incidental
