2006-06-19T15:46:00.000Z	phanter	rahul84	standard there is a program installed that can handle them to download
2006-06-19T15:47:00.000Z	phanter	rahul84	or what is your specific question?
2006-06-19T15:48:00.000Z	phanter	rahul84	maybe that is because the upload of your seeders is not big enough. Is not neccesarily because of the program you use
