2010-05-09T17:25:00.000Z	ravenkhan	airtonix	yeah wubi using live cd
2010-05-09T17:25:00.000Z	airtonix	ravenkhan	is is possible install ubuntu normally by booting the computer from the livecd instead ?
2010-05-09T17:28:00.000Z	airtonix	ravenkhan	i would just like to point out that ubuntu installed via wubi is handicapped.
