2011-12-31T22:41:00.000Z	KoltMaesta		Hi! Approximately a week after I upgraded to 11.10 my wifi sometimes keeps connecting and nothing happens. The network is still ok, I just wont connect, and it takes forever. Most of the time it works great. What can cause this annoying issue?

2011-12-31T22:44:00.000Z	KoltMaesta	Seveas	There are a lot of "... [    1.748118] [Firmware Bug]: ACPI: BIOS _OSI(Linux) query ignored" lines
