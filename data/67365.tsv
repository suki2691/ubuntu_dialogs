2009-11-11T21:52:00.000Z	Halitech	rashed2020	did you try the instructions here? http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/Tech/font-howto.html
2009-11-11T21:55:00.000Z	rashed2020	Halitech	I did. No use.
2009-11-11T21:56:00.000Z	rashed2020	Halitech	I did have a few modifications to it though as I'm trying to install it as a system wide font. So I dropped it in /usr/share/fonts/bitmaps
2009-11-11T21:58:00.000Z	Halitech	rashed2020	try it in the home folder and see if it works there
