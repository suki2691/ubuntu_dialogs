2006-05-01T11:38:00.000Z	IceTox		I think I've tried like every tip possible, but still I can't get my layout for norwegian.. I'm not able to write the three extra characters (letters) that we have in our langugage, nor does the previous keyboard shortcuts I set while installing work.. Do you guys think about anything I might have missed? I've edited /etc/X11/xorg.conf and I've tried editing it with the keyboard manger thingie on the menu.

2006-05-01T11:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	IceTox	once every ten minutes or so might be OK
