2009-02-20T08:06:00.000Z	Mooch		why is the support so short for Ubuntu 8.10
2009-02-20T08:07:00.000Z	rww	Mooch	You mean the 18 month support period? because it's not a Long Term Support release
2009-02-20T08:08:00.000Z	rww	Mooch	Ubuntu 8.10 was released in October. It'll be supported until April 2010 (18 months).
