2008-03-16T22:14:00.000Z	PMantis		I want to create a DEB package of 3-4 files, but all the howto's talk about tarred up source code, compiling, etc. Where's a *simple* howto for my needs?
2008-03-16T22:14:00.000Z	Fryguy--	PMantis	what do you want to create a .deb file for
2008-03-16T22:16:00.000Z	PMantis	Fryguy--	To distribute a handful of scripts to my clients' servers with the ability to update them with apt when I update the scripts.
2008-03-16T22:17:00.000Z	PMantis	Fryguy--	I hate having to scp the scripts to each server when I update them, and have to remember which one I udated, etc.
