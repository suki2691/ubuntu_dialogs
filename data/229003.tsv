2008-02-02T07:32:00.000Z	dman	theshadow	look at the disk. it might have a read-only switch that could have gotten pushed over.
2008-02-02T07:32:00.000Z	theshadow	dman	I checked that its not
2008-02-02T07:33:00.000Z	dman	theshadow	i don't know then. ubuntu doesn't usually mount read-only unless there is filesystem damage.
