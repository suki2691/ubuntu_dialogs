2008-03-23T11:35:00.000Z	Smegzor		When I created my ubuntu login, I elected to have my home directory viewable by others.  Now I've changed my mind, but I'd like shared folders in my home dir accessible.  Where do I change this?
2008-03-23T11:36:00.000Z	Smegzor		yep
2008-03-23T11:37:00.000Z	Smegzor		well how would I hide the contents of my home dir?
