2009-01-24T04:33:00.000Z	Jun		I have a question. Do I have to wait or can I just ask?
2009-01-24T04:35:00.000Z	Jun		Ok, I keep trying to update my software on my EEE PC, which is currently running ubuntu. But every time I do, I get this: E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem. E: _cache->open() failed, please report.
2009-01-24T04:36:00.000Z	Jun		Then when I go to run that, I get this weird message.
