2006-06-06T05:12:00.000Z	czer323		I'm having issues with Firefox 1.5.0.3 quitting unexpectedly.  No error messages.  Happens every time when I try to view my gmail inbox.  I tried a new user account and it has the same issue, so I know it's not preference related.  Is there a log that would be created that I could check?

2006-06-06T05:13:00.000Z	czer323		I can try, but i did a new user, which has no default extensions.  I'll try terminal.
