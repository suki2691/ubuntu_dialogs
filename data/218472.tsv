2005-11-24T06:17:00.000Z	tgwj	mahangu	what file system ? you'll probably need a live cd
2005-11-24T06:18:00.000Z	mahangu	tgwj	i have partition magic on my windows side, but will that wreck ubuntu?
2005-11-24T06:20:00.000Z	tgwj	mahangu	I don't know anything about partition magic. but if it resites correctly and keeps the partition no. there hould be no problem
