2005-11-08T17:31:00.000Z	calamari		is there an ubuntu package search to find out which package a file comes from?
2005-11-08T08:18:00.000Z	calamari		is it possible to delete a password?  I'd like to make it so there is no root password, so that it's not possible to log in a root (just sudo)
2005-11-08T08:20:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	calamari	there is no root password by default..
2006-05-27T14:48:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	calamari	I'd suggest ps -ax  and look for something that looks like gnome-copy and kill the PID of that..
