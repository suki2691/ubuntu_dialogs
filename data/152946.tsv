2008-05-22T15:34:00.000Z	Sarah		im having trouble getting mythtv installed, when i go through the backend setup it just has about 3 screens then says cant connect to database... and i did a bunch of things that i found on various sites but i always get an error saying access denied for user 'mythtv'@'localhost'

2008-05-22T15:36:00.000Z	user___	Sarah	i remember another person yesterday also had mysql-mythtv problems. i suggest checking their latest forum entries and bug reports.. quite likely you will find a solution in the mythtv communty
2008-05-22T15:40:00.000Z	user___	Sarah	thats also fine ;-)
