2011-10-05T12:26:00.000Z	Velshtein		Aaaand we have an interesting update to my little issue:
2011-10-05T12:26:00.000Z	Velshtein		Drive appears in the BIOS during a cold boot. When I try to boot my linux partition, it hangs on loading cmain(). If I do a standard reboot, the drive disappears in the BIOS.
2011-10-05T12:27:00.000Z	Velshtein		On a whim, I booted from a LiveCD. Lo and behold, when I try to access /dev/sda I get the lovely "Permission denied"
