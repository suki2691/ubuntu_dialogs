2008-12-08T14:23:00.000Z	dukenukem		i am trying to install wireless. i downloaded the linux drivers from the manufacturers website (tp-link). i *think* i installed the drivers by cd'ing to the drivers and "make" "make instal"-ing it. it did its thing, then said the drivers are "restricted". should i give up and try ndiswrapper or should i persevere?
2008-12-08T14:25:00.000Z	dukenukem		hmm. okay. uhm. is there a way i can tell what drivers i have installed?
2008-12-08T14:25:00.000Z	dukenukem		wireless.
