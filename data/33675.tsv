2011-02-11T18:12:00.000Z	jrib	droopal	it's easier to just create a new user and copy over your data
2011-02-11T18:13:00.000Z	droopal	jrib	How do I do that? Wouldnt that mean using up a lot of the disc space, doubling up everything?
2011-02-11T18:13:00.000Z	jrib	droopal	well, move instead of copy then (make sure you chown to the new user)
