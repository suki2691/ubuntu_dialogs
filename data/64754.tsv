2011-01-22T12:20:00.000Z	Yohko		anybody have any idea how I can make a partition that both windows and linux can share?
2011-01-22T12:20:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Yohko	format it NTFS or FAT
2011-01-22T12:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Yohko	yes - but i'm not a fan of NTFS at all (still not ideal compared with a native file system)
2011-01-22T12:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Yohko	BUT i understand your need
