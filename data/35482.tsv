2010-03-27T05:42:00.000Z	Uboss	switch10	and go back to 2 speakers again?
2010-03-27T05:43:00.000Z	switch10	Uboss	sorry, I missed the first part of your question.  But if you type alsamixer into terminal, there are many settings to mess with as well
2010-03-27T05:43:00.000Z	switch10	Uboss	mostly along the lines of volume
