2010-01-14T20:07:00.000Z	Threetimes		Hi, I want to buy a laptop with a "Multi Gesture pad". Can I use it in Ubuntu? The laptop is a Packard Bell Easynote TR87 DT-029

2010-01-14T20:08:00.000Z	Threetimes	APERSON	you're sure it will work? where will it work?
2010-01-14T20:08:00.000Z	APERSON	Threetimes	all handled by drivers: ie, the gesture support is limited to the operating system that comes with the laptop
