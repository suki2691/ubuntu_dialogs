2011-12-31T04:08:00.000Z	DDeveryday		Is there any other way to make a bootable usb drive besides the prefered way on UBuntu website??? That didn't work for me.

2011-12-31T04:09:00.000Z	DDeveryday	Jordan_U	when i tried to boot into the usb drive, it shows "No Operating System found", and on another computer it shows a flashing "_"
