2006-09-02T14:22:00.000Z	Girth		i just installed ubuntu.I already had windows installed so I had to change the partition size and everything but that all went fine. after it was finished installing I rebooted and expected to see grub pop up but I get nothing but a straight boot to windows. anyone know how to fix this?
