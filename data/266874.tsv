2009-10-04T19:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	GoodGuy43	 check the package manager - i recall seeing several variants on 'basic' in there
2009-10-04T19:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	GoodGuy43	 you never said what you want to do with the basic.. theres a HUGE range of basics...
2009-10-04T19:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	GoodGuy43	 and if you wanted to. you could use dosbox and run dos  and dos basic in it.
