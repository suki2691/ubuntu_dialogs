2005-01-11T14:42:00.000Z	yorhel		help! I just did a dist-upgrade to hoary, but it stopped updating and complains about kdelibs-data, which can't be unpacked :(
2005-01-11T14:43:00.000Z	yorhel		is there a way to skip that package, since I only need it for k3b, AFAIK
2005-01-11T14:44:00.000Z	yorhel		I know k3b depends on kdelibs, but I dont need k3b now...
2005-01-11T14:44:00.000Z	davyd	yorhel	you could remove it
