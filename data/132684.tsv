2008-12-18T08:56:00.000Z	firefly2442		I just did a clean install of 8.10 and am getting a grub error 2 (I did the clean install to try to fix a grub error 15), I'm thinking it might be a dying HD as they are really old, are there any tools that will rigorously test all 3 HDs off a live-cd?

2008-12-18T08:58:00.000Z	firefly2442	fryguy	does the ubuntu live-cd have anything built in?
2008-12-18T08:58:00.000Z	fryguy	firefly2442	nothing as good as the manufacturer tools
