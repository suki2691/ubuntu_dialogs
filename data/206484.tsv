2005-11-24T11:49:00.000Z	ClamIAm	navarone	this isn't something that can be fixed with that.  the keyboard is responding strange compared to other distros...sometimes a key is dropped or letters get transposed
2005-11-24T11:54:00.000Z	ClamIAm	navarone	don't worry about it, any insight is appreciated
2005-11-24T11:55:00.000Z	ClamIAm	navarone	 i'm thinking it has something to do with the way ubuntu tries to config it...because this laptop has had fedora, debian and suse on it and they all work fine
