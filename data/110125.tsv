2009-08-22T04:38:00.000Z	ikonia	douglask	no - you need a 3rd party to sign it
2009-08-22T04:38:00.000Z	ikonia	douglask	you can use self signed though
2009-08-22T04:39:00.000Z	douglask	ikonia	I figured, but I figured I'd ask as well.  Ah well.  Not gonna spend the dough just now, so self signed it is.
