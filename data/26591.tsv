2011-09-27T21:15:00.000Z	glebihan	woody_	you can find plenty of free proxies on google to make such tests
2011-09-27T21:20:00.000Z	glebihan	woody_	not proxies how to, just that you can find plenty of free proxy services where you only have to put the address you want to connect to and see if it works
