2009-08-01T20:43:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	Micheil	on many packages you can read that canonical does not provide updates for them
2009-08-01T20:44:00.000Z	Micheil	cyberghoser1	hmm.. still, surely where they have svn repos they'd be setup to automatically update?
2009-08-01T20:44:00.000Z	cyberghoser1	Micheil	don't really know about that
