2006-08-17T09:10:00.000Z	dasGewitter	shawnr_	while there are a lot of problems with frostwire, I hate to be frivolous, but I suggest Limewire
2006-08-17T09:14:00.000Z	dasGewitter	shawnr_	yes, but it runs a lot faster and smoother
2006-08-17T09:16:00.000Z	shawnr_	dasGewitter	so Limewire... any others thats as good as frostwire i can try out?
