2008-12-12T18:07:00.000Z	theDtTvB2`CZ		Hello.. I have Ubuntu running for a long time and it gets slower and slower... I tried creating a new user and it's fast like newly installed... How can I make my existing user fast like new user?

2008-12-12T18:08:00.000Z	joaopinto	theDtTvB2`CZ	removing all settings is equivalent to creating a new user.. you already did that...
