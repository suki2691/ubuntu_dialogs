2004-10-19T09:37:00.000Z	Jaramin		in the same line of thought as grue_, I don't think doing sudo all the time ia a good answer, it's tedious. I'm learning linux, I want to be able to fiddle with things easily. Coming from the windows world, I'm used to have all permissions on my machine...
2004-10-19T09:37:00.000Z	Jaramin		so, is there a way to grant priviliges to a user so that he can edit any files he sees in nautilus?

2004-10-19T09:38:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	Jaramin	and there's a root shell menu option: Applications->System Tools->Root Terminal
