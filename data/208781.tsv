2009-11-24T23:03:00.000Z	Gunnar		How can i "discover" printers over a network?  I mean I dont have their ip address nor name
2009-11-24T23:04:00.000Z	Gunnar		Hmm... i tried that and got nothing but gave me the option of selecting a network printer if i knew the name of it
2009-11-24T23:04:00.000Z	Gunnar		I guess its a later time problem
