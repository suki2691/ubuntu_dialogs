2004-11-25T10:52:00.000Z	Xenguy		Hi - I'm trying to improve the screen resolution (it is currently defaulted to 61Hz - blechh), so I've edited /etc/X11/XFConfig-4 and increased the values for Horizontal and Vertical refresh rate (I tried to adjust the 'Screen Resolution' via the GNOME GUI tool, but it had only 1 value -- 61 -- and would not allow me to change anything).  Is the approach I'm taking correct?
