2011-12-24T20:05:00.000Z	bonita		guys, I switched to ubuntu11.10 and that's where I could start a long christmass story, but what I wanna know is, how can I add another language. In 10.04, it was simple, I added it and I could switch between them by clicking an icon on the top panel. How can I do it in 11th?
