2009-02-07T03:54:00.000Z	plazia		can someone tell me if there is a known problem with firefox being so slow and unresponsive in terms of GUI rendering/redrawn (not network) and if it's a conflict with the nvidia display driver or something? every other gtk app is fine. but the menus in firefox are taking the proverbial pee.
2009-02-07T03:55:00.000Z	plazia		I ran xp inside virtualbox.. and the firefox in that was more responsive and that was a virtual machine!

2009-02-07T03:57:00.000Z	plazia	crdlb	yeah I kinda figured. I know it seems to render some gtk widgets since when I change gtk theme it changes accordignly in firefox but it might just be tracking the theme change. it's just really frustrating me.
