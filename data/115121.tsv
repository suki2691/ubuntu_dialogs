2007-10-26T11:08:00.000Z	Nallep		I'm looking for help with a problem in Nautilus.  When I click on a shell script and it asks me if I want to Run in Terminal or Display, and I click Display, nothing happens.  I can right click the file and open in a text editor, but I want to get the Display button working, what's the point of the Display button if it's broken?
