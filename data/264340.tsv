2005-04-16T15:03:00.000Z	ScHiZo		Where can I find the md5sum for the live iso? On the site I can only find a txt with md5sums, wich my sfv/md5 checker doesn't support.

2005-04-16T15:09:00.000Z	topyli	ScHiZo	94d5bb20fa7da3464bac656a4354690b is the md5sum
2005-04-16T15:11:00.000Z	topyli	ScHiZo	no idea. look at the text file you got from the download site
