2008-10-08T11:26:00.000Z	taishi28012		Does anyone have a suggestion for a simple CLI alternative to network-manager?
2008-10-08T11:26:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	taishi28012	why not iwconfig or ifconfig?
2008-10-08T11:27:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	taishi28012	wait, I guess they don't do the roaming thing...
2008-10-08T11:27:00.000Z	taishi28012	danbh_intrepid	I guess I could have cron run a bash script that would connect me depending on the results of iwlist but that just seems unecessary
