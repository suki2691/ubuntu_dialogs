2010-11-12T23:13:00.000Z	lock	hylian	the program will have to either be running in the background or have some sort of trigger tied to the system calendar so that it could pop up on specified dates/times...as far as which specific application, i cant help you there...just takes a lot of searching, or you can write the program yourself
