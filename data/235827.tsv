2007-03-22T11:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	mr_grump5	OK, so you didn't just nuke the entire harddrive - that was the first thing to check :)
2007-03-22T11:17:00.000Z	Madpilot	mr_grump5	I've never broken grub myself (not yet...) so I'm not an expert - have you looked thru the !dualboot information?
2007-03-22T11:20:00.000Z	Madpilot	mr_grump5	does that WindowsDualBootHowTo URL not have the information you need?
