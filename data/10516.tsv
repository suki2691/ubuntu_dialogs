2011-12-29T16:52:00.000Z	TheLastBaron		Please guys excuse me, But I just installed irssi and I'm a tad confused over here, How do you make the "Dedicated answer"/Yellow-answer-thingy now again ? .. Ubottu kinda got lost and slashHelp is only for certain commands, I don't even know what command to use.. not even Google helped me out effeciantly enough
