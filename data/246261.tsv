2009-06-04T13:59:00.000Z	Kaifas		Hello. I have the question. Why when i for example maximizi my movie, so my PC is just lag, and when maximized, for example sometimes system just freeze and i must restart my computer. I have ATI HD 2600 pro VGA, i install all driver for it. But nothing, if i turn off the effect so it's good, but i think this is not the solution for this problem. Because in internet i find that guy with HD 3650 have the same problem, so really this is not in VGA. We use Ubun
