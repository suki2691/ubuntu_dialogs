2011-05-23T00:12:00.000Z	joakimk	TeslaTony	one thing though. I set up a LAMP setup, which "survived" into U11. Any way for me to take a backup of key "setup" files, so I can get localhost back up after doing a fresh reinstall of U10?
2011-05-23T00:14:00.000Z	TeslaTony	joakimk	I'm not familiar with LAMP, so I don't know, really. It'll depend on how/where the settings are stored
2011-05-23T00:14:00.000Z	joakimk	TeslaTony	yeah. LAMP as in an apache2 server, on localhost :)
