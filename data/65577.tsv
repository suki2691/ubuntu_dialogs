2009-06-07T21:25:00.000Z	dakarn		yeah check out conky to display anything
2009-06-07T21:25:00.000Z	OleJon	dakarn	I can try Conky, but I think it also uses lm-sensors and /proc/acpi which as I said doesn't give anything
2009-06-07T21:36:00.000Z	OleJon	dakarn	No, it's from lm-sensors, (like the "sensors" terminal application)
