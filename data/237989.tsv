2006-06-07T06:27:00.000Z	albacker	Corey	i'd recommend getting vi as your code editor, it's good, you have a GUI version of it called gvim, you can get it bu apt-get install gnome-vim or gtk-vim, you have others and emacs is one of them, as for the compiler apt-get install g++, but i think you already have it on your PC !
