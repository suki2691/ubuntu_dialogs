2007-08-21T10:31:00.000Z	finalbeta	ryanakca	ubuntu doesn't have root
2007-08-21T10:35:00.000Z	ryanakca	finalbeta	no. The only person who needs to have access to 'su' is someone with 'sudo'... but thanks to sudo -u username, no need for 'su'. so... any way to disable it completely, or is it relied upon by sudo?
2007-08-21T10:35:00.000Z	finalbeta	ryanakca	good question :)
