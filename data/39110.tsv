2010-01-13T04:24:00.000Z	Danskmand1		Howdy :-) - I have accitently used "cat myfile" on a wrong file. So now, I cannot read the console anymore (only weird signs)....How do I tell linux to show signs and not graphical symbols anymore ?
2010-01-13T04:26:00.000Z	iceroot	Danskmand1	on what file?
2010-01-13T04:27:00.000Z	iceroot	Danskmand1	what if you type "bash" will you get a new bash without that problems?
2010-01-13T04:29:00.000Z	Danskmand1	iceroot	I dont even remember.....You remember in former times you could make graphics (yes, simple ones) just with "special letters" - like the "q" looks like a minus, "w" looks like a "t" and so on....
