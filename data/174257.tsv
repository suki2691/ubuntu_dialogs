2006-11-12T15:52:00.000Z	anthonyc		sounds like you need to enable the AddType for .php files in it
2006-11-12T15:52:00.000Z	selinuxium	anthonyc	ok, cgi but I get what you mean :)
2006-11-12T16:04:00.000Z	selinuxium	anthonyc	the httpd.conf file is there for backward compatability. where do I need to add/edit the code, or do I need to install a new mod?
