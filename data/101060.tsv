2009-10-30T09:47:00.000Z	Vesayth		Hello! I just installed Ubuntu 9.04 on my desktop (64-bit) that already had Vista running on it. It doesn't seem to bring up grub when the computer boots now. It waits for about 10 seconds at a blank screen and then loads Vista
2009-10-30T09:47:00.000Z	Vesayth		anyone have any ideas?
