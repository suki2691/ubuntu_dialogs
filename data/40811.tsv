2010-02-07T20:54:00.000Z	Eremite	`mOOse`	I am.  Tell me how to fix it.
2010-02-07T20:56:00.000Z	`mOOse`	Eremite	take it up with microsoft - they started that crap long ago
2010-02-07T20:57:00.000Z	Eremite	`mOOse`	this has nothing to do with Microsoft.  Pay attention or please stop giving me suggestions.  Im asking why Ubuntu has hijacked my start page, and why Ubuntu forces me to open FireFox when I start my PC when its not set to do that.  Forcing the user to do ANYTHINg against their will defeats the whole purpose of Linux, non?
