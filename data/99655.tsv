2008-10-09T17:18:00.000Z	NicEXE		I really need to do some work using my hard drive <when I try to mount my hard drive an error message is shown that says that it cannot mount volume. The details shown are "mount_point cannot contain the following characters: newline, G_DIR_SEPARATOR (usually /)". How can I change my drive's mount settings?>
2008-10-09T17:19:00.000Z	jim_p	NicEXE	what type of drive (flash/hdd/cdrom)? what type of filesystem? is it in fstab?
2008-10-18T18:46:00.000Z	jim_p	NicEXE	have you looked in gconf-editor??
