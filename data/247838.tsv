2006-04-21T10:15:00.000Z	PS		Hi, can anyone help me with a small (i hope) problem installing realplayer on Dapper?
2006-04-21T10:16:00.000Z	PS		Anyone know why realplay might have deps on xlibs on my Dapper install, any how to get around it?
2006-04-21T10:16:00.000Z	PS		apt-get install xlibs doesn't do it
