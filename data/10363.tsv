2011-08-16T14:27:00.000Z	whoppergator	Niche	is this an initial dual-boot install of ubuntu? also, are we talking two hdds here or one with multiple partitions?
2011-08-16T14:28:00.000Z	whoppergator	Niche	ah, okay. so when you boot, you are seeing grub load, but it can't find the configuration partition?
