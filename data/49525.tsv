2010-04-24T15:50:00.000Z	Rahim		how can i manually remove a deb package which i have installed by dpkg -i command? because synaptic gives me an error
2010-04-24T15:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Rahim	 theres many options (which i rarely ever need) such as -->  --purge --force-remove-reinstreq
2010-04-24T15:51:00.000Z	Rahim	Dr_Willis	this is the error from Synaptic E: crossplatformui: subprocess installed post-removal script returned error exit status 1
2010-04-24T15:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Rahim	 means very little to me.   sorry
