2009-11-15T19:49:00.000Z	pietrubens		problem with ubuntu 9.10 64-bit on laptop: dual boot with vista, starts up fine, however, 2 major problems: first: can not install any program (not by using the ubuntu program installer - forgot the exact name) it always says about EVERY program that there is no package available, also downloading the setup file and then tryong to install it also does not work. this goes for any application that i am trying to install 
2009-11-15T19:50:00.000Z	pietrubens		since i am noob: have read about 32 and 64-bit OS, but why can i not install anything? is it a glitch in the 64-bit OS?
