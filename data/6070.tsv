2012-03-05T08:11:00.000Z	CWChou		I'm trying to get >4gb files off my mac. I was thinking of using ubuntu 11.10 as a live boot without installing. I remembered I used to do this with knoppix and it worked.  I want to write to NTFS drives from the Linux Live OS.  Is ubuntu going to have full capability?
