2007-03-26T15:40:00.000Z	Oswy		Ugh, how do I rename a file? Is it sudo rename -v '/hda1/folder' '/hda1/newname'?
2007-03-26T15:41:00.000Z	dyrne	Oswy	i only use rename for bulk renaming normally just 'mv file newfile'
2007-04-11T16:05:00.000Z	dyrne	Oswy	sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid whatevername key whateverkey; sudo dhclient wlan0    <-- doesnt work? how about sudo ifconfig somestaticip
2007-04-11T16:05:00.000Z	Oswy	dyrne	hmm, lemme try connecting directly like that.
