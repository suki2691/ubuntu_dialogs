2011-07-13T14:42:00.000Z	Name141		or should I say manually connect
2011-07-13T14:43:00.000Z	arfbtwn	Name141	If it's a samba/windows share, yes. Browsing can be done from network in the places menu
2011-07-13T14:47:00.000Z	arfbtwn	Name141	Right, so want to check connectivity. the smb://* format will work to go there directly
