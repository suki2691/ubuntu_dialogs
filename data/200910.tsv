2006-01-15T06:41:00.000Z	fm-2		Good evening all!
2006-01-15T06:42:00.000Z	fm-2		I was wondering if someone could help me with a boot-up script. Mainly, at what S* is the filesystem (/proc/) mounted?
2006-01-15T06:43:00.000Z	Seveas	fm-2	my guess is mountall.sh in rcS.d
2006-01-15T06:44:00.000Z	fm-2	Seveas	right, and S7xorg-common is what starts up X, right?
