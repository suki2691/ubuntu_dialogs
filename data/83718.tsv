2009-05-09T11:34:00.000Z	birk		can anyone tell me why I can't apt-get install bitchx ?
2009-05-09T11:34:00.000Z	lstarnes	birk	there is no package for it
2009-05-09T11:34:00.000Z	lstarnes	birk	possibly because it is no longer maintained
2009-05-09T11:35:00.000Z	lstarnes	birk	I would recommend using an alternative client such as irssi
