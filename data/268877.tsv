2005-09-05T06:55:00.000Z	ax		question here: I just updated my girlfriend's packages and now when i reboot i get this error: invalid compressed format, and i cannot boot
2005-09-05T06:55:00.000Z	ax		so you know she is dual booting and for some reason ubuntu used lilo instead of grub
2005-09-05T06:55:00.000Z	ax		any suggestions for ways to make her box usable again?
2005-09-05T06:56:00.000Z	bob2	ax	it's extraorindarily unlikely that "ubuntu used lilo instead of grub"; lilo is not on the install CD
