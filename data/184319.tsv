2006-12-29T17:28:00.000Z	Aggrav8d		i want to add multiple users to my server so that they can each access their samba share and not muck with each other.  how do i do this?  I tried googling but only found samba install docs.
2006-12-29T17:29:00.000Z	Aggrav8d		er, so that they can access their own samba share and not touch another person's samba share. </clarify>
