2009-02-22T07:02:00.000Z	syockit	Aeosynth	I think there's a gconf for that, but I haven't tried
2009-02-22T07:03:00.000Z	Aeosynth	syockit	where would you expect the setting to be? login? power management? just give me some keywords to scour gconf with
2009-02-22T07:04:00.000Z	syockit	Aeosynth	see gconf entry for /app/gnome-power-manager/lock . But frankly I tried enable locking for suspend but didn't work. you can try removing lock from hibernate and see if it works
