2008-08-05T22:34:00.000Z	jules90		Hi all.  I repartioned my hard drive and installed fedora on sda3 however it wiped out my ubuntu boot loader and I can't figure out how to fix it.  I tried following some instructions from the web but am getting nowhere.  Ubuntu is on /dev/sda1.  Can anyone please tell me the commands I need to use?
