2011-10-03T17:39:00.000Z	mbutubuntu		hello folks, I've discovered that in every shell I open the http_proxy enviroment variable is automatically set with an IP:PORT... I've never added that variable neither configured a main proxy for the OS... is there any conffile in /etc to disable this enviroment variable? thanks
