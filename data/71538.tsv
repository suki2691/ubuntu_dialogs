2010-04-21T06:26:00.000Z	jhambo		Hi folks.  Kmail fails to launch with a segmentation fault.  The crash info is here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/419563/.  This started happening after I uninstalled amarok.  Could someone please help me to get kmail working again?
2010-04-21T06:27:00.000Z	jhambo		I really don't want to have to reinstall from scratch just when I'm finally getting everything like I want it...

You also could putting amarok back and seeing if it fixed your problem, if it does not, Amarok might not have been the cause.  If it does, you'll have to figure out which required piece amarok is taking with it.
2010-04-21T06:46:00.000Z	jhambo	realcoolguy	I tried reinstalling with kpackagekit and that didn't help.  I had used aptitude to do a purge on amarok to try to get rid of the config files.  That also wanted to remove some stuff like networkmanager (why I can't understand).  Anyway, even after reinstalling kmail I still get the segmentation fault.
