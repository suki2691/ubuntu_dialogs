2005-12-15T15:31:00.000Z	The_Isle_of_Mark	dylan_	that is your public IP address. When your machine comes online, it asks your ISP for an address. If 2 machines ask for and receive the same IP address, you get that conflict problem. You should either 1. turn off the other machine when using the other. or @. buy a router
