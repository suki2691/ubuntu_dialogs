2008-08-24T03:40:00.000Z	eligos	iandouglas	yep firefox, when I clic on an IRC link Xchat launches, but it asks me for a server
2008-08-24T03:40:00.000Z	eligos	iandouglas	it doesn't go to the channel automatically
2008-08-24T03:40:00.000Z	iandouglas	eligos	sounds like you need to configure xhat to auto-connect you to the network from the link, i've never tried that myself
