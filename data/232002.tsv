2005-09-22T07:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	^DodGeR^	man apt.conf
2005-09-22T07:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	^DodGeR^	maybe it's easier through synaptic. Configuration->preferences->net
2005-09-22T07:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	^DodGeR^	maybe synaptic have set the proxy setting to all programs using apt (is a front end) try out cli and see what happens
