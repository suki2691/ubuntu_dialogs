2006-09-05T06:18:00.000Z	|thunder	BHSPitLappy	how so ?
2006-09-05T06:19:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	|thunder	I had grub installed, using menu.lst on hdb1 (my /boot partition), but I installed edgy later, and it used its OWN menu.lst... now I've removed edgy, and grub is still set to use THAT menu.lst.  How can I install grub, pointing to my GOOD menu.lst?
2006-09-05T06:20:00.000Z	|thunder	BHSPitLappy	im not sure.
