2008-12-10T00:12:00.000Z	peleg		help, please. It took me two hours to get convinced that the right thing to do is to upgrade 7.04->7.10, and I took a day off in order to do it. For more than 2 hours now I can't do any progress - 7.04 is not supported, hence, I can't get active mirrors in order to perform the upgrade, even though my system is up-to-date
2008-12-10T00:13:00.000Z	rww	peleg	maybe the thread at https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2008-December/026965.html might help?
2008-12-10T00:14:00.000Z	peleg	rww	thanks, I'll read it
2008-12-10T00:15:00.000Z	peleg	rww	no, I knew that; I had put http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ in my sources list, and updated the system, hence it is up-to-date
