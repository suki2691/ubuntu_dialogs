2007-10-27T21:15:00.000Z	bjb1959	ckennedy	the line we entered in your fstab was for /media/external but it sounds like it's looking for one called DRV4_VOL1 right?
2007-10-27T21:17:00.000Z	bjb1959	ckennedy	chris, call me when you get a chance there are a couple of things I want to try
2007-10-27T21:26:00.000Z	bjb1959	ckennedy	chris, you had the wrong stuff in the fstab. I replyed and gave you instructions. make sure to put spaces between stuff you have a tendancy to mush stuff together on one line which changes how it works
