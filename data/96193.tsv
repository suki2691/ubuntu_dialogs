2008-05-13T03:48:00.000Z	Arky44		hello all. I've done something horibly catastrophic to my ubuntu laptop -- reset the filesystem permissions. Is there a way to get them back to their defaults? Right now I can barely hang on to a tty as root, much less gdm as myself :P
2008-05-13T03:48:00.000Z	jrib	Arky44	what did you execute exactly?
2008-05-13T03:49:00.000Z	Arky44	jrib	it wasn;t terminal, just graphical. i changed them all to root.
2008-05-13T03:49:00.000Z	jrib	Arky44	recursively?
