2007-08-26T09:21:00.000Z	spike		I cant see it being sold with ubuntu, and I've read some bug reports about wireless hiccupping

2007-08-26T09:25:00.000Z	spike	rexy_	that comment oscillates between useless and irrelevant, a) because I have 2 ubuntu boxes working with hostap as wifi AP and never had a single issue, b) 'cause whatever you deem "soon" might not be soon enough for me or not reflect any real schedule
