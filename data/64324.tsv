2011-11-14T06:13:00.000Z	Icehawk78		I was attempting to upgrade the fglrx drivers on my laptop, and upon restart, 11.10 will no longer boot. I'm able to boot into Windows 7 on the same machine and access the grub config, but am not sure what I should start with to repair my installation. Any recommendations?
