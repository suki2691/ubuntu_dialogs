2007-01-01T07:27:00.000Z	AidanL		I have installed Ubuntu however when I go onto it I have text only and have been asked to login. I don't understand what to do. I thought it booted up, you entered your username and password then got onto your desktop...
2007-01-01T07:28:00.000Z	AidanL		Thanks awilcox, however it has told me there is a Fatal Error:(
2007-01-01T07:29:00.000Z	AidanL		X10: fatal IO error 104 (Connection Reset by peer) on X server ":0.0" after 9 requests (0 known processed) with 0 events remaining.
