2011-08-25T20:09:00.000Z	dhenson714		got a pretty simple issue if anyone's free to help out. i need a bit of advice on wireless connectivity, but i can't find anyone else who's had the same issue
2011-08-25T20:10:00.000Z	dhenson714		my internet typically doesnt connect unless my computer charger is plugged in. ever heard about this happening?
2011-08-25T20:11:00.000Z	contrast	dhenson714	not particularly, though i've known of certain bioses switching off the wireless until it's actually called for when running on the battery (to preserve power)
2011-08-25T20:12:00.000Z	contrast	dhenson714	you might [very carefully] check in your bios settings to see if there's any way to disable that
