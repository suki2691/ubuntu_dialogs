2010-04-03T05:10:00.000Z	mcurrington		By default, Ubuntu has a email icon on the panel which interfaces with email and im. Is it possible to get that menu to use Mozilla Thunderbird instead of Evolution?
2010-04-03T05:10:00.000Z	bazhang	mcurrington	sure, drag from the applications menu and put it there
2010-04-03T05:12:00.000Z	mcurrington	CyberaX2195	, bazhang : It just places itself next to the icon, doesn't want to move into the menu?
2010-04-03T05:12:00.000Z	bazhang	mcurrington	removed evolution yet? then just slide tb icon into place
