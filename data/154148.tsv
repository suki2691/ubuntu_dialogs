2006-12-29T15:50:00.000Z	AlexC_	lynucs	"VNC server for GNOME" sounds quite promosing lol
2006-12-29T15:50:00.000Z	lynucs	AlexC_	what do you mean
2006-12-29T15:51:00.000Z	AlexC_	lynucs	well he asked for a VNC Client, I didn't know of any so I did "sudo apt-cache search vnc" to find vnc programs, and saw Vino with a description of "vnc server for Gnome" so I thought that sounded good
