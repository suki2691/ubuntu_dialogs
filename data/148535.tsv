2007-02-13T14:06:00.000Z	rmd_		if i install xubuntu-desktop and decide that i like it, can i apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop and experience no problems?
2007-02-13T14:07:00.000Z	infinitee	rmd_	removing "ubuntu-desktop" wont take away the apps with it.. it would still work
2007-02-13T14:08:00.000Z	rmd_	infinitee	so i would have to go through and manually remove all the gnome apps?
2007-02-13T14:09:00.000Z	infinitee	rmd_	not sure, but it seems so
