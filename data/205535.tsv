2006-01-28T12:48:00.000Z	mojo_		I have a multi-boot question... hda = 30G, hdb=60G; GRUB on MBR of hda boots Ubuntu, which lives on hdb.  I want to install WinXP Pro on hda.  What is the best way to go about this?  BTW hdb has one active ubuntu and one for testing, so i can re-install ubuntu on the alt part. on hdb if needed for this to all work
