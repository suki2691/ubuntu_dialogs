2007-08-25T12:38:00.000Z	shiester_miester	kazim59	does it really matter? the fact that they are installing linux is good enough imho.  debian isn't that bad
2007-08-25T12:39:00.000Z	kazim59	shiester_miester	we convinced them that rpm is an hell.. so now they are switching from fedora to debian
2007-08-25T12:40:00.000Z	kazim59	shiester_miester	ubuntu got a friendly feeling debian lacks ... :(
