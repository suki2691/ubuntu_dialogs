2011-12-05T23:17:00.000Z	Odaym		when I'm using a package manager, what does it do when I say "apt-get install pidgin"?
2011-12-05T23:17:00.000Z	Odaym		does it grab the same source files and do the compiling and installing for me?
2011-12-05T23:18:00.000Z	Odaym		or does it just grab a .deb and run it?
2011-12-05T23:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	Odaym	 it download the precompiled .deb and installs it
