2010-01-03T07:31:00.000Z	ssmy		I have two wireless network cards, how do I stop ubuntu from trying to connect both of them to the network?
2010-01-03T07:31:00.000Z	Out_Cold	ssmy	in your network manager deselect "auto connect"
2010-01-03T07:32:00.000Z	Out_Cold	ssmy	on the card you don't want of course
2010-01-03T07:34:00.000Z	ssmy	Out_Cold	didn't do quite what you said, but I appear to have figured it out.
