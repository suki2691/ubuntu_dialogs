2009-11-26T16:55:00.000Z	gui7		isn't it a bit of a hassle to have to re-install everything when you re-isntall ubuntu? or do you just re-isnatll ubuntu and windows?
2009-11-26T16:56:00.000Z	gui7		when you do a clean install of ubuntu, what exactly do you have to reinstall/mess with?
2009-11-26T16:56:00.000Z	Slart	gui7	depends on how much work you put into your system... you could of course keep the config files in your home folder.. that might cut down on the reinstall time
