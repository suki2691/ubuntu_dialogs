2010-07-30T03:43:00.000Z	C-Otto		hi there
2010-07-30T03:44:00.000Z	C-Otto		i am an administrator of an ubuntu mirror, providing files with up to 10 GBit/sec - I'd like to know if there is some geoip based (or something other) automated download distribution when you use 'apt-get install'?
2010-07-30T03:44:00.000Z	C-Otto		or, if not, do users have to pick their mirror by hand?
2010-07-30T03:45:00.000Z	alkisg	C-Otto	I think that the sources.list is generated by the installer based on the users language selection, e.g. I have gr.archive.ubuntu.com which maps to some greek server
