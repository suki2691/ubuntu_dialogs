2011-03-29T16:27:00.000Z	antant		Hey guys. I've got a question about bash scripting. How do I use the first instance of "ls filename.*.ext" as a variable in "cp file.ext target/file.ext" ?
2011-03-29T16:28:00.000Z	ohsix	antant	no scripting needed, cp filename.*.ext target/ will do it
2011-03-29T16:28:00.000Z	antant	ohsix	Problem is, I want to change the file name
2011-03-29T16:33:00.000Z	antant	ohsix	any idea on my bash scripting problem?
