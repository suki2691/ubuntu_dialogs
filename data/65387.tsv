2009-03-20T15:37:00.000Z	PC_Nerd		Hi - I attempted a "cat file" - which I wasnt sure of the doctype on.. and now all my terminal commands appear on screen  (along wiht their output) - as weird characters (like when you open a binary file in notepad)
2009-03-20T15:37:00.000Z	PC_Nerd		any suggestions
2009-03-20T15:37:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	PC_Nerd	type "reset"
