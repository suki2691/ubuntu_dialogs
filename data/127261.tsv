2007-07-22T15:51:00.000Z	Blisken		Hi people, nero,, installed it and its saying it does not have access to my cd drives ie: /dev/sg2 and 3, how would "one" efficiently assign nero the right permission?
2007-07-22T15:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Blisken	Out of curiosity, why use nero?
2007-07-22T15:54:00.000Z	Blisken	Jordan_U	well I've always used win to burn/dl my media, I'm trying to become more nix dependent if you have any suggestions please, your info is not wasted on me.
