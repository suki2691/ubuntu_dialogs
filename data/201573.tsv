2006-01-10T13:42:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	BlackJudas	What sort of custom?  GDM has things like "failsafe terminal" and a couple of other options I don't remember, if that's what you mean.
2006-01-10T13:43:00.000Z	BlackJudas	tonyyarusso	nah, ie run a program on login
2006-01-10T13:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	BlackJudas	I don't know about gdm, but you can set that up in Gnome if you want something to always run.  Not sure about single instances.
