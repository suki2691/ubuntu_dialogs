2006-06-11T05:00:00.000Z	neoxan		anyone else got that problem? (i cant use the shortkey print, to print a screenshot, while the menu is open)
2006-06-11T05:00:00.000Z	neoxan		is that a bug?
2006-06-11T05:01:00.000Z	jel	neoxan	probably not so much a bug as an oversight or design limitation.  Use a program that snapshots after a timeout
