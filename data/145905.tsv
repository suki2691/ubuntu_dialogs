2010-08-04T06:25:00.000Z	mrpoundsign	ThomasB2k	I wouldn't. But more importantly, I no longer have the console going into vga mode.
2010-08-04T06:27:00.000Z	mrpoundsign	ThomasB2k	but if I were a php developer, or developing an extension, i might compile php. or if I wanted to make some enhancements. I mean, I think that's one of the points of open source. dpkg does not solve all problems :)
