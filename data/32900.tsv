2010-05-01T09:19:00.000Z	faploid	JohnB_	 I can't speak for wireless, but wired networking in 10.04 appears to be completely broken.  save yourself some headaches and just revert back to Karmic :)
2010-05-01T09:19:00.000Z	JohnB_	faploid	wired networking works for me as it always has just plug in the ethernet cable and I'm up just like that
2010-05-01T09:20:00.000Z	faploid	JohnB_	must be nice.
