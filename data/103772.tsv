2012-11-20T09:13:00.000Z	jdk		hi , I have a problem with gtk gnutella (your apper to be firewalled)
2012-11-20T09:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jdk	doesn't that need some port forwarding on the router so it accepts connections
2012-11-20T09:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jdk	not something I use, is there a #gnutella channel ?
2012-11-20T09:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jdk	#gtk-gnutella seems to be the channel
