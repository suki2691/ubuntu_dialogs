2011-11-08T08:16:00.000Z	papna		I'm running Natty. Ubuntu is currently convinced my left mouse button is depressed. (When it started, it was dragging something around. I killed that process, so now it just won't let me click on things.) The problem isn't fixed by changing mice, so I don't think it's a hardware issue.

2011-11-08T08:16:00.000Z	hhhzzzarn	papna	tried restarting?
2011-11-08T08:17:00.000Z	papna	hhhzzzarn	I did, but that only worked for a little while. I prefer to use my computer in >15 minute intervals.
