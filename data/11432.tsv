2011-12-22T03:03:00.000Z	auronandace	MrKeuner	the cursor hasn't been moved or the keyboard pressed in X amount of time
2011-12-22T03:03:00.000Z	MrKeuner	auronandace	what if an ssh session is active?
2011-12-22T03:05:00.000Z	auronandace	MrKeuner	i'd assume that would be remote keyboard activity so it wouldn't suspend (i could be wrong)
