2007-05-25T14:47:00.000Z	MrObvious		Can someone tell me how to build a DEB from a source?
2007-05-25T14:47:00.000Z	MrObvious		Is there some software that can do it?
2007-05-25T14:47:00.000Z	kenthomson	MrObvious	of whatever little i know, extract the source, cd to it, "./configure" "make" "make checkinstall", you would have a deb in that directory. But for that you may need this program do "sudo apt-get install checkinstall"
