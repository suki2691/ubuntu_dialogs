2009-04-03T05:24:00.000Z	gnorris		whenever i try to download something from the add/remove button it gives me an error. i am connected to the internet though. this is the error: E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.           E: _cache->open() failed, please report.
