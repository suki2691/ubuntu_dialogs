2005-05-19T15:22:00.000Z	whyz		oi, i heard that x-window-system-core isjust a meta package which is no use and can be uninstalled.. i'm asking this because i want to get rid of the mesa drivers, which forces me to remove x-window-system-core
2005-05-19T15:23:00.000Z	whyz		but then ubuntu-desktop depends on x-window-system-core
2005-05-19T15:24:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	whyz	ubuntu-desktop is also a metapackage
2005-05-19T15:25:00.000Z	whyz	Fator_Dee	so it's safe to just remove them too?
