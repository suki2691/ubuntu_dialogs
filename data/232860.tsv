Nothing on it will mount automatically, it's got an ext4 partition on it, hwich I had ubuntu installed on. I can mount this and copy stuff off it. It's also got some ntfs partitions on it, one of which, has Windows Vista on it. I can only see this is here using GParted, and

The only way to see it again is to unplug it and plug it back in again. I tried running ntfsfix on it from ntfsprogs. The first time it said it couldn't becasue the partition is corrupted, but now it says its succesful I've tried this a few times. But I still get the problem of
2010-06-06T23:47:00.000Z	edmund		it disconnecting the entire drive if I try to open a directory on the ntfs partition. The ext4 partition is fine unless I try to open a folder in the ntfs partition, in which case, as I said the drive disconnects. I'd quite like to be able to fix the partition so I can get at the data and use the hard drive as an external drive, keeping that data. I dont have windows so I cant do chkdsk on it. Thankyou for any help
