2008-07-08T02:46:00.000Z	jeff__		hello. I've got an old pentium 3, 450mhz computer with 384 mb of ram upon which I must rely due to a laptop death. I'm currently running an old (5.04) distro of ubuntu and I'm curious how I'd fare with a more current version.

2010-04-26T00:42:00.000Z	jeff__	ikonia	how would I reapply it to the MBR?
