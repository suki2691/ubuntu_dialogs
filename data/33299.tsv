2011-04-15T22:04:00.000Z	rumpe1	elementz	well... the dpkg command gives you the packages with the specified string (of a command e.g.). The next step would be the policy-command on the package-name to get the repository... maybe i will remember the exact name of the policy-command.
2011-04-15T22:05:00.000Z	rumpe1	elementz	ah... apt-cache policy foopackage
