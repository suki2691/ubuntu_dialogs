2007-04-18T07:41:00.000Z	CapaH	orangefly	It seems that the built in utilities handle wireless a bit better
2007-04-18T07:41:00.000Z	CapaH	orangefly	But no big deal since I just use iwconfig/ifconfig :)
2007-04-18T07:42:00.000Z	CapaH	orangefly	: I think in the area of wireless *drivers* that Feisty is better
