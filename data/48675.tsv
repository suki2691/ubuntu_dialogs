2009-09-12T21:29:00.000Z	Hentai		how can I open a terminal with super user\root access
2009-09-12T21:30:00.000Z	bmschrad	Hentai	if you run 'sudo su' then you will remain root as long as the terminal is open.
2009-09-12T21:30:00.000Z	Hentai	bmschrad	what about sudo -i? or will it log out afterwhile?
2009-09-12T21:31:00.000Z	bmschrad	Hentai	not sure I just do 'sudo su' and it keeps me logged as root for the whole time.
