2008-09-25T01:48:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Elshar	why is that "wasteful"?  some have a different partition for /etc, /usr, everything.
2008-09-25T01:54:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Elshar	yea, goto about:config and filter on ssl.  enable all the ssl2 stuff.
2008-09-25T01:56:00.000Z	Elshar	arrrghhh	I did that. Now firefox doesn't do anything when I click on ssh urls. It doesn't even apparently launch the script I wrote to parse what firefox sends it.
2008-09-25T01:56:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Elshar	uhm that's strange.  do the about:config, filter ssl and screenshot it.
