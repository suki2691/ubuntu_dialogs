2009-06-06T17:26:00.000Z	chazco	Jeruvy	- 8.04 suffers from the same bugs as 8.10 and 9.04 :(
2009-06-06T17:26:00.000Z	Jeruvy	chazco	in what regard?
2009-06-06T17:27:00.000Z	chazco	Jeruvy	- Been discussed on here loads of times... wifi broken with certain card combinations, tcp_window_scaling broken and in 9.04 broken video playback and evtouch. Bug reports exist for all these.
