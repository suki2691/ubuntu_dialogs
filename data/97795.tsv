2008-03-10T11:35:00.000Z	daave	uzumakinaruto	yeah, but I heard that NTFS write in linux is not very safe, right? Since the data on it is important, so...
2008-03-10T11:39:00.000Z	uzumakinaruto	daave	NTFS has been through a lot of testing. its pretty reliable now. If you dont use files greater than 4 GB, you can use a fat32 instead
2008-03-10T11:40:00.000Z	daave	uzumakinaruto	I see, thanks.
