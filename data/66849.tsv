2009-04-30T03:05:00.000Z	tgr_		hi i have a 250gb hard drive i am going to do  afresh install because my 8.04 is getting a bit buggy after xfce desktop install i was wondering what partition setup you recommend and if i should use ext3 or ext4 i want to have a seperate partition in case ubuntu crashes i can load another because my business runs on my computer
2009-04-30T03:06:00.000Z	hbekel	tgr_	if you need the computer, don't use ext4 yet
2009-04-30T03:08:00.000Z	tgr_	hbekel	is reiserfs better than ext3?
2009-04-30T03:09:00.000Z	hbekel	tgr_	there's no better, filesystems can suit different needs
