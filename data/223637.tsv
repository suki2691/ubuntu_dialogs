2007-05-13T15:38:00.000Z	Steov		hey, ive got a T42 thinkpad with 256mb ram, im wondering why its taking me more than 15 minutes to load the live desktop?
2007-05-13T15:39:00.000Z	Steov		is this a specific laptop problem?
2007-05-13T15:39:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Steov	sounds like the cd drive might be having trouble reading the disk?
2007-05-13T15:39:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Steov	or perhaps it's 256M minus some video ram and it's just not quite enough?
