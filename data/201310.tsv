2006-01-27T07:13:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	PTK	do you mean run 32bit on a 64bit system?
2006-01-27T07:14:00.000Z	PTK	CanYouHelpMePlz	no I mean convert to a complete 32bit userland.. I'm assuming kernel doesn't matter can change that later
2006-01-27T07:15:00.000Z	CanYouHelpMePlz	PTK	like cafuego said, not without a reinstall
