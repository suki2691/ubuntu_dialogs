2012-05-05T04:01:00.000Z	Paulo39		hello guys. i have a simple question: i want to install ubuntu. i already have a linux distro installed in the computer (arch) with separated /swap /home / and /boot partitions. when installing ubuntu, may i point /swap and /boot to the same partitions? (i know i can do it with /home and i will do it)

2012-05-05T04:02:00.000Z	Paulo39	bjorkintosh	what about /boot?
2012-05-05T04:03:00.000Z	Paulo39	bjorkintosh	ok, so i will create a /boot only for ubuntu. thanks for the answer
