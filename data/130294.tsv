2007-06-19T12:45:00.000Z	heroin	Dunas	sure just burn the iso onto it
2007-06-19T12:47:00.000Z	Dunas	heroin	I was asking because I tried it once, and it finished burning properly, but when I used the Boot Menu to Boot From Disk it simply booted into Windows, so I think I'll try Yehweh's advice and go with a CD-R... just have to get one.
2007-06-19T12:47:00.000Z	Dunas	heroin	Thanks though.
