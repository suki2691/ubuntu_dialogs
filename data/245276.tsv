I've configured the /etc/ppp/peers files and the /etc/ configs like wvdial.conf. but when i do wvdial ppp0. it sais that no dial phone, even thought I can connect to the internet using WinXP. any idea about this ?

2005-03-19T16:22:00.000Z	Albacker	socomm	kent, I asked here because beatrix, and ubuntu are very similar with each other. anyway thank you.
2005-03-19T16:22:00.000Z	socomm	Albacker	Try #debian.
