For example https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonHD found with the words "ubuntu radeonhd howto" But I cant find it when starting one level above https://help.ubuntu.com/community

2009-10-21T16:28:00.000Z	MenZa	lastman	I never said that. I don't like how the wiki is, but screaming about it isn't going to fix anything.
