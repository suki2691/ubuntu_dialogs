2006-03-02T09:30:00.000Z	Travis		Hi guys, I convinced my family to install linux on their box so far no complaints except about gaim, my brother has tried GAIM and aMSN and doesn't really like eaither are there any other MSN clients for linux?

2006-03-02T09:32:00.000Z	DonL	Travis	I don't know. Maybe it's because everybody else is using it
