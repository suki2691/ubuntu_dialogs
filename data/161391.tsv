2007-07-16T10:40:00.000Z	simpleH		hi, my nvidia drivers died on me, and xserver keeps crashing, how do I reinstall the drivers from a command line if I don't think I have them on the system anymore?
2007-07-16T10:40:00.000Z	simpleH		I'm getting errors like "Failed to load the NVIDIA kernel module!"
2007-07-16T10:41:00.000Z	simpleH		yeah, I don't think I have them anymore, what's the search command & syntax so I can check?
