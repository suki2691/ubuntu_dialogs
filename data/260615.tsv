2004-10-30T16:21:00.000Z	UBMike		I have a monitor that does a little better than 1024x768, but X (nv) wont run above 1024. this is in the log, how do I fix it:
2004-10-30T16:21:00.000Z	UBMike		(II) NV(0): Not using mode "1152x870" (no mode of this name)
2004-10-30T16:23:00.000Z	darkersatanic	UBMike	Try 1152x864 instead.
2004-10-30T16:23:00.000Z	UBMike	darkersatanic	ok, but how...?
