2009-05-27T18:11:00.000Z	angelleye		I'm trying to create a symbolic link.  I'm using ln -s /media/storage/user/www /home/user/www
2009-05-27T18:12:00.000Z	angelleye		it's creating a folder under /home/user called www and the icon in nautilus even has an arrow like a shortcut but it's nothing but an empty www folder under /home/user/www
