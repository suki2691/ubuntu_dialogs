2005-12-31T07:54:00.000Z	Zen		How do I fix my WinXP install without breaking my Ubuntu one?  I'm quite certain a repair install is going to overwrite the MBR and I'll be ushered into Windows's loader instead of GRUB.
2005-12-31T07:55:00.000Z	Toma-	Zen	do you want the windows boot laoder or grub?
2005-12-31T07:56:00.000Z	Zen	Toma-	I want GRUB like normal with an option for Ubuntu and an option for the windows loader screen
2005-12-31T07:59:00.000Z	Zen	Toma-	Yeah.  While GNU/Linux OS's use things that register Windows, Linux, BSD, etc, MS continues to only detect their own products.
