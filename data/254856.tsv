2005-05-06T11:59:00.000Z	reuben		hey guys, i just set up ubuntu and the only screen resolution available is 640x480...any ideas?
2005-05-06T11:59:00.000Z	mattgirv	reuben	reconfigure x. xorgconfig
2005-05-06T12:00:00.000Z	reuben	mattgirv	i ran the dpkg-reconfigure on xorg; the xorg.conf lists a whole bunch of other resolutions
2005-05-06T12:01:00.000Z	reuben	mattgirv	- there's only one resolution listed in the system/preferences/resolution dialog...bet that command would work otherwise
