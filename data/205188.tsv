2006-05-05T13:37:00.000Z	goonie		Here is a problem I need to solve... My netcards are always inactive on boot. I have to manually acitvate them which is tiresome and shouldn't be necessary. I have also noticed an error when shutting down the machine "Deconfiguring network interfaces ... Fail" Any ideas?
