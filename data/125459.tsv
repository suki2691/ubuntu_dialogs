2008-02-04T19:50:00.000Z	Tux_help		I would like to ask an installation question, please.
2008-02-04T19:51:00.000Z	Tux_help		I am trying to install Ubuntu on an older gateway machine.  I've downloaded the cd, copied it correctly (at least I followed *exactly* the instructions for 4 different software programs, so am convinced I have a good iso), but when I click install the installer starts but then indicates that there is no disk in the drive.

2008-02-04T19:54:00.000Z	k5ehx	Tux_help	I'd look on the ubuntu box I have here, but it appears to be locked while upgrading the kernel. And it's a production server. :-(
