2012-05-23T03:48:00.000Z	oqpo		Hi, I need to install java, but I don't know which of all versions. I see there is openjdk-6-jre and openjdk-7-jre, and also the one from Oracle. Which one is the recommended?
2012-05-23T03:49:00.000Z	nodestool	oqpo	i tend to use sun-java
2012-05-23T03:49:00.000Z	nodestool	oqpo	you can install more than one, and choose which one to use as the default
2012-05-23T03:51:00.000Z	oqpo	nodestool	ah, that is a good idea, I will try the the openjdk-7-jre one.
