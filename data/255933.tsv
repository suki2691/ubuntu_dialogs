2004-12-07T12:25:00.000Z	sparehead1		so i had a look in /usr/bin/acroread cause it was giving errors about it couldn't find /usr/lib/Acrobat5/bin/acroread when I looked it was acroread.sh so I added the .sh to usr/bin/acroread and now it says cannot find install directory
2004-12-07T12:26:00.000Z	sparehead1		when I look in acroread.sh it says "install_dir=REPLACE_ME" so I thought i'd replace it i just dont know what with :/
2004-12-07T12:28:00.000Z	jiyuu0	sparehead1	how did u install acroread?
2004-12-07T12:36:00.000Z	jiyuu0	sparehead1	i think ur acroread is from a diff repository... i can't seem to find acroread.sh here
