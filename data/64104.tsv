2011-10-16T19:04:00.000Z	dayson		I just upgraded from 11.04 to 11.10... To get the full Gnome 3 experience, I should just install the gnome-shell package? (and can I roll this process back too?)

2011-10-16T19:08:00.000Z	dayson	xangua	ActionParsnip I'm totally confused now. How do I try this --> http://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/ (the way it appears there)
