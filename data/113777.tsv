2012-02-27T10:05:00.000Z	__machine		trying to keep a log of the steps i need to take a configure a new ubuntu vps... when i have to do things like add several lines to the end of a config file... is there an easier way than multiple echo "..." >> filename commands? can i do a single command and then just paste all the lines into stdin and hit ctrl d to finish?
