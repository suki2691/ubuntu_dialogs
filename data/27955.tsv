2010-11-15T13:38:00.000Z	DannyButterman		Hi there. Can someone explain me how to sync two directories over two different machines ? I've used all kind of syntaxes, to no avail
2010-11-15T13:38:00.000Z	i5noc	DannyButterman	try rsync
2010-11-15T13:40:00.000Z	DannyButterman	i5noc	I'm already using rsync, but something is wrong, there are still missing files on the destination directory
2010-11-15T13:41:00.000Z	i5noc	DannyButterman	check your permissions
