2008-01-16T19:12:00.000Z	Codenut		I am still trying to figure out how to get irssi going on a second monitor so I can monitor this lrc group while living my life elsewhere without swapping computers
2008-01-16T19:13:00.000Z	Codenut		Can I assign a tty to another card?
2008-01-16T19:13:00.000Z	Codenut		video card that is.
2008-01-16T19:13:00.000Z	borbus	Codenut	can't you just run X over both and put a terminal with irssi on one?
