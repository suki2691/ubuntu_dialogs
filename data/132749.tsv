2008-01-12T13:57:00.000Z	rredd4		I have a Nvidia GeForce4 MX 440 video card.  I went to System -> Administration -> Restricted Driver Manager to enable the accelerated driver.  When I stream video, such as youtube, it is slow.  I use cable internet, and in windows videos play ok.  any ideas how to make this faster?

2008-01-12T13:58:00.000Z	houdini	rredd4	sorry, I've got nothing.  just checking on the basics
2008-01-12T14:04:00.000Z	rredd4	houdini	 i turned off the accelerated driver, streaming video is still slow
