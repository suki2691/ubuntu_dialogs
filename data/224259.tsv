It has a Cirrus Logic CS 4614/22/24 chipset but apparently the card itself isn't well supported in linux. Ohwell... sound works... I can use an external tuner for tuning my flutes
2005-09-22T05:17:00.000Z	boogie	reiki	- i also have a turtle beach - the analog output works fine
2005-09-22T05:17:00.000Z	boogie		digital output doesn't
2005-09-22T05:18:00.000Z	reiki	boogie	I can hear the mic through the speakers. I just can not get it to record
