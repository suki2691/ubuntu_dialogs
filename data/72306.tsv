2010-11-15T17:43:00.000Z	brverg		I would like to chat in #ubuntuone channel from x-chat gnome. Can anyone show me how?
2010-11-15T17:43:00.000Z	frxstrem	brverg	write /join #ubuntuone
2010-11-15T17:45:00.000Z	frxstrem	brverg	where you write messages (everything that starts with / in most IRC clients are treated as special commands)
2010-11-15T17:46:00.000Z	frxstrem	brverg	without the space at the beginning...
