2007-09-12T06:48:00.000Z	astro76	Lambchops	change to archive.ubuntu.com
2007-09-12T06:49:00.000Z	astro76	Lambchops	easiest way is for that is to edit /etc/apt/sources.list by hand (gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list)
2007-09-12T06:49:00.000Z	astro76	Lambchops	but you could use system>admin>software sources too
