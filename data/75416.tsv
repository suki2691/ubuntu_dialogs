2010-03-05T08:08:00.000Z	wolfjb		I'm trying to apt-get update and I'm getting a lot of 404 errors, I've tried 4 different software sources, this sounds like a network problem, except that I can surf the web, etc is there anything I can check?

2010-03-05T08:13:00.000Z	Out_Cold	wolfjb	maybe firewall or porrly set up routing/
