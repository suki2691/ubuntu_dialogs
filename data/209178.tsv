2007-07-26T10:00:00.000Z	malocite		I am trying to setup my computer to work with its svideo output to the tv.  When I have tried this in the past I have messed up X and I cant get it back, so I have to reinstall linux, and I don't want to do that again.  What files do I need to make backups of so that I can restore them if I skrew up again without having to reinstall ubuntu again
2007-07-26T10:01:00.000Z	malocite		the text editor?
2007-07-26T10:01:00.000Z	malocite		right
