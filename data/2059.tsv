2012-07-10T06:07:00.000Z	lubuntuHDD	JokesOnYou77	I can use the commandline tools -- I've just never tried to run fsck on a whole disk before
2012-07-10T06:09:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	lubuntuHDD	Me neither.  I usually pop in a liveCD with a GUI and run palimpsest to run a few diagnostics to confirm any theories I have before doing anything else.  I suspect that running fsck on the whole disk would definitely be an overnight task though
