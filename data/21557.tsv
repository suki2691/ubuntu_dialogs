2011-03-10T16:36:00.000Z	Ja23		Hello! Maybe you can help me? My Problem:
2011-03-10T16:36:00.000Z	Ja23		Using DiskCreator I made a bootable usb drive with Ubuntu, when I run it on my computer there is no option for running it as a LiveCD, only for fixing an existing version of Ubuntu or for installing a new one
2011-03-10T16:37:00.000Z	cablop	Ja23	it seems it depends on what did you used to create that LiveCd... did you used the alternate CD?
2011-03-10T16:38:00.000Z	Ja23	cablop	I used the 10.10 desktop version, AMD64
