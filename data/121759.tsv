2007-09-16T12:14:00.000Z	vancomycin		hey all 2 questions : i am presently downloading the iso live cd (i didn't want the wubi virtual disk version), i only have 1 drive on my laptop unpartitioned, i have 8gb free for ubuntu, 92gb is being used by xp. i came here yesterday and a member had mentioned that i need to fix the grub on the live cd. i was given this link : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37489/ when and where should i do this after i burn the iso?
2007-09-16T12:15:00.000Z	vancomycin		2nd question, i see some of these commands - and as a windows user, i have no idea what these commands mean - is there a newbie's guide to using commands in ubuntu? i'd like to know what they mean... this is a whole new language and format for me and would like to start from the bottom
2007-09-16T12:17:00.000Z	dxdt	vancomycin	Yeah I used to have that problem too.  Best way is to man and google the hell out of commands
2007-09-16T12:21:00.000Z	vancomycin	dxdt	> hehe, yeah these commands are new to me for sure! i'll be googling them, i saw a few newbie command pages - but understood only a bit. it's like learning to walk all over
