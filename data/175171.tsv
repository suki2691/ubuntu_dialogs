2011-08-05T23:57:00.000Z	Chubcorp		I have a question about mounting a usb, no where can my system find it, but disk utility can. I've tried to find it with sudo fdisk -1 but it only shows the hard drive. Any help?
2011-08-05T23:58:00.000Z	farchord	Chubcorp	what kind of usb device is it? Flash drive? USB HD?
2011-08-06T00:00:00.000Z	farchord	Chubcorp	do other devices on usb ports work? I mean, I imply you use a port available on your motherboard here
