2006-04-19T16:50:00.000Z	amphi	mynamesbob	what does that have to do with the window manager?
2006-04-19T16:51:00.000Z	mynamesbob	amphi	i am using oss through jack and nothing works with fluxbox, says no device but when i use gnome everything works just fine
2006-04-19T16:51:00.000Z	amphi	mynamesbob	perhaps it's configured to use esd? (guessing, I don't use gnome or jack)
