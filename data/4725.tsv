2012-03-11T05:30:00.000Z	Transcended		hello, what is the easiest way to install the latest version of ruby on ubuntu 11.04?
2012-03-11T05:31:00.000Z	escott	Transcended	apt-get install ruby1.9
2012-03-11T05:33:00.000Z	Transcended	escott	Ok 1.9.1 is installing, do you know if there's a command to upgrade to 1.9.3 or do I have to download/install it manually?
