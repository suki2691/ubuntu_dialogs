2010-07-30T21:48:00.000Z	Error404NotFound		Perhaps i was unclear the first time. Here is what happened. I switched from user A to user B in gnome, played a sound from user B's account, did some browsing, logged him out, and when i login back as user A i can't hear any sound. tried multiple player, multiple places, volume is not mute and it has happened for the third time.

2010-07-30T21:49:00.000Z	Error404NotFound	ZykoticK9	so it has happened to a lot of people?
2010-07-30T21:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Error404NotFound	i have certainly heard of that before yes.
