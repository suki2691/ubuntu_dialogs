2010-05-17T21:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bondiblueos9_	 you may want to ask in the mac channel what linux type filesystems the macos supports.
2010-05-17T21:01:00.000Z	bondiblueos9_	Dr_Willis	I guess I was wondering how good the ubuntu support for hfs+ or ufs is
2010-05-17T21:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bondiblueos9_	 for hfs/hfs+ i think its readonly.. ie: proberly not good enough for your needs. I dont own a mac. i jsut see people asking in here about hfs all the time
