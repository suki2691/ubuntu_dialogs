2007-11-07T12:24:00.000Z	cptcanuck		Okay next dumb question, when I did an upgrade  and rebooted now my display is totally borked it's like it's wrapping around the screen several times, when I go to another login prompt I don't have any problem with plain text.  But in the GUI it's totally borked.  Any idea what I need to do to fix it?
