2006-03-13T10:38:00.000Z	dooglus	Coag	you should be able to just install it and restart gdm
2006-03-13T10:40:00.000Z	dooglus	Coag	you can make a .desktop file in /usr/share/xsessions/ and it will show up in gdm
2006-03-13T10:41:00.000Z	dooglus	Coag	install fluxbox and look at its .desktop file - it's a lot smaller than the GNOME one
