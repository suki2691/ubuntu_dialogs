2009-02-24T19:31:00.000Z	VATP		If I get mre RAM ans install it, when I remove the excedent RAM will I have any problem running ubuntu?

2009-02-24T19:33:00.000Z	Slart	VATP	I think you'll be fine even if you remove the extra memory after the install.. even better would be to use the alternate cd to install.. it has a lighter text based install that doesn't need as much memory
