2005-12-31T10:24:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie		I am Using the latest Ubuntu Live CD.  I am following instructions at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RealplayerInstallationMethods?highlight=%28player%29%7C%28real%29 to install real player directly from REal.  The .bin file is on my desktop, but if I type "sudo ./RealPlayerGold.bin"  it says "Command Not Found"  Why and how do I fix it?
