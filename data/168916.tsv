2011-01-07T04:20:00.000Z	Weedy	M0nk3Ee	sudo apt-get update && lsb_release -a && uname -a && sudo apt-get upgrade
2011-01-07T04:25:00.000Z	M0nk3Ee	Weedy	it says i'm running 2.6.31-22-386 which is the latest then for 9.10... will 2.6.35 make it to 9.10 or because 9.10 is the stable release it will freeze there?
