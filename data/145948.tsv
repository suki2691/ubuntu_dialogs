2007-02-13T08:07:00.000Z	unop	HighLife245	 sure .. sftp or scp can be used to connect upto the ssh server .. although stfp might need extra configuration
2007-02-13T08:07:00.000Z	HighLife245	unop	I was hoping to do it through something like putty
2007-02-13T08:09:00.000Z	unop	HighLife245	 errm, i dont really know much abut putty
