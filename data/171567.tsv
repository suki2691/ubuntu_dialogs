2007-10-06T14:34:00.000Z	ikonia	rulus	same way you mounted /home - just mount a dir off /home
2007-10-06T14:34:00.000Z	ikonia	rulus	/home/mount for example
2007-10-06T14:35:00.000Z	rulus	ikonia	no, I mean a directory from the partition to mount, like /backup/home at /dev/sda1 should be mounted at the /home
