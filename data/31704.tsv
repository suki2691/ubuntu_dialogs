2010-05-21T04:35:00.000Z	Grujah		right click on window title, and check "always on top"
2010-05-21T04:37:00.000Z	Sonsee	Grujah	no, that is not the one. It`s like on ms windows vista and 7, If the window minimized you can look on a "small version" of it if you put mouse on it...
2010-05-21T04:38:00.000Z	Grujah	Sonsee	oh, I missunderstood than. Sorry, I don't know how do do that.
