2010-01-05T17:44:00.000Z	pjoshi	soreau	: if through command prompt if i umount flash drive it will still show light on the flash drive.. but through gui/X you get option when you right-click on the flash drive "Safely remove drive"
2010-01-05T17:51:00.000Z	soreau	pjoshi	AFAIK, umounting the drive is sufficient for safely removing it. As for the light, I suspect the gui somehow tells the light to turn off. It's probably not an issue to have the light still on
