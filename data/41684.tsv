2009-11-30T07:36:00.000Z	decora	Guest85919	run a du -a /var/log | sort -n | tail -20 and see what is taking the most space. then less it and see why its logging so much
2009-11-30T07:39:00.000Z	decora	Guest85919	look at those files see why they are taking so much. tail -100 /var/log/syslog | less
2009-11-30T07:39:00.000Z	decora	Guest85919	or even tail -f /var/log/syslog
