2009-11-13T10:44:00.000Z	scunizi	Vtec	ask in ##windows
2009-11-13T10:45:00.000Z	scunizi	Vtec	how true.. however this is an ubuntu tech support channel..
2009-11-13T10:45:00.000Z	scunizi	Vtec	might ask in #linux.. there are some pretty smart windows people there too. and it's not strictly an ubuntu tech channel
