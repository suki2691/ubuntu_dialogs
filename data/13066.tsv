2012-10-01T19:07:00.000Z	gbili		hello, I would like to use the latest version of django (1.4) but python-django package only has version 1.3.1, how can I get the newest version?

2012-10-01T19:11:00.000Z	gbili	overclucker	ok thanks, but is it difficult to create a package? so i use django the ubunut official way?
