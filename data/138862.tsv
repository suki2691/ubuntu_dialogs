2007-04-18T13:25:00.000Z	tommytom	bubuntu	you dont really NEED dhcp. as logn as you set the ip/subnet/gateway/dns correctly to an ip cupported by the router and point dns/gateway to the router
2007-04-18T13:28:00.000Z	bubuntu	tommytom	router is working fine. i'm using it right now... DHCP setup? how to do this? I am using dhcp now on this machine... don't know why ubuntu machine won't get dhcp lease
