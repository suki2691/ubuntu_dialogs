2009-03-18T02:31:00.000Z	Squarc		Hey guys, I have this problem and I did google, but I just don't get it...
2009-03-18T02:31:00.000Z	Squarc		I wrote this little script to automaticly mount and bind some folders, start lampp, and execute a export command to make a wine app work that requires ODBC...
2009-03-18T02:31:00.000Z	Squarc		Now I want to execute the file on startup, but by setting it so using the System Settings GUI it won't work somehow... partitions wont get mounted, binds dont get done, lampp isnt started and the export isnt executed either.... what file should I edit to make the script run automaticly on startup?
