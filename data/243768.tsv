2005-04-22T06:03:00.000Z	rijad		Hmm can't linux handle many files in one dir?
2005-04-22T06:04:00.000Z	rijad		Well i got about 1500pics in one dir, and now when i try to open it the system just "hangs", or i mean the browser hangs
2005-04-22T06:05:00.000Z	rijad		is there a better alternative to nutellus?
2005-04-22T06:05:00.000Z	saik0	rijad	it might be the browser trying to create thumbnails for all of them...
