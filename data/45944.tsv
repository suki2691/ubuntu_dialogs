2009-10-15T11:38:00.000Z	teknozwizard		Stupid Question: Knowing that I could actually write C coding language into the text editor and save the file with the ".c" extension, I'm curious to know if there is - perhaps - an actual editor built for Ubuntu 9.04 that I could use to code in instead of using the text editor....?

2009-10-15T11:41:00.000Z	teknozwizard	hassanakevazir	foofish: right, I call "gedit" text editor and I do not care too much for vi or emacs. That's why I was wondering if there was another editor out there.
