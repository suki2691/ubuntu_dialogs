2008-10-26T06:26:00.000Z	Guest47896		I need some help with screen resolution on a laptop... no matter what I set in xorg.conf, it seems to default to 800x600 and 'Screen Resolution' in the preferences menu only lists 800x600...

2008-10-26T06:27:00.000Z	Guest47896		Kitty_: I actually had it working fine before, I tried to get an external monitor working, which failed, and also caused this
2008-10-26T06:28:00.000Z	Guest47896	kitty_	I've tried dpkg-reconfigure xserver-org as well, to no effect
