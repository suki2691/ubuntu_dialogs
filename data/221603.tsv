2005-11-26T12:23:00.000Z	ompaul	hawking	is this for storage on a linux box or is it for use with a windows box cos we have some great tools
2005-11-26T12:23:00.000Z	hawking	ompaul	well I have to compress two files which is homework... I don't know if the teacher uses linux or windoze
2005-11-26T12:24:00.000Z	hawking	ompaul	but most probably she doesn't use linux..although she teaches about it lol
