2007-07-02T15:48:00.000Z	hakk		hi guys.. is there anything specific I need to do to get amarok working in (gnome) ubuntu? I've got the packages installed, and it can scan my music collection, but hangs when it tries to add any tracks to the playlist - ideas?
2007-07-02T15:48:00.000Z	hakk		all audio/video stuff works fine in other apps (e.g. totem)
2007-07-02T15:48:00.000Z	PriceChild	hakk	be patient, it takes time to build its database
2007-07-02T15:48:00.000Z	hakk	PriceChild	the database was built - it can't add anything to it's playlist..
