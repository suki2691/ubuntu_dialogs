2007-05-05T05:36:00.000Z	zipped20x		i have a question
2007-05-05T05:37:00.000Z	zipped20x		is there any way to reformat part of my linux partition without harming the current linux installation
2007-05-05T05:38:00.000Z	jmashaw	zipped20x	you can use gparted to resize and then reformat a part of it, but be careful, as it is not always 100% succesful
2007-05-05T05:46:00.000Z	jmashaw	zipped20x	I supose that would be easy enough
