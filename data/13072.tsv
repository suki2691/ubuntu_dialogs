2011-06-21T08:46:00.000Z	karrot2		I've made it so that my computer auto logs in to a user, but right after it logs in it has to ask for a password to access the keychain to get the wifi connection going... is there any way around having to punch in this password?
2011-06-21T08:47:00.000Z	Talaskina	karrot2	same thing happens to me, i have been too lazy to try and find an answer to why the keychain keeps poping up after login
2011-06-21T08:48:00.000Z	karrot2	Talaskina	if you ever find an answer...
2011-06-21T08:49:00.000Z	Talaskina	karrot2	i was able to fix it before. if i find a solution and you are still on sure.
