2006-10-03T08:26:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	fildo	use ddwrt if you do so...it's quite painless
2006-10-03T08:27:00.000Z	fildo	Gevaudan82	i was actually looking into that . but dont want to courupt hardware
2006-10-03T08:28:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	fildo	you won't...just make sure you are plugged into  a reliable power supply and are flashing to ddwrt from any original linksys firmware...if you want to shop around, always reflash   to the original linksys firmware before flashing to a different firmware
