2007-03-03T16:10:00.000Z	directhex	farid	all shown updates are for things on your system
2007-03-03T16:11:00.000Z	directhex	farid	yes. a version which requires a stability or security update
2007-03-03T16:15:00.000Z	directhex	farid	did you try what GeBo said yet? apt-get install kde. or apt-get install kdebase if that doesn't help
