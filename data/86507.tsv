2009-02-09T02:04:00.000Z	Antioch		I'm trying to add a new set of smiley themes to Pidgin. Ive both dragged the tar.gz file into the smiley themes window, as well as pressing the add button and giving it the file-name. Neither method works. I've tried this for many different smiley themes and always the same result. How can I add new smiley themes to Pidgin?
