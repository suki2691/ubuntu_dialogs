2009-03-16T03:19:00.000Z	frojnd		Hello there. Is there any other way to see output of a program than just run it from shell ?
2009-03-16T03:19:00.000Z	vocx	frojnd	no, they aoutput to standard output which is the terminal
2009-03-16T03:19:00.000Z	frojnd	vocx	ok but the command, can be modified or just: $ program ?
2009-03-16T03:21:00.000Z	vocx	frojnd	the program can be modified yes, so instead of outputting to a terminal it outputs to a window or text area of course, but it's easier to just run it in the terminal.
