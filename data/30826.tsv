2010-06-02T12:04:00.000Z	wildbat	wv	he just resizing the ntfs one so it is fine
2010-06-02T12:07:00.000Z	wv	wildbat	deathnight114, I don't get it, he says he took 100GB for linux to install, doesn't he just want to delete his linux partition and attach it to his ntfs again?
2010-06-02T12:07:00.000Z	wildbat	wv	hmmm <deathnight114> uhh, i have a question, is there any way to get back the hard drive space i partitioned on windows so that i could install ubuntu?
