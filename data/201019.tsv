2007-06-01T05:37:00.000Z	mehmetserif		i am trying to install ubuntu Feisty but i am locked at partitioning , i have also xp on my hard drive but there is no other partition for ubuntu but there is a space in c: like 8 gb. so i want to use that empty space. In partition window there is a selection "Guided: resize sda and use freed space" does that mean it will use that free space?
