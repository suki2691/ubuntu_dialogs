2008-05-06T00:08:00.000Z	Dianabol		is ftp dangerous to use? like does it have security issues? or can it be dangerous if not properly set up (security and access restrictions)?
2008-05-06T00:08:00.000Z	shadfc	Dianabol	look into sftp (ftp over ssh)
2008-05-06T00:08:00.000Z	Dianabol	shadfc	will windows users be able to log into my server?
2008-05-06T00:09:00.000Z	shadfc	Dianabol	there are plenty of clients that do sftp (filezilla for one), but probably not generic windows
