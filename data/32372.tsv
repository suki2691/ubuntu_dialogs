2010-06-07T23:48:00.000Z	sjm		whammo: one time or each boot?
2010-06-07T23:49:00.000Z	Whammo	sjm	both would be useful knowledge, but ultimately every time
2010-06-07T23:51:00.000Z	Whammo	sjm	ok, so hold shift when starting, hit e to edit grub command and add to second to last line?
2010-06-07T23:59:00.000Z	Whammo	sjm	ok one last question when adding arguments to the line, do they go after the quiet and splash, for example, or at the very end after the kernel image
