2011-02-23T11:33:00.000Z	tom67519		I have a laptop with Ubuntu installed. When I plug the AC adapter in, the battery status says "fully charged" instead of "charging", even though it is only 25% charged
2011-02-23T11:33:00.000Z	tom67519		How do I determine if this is a software or hardware issue?
2011-02-23T11:33:00.000Z	ruffdog	tom67519	do you have windows also installed on the laptop?  I had a similar problem and I dual booted into my windows install and verified it was a problem with my battery.  Had to replace it.
