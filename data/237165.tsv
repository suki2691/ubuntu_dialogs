2005-05-18T10:27:00.000Z	mtbeedee		i wonder if when he switches out, it closes or resets that pty
2005-05-18T10:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mtbeedee	ubuntu is bog standard normal when it comes to switching from one tty to another, unless he has a keyboard config issue
2005-05-18T10:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mtbeedee	there is nothing wrong with his inittab
2005-05-18T10:54:00.000Z	mtbeedee	thoreauputic	ok... I was unsure if that would help or not
