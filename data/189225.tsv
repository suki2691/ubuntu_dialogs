2006-04-30T07:28:00.000Z	FHX		I was trying to do a dual boot, so i wanted to startover new and install windows then add on linux, like a normal dual boot configuration would go. So I inserted the windows cd in, deleted my linux partition, and reformatted the HD. at 64% it got stuck, so I thought okay, I' ll try that again. This time I Selected " quick format" , so it formatted and then it went on to copying files. It kept getting stuck and couldn't copy certain files, but
2006-04-30T07:28:00.000Z	FHX		Could someone please advise?
