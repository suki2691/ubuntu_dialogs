2007-09-22T11:27:00.000Z	Usrl_		Can someone please recommend me a torrent client? Azureus works with encryption on, but it randomly crashes which makes it completely unusable. Everything else I've tried doesn't even work. I'm on comcast, and I know they block bittorrent upload traffic, which is why I need the encyrption
2007-09-22T11:27:00.000Z	Usrl_		So does anyone have any ideas for a client that might WORK?
