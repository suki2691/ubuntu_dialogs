2010-12-16T16:11:00.000Z	PhysicistJames		what I would like to know also is if there's a way to install older versions from the ubuntu repository using apt get
2010-12-16T16:13:00.000Z	PhysicistJames		but is there like a repository that contains all versions of a specific package
2010-12-16T16:14:00.000Z	rigved	PhysicistJames	then you need to use repositories of older ubuntu versions like 9.10
