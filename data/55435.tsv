2011-04-16T02:28:00.000Z	Infame		Is it normal to have 2 ubuntus at GNU grub? One being Linux 2.6.35.28, and the other being 2.6.35.22....

2011-04-16T02:28:00.000Z	edbian	Infame	They're different kernels.
2011-04-16T02:29:00.000Z	edbian	Infame	go to System -> admin -> synaptic.  Search the number of the one you want to remove.  Remove the package that shows up.  DON'T delete all the kernels
