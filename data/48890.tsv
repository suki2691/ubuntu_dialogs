2009-09-09T23:55:00.000Z	Watchitnow		Guys I wanna install ubuntu but the install disk isn't detecting Win7. It says "Windows Vista (Loader)" and only says it's 100MB in size. What's the deal?

2009-09-09T23:57:00.000Z	Watchitnow	andcor	Yes.
2009-09-10T00:00:00.000Z	andcor	Watchitnow	ok, I actually can't remember if the ubuntu install actually saw the win 7 partition when i installed
