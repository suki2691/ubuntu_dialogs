2009-02-11T20:06:00.000Z	bOiNk_		lol - a dumb question... i have a file named -foo and want to move it... but "mv -foo bar" thinks (of course) that -foo is a parameter... putting -foo into slashes doesn't work either... any ideas plz ? :D
2009-02-11T20:08:00.000Z	Fenix|work	bOiNk_	you have to escape the file ... mv \-foo bar
2009-02-11T20:08:00.000Z	bOiNk_		aaahh :D ok i'll try thx :D
