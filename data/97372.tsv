2008-03-14T20:24:00.000Z	Econael		I'm using Ubuntu 7.10 and everytime I try to get a server.met, amule crashes (window just closes, no error messages)
2008-03-14T20:25:00.000Z	Lamego	Econael	launching amule from the terminal may provide you some aditional info on the crash
2008-03-14T20:25:00.000Z	Econael	Lamego	thx, I'll try that
2008-03-14T20:32:00.000Z	Econael	Lamego	the crashed aMule now gives me a fatal error and a dump, I guess I should post that at the amule forums?
