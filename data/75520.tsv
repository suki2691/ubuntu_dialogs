2008-12-27T02:32:00.000Z	streenz		er .. higher % used

2008-12-27T02:35:00.000Z	streenz	sinbox	I've only ever used Gnome up til now.. would Xfce run faster if all the Gnome-related stuff was removed? ie. will it load/run faster in Xfce if Gnome packages arent installed or are they simply not used when Xfce is run
