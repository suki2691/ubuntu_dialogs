2007-03-12T13:16:00.000Z	ikonia	charlesg3	try ejecting it and putting nothing in, it trys to spin up to see if there is data there
2007-03-12T13:17:00.000Z	charlesg3	ikonia	I mean through software when there is already a cd in the drive
2007-03-12T13:17:00.000Z	ikonia	charlesg3	no idea, don't think there is "drive control" like that
