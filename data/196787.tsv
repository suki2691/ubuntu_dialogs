2006-05-27T07:23:00.000Z	Jeldert		I want to share date between Linux and Windows (on the same machine). All my music and movies are on a 100GB NTFS partition, but I cannot write to it from Ubuntu. What filesystem do you recommend?
2006-05-27T07:24:00.000Z	Jeldert		I tried a ext3 reader/writer for Windows XP, but it slowed my machine down
2006-05-27T07:25:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	Jeldert	Try captive ntfs (suppost to be pretty stable)
