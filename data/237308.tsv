2006-12-23T13:27:00.000Z	agent	idlemind	uhm... if you are using ftp "live" on a production website then something is wrong... i have a webserver installed on my computer for testing the whole website and upload the finished product... doing it otherwise is... well... horrible
2006-12-23T13:29:00.000Z	idlemind	thoreauputic	yes code can be correct but it is always said in programming that clean/documented code is MUCH easier to maintain
2006-12-23T13:29:00.000Z	agent	idlemind	but even "quick and dirty" websites can be done much quicker by hand... i mean: look how quick i can write: <table><tr><td></td</tr></table>  compared to open app -> wait to load -> select create table -> fill in everything -> ok ;)
