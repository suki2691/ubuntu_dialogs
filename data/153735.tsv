2006-12-26T09:31:00.000Z	epitiphlitis		Im thinking of installing ubuntu, is 6.10 stable or should i stick with dapper?
2006-12-26T09:32:00.000Z	epitiphlitis		ok, cool, thanks for the info
2006-12-26T09:32:00.000Z	vox754	epitiphlitis	yes it is stable
2006-12-26T09:34:00.000Z	vox754	epitiphlitis	it should be "stable" in order to be released to the general public. Some guys are already trying 7.04, now that is risky.
