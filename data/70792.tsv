2008-12-24T03:53:00.000Z	Fiskah_		I'm trying to reinstall ubuntu desktop. When I choose "use whole disk" under the partition screen it does nothing. Therefore I click manual. Can anyone tell me which partitions I have to create for it to work?

2008-12-24T03:55:00.000Z	Fiskah_	n8tuser	I get to the screen where I can create partitions
2008-12-24T03:55:00.000Z	n8tuser	Fiskah_	-> okay, now per someones advise, create a /, /home, swap partitions as minimum,  make them like 8gig 20gig+ and 2x rams size respectively
