2006-07-08T15:34:00.000Z	Warbo	echeese	Yes, but it is not in the repos since it has to be compiled for 32bit
2006-07-08T15:35:00.000Z	echeese	Warbo	how could I get wine running somewhat stabley on my amd64 macheen?
2006-07-08T15:36:00.000Z	Warbo	echeese	There is linux32, which seems a better option but I don't know how to use it, or there is a 32bit chroot (which I tried to get working for a mate and ended up having to link about 50 programs from the chroot to the main Ubuntu system :( )
