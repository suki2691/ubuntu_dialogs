2006-08-29T07:56:00.000Z	Arclite		I love Ubuntu... it's helped me switch 3 of my friends to Mac OS X. Thanks, guys!
2006-08-29T07:56:00.000Z	kjm	Arclite	: Ubuntu has switched people to OS X???  How does that make Ubuntu look good?
2006-08-29T07:57:00.000Z	kjm		I admit, I have an iBook which I dual boot with, and OS X is good.....but that is insane
2006-08-29T07:58:00.000Z	Arclite	kjm	Axe_: Ubuntu showed them that Windows wasn't all it was cracked up to be. They wouldn't look at the Mac OS, they were too biased against it being "gay" and "slow" and "crap". Ubuntu was a stepping stone.
