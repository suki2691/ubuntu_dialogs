2009-01-28T21:05:00.000Z	j-b-r		Why are my installation files corrupt?
2009-01-28T21:06:00.000Z	j-b-r		I'm doing everything right. My hashes and sums are correct, my drive burned at the slowest speed, and I tried multiple versions and discs.
2009-01-28T21:06:00.000Z	sipior	j-b-r	have you tried another drive?
2009-01-28T21:09:00.000Z	sipior	j-b-r	recently? drives all fail eventually... which operating system are you doing the burn from? try another perhaps?
