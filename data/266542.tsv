2010-05-04T17:37:00.000Z	yohannbzh		Hello. When we close a terminal in which we have run some things, it closes them. Is there a way to list all the process we have run from this terminal?
2010-05-04T17:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	yohannbzh	 run somthing with '&' at the end.. and use the 'exit' command - do NOT just hit the terminals close button
2010-05-04T17:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	yohannbzh	 asio check out the 'nohup' command and docs on bash job controll.
