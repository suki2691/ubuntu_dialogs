2007-05-01T10:07:00.000Z	ras		Im a Ubuntu edgy eft user, I have a really stable system now, is there any real reason to dist-upgrade?
2007-05-01T10:07:00.000Z	Pelo	ras	 if you are happy you don't need to upgrade
2007-05-01T10:08:00.000Z	ras	Pelo	but am I missing out of ant "fiesty fun"?
2007-05-01T10:09:00.000Z	Pelo	ras	 there isnt, much fun in feisty , the only things that are realy different if your system works on edgy is compiz pre installed and  automaticaly loading codecs, if you already have those in edgy you'Re fine
