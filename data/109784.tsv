2008-03-27T01:40:00.000Z	Saftle		have a quick question regarding Ubuntu Server 7.10 Gutsy. Did a normal install with the only additional module bing Lamp. For some reason on every machine that I try it on, it seems to hang up on the part where it says "Running Local boot scripts (/etc/rc.local)    [OK]. Any idea how to get past this into the GUI, or does ubuntu server not have gnome preloaded? Thanks and I hope someone could help me out.
