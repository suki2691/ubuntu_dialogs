2010-02-16T02:18:00.000Z	cmpsalvestrini	BusMaster	have you tried looking for the drivers with the driver tool provided in Ubuntu?
2010-02-16T02:19:00.000Z	BusMaster	cmpsalvestrini	yes, and the only drivers listed are for nvidia. Next, I tried getting the sta driver and then the b43-fwcutter and still nothing except nvidia is listed in the hardware drivers
2010-02-16T02:20:00.000Z	BusMaster	cmpsalvestrini	can you sent that offer again? i made a mistake accept it
