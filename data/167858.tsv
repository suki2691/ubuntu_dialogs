2007-09-11T08:52:00.000Z	linux4me		db42 - we are in the process of migrating from gentoo to ubuntu. had major issues with trying to get the iptables compiled under gentoo. along came ubuntu fiesty which now only comes with a lamp setup for you but you are done in a matter of mins. approx 15-20mins
2007-09-11T08:52:00.000Z	linux4me		the ubuntu developers did an awesome job with fiesty
2007-09-11T08:52:00.000Z	DB42	linux4me	i dont have any issues with gentoo too much, besidse now only to update it all
