2007-10-12T08:50:00.000Z	gregorovius		i've just upgraded to gutsy... what's the difference between the 386 and the generic kernel image?
2007-10-12T08:52:00.000Z	gregorovius		I got a Pentium D, which one should I use?
2007-10-12T08:53:00.000Z	LtL	gregorovius	- the amd-generic kernel for intel D is what you want
2007-10-12T08:56:00.000Z	gregorovius	LtL	by amd-generic you mean generic?
