Now all a sudden its sound is gone something with ALSA i think in WINE conf. Need to know what I can modify to return sound. Since it sometimes works and other times just no sound at all.

2011-03-13T22:04:00.000Z	needlez	ThinkT510	not that either. It has to do with WINE configuration and how its sound is setup to interact with Alsa or Pulse-audio not which to have set to.
