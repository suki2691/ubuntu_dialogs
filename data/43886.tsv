2009-11-02T05:22:00.000Z	Guest18457	Guest19529	if your file is called foo.tar.gz you can unzip it with "tar xzvf foo.tar.gz"
2009-11-02T05:24:00.000Z	Guest18457	Guest19529	if the file is unzipped then it should no longer be a .tar.gz file.  How are you trying to run it?
2009-11-02T05:26:00.000Z	Guest19529	Guest18457	so what do i need to do after its extracted?
