2009-10-04T00:43:00.000Z	Quasar1048		Get a Nvida card...
2009-10-04T00:44:00.000Z	switch10__	Quasar1048	I agree I will never buy an ati card again
2009-10-04T00:46:00.000Z	Quasar1048	switch10__	although... I have to thank the ATI cards. Without them, I wouldn't know half as much as I do about xorg.conf. lol. I can fix graphics issues weel.
