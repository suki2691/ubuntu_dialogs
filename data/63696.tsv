2009-03-10T20:44:00.000Z	HappyHater		does a lot of good asking questions in here...
2009-03-10T20:46:00.000Z	HappyHater		why the hell did they get rid of the displayconfig utility, that's fucking stupid...
2009-03-10T20:46:00.000Z	bigrigger	HappyHater	my intrepid box has no displayconfig-gtk, bit the hardy box does have it. does that answer your question?
