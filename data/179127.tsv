2011-02-04T19:09:00.000Z	Phuzzy		ok so that kinda helped... my main problem persists however...
2011-02-04T19:09:00.000Z	Phuzzy		i need to install cvs... which has now been replaced by cvsnt ist seems. cvsnt is, however, broken, not apt
2011-02-04T19:10:00.000Z	jrib	Phuzzy	cvs is still in the repositories
2011-02-04T19:10:00.000Z	jrib	Phuzzy	or do you know you want cvsnt?  In that case tell us how exactly it is "broken"
