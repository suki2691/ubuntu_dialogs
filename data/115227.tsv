2008-04-22T16:29:00.000Z	thinman1189	achadwick	I have the torrent, how do I get it to recognize the file I already have?
2008-04-22T16:30:00.000Z	achadwick	thinman1189	depends on the client software you use to torrent. I'd experiment a bit, see if it's making new files when you try, and stopping it if it is.
