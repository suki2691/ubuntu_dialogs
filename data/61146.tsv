So yeah, you need to type in the password regardless of the permissions on the .deb.

2012-04-16T07:04:00.000Z	Blizzerand		How do I do that
2012-04-16T07:17:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Blizzerand	Sorry I misunderstood you.  Looking at the man pages, I'm not sure you can do that.  ISTR that rpm had a parameter to change the installation root but I don't think apt-get install does.  You might be able to get away with changing ownership of the files to you though.
