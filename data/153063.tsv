2009-01-18T22:56:00.000Z	isaac		uhm, i just upgraded yesterday to jaunty and it completely hangs out starting either gnome or kde, blackbox or other window managers work ok
2009-01-18T22:56:00.000Z	isaac		i'd say it has something to do with xrandr
2009-01-18T22:56:00.000Z	isaac		is this the right place to ask about jaunty issues?
