2010-03-07T18:47:00.000Z	knums	alankila	yes i could, but y should i use this. i need .NET for good skripts. so i also can write c# or any other program ... there is no simple skript-language like bash/ksh/csh
2010-03-07T18:47:00.000Z	alankila	knums	how about vbs? I don't really know that much about microsoft technologies, but I imagine Microsoft does have some kind of scripting language equivalents these days.
2010-03-07T18:49:00.000Z	knums	alankila	i tried vbs ... its okay. but i don't spend much time in it. my skripts at this moment only in 'batch' ...
