2010-10-03T19:37:00.000Z	zth		when i plug in an USB device (it's a dj-interface) where can i find it's physical location inside ubuntu? /dev/something?
2010-10-03T19:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	zth	do « tail -f /var/log/messages » then plug the device
2010-10-03T19:41:00.000Z	zth	erUSUL	thanks! but it dont seem to give me an actual location...?
2010-10-03T19:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	zth	maybe there is no driver for that hard ?
