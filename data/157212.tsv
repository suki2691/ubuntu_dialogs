2008-01-15T11:10:00.000Z	xibalba		hey i just installed ubuntu 6.06lts, i know if i change my IP which is currently getting it's net info via DHCP it will break sudo. how should i go about preventing breaking sudo when i want to change my IP?
2008-01-15T11:11:00.000Z	xibalba		so how can i switch ips without breaking SUDO
