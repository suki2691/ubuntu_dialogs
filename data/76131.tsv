2009-08-05T01:11:00.000Z	beefheart		Ill refrase myself, Is there anyway to have a lancher change xorg.conf for one sertain application, to then later switch back when exiting the application. ?
2009-08-05T01:13:00.000Z	porter1	beefheart	no. xorg.conf applies to the entire x server
2009-08-05T01:14:00.000Z	beefheart	porter1	thats no problem for me. I have to edit the conf every time im launcing the app in either case
