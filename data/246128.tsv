2009-03-16T01:02:00.000Z	clueneeded		Someone done told me to isntall the new alpha version 9... so I started to...  then I now see the screen that warns me "It is absolutely necessary to run liloconfig(8) when you complete this process and execute /sbin/lilo after this."  Well that looks too dangerous for a newbie, so I want to just cancel this altogether.  No cancel button.  How to cancel this upgrade install?
