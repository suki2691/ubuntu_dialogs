2006-04-03T11:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Maniqui	 tells grub to load that drives mbr and pass controll to it. i think
2006-04-03T11:41:00.000Z	Maniqui	Dr_Willis	could it be related with the crashes that I have when choosing WinXP *after* rebooting from Ubuntu?
2006-04-03T11:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Maniqui	 i doubt it
