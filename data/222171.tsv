2005-10-27T16:31:00.000Z	haffe		Hi, I have this wierd problem. Whenever I try to play a videofile with totem, the sound comes before the video. I have this problem on all my files. What could this be?
2005-10-27T16:31:00.000Z	slibs	haffe	probably the lack of codecs
2005-10-27T16:32:00.000Z	slibs	haffe	or is that problem only with totem?
2005-10-27T16:32:00.000Z	haffe	slibs	I haven't tried any players other than totem.
