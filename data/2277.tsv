2012-06-25T04:20:00.000Z	IveBeenBit		How do I turn off all the "so and so joined" and "so and so" left messages in IRC? Is there a command for that?
2012-06-25T04:21:00.000Z	wifiman	IveBeenBit	i suspect it would be specific to your client
2012-06-25T04:22:00.000Z	IveBeenBit	wifiman	- I'm using the web client so probably a slash command - / ....?
2012-06-25T04:22:00.000Z	wifiman	IveBeenBit	never used it but /help might give you a command list
