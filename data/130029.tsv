2009-11-20T00:44:00.000Z	eTiger13	funkiwan	did you change the permissions somehow?
2009-11-20T00:45:00.000Z	funkiwan	eTiger13	Not that I know of. The only reason it occured to me to run it as root was b/c I saw this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/421059
2009-11-20T00:46:00.000Z	funkiwan	eTiger13	I was running kubuntu, and then after I upgraded to karmic I decided to run gnome. I haven't been able to run nautilus since I made the switch. Never ran it before, just used Dolphin.
