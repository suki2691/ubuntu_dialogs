2007-01-02T06:54:00.000Z	kenthomson	grimboy	manually?
2007-01-02T07:14:00.000Z	grimboy	kenthomson	All you can do is use wine/cxoffice or send something to adobe. Shockwave is dead.
2007-01-02T07:14:00.000Z	kenthomson	grimboy	i am using wine and following (!shocwave's instructions) but still i am stuck somewhere, if you have done the config, maybe you could help me
