2006-08-13T13:51:00.000Z	yoshiznit123	sgcplayer	try gconf-editor, going to apps/nautilus/desktop and changing which icons you want on your desktop
2006-08-13T13:52:00.000Z	sgcplayer	yoshiznit123	I'll try that
2006-08-13T14:00:00.000Z	sgcplayer	yoshiznit123	the only thing in that "folder" that looks close is "volumes_visible" and it has a box that's already checked
