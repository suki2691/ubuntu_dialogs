2005-03-08T09:29:00.000Z	smick		I'm wondering why my liveCD has a user name and password, and I can't find what it might be.  really strange.
2005-03-08T09:30:00.000Z	Xappe	smick	have you tried ubuntu:ubuntu?
2005-03-08T09:31:00.000Z	Xappe	smick	hmm...I think so, but i'm not really sure cause i've only used a ubuntu live cd once
