2007-12-14T01:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Iwanowitch	try checking the changelog
2007-12-14T01:24:00.000Z	Iwanowitch	tonyyarusso	last change in 2004, I guess not... What knowledge/resources are required to start maintaining it? I'm not promising anything, but it would help out many students in my class.
2007-12-14T01:26:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Iwanowitch	That'd be a question for #ubuntu-motu
