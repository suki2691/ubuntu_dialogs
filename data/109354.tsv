2007-12-18T23:12:00.000Z	bazhang	nickwebcoukok	not sure what you mean--have you checked gnome-look?
2007-12-18T23:13:00.000Z	nickwebcoukok	bazhang	yeah - theres a few, but I cant figure out what one to choose -i.e compiz, beryl or thers, any I try to download load as invalid themes in Apperance preferances..
