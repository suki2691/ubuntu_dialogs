2012-01-11T06:27:00.000Z	ld50		But these additional drivers are for the running system arent they? Doesnt have anything to do with what gets installed?
2012-01-11T06:29:00.000Z	ld50		Ok, different question. Can I get my installed ubuntu to boot without starting X11?
2012-01-11T06:30:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ld50	why?
