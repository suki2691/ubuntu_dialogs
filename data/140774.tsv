2008-06-26T11:11:00.000Z	Jester45	Bennie	you should use aptitude or apt-get not both, it can cause problems switching between to the 2
2008-06-26T11:13:00.000Z	Bennie	Jester45	aptitude update and apt-get update is the same operation, no?
2008-06-26T11:14:00.000Z	Jester45	Bennie	they do the same thing but aptitude uses an extented database of infomation that apt-get doesnt uses so installing programs with both may lead to problems. im just giving you advice you can use both if you want its completly up to you
