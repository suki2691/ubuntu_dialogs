2007-02-12T11:08:00.000Z	ltk05		I'm just wondering, but is it possible to install Cedega on ubuntu via apt-get. I've tried, but it says it couldn't find it. Should I maybe add some other repositories? Thanks in advance

2007-02-12T11:09:00.000Z	ltk05	shatrat	ok, thanks! I'll try compiling it, though I havent' been lucky with that (yet)
