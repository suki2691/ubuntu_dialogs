2006-10-28T08:22:00.000Z	megadom	factotum	from now on...try the new versions of Ubuntu or *nix version in VMWare prior to updating your computer...it has saved me many of Tylenol(R)
2006-10-28T08:23:00.000Z	factotum	megadom	haha, thanks im already at the buggy opinion right now
2006-10-28T08:26:00.000Z	megadom	factotum	nice...I said that when I just installed Microsoft Vista Ultimate RC1 over my XP Pro and wiped out all my life's bookmarks in IE and Firefox....I know the feeling
