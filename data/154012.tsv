2007-01-11T14:39:00.000Z	Marupa		Hi, uh, very new to ubuntu.  How does one go about installing a uniprocessor kernel?
2007-01-11T14:40:00.000Z	un_operateur	Marupa	if you have a single processor, an uniprocessor kernel is installed for you .. its the default
2007-01-11T14:43:00.000Z	Marupa	un_operateur	 ubuntu states, via uname -a that I'm running SMP kernel.  I know I only have one CPU.
2007-01-11T14:44:00.000Z	un_operateur	Marupa	hmm, is there a specific reason for wanting to change that?
