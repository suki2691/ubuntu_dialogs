2010-02-07T05:41:00.000Z	promet1		 i just installed a new laptop battery and karmic seems to have trouble recognizing it. the power-manager says 'full', but when AC is unplugged the laptop shuts down  cold from lack of power, any insights?
2010-02-07T05:43:00.000Z	IdleOne	promet1	did you allow the battery to charge? I am not even sure if that needs to be done but it would seem logical to me
2010-02-07T05:44:00.000Z	IdleOne	promet1	that was my only guess, sorry can't help more.
