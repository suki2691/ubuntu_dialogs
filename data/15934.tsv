2011-04-30T11:55:00.000Z	yigal		does anyone use vim and has just installed 11.04?  I don't have syntax highlighting and I was wondering if anyone has/had a similar issue, or or fixed this?
2011-04-30T11:57:00.000Z	taglass	yigal	try installing vim-gnome or just vim  The vim that ships by default is pretty stripped down
2011-04-30T11:57:00.000Z	yigal	taglass	I know, but I have both installed
2011-04-30T11:58:00.000Z	yigal	taglass	there is no vim-full in 11.04 which I find interesting
