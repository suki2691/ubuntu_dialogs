2006-06-14T08:07:00.000Z	MarcN	thechris	I'm thinking of building a myth box this summer.  What problems are you having?
2006-06-14T08:08:00.000Z	thechris	MarcN	none yet, i'm actually having issues in gentoo and wanting to switch to *buntu
2006-06-14T08:09:00.000Z	thechris	MarcN	but i really hate it when i'm using a distro that is missing a lot of packages i use, or is missing vital packages.
