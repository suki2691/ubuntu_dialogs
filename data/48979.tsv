2009-09-07T14:40:00.000Z	jbu_	Flannel	ah, I do not have the server version so I'm downloading the server headers right now
2009-09-07T14:41:00.000Z	Flannel	jbu_	You can just install the server kernel: sudo apt-get install linux-server
2009-09-07T14:41:00.000Z	jbu_	Flannel	yeah that appears to be how to isntall PAE, in fact it's done installing now so I'll reboot and tell u guys how it went
