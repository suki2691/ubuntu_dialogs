2009-06-19T01:11:00.000Z	krunk-|work		so I want to set up the ubuntu server so that system mails are relayed through my isp's smtp. what's the most straight forward way of doing so?
2009-06-19T01:12:00.000Z	krunk-|work		maybe I'll just uninstall exim4 and do it with postfix
2009-06-19T01:14:00.000Z	krunk-|work		does ubuntu "count on exim4" I'm not familiar with exim, but wouldn't want to break anything by uninstalling it
2009-06-19T01:15:00.000Z	jrib	krunk-|work	if you try to remove it and "ubuntu" needs it, it will tell you
