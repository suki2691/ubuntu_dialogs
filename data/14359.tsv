2011-05-25T22:05:00.000Z	phox_		Does anyone here have experience with this perl script for many archives in the same folder? http://www.ubuntugeek.com/unp-unpack-almost-everything-with-one-command.html

2011-05-25T22:09:00.000Z	phox_	Almehdi	Not in this case. I have hundreds of GB's that need to be unarchived and then I want the archives themself removed.
