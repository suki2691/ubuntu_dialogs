2008-10-30T16:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	kantor	 the standard answer is 'when its done' :)
2011-12-05T23:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	kantor	 if the xorg.conf exists. its used.  what driver are you trying to not use?
2011-12-05T23:19:00.000Z	kantor	dr_willis	It is not used, I checked that (because of modeset is used) I have troubles with the Xorg intel driver, I have an intel video card. The display it;s ok for about 10, 15, 20 minutes . . .  then goes blank and nothing can be done, restart is needed (numlock key is not working any more for instance)
