2007-07-22T13:01:00.000Z	student_modnar	gravemind	mkfs.vfat /dev/fd0 should work for you
2007-07-22T13:01:00.000Z	gravemind	student_modnar	yay! thanks. this is readable in win 98, right?
2007-07-22T13:01:00.000Z	student_modnar	gravemind	should be, might check the man page on it, I haven't personally done it
