2006-01-13T16:22:00.000Z	bimberi	netstar	yes, same here, but  you can change the application though?
2006-01-13T16:22:00.000Z	netstar	bimberi	xchat is present for you also? Yes I can change the application, it's just a little ugly.
2006-01-13T16:26:00.000Z	bimberi	netstar	no, no xchat - and i can't remove anything either (even with 'sudo nautilus' - yes i know that's naughty :) )
