2005-05-07T16:20:00.000Z	DigitalFox|PDA		I dislike both MS Office and OpenOffice
2005-05-07T16:20:00.000Z	DigitalFox|PDA		I like Abiword/Gnumeric far better
2005-05-07T16:20:00.000Z	DigitalFox|PDA		Only reason I don't use Abiword more is that I can't do subscripts
2005-05-07T16:20:00.000Z	nickrud	DigitalFox|PDA	I tried hard, but Gnumeric print control sucks, and I could never get a graphic into a header in abiword
