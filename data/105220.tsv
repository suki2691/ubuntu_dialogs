2010-08-05T21:05:00.000Z	Aaron2		hey guys , I have installed ubuntu (fresh 10.04) from USB (after it wont boot from CD or USB , usb boots only with nomodeset parm) now screen goes black after choosing ubuntu from grub and system seems to be up (can hear startup audio playing) yet screen is blacked out. (with "nomodeset" on from grub I get CAPSLOCK and SCROLLLCOK leds blinking and system hang black screened) what can I do to fix that ?
