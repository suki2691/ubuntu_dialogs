2008-03-14T08:19:00.000Z	Hamled		my sound is working, but the computer still uses the internal pc speaker for some things, like when I try to backspace on the console and there are no characters to remove, or I use tab completion and it doesn't find anything
2008-03-14T08:19:00.000Z	Hamled		is there any way to make all the error sounds go through alsa?
2008-03-14T08:20:00.000Z	nickrud	Hamled	that's the system bell, you can turn it off at   edit->current profile
2008-03-14T08:21:00.000Z	nickrud	Hamled	 for those, system->prefs->sound system-beep iirc
