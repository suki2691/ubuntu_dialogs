2008-03-10T07:20:00.000Z	wolferine		my LCD TV can go to 1366X768, but its currently, in Ubuntu, only able to hit 1024X768, how can I allow for more res. ?
2008-03-10T07:21:00.000Z	sFEARs	wolferine	i think we've already figured out the only ways to fix
2008-03-10T07:22:00.000Z	wolferine	sFEARs	do tell, please
2008-03-10T07:25:00.000Z	wolferine	sFEARs	looks like my xorg.conf has addition res., but not the 1366x768 I wanted.  Added it manually (nvidia-settings just fumbled alot of errors)
