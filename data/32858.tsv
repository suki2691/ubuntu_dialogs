2010-05-01T20:57:00.000Z	mathepic		This has gotten to a point of extreme annoyance. I have tried 5 times with different mirrors and have yet to get a ISO with the correct checksums.
2010-05-01T20:58:00.000Z	mathepic		I've never had to use a torrent before to download the ISO though.
2010-05-01T20:59:00.000Z	mathepic		Is the normal (non-torrent) download usually like this?
