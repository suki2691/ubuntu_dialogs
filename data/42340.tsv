2010-02-23T23:48:00.000Z	chinny		Hey all - sory if this is a long one but I've got a very weird one - am hoping someone can help me out. I've got an Ubuntu 8.10 server (in VMware Esx) running with the Enhanced vmxnet nic.Â The VMware tools are installed and am able to ping internal and external IPs (it's got a NAT), however.....I cannot resolve IPs at all nor connect to the webserver on it (Apache2) or sshd. I don't even get a login prompt. I have run nmap at it and the ports are listening.
2010-02-23T23:48:00.000Z	chinny		The DNS server I'm using is working - have proven that from another host. I've even tried changing to the google public dns server (8.8.8.8) which I can ping fine but they won't work either.
2010-02-23T23:48:00.000Z	chinny		I've removed the original nic and added a new one - redone the static config for the new nic and get exactly the same. I've even recompiled and re-installed the VMware tools but no joy. Have checked /etc/hosts /etc/resolv.conf and they check out ok. Am running out of ideas now....can anyone suggest anything?
