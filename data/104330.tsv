2011-04-24T04:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lewis_	why does that need sudo? also don't run gui apps with sudo, use gksudo
2011-04-24T04:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lewis_	also, 'ubuntu 8' doesn't exist. There is 8.04 (hardy) and 8.10 (intrepid, which is EOL)
2011-04-24T04:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lewis_	and hardy on desktop is EOL when Natty is released
