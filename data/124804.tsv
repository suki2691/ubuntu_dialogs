2007-09-08T14:43:00.000Z	dispraekailo		Hello.  My hard drive recently crashed, and I had to reinstall ubuntu on a sata hdd; The only disk I had available was edgy, so I followed the instructions on http://onlyubuntu.blogspot.com/2007/03/upgrade-ubuntu-610-edgy-eft-to-ubuntu.html to upgrade to feisty as I did with my last install, via console...
2007-09-08T14:43:00.000Z	dispraekailo		However, after logging in with gdm, the desktop does not load.. the system has not frozen, in that I can still move the mouse, but I cannot access other tty's either.
2007-09-08T14:43:00.000Z	dispraekailo		How might I repair this install?
