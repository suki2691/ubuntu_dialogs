2006-04-09T06:41:00.000Z	UncleD	dj-fu	maybe. somehow i have 8.0 on my box already (not sure how)
2006-04-09T06:41:00.000Z	UncleD	dj-fu	postgresql-8.0 is already the newest version.
2006-04-09T06:43:00.000Z	dj-fu	UncleD	it's possible that the package version is locked to 7.4, or other packages are dependant on it
