2012-10-15T07:51:00.000Z	Guest24304		Having problem updating 12.04. Downloading completes correctly then dpkg error occurs and stops everything. Any ideas welcome.
2012-10-15T07:52:00.000Z	Tynach	Guest24304	what error occurs?
2012-10-15T07:55:00.000Z	Guest24304	Tynach	I'll recreate it and print the output in a second.
2012-10-15T07:55:00.000Z	Tynach	Guest24304	alright. I can't gurantee I'll be able to figure out what's going on, but at the very least knowing what went wrong will help others help you :)
