2007-07-15T16:24:00.000Z	NigelS	chris__	if you really want to make sudo not time you out you need to edit the /etc/sudoers file and use the timestamp_timeout option - set it to a negative number in order for the to never time out.  you have to use visudo to edit it; I really wouldn't recommend doing this though
