2010-08-20T21:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	blindMoe	could always use: history | grep mys | tail -n 1     ;)
2010-08-20T21:48:00.000Z	blindMoe	ActionParsnip	hehe I could but I had a server where I could literally just type 'mys' and hit the up arrow and it would search my history for me and autocomplete the string
