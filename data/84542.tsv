2008-07-26T07:02:00.000Z	Daisuke_Ido	Ryan_Delaney	the only dumb question is the one that doesn't get asked - the ubuntu channels are great places to hang out for general info :)
2008-07-26T07:03:00.000Z	Ryan_Delaney	Daisuke_Ido	Great thanks. My first attempt installing linux was redhat back in 2002, and any question I asked anywhere I got mocked and told to RTFM, which were all full of jargon. ubuntu community is great for beginners
2008-07-26T07:03:00.000Z	Daisuke_Ido	Ryan_Delaney	bout the same as my first attempt - was with fedora core 2 :\
