I have one shared on my desktop which is 8.10 and i am trying to reconnect to it from my laptop (8.04.1) that I had connected to it from a week ago. I had connected the laptop to the printer via usb once since I had it shared so i assume thats why its not connected via cups anymore. but how can I reconnect it?
