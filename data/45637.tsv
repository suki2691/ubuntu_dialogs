2010-09-21T01:27:00.000Z	manlymatt83		I already wiped, but it would be a shame to have to go back to 9.10
2010-09-21T01:27:00.000Z	c3l	manlymatt83	when at the splash screen, can you enter any of the consoles? ctrl+alt+1
2010-09-21T01:29:00.000Z	manlymatt83	c3l	I can indeed.  If I hit escape I can even get to the terminals.  It isn't locking up, just hanging.
