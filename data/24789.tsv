2010-10-15T07:54:00.000Z	Sivarts		anyone had luck getting a Nvidia MX4000 to work with linux, I have tried several distros and none of them will work
2010-10-15T07:56:00.000Z	bjsnider	Sivarts	i assume you contacted nvidia about this. what did they say?
2010-10-15T07:57:00.000Z	Sivarts	bjsnider	no I just bought the cards, I think MX4000 just has issues with linux compatbility
2010-10-15T07:58:00.000Z	bjsnider	Sivarts	that is old crap. get something newer. or get in touch with nvidia about this
