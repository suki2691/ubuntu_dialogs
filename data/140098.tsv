2007-04-07T12:21:00.000Z	kelsey435		Flanel: because the first person who was helping set up my partitions told me too
2007-04-07T12:23:00.000Z	kelsey435		since apparently the first person who was helping me told me to make a 10gb boot, can someone guide me in the right direction of what i should be doing?
