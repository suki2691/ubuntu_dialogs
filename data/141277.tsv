2007-03-28T09:28:00.000Z	Arrick		how do I perform a lookup with aptitude?
2007-03-28T09:29:00.000Z	Arrick		yeah Panzor as in to get the full name of a package
2007-03-28T09:29:00.000Z	Panzor	Arrick	well if you want to view a list of the full names and descriptions, you can always use the "ADD/Remove" function under Apps
2007-03-28T09:30:00.000Z	Arrick	Panzor	I asked for the aptitude command for a reason, I dont happen to have a GUI on this server.
