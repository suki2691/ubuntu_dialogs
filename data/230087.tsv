2006-04-13T06:38:00.000Z	Pupeno	dylan_	because the pacakges are more up to date and since it is oriented towards desktop it makes a better desktop (for me at least)>
2006-04-13T06:39:00.000Z	dylan_	Pupeno	would you say Ubuntu is suffice even as a server?
2006-04-13T06:40:00.000Z	Pupeno	dylan_	I haven't tryed Ubuntu server, but the desktop is very robust and I spect the server will make a good server as well. In fact, I am eager to find a chance to try it.
