2009-02-16T09:59:00.000Z	corigo3		Hi I need to edit my sources.list file. How can I launch Kate from command line with admin rights?
2009-02-16T10:00:00.000Z	Pelo	corigo3	sudo kate /etc/apt/sources.list but if you have to ask you might be better using the gui
2009-02-16T10:05:00.000Z	corigo3	Pelo	I had done it your way and it failed, hence my asking. kdesu also fails, and gksu is not installed. ... Ah, now it works... hmm what did I do differently?
2009-02-16T10:06:00.000Z	Pelo	corigo3	are you running gnome or kde ?
