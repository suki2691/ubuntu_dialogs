2009-11-29T13:40:00.000Z	idefine		if I create a Private folder (encrypted with ecryptfs) why does root have the authority to get to my files by just issuing an su username. Is there a way to prevent this?

2009-11-29T13:41:00.000Z	idefine	maco	right, how can I stop that?
2009-11-29T13:41:00.000Z	maco	idefine	i dont think you can except to put your directory on a separate partition encrypted with lvm...maybe?
