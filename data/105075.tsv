2011-07-14T09:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	infinigod	su isn't a user

2011-07-14T09:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	infinigod	you may need to make a new group, add the users whom can use su to the group then change the ownership of the su binary to the group, then chmod o-x /bin/su   the users outside the group wil not be able to run the command
