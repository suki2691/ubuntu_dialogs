2011-10-16T10:18:00.000Z	zus		if i began an update via terminal and  need to disconnect off line... how can i pause and resume at a later time
2011-10-16T10:19:00.000Z	zus		i thought i would have more time - but this is taking longer than expected and i know its not good practice to interrupt the terminal
