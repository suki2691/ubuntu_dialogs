2009-01-30T08:21:00.000Z	mrpinky		hi, i accidentally removed my "admin" group membership, so i booted into recovery mode and root console, then i used "adduser nbingham admin" to get my admin back, and i check that it is correcly applied with "id nbingham". but when i restart, i have different group memberships (not including admin). any clues? :(
