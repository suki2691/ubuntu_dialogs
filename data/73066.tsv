2010-02-17T14:41:00.000Z	Solvemon		Hello guys, I'm having some problems here. I am completely new to linux (about half an hour), so please forgive my noobness. I have a complete new Ubuntu installation, and it looks very good. I have two 22" monitors connected, and the desktop is cloned (mirrored?) on both. However, I'd like it to be extended, side by side. When I try to change this setting under System->Preferences->Display both the screens go black and the computer

2010-02-17T14:44:00.000Z	bassliner	Solvemon	HoudiniMan just pointed it out. if you're running a computer with an nvidia graphics card, maybe trying the hard way to configure it directly in xorg.conf is what you want to do.
