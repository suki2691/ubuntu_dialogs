2006-07-16T13:12:00.000Z	DrShade		I'm trying to install Ubuntu through loadlin.  I have downloaded the initrd.gz and linux and loadlin files into c:\boot and restarted in DOS mode and typed the command and I get an error loading initrd.gz that there is less than 4mb of memory?  I have a Celeron 333 with 160 megs of ram.  Any ideas?

2006-07-16T13:13:00.000Z	DrShade	skorm	I don't have any spare CDRW's and I am not sure if this computer will even boot from a cd :(
2006-07-16T13:15:00.000Z	DrShade	skorm	there is nothing about himsys in boot.ini or autoexec.bat?
