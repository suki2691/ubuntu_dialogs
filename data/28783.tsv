2010-07-20T21:03:00.000Z	thewanderer1	sudipta	it is a DBUS framework for granting rights to users without using root
2010-07-20T21:06:00.000Z	thewanderer1	sudipta	it is a system framework and I believe it should already included in your Ubuntu install... it should be safe, but I see no benefits without a supporting program
2010-07-20T21:06:00.000Z	thewanderer1	sudipta	google for policykit for more info on the project
