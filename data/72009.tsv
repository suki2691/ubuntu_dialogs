2011-06-02T02:35:00.000Z	boson12		I am trying to install a package. I am told the following: "the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
2011-06-02T02:35:00.000Z	boson12		configure, build, and install this package." Does this mean that I need to input such commands followed by the package name?
