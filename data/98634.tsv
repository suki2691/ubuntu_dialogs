2008-03-03T20:16:00.000Z	stevecasper		is there a big difference between ubuntu and xubuntu?
2008-03-03T20:16:00.000Z	malocite	stevecasper	Xubuntu uses Xfce instead of gnome, its more for low power machines, or people that don't want gnome
2008-03-03T20:17:00.000Z	stevecasper	malocite	thanks, ill prob stick to ubuntu then
2008-03-03T20:18:00.000Z	malocite	stevecasper	Yeah, I have a machine running mythbuntu (ubuntu optimised for mythtv) and it uses xfce, I don't really like it, but its all I need for that box :)
