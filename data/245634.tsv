2008-04-15T15:07:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n		 I just followed the howto to install mplayer and the mplayerplug-in.. got it all configured.. but when i goto apple.com to watch some trailers (which was why i installed it) i get audio and no video. and none of the forum posts i am pulling up on that issue are particularly helpful.. can someone assist and tell me what step i may have forgotten?
