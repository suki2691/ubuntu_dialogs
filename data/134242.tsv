2007-05-14T10:47:00.000Z	PriceChild	LuisGMarine_	you purchased cedega *and* support for it. Ask transgaming :)
2007-05-14T10:47:00.000Z	LuisGMarine_	PriceChild	they are a bunch of tards, they don't help me at all
2007-05-14T10:48:00.000Z	PriceChild	LuisGMarine_	installing should just be a matter of dpkg -i name_of.deb
