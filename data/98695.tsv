2008-03-02T12:05:00.000Z	omnistegan		Hey guys, I installed Wine but it didn't create a ~/.wine/ folder. When I try to run an application with wine, it tells me it fails to create it. The folder is chomodded 777, any suggestions? I've tried reinstalling wine to no avail

2008-03-02T12:07:00.000Z	omnistegan	nickrud	When I try to open the wine config it simply doesn't do anything, no error, when I tried it in a terminal it just brought me to the next line without doing anything
