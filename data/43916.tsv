2010-02-06T16:17:00.000Z	rubymonk		Hello everyone, When my daugther messed with my computer, she seem to have disabled the applications at startup (nm-applet for example...) Any help to re-enable it please?
2010-02-06T16:18:00.000Z	rubymonk		Sounds like no applications defined in gnome-applications-properties is starting up
