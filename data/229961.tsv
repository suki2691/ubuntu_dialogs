2006-07-24T14:59:00.000Z	miguelv06		to install windows and ubuntu in the same computer should i make two partitions on the windows instalation and then just format one and use the other one for linux?
2006-07-24T14:59:00.000Z	tristanmike	miguelv06	that's how I did it :)
2006-07-24T14:59:00.000Z	tristanmike	miguelv06	but I also use a FAT32 partition for shared files b/w windows and linux
