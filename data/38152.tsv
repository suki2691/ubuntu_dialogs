2010-01-29T12:55:00.000Z	Guest67480		I'm trying to get a program to start using 'Startup Applications Preferences', but I just want it to open in the system tray, not have its window pop up everytime my comp starts. Is there something I need to add in the 'command' box?

2010-01-29T12:59:00.000Z	Guest67480	mobi-sheep	Umm, Transmission?
