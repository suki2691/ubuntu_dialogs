2011-09-23T03:54:00.000Z	MTPrower		Hey guys, all my attempts at dual-booting Kubuntu and my existing installation of Windows 7 are failing. Can somebody give me some very basic, step-by-step information?
2011-09-23T03:55:00.000Z	MTPrower		Actually, ideally, I don't even want to use Windows 7. I just want to get Kubuntu working on my hard drive without losing my many gigs of files. I've been reading for the last two days and trying all sorts of stuff
