2012-11-28T14:42:00.000Z	RJ45-Q		has anyone here ever tried DLNA program 'Rygel' and found it does not work, then looked online for a solution, but found nothing?, well guess what guys!, I figured out a fix all by myself!: change the 'port number' to '1900'... YOU ARE WELCOME!
2012-11-28T14:43:00.000Z	RJ45-Q		I have no account on forums, somebody please update them with the fix for Rygel I just mentioned.
