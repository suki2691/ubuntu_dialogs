2008-05-17T15:48:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder		can anyone tell me what Grub error 17 is?
2008-05-17T15:49:00.000Z	perlmonkey	CorpseFeeder	error 17 on grub means the filesystem is inaccessible
2008-05-17T15:51:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	perlmonkey	ok.. I was trying to format the drive and make a new installation of ubuntu over a previous installation. I think there was still the old grub data left over. How do I remove it completely? Will supergrub do it?
2008-05-17T15:54:00.000Z	perlmonkey	CorpseFeeder	sorry i do not know for sure, formatting should remove it.. maybe this is helpful: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/4494
