2006-10-20T06:35:00.000Z	volvoguy	Paddy_EIRE	there's a new Flash 9 (perhaps beta) for Linux available that supposed to fix that.
2006-10-20T06:35:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	volvoguy	you say its beta is it stable?
2006-10-20T06:35:00.000Z	volvoguy	Paddy_EIRE	I don't know. I just read about it 5 minutes ago. :)
