2008-04-13T10:45:00.000Z	salt2		I am noob to linux and have a question.
2008-04-13T10:46:00.000Z	salt2		how would i start a process in the background, so even if i closed the terminal, it would continue to run? like the "run an application" applet for gnome-panel except in a terminal

2008-04-13T10:46:00.000Z	daymoh	salt2	like, "xeyes&"
