2007-08-15T09:52:00.000Z	srn		i just made a fresh install of 7.04 .. i've installed nvidia-glx and defined nvidia as the the driver to be used for the current device.. however, and mind you that this is on a completely fresh install, it says that there is an api mismatch and the nvidia kernel module is the wrong version. how do i fix it?
