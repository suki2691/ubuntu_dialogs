2009-09-25T07:48:00.000Z	alazyworkaholic		I'm having a problem whenever I try to play games (tremulous, supertuxkart...) After about 10 minutes of play my keyboard & mouse no longer work in the game, & nothing I do can close the game window & get back to normal desktop, but I can still ctrl-alt-F#, ctrl-alt-backspace or REISUB. Any idea what the problem is?
