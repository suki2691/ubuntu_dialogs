2009-11-03T15:14:00.000Z	nukasl		hey guys. i was upgrading from 9.04 to 9.10 (i believe...) and my laptop (hp pavillion dv6000 which i believe was recalled due to an overheating problem) overheated and shut off during the update. i had downloaded all the packages and it was probably 3/4 of the way through installing them when this happened. when I went to turn it back on, it got to the ubuntu screen with the progress/thinking bar
2009-11-03T15:14:00.000Z	nukasl		 and then shortly after gave me an fstab error (unable to mount such and such). I am now using a livecd version of U8.04. My first priority is to save all of my data (I can't recall whether I had a seperate partition for my "/home" directory. my second priority is to get 9.10 up and running ASAP. also, if anyone is familiar with my dv6000 troubles... I think it's time to rectify that as well...
2009-11-03T15:14:00.000Z	nukasl		...and if any suggestions in doing that would be much obliged.
