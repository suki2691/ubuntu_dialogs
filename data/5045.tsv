2012-04-27T06:32:00.000Z	sinedeviance	Loshki	any reason why in particular?
2012-04-27T06:35:00.000Z	Loshki	sinedeviance	gogeta: that's all great news so far, but sinedeviance asked about 'production', and that used to be a pretty high bar...
2012-04-27T06:36:00.000Z	sinedeviance	Loshki	gogeta: well, i'm going to evaluate all three releases and we'll probably roll in whatever works best later this week
