2009-03-19T01:00:00.000Z	J_el_Che		can anyone help me through un-installing an application that isn't in the Add/Remove application
2009-03-19T01:00:00.000Z	LjL	J_el_Che	depends on how you installed it.
2009-03-19T01:01:00.000Z	LjL	J_el_Che	you could have got a proper google earth package from the Medibuntu repository, keep that in mind for next time
2009-03-19T01:01:00.000Z	LjL	J_el_Che	anyway, i don't know the answer because i never installed that .bin in the first place (i used medibuntu). maybe you can run the .bin with some --option to uninstall?
