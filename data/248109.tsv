2006-05-27T08:12:00.000Z	ompaul	Madmerc	the "approved route" to do that is to take two hops one via hoary and the next via breezy to get to dapper next month, warty has no support since 1 month ago, I suggest you actually download the install for 5.10 or Dapper (the almost finished beta) and start from there
