2008-04-22T05:11:00.000Z	Atomic_UE		I have an Acer TravelMate 4234 WLMi (4230 series) laptop with a PIONEER DVD-RW DVR-K17RS (from dmesg) burner. It's supposed to read/write CDs, DVD+R(W) AND DVD-R(W), both SL and DL. However the nautilus burner plugin keeps insisting on me to put in DVD+R DL to burn any/all DVDs. It reads any DVD fine and reads/burns CDs fine, but only wants the 1 type of DVD when burning. Anything I can do to fix this?

2008-04-22T05:13:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	mphill_	not yet, was about to install something else to try it out. Just never had a problem with the nautilus-burner plugin like that before with any other burner
2008-04-22T05:13:00.000Z	mphill_	Atomic_UE	it seems very strange to me. Try k3b or something else
