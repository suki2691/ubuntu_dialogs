2012-08-29T13:57:00.000Z	samuel		my laptop has been running hot at an average 60c, i recently inadvertently removed some vital files that helped unity run
2012-08-29T13:57:00.000Z	samuel		so i logged into gnome shell and my temperatures were 10c less!
2012-08-29T13:58:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	samuel	 perhaps because unity is mopre dependent on graphics etc
