2012-09-06T14:49:00.000Z	ranveer5289		I added "PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.bin" in my .bash_profile and than logged out/in and now when I "echo $PATH" it doesn't show "~/.bin". Any ideas.?

2012-09-06T14:50:00.000Z	ranveer5289		if I try to add a normal directory like "~/bin" it works fine
2012-09-06T14:50:00.000Z	ranveer5289	MonkeyDust	ok
