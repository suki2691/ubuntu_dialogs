2011-05-27T20:55:00.000Z	jimmysparkle		hey, i have a virtualised ubuntu web-server. On tuesday i'll be working from a machine i don't have root to.
2011-05-27T20:55:00.000Z	jimmysparkle		Ideally I'd edit the /etc/hosts file to point certain domains at my webserver.
2011-05-27T20:55:00.000Z	jimmysparkle		As I won't have root access, my idea was to setup tinyDNS or equivalent. add my domains there, and then change the browsers proxy to the IP of the server, would that work?
