2008-09-09T22:19:00.000Z	carandraug	icarus-c	like I said, it's really a matter of taste. Like splitting the filesystem through dozens of partitions
2008-09-09T22:19:00.000Z	icarus-c	carandraug	which what i do too :P
2008-09-09T22:21:00.000Z	carandraug	icarus-c	and let me guess. You use different filesystems for each partition. ext2 in boot, reiserfs in /var, /ext3 at /home ...
