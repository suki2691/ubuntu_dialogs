2008-02-10T06:29:00.000Z	gigaclon		im using the CUPS web interface at localhost:631 and when i try to add a printer, it pops a username/password, I enter my username and password and it rejects it

2008-02-10T06:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gigaclon	 yep. thats the problem then i belive. You may want to check the forums/google to find the work around - or dont use the cups web interface.. I think you could set the root password also. BUt thats frowned upon.
