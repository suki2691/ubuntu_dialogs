2007-10-22T17:20:00.000Z	Pingviller		anyone know how to mount .mdf/.mds in ubuntu? I've been trying to find a solution for this for hours on google, but cdemu refuses to be compiled and converting it to .iso with mdf2iso just makes the file unusable as well

2007-10-22T17:23:00.000Z	Pingviller	chowmeined	did you even read what I said?
2007-10-22T17:23:00.000Z	chowmeined	Pingviller	yes i did, but that is your only option, so i suggest you try it again
