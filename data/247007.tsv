2005-11-25T07:10:00.000Z	EloraKun		Hey guys. Is it sensible installing 2 different distros sharing a /home mount? (Breezy + Mandriva 2006)
2005-11-25T07:11:00.000Z	EloraKun		I'm afraid of conflicts between programs versions configuration
2005-11-25T07:11:00.000Z	zorba64	EloraKun	that will work...be an idea to use different sign-in names
2005-11-25T07:12:00.000Z	zorba64	EloraKun	yep...have done it before with different id's with no probs
