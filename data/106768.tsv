2010-09-19T21:05:00.000Z	FusionX		i recently installed xubuntu 10.4 using wubi under my windows C: drive (4 GB). Now sometimes after booting up xubuntu, the screen crashes at random times and starts blinking white stripes on half of the screen. And also when xubuntu boots up the logo appears very pixelly and looks as if it is run in safe mode and before the logo appears a quick green color flashes on the screen. My xorg.0.log -->
