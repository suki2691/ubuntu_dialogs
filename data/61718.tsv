2009-08-31T10:54:00.000Z	peepsalot		i have ubuntu set to automatically log me in, but I want to try a different window manager.  the problem is if I try to log out to get to gdm, so I can switch it, it just instantly logs me back in, so I can't choose my WM

2009-08-31T10:56:00.000Z	peepsalot	grawity	ah, ok, i just found the preferences for the login screen.  I set it up that way during install, so I didn't know where to change it.
