2004-11-01T09:35:00.000Z	bhsx		howdy! i just installed late last night (i was drunk/tired) and finished configuration this morning, but don't remember the passwd I setup.  What are my possible options?  boot into knoppix and chroot?
2004-11-01T09:35:00.000Z	bhsx		anything else?
2004-11-01T09:35:00.000Z	bob2	bhsx	get into grub and set init=/bin/bash
2004-11-01T09:35:00.000Z	bob2	bhsx	I'm not sure of the exact grub syntax
