2007-03-07T11:48:00.000Z	Nitro		I've installed 7.04 on my laptop to test it, herd 5 btw. First run, I had some problems, but after some trixing it seemed to be fixed, as when I rebooted everything worked nicely. Now I changed my xorg.conf and added some resolutions, then restarted. After the bootloader was done, it just goes blank, nothing happens. Any ideas if this is a bug or something I've screwed up?
