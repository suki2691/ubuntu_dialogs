2010-07-07T00:07:00.000Z	geez		Howdy, just installed netbeans 6.9 ide from the Ubuntu Software Center. basically, a download from sun/netbeans. The install went OK. Now, no icon or way to invoke :-?
2010-07-07T00:09:00.000Z	newboon2age	geez	there's probably a command to start it from the command line.  did you try netbeans from the CL?
2010-07-07T00:10:00.000Z	newboon2age	geez	once you figure out what the invocation command is, you can create a launcher and put it on the desktop, in a menu or wherever.
2010-07-07T00:11:00.000Z	newboon2age	geez	also it might already be on the menu, but just not showing.  If you right click on the menu and pull up the menu editor, you can see if its already there (probably under programming) and then just check it so it will show.
