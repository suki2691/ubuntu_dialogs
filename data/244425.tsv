2005-07-28T11:02:00.000Z	jcapote		but is it as secure as 1.0.6
2005-07-28T11:02:00.000Z	jcapote		you could always just install inside /opt
2005-07-28T11:02:00.000Z	jasoncohen	jcapote	that's correct. if you read the security notes, it has the patches from 1.0.3, 1.0.4 and 1.0.5. 1.0.6 just was a bugfix release to fix the API changes from 1.0.5
