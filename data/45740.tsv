2010-05-10T01:31:00.000Z	UnknownFearNG	Wicked	not having any issues on my end. Did you install the non-free flash?
2010-05-10T01:31:00.000Z	Wicked	UnknownFearNG	yea. ive never experiences this before...flash is working ok...i just cannot interact with anything flash.
2010-05-10T01:33:00.000Z	UnknownFearNG	Wicked	and YouTube is an issue? I had this with 9.10 when I installed Flash. What I did was I went on the Adobe website and downloaded the Flash player instead of usin non-free. Not sure if it would work for you or not
