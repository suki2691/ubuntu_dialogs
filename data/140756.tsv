2007-06-26T07:03:00.000Z	RedPlantain	wols_	I dunno, on OS X I'm used to it appearing under /Volumes/MyDisk, and applications can access it like any normal internal disk, but under Ubuntu, I can't find it
2007-06-26T07:04:00.000Z	wols_	RedPlantain	if you don't know what a phyiscal mountpoint is, why do you use the word then?
2007-06-26T07:04:00.000Z	RedPlantain	wols_	It's what I've always called it under OS X, I was guessing the terminology would be the same across platforms
