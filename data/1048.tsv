2012-10-24T18:31:00.000Z	donofrio	klpkt	- alsamixer resolves that
2012-10-24T18:32:00.000Z	donofrio		anyone know about the missing packages for unity compiz-core-abiversion-20120920 and libnux-abiversion-20120917.01
2012-10-24T18:32:00.000Z	klpkt	donofrio	Yeah, I know that, and I use it, but I have to fix it every single time... Isn't there a way to do it automatically?
