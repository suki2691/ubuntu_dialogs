2010-03-30T14:54:00.000Z	gottto	Untitled_obly	have a look in /user/bin for something like cairodock
2010-03-30T14:56:00.000Z	gottto	Untitled_obly	it is part of the file system - open filemanager the the folder /user
2010-03-30T15:07:00.000Z	gottto	Untitled_obly	sorry about that - there was a way without reinstalling but of course you couldn't ask...
