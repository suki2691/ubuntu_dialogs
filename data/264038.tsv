2006-02-26T09:01:00.000Z	miketech		I wanna install dapper drake for testing parallel to a windows/Mandriva system. Is dapper working good enough at the moment to install it on this machine?
2006-02-26T09:02:00.000Z	miketech		Or is the installation process buggy at the moment?
2006-02-26T09:02:00.000Z	LinuxJones	miketech	I am running dapper and it seems fine for me.
