2006-06-27T05:44:00.000Z	Sohail		Hello everyone
2006-06-27T05:45:00.000Z	Sohail		can someone give me an idea on how to install dapper from an iso image on a windows partition
2006-06-27T05:45:00.000Z	Seveas	Sohail	burn the image to disc, boot from the burned disc
2006-06-27T05:46:00.000Z	Seveas	Sohail	then order a free cd from shipit.ubuntu.com and wait a few weeks
