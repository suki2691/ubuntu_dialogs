This desktop would only connect at 54mbps so I downloaded the latest drivers and compiled them, then unloaded the kernel module, ran "sudo make install" and reloaded the kernel module. then brought up the interface but networkmanager doesn't show that i have a wifi card anymore

2010-08-03T23:49:00.000Z	Grouper		i tried installing wicd, which seems to work but when i try to connect the entire computer just freezes at the point where it says something about generating a WPA file in wicd
