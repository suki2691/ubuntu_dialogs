2007-08-29T07:21:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	baikonur	not my problem... Adian's
2007-08-29T08:34:00.000Z	baikonur	Carroarmato0	did Adian say if he had success with wicd? I tried it and couldn't connect to my wlan although it said I were connected. no error message nothing. and the log in /opt/wicd/data didn't contain anything helpful. these GUIs seem to be in an too early state of development.
2007-08-29T08:35:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	baikonur	haven't had any feedback from Adian yet...
