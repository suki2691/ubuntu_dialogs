2006-01-25T17:27:00.000Z	starla		I'm really new here... and I don't know how to describe my problem.  I backed up a bunch of data to dvd last week, and then reinstalled ubuntu breezy.  now my dvd burner acts as if I've inserted a blank dvd when I insert my backup discs.  I know there's data on it because I can "see" it when I flip the disc over. anyone have some idea what I can do to recover my data?

2006-01-25T17:30:00.000Z	starla	tolstoy	yeah I could read the dvd on the drive I burned it on, but I didn't test it on another drive. i should have.
