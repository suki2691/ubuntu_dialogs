2008-04-04T01:13:00.000Z	jkonami		hey guys.  so I have an ati card, and i've gotten it to half work, but I started messing with it because full screen video was choppy.. compiz worked, other stuff.. installed ati binaries then everything seemed slow responsiveness-wise.. so whats the best thing to do?  right now it defaulted to vesa but I have xorg.conf backups that sorta-kinda worked
2008-04-04T01:14:00.000Z	jkonami		I want perfectly working ati drivers if possible.. fullscreen video smooth, compiz, everything
2008-04-04T01:15:00.000Z	Lamego	jkonami	ask to ATI :)
2008-04-04T01:15:00.000Z	jkonami	Lamego	I don't need perfect drivers persay, just whatever the best thing to do currently is
