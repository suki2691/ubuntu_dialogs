2012-11-16T08:38:00.000Z	javierf_		Hi! Is there a way to have wine 1.4 and 1.5 at the same time in the same ubuntu? I need to have installed 1.4, which works with crossover linux XI, but I saw some programs like photoshop are working with 1.5 and I would like to have it. So, is it possible? thanks!!

2012-11-16T08:40:00.000Z	javierf_	steale	I see. So compiling would be the only way. Let's say, if I already have 1.4 installed, I would download 1.5 source code and compile it and have both working
2012-11-16T08:52:00.000Z	javierf_	steale	why is it possible to install both from the source and not from the deb package?
