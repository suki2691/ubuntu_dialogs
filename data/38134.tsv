2011-07-24T16:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	jayvee	 i got a trick to start a bash shell in tty2.conf.. just a sec...
2011-07-24T16:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	jayvee	 see this --> $ pastebinit  tty6.conf
2011-07-24T16:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	jayvee	 that puts a 'emergancy' root shell on tty6 on bootup. Not a good idea from security. but good when 'testing' stuff
2011-07-24T16:41:00.000Z	jayvee	dr_willis	interesting, thanks for the tip -- although I don't understand why getty would not work where openvt would
