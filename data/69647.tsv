2011-02-26T13:17:00.000Z	natrixnatrix89		Hey. Does anyone of you have the same problem as i did - I tried to install ubuntu 10.10 from flash but it was impossible to run it. First i tried unetbootin, then usb startup disk creator, but i just cant get it work. But i can still run ubuntu 10.04 from usb..
