2011-04-09T21:36:00.000Z	stimpie		I just tried installing the natty beta and got an error  Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1), how to see more details?
2011-04-09T21:37:00.000Z	egarff	stimpie	I solved that by not having it download updates or install the 3rd party during install.
2011-04-09T21:38:00.000Z	egarff	stimpie	you can then install the updates and 3rd party stuff after it's up.
