2008-02-22T12:16:00.000Z	Sonicadvance1		I seem to be having troubles. I've compiled and installed a kernel (2.6.25-RC2) and it runs fine. But When I try compiling the Nvidia Driver's. It fails because it can't find Linux kernel headers. Anyone have experience in getting the headers installed correctly and/or the nvidia driver? :D

2008-02-22T12:17:00.000Z	ol_dude67	Sonicadvance1	why did you up date the kernel?
2008-02-22T12:17:00.000Z	Sonicadvance1	ol_dude67	For some reason, it wasn't seeing both cores of my CPU. The new kernel I compiled myself does though
