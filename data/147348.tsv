2007-11-26T04:44:00.000Z	digitalsky		I put an NTFS drive and mounted it in ubuntu, and i use samba to share it so I can access it from my XP boxes.  But after a few days when I turn on my XP, it would say fail to connect to the shared drive.  I would then restart ubuntu and the sharing is good again.
