2008-08-24T18:16:00.000Z	ThexLeopard		basically, i installed ubuntu server on the secondary drive of my parents computer, with xp on the master, and installed the boot loader into the mbr, which is on the primary device, but it comes up with error 21 and i cant boot either os anymore
2008-08-24T18:18:00.000Z	ThexLeopard		the trouble with that is it involves a 3 hour round trip to get the disk
2008-08-24T18:20:00.000Z	ThexLeopard		no, its the server disk, i did try last week installing generic with the live cd, but grub installer just plain locked everything up
