2008-12-13T22:25:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Skinkie	roger that. no known solution eh? i didn't think i'd be able to help with that.
2008-12-13T22:26:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Skinkie	but at least you have an installed kernel package! :-)
2008-12-13T22:26:00.000Z	Skinkie	onetinsoldier	yes... but i still wonder how it is possible the livecd of (x)ubuntu are not affected
