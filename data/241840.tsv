2005-06-11T08:27:00.000Z	canllaith		Hi there! I'm trying out ubuntu on a spare laptop to give it a go... and I'm currently downloading some stuff through apt. I notice it's coming from nz.archive.ubuntu.com.. I'm wondering if there is a New Zealand mirror it's putting from?

2005-06-11T08:28:00.000Z	canllaith	ajmitch	I'll look at my traffic logs I guess
