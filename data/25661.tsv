2011-03-24T17:31:00.000Z	danieldd1		Hi. I have a file with commands - one command per line. I want to execute them all simultaneously (I don't care whether I'll get the output or not). Any ideas on how to accomplish that?
2011-03-24T17:32:00.000Z	Frots	danieldd1	use &
2011-03-24T17:32:00.000Z	Frots	danieldd1	it will background the process
2011-03-24T17:51:00.000Z	danieldd1	Frots	I tried to use &, but how do I use it? & command or &command ends up with a syntax error...
