2010-11-11T04:11:00.000Z	Zaneo		So I have a dilema, I need to install xubuntu on a computer with no OS, I have a ubuntu live cd, my question is there anyway to install xubuntu from the linux live ubuntu?
2010-11-11T04:11:00.000Z	LoganJRuff	Zaneo	install ubuntu then apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
2010-11-11T04:12:00.000Z	LoganJRuff	Zaneo	it is a little messy, yes. You will need to remove any GNOME apps you are not using.
2010-11-11T04:13:00.000Z	LoganJRuff	Zaneo	my only other suggestion is to get a Xubuntu disc.
