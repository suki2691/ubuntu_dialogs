2007-06-28T12:04:00.000Z	Cras2		how do i check my mounted filesystems?
2007-06-28T12:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Cras2	you want to fsck them? or check to see which ones are mounted or wha?
2007-06-28T12:16:00.000Z	Flannel	Cras2	hdc is probably your CDrom drive.  Which makes sense for it to be read only
2007-06-28T12:17:00.000Z	Cras2	Flannel	so do i need to do mount /dev/hdc /media/cdrom0
