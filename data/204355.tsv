2005-12-15T13:38:00.000Z	gahal	motw_	i have no idea on that weather module.  when I last used e17 it was barely functional, and the CVSes would eather compile or not from one day to the next.  yet it was awesome looking when it did compile
2005-12-15T13:39:00.000Z	motw_	gahal	oh well....has there been any talk that you know of about a release date?
2005-12-15T13:42:00.000Z	gahal	motw_	none that I have heard of
