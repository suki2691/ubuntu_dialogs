2007-01-22T07:52:00.000Z	psykidellic		hello....i have been trying to get my old 3com vortex card recognised by ubuntu but I have failed in last 2 days....somebody suggested to compile from source but I think thats also not possible as it requires packages from internet which i cant connect as the network card itself is not working....also my USB device is not getting recognised so that only way to transfer data is through burned CD which is simply a pain.....i have aske
2007-01-22T07:52:00.000Z	psykidellic		d in all IRC rooms related to ubuntu but nobody has been able to figure out whats the issue, also the card was working good when my prof. was using it though it had 2.6.11 kernel and now Ubuntu comes with 2.6.17-10 generic kernel.....so is there anything that i can try other then buying a new network card?

2007-01-22T07:55:00.000Z	Judicata	psykidellic	if indeed compiling (the driver?) from source will correct the problem, using a $0.30 CD is far more efficient that buying a new Network card...
