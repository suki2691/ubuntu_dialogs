2008-07-11T08:00:00.000Z	ubunubi	ferric	do you have gnome-desktop installed? //graphical X desktop environment?
2008-07-11T08:04:00.000Z	ferric	ubunubi	yeah, I think gnome or something starts up, but i'm connected to my TV and the rez is too high, so i can't see anything
2008-07-11T08:04:00.000Z	ferric	ubunubi	but I can drop to a shell and edit xorg.conf
