2010-03-01T06:00:00.000Z	progre55		hi people! I've installed eucaliptus.. but with wrong configs.. how do I remove it and re-install so that it asks to configure it again? a simple remove does not remove the configs..
2010-03-01T06:00:00.000Z	progre55		I mean, remove by apt*
2010-03-01T06:01:00.000Z	dexley	progre55	how about going in the synaptic and remove it utterly and download the .deb again?
2010-03-01T06:04:00.000Z	progre55	dexley	it's on a server.. no graphics available..
