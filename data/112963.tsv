Ididn't experienced it but my customrer told me about his problem when on different printers are some dynamicly create data on slightly different places in document.
2008-06-06T14:24:00.000Z	bazhang_	Rajec	that is too vague to give an answer to
2008-06-06T14:26:00.000Z	Rajec	bazhang_	 hmm. I've forget to tell that, customer wants be able to generate some data dynamicly (picture, text etc) and them print them out on document with already printed text on it. Problem is that on different printers is position of generated data slightly different
