2008-04-07T19:10:00.000Z	tarandus		how could I use and install Gnome and KDE4 both in the same system, that is now set up as ubuntu gutsy?
2008-04-07T19:11:00.000Z	tarandus		will I encounter problems if I apt-get kubuntu-desktop in an ubuntu system, or will it work (I want to select between Gnome and KDE4 from gdm login)?
2008-04-07T19:11:00.000Z	jrib	tarandus	it will work fine
2008-04-07T19:11:00.000Z	tarandus	jrib	do I need to enable backports repository to get KDE4?
