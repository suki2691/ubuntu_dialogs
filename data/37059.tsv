2010-02-19T10:12:00.000Z	ankush_	Losha	ive ubuntu 9.04 in one partition , 2nd partition is ext3. I have to reinstall ubuntu .After doing it will the ext3 partirion still l be there? i mean will the data be preserved?
2010-02-19T10:14:00.000Z	Losha	ankush_	if you choose 'manual partition' during install, and specify that the first partition is for /, and that the 2nd partition is *not* to be touched, it should be fine. But for complete safety, you should first make a backup of the ext3 partition if you can...
