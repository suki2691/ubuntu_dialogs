2008-07-11T03:11:00.000Z	ASULutzy	simotempler	I read if I login as root, and I immediately got scared
2008-07-11T03:11:00.000Z	ASULutzy	simotempler	Check /home/$USER/.local/share/Trash if you're using Hardy
2008-07-11T03:12:00.000Z	ASULutzy	simotempler	Alternatively it could be /root/.local/share/Trash, but you wouldn't actually be logging in as root because that'd be a really bad practice, right? ;)
