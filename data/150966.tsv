2007-06-29T14:07:00.000Z	truthfatal		I know. I've got an Nvidia card in my Desktop, but I just got a new laptop, and the one in my price range had an ATI card

2007-06-29T14:09:00.000Z	truthfatal	schwagner	Ive got a Radeon Express 1100. Google gives me a lot of people with problems relating to that card.
