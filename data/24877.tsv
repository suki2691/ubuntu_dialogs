2012-10-28T01:06:00.000Z	guybrush	crimsonmane	 not an alternetive, suggesting i use and earlier version then 12.10, or earlier then 12.04?
2012-10-28T01:07:00.000Z	guybrush	crimsonmane	sorry, only tried the 12.10, and 12.04 so no other alternetive i have tried *
2012-10-28T01:07:00.000Z	crimsonmane	guybrush	don't use 12.10 ever - it's too new. stay with LTS 12.04. and Alternative Installer is a special ISO designed for slower and/or low resource computers, or for situations where you need to set up the video card after installation.
