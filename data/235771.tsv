2011-01-06T10:47:00.000Z	Madpilot	christopher	install from a 3rd-party download, or is Calibre in repos?
2011-01-06T11:07:00.000Z	Madpilot	christopher	the stuff that gets installed when you invoke "sudo apt-get install..." comes from the repos
2011-01-06T11:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	christopher	best thing to do is just poke around, hang out here and ask questions as they occur.
