2008-10-07T02:59:00.000Z	Skalman12		hi! I've had problems booting for a while - it takes much longer than it ought to (more than twice the time it took when I first installed it) - does anyone know what I can do?
2008-10-07T02:59:00.000Z	BCM34	Skalman12	that would happen as you run more programs
2008-10-07T03:00:00.000Z	Skalman12	BCM34	So it's supposed to take much more time to start up, just because I've installed more programs?
2008-10-07T03:04:00.000Z	Skalman12	BCM34	Is the only way to reduce startup time to remove programs? afaik I don't run any programs at start-up...
