2012-03-16T23:25:00.000Z	charred		Hello, would appreciate some assistance, I am running an eee-pc laptop and just updated ubuntu 11.10, and now my mouse does not work (trackpad and clicks)
2012-03-16T23:26:00.000Z	charred		I believe it updated the linux kernel etc, but I don't have a mouse to plug in and browsing for help is a little difficult
2012-03-16T23:28:00.000Z	charred		I don't have a grub menu, it just boots ubuntu
2012-03-16T23:29:00.000Z	goddard	charred	never heard of that
