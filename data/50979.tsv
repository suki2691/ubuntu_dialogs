2009-10-19T19:06:00.000Z	sirGuest		A while ago I changed an option that made windows that the cursor is not over to turn opaque. Where do I find that option to change it back?
2009-10-19T19:08:00.000Z	Arabus	sirGuest	do you use compiz ?
2009-10-19T19:20:00.000Z	Arabus	sirGuest	try opening System > Preferences > Advanced Desktop Effects Settings. there should be a couple of Plugins that allow the opaque effect. For example the ADD Helper from the Accessibility Plugins.
