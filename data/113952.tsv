2008-03-08T08:06:00.000Z	ArrPirate		can someone help me please? I want my ntfs partition to automount upon login. I've been told to alter fstab and I tried to the best of my abilities but I can't get it to work. What should I add to fstab? The disk is at /dev/sda3 and normally mounts to /media/disk
