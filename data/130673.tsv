2008-05-05T16:18:00.000Z	MaicolGorn		i've a problem with streaming. i cant see some which use windows media, so i tried to install realplayer 11 on ubuntu 8.04. The installation works, but i cant find rp11 on applications. itried to reinstall, but it seems it's already installed. also the re-installations worked
2008-05-05T16:18:00.000Z	MaicolGorn		how can i do?
