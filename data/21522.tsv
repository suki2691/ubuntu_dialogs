I wonder wheter it really holds no session data on cd, even when writed on cd-rw (afaik it is possible to add data even to normal cd on multisession cd) and harddrive? all is in RAM (for example files on desktop) and disappears after reboot? in other words - can I be sure that when I lost my livecd or livecdrw nobody can read my private data?

2010-12-24T19:58:00.000Z	tepowan	jiohdi	thanks for the answer, I presume this, but I wanted to make sure :)
