2012-11-21T02:33:00.000Z	maxiaojun	mendoza	i never upgrade, no matter ubuntu, os x or windows
2012-11-21T02:38:00.000Z	mendoza	maxiaojun	so not worth trying to fix the problem, better to start fresh at this point?
2012-11-21T02:38:00.000Z	maxiaojun	mendoza	i advocate start fresh, you can still ask questions if people can guess the reasons
