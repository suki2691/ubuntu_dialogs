2008-01-28T02:21:00.000Z	matt__		can i install wine on an ubuntu 64bit install?
2008-01-28T02:22:00.000Z	matt__		so is there anything that i may not like about 64 bit? i mean...is there any "problems" with a 64 bit install, like software issues, etc?

2008-01-28T02:23:00.000Z	matt__	Databoy2k	i'll give it a try...perhaps.
