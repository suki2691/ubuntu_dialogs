2004-11-26T06:28:00.000Z	shaya		is it possible to upgrade from debian unstable to warty or hoary?
2004-11-26T06:28:00.000Z	bob2	shaya	yes, but it's not supported
2004-11-26T06:29:00.000Z	shaya	bob2	what does "supported" mean? i.e. it's not like canonical is going to walk me through something :)
2004-11-26T06:29:00.000Z	bob2	shaya	well, if it breaks, don't file bugs unless you're sure they're not related
