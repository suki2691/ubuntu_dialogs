2006-06-16T08:29:00.000Z	avis	MilesAttacca	i heard of a non-destructive partition manager but dont quote me on this called gparted.
2006-06-16T08:36:00.000Z	MilesAttacca	avis	GParted does apparently exist. I'm checking a list I found to see if that or QtParted is included.
2006-06-16T08:36:00.000Z	avis	MilesAttacca	people were praising gparted.  i've only used qtparted.  works fine for me.
