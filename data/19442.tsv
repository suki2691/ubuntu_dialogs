2011-02-08T07:25:00.000Z	tripelbb	Starminn	 my home folders overlap when I open up a set of them.  Ubuntu 10.04   **** I tried it after you mentioned it.

2011-02-08T07:26:00.000Z	Starminn	tripelbb	Yeah, they overlap but they get out of eachothers' way. A better example would be for me to say this: "Open up your Home folder. Move it to the left. Open up another Home see where it goes. Move both of them to the right andopen another. See where it goes"
