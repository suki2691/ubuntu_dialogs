2011-03-06T06:49:00.000Z	juelze		Hi there, I'm hoping to get some help regarding a recent issue.  I was running 10.04 desktop on my Asus eeePC.
2011-03-06T06:49:00.000Z	juelze		Wifi worked great out of the box, however, I'm assuming some recent update borked my wifi connection.
2011-03-06T06:51:00.000Z	juelze		It sees the wifi network and connects but it's extremely slow.  I couldn't figure it out, so instead of messing with it I installed 10.10 netbook edition and wifi is working.  My question is this.  How can I lock down the wifi driver so future updates don't mess with it?
