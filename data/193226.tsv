2006-08-19T05:17:00.000Z	lamego	byen	a dirty solution would be to chmod 000 on it :P
2006-08-19T05:17:00.000Z	byen	lamego	i remember chaging some setting on gconf to fix this on Breezy ..i just dont remember where
2006-08-19T05:24:00.000Z	lamego	byen	as far i could see there is an option just to make it invisible
