2006-03-28T06:53:00.000Z	misfit		I am thinking of switching my linux distro to Ubuntu but wanted to check out the community first :D
2006-03-28T06:55:00.000Z	misfit		I have a quick question. When a new version of Ubuntu is released, how easy is it to update?
2006-03-28T06:56:00.000Z	dli	misfit	"apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade", with corrected /etc/apt/sources.list
