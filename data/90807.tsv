2008-05-16T09:21:00.000Z	Fath[0]m		I have a .exe file saved to my desktop but it wont let me run it, it keeps asking me what program to use. What do I do?
2008-05-16T09:22:00.000Z	Fath[0]m		 sudo apt-get install wine
2008-05-16T09:22:00.000Z	Fath[0]m		E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
