2010-02-19T05:20:00.000Z	Ganang		is there any compatibility problem to upgrade from 9.04 to 9.10? i saw in some forums some people concerning about it..is that true?
2010-02-19T05:20:00.000Z	Slart	Ganang	there's a new version of grub in 9.10.. apart from that I think it should be fine.. backups are good though, as always
2010-02-19T05:21:00.000Z	Ganang	Slart	thanks, i am not sure if upgrading will solve my problem, my major concern is to get my second monitor working with the open source video card from ATI , anyway thanks...
2010-02-19T05:22:00.000Z	Slart	Ganang	oh.. don't know how well ati cards work.. don't have one of those myself
