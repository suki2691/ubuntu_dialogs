2006-07-14T12:23:00.000Z	Nitefall		apparently xchat for ubuntu doesn't log, even thoug I have logging enabled?
2006-07-14T12:24:00.000Z	eyequeue	Nitefall	did you create the log dir?
2006-07-14T12:25:00.000Z	eyequeue	Nitefall	here i have .xchat2/xchatlogs/* (server and channel named logs)
2006-07-14T12:27:00.000Z	eyequeue	Nitefall	it may be possible xchat only sources its config files on restart?
