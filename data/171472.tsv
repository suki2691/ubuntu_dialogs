2007-08-08T12:34:00.000Z	sotec_prod		Question off topic: Has anyone replaced a heatsink on their graphics card?
2007-08-08T12:35:00.000Z	sotec_prod		Or more to the point. Has anyone pulled the heatsink off and snapped a couple of the little fuse links on the top of the GPU off?
2007-08-08T12:35:00.000Z	sotec_prod		is it bad? and will the card still work?
2007-08-08T12:36:00.000Z	kjm	sotec_prod	- ummmmm, usually fuses and connections and heatsinks etc. etc. are all there for a reason.  So, I won't say it is "good"
