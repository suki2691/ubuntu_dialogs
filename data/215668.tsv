2008-05-16T03:15:00.000Z	soundray	Fath[0]m	use gnome-system-monitor or top to observe which process hogs memory
2008-05-16T03:16:00.000Z	soundray	Fath[0]m	is it not a gradual process?
2008-05-16T03:19:00.000Z	soundray	Fath[0]m	have gnome-system-monitor running all the time then, until you can find which program is the culprit. Select "Always on top" from the window menu.
