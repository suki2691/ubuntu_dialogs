2007-04-10T09:00:00.000Z	intelikey		anyone know a source of "real" modems ?
2007-04-10T09:00:00.000Z	intelikey		or anyone know a brand of pci modem that are not winmodems ?
2007-04-10T09:01:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	intelikey	ebay's probably your best bet, tbh
2007-04-10T09:02:00.000Z	intelikey	SlimeyPete	yes and worse bet too.   you can buy fifty there that are profoundly reported to be "hardware fax modems"  that seem to always arive as winmodems.....
