2011-02-28T01:05:00.000Z	gGgG		Hello, I closed and opened my laptop and my pointer disappeared, (still working, but no arrow to show me where it is)
2011-02-28T01:06:00.000Z	Darael	gGgG	That sometimes happens to me - have you tried alt-tabbing between windows?  That usually brings it back for me.
2011-02-28T01:06:00.000Z	gGgG	Darael	no, that doesnt help,
2011-02-28T01:07:00.000Z	Darael	gGgG	Oh.  Sorry.  It was worth a try.  I'm out of ideas personally, maybe someone else can help.
