2009-06-26T01:09:00.000Z	matreya6		can anyone help me with installing GRUB in a RAID1, 2 volume configuration? Alternate 64Bits offers only to install grub on the MBR of the second RAID volume, while I want to install it on the MBR of the  first volume.

2009-06-26T01:10:00.000Z	ikonia		!grub > matreya6
