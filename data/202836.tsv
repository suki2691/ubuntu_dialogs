2012-10-03T10:17:00.000Z	timfrost	themindbenders	unless you have re-formatted it with ext2/3/4, then yes it will be fat32/vfat
2012-10-03T10:20:00.000Z	timfrost	themindbenders	no.  Do NOT format it - the default when it is sold to you is vfat, which gives you a chance of recovering the files, if you follow the advice at the first link that the info bot gave you
2012-10-03T10:30:00.000Z	timfrost	themindbenders	I just looked at the page referenced by ubottu, but that is mostly focused on system recovery.  There may be better tools in  Windows for recovery of data on a USB stick that is formatted for fat32/vfat.  I don't have any references for that
