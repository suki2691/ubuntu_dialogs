2009-10-24T11:23:00.000Z	johntramp	Azeotrope	that was always the rule-of-thumb, swap=2*ram
2009-10-24T11:24:00.000Z	Azeotrope	johntramp	isn't that too much? i barely use 2%
2009-10-24T11:25:00.000Z	johntramp	Azeotrope	it sucks when you run out of swap.... unless the hdd space is limited i'd use 8gb
