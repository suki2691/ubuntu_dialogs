2008-11-14T04:04:00.000Z	mikebeecham		I'm a fairly new Linux user, come across from Windows....do I need to defrag my hard drive, from time to time?
2008-11-14T04:05:00.000Z	tripitakit	mikebeecham	no u dont need to do it
2008-11-14T04:06:00.000Z	mikebeecham	tripitakit	why not?  Is it that Linux works differently from windows in that respect?  What happens when I delete files from my hdd?
