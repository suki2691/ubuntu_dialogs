2009-03-10T00:21:00.000Z	Dacvak		Hey
2009-03-10T00:22:00.000Z	Dacvak		I have an Nvidia 8800GTS. I just installed Ubuntu 8.10 and it didn't automatically install any of the video drivers. I'm running in low-graphics mode. How can I configure my graphics card properly?
2009-03-10T00:24:00.000Z	crdlb	Dacvak	did you try system > admin > hardware drivers?
2009-03-10T00:24:00.000Z	Dacvak	crdlb	Trying that now. Give me a moment. :)
