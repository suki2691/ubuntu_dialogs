2009-09-12T21:55:00.000Z	cwillu	korogiannos	not installed by default.  There are guides around, although I haven't had any success with them (relies on a pulseaudio module to load audio plugins, which I haven't been able to make work)
2009-09-12T21:56:00.000Z	cwillu	korogiannos	but it's possible in theory, and people have reported success
2009-09-12T21:57:00.000Z	korogiannos	cwillu	Thanks.  I've not dug deep (if at all) knowing that others have succeeded is motivation enough
