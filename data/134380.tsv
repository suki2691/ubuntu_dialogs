2007-05-25T11:22:00.000Z	SamWise_TheGreat		how big should i make my / and /boot partitions?
2007-05-25T11:22:00.000Z	greyfrog	SamWise_TheGreat	/ should be at least 2GB probably more
2007-05-25T11:23:00.000Z	SamWise_TheGreat	greyfrog	so 3gb should be a good choice?
2007-05-25T11:23:00.000Z	greyfrog	SamWise_TheGreat	as aoirthoir said, really depends what else is in /
