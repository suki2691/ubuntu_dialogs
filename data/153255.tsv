I'm tying to install ubuntu to an external usb hard drive (currently SCSI3, sde [first partition]) and I want the boot loader stored on that drive requiring me to tell my bios to load from that drive. what do I put for "Device for boot loader installation:"  [default is (hd0)]

2008-02-22T19:54:00.000Z	zubuntu	IndyGunFreak	the drive gets 22mb/s and its the only non-dynamic partition I have.  It would also allow me to jump between machines
2008-02-22T19:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	zubuntu	if you say so
