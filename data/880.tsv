2012-10-07T02:06:00.000Z	Plizzo		I have an installation of Ubuntu Server 11.10 with the system on an SSD and all my storage on a RAID5 partition. If I wipe my SSD and perform a clean install of my system, will it in any way affect the status of the RAID, and will I be able to mount it instantly through fstab like I do today?

2012-10-07T02:10:00.000Z	Plizzo	WHOisAmanda	I would not call it spamming, I simply made a single post in two different channels because it has to do with Ubuntu as well as the server edition...
