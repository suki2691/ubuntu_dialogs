2007-02-26T12:13:00.000Z	mxpxpod		I have mysql-server-5.0 installed, but there are no rows in the mysql.time_zone table... can someone else with mysql-server-5.0 installed confirm this?

2007-02-26T12:14:00.000Z	max17	mxpxpod	i've recently installed ubuntu 6.10 server (no need for gui) and want to change my ip configuration from dchp to a static address.  i've changed my /etc/network/interfaces to reflect what i had assumed was the correct settings, but when i boot the server eth0 never comes up, and when i start it manually i have no ip address....
