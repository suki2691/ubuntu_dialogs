2007-01-03T07:18:00.000Z	Phuzion		Is there an easy way to permanently leave a one line terminal or something like it in the top of my gnome?
2007-01-03T07:20:00.000Z	Phuzion		ok
2007-01-03T07:20:00.000Z	mnoir	Phuzion	you might check out yakuake
2007-01-03T07:22:00.000Z	mnoir	Phuzion	sorry yukuake is for kde and might not be worth installing due to the other stuff you would need unless you run other kde stuff
