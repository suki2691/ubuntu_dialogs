2008-07-10T06:21:00.000Z	befr0d		Hi, I'm looking for a simple Video Editor that would allow me to narrate a video
2008-07-10T06:22:00.000Z	sn9_	befr0d	what format?
2008-07-10T06:22:00.000Z	befr0d	sn9_	 its mpg, I've already tried diva but I cant import the video file
2008-07-10T06:23:00.000Z	sn9_	befr0d	you will probably need cinelerra, then
