2012-09-05T17:38:00.000Z	froward		is battery management on linux still retarded? it tells me I have 35% left, i thought I had a full charge. .:(
2012-09-05T17:39:00.000Z	froward		I just ran a script, it didn't seem to do anything. What should I do? is there a task manager I can open to see if the script is stillr unning in the background?
