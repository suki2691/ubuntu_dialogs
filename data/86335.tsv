2008-07-11T07:46:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl		so I ask everyone here again: how in the holy h*!! do I get scrollbars into my user windows in GNOME?  Issue at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=788755
2008-07-11T07:47:00.000Z	td123	jdsbluedevl	if its a bug without a fix, you can't... and don't yell please
2008-07-11T07:48:00.000Z	jdsbluedevl	td123	I was yelling because no one was listening to me, either in here or at Ubuntuforums.org
2008-07-11T07:49:00.000Z	td123	jdsbluedevl	if people knew the answer, I'm sure they would help you, remember, these are volunteers not paid customer service you can yell at
