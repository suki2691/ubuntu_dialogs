2008-03-23T15:59:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Hazem	that would be app specific, if it's possible at all
2008-03-23T16:00:00.000Z	Hazem	Frogzoo	yes .. for example oracle database service
2008-03-23T16:00:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Hazem	with oracle you need to bump up shared memory etc. google for a usable /etc/security/limits.conf
