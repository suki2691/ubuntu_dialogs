2006-07-05T09:27:00.000Z	DerekRusso		I have a question.  I found that I installed a program I want to use, but I'm not sure how to open it.  I can't find it in any dropdown menu, and I don't have an alias for it, I'm not sure what the path to it is
2006-07-05T09:28:00.000Z	jrib	DerekRusso	what program?

2006-07-05T09:33:00.000Z	jrib	DerekRusso	after installing the package, it should be listed in the accessories section of the "add to panel" dialog
