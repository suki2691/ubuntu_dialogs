2007-01-29T08:18:00.000Z	brainly-green		I'm not sure where I should ask this really--I have a macbook running os 10.4.8 and a tower running ubuntu, and a big bulky monitor for the tower.  I usually use only one or the other computer, not both.  Is there a way so I can set up my macbook's screen to work as the tower's monitor?
