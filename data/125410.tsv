2008-03-30T11:59:00.000Z	hellhound		can anyone please help me with the speed of other computer?  It is driving me nuts by taking minutes just to browse through directories or move the mouse.   it does running normally every now and then but it only lasts for a few seconds
2008-03-30T12:00:00.000Z	nikrud	hellhound	is your disk drive running a lot?
2008-03-30T12:03:00.000Z	hellhound	nikrud	how can i tell?  i do not have my hd light working... I have 3 physical SATA hardrives combined with RAID 5 (this is a samba computer used for nothing else but file server)
2008-03-30T12:04:00.000Z	nikrud	hellhound	ah, not sure then. I was thinking you might have gotten into swap a lot
