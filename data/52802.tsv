2011-03-03T23:01:00.000Z	BiPolah		Go for the one with the highest number, that'll have the latest kernel release
2011-03-03T23:03:00.000Z	BiPolah		Nerdy_kid: Could he not just reconfigure GRUB?
2011-03-03T23:03:00.000Z	nerdy_kid	BiPolah	probably, but he'd have to tweak the config files.  Installing burg is like...3 or 4 lines in the terminal and it looks way better
