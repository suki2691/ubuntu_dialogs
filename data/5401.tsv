2012-08-29T21:18:00.000Z	Bahaman		When installing eclipse, would I need to install anything else? I mean, besides the following line: sudo apt-get install eclipse ?
2012-08-29T21:18:00.000Z	bkc_	Bahaman	eclipse-jdt afaik?
2012-08-29T21:19:00.000Z	Bahaman	bkc_	Im having an odd error with some SWT library missing or something, does it sound familiar?
2012-08-29T21:20:00.000Z	bkc_	Bahaman	only used eclipse/java once and never again, so can't really help you :(
