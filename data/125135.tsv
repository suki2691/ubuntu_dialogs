2007-12-17T08:41:00.000Z	scguy318	darklordveynom	what instructions are you follwing? Ubuntu technically doesn't have the concept of a runlevel
2007-12-17T08:42:00.000Z	scguy318	darklordveynom	since runlevels are supplanted by Upstart
2007-12-17T08:42:00.000Z	scguy318	darklordveynom	ah, then do what nickrud said
