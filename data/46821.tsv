2009-10-15T00:39:00.000Z	_MrApple_		I need a small version of linux to run off of a cd or usb drive. I just want to boot from it.
2009-10-15T00:41:00.000Z	mikinanuq	_MrApple_	puppy, slax, dsl  .. you may need to create a cd of those first and once you boot it they will have a util to install to usb drive
2009-10-15T00:43:00.000Z	_MrApple_	mikinanuq	what would be the easiest one to use?
2009-10-15T00:45:00.000Z	mikinanuq	_MrApple_	slax or puppy are about the same, dsl is a little bit less user friendly
