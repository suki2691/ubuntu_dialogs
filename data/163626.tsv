2008-03-11T01:27:00.000Z	Daviey	mooseman089	some time.. use the mythbuntu repo or wait until hardy is stable
2008-03-11T01:29:00.000Z	Daviey	mooseman089	yes
2008-03-11T01:30:00.000Z	Daviey	mooseman089	0.21 is now stable with mythtv, but won't enter gutsy at all - if you want to use it now - use the mythbuntu repo
