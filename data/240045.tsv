2005-05-10T15:31:00.000Z	davmor2		anyone can you change esd to alsa as default please?
2005-05-10T15:32:00.000Z	nickrud	davmor2	you can change gnome to use alsa by system->preferences->Multimedia-systems-selector
2005-05-10T15:33:00.000Z	davmor2	nickrud	when I do that I lose sound on most apps
2005-05-10T15:34:00.000Z	nickrud	davmor2	then you'll need to switch the apps themselves from esd to alsa in their preferneces
