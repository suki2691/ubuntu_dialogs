2009-03-23T01:23:00.000Z	duffy		I love FF, its fast, its addons enhance it like no other, and as such, no other comes close
2009-03-23T01:24:00.000Z	duffy		what about it..  It aint broke so no need to fix it
2009-03-23T01:25:00.000Z	Gnea	duffy	i had to ditch gnome for E17 in order to get FF to gain any semblence of rational running... even still, it needs to be restarded now and then
