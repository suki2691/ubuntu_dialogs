2008-03-03T00:27:00.000Z	abowen		I have a question about upgrading to U7.10 via update manager
2008-03-03T00:28:00.000Z	abowen		if I upgrade via update manager, will I loose my current aps, setting, etc?
2008-03-03T00:28:00.000Z	Starnestommy	abowen	most likely, you'll still have that stuff after you update
2008-03-03T00:29:00.000Z	abowen	Starnestommy	Ok, I lost the use of my eth port, and am afraid I will not be able to config my wireless (as I will not have use of synaptic, etc)
