2008-11-28T04:46:00.000Z	benoka		my wireless USB card works 3rd the speed on ubuntu 8.10 than on win XP, why?
2008-11-28T04:46:00.000Z	SimAtWork	benoka	perhaps you're setting it up for 11mbs instead of 54? (802.11b as opposed to 802.11g) ?
2008-11-28T04:56:00.000Z	benoka	SimAtWork	where can I change that?
2008-11-28T05:01:00.000Z	benoka	SimAtWork	linkspeed is at 108 Mbit
