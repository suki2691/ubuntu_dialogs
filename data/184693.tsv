2006-08-23T14:22:00.000Z	Wibble-		hey... I can't read the launchpad.net article because links doesn't support https.  Can anyone tell me how to fix the xorg-server bug introduced by the recent upgrade?

In the root command prompt that evntually loads type this (make sure you put the underlines in the url's in): "wget  http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/x/xorg-server/xserver-xorg-core_1.0.2-0ubuntu10.4_i386.deb && sudo dpkg -i xserver-xorg-core_1.0.2-0ubuntu10.4_i386.deb"
