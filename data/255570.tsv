2006-08-23T06:25:00.000Z	cello_rasp		Dillo looks like rubbish and doesn't work at all well.
2006-08-23T06:25:00.000Z	mcphail	cello_rasp	that's why you need a heavyweight browser
2006-08-23T06:27:00.000Z	mcphail	cello_rasp	you have asked for something which looks and works better. Dillo looks lousy and works badly because it is a compromise on all fronts
