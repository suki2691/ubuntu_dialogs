2012-03-24T00:14:00.000Z	helmcken		Hello! Am attempting to do dual install of Ubuntu version 10.04-desk-amd64-LTS and Win 7 to my new FragBox home computer. Unit already has Win 7-64bit installed and running smoothly. Have full back-up USB memory stick with all original software and configs. Have successfully downloaded Ubuntu .iso and burned to disc. Have checked download with md5 hash sums. Verified burn afterwards. Have used disc in machine and will read disc correct

However, whether I select "Try first with no changes" or go straight to full install, it always does the "Try first" anyways and builds the Ubuntu desktop. To be clear, I successfully arrive at a proper Ubuntu desktop, but only in the temporary, trial mode. When I select Install, Ubuntu goes sudo and asks for administrator password

Sometimes, an error message from Ubuntu reads: Failed to run /usr/bin/ubiquity 'gtk_ul' as user root.(with more text ending in Contact the system administrator.) Well, that IS me! The only thing possible is to remove disk from machine and reboot. Machine rebuilds smoothly in Win 7 with no ill effects. What to do, please?
