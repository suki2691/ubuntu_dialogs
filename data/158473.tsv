2008-10-31T05:13:00.000Z	david1		how do I setup a static ip address in 8.10? specifically the net mask.
2008-10-31T05:13:00.000Z	Slart	david1	I think you can do it in the network manager.. if that doesn't work there's always /etc/networks/interfaces
2008-10-31T05:31:00.000Z	Slart	david1	/etc/resolv.conf I think
