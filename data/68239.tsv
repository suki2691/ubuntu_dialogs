2009-04-29T19:12:00.000Z	dd		I have a borked Mac-Mini and need some help getting it re-set
2009-04-29T19:14:00.000Z	dd		seriously borked. I have the OS X install stuck in the drive, I have grub seizing control of the startup process, but without any setup data for intrepid 8.10 server... and I'm not sure what's left on the drive after a 'helpful' techy decided to use gparted to delete various partitions...
2009-04-29T19:14:00.000Z	dd		if I could even just eject the CD, I could stick an ubuntu install cd backin
2009-04-29T19:15:00.000Z	jelly12gen	dd	can you boot from usb ?
