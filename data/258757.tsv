2005-06-20T14:52:00.000Z	Hajuu		anyone know of a decent partition manager for linux? I tried using fdisk to remove my ntfs partition and create a new linux one.. but everytime I do, my changes are lost after reset.. but when I quit and write changes.. and reopen fdisk and check before I reboot... Its all like I set it.. just after I restart... wierd.. so anyone know of a better program for it?
