2007-04-14T09:24:00.000Z	xtknight	tupa	well ubuntu feisty is coming out in less than a week
2007-04-14T09:36:00.000Z	xtknight	tupa	ubuntu server
2007-07-18T13:16:00.000Z	xtknight	tupa	probably debian testing.  i think debian unstable roughly == ubuntu feisty.  why not check yourself using http://packages.ubuntu.com and http://packages.debian.org
