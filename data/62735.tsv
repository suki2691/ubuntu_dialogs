2010-08-01T01:34:00.000Z	lathan		can anyone help with my question?
2010-08-01T01:34:00.000Z	lathan		i have an SD card with Ubuntu Netbook Remix 10.4 Live-Persistent on it. So, i boot from the SD card, and click to "test" ubuntu, but I also have a persistence file. Now, i want to install UNR on my hdd. how would i go about transferring my changes from my SD card's persistence file to my hdd install?
2010-08-01T01:35:00.000Z	lathan		basically, i want to take my sd card's live version of UNR and make it a full install on my internal hdd
