2006-06-20T10:58:00.000Z	bsdfox		can anyone give me some tips to open my firewall (via firestarter) so hamachi works? I've tried opening 137/138/139/445 (the samba ports and some ms thing) but it doesn't work, yet hamachi works when I turn the firewall off
2006-06-20T10:59:00.000Z	Sivik	bsdfox	did you try opening the port 22 and 21
2006-06-20T11:03:00.000Z	Sivik	bsdfox	put a password on it so only certain ppl can get in?
2006-06-20T11:03:00.000Z	bsdfox	Sivik	for the firewall...
