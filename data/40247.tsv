2010-09-22T15:02:00.000Z	andreiutz		Hi ! I want to install ubuntu netbook 10.04 on my HP mini 210 but I still want to keep windows 7. The problem is that the ubuntu installer does not recognize my windows 7 installation and profiles. What can I do to be sure that after I install ubuntu I would still be able to boot win7 too ?
