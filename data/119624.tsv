2008-01-27T20:59:00.000Z	DiceyDaysx		Can I use a vmware .vmdk file without converting it for virtualbox? Or do I need to convert it with a .vdi file?
2008-01-27T21:00:00.000Z	bazhang	DiceyDaysx	no
2008-01-27T21:00:00.000Z	bazhang	DiceyDaysx	you need to start from scratch
2008-01-27T21:02:00.000Z	bazhang	DiceyDaysx	not sure there--I stick with vmware
