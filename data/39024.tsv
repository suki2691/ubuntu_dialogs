2010-01-14T09:37:00.000Z	Barridus		can UI buttons (lke OK, etc) be resized?
2010-01-14T09:38:00.000Z	fluggo	Barridus	you can change the font size, which will do that
2010-01-14T09:39:00.000Z	fluggo	Barridus	under System->Preferences->Appearance, Fonts tab, "Application font"
2010-01-14T09:47:00.000Z	Barridus	fluggo	looks like gnome-color-chooser is what i need, it allows you to shrink the buttons further beyond just the font.  thanks for the advice though.
