2009-10-08T07:26:00.000Z	graelin	snarkster	I'd prefer to keep linux linux.. if you need to share data between OSes... make a share partition that is NTFS.
2009-10-08T07:28:00.000Z	graelin	snarkster	Also there is a possibility that NTFS won't play nice (ie. there is some suggestions that it doesn't play nice when writing to NTFS) I'd hate to hose my home dir that contains every config for all the software I run
2009-10-08T07:30:00.000Z	graelin	snarkster	I've never had a problem with it, but like I said, I have a /share partition that is NTFS just in case Murphey makes an appearance.
