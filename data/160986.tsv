2011-03-10T02:19:00.000Z	r000t2	Jordan_U	does that restore the now gone /etc/firmware?
2011-03-10T02:19:00.000Z	r000t2		I'm afraid I won't be able to reboot now
2011-03-10T02:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	r000t2	There is no such file (/etc/firmware) on my machine, nor have I ever heard of such a file before. I doubt there was anything there previously to be overwritten.
