2011-01-31T19:04:00.000Z	DJones	jetboyjetgirl	I've got a Sansa Fuze & haven't had any problems with it on Ubuntu, its worked perfectly, all I do is plug it in & it gets mounted as a usb drive
2011-01-31T19:05:00.000Z	DJones	jetboyjetgirl	On teh Fuze, you may need to go into the settings menu and set the USB Mode to MSC, I can't rememebr whether that was something I needed to do
