2010-09-05T21:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	jperla	 sure you need the older one?  at times I just make a symlink to the new one with the old name.
2010-09-05T21:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	jperla	I looked at your pastebin but not sure what application is having a problem with it? what are you upgrading from and to?
2010-09-05T21:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	jperla	sorry I had missed part of what was already going on.
