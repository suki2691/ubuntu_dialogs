2008-08-09T23:39:00.000Z	AlexMax		My networking seems to go 'kaput' after a couple of hours of use.  I will be working along and BAM, everything stops, I can't access the internet, I can't tunnel through my VPN, I can't ping anything for 'destination host unreachable', etc.  Restarting my comp fixes it and my workmates have no trouble keeping connected to the internet.  Any ideas?
