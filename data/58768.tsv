2009-04-30T05:35:00.000Z	piroko	MagicDuck1	Use "xft-<ttf_font_name>" as the font. ttf fonts won't show up in xfontsel because it only shows X fonts
2009-04-30T05:35:00.000Z	piroko	MagicDuck1	May or may not work... I'm sorry if it doesn't
2009-04-30T05:37:00.000Z	MagicDuck1	piroko	then how come it show deja vu sans?
