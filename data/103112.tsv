2008-10-16T09:12:00.000Z	bluebook		wow .. so the updates broke the #1 thing I need in my computer and now my only option is .. reinstall everything? I mean, what would you do?
2008-10-16T09:13:00.000Z	Blice	bluebook	Personally, I would try to find out specifically which package it is that broke the mouse. Via asking in forums etc., and then I'd uninstall that package and reinstall (Or reinstall a previous version)
