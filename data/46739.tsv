2010-10-05T13:29:00.000Z	rww	momentum	there's a minimal ISO ( see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD ) but I don't know how you'd get it on a USB.
2010-10-05T13:29:00.000Z	momentum	rww	that's good enogh i'll use usb-creator
2010-10-05T13:29:00.000Z	rww	momentum	I'm not sure that USB creator supports it, but it's worth a try I guess
