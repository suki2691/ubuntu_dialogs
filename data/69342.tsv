2009-02-14T23:16:00.000Z	oCean__	Redragon	I don't know if you've already succeeded to install (got disco for a minute) but I find wwmkr-qt in repo
2009-02-14T23:17:00.000Z	oCean__	Redragon	since wwmkr has dependencies on gambas2, The easies way to install would be "sudo apt-get install wwmkr-qt"
2009-02-14T23:31:00.000Z	oCean__	Redragon	wwmkr-qt is in the repos.
2009-02-14T23:32:00.000Z	oCean__	Redragon	so use next command to install, it will also resolve the gambas dependencies: "sudo apt-get install wwmkr-qt"
