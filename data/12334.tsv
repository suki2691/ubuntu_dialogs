2012-04-22T18:06:00.000Z	minimec	zykotick9	comeon... This is 'ubuntu' basics and not release related...
2012-04-22T18:07:00.000Z	zykotick9	minimec	doesn't matter... if you use alpha/beta the proper channel for support is #ubuntu+1 - this channel would be filled with beta support requests if it where allowed
2012-04-22T18:07:00.000Z	minimec	zykotick9	I can accept that point of view ... ;)
