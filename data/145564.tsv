2008-01-25T07:38:00.000Z	mEck0		Hi! I'm in the install process of ubuntu right now (at the partitioner) and wonder if I should create a partition for /boot? and whats the benefit of it if so?
2008-01-25T07:39:00.000Z	melanie	mEck0	i just make a separate partition for /home
2008-01-25T07:39:00.000Z	melanie	mEck0	you can make a separate partition for everything... but it gets confusing.  people do it so they can easily backup their system
2008-01-25T07:40:00.000Z	mEck0	melanie	geokeratz: okay
