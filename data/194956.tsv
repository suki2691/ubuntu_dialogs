2008-02-27T04:32:00.000Z	Scunizi	fgdgdfgdf	did you "alien" it before install?
2008-02-27T04:33:00.000Z	Scunizi	fgdgdfgdf	alien is a program that tries to convert rpm's to .deb.. how did you manage to install an rpm?
2008-02-27T04:34:00.000Z	Scunizi	fgdgdfgdf	then if it was a RPM it didn't install.. apt-get doesn't know what to do with RPM's
