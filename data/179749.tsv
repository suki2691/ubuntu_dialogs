2007-04-24T06:22:00.000Z	jrib	ryeth25	in what context?
2007-04-24T06:24:00.000Z	jrib	ryeth25	it really depends on the context.  '/' seperates directories in paths and '$' in your prompt denotes that you are a user in the default bash setup on ubuntu.  But you may see them elsewhere and they will mean something else...
