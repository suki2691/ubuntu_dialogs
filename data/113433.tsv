2009-09-18T22:11:00.000Z	v0lksman		I'm trying to update my daily of Chromium.  I checked and I have yesterdays snapshot and a new one was published 30 minutes ago.  But when I update and upgrade it shows no new packages...Any ideas?

2009-09-18T22:13:00.000Z	v0lksman	vox	 it's a PPA.  https://launchpad.net/~chromium-daily/+archive/ppa
2009-09-18T22:13:00.000Z	vox	v0lksman	not sure then
