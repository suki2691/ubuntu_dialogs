2010-10-21T15:44:00.000Z	acicula		I have my phone paired and setup with ubuntu, but every time i want to reconnect to access files or use the internet i keep getting prompted for a (new) pin. Is this intentional and/or can i change it so it will not prompt for a new pin everytime?
2010-10-21T15:45:00.000Z	Krishnandu	acicula	thats because the connection the disconnected everytime and it tries to set up a new connection
