2009-03-31T02:32:00.000Z	UX		any ideas at all?
2009-03-31T02:34:00.000Z	Serraphyn	UX	I don't think accessing via bluetooth or any other method to a cellphone is legal and even if it is, the usage is to questionable to be really a 'supported' thing here.
2009-03-31T02:36:00.000Z	UX	Serraphyn	but when i bought my snoopware, it had a legal agreement that i had to agree too other wise, if misused, my warranty is void and iam put to official intorregation. So there must be the same application under linux
2009-03-31T02:37:00.000Z	UX	Serraphyn	on the other side metasploit framework is part of my backtrack cd, and it can be used in the most horrible way, so usage is not the problem in here the problem is availability
