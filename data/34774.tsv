2010-05-28T21:52:00.000Z	jereanon		I have setup a virtualbox VM running windows 7 on my ubuntu machine. I have to use a WINDOWS ONLY (f5) VPN for work. I would like to tunnel traffic through my ubuntu (host) box through the windows 7 (VM) machine. Can anyone point me in the right direction to achieve this?

2010-05-28T21:54:00.000Z	edbian	jereanon	I see.
