2010-11-23T00:39:00.000Z	UbbyUser		hi all! I'm now using Ubuntu Live and I like to know if there's a way to check *now* and in-live my two sata-hdd to find and fix bad sectors? Disk Utility says "disk has a few bad sectors"
2010-11-23T00:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	UbbyUser	badsectors == disk is dying. You may find some joyin fsck but ultimately the device will fail soon
2010-11-23T00:45:00.000Z	UbbyUser	ActionParsnip	ty for answering me! Is there a way to move bad sectors in a given area and mark them unusable as a non-existent, I do not care if it reduces the capacity of the HDD
2010-11-23T00:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	UbbyUser	not sure. Id just makesure backups are recent and get a new drive
