2011-09-29T04:34:00.000Z	Garret_Thorne		Hey folks, would someone be available to answer a question?  I just recently installed 11.04 and it ran fine until I installed the nVidia driver.  I'm running an 8800GTX, but my card is underpowered - I only have one of the two, six-pin connectors attached.  The card runs fine, albiet at a reduced capacity, in Windows, but Ubuntu refuses to start xwindows now.  Is there any way to force xwin

2011-09-29T04:36:00.000Z	mw007	Garret_Thorne	which nvidia driver are you using?
2011-09-29T04:39:00.000Z	mw007	Garret_Thorne	okay, it's not clear which driver you are using exactly. Have you gone through this page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
