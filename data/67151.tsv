2009-02-02T07:06:00.000Z	kurisuto		OK: my file /etc/apt/sources.list currently contains this single line: "deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu gutsy main".  It looks like I need to add a line to that file to be able to install the "perlmagick" and "python-pythonmagick" packages.  Question is, how do I figure out what line(s) I need to add?
