2006-08-17T09:00:00.000Z	Amwyll		If I add a new NIC to Ubuntu box (different make from existing one), will it auto-detect and automatically install proper drivers? Anyone?
2006-08-17T09:00:00.000Z	CheetahMk2	Amwyll	there's a quick way to check
2006-08-17T09:01:00.000Z	CheetahMk2		type in the chipset, and see if ubuntuy supports it. Even if it doesn't there's probably a way to get it working
2006-08-17T09:02:00.000Z	Amwyll	CheetahMk2	: It's a Realtek garbage, so I'm sure it's supported GENERALLY...
