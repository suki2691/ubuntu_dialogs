2009-12-01T02:02:00.000Z	dandalion		I am very new to ubuntu I have made the cd an was installing it to my computer and wanted to partition my disc and got an error and was unable to do it.  My question is if i complete the install will it work?
2009-12-01T02:04:00.000Z	dandalion		I was thinking of using the entire disc and letting my windows go bye bye.. i just wanted to make sure that it works and that i dont have too many bugs to work out. So, why does it ask me if i want to open up in windows or ubuntu when i turn on my computer now
