2008-09-29T04:30:00.000Z	K_Dallas		Hi guys! I have used ubuntu in VM under windows but now it is the first time that I am using VM to use windows under ubuntu. Which one of these options would let me do it easier and would offer the larger support for programs that I would like to install under windows (e.g. britannia, chessmamster, comsol (or femlab)) thanks
2008-09-29T04:31:00.000Z	K_Dallas		the options: vmware workstation, xen (I still dont know how to use it), parallel, virtualbox
