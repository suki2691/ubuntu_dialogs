2011-12-14T08:32:00.000Z	nac4l		where can I find help on setting up a mail server, maybe with pop3 (not sure), and have the ability to send and receive email from my machine, and use ADDRESS as my free dyndns account "mcurran-exploit.dyndns.org"?
2011-12-14T08:32:00.000Z	nac4l		Everything I've found is way to in depth already and I'm a noob at exchange mail shit.
2011-12-14T08:33:00.000Z	nac4l		should I use evolution or a terminal based email server/client.  And is there any simple tutorials on setting one up?  I though there is already several email services installed by default in ubunutu, can I use htose?
