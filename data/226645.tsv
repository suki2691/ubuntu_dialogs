2006-10-14T09:39:00.000Z	anacaona		dabar: i think my ubuntu is broken cuz i'm getting a bunch of unresolved dependency messages even when i excluded the net based repositories and try to dist-upgrade from the cdrom alone.
2006-10-14T09:39:00.000Z	dabaR	anacaona	show me the cd line from /etc/apt/sources.list file, please
2006-10-14T09:41:00.000Z	anacaona	dabaR	rebooting, i'll give you the line in a sec.
2006-10-14T09:42:00.000Z	anacaona	dabaR	typing in cuz the pc i'm trying to upgrade has decided networking is overrated.
