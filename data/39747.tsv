2010-01-02T10:17:00.000Z	IdleOne	AndChat	you really shouldn't need to run any apps with sudo but in the case you do with graphical applications use gksudo as it is safer. exact reasons why I am not sure of but been told many times by more experienced users
2010-01-02T10:19:00.000Z	AndChat	IdleOne	ok thx, for the advice
