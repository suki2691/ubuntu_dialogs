2006-08-30T09:35:00.000Z	verbose	angel12	dhcp sends out a request to 255.255.255.255
2006-08-30T09:37:00.000Z	verbose	angel12	check the cable, try setting the ip manually and see if you can communicate, make sure the driver is loaded properly for the card, if it's a kernel module or something
2006-08-30T09:38:00.000Z	angel12	verbose	its a wireless, and atme;
