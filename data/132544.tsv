2007-05-30T12:10:00.000Z	Pantern		I am having a hard time with the package management in Ubuntu Breezer. It's been a while since I've used this distro.. when trying to apt get something I get the following warning: Could not find info about http://archive.ubuntu.com breezy-updates/main Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_breezy-updates_main_binary-i386_Packages) - the list of source packakges - stat (2 No such file or directory). What todo?
