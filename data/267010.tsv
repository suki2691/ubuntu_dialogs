2010-08-10T06:28:00.000Z	Connor1		I just installed Ubuntu 10 on my laptop because it detects my wireless card by default. I have an internet connection, but no websites are loading. Any ideas?
2010-08-10T06:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Connor1	 also try some ping tests.. ping google.com, ping 8.8.8.8   and other site/ip#'s - see if any work
2010-08-21T06:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Connor1	 and is the firmware directory in your current working directory?
