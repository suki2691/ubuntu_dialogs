2006-07-26T12:47:00.000Z	DeadlyTiga		for example i take amarok and use xine with alsa and surround 5.1 but i only have stereo 2.0 :)
2006-07-26T12:47:00.000Z	DeadlyTiga		so i think there must be something missing that tells the software to use the 5.1
2006-07-26T12:47:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	DeadlyTiga	maybe the software doesn't support it?
