2010-06-05T22:35:00.000Z	peter_curry		Does anyone have any insight into why Ubuntu is not recognizing my DVD-R?
2010-06-05T22:36:00.000Z	goddard	peter_curry	did you reboot?
2010-06-05T22:36:00.000Z	peter_curry	goddard	that would help?  I'm in the middle of downloading the ISO for Ubuntu 10.04, though ...
2010-06-05T22:41:00.000Z	peter_curry	goddard	can you explain to me how rebooting helps? what's the issue?  Usually it will just recognize the CD without a problem.  Or am I still thinking like a Windows user?
