2008-03-11T23:43:00.000Z	geirha	genii	well, 1024x768 should work on any monitor bought in this millenium I should think
2008-03-11T23:47:00.000Z	genii	geirha	According to http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/monitors/m990/En/spec/spec.htm   this monitor will do 1024x768 at 75 or 85 refresh but no other refresh rates listed for this resolution
2008-03-11T23:49:00.000Z	geirha	genii	that seems to be the correct specs indeed, and the horizsync and vertrefresh values are correct, so that configuration should work ...
