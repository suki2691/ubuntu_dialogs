2008-11-02T00:30:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		why do I have no acceleration settings for the mouse under the configuration editor? I searched for "mouse" and found nothing with this. I want to turn off acceleration and turn up speed.
2008-11-02T00:31:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		this one webpage says that it's in the configuration editor, but I can't find it. why is this such an advanced feature?
2008-11-02T00:33:00.000Z	Chaotic_Descent		I am so frustrated. nothing is ever simple in Ubuntu.
