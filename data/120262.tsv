2008-05-02T08:54:00.000Z	DSMatthews_		Looking for up-to-date docs for connecting to WiFi with hidden SSID and WPA-PSK security, using usb wifi key which works fine if all security turned off on wifi router, Window$ boxes connecting OK, but not Ubuntu 8.04 :-(
2008-05-02T08:55:00.000Z	DSMatthews_		It is a shame that WiFi with security is so flaky :-(
2008-05-02T08:56:00.000Z	DSMatthews_		Indy...: hidden SSID?
2008-05-02T08:56:00.000Z	bazhang	DSMatthews_	likely usb dongle and wifi is flaky wpa2 works fine here
