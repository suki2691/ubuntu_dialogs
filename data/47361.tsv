2012-04-23T21:55:00.000Z	theadmin	sharp15	Just so you know, the naming convention is YY.MM, so it can't be months, since it's already month 4.
2012-04-23T21:56:00.000Z	sharp15	theadmin	oh.  i didn't expect they had any relation to the outside world.  thought they were just version numbers.  good to know.
2012-04-23T21:57:00.000Z	theadmin	sharp15	The release is every 6 months, which is why it always ends in .04 or .10
