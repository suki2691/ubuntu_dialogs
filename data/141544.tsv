2007-04-01T06:55:00.000Z	mikebeecham		HI there...can anyone give me some ideas as to the best media player for Ubuntu?  I'm using Amarok, but dont think I'm getting the best I could.  I'm looking for something with Media Library, Full Screen Visualizations and radio streaming

2007-04-01T06:56:00.000Z	mikebeecham	mon^rch	Oh well...one of the things I dont like about it is that the visualizations are not FulL Screen...I use them a lot when I'm working
