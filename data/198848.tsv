2008-02-09T18:14:00.000Z	|katana|		cuz in a manual they say only 1 primary partition can be active on the same time..
2008-02-09T18:14:00.000Z	|katana|		but you only can have 4 primary partitions, right?
2008-02-09T18:15:00.000Z	Frogzoo	|katana|	best is usually 3 primary partitions (the max) and one extended containing several logical partition
