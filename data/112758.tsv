2008-02-10T18:19:00.000Z	SchwarzeKrause		I wanted to switch to Ubuntu, but for that I need some packages. Namely, kernel 2.6.23 and alsa 1.0.15 Is there a way to get not the current kernel 2.6.24, but the 2.6.23.14?
2008-02-10T18:21:00.000Z	void^	SchwarzeKrause	the current ubuntu release uses kernel 2.6.22 and alsa 1.0.14
2008-02-10T18:23:00.000Z	SchwarzeKrause	void^	I meant I wanted to install the 7.10, but use some packages from 8.04
2008-02-10T18:24:00.000Z	void^	SchwarzeKrause	2.6.23 is neither in 7.10 nor in 8.04
