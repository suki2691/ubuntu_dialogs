2009-09-27T20:02:00.000Z	Jaycob		when i have copied files from the filesystem that windows used via the ubuntu live cd to a memory stick, can these files be used in another windows computer
2009-09-27T20:02:00.000Z	Jaycob		i.e. does ubuntu copy them somehow strangely changing their structure
2009-09-27T20:03:00.000Z	Jaycob		anyone?
