2012-08-10T02:34:00.000Z	CoolerKing		hello.. my having a problem with my Intel Centrino Wireless-N 100 with iwlwifi kernel driver.. It shows networks but I'm unable to connect.. I read many threads that reported the same issue, and they suggested 'options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1' etc, but doesn't seem to work here.. anyone feel like helping out?
