2006-03-27T09:36:00.000Z	Seveas	koobi	which mirror?
2006-03-27T09:36:00.000Z	koobi		actually i tried all mirrors you had posted on your page that had the complete repos, a few weeks ago and none of them seemed to work. are they all functioning now?
2006-03-27T09:37:00.000Z	Seveas	koobi	they/ve been functioning all the time, I think you need to read the big bold notices on the wikipage again
