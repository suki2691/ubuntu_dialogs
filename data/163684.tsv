2007-01-18T15:23:00.000Z	infinitee		hi, is anybody experiencing frequent crashing of FF 2.0 and opera 9.01 under edgy eft? I thought flash was breaking things up but even the latest "stable" release from Adobe does the same.. cant attribute the prob to anything specific.. any inputs pls?

2007-01-18T15:24:00.000Z	infinitee	jrib	concept10: true stable doesnt imply perfect compatibility with FF and Opera.. but evenif I dont play flash video perse, sometimes flash ads also breaks things..
