2008-02-05T04:11:00.000Z	Thinkingman		Quick question folks: easiest way to copy a directory ignoring all files/folders named .svn ?
2008-02-05T04:11:00.000Z	Thinkingman		can't seem to find any obvious switch
2008-02-05T04:13:00.000Z	travisat	Thinkingman	I can't think of a single way, but I would make a tmp directory and mv the svn files there then movet hem back
2008-02-05T04:13:00.000Z	travisat	Thinkingman	I am sure there is a way involving grep and pipes but I can't think of it off the top of my head
