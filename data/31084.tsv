2010-05-29T01:25:00.000Z	tomubuntu	benkay86	you seem to know these issues well.. I have a question for you..
2010-05-29T01:27:00.000Z	tomubuntu	benkay86	.... I login remotely to ubuntu from windows.. and start byobu on putty screen. when I also start byobu on ubuntu my putty connection is completely closed.. any idea why ?
2010-05-29T01:29:00.000Z	benkay86	tomubuntu	Are you starting byobu from inside byobu? I imagine that's not a good idea.
