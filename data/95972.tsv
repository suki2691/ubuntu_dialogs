2008-07-07T14:51:00.000Z	negge^	b4l7424r	it boots from the first harddisk
2008-07-07T14:52:00.000Z	negge^	b4l7424r	for example if you have Windows installed and boot from the Live CD and decide not to use it you select boot from first harddisk and Windows will boot
2008-07-07T14:53:00.000Z	negge^	b4l7424r	you'll have to reinstall it then
