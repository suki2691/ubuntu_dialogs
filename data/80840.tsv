2008-10-08T04:09:00.000Z	matt__		I have an Ubuntu server running ssh-server. Right now I use a random port for it, but at school the port I am using is blocked, so I can't ssh into the server from school. I know that 20,21,possibly 22 are open. I have been told to never use the "default ports" for security reasons, but if my password it strong, I'll be ok won't i?

2008-10-08T04:10:00.000Z	matt__	jasuus	On Russia's list? Oh noes!
2008-10-08T04:11:00.000Z	matt__	jasuus	What about "default" acconts? I log on as matt, so what other things should I perhaps secure?
