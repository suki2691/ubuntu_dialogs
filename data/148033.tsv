2007-12-07T06:36:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		I'm trying to check a log for which users logged in and did what... which log should I look for ?
2007-12-07T06:38:00.000Z	kelsin	CaptainMorgan	the last command will help "last"
2007-12-08T10:21:00.000Z	kelsin	CaptainMorgan	you can try "sudo kill -9 <pid>"
2007-12-08T10:22:00.000Z	kelsin	CaptainMorgan	-9 is the kill signal, not the ask the proces to stop politely signal :)
