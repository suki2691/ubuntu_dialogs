2007-09-10T15:37:00.000Z	penguincentral	MatBoy	Ubuntu isn't really cluttered with a whole load of crap, but i haven't tried debian so it's just a guess
2007-09-10T15:38:00.000Z	MatBoy	penguincentral	yeah, strange, I used it for servers, my workstation was always half OK in performance and so on... but Debian really seems to mess up stuff while upgrading... nice for servers, but not for a WS anymore... Ubuntu is more integrated with applications
2007-09-10T15:39:00.000Z	MatBoy	penguincentral	I think that too, never used it, but I think because Ubuntu has more clear departments that are on the same way with the same base... it's very OK
