2006-11-01T12:29:00.000Z	unfo	tzadikim	go with edgy. and no, you are not stupid. IMO anyone who manages to install and use Ubuntu and get on IRC is above-average intelligence :)
2006-11-01T12:30:00.000Z	unfo	tzadikim	get edgy.
2006-11-01T12:46:00.000Z	unfo	tzadikim	I recommend the 32 bit. it's better tested.
