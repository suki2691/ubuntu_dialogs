2012-03-23T22:13:00.000Z	Strav	rhizmoe	You know if there are know issues with using a static kernel underneath a standard ubuntu install (10.04 in this very case)?
2012-03-23T22:28:00.000Z	rhizmoe	Strav	the best way is to try on an unused box. i'm sure there are some default bits in 10.10 that might depend on modules, but i don't know for sure or which ones.
