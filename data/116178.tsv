2010-05-13T04:21:00.000Z	timposey		Gimp is installed on my system but not showing up in the menu...what do I need to do to get it to show up.
2010-05-13T04:22:00.000Z	zcat[1]	timposey	 reinstall it. It _should_ be there? or right click, edit menus and see if it's unchecked?
2010-05-13T04:22:00.000Z	zcat[1]	timposey	 also possibly log out and back in?
2010-05-13T04:23:00.000Z	timposey	zcat[1]	thanks, it was checked but I unchecked it and checked it again and it shows up now,  Thanks so much for being here and for the help!
