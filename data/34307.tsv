2010-05-30T14:41:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy		Can someone explain to me why I can't send files on an NTFS filesystem to the trash, even though I can create and delete files?
2010-05-30T14:41:00.000Z	CaptainTrek	TheMusicGuy	because NTFS doesnt like the linux trash system AFAIK
2010-05-30T14:41:00.000Z	CaptainTrek		xD
2010-05-30T14:42:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	CaptainTrek	I thought the "linux trash system" was just a directory at the root of the filesystem named ".Trash-0"
