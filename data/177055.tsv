If you use an extended partition, I believe you have a hdb1, hdb2 = extended, and the rest follow,s why this is recognized as hdb5, I'm not sure, but it's been that way since  I can remember. I've done no file system changes on it in months. i've placed /dev/hdb5 /media/hdb ext3 defaults 0 0 in fstab and ran "sudo mount -a"
