2011-08-17T21:10:00.000Z	sosaited		Can someone help me with setting up SSH with key authentication? I am confused between where to run ssh-keygen and ssh-copy-id.
2011-08-17T21:11:00.000Z	sosaited		I ran ssh-keygen on my client computer, as stated by the guide on community pages (The computer I will be connected FROM, TO my server/main pc)
2011-08-17T21:11:00.000Z	rhizmoe	sosaited	i've never used ssh-copy-id for that stuff
2011-08-17T21:11:00.000Z	sosaited	rhizmoe	I should have run ssh-keygen -t rsa -b4096 " etc on which computer?
