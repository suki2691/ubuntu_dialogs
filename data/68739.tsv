2010-02-21T11:59:00.000Z	dsnyders		When I was using another distro, there was a website that had "fixes" for all the common issues like codecs, etc.  Is there a "finishing" website for ubuntu for adding repositories and such?

2010-02-21T12:05:00.000Z	dsnyders	kinja-sheep	I'm looking a site that has stuff like that.
