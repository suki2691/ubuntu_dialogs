2010-09-15T04:47:00.000Z	jlebar		I'm trying to install Jaunty into a VM (so I can test gcc 4.3.3), and it's hanging at "configuring shared-mime-info".  What's going on?
2010-09-15T04:47:00.000Z	xangua	jlebar	are you concious that jaunty will stop being supported shortlyÂ¿
2010-09-15T04:48:00.000Z	jlebar	xangua	I'm just trying to see if an issue I'm observing is caused by a bug that was fixed between gcc 4.3.4 and gcc 4.3.3.
2010-09-15T04:49:00.000Z	jlebar	xangua	if there's a way to install gcc 4.3.3 on Lucid, I'd be all ears.  (the gcc-4.3 package installs gcc 4.3.4.)
