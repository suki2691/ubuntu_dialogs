2011-06-29T06:23:00.000Z	weefee		I have ubuntu desktop installed on a small hard drive, there is also a 5 disk softraid array, if I replace the small drive (not part of the array) and put a fresh copy of ubuntu on it, will it detect the raid?
2011-06-29T06:24:00.000Z	weefee		if ont, is there any way I can back up some settings to restore it just in case
2011-06-29T06:24:00.000Z	weefee		if not*
2011-06-29T06:24:00.000Z	robin0800	weefee	think you need the alternate cd for raid
