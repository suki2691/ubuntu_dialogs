2009-07-22T01:42:00.000Z	nannes_		Hi all!! :D  I use Ubuntu Server edition; I've added a new Network-Card (100Mbps) on PCI Port.... SO: I tried to run # ifconfig eth1.. on the output I read: HWaddr FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
2009-07-22T01:42:00.000Z	nannes_		Does it mean that the card isn't been identified by PC??
2009-07-22T01:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	nannes_	does it appear on lspci ?
