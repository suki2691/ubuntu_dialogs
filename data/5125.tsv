2012-02-26T19:58:00.000Z	bawlawl	Dr_willis	as of now I have used live-usb, but thinking about using a full install for persistence purposes
2012-02-26T20:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bawlawl	 using a full install and changfeing pc's/video hardware can be problmatic. I move a usb from an nvidia to an ati box. often. basically i just use the GPL ati drivers because  and keep the nvidia one installed. I sometimes need to move/rename the nvidia or ati sprcific xorg.conf for them to work totally correct
2012-02-26T20:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bawlawl	 using a live-usb+persistant file can be even more hassles.
