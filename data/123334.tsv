2010-01-01T14:49:00.000Z	Steil		do you guys really trust ubuntu forums?
2010-01-01T14:51:00.000Z	blackest_knight	Steil	 why wouldn't you trust ubuntu forums if any one stuffs up intentionally or not someone else would reply and correct the misinformation
2010-01-01T14:59:00.000Z	blackest_knight	Steil	some times your sat nav will tell you to do stupid things but its up to you to do them or not. forum is usually fairly solid for procedures easier than trying to use irc to explain something slightly complicated
