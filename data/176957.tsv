2010-04-20T01:23:00.000Z	BusMaster	realcoolguy	it won't leak under windows..but I tried to run windows 7 in a VM with 1gig ram (my laptop has 2 gigs ram) and both my laptop and win7 vm became dead slow. so I am thinking maye ubuntu minimal will work with 512 megs ram
2010-04-20T01:24:00.000Z	realcoolguy	BusMaster	I was thinking more of a stripped down XP.  :)
2010-04-20T01:25:00.000Z	BusMaster	realcoolguy	maybe it'll work. but my experience is that windows generally doesn't work and if i have to fiddle anyway, I might as well fiddle with linux, because linux works :)
