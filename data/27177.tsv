2010-08-23T21:45:00.000Z	philipp__		Hello there. I am trying to connect my laptop which runs Ubuntu 10.04 to my TFT. Unfortunately, the monitor dialogue only offers 60Hz for the native resolution.
2010-08-23T21:46:00.000Z	philipp__		I could get at least 75Hz if I'd choose a lower resolution - those are all 4:3 and not 16:10, though.
2010-08-23T21:46:00.000Z	philipp__		So how can I configure Ubuntu so that the TFT won't stretch the image but use some kind of "letterbox" mode?
