2008-07-03T22:22:00.000Z	niadh		I have an odd bug, something I placed in my trash will not delete, I even ran sudo rm -rf /.Trash to ensure the file would be gone, and while it does not appear in the trash on the command line, it appears in nautilus, what could remedy this?
2008-07-03T22:22:00.000Z	niadh		Oh, random
2008-07-03T22:24:00.000Z	niadh		Why has trash been moved to there, just out of curisoity?
