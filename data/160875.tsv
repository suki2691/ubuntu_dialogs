2008-12-19T12:34:00.000Z	Entelin		ok one other irritation I would like to be rid of,  what is the fastest way to switch between windowmanagers?  usually I will use windowmaker, however occasionally ill switch to the default gnome one.  Normally i have done this by adding a  .xsession file, however having to rename it to switch back and fourth is kinda annoying.  any better way?
