2008-02-19T04:23:00.000Z	Exershio		I'm not looking for Envy support. >_> I'm looking for general support with my Radeon 9550
2008-02-19T04:23:00.000Z	Exershio		All I was saying is that Envy did work with 8.40. That's it
2008-02-19T04:23:00.000Z	danbhfive	Exershio	have you tried the restricted driver manager?  I can't help you though, if that doesn't work, sorry
2008-02-19T04:24:00.000Z	Exershio	danbhfive	I did, but I couldn't get 3d rendering to work that way.
