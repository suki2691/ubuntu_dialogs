2009-10-03T01:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chuy_max	with Windows as host hmm not that great, not that great at all,  could be useful for getting a feel for Ubuntu though
2009-10-03T01:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	chuy_max	Virtualbox, VMware, player, VMware server,  or  Microsoft Virtualpc which probably isn't that Linux friendly
2009-10-03T01:45:00.000Z	chuy_max	sebsebseb	why is it not that great at all?, I have used linux for years, but I have to install Ubuntu Feisty because an old program I developed does not work perfectly in Ubuntu Jaunty. I don't want to create a partition only for Feisty and I tried to install Ubuntu Feisty with persistent changes  but failed miserably.
