2007-11-30T20:27:00.000Z	dgjones	codesnik	is your /home a seperate partition?
2007-11-30T20:28:00.000Z	dgjones	codesnik	how big is your /home?
2007-11-30T20:30:00.000Z	dgjones	codesnik	right, ouch, i keep things like that in a seperate /media partition to avoid problems like that, maybe something to remember for a reinstall, create a seperate /home and a seperate media or data partition to keep them seperate
