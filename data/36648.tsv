2010-02-26T10:54:00.000Z	phaidonx1		Hi. I am trying to set an environment variable. it works if I use export , but I want to put this in a script to set a couple of them. I don't want it to be in .bashrc since I only want to set the variables in some cases (basically they are already set in .bashrc  but I want to change their default value occasionally). I tried putting this in a script, but after the script finishes the environment variables seem not to stick....

2010-02-26T11:00:00.000Z	Losha	phaidonx1	you have to put the export command in a file and 'source' it (see man bash) to affect the current shell
