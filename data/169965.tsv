2008-04-06T12:19:00.000Z	macogw	luke	not likely. we have wine for windows apps. there's no compat layer for osx though.
2008-04-06T12:19:00.000Z	macogw	luke	what app is it? i might no an alternative
2008-04-06T12:21:00.000Z	macogw	luke	oh. no idea there.  um .zip is just an archive.  whatever the program is is *inside* the zip, probably with a README
