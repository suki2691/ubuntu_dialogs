2006-11-07T13:45:00.000Z	rccollins		Hello, I am new to IRC and Ubuntu honestly.  I have some questions about using XDMPC
2006-11-07T13:46:00.000Z	rccollins		how can i increase performance on my LAN? Does the client PC speed play a roll?
2006-11-07T13:48:00.000Z	Jowi	rccollins	depends on what you are doing exactly. copying files alot? then client and server CPU speed, harddisk speed, network connection and how you connect it all (switch, router etc) got its role
2006-11-07T13:48:00.000Z	Jowi	rccollins	your question is a bit too general.
