2005-04-09T10:31:00.000Z	kevman		Hi, I got my TV card to work in Ubuntu, but i have to give a bunch of rmmod/modprobe commands each time I boot to get it to work.
2005-04-09T10:32:00.000Z	airox	kevman	Check out /etc/modules
2005-04-09T10:32:00.000Z	kevman		Can I make it so that I don't have to it everytime I boot?
2005-04-09T10:32:00.000Z	kevman	airox	can I use it to keep it from loading a module?
