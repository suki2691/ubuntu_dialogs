2010-11-27T01:03:00.000Z	Alan502	SeanInSeattle	that sounds challenging, but doesn't gmail have SMTP support?
2010-11-27T01:04:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	Alan502	 Yes, it does.  I don't have any desire to use the Evolution mail client instead of the primary/main gmail interface.  I prefer their web UI to the Evolution client.
