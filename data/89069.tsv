2008-09-21T11:06:00.000Z	nxmehta		random question about partitions (for a default ubuntu install) - why is it that the swap partition is sitting inside of an extended partition?  can you make the swap partition one of the 4 primary partitions?  or does it have to be extended...

2008-09-21T11:08:00.000Z	nxmehta	jetscreamer	is there some reason that ubuntu sets it up to not be primary?  what's the motivation
2008-09-21T11:27:00.000Z	jetscreamer	nxmehta	i think that's just how the autopartioner is set up... me i always use manual. (not real familiar with it)
