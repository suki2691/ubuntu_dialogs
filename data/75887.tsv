2010-02-19T01:35:00.000Z	Smashcat		Hello, I've got a server running Ubuntu 7.10, and want to NFS mount from it to my new server running 9.10. The old server is exporting ok, but the new server cannot mount (gets "Access Denied" error, even though the old server says it has authenticated it). Is NFS impossible between 7.10 and 9.10? Should I just use Samba?
2010-02-19T01:37:00.000Z	Smashcat		So noone has any ideas about NFS? Guess it's not used much now ;-)
