2009-04-10T18:21:00.000Z	pmitros		How stable would the transition from Intrepid to Jaunty be if I did it todat instead of in a couple of weeks? Intrepid has a broken pyqt4/phonon, which Jaunty fixes. The backport process is fairly painful, but I need it this week. I'm wondering if I'm not just better off upgrading early.
