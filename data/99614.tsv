2009-10-03T12:12:00.000Z	brambo_	godstar	I booted off the Ubuntu disc from my BIOS
2009-10-03T12:28:00.000Z	brambo_	godstar	all I did was select time zone and keyoard type etc, and it said starting partition manager, then I slide a bar to the left to select 50GB for Ubuntu instead of deleting Windows, and hit next..
