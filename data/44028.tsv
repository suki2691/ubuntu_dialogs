2011-04-29T12:08:00.000Z	paul		I've made a huge big mess of all my public/private keys, if I want to start all over, is it safe to just deleve ~/.ssh ?
2011-04-29T12:08:00.000Z	Blue1	paul	why not just rename the directory first, then start over.
2011-04-29T12:09:00.000Z	paul	Blue1	clever, thank you
