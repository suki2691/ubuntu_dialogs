2005-09-10T14:19:00.000Z	Gobbla_	reiki	what's the difference with pay and free version?
2005-09-10T14:21:00.000Z	reiki	Gobbla_	I honestly didn't see a difference. I paid after using for a week because... well... because I was using them and so far it's the only thing about my Ubuntu system I've had to pay for... unlike my old Windows system where I had to pay every time I farted
