2011-03-07T22:48:00.000Z	Jesdisciple		hi, I'm trying to debug a Web page that uses Flash, but apparently Firebug doesn't watch Flash's network activity. (I don't have access to the ActionScript, but I know it works.)
2011-03-07T22:48:00.000Z	Jesdisciple		is there any tool that can watch all (HTTP) network activity and show me the messages for all traffic?
