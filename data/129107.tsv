2010-12-24T00:24:00.000Z	zms	Dr_Willis_	KM0201, rigved, ubottu: First off my apologies for incomplete information: I am on Sid. And was following a howto to switch from 32 to 64 bit in place (I did not know about PAE at the time.)  I don't think I had switched packages to 64 bit yet when I learnt about PAE.  I installed the debian bigmem (PAE enabled) kernel but now I have the errors I mentioned.  I just need a pointer or a suggestion about where to begin looking...
2010-12-24T00:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	zms	 debian has its own support channels.. i dont think you can upgrade debian from 32bit to 64bit either.. I think a reinstall may be needed for you to fix things now.
2010-12-24T00:26:00.000Z	zms	Dr_Willis_	I understand.  I just borrowed my wife's Ubuntu laptop, installed xchat and it directly dropped me here.  I thought it wouldn't hurt to ask here as well being similar and all.
