2007-07-29T16:28:00.000Z	Naitsirk		Hallois. I want to install ubuntu with Raid 1 on two 500 GB disks, but found out my MB isn't real hardware raid, but some sort of fakeraid. What is best to use then of fakeraid and softraid?
2007-07-29T16:28:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Naitsirk	get a real raid :)
2007-07-29T16:29:00.000Z	Naitsirk	fyrestrtr	so I should just forget about both those alternatives and buy a controller card that will support hardware raid?
2007-07-29T16:30:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Naitsirk	I didn't say that .... but, yes, that would make life easy for you.
