2009-03-10T22:42:00.000Z	Igramul		Is there a safe way to resize a partition while running Ubuntu (I'd like to extend /boot while shrinking either / or the swap partition)?
2009-03-10T22:42:00.000Z	Incarus	Igramul	yes, live cd and then gparted or qtparted
2009-03-10T22:44:00.000Z	Igramul	Incarus	thanks. I guess it cannot be done while the partition is mounted, right?
2009-03-10T22:44:00.000Z	Incarus	Igramul	yes
