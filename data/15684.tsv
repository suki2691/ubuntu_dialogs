2011-11-22T08:47:00.000Z	DeviceZer0	reisio	ah. Well..i may just reinstall tomorrow with ext4 then. I thought I'd give brtfs a shot since it seems to be all the rage now..but this is getting annoying. Install a few dependencies for compiling xbmc has taken around 30-35 mins so far...like 15 seconds to dl the debs and now its SLOWLY installing them all.
