2010-06-14T04:37:00.000Z	uski		hi; does anyone know why the 64-bit 10.04 is "not recommended for daily desktop usage" ? (http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download)
2010-06-14T04:38:00.000Z	ubutom	uski	because the average joe doesn't know about 32 and 64 bit and will get angry if installing 64 bit and it doesn'T work, 32 bit works on 64 bit systems, but the other way around not.
2010-06-14T04:39:00.000Z	uski	ubutom	well they could write "Make sure you have a 64-bit system"; the way it's written makes people feel like 64-bits is less stable and I'm not sure it's the case
2010-06-14T04:40:00.000Z	ubutom	uski	yeah, but they seem to aim at newcomers with that
