2006-07-12T08:24:00.000Z	CurtisB	sri_	have you installed apache? have you enabled it as a service?
2006-07-12T08:25:00.000Z	CurtisB	sri_	sudo apt-get install apache
2006-07-12T08:26:00.000Z	CurtisB	sri_	no you don't need to know python... you'll need to learn how to config apache, and you may want to learn some php/mysql
