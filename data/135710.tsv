2009-09-04T02:59:00.000Z	Salvad		Does anyone know why i cannot resume from hibernation moving the mouse, like i did with Windows?
2009-09-04T03:00:00.000Z	Salvad		But, is a BIOS feature.
2009-09-04T03:01:00.000Z	Salvad		I mean, do the computer shutdown really with hibernation?.
2009-09-04T03:03:00.000Z	bastidraZor	Salvad	because in windows you suspended and not hibernated.
