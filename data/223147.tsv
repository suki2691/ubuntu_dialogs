2005-08-30T06:14:00.000Z	phreakys		how can i uninstall a package, installed with make install ?
2005-08-30T06:15:00.000Z	gorilla	phreakys	you can't... the best you can do is to rea the Makefile for where it installed the program and other files.
2005-08-30T06:16:00.000Z	gorilla	phreakys	that's the short answer anyway... :-)
