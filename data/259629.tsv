2004-12-16T15:46:00.000Z	marble2		I just received my CDs, booted to the live CD, and it's sending me into an endless cycle of reboots :(
2004-12-16T15:46:00.000Z	marble2		so it's not a common problem?
2004-12-16T15:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	marble2	what do you mean by "an endless cycle.." ? Is it just rebooting when you try to shutdown, or what?
