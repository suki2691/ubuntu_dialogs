2005-01-15T11:39:00.000Z	bretzel		I have a question: Installed (php) Gallery and then all went ok for configs and runs well. But creating users failed because email couldn't be sent -- so I suspect my configs missing the pop server location - I dunno where to setup this detail
2005-01-15T11:40:00.000Z	kezz	bretzel	ask the developer
2005-01-15T11:40:00.000Z	bretzel		no- not the pop server but the smpt server excuse...
2005-01-15T11:41:00.000Z	bretzel	kezz	you know in second thought, I think I can navigate the php source code and locate the failure...
