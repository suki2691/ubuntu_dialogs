2012-04-03T23:53:00.000Z	allie83		olfway: thanks for your help.  genereal question now: do you find 11.10 to be a bit slow while preforming it's own functions ie: system tool, app, etc.?
2012-04-03T23:53:00.000Z	KM0201	allie83	11.10 is just craptacular due to unity... no unity=no problems
2012-04-03T23:54:00.000Z	allie83	KM0201	is there any way to get a non-unity desktop??
2012-04-03T23:54:00.000Z	KM0201	allie83	kubuntu, xubuntu, lubuntu   several options
