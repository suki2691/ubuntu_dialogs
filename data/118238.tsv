2008-02-21T03:09:00.000Z	brobostigon	danbhfive	ping is always installed
2008-02-21T03:10:00.000Z	danbhfive	brobostigon	is ping installed before a netinstall has started? and I drop to a terminal?  it says ping is a bad command, but I do have route  :p
2008-02-21T03:10:00.000Z	brobostigon	danbhfive	never used netinstall, so no idea
