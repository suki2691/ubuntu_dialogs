2007-09-21T15:18:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive		Fellows; I'm trying to use gparted LiveCD to partition my drive so I can install XP for dual-booting. However, the LiveCD always stops halfway, and I never end up seeing the GUI. I doubt I have a bad burn, so I'm wondering if maybe gparted takes a long time to initialize? Or is there an alternative to using the gparted LiveCD to partition my drive for XP?
