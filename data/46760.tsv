2009-09-28T14:54:00.000Z	momceras2		Hi ! Trying to install C compiler (gcc) without success (no apt-get, make, c compiler avaiable on system). Any help ?
2009-09-28T14:55:00.000Z	momceras2		don't know. I didn't install it. it's from a POS system
2009-09-28T14:56:00.000Z	momceras2		Maybe they remove or really didn't install it
