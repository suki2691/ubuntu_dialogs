2012-10-15T16:40:00.000Z	suigeneris		update-grub2  /usr/sbin/grub-probe: error: cannot find a device for / (is /dev mounted?). <--- why am I getting this? I'm in chroot
2012-10-15T16:40:00.000Z	rumpe1	suigeneris	have you mounted /dev to the chroot?
2012-10-15T16:41:00.000Z	suigeneris	rumpe1	tried that too. I got mount -o bind /dev/  mount: special device udev does not exist
2012-10-15T16:42:00.000Z	rumpe1	suigeneris	from within the chroot or from outside?
