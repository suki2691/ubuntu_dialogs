2008-05-02T08:53:00.000Z	phoenix180		I believe I have messed my pc up completely.  After several hours yesterday I finally managed to install kubuntu onto my pc(ubuntu 7.10 and ubuntu 8.04 refuse to load).  Tonight for no reason at all I decided to try 7.10 again and so as a result, it didn't fully install and my question is this: can I still use my kubuntu setup? or did I just mess things up?
2008-05-02T08:54:00.000Z	phoenix180		should I at least see if it will boot?

2008-05-02T08:55:00.000Z	rich_freecomm	phoenix180	3-4 times even..not 34 times..I would have def givin up by then
