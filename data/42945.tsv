2011-05-19T23:32:00.000Z	Roasted_	rww	ahh, didn't think of that, but it makes sense. Do you know of any web based GUI's that allow set up of software raid? I want to set up a headless server at home and manage it remotely when I move out
2011-05-19T23:33:00.000Z	rww	Roasted_	nope, I haven't dealt with software RAID at all, hence my answer ;)
