2007-10-08T08:04:00.000Z	gsb		Ok, so I am getting and error when trying to install DBD::Mysql.  It is looking for the mysql_config file, I did a search and it seems I need the mysql headers.  Any idea where I can grab those?
2007-10-08T08:04:00.000Z	Seveas	gsb	are you installing from source or a package?
2007-10-08T08:05:00.000Z	Seveas	gsb	try a package instead :)
2007-10-08T08:05:00.000Z	Seveas	gsb	libdbd-mysql-perl iirc
