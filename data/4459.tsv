2012-03-24T03:37:00.000Z	mirko1	yumyum	 your ssh server is most probably behind a router so you have to configure the dynamic IP there (please do not set up a public accessible server on your own if you don't know what you're doing)
2012-03-24T03:44:00.000Z	mirko1	yumyum	what is your exact network structure? do you have a router or just a plain modem? if you have a router, then your router has the public IP and needs to be configured for dynamic IP services.
