2007-12-26T21:29:00.000Z	rkj		Here's a rather general question: I have ubuntu (7.04) using GNOME; and I see there are lots of KDE applications available for installation.  But will KDE applications work on a system running GNOME?

2007-12-26T21:32:00.000Z	GHOST	rkj	u can change this
2007-12-26T21:32:00.000Z	GHOST	rkj	i dont think so
