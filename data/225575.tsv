2005-08-03T06:51:00.000Z	tikka	kozlyk	 Turn it off.. if u can get on the samba server u know its zone alarm........... in that instance check ur ZA settings
2005-08-03T06:51:00.000Z	kozlyk	tikka	 i have figured it is zonealarm now, just wondering if there was a setting specifically for local network access
2005-08-03T06:53:00.000Z	tikka	kozlyk	dare i suggest uninstalling ZA .. so that it prompts you next time you attempt it. google for permitting the lan range of ips.. since i havent a clue where u set that.
