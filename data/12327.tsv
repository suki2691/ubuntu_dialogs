2012-03-22T02:59:00.000Z	CyberKnet		I installed desktop edition and since decided I don't need the gui ... is it sufficient to run sudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop to remove all things related to the gui?
2012-03-22T03:00:00.000Z	CyberKnet		it doesn't seem to pull in any other packages to be removed...
2012-03-22T03:01:00.000Z	zykotick9	CyberKnet	see the !pureFOO factoid for some possible hints - i'll send one
2012-03-22T03:02:00.000Z	CyberKnet	zykotick9	I don't want a gui at all.
