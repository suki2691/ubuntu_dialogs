2008-03-07T03:42:00.000Z	jtld	amaridian	try scanning this list and correcting the mirror based on what you find - https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+cdmirrors
2008-03-07T03:47:00.000Z	jtld	amaridian	why not just install from the cd? 7.10 will have correct mirrors.
2008-03-07T03:51:00.000Z	jtld	amaridian	try adding a mirror from the site I gave you.
