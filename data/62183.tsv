2009-05-20T19:44:00.000Z	jlaroche		Hello everyone. I am runnin Ubuntu 8.04 32bit on my Asus EEE 701 4G Surf and have the Linux 2.6.24-21-eeepc kernel. Does anyone know how to overclock the EEE from 600mhz to 900mhz with this kernel / setup?

2009-05-20T19:45:00.000Z	iceroot	jlaroche	there is a script (google) for the eee pc 701 4g with hardy, which will enable fn + f6 for overclocking
