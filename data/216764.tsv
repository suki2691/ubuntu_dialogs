2007-02-06T07:25:00.000Z	michaeljsmalley		Hi all.  I'm a bit of a noob here, how do I write a shell script....  Actually, more accurately, how do I take a shell script I find online, and create a runnable script on my computer from it.  I already copied it into gedit, and tried to save it to my desktop, but...  No good.  ANY SUGGESTIONS?
