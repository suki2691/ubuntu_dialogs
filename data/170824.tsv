2006-08-15T07:47:00.000Z	jisatsu		I'm using the live CD right now btw
2006-08-15T07:49:00.000Z	jisatsu		anyone? I can't even connect to my gateway, which leads me to believe the network interface isn't functioning
2006-08-15T07:50:00.000Z	yeager	jisatsu	sudo ifconfig -a. which interfaces are listed?
