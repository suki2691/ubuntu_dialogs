2007-10-10T15:34:00.000Z	KoweSix		When I start an external hdd, it is automatically mounted as read-only.. how can i change that? :o
2007-10-10T15:35:00.000Z	MasterShrek	KoweSix	is it ntfs?
2007-10-10T15:36:00.000Z	MasterShrek	KoweSix	cuz linux cant read/write ntfs natively
2007-10-10T15:36:00.000Z	KoweSix	MasterShrek	 so that would also explain the reason why i cant mount the encrypted container files on it?! :]
