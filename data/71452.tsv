2008-12-12T20:24:00.000Z	tmg1|work	jeeez	have you tried logging out / going to console / nuking .compiz or whatever and logging back in?
2008-12-12T20:24:00.000Z	tmg1|work		alternatively, are you able to disable compiz?
2008-12-12T20:25:00.000Z	jeeez	tmg1|work	wat exactly do you mean by nuking .compiz?
