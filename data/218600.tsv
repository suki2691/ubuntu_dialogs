2009-10-13T20:41:00.000Z	Olimpico		Hello, I have a problem with dpkg, I installed a DEB which actually works but every time I make apt-get upgrade i get an error message.
2009-10-13T20:41:00.000Z	Olimpico		How can I disable this, I just don't want to deinstall the DEB
2009-10-13T20:42:00.000Z	Olimpico		And I want no more error messages
2009-10-13T20:43:00.000Z	sipior	Olimpico	you're not going to make us guess the error message, are you?
