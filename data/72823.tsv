2009-02-04T10:26:00.000Z	ramirand		droopsta915: Sometimes you want to "purge" instead of "remove" a package (I've seen some where the config files that get left behind are a problem)
2009-02-04T10:26:00.000Z	phorensic	ramirand	does purge remove all config files? For some reason it doesn't with some packages
2009-02-04T10:27:00.000Z	ramirand	phorensic	Well, I think it's supposed to... that doesn't mean all packages work 100%.
