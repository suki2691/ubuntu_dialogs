2009-09-13T11:25:00.000Z	djanatyn		I just got ubuntu running on my laptop, and I was wondering how to get to the tty so I can install another window-manager.
2009-09-13T11:25:00.000Z	RHorse	djanatyn	just open a terminal, don't need a separate tty to install another wm
2009-09-13T11:31:00.000Z	RHorse	djanatyn	you can open a terminal from the menu, or ctl-alt-F1 to get back ctl-alt-F7
