2008-12-25T14:50:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	onetinsoldier	Thanks for that update. Do we know what add the issue is with? Updating the system glibc is a bit over-the-top - output of valgrind or gdb would be the first step to pin-point the issue
2008-12-25T14:51:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	IntuitiveNipple	no, i don't know.all i know is what i've pasted in to you really.. see my last message to him right above
