2007-04-12T09:26:00.000Z	Noiano		hello everybody
2007-04-12T09:26:00.000Z	Noiano		can anyone advise me on a good ftp server, simpler than proftp?
2007-04-12T09:27:00.000Z	dyrne	Noiano	pureftpd has a gui front end called pureadmin  though ive never used it. anything wrong with ssh? you can use winscp as client in windows
2007-04-12T09:29:00.000Z	Noiano	dyrne	with that gui can I use proftpd without knowing how to configure it?
