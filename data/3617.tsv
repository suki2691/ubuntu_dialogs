2012-04-29T03:45:00.000Z	rkyle		Hi, I modifed compiz settings with the installable GUI and now nothing will show up when I log in. Would anyone know how to fix this?
2012-04-29T03:46:00.000Z	MirkoKa	rkyle	did you update on 12.04? Compiz doesn't work with it (yet?)
2012-04-29T03:47:00.000Z	rkyle	MirkoKa	Yes I'm running 12.04, I thought everything was ran by Compiz.
