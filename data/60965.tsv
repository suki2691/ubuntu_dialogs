2010-09-13T11:20:00.000Z	Blackweb		I have a labtop that I just install ubuntu 10.4 Lucid on and when its hooked up to a ethernet cord then the internet works just fine, but when I try to use the wireless on it then it sees the router and it gets a ip address from it, but when I open a browser then it says its time out, but hook a cord up and it works just fine would anyone know whats happening
2010-09-13T11:22:00.000Z	fk_007	Blackweb	I had an issue like that with a wireless card in my desktop, I tired some other software to handle the wireless connection from the repositories... worked for a while but then did the same thing :( maybe you will have better luck
2010-09-13T11:24:00.000Z	fk_007	Blackweb	basically, it was a while back so I don't remember the software/driver i replaced it with but I found the issue on a forum and they had the software name on there
2010-09-13T11:27:00.000Z	fk_007	Blackweb	might want to search for madwifi, ath_pci and atheros...could lead to some clues
