2005-12-22T13:16:00.000Z	StarKruzr		why is GIMP not a photoshop alternative?
2005-12-22T13:16:00.000Z	StarKruzr		it's not quite as feature-complete as PS but it's still really good.
2005-12-22T13:16:00.000Z	StarKruzr		of course it suffers from the same usability problems PS does.
2005-12-22T13:16:00.000Z	ormandj	StarKruzr	gimp isn't even close to PS :P
