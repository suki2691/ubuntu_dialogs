2007-10-23T04:04:00.000Z	Dex-Freudii	seamus7	did you upgrade from 7.04?
2007-10-23T04:04:00.000Z	seamus7	Dex-Freudii	I did ... to the Release Candidate .. then I did a fresh install
2007-10-23T04:08:00.000Z	seamus7	Dex-Freudii	an upgrade worked for me on my E1505 ... 7.10 is nice in that you can get the propietary FGLRX installed through one click in the Restricted Drivers Manager ... and that makes it almost worth it right there ... I did a fresh install a couple days ago just cause I like to do that and with / in its own partition it's not too much of a pain
