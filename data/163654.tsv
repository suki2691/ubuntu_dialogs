For some reason, when I try to partition it to have a primary / partition, a logical /home partition and a linux swap it won't allow me to do it.  Logical is greyed out and it gives me an error after it has created hda1

2006-10-23T10:16:00.000Z	wrabbit^		I'll try that now teledyn
2006-10-23T10:20:00.000Z	wrabbit^	teledyn	done, thanks for the suggestion
