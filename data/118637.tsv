2008-06-09T16:03:00.000Z	The-Seiman		Can someone give me a step-by-step guide to compile the Linux kernel with ﻿CONFIG_SECURITY_FILE_CAPABILITIES on ? because on my Ubuntu distro ( Hardy heron ), i can't use the setcap command :-/
2008-06-09T16:04:00.000Z	The-Seiman		or is there a patch to turn ﻿CONFIG_SECURITY_FILE_CAPABILITIES on ?
2008-06-09T16:05:00.000Z	bazhang	The-Seiman	you mean something like apparmor or selinux?
