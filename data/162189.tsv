2006-10-28T15:59:00.000Z	FallenHi1okiri		i have 2 systems running edgy. if i install a gtk2-theme from gnome-look.org (http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=42697 for example) and select it in the theme-manager it draws the ugly "default gtk2 theme" every theme shiped with ubuntu works - every theme i install doesn't work. what can i do?
2006-10-28T16:00:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	FallenHi1okiri	How are you installing the themes?
2006-10-28T16:01:00.000Z	FallenHi1okiri	ianmacgregor	i drag and drop them in the theme-manager (extracting them to .themes) doesn't work too (i tryed both ways) on a archlinux- system the themes work - so i don't think that they are broken
2006-10-28T16:02:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	FallenHi1okiri	Ok, if you're dragging and dropping them into ~/.themes and they still don't work, then it isn't the fault of the themes installer, something else is wrong. My advice won't help you, then.
