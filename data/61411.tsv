2009-03-30T00:51:00.000Z	marcosRz		how do I update clamav? I tried freshclam but It seens that the update is not packed yet, so will I need to install from src to allways get the latest?
2009-03-30T00:52:00.000Z	ikonia	marcosRz	the clam software is not updated, just the definitions, marcosRz don't worry about the "old version" warning
2009-03-30T00:52:00.000Z	marcosRz	ikonia	hmm but the definitions depends on the new pkg?
2009-03-30T00:52:00.000Z	ikonia	marcosRz	no, you can grab the definitions with freshclam
