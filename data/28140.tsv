2010-07-31T07:27:00.000Z	madamps		i started installing linux mint from the live cd and its on the "Please Wait - Resizing Partition..." screen. it said it might take a while, but it's been stalled at 0% for about 15 minutes. its not frozen - ie i can use everything else lag-free. is this normal? i know resizing takes a long time, but should i be at least progressing? i'm afraid to cancel and mess stuff up
2010-07-31T07:29:00.000Z	madamps		aw bazhang - it's empty. do you guys have any advice>
2010-07-31T07:30:00.000Z	madamps		i'm kind of irc-retarded. we are on freenode, right?
