2009-10-06T05:28:00.000Z	_Tristan	AdamB	everyone is downloading it at once, torrent it.
2009-10-06T05:28:00.000Z	AdamB	_Tristan	Actually already downloaded it. The lag is with browsing the internet on 9.10. Problem stands with both Firefox and Opera
2009-10-06T05:29:00.000Z	_Tristan	AdamB	oh. No idea then.
