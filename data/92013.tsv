When i first installed ubuntu 8.04 my computer booted ok and the boot graphics workedand everything then ubuntu gave me a message saying updates were available. So i upgrade, reboot and so my surprise i have no graphics! I have to wait untill ubuntu starts up inorder to see anything and even then its only when its time to login. So i re-installed ubuntu becaus

2008-06-16T06:21:00.000Z	kimbrel	clintchance	did you do a fresh install or an upgrade?
2008-06-16T06:22:00.000Z	kimbrel	clintchance	ok, and you’re on the default linux-image that the installer gave you?
