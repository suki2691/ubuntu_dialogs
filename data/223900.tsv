2007-04-17T12:00:00.000Z	Shirmpy_		i'm a fan of gnome
2007-04-17T12:02:00.000Z	Shirmpy_		KDE is like forcing mac and windows to join together. like it has the endless meuns (from windows) and the pretty ness form mac
2007-04-17T12:02:00.000Z	dv_	Shirmpy_	maybe because of the libs. technically, kde is way ahead of gnome. UI-wise, well, its controversial.
