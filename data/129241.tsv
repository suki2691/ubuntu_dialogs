2008-02-27T04:04:00.000Z	JasonWoof		epiphany  3.51s user 0.39s system 0% cpu 12:49.40 total
2008-02-27T04:05:00.000Z	JasonWoof		I updated everything "mark all updates", "apply" deleted /etc/network/interfaces, rebooted and ran network-manager
2008-02-27T04:06:00.000Z	Stwange	JasonWoof	because you've got a CPU draining timer with nice graphics timing it :)
