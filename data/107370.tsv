2008-05-21T09:22:00.000Z	No1CaNTeL		I am running ubuntu and I want to setup a dual boot with windows?
2008-05-21T09:22:00.000Z	Starnestommy	No1CaNTeL	it's because XP isn't detecting the hard disk
2008-05-21T09:26:00.000Z	Starnestommy	No1CaNTeL	because Windows is the OS that's having the problem, not Ubuntu
