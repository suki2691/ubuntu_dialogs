2011-04-29T23:19:00.000Z	Acriax		Hi, I'm about to install the latest Ubuntu as a virtual machine on my 64 bit windows 7 computer. Should I install the 64-bit or 32-bit version of Ubuntu? Is 64-bit as stable as 32? I'm just looking for what would be fastest and most stable.

2011-04-29T23:22:00.000Z	Acriax	zvacet	but I have more than 3gb available for the vm :)
