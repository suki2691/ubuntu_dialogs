2008-12-02T16:15:00.000Z	Blinkiz		Hi. I have a pptx file here (powerpoint 2007) that I want to convert to ppt, odp or pdf. I have OpenOffice 3.0 installed but it looks like shit. Anyway to convert it?

2008-12-02T16:16:00.000Z	norbert79	Blinkiz	Well, open the file, correct the errors in the file, and convert it after you have made the corrections
