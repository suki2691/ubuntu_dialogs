2007-04-06T07:28:00.000Z	ghatak		Hi, I am an Ubuntu user, currently running Fiesty Fawn, I want to switch to XUbuntu with minimal disrruption to my stuff and work. What is the best path I should take ?
2007-04-06T07:29:00.000Z	ant00n	ghatak	apt-get install XFCE4
2007-04-06T07:32:00.000Z	ghatak	ant00n	that installs fine, but when I login to xfce then there is nothing on desktop, no panels, no way to navigate etc. it looks broken
