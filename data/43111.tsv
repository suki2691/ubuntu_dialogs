2009-11-10T19:41:00.000Z	TheTom		Hello ubuntu-people! I'm following the guide located @ https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile but can't find a debian directory on my system, and thus not the "debian/rules updateconfigs" command. I found my kernel config file under /boot . Any hints? Maybe there's a newer guide, i've just upgraded to Karmic.
