2007-07-28T16:13:00.000Z	Anlar	humbolto	yes, if you really want public you do the bridge
2007-07-28T16:15:00.000Z	humbolto	Anlar	what I want are public IPs on a in-the-box virtual switch. I am routhing to that network through the parent system.
2007-07-28T16:16:00.000Z	Anlar	humbolto	it sounds like you should enable the bridged networking then
