2006-09-15T16:32:00.000Z	onthost	jonah1980	are the files owned by root? meaning only root can delete them?
2006-09-15T16:32:00.000Z	jonah1980	onthost	no they're owned by the user but i can't get rid of them
2006-09-15T16:33:00.000Z	jonah1980	onthost	i could of formatted the card fresh but it also won't let me copy files i need on the card to backup first
