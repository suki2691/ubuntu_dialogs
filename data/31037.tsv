2010-05-30T00:07:00.000Z	ch3mtail		I've tried to stop samba, ssh, etc. from starting at boot, but they're popping up just like before even though I purged all /etc/rc* directories of the respective symlinks.  It makes no sense.

2010-05-30T00:09:00.000Z	ch3mtail	Inazad	eh?  Load a kernel module called ssh, how does that relate to service init scripts?
