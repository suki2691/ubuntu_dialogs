2009-05-08T14:47:00.000Z	Guest66901		happyhessian::: I thibk you can also fiddel about with the ALSA conf settings to specify the default device...
2009-05-08T14:48:00.000Z	happyhessian	Guest66901	thanks, i'll look for it...though that it would seem that there should be some way to globally tell it to use the right soundcard, rather than having to fix it for every app
