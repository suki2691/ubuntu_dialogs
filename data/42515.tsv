2010-08-10T21:51:00.000Z	New2Ubuntu		I need some motivation to continue using ubuntu I use my pc for graphics and development as well as running my business so the usual stuff. I am tired of the compatibility issues, do you guys use Ubuntu for graphic development and web design
2010-08-10T21:52:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	New2Ubuntu	just dual boot, use windows offline only for design and ubuntu for everything else
2010-08-10T21:54:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	New2Ubuntu	graphic design, i could us gimp, web develpoment - vim and firefox (basically raw writing no wysiwyg)
