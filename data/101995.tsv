2008-04-10T05:33:00.000Z	mzanfardino	unop_	yes, I currently tar my financial records and encrypt them with openssl.  I was hoping I could encrype a whole working directory.  Maybe instead I could encrypt a partition and then mount it manually?  Is that possible?
2008-04-10T05:34:00.000Z	unop_	mzanfardino	sure, you can use something like truecrypt to mount volumes as encrypted filesystems
2008-04-10T05:35:00.000Z	mzanfardino	unop_	ok, I will look into truecrypt
