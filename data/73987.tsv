2009-02-22T09:22:00.000Z	Izinucs	hmw	on a rare occation on my dell vostro 1400 .. mostly I think that it might be a cold solder joint.. but you might have the right idea.
2009-02-22T09:23:00.000Z	Izinucs	hmw	like I said.. not sure where it comes from but if you know how to fix it.. good.. you might consider filing a bug but against what package I don't know.
2009-02-22T09:24:00.000Z	hmw	Izinucs	- lol. well... okay. its not really killing me. thx
