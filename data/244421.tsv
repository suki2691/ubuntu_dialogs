2005-06-10T11:21:00.000Z	Jim_the_LNX_NUB		Hi, if there is someone willing, Im a Recent XP changer-over- and have a few questions on software in Ubuntu. I'd like to know how to install software such as VLC media player through ubuntu, or any sotware for that matter, Ive read about apt-get, but dont know where on this fresh install to find it. Thanks for anyone who might be able to help
