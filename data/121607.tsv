2008-05-10T01:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	cmorgan	depends o the workload i guess
2008-05-10T01:30:00.000Z	cmorgan	erUSUL	i've heard xfs suggested but i didn't want to pick a filesystem that couldn't be extended as the lvm volume grows
2008-05-10T01:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	cmorgan	xfs is high performance filesystem and i'm sure it can be resized
