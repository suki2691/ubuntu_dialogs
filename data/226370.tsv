2006-07-01T05:24:00.000Z	atlantian		Here is my question today :P, I try to do SU in terminal, try to login as root,  and it always says wrong password or wrong username, and yet when i need to run things like username and it asks for password it works no problem, I cant mount an external drive because I need to be root also, but it will not let me in as root.. What is going on?
