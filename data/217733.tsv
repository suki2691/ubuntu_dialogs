2011-06-20T08:36:00.000Z	K-Rich		Hi all, I'm using Ubuntu 10.04, and have Google Chrome installed, all works great, except i can't for the life of me get it to play movies online, flv is fine, but .avi .mov .mp4 .mpg don't play... i get the totem page but the video never plays, works fine in FF4 though
