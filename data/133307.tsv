2007-06-11T08:33:00.000Z	nootrope		Hiya. I'm trying to install avidemux on Fiesty (may or may not be a good idea). The wiki's directions for Ubuntu say to type "apt-get cache search avidemux" after adding Universe etc to sources.list.What are these cache and search arguments? I don't recognize them and neither does the shell.
2007-06-11T08:34:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	nootrope	apt-cache search something
2007-06-11T08:35:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	nootrope	means you search in your cache of the packages list
2007-06-11T08:37:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	nootrope	on a terminal type apt-cache search avidemux
