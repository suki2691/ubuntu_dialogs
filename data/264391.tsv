2006-01-07T15:57:00.000Z	dos-assassin		I have installed Ares, through the use of wine, and I have even downloaded music with it... but the songs will not show up in the folder and after about 15 minutes of running the program I have so many errors in my terminal that my computer locks up... any help?

2006-01-07T16:00:00.000Z	dos-assassin		Alright... so what would you suggest for a good P2P Client and how exactly should I install it?
