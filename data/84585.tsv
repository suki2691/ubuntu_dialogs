2008-12-14T08:44:00.000Z	digitalnorm		i have a cunundrum.  i just began using ubuntu from xp. ubuntu made new partitions for itself from free space and the two hudred gig of photos and tele and music etc that was the only thing on my sata hard drive called "media" became a folder in "places" called "media" and it stilll contained all my stuff.  then i imported the whole contents of "media\music" into rhythmbox and now the music folder is empty (although still the location
2008-12-14T08:44:00.000Z	digitalnorm		in properties of songs in r.b.) and i cannot find my music any where except in rhythmbox.  the properties of the "media" folder say it is still 200 gig large, BUT, when i add up the size of all of the folders, it is 70 gig short of that, the same 70 gig of music that is missing.  my music is invisible and it is freaking me out.  i know it is still there because i can play it in r.b but i nor a search engine can find it in an explorer
