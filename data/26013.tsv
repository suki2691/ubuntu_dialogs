2010-09-22T03:17:00.000Z	Roasted		Partition Question - I dual boot Win/Ubuntu. I'm installing Win 7 now. I noticed Windows 7 creates a 100mb partition by default at the front of the disk, before your partition you create. Will I be able to install Win 7 (100mb partition + 150gb standard NTFS partition) as well as Ubuntu w/ 2gb swap - 25gb root - remainder of disk home? Or would that be too many partitions?
