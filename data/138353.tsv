2007-07-22T08:45:00.000Z	allquixotic	sayers	I'd recommend *not* using the X86_64 architecture, even though your system supports it, due to many proprietary programs and some drivers being broken on X64. short answer is yes, the i386 distribution will work fine

2007-07-22T08:46:00.000Z	allquixotic	sayers	One problem with the x86_64 (amd64) version is that the Sun Java JRE doesn't support a browser plugin - don't know when they'll get around to that - so you've either got to use a 32-bit firefox or just use the i386 distro
