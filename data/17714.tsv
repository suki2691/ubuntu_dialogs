2011-04-06T23:47:00.000Z	Adom		QUESTION: ubuntu keeps kicking me off ssh sessions with "Write failed: Broken pipe". i've googled hardcore and found many people with this problem only with ubuntu, but ive tried each possible fix and no improvement. is there a fix i havent found? seems like a popular problem.

2011-04-06T23:49:00.000Z	Adom	maco	i thought it was timing out as well but i've tried adding "TCPKeepAlive yes" and "ServerAliveInterval 200" to ssh_config and still does it
