2005-10-23T10:38:00.000Z	prg		Hello.  New to Ubuntu, somewhat new to linux.  Just installed breezy and now trying to get updates and upgrade kernel (using synaptic).  I keep getting warning messages that the files cannot be found on the server.  I checked manually and they aren't there [us.archive.ubuntu.com] .  Anyone konw how to point the software to another repository?
