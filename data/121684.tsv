2007-09-16T12:37:00.000Z	DjBones	Krimpet	i know xfce4-terminal has a function for that in its preferences
2007-09-16T12:37:00.000Z	DjBones	Krimpet	then again its just a wrapper for xterm haha
2007-09-16T12:38:00.000Z	Krimpet	DjBones	i tried setting this thing in my .Xdefaults that is supposedly supposed to make xterm flash, but it doesn't seem to work. :/
