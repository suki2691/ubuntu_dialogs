2007-04-21T14:39:00.000Z	ringo	Niek	i know, but the question was -need- and no you dont always need.  for instance if you have 1gig of ram and a 1gig swap, thast the same as having 2 gig of ram
2007-04-21T14:40:00.000Z	Niek	ringo	but swap is very slow :P
2007-04-21T14:40:00.000Z	ringo	Niek	yup.  but you got the same amount of spae before your system crashes
