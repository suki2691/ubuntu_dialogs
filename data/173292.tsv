2011-04-28T06:33:00.000Z	RedLance		Ok, I want to give my kids read only access to the Music samba share, but I want my wife and I to have read/write access...how do I set that up, please?
2011-04-28T06:35:00.000Z	RedLance		Ok, thanks everybody!
2011-04-28T06:37:00.000Z	RedLance		Does it change anything if I admit that the wife and kids access the samba server with Windows?  I use Ubuntu of course, and the samba server is Ubuntu too.  Are groups still the way to go?
