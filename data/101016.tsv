2008-02-22T19:06:00.000Z	DEinspanjer		I recently enabled gutsy-backports updates because of this one package I was trying to get running.  When I enabled it though, it was marked with a - instead of a checkmark and I can't un-enable it.  This is bothering me because now my updates notification keeps showing me all these compvis updates and other things I don't want to muck with.  How can I disable these updates?
