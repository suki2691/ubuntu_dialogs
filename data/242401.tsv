2008-07-29T20:29:00.000Z	gordonjcp	kippy	handy hint - work out how to install qemu and install a build of Ubuntu into that
2008-07-29T20:29:00.000Z	kippy	morbyte	yeah that is good option, but its not that something is wrong with the system. It just interests me to play around, just need a bit starting up guidance
