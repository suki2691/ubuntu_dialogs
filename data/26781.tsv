2011-04-01T22:34:00.000Z	kyan		Hello. My computer has suddenly become very slow, after attempting to run disk wiping Also, my external hard drive has refused to mount automatically on boot, which (mostly) it has previously done.
2011-04-01T22:34:00.000Z	kyan		What should I do to diagnose and solve those problems?
2011-04-01T22:35:00.000Z	beniwtv	kyan	The "dmesg" command in the terminal might give some hints
2011-04-01T22:37:00.000Z	kyan	beniwtv	Thanks. I am looking through that now.
