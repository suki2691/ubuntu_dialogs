2006-07-07T11:53:00.000Z	Newb		Hello, I've never tried Linux before and so far have yet to check any in depth faqs. With the WGA problem plagueing Windows, I was wondering if Ubuntu is the most newb friendly Linux to try. Will I need to know some technical stuff before being able to install it?
2006-07-07T11:53:00.000Z	Newb		Is this the wrong place to ask?
2006-07-07T11:54:00.000Z	Knorrie	Newb	This is the right place
