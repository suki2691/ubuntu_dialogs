2012-02-06T20:19:00.000Z	naptastic		How would I roll back an update that broke something? (Current Firefox is crashing constantly; I just want to go back to the version I had installed before.)
2012-02-06T20:21:00.000Z	Oer	naptastic	you could try delete the firefox folder first > ~/.mozilla/firefox
2012-02-06T20:22:00.000Z	naptastic	Oer	not a bad idea, and since I have sync, not a problem either.
2012-02-06T20:22:00.000Z	Oer	naptastic	that would delete damages or incorrect settings
