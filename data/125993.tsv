2007-08-05T05:07:00.000Z	kitche	williemayshayes	the .inf is inside the .exe file some are just zip files
2007-08-05T05:07:00.000Z	williemayshayes	kitche	so i should download the exe file?  Then what should i do to get the inf?
2007-08-05T05:08:00.000Z	kitche	williemayshayes	unzip <name>.exe if it's just an zip archieve some aren't though
