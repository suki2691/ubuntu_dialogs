2006-07-15T11:26:00.000Z	Subhuman	squidgy	i have videos that are all skewed and lame in totem, but in gxine are crystal
2006-07-15T11:26:00.000Z	squidgy	Subhuman	 my color problem is for all videos in totem, not just ones with particular codecs.  I'll give gxine a try, thanks.
2006-07-15T11:27:00.000Z	Subhuman	squidgy	if you get w32codecs & gxine then they work great together.
