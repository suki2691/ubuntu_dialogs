2006-06-29T11:41:00.000Z	sylvar		So: Is there anything that'll run on Dapper that will let me copy, resize, or move ntfs partitions?
2006-06-29T11:42:00.000Z	cwillu	sylvar	I've resized ntfs with gparted before, although I was thrilled by the manner in which it did it (it looked like it failed, two different ways, but it did actually resize)
2006-06-29T11:43:00.000Z	cwillu	sylvar	alternatively, if you can find a copy of 'bootitng', an old dos bootdisk/bootmanager, it has support for resizing ntfs partitions, and is my preferred tool
