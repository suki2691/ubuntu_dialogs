2005-09-30T08:19:00.000Z	mdke	bigfoot1	change hoary to breezy in /etc/apt/sources.list, run apt-get update then apt-get dist-upgrade
2005-09-30T08:19:00.000Z	bigfoot1	mdke	is it safe to go from hoary to breezy? will my files be safe?
2005-09-30T08:21:00.000Z	mdke	bigfoot1	back up first, but it is fairly safe, yes
