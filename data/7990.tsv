2011-11-05T17:56:00.000Z	ubidoobi2		hi all ... I just installed linux via alternate cd (desktop would not insall) ... it got to the part where it asked to install grub.  I am not sure if it installed. ... but it hung for a long time ... then continued installing ubuntu.  I have win7 ultimate on this hdd as well and I would like to boot both.  How would I go about finding grub (if it installed) ... and how do I go about adding win7 to the boot menu..
