2005-08-07T15:13:00.000Z	levander	Belutz	it's not out of the ballpark
2005-08-07T15:14:00.000Z	Belutz	levander	ic, because i see my system only use a little space of swap memory
2005-08-07T15:16:00.000Z	levander	Belutz	yeah, people put even more than that in swap, dunno why, I put like 500MB because it was recommended somewhere.  But, if you're every using more than say 100MB, you're system is going to be unbearable slow
