2010-02-20T19:54:00.000Z	Will123456		hey guys. i've installed ubuntu on a PC next to the TV meant primarily for watching videos on the internet, and it's running off a fully fledged install off ubuntu on a USB stick. however performance can sometimes be sluggish - is there any way to increase the amount off RAM used to cache data from the drive?

2010-02-20T19:56:00.000Z	Will123456	stefaan	definitely, yeah. it's especially annoying when accessing different menus (i'm using the netbook remix) - if there was any way to force it to read those menu items at start up and remember them, it'd be great
