2007-01-15T14:24:00.000Z	joshua__		hey folks, I've got two 160g drives, the second I mostly use for storage (music and such) but I'm doing a new installation right now and wonder how people usually set up a drive that has /, /usr, /var, swap, and /home if a drive only allows 4 primary partitions?
2007-01-15T14:25:00.000Z	hjmills	joshua__	using extended partitions :D
2007-01-15T14:25:00.000Z	joshua__	hjmills	but for which partition?
2007-01-15T14:26:00.000Z	hjmills	joshua__	for sanity i would put / and /boot on primaries and the rest i couldnt care less about
