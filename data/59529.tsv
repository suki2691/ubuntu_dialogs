2010-02-02T09:16:00.000Z	charles__		well, i kep hearing about how linux OSes havea  lot celaner systems because their application uninstall is very efficient and thorough, but any time i uninsall something, there are still a load of things (directories, files, etc) left behind
2010-02-02T09:17:00.000Z	charles__		someone suggested i use bleachbit as a system maintenance tool, and it kep showing firefox as something to clean up.. evne though i uninstalled it
