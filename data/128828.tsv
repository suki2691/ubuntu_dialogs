Also, just a question, I have ran the Fedora 7 live CD and also had Fedora 7 installed and it detected and used 1680x1050 out-of-the-box. What is the difference between the two distros and why doesn't Ubuntu detect it correctly.

2007-07-06T08:08:00.000Z	firebird611	ptn107	Ok, I could give it a try I guess. I would like to get the issue resolved.
