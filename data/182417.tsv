2007-01-11T06:29:00.000Z	Scooter7		Hi guys, earlier today I was here asking for help with X server.   I was told to type 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'.   I did that, and configured X server.   When I was done, I typed 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart'.   However,  GDM failed to start.   What went wrong?   Any special settings I need to set when reconfiguring?
