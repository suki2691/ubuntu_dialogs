2009-11-24T02:25:00.000Z	teamcoltra		My internet keeps disconnecting on me. Yes I have WPA, yes I have followed all the WPA existing tutorials, yes I am using the latest "stable" version of Karmic. My internet just randomly crashes. Then it asks me to input the password again (instead of getting it from the keyring) and then it doesn't accept it
2009-11-24T02:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	teamcoltra	tried installing linux-backports-modules-karmic-generic ??
2009-11-24T02:26:00.000Z	teamcoltra	erUSUL	no what does it do?
2009-11-24T02:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	teamcoltra	install newer drivers (for wifi mainly)
