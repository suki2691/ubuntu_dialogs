2010-11-16T22:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zol	if you are SURE you want to remove them and in the way then prepend the command with sudo

2010-11-16T22:35:00.000Z	Zol	ActionParsnip	I'm not sure - but I don't know how to become sure either. I couldn't find any installed packages in aptitude (which I mainly use)
