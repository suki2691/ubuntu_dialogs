2010-05-15T06:08:00.000Z	debugnet	dominicdinada	cool, thx
2010-05-15T06:09:00.000Z	debugnet	dominicdinada	sounds like the ietf added that requirement cuz they ran out with the 1024.
2010-05-15T06:10:00.000Z	dominicdinada	debugnet	As the last N+ states 0-1024 are Registered 1025-30-40 are Reserved and the rest are just there
