2009-11-22T17:12:00.000Z	dharcker		I need the sendmail command to send email on the CLI, but I don't need a full MTA like exim or postfix... Any idea how to just install the sendmail binary?
2009-11-22T17:13:00.000Z	talon_	dharcker	you probably do need a full MTA
2009-11-22T17:14:00.000Z	dharcker	talon_	are you sure? I don't want to run anything on port 25 on this machine, i just want to be able to send email from the cli
