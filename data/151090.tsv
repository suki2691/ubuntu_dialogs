2007-01-12T17:29:00.000Z	clayg		is there a way to go NFS all the wya?
2007-01-12T06:14:00.000Z	clayg		IF you guys were setting up a file server strictly to share files to windows and linux machines, would you create a user, then a subdirectory of it, or is it safe to create a directory one level off of root and give it permissions?
