2006-05-25T10:48:00.000Z	blue-frog		noone on this channel I'd just like to know how to do that
2006-05-25T10:48:00.000Z	roryy	blue-frog	/ignore nick@*!* is one way -- where nick is to be replaced by the nick in question
2006-05-25T10:48:00.000Z	roryy	blue-frog	depending on your irc client, /help ignore might tell you something
