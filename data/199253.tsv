2007-12-23T08:12:00.000Z	Old_Gregg		I basically want to format the computer and completely remove ubuntu.
2007-12-23T08:12:00.000Z	thor	Old_Gregg	are you going to reinstall windows or just format the partition that linux is using?
2007-12-23T08:13:00.000Z	thor	Old_Gregg	then when you start th einstall just tell windows to use the entire drive...
