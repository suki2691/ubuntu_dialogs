2008-02-19T18:50:00.000Z	dubcat		ozzloy: I made the move from windows to ubuntu in a very dramatic way - i tried to g-part my WORK laptop and screwed it up - since then ive been fully on Ubuntu - and just use virtualbox for anything i need windows for (vpn client for check point for example).
2008-02-19T18:52:00.000Z	dubcat		the only reason i have to run ANY windows related software is my freakin vpn client :(  if there was some way to access check point vpn from linux i could just run outlook from crossover office
