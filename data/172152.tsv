2006-08-09T07:59:00.000Z	Tim``		i'm having a problem with sound recording: if i have sounds playing in the backgrond (say, notification sounds on Gaim), and i record sound using Sound Recorder or Audacity, those notification sounds appear on the audio track being recorded: even if the sound output volume on Volume Control is completely muted
2006-08-09T07:59:00.000Z	Tim``		as if it's doing some kind of "audio-thru" in software - can anyone help?

2006-08-09T08:02:00.000Z	|thunder	Tim``	open the volume control.
