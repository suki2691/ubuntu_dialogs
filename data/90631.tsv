2008-07-07T05:07:00.000Z	tully		hi i recently installed ubuntu and when I try to load up the windows cd after it says inspecting hardware it just goes blank. I did some research and it seems it messes up because it can't recognize ext3 and linux swap partitions. I tried added a fat32 partition and it was still unable to read. Is there any way I could fix this?
