2011-04-30T23:23:00.000Z	d3tour		Hey guys, I have just upgraded to 11.04 (switched to gnome 3 from unity but other than that a pretty basic install) and I am playing around with the screen recording for the first time. Can someone point me in the right direction for saving the recordings in a fileformat other than .webm?
2011-04-30T23:24:00.000Z	muelli	d3tour	you could use smth like istanbul or recordmydesktop
2011-04-30T23:25:00.000Z	d3tour	muelli	So just use a different app?
2011-04-30T23:26:00.000Z	muelli	d3tour	yes. I don't know how to modify the GStreamer Pipeline that is used to create that webm video. Dunno even if it's easily possible. It should be by writing a plugin thuogh.
