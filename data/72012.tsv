2011-06-30T14:28:00.000Z	slacker-		I'm noticing a constant 13kbps down and 35kbps upload traffic from my 11.04 when idle. Is that expected?
2011-06-30T14:29:00.000Z	qin	slacker-	iftop to see what traffic it is, or netstat -tuep, or ngrep
2011-06-30T14:46:00.000Z	slacker-	qin	thanks for suggesting iftop. much easier than trying to make sense from the iptables logfile :)
