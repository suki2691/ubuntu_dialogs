2008-01-17T00:26:00.000Z	roshi		can some one tell me what it means to own your home directory, when the permissions are "owned by root"?

2008-01-17T00:29:00.000Z	genii	roshi	username of fred owns everything underneath /home/Fred    he can't go to just /home because that is directory one above what he has rights to
