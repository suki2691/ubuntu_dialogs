2007-01-10T11:55:00.000Z	clearzen		My friend has quotes that appear when he logs on to his slackware box via ssh. He said that it was part of a package called bsd games. Does anyone know how I could get this to work with ubuntu?
2007-01-10T11:55:00.000Z	arrenlex	clearzen	the bsdgames exists in the repos.
2007-01-10T11:58:00.000Z	clearzen	arrenlex	I do have it installed but it still does not show the random quotes when I log in via terminal. Any ideas?
2007-01-10T11:59:00.000Z	arrenlex	clearzen	Nope. I've never messed with anything like that.
