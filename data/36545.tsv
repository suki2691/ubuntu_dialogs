2010-05-21T10:02:00.000Z	newbie10K		hello; anyone know if updating my kernel after upgrading from karmic to lucid is worth doing?
2010-05-21T10:03:00.000Z	newbie10K		I ran the upgrade and have kernel 2.6.31-20
2010-05-21T10:03:00.000Z	newbie10K		not sure what i started out with or if it actually did get updated
2010-05-21T10:03:00.000Z	GeekSquid	newbie10K	have you rebooted?
