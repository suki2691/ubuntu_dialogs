2007-10-04T08:48:00.000Z	RussDraper		I'm having a strange problem in Gnome... I can't move a window from one monitor to the other!  NVidia driver, 3 monitors.  1280x1024, 1280x1024 and 1280x720
2007-10-04T08:49:00.000Z	RussDraper		I have a applications/places/system menu on each monitor, and they work fine.  I just can't move a window from screen A to screen B
