2012-08-21T19:38:00.000Z	jardineworks		hey guys -- I am having a problem with my VPN when I have a static IP assigned to my desktop. It's not the provider, but rather an issue with Linsys apparently
2012-08-21T19:38:00.000Z	jardineworks		in /var/log/syslog I can see this -- with invalid source port 32768 on interface 'eth0.0'
2012-08-21T19:38:00.000Z	jardineworks		can anyone help? I can't seem to find an answer
2012-08-21T19:39:00.000Z	GeekAdmin	jardineworks	 have you tried upgrading the firmware of your router?
