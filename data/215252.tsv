2005-11-20T13:12:00.000Z	cid		Today after a reboot my samba server doesn't work anymore. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Could anyone help me, please?
2005-11-20T13:13:00.000Z	cid		I have also tried "sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart" but it says that it fails.
2005-11-20T13:15:00.000Z	soundray	cid	any other clues from the error message?
2005-11-20T13:20:00.000Z	soundray	cid	there may be relevant messages in /var/log/syslog and in /var/log/samba/
