2012-08-31T02:29:00.000Z	mcnellis		Is cat guaranteed to give me the file at the end of *some* file write i.e. that the file will end with a newline or is it possible that cat will give me the last line in the middle of its writing i.e. the last line is only half written
2012-08-31T02:31:00.000Z	mcnellis		Ok, so if I'm dealing with a file that's being constantly written to, I should use cp first and then gzip the cp'd file  instead of using cat file | gzip
