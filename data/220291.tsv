2008-01-05T11:24:00.000Z	Nasari		sorry, I have a poor question: How does one open or close a port?
2008-01-05T11:26:00.000Z	Nasari		Ain't most ports closed by default? - If so how can open one
2008-01-05T11:26:00.000Z	Flannel	Nasari	You don't really open them, you just have something listen/connect to them
2008-01-05T11:29:00.000Z	Flannel	Nasari	yes
