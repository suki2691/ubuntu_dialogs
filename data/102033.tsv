2008-02-12T08:34:00.000Z	astyler		Ok, quick question.  I'm trying to switch to ubuntu from windows for the first time.  Every time I try to "check disk for errors" or "intall or start ubuntu", my monitor loses signal and nothing is displayed.  I'm using an 8800gt with two dvi ports.  Any ideas how to get this installed?
