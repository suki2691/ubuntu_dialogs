2008-12-29T21:31:00.000Z	F-3000		Hello! Is it possible to make full copy of current system with something like "sudo cp /* /mount/hd2/*" ?
2008-12-29T21:32:00.000Z	praet	F-3000	i think you should use a disk copy (partion to another)
2008-12-29T21:33:00.000Z	praet	F-3000	search dd
2008-12-29T21:35:00.000Z	F-3000	praet	would it be easy to restore the system from the image made with dd?
