2009-08-21T12:16:00.000Z	smogattack		I am using Exaile music player and lots of times the screen turns black and then goes to login screen.... it says something about pulseaudio in a red asterisk. I'm using ubuntu 9.04. Any help?

2009-08-21T12:16:00.000Z	smogattack	marines	should I uninstall it?
2009-08-21T12:17:00.000Z	marines	smogattack	yeah, then install "esound" and change settings every application to use ALSA instead of Pulse Audio
