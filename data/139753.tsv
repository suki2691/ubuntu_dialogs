2007-04-22T11:54:00.000Z	Stig		Hi all. Is there a program or any way to help configure my battery on my laptop? I am new to Ubuntu and have noticed my battery does not last as long as it did on XP. Any idea's why?

2007-04-22T11:56:00.000Z	Stig	kemik	How do I enable energy saving options? and can I possibly set different profiles that I can switch to when using battery power? It would be quite annoying having to change the settings everytime I switch to battery power.
