2008-04-13T02:26:00.000Z	Trollet		Hello, I'm using Ubuntu 8.04 Beta. I have a couple of problems to connect with DHCP to Internet trough my router. The problem is that the Ubuntu computer doesn't has the same netmask  and ip-spread as the other computer that is connected to Internet trough the same router. Is there anyone who think he/she has a sollution?
