2009-05-23T19:46:00.000Z	so0ky		I need some help.  I have two hard drives on my computer, one drive runs windows, and the other runs Ubuntu.  I had a HAL.DLL error on my windows drive, and I fixed it.  However, now when I boot my computer, it doesn't prompt me to choose what operating system to log into, even if I force the computer to look at my Ubuntu drive.  I just get an error.  It automatically loads into windows.
