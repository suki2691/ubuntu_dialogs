2009-08-11T20:20:00.000Z	sandstrom		I'm trying to use su --login username but can't get past the authentication. Tried my own password and root password.
2009-08-11T20:20:00.000Z	sandstrom		Anyone know what I may be doing wrong?
2009-08-11T20:21:00.000Z	th0r	sandstrom	you can only login as username with username's password
2009-08-11T20:21:00.000Z	sandstrom	th0r	I don't think that user has one. It's a system only user
