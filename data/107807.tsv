2008-01-03T10:03:00.000Z	Pie-rat2		i have local mirrors of both the feisty and gutsy repositories. is there any way i can get my feisty box to upgrade to gutsy using those?
2008-01-03T10:04:00.000Z	happygnuyear	Pie-rat2	i believe it is as easy as update, upgrade, dist-upgrade
2008-01-03T10:05:00.000Z	Pie-rat2	happygnuyear	so, do i put my gutsy mirrors in sources.list, update, and tell it to dist-upgrade?
