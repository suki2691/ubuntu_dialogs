2008-11-01T04:43:00.000Z	nickrud	emorris	normally yes, as long as they used compatible versioning
2008-11-01T04:44:00.000Z	emorris	nickrud	ok, it should be fine then. it's just that I want to install a one off package from hardy-backports, but might upgrade to intrepid later
2008-11-01T04:46:00.000Z	emorris	nickrud	that should be a factoid
