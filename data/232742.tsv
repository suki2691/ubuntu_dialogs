2010-05-01T16:43:00.000Z	cyy		how does one keep a process running at all times, even when not logged in?
2010-05-01T16:45:00.000Z	cyy		it isn't a gui app, though getting access to its stdout/stdin again when I log in (even if I have to run a command) would be nice
2010-05-01T16:45:00.000Z	cyy		I'll look at screen and nohup...
2010-05-01T16:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	cyy	then screen is the answer
