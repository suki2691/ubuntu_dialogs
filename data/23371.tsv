2010-10-29T15:49:00.000Z	mosaiks		i have mounted a filesystem in a /mnt/storage but how do i make it accessible for all users not only root?
2010-10-29T15:50:00.000Z	Onyx47	mosaiks	sudo chmod 777 /mnt/storage will give all users all permissions on the drive
2010-10-29T15:51:00.000Z	mosaiks	Onyx47	hmm the mnt/storage folder was already accessible by everyone i guess
2010-10-29T15:53:00.000Z	mosaiks	Onyx47	how?
