2008-07-05T14:41:00.000Z	Sertse		tinkering with my other comp doing a min install. What is something light, yet has "system" stuff included? Currently it only has "just" a wm.. and I doubt I want to search for a package config each thing itself..

2008-07-05T14:45:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Sertse	you can use the command line tools and manual config editing to set all of that if you want
