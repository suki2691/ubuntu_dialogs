2010-09-19T14:03:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	thune3	no, and that seems bizarre although not rly unlikely
2010-09-19T14:05:00.000Z	thune3	Jesdisciple	i'm probably wrong on that one, now that i look at it further, but you have me curious now. I just don't want to log out and log back in.
2010-09-19T14:05:00.000Z	Jesdisciple	thune3	requiring full paths seems ridiculous although I know there are odd technical difficulties involved with some apparently trivial features
