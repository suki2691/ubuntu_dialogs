2011-06-16T19:03:00.000Z	b0ef		if I install 10.04 on a computer later today, I would get a huge load of updates. I'm right now on a high bandwidth station. Is there any way to get a wget list of packages that I can bring with me to that site?
2011-06-16T19:04:00.000Z	hipster-swede	b0ef	get 10.04.3, it's fairly up to date already
2011-06-16T19:05:00.000Z	b0ef	hipster-swede	right, but I need to install it via memory stick and I don't want to make one now
