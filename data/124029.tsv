2010-04-19T07:37:00.000Z	David-A	isaac_	yes, it should be, just stop the 1st torrent client, start the 2nd client and give it the same torrent file and the same download folder.

2010-04-19T07:50:00.000Z	isaac_	David-A	the file so far:  Is this the file stored in Ubuntu's "Downloads" folder, that Properties says is already full size?  Or do I need to find the Transmission operating folder to get the part file?
