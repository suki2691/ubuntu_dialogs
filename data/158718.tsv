2009-02-01T03:42:00.000Z	Slart	Limitt	testdisk is one.. don't know if it's the "stongest"
2009-02-01T03:45:00.000Z	Slart	Limitt	if you've installed an os on top of it I doubt you'll find much to recover
2009-02-01T03:46:00.000Z	Slart	Limitt	very possible.. give it a try and see what you find.. but expect a lot of hard work.. it won't be "save *.mp3 in this folder"
