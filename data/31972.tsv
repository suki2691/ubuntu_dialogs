2010-05-16T05:53:00.000Z	Gozar		What is the "standard" instant messaging protocol for us GNU/Linux users? XMPP?
2010-05-16T05:54:00.000Z	BalSak	Gozar	xmpp, irc, sip. anythin, really
2010-05-16T05:56:00.000Z	Gozar	BalSak	Yeah, but I was thinking instead of the big ones that Microsoft, Yahoo, Skype, etc have, where they can basically change whenever they like and basically stop "us" from using them..
2010-05-16T05:57:00.000Z	BalSak	Gozar	not really; they'll have to contend with legacy systems (IE6 is still alive & kicking)
