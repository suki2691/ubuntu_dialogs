2005-09-11T12:09:00.000Z	tommi^		How do I find out what programs are accessing partition x?
2005-09-11T12:09:00.000Z	nlogax	tommi^	I would use lsof output against df to see which files were where
2005-09-11T12:10:00.000Z	nlogax		lsof = list open files
2005-09-11T12:10:00.000Z	tommi^	nlogax	I'll try, thanks
