2007-12-31T19:34:00.000Z	orapronobis		I own a Mac and I use Mac OS X Leopard. I'm thinking that perhaps I should diss Leopard, and get Ubuntu instead. What are good reasons for me to install Ubuntu rather than keep going with the Mac? Non-religious reasons, of course.

2007-12-31T19:35:00.000Z	orapronobis	hgraey	that's a good point.
