2012-08-22T04:47:00.000Z	zykotick9	Budd	"chromium" shouldn't be google "branded", it might be the defaults for most stuff (but that should be changable)
2012-08-22T04:48:00.000Z	Budd	zykotick9	I get many prompts to log in to Google, which I have no intention of doing, and the extensions page points me to the google "store".
2012-08-22T04:49:00.000Z	zykotick9	Budd	if you won't like google, don't support them by using chromium... or worse chrome.
