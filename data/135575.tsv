2007-11-14T23:06:00.000Z	soundray		I would like to run a kernel with CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_DEBUG enabled. Do I have to compile the entire kernel, or is there an easier way?
2007-11-14T23:06:00.000Z	bardyr	soundray	use the -debug kernel?
2007-11-14T23:07:00.000Z	soundray	bardyr	cool, that's something I hadn't been aware of. Thanks!
2007-11-14T23:13:00.000Z	soundray	bardyr	can you point me to any additional information? There is not /boot/config-* file for the debug kernel...
