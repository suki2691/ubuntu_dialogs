2008-01-17T11:04:00.000Z	KurtKraut	oldude67	yes... but you'd need to copy the partition content, not the partition itself. So you'd need to create a new partition in the other hardrive and past the files from one to another.

2008-01-17T11:05:00.000Z	KurtKraut	oldude67	maybe there is a shortcut to do it... but I can't remind. I've never attempted to do something similr to it.
