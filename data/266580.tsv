2010-04-25T08:12:00.000Z	Omen_20		Hi. I have downloaded the .so file for Flash RC2 but I cant figure out where to place it.
2010-04-25T08:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Omen_20	 its best to install flash using the package manager. Not by downloading files from adobe
2010-10-26T06:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Omen_20	 echo $PATH
2010-10-26T06:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Omen_20	 export the PATH variable as needed/set it as needed.
