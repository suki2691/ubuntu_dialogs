2012-10-04T02:05:00.000Z	Dazzzz		Can I ask a question?
2012-10-04T02:06:00.000Z	Dazzzz		For some reason, my mouse will freeze up using the latest version, it takes a reboot to clear it up, anyone experience this?
2012-10-04T02:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dazzzz	does the system have a make and model? What mouse are you using?
2012-10-04T02:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dazzzz	have you tried a different USB port?
