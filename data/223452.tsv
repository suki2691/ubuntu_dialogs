2006-08-30T07:20:00.000Z	jolt		Right near the end with a python error
2006-08-30T07:21:00.000Z	Tennessee	jolt	Bummer. Just for my info, where did you get it from? I can't find anything downloadable and don't feel like risking my install at the moment...
2006-08-30T07:22:00.000Z	Tennessee	jolt	Thanks! I'll try it just in case. If it flies, I want the new packages.
