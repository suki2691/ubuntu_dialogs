2011-11-24T05:48:00.000Z	dweimer	pragmaticenigma	Alright, I'll give that a shot. Will I be prompted to select a network install or do I need to setup a kickstart file to do it?
2011-11-24T05:48:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	dweimer	I'm not sure... they have a special ISO for the network install... I've only done it once and it took forever...

Based on the changelogs it looks like package udev 173-0ubuntu4 has the fix for the bug. I'm checking my iso image now to see what version is on the disk.
