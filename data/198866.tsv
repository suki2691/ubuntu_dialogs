2006-04-28T11:55:00.000Z	joshr		i have all my music as mp3's on my windows box, is there a better format to play it on ubuntu, and if so a decent way to convert them?

2006-04-28T11:57:00.000Z	Frogzoo	joshr	yes indeed
2006-04-28T11:58:00.000Z	Frogzoo	joshr	'sudo apt-get install amarok amarok-xine'  - then open amarok & select xine as engine
