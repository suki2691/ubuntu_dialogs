2006-10-08T06:15:00.000Z	Garbaek		Could someone help me build a script that restarts a process when it crashes ?
2006-10-08T06:17:00.000Z	sethk	Garbaek	there are tools available that will do that better than a script you can write
2006-10-08T06:17:00.000Z	sethk	Garbaek	look at the daemontools package.  look at the respawn option of inittab
