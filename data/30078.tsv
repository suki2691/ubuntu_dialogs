2011-06-08T14:27:00.000Z	saamm		One of my friend bought Braid from Software Center, but sound is not working. Where should I report this?
2011-06-08T14:28:00.000Z	saamm		is there an irc channel for paid apps support?
2011-06-08T14:28:00.000Z	Kruptein	saamm	the problem probably is caused by the program not with ubuntu
2011-06-08T14:30:00.000Z	Kruptein	saamm	you will have to use the email as it's only braid who can fix it
