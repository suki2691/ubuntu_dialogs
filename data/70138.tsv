2009-01-02T08:06:00.000Z	ZellSF		how do I turn the wireless card OFF on my eeepc in ubuntu?
2009-01-02T08:06:00.000Z	ZellSF		I tried disabling it in the bios and ubuntu just turns it back on
2009-01-02T08:07:00.000Z	LaBlua	ZellSF	Trying to just disable networking through it, or actually power it down?
2009-01-02T08:07:00.000Z	LaBlua	ZellSF	Hmm, sorry, I dunno how to do that.
