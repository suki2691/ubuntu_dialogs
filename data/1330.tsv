2012-09-05T12:13:00.000Z	oldeagle		I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 in dual boot with W7. Now I want to make the Ubuntu partition larger, and thw W7 one much smaller (than I originally selected when installung U). Can I do this from within Ubuntu?

2012-09-05T12:15:00.000Z	oldeagle	ikonia	do you know what program I should use?
2012-09-05T12:15:00.000Z	oldeagle	ikonia	ok. Will try. Thanks!
