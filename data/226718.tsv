2006-07-06T06:01:00.000Z	Emilis		ubuntu installed boot manager on /dev/hdb (second hard drive), what should I do that when computer starts up it shouldn't automatically start up on first drive which is XP?
2006-07-06T06:02:00.000Z	Emilis		I tried looking in bios, but it didn't give me a choice, between hard disks...
2006-07-06T06:03:00.000Z	redguy	Emilis	you can make ubuntu boot from the windows bootloader too
2006-07-06T06:03:00.000Z	redguy	Emilis	but what devhen suggests is propably easier
