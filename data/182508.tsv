2007-05-21T10:44:00.000Z	xopey		hey guys, looking for help resuming from suspend. I get a black screen with a cursor that functions properly. I can generally restart X to get it to work. How do I get suspend to function properly
2007-05-21T10:46:00.000Z	xopey		thnx for responding PurpZeY, i've been doing my research, but none of the solutions seem to work suspending from resume
