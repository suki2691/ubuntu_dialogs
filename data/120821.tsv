2008-02-05T02:33:00.000Z	generalj_		anyone know a link where to check what the new linux-headers are adding/fixing before I update?
2008-02-05T02:34:00.000Z	noodlesgc	generalj_	just open update manager and you get a general list of changes
2008-02-05T02:35:00.000Z	generalj_	noodlesgc	I see I have some linux-headers updates available today but I dont know exactly what the updates are doing, the descriptions in them are jsut generic. Is there a site that shows a release or change log for these?
2008-02-05T02:36:00.000Z	noodlesgc	generalj_	just open System->Administration->Update Manager and open the 'changes' pane
