2010-02-21T08:01:00.000Z	[Adam|Linux]		How would I go about getting a wifi driver (STA Broadcom) so I can put it on a thumbdrive to install?
2010-02-21T08:02:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	[Adam|Linux]	you can't without grabbing all its dependencies
2010-02-21T08:03:00.000Z	[Adam|Linux]	psycho_oreos	I have another similar ubuntu laptop, is it possible to maybe copy the install of that driver or something?
2010-02-21T08:03:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	[Adam|Linux]	same kernel version? probably, but I wouldn't recommend it
