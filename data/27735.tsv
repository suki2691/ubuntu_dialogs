2010-08-17T08:34:00.000Z	Guest34267		I have a question
2010-08-17T08:35:00.000Z	Guest34267		I connected my evo 4g to my laptop running Ubuntu and it shows up in the disk utility but it will not show up on the desktop so I cannot access the files on it. How do I get it to show up on the desktop like normal? Thanks I am kind of new to ubuntu

2010-08-17T08:38:00.000Z	rocode	Guest34267	does it show up under "Computer" as a device?
