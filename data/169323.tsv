2011-02-08T03:13:00.000Z	Gump		yo, #ubuntu. since installing the automatic updates last night on ubuntu 10.10, my duel core CPU is running extremely hard while no processes are running. CPU 0 is pegging at 100%, and CPU 1 is ranging from 50-100%. the only process using any CPU power is system monitor. anyone else experiencing this?
2011-02-08T03:14:00.000Z	Gump		anyone got anything for me? my CPU is at 98* celcius right now :/
2011-02-08T03:15:00.000Z	Athenon	Gump	 new thermal compound or a new cooler?
2011-02-08T03:15:00.000Z	Athenon	Gump	 even at 100%, it shouldnt get THAT hot.
