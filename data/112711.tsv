2008-04-23T04:59:00.000Z	cirkit		For some reason when I now boot ubuntu, it will show the splashy but it will not boot into GDM, only straight into a terminal ...
2008-04-23T04:59:00.000Z	cirkit		any idea why GDM will no longer start at boot?
2008-04-23T05:00:00.000Z	DanikarPN	cirkit	Can you get gdm to start with /etc/init.d/gdm start ?
2008-04-23T05:02:00.000Z	DanikarPN	cirkit	Is it loading the rest of the way?
