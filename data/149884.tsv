2007-08-03T06:19:00.000Z	Subcontinental		question...I burnt the iso file to a CD just like the FAQ said, but my computer won't boot up the CD
2007-08-03T06:20:00.000Z	Pici	Subcontinental	Did you burn the iso to the CD as in the only file on the CD is the ubuntu.iso, or did you burn it as an image?
2007-08-03T06:21:00.000Z	Pici	Subcontinental	Not that I'm aware of.
