2008-09-15T08:26:00.000Z	Flam		Does EeeUbuntu work well for the 1000h model of Eee PC?
2008-09-15T08:27:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Flam	1000H has a hard drive, you shouldn't have to bother with cut-down stuff on it
2008-09-15T08:28:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja		3945 is fine, problem is likely between keyboard and chair :P
2008-09-15T08:29:00.000Z	Flam	LSD|Ninja	I want something that works well out of the box, that's the thing.  If Eeeubuntu is tailored for Eees and comes prepackaged with it's drivers - im happy
