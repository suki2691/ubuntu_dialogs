2011-11-26T15:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fgiw	i don't use it, so no uefi issue here
2011-11-26T16:02:00.000Z	fgiw	ActionParsnip	hmmm too bad, bu I should probably just not be using weird useless things like UEFI anyway
2011-11-26T16:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fgiw	its offtopic here, this is support only
