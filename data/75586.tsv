2011-03-22T22:37:00.000Z	Jemt		Hello. Where do Ubuntu store default settings for Firefox? Firefox is aware of the apt:// protocol, so either it was compiled with support for this, it is read from somewhere, or it is defined in a "defaults" configuration file

2011-03-22T22:38:00.000Z	ruan	Jemt	not really sure though
2011-03-22T22:38:00.000Z	Jemt	ruan	Thanks, but that's for a specific user. I need to find the "template" configuration used when a new user is created :)
