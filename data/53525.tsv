2010-11-02T17:30:00.000Z	cmyrland		Okay, I'm in dire need of help. I want to play Fallout New Vegas, but I simply cannot get the game to run. I've made a step-by-step list with what I've done, so if somebody could take a look at it and perhaps giveme some advice I'd appreciate it very much. Complete list of proceedings: http://pastebin.com/DiqH64Qx And yes, I've asked over at winehq too :)
