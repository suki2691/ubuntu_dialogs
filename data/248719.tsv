2005-02-19T06:02:00.000Z	|Jamie|		Hi guys. I'm having trouble getting my ubuntu box on the net. I think its a DNS problem, but cant sus it out, could anyone help?
2005-02-19T06:02:00.000Z	BiteMeBill	|Jamie|	is ifconfig showing an ipaddress?
2005-02-19T06:03:00.000Z	|Jamie|	BiteMeBill	not entirely sure. I'll check in a second. I can ping google.co.uk, but I cant visit it using a browser.. does that point anything out?
