2010-06-09T16:55:00.000Z	sinistrad	lapion	I read a little on it, and ext4 is faster for fsck from what I remember.
2010-06-09T16:57:00.000Z	sinistrad	lapion	Nice. I stuck with ext3, and hope I rarely need fsck again
2010-06-09T16:58:00.000Z	sinistrad	lapion	yes, it has to do with the amount of inodes too, but I'm not very well versed in the particulars.
