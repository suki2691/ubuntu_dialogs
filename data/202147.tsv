2006-04-16T09:34:00.000Z	Dissident		something strange just happened, when I click on Applications in the menu bar, the list appears for a split second then disappears.  Places and System work fine.  I haven't done anything recently so what's up?
2006-04-16T09:35:00.000Z	Dissident		how would I do that exactly?  I've already restarted gdm so I wouldn't think that would be it

2006-04-16T09:36:00.000Z	IdleOne	Dissident	hmm I dont know about that
