2006-08-06T14:19:00.000Z	stanwebber		i have a question about /etc/modules.  is modprobe or insmod used on the modules listed at boot time?
2006-08-06T14:20:00.000Z	Nameeater	stanwebber	I would guess modprobe as its mentioned under 'see also' in the man modules page :)
2006-08-06T14:22:00.000Z	stanwebber	Nameeater	is /etc/modules an appropriate place to use for my matrox framebuffer modules not loaded by hotplug?  is there someplace else?
2006-08-06T14:23:00.000Z	Nameeater	stanwebber	not a clue sorry!
