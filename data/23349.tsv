2010-11-01T01:09:00.000Z	Scunizi	galadude	are you shooting RAW format?
2010-11-01T01:10:00.000Z	galadude	Scunizi	nope

Eye of Gnome is built in and works fine.. if you have a lot of pics then I recommend trying digikam as your cataloging software, editing, touchup etc.. when shooting RAW then Darktable for initial non-distructive processing .
