2009-05-03T23:17:00.000Z	Dracofodder		hello, new Ubuntu user here... how do I tell where my app updates are coming from?  is there a preferred mirror to use?   also, same area.. the recommended security updates didn't complete (lost power) how do I restart that?  systems seems to be running fine, but I want all the latest updates applied.
2009-05-03T23:17:00.000Z	hwilde	Dracofodder	system->admin-> update manager
2009-05-03T23:17:00.000Z	Dracofodder	hwilde	thanks
2009-05-03T23:22:00.000Z	Dracofodder	hwilde	 does the update manager run at startup? or get a periodic check?  (like yast and zmd on SuSE?) or do I need to check that manually every once in a while to make sure I'm up to date on patches?
