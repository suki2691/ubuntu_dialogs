2008-04-15T17:15:00.000Z	wib		i'm trying to make some templates for nautilus. there used to be a temlate folder somewhere, but Go->Templates takes me to my home folder...

2008-04-15T17:17:00.000Z	wib	Pici	yes, i have a file "test.html" in there but it doesn't appear when i right-click->Create Document. it says "no templates installed"
2008-04-15T17:20:00.000Z	wib	Pici	i did so, no effect. "no templates installed"
