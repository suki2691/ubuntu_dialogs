2009-08-29T22:45:00.000Z	__8472		Hi, I have a question about the "Gnome Menu"(Applications, Places, System). is it possible to change somewhere to not to display the content of some category in just one column? Like e.g. in "Applications\Sound & Video" I have a really lot of stuff, and the only thing which I see is a plenty of items in only one column http://testujem.freeweb7.com/gnome_menu_full.jpg , and when I need something more, I must scroll down or up to find it
2009-08-29T22:45:00.000Z	__8472		. Is it possible to rearrange it somehow to display it side by side, in more columns without any scrolling? thx.
