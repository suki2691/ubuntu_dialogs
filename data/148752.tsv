2007-02-14T14:17:00.000Z	cryosphere		Im using xubuntu and when I tell it to reboot, it looks like it goes through almost all the step but in the end it cant move past the last screen (with the blue rat or whatever)
2007-02-14T14:18:00.000Z	dxdt	cryosphere	hmmm weird.  I would just press ctrl+alt+f1 if I were you.  Get to that console and then login and use the command sudo init 0
