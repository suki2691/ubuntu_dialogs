2007-01-02T06:28:00.000Z	gan|y|med		a friend of mine has a problem. he wants to start the kubuntu live-cd (dapper) on a notebook (the same that i have) and the cd seems not to be recognised during boot-up. the boot order is set up properly, the image is burned with nero. the same procedure works with me (same nb model) any ideas?

2007-01-02T06:29:00.000Z	phr34ck	gan|y|med	are you sure you bored the image correctly ?
