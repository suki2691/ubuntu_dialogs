2008-09-09T00:03:00.000Z	ill_phaze		So I've got a bit of a problem. The boot drive on my current machine is 'swappable' and I have two drives (one with xp and one with ubuntu). Last night, my xp drive decided to eat shit and die. This wasn't a huge problem because I just swapped it for the ubuntu drive. HOWEVER, now I can't access any of the NTFS partitions that I used to be able to access in ubuntu. It's saying that they were shut down wrong in windows and I need
