2006-05-23T12:04:00.000Z	sha_		for all problem of permission deied, I suggest to add youruser in root group and give the rights to the folder by a chmod 775 as a root user or by a sudo
2006-05-23T12:06:00.000Z	sha_		the chown cans make a problem if you dont allow root to access, with certain files
2006-05-23T12:07:00.000Z	sha_		for an admin it doesn't trouble
2006-05-23T12:08:00.000Z	RandolphCarter	sha_	put them in the admin group, but don't make a user root :/
