2009-11-13T00:37:00.000Z	Fishscene		So no one here uses WINE 1.1.32 on Ubuntu 9.10?
2009-11-13T00:39:00.000Z	Fishscene		Parsnip: Yes, I can download and install that easily. However, I need to test MS Office 2007 with Wine 1.1.32 (Wine 1.0.1 does not work).
2009-11-13T00:39:00.000Z	Fishscene		Or is there a WINE channel I can go to ask these questions?
