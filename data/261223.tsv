2005-02-27T16:26:00.000Z	blah09		anyone know what might be causing that? nvidia drivers?
2005-02-27T16:27:00.000Z	kent	blah09	i had that problem before. It was fixed later though. Perhaps you need to upgrade again? (slow mirror?)
2005-02-27T16:29:00.000Z	kent	blah09	it worked for me when i upgraded again later on. Do you use a mirror for ubuntu?
