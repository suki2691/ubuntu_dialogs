2009-09-02T20:39:00.000Z	yaaar		hey guys, i'm having trouble installing 8.04 LTS on a Dell PowerEdge T105 (quad-core opteron). it boots the cd and asks me for language/keyboard, but then it says the installation cd couldn't be mounted. i've dropped to a shell and attempted to mount it manually but i get 'invalid argument'
2009-09-02T20:40:00.000Z	yaaar		anybody know how i can work around that? i tried some of the kernel options mentioned in the help screen, but without effect. i'm not 100% that I was putting them in right
2009-09-02T20:40:00.000Z	roygbiv	yaaar	maybe a bad cd? burn a new one and see what happens
2009-09-02T20:41:00.000Z	yaaar	roygbiv	i've tried it with two different discs burned from two different computers. also, when i was at the shell i put in a random data cd and it wouldn't mount that either
