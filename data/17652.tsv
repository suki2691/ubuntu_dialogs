2011-02-26T07:33:00.000Z	the_seraphim		vague much?
2011-02-26T07:34:00.000Z	[segfault]	the_seraphim	so your vnc client is crashing?
2011-02-26T07:35:00.000Z	[segfault]	the_seraphim	make sure the client is using the same encoding, for starters.. also make sure no ports are blocked on the client, though i don't see that being an issue if you can authenticate.
2011-02-26T07:37:00.000Z	[segfault]	the_seraphim	probably hextile, but i have never had problems with vnc on any of my systems, so i'm at a bit of a loss.  would love to help more, but i gotta run. night all
