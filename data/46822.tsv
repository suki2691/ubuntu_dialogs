2009-09-28T23:49:00.000Z	ptarrant		Question: does anyone know of a good way to graph HD information? preferably to a PHP page? I wanna monitor my HD health on my home server (besides webmin)
2009-09-28T23:50:00.000Z	ptarrant		clarification to that would be a table for instance that shows HDtemp info, and disk usage

2009-09-28T23:52:00.000Z	ptarrant	genii	thanks, I'll look into that im not too scared of make install :)
