2007-08-14T07:54:00.000Z	Falstius	kkek	you could do it with a custom udev rule, I think.
2007-08-14T07:55:00.000Z	kkek	Falstius	I'm fairly new to linux... any idea what the udev rule would look like?
2007-08-14T08:04:00.000Z	Falstius	kkek	udev rules are fairly cryptic and I haven't played with it in a few years.  You'd have to google it.
