2011-03-05T23:44:00.000Z	iCyrus		How do I unrar something? I could have sworn it was just unrar filename
2011-03-05T23:44:00.000Z	iCyrus		But it's saying I have to use commands
2011-03-05T23:44:00.000Z	iCyrus		So I tried rar -e Filename and it's still not working :[
2011-03-05T23:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	iCyrus	unrar x filename
