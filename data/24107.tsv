2010-10-14T06:24:00.000Z	mgmuscari	ka1ser	thanks... any idea what the package name for the arm version of libc is?
2010-10-14T06:25:00.000Z	mgmuscari	ka1ser	i'm actually already using devkitpro - but i need to get at some of the libc stuff that isn't included in it (specifically sys/select.h, maybe some others...)
2010-10-14T06:30:00.000Z	ka1ser	mgmuscari	just give codesourcery a try... we use it at TI all the time without problems... it has libc and everything
