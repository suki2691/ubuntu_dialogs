2010-12-25T18:49:00.000Z	noms		Hey folks, I wonder if anyone could help me with a problem I have?
2010-12-25T18:51:00.000Z	noms		My USB Ports on my old Laptop have decided to stop working after I did a bios update. In Wnidows it states that there are not enough system resources (Code 12) and in Ubuntu it's not recognising ANY usb devices plugged in, so I assume it's a problem with the BIOS not assigning the ports the right IRQs or something. Can anyone help?
