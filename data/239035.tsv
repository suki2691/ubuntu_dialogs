2005-04-30T07:32:00.000Z	_maney		Q: Xchat says emacs edit mode can be set through Preferences/Keyboard Shortcuts, but that doesn't seem to exist any more (Hoary).  Any clues where I can enable this?
2005-04-30T07:32:00.000Z	marcin_ant	_maney	you mean emacs mode keyboard shortcuts in gnome?
2005-04-30T07:33:00.000Z	_maney	marcin_ant	guess so.  I've never needed to set it by hand before
2005-04-30T07:35:00.000Z	_maney	marcin_ant	hah, that was it!  thanks!
