2005-05-26T09:40:00.000Z	digip1mp	xim	yeah - I used Gentoo to throw myself into using open source...
2005-05-26T09:40:00.000Z	digip1mp	xim	I still think it's easiest to maintain apache servers that need special modules or configs on Gentoo
2005-05-26T09:42:00.000Z	xim	digip1mp	the lack of reverse dependencies makes Gentoo risky on servers, IMHO
