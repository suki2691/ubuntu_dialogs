2008-12-09T02:29:00.000Z	rio		hi im trying to use networkmanager to manage my eth0, but it says "device not managed"
2008-12-09T02:30:00.000Z	rio		and the network lists shows "Ifupdown (eth0)" which is readlonly

2008-12-09T02:31:00.000Z	rio	enzotib	just deleted everything related to eth0 in the interface sfile
