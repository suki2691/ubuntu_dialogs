2009-07-31T02:34:00.000Z	Magnets		I am using a fresh install of ubuntu 9.04, using tightvnc (vncserver) but gnome has a different appearance when i login to VNC, it looks "old"/grey/has a 1 px shadow/stroke around all edges etc

2009-07-31T02:49:00.000Z	th0r	Magnets	is the vnc gnome using the same theme your desktop is using?
2009-07-31T02:51:00.000Z	th0r	Magnets	right...I misunderstood your problem
