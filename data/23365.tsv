2011-02-25T01:06:00.000Z	nha	photofroggy	perhaps it simply overwrote the boot loader?
2011-02-25T01:06:00.000Z	photofroggy	nha	That's what I thought, but I can't find the partition as a drive when using the LiveCD
2011-02-25T01:06:00.000Z	photofroggy	nha	If I have found it there are no files on here...
