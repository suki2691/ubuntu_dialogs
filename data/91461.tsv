2008-10-13T03:11:00.000Z	anabolix		i just installed ubuntu, and now i dont have any option on the top of all my menus to maximize minimize and close... any clue how to get them back anyone?
2008-10-13T03:11:00.000Z	jspiro	anabolix	that's really odd.  When did the option disappear?
2008-10-13T03:12:00.000Z	anabolix	jspiro	right after i installed a theme beryl/emerald and compiz... some where around that time
2008-10-13T03:40:00.000Z	jspiro	anabolix	what did you do to make it disappear?
