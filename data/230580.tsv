2006-04-09T15:29:00.000Z	devnull_		is there some special debian way of installing a kernel ?
2006-04-09T15:30:00.000Z	devnull_		well i did make && make modules_install && make install and it seemed to not install any of the modules in the correct place
2006-04-09T15:30:00.000Z	devnull_		and i have linux-headers and linux-sources directories and /usr/src/linux points to a headers directory
2006-04-09T15:32:00.000Z	dabaR	devnull_	yes, a very special debian way.
