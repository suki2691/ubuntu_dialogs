2006-10-13T11:49:00.000Z	Borden		Question to the group - is everyone's Rhythmbox working correctly on Dapper?
2006-10-13T11:50:00.000Z	Borden		... cuz when I run Rhythmbox now it segfaults just after it opens - it didn't used to do that

2006-10-13T11:51:00.000Z	ThomasM	Borden	then why worry about rhythmbox?
