2006-09-21T09:52:00.000Z	Slynderdale		I have a question, I just created a live CD of Ubuntu. Could I use this CD to create a dual boot of an already existing windows XP install and Ubuntu?

2006-09-21T09:53:00.000Z	variant	Slynderdale	how much you got? not less than 6gb to stay comfertable
2006-09-21T09:54:00.000Z	variant	Slynderdale	my /boot is 32mb.. never run out of space in five years of compiling my own kernels
