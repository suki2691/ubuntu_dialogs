2009-05-14T05:22:00.000Z	shauns		I want to automate UBUNTU install using PXE for my company, roll out about 50 or so machines. Does anyone know of a good step by step article that may help me with this? I am no Ubuntu expert but I have a couple of years support experience so I am not a newbie either.
