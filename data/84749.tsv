2009-02-01T22:17:00.000Z	olimpico		Can someone tell me if the update from 8.04.1 to 8.04.2 happens automatically if I "apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade" ?
2009-02-01T22:18:00.000Z	jtaji	olimpico	or even just apt-get upgrade... it's not like a normal distro release
2009-02-01T22:19:00.000Z	jtaji	olimpico	so the answer is yes, if I wasn't clear ;)
2009-02-01T22:28:00.000Z	olimpico	jtaji	thanks a lot!
