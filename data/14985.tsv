2011-04-28T18:13:00.000Z	pioruns_		Hi guys. I wanted to report an issue: when I boot Ubuntu 11.04, it stops loading. And doing nothing, until I press ENTER. It happen on boot screen (this bronze background, and nothing else, even Ubuntu logo). Where I should report it, which package to report (Launchpad?). I'm using Nvidia proprietary driver. Can somebody answer me please?

2011-04-28T18:15:00.000Z	pioruns_	konaya	how to disable it? splash off or something, in GRUB?
2011-04-28T18:16:00.000Z	konaya	pioruns_	I don't know the exact procedure. Worse, I'm on my way out. Google it and/or get help from someone else. I think I pushed you in the right direction, though
