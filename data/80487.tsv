2008-09-05T16:55:00.000Z	coozier		I wanted to ask an ot question here on the basis that it was answered last time for me and I've forgotten the answer now. When I use firefox with Adblock and Noscript it stops googlereader working correctly, but there is asimple fix which someone was good enough to tell me last time I was here. I'm really hoping the same person is around which is a big ask because it was awhile ago but here goes!
