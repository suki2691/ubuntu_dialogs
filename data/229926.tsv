2006-03-26T11:32:00.000Z	ruggy		is there a version of ubuntu that has all multimedia options(codecs,players,dvd playing, eitc..) enabled on install?
2006-03-26T11:32:00.000Z	tristanmike	ruggy	no
2006-03-26T11:33:00.000Z	tristanmike	ruggy	and there will never be one
2006-03-26T11:33:00.000Z	tristanmike	ruggy	because Ubuntu's founding principle is that it and all it's software is 100% free
