2011-11-12T00:57:00.000Z	blind		Running 11.10 and my wireless keeps cutting out, I can only assume because /dev/sda1 (where / is) is remounting itself. At that point, my wireless says it's connected, but no internet connection, I have to turn wireless off/on for it to work.. dmesg: http://pastebin.com/cRiAXAcT

2011-11-12T01:01:00.000Z	blind	denny	no, mount still lists it as rw
2011-11-12T01:02:00.000Z	denny	blind	oddness.  Nothing to suggest, sorry!
