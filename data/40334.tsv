2012-04-29T15:22:00.000Z	Atlantic777		Is there a recommended way for installing Java, JRE, icedtea and everything I need to run a java applet in the browser?
2012-04-29T15:23:00.000Z	jongbergs	Atlantic777	I would recommend using Oracle Java SDK
2012-04-29T15:23:00.000Z	jongbergs	Atlantic777	as it know to work on most web applets
2012-04-29T15:24:00.000Z	Atlantic777	jongbergs	I've seen some PPAs and stuff, is there something official or just to install the SDK from oracle website?
