2009-04-25T05:51:00.000Z	Ventero		Anyone has an idea how to make my gnome panel to start up automatically again (as it should do)?
2009-04-25T05:52:00.000Z	Steffy	Ventero	check System -> Preferences -> Sessions and see if "gnome-panel" is there?
2009-04-25T05:53:00.000Z	Ventero	Steffy	Does it have to be there? I thought it should get started as part of the default gnome-session
2009-04-25T05:53:00.000Z	Steffy	Ventero	good point.
