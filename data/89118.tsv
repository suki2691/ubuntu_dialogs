2008-06-18T08:33:00.000Z	glitsj16	flouge1	have you gone over your /boot/grub/menu.lst manually to check if there's something out of the ordinary ?
2008-06-18T08:51:00.000Z	glitsj16	flouge1	have you considered chroot'ing and reinstalling grub that way ? it's some work i realize that, but seems like something you can try before sledgehammering (i know how frustrating grub errors can be)
