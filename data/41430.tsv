2010-04-23T02:47:00.000Z	dmichel1		im editing grub and i'm trying to get a list of my disk drives in the format of ' rootnoverify (hd0,0)', because my 'other' is windows, and i'd like to switch which hard drive windows boots from, but i dont know which one it is
2010-04-23T02:47:00.000Z	dmichel1		how do i list my disk drives in that format, and not the partitions
