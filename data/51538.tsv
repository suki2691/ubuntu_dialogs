2009-11-21T19:15:00.000Z	Micheil	livingdaylight_	well, really you could put the wallpapers in /usr/share/backgrounds, just like fonts, although, if you ever need to reinstall, you need to remember where those files are, and make sure you don't forghet them
2009-11-21T19:16:00.000Z	livingdaylight_	Micheil	that's a good point
