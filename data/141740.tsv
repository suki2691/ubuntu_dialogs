2007-10-22T16:56:00.000Z	auowE		I installed Gutsy.  When I trying to enable dma through hdparm, I am getting message - HDIO_SET_DMA failed.  I thought it would be fixed with the release as it existed in beta.
2007-10-22T16:56:00.000Z	auowE		How can I resolve this.  the performance is really bad.
2007-10-22T16:56:00.000Z	chowmeined	auowE	what kind of drive is it?
2007-10-22T16:57:00.000Z	chowmeined	auowE	i mean the chipset.. have you poked around on ubuntuforums.org ?
