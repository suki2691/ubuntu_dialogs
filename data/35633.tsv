2010-03-29T00:45:00.000Z	Demiurge		Hi. Trying to download to ntfs volumes using azureus on karmic. Latest ntfs-3g as well. But I get "Disk read error - flush fails, write fails, operation not supported" every time. Thing is I can save files to these volumes using f.ex. cp in terminal. Anyone familiar with this?
