2008-11-19T00:17:00.000Z	fde	dhiraj	ikonia probably actually means tsclient though, which is a frontend for rdesktop ... rdp by the way is the Windows remote desktop protocol.
2008-11-19T00:18:00.000Z	fde	dhiraj	tsclient also handles vnc ... so its nice, still haven't figured out why Ubuntu now also installs a stand-alone vnc client along with tsclient
2008-11-19T00:19:00.000Z	fde	dhiraj	that depends on Ubuntu version....
