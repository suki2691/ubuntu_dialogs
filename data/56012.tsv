2011-03-27T22:59:00.000Z	hendrixski		How can I view static files in apache subdirectories of /var/www
2011-03-27T23:00:00.000Z	mkanyicy	hendrixski	you mean /var/www?
2011-03-27T23:01:00.000Z	hendrixski	mkanyicy	yep, I made a directory in /var/www/ of just static .html files and I want to view them in a VM running IE8 ... and yeah...
