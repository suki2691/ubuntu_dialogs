2012-02-17T17:49:00.000Z	crality		Hello. Is there an easy way of getting GCC 4.7.0 for Ubuntu 11.10?
2012-02-17T17:51:00.000Z	Younder	crality	yes, install the source in /usr/local/src and build it ./configure then make and make install. That should put it in /usr/local/bin which superseder /usr/bin
