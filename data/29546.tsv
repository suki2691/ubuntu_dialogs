2010-07-02T03:11:00.000Z	bbscr		I wanted to install 64bit Ubuntu on my i7 box, but Ubuntu download page says that it's "not recommended for daily desktop usage". Are there any open problems, like Flash or such?

2010-07-02T03:15:00.000Z	bbscr	VCoolio	Thanks for the info. My 32bit installed PAE kernel by default (since I have 6Gb RAM), and I'm seeing memory errors now and then, and I'm guessing 64 bit would fix it. Always had problems with PAE kernels, bad karma or something :)
