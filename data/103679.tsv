2011-02-10T00:23:00.000Z	warlock		I have a question about raid i plan on running 4 1Tb hard drives will i have any issue doing so under Ubuntu.
2011-02-10T00:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	warlock	how will the raid be connected? using a hardware card or crappy fakeraid
2011-02-10T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	warlock	so fakeraid :(   should be ok
2011-02-10T00:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	warlock	makes it faster but some cards can be a pain, for cheap easy raid, softraid is fine.For anything under any sort of strain i'd advise a card
