2009-11-26T02:08:00.000Z	mars		Hi everyone, I just found a workaround for the "General error mounting filesystems" bug that prevents you from using the recovery console.  However, I don't know what package I should file the bug report in Launchpad against.  Can anyone help?

2009-11-26T02:13:00.000Z	mars	epinky	thanks.  I read that thread, but couldn't say for sure if it was mountall.  Think I should just file it there and let Scott decide?
2009-11-26T02:14:00.000Z	epinky	mars	yep great idea :)
