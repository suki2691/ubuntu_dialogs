2008-10-17T01:27:00.000Z	RandyboY		How can i remove the password input when i login? Guess its called key ring or something. Ive set my machine to atomaticly login and i dont want to have to type a password for the machine to login on my wireless network. This laptop is only on one/my wireless net so if i want to move my laptop ill just turn off autologin... How to fix this?
