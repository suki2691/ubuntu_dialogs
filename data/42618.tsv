2012-05-03T08:48:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	footvilla	like a routine or just a one off?
2012-05-03T08:49:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	footvilla	have you heard of clonezilla?
2012-05-03T08:50:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	footvilla	then you'll need something bigger than/equal to 256gb then. clonezilla can do a full disk or full partition backup
