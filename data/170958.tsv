2006-08-21T13:15:00.000Z	shaantanu		hey ppl ... I  getting an error called no FSINFO sector found not automatically creating it while boot up. This happens when the system is checking all filesystems. Although my system starts normally after that, but still its irritating. I am having all my partitions in FAT32 or NTFS (except the linux part ofcourse). Somebody help me
