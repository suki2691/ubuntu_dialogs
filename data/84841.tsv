2008-09-27T22:16:00.000Z	Riyonuk		the specs are --> 128MB NVIDIA® GeForce 8400M GS
2008-09-27T22:18:00.000Z	Riyonuk		Guess I'll rephrase my question since I have the specs. Will this video card be good with compiz fusion? I want it snappy, just the cube effect :) --> 128MB NVIDIA® GeForce™ 8400M GS
