2010-01-06T23:09:00.000Z	alazyworkaholic		I need to transcribe a lot of audio. Does anyone know of a way to get a linux audio player to replay slowly so that I don't have to keep pressing play/pause?

2010-01-06T23:10:00.000Z	alazyworkaholic	militant	didn't know about that. Thank you! :D
2010-01-06T23:10:00.000Z	militant	alazyworkaholic	there's probably similar options in .... nvm
