2010-11-07T09:27:00.000Z	maco	Baram	assuming you do a swapon before trying to hibernate, right
2010-11-07T09:27:00.000Z	Baram		some_person: no such thing... that's like saying I have too many monitors
2010-11-07T09:27:00.000Z	Baram	maco	that's what I thought, for some reason half of the raid array (the swap one) didn't activate, want to swap off so I can attempt a remount
