2006-06-30T10:17:00.000Z	revilot		I want to dual boot xp / ubuntu.  Should I first make a fat 32 partition before installing ubuntu, or is it best to do that afterwards?
2006-06-30T10:19:00.000Z	jme	revilot	you have xp on the system already?
2006-06-30T10:19:00.000Z	jme		you can create a fat32 partition during the ubuntu install if you like
2006-06-30T10:20:00.000Z	revilot	jme	the partition manager it uses is confusing to me
