2006-01-12T16:31:00.000Z	Mabus06		I have a cd image file (CDI) that is 775MB... but it's supposed to fit on a 700MB cd... am I missing something?

2006-01-12T16:33:00.000Z	Mabus06	CodenameKT	but I have several CDI files and they're all larger than 700MB... ?
2006-01-12T16:34:00.000Z	CodenameKT	Mabus06	then logic permits us to think that maybe the people making these images know that u have a 700mb disk and made it accordingly. I don't believe u will have a problem burning. I don't know the CDI format so It could be a couple mb is bloat and won't even be burned to the cd
