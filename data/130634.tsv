2007-08-28T06:42:00.000Z	bobbob1016		How can I download sequential files with wget, as in file01, file02, file03, and so on?
2007-08-28T06:43:00.000Z	jessie_	bobbob1016	well, try something like "wget http:\\placetofilesfile0?.nameofextension"
2007-08-28T06:44:00.000Z	bobbob1016	jessie_	I tried ? and * for the wildcard, and no luck, it's only 8 files, I'll do them one at a time
2007-08-28T06:44:00.000Z	jessie_	bobbob1016	oh... good to know.
