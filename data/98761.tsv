2008-05-21T18:13:00.000Z	Sinnerman		hi people. how would i go about converting a .mdf/.mds CD image file into ISO on ubuntu gutsy?
2008-05-21T18:13:00.000Z	AnRkey	Sinnerman	have you tried opening it in brasero?
2008-05-21T18:14:00.000Z	Sinnerman	AnRkey	yes i have, and it appears not to want to load it up. Dr_willis i will check that out - that would save me some overhead.
2008-05-21T18:15:00.000Z	AnRkey	Sinnerman	I have moved all my images to ISO. I feel your pain...
