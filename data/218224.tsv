2005-09-22T16:37:00.000Z	prentice		I currently have two screens. On the second, I remove all panels, and everything is great until I logout/login again. Gnome rebuilds the default panels for the screen. Is there a way to disable this?
2005-09-22T16:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	prentice	have you tried save current session in the log out dialog?
2005-09-22T16:41:00.000Z	prentice	erUSUL	good idea, but it didn't work.
2005-09-22T16:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	prentice	i don't have to manitros so...
