2009-04-26T09:26:00.000Z	dooner	dooglus	does wubi use the Windows NT bootloader?
2009-04-26T09:26:00.000Z	dooglus	dooner	I believe so.  how's that configed?
2009-04-26T09:27:00.000Z	dooner	dooglus	there is a boot.ini file I think you can edit it from the System Thing in control panel and muck with the order (but I don't really have any windows machines...)
