2007-04-26T08:47:00.000Z	grem		I downloaded a game, Warsow, that comes in .tar.gz. I just extract it and play it. But where should I place those files? Is there a 'correct' place? It's kinda confusing for me to extract the game in my ~ dir
2007-04-26T08:48:00.000Z	grem		it comes in binary
2007-04-26T08:49:00.000Z	grem		ah
