2010-02-20T03:20:00.000Z	thevor		Hey I am having trouble updating. Anytime I try to update I get an error message related to Cairo dock, which is no longer installed on my computer. This is the error message: http://www.pastebin.org/94239   Does anyone have any ideas?

2010-02-20T03:21:00.000Z	thevor		is that "gedit" ?
2010-02-20T03:21:00.000Z	idespinner	thevor	remove the cairo repository
