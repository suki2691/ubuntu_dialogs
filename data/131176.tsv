2008-03-13T15:31:00.000Z	pajamian	khalid	you mean to just access a network share from nautilus or mount it to use it in applications?
2008-03-13T15:34:00.000Z	pajamian	khalid	you need to install the smbfs package
2008-03-13T15:35:00.000Z	pajamian	khalid	and you can use that to mount samba shares off a windows computer
