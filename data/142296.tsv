2007-03-24T15:25:00.000Z	ravi_master	rasputnik	that's true, I acknowledge that but people who take a specified problem like xtknight's and generalize it to a whole class of "64-bit processors" is just wrong.
2007-03-24T15:25:00.000Z	rasputnik	ravi_master	you say you can switch easily between 32 and 64 bit. that's only true if you have both 32 and 64 bit libraries (and binaries) installed.
2007-03-24T15:26:00.000Z	ravi_master	rasputnik	when I speak about the switch I mean the hardware, it's very much a hardware-centric task, I mean, you're essentially talking about having 32-wires going out and in to your cpu and 32 more wires for 64 bit.
