My system is currently up to date but when I check for available updates the option to download the new distribution isn't presented.
2010-02-21T22:38:00.000Z	jacko		Anyone come across this issue before?
2010-02-21T22:40:00.000Z	ori_	jacko	u need to change the settings of the uplad manager
2010-02-21T22:40:00.000Z	jacko	ori_	I thought that too and changed the settings a few times but still no luck. Maybe I missed something in there...
