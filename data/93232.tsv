2010-11-10T01:11:00.000Z	Guest11856		i've got 4 desktops in lan ( all with ubuntu ), each of PCs has a hard drive with about 500gb disk space - where actually only ~20GB is used... now i'm thinking about creating some separate partitions on each of them, and mount as one big lan disk... is it possible? :D
2010-11-10T01:12:00.000Z	Guest11856		any one ?
