2012-05-18T22:16:00.000Z	ChocolateMInht		I'm having an issue where after trying to login (entering the username/password correctly), i hear the login noise, the screen flashes, and then it dumps me back to the login page. I took a look at the /var/log/Xorg.0.log but I don't see anything in there about X crashing
