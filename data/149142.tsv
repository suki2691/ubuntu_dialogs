2009-04-19T22:17:00.000Z	mr_daniel		I hope someone with good bash and make skills can help me to answer what is the purpose of '@$<' ?
2009-04-19T22:18:00.000Z	unop	mr_daniel	doesn't look like bash .. can you show us the line that has this?
2009-04-19T22:21:00.000Z	unop	mr_daniel	have a look here http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Automatic-Variables  if you don't find it here, try asking in #workingset
