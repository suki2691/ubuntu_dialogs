2011-02-13T06:19:00.000Z	Noobuntu		I just got back from resetting my system and... I think whoever said the crashes might be related to flash I think they were right
2011-02-13T06:20:00.000Z	Noobuntu		Although.. I can't have my browser crashing everytime I go on a site that uses flash
2011-02-13T06:21:00.000Z	soreau	Noobuntu	That's not good.. did you install flash?
2011-02-13T06:29:00.000Z	soreau	Noobuntu	Well all I can suggest is to remove flashplugin-nonfree package for now and see how things go. Some sites like youtube are leaning toward html5 these days
