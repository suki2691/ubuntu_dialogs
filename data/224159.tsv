2008-05-08T15:32:00.000Z	MaseX		Ikonia: So.. I installed Ubuntu's previous version a few weeks ago and it ended up locking up my system on a blank screen. Is this some sort of video problem?
2008-05-08T15:33:00.000Z	MaseX		I have an AMD Athlon 4400+ X2.. can I still use the regular installation?
2008-05-08T15:33:00.000Z	emma	MaseX	yes I believe so.
2008-05-08T15:34:00.000Z	emma	MaseX	I also have an Athlong and it works for me. In fact, I have often been told that running the 32 bit version is probably better for most users.
