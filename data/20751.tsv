2011-01-09T09:44:00.000Z	dreamz		hey everyone, I'm trying to compile a program called quore. I get this error while running ./configure: checking for XF86MiscGetMouseSettings in -lXxf86misc... no
2011-01-09T09:44:00.000Z	dreamz		configure: error: missing xf86misc library
2011-01-09T09:44:00.000Z	k4r1m	dreamz	looks like the package is missing a library?
2011-01-09T09:46:00.000Z	dreamz	k4r1m	I've tried searching but I cant find the package. Could it be that im using an x64 system?
