2006-06-02T13:42:00.000Z	Phlexonance	mlehrer	I had winXP and Suse on a system and installed ubuntu, afterwards when booting winXP I get the error that the <windows root>\system32\hal.dll is missing but it is there, I already have replaced it with a new one but it still keeps saying that, I guess it cant find the real windows root directory or something like that. does anyone know this problem and what the real cause is? something with the bootloader
