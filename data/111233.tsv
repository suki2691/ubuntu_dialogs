2011-10-18T14:43:00.000Z	Technicus		Hello I just installed Ubuntu 11.04 and I have attempting to configure the ati video drivers, but I am clearly doing this improperly.
2011-10-18T14:43:00.000Z	Technicus		I have tried following the Ubuntu wiki: < https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/FglrxInteferesWithRadeonDriver > and installing the X updates ppa: < https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-updates >.  Yet none of my attempts have yielded any successful configurations, rather exactly the opposite and continuing to degrade.
2011-10-18T14:43:00.000Z	Technicus		Please share guide me so that I can correct this arrangement.
