2009-05-01T21:06:00.000Z	archman		PLEASE, why can't i access myspace on whichever browser I try? It works on my other computer, but not here on ubuntu. It's definitely something to do with linux, any, any ideas please???

2009-05-01T21:07:00.000Z	archman	Saiki	what plugin?  I could access it in the morning? btw, i've tried it with opera also...
