2011-05-20T09:16:00.000Z	BLZbubba		it looks like the old way to turn it off is gone
2011-05-20T09:16:00.000Z	devourer09	BLZbubba	I'm tempted to say 'killall compiz' but I wouldn't do that.
2011-05-20T09:17:00.000Z	BLZbubba	devourer09	i definitely want to kill it, it is annoying.  but need the other one back; is it still metacity?
