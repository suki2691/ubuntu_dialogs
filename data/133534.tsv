2007-09-06T08:44:00.000Z	faileas	SpudDogg	you probably can't
2007-09-06T08:46:00.000Z	SpudDogg	faileas	i've heard of people running linux and installing XP via VMWare to play games, etc.  problem is, games will never run without the acceleration.  thanks though...i'll keep looking
2007-09-06T08:50:00.000Z	SpudDogg	faileas	after searching around some more, you are correct...you cannot utilize a graphics card on the host to the guest.  thanks again
