2010-10-18T14:34:00.000Z	Sh4wn		Ok guys, strange thing: I can't visit djangoproject.com on this computer with firefox. wget works, ping works, on my other laptop through the same router works, only firefox refuses to load djangoproject.com.
2010-10-18T14:34:00.000Z	Sh4wn		Anyone got an idea why?
2010-10-18T14:35:00.000Z	slidinghorn	Sh4wn	 what exactly happens when you try to load the site in FF?
2010-10-18T14:37:00.000Z	Sh4wn	slidinghorn	it says for a very long time "Waiting for djangoproject.com" and the progressbar remains empty
