2009-12-09T11:26:00.000Z	JavaAtom		Any suggestions for getting wpa_supplicant to run only when I tell it to?
2009-12-09T11:26:00.000Z	b0nn	JavaAtom	Ive never used wpa_supplicant, what does it offer ytou?
2009-12-09T11:27:00.000Z	JavaAtom	b0nn	It's what controls wifi WPA/WPA2 authentication. It's built in and currenlty responds to the DBUS interface, but I'm trying to set it up so I can actually control my wifi from the command line.
2009-12-09T11:30:00.000Z	b0nn	JavaAtom	is it in /etc/init.d/?
