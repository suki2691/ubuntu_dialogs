2011-08-16T14:11:00.000Z	Niche	urlin2u	my pc restarted and now I am unable to boot windows or linux. It just says Grub and tells me to press Tab
2011-08-16T14:13:00.000Z	urlin2u	Niche	first you are going to have to open the bios and put the sdb hd before the others for this to work. To be honest for me it is 3:13 am I need to crash, so others may be able to help.

2011-08-16T14:14:00.000Z	urlin2u	Niche	this is any easy fix If I was there about 5 min work, but on the web with a new user this could take awhile, I need to sleep.
