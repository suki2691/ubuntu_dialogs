2008-11-09T11:21:00.000Z	cmdbbq		i am making a compilation cd and i want to normalize the volume for all the tracks so i don't have to keep reaching for the volume knob; how can i do this either with brasero or through another program
2008-11-09T11:22:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	cmdbbq	I use the program named "mp3gain"

2008-11-09T11:29:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	cmdbbq	No problem. Look at the man page. There are a few ways of using it. If you just say mp3gain, it scans the file and adjusts on the ID3 tag. There are ways of forcing it to re-encode the file. Man page will help you further
