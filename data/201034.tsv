2006-01-13T14:44:00.000Z	freak_	CentHOGG	wireless in linux is sketchy, you're better off going wired
2006-01-13T14:45:00.000Z	CentHOGG	freak_	so it's not possible?
2006-01-13T14:46:00.000Z	freak_	CentHOGG	it is, but it may take lots and lots of tweaking, but ubuntu usually autoconfigures what it can, you can try another distro, recompile the kernel with the correct modules, or tweak like hell, heh
