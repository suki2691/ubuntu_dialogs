2006-11-01T12:17:00.000Z	dnite		Edgy is freezing up on random. Mouse still moves, but nothing responds to it. Keyboard seems to do nothing. This usually happens while using Firefox, the last messages i see in the log after I hard reset the machine are 'Buffer I/O Error on device sde1, logical block 1708' 'lost page write due to I/O error on sde1' 'REISERFS: about (device sde1): Journal write error in flush_commit_list' ... any help???
