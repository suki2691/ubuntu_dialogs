2011-12-27T06:17:00.000Z	metaspike	fbdystang	that version is really outdated, get a 10.04 kubuntu release for greater satisfaction
2011-12-27T06:20:00.000Z	fbdystang	metaspike	thanks but it has to be 8.10 for linuxmce, I just don't know why it hangs
2011-12-27T06:22:00.000Z	metaspike	fbdystang	neither do I, but I can tell you that it isn't supported anymore
