2005-09-09T07:42:00.000Z	kanrinin		thanks reiki...what about the gnome support package?
2005-09-09T07:43:00.000Z	reiki	kanrinin	I just did sudo apt-get install mozilla-firefox and it all worked
2005-09-09T07:44:00.000Z	reiki	kanrinin	And I'm in a pretty much default Ubuntu 5.04 install. So ... should be pretty easy :)
