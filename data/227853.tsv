2005-07-15T08:45:00.000Z	dk0r		Anyone know what dir I can find the "XF86Config-4" file on the ubuntu live cd? Or better yet, does anyone have a working XFree86 config for a 17" G4 Powerbook (ati)?  Cant get my display working & I think the values for my HorizSync nd VertSync parameters are incorrect.
2005-07-15T08:46:00.000Z	dk0r		any help for dk0r?
