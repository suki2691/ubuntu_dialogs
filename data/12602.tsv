2011-07-09T02:00:00.000Z	demox		i got an atom n450, why is wubi downloading a amd64 and not a i386?
2011-07-09T02:02:00.000Z	trism	demox	the atom n450 supports 64 bit (I use amd64 on my n455, although I've never used wubi)
2011-07-09T02:03:00.000Z	demox	trism	is there any downside on using amd64 and not 32bit with a netbook?
2011-07-09T02:03:00.000Z	trism	demox	I haven't had any issues
