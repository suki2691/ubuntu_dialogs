2011-02-21T01:51:00.000Z	Ganymede		Speaking of pagers, I use less. I'd like the ability to search with wraparound (/ and ? apparently don't wrap around) AND so that when I jump to the next match, it places it at the center of the screen and not at the top so I can see before and after. Any ideas?
2011-02-21T01:52:00.000Z	abstrakt	Ganymede	but are there other options available for pagers other than more or less
2011-02-21T01:52:00.000Z	Ganymede	abstrakt	Yeah, I'm open to others...I heard about "most" but i don't recall it's featureset off hand...
2011-02-21T01:53:00.000Z	Ganymede	abstrakt	The most pager web site leaves much to be desired.
