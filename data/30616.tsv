2010-06-06T00:27:00.000Z	Warlord		Hi, I'm using ubuntu 10.04 with the latest offical nvidia drivers and well, I'm getting video tear movie players like vlc, mplayer etc.. I tried few guides and here was one: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/01/how-to-stop-video-tearing-vlc-nvidia.html and it still continues to act up.. and my nvidia card is 275gtx.
2010-06-06T00:28:00.000Z	Warlord		Also I have compiz on the highest setting. I tired to disable it still does same thing.
2010-06-06T00:28:00.000Z	Warlord		any idea?
