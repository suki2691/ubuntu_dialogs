2008-07-22T20:27:00.000Z	craigbass1976		I want to have one email account that I can check from wherever (this I can do already) but I'd also like to save sent messages on the server as well and have my clients update so that I have the same sent emails on every client. WHere do I start?

2008-07-22T20:27:00.000Z	craigbass1976	hiptobecubic	no, mail server is my own
