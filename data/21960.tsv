So I have to use my old password, but the thing is once my computer goes to screen saver after 5 minutes and I have to login again, then I'll have to use my new password. Its a little strange, so I was wondering if there are two different passwords that needed to be changed, or if this is some kind of fluke. Any thoughts?

2010-12-18T05:13:00.000Z	Bluefever	R1cochet	that makes sense, but where would I go to change my root pass?
