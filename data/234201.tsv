2010-05-20T13:22:00.000Z	stimpie		I have suddenly lost the new gnome notifications, how can I enable them?
2010-05-20T13:23:00.000Z	Severian	stimpie	I had that happen on one machine after an upgrade.  Rebooting brought it back.
2010-05-20T13:24:00.000Z	Severian	stimpie	I had a customer turn it off somehow.  Go to System/Preferences/Startup Applications and turn it back on.
2010-05-20T13:27:00.000Z	stimpie	Severian	I had to add the notification applet to the panel (no idea why it was gone) thanks for your help
