2006-12-03T11:16:00.000Z	Mixx`		are there instructions out there for how to (easily) upgrade to the 2.19 kernel?  I've looked and nothing seems tailored to ubuntu
2006-12-03T11:17:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Mixx`	youd want feisty. anyway, a kernel is just dropin
2006-12-03T11:21:00.000Z	Mixx`	nolimitsoya	- ok so it sounds like it's not recommended to try to upgrade edgy to 2.19 then
2006-12-03T11:21:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	Mixx`	no, it isnt. if you realy must, its just a dropin anyways...
