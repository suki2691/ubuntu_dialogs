2012-10-28T22:48:00.000Z	allquixotic	tapee	any C library that's compatible, is what it comes down to. Is tiny libc compatible? uclibc? eglibc? bionic? It depends on the application. Chances are, if it's compiled for glibc/eglibc, it probably uses symbols or functionality that won't work without porting to other C libraries.
