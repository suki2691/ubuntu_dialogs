2012-05-18T04:24:00.000Z	hwolff		Hello, I have a question about ubuntu and virtualbox. Every time I run an update, the system installs the generic-pae kernel. When I boot, it then boots the pae kernel. But that kernel has no module vboxdrv.
2012-05-18T04:25:00.000Z	hwolff		solid_liq: Is there a vboxdrv for pae? If not, is there a way for the update not to install pae?
2012-05-18T04:25:00.000Z	solid_liq	hwolff	why are you asking me?
2012-05-18T04:25:00.000Z	hwolff	solid_liq	sorry, my irc client seems to have expanded the so: to your nick. I'm sorry.
