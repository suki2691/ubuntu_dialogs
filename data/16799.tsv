2011-03-17T10:33:00.000Z	jekin	sacarlson	....... i tried the recover mode but it also gives init not found error

2011-03-17T10:36:00.000Z	jekin	sacarlson	.. the boot CD also fails actually .......  it kind of freezes midway ... also tried the safe graphics mode while booting from CD still fails ......... as long as i am using the GFX card none of linux distro (tried fedora Kubuntu ubuntu)  fail to boot
