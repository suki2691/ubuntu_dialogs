2012-01-27T23:43:00.000Z	GeminiDomino	Tellmarch	Perfect... I even uninstalled it and explicitly installed the firefox-3.0 package with apt, and it STILL did it.
2012-01-27T23:45:00.000Z	Tellmarch	GeminiDomino	thanks for the warning, i don't want firefox 9 either and hadn't noticed before you talked about it.
2012-01-27T23:46:00.000Z	GeminiDomino	Tellmarch	No problem
