2008-03-19T14:13:00.000Z	unop	ooboontoo	ubuntu is released on a live CD

2008-03-19T14:40:00.000Z	unop	ooboontoo	you can use a USB stick to save some settings of a live CD session -- i'm not sure about installing applications to it for future sessions although you can save applications on a USB stick which can be installed later
