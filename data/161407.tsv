2007-10-28T08:27:00.000Z	Radio_man		Why
2007-10-28T08:28:00.000Z	Radio_man		Plug it in after dark....j/k.
2007-10-28T08:30:00.000Z	Radio_man		 VLC plays my DVD..And I installed libdvdcss for totem...The problem is ,totem does not play past the disclaimer....any suggestions.
2007-10-28T08:31:00.000Z	dxdt	Radio_man	could be a bug with totem, try another DVD and see if totem still stops there.  If VLC is playing it, I would bet totem bug :(
