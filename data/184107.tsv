2006-06-04T08:33:00.000Z	skippy81	ydnar	i think its better to do the steps yourself, you will learn more and only install stuff you need/want
2006-06-04T08:36:00.000Z	skippy81	ydnar	most programs will appear on the menu 'naturally'. however there is a program called alacarte menu editor which lets you edit menus yourself - the easiest way of launching the editor is with a right click on your top gnome bar
