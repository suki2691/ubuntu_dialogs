2009-03-05T19:28:00.000Z	m_clement		I've got a server on Ubuntu and I don't understand how to point a domain name on it
2009-03-05T19:28:00.000Z	n8tuserf	m_clement	-> your have a static ip address assigned to your server?
2009-03-05T19:30:00.000Z	m_clement	n8tuserf	the hotline told me that the server doesn't know it has to manage it
