2006-03-28T08:48:00.000Z	rcaskey_	patrick522	not that you want to use
2006-03-28T08:50:00.000Z	rcaskey_	patrick522	what makes VB great is that it's a package deal, you get good docs, etc and that's not true of VB alternatives. Your best alternative is probably Pygthon + GTK but documentation is pretty bad relative to MSDN even there
2006-03-28T08:50:00.000Z	rcaskey_	patrick522	in a few more months mono + gtk# may be what you are after
