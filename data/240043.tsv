2007-10-02T12:00:00.000Z	bcw		I'm writing an input system for tablet computers (for linux). I've done some experiments to verify I can basically do what I want, and now it's time to back up, and set up the proper infrastructure for developing software that can be installed, un-installed, not conflict, etc.
2007-10-02T12:00:00.000Z	bcw		I'm not speaking of a .deb yet, but rather the make & folders & naming conventions to allow me to build this correctly in the first place, so that it can be a package later.
2007-10-02T12:00:00.000Z	bcw		Is this the place to ask such questions?
