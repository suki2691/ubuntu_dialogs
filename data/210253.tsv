2008-10-24T22:59:00.000Z	redheat		folks, I just need help with a little problem..my usb wireless adapter, which uses a rt73usb, a ralink chipset, won't connect to my wireless network, the card has its driver installed and working properly but it won't connect to my wireless network, I would be thankful if anyone could help me with that problem.
