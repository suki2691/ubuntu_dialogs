2010-02-15T04:08:00.000Z	MindVirus	gwildor	No.
2010-02-15T04:13:00.000Z	gwildor	MindVirus	i would suggest maybe using a lighter player, xmms or beep maybe will give better results. rythmbox is heavy for me, even when plugged in
2010-02-15T04:14:00.000Z	MindVirus	gwildor	Perhaps, but Rhythmbox used to use ~20% CPU with Pulse.
