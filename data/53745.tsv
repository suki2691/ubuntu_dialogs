2009-06-23T20:48:00.000Z	jsjohnsen	firecrotch	I have a IBM R50e, connected to a samsung LCD. I can not get the resolution higher than the resolution of my laptop (1024x768).
2009-06-23T20:50:00.000Z	jsjohnsen	firecrotch	When I do different things only an area corresponding to 1024x768 pixels is active (unless I use 1024x768 then the entire scrreen is active)
