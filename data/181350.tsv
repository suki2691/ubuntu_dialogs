2007-02-25T11:36:00.000Z	bruenig	section31	right but when you compile it normally, don't you have to have the codec libraries on the computer first, so if ubuntu has a precompiled version that didn't have all the codecs there when they compiled them, you wouldn't be able to get it to work, (this is all assuming that you needed to have the codecs before compiling normally which I think is true but am not sure)
