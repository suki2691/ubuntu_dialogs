2008-12-21T12:06:00.000Z	DDR_		Hello. Is there a specific sub-channel for sound problems? I have an unknown playback error. (Same with recording, but one thing at a time.)
2008-12-21T12:06:00.000Z	DDR_		I think that Ubuntu is not running real-time image enhancement on the webcam.
2008-12-21T12:07:00.000Z	DDR_		I might be wrong, though... it's not an area of expertise for me.
2008-12-21T12:07:00.000Z	Scabdates	DDR_	anyway to fix this?
