2010-03-27T01:33:00.000Z	Linux_Titan	LinuxGuy2009	I have done that, I know that part well. The problem lies in the fact that despite my chmod -x command the file remains unexecutable
2010-03-27T01:34:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	Linux_Titan	Go into gnome and check with right click properties to see if its set to executable. Double check thats all.
2010-03-27T01:34:00.000Z	Linux_Titan	LinuxGuy2009	btw all of that can be done simply by opening a terminal window and typing "sudo stop gdm"
