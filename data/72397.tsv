2008-12-01T18:07:00.000Z	SlimHIppo		I'm trying to get dual monitors working with a Radeon 9800 card under Ubuntu. So far both monitors are displaying the same screen but I can't find any (working) tools to configure what is displayed on each one. I just want the secondary to extend the primary, with an option of displaying a different workspace. *eep* it's busy right now.
