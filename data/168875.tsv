2006-09-20T10:48:00.000Z	marko2		can someone help me install this thing? I've tried the regular CD and it goes painfully slow (i assume its because I only have 256MB, not sure). So I got the alternate CD and when I go into text mode, it says it's booting kernel, but then it reaches a black screen and stays there for ever
2006-09-20T10:49:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	marko2	the live cd should boot w/ just 256 mbs of ram...what happens when you use the livecd---how far do you get?
2006-09-20T10:53:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	marko2	it's a livecd so it should take a while but definitly not 10 minutes...once you get into gnome, if you do, try installing to the hard drive and see if performs improves after install
