2005-04-12T07:07:00.000Z	alle		I've installed Ubuntu on a computer illiterate family's computer since they were fed up with Windows, and it's more or less fine so far. But now they're getting fed up with Ubuntu, too, since I can't get their printer to work. I wondered if upgrading to Hoary could help, and how safe it is right now?

2005-04-12T07:08:00.000Z	alle	Bazzi	I'll try. But they're really kind of angry right now :-)
