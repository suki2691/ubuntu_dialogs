2006-07-11T05:45:00.000Z	LjL	sheMazeOfTorment	not in the repositories unfortunately, for all i could see :-(
2006-07-11T05:45:00.000Z	LjL	sheMazeOfTorment	well there are a few, they're just not packaged. i had made a list, let's see if i can find them again...
2006-07-11T05:47:00.000Z	LjL	sheMazeOfTorment	oh, actually there *is* gtkguitune in the repos. it's a gtk1.2 app, so it looks a little ugly, but it's there
