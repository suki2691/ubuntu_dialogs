2010-01-07T12:28:00.000Z	cryingfreeman		I run Jaunty, since Karmic doesn't play well with my computer, and i need a VPN-client that supports one time passwords (OTP). I came across this http://blog.cyphermox.net/2008/10/call-for-testing-network-manager-vpnc.html and tried to install via his PPA, but it requires gtk 2.17+ which i don't have installed. Are there any other way in which i can get this installed, like from backports? Is there OTP-support in the net

2010-01-07T12:29:00.000Z	Kieran0413	cryingfreeman	it's for network-manager, so I doubt it'll be much help without gtk
