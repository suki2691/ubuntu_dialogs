2009-11-05T01:48:00.000Z	Slart	baram	you don't.. that's just a packed file.. it could contain anything
2009-11-05T01:49:00.000Z	Slart	baram	if you downloaded it from some place you need to look at the same place for instructions
2009-11-05T01:49:00.000Z	baram	Slart	when I unpack it it just contains "oggenc-aotuvb5d"
