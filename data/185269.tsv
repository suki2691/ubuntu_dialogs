2006-06-02T16:30:00.000Z	kosnick	mekanzoo	: when you use synaptic you do not have to search for dependencies , it does all this work for you
2006-06-02T16:32:00.000Z	mekanzoo	kosnick	I am trying to install lynx from terminal  and it requested for libssl.so.5 . now I got libssl.so.5, but how do I install it?
2006-06-02T16:33:00.000Z	kosnick	mekanzoo	: open synaptic and use the search button. When you find what you want , use the apply button and the rest will be done by synaptic (it will download what you need AND what is needed ,depdencies, and will istall them)
