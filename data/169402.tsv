2006-10-29T14:17:00.000Z	factorx		I've got another sound problem, I am sure my sound card was detected properly and it's even unmuted but I can't play any of the example sound files or my own music although volume is turned up... what's wrong there?
2006-10-29T11:57:00.000Z	factorx		Hi guys. My sound doesn't work although Ubuntu recognizes my soundcard properly and I'm also sure it's unmuted. Nevertheless I don't hear any sound when playing a sound file in Rhythmbox or Totem. What's wrong?
