2006-07-27T09:03:00.000Z	Enverex		When Edgy comes out, I heard about being able to run 32bit and 64bit programs on it at the same time, now will I be able to upgrade from 32bit Dapper to that version of Edgy or will I need to be on 64bit Dapper?
2006-07-27T09:03:00.000Z	mcphail	Enverex	you can run 32 and 64bit progs at present
2007-01-12T06:01:00.000Z	mcphail	Enverex	as i recall, these options are lost if you run xgl/compiz (?beryl)
