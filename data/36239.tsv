I installed it using ext3, now i'm getting that stupid initramfs message and well GRUB2 doesn't even load just moves straight to ubuntu load which then dies.... 64 bit system, Dual booted with Windows 7 64 bit, 6gb ram, 2.66GHz Intel Core 2 Duo I'm sure that's the main stuff you need to know right?

2010-05-10T06:39:00.000Z	pchater	Radio-l	What do I do from there then?
2010-05-10T06:40:00.000Z	pchater	Radio-l	How would I get rid of this initramfs err? lol. (Using EXT3 btw)
