2011-09-17T21:01:00.000Z	Zoffix	FoxtrotZero	I first installed windows, then I installed ubuntu into a separate drive (you can also use a separate partition).
2011-09-17T21:02:00.000Z	Zoffix	FoxtrotZero	a word of learned advice: don't trying to install Vista along with your existing files.. I told it not to touch my ubuntu partition, and it deleted it anyway. I think maybe it has some anti-Linux code :)
2011-09-17T21:04:00.000Z	FoxtrotZero	Zoffix	I assure you I have no intention of doing that. I really only need to keep my copy of XP around (thats right, i'm on an at least five year old machine) for my computer-illiterate grandparents.
