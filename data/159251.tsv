2007-01-26T07:09:00.000Z	kenthomson		Is there any browser replacement for Firefox, it uses 100% of my CPU making the website/tabs/GNOME panels, the WHOLE freakin' computer unresponsive like HELL!, It's worse than windows xp now! :(, Do you think some extensions/plugins could be causing this or is this piece of crap so poorly coded? HELPPP
