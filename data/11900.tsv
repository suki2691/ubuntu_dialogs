2011-07-16T04:07:00.000Z	yaaase		I had a question.  I am running ubuntu 11.04, x64.  Using VGA to double output to my tv (lcd).  The scaling is wrong on the tv output, the top and left areas of the screen get cut off.  Anyone know how to tell the system to measure the screen from the 2nd monitor rather than from the primary?
