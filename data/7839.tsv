2011-12-20T01:25:00.000Z	bf4648		Alright, the following command line keeps giving me " rm: can not remove /var/www/its/tmp/other_tests.zip : no such file or directory
2011-12-20T01:26:00.000Z	sskalnik	bf4648	 file doesn't exist then
2011-12-20T01:26:00.000Z	sskalnik	bf4648	 confirm that the file exists and that the path in the command is correct
2011-12-20T01:34:00.000Z	sskalnik	bf4648	 the spaces are almost assuredly the source of the error
