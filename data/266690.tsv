2010-05-31T09:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KF07	 its a bit of misswording and being 'over cautious' - If you want to use it on a desktop machine go ahead. Many of us in here have been using it on the desktop for years
2010-05-31T09:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KF07	 if you have 4+GB of ram - you want to use 64bit. If you do lots of video encoding./other cpu intensive tasks. You may want to use 64bit also
2010-05-31T09:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	KF07	 you cant install 64bit on a 32bit machine. :) You can do the reverse however.
