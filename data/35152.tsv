2010-11-03T20:20:00.000Z	romulusnr		it could be that the speaker cutoff is software controlled on that card.
2010-11-03T20:20:00.000Z	romulusnr		also have you tried different headphones
2010-11-03T20:21:00.000Z	tripelb	romulusnr	that's something I wondered/ I have an old card with no headphone jack on it. linusasus6
