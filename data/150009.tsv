2009-09-17T18:09:00.000Z	UBestB		I don't have rc.local
2009-09-17T18:10:00.000Z	UBestB		ok, do I need to use sudo as well or can that be ignored?
2009-09-17T18:10:00.000Z	UBestB		I mean, sudo as the command inside rc.local
2009-09-17T18:11:00.000Z	Pici	UBestB	There is no need to specify 'sudo' to run the command inside of rc.local
