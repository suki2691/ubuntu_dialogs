2012-01-02T18:12:00.000Z	computa_mike	Sidewinder1	I haven't seen that page, but I was working through the packaging guide.  My question is that I have some code that seems to want rsa.h  which it says is part of openssl, but I already have that installed... I wonder if there's an openssl-lib package that I should install to fulfill that dependancy...

2012-01-02T18:16:00.000Z	computa_mike	Sidewinder1	No worries - It was just confusing...  the way I see it... If I have openssl installed, I probably don't have the source for it (the dev package),and it's probably just a case of meeting that dependancy (i hope).  Looks like I'll give it a try...  Thanks - and thanks ssta
