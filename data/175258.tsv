2007-06-18T16:39:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	WaxyFresh	 you might end up with corruption of any open files which are waiting to be written to disk
2007-07-01T15:15:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	WaxyFresh	 ntfs (for NT and newer) or vfat (aka "fat32" - for win98 and older)
2007-07-04T11:31:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	WaxyFresh	maybe #debian-amd64 ?
