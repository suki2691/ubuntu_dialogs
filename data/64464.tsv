2009-03-04T21:16:00.000Z	natsukashi	Besogon	I'm quite new to this, should I just write /boot/grub/menu.st in the terminal?
2009-03-04T21:19:00.000Z	natsukashi		I don't like the looks of this. One of my HDD's isn't showing up
2009-03-04T21:19:00.000Z	Besogon	natsukashi	No. This file like boot.ini in Windows and more. Sorry. I cant tell you enough about it, but in the internet have many information.
