2008-04-26T04:26:00.000Z	chcampb		i've been trying to set up a media server on this laptop, running gutsy, for access with the rest of the computers in my house, running xp, but it asks for a password that is different from my account password... i did a quick search and found that the samba password is different from the account password, but the sambapasswd file that is supposed to contain that password is not turning up...
2008-04-26T04:26:00.000Z	chcampb		...on tracker.... how would i find this password and/or change it?
