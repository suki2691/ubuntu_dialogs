2008-05-04T04:46:00.000Z	Genotrius		Alright, I've narrowed down my problem. My lovely little Mac keyboard works under Kubuntu, but it doesn't work under Ubuntu. So, as far as I can tell. the problem lies with GNOME. Can anyone help me now? And please don't try to tell me to fix it with alt-F4, I'm not that dumb.

2008-05-04T04:47:00.000Z	Scunizi	Genotrius	have you tried changing to the mac keyboard in "keyboard" listed under sys/preferances/keyboard?
2008-05-04T04:50:00.000Z	Scunizi	Genotrius	well.. I think apple is the only choice. there isn't one specifically for mac.. I haven't looked at the option close enough but does it give you different keyboards to choose from under apple? sorry I don't know much about apple keyboards..
