2009-07-17T02:31:00.000Z	isaac_		Total know-nothing end-user here.  Trying to change the priority of Audacity to realtime, permanently.  Found a forum thread that said to use "renice -<priority> <rhytmbox's pid>"
2009-07-17T02:32:00.000Z	isaac_		What is the pid and how do I find it?
2009-07-17T02:32:00.000Z	firecrotch	isaac_	 it's a number that identifies the process, you can find it by running pidof rhythmbox
2009-07-17T02:33:00.000Z	firecrotch	isaac_	or rather, pidof audacity (or whatever the name of the program is)
