2007-02-07T09:21:00.000Z	Zdra		hi, I compiled metacity with compositor enabled in feisty. It links on libcm.... but when I start it I see no 3d effects...
2007-02-07T09:21:00.000Z	Zdra		how do I activate the compositor ?
2007-02-07T09:21:00.000Z	Zdra		using compiz it works
2007-02-07T09:21:00.000Z	Slart	Zdra	I don't think the compositor makes 3d by itself.. something else has to do that.. but that "something else" probably needs the compositor to do that
