2007-02-26T11:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	okih-imus	 how do you know its not on the  MBR then?
2007-02-26T11:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	okih-imus	 normally one would use fdisk, or some othe rpartioning tool to delete the linux partitions,  then run fixmbr,  you are saying you ran fixmbr and grub is STILL there?
