2009-09-03T22:24:00.000Z	pepperphd		what are my chances of successfully installing xubuntu on an old 600 mhz powerpc?
2009-09-03T22:24:00.000Z	tj83_	pepperphd	will prolly work... but slow as molasses
2009-09-03T22:25:00.000Z	pepperphd	tj83_	the thing is already slow, i just want a little box to mess with
2009-09-03T22:25:00.000Z	tj83_	pepperphd	i suggest something full CLI like ubuntu server or something like that.
