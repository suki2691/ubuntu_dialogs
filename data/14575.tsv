2011-05-07T15:24:00.000Z	gartral	abrakazam	yes, i REALLLY do need to exactly where it's put. i have a broken-state package that's preventing me from installing ANYTHING through apt-get.
2011-05-07T15:25:00.000Z	abrakazam	gartral	have you triedsudo apt-get -f ?
2011-05-07T15:26:00.000Z	gartral	abrakazam	read back, i've tried that, it complains about the broken package and prevents me from fixing/forcing the install.
