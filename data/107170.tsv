2008-01-12T11:57:00.000Z	Starnestommy	JerseyMonkey	wget http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/169.07/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-169.07-pkg1.run ?
2008-01-12T11:57:00.000Z	JerseyMonkey	Starnestommy	I attempted that, and it kept saying "Name or service unknown' and it seems like I spelt everything right.
2008-01-12T11:58:00.000Z	JerseyMonkey	Starnestommy	I'm just going to install ssh-server and SCP the file over. Should hopefully work through recovery console.
