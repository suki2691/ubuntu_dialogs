2010-05-01T21:45:00.000Z	Edmund		Hello- I want to back up the contents of my hard drive to a USB drive before upgrading- the process takes sevral hours and there are erros in the mddile that cause it to stop because of bad files. What command would I use to copy everything in my home directory, ignoring any erros and carrying on- only telling me the errors at the end, rather than stoppping halfway through?
