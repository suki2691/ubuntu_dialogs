2006-10-14T15:28:00.000Z	webben	wrabbit^	what sort of taskbar -- do you mean one which shows the current applications?
2006-10-14T15:28:00.000Z	wrabbit^	webben	yep
2006-10-14T15:29:00.000Z	webben	wrabbit^	I don't quite understand. By default Gnome on Ubuntu shows most running applications in the panel at the bottom of the screen.
