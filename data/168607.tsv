2009-09-26T18:40:00.000Z	MarkG		Hi, how do I clear out all the useless entries in my grub menu, I seem to have many kernel entries, along with safe versions of everything, it always grows, and never shrinks...
2009-09-26T18:41:00.000Z	MarkG		how do I remove old kernels?
2009-09-26T18:43:00.000Z	MarkG		I have had the latest one for a while, and it's fine, I just want to clean out all the crap thats listed on my grub menu.   I have removed the entries from menu.lst before, and then I got loads of errors in the future.
