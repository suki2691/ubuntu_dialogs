2009-02-19T17:17:00.000Z	Favorit	IntuitiveNipple	hehe, i keep forgetting about that cache all the time, actually :) Sometimes takes me a while to figure where the hell did the space on /var disappear while there're really no applications that spit in there, not even logging :)
2009-02-19T17:18:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Favorit	Yeah... I have the apt cache in a separate LVM volume just to protect against /var/ running out of space
2009-02-19T17:18:00.000Z	Favorit	IntuitiveNipple	that's a good one actually! Should do that as well
