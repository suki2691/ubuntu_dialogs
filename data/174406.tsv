2006-07-20T11:26:00.000Z	qwerty_		that url looks helpful but wouldnt easyubuntu or automatix be faster and easier
2006-07-20T11:28:00.000Z	qwerty_		can they actually destroy the whole system requiring me to reinstall ubuntu
2006-07-20T11:28:00.000Z	humanpersonman	qwerty_	did you do a fresh install
2006-07-20T11:29:00.000Z	humanpersonman	qwerty_	then there is a very low chance, I have fresh installed and then automatix probably 5-6 times and never had any problems
