2012-08-31T20:23:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd		Also I've flashed the BIOS without rebooting before in Windows
2012-08-31T20:23:00.000Z	MB_wrk	WarOfTheNerd	provided by Ubuntu? Provided by whom? And that depends on the specific hardware. Again with the assumptions.
2012-08-31T20:24:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	MB_wrk	provided by the vendor.  Find me a BIOS and/or mobo vendor which doesn't provide bootable MinWin or DOS-based flashing tools.
