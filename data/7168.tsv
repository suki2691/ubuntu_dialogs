2011-12-19T02:08:00.000Z	Gulli		Hey, was wondering if I could get some help. I have a bootable USB key (not ubuntu) that I want to boot from, but the grub menu shows no USB and even though I change the boot order in the BIOS it still dosent boot. Anyone know how I can boot from a USB? I have ubuntu and win 7 installed

2011-12-19T02:10:00.000Z	Gulli		its not the BIOS, I have changed the boot order there. It always goes to the ghrub menu where I can schoose between ubunutu and win 7
