2008-03-08T11:12:00.000Z	stacey		ok. i am trying to make some back up discs of all my shit on my computer. and i just put the blank cd in and it asked if i wanted to burn a cd and i said yes. so i put the files i wanted into the folder and pressed write to disc. it took like 5 mins but nothing was burnt to the disc. what other programs can i use? im an idiot with linux by the way lol

2008-03-08T11:14:00.000Z	vocx	stacey	Are you sure nothing was burnt? Have you ejected the disk?
