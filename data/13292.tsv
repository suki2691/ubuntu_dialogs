2011-06-17T08:46:00.000Z	bodiecon		heading out of town and trying to configure remote desktop.  everything works but i still have to hit accept on desktop for session to begin.  i have enabled UPnP on router but still can't login.  is there a way around this?  what am i missing?

2011-06-17T08:47:00.000Z	bodiecon	Nobgul-BNC	hmm.  i'll look into that.
