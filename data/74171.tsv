2008-11-16T16:45:00.000Z	gentlemen		Hello World, I have an issue with my wireless connection in Ubuntu 8.10. My wireless card is working but I cannot see my own wireless router to connect to, but I can see my neighbours routers. The weird thing is that if I log into the Windows Partition on the laptop that Ubuntu is running on I can see my network. Any suggestions to help me out?
