2011-08-23T08:59:00.000Z	henry-		I'm trying to get some files out of my samsung gt-s5600, when I connect the phone via USB and select mass storage the device mounts for a few seconds then disappears
2011-08-23T09:00:00.000Z	henry-		bluetooth isn't an option for me and I'd like to believe that there's a more convenient way to get the files out than having a virtual windows machine
