2011-03-14T07:44:00.000Z	Breach		I picked up an Acer Aspire One D255E (10.1 netbook) just to play around with. Which would be the best option.. Ubuntu 10.10 or the 10.10 netbook edition?
2011-03-14T07:45:00.000Z	josh_	Breach	are you familiar with both? either?
2011-03-14T07:46:00.000Z	josh_	Breach	well, unity is going to be 'revolutionary', I guess. Not that that is always good =/
2011-03-14T07:46:00.000Z	josh_	Breach	versus the gnome you know and love, more or less.
