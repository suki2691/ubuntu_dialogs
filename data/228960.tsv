2007-01-21T14:42:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt		Does anyone have experience converting a set of jpeg files into, say, an avi file?  I know mencoder can do this, but the options are cryptic and I don't know if I have all the software installed that is required to do this.

2007-01-21T14:44:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	my_haz	imagemagick can create avi files? I'll look into it. I've only used it to create animated gifs.
2007-01-21T14:51:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	my_haz	Any idea how to do it with imagemagick/convert?  I'm reading docs now, but if you happen to know...
