2011-03-25T00:01:00.000Z	lordmofisto		i need help, i have an old HDD with I think Windows XP on it, I want to completely remove that and put ubuntu on, but i can't find out how to change the MBR. I can only see partitioning.
2011-03-25T00:01:00.000Z	kerneloops_	lordmofisto	use dban to wipe it out
2011-03-25T00:01:00.000Z	kerneloops_	lordmofisto	or just install ubuntu over it
