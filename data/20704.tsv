2011-01-11T00:53:00.000Z	testo		hi im about to set up a printer server with ubuntu and i was wondering if i could use a client pc and configure the printer to be only reachable via samba
2011-01-11T00:54:00.000Z	testo		so even the client pc goes through samba if he wants to print
2011-01-11T00:55:00.000Z	testo		plus can i allow only administrators to change printer settings?
