2008-01-30T01:07:00.000Z	pandorange		Hi all, I was just wondering. I have sound only in the login and "Login window preferences" .  I am new to ubuntu and find it quite confusing...
2008-01-30T01:08:00.000Z	peabody	pandorange	Do you see a speaker icon in the upper right hand corner?
2008-01-30T01:09:00.000Z	peabody	pandorange	??? is that a problem?
