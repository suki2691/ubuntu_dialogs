2008-03-28T02:34:00.000Z	marsje	amenado	I think "::/0  fe80::240:f4ff:fe4b:c9b5   UGDAe" means that all stuff goes to the link local address of my debian machine, which I guess is good. Not sure about those flags either...
2008-03-28T02:43:00.000Z	marsje	amenado	not sure about that setting AdvRouterAddr. it seemed like something I don't need...
