2007-10-03T11:48:00.000Z	CommonClone		but ubuntu is a far superior product for a notbook or non power user
2007-10-03T11:50:00.000Z	CommonClone		you know whats weird...when I had SuSE 10.2 on this laptop, compiz ran horribly slow...I thought my card sucked or something...but w/ ubuntu all the eyecandy stuff is way smoother
