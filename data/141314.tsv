2007-03-27T16:06:00.000Z	BeepAU		For weeks I couldn't get sound to work at all on my Sigmatel STAC9200 sound card, I read that this is a known bug in ALSA. I tried installing OSS and it's kinda worked, but I only get very low output through my headphones. Is anyone experienced with OSS and can help me out?
