I have Vista running virtually under innotek VirtualBox so that I can use iTunes and watch Netflix On Demand movies.. when Netflix plays it's video in the browser using it's plugin that uses WMP 11, the video is very choppy.  I have high bandwidth and a powerful enough computer, so I don't understand what I'm doing wrong.
