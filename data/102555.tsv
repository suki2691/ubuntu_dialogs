2010-06-21T11:01:00.000Z	rww	musictoto	because the people who rewrote the website text don't know what they're on about
2010-06-21T11:02:00.000Z	musictoto	maco	rww: to know if your processor supports 32 bit rather than 64 bit is only a search away though ? that's the only reason ?
2010-06-21T11:02:00.000Z	rww	musictoto	yup. 64-bit works fine on 64-bit computers.
