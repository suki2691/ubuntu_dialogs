2006-09-04T11:10:00.000Z	SpaceFrog		hey, i have a wine-related question.. I'm trying to install an important program (used in conjunction with a uni course)... It appears to be written in VB6, and manipulates a MSAccess database. It won't open the database, so i'm assuming it doesn't have the MS data access .dlls or something... Do i need to install MS access in Wine or is there another way i can do this?
