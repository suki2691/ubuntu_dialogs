2008-04-21T09:39:00.000Z	goodhabit	sparr_	xmms is not developing any more. Audacious is replacement for xmms.
2008-04-21T09:40:00.000Z	sparr_	goodhabit	xmms had a release like 5 months ago, thats a lot less "not developing" than many other packages
2008-04-21T09:41:00.000Z	goodhabit	sparr_	audacious is better not only cuz of better development.
