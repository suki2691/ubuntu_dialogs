In Windows, I would highlight them all, right click and select extract here. Since i'm still learning more things about Linux since I Switched to it a few weeks ago, will it be easy to extract it the same way?

2007-07-07T11:48:00.000Z	Shadow6363	john__	 run a sudo apt-get install rar
2007-07-07T11:49:00.000Z	Shadow6363	john__	you should be able to, shouldnt even have to highlight them all, just open one and it should work, but i cant guarantee that
