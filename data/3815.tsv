2012-04-29T08:12:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug		Hello everybody, I seem to have hosed my installation upgrading from 10.10 -> 11.04 -> 11.10, I was curious if the best course of action was to download 12.04 and start over
2012-04-29T08:13:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug		System seems to hang whe it runs /scripts/init-bottom
2012-04-29T08:13:00.000Z	InferiorHumanOrg	Sir_Fawnpug	seems like a fresh install of 12.04 would be alot easier
2012-04-29T08:15:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	InferiorHumanOrg	that seems to be a good idea; if boot is screwed up I might as well
