2005-10-17T05:31:00.000Z	LaserLine		What Driver should I install for an ATI Radeon 9500 PRO under Breezy ? Should I got with the 'xorg-driver-fglrx (6.8.0-8.8.25-0ubuntu10)' Package or download the driver from ATI's website Version: 8.16.20
2005-10-17T05:32:00.000Z	LasseL	LaserLine	I think the driver in breezy is newer than what you say
2005-10-17T05:32:00.000Z	LaserLine	LasseL	are the version numbers supposed to be the same ? or Ubuntu changes the numbers?
2005-10-17T05:34:00.000Z	LasseL	LaserLine	I have  Installed: 6.8.0-8.16.20-0ubuntu16
