2005-07-16T05:49:00.000Z	ex-parrot	G|immer	why bother having stuff owned by root?
2005-07-16T05:51:00.000Z	G|immer	ex-parrot	they are already set to be owned by root. It seems eveything i do in root terminal is set as owned by root, too?! :(
2005-07-16T05:52:00.000Z	ex-parrot	G|immer	chown youruser:youruser files
