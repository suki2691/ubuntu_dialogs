2005-05-10T13:40:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser		if i want the kernel source to be in the right place when i run apt-src, where should my working path be?
2005-05-10T13:40:00.000Z	Quinn_Storm	Kamping_Kaiser	actually you just do apt-get kernel-source-whatever
2005-05-10T13:41:00.000Z	Quinn_Storm	Kamping_Kaiser	they made special packages to fix that
2005-05-10T13:43:00.000Z	Quinn_Storm	Kamping_Kaiser	you really want the debianish kernel package...it looks like 2.6.11 just isn't up yet
