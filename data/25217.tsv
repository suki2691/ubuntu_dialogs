2011-01-19T21:04:00.000Z	tehbaut		my numpad on my keyboard isn't working at all on my USB install of Maverick... what should I try, to fix it?
2011-01-19T21:04:00.000Z	oCean	tehbaut	are other usb devices working?
2011-01-19T21:05:00.000Z	tehbaut	oCean	yep, and the keyboard is working, just not the numpad, even if I hit num lock or scroll lock
2011-01-19T21:07:00.000Z	oCean	tehbaut	ah ok, I thought it was a separate usb numpad. It's just the numpad part of the keyboard that doesn't work? I have not heard that before
