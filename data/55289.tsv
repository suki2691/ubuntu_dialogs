2011-03-27T20:51:00.000Z	edbian	thoms0n	What do you mean (source) did you download the source code?
2011-03-27T20:54:00.000Z	edbian	thoms0n	Did you install it?
2011-03-27T20:56:00.000Z	edbian	thoms0n	Then it's sort of a guessing game trying to figure out where that program's installer put things.  Does it have an uninstaller or a readme about how to uninstall that came with the source?  (there is almost definitely something installed in /usr/local/bin/)
