2007-06-26T15:59:00.000Z	greyfrog	Ecnerifed_	did you install using apt?
2007-06-26T16:00:00.000Z	greyfrog	Ecnerifed_	not sure then... iptraf is in the repos though... you shouldn't have to d/l and setup yourself
2007-06-26T16:00:00.000Z	greyfrog	Ecnerifed_	you need to run it using sudo though as well...
