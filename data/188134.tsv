2006-11-30T06:07:00.000Z	dm_		Hello. I want to crop a small area from a .ps or .pdf file and save as a new gs/pdf on ubuntu. The package pdftk doesn't seem to support this. Where can I find some info about those operations? Does anyone know an irc channel for postscript/ghostscript related things?

2006-11-30T06:11:00.000Z	dm_	hastesaver	Thank you. I'll have a look ...
2006-11-30T06:17:00.000Z	dm_	hastesaver	I checked flpsed but there's no function crop or similar. You only can add text to an existing ps doc.
