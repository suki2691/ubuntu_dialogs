2011-04-22T21:48:00.000Z	DaPenguin	Sidewinder1	then again, my setup is about as far from a default install as you can get and still call it ubuntu lol.
2011-04-22T21:49:00.000Z	DaPenguin	Sidewinder1	my next project is going to be rolling my own kernel, but figure i'll wait for the upgrade before i do that.
