2007-11-28T01:28:00.000Z	ta1		I am unable to use .php scripts in firefox.. every time I try it doesn't recognize it and wants to use BlueFish to edit it.... any ideas?
2007-11-28T01:28:00.000Z	jorman	ta1	php scripts are meant to be run from a webserver
2007-11-28T01:28:00.000Z	jorman	ta1	don't expect 'em to work just by opening them in firefox
2007-11-28T01:34:00.000Z	jorman	ta1	and restart apache after doing what FireH4zrd told you
