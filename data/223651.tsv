2005-09-11T16:14:00.000Z	sanketmedhi		i installed Ubuntu 5.04 from the CDs i received from Ship It! I used the auto updater which updated the kernel to 2.6.10. But I guess the latest kernel is 2.6.12-1447. How do i update my kernel using apt-get to the latest version?
2005-09-11T16:15:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	sanketmedhi	is there anything you sp[ecifically NEED the 2.6.12 kernel for?
2005-09-11T16:30:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	sanketmedhi	change sources and perform a LARGE update I think..
