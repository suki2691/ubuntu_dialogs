2007-03-08T14:27:00.000Z	morpheusdreams		first of all, am new to linux and have never used a command line except the occasional ipconfig on windows. I want to navigate to my desktop through the terminal window but I don't know where it is. Please help?
2007-03-08T14:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	morpheusdreams	cd ~/Desktop/
2007-03-08T14:28:00.000Z	gordonjcp	morpheusdreams	the "~" translates to /home/(your username)
2007-03-08T14:28:00.000Z	gordonjcp	morpheusdreams	think of /home as being very roughly like C:/documentsandsettings/
