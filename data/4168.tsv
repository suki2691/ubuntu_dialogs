2012-04-03T21:50:00.000Z	jsteven5		Hi all, I'm trying to install Ubuntu on a new machine (Gigabyte motherboard, Radeon graphics card).  The LIveCD keeps hanging.  The AlternateCD gets partly completed, then hangs.  It won't respond to CTRL-ALT-F1 etc.  How can I find out what is causing the problem?

2012-04-03T21:51:00.000Z	jsteven5		I started on the Memory check on the liveCD, but stopped at about 50% complete to try some other options.  I can give it another go, but it will take a few hours.
2012-04-03T21:55:00.000Z	jsteven5	kneeki	I can try the ram test again.  I thought that it might be the radeon card, because I could get further by setting some kernel options (radeon.modeset=0), but I don't think that would cause problems in the alternate CD.
