2011-01-28T06:06:00.000Z	nickkontos		hello guys, a simple question: alt+f2 opens a run dialog in ubuntu... what is the name of this appication? googled it with no luck...
2011-01-28T06:07:00.000Z	bastidrazor	nickkontos	its not a seperate application.. its part of gnome-panel
2011-01-28T06:08:00.000Z	nickkontos	badger32d	bastidrazor so if gnome panel isn't running I can't call it any other way?...
2011-01-28T06:08:00.000Z	bastidrazor	nickkontos	not that i'm aware of.
