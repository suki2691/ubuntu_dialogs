2007-06-13T16:58:00.000Z	zumi		how do I get a executable File?
2007-06-13T16:58:00.000Z	zumi		yes
2007-06-13T16:58:00.000Z	HowardTheCoward	zumi	set its exectable attribute using chmod
2007-06-13T05:00:00.000Z	HowardTheCoward	zumi	chmod +x might not be the proper choice sometimes, since it makes the file executable by everybody
