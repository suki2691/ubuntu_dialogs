2009-01-31T18:44:00.000Z	xanxor		Hi, I wonder if somebody could help me. I had Ubuntu running on a laptop, which later died due to hardware failure (motherboard, I believe). I took out the hard drive and put it in an external enclosure. I am able to boot from it on the desktop computer in the library, but not from this laptop that my friend leant me. I checked: the BIOS does support boot from USB external hard drive. It starts, GRUB starts, I get the Ubunt
