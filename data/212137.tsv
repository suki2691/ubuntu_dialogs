2011-07-22T13:05:00.000Z	padi999		Dear ubuntu-devs: If you give me a popup, that AN application wants to access the Default keyring, then have the decency to say WHICH application that is. I have 3 popups after each other on every login. And I don't like typing my password 4 times every login. Thanks
