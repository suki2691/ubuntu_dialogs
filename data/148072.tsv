2007-04-06T14:37:00.000Z	Cryoniq		My sister brought over an external USB2 Hard disk drive by name TargaBox. I inserted it into 6.10 system and it mounted up the disk. Problem: I can only read content, cannot write at all to the disk. *shrug* Any suggestions?
2007-04-06T14:37:00.000Z	Jowi	Cryoniq	what file system does it use?
2007-04-06T14:38:00.000Z	Cryoniq	Jowi	I been trying to figure that out. All googles turned up german discussions.. :) But yes.. NTFS appear in them.
2007-04-06T14:39:00.000Z	Jowi	Cryoniq	type "mount" in a terminal. it should show there.
