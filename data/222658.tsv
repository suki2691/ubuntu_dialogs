2010-11-21T11:18:00.000Z	Keith-BlindUser		Hi all. I need some assistance here with something in Ubuntu Lucid 64. I've already tried asking for help elsewwhere, and gotten no response.
2010-11-21T11:19:00.000Z	Keith-BlindUser		Basically, what I'm trying to do, is install Vmware workstation 7.1 64-bit version onto my Ubuntu laptop here. One thing it wants to do is change the number of allowed file descripters. But in the end the installer fails to do what it needs to do-and nothing changes. WHy?

2010-11-21T11:20:00.000Z	mneptok	Keith-BlindUser	is the installer graphical or text-based?
