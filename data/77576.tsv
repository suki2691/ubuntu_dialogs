2009-07-30T05:35:00.000Z	Gingerbread-Man		:-\ quick question
2009-07-30T05:35:00.000Z	Gingerbread-Man		why does ubuntu suck so much? .... never found a distro as bad as ubuntu
2009-07-30T05:37:00.000Z	Gingerbread-Man		not only does the distro suck but the irc channel is unhelpful to people who desperately need help often giveing flawed advice and not even attempting to explain why they should folow the advice
2009-07-30T05:38:00.000Z	losher	Gingerbread-Man	not only that, but people come on the channel complaining about how bad the distro is...
