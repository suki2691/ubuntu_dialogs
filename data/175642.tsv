2007-05-05T10:05:00.000Z	StriderZ	arooni	edit like how? GIMP is pretty much the standard.
2007-05-05T10:07:00.000Z	arooni	StriderZ	my designer has mocked up pages with jpgs... and i need to correct them ..... so i mostly want to notate what we have right now
2007-05-05T10:08:00.000Z	StriderZ	arooni	I think gimp would be the best choice. It's pretty much the Photoshop of linux....if you wanna put it that way...
