2008-11-17T06:47:00.000Z	m1nds1llus1on	vahnx	Don't. It's a bad idea on so many levels. This isn't windows.
2008-11-17T06:48:00.000Z	m1nds1llus1on	vahnx	Honestly, even if I did, I wouldn't tell you due to the inherent security risks involved. But no, I don't nor would I ever want to.
2008-11-17T06:49:00.000Z	m1nds1llus1on	vahnx	sure... but you're asking for my help which I have the right to withold if I so choose. It's your machine, if you want to know how to completely bypass any security built into your OS... feel free to figure it out on your own.
