2010-01-30T21:24:00.000Z	GabrieSOE		can anyone please explain to me what is the differace between ubuntu and redhat?
2010-01-30T21:25:00.000Z	coz_	GabrieSOE	 mm  well redhat is not free  first....
2010-01-30T21:27:00.000Z	coz_	GabrieSOE	 also  ubuntu uses  .deb packages...much freiendlier in my opinion... but are you asking because you have a choice of either one?
