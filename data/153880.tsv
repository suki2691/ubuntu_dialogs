2008-10-05T07:54:00.000Z	kitche	joshuajtl	because it's not a security update
2008-10-05T07:54:00.000Z	joshuajtl	kitche	oh what would it be? what do i need to add so that it will be uploaded?
2008-10-05T07:55:00.000Z	kitche	joshuajtl	nothing but you could check backports but I doubt it be there, maybe gimp has a package for ubuntu
