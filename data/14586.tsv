2012-02-25T21:35:00.000Z	ssta	daviddoria	I can't think of much the ubuntu TeX packages can't do...installing TeX isn't trivial
2012-02-25T21:36:00.000Z	daviddoria	ssta	yea I really don't want to, but I'm getting erros and the tex people have told me some of my packages are too old
2012-02-25T21:37:00.000Z	ssta	daviddoria	okay.  If it were me, I'd install the latest Ubuntu in a VM and install your TeX on that...but it's not for the fainthearted...
