2010-04-12T07:34:00.000Z	jhambo		is it true that irssi is not in ubuntu?? kpackagekit doesn't show it
2010-04-12T07:35:00.000Z	jhambo		also I can't seem to get firefox working.  When I go to it from menu it brings up some "firefox installer" how can I launch firefox
2010-04-12T07:37:00.000Z	jhambo		so what would be the "ubuntu way" to get irssi onto my system?
2010-04-12T07:39:00.000Z	IdleOne	jhambo	sudo apt-get install irssi
