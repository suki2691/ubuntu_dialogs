2009-05-26T00:43:00.000Z	Cojage		also i dont quite yet understand the hd drive letters, what is /sda ? Removable media?
2009-05-26T00:43:00.000Z	boss_mc	Cojage	sda is the first physical hard drive
2009-05-26T00:44:00.000Z	boss_mc	Cojage	sda1 is the first partition of that drive
2009-05-26T00:45:00.000Z	boss_mc	Cojage	sda is sata (although it all depends on how the bios numbers drives.... PATA drives get labelled as SATA on my machine)
