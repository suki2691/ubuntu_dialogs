Can anybody tell me what package put it there, so I can check I've not bungled the java install before looking for something more ARM-specific?
2012-08-21T15:26:00.000Z	Chipaca		ah, I have neither default-jre nor default-jre-headless installed
2012-08-21T15:26:00.000Z	Chipaca		excellent, thank you ThinkT510
2012-08-21T15:26:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Chipaca	no worries :)
