2010-05-24T09:01:00.000Z	Ravahan		Hello, can anyone help me get Boxee running on Karmic 64 bit?  When I try to open it the screen goes black for a second with a cursor then it goes back to normal.  There's a little thing in my taskbar that says "starting Boxee" or something like that and then it goes away.

2010-05-24T09:05:00.000Z	ontinsoldier	Ravahan	just from the looks of that, i don't think i have any clue whatsoever. but use pastebin. describe a little about your problem on one line, and include your pastebin link that has the error messages in your post to the channel
