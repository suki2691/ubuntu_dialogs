2005-10-24T13:11:00.000Z	aap		Hello, I'm looking for a distribution as a server and am interested in ubuntu. I saw ubuntu released a server build. Where can I read about this, and is it suited to run as server?
2005-10-24T13:11:00.000Z	nalioth	aap	it is debian based and functions as you wish it to (as a server)
2005-10-24T13:12:00.000Z	aap	nalioth	that is what I reasoned too. except, will there be security fixes as with debian? and saw leonel just pasted the release notes of it :)
