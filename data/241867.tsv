2008-02-09T05:15:00.000Z	theCarpenter		can anyone tell me how to change the editor that the 'edit' command calls?
2008-02-09T05:15:00.000Z	astro76	theCarpenter	sudo update-alternatives --config editor
2008-02-09T05:19:00.000Z	astro76	theCarpenter	oh whoops, it's editor as I mentioned in the command I gave, edit is something else entirely
2008-02-09T05:25:00.000Z	astro76	theCarpenter	man edit, it's not what you are after
