2007-02-21T16:04:00.000Z	Cam0		is there a way to trick apt into thinking a missing dependency is already installed?
2007-02-21T16:06:00.000Z	Cam0		a program i want to install (monodevelop) wants to install firefox, which i just uninstalled after switching to swiftfox
2007-02-21T16:06:00.000Z	mwe	Cam0	so will it hurt?
2007-02-21T16:07:00.000Z	mwe	Cam0	also I think uninstalling firefox might be a bad thing (TM) for some programs
