2006-08-21T14:34:00.000Z	poningru	prodigy60	you mean loop?
2006-08-21T14:35:00.000Z	prodigy60	poningru	 that sounds familiar, i think so... story goes i'm trying to get dvd::rip to work, and i have a folder on my win partition with all the dvd files, and would like to be able to mount the folder as the cdrom (like an iso in windows, sorta) so i can rip from it
