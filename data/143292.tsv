2007-03-12T09:46:00.000Z	Flannel	Chesney	CaptainMorgan, the LAMP ubuntu installs is still fully configurable.  It's not a package in and of itself, just an easy way to install Apache/PHP/SQL/etc
2007-03-12T09:48:00.000Z	Chesney	Flannel	CaptainMorgan, Yeah. Like I said, Flannel probably knows better then I do. I've never used Ubuntus LAMP. and have you checked the Apache error logs to see why it refuses to start again?
