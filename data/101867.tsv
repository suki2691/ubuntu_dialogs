2009-06-10T23:18:00.000Z	Joeseph		Hi.  I'm trying to follow this guide: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-30709.html to set up ssh private/pub key.   However, I'm in my server, but it has no .ssh folder.....  where do I go from here?

2009-06-10T23:19:00.000Z	Spike1506		?
2009-06-10T23:19:00.000Z	Joeseph	Spike1506	Yeah, I thought that ssh would have made that directory for me....
