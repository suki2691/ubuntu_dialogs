2009-10-01T09:36:00.000Z	corigo3		When I run sudo chmod 777 will it apply to all users? I don't see any change in permissions at the user level...
2009-10-01T09:37:00.000Z	Bluey	corigo3	-- if your intent is to allow all users to do anything they wish yes, but it only applies to the files you are changing
2009-10-01T09:39:00.000Z	corigo3	Bluey	after I run the sudo chmod all the permissions are updated, but from Krusader when I check the file permissions the change only happened for "owner" which is root.... so I still have no access at the user level
2009-10-01T09:40:00.000Z	Bluey	corigo3	privite message ok?
