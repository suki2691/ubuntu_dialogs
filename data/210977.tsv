2006-08-22T08:38:00.000Z	Sid	Anubuntu	assuming you have the latest engine patch, Cedega should have pre-defined settings for Half-Life 2 (and its ilk)
2006-08-22T09:43:00.000Z	Sid	Anubuntu	you mean, it doesn't do it automatically for ya?
2006-08-22T09:45:00.000Z	Sid	Anubuntu	sadly, this is where my expertise ends.
