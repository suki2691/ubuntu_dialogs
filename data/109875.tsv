2010-05-14T10:17:00.000Z	bjron	soreau	yea been poking around online a bit and in my .xsession-errors I'm seeing 'Failed to execute child process "/usr/bin/compiz.real"', which doesn't seem to exist anymore.  can I just delete any old sessions?
2010-05-14T10:17:00.000Z	soreau	bjron	Probably better to just do what I said ;)
2010-05-14T10:18:00.000Z	bjron	soreau	will give it a try, thanks
