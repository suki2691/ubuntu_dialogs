2006-12-21T11:03:00.000Z	DSG7777		This is a really odd issue, but I recently switched my icons to the OSX theme, and now all of a sudden when I get to the login screen, as soon as I type any character it crashes and says "The greeter has crashed, opening new greeter" or something similar, but that greeter crashes as soon as I type in a single character. anyone have any idea qhats going on? I cant even log on to change my settings around.

2006-12-21T11:07:00.000Z	mister_roboto	DSG7777	ok, so now all you gotta do is change it back manually :)   you're on your own there!
