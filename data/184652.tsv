2009-09-30T09:21:00.000Z	flying_penguin		ext4 has been pretty stable for a while imo
2009-09-30T09:21:00.000Z	flying_penguin		i would choose it over xfs really
2009-09-30T09:22:00.000Z	flying_penguin		but changing from ext3 to somthing new would be a huge headache if you want to keep your data
2009-09-30T09:22:00.000Z	kermit	flying_penguin	yeah not worth switching
