2010-07-25T04:33:00.000Z	octavio-rdz	ActionParsnip	yes I had that problem like a year ago .... it just stopped working after a windows update
2010-07-25T04:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	octavio-rdz	never had the issue as I dont use windows :)
2010-07-25T04:34:00.000Z	octavio-rdz	ActionParsnip	good point .... now I don't do dual booting but I used to .... now just Ubuntu
