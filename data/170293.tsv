2006-09-21T07:38:00.000Z	jim80104		I have a need to log in as root for something that I need to do.... Can anyone tell me how to do so?
2006-09-21T07:40:00.000Z	jim80104		I know all about sudo.... problem is, I need to actually be logged in as root, or this particular install will damage my profile.
