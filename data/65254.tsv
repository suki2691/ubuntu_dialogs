2009-02-28T04:50:00.000Z	hmw	godoshian	- you sure about FAT32? These days, you would be happy with NTFS in most cases, too.
2009-02-28T04:51:00.000Z	godoshian	hmw	well how do i defrag NTFS with ubuntu?
2009-02-28T04:52:00.000Z	hmw	godoshian	- uhm. You wouldnt usually defrag. Maybe with windows or even some Linux tool, but I dont know of any. Most people, I know, just copy the stuff to another partition/tape and then copy it back - e voila - defragged.
