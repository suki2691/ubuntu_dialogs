2010-02-07T16:46:00.000Z	Ujjain		Ok, I have 64-bits now :)
2010-02-07T16:46:00.000Z	Ujjain		I should have clicked Alternative download options, including Ubuntu installer for Windows :-P
2010-02-07T16:46:00.000Z	rww	Ujjain	because 32-bit works on both 32-bit and 64-bit computers, so it's a good safe bet for people who don't know the difference
