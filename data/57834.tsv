2009-12-02T05:45:00.000Z	G_S_SR		Please Help, ive installed ubuntu karmic, and everything worked perfectly. i updated through "update manager" and after a restart, my cpu is being used constantly. it wasnt like that before the update. ive even reformated and reinstalled ubuntu thinking it was something i did, with the same results. any suggestions?
2009-12-02T05:46:00.000Z	boss_mc	G_S_SR	what process is using the CPU?
