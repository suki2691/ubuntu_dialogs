2008-02-08T10:41:00.000Z	joecurlee		hi everyone, i am running ubuntu 7.10... installed dvd codecs via automatix... dvds play fine but no audio. I'm using an asus m2a-vm hdmi mother board with integrated ati graphics card
2008-02-08T10:41:00.000Z	joecurlee		any solutions would be very much appreciated :)
2008-02-08T10:42:00.000Z	mkquist	joecurlee	are we to assume that ur sound is good other than that?
2008-02-08T10:42:00.000Z	joecurlee	mkquist	yes sound worked fine-ish in test mode
