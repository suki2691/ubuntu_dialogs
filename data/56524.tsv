2010-03-06T08:47:00.000Z	patx		I installed Codeville by doing "sudo apt-get install codeville" but when I try to use the command "codeville" it says no such command. Why is this?
2010-03-06T08:47:00.000Z	SolarisBoy	patx	maybe the command to start it isn't codeville?
2010-03-06T08:48:00.000Z	patx	SolarisBoy	ok, but what would it be, i cant find any docs...
2010-03-06T08:49:00.000Z	patx	SolarisBoy	ok its cdv...
