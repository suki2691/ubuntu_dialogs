2010-11-13T13:11:00.000Z	StuartPB		I'm trying to set up Larch and the install script is failing with "/usr/bin/env: python2: No such file or directory". How can I get around this short of setting up a symlink?
2010-11-13T13:12:00.000Z	jep1985	StuartPB	do you have python installed?
2010-11-13T13:12:00.000Z	jep1985		sudo apt-get install python2.6
2010-11-13T13:12:00.000Z	StuartPB	jep1985	yep, and python2.6
