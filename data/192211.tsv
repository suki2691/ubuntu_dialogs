2008-01-02T02:43:00.000Z	Kasuko		I have my computer on all the time. Recently my friend has gone to Mexico and is out of contact except when she goes to internet cafe's. I use pidgin to have a buddy pounce that plays a song when she comes online. But Ubuntu seems to idle out and the buddy pounce initializes as she gets the sent message but no sound plays. How do I stop this?
