2009-03-19T22:09:00.000Z	Whitor	raven	there is video editing software for linux... take a look at ubuntustudio
2009-03-19T22:10:00.000Z	Whitor	raven	or ask in #ubuntustudio ... they are into this sort of thing ... they might have a better idea whats out there
2009-03-19T22:18:00.000Z	Whitor	raven	definately check out ubuntustudio .... you can add it on to regular Ubuntu through the synaptic manager
