2006-03-06T15:38:00.000Z	knubbe	nm	id like to try flight4 on my laptop. both kde and gnome. i run both on it now (breezy though).
2006-03-06T15:38:00.000Z	nm	knubbe	install ubuntu and kubuntu on seperate partitions, might be easier than crafting your own livecd
2006-03-06T15:39:00.000Z	knubbe	nm	but i dont want to install it, i just want to see if flight 4 works on my laptop.
