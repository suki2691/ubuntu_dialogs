2007-01-11T09:19:00.000Z	jobbe		hey everyone
2007-01-11T09:20:00.000Z	jobbe		Is there any way to disable acpi_video on boot (standard edy eft kernel)? It prevents my Samsung X60 from booting...
2007-01-11T09:20:00.000Z	jobbe		by disable I mean, is there a way to disable it without recompiling the kernel
2007-01-11T09:21:00.000Z	ikonia	jobbe	is there a boot option for it ? what point does it fail at ?
