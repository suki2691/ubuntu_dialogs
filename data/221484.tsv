2005-11-27T15:19:00.000Z	DrGamut		Totally off topic, anyone here particularly good with diagnosing strange network connectivity issues?
2005-11-27T15:20:00.000Z	Seveas	DrGamut	mii-diag, ethereal, netcat and ifconfig are your friends :)
2005-11-27T15:21:00.000Z	DrGamut	Seveas	I'm not knowledgeable enough to diagnose this, it's not a matter of tools it's a matter of knowing what to look for.
2005-11-27T15:22:00.000Z	Seveas	DrGamut	if you're around in 2 hours I can help you but I have to go in a few minutes
