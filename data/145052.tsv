2007-02-24T16:32:00.000Z	DinkyDogg		Hey. When I boot ubuntu on my desktop from the LiveCD, the screen is really glitchy. Streaked with colors and everything. Any way to modify my X configuration from the command line to try to make it work? I am a newbie and could use some help.

2007-02-24T16:35:00.000Z	DinkyDogg	pppoe_dude	I don't have linux installed yet. I'm trying to install from the liveCD. How can I edit the xorg.conf?
