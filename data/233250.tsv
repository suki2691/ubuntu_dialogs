2005-06-18T08:44:00.000Z	misfit-toy	thoreauputic	but it's not firestarter, it's something else, can't put my finger on it...I get a lag on any input, mouse, keybd, etc...like very 5 seconds
2005-06-18T08:44:00.000Z	thoreauputic	misfit-toy	hmmm... I don't know
2005-06-18T08:45:00.000Z	misfit-toy	thoreauputic	yeah, now firestarter is back to 4%, it was just checking shit...this is weird.
