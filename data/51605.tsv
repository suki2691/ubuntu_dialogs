2009-07-31T13:57:00.000Z	gman		Howdy, I am going to set up ubuntu or GOS Rocket linux on a usb drive and run it off the usb drive.  How long will the USB drive last?  will I burn it up in a month?  it will get a couple hours of use a day on the web, e-mail and thats about it.

2009-07-31T14:01:00.000Z	gman	phoenixandthor	do you know a brand or model that will last longer?
