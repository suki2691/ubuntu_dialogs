2009-01-11T01:53:00.000Z	TeleNubby		I've tried and tried to get Ubuntu working (details soon), and I've looked around and realized many people are experiencing the same problem as I am; the item we had in common was our graphics card. I've got an ATI RADEON XPRESS 200 Series.
2009-01-11T01:53:00.000Z	TeleNubby		I've install Ubuntu perfectly fine. I see the login screen, and when I attempt to login, the screen goes black-ish (as if it's going well), then after a few seconds it returns to the login screen. No error message is supplied.
2009-01-11T01:53:00.000Z	TeleNubby		Any ideas?
