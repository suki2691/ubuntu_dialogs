2007-09-12T08:42:00.000Z	MrDeadLock		Is there a way to make a LOG file, POST to a HTML file every 10-20 seconds, So that i'd be able to remotely watch certain log files, from my ntework and just see a compilation of log files in a html document.
2007-09-12T08:43:00.000Z	praet	MrDeadLock	cat -v logfile > html.htm
2007-09-12T08:43:00.000Z	praet	MrDeadLock	i would make a php script that pulled the data out at page refresh
2007-09-12T08:44:00.000Z	MrDeadLock	praet	Is there any guide or help, that i might start learning how to do that?
