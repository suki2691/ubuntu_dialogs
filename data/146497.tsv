2011-11-18T00:46:00.000Z	Nostoc		I am fresh installing a new ubuntu/windows dual boot.  What order should I install them in?  Windows first?  Also, I am planning to have a paging file partition, an ext3 (ubuntu) partition, an NTFS partition (XP), and a storage partition.  Should I use gparted, fdisk, or windows set up disk to partition these?  Just looking for recommendations, thanks.
