2012-02-03T22:56:00.000Z	TheExplorer		Greetings fellow ubuntu users, I have a 2 quick questions: firstly i backed up my old harddrive in a single *.tar.gz format, attempting to open the file and extract it is EXTREMELY slow, is there any way to write an index to speed up the process?
2012-02-03T22:57:00.000Z	TheExplorer		Dear "theadmin", the file is so big that i cannot extract it at once for a lack of space. I wish to recover select files.
2012-02-03T22:59:00.000Z	TheExplorer		Secondly does anyone know of an "all in one" file explorer, or know of how i would go about setting nautilus to do that. I wish to view all files without folders to recover scattered various documents.
