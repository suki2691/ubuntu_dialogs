2009-06-13T17:22:00.000Z	TheSavageSam		Can you help me? It seems like my hard disk is full and almost nothing works. I don't know how can I maintenance that disk. All the processes also seem to be "Sleeping" when I check System Monitor.

2009-06-13T17:26:00.000Z	TheSavageSam	Pirate_Hunter_	I don't know how to do that. :( I have just tried press del on the files, but doesn't seem to help.
2009-06-13T17:27:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter_	TheSavageSam	ok no problem first you say the disk is full fair enough but that doesnt explain why you can delete anything, so what exactly happened, did you install anything, delete system file or any files. The more info you give the easier it would be for others to help you
