2004-11-16T14:43:00.000Z	hojit		I am intrested in ubuntu and want to get peoples oppenions on the sata support
2004-11-16T14:44:00.000Z	bwlang	hojit	sata is in the kernel... so i don't think its support will vary by distribution.
2004-11-16T14:44:00.000Z	bwlang	hojit	since warty uses a recent kernel i suspect it'll work fint.
2004-11-16T14:46:00.000Z	bwlang	hojit	i'm not 100% sure but it don't think it makes any sense to load a low level driver like for a hard drive  as a module... anybody have a link with the warty kernel .config ?
