2006-05-04T13:13:00.000Z	oblib	william__	the sudoers file allows you to execute a file without typing your password everytime
2006-05-04T13:14:00.000Z	oblib	william__	if your script is "/usr/bin/hello" than putting this line in /etc/sudoers will let you run it without a password:   [yourusername]  ALL= PASSWD:ALL, NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/hello
