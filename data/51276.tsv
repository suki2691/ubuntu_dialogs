2012-04-26T21:12:00.000Z	Monotoko		hmm... why is my update keeping some back?  :( I would quite like those wallpapers, I'm on beta2 http://pastebin.com/unjQWNkX
2012-04-26T21:13:00.000Z	trism	Monotoko	you need to: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade; (the ubuntu-wallpapers were split out into ubuntu-wallpapers-precise, so it needs to install a new package)
2012-04-26T21:14:00.000Z	Monotoko	trism	that did it! Thank you
