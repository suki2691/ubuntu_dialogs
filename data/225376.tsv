2005-10-30T07:12:00.000Z	Hobbsee	zblach	see if everything's mounted where it's supposed to, as the fstab shows it should be?
2005-10-30T07:14:00.000Z	Hobbsee	zblach	what were you wanting to test?  as in, if a particular drive is mounted?
2005-10-30T07:16:00.000Z	Hobbsee	zblach	right, not sure how you'd test that
