2006-08-21T07:27:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Thunderpants	Yes. I have a SATA disk and a core duo and it works fine
2006-08-21T07:28:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Thunderpants	Just one word of advice: If you go with 6.06 (and not 6.06.1) make sure you update the kernel (there were some fixes - it was very disappointing without those updates )
2006-08-21T07:28:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Thunderpants	It was something related to the CPU - it has been fixed though :)
