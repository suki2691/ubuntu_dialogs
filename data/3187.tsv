2012-05-19T15:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	snapdata	 swap is easy to remake.  /boot/ would only get made if you told it to. If your linux install is using  its own /boot/ then id say its a left over from some other install
2012-05-19T15:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	snapdata	 you could image your linux install to a file. and use it as a vbox hard drive image ;) so you can still run it.
2012-05-19T15:51:00.000Z	snapdata	Dr_Willis	that's true.
