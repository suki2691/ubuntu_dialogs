2007-02-08T16:13:00.000Z	yanger		hello, having problems with updating ubuntu edgy with apt-get dist-upgrade or aptitude dist-upgrade - it's telling me that linux-image-generic and linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-11-generic are broken ;/ aptitude wants to remove all of the kernels, and apt-get doesn't want to do anything now.. any ideas on how to fix?
