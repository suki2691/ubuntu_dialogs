2006-07-18T14:36:00.000Z	styleuk	RvGaTe	anything else I can try before I reinstall windows? Again. ^_^
2006-07-18T14:40:00.000Z	RvGaTe	styleuk	you dont have to reinstall it...
2006-07-18T14:40:00.000Z	RvGaTe	styleuk	you just gotta sort out your boot records (there are 2 actually)
2006-07-18T14:41:00.000Z	styleuk	RvGaTe	well i cant get back to windows, seeing as grub refuses to load my partition, it's ha0,0 no other place it can be surely unless it's been moved by ubuntu during the installtion and that in itself is a high improbability
