2008-08-10T16:04:00.000Z	trupheenix	faileas	yea... but the weird part about this card under gutsy is 1) my wireless led doesn't work 2) it doesn't connect to all routers ie. in my head office it worked, in my office it didn't work, at home also it didn't work but it's working right now in the airport lol
2008-08-10T16:04:00.000Z	faileas	trupheenix	hmm.. i'm thinking the encryption for some reason
2008-08-10T16:05:00.000Z	trupheenix	faileas	all are WPA encrypted networks. no difference. just the routers are different. at my office and at home i'm using Linksys and in the airport it's a Dlink router
