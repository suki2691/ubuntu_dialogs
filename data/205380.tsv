2005-12-15T17:00:00.000Z	jcaine		hi all - I was wondering if anyone knows how to reduce the bass sounds in ubuntu? (I'm using totem/xine for media playback)
2005-12-15T17:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	jcaine	try maybe alsamixer (run in the terminal)
2005-12-15T17:03:00.000Z	jcaine	HappyFool	- I've tried that but it only allows me to control volume output levels rather than equalize various bandwidths :(
2005-12-15T17:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	jcaine	mplayer has an equalizer
