2006-10-02T05:33:00.000Z	seamus7		Hi. I have a simple question about installing programs. I downloaded a newer version of Azuerues from its website and extracted the archive. Where am I supposed to put the directory or any program directory for that matter?
2006-10-02T05:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	seamus7	 ive found it easir to install azuerus on a 'per user' basis.. ie. let the user install it to their own home dir.. not systemwide.
2006-10-02T05:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	seamus7	 that way it can auto-update
2006-10-02T05:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	seamus7	 i wouldent use the ubuntu version at all.
