2005-07-25T06:07:00.000Z	OdiiN		can i set up swap  memory into a normal folder, nor in a separate partition?
2005-07-25T06:07:00.000Z	nalioth	OdiiN	i believe only a partition
2005-07-25T06:09:00.000Z	OdiiN	nalioth	any utility to split the ext3 partition where ubuntu is installed into 2 separate to allow swap ?
2005-07-25T06:09:00.000Z	nalioth	OdiiN	yes, qtparted or gparted (both frontends to parted)
