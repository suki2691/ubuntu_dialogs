2005-12-21T10:48:00.000Z	gtk2	mz2	heh, BMPx is much more than that ;)
2005-12-21T10:50:00.000Z	mz2	gtk2	well yes, admittedly, but if you want to cut it down to a few words that's how i'd put it to an xmms user
2005-12-21T10:50:00.000Z	gtk2	mz2	aye, expecially considering BMPx is in heavey devel and inst openly available unless you deliberately seek i out.
