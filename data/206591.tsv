2007-12-17T09:07:00.000Z	paradox		Question: I've got a WD Passport external hard drive that is (only intermitently) being recognized by my xubuntu install. How do I stop it so that I can disconnect it?
2007-12-17T09:08:00.000Z	paradox		Thank you Severed Cross. I can't believe I didn't see that.
2007-12-17T09:10:00.000Z	paradox		question: how come I wasn't able to see my external HD in /mnt or /tmp/media in xubuntu?
2007-12-17T09:11:00.000Z	sethk	paradox	because it will be in /media
