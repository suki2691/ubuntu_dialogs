2007-05-05T05:41:00.000Z	lbawinowns		since I don't think my space has increased even tough I've deleted a couple of files
2007-05-05T05:42:00.000Z	Gerro	lbawinowns	you would have to "move" stuff to the recycling bin not delete it
2007-05-05T05:43:00.000Z	lbawinowns	Gerro	what happen if I just press delete button?
