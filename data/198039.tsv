2006-04-13T11:00:00.000Z	DrawLt		I can't connect to ubuntu 5.10 from OS X 10.4.6 using connect to server.  I have shared a folder from my home dir in ubuntu and have set up "shared folders" in system>admin, OS X asks for a password when I try to connect to smb://etc... but then I get an error 43 from OS X
