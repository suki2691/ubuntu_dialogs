2008-09-09T19:28:00.000Z	sysdoc		Is there an up to date install howto for 8.04? The partition editor does not have a partition resize option.
2008-09-09T19:29:00.000Z	capnhector	sysdoc	 i use an external partition manager like gparted
2008-09-09T19:29:00.000Z	capnhector		@ sysdoc then install my system
2008-09-09T19:30:00.000Z	sysdoc	capnhector	I'm up and in gparted, won't allow me to resize here either
