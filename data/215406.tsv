2008-02-14T18:11:00.000Z	decko		Hi guys! I'm having a problem with my sound card. I have a X40 IBM, and it's a Centrino plataform
2008-02-14T18:12:00.000Z	decko		I bought it with Gutsy, and the sound is working, but now that I've updated to Hardy, the sound stops working...
2008-02-14T18:12:00.000Z	decko		Someone knows something about this?
2008-02-14T18:12:00.000Z	soundray	decko	please ask in #ubuntu+1 about hardy problems
