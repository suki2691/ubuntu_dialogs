If I forget the syntax or include files for a function,  say printf,  then I type "man printf" from the command line, and the man page for printf comes up.   But it seems that the man pages for most of the linux / unix api functions are missing.  I would like to be able to do "man gethostname" and get the documentation for the C function,  gethostname
