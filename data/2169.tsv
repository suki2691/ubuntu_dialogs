2012-07-02T02:00:00.000Z	fe80	kristenB	linux is build on the idea of modules that can be restarted when needed. windows for the most part does not allow most important fiels to be changed while the operating system is running so it does that when it is booting

2012-07-02T02:03:00.000Z	fe80	kristenB	yes
