2010-06-26T01:25:00.000Z	augustl		can someone point me to a guide to creating a bootable usb stick for ubuntu 10.04 64 bit? Neither unetbootin or the usb-creator (running on Arch Linux) seems to create a bootable stick.

2010-06-26T01:26:00.000Z	augustl	pianohacker	yeah, that's how I installed Arch in the first place
