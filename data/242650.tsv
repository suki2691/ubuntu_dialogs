2007-04-23T11:14:00.000Z	Artemis3		is the supertux package compiled without sdl? it seems --sdl gives an error :(
2007-04-23T11:15:00.000Z	crimsun	Artemis3	no, supertux depends on libsdl1.2-debian and libsdl-image1.2
2007-04-23T11:16:00.000Z	crimsun	Artemis3	meaning "yes", it's compiled with SDL support.
2007-04-23T11:16:00.000Z	Artemis3	crimsun	ok, can you try the --sdl switch?
