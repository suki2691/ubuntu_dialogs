2009-08-29T01:35:00.000Z	Out_Cold	AvonGenesis	pulseaudio and alsa work together..
2009-08-29T01:35:00.000Z	AvonGenesis	Out_Cold	They do o.o, who do i have different playback devices? one named alsa and one named pulse audio?
2009-08-29T01:36:00.000Z	Out_Cold	AvonGenesis	i think pulse is more of a interpreter for applications where alsa is the actual sound app
