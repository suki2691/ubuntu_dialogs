2010-05-12T09:31:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Avasz	that upgrades don't usually work out as smoothly as a clean install, imho
2010-05-12T09:31:00.000Z	Avasz	onetinsoldier	oh... thats bad
2010-05-12T09:33:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Avasz	you can always.. back up everything, then try an upgrade and see how it works out
