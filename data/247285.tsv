2009-06-30T11:20:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	wildc4rd	Change the settings in grub => /boot/grub/menu.lst => add "textonly" or remove the bit that says "silent"
2009-06-30T11:25:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	wildc4rd	If you read through the info in the beginning of the "menu.lst" you'll see what I mean - otherwise, remove the "silent" bit at the end of the kernel boot towards the bottom of the file
2009-06-30T11:29:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	wildc4rd	Yeah. Remove
