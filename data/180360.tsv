2012-03-20T17:09:00.000Z	Zaitzev		uhm, the top bar and sidebar (Unity) just disappeared/closed/crashed. How do I get them back? lol..
2012-03-20T17:09:00.000Z	ome	Zaitzev	`unity --reset &` should help.
2012-03-20T17:11:00.000Z	ome	Zaitzev	well, you can close the terminal and reopen it without killing unity.
2012-03-20T17:12:00.000Z	ome	Zaitzev	you can always try that sort of things in run (alt+F2), you miss out on the response/possible-erros though.
