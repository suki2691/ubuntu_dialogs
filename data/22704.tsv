2010-11-14T21:24:00.000Z	Nikki_		Hi Everyone, I had a quick question.  I wanted to install ubuntu server to use as a file server/media server (for my ps3).  I currently have Windows 7 with data I want to keep on it.  Can I install ubuntu without formatting?

2010-11-14T21:25:00.000Z	Nikki_	Dr_Willis	- thanks.  I will probably just backuip and install.  less risk!
