2006-09-18T11:53:00.000Z	Juftus		Hello! I'm running a Xubuntu box and may want to switch to Ubuntu. Just ensuring: it'll be enough to install ubuntu-desktop, right?
2006-09-18T11:53:00.000Z	Flannel	Juftus	yes
2006-09-18T11:57:00.000Z	Juftus	cafuego	& Flannel: Thx. I might want to keep xubuntu-desktop as well, but if I opted to remove it, would it be better to do a new installation or just remove some packages? (More or less all data on the hard disk can be safely deleted, so backups would be no pain.)
