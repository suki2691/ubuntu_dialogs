2012-01-10T13:31:00.000Z	CharminTheMoose	llutz	I have no idea. But I can get other distros auto connected to the 'net, so I doubt it's a problem with qemu.
2012-01-10T13:32:00.000Z	CharminTheMoose	llutz	no, it doesn't. :/
2012-01-10T13:34:00.000Z	CharminTheMoose	llutz	yeah, that's my point. I can ping the gateway that qemu virtualises.. but I can't get past the virtual gateway and onto the 'net.
