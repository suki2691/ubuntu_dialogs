2010-04-29T07:02:00.000Z	LucidGuy		Is there a way to specify a password with an ssh command.  Example  "ssh root@computer ls /"  <--  the system will prompt for password I want to include it within the command.  (I know this is not safe, will input the password from a script)
2010-04-29T07:03:00.000Z	Myrtti	LucidGuy	no. You can try to set up keys to login though
2010-04-29T07:04:00.000Z	LucidGuy	Myrtti	I would prefer to not set up keys
2010-04-29T07:04:00.000Z	Myrtti	LucidGuy	then you are out of luck.
