2011-02-19T20:21:00.000Z	Guest63854		can someone let me know if I will suffer significantly worse performance on a notebook if I install the full ubuntu edition on it rather than the netbook version ?

2011-02-19T20:23:00.000Z	Guest63854	juk	I am suffering at the moment with very odd redraw issues with the netbook version, so was thinking of junking it and going to std build
