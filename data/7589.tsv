2012-05-09T18:45:00.000Z	UICTamale		hey all, I'm frustrated at the lack of responsiveness in Ubuntu 12.04 running unity and the open-source radeon drivers.  I tried fglrx, but dual-monitor support is completely broken, let alone triple monitor.  Is there any hope of having a snappy, responsive ubuntu 12.04 system with 3 monitors?
2012-05-09T18:46:00.000Z	elijah	UICTamale	Yeah, use proprietary drivers - :)

2012-05-09T18:55:00.000Z	UICTamale	elijah	I tried the fglrx drivers.  Upping the virtual desktop size so I could do multiple monitors caused a segfault in the driver.
