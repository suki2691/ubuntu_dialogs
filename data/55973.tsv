2009-07-04T23:41:00.000Z	Apollo2366	budo	are you looking to modify the CD or to just save/manipulate files on other media?
2009-07-04T23:43:00.000Z	Apollo2366	budo	yeah, you can. There's no difference in that and doing it within the OS.
2009-07-04T23:45:00.000Z	Apollo2366	budo	oh. Well I don't know then. I suppose you'd have to change where terminal pulls the environment variables from first...
