2011-05-08T14:49:00.000Z	AndrewEMT		Anyone know how I can install 32-bit hal into my 64-but Ubuntu 11.04?
2011-05-08T14:49:00.000Z	AndrewEMT		I dl'd a package and it gave me a wrong architecture error
2011-05-08T14:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	AndrewEMT	 im not even sure that will fix your wine issues..  You might want to check the ubuntu forums and the askubuntu.com site
2011-05-08T14:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	AndrewEMT	 hal is being removed (or allready removed) from ubuntu.
