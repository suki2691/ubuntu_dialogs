2010-05-19T05:58:00.000Z	shadmego	Jordan_U	I tried removing the splash parameter and got a similar, though different error. I am not in front of the machine anymore so I can't repeat that particular error
2010-05-19T06:09:00.000Z	shadmego	Jordan_U	I was wrong. When removing the "splash" kernel parameter, the same error message comes up - init: plymouth-splash main process (#) terminated with status 1
