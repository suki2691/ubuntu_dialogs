2008-08-04T07:18:00.000Z	Kaspersky_		what kind of partition should swap be, primary or logical?\
2008-08-04T07:19:00.000Z	Kaspersky_		location?
2008-08-04T07:19:00.000Z	Kaspersky_		should it be at the beginning or the end?
2008-08-04T07:19:00.000Z	cellofellow	Kaspersky_	my swap is logical and since I never actually use it I don't notice any performance loss. My /home is logical too and I don't notice any performance loss. I'd say it doesn't matter
