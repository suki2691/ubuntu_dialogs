2012-10-26T00:02:00.000Z	Ampersand		Hi everyone, I'd like to ask a question. Since I've upgraded from 12.04 to 12.10, all the time when I shut down or reboot the computer, the "Ubuntu 12.10" splash screen fills up with text like "Asking all remaining processes to terminate [OK], Mail transport agent postfix [OK]" and it continues... The shut down/restart goes on without any problem, however, I'd like not to see this text if possible. Could you please tell me if anything can be done about this?

2012-10-26T00:05:00.000Z	Ampersand		I've been doing some reading on the internet and found this: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT... but being related to booting/GRUB, I'm not so sure it's safe to use
