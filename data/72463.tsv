2010-05-06T23:51:00.000Z	jshriver		how can I compile a kernel module in Ubuntu using the native Ubuntu kernel. Have done it years ago by grabbing the source from kernel.org but dont want to break my system
2010-05-06T23:53:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jshriver	just download the Ubuntu kernel source package is all i think you need. you might want to learn how to use the 'make-kpkg' package
2010-05-06T23:54:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	jshriver	oops, look like i have make-kpkg wrong. i'm kind of rusty myself
