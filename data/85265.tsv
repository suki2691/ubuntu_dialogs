2008-08-16T04:44:00.000Z	FAJALOU1		i am trying to see all of the windows share in ubuntu.  Currently i have to go to smb://down/users to see the share, but i used to be able to just navigate to smb://down and everything would show up...  How can i make it so that everything thing shared on the downstairs is viewable to me under smb://down?
