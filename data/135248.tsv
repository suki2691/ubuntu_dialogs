2009-05-20T11:28:00.000Z	ziroday	niblets_	we can't help you with unofficial ubuntu derivatives here. Sorry.
2009-05-20T11:29:00.000Z	ziroday	niblets_	no it is _not_ ubuntu, it has added repo's and who knows what else. And we therefore cannot support it here. Please use crunchbang's support channels
