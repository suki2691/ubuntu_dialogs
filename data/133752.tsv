2007-10-19T21:48:00.000Z	Moduliz0r		Can anyone help me? I'm following http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=25911, but there is nothing for eth1 (my Wireless adapter) in /etc/network/interfaces...
2007-10-19T21:48:00.000Z	PovAddict	Moduliz0r	what about eth0?
2007-10-19T21:49:00.000Z	Moduliz0r	PovAddict	it's not in there either
2007-10-19T21:49:00.000Z	Moduliz0r	PovAddict	But that doesn't matter, because eth0 is unplugged
