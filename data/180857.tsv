2006-09-15T11:47:00.000Z	toaks		so have you configured your network using the command line before?
2006-09-15T11:47:00.000Z	billybennett	toaks	yes and no.. I've learned how to do it from using Backtrack a Slackware live cd.. but I use gnome-network-manager for the WPA2 support
2006-09-15T11:48:00.000Z	billybennett	toaks	whats the correct way to do DHCP.. I learned dhcpcd but that doesnt work in Ubuntu
