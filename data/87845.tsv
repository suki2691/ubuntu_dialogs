2008-06-12T07:24:00.000Z	Starnestommy	c4lman	autogen.sh normally automatically generates the ./configure script
2008-06-12T07:26:00.000Z	Starnestommy	c4lman	autogen.sh doesn't need to be run if the ./configure and Makefile.in files are there
2008-06-12T07:27:00.000Z	c4lman	Starnestommy	I see thanks
