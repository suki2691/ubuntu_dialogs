2008-12-05T16:49:00.000Z	wiehan		this is ubuntu related, as I need to do this correctly before installing ubuntu - I am a n00b, so please help: I want to create a backup with Norton Ghost of a HD onto a external HD which has a fat32 partition, will ghost automatically create the .gho files so that it will not exceed FAT32's stupid 4gb file limit?
2008-12-05T16:49:00.000Z	GColley	wiehan	Yes, it should
2008-12-05T16:51:00.000Z	wiehan	GColley	Wihtout changing any settings (cause I looked everywhere and can't seem to find the place where I can split the files tp 4gb max) - I think this is possible through a command line interface.. So you are sure it would work without me touching a single setting?
2008-12-05T16:53:00.000Z	GColley	wiehan	Are you trying to back-up just the partition or the entire drive?
