2007-08-23T16:34:00.000Z	tyler_		Has anyone here managed to actually get a Chaintech AV-710 working? I've been trying desperalty to get it working properly. It seems I can any one of:  Sound to SPDIF, More than one app playing sound at the same time, OSS emulation working, but not more than 1 at the same time. This shouldn't be that hard.

2007-08-23T16:34:00.000Z	tyler_	macd	I am using alsa. 7.04 install fresh off the CD
2007-08-23T16:35:00.000Z	macd	tyler_	well, if you head on over to alsa-project.org they have a pretty good troubleshooting guide along with some scripts that dump enough info to let us better diagnose the problem
