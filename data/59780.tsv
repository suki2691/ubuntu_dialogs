2009-05-15T09:27:00.000Z	Matz		I have recently installed UNR 9.04 on my netbook with a ssd drive. When I boot I see that Ubuntu uses ext3 as file system. Shouldn't I use the ext2 instead of ext3 on my netbook with ssd?
2009-05-15T09:27:00.000Z	lstarnes	Matz	ext3 should work
2009-05-15T09:28:00.000Z	Matz	lstarnes	Yeah, but Linpus Lite the original system used ext2?
2009-05-15T09:31:00.000Z	lstarnes	Matz	it would probably not have much of a difference
