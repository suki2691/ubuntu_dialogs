If I want fast and secure file sharing between my Ubuntu machines, should I keep using Samba, or should I install something else alongside? (And if so, what would you recommend?)

2005-02-05T12:28:00.000Z	TreadingSoftly	emanuelez	ssh is great... but how can i use it to open up a file on my desktop web server for editing in gedit or screem or quanta on my laptop? So far I only have experience with puttying into my Ubuntu desktop.
