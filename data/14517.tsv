2011-10-14T00:38:00.000Z	B0g4r7		Can any of y'all recommend a good GUI tool (for X11) to aid in the comparison of changes between two large source trees?  Something like Beyond Compare did on Windows...

2011-10-14T00:39:00.000Z	mongo	B0g4r7	diff
2011-10-14T00:40:00.000Z	B0g4r7	mongo	uh, yeah, diff only seems to handle a single pair of files at once.  I need to compare big trass of thousands of files each.
