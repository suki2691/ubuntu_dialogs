2008-07-27T08:56:00.000Z	lonejack	Kohlrak	chipset compatibility no problem amd-64 or core duo... doesn't care?
2008-07-27T08:57:00.000Z	Kohlrak	lonejack	I'm guess it won't have a problem, i have an AMD Athlon (dual core) on my laptop here ,and my only problem is sometimes my video card and my audio card, which are seperate issues
