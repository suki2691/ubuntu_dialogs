2011-12-21T10:03:00.000Z	macguges		Please help, I made a bad mistake just now. I've just overwritten an ntfs partition I had intended to backup, running ntfsclone --overwrite with the devices backwards.
2011-12-21T10:03:00.000Z	macguges		Can I recover any of the data?

2011-12-21T10:05:00.000Z	macguges	DrPenguin	thanks, I'll look into that!
