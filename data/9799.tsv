2012-10-11T11:25:00.000Z	extropy		can anyone tell me if my wireless card just fried itself out: clicked "Disable Wireless" because I was on an airplane ... now it's gone ... dmesg says "BIOS says wireless lan is blocked ..." .... wtf?!?!
2012-10-11T11:26:00.000Z	extropy		no wlan0 in ifconfig ... no option to "Enable Wireless" in nm-app
2012-10-11T11:27:00.000Z	yekoms	extropy	do you have a on/off switch for wifi?
2012-10-11T11:27:00.000Z	yekoms	extropy	well if BIOS is saying something about wireless, what does BIOS show for wireless?
