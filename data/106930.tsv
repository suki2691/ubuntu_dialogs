2009-03-09T20:11:00.000Z	animenoyume		I can't hear anything with my headphones (I can hear with my loudspeaker). My headphones model is C-MEDIA TH-300MV. I can't hear any music file, even though I hear the sound after the system boot. The headphones are connected through USB. I've tried to change the USB place, but it didn't work. According to my friend, changing Alsa to -1 didn't help.
