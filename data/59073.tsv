2009-04-26T07:34:00.000Z	Imaginal		Installed 9.04 and sound worked for serveral restarts. Now it is gone. Volume is up. Any help?
2009-04-26T07:35:00.000Z	PcTek9	Imaginal	:  my sound doesn't work either
2009-04-26T07:35:00.000Z	PcTek9	Imaginal	: but the new log in screen is beautiful
2009-04-26T07:36:00.000Z	Imaginal	PcTek9	I agree, but it *used* to work. Not much changed... it is pretty though
