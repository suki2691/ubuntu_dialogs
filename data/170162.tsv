2006-08-22T09:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	vciaglia	Updated and fixed xserver-xorg-core packages has been uploaded. It is now safe to upgrade the  system with 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade'. To make sure that your mirror has the new version do 'sudo apt-get update' then 'apt-cache policy  xserver-xorg-core' and check that the candidate is 1:1.0.2-0ubuntu10.4
2006-08-22T09:28:00.000Z	vciaglia	erUSUL	thank you very much. I'm going to check
2006-08-22T09:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	vciaglia	no problem
