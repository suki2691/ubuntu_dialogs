2009-10-30T09:43:00.000Z	eday		Hi! I was wondering how to get the "expert mode" installer in ubuntu-9.10-desktop-amd64.iso. Doesn't seem to be obvious in boot options.
2009-10-30T09:44:00.000Z	Lint	eday	press F6 on the boot screen
2009-10-30T09:45:00.000Z	eday	Lint	I did, not an option. Just ACPI settings and free-sw only
2009-10-30T09:46:00.000Z	Lint	eday	it could be because you have live-cd version? and no, even in expert mode you cannot choose which packages tyo install
