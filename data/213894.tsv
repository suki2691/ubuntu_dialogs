2008-12-15T11:45:00.000Z	rdw200169	tonyyarusso	i want to nip a problem in the butt before it gets out of hand, and too many people are dealing with dead thumb drives, make sense?
2008-12-15T11:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	rdw200169	Perhaps, but I doubt the thumb drive will die before a) the user loses it, b) the user decides they'd rather just get the new 16TB drive that came out or whatever, c) the OS on it is so obsolete they can't use it and can't be bothered to install yet again, that sort of thing.  Seems overhyped, in short.
