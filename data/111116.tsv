2011-11-26T02:37:00.000Z	dj_who		Ubuntu 11.10 DVB-t card: MD95700 modules seems to load properly, femon and tzap showing than are  about 40% siglan 100%snr  ber andunc are "0" but when i'm trying to watch in vlc i get "scrambled" picture.
2011-11-26T02:37:00.000Z	dj_who		What is interesting that on the top of the picture i see "good" picsels. So i no for example what station is playing now, also i try to record TS stream and play it on windows and it is broken , so i know that TS decoding is working properly. Femon saying: status SCVYL | signal  45% | snr 100% | ber 0 | unc 0 | FE_HAS_LOCK
