2009-10-22T09:35:00.000Z	cedriczg	scunizi	That would work if it is on a pATH for locate. But it seems he has no boot folder...
2009-10-22T09:35:00.000Z	cedriczg	scunizi	and that would get him the menu.lst from his live CD
2009-10-22T09:35:00.000Z	scunizi	cedriczg	oh.. that would make a difference..
