2010-11-17T05:16:00.000Z	deinspanjer		Hey guys, I'm trying to walk my dad through opening up a terminal prompt so I can run ifconfig to see why he has no net connection..
2010-11-17T05:17:00.000Z	deinspanjer		I can't figure out where the Terminal app entry is on his "start menu"..
2010-11-17T05:17:00.000Z	deinspanjer		I don't have an Ubuntu desktop handy at the moment. Could anyone tell me where it is in the menu hierarchy?  i.e. Start | Tools | Terminal prompt
