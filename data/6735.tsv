2012-10-04T12:34:00.000Z	Martell	lotuspsychje	i have tried everything from testdisk until EaseUS partition manager, theyre failed. guess i have to giveup and believe my windows 7 is gone
2012-10-04T12:36:00.000Z	Martell	lotuspsychje	unless you can help me guide me, its worth to try, im tired of trying for weeks
