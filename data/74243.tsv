2008-11-15T17:31:00.000Z	nerovengene	markginter31	hmm not yet.. thats a good idea.. but should I download dependencies too then?
2008-11-15T17:32:00.000Z	markginter31	nerovengene	-- use the package installer and it should fetch the dependencies that it can.  If it can't -- then maybe set a temporary line in your sources.list file.  Risky -- but if you *need* the file you may be willing to risk it.
