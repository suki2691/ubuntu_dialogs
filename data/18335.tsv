2011-12-21T10:53:00.000Z	Metroshica		I'm trying to find out how much memory I'm using now. When I log in, my MOTD says I'm only using about 30%. When I run free -m, it says I have 1729 used out of 1750, with only 21 mbs free. However, it says 875 mbs is cached. How much memory is in use then, should I be worried that I'm almsot running out of memory?
