2009-09-03T12:27:00.000Z	Redkid		Hello there, anyone feeling helpful? Trying to install Ubuntu, getting a GRUB install failure with code 1.
2009-09-03T12:28:00.000Z	Redkid		Err, I have not yet install GRUB at all
2009-09-03T12:29:00.000Z	Redkid		I have one sata drive with a ntfs partition without any os, which is sda1, and then I have about 10gb of free space to install Ubuntu. Isn't Ubuntu trying to install GRUB itself?
