2007-01-05T16:01:00.000Z	asfalt	das-q	thats a good question i was wondering the same myself, thinking theonly solution was to save keys for hosts, but i would like some kind of bookmark functionality
2007-01-05T16:02:00.000Z	das-q	asfalt	I'm sure I've read something about saving bookmarks for ssh, like "ssh somebox"
2007-01-05T16:02:00.000Z	asfalt	das-q	i see i see, i never ended up finding any app for it, i shall look again
