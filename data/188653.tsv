I'm guessing "quiet" suppresses some of the output, and "splash" throws up a splash screen, but doesn't "ro" usually stand for "read-only"?  What is it making read-only, and why?

2008-06-22T03:06:00.000Z	eimajenthat	nickrud	why does it start it read-only?  Not complaining or anything, just curious
