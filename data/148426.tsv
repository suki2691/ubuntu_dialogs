2007-01-20T06:42:00.000Z	drstrangenorm		leoblool: you can also do it by double clicking on the file and go to props, and click the allow executing file as program check box
2007-01-20T06:43:00.000Z	drstrangenorm		leoblool: you might also want to go and install automatix, i think that program will handle installing it as well.
2007-01-20T06:43:00.000Z	ubotwo	drstrangenorm	leobloo1: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
