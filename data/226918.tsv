2007-05-17T09:26:00.000Z	CB21114		does anybody know why my system clock would run slow? It's happening on Fedora and Ubuntu but not on my XP (all in the same computer)
2007-05-17T09:27:00.000Z	variant	CB21114	you can keep it up to date with ntp, right click on the clock in the panel and select preferences
2007-05-17T09:27:00.000Z	variant	CB21114	and sync with time servers
2007-05-17T09:27:00.000Z	variant	CB21114	then it's not working properly
