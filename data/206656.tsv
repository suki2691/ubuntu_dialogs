2007-12-10T01:27:00.000Z	IanLiu		I am getting crazy with this bug... Whenever I press the "Log off, switch user [...]" button, my X crashes... I can't interact with anything... So I must restart X with Ctrl + Alt + Backspace... Any tips? Anyone experiencing the same problem?

2007-12-10T01:28:00.000Z	IanLiu	sethk	Ok, I will see
