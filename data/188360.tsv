2006-11-17T16:51:00.000Z	Some_Person		Can I set Ubuntu to not show volume labels and show the folder they're mounted to like Breezy did?
2006-11-17T16:53:00.000Z	Some_Person		For example, if a partition is mounted to /media/hda1 it shows the volume label (in this case, LOCAL DISK); can I set it to show hda1?
