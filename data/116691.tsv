2007-10-20T02:25:00.000Z	Jhs		repeat: so, i upgraded to 7.10, now it won't boot in 2.6.14-22, only in 2.6.16-20. any suggestions?
2007-10-20T02:26:00.000Z	SkinnyPuppy34	Jhs	boot into .20, then enter synaptic and find the .22 kernel and choose reinstall. hopefully .22 will work on reboot but if not .20 obviously does
2007-10-20T02:27:00.000Z	Jhs	SkinnyPuppy34	okay, thanks. will try.
2007-10-20T02:27:00.000Z	SkinnyPuppy34	Jhs	should be pretty straight forward
