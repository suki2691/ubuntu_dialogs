2011-12-05T08:55:00.000Z	atdiehm_lappy	xangua	so is it a known issue then? something about newer ipods that none are syncing with the default apps?
2011-12-05T09:00:00.000Z	atdiehm_lappy	xangua	just makes me wonder... I push ubuntu on a lot of people, and I wasn't aware of problems with ipod syncing... which would make me be a little more careful with who I push ubuntu on...
