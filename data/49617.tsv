2010-04-19T21:40:00.000Z	sab	LucidGuy	I am asking this because from a long time i m suffering with dual boot problem,most of the time when i restart or power on my machine i found GRUB failure,for the temporary solution i always install another ubuntu to get back the grub,then again i formated my HD and installed win7 first and then ubuntu but last night i experienced the same prob.Now planing to format my HD again and do all the things carefully to get rid of this prob
