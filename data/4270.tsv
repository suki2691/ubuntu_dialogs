2012-10-03T00:40:00.000Z	L3mce	elijah	you are asking about formatting from an MS product. MSWord does not run on ubuntu. If you are running a vm, depending on the vm, you will need extra bits... for instance in virtualbox you will need guest additions to carry over clipboarding etc... however the format output... that is outside of the scope of support here.
