2012-10-02T16:22:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	akis	 it is always recommended to remove ppas

2012-10-17T13:25:00.000Z	akis	MonkeyDust	if this is true must be very convenient. i will check it right now and i will come back if i have problem. one more question. is it possible to manage/change icons in task bar in gnome? i know that in unity isn't possible. but in gnome? is it possible and how can i customize it?
