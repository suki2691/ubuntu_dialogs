2011-02-04T09:13:00.000Z	KM0201	nunya	well, whats your wireless device, and second, why are you using 9.10?
2011-02-04T09:14:00.000Z	nunya	KM0201	I need 9.10 for my computer because that's the only verion supported by the maker of the computer (I need it for video acceleration) the wireless device is intneral.  I don't even know how to check which drivers are installed and working
