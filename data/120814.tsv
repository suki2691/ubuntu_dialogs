2008-09-27T00:56:00.000Z	lorenzo		I installed ubuntu-studio audio package, but would like to have the extended version of one of the softwares, that is Pure Data. But if I try removing it with synaptic I get a message that all the ubuntu-studio chould be also removed. That seems quit illogical. What am I missing?

2008-09-27T00:59:00.000Z	noodlesgc	lorenzo	its a package that depends on a whole bunch of different packages, so it installs a certain set of software
