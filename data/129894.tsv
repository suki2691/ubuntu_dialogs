2007-10-31T03:23:00.000Z	kingnothing		Can I get some help using fdisk to partition out 400gb of a 500gb hard drive? I want to leave the other 100gb alone to use with a separate windows install
2007-10-31T03:24:00.000Z	shingoki	kingnothing	yup that should be possible - are you planning to install and boot windows on the same drive?
2007-10-31T03:25:00.000Z	kingnothing	shingoki	right now, i have a drive with windows and ubuntu on it. I bought a 500gb drive i'd like to use for what I said, with the new 400gb partition to be used as a home directory. the rest for windows is just going to be extra storage, formatted ntfs
2007-10-31T03:25:00.000Z	shingoki	kingnothing	ah right, I was just checking you weren't going to install windows after ubuntu and kill ubuntu :)
