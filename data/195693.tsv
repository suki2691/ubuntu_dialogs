2006-11-22T14:00:00.000Z	Figgy		just a quick question. what is the terminal command so i can get the busid of my pci-e graphics cards?
2006-11-22T14:02:00.000Z	Figgy		for some reason in my xorg.conf file it doesn't state the busid of the card it's using.
2006-11-22T14:02:00.000Z	kitche	Figgy	busid is optional
