2010-06-01T22:51:00.000Z	Traveler		Hello. I have installed ubuntu and i would like to view movies now. I've tried launching a movie with Movie Player and it says "the playback of this movie requires a advanced streaming format demuxer plugin which is not installed"
2010-06-01T22:51:00.000Z	Traveler		Where do i get it?
2010-06-01T22:51:00.000Z	Traveler		Okay
