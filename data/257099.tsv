2007-08-13T11:40:00.000Z	Falstius	marti149	I use dpkg -l | grep '^ii' | awk '{print $2}' > installed     but I think there are simpler ways
2007-08-13T11:41:00.000Z	Falstius	marti149	what you really want though is a list of packages that were directly installed (instead of ones that were installed for dependencies)
