2009-11-10T11:36:00.000Z	Jivedue		hi, I'm looking through some tutorials on reinstalling grub, and it says to use "sudo grub" from the ubuntu live cd.
2009-11-10T11:36:00.000Z	Jivedue		But my live cd (ubuntu 9.10) only has a bunch of grub-<something> programs.
2009-11-10T11:36:00.000Z	Jivedue		Does anyone know which of the dozen or so I should use?
