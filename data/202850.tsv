2006-09-13T15:37:00.000Z	BoukenPink		Hey all... Hoping someone in here will know where to point me... Whenever I try to install Dapper, it just freezes at the point where it says it's "setting up the clock" or something.... I have no idea what to do.
2006-09-13T15:37:00.000Z	synjet	BoukenPink	try another CD, sometimes it does crash
2006-09-13T15:47:00.000Z	BoukenPink	synjet	It happens no matter what CD I use, whether burned or official ones.... though I haven't tried 6.06.1 yet
2006-09-13T15:50:00.000Z	synjet	BoukenPink	every CD gets stuck at time-zone config? how abt Kubuntu?
