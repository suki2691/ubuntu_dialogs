2008-07-29T19:23:00.000Z	MilkFloat		Hi guys, I'm attempting a kickstarted install of ubuntu using local mirrored repositories, and it's trying to get restricted packages
2008-07-29T19:24:00.000Z	MilkFloat		I haven't mirrored this and don't really want to for time constraints, does anyone know why it would try and pull in the restricted repo?  It's a basic install (base, ssh server, ntp)
