2008-06-05T08:53:00.000Z	curtHendzell	akahige	 and running 'sudo apt-get autoremove' didn't do it either?
2008-06-05T08:55:00.000Z	curtHendzell	akahige	does synaptic give you the option to reinstall the package?
2008-06-05T08:56:00.000Z	curtHendzell	akahige	try reinstallation and then complete removal
