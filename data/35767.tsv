2010-03-15T03:17:00.000Z	EzeQL		hi, I am a windows guy. I want to switch to ubuntu but most programs that i use daily are only available for windows. The linux alternatives are miles away from these. Could i install vmware/virtualbox for using windows xp? will this emulated windows xp work ok?
2010-03-15T03:17:00.000Z	lunks	EzeQL	most of the time, yes.
2010-03-15T03:18:00.000Z	lunks	EzeQL	why not try the other way? Linux on a VM?
2010-03-15T03:19:00.000Z	EzeQL	lunks	i have a Ubutun instlalation running on Vmware, but performance sucks
