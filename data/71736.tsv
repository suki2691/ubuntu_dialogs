2008-12-08T19:59:00.000Z	LjL	ministry	what do you mean "enable japanese"? japanese *input*?
2008-12-08T20:07:00.000Z	LjL	ministry	that's only possible for packages that *come* with a japanese translation, and for packages from Universe like "mc" that's likely not the case. but still, the relevant document on how to do that from the console ( https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LocaleConf ) seems to be outdated and i don't know how to fix it
