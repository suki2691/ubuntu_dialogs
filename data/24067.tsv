2011-10-20T13:07:00.000Z	Semtex		someone please help! I have lost root access on my ubuntu 11.10
2011-10-20T13:08:00.000Z	yagoo	Semtex	"root" is a very ambiguous term. Speak carefully
2011-10-20T13:09:00.000Z	yagoo	Semtex	use rescue boot (installer dvd) and chroot to change password
2011-10-20T13:09:00.000Z	yagoo	Semtex	once chrooted, use passwd command
