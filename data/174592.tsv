2007-07-30T10:57:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	wckdkl0wn	why use cs2 aint that just a performance hog... always found 7 to be better or better yet use gimp :D
2007-07-30T10:58:00.000Z	wckdkl0wn	Paddy_EIRE	7 isnt advanced enough for what i do.. and gimp is well lol too confusing
2007-07-30T10:59:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	wckdkl0wn	there is an addon for gimp called gimpshop which makes it more friendly for windows/photoshop users
