2006-12-13T13:38:00.000Z	ianp	JordiGH	philosophies are for philosophers
2006-12-13T13:38:00.000Z	JordiGH	ianp	Is that a no, then? Ubuntu doesn't have a position statement? I can't find one.
2006-12-13T13:39:00.000Z	ianp	JordiGH	from ubuntu.com: "The Ubuntu community is built on the ideas enshrined in the Ubuntu Philosophy: that software should be available free of charge, that software tools should be usable by people in their local language and despite any disabilities, and that people should have the freedom to customise and alter their software in whatever way they see fit."
