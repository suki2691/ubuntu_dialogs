2010-04-24T16:41:00.000Z	CQ	killaz-Qc-	sure, why not? depends if you wrote it, and if not, what license it's under
2010-04-24T16:43:00.000Z	CQ	killaz-Qc-	you can use all the standard python functions... if you use other libraries, look at their license. But youshoudl ask in a legal forum, not here...
2010-04-24T16:45:00.000Z	CQ	killaz-Qc-	not on IRC... check the python mailing lists
