2010-09-24T22:12:00.000Z	lucenut		I am trying to unpack a multipart rar movie. I installed unrar in the package manager.
2010-09-24T22:13:00.000Z	lucenut		But now when I extract the .rar file it looks like it's doing it. But the avi file is not where I specified to unpack to!
2010-09-24T22:13:00.000Z	lucenut		Getting frustrated.
2010-09-24T22:13:00.000Z	Daniel1	lucenut	Me too.
