2007-08-24T11:22:00.000Z	PriceChild	_Acqua_	ubuntu isn't a windows application
2007-08-24T11:22:00.000Z	PriceChild	_Acqua_	i think you don't understand _at all_ what on earth ubuntu is
2007-08-24T11:22:00.000Z	PriceChild	_Acqua_	ubuntu is a completely seperate operating system... you don't run it from inside windows.
