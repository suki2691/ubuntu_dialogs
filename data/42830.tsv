2009-11-16T01:32:00.000Z	antipopxx		I'm having some trouble connecting to my uni WPA2/PEAP network. I can't really post a dmesg or anything, since I'm using IRC on another computer, but dmesg gives two different errors: "deauthenticated (reason: 23)" and "disassociating by local choice (reason=3)". How can I find more info on these? Googling just gives me forum posts and the like which are unhelpful.
