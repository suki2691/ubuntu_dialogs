2009-02-22T02:08:00.000Z	MaT-dg		after boot ubuntu asks for a password (needed for networkmanager), can I let it remember my password?
2009-02-22T02:09:00.000Z	BCM43	MaT-dg	The root password?
2009-02-22T02:09:00.000Z	MaT-dg	BCM43	yes, to acces keyring
2009-02-22T02:09:00.000Z	BCM43	MaT-dg	ubuntu does not allow you to do that.
