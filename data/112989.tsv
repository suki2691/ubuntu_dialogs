2008-05-09T00:16:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Mimi	It's our problem if he does something inadvisable and later has problems because of it..
2008-05-09T00:17:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Mimi	the best answer is "that's a silly question which I will not help you with. Use sudo" .. if he wants to go research and find out how to do it, hopefully he will learn more about permisisons and see why it's not necessary in the first place
2008-05-09T00:18:00.000Z	Mimi	zcat[1]	  oh ok now I get why I always have so much trouble getting help here... it's to make me learn on my own ;p  Too bad I usually search a lot before coming here
