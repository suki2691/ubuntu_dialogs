2009-05-21T08:28:00.000Z	BiosElement		Somehow my root "/" folder became writable. What do I have to do to fix this?
2009-05-21T08:29:00.000Z	phoenixz	BiosElement	writable by who?
2009-05-21T08:29:00.000Z	BiosElement	phoenixz	all. Or so said the warning. I went and my non-root account can make/delete files there but it wasn't recursive thankfully.
2009-05-21T08:31:00.000Z	phoenixz	BiosElement	maybe its the webservers / that its talking about ? I doubt your systems / is writable.. in any case, for apache try #apache, dunno if lighthttp has a channel here but it should be easy to find :)
