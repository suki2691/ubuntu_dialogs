2009-02-13T04:47:00.000Z	Itacious		Hey all, I have xfce set up with a 48px panel, iconbox, etc. (a la Windows 7). I have just discovered (or rediscovered) that the xfce tray supports multiple columns, so now the icons aren't huge (YES!). But, if I put the standard xfce volume applet down there, it blows up to 48x48px. So, in short, does anybody know of a package that is a volume manger(?) for the system tray? Thanks in advance.
