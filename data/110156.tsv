2008-07-10T01:36:00.000Z	timandtom		Can I delete an ext3 partition off of an external disk(My iPod specifically), and add all the empty space back in to the FAT32 partition? Preferably without losing all my data.

2008-07-10T01:37:00.000Z	timandtom	ikonia	ah, sorry, worded that badly. I meant without losing whats on the FAT32 partition.
