2007-07-28T06:06:00.000Z	UbunVIA		do I install a kernel RPM package when installing a driver?
2007-07-28T06:07:00.000Z	bulmer	UbunVIA	ubuntu uses deb packages however alien can convert rpm to deb like package
2007-07-28T06:09:00.000Z	bulmer	UbunVIA	did you follow the instructions? it said something about modifying a kernel, adding video buffer stuff..etc
2007-07-28T06:10:00.000Z	bulmer	UbunVIA	well building a kernel is not trivial task...you can google for that first and then learn the different modules you can build onto the kernel with that link you pointed to gives you a hint
