2008-08-14T20:07:00.000Z	ville88		Hello i have a problem with GPROFTPD. when someone is connecting to my ftp server they cant see any files! anyone?
2008-08-14T20:08:00.000Z	ville88		<ch3ck> i think they have all the permissions that they need
2008-08-14T20:08:00.000Z	ville88		<ch3ck> but i dont really know if my ports are correct
2008-08-14T20:09:00.000Z	Slart	ville88	it can be a lot of things.. permissions.. open ports etc etc
