2009-08-30T05:51:00.000Z	Symmetria		*sigh* does ANYONE have any idea how the hell to disable frame buffer in ubuntu 8.10 server cd so it doesnt attempt to turn it on
2009-08-30T05:51:00.000Z	Symmetria		I really need to fix this server and my remote management card isnt compatible with frame buffer (:
2009-08-30T05:51:00.000Z	Symmetria		so if ANYONE has any idea how to make this cd boot without enabling it it would be hugely helpful
