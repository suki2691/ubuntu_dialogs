2010-02-01T10:14:00.000Z	Blue1	dsnyders	advice (personal exp) backup /etc/ and /home and do a fresh install upgrades don't work
2010-02-01T10:17:00.000Z	dsnyders	Blue1	Fresh install, eh?  I suppose I need to burn a CD, or can I install directly from the internet yet?
2010-02-01T10:18:00.000Z	Blue1	dsnyders	install cd
