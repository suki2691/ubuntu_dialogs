2009-06-01T04:11:00.000Z	p-f		Hi, dhclient keeps getting ridiculously short leases (200-1500 seconds). Any ideas why? I'm having the same problem at home and at university, so it's unlikely to be a router problem.
2009-06-01T04:11:00.000Z	p-f		I have about 1300 seconds until my lease expires so please make it quick :p
2009-06-01T04:12:00.000Z	p-f		this is a new issue, by the way. It started occuring about a week ago. I haven't made any major updates for the last two weeks so I'm not sure what could be the cause.
