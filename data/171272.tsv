2006-08-12T12:44:00.000Z	Mitrovarr		 hey, I got the sound-juicer doesn't do mp3s problem fixed.  Is anyone interested in the solution?
2006-08-12T12:46:00.000Z	Mitrovarr		what's up with MP3 not being supported anyway?  I mean, there's like 1 billion free mp3 programs on the net, so obviously the license or patent or whatever can't be very restrictive

2006-08-12T12:49:00.000Z	Rippon	Mitrovarr	Ubuntu wouldn't be completly free then, so it is against the philosophy
