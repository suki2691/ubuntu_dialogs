2005-11-08T06:16:00.000Z	BeGu		I made a launcher to my desktop that updates my uptime record to the internet... launcher's command uses sudo and that's why it ask's for a password. How can I make a launcher with sudo and somehow put the password inside that launcher that I dont have to write my sudo password every time I use that laucher... DId anyone understand? :)

2005-11-08T06:21:00.000Z	andi5	BeGu	why should you want that? i never understand that.... someone needs to call that script... eigher you (by sudo) or some cron job (this one has root privileges)
