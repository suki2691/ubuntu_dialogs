2011-01-10T13:30:00.000Z	Guest15794	bullgard4	this is error msg(((There seems to be a programming error in aptdaemon, the software that allows you to install/remove software and to perform other package management related tasks. Please report this error at http://launchpad.net/aptdaemon/+filebug and retry.)))
2011-01-10T13:32:00.000Z	bullgard4	Guest15794	So to me it is clear what you should do next: i.) Please report the error in Launchpad. ii.) Try to install wine anew.
