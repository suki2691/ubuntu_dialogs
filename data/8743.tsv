2011-11-08T09:21:00.000Z	bjrohan		I also havve Ubuntu running on another desktop in my home. Both computers connect to the internet via a wireless router connected to a router. I have set up Samba, and can access the other computer, however connected to that computer is a 1TB USB drive, that I can recognize via my laptop, but can not access, any ideas why?
2011-11-08T09:22:00.000Z	bjrohan		Do I need to put this drive in fstab as well on that desktop?
