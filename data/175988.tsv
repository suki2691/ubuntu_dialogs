2006-07-04T08:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	debnub	 you could be a little more specific about your problem.. its rather vague.
2006-07-04T08:10:00.000Z	dr_willis		ubuntu has partial access - means very little to me
2006-07-04T08:12:00.000Z	debnub	dr_willis	have a nat router (external) running montavista linux (d-link dsl-g604t) right now i on ubuntu on chatzilla. i got web access, finger, localnet respondes file, ethernet printer works, but not gaim, or ping to external network.
