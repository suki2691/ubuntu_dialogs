2006-03-26T17:57:00.000Z	kingspawn	DjKritical	bash script
2006-03-26T17:58:00.000Z	DjKritical	kingspawn	any reason why you would say bash script instead or perl?
2006-03-26T17:58:00.000Z	kingspawn	DjKritical	basically just because it is already "connected" to every system resource you might need for a "script"
