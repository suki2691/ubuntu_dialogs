2009-07-22T19:48:00.000Z	Freidenker1		Now to get back at my initial problem: I want to install Scala with the installer, the jar command just un"zip" everything in the folder.
2009-07-22T19:49:00.000Z	Freidenker1		I open the installer with Sun Java runtime, so I just need to know the name of that command and I should be able to start the installer from the terminal with sudo

2009-07-22T19:50:00.000Z	Freidenker1	pepperjack	Thanks ! It was easier than I thought
