2012-01-27T16:37:00.000Z	daschel		I'm getting fed up with ubuntu support.  I've only had 5 problems/questions over the last two years that I've had to post to support forums or irc channels.  It seems that anything not quickly solvable by searching google gets ignored.  A simple, "I'm stumped" would suffice, but when I say I've tried their solution already or that it didn't work, I'm met by silence.  It's unprofessional and off putting.

2012-01-27T16:40:00.000Z	daschel	MonkeyDust	I wasn't saying that the solution should be simple.  I was saying a simple response of "I don't know.  I'm working on it." or "I'm stumped" would be appreciated
2012-01-27T16:42:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	daschel	there's 1000+ users here, should we all say 'i dont know'?
