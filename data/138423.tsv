2007-04-25T14:35:00.000Z	jordo23		If I just did a standard 6.06LTS Lamp Server install on another box, and am trying to Ssh into that box, it says connection refused......is there something I have to activate?
2007-04-25T14:35:00.000Z	magnetron	jordo23	is the ssh server installed at the box?
2007-04-25T14:36:00.000Z	jordo23	magnetron	maybe the standard install only installs the client?
2007-04-25T14:36:00.000Z	magnetron	jordo23	yes i think so. install packet "ssh" to get the server too
