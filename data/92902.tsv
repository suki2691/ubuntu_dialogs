2008-04-29T19:59:00.000Z	sbroos_		Everytime I restart my pc in ubuntu, my collection isnt visible for amarok anymore (and last plays are greyed). When I acces the disc with the mp3 files (a NTFS) disc, it takes a long time to open that disc, but after that, amarok sees the mp3's again (after doing a rescan collection)
2008-04-29T20:01:00.000Z	sbroos_		anyone an idea?
