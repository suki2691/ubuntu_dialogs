2007-10-07T13:41:00.000Z	compreak219		mv /etc/x11/xorg.conf /etc/x11/xorg.backup  (or wherever you put it)
2007-10-07T13:42:00.000Z	compreak219		name it like, xorg.conf.back
2007-10-07T13:42:00.000Z	CokeNCode	compreak219	it won't let me rename the xorg.conf file period
2007-10-07T13:43:00.000Z	CokeNCode	compreak219	shouldn't that be the other way around ?
