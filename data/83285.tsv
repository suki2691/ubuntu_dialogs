2008-08-07T01:37:00.000Z	new_user		Hi all..  Can someone help a new user out.  I am trying to figure out an "easy" way to set up a VPN server on my new ubuntu install
2008-08-07T01:37:00.000Z	new_user		I surprisingly cannot find any nhalf-decent HOWTO's
2008-08-07T01:39:00.000Z	clautsh	new_user	kvpnc might help
2008-08-07T01:40:00.000Z	new_user	clautsh	Is that a server or a client though?
