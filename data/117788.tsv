2007-10-05T09:46:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntnoob	 it's a matter of principel,    ubuntu ultimate is just a flaky repack of ubuntu with a butload of software as part of the default install,  you can get all of those from ubuntu regular ,  if hte guy realy wants to make his own release he can make his own channel
2007-10-05T09:48:00.000Z	ubuntnoob	Pelo	- Gotcha, I after messing with it a bit, I noticed I wouldn't use half of the stuff added.  I just wanted Beryl.
2007-10-05T09:48:00.000Z	Pelo	ubuntnoob	 you can get beryl easily enough from the repos
2007-10-05T09:49:00.000Z	ubuntnoob	Pelo	- I know I'm just lazy and wanted an install that had everything that I want and the things that I didn't know I wanted.   I'll check the other channel or do more research.  Thanks and good luck.
