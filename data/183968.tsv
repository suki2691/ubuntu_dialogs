2006-06-06T09:39:00.000Z	babo		gosh, I'm pretty much out of ideas on this one ... I've opened the firewalls, opened port forwarding on my router, opened the torrent ports on my router, attempted to bypass the router (pppoeconf won't pick up my isp access concentrator by it's self), but when I test my connection at scangate.com, it can't find any running services ... I should have dhclient and bittorrent server running. Or at least according to netstat -tulp I should anyway ...
