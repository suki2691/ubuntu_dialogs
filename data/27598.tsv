2010-08-13T18:18:00.000Z	Rogue1		Enquiry: I have a server which won't boot from a Live install on a USB flash drive - it the best bet just to use an ISO on a CD-ROM, as opposed to editing grub to allow boot from USB?
2010-08-13T18:19:00.000Z	oCean_	Rogue1	are you sure the bios of your server is set to boot usb?
2010-08-13T18:20:00.000Z	Rogue1	oCean_	don't have a boot-from-USB option, unfortunately.
2010-08-13T18:20:00.000Z	oCean_	Rogue1	in that case I'd say boot from the cdrom indeed
