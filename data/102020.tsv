2008-03-27T00:19:00.000Z	martinjh99		Allo Is there any docs for the gtk themeing and gtkrc files?
2008-03-27T00:20:00.000Z	unop_	martinjh99	maybe this? http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/unstable/gtk-Resource-Files.html
2008-03-27T00:22:00.000Z	martinjh99	unop	not a C programmer but that might help... Thanks
2008-03-27T00:22:00.000Z	unop_	martinjh99	i use it despite an aversion to perl -- it's also the canonical source
