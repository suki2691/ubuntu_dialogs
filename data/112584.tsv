2007-12-02T05:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis		i found avant-window-navigator a bit slow.. and well.. not very useable on my system. so i dident try it for more then 20 min.
2007-12-02T05:07:00.000Z	gmonnerat	Dr_willis	when i use compiz and i am using firefox the system lock few seconds. i am using gutsy
2007-12-02T05:08:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gmonnerat	  does it never lockup when you got compiz dissabled?
2007-12-02T05:13:00.000Z	gmonnerat	Dr_willis	Once or twice, but when it is with compiz and avant-window-navigator occurs more often . i don't believe that this occurs because of compiz or avant , but occurs more often
