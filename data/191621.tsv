2006-09-05T09:24:00.000Z	MTecknology		I'm trying to connect to our universities network in Ubuntu. I know the ESSID and WEP key... In my network configuration, it shows two of these Student1 and Student 2... it also has some where the ESSID is hidden. I try to connect to Student1 and Student2. I connect for a while and then to get anywhere I need to authenticate on Clean Access. I do this, then after somewhere between instantly...
2006-09-05T09:24:00.000Z	MTecknology		...and 15 sec, I'm disconnected. How do I fix this?

2006-09-05T09:25:00.000Z	MTecknology	twysted	but with the way we connect, i would still be able to view the DSU site
