2011-07-20T20:21:00.000Z	Spikestuff		I installed Ubuntu 11.04 via Wubi on Windows Vista, so now there is a few partitions I have, Ubuntu, Windows Vista, etc. I want to simply have a full, clean installation of Ubuntu. How would I go upon doing this? I didn't use a CD/DVD because I was given this laptop, and the previous owner doesn't remember the BIOS password.

2011-07-20T20:23:00.000Z	Spikestuff		Hold on, ActionParsnip, let me try that.
