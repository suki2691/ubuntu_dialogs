2009-06-03T04:32:00.000Z	zortec_		Sorry, I missed all the messages.  But to recap, I really would like some help on a few things.  First I created a 20GB home partition, a 10GB root partition, and a 3GB swap.  I've ran out of room on my home partition.  I can't seem to mount my cdrom.  Why does .gnome in /home take up 10GB.  I need about 10GB just to play WoW.  Should I make the home partition about 50GB?
2009-06-03T04:33:00.000Z	zortec_		It seems odd that GNOME would take up 10GB.  That is half my home partition.

2009-06-03T04:34:00.000Z	zortec_	Kalmi_	So did I create too small of partitions?  I have went through the partition manager now 3 times.  I'm really lost as to what sizes to go with
