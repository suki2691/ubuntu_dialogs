2007-04-25T06:12:00.000Z	LjL	astecp	no, incorrect. backports requires standard universe and multiverse to be enabled. see their pages, it should be mentioned there i think

2007-04-25T06:17:00.000Z	astecp	LjL	sorry, I mean a lib that is only available in edgy ... but it looks like I made a mistake and downloaded the fiesty version; thanks :-)
