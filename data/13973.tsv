2011-05-24T02:33:00.000Z	sisif		Hello guys. Quick question: I want to mount a  ext4 partition from a different hdd with ubuntu on it, but the partition is encrypted. How can I decrypt it ?
2011-05-24T02:33:00.000Z	reliableNerd	sisif	i think you might have to use whatever you encrypted it with (truecrypt/etc) or format it?
2011-05-24T02:34:00.000Z	sisif	reliableNerd	I don`t want to format it, I want to back up the info on it.  it`s my /home from my notebook
2011-05-24T02:35:00.000Z	sisif	reliableNerd	and it was encrypted by the option gived by ubuntu upon install
