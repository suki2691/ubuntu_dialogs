2007-05-04T10:08:00.000Z	helgeT		Anyone experienced with a "Grub error 21" after installation of ubuntu 7.04? If not, can someone at least tell me how to uninstall GRUB so I can boot my Windows system again?
2007-05-04T10:09:00.000Z	sethk	helgeT	the error means it can't find the kernel it's trying to build.  You can use   fdisk/mbr from windows

2007-05-04T10:10:00.000Z	helgeT	sethk	doesnt it mean "can't find disk"? disk>kernel
