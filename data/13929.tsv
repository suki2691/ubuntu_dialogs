I bought it without checking the compatibility first. the actual controller works perfectly (it's the original original, aka the "Duke" fits perfectly in my hands) and the headset works in XP, which is now the only reason I voluntarily ever boot into Windows.

2011-05-27T22:39:00.000Z	Kevin`_	Lucifer_	oh, you are talking about 360, got confused by the 'original xbox'
