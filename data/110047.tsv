2009-01-24T05:14:00.000Z	sirjoebob	soreau	I have a server at home running Ubuntu server edition and want to be able to download files from networks like Limewire without launching a hefty GUI application. I already have transmissioncli for torrents but wondered if there was a cli program like limewire
