2011-11-19T06:49:00.000Z	tensorpudding	machiolate	binaries (the part you run) go in /usr/bin
2011-11-19T06:50:00.000Z	tensorpudding	machiolate	/usr/share contains a lot of extra files related to programs
2011-11-19T06:51:00.000Z	tensorpudding	machiolate	configuration files end up in /etc, but user-specific configuration is in ~/.config/
