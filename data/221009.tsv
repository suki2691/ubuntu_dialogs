2005-09-16T07:40:00.000Z	bob2	fblade	it's way less annoying if you tell us your goal
2005-09-16T07:42:00.000Z	fblade	bob2	sorry i mean im on 1024x728 resalution, thats the highest i can goto and it's just looks all too big for me and i was wondering if you could fale a 1280x1024 resalution as my laptop dosnt allow it
2005-09-16T07:42:00.000Z	bob2	fblade	faking resolutions has nothing to do with it?
