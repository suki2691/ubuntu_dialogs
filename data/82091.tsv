2009-03-12T02:43:00.000Z	hollywoodb	myron	ps aux | grep wine
2009-03-12T02:43:00.000Z	hollywoodb	myron	then kill whatever shows up using the pid
2009-03-12T02:45:00.000Z	myron	hollywoodb	that's do-able, but I was looking for something that would kill a frozen full screen app, without having to reboot or logout
