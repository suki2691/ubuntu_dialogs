2008-10-31T23:21:00.000Z	rmn	ummmd	i didn't do anything in fstab.  crypttab only to load the script.
2008-10-31T23:22:00.000Z	ummmd	rmn	i'm just saying you need to have appropriate fstab entries to mount things correctly / set up swap
2008-10-31T23:23:00.000Z	rmn	ummmd	ok, sure.  maestro444 i ran a server with debian (now ubuntu 8.04) with three hdd + 2 hot-swapped hdd that were mounted at boot
