2008-08-10T22:54:00.000Z	soundray	Grand_Master	it's in proposed
2008-08-10T22:55:00.000Z	soundray	Grand_Master	System-Administration-Software Sources. On the Updates tab, enable "Proposed"
2008-08-10T22:55:00.000Z	soundray	Grand_Master	then install the kernel you need. You may want to deselect proposed afterwards, because the packages in that repo are not as well tested.
