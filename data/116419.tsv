2008-01-02T13:45:00.000Z	scguy318	Yautja	not me, but did you have a question?
2008-01-02T13:46:00.000Z	scguy318		Monkier42: sudo fdisk -l to determine what disk you want
2008-01-02T13:47:00.000Z	Yautja	scguy318	not really, but it seems that it's running a bit slow comparing normal PC. some said PS3 is really some kind power house. is it true?
