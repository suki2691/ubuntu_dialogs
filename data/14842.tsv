2011-04-30T22:32:00.000Z	tatzenblogde	Sledge	rightclick on the panel > properties and remove the cross at "autohiding"?
2011-04-30T22:33:00.000Z	Sledge	tatzenblogde	 since the upgrade right clicking on the panel's does nothing.
2011-04-30T22:34:00.000Z	tatzenblogde	Sledge	yes, sorry - i forget. i'm using kde and foret that the uppgrade from normal ubuntu has more changes than the kubuntu-version
