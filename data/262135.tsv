2005-05-25T10:53:00.000Z	omniscient		hey my sound seems to work fine, as ubuntu sounds all play fine (startup sounds etc), but when i try to play an mp3 it never works.. xmms goes as far as crashing
2005-05-25T10:53:00.000Z	omniscient		anyone had similar problems and knows a solution?
2005-05-25T10:55:00.000Z	Seveas	omniscient	change the xmms output plugin to esd or esounf=d
2005-05-25T10:55:00.000Z	Seveas	omniscient	and try beep-media-player, it's xmms but nicer
