2009-03-04T02:19:00.000Z	Stephen|Edibles		I think the most interesting thing about my laptop and ubuntu is that when running banshee my next/last song keys (vostro lappie) work for approximately 15 minutes when banshee starts, then stop working XD.
2009-03-04T02:19:00.000Z	Stephen|Edibles		Hi there. I'm trying to build pidgin 2.5.4 from source since it appears ubuntu doesnt have it yet in the repositry. I can get the source dled and unpacked okay, but when following the faq on the pidgin site it says to run "sudo apt-get build-dep gaim", but I get an unable to find source package error. Anyone like to help?

2009-03-04T02:22:00.000Z	Stephen|Edibles	default	glitsj16 : Yeah, a friend just pointed me to them. I will struggle on against this source for a bit, but I'll probably end up just grabbing the deb XD
