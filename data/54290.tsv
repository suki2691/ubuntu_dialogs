2009-08-14T04:48:00.000Z	mazda01		whats the best and easiest to use lightweight desktop manager? i only have 256 of ram, i have tried LXDE, Icewm, XFCE4-session, and all have items in them that take up precious system resources like the panels. lxpanel takes up a lot, xfce4-panel has a memory leak and i don't like the file manager in icewm, any thoughts?
2009-08-14T04:48:00.000Z	nanotube	mazda01	try openbox
2009-08-14T04:49:00.000Z	nanotube	mazda01	or for a /really/ lightweight setup, try fvwm
2009-08-14T04:49:00.000Z	mazda01	nanotube	openbox is used in LXDE, can i just use plain openbox? i am trying to find e17 but i can't find it in the repos?
