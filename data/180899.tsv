2006-06-19T11:26:00.000Z	arigo		I plan to install ubuntu on a new hd seperate from my xp install.  I want to be able to select which OS to boot to at startup, what's the best way to go about it? Someone else told me to take out my current hd and install ubuntu on the new one, then put my current hd in as secondary, but that's opposite of what I'd naturally think I should do
