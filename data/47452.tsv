Sometimes, when opening a folder, Nautilus "hangs" when loading, giving me only partial list of the files, then keeps loading forever. No matter if it's internal or external drive. Mounted NFS-drive doesn't do this. Any ideas? It works again after a reboot.

2010-03-13T19:51:00.000Z	OttifantSir	theadmin	No, that doesn't work. Closing Nautilus and reopening the folder does the same. F5 or pressing the Reload-button doesn't work either. Only thing that corrects is a reboot. And some of the folders are large (~1000 files) some are smaller (~50 files). Never the same ones
