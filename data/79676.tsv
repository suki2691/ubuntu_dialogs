2011-02-15T15:11:00.000Z	ohzie		I'm having an issue with dhcp3-server where a client requests an ip address, that request is logged in syslog, dhcp3-server performs a "DHCPOFFER" to that machine, and the client just sits there. It seems to never recieve the offer. I'm not sure if this is a client issue or a server issue. Does anyone have any tips to get me started troubleshooting? The client can recieve an address via dhcp from other dhcp servers.
