2007-10-16T13:49:00.000Z	youknowme		I'm trying to use vncviewer, and I'm connected to a router so me speed should 10/100Mb/s. But when using vnc its kinda sluggish, small changes refresh somewhat fast but if the whole screen changes it takes a second or two receive the data for the new image. My network usage only come up to about 1.5Mb/s.
