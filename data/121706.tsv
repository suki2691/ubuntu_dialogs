2007-10-30T18:54:00.000Z	koudelka_	PriceChild	i don't mean common for me, i mean for everyone. i've heard people saying it's slow before i upgraded, and it really seems like it's much slower, i just get 1.7mb/s on 1gbit
2007-10-30T18:55:00.000Z	PriceChild	koudelka_	mine is fine... I'd assume something wrong with your network.
