2009-08-05T15:28:00.000Z	Mrokii		hello all. I am an Ubuntu-newbie (coming from Mac). I have connected an old Apple Extended Keyboard to the pc I have Ubuntu on, but some special-keys, like the at-symbol aren't available with the key-combination that is shown in the keyboard-layout-window
2009-08-05T15:28:00.000Z	iceroot	Mrokii	system-settings-keyboard  for changing the layout

2011-05-19T20:04:00.000Z	Mrokii	iceroot	Thank you
