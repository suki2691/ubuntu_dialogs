2011-01-26T06:09:00.000Z	acerimmer		In ubuntu 10.10, I have 147 Gigs in /home.  2 users: 1 admin & I daily use.
2011-01-26T06:09:00.000Z	acerimmer		Tried to copy 20 gigs of music from my Windows account to /home and ran out of space!  No way I've used anything like 125 Gigs of space, so what happened?  Is there a default limit on the size of a user's /home?
