2011-08-08T03:12:00.000Z	Polah		How can I use wget to get the contents of a directory and it's subdirectories but not ones above it? I have the url <url>/fastdl/ttt/models and I want the contents of the models directory and its' subdirectories. However, when I try wget tries to download the contents of everything under <url>
