2009-08-01T15:17:00.000Z	Tecna		I'm interested in people's opinion on this...  Of Debian and Ubuntu, which is better, and why?

2009-08-01T15:19:00.000Z	Tecna	allquixotic	I think my question borders closely enough on tech support, because it's to help me decide whether or not to switch back to Ubuntu... I'm having trouble with Debian and their support channel is useless.

Hence it is off topic here. If you have a particular feature to inquire about, that'd be more on-topic
