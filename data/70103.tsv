2009-04-18T22:34:00.000Z	Mocs_ingame		anyone know anything about apache?  I have a lan, and I set it up, and I WAS getting webpage response, but after reboot I am not.  I tried a restart... no joy
2009-04-18T22:34:00.000Z	Mocs_ingame		wondering if the DHCP hosed it by assigning another IP?
2009-04-18T22:35:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	Mocs_ingame	you can check ip with if config
2009-04-18T22:37:00.000Z	Mean_Admin	Mocs_ingame	so a client on the same LAN can access the FTP on the server but not apache ?
