2007-09-23T09:46:00.000Z	knapsack	bruenig	Yep, that's correct. Except there's no bittorrent client that I can see running.
2007-09-23T09:46:00.000Z	bruenig	knapsack	had you been running one?
2007-09-23T09:47:00.000Z	knapsack	bruenig	You bet, I was running one before the reboot of my computer and killed it with signal 15.
