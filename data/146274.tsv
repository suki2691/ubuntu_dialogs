2009-05-25T03:29:00.000Z	Venport		Hi all, I just installed Ubuntu 7.10 on my old Dell Inspiron 600m, I'm using an old distro because i was told that this computer can't handle the newer ones (not sure if it's true or not). But i'm new to linux. My question is about adding programs ect... if i use synaptic i get an error when trying to load new repositorys  "Could not download all repository indexes" is this because of my out of date version of Ubuntu?? or something el
