2006-07-14T16:03:00.000Z	vlt		Hello. I have installed (K)ubuntu Dapper and OpenOffice. I added a font (system wide) and it's shown in the system settings list. But when I want to use the font OpenOffice says it wasn't installed.
2006-07-14T16:03:00.000Z	vlt		I restarted OpenOffice but the font doesn't appear.
