2008-02-07T22:45:00.000Z	whoaitsphil		i'm dual booting XP and ubuntu...on the manual partition setup for ubuntu should i make the partition primary or logical and beginning or end and what should i set as mount point? i already have XP installed
2008-02-07T22:47:00.000Z	whoaitsphil		should i set them both at the end of the partition?
