2011-09-01T15:26:00.000Z	RamtinA		and write " sudo apt-get autoremove openoffice.org-* "in terminal
2011-09-01T15:27:00.000Z	RamtinA		my system crashed ( cause of my low system ) and now when i type " sudo apt-get autoremove openoffice.org-* " , say : " E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem."
