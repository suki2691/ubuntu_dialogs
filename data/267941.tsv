2006-10-29T12:01:00.000Z	HadesChief		i need to download basic developers' tools (with all deps), like gcc, gmake, glibc-devel, etc... to install them on a Ubuntu 6.06 workstation without internet access
2006-10-29T12:01:00.000Z	HadesChief		how do I recover all deps without having a package manager and not knowing which packages are there in 6.06?
2006-10-29T12:02:00.000Z	crimsun	HadesChief	use apt-zip
