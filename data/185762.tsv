2007-01-21T11:49:00.000Z	sivik	Harry	normally you have to add a password to it, if you don't, that user has no password
2007-01-21T11:50:00.000Z	sivik	Harry	then there isn't a password for that user, you can set one by using paswd username
2007-01-21T11:51:00.000Z	sivik	Harry	no you don't, as long as you add the user to the machine you should be fine, as long as that user has a password
