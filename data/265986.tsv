2009-04-19T03:13:00.000Z	Burntresistor		im working on a simple slopeform calc in pyton i realiae the bug is the computer isnt working with two negatives or a negative and  positives right and is adding when it should subtract,  its not in int or float but it can be entered as either
2009-04-19T03:15:00.000Z	Burntresistor		y2-y1/x2-x1 is a slope formula if  i entered -2 as x1 and then 7 as the next one it would be -2-7 which would be -9  and not 5 which its giving me
2009-04-19T03:17:00.000Z	tritium	Burntresistor	your x2 and x1 are reversed
