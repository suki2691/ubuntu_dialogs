2006-08-07T11:13:00.000Z	wizbowes		hi - having trouble installing dapper on my old IBM T20.  It runs fine from the live disc but fails at 72% when running the installer.  I'm guessing it's a problem with my hard drive.  The installer has reformated this now - so my old windows os is lost.  Any ideas where to start with this?  (this if my first Linux experience)
2006-08-07T11:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	wizbowes	 could try the alterantive/text based installer - it may spit out some more verbose error messates as to whats going wrong.
2006-08-07T11:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	wizbowes	 they got 2 cd's the livecd/installer. and then the Other Alternative installer/cd
2006-08-07T11:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	wizbowes	 just seems its harder to trouble shoot the livecd's installer.
