2005-02-25T15:39:00.000Z	ferris	jelte	install debian
2005-02-25T15:40:00.000Z	ferris	jelte	i was running it... but it was really slow ..... debian is way faster.... (not that ubuntu is bad, it is quite nice)
2005-02-25T15:44:00.000Z	ferris	jelte	the biggest reason i left ubuntu, is that it would not run gnomesword.... so i wonder what other progs it will not run
2005-02-25T15:46:00.000Z	ferris	jelte	i would have liked to have kept it, but it would not run some of the progs that i needed, but Debian runs them easily
