2005-01-15T17:56:00.000Z	Phazeman		i need help here. i've just installed ubuntu for my first time and i don't remember what root password i gave it or it was just a typo and i can't get to root. I know it can sound as a stupid try of a kid to get some root but i;m not. you can ask in #mandrake if you don't believe. Can someone please help me with that ?
