2004-09-29T14:23:00.000Z	stragier		first of all, hi ! I'm having troubles playing mp3's with totem through my samba network. Is this the right place to ask questions ?
2004-09-29T14:25:00.000Z	stragier		rythmbox doesn't seem to be lauched correctly by nautilus ... Nothing seems to happen ...
2004-09-29T14:25:00.000Z	trey_	stragier	confused... why aren't you using Rhythmbox? Totem is primarily for video... Rhythmbox is like iTunes...
2004-09-29T14:27:00.000Z	trey_	stragier	yes...
