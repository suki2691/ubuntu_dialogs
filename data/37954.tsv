2010-02-03T15:53:00.000Z	obaid	jokehead	spindown turns off hdd disc rotation to save power, advantage, save power, disadvantage, none
2010-02-03T15:54:00.000Z	jokehead	obaid	do you sure it doesnt take extra time to spin the hard drives up again?
2010-02-03T15:55:00.000Z	obaid	jokehead	it takes time, in milliseconds, that wouldn't matter
