2008-11-01T19:38:00.000Z	HorizonXP		hey guys, i'm trying to access a site in Firefox, and it's not loading. It's only this particular site that's not working, and it works fine in Internet Explorer on Windows. It's https://gandalf.registrar.ualberta.ca/Admission/Application Is there any way to get this site to work? I've already tried User Agent Switcher...

2008-11-01T19:40:00.000Z	HorizonXP	kbrosnan	that might make sense. is there a quick way to disable extensions?
