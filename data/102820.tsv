2009-03-01T02:29:00.000Z	RichW		I plan to get a 1TB drive and partition it so that it dual boots vista and ubuntu. Vista has its own bootloader (bootmgr?) and linux has grub... a drive cant have two bootloaders can it?
2009-03-01T02:29:00.000Z	RichW		I am a bit confused about this.
2009-03-01T02:29:00.000Z	shear	RichW	if you install windows then linux, grub can handle the booting for both
2009-03-01T02:30:00.000Z	shear	RichW	I've never done it with vista, but dual booting with XP works fine with GRUB as the bootloader
