2011-10-14T00:08:00.000Z	thorn		I have a glitch that keeps repeating itself. See http://imm.io/ahBs for an example. This never happened before with previous releases of ubuntu, only with 11.04. it seems to have to do with text rendering and window drawing... how can I reset this when it happens without restarting? How can I fix it altogether? CAN SOMEONE GIVE ME AN IDEA OF HOW TO GOOGLE THIS PROBLEM?
