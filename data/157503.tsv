2006-12-28T08:29:00.000Z	jonah1980		hi can anyone please help me out - how do i check if ports are firewalled under ubuntu - i'm using edgy and i've been trying to portforward on my router but they still seem to be closed...
2006-12-28T08:29:00.000Z	w3ccv	jonah1980	iptables -L
2006-12-28T08:31:00.000Z	jonah1980	w3ccv	it says something about destination and chains - do i need to put port addresses in too?
2006-12-28T08:32:00.000Z	w3ccv	jonah1980	pastebin the output, i'lltake a look
