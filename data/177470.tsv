2008-11-26T00:46:00.000Z	nixbox		i just switched from gentoo to ubuntu, gnome is awfully slow on my machine, i have a 2 Ghz CPU with 1 GB of RAM, could it be an issue with video drivers? my video card is ATI radeon 7500 with 64 MB of DDR

2008-11-26T00:48:00.000Z	nixbox	Cripps	it worked perfectly fine on gentoo
