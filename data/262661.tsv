2007-04-30T11:26:00.000Z	luca		good day everyone
2007-04-30T11:27:00.000Z	luca		can someone help me set correctly the Bus ID PCI for an NVIDIA integrated card (geforce 3 7300)?
2007-04-30T11:27:00.000Z	Lathiat	luca	you should be able to simply leave it out
2007-04-30T11:28:00.000Z	luca	Lathiat	no I am not :( if I use the nvidia-glx-config script it chooses the wrong PCI
