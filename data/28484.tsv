2010-08-09T02:02:00.000Z	danielstri		Hello, I'm following instructions about how to share my internet, it says "ifconfig ethX ip, where ethX is the network card and ip is your desired server ip address (Usually 192.168.0.1 is used)". How can I find out what to put as ethX? I don't even know the format..
