2008-12-31T10:59:00.000Z	schnauzer		Anybody know where i can find an old-school classic Windows theme? I've tried Gnome-look, but all it seems to have is XP themes.
2008-12-31T11:01:00.000Z	schnauzer		no - i mean a window border, im already using redmond; eseven73 - i'd really like to avoid switching from GNOME.
2008-12-31T11:01:00.000Z	eseven73	schnauzer	but icewm isnt a theme, i was just being silly :)
