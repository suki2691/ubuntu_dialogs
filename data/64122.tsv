2011-04-30T22:14:00.000Z	groundup		Hey, I am having troubles with apt-get today. I was trying to upgrade Nginx but it failed and now I can't do anything with apt-get because it says The following packages have unmet dependencies:  nginx-full : Depends: nginx-common (= 1.0.0-0ppa1~maverick) but it is not installed E: Unmet dependencies. Try using -f.
