2007-04-07T16:52:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1		Looking for a good system benchmark tool that will measure the CPU capabilities and HDD read\write speeds and return the results of the calculations (which 'stress', for example, does not) so I can compare them against my other machine. Any ideas?

2007-04-07T16:54:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	KI4CGP	yeah, I know about that one, thanks. was hoping for a combination of both and then ideally a 'rating' value for overall performance
2007-04-07T16:54:00.000Z	KI4CGP	gizmo_the_great1	ahh, that I don't know about as a complete solution, or even a partial one :/
