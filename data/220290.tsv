2006-09-15T10:11:00.000Z	Flannel	seamus7_	#easyubuntu
2006-09-15T10:13:00.000Z	Flannel	seamus7_	we don't support easyubuntu, it isn't official.  You could try #ubuntu-offtopic
2006-09-15T10:14:00.000Z	Flannel	seamus7_	this is NOT the place to ask for easyubuntu support, #easyubuntu, or if anyone knows, try #ubuntu-offtopic
