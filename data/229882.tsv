2005-07-02T07:10:00.000Z	lynxer_atw		for which x86 CPU is Ubuntu optimized - i586 or i686?
2005-07-02T07:12:00.000Z	Shuddertrix	lynxer_atw	default kernel is i386, get others from apt.
2005-07-02T07:15:00.000Z	lynxer_atw	Shuddertrix	thanks but I mean applications in debs. I've heard that they are compressed with bzip2 and optimized not for i386. is it false?
