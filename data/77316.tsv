2008-10-14T00:19:00.000Z	jlilly		anyone have suggestions on a 12-13" laptop w/ 4gb ram that runs ubuntu well? Will be used to travel, but should have performance enough to act as my everyday computer (sans gaming)
2008-10-14T00:20:00.000Z	tricqster	jlilly	Fujitsu-Siemens U9200/U9210, or Thinkpad X200/X300... :)  but they are not for gaming... ehm
2008-10-14T00:22:00.000Z	jlilly	tricqster	I'm not looking for a gaming machine. Just looking for something if I get a work-from-home job. There's going to be some travel involved, but I don't want a POS to work on everyday.
2008-10-14T00:25:00.000Z	tricqster	jlilly	as I know, FS U9200 is working pretty well with linux. intel cpu + intel gpu... the same for lenovo X200, or X300 these notebooks are quite small 12-13", which I like.
