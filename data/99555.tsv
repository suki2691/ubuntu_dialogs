I'm looking at this (http://preview.tinyurl.com/2d6dnq) USB external hard disk drive, and it seems to be going for a good price, but I fear that I may have to install some kind of 'drive manager' or something to take hold of the 'advanced features'. Are my fears founded?

2008-06-10T02:09:00.000Z	Rampage	Luig1	i wouldn't worry about that
