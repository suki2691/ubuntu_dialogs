2011-07-14T21:14:00.000Z	hylian		is there a way to get the console to do one thing after another? i would like wget to download about 22 files, and it would take a while, and i was wondering if i could get a list of commands to follow, without creating a bash script file. (just a little lazy)
2011-07-14T21:15:00.000Z	hylian		curl will do it? cool, ill look at the man page.
