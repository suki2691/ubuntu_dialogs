2011-10-15T16:33:00.000Z	Starman83		I recently upgraded to oneiric, but since then my network performance (over samba, xp client) went down from 19 mb/s to 9 mb/s. If I select an older Kernel (2.6x) in the boot menu the problem goes away

2011-10-15T16:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Starman83	are there any bugs reported?
