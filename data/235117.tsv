2006-02-26T06:03:00.000Z	ArthurB		Hi, I can't have the network working and I don't really know where the problem lies
2006-02-26T06:03:00.000Z	ArthurB		dmesg tells me eth0 is tied to the e100 driver which is loaded, but launching dhclient yields a bunch of "network is down" errors
2006-02-26T06:04:00.000Z	ArthurB		( yes the cable is plugged -in )
2006-02-26T06:04:00.000Z	biovore	ArthurB	try dhcpcd -i eth0
