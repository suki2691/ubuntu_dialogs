2009-06-07T11:50:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		I'm reading a how-to that says I should format a partition as iso9660, anyone know how you go about doing that?
2009-06-07T11:50:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	Geoffrey2	what how-to is this?
2009-06-08T09:16:00.000Z	DigitalKiwi	Geoffrey2	in the time (over 24 hours?) you've spent trying to do this you could have gone out and earned enough money to buy a dvd burner >.>
2009-06-08T09:18:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	DigitalKiwi	given the many hours so far that I've put into figuring out linux instead of just sticking to windows, I don't want to hear about it.... :)
