2008-04-06T22:50:00.000Z	azuki		ok... so, seen right, the package manager really IS ubuntu.... the FSTAB is for mounting right?
2008-04-06T22:51:00.000Z	azuki		so I make a /home folder on another drive, how do I "fool" ubuntu to use it?
2008-04-06T22:53:00.000Z	azuki		right, and as I understand all installed software / programs aren't "attached to the kernel" (like windows's reg-key stuff), so I could be moving them around and ubuntu would care?
2008-04-06T22:55:00.000Z	un0p	azuki	obviously things wouldnt work if you moved them around
