2011-11-06T00:07:00.000Z	gry2		hi, is it safe to remove old kernel versions by "completely uninstalling" the old linux-image entries in synaptic?
2011-11-06T00:07:00.000Z	jrib	gry2	yes, though you should keep one around
2011-11-06T00:08:00.000Z	gry2	jrib	is it ok to 'completely' uninstall them or to 'uninstall' them? what's the difference?
2011-11-06T00:08:00.000Z	jrib	gry2	both are safe.  Completely uninstall removes configuration files but I don't think there are any for the linux-image packages
