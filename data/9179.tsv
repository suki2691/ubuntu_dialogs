2011-10-03T12:15:00.000Z	seeg		is there a way to see the differences between files in a ubuntu .deb package and the files currently on the disk?
2011-10-03T12:15:00.000Z	yacc	seeg	there might be a better way, but download the deb, unpack it (deb files are ar archives, man page, google), and then compare the files.
2011-10-03T12:26:00.000Z	seeg	yacc	ok, thank you, i'll try unpacking then ;)
