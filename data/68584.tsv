2009-08-07T10:46:00.000Z	DJNomad	bullgard4	 I hhave a prog called startup manager on xubuntu
2009-08-07T10:47:00.000Z	DJNomad	bullgard4	its on the system tab on the menu button thingy
2009-08-07T11:02:00.000Z	bullgard4	DJNomad	I do not use Xubuntu but Ubuntu with GNOME. System > Preferences > Startup Applications shows a list titled "Additional startup programs". This does not list 'Pidgin'. But Pidgin started automatically. May be I can solve my problem by deasserting the "Automatically remember running applications when logging out" button. --  Thank you for your comment.
