2012-11-28T17:03:00.000Z	bazhang	abhitest	sounds like a suse issue
2012-11-28T17:04:00.000Z	bazhang	abhitest	#suse
2012-11-28T17:05:00.000Z	abhitest	bazhang	i first installed suse with /boot in normal partition and / inside encprted lvm. "Then" I installed lubuntu 12.10 and now grub shows only lubuntu. so its lubuntu issue. not suse.
