2005-04-05T08:19:00.000Z	tomcat	Hayden	I do... and when you say sharename, that's the name of the windows share, not the computer doing the sharing?
2005-04-05T08:21:00.000Z	tomcat	Hayden	so there's no way to connect to a windows computer and browse to see what shares there are? I'm trying to connect through gnome>places>network servers... but I think this one point is what's hanging me.
