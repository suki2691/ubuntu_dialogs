2006-11-05T14:22:00.000Z	intrico		Question for anyone who might be able to advise:  When some buggy multimedia programs crash (running 6.10 release)... they lock up the whole system.
2006-11-05T14:22:00.000Z	intrico		Is there anyway to prevent that?
2006-11-05T14:23:00.000Z	intrico		I thought under Linux, applications were supposed to run in their own memory space?
2006-11-05T14:23:00.000Z	chuckyp	intrico	are they locking up X or the whole system?  i.e. ctrl+alt+f1  won't bring up a terminal
