2009-06-14T11:35:00.000Z	eNHASA	jeeves	There's something called Caffeine out there that basically emulates a keypress every 59 seconds to prevent automatic backlight shutdown, etc. I don't know if it's got a Linux release, but you could take a look there..

2009-06-14T11:36:00.000Z	jeeves	eNHASA	ok, I didn't know if it was a setting issue.  All I know is that it's getting annoying
