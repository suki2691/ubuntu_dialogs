2008-08-26T13:21:00.000Z	ndlovu	bdunlap	what does power-settings do?
2008-08-26T13:23:00.000Z	bdunlap	ndlovu	i dont think the package is called power-settings but its settings for your hardware/battery/etc that controls settings like standby, hibernate, things that happen to your computer when it's idle
