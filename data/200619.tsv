2007-03-10T12:26:00.000Z	T3hMikey		well, I mean, I downloaded a program that came as a tarball, followed the instructions on the Ubuntu site on installing tarballs, and nothing happened
2007-03-10T12:26:00.000Z	dager	T3hMikey	so you tried to compile from source?
2007-03-10T12:27:00.000Z	dager	T3hMikey	i believe the last step in the process ("make install" or "checkinstall") requires root, but configure and make don't
