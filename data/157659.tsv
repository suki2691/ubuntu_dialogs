2006-11-21T14:17:00.000Z	Bueller		so here's what happens when i try to boot of the CD: the main Ubuntu menu loads and i choose "Start or Install Ubuntu," the Linux Kernel loads, the Ubuntu logo shows up and the slidebar runs for a while, then i just get dropped to a screen with a blinking cursor and it stalls there... anyone know what might be causing that?
