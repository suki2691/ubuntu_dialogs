2011-05-20T00:30:00.000Z	frostschutz	JKA	try memtester
2011-05-20T00:32:00.000Z	frostschutz	JKA	you have to install it. also because it runs under linux, it can only test memory that is currently free. If you're looking for a more complete solution, try memtest86(+) but that doesn't run in the terminal, but rather has to be booted with grub
