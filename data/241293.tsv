2009-05-10T08:22:00.000Z	ssj4Gogeta		I upgraded from 8.10 to 9.04 and now in my grub menu there are 4 new entries in addition to the old 8.10 entry. the new entries are called 9.04 and then what I think is a kernel number.
2009-05-10T08:22:00.000Z	ssj4Gogeta		the two have different kernel numbers
2009-05-10T08:23:00.000Z	ssj4Gogeta		so now there are 5 ubuntu entries: 8.04, 9.04 kernel something -7 and 9.04 kernel something -11 and their safe modes
