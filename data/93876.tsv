2008-07-25T01:42:00.000Z	watchme		Does anyone can give me an idea, why I cant print from scribus over my printserver (Cups with Turboprint)? I only get a white sheet of paper (btw. I can print from image viewers or OpenOffice)
2008-07-25T01:44:00.000Z	watchme		no one even an idea?
2008-07-25T01:44:00.000Z	Mecha25	watchme	sorry, I've never used scribus
