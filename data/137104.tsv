Further information may be found in /var/log/syslog. Do you want to try running this step again before continuing? If you do not, your installation may fail entirely or may be broken."

2007-06-01T09:21:00.000Z	EADG_	Tru7h	continue, what can it hurt?
2007-06-01T09:21:00.000Z	Tru7h	EADG_	Okay, thanks. As long as it's safe :P
