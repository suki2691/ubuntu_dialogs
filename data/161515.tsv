2006-12-06T09:41:00.000Z	SidSilver4		hello,
2006-12-06T09:42:00.000Z	SidSilver4		is there a way to set a different language for a different user?
2006-12-06T09:44:00.000Z	SidSilver4		if it's the other way around, need to set permission properly perhaps?
2006-12-06T09:45:00.000Z	Vorbote	SidSilver4	The user in question should add an "export LANG=blah" to his/her .bashrc
