2007-11-04T23:26:00.000Z	Jimdb		ashfire908:  in your fstab file or using "mount" .  I don't know the parameters
2007-11-04T23:27:00.000Z	Jimdb		the new linux client for ETQW says that it must be compiled with the low latency kernel.  How do I determine if the default ubuntu kernel was compiled as a low latency kernel?
