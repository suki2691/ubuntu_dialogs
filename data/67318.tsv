2009-02-06T12:45:00.000Z	error404notfound		3 issues. 1. My top and bottom panels keep disappearing, everytime I have to rename .gnome2 and restart gdm to get them work. 2. Mic doesn't work if I close volume manager. The mic section gets muted again if I close volume manager. 3. Fonts of applications in wine are not appearing correctly though I install corefonts using winetricks.
