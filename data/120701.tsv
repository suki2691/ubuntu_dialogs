2008-09-05T23:39:00.000Z	tcleval	danbhfive	so is that and http problem? is it overloaded?
2008-09-05T23:41:00.000Z	danbhfive	tcleval	maybe, I can't tell from where I'm sitting.  But just so you know, medibuntu is a repo for items that can't be included in the official repos, hence, if its in medibuntu, you won't ever find it in an official place
