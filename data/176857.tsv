2012-04-19T17:11:00.000Z	l403		I am installing Ubuntu 11.10 or something on virtualbox. I am at a creen that says for best results have: 4.5G space, AC power , internet. I have AC power only and the continue button is greyed out. How do I continue?

2012-04-19T17:14:00.000Z	fidel	l403	my vote is - get more space if you use the default install medium
2012-04-19T17:18:00.000Z	fidel	l403	dont blame us - write to canonical if you really think it is misleading
