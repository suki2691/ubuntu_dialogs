2004-10-16T10:52:00.000Z	pyramid	daniels	he has a few problems and i am telling him who cares if this stuff is mostly crap and doesn't work..he did not pay for it anyway
2004-10-16T10:53:00.000Z	daniels	pyramid	your conversation on 'let go of earthly things' et al is very much off-topic for #ubuntu.  also, politeness when dealing with others is appreciated.
2004-10-16T10:54:00.000Z	pyramid	daniels	i am being polite...i did not degrade him...i am enlightening him to make use of whatever crap he can find for free as best as he can instead of complaining that it doesn't work as well as MS software
