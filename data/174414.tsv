2007-02-08T07:53:00.000Z	lmosher	stevenb486	I used to play Source games (HL and Day of Defeat) on linux. Worked pretty well, but it's completely hit or miss w/ the games.... imho if you play games more than you do work, just use XP :P

I have to offer the advice that there's no perfect solution to get Windows programs working 100% (or even 70%). Don't use Linux just because it's 'leet'.. if you use Windows programs you might as well use Windows :P
2007-02-08T07:59:00.000Z	lmosher	stevenb486	I used to use XP for office type stuff, and play Source games (and a few others.. etc.) It's a very large pain overall. That's basically the deal :/
