2011-06-15T23:50:00.000Z	Somelauw		Is there a apt-remove-repositoty command or is is safe to manually remove the repository file in /etc/apt/sources.d/ ?
2011-06-15T23:50:00.000Z	Somelauw		Seems weird that there is no command to remove repositories.
2011-06-15T23:51:00.000Z	celthunder	Somelauw	remove them from sources.lst or whatever
2011-06-16T00:14:00.000Z	Somelauw	celthunder	It is not in sources.lst it is in sources.d
