2008-12-07T03:58:00.000Z	hou5ton		I have 8.04 working fine on this system .. is there a real compelling need to update it to 8.10?
2008-12-07T03:59:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	hou5ton	no, 8.04 is an LTS release, you can as well use it for some time. if you want "newer" apps, it's however not bad to upgrade
2008-12-07T04:01:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	hou5ton	there are no big changes.. you could as well try the live cd and decide later
2008-12-07T04:01:00.000Z	hou5ton	zsquareplusc	 thanks .... ya ... I'll probably sit tight for a while ... this is working sweet
