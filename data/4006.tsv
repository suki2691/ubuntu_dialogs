2012-07-28T19:08:00.000Z	sirriffsalot		Hi! I've moved my daily-in-use computer up to the attic, but for some reason I can't get it connected to the internet with 12.04.. I am sitting with an ubuntu-laptop right next to it using the same cable with no problems at all.. I've had this problem for a while, could someone please help figure out what's wrong with my computer?:S

2012-07-28T19:11:00.000Z	sirriffsalot	Igramul	yes, it works on all other machines..
