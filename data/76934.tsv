2008-11-20T02:49:00.000Z	a1len		Hi guys. Can someone give me a hand.. I'm attempting to configure Mutt, and I'm trying to set up fetchmail... I'm a little lost on the tutorial. It says to save a couple lines of code in the home directory.. does it mean in the Mutt MUA directory?

2008-11-20T02:51:00.000Z	quilzo	a1len	I sent you a private message
