2006-06-14T11:35:00.000Z	n30n	Tonren	Okay, this is just totally theory. But TRY installing xubuntu in symantec. It MIGHT help. Also make sure you have downloaded bug updates in the update manager
2006-06-14T11:36:00.000Z	Tonren	n30n	Shouldn't the bug updates automatically download with Update Manager?  Also, installing Xubuntu seems like a pretty complex task... what does it entail?  And I know I could just Google this, but I don't really know what Xubuntu is, anyway.
2006-06-14T11:37:00.000Z	n30n	Tonren	No, it's easy. Just open up Symantic, in system>administration and press 'ctrl+f" and type in "xubuntu"
