2006-11-07T17:07:00.000Z	Madpilot	alluc	Inkscape is the SVG editor of choice
2006-11-07T17:08:00.000Z	alluc	Madpilot	I need to repeat some specific operations to a big amount of SVG pictures
2006-11-07T17:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	alluc	try the #inkscape channel; inkscape has a fair number of command-line capabilities, but I don't use those myself
