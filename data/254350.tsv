2005-03-26T12:27:00.000Z	gabaug		how can I just download a packge that I already have installed but is no longer in my /var/cache?
2005-03-26T12:28:00.000Z	gabaug		is there a new format that hoary's 10-4 kernel now takes?? I have some custom built modules that can't be loaded ("Invalid module format")
2005-03-26T12:28:00.000Z	da_bon_bon	gabaug	rebuild the modules
2005-03-26T12:28:00.000Z	gabaug	da_bon_bon	I built them on a freshly installed hoary system (that has 10-4 kernel) and they don't load..
