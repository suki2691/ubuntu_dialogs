2009-06-03T05:49:00.000Z	Ryan_Delaney		Question: In the repository there is no 64-bit version of a package that I want.  Is there someone I should inform of this?
2009-06-03T05:49:00.000Z	jrib	Ryan_Delaney	what package?
2009-06-03T05:49:00.000Z	Ryan_Delaney	jrib	zsnes
2009-06-03T05:49:00.000Z	jrib	Ryan_Delaney	bugs.ubuntu.com, but my guess is it doesn't build on 64bit
