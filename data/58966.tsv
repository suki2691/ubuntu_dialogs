2009-04-28T00:22:00.000Z	Guest98107		I put in a flash drive, opened it, and closed it. Pressed unmount, and it didn't unmount. So I pulled it out of the system, and now the shortcut on the desktop is stuck there
2009-04-28T00:22:00.000Z	Guest98107		How can I remove it?
2009-04-28T00:23:00.000Z	Guest98107		Hello...? Anyone wanna help me?
