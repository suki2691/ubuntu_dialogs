2012-01-13T08:52:00.000Z	fermulator		Has anyone had problems with a lagging PC after a timeout? (monitors asleep) -- waking up with mouse, the screen is "hung", CTRL+ALT+F1, top, shows "apt-show-versions" using 100% CPU.  If I kill that process, the GUI is unblocked and usable again.  Thoughts/ideas?
