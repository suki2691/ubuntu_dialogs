2009-12-20T13:04:00.000Z	shane2	Psinetic	 you could label the cam 'god' or something.
2009-12-20T13:09:00.000Z	shane2	Psinetic	hire someone to be an external admin to your system. give them the root password and have them install your proxy.  then you can' teasily break it...
2009-12-20T13:13:00.000Z	shane2	Psinetic	cage the computer with a padlock. setup the filtering proxie and get someone else to change the root password.  that'll keep you 'safe'.
