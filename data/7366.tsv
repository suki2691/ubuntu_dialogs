2012-01-28T02:14:00.000Z	caravone	schnuffle	 System works in recovery mode (except bad screen resolution and sleep / reboot doesn't work).  It's a new x220 with SSD.  Is there some diagnostic I can run to check for bad hardware?
2012-01-28T02:15:00.000Z	schnuffle	caravone	to recapitulate: every time when you do a fresh install, your system works and the degrades?
2012-01-28T02:16:00.000Z	caravone	schnuffle	yes.  The last time, I noticed I had just updated packages before I failed to reboot for the first time
