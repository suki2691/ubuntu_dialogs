2012-02-12T06:33:00.000Z	pkkid		Can someone help me figure out this forest of new window managers.  Basically I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 via Virtualbox on Win7 host in Seamless Mode.  I always used to run Gnome2 (2D mode works great).  But all these new window managers seem to run 3D mode and its really screwy in Virtualbox.
