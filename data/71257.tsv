2009-12-07T00:45:00.000Z	Pupbuntoo		hi, i haven't upgraded in awhile; when i try to use update-manager, it tells me that us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/feisty/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz cannot be reached, etc
2009-12-07T00:46:00.000Z	robbmunson	Pupbuntoo	back up your important files and use an alternate-install cd to upgrade
2009-12-07T00:46:00.000Z	Pupbuntoo	robbmunson	is there no way to just tell it a more recent repo?
2009-12-07T00:47:00.000Z	robbmunson	Pupbuntoo	well, you kinda will end up with a frankenstein pc if you get what I mean ;)
