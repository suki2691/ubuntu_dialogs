2008-04-03T18:51:00.000Z	JPRuskin		sorry, okay, I'm trying to install the GRUB boot loader, it's had a lovely fatal error- is the LILO bootloader a substitute or am I in trouble/should research another way to boot.
2008-04-03T18:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	JPRuskin	lilo is substitute yes but it is an older less flexible desing...
2008-04-03T18:53:00.000Z	JPRuskin	erUSUL	can I reattempt to install GRUB after the ubuntu installation (I assume so), and if so should I install LILO now as a way to boot ubuntu?
