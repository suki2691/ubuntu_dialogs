2007-10-22T00:25:00.000Z	FotoPhocus		I'm installing Ubuntu tomorrow night when I get my new PC built.  I've got a 400gb hard drive and 200gb hard drive.  400 will go to XP, pics, music, etc.  The other drive will go to Ubuntu
2007-10-22T00:25:00.000Z	FotoPhocus		Could be, but I don't have anything else to do with it
2007-10-22T00:26:00.000Z	FotoPhocus		I had a 200gb first, and the 400gb I got on special for $100
2007-10-22T00:26:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	FotoPhocus	give me the 200GB, and partition the 400GB
