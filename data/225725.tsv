2009-02-10T21:22:00.000Z	fiftyone		Can someone help me use gparted? I have a bunch of unallocated space i want to add to my ubuntu machine but the last time i played with qparted i near ruined everything
2009-02-10T21:24:00.000Z	fiftyone		basically what i need now is to turn this unallocated space into a storage partition
