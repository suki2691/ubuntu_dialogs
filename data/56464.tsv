2011-05-10T09:44:00.000Z	ahriman		I'm still using 10.10 but I'd like to get rid of the stupid volume control popups. I'm using a plain 104-us keyboard and a 5 button USB mouse. I can't seem to get the volume popup that appears at random to go away, or find a button to disable. Please help :(
2011-05-10T09:44:00.000Z	GhostWolf	ahriman	i never had any volume popup
2011-05-10T09:46:00.000Z	GhostWolf	ahriman	like i said never had that problem and i know the popups but never had any of that on 10.10
2011-05-10T09:47:00.000Z	GhostWolf	ahriman	but as cellthunder said remove it from the tray if it does that
