2009-06-17T21:47:00.000Z	Acedip		how to check which version of gtk is installed on my system?
2009-06-17T21:48:00.000Z	racecar56	Acedip	go to synaptic and look up libgtk2.0-0
2009-06-17T21:48:00.000Z	racecar56	Acedip	just type libgtk2.0-0 and it will show up in the list
2009-06-17T21:49:00.000Z	racecar56	Acedip	or you could do dpkg -l | grep libgtk2.0-0 if you are on the console
