2007-06-17T05:56:00.000Z	r4ge	ajmorris_	killall -9 appname, eg killall -9 gaim
2007-06-17T05:56:00.000Z	ajmorris_	r4ge	i wanna kill everything, not just one app
2007-06-17T05:57:00.000Z	ajmorris_	r4ge	mainly just for the sleeping apps that won't kill on shutdown (144) (i believe i have a memory leak but can't find a patch)
