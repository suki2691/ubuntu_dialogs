2008-05-12T01:17:00.000Z	szx0		My entire life, I never liked upgrading anything... things always just went wrong... If I install Ubuntu 7.10 and perform an upgrade to 8.04.... would that be exactly the same as downloading the 8.04 CD???? ....

2008-05-12T01:18:00.000Z	szx0	Tor-Mentor	blah alright.
2008-05-12T01:18:00.000Z	Tor-Mentor	szx0	you could try but it will probably be more problem than downloading the cd =)
