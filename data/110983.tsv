2008-07-23T12:26:00.000Z	AgentHeX		would it be better to have 3 active drives in RAID-1 or 2 active drives and 1 spare?  what is the difference?  can ubuntu spin down spare SCSI drives?
2008-07-23T12:28:00.000Z	eth01	AgentHeX	2 active and 1 spare
2008-07-23T12:29:00.000Z	AgentHeX	eth01	is there a benefit to running 1 spare?  does ubuntu spin down the disk until another one fails?
2008-07-23T12:31:00.000Z	AgentHeX	eth01	i suppose it's relevant to mention that i'm using ubuntu server.
