2008-01-25T03:44:00.000Z	yoshi		Hi all, I am attempting to install Ubuntu on a VERY old IBM thinkpad (a t21). I'm stuck on the part where it says "Where are you?" (selecting the timezone). I double clicked on the dot that indicates my city (the dot is now blinking), but nothing else has happened. it's been doing that for 10 minutes now. What do I do to continue to the next page?

2008-01-25T03:48:00.000Z	yoshi	jeffMASTERflex	ado you know of any forms for installing ubuntu through the terminal, or would that just leave me in the same position?
