2009-04-11T15:34:00.000Z	ninadsp	penthief	the recommeneded way is update-rc.d and invoke-rc.d ..... check out their man pages.. :)
2009-04-11T15:34:00.000Z	penthief	ninadsp	Perfect. I had not heard of those before.
2009-04-11T15:35:00.000Z	ninadsp	penthief	ga ahead and try... they'll do your work :)
