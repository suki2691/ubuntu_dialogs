2010-11-24T17:27:00.000Z	tinytim		i am being told not to use ubuntu for a server, that debian is more efficient -- is this true?
2010-11-24T17:27:00.000Z	tinytim		i am used to ubuntu -- not sure if debian is going to force me to learn new stuff i don't care about
2010-11-24T17:28:00.000Z	tinytim		but if it is cli, does it matter?
2010-11-24T17:30:00.000Z	najwa__	tinytim	i think debian and ubuntu share a lot of thing
