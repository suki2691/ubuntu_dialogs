2009-03-17T05:17:00.000Z	smitty__		I have an ubuntu 8.10 server hosted with Mosso that I'm trying to configure.  I have root access so the first thing that I did was add a user account for myself.  I've logged in with that new account but now instead of getting a prompt that says "smitty@mysever:~$" i get something that just says $.  My tab complete is now also not working?  Are these problems connected and how could I get tab complete working?
