2012-08-31T22:37:00.000Z	lullabud		i just loaded ubuntu 12.04 on a Pavilion DM4.  the display is being recognized as 1024x768, but it's actually a higher resolution display.  how can i fix this?
2012-08-31T22:38:00.000Z	lullabud		i have to boot with nomodeset or the display just goes black, so perhaps that's part of it.
2012-08-31T22:39:00.000Z	BluesKaj	lullabud	install the recommende/restricteed drivers in jockey
2012-08-31T22:45:00.000Z	lullabud	BluesKaj	from what i can see, i have the additional drivers installed, but jockey says there are no proprietary drivers being used and gives me no options to enable.
