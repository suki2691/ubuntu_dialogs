2008-02-22T06:45:00.000Z	kaiden	OriginalMP3	same problem i'm having, and i have a HDMI cable'd monitor which is apparently the cause... due to the graphics drivers
2008-02-22T06:46:00.000Z	kaiden	OriginalMP3	yeah it effects dvi/hdmi
2008-02-22T06:46:00.000Z	kaiden	OriginalMP3	yup, 32bit works fine for me too
