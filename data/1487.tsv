2012-08-28T01:42:00.000Z	dlynes_laptop	opieng	during install, or you won't have anywhere to install to
2012-08-28T01:43:00.000Z	opieng	dlynes_laptop	but there is an option to let Ubunut delete all the current paritions and use the whole HDD for ext4
2012-08-28T01:44:00.000Z	dlynes_laptop	opieng	correct
