2011-05-17T21:37:00.000Z	immesys	llutz	I need to kludge in a btrfs scan before it tries to mount my filesystems. Trying to find the appropriate place to stick it. Otherwise it complains about not finding the filesystem.
2011-05-17T21:37:00.000Z	llutz	immesys	/etc/init.d/mountall maybe
2011-05-17T21:38:00.000Z	immesys	llutz	ok, will try that. Thanks
