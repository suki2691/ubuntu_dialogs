2012-06-27T15:17:00.000Z	yandex2389	paulus68	Just pipe the output into a text file. I suggest reading a book on shell scripts...
2012-06-27T15:19:00.000Z	paulus68	yandex2389	in order to do this I need to google on bash script that creates logfiles or ftp that creates logfiles?
2012-06-27T15:23:00.000Z	yandex2389	paulus68	You need to read about piping output - it's a general principle, not specific to FTP. Bash scripting works by chaining lots of utilities together
