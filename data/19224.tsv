2011-04-18T20:36:00.000Z	alkisg	ThinkT510	/ DirtyDawg: thank you guys for the ppa solution, but I'd specifically like to know if an official backport will ever be made for firefox 4 on 10.04
2011-04-18T20:37:00.000Z	ThinkT510	alkisg	sorry, not sure, you might be able to request it, but again i wouldn't know how to go about it
2011-04-18T20:38:00.000Z	alkisg	ThinkT510	yeah, SRUs aren't for newer versions. But I think I once read some ubuntu-devs discussion about new browser versions in LTS updates... and I thought that would cover firefox too, not just chromium-browser
