2007-03-24T15:29:00.000Z	variant	joshua__	depends what paplication youwant to use it with, if it's a well supported cam then it should be available as soon as you plug it in (note that ubuntu won't alert you to the fact that hardware has been plugged in/installed)
2007-03-24T15:34:00.000Z	variant	joshua__	no, just plug in the webcam and open the program you will be using it with
2007-03-24T15:34:00.000Z	variant	joshua__	in a terminal type dmsg | tail and put the contents on http://rafb.net/paste and give me the link
