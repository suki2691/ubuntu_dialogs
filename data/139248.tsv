2007-04-15T07:27:00.000Z	Kamaria		Hey everyone. I'm running a dual boot of Ubuntu and Windows XP. I can access my Windows partition from Linux, but I can't boot into windows at all, it hangs at the 'Starting Up...' message.
2007-04-15T07:28:00.000Z	Kamaria		Does anyone know what I can do to fix my problem?
2007-04-15T07:29:00.000Z	mystery_	Kamaria	I think there is a way
2007-04-15T07:29:00.000Z	mystery_	Kamaria	Just get rid of windows
