2009-10-05T05:59:00.000Z	dotakuis		are there any drivers for the ATI Radeon HD 4870 1GB video card? checked the AMD website and all they had was 4800 driver not the 4870 and it crashes Gui. anyone know what I might do? Proprietary hardware drivers not in use and when activated and restart computer it fails to load gui. Envyng was installed and tried to use it but pretty much same result as the proprietary drivers.
