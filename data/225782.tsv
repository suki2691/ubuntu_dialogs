2010-07-20T20:35:00.000Z	scorchgeek		I'm trying to set up a static IP address on my desktop so I can use ssh. If I try to go into the network manager applet on the panel and reset the IP, nothing happens. If I turn off the DHCP server on my router and reboot, my IP address changes to what I set, but I can't access the internet. What am I missing?
2010-07-20T20:36:00.000Z	scorchgeek		so what do I need to do to fix it?
2010-07-20T20:36:00.000Z	scorchgeek		I did that, do I need to reboot after that?
