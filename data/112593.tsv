2009-04-23T06:37:00.000Z	^Phantom^		Now, I want to do more with linux than just chat.  My question now is:  what is the recommended bittorrent client for ubuntu?  I'm looking to use one that is similar to BitTorrent on windoze, but I prefer one that is simple to use, but not so simple a 2-year old can use it.  Any suggestions?
2009-04-23T06:37:00.000Z	Frijolie	^Phantom^	I use deluge-torrent
2009-04-23T06:38:00.000Z	Frijolie	^Phantom^	or just "deluge"
