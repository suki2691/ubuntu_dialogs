2006-08-06T10:51:00.000Z	sensei		Okay, someone *must* know this now, I'm dying of curiosity.. I've tried numerous distros the last few days, and the *only* one that's gotten my K8M800 UniChrome IGP graphics adapter to work is ubuntu.. What have you done to it that no other distro has managed to do?
2006-08-06T10:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	sensei	more than likely the other distros you tried didnt have the drivers for it preinstalled
2006-08-06T10:52:00.000Z	sensei	gnomefreak	ubuntu uses the regular xorg via_drv.. or so it seems
2006-08-06T10:52:00.000Z	sensei	gnomefreak	I've tried to install other drivers from source, but they tend to lock my whole system up
