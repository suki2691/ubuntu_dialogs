I don't know how it's happening or what key I may or may not be hitting or if my touchpad is doing something odd but, what ever I had copied seems to somehow insert itself into whatever text field i'm typing in, as if there's some type of middle button being pressed
2010-09-29T08:37:00.000Z	atude		ANY ideas?
