2004-10-29T05:45:00.000Z	rexiboy		apt-get update should do the trick?
2004-10-29T05:46:00.000Z	Hmmmmm_	rexiboy	i think "apt-get upgrade" ought to do the trick. correct me if i'm wrong
2004-10-29T05:47:00.000Z	rexiboy	Hmmmmm_	that's good, because I got everything working and would like to keep it like this...:)
