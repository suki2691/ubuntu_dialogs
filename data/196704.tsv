2007-02-11T17:57:00.000Z	Gator		Anyone, when booting Ubuntu I get this message: BusyBox v1.01 (Debian 1:1.01-4ubuntu3) built-in shell (ash)
2007-02-11T17:58:00.000Z	Gator		that error message comes before the /bin/sh: Can't access tty; Job control turned off
2007-02-11T17:58:00.000Z	n4cht	Gator	as i've never had anything remarkable happen during an ubuntu boot or install, aside from it "just working", i'm afraid you've got me stumped.
2007-02-11T07:14:00.000Z	Gator	n4cht	wouldn't it be 1,000,000x1phone=megaphone?
