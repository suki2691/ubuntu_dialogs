2007-02-16T06:01:00.000Z	Salwan		I'm new to ubuntu and to linux as a whole, I have an rpm that I want to install but the terminal is telling me that there is no "rpm" command how should I install it if it was possible?
2007-02-16T06:01:00.000Z	LjL	Salwan	why do you want to install an RPM? Ubuntu packages are in the .deb format, not in the RPM format
