2011-02-19T13:02:00.000Z	sgtmattbaker		I connected to a website by accident that looks like it has been hacked. I wasnt trying to sign in to another one or anything. Could anything have happened?
2011-02-19T13:02:00.000Z	sgtmattbaker		I said I didnt enter anything
2011-02-19T13:02:00.000Z	sgtmattbaker		the website just popped up
