2011-05-19T01:30:00.000Z	Minze		got an audio-book here, and want to transfer it to the MP3-Player... sadly the ID3-Tags are f..... up and i would like to remove them at all... so that i can sort them by filename
2011-05-19T01:31:00.000Z	Minze		Sadly i know nether an tool too remove them at all, nor a tool to rename them all at the same time like in WIN
2011-05-19T01:32:00.000Z	Minze		So that the filenames would be like 1(001).mp3 1(002).mp3 and so on
2011-05-19T01:33:00.000Z	escott	Minze	there should be an id3tag command line tool which could wipe them all
