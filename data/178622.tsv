2009-09-09T04:28:00.000Z	credo	_MrsApple_	depends. if you use service like juno it only gives insight whats in the song/album - at 45 seconds and bad quality
2009-09-09T04:30:00.000Z	credo	_MrsApple_	if the page is covered 60 % with ads then i suggest you to look for other sources
2009-09-09T04:31:00.000Z	credo	_MrsApple_	use torrents? but this is ubuntu help channel so lets stay on subject =)
