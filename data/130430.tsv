2007-12-20T22:59:00.000Z	mahrellon		Or is it safe to install/update :)
2007-12-20T22:59:00.000Z	chazco	mahrellon	- I'm using 7.10 with Nvidia drivers, seems fine to me
2007-12-20T23:00:00.000Z	mahrellon	chazco	But, are you using the very latest drivers from nvidia? I'm just about to upgrade by using envy but don't wanna "brick" my system. :)
