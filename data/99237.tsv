2008-02-26T08:01:00.000Z	pkazakoff		Hey, can somebody help me?  I'm having trouble logging into a KDE session.
2008-02-26T08:01:00.000Z	pkazakoff		I'm currently at the console using BitchX.
2008-02-26T08:02:00.000Z	chris0	pkazakoff	what's the issue? X not running? KDM not starting?
2008-02-26T08:04:00.000Z	chris0	pkazakoff	whoa...man that one's over my head...I haven't dealt much with KDE in years
