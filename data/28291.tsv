2010-07-27T02:48:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	peripher4l	not to be rude, but if you are using Fedora what are you doing here?
2010-07-27T02:49:00.000Z	peripher4l	ZykoticK9	I can only boot from Fedora, but i'm having trouble with Ubuntu (both on flash drives...)
2010-07-27T02:50:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	peripher4l	I'll guess a Plymouth problem ;)  Sorry man, just checkin' - you're perfectly entitled to be here - so long as you're working on booting Ubuntu ;)
