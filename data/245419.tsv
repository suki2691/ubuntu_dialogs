2005-05-26T09:31:00.000Z	IFRFLYR		I updated Ubuntu's Mozilla Firefox using the automatic update feature, now my extensions no longer work AND Mozilla.org/firefox won't let me access the Extensions page to get new ones because I'm using Ubuntu 1.02. What should I do?
2005-05-26T09:33:00.000Z	IFRFLYR		Put different: How can I update Firefox to latest other than manual install of 1.0.4  (ubuntu firefox is 1.0.2)?
