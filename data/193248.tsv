2007-10-06T06:17:00.000Z	salox		some basic applications like test editors and html editors, moves really slow. Lot of CPU used, and image is fragmented when scroll left and right in  the text window. Other applications runs good like GIMP. What can i do to move it faster ? I have a 900Mhz Duron, 512 Mb RAM. What is the reason for so much processor usage? Kernel problem ?
