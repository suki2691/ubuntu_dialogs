2011-04-11T03:27:00.000Z	Gumby	cavalier_prime	sorry, I should be more specific.  via command line
2011-04-11T03:29:00.000Z	Gumby	cavalier_prime	yes, I know how to start/stop services.  Just need to disable.  You used to be able to use chkconfig etc to enable/disable items for different runlevels.  It seems like a step backwards to go back to needing to edit txt files in order to change what starts on each runlevel
