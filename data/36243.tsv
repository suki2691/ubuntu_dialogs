It could be a coincidence, with some hardware / kernel error occurring at the same time. In my experience, the vast majority of such hard freezes have been due to kernel issues or hardware issues.
2010-03-15T04:45:00.000Z	lucid_interval	rpgsimmaster	also correct. I misread your orig post. Ability to REBOOT should not be affected. Only changes to installed kernel(s), bootloader and/or other (rare) low-levelc hanges, such as busybox, init, libc should affect ability to reboot.
2010-03-15T04:47:00.000Z	lucid_interval	rpgsimmaster	the only thing that comes to my feeble mind is th epossibility that some low-level graphics driver is grabbing the PCI/PCI-E bus and a "warm" reboot does not reset that. Can you (i know it takes a long time) try to differentiate between warm reboot and cold reboot (turn off, pull power cord out and try again)?
2010-03-15T04:51:00.000Z	rpgsimmaster	lucid_interval	any idea why my wubi disks file, and the disks folder might be pulling arbitrary vanishing acts?
