2011-03-23T17:41:00.000Z	alesan		hey can I install linux-2.6.38 from some PPA thing?
2011-03-23T17:42:00.000Z	elFidel	alesan	in case you arent used to work with ppa's - you should most likely not mess around with kernel in general
2011-03-23T17:43:00.000Z	elFidel		just my feeling
2011-03-23T17:43:00.000Z	alesan	elFidel	but do you know if it's possible?
