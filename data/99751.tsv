2008-08-31T20:53:00.000Z	crrj		I'm having an interesting issue on a Ubuntu Server setup. When I try sudo it takes the password but doesn't actually run the commands.

2008-08-31T20:55:00.000Z	dmoerner	crrj	it is possible you are having some weird problem with the previous sudo /var/run file. it might be worth removing /var/run/sudo/yourusername to reset that
