2006-01-23T07:02:00.000Z	overrider		for some reason my grub doesnt show up when i switch on the computer. it turns on only when done loading the os selected (blindly) in grub. the monitor is a dvi connected lcd screen to an at radeon9800 pro card. when using vga monitor all is fine. how can i make it so my pc uses dvi already at bootup? i cant seem to find the option in the bios...

2006-01-23T07:05:00.000Z	overrider	nbound	its a bummer i know. but my screen is black during bios post messages and grub, until it reaches either ubuntu or windows...i assume if i dont find an option in the bios, or a jumper on the card i am hooped huh?
2006-01-23T07:06:00.000Z	nbound	overrider	thats just weird hence why i dont like ati, there cards always have weird quirks
