2006-06-11T16:41:00.000Z	acidjedi		Hmm, has anyone here used gparted and could help me with it?
2006-06-11T16:42:00.000Z	eugman	acidjedi	I suggest you burna  livecd and use gparted from that so you are certain the drives you are affecting are not mounted.
2006-06-11T16:43:00.000Z	acidjedi	eugman	when I try to use gparted now, it doesn't allow me to resize any drives or anything. If I boot from the live cd it will?
