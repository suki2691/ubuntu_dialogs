2012-05-26T16:06:00.000Z	ashwinharry_		 I am unable to open a lot of websites in Ubuntu 12.04. The browser shows loading forever for a particular set of websites, including facebook and wordpress. However, I am able to access these websites through theproxyfree.com. This happens in all the browsers and even for wget.
2012-05-26T16:07:00.000Z	ashwinharry_		but these are for specific websites only
2012-05-26T16:07:00.000Z	ashwinharry_		the rest work fine
2012-05-26T16:07:00.000Z	theadmin	ashwinharry_	Does it happen in other operating systems?
