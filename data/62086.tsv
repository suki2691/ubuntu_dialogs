2010-03-18T01:08:00.000Z	teage		i am trying to install a game called egoboo 2.7.4 and the instructions tell me to run this command ( make -f Makefile.unix) yet it does not work. I have noticed the makefile and its called (makefile) without the .unix . Do you think that maybe the instructions are wrong?
