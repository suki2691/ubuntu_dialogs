2009-07-09T13:02:00.000Z	Phantal		I'm trying to get wireless working in ubuntu 9.04.  I upgraded last night from 8.04 and things aren't working anymore.  when I run "iwconfig wlan0 ap <mac address of the access point>", then iwconfig wlan0, the 'access point' setting says "not associated".  Anyone seen this before?
2009-07-09T13:02:00.000Z	mechdave	Phantal	are you running gnome desktop?
2009-07-09T13:03:00.000Z	Phantal	mechdave	nope, but I'd really rather avoid using gui tools for this if possible
2009-07-09T13:06:00.000Z	mechdave	Phantal	what card do you have?
