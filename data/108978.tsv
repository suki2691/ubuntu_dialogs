When I have sound on like music or a video, i plug in my headphones but the speakers on my laptop dont go off.  How can i make it so when i plug in my headphones, my speakers turn of and when i unplug them, they turn back on?

2007-12-26T12:37:00.000Z	Silver_Fox	bluefoxx	  its a pc.  The thing is, when i first got ubuntu, i had no problems.  Then when i reinstalled it like 5 months ago, the problem started.
