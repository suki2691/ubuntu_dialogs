2005-12-26T13:40:00.000Z	foxpaul		i've got a wireless router with two machines connected to it. the main machine is online and works fine, but the other machine can only ping inside the network, not out.
2005-12-26T13:40:00.000Z	foxpaul		any ideas what i might have done wrong?

2005-12-26T13:41:00.000Z	foxpaul	korhalf	how do i check that?
