2005-06-01T15:42:00.000Z	Troy_		can anyone help with the usb hdd issue? Also, I would like to know of any apps for mp3 playback. Did not like amarok, xmms, juk or rhythmbox
2005-06-01T15:43:00.000Z	Troy_		i will try it... I am a musicmatch user from windoze days, and I would like to have something like that...

2005-06-01T15:44:00.000Z	K_Dallas	Troy_	i think mplayer would not be your friend then
