2008-05-21T18:48:00.000Z	jmh7080	joaopinto	is there a way to run through configure to see all unmet dependencies without it breaking every time it encounters an unmet dependency?
2008-05-21T18:49:00.000Z	joaopinto	jmh7080	usually the source comes with a README/INSTALL text file which lists the required libraries
