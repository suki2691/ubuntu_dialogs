2008-02-07T19:31:00.000Z	bahadunn		how can I import the ubuntu archive key in debian?
2008-02-07T19:31:00.000Z	LjL	bahadunn	why would you do that?
2008-02-07T19:31:00.000Z	bahadunn	LjL	so I can maintain a ubuntu mirror on a debian server and so that debmirror can verify the signatures
2008-02-07T19:32:00.000Z	LjL	bahadunn	ah. sounds much better than what i was suspecting. well i don't know about debmirror, but perhaps you can just do this?
