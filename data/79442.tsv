2009-03-23T06:53:00.000Z	DrBanzai		Hey all, I had to make a bash script that is called by another program, but the calling program says it can't find my script in the $PATH...what do I do?
2009-03-23T06:54:00.000Z	DasEi	DrBanzai	copy it to /usr/bin ?
2009-03-23T06:59:00.000Z	DrBanzai	DasEi	I haven't done that, I'll try it, thanks.
2009-03-23T07:01:00.000Z	DrBanzai	DasEi	Thanks!  That seems to have done it.
