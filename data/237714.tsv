2005-05-12T06:50:00.000Z	vegalabs		hi. i've been a slack user for years, and now i've switched to ubuntu. i have two specific questions which might answer my more general questions: 1. when i try to apt-get vim-gnome or vim-gtk, i get a bunch of dependency failures (i.e. vim-gnome: Depends: vim (= 1:6.3-025+1ubuntu2) but 1:6.3-025+1ubuntu2.2 is to be installed). second, i can't compile a number of things successfully from source (such as vim).is this usual?
2005-05-12T06:51:00.000Z	vegalabs		my primary concern at the moment is getting gvim installed, but it isn't happening.
