2009-05-22T02:35:00.000Z	alfacat_		I have jaunty running on a dual core, with a old RCT display, and using an integrated graphics board, and I cant get it to show reolutions bigger than 800x600. I've read that jaunty uses RandR for xorg configuration, but how can I change resolution
2009-05-22T02:36:00.000Z	alfacat_		?
2009-05-22T02:37:00.000Z	alfacat_		yes I'm sure, it was working fine with ubuntu 8.04
