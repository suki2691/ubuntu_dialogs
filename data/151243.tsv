2007-01-19T16:40:00.000Z	MindFreek	ablyss	you dont think you can do it with Vino from GNOME... I like the server, just want to know if I can disconnect people who connect to it
2007-01-19T16:42:00.000Z	ablyss	MindFreek	maybe adding their IP/host to /etc/hosts.deny, but i believe that is controlled by /etc/init.d
2007-01-19T16:42:00.000Z	MindFreek	ablyss	I want to just boot the people connected, I want them to connect, but when we are done doing what we are doing, I want to boot them.
