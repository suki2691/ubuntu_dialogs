2012-09-01T12:33:00.000Z	mooser		THis is a strange problem. NOtice how the beginning of my sentences include two capitals? Well, over the years I have developed a terrible habit... and it may be too late to fix. Instead of holding shift like a normal person to capitalize my works, I hit Caps Lock, then hit the letter, then hit Caps Lock again. PRetty weird huh? I Took an official government typing test recently and scored 99 words a minute, so it hasn't been a huge hindrance until now tha
