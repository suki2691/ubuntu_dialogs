2008-05-15T22:12:00.000Z	tim167		hi, can anyone help me install ubuntu to boot from a usb key, I get the login window, but after that it hangs at an empty desktop...any ideas ?
2008-05-15T22:13:00.000Z	tim167		what does "kinit: no resume image, doing normal boot" mean ?

2008-05-15T22:14:00.000Z	Philh	tim167	that's probably unrelated to the message you're reporting
