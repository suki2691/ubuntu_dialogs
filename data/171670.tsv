2006-11-15T06:16:00.000Z	dawynn		(KDE question) I deleted some files in a root konqueror session.  So, now they're in root's trash.  How do I throw out the trash for root?
2006-11-15T06:17:00.000Z	dawynn		not sure what you mean -- "get root" -- please elaborate.

2006-11-15T06:19:00.000Z	neildarlow	dawynn	probably meant start KDE as root but "you don't want to do that(TM)"
