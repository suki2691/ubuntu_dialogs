2008-11-15T02:45:00.000Z	amriedle	hwilde	correct, but that one works given that in recovery mode i am able to boot into both x and gdm but in non-recovery mode it crashes... :/
2008-11-15T02:46:00.000Z	hwilde	amriedle	so just blow out hte xorg.conf and use the failsafe
2008-11-15T02:46:00.000Z	amriedle	hwilde	i had an idea... ill try it and get back if it works/doesn't work
