2007-05-31T14:39:00.000Z	_Codeman_		How do I get kernel headers? I apt-cache search'd it but didn't find "kernel-headers-*" of any kind :/
2007-05-31T14:40:00.000Z	_Codeman_		One last thing... I don't remember which kernel I have, is there a command to display my current kernel version?
2007-05-31T14:40:00.000Z	_Codeman_		Sweet! thanks
2007-05-31T14:41:00.000Z	redbox	_Codeman_	uname -r will give you just the version
