2008-12-05T04:12:00.000Z	Zaiden		Hi. When I try to resize my vista partition with the ubuntu installer, it stays at 0% done and won't continue. Is there another way I can resize my vista partition? I tried using the volume shrinker in Vista also but it won't let me shrink it for more than 128MB when I have 95GB free.

2008-12-05T04:24:00.000Z	[e]Lement	Zaiden	should be on the LIveCD
