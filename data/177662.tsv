2008-03-06T08:10:00.000Z	owh		This is going to sound like a dumb question, but can someone remind me how I can "apt-get source" from a different version other than my current OS, that is, I'm running Feisty and I want to apt-get source from Hardy.
2008-03-06T08:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	owh	Dont. it wont work
2008-03-06T08:11:00.000Z	owh	Jack_Sparrow	I am not compiling it, I just need to get the source.
2008-03-06T08:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	owh	that will get you access to a source file in that repo but if you are not going to compile what are you going to do with it
