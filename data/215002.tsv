2006-04-30T07:11:00.000Z	afd_		hi! I'm using dapper and I can't find xine or mplayer in the repos. I have multiverse and universe enabled, and run apt-get update. Any clues?
2006-04-30T07:11:00.000Z	cafuego	afd_	Nevertheless, it's there.
2006-04-30T07:12:00.000Z	afd_	cafuego	weird, I'll check again, I was looking under multimedia
