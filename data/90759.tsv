2012-03-04T18:43:00.000Z	schmakk		hello. i have a netbook running ubuntu server and i'd like to give it a bigger disk. since it only fits 1 disk at a time, how do i go about it, using an external usb box under windows?
2012-03-04T18:44:00.000Z	schmakk		can i just use something like ghost to move everything over and then resize partitions later?
