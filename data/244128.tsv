2005-03-30T09:02:00.000Z	Dillweed		hi all.  I was wondering if there was the possibility of getting an i686 release of ubunut?
2005-03-30T09:03:00.000Z	geneo91	Dillweed	 you may allready have 686
2005-03-30T09:05:00.000Z	geneo91	Dillweed	 just recompile them all or just get sources
2005-03-30T09:06:00.000Z	Dillweed	geneo91	easier said than done, eh?  I've been trying to get apt-build to work but so far ubuntu repositories don't have the source list for downloads just the packages
