2010-07-21T15:49:00.000Z	Bullterd		I have a folder with a load of sub folders in it. Each sub folder has another folder called "afoldername" and inside that folder is a load of files.
2010-07-21T15:49:00.000Z	Bullterd		I need to do a command that would go in and delete the .xml file inside "foldername" recursivly in the sub folders, any ideas what that command would look like?
2010-07-21T15:50:00.000Z	wxr3516	Bullterd	find ./foldername -type f -name "*.xml" -exec rm {} \;
