2008-09-15T19:20:00.000Z	mheath	cdh_phoenix	You should just have to setup the connection in Vista, and then connect with the Network Manager in Ubuntu. In Ubuntu, you'll have to manually specify the network name as ad hoc SSID's aren't broadcast  by Vista.

2008-09-15T19:22:00.000Z	cdh_phoenix	mheath	 could network manager 0.7 be the cause of the problem?
