2007-08-09T13:48:00.000Z	KC360		can i ask a question, i used Ubuntu Debian on my computer, worked fine, untill i tried booting with the live cd again, it just freezes at the start up menu
2007-08-09T13:48:00.000Z	KC360		what can cause this? ive tried this on my OLD and NEW DVD/Cd drives
2007-08-09T13:48:00.000Z	PotLimit	KC360	might have something to do with the video card
2007-08-09T13:49:00.000Z	PotLimit	KC360	ah - maybe some weird resolution that x is trying to do
