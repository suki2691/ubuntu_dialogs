2011-01-29T18:02:00.000Z	Diverdude		which IRC clients do you guys use? I use Xchat now, but i would like to use a client where i can define a server to connect to at startup, to identify me at startup and to automatically join a lit of channels at startup. Any suggestions for a nice client that can do that?
