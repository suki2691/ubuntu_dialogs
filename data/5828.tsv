2012-02-15T05:03:00.000Z	Freedom_		to boot from 2 hard drives
2012-02-15T05:03:00.000Z	Freedom_		i have got as far as installing grub customizer
2012-02-15T05:05:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Freedom_	there's probably a hardware workaround...Install one OS per HDD.  On boot, hit the f## key to bring up the temporary boot options.  Specify and fly.
