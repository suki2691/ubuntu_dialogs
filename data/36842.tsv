2010-05-16T05:22:00.000Z	Typos_King	tdnicholson	  better is relative, I know 'other' clients, I prefer xchat over 'others' though
2010-05-16T05:24:00.000Z	Typos_King	tdnicholson	  kvirc is a bit colorful, has avatars and stuff, you can also use pidgin or gaim for irc, there's also konversation, or quassel, as I said, I prefer xchat :)
2010-05-16T05:34:00.000Z	Typos_King	tdnicholson	  kubuntu already comes with Quassel irc, I've used konversation, you may like kvirc over it, GUI wise  http://lwn.net/images/ns/grumpy/irc/kvirc.png
