2008-01-03T08:39:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy		This is probably one of the most commonly asked questions, but I am having trouble finding something that works:  I just got a new monitor.  Was a CRT at 1024x768.  I now have a Viewsonic LCD at 1680x1050.  I cannot seem to make Xorg use 1680x1050, and I cannot seem to make it show up in my screen resolution menu.  Any suggestions?
