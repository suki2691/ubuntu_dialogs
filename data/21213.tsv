2011-02-23T06:16:00.000Z	travis_	strigoi66	have a win7 mochine, just installed ubuntu 10.10 in an "along side" install to dual boot.. recieved errors trying to boot into ubuntu after install, also into windows, read that i needed to install lilo from live cd to get back into windows, which i did... just want dual boot to work in the hopes that i can shitcan windows.. but need to dual boot for now.. thats it
2011-02-23T06:17:00.000Z	travis_	strigoi66	hope that made sense
