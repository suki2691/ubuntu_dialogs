2005-07-29T07:36:00.000Z	pcharky		Got a little question here, I can't make more than 1 app play music with alsa (without esd). Can anybody help me?
2005-07-29T07:36:00.000Z	Seveas	pcharky	that's exactly what esd is for....
2005-07-29T07:37:00.000Z	pcharky	Seveas	I know, but it should be possible with alsa as well, and if i run esd it can't run ut with sound. (I like my own music on the background).
