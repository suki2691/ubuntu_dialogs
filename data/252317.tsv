2005-04-08T10:58:00.000Z	bje		hi folks. I'm trying to get a persistent home directory working with Warty.  Is there a catch?  What does home=scan look for, exactly?
2005-04-08T10:59:00.000Z	bje		I have a loopback ext3 fs on a VFAT USB thumb drive (called `ubuntu.img') that I am trying to use as a persistent home directory.  When I boot with the appropriate GRUB menu option, Ubuntu does not mount it.
