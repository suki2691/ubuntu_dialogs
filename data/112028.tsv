2009-04-03T00:57:00.000Z	Thomas___		I got a problem with my Gnome 2.26 running on a Acer Aspire 5710Z. While it's not a problem to reduce the brightness of the screen with the shortcuts on the keyboard, I can't increase it... is there a simple solution? Tried to find one on the internet, but without succes...
