2008-01-25T03:24:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	cdecarlo	ntfs-3g is the only "reliable" way to write to NTFS paritions
2008-01-25T03:25:00.000Z	cdecarlo	jeffMASTERflex	ok how reliable is "reliable"
2008-01-25T03:25:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	cdecarlo	reliable enough to use at home. but not something i would use at work
