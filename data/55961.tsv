2009-06-20T21:05:00.000Z	Rigongia	lesshaste	: my guess is by the time it takes to start up, because (if i'm not wrong) suspension recovers from RAM, so is faster than hibernation
2009-06-20T21:06:00.000Z	lesshaste	Rigongia	ok but no log will tell you?
2009-06-20T21:07:00.000Z	Rigongia	lesshaste	: honestly i have no idea
