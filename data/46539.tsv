2011-07-03T21:14:00.000Z	jwash		i have a problem with workspaces, i only get the top two options (show only the current workspace, and show all workspaces in x rows) not the remainder (which allows you to add aditional workspaces) http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20080324/03_25_08UbuntuWorkspace1.jpg
2011-07-03T21:14:00.000Z	jwash		any ideas how to fix this?
