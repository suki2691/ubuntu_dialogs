2009-05-12T18:46:00.000Z	donkeyboy		I am running jaunty and need to run windows xp for some software, I have tried virtualbox, but the performance is pretty bad, is their anything better? or is my machine just not beefy enough?

2009-05-12T18:47:00.000Z	iratik	donkeyboy	pay special attention to the pagefile/virtual memory settings ... since what the VM thinks is RAM may not necessarily really ram
2009-05-12T18:48:00.000Z	donkeyboy	iratik	ok will do thanks, I would prefer to use virtualbox, but if vmware gives better performance that is what I will have to use
