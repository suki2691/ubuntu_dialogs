2006-04-16T05:27:00.000Z	axylfyre		is it possible to move data between windows and linux on a dual or multi boot system?
2006-04-16T05:28:00.000Z	intelikey	axylfyre	yes,   both systems can read/write to fat32
2006-04-16T05:30:00.000Z	intelikey	axylfyre	yes you can.   you can even not use a swap partition.   but that is not "officially recommended"
