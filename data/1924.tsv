2012-07-17T16:19:00.000Z	BrotherGA2		Hope this is the right place to ask. I'm looking to install Ubuntu for general usage and development, while keeping windows for gaming and other apps. How should I make my decision on whether to use a VM, Wubi, or Partition my HD? Is there a way to switch between these while keeping settings/apps? (I have a non-switchable Nvida GPU, btw)

2012-07-17T16:23:00.000Z	BrotherGA2	Seveas	Really? If so, then I might start out with a VM, and switch to a partitioned install if I'm disatistied with the performance. Should I expect graphics hardware acceleration work fine in a VM?
