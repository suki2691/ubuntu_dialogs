2009-04-06T09:53:00.000Z	nkei0		I'm having a problem with networking...  However, I don't think it's related to Ubuntu, but I don't know.  I set up my D-link wireless router from within Ubuntu and am using WPA with a pre-shared key.  However, I am dualbooting winxp and when i restart into xp it doesn't even detect the network....

2009-04-06T09:53:00.000Z	nkei0	doleyb	why is that?
2009-04-06T09:53:00.000Z	doleyb	nkei0	because it reduces security and is harder to configure
