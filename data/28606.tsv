I installed Windows 7 and afterwards I wanted to reinstall grub to the mbr.For some reason grub wouldn't reinstall to the mbr en I did something really dumb. I cleared the mbr with "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1". When I realized what I did it was too late. The entire mbr is erased including the partition table. Is there a way te rewrite the partition table without loosing everything or am I screwed?
