2011-05-25T22:58:00.000Z	p0lar_bear		i keep getting denied the ability to rm or chmod a few files even as root (via sudo). what do i do?
2011-05-25T23:00:00.000Z	p0lar_bear		it seems i can't do anything to them. rm and chmod both tell me "Operation not permitted" on all the files
2011-05-25T23:00:00.000Z	celthunder	p0lar_bear	what files do they exist? what arguemtns are you passing to rm or chmod
2011-05-25T23:12:00.000Z	celthunder	p0lar_bear	rm -rf them ? f should be force
