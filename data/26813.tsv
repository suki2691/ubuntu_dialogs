2010-11-15T19:52:00.000Z	id10t		anyone able to help w/ a livecd question?  trying to make a custom disc to load /homes from a flash drive (for persistence).. any ideas as to when to run the script and what file would call it during the live cd init process?  rc.local doesn't do it ...
2010-11-15T19:53:00.000Z	pksadiq	id10t	use a-linux or tinycore linux.  ;)  very fast
2010-11-15T19:54:00.000Z	id10t	pksadiq	not really an option either... this is for having a dev environment for c++ w/ support for gmpxx
