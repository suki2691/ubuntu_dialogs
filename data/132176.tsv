2007-06-03T11:04:00.000Z	ca-steve		Hi everyone - I am having some problems with screen resolution. I installed Feisty with a Radeon 9800 and a Samsung Syncmaster 243 (24-inch) and all I get is 1024x768. Any ideas?
2007-06-03T11:06:00.000Z	sx66	ca-steve	I have the same problem, we have to sit in line :D
2007-06-03T11:06:00.000Z	ca-steve	sx66	- my first time on here, so I don't know the protocol  :-)  I'll wait patiently  :-)
