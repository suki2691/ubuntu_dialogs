2007-02-17T07:44:00.000Z	zen		Cause I added them temporarily, and they had a bunch of updates....
2007-02-17T07:46:00.000Z	zen		So is it a good thing to have them enabled, or should I leave them off generally?  (With the understanding that I like the newest and greatest, but I don't want unstable stuff.)
