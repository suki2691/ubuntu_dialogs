2010-09-04T16:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	tuntun	you can easily disable java in openoffice. or you can try abiword for something lighter
2010-09-04T16:15:00.000Z	tuntun	erUSUL	I last used abiword about a year ago and it was a buggy POS. has it changed?
2010-09-04T16:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	tuntun	try it and see. it is only one apt-get away
