2009-02-10T23:07:00.000Z	Pilot_51		I've tried twice (both AMD64 and i386) and when I try checking the CD integrity or running it live or installing it it gives an error "CD boot failed" or something like that

2009-02-10T23:11:00.000Z	freazer	Pilot_51	I recommend http://www.imgburn.com/ for Windows ISO Burning, it's a nice simple OSS app that allows for bootable images. If that's also not working it might be Windows 7? That's easy enough to blame because it's beta
