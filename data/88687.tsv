2008-06-18T20:53:00.000Z	soundray	unavailable	you can recompile the virtualbox modules, too (I can't give you instructions, though)
2008-06-18T20:54:00.000Z	unavailable	soundray	cus with sun its as simple as synaptic > find and highlight virtualbox > menu "Packages" configure..   click next until you see something about "compile modules now?" and make sure its checked...
