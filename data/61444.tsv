2009-04-12T05:47:00.000Z	matamou		Hello, so How do I start vista installation dvd during boot, instead of Ubuntu (the system does that, even though I changed the bootorder!)?
2009-04-12T05:48:00.000Z	Kangarooo	matamou	in bios change primary what to start
2009-04-12T05:49:00.000Z	Kangarooo	matamou	connect cd drive to mother board
2009-04-12T05:52:00.000Z	Kangarooo	matamou	maybe disk is not bootable?
