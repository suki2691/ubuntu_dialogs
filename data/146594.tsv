2011-04-07T01:19:00.000Z	bobbert		when the new ubuntu comes out, should i put 64 bit on, or just stick with 32?
2011-04-07T01:20:00.000Z	BluesKaj	bobbert	you could also ask in #ubuntu+1
2011-04-07T01:23:00.000Z	BluesKaj	bobbert	for what it's worth , I'm running 64 bit 11.04 on my other linux machine without any problems now .
