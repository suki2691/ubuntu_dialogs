2009-06-27T08:06:00.000Z	tarsk		what language should i learn between perl and python? for sys admin stuff
2009-06-27T08:07:00.000Z	mcummings	tarsk	cshell, kornshell, and bash
2009-06-27T08:08:00.000Z	tarsk	mcummings	but i want to also learn a programming language for shell scripting not just bash
2009-06-27T08:08:00.000Z	mcummings	tarsk	i'm biased - perl for sheer manipulation
