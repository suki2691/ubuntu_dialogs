2009-04-06T05:10:00.000Z	lewench		I have installed fluxbox on ubuntu 8.10. But i cannot find the file startup in /home/user/.fluxbox/startup  its not there at all. Is there another place where this file might be/ Or do i have to create it?
2009-04-06T05:11:00.000Z	rww	lewench	I vaguely remember having to create it when I was running fluxbox
2009-04-06T05:11:00.000Z	rww		i haven't used it in a while, though
2009-04-06T05:11:00.000Z	lewench	rww	Thats what i thought. Im reading a guide, and its saying to edit this file, but the file is not there, i don't know if its located somewhere else in the system
