2005-07-15T07:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	xlsMessenger	it's used for upgrading a distribution, say from warty (ubutun 4.10) to hoary (ubuntu 5.04)
2005-07-15T07:07:00.000Z	xlsMessenger	HappyFool	i'm on hoary now, so i shouldn't run apt-get dist-upgrade at all, right?
2005-07-15T07:08:00.000Z	HappyFool	xlsMessenger	no
