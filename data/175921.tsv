2006-07-11T13:49:00.000Z	RShadow		when I instal snort I'm not getting a complete install (For example: Unable to open rules file: classification.config or /etc/snort/classification.config).  I have tried to remove (--purge) and to --reinstall but it just is not working..

2006-07-11T13:49:00.000Z	bbrazil	RShadow	*too
2006-07-11T13:50:00.000Z	RShadow	bbrazil	yes i have tried that as well.  The first time I installed it installed everything correctly.. but I had to start over and now I can get those default files to install
