2008-06-14T01:23:00.000Z	tofaffy		I just got Ubuntu installed on my laptop and when I attempt to play audio, it has a notable crackling sound in it. Also, I still get the crackling with headphone plugged in. Any ideas?
2008-06-14T01:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tofaffy	are you fully updated?
2008-06-14T01:24:00.000Z	tofaffy	ActionParsnip	yes. I had it in the last version of ubuntu as well, and thats actually one of the reasons I stopped using ubuntu for a while until I had more time to put into it :), but I'm back now.
