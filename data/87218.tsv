2008-09-08T10:21:00.000Z	amt2		hi, my ethernet connection is not working; the little lights in the port don't blink so i think it's not even being recognized. I'm in a Toshiba P305-S8842. Any help would be appreciated.

2008-09-08T10:23:00.000Z	amt2	tj83	but evyerhting works when i'm on windows, and the lights do blink there.... i don't think it's the hardware...
2008-09-08T10:25:00.000Z	tj83	amt2	i will try to help.. i only have a few moments /join #SeaPhor
