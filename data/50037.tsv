2010-02-09T10:47:00.000Z	minderaser	LavaEagle	apt-get update
2010-02-09T10:49:00.000Z	minderaser	LavaEagle	that will just update the list of packages. You may want apt-get upgrade to actually install the newest packages. Check man apt-get
2010-02-09T10:57:00.000Z	LavaEagle	minderaser	can I "man anycommand" ? and get the manual or will -h --help do the same thing?
