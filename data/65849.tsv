2009-03-01T05:10:00.000Z	Mox`		hmm when I try to save fdisk i get this error: "WARNING: Re-reading the partition table failed with error 16: Device or resource busy." - how do I fix this? :S

2009-03-01T05:10:00.000Z	Mox`	incubii	how do I check? Mount?
2009-03-01T05:11:00.000Z	incubii	Mox`	type mount in the cli, that will list all mounted devices and where they are mounted too
