2009-01-23T11:17:00.000Z	Sensor		Hi, Do I need the alternate install CD to install 'without' gnome/kde/ ?
2009-01-23T11:19:00.000Z	rdw200169	Sensor	why not just install ubuntu-server without any of the server options, w/the linux-generic package, it's exactly what your talking about
2009-01-23T11:20:00.000Z	Sensor	rdw200169	the server is the same install without the desktop?
2009-01-23T11:49:00.000Z	rdw200169	Sensor	afroken, only difference b/w server and desktop is, A) the lack of ubuntu-desktop on one and B) the addition of linux-server on the other
