2011-07-27T23:35:00.000Z	Polah	raluxgaza	What do you mean? Most desktop environments will have a terminal-type application that comes with them. Ubuntu has a command line by default that's accessible without a desktop environment. On a regular install, Ctrl+Alt+F1 through F6 will give you six command line interfaces you can use.

2011-07-27T23:37:00.000Z	Polah	raluxgaza	You don't need any window manager or desktop environment then. Like I said, using the other six TTYs will give you a plain cli
