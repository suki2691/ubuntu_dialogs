2011-02-11T14:23:00.000Z	ultrafluffy		ok
2011-02-11T14:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ultrafluffy	you can define dns in network manager
2011-02-11T14:24:00.000Z	ultrafluffy	ActionParsnip	It only seems to want to do it for each network individually -- I'd prefer if it were automatic for every new WLAN I connect to
