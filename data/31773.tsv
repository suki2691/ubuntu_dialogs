2012-10-01T16:07:00.000Z	killerspec		I am using WPA2 security with a seriously random password made up of capitals lower cases numbers and what ever else I have on my keyboard. Problem with setting up MAC address filters (I think that is what its called) is that I do have random folks that need to use my net when they are in my business. By the way the password is 12 charaters long at this point I must also add that I am changing it at least once a month if not more
