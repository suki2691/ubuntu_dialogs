2007-09-16T15:49:00.000Z	ParmoMike		what's a 'usual' partitioning setup? Is it possible my freezing is because I've done this wrong? I've read about someone setting up 2gb for swap - is this a swap file?
2007-09-16T15:50:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ParmoMike	whats yoru system specs(ram and processor speed)
2007-09-16T15:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ParmoMike	ok, how much of the 200 is free?
