2007-01-08T13:17:00.000Z	dakira		hi.. can anyone here help me with a regular expression?
2007-01-08T13:18:00.000Z	houman	dakira	i know perl regexp, what do you wanna do?
2007-01-08T13:19:00.000Z	dakira		perl is fine.. i want to match a string that contains at least six numbers and is allowed to contain the chars "-", "/", "*" and "#"
2007-01-08T13:21:00.000Z	dakira	houman	and laz0r: something like [0-9] [-/*#] .. but with the above restrictions.. and I'm sure I need to escape something here, right?
