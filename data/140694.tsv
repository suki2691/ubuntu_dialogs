2007-04-09T09:34:00.000Z	jedidor		I have been having a problem with 3d acceleration. The drivers are installed. glxgears works fine, beryl works fine. I have no errors except when I try to run a game in wine or cedega. Has anyone had this problem before?

2007-04-09T09:34:00.000Z	jedidor		wow, steam games
2007-04-09T09:35:00.000Z	jedidor	relia	Now, I had the exact same setup. Just reinstall ubuntu. It was working before the reinstall.
