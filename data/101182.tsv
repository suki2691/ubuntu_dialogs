2008-02-09T10:32:00.000Z	Genius16	alexkreuz	do you have the drives mounted somewhere with samba already?
2008-02-09T10:35:00.000Z	alexkreuz	Genius16	let me try that
2008-02-09T10:37:00.000Z	alexkreuz	Genius16	thanks if nothing else this should be fine, but is there a way to mount it so that it actually shows up as a real folder and doesn't show up as a deletable shortcut?
