2012-09-01T22:45:00.000Z	HellTiger		can i upgrade a server installation to a desktop system?
2012-09-01T22:46:00.000Z	rhizmoe	HellTiger	what do you mean, just to install a desktop environment or something?
2012-09-01T22:48:00.000Z	rhizmoe	HellTiger	i think it's just apt-get install <whatever>-desktop (xubuntu, gnome, etc.)
