2008-01-02T05:10:00.000Z	mtraven		My ubuntu got horribly broken after attempting to upgrade to Gutsy, it won't boot up properly, and apt-get won't work...what are my options other than reinstalling from scratch?

2008-01-02T05:19:00.000Z	FrostRat	mtraven	I'm going to read it now, but have you tried "sudo apt-get install -f" to try fixing it?
