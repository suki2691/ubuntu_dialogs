2008-06-21T09:05:00.000Z	chowder		question: I want to install the minimal CD image onto a separate partition but it needs an internet connection to download the needed files. It won't detect my wireless. Is there a way to debootstrap from the CD to the empty partition?

2008-06-21T09:07:00.000Z	chowder	KyleK	I have it but I'm not sure how to use it, that's the thing.
