2007-10-21T08:26:00.000Z	eyemean	djlenoir	exactly why i installed it, i love the wobble, lol
2007-10-21T08:27:00.000Z	djlenoir	eyemean	yeah, personally i think the effects are way better than the vista aero effects
2007-10-21T08:29:00.000Z	eyemean	djlenoir	i havent really used vista, but ur right vista dont look like much next to the effects here
