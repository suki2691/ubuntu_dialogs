2007-04-19T08:25:00.000Z	zbrown		In gnome, there's the CPU Frequency Scaling monitor, I know that in another distro I was able to tell the processors what speed I wanted them running out or what profile (ie: usermode, performance, powersave). In Ubuntu Feisty it shows me the speeds but its permanently set to "ondemand" mode. What should I install to enable functionality of controlling the profile of my processor's speedstep capabilities?
