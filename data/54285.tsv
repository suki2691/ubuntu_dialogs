2009-08-14T20:05:00.000Z	mazda01	GPL	i used dbconfig-common. there's an issue where the phpmyadmin symlink doesn't get created though I think and you'll have to create it in /var/www/.  just install phpmyadmin and then see if you can access it through web browser, if not then do sudo ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin /var/www/phpmyadmin
