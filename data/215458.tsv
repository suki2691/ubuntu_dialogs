2008-05-30T00:00:00.000Z	joshp		has anyone else had their autoupdate remove firefox for no reason?
2008-05-30T00:01:00.000Z	soundray	joshp	why don't you just reinstall it and be done with it?
2008-05-30T00:02:00.000Z	soundray	joshp	maybe you've removed a package that firefox depended on, so it was autoremoved. I still don't understand what the problem is. Just reinstall firefox!
