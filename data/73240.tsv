2008-11-25T21:20:00.000Z	GreenDeltaLaptop		ok, i have this problem: i'm trying to install my nvidia driver and i have 2.6.24-19-generic. the driver says he cant compile because he cant find the kernel source tree. when i look in /usr/src i cant find any folder with my kernel name in. but in synaptic all packages with my kernel name are installed. What can i do?
2008-11-25T21:22:00.000Z	cyr1	GreenDeltaLaptop	: are the linux-headers installed for your kernel?
2008-11-25T21:23:00.000Z	cyr1	GreenDeltaLaptop	: something like  linux-headers-2.6.24-19-generic
2008-11-25T21:36:00.000Z	GreenDeltaLaptop	cyr1	sorry, i was afk. How do see if the linux headers are installed?
