2007-10-29T21:51:00.000Z	sakis_ser		hi all! could anybody help me providing information about installation issues on a Flybook A33i?? THe Flybook A33i is a TabletPC with no internal CD drive. thus the only way to install Ubuntu should be by creating a bootable USB flash disk. Anyone tried it or knows how?
2007-10-29T21:52:00.000Z	sakis_ser		will check it out. thanx!
