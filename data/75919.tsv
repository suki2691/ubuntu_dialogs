2010-05-25T04:09:00.000Z	progre55		hi guys. I've got a core 2 duo, and my second CPU has been showing "0% usage" for a while now.. I'm kinda concerned.. any suggestions, please?
2010-05-25T04:09:00.000Z	ElTimo	progre55	why would you be concerned? that's great!
2010-05-25T04:10:00.000Z	ElTimo		have you been doing things with it?
2010-05-25T04:10:00.000Z	progre55	ElTimo	well, both of them used to show at least some load.. but now the second one is silent..
