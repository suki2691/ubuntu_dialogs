2012-09-23T00:12:00.000Z	rkokkelk		Hey guys! Has anyone suggestions on how to effectively force application to be always place 1 physical screen (I've got 2). I've tried using DISPLAY but that forces me to make a lot of small scripts

2012-09-23T00:13:00.000Z	rkokkelk	jrib	Tried that one, didn't really work for me but I think I have to take another look!
