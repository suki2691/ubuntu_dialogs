2010-10-28T08:26:00.000Z	AegNuddel		I accidentally put the wrong distro name as I pasted it from an older source
2010-10-28T08:27:00.000Z	AegNuddel		Will it matter?
2010-10-28T08:27:00.000Z	roknir	AegNuddel	did you actually apt-get update and apt-get upgrade before fixing it though?  if not, i doubt it matters.
