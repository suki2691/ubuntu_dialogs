2010-07-11T16:46:00.000Z	Archana	shauno	I actually deleted the default switcher. And now i added it again .. But right clicking on it, does not show "preferences" ??
2010-07-11T16:46:00.000Z	shauno	Archana	my mistake, apparently it's changed since I last looked.  "when Compiz is enabled, you change the number of desktops from within the advanced management console, under the General section"
