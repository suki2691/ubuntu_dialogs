2008-11-08T07:10:00.000Z	punto		hi.. is ubuntu experimental more or less unstable than debian experimental?
2008-11-08T07:10:00.000Z	tvon	punto	I'd guess it's more stable than debian experimental
2008-11-08T07:11:00.000Z	punto	tvon	so it's like debian unstable or testing?
2008-11-08T07:12:00.000Z	tvon	punto	you can try both I guess... I'd vote for ubuntu though, experimental is more likely to break due to package updates
