2008-05-21T17:59:00.000Z	joaopinto	kthakore	man valgrind, there are several output options
2008-05-21T18:00:00.000Z	kthakore	joaopinto	I know but why no redirect in terminal?
2008-05-21T18:00:00.000Z	joaopinto	kthakore	I don't how valgrind writes the output, if it writes to stdout/stderr, then yes, redirection will also work
