2008-04-20T22:45:00.000Z	ace12345	TeamColtra[NADC]	upgrade is a pretty essential command, checking the versions of your currently installed packages against the newest list downloaded through apt update. It then tries to upgrade as many as possible without breaking dependencies...
2008-04-20T22:47:00.000Z	TeamColtra[NADC]	ace12345	so its more of a speed upgrade?
2008-04-20T22:48:00.000Z	ace12345	TeamColtra[NADC]	oh, I see what you mean, the recent apt version release... well, it is a pretty powerful little tool, but I think the update was just a couple of minor changes, if I recall...
