2007-04-29T13:07:00.000Z	sehute	AmirB	change screen resolution, fontsize or firefox theme
2007-04-29T13:08:00.000Z	AmirB	sehute	I don't want to change resolution, I've tried changing the font and it's the same theme I had on windows, just here it's taking up more space. Anyother suggetions?
2007-04-29T13:15:00.000Z	sehute	AmirB	no, I think it is a resolution of font problem. There are smaller alternative themes as well. If you really want a literal answer you can run Firefox in VNC with a virtual resolution that is higher, then shrink the image on the clientside to say 70%...
