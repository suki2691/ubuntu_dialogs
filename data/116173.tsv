2010-12-19T15:01:00.000Z	zcat[1]	databits	 install rar/unrar, I think fileroller (built into gnome) will then use that as a back end so you just double-click and it opens like any other archive..
2010-12-19T15:02:00.000Z	zcat[1]	databits	 otherwise you can use rar and unrar from the terminal ...
2010-12-19T15:11:00.000Z	zcat[1]	databits	 the one for rar is called "rar" and the one to unrar is called "unrar" -- ;-)
