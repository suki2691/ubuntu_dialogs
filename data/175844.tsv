2010-05-13T05:23:00.000Z	ahzrukhal		im not doing it from livecd, i am installing from usb
2010-05-13T05:25:00.000Z	ahzrukhal		well, backtrack uses ubuntu as a base, so if ubuntu works on ntfs, backtrack will too, so, yes Ubuntu works on NTFS
2010-05-13T05:25:00.000Z	drizzt_	ahzrukhal	I doubt ubuntu can use NTFS as /
