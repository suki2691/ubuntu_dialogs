2010-03-24T16:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	KSid	all linux firewalls are iptables wrappers
2010-03-24T17:01:00.000Z	KSid	erUSUL	I thought so. For some reason, ufw 23.3 doesn't like kernel 2.6.32, guess I should upgrade it but doesn't make any sense why it stops all internal connections when iptables shouldn't be changed
