2007-10-26T20:46:00.000Z	[CroX]		I have just installed Gusty, alternate CD, and the first thing I did was to remove Compiz. And now I seem to be stranded without a window manager. I need to start a terminal, enter 'metacity', hit enter and leave that open to get a window manger.
2007-10-26T20:47:00.000Z	[CroX]		I have tried to put metacity as something to run per gdm session but it doesn't seem to help.
2007-10-26T20:47:00.000Z	MasterShrek	[CroX]	add metacity in system > preferences > sessions
2007-10-26T20:48:00.000Z	[CroX]	MasterShrek	Tried that but to no avail. :( Even tried upping the sequence of that session command to 99 but still nothing. I still have to manualy start it.
