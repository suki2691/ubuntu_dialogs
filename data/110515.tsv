2012-02-18T01:37:00.000Z	aBound	PhantomPhreak53	I suggest "Google" and typing: Setting up an email server
2012-02-18T01:38:00.000Z	aBound	PhantomPhreak53	Best to stick to certain books because I believe the same.
2012-02-18T01:41:00.000Z	aBound	PhantomPhreak53	You could try reading: The Book of Postfix: State-of-the-Art Message Transport
