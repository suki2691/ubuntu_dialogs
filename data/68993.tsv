2009-02-05T07:51:00.000Z	ndowens		i have a quick question, i want to run a server, but no internet, i know what is the fun in that, but is it possible to run web/ftp/file servers w/o internet. of course local only
2009-02-05T07:52:00.000Z	Titan8990	ndowens	what is the purpose of a server that doesn't have internet??
2009-02-05T07:53:00.000Z	ndowens	Titan8990	i knew somebody would say that, just to play around with it. never did much server stuff, so something to play with
