2007-10-22T20:44:00.000Z	Xaosratt		This is kind of embarrassing. I manged to fat-finger my password during the install (twice obviously), and on the initial login. Now i cant seem to do anything, it rejects what my password is supposed to be. Is there a quick fix for this without re-installing?

2007-10-22T20:46:00.000Z	hendrixski	Xaosratt	you didn't have any data saved on there did you?
