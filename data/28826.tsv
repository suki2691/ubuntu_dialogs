2010-07-17T11:32:00.000Z	double-rainbow		hi. when i go system > pref > appearence > themes and change it to dust sand, my gnome-terminal background colour goes funny. i try to change it in profile prefs > colors (in gnome-terminal) but whatever color i choose the background comes out wrong like its on some kind of filter?
2010-07-17T11:33:00.000Z	double-rainbow		i like gnome-terminal
2010-07-17T11:35:00.000Z	thune3	double-rainbow	you can change the background/transparency of gnome terminal in the Edit->Profile Preferences->Background Tab. Can something there solve your issue?
2010-07-17T11:38:00.000Z	double-rainbow	thune3	yep thats got it. the funny colours came from that because i'm not using the fancy desktop effects because they seem to not get along with flash
