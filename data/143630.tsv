2007-12-27T10:16:00.000Z	hacked_kernel		I have Gutsy installed on a laptop, I have a problem with my ipw2200 card, it reconnects automatically in very short time which makes the connection is unstable, i had the same issue in fiesty, any help?
2007-12-27T10:17:00.000Z	JoshJ	hacked_kernel	this seems to be a bug with your card, look at the search results here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/?value=ipw2200&action=fullsearch&context=180
2007-12-27T10:18:00.000Z	JoshJ		there may be something in there that can help you
