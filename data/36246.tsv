2010-03-04T17:35:00.000Z	umbra_		making a  livecd based on ubuntu karmik using "ubuntu customization kit", I've removed all but the 'en' language sets, removed the 'windows components', installed XAMPP and using the /etc/.rc2.d have configured the system to autostart xampp,  I keep getting a popup on boot up stating "gvfsd-metadata closed unexpectedly".  Any ideas or suggestions incredibly appreciated.
