2007-09-24T08:23:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		hi guys. I am running into a couple issues. the main issue is that when I try to logout of Xgl and restart the login screen in ubuntu feisty 7.04, it hangs. Ctrl+Alt+backspace does nothing. I type ctrl+alt+del and it can't seem to reboot
2007-09-24T08:23:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		is there a way for me to force the console to load up?
2007-09-24T08:23:00.000Z	h1st0	DoYouKnow	xgl support go to #ubuntu-effects
2007-09-24T08:24:00.000Z	h1st0	DoYouKnow	you could boot in recovery mode
