Or select which env parameters get passed with the sendenv and PATTERN functions in your ssh_config (must be supported by server). Or alias your ssh client to a shell file that spawns a new shell in different colours and passes on the input paramters.
2008-12-09T06:14:00.000Z	earthmeLon	pepparkaka	 A script that passes the colors to another terminal sounds like the easiest solution (although I'm not sure how to go about that).  I will look up some information.  Thanks for the suggestion :D
