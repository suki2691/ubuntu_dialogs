2006-05-27T09:41:00.000Z	LinuxBenny		I got a problem with my Linux perhaps maybe someone can help me with.
2006-05-27T09:42:00.000Z	LinuxBenny		will you see i got this problem i can't install anything. For one reason or not the one program i need is locked because i am not loged in as the Root. What i need is the password so i can get into the root and use the program i need.
2006-05-27T09:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxBenny	 what program?
2006-05-27T09:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	LinuxBenny	 'sudo whateverprogram'  is the normal way to run somthing as root.
