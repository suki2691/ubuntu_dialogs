2005-05-24T15:14:00.000Z	eyequeue	MasterYoda	 i'm connected with ipw2200 now, and only using stock kernels, so i presume so ;)
2005-05-24T15:15:00.000Z	MasterYoda	eyequeue	yeah, I greped it, it is there
2005-05-24T15:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	MasterYoda	 the only disadvantage i've seen with a separate /home (and i always use one btw, heh) ... if one os has a different version of a app, and it requires changes to per-user config files (~/.*rc)
2005-05-24T15:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	MasterYoda	 that bit me when i had nfs-mounted home dirs, but it would be true on local-mounted multi-boot machines too, i'm sure
