2008-03-16T19:58:00.000Z	minimec	ConstyXIV	aptitude is the newer software and should replace apt-get. I think aptitude is default in Debian now.
2008-03-16T19:59:00.000Z	minimec	ConstyXIV	Aptitude handels dependencies better than apt-get
2008-03-20T04:13:00.000Z	minimec	ConstyXIV	There is a special xchat-gnome version with a different layout. But ... irssi beats them all...
