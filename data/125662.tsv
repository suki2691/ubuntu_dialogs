2008-02-27T15:13:00.000Z	dgjones	jhend60	instead of rebooting, you could try just restarting gnome - press Ctrl-Alt-Backspace, that should restart it with the new settings for the driver, without a hard reboot
2008-02-27T15:14:00.000Z	dgjones	jhend60	do you mean restarting gnome doesn't work with the new driver, or that the keyboard shortcut doesn't work?
2008-02-27T15:17:00.000Z	dgjones	jhend60	right, without knowing the intel graphics, the only suggestion I can give would be to download the alternate install cd which uses a text based intaller and works with more hardware, other than that, you'll need to keep asking in the channel, sorry i can't suggest anything else
