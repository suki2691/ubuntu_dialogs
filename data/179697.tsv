2012-09-06T22:03:00.000Z	unperson	jrib	Good someone knows these things.  :-)  Sometimes it does seem like stuff that used to be really easy is now really complicated, though.
2012-09-06T22:04:00.000Z	unperson	jrib	Well, I must admit in this case that was pretty easy.
2012-09-06T22:06:00.000Z	jrib	unperson	yes, though the fact services can still be of the new upstart-type or the old sysv-type make it confusing
