2007-11-26T20:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	MystaMax	not real sure on that one...
2007-11-26T21:00:00.000Z	MystaMax	IndyGunFreak	Do you have any blank DVD+DLs to test with, to verify my results?
2007-11-26T21:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	MystaMax	no unfortuately I don't, but i could have sworn i used them before.
