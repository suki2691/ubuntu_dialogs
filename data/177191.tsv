2011-06-14T15:20:00.000Z	rahul_		after enabling Desktop cube from Compiz I dont know how but "close, minimize and close" buttons just vanished....anybody know how to fix it?
2011-06-14T15:21:00.000Z	dr_Willis	rahul_	 titel bar is gone also? compiz just crashed..  the cube and unity sort of fight with each other.
2011-06-14T15:23:00.000Z	dr_Willis	rahul_	 if compiz crashed do alt-f2  'compiz --replace'
2011-06-14T15:24:00.000Z	rahul_	dr_Willis	: alt+f2 not working :(
