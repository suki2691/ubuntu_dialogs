2009-11-17T00:45:00.000Z	craigbass1976		I can't get a lamp server up and running for some reason...  I'm getting Fatal error: Call to undefined function mysql_connect().  Is this more of a php question?
2009-11-17T00:47:00.000Z	ganjanaut	craigbass1976	there is seperate package for php-mysql, i believe
2009-11-17T00:47:00.000Z	ganjanaut	craigbass1976	you probably need to install that
2009-11-17T00:49:00.000Z	craigbass1976	ganjanaut	I've been doing that, but now that I'm only install that one thing, I see a Couldn't find package php-mysql message.  THAT would probably explain a lot.
