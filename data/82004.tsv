2009-09-28T09:32:00.000Z	zetheroo		I have internet on a Windows XP Pro machine and have set up an ad-hoc wireless network on that machine sharing the Internet connection ... My Nokia phone can connect to the network and browse the Internet, but my Ubuntu laptop will not connect to the network even though it sees it - Please help

2009-09-28T09:33:00.000Z	alokito		what's your ubuntu version, zetheroo ?
2009-09-28T09:34:00.000Z	zetheroo	alokito	connecting with the phone is not the issue - its connecting Ubuntu to an ad-hoc network from a Windows XP machine
