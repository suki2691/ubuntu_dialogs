2008-04-10T16:02:00.000Z	cpk1	odinriiko	edit /etc/network/interfaces
2008-04-10T16:03:00.000Z	cpk1	odinriiko	or do "sudo ifconfig wifi0 192.168.1.1 up" replacing wifi0 with the actual interface and the ip with what you want of course
2008-04-10T16:05:00.000Z	cpk1	odinriiko	no, but editing /etc/network/interfaces will, or if you were lazy you could copy what I gave you and put it in /etc/rc.local but then you would need to use the absolute path to ifconfig, the correct way would be to edit /etc/network/interfaces =P
