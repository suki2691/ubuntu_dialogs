2009-02-11T05:27:00.000Z	trippss		disabled all FF add-ons. ubuntu start page. 1 window. no tabs. FF process memory=VIRT=118m RES=38m SHR=19m. doesn't that seem high?
2009-02-11T05:29:00.000Z	bernz	trippss	do you have a lot of tabs open? i often got 150MB sessions of firefox process on xp (and memory is memory, so it's not crazy for linux version to have similar usage) -- i'm talking about 60+ tabs here
2009-02-11T05:30:00.000Z	trippss	bernz	no tabs. fresh start. ubuntu start page
2009-02-11T05:30:00.000Z	trippss	bernz	like I said before on here I had 700MB (!!!) usage by FF with 2 tabs open!!!
