2007-03-20T13:17:00.000Z	gdb	jexdawg	There is a package called mtools that give you a variety of DOS-like commands to use to work with floppy disks without mounting them, assuming they are FAT formatted (most are).
2007-03-20T13:18:00.000Z	gdb	jexdawg	You can use commands like mdir, mcopy, mdel, etc, all "DOS" commands prefaced with the letter m, hence the "mtools".
