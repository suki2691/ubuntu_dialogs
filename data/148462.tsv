A creditable analysis from a debian/ubuntu developer can be found at http://mjg59.livejournal.com/77440.html (Additional information: /msg ubotu worksforme)
2008-03-10T08:04:00.000Z	ubotwo	Darkmystere	The following are some examples of Ubuntu derived distributions that we cannot provide support for due to repository and software changes, please consult their websites for more information: gNewSense (support in #gnewsense), Linux Mint (support in #linuxmint), LinuxMCE (support in #linuxmce), Ubuntu Ultimate
