2010-01-06T20:47:00.000Z	dooglus_	mcspa	the kernel has a firewall built in, but no tool to configure it easily comes as standard and the firewall is all open by default
2010-01-06T20:48:00.000Z	dooglus_	mcspa	not until you install openssh-server
2010-01-06T20:49:00.000Z	dooglus_	mcspa	I think the idea is that it's safe to not have ssh installed than to have it installd and firewalled
