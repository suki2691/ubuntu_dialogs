2007-10-30T02:25:00.000Z	fanin		can someone help me with 7.10 ?, after starting firefox the computer restarts after a few minutes. i have no idea what to do :(
2007-10-30T02:25:00.000Z	soundray	fanin	this is most likely a hardware problem -- overheating or bad RAM
2007-10-30T02:26:00.000Z	soundray	fanin	if you suspect your RAM, run memtest86 from the boot menu
2007-10-30T03:48:00.000Z	soundray	fanin	if it's been error-free for an hour, that's a good result, but purists will run it for a week :)
