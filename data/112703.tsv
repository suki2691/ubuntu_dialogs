2011-11-11T16:03:00.000Z	simion314		hi, i  have a strange problem, i got a new wireless router i installed it(i am using it on LAN), it worked fine with the default settings, now the problem is that sometimes my mail application will not work, KMail or Thunderbird ,also a plasmoid that connects to gmail , restarting my kubuntu 11.10 has no effect restarting the router no effect, the only thing that works is to reboot in an other partition where i have a previos version of kubuntu 11.04 ,
2011-11-11T16:03:00.000Z	simion314		this is realy strange , i had no update that coincided with the new router
2011-11-11T16:05:00.000Z	phlak_user	simion314	did the new router come with any default firewall /content filter settings
2011-11-11T16:17:00.000Z	simion314	phlak_user	hi, yes it has a firewall, but why it would work some times and why work on my old kubuntyu(kmail is other version there), anyway i do not have many options in that firewall, i enabled  allowed all packets to get to the internet
