2008-06-23T23:47:00.000Z	dtrix		when i installed ubuntu .. i unhooked my other drives.. is there a  way to get grub to find them ?
2008-06-23T23:48:00.000Z	wols_	dtrix	since you unhooked them: no. and doing it was a very stupid idea. you want to install ubuntu with all hdds present as will be in the future
2008-06-23T23:51:00.000Z	wols_	dtrix	there is. grub-install
2008-06-23T23:51:00.000Z	dtrix	wols_	alright thanks . i figured there was a way .. just didnt know how about it
