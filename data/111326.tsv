2008-12-17T07:15:00.000Z	dano__		Hey all, I have an external monitor, and running hardy heron, whenever i look at my resolution it says I have cloned screens, and if i uncheck it it shows 2 screens, laptop, and unknown.  I have 2 work spaces setup, but for the life of me I can not figure out how to have workspace 2 be for the external monitor, and workspace one be the laptop.  after i make the change to not clone screens and apply it, then go back into the resolution setting
