2010-02-27T12:02:00.000Z	earlyy		will ubuntu run on a P3 833?
2010-02-27T12:03:00.000Z	mgmuscari	earlyy	it probably depends on how many packages you plan to use
2010-02-27T12:04:00.000Z	mgmuscari	earlyy	i think it's safe to say you won't be using compiz and you might want to use alsa or something instead of pulseaudio with that hardware
2010-02-27T12:04:00.000Z	mgmuscari	earlyy	that should be fine
