2004-12-09T16:24:00.000Z	Myke		btw, i don't know why... sudo didn't work for me... my user pass was not acceptable...
2004-12-09T16:24:00.000Z	Myke		so, i had to put a root password
2004-12-09T16:24:00.000Z	Myke		since, you can't put a root password without having root...
2004-12-09T16:24:00.000Z	GoneBoB	Myke	how did you set a root password if the user password didn't work
