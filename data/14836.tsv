2011-05-01T02:36:00.000Z	ohsix	asdf_msc	you'd probably fare better asking in #winehq or checkign out the appdb, that's pretty much just a wine issue
2011-05-01T02:36:00.000Z	asdf_msc	ohsix	i've tried both and it seems to be an opengl issue rather than wine
2011-05-01T02:37:00.000Z	ohsix	asdf_msc	it'd still be wine; they're the ones fitting the square peg in the round hole :]
