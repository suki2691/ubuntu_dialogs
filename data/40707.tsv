2010-08-12T22:06:00.000Z	Bytesunfish		If someone has some networking experience, I have a wireless card that is not being recognized. The card is a PCE-N13. I have installed the latest drivers and the device shows up under "lspci" What should be my next step. I'm running the latest Ubuntu Desktop x64. My /etc/network/interfaces only shows the loopback interface. Wired network is functional. I have run "apt-get update" and "apt-get upgrade" today.
