2011-07-27T20:47:00.000Z	frostschutz	kiliwatch	maybe you have a package that depends on one or the other?
2011-07-27T20:48:00.000Z	kiliwatch	frostschutz	probably totem-mozilla, good idea!!!!!
2011-07-27T20:49:00.000Z	kiliwatch	frostschutz	nope, it still wants to reinstall firefox when i try to remove chromium
