2007-10-21T04:07:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet		Is there a secret mv command I'm missing .. I did mv -v /media/lg-server/Movies/ /media/sm-server/ .. and it did well .. but I lost ssh connection mid way through .. then I tried the command again and get : uable to remove target; Is a directory .. what the hell? .. Is there a way to force a move of directory and its junk besides mv ?
