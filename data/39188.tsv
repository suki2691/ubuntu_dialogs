2011-01-10T22:29:00.000Z	phox_		yo! I have a AMD phenom x3 cpu, is it considered i686, x86-64 or "dual architecture? (sry if this is a very common question)
2011-01-10T22:31:00.000Z	bastidrazor	phox_	type in a terminal: cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep lm    ..if you get any results then it is 64bit.
2011-01-10T22:33:00.000Z	phox_	bastidrazor	i didnt get any "results". So it's a 32 bits system. So what type of cpu is it? (i686, x86-64 or "dual architecture)
2011-01-10T22:34:00.000Z	bastidrazor	phox_	no, its a 32bit processor.. i686
