2011-01-13T04:44:00.000Z	han_		Hi fellow ubuntu'ers (?) i just got into the game, and I love it! However I am looking for some suggestions: Can someone recommend me a better bittorrent client and a better music tool?
2011-01-13T04:44:00.000Z	han_		like itunes I guess
2011-01-13T04:44:00.000Z	kosmarnik	han_	rtorrent FTW
