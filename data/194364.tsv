2006-11-20T09:07:00.000Z	Cat2		firefox 2.0 seems to crash a lot with Edgy, or is it just me??
2006-11-20T09:08:00.000Z	Cat2		yes, i did read the forums and some others have had the problem too, especially with Adblock installed
2006-11-20T09:08:00.000Z	stalefries	Cat2	try adblock plus instead?
2006-11-20T09:09:00.000Z	stalefries	Cat2	could you try it without for a while, and see if that helps?
