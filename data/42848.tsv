2009-11-15T10:42:00.000Z	shannas		i installed ubuntu over the top of windows and when i reboot its giving me a corrupt win 32 system file message and will not start up anything. When i did the process again it acknowledges that ubuntu is installed
2009-11-15T10:43:00.000Z	shannas		i dont know. I just put the cd in and followed the instructions ext 4 i think. does that sound right?
