2008-07-29T21:46:00.000Z	[tv]		Im running xubuntu and recently had a wierd gui complication, anyways i have the xfce menu fixed and all but it doesnt seem to let me "dock" programs like IRC and my torrent manager, i have to keep them open or they quit. i know its a quick fix but ive been up for a few days and i just cant bring my head to it.
2008-07-29T21:47:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	[tv]	ask #xubuntu :)
2008-07-29T21:48:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	[tv]	ya i know about that... if you are here, most likely someone will help... but it would be late...as mostly people here are GNOME users
2008-07-29T21:49:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	[tv]	try #xfce too
