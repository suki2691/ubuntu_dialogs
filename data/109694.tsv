2007-12-13T00:34:00.000Z	nieltown		Hey, Folks.  So this morning I was trying to chmod a file and it started segfaulting.  Then the whole system started to inexplicably shit the bed.  I restarted and suddenly my network interface fails to initialize; I was able to re-activate it in order to surf the web, but I can't ssh into, ftp to it, and worst of all Apache is shot.  I can, however, ping the machine.  Anyone have any ideas?...
