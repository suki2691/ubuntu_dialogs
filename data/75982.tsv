2009-01-09T07:10:00.000Z	iLogic	nickrud	i'll check it, thanks!
2009-01-09T07:15:00.000Z	iLogic	nickrud	you think this wpasupplicant solution would work in a wep managed network?
2009-01-09T07:16:00.000Z	nickrud	iLogic	ah, not sure. Never used wep myself. googling   wep  /etc/network/interfaces may come up with some guides (I used wpa ... to remind me how I did it)
