2007-07-20T12:57:00.000Z	swmiller6	mjgoins	I have the sky2 driver and have not had any problems at all
2007-07-20T12:58:00.000Z	swmiller6		yes
2007-07-20T13:00:00.000Z	mjgoins	swmiller6	what kernel are you running? I'm running 2.6.17-10-generic and the sky2 driver fails if you try to scp a large file or do anything involving lots of bandwidth
