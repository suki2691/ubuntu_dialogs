2011-04-22T22:53:00.000Z	Geoffrey_		My ubuntu completely crashed today and I cannot boot into it at all. I have a LIVEUSB with the Ubunutu 11.04 on it and can acess the files on the harddrive. I am going to transfer them to a external harddrive and then do a fresh install of ubuntu. However, I cannot copy them as I am no the owner. Could anyone help?
