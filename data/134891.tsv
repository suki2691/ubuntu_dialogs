2009-12-25T18:22:00.000Z	jacob_		Sorry i know this isnt' the rigth place for the post...but does anyone know if there is a IRC for Wine?
2009-12-25T18:24:00.000Z	simplexio	jacob_	and why would you want run ric client in wine if there are many native irc apps for linux?
2009-12-25T18:24:00.000Z	simplexio		uh.. and names probably went wrong
2009-12-25T18:25:00.000Z	jacob_	simplexio	i recently deleted my windows partition..and the only thing i used it for was world of warcraft...so to my knowledge without paying wine is the best at running it
