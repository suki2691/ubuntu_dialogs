2007-02-22T16:44:00.000Z	Ayabara		I need a "party mode" for my Ubuntu laptop. I want my guests to be able to fiddle with my music player / playlists / music library, but I don't wan't them to have access to anything else. how can I do this?

2007-02-22T16:45:00.000Z	dromer	Ayabara	can't really help you fully with that
2007-02-22T16:46:00.000Z	Ayabara	dromer	I'll look into it :-)
