2012-11-18T23:45:00.000Z	John76		Hello I get an error when I try to mirror displays
2012-11-18T23:47:00.000Z	John76		Why can't I mirror displays at 1080?
2012-11-18T23:48:00.000Z	John76		highest resolution is  1280x1240 4:3
2012-11-18T23:48:00.000Z	escott	John76	perhaps one of the displays doesn't run at 1080
