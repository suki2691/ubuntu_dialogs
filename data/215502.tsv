2007-09-28T15:24:00.000Z	erick		I'm trying to install VirtualBox on Ubuntu 7.04 but I have a dependency problem with libqt3-mt. How can I fix this?
2007-09-28T15:26:00.000Z	soundray	erick	have you tried to just 'sudo apt-get install libqt3-mt'?
2007-09-28T15:26:00.000Z	erick	soundray	yes
2007-09-28T15:27:00.000Z	soundray	erick	paste the output of apt-get -f install on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
