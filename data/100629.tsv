2008-02-13T09:20:00.000Z	G_Benson		i have several parts of a rar archive (part1.rar, part2.rar, etc.) how do i extract the content so that it is joined back together? (ubuntu 7.10)

2008-02-13T09:26:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	G_Benson	archive manager will support automatically re-joining the .rar archives ... for example, if you click on the .rar one, then all the .r00-r99 and so forth will be included when the file is extracted. Check what you get when just dbl-clicking one one of the .rar files
