2007-06-26T14:07:00.000Z	RoC_MasterMind	CaptainMorgan	that's the best way.
2007-06-26T14:16:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	RoC_MasterMind	coNP I have my sessions saved automatically, so I don't see that helping..
2007-06-26T15:42:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	RoC_MasterMind	nah.. and I notice coNP isn't here.. but the GNOME session option didn't work (for DISPLAY=:0 metacity --replace, remember?)
