2011-11-02T16:22:00.000Z	rocket16		Hey guys, I have a problem regarding Kmplot on Ubuntu 11.10. It's not a technical problem, rather a mathematical one. I don't know if it's the place to ask, so please excuse me if I'm wrong to do so. Using the sqrt function there only plots for the positive values, and not the negative ones. :( Any help?
