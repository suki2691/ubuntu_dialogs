2011-06-22T01:00:00.000Z	flowbee		how big a swap size do i need if i want to be able to hibernate my t420 with ubuntu 11.04.  it has 4GB of RAM now; and i may add 2-4GB of ram in the future.
2011-06-22T01:02:00.000Z	flowbee		what do you folks think of simply using a swap file instead of a swap partition?
2011-06-22T01:03:00.000Z	awallin	flowbee	isn't swap for people who don't know how to buy RAM ? :)
2011-06-22T01:03:00.000Z	flowbee	awallin	i'm thinking swap files are better
