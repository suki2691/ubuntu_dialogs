2010-05-14T03:24:00.000Z	Fandekasp		On mac os x, to listen a specific music, I do from terminal "open bob.mp3", which will launch iTunes. What is the equivalent for ubuntu ?
2010-05-14T03:26:00.000Z	dancek	Fandekasp	there's no similar command to 'open' on any other os afaik
2010-05-14T03:27:00.000Z	Fandekasp	dancek	ethana3 : in fact I can replace open by rhytmbox, simply:)
