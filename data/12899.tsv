2011-11-29T22:06:00.000Z	MontyCarleau		Hey all - I have a box with three hard disks, but as I write to disk2, Ubuntu tells me that my disk is full, apparently summing the usage between disks 1 and 2 - even though I'm writing to disk2 and du shows me 500GB unused.  Any ideas?

2011-11-29T22:07:00.000Z	MontyCarleau	apwbdjp	/ is disk1, disks 2 and 3 are mounted manually and found in /media
2011-11-29T22:08:00.000Z	apwbdjp	MontyCarleau	is it full?
