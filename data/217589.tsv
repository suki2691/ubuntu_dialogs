2011-05-04T23:43:00.000Z	usr13	bobluvcheese	Did  you look to see if the driver is already there?
2011-05-04T23:44:00.000Z	usr13	bobluvcheese	Just do the printer configuration utility thing and see
2011-05-04T23:45:00.000Z	usr13	bobluvcheese	What version of Ubuntu are you on?   What is the make/model of your printer?
