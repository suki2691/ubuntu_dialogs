2009-01-16T08:55:00.000Z	LL		How do I know for sure that the recommended video drivers are activated? Using "Hardware Drivers" I'm unable to activate the recommended driver (or so it seems). Nvidia accelerated graphics driver (version 173) [Recommended]
2009-01-16T08:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	LL	why can you not activate it?
2009-01-16T09:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	LL	that would be my suggestion, most of the time when you activate a restricted driver, you have to restart
2009-01-16T09:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	LL	the device shows installed (thus why it shows up in lspci)..
