Right now, when I close one tab it goes back to the previous tab, but after that when I close a second tab it just goes to the closest tab not the one that was open second to last - does that make sense?

2009-08-17T08:14:00.000Z	ezzieyguywuf	IdleOne	at least it makes sense :-)
2009-08-17T08:15:00.000Z	IdleOne	ezzieyguywuf	made sense to me but I think weird and so do you it seems lol
