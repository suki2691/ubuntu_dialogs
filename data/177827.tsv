2008-07-16T06:27:00.000Z	showfire		today a "tech" from a local isp came out to "set-up" my computer to work with their internet, thinking my computer was running winxp he hit the windows key and something else and it zoomed in to the screen on zooming out a portion of my desktop no longer shows up.  I am running 8.04 does anyone have any idea what to do?
