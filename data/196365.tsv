2006-03-07T14:19:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	mandarin	the security updates are up to date
2006-03-07T14:19:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	mandarin	or, your system will keep up with them as long as they are enabled in your sources.list
2006-03-07T14:20:00.000Z	mandarin	johndarkhorse	apt-get upgrade will upgrade everything that is upgradable. but i _only_ want to do security upgrade as specified.
