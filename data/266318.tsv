2010-03-26T16:15:00.000Z	rysiek|pl		I have added a repository; upgraded a few packages; now I want to remove the repo (done) and downgrade back to normal distro versions
2010-03-26T16:15:00.000Z	rysiek|pl		is there a nice automagic way? or do I have to manually compare versions *shudders*
2010-03-26T16:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rysiek|pl	 i recall seeing some 'purge-ppa' script at some tutorial site.. but im not sure of any other nioce automated way
