2009-02-24T07:17:00.000Z	Mike94287		Can someone please help me? I just got rid of Windows on my computer and now I'm running Ubuntu only. I want to run Ubuntu on my other computer as well, however I want to be able to login to the same user account on each computer. How would I go about doing that?
