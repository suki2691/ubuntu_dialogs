2005-04-13T11:12:00.000Z	derelm		but how to i teach my system to playback mp3s?
2005-04-13T11:13:00.000Z	Nula	derelm	install beep-media-player , xmms is old stuff (gtk 1.x)
2005-04-13T11:13:00.000Z	derelm	Nula	rhythmbox is good enough for me ;) but yes, i would install bmp if i needed something like xmms ;)
