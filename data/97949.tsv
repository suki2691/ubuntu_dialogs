2008-03-09T08:44:00.000Z	Coded1		i was curious and got a copy of Hardy xubuntu for a widescreen laptop.  it booted well but the desktop fonts are huge, like "Applications" takes up the top 1/3 of the screen
2008-03-09T08:45:00.000Z	cornfused	Coded1	are you sure that's not your resolution
2008-03-09T08:46:00.000Z	cornfused	Coded1	I'm not sure about the shortcut, check in the screen resolution item of one of the menus
2008-03-09T08:47:00.000Z	cornfused	Coded1	is it panning?
