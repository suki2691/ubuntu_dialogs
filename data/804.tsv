2012-10-14T02:21:00.000Z	Tdaug		Why can't I install Ubuntu?  I burned the ISO to a disk, ran the disk on windows, it SUPOSSEDLY installed, but all I can get is the demo version.  And when I try to directly install the FULL version, it doesn't do anything but restart my computer.  And the DEMO won't even work unless I boot from CD.

2012-10-14T02:23:00.000Z	Tdaug	zykotick9	I got it directly from the website http://www.ubuntu.com/ read the faq and everything.
