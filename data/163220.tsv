2011-11-20T15:53:00.000Z	Zta		I've deleted (moved to ~/BACKUP/) my .gconf* .gnome* .compiz* .local .cache .fontconfig from my homedir.  My desktop is still broken.  What else is there to delete?  Mind you that newly added users have a perfectly nice and working desktop, so I hardly think a general configuration is broken.
2011-11-20T15:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	Zta	 .config perhaps
2011-11-20T15:54:00.000Z	dr_willis	Zta	 as a test. make a new user. see if they have the same issue.
2011-11-20T15:54:00.000Z	Zta	dr_willis	I did make that test.  You're right about .config though, how could I forget that ...
