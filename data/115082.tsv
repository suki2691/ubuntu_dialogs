2008-06-15T15:31:00.000Z	carlisle		Can anyone help me with a partitioning problem? I can't get my 140Gig partition formatted with FAT32. It fails in ubuntu and windows setup. Any solutions for that?
2008-06-15T15:31:00.000Z	icewaterman	carlisle	you do not want to install windows on fat32 and neither do you want to install linux on that

2008-06-15T15:36:00.000Z	icewaterman	carlisle	you are aware that fat32 is limited to 4GB files and cannot contain bigger files?
