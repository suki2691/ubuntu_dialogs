2010-05-20T18:02:00.000Z	randomDusty		Hey all! Quick question; Is it normal for drive /sd* names to change after reboots? And if so, how can I define a hdparm to spindown specific drives with a startup script with this changing all the time?

2010-05-20T18:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	randomDusty	yeah, damn
2010-05-20T18:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	randomDusty	usually they remain the same
