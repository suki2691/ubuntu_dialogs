2010-07-16T01:25:00.000Z	seanh_		Hey, anyone know about running Ubuntu on an IBM ThinkCentre A58? According to the certification thing on ubuntu.com this model is "Ready", but it doesn't say what ready means!
2010-07-16T01:26:00.000Z	Oer	seanh_	ready ? i asume they tested the model and find no problem installing Ubuntu.
2010-07-16T01:27:00.000Z	Oer	seanh_	try it yourself with live-cd
2010-07-16T01:27:00.000Z	seanh_	Oer	I don't have the machine yet, thinking about buying if (I'm sourcing a new desktop for a local charity)
