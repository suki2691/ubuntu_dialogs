2012-04-19T18:24:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy		so I am using Ubuntu 10.10 for my media server (with the gui desktop for ease of access) and it now appears the desktop has frozen (keyboard/mouse unresponsive, even when trying to plug other ones in) yet the server is still streaming media without any issues. Any recommendations as to what I should do ?  Should I just do a hard reboot ?
2012-04-19T18:25:00.000Z	bazhang	Dj_FlyBy	10.10 is end of life
2012-04-19T18:27:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy	bazhang	yes, yes I know it is EOL.... but I can't do an upgrade if the system is unresponsive
2012-04-19T18:28:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy	bazhang	the only way currently that the system is accessible is through my dlna client (still plays the media) but nothing else works or responds... even from the server itself
