2008-01-20T01:37:00.000Z	miketalanca		 I need some serious help regarding the GRUB bootloader. I cannot get it to reinstall no matter what I do.
2008-01-20T01:38:00.000Z	miketalanca		I have formatted 5 times and done every terminal command I could find.
2008-01-20T01:38:00.000Z	miketalanca		I cannot restore GRUB at all :/
2008-01-20T01:38:00.000Z	scguy318	miketalanca	is there anything in BIOS that is locking the MBR?
