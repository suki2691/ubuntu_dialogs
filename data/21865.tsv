2010-12-19T13:59:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	zeppelin101	yes but it's safe to do it from a live cd though
2010-12-19T14:00:00.000Z	zeppelin101	Us3r_Unfriendly	i run into a strange problem when I try to re-size an ext4 & an ntfs partition whether gparted is running off ubuntu or off a live cd..
2010-12-19T14:00:00.000Z	zeppelin101	Us3r_Unfriendly	also, do i need to unmount a FS before i can re-size it? ( i think yes..)
