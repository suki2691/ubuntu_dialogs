2007-05-02T06:48:00.000Z	Refoyl	jrib	yes, that's exactly the point.  it saves a lot of wear and tear on Ubuntu mirrors.
2007-05-02T06:50:00.000Z	jrib	Refoyl	k, is mounting /usr instead of /usr/local a dumb idea?  I don't know of a straightforward way to change where packages get installed to
2007-05-02T06:51:00.000Z	Refoyl	jrib	mounting /usr is most likely not going to work for us.  It's a thought, though.
