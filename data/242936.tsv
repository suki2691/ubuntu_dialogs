2005-08-09T12:44:00.000Z	sataere		Can anyone help me?  I'm very desperately in need...my wireless card (linksys) is based on the atheros chipset, and uses the madwifi drivers.  I've used these drivers under other distributions with no problem, and under Ubuntu they look as though they are working (the card lights up and goes through the proper series of flashes), but although it says it's connected and activated, I can't actually connect to the net!!!
2005-08-09T12:45:00.000Z	sataere		My AP even logs my MAC address as having connected but I still can't get online!!!!
2005-08-09T12:46:00.000Z	calamari	sataere	what can you ping?
2005-08-09T12:46:00.000Z	sataere	calamari	Nothing, not even my AP.  I can ping localhost, but who can't?
