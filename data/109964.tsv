2011-11-22T18:42:00.000Z	anon_ymous		I have an extremely basic question for someone that wants to field it:  I have a network share (smbfs) that is mapped, but I'm unable to create a directory in it.
2011-11-22T18:43:00.000Z	anon_ymous		I don't know why... any ideas?
2011-11-22T18:44:00.000Z	soreau	anon_ymous	Do you have write permissions?
