2009-11-09T15:43:00.000Z	tuxdna		Hi everyone! Is there any gnome-terminal hacker around here?
2009-11-09T15:45:00.000Z	tuxdna		Alright. I am reading the source code of gnome-terminal where in terminal-screen.h, I am not able to locate definition of terminal_screen_get_type(). This is used in #define for TERMINAL_TYPE_SCREEN macro. May someone help me finding it out?
2009-11-09T15:45:00.000Z	tuxdna		The code was checked out from git : * master     3696d5b quick fix on zh_CN.po
