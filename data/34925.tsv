2010-03-31T06:33:00.000Z	Aquina		wash you can build g++ yourself with "sudo apt-get install -b <package>". This may require you to install "apt-build".
2010-03-31T06:33:00.000Z	Aquina		Nevertheless I think your system is broken, wash. g++ and gcc install without problems on a newly installed ubuntu system.
