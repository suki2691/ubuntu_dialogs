2011-12-22T06:22:00.000Z	NeedHelp		Hello, I have a problem with Ubuntu that the numpad doesn't work. How do I fix it?
2011-12-22T06:22:00.000Z	xangua	NeedHelp	hit the function key to enable it
2011-12-22T06:23:00.000Z	NeedHelp	xangua	which button is that? I have a blue button called "F mode", but that doesnt affect it.
2011-12-22T06:24:00.000Z	NeedHelp	xangua	yes, it moves.
