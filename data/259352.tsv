2005-07-26T05:16:00.000Z	Guest_545		Hey, anyone here know of a way to format Windows 98 OTHER THAN using a Windows boot-disk?
2005-07-26T05:17:00.000Z	Guest_545		Is there a boot-disk I can download online, to format it?
2005-07-26T05:17:00.000Z	Guest_545		Because I can't find my Win 98 boot disk and I can't run the Win XP boot disk because the laptop only has 32 MB of RAM.
