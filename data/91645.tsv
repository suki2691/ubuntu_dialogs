2008-08-04T20:01:00.000Z	phoenix_		Hi folks, On my Ubuntu-Desktop I have a nice notification gizmo, that tells me when updates and security-updates are available, can anyone give me some pointers for servers? I want to know, if a server has updates and especially security updates pending.
2008-08-04T20:03:00.000Z	joaopinto	phoenix_	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2008-08-04T20:04:00.000Z	phoenix_	joaopinto	I know how to perform the task - but I want to be notified, I want to monitor it... I don't want to run that all morning on all my servers...
2008-08-04T20:05:00.000Z	joaopinto	phoenix_	you can create a script to send you the email based on the sudo apt-get upgrade output...
