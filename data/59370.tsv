2010-06-30T14:07:00.000Z	Bluh		I have a question, is it worth it to double boot with windows? How does it compare to wine?
2010-06-30T14:08:00.000Z	indus	Bluh	totally worth it
2010-06-30T14:08:00.000Z	indus	Bluh	but it depends on what you wish for, wine wont run all applications from windows that easy
2010-06-30T14:09:00.000Z	indus	Bluh	yes
