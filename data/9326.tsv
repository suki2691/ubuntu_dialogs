2011-09-26T08:08:00.000Z	giiker2	urlin2u	I did not mean to make a list, but just options, sorry, right now I'm trying apps from the Software center, but it takes time, I just need some app that some how can block other people from printing the pdfs at least!
2011-09-26T08:09:00.000Z	giiker2	urlin2u	I laready searched the net, and found dozens of them, that's why I came here
