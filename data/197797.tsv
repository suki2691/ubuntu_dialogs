2006-09-03T12:02:00.000Z	meff		hiya.. im having a big problem, i want to install ubuntu but the 6.06.1 amd64 installer cd is trying to force me to format my partition i want to install on.. but its a valid ext3 partition and i do not wish to copy back all my data, i moved everyting on that partition to a temp dir.. is there anyway to bypass this thing?

2006-09-03T12:04:00.000Z	meff	warpzone	i have swap and the rest is ext3.. this worked before on a 6.06 disk i lost.. now its forcing me to format or it wont install :/
2006-09-03T12:05:00.000Z	warpzone	meff	damn, in that case, no clue. If its any consolation my gf's last 6.06 install erased her Windows mft, had to format the whole damn thing :-P
