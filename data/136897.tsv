2007-05-17T05:21:00.000Z	hilts50		Installing ubuntu at work.  Our network is behind a proxy server.  I need to run an update before I can install, but can't run the update because i don't know my ip address to put into the proxy server to allow port 80 traffic.  Anyone know how to find out what my internal ip is from the command line?
