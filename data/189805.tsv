2006-04-24T12:26:00.000Z	Toba	g0dch1ld	no but if it's VGA it should be fine I would think
2006-04-24T12:28:00.000Z	g0dch1ld	Toba	- hmm...yeah, i can get it to show the boot process and shell- when it comes to X, i've yet to figure out how to write the xorg.conf to setup two screens...and I'll be dang'd if i can figure out the vertical refresh rate and the horiz sync-
2006-04-24T12:28:00.000Z	Toba	g0dch1ld	yeah, xorg and dual screens can be hard
