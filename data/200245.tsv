2008-03-05T10:22:00.000Z	iRRVi		im getting a error with openssi (suposedly 1.9 works with ubuntu) error here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/58455/  (the funny part is it says to run ssi-create first but that is the output of ssi-create)
2008-03-05T10:24:00.000Z	iRRVi		are you sure they're not 2 different interfaces on the same NIC? <--- to risngsun
2008-03-05T10:24:00.000Z	iRRVi		and possibly it didnt do the second one?
2008-03-05T10:24:00.000Z	BigDaddy	iRRVi	that was my next line!
