2005-09-14T06:57:00.000Z	falbalae_		I was wondering: what should I do when I crash my system? Is there something like ctrl-alt-del? Please don't tell me that linux doesn't hang...
2005-09-14T06:58:00.000Z	falbalae_		Should I write it in the console or what?
2005-09-14T06:58:00.000Z	bur[n] er	falbalae_	if it's just X that hangs... ctrl+alt+backspace... otherwise hold the power button for 5 seconds + :)
2005-09-14T06:58:00.000Z	bur[n] er	falbalae_	kill & killall will stop one process, but not a full on restart
