2010-03-22T19:14:00.000Z	EDinNY		Anyone know how to make the CHROME browser launch from Evolution?
2010-03-22T19:14:00.000Z	aurilliance	EDinNY	System>Preferences>Default Applications?
2010-03-22T19:19:00.000Z	EDinNY	aurilliance	what does "System>Preferences>Default" launch?  I am using Kubuntu and I dont think my menu is set up that way.  in settings>system settings>default applications, Google-Chrome is already the default.  I think that there is another set of associations for Gnome programs
2010-03-22T19:21:00.000Z	aurilliance	EDinNY	I'm on netbook remix and I guessed the menu path ;) but if chrome is already set as the default I'd say you're right, there must be another set of settings. Cant help you there sorry :(
