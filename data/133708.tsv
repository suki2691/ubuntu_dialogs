But now, instead of the connection-quality bars, a computer screen appears in the panel. But in this way, I can't see the quality of the wireless connection.
2007-10-20T16:14:00.000Z	Ind[y]		Is there a way I can see it?
2007-10-20T16:14:00.000Z	Ind[y]		I mean, the percentage of the connectivity (how good or bad is the wireless signal caught).
