2006-12-04T17:26:00.000Z	bam_		Hi I was wondering if anyone could tell me why I get a port change everytime I execute a command on my ftp server? After a command like "ls" I get a "150 Connecting to port 41169" or something...what is this?
2006-12-04T17:26:00.000Z	bam_		the command is executed, but what does that message mean?

You can however set a port range the server can use. It's something used often when behind nat so one can forward a set of ports to the server.
