2010-09-06T02:52:00.000Z	IanWizard		I've got a perculiar problem.  I can connect to wifi, but random apps work, and others dont.  Chrome will connect, but Firefox wont.  Pidgin will connect to freenode, but not to MSN, or GTalk.  What on earth could be causing this?  (No I haven't done anything with a proxy, or any other network tweaks.)

2010-09-06T02:55:00.000Z	IanWizard	jani_	oh, stupid me.  I was thinking it was an application (NM) screwing it up.  thanks for suggesting the obvious ;)
