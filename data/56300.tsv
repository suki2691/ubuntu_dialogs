2010-09-22T06:26:00.000Z	ikey	SnakDoc	You could always cheat and use something like chpasswd (therefore allowing a chained command)
2010-09-22T06:27:00.000Z	SnakDoc	Sargun_Screen	i have a list of names to creat accounts for i wrote a bash script to read in file of username and was just wanting to make them with a default password
2010-09-22T06:28:00.000Z	ikey	SnakDoc	definitely check out chpasswd then
