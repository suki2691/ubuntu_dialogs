2011-10-18T11:31:00.000Z	Operaist2		i was reading an article and people were referring to something as $HOME . what is that??
2011-10-18T11:33:00.000Z	Operaist2		why do people use $HOME then? was this some sort of archaic notion or just standard synonym??
2011-10-18T11:33:00.000Z	arghx	Operaist2	do echo $HOME  in a shell and you see why
2011-10-18T11:33:00.000Z	arghx	Operaist2	as a comparison do echo home instead
