2007-09-14T05:55:00.000Z	MBR666		i run xubuntu. i have kdm installed as the window manager. i want to use gdm. how do i change it over? i looked at a x11 config file and didn't see where to change it
2007-09-14T05:56:00.000Z	r_rehashed	MBR666	why are u using kdm on xubuntu? doesn't it defeat the purpose of using xfce?
2007-09-14T05:56:00.000Z	MBR666	r_rehashed	'cause i also have kde installed for whenever i want to use it
2007-09-14T05:57:00.000Z	MBR666	r_rehashed	anyway the point is i want to ditch kdm
