2009-09-10T03:57:00.000Z	gigglefight		help! my bootdisk ubuntu 9.04 for PPC Mac G4 shuts down my monitor
2009-09-10T03:57:00.000Z	gigglefight		I'm trying to upgrade my 6.06 ubuntu to 9.04 on my G4 Mac
2009-09-10T03:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	gigglefight	6.06 --> 8.04 (possible becouse both are LTS) then 8.04 --> 8.10 --> 9.04
2009-09-10T03:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	gigglefight	maybe a reinstall would be a better option
