2007-01-02T12:03:00.000Z	bazsl		I am new to Linux, have installed Ubuntu server and am trying to configure networking. What is the easiest most intuitive text editor to use to edit /etc/network/interfaces?
2007-01-02T12:03:00.000Z	mnoir	bazsl	you like gui or commandline

2007-01-02T12:05:00.000Z	mnoir	bazsl	i prefer vim
