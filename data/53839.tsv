2010-03-25T05:15:00.000Z	faron		Hello everybody.Hopefully all are well today...I am curious...my girlfriends brother [who lives in the house with us] is basically a comp geek.How easy is it to "infect" a linux system [Xubuntu} with a "keystroke logger" ? I'm not really worried about anything other than bank info
2010-03-25T05:16:00.000Z	faron		that's what I thought
2010-03-25T05:17:00.000Z	faron		I'm not really even worried about that.It's just that my girl made me [slightly] nervous ha ha
2010-03-25T05:17:00.000Z	iflema	faron	is this a shared system or your personal system?
