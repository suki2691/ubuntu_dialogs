Firefox 8.0: 'smb://192.168.178.33; Firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the protocol (smb) isn't associated with any program.' What DEB program package do I need to install yet?

2012-01-03T00:14:00.000Z	bullgard6	rhizmoe	Are you sure? I would have thought that I need only the package smb-client.
