2008-06-12T23:41:00.000Z	justme	ASULutzy	well 320 kbit mp3 and FLAC does not make much difference - right ?
2008-06-12T23:44:00.000Z	ASULutzy	justme	It's a bit offtopic, but the fact of the matter is that FLAC is lossless, mp3 is lossy. At that high of a bitrate you might not be able to hear a noticeable difference, but for archiving purposes lossless >> lossy
2008-06-12T23:45:00.000Z	ASULutzy	justme	I have almost my entire library in .mp3, but if I were a serious audiophile I would use FLAC for everything, because it's lossless.
