2011-04-28T05:28:00.000Z	KaAtta		i need a little help setting up conky. I understand how to create a .conkyrc config file. but i downloaded a setup that is in LUA format and it tells me to put it in ~/.conky (but i dont see a .conky file in my home file)

2011-04-28T05:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	KaAtta	.conkyrc is a file, not a folder
2011-04-28T05:32:00.000Z	KaAtta	ActionParsnip	i linked the URL i was going off of, could u take a look and see if u can understand what it wants form me?
