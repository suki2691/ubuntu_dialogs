2010-05-17T09:44:00.000Z	tony_	hmw	I'm updating /mozilla/ in Supertuxkart. I tried mv -u but that didn't really work.
2010-05-17T09:43:00.000Z	hmw	tony_	what are you trying to achieve?
2010-05-17T09:47:00.000Z	hmw	tony_	i see. I am not sure, how to do it properly, but moving the old directory out of the way (perhaps dirname.OLD) and then simply using cp -r should do the trick then.
2010-05-17T09:48:00.000Z	tony_	hmw	I'll give it a shot. Thanks very much, I'll report back later.
