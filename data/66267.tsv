2009-02-13T22:08:00.000Z	LogicFan	skinofstars12	sorry, pulse-audio? is that a different driver?
2009-02-13T22:09:00.000Z	skinofstars12	LogicFan	when i've had sound issues i've found restarting pulseaudio to be the trick
2009-02-13T22:10:00.000Z	skinofstars12	LogicFan	yeah, i'm jumping in half way too. pulse is a sound server and is often the issue when sound mesteriously stops working mid session
