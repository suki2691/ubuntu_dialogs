2008-02-24T00:59:00.000Z	scraga1		I've just built a new computer with a "Radeon Saphire HD 2400 PRO" graphics card and followed all steps on: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-546756.html but I still can't enable desktop effects, what am I missing?

2008-02-24T01:00:00.000Z	scraga1	bibby	say's that I don't need them
