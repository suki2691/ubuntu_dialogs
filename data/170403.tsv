2006-10-16T09:18:00.000Z	Homer	DigitalNinja	try XUbuntu
2006-10-16T09:18:00.000Z	Homer		and only use GTK applications
2006-10-16T09:19:00.000Z	DigitalNinja	Homer	I was thinking about that but it's a live CD. I don't think 44 megs of ram is enough but I could give it a try. I was thinking of using the alternet CD
