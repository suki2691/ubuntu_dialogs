2008-09-12T19:32:00.000Z	sipior	dfgas	isn't a raid card hardware by definition?
2008-09-12T19:33:00.000Z	dfgas	sipior	no, i heard that some cards can also be a software raid
2008-09-12T19:34:00.000Z	sipior	dfgas	oh, you mean whether the raid internals are accomplished via hardware. in that case, best to check the manual.
