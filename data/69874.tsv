2009-01-09T06:20:00.000Z	mcarter		on 7.10 I installed upstart which seems to have removed my old startup stuff (init); how do I reinstall init?
2009-01-09T06:22:00.000Z	mcarter		so the simple question is: what package gives me /sbin/init ?
2009-01-09T06:22:00.000Z	nsadmin	mcarter	sysvinit?
2009-01-09T06:23:00.000Z	mcarter	nsadmin	thanks
