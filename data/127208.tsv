2007-07-26T13:04:00.000Z	thetaleofcody		jordan_U: okay...so I should maybe try "gksudo killall gnome-panel"
2007-07-26T13:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	thetaleofcody	killall is not a gui application so it doesn't need gksudo ( though it can't hurt ) and it shouldn't need sudo unless gnome-panel is running as a user other than you ( which it shouldn't be )
2007-07-26T13:10:00.000Z	thetaleofcody	Jordan_U	well I tried the gksudu on it seemed as though things may have reset, but still the same outcome, my beryl is running and all but still no task bar
