2008-10-13T05:07:00.000Z	Schuenemann		or on linux in general
2008-10-13T05:08:00.000Z	BCM34	Schuenemann	from google it looks to be quite good. http://www.google.com/search?q=+ubuntu+GMA+X3100&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:unofficial&client=firefox-a
2008-10-13T05:09:00.000Z	Schuenemann	BCM34	yeah... I've read intel has a good history with linux drivers...
