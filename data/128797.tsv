2011-06-07T20:01:00.000Z	genepeer		Sorry for asking to ask, not sure if I was in the right place. Anyway, I had Ubuntu 8.04 on my computer and wanted to upgrade to 10.04 using the alternate-cd. But whenever I try, the update-manager hangs. I don't see how the CD could be corrupt since I downloaded using bittorrent and wrote the CD with minimal speed.
2011-06-07T20:02:00.000Z	genepeer		does this mean I have to upgrade through the internet? I just don't want to download it all again with this slow connection
2011-06-07T20:03:00.000Z	netyire	genepeer	the UpgradeNotes https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes only mentions upgrading to 10.04 from 8.04
