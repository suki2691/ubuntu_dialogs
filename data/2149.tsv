2012-07-10T08:51:00.000Z	andrewh192		hey, was wondering what room i would go to to get help with installing something via a command line
2012-07-10T08:52:00.000Z	andrewh192		i am not sure [flux] but I think you should be able to boot with the live disk and then just install from there..
2012-07-10T08:52:00.000Z	[flux]	andrewh192	And it will upgrade?
2012-07-10T08:53:00.000Z	andrewh192	[flux]	i am not sure to be honest, never really had to do that. But i think u might also be able to go to the update center and it should give you a list of ways to upgrade to 12.04 as well.. not that much experience with upgrading to a new version myself but that would seem like a good place to start
