2009-09-10T02:52:00.000Z	ionut_		you're welcome :)
2009-09-10T02:54:00.000Z	ionut_		personally I won't change to Karmic since I like pidgin more than empathy (I don't wnat to start a empathy vs pidgin discussion here), but I will upgrade my kernel and nvidia drivers from time to time
2009-09-10T02:55:00.000Z	danbhfive1	ionut_	pidgin will be supported in karmic
