2008-07-05T00:23:00.000Z	Fryguy--	yesitisjustme	there are several base setups available.  if by "frugal" you mean not much installed by default, check out the ubuntu server install, which doesn't install X by default
2008-07-07T09:45:00.000Z	Fryguy--	yesitisjustme	any apt command is going to install dependencies automatically
