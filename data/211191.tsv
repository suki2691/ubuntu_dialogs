2006-04-05T12:29:00.000Z	soon		I've used Gentoo for a while and enjoyed it, but ended up spending too much time tweaking my system instead of doing my research ... fedora and Suse was better that way, but I couldnt find my way around (e.g. couldnt do a simple kernel "make menuconfig") - where is Ubuntu in that continuum???

2006-04-05T12:33:00.000Z	dereks__	soon	if you didn't like debian, you prob won't like ubuntu for that
2006-04-05T12:36:00.000Z	dereks__	soon	yeah but you might just want to install kubuntu
