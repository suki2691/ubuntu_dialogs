2011-09-22T01:14:00.000Z	Polah	fliebel	Because it doesn't support GNOME3 yet.
2011-09-22T01:15:00.000Z	Polah	fliebel	Nope, based on GNOME2. GNOME3 will be supported with 11.10
2011-09-22T01:17:00.000Z	Polah	fliebel	Well GNOME will stop shipping with 11.10. 11.10 will only ship with Unity from then onwards, but GNOME3 will be available in the repositories. Unity is based on either GNOME2 or 3 actually, I only know it's based on GNOME.
