2007-06-25T14:00:00.000Z	Fhajad		I'm trying to get No-ip 2.1.4 on Version 5.10 of Ubuntu, but everything along the way of making the executable just results in errors. And yes, I did sudo.
2007-06-25T14:00:00.000Z	Keanu	Fhajad	- I'm trying to do the exact same thing.
2007-06-25T14:20:00.000Z	Fhajad	Keanu	You have any luck yet with No-IP?
