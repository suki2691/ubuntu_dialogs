2011-01-08T08:02:00.000Z	fogus		I am trying to run http://sourceforge.net/projects/portableubuntu/ .  When I run the .exe, it says "no valid configuration file."  There appears to be no documentation other than the readme: "Copy these files on your Portable Ubuntu directory. To use Portable Ubuntu with Xming run the pubuntu_Xming.exe file."  How can I get it to run?

2011-01-08T08:04:00.000Z	fogus	NixGeek	I fail to see how it is a windows problem.  it may not be an normal ubuntu problem, but that doesn't mean something is wrong with windows
2011-01-08T08:06:00.000Z	NixGeek	fogus	it may not be a windows problem, but this is the offical ubuntu support channel and portableubuntu is not supported in this channel.
