2006-06-05T16:49:00.000Z	jhunter		I tried to install the nVidia drivers from the reppository - they just caused my screen to go blank and I had to replace the xorg.conf with a backup
2006-06-05T16:50:00.000Z	jhunter		Perhaps I'm doing something wrong - installing the confis automatically uninstalls the glx and also vice versa
2006-06-05T06:26:00.000Z	jhunter		I'm still struggling to get nVidia drivers working. Everything installed ok, but the xserver just won't start. The log isn't very informative, just says that the kernal failed to load and check everything. Any suggestions?
