2012-08-19T22:45:00.000Z	hamdi1984		I upgraded ubuntu from 10.10 to 11.04 then 11.10 to 12.04 LTS finally, and it seems like mate is not working properly (especially with compiz) any solutions ?
2012-08-19T22:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hamdi1984	we cant support 'mate' here
2012-08-19T22:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hamdi1984	and it may be time for a clean install..
2012-08-19T22:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hamdi1984	install gnome-panel and select it at login
