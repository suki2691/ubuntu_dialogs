2008-03-24T21:20:00.000Z	plutarcus		i've installed itunes on my ubuntu with wine, but itunes doesn't "see" the ipod device, so i can't update its firmware..can i do something solving this problem?

2008-03-24T21:22:00.000Z	hwilde	plutarcus	the problem is you are running itunes through a windows emulator, then trying to access the hardware layer...
