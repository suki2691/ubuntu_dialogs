2008-12-19T00:44:00.000Z	\Kira		Im trying to download a game that only has downloads for linux generic or debian. I know its debian I should choose, but then it asks me for etch or lenny? Im not sure what to select If I run ubunut...
2008-12-19T00:46:00.000Z	Bodsda	\Kira	i believe etch is the stable debian release
2008-12-19T00:46:00.000Z	Bodsda	\Kira	i might be wrong, -- either should work though
2008-12-19T00:47:00.000Z	\Kira	Bodsda	Flannel: okay thanks. Ill try lenny, if it doesnt work ill just compile it from source.
