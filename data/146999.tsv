2009-06-14T19:50:00.000Z	mattrepl		is there a guide on how to upgrade gutsy now that the repository has been shutdown?
2009-06-14T19:52:00.000Z	mattrepl		yeah, I should have been more specific.  I can read those instructions fine, but since the gutsy repos have been shut off, "apt-get install update-manager-core" won't work
2009-06-14T19:53:00.000Z	Myrtti	mattrepl	in the instructions in the wiki should be a section about how to upgrade from gutsy
2009-06-14T19:56:00.000Z	mattrepl	Myrtti	the instructions do not give a way to do a network upgrade of gutsy now that the gutsy repos have been shut off
