2008-05-23T03:51:00.000Z	ubuntu_		Yes, I did that, sorry
2008-05-23T03:52:00.000Z	ubuntu_		When I type in fdisk -l, it doesn't list anything. While I was booting up, it was giving me some error messages about /dev/sda1
2008-05-23T03:52:00.000Z	eleventy-six	ubuntu_	It means you haven't specified a valid drive. fdisk -l /dev/whatever
