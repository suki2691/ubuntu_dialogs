2006-06-06T09:13:00.000Z	DBO	paradizelos1	well a very hacky way to do it is by editing resolv.conf and making it read only...  there is probably a better way though
2006-06-06T09:14:00.000Z	paradizelos1	DBO	doesn't work, file still gets overwritten when the client renews the lease
2006-06-06T09:14:00.000Z	DBO	paradizelos1	you made it read only?
