2008-04-19T21:40:00.000Z	SKuhn		hi, how can I test system-stability with ubuntu? for windows I always used prime95 (http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft.htm)
2008-04-19T21:41:00.000Z	Pelo	SKuhn	just google for linux benchmark I guess
2008-04-19T21:42:00.000Z	SKuhn	Pelo	I don't want to benchmark, I want to stress test and see if my big-calculater calculates correct
2008-04-19T21:42:00.000Z	Pelo	SKuhn	then search for that in conjunction with linux,  or try asking in ##linux they mgiht know
