2009-02-02T04:55:00.000Z	Eredor		hi, i have tried to install win7 on a new partition of my windows hdd, after not having much luck with it i fixed GRUB from the live CD and have been happy with my ubuntu thus far. now i tried to boot into my old vista(first partition of the windows hdd) from the GRUB manu but it doesn't work. can't find any useful tips on google for fixing the vista boot on GRUB.
2009-02-02T04:55:00.000Z	Eredor		can any of you help me?

2009-02-02T04:57:00.000Z	Eredor	Truefire	possibly, but the partition should still be there... any chance to fix it?
