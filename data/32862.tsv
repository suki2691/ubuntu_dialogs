2011-07-03T19:10:00.000Z	edbian	A-R-R	What do you mean by boilerplate ?
2011-07-03T19:11:00.000Z	A-R-R	edbian	I meant any specific template? like the project skeleton
2011-07-03T19:13:00.000Z	edbian	A-R-R	I've written a large app in pygtk.  I'm sure there are many conventions I didn't follow.  :P  You can see how I did it here: https://github.com/edbian/Mint-Berry-Crunch
