2010-02-02T05:52:00.000Z	SaEeD		how can i kill Xorg processes? when i try to kill gnome or xorg processes using "kill -9 PID" it goes to gdm and i have to press Ctrl+alt+F2 to go back to terminal
2010-02-02T05:53:00.000Z	SaEeD		is there anyway that i can kill all X processes and drop to shell ?
2010-02-02T05:55:00.000Z	meganerd	SaEeD	ctl+alt+F1
2010-02-02T05:55:00.000Z	meganerd	SaEeD	log in as usual "sudo service gdm stop"
