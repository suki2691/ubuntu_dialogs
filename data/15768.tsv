2011-04-17T17:54:00.000Z	|Marco|		I've just try'd to upgrade from hardy to kermic (not a good idea), the problem I'm facing is proc not mounting (device busy..) error, and suggestions about changeing sertain things in grub/menu.lst, none of the suggestions have worked so far, this is on a apple tv 1gen, it also won't boot the newer kernel that kermic upgraded to.
2011-04-17T17:55:00.000Z	|Marco|		I'd be happy just to get it up and running again eather by downgrading if it's possible, or fixing the proc error
