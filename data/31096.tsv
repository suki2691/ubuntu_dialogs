2011-05-15T09:21:00.000Z	k-rAd-	jmcantrell	you can try and right click on it once to see if it gives you a new window option.  there are also shortcut keys to bring up things like terminal. ctrl-alt-t.
2011-05-15T09:22:00.000Z	jmcantrell	k-rAd-	what if it's neither?
2011-05-15T09:22:00.000Z	k-rAd-	jmcantrell	then there is likely a way to do what you want to accomplish but it will require google.
