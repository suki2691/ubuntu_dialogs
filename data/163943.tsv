2008-05-24T13:00:00.000Z	syrius_		Question for anyone... I have 2.5 GB of free space on my Ubuntu system, which I'm on now.. I attempted to do a kernel compilation today for the 2.6.24 kernel, and it used up all 2.5gb completely, ran out of space, then crapped out
2008-05-24T13:00:00.000Z	syrius_		any suggestions for compiling without taking up so much space?
2008-05-24T13:02:00.000Z	Shadow420	syrius_	if you are going to do like that I would have at least 10GB to comit compiling a kernel
2008-05-24T13:06:00.000Z	Shadow420	syrius_	well considering all of the packages it has to compile plus others it would have to download to make it complete
