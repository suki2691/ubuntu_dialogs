2006-07-26T13:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb		what's classpath? and what's sudo -i?
2006-07-26T13:03:00.000Z	neutrinomass	sebsebseb	sudo -i will give you the equivalent of a root terminal
2006-07-26T13:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	neutrinomass	 let's say I got the root shell using this sudo -i.  then I got to some how replace the jar file with the one I want?
