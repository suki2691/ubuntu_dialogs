2006-12-15T09:04:00.000Z	missingxtension		i dont use mplayer unfortunately, have u tried listen? its comparable to windows media
2006-12-15T09:05:00.000Z	missingxtension		i c well thats the best shot i had, mplayer is good in windows but in linux it just sucks
2006-12-15T09:05:00.000Z	trappist	missingxtension	I use mplayer for everything except dvds - it really doesn't suck
