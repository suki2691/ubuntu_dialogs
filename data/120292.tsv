2010-03-28T09:54:00.000Z	kushalone		Hi guys, I have an AMD athlon 2000 MHz processor with 512 MB RAM and a cheap nVidia graphics card. I also have 60 GB HDD as master (with Ubuntu 10.04b) and a 40 GB IDE slave. I was wondering if it is possible to install Windows in the 40 GB HDD. any ideas if this is possible/advisable?
