2008-04-16T02:07:00.000Z	Xristofer		I have downloaded and burned the newest ubuntu iso for desktops/amd.  I have an amd turion 64 X2 with 1gb ram.  When booting with the live cd, it loads after choosing to start Ubuntu and everything goes blank.  Anyone know what my problem may be?

2008-04-16T02:09:00.000Z	_avarner	Xristofer	so that's what i would see... i don't remember it being there anymore tho when i installed hardy
2008-04-16T02:16:00.000Z	_avarner	Xristofer	you're in ubuntu in some capacity already right? if you want hardy why don't you just do a distro-upgrade?
