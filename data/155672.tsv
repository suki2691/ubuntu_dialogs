2006-12-06T13:39:00.000Z	Nigromante		Hello, how can I avoid a sudo user to modify /etc/sudoers ?
2006-12-06T13:41:00.000Z	Nigromante		Can anyone help me?
2006-12-06T13:42:00.000Z	whyameye	Nigromante	if the user has sudo privs it doesn't sound possible to do what you want to me...
2006-12-06T13:43:00.000Z	Nigromante	whyameye	but then some options in sudoers to restrict commands look useless...
