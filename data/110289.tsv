2008-01-07T20:33:00.000Z	cottima		Hello, I am buying a new pc with an nVidia 7200GS 128MB.  Is that enough?  With os virtualization or gaming?
2008-01-07T20:33:00.000Z	DRebellion	cottima	your graphics card has pretty much nothing to do with os virtualization
2008-01-07T20:35:00.000Z	cottima	DRebellion	did not think so, but I was not sure with Win.  I just want to be prepared for gaming, 3d, and 3d compiz.
