2008-11-04T17:22:00.000Z	ramon		hi everyone. on ibex, when desktop effects are on and i use yakuake, yakuake's text doesn't update properly. is there a way to fix this while keeping desktop effects on? if not, is there a good alternative to yakuake? i like the way yakuake just goes away when you press f12.
