2006-09-23T07:03:00.000Z	Winter-Soulstic1		So being a noob here and all... What is the difference between redhat, Suse and Ubuntu and Zen, etc Basically all the different linux versions...
2006-09-23T07:03:00.000Z	Flannel	Winter-Soulstic1	same linux versions, same kernel (well, except version differences), different software management systems.
2006-09-23T07:06:00.000Z	Flannel	Winter-Soulstic1	gui differences (although all select from a limited pool of desktops), mostly package management differences, rpm vs apt, etc
2006-09-23T07:09:00.000Z	Flannel	Winter-Soulstic1	apt is what we use (apt-get, and it's various frontends), rpm is a different package management, less centralized, usually contributed to 'dependency hell' that rpm users experience, there's probably a lot more info available from google, etc.
