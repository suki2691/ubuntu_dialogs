2011-03-12T22:35:00.000Z	sburwood		I've two questions.  Just bought a Q6600 based computer.  What advantage would I have in using a 64-bit version of Ubuntu?
2011-03-12T22:37:00.000Z	sburwood		Second question - I tested the CPU.  It's supposed to be a Quad 2.4.  CPU #2 is said to be 2.4.  The other cores are said to be at 1.6. Is that normal.
