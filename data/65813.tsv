2009-02-20T12:33:00.000Z	Chux		I've just been using VMware Workstation 6.5.1 on a Vista 32-bit host to modify a version of Ubuntu 8.10, using Remastersys to create my final copy. However, during this process I have inadvertently deleted some items I didn't want to delete. For instanced, when I type in "ls" it just gives me normal ls. Instead of the system default "ls --color=auto". Is there any way to recreate this system default/alias again?
