2010-05-02T12:37:00.000Z	geekphreak	robertzaccour	the one that works
2010-05-02T12:38:00.000Z	robertzaccour	geekphreak	i'm asking because i tend to have graphical problems running on a dell, but not on other makes
2010-05-02T12:39:00.000Z	geekphreak	robertzaccour	yes dell's do cause issues, , i prefer a custom built, but everyone has there own choice
