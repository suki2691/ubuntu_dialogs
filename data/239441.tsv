2005-09-23T16:46:00.000Z	serfurj		will ubuntu be less stable if i add a backports source to /etc/apt/source.list, then upgrade?
2005-09-23T09:46:00.000Z	serfurj		how would i go about upgrading only my kernel to breezy?

2005-09-23T09:47:00.000Z	serfurj	Hikaru79	ok, thought maybe there was a better way.. thanks
