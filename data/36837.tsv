2010-02-23T05:32:00.000Z	Cool_Nick		Is it possible to mount a filesystem ontop of another?  ie.  combine files in directory listed for reading, but writing gets done to only 1 filesystem?
2010-02-23T05:33:00.000Z	Typos_King	Cool_Nick	   the wha?
2010-02-23T05:35:00.000Z	Cool_Nick	Typos_King	 lets say I have 2 drives...can I mount them to the same point  so when I write...it only writes to teh one drive...but I can see the files from both?
2010-02-23T05:37:00.000Z	Typos_King	Cool_Nick	   don't think that's possible
