2010-02-24T18:56:00.000Z	HALFWITS		Hi folks - I'm new to linux (used UNIX thirty years ago and Windows ever since) and just installed Ubuntu Studio.
2010-02-24T18:57:00.000Z	HALFWITS		I set up a user and password, but it keeps asking me for administrator password - which I haven't been asked to set
2010-02-24T18:58:00.000Z	HALFWITS		I'll give that a try, thanks
2010-02-24T18:58:00.000Z	bugaloo	HALFWITS	it's probably the same user password
