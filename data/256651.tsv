2011-08-09T23:21:00.000Z	heatherr_		Can I ask a silly question?  I think this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1741887&page=2 is very similar to my issue, but where do i type in "gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub"?
2011-08-09T23:22:00.000Z	heatherr_		so, if i can't SEE the terminal, that won't help me, right?
2011-08-09T23:23:00.000Z	heatherr_		i get what looks like a command line, but the colors and lines are all weird
