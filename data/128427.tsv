2007-07-10T16:15:00.000Z	ryanne		In #security someone adviced me to boot into single user mode and set a new root pass, but how do I boot into single user mode with Ubuntu?
2007-07-10T16:16:00.000Z	astro76	ryanne	that's pointless and bad advice
2007-07-10T16:18:00.000Z	ryanne	astro76	how can I use sudo if I fogot my root pass?
2007-07-10T16:18:00.000Z	astro76	ryanne	sudo uses the users password (first user is automatically added to sudoers)
