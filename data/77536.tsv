2009-05-01T12:15:00.000Z	losher	Flynsarmy	qt4 is too new to be stable, and opera doesn't the kind of QA attention firefox gets...
2009-05-01T12:16:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	losher	so if i installed hte qt3 version it'd look right?
2009-05-01T12:16:00.000Z	losher	Flynsarmy	no idea, I don't use either, sorry...
