2005-01-11T14:42:00.000Z	yorhel		help! I just did a dist-upgrade to hoary, but it stopped updating and complains about kdelibs-data, which can't be unpacked :(
2005-01-11T14:43:00.000Z	yorhel		is there a way to skip that package, since I only need it for k3b, AFAIK
2005-01-11T14:43:00.000Z	cartman	yorhel	k3b depends on  kdelibs
2005-01-11T14:45:00.000Z	cartman	yorhel	dpkg --purge remove k3b
