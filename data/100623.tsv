2008-09-07T09:19:00.000Z	neoender		hello.. does anyone know how to remove a partially removed package?
2008-09-07T09:19:00.000Z	neoender		i've been trying synaptic, apt get and none of them can remove it
2008-09-07T09:20:00.000Z	wng-	neoender	try reinstalling then removing, i bet that'd work
2008-09-07T09:21:00.000Z	wng-	neoender	try using apt-get with the --reinstall option?
