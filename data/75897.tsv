2008-12-18T04:17:00.000Z	lilsyko		can ubuntu be made to run in a dual-boot enviroment with XP?
2008-12-18T04:18:00.000Z	lilsyko		i know it can but i have tried many times but it doesnt work
2008-12-18T04:18:00.000Z	zetharx	lilsyko	my understanding is that XP likes to be on the primary partition.  i have a dual boot system and have had no problems getting it to work
