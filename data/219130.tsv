2005-12-03T11:49:00.000Z	NewUbuntu		I'm having a small problem.  zlib.a isn't located in /usr/bin how do I get it there??
2005-12-03T11:50:00.000Z	afabian	NewUbuntu	zlib.a looks like a static version of the zlib library.  It .. wouldn't go in /usr/bin for any good reason.  man 7 hier
2005-12-03T11:59:00.000Z	afabian	NewUbuntu	there's a howto on compiling software.  The -lz in the makefile, I *believe* tells the linker to look for libz.a in the library include paths.  It can get messy, sometimes, finessing include paths for libraries and headers, and adapting for library naming differences and such.
2005-12-03T12:02:00.000Z	afabian	NewUbuntu	man ld will tell you how to mess with the include path.  (-I to the compiler, I think, gets passed on to the linker.)  Get the package with the library, look at the actual name of the library in /usr/lib, try adapting the -l accordingly.  There's something weird about zlib, I usually have to mess with that one a little when I compile stuff.  It's been a while.
