2008-12-14T22:07:00.000Z	HoNgOuRu		how do I set jre in firefox 3 ? I've downloaded the jre .bin file, and run it....but no luck
2008-12-14T22:09:00.000Z	HoNgOuRu		yes but that way didn't work
2008-12-14T22:09:00.000Z	HoNgOuRu		that's why I turned to manual install
2008-12-14T22:10:00.000Z	gnutron	HoNgOuRu	package name is sun-java6-jre hope this helps.
