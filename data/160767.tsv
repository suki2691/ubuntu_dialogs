2010-05-08T00:48:00.000Z	Plugh		It would be an idea to have a link to the md5/sha1sum files on the main download page that one gets to from the main page of the Ubuntu site
2010-05-08T00:49:00.000Z	Plugh	Jordan_U	ok. I don't have that. I'm on a high speed link so it doesn't take that long to get the full ISO image.
