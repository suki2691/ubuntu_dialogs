2007-09-02T16:15:00.000Z	lucashungaro		I have a Sound Blaster Live! 5.1 sound card and a Logitech X-530 5.1 speaker set... the sound is okay but I got an interference noise at the central speaker all the time. Does anyone know what's happening?
2007-09-02T16:16:00.000Z	lucashungaro		Where do I can find good Linux drivers for Sound Blaster sound cards?
