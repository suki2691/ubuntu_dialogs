2008-08-10T02:45:00.000Z	prince_jammys		what's the recommended file system type to use when sharing a partition between a dual-boot Windows and Linux? vfat, ntfs, or something else?
2008-08-10T02:45:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	prince_jammys	it depends. vfat, or ntfs with ntfs-3g, or ext2 with the ext drivers for win
2008-08-10T02:46:00.000Z	prince_jammys	infinitycircuit	i currectly have vfat. are there known complications to using ntfs? (i do have ntfs-3g) the partition has to be easily read-writable from either OS
