Does anyone know what this website was .. I thnk it was french but I can't remember...

2012-02-26T18:10:00.000Z	monsterripper	ikonia	... err it is 'cos it involves open source programs used by ubuntu !
2012-02-26T18:11:00.000Z	ikonia	monsterripper	no it's not, asking "how can I pay someone to write an open source application" is not an ubuntu support question
