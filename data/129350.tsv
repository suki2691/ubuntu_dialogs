2008-04-16T00:14:00.000Z	TomL_		I am trying to get gnome running after initial install of Ubuntu Server 7.10 on VMware 6.0.3.  All I get is the command prompt.  The install completed normally.  Then ran "$ apt-get install ubuntu-desktop" from the command line.  gnome still not running.  Suggections?
