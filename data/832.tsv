2012-10-15T11:31:00.000Z	smellysally		is software for pdf annotations available on ubuntu? I tried evince and okular so far. evince only can do text annotations. okular has at least a highlight function and basic drawing tools, but it can't save to pdf. any alternatives?
2012-10-15T11:32:00.000Z	somsip	smellysally	you need a pdf editor, or just something that annotates?
2012-10-15T11:33:00.000Z	smellysally	somsip	annotations mostly, text marking. simple drawing would be nice.
