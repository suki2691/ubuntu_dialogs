2007-12-22T03:27:00.000Z	varsendaggr		hey i am looking for a live workspace switcher   please point me in the right direction
2007-12-22T03:27:00.000Z	thor	varsendaggr	which window manager? kde, gnome, and xfce all have one included
2007-12-22T03:29:00.000Z	varsendaggr	thor	i am looking for two things a workspace swicher that has more detail than the default gnome   and then a window selector that has updated images of the windows in that have been minimizded
2007-12-22T03:31:00.000Z	thor	varsendaggr	I am familiar with the e switcher...I miss e. I use xfce now and the workspace switcher is just a little shy of e...but ahead of gnome and kde (in my opinion)
