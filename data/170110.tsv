2006-08-23T10:46:00.000Z	Ktron	yinepuhotep	I'm just trying to get Xorg to run on the livecd... I have a radeon x800gt though, so aticonfig should be useful
2006-08-23T10:47:00.000Z	yinepuhotep	Ktron	you have to install the ATI  proprietary drivers, rather than the Ubuntu ati drivers, if you want to use aticonfig, though.
