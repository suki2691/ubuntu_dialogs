2008-10-23T16:54:00.000Z	TheNo1Yeti		o I'm building a new web server and I'm trying to decide on which web server to go with.  Right now I'm torn between ngnix, apache, & lighttp.  Anyone have any experience/suggestions/etc on which is the best.  Especially in a low memory environment?   The server is running Ubuntu 8.04 also.

2008-10-23T16:55:00.000Z	TheNo1Yeti	kunwon1	Okay thanks.  I have always ran apache before so I am use to it.  Have used lighttp once but never long enough to get a real feel for it.   Thanks for the info
2008-10-23T16:56:00.000Z	kunwon1	TheNo1Yeti	no problem
