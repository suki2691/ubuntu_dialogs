2007-10-23T06:25:00.000Z	Mauriciobc		Guys, I can't see my windows box shares in nautilus. I have entered smbtree in terminal and returned my shared tree right! Anyone else having this problem?

2007-10-23T06:27:00.000Z	Mauriciobc	Nubbie	In Feisty this never happened! Now in Gutsy I can't connect
2007-10-23T06:27:00.000Z	Nubbie	Mauriciobc	nah it's always been an issue for me.
