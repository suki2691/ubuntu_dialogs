2009-11-15T06:49:00.000Z	turiot		I inserted my LiveCD, installed gparted and then deleted Ubuntu's partitions. I now have some unallocated space that i was going to use to increase my Personal Files partition with. I can't get into Windows 7 however, as the GRUB loader is still there. I'm currently using my LiveCD just to use my laptop; how do i remove the GRUB loader?

2009-11-15T06:53:00.000Z	turiot	MacGyverNL_	i wish to remove the GRUB loader and have the original loader come up, so that when i turn my laptop on it goes straight into Windows 7. I want to install Ubuntu inside of W7 with Wubi. Wallace, no. When i turn my laptop on, the GRUB loader comes up without any options and has an error. The only way i can do anything with my laptop is with the Ubuntu LiveCD
