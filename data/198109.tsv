2007-08-14T16:26:00.000Z	DrCurl		I have a strange problem that appeared after a edgy->feisty dist-upgrade. The computer will not boot the first time I turn it on, but it always boot the second time I try???
2007-08-14T16:28:00.000Z	astro76	DrCurl	could it be a difference in powering off/on versus reset button?
2007-08-14T16:29:00.000Z	DrCurl	astro76	there is only one button, I need to hold it to turn the computer off manually
