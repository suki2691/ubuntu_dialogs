2006-11-28T09:53:00.000Z	atroWork	LordOllie	what about kopete?
2006-11-28T09:55:00.000Z	atroWork	LordOllie	sorry, I had no problems with kopete but preferred gaim's features. Have you tried gaim to see if it has problems importing contacts?
2006-11-28T09:56:00.000Z	atroWork	LordOllie	I doubt it is. kopete "just worked" for me, but lacked key features like file transfers across all media
