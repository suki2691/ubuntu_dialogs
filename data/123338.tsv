2009-07-05T08:03:00.000Z	linuxguy2009		New question its much easier for me to write text based tutorials for the Ubuntu community but I dont want to get a website yet.Whats my best outlet for writing text based tutorials to help folks here with common questions and such? Is that called a blog or some other techno term or where do you guys think I should put them at on the web?
