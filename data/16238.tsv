2011-04-02T20:10:00.000Z	edbian	nonao	They are temporary files saved my text editors.  In the even the program crashes or you need a backup the ~file.txt is there for ya
2011-04-02T20:10:00.000Z	nonao	edbian	oo can I disable them?
2011-04-02T20:11:00.000Z	edbian	nonao	Yes.  In every text editor you can turn them off but you have to config it in each text editor separately
