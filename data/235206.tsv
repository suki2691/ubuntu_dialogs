2005-11-07T13:09:00.000Z	siimo		2D performance in breezy sucks compared to hoary? why is this? did gnome become bloated? when i minimize all windows it takes a second for icons to appear on desktop again  - if i install nvidia driver its a little faster but still VERY slow compared to hoary, whats wrong here? i mean in hoary nv driver was 10 times faster than anything in breezy
2005-11-07T13:10:00.000Z	siimo		anyone experience this?
2005-11-07T13:11:00.000Z	linukso	siimo	I have the same problem...
