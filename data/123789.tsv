2007-08-25T13:29:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		if I'm trying to block ads, etc in my web browser, the addresses go in /etc/hosts?
2007-08-25T13:29:00.000Z	rexy_	Geoffrey2	that will work yes
2007-08-25T13:35:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	rexy_	with the only hitch being that I get Unable to Connect messages where the ads used to be....minor annoyance I guess...at least my browser isn't locking up now
2007-08-25T13:37:00.000Z	rexy_	Geoffrey2	well you can use the adblock plugin for firefox
