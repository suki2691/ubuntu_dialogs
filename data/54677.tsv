2009-06-10T19:09:00.000Z	larsaaAA		Hi, anyone know if I can edit the /boot/config-2.6.24-24-generic directly, or do I have to edit grub config?
2009-06-10T19:10:00.000Z	sipior	larsaaAA	that config file is the one used to *build* the kernel. changing it will have no effect.
2009-06-10T19:10:00.000Z	sipior	larsaaAA	edit the grub config directly, in other words :-)
2009-06-10T19:11:00.000Z	larsaaAA	sipior	ok, thanks!
