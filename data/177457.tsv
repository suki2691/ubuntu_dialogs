2006-07-24T09:57:00.000Z	skavenge	frogzoo	like i said i've never messed with it just overheard people talking about using it
2006-07-24T09:57:00.000Z	frogzoo	skavenge	last I heard, ie is broken for recent wine releases
2006-07-24T09:58:00.000Z	skavenge	frogzoo	i dunno if they were using it out of the repos or off winehq.com
