2012-07-15T17:39:00.000Z	mankoff_		Ack. Help. I'm going crazy. I need CUDA on a Linux laptop. I bought hardware just for this. This page http://www.nvidia.com/content/cuda/cuda-downloads.html suggests Ubuntu 11.04 is supported... But when I install that, I cannot get online, wired or wireless. So that is no good. 12.04 goes online, but no luck with NVidia drivers...
