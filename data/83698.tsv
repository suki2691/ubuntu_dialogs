2009-01-25T08:28:00.000Z	matisse		Hello, what could be the reason, that my partitions aren't listed as /dev/hd** ?
2009-01-25T08:28:00.000Z	lstarnes	matisse	try /dev/sd*
2009-01-25T08:29:00.000Z	lstarnes	matisse	for the last few kernel versions, hard disks have been using /dev/sd*
2009-01-25T08:30:00.000Z	lstarnes	matisse	I think so
