2008-08-18T04:30:00.000Z	shibz		Hi, I am looking for a decent firewall for my server. Can someone give me a recommendation?
2008-08-18T04:30:00.000Z	shibz		I was looking at either smoothwall, shorewall, or ipcop
2008-08-18T04:31:00.000Z	shibz		yeah, I was looking for something a bit higher level than iptables
2008-08-18T04:31:00.000Z	Guest23172	shibz	what do you want to do? Why do you want a firewall
