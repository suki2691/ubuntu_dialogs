2012-04-24T02:50:00.000Z	jey		is there some place I can download the vmlinuz file for a stock Ubuntu kernel? i.e. the uncompressed kernel binary that has all the symbols still in it
2012-04-24T02:50:00.000Z	jey		i mean vmlinux, not vmlinuz
2012-04-24T02:51:00.000Z	bkc_	jey	why would you want that? :P
2012-04-24T02:51:00.000Z	jey	bkc_	so I can profile my kernel using oprofile
