2008-02-07T04:25:00.000Z	gyaresu	Slart	Hey. Nice. Just installed and ran as root. seems to give me info about read/write/io etc. but not which process is associated with it... Might be some more options I can look into. Thanks.
2008-02-07T04:26:00.000Z	Slart	gyaresu	you're welcome.. I don't know of any other tool that gives info on hard drive activity.. hope you find what you're looking for
