2010-05-03T18:44:00.000Z	Timrit		## Can someone answer a question please? i have 9.10 installed and am trying to add a PPA to my system. The instructions state I am supposed to just type 'sudo apt-add-repository ppa:.........' but there is no option for add-repository for apt. any thoughts?
2010-05-03T18:44:00.000Z	Pici	Timrit	The command is 'add-apt-repository' not 'apt-add-repository'
2010-05-03T18:47:00.000Z	Pici	Timrit	Like I said, that is not the proper command.  The command is add-apt-repository , note the order of the words there.
2010-05-03T18:48:00.000Z	Timrit	Pici	then the page I was looking at had it wrong. I will have to go back and do that when I get home. Thanks.
