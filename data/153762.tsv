2007-04-15T14:26:00.000Z	MrMakeveli		the default bit torrent client**
2007-04-15T14:27:00.000Z	vox754	MrMakeveli	use other torrent client
2007-04-15T14:29:00.000Z	vox754	MrMakeveli	I recommend Azureus. Install first "sudo aptitude install sun-java5-jre" then get Azureus from the SourceForge project page. I haven't used the default client, maybe it doesn't have many options. Also read the ma page if that helps.
