2009-09-28T04:01:00.000Z	blz	saturnin1	 and what makes you think that it's due to a font issue? i'm not following you... did you overwrite any files?
2009-09-28T04:02:00.000Z	blz	saturnin1	 it would makes sense, but yeah. hook us up with more details.  Also, start thunderbird and firefox from the command line and pastebin any errors
