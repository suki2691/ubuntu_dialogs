2012-04-18T02:22:00.000Z	joseph_		Hi, How do I get ubuntu to automatically connect to my wifi without asking for the key ring password?
2012-04-18T02:24:00.000Z	joseph_		when I boot ubuntu, my account automatically logs in but the wifi will not connect until I type the password for "key ring"
2012-04-18T02:26:00.000Z	joseph_		hmmm, so I guess everybody in here that uses wifi has to type that pass word in?
