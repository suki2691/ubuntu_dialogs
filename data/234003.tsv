2005-07-15T13:22:00.000Z	Mestapheles		does ubuntu support server upgrades?  I just upgraded from hoarty to hoary with a minimal install with X and I have a wack of deps being held back
2005-07-15T13:22:00.000Z	Mestapheles		I've upgraded many times before on debian
2005-07-15T13:24:00.000Z	nickrud_	Mestapheles	I've run nothing but debian unstalbe since May 19, 2001, until I switched to ubuntu. I have found that I do like stable systems.
