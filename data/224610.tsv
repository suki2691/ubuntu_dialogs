2006-05-13T09:38:00.000Z	desrt		a friend and i have both noticed that when performing large disk IO operations under dapper the performance of other applications that access the disk is absolutely awful.  it literally takes 15 seconds to :wq in a vim session, for example, while doing my backups
2006-05-13T09:39:00.000Z	desrt		this is a regression in dapper vs. breezy, for example
2006-05-13T09:39:00.000Z	desrt		does anyone know why this happened or how to fix it?
