2007-10-05T16:50:00.000Z	NessieLiberation	lavender_dream	a couple of problems, but i never really used opera with feisty - have only switched on gutsy
2007-10-05T16:51:00.000Z	lavender_dream	NessieLiberation	Okay, I think it's a known bug, will have to try it out again when Gutsy final is released this month. Thanks for the response.
