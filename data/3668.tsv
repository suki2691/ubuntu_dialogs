2012-04-27T21:05:00.000Z	Irendal		hmm, another question............ has grub changed style between 11.10 and 12.04?
2012-04-27T21:06:00.000Z	Irendal		so about grub... is it normal if it looks like the grub from 10 years ago?
2012-04-27T21:06:00.000Z	OerHeks	Irendal	grub2 still looks the same to me.
2012-04-27T21:07:00.000Z	Irendal	OerHeks	ok, i guess it's just a cosmetic change.
