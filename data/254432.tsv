2005-04-30T11:39:00.000Z	Markrian	flipy	no need to mount it - file-roller can open .iso images
2005-05-01T05:28:00.000Z	Markrian	flipy	yes: System->Preferences->Sound and then uncheck "Start sound server at startup"
2005-05-01T05:29:00.000Z	Markrian	flipy	but esd is useful unless you've got either ALSA set up nicely, or have an SB Live or Audigy
