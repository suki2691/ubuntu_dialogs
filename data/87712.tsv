2009-08-31T15:52:00.000Z	muelli		I mean it's not that trivial. Do you only check file contents? Or including filenames? Or with attributes? Probably with extended attributes?
2009-08-31T15:53:00.000Z	homy	muelli	I have a folder that I would like to burn on dvd as backup. And it would make sense to have a checksum of the folder. To simplify things, and allow easiest access, I don't want to tar everything.
2009-08-31T15:54:00.000Z	muelli	homy	hm. I'm not aware of any program taking checksums of folders. But I know that brasero, for example, does take checksums and verifies it's burned CD.
