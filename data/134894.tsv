2009-01-19T16:46:00.000Z	Peleus		Linux newbie - I'm playing with c compiling and to run my programs I need to put "./" at the start of each execution. This is apparently because it is not part of the "PATH" at the moment, can someone please tell me how I can add it to the "PATH" variable so I don't need to type ./ all the time? Thank you
