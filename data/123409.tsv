2008-09-07T19:41:00.000Z	djwonk		looking for a rule-of-thumb explanation of when I need a regular package, and when I need a "-dev" package.  Or when I need both.  For example, libxml2  / libxml2-dev
2008-09-07T19:42:00.000Z	djwonk		-dev provides the library files when one is compiling?  is that all there is to it?
2008-09-07T19:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	djwonk	dev package if you plan to develop or compile against the library
