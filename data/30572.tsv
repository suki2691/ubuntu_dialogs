2011-08-19T02:20:00.000Z	DBordello		How do I use the command line to connect to a wireless network?  iwconfig wlan0 essid MyEssid seems to set the essid, but iwconfig doesn't show it as connected.
2011-08-19T02:22:00.000Z	Obsidian1723	DBordello	Tried sudo ifconfig wlan0 up ?
2011-08-19T02:22:00.000Z	DBordello	Obsidian1723	yes.  Could network manager be conflicting?  (btw, when I use it, it works great)
2011-08-19T02:23:00.000Z	Obsidian1723	DBordello	possibly, yes.
