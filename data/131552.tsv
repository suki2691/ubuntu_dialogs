2008-04-12T16:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Pirate_Hunter	don't know about conky, but some apps have moved user config files to ~/.config
2008-04-12T16:08:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	thoreauputic	#/.config was the first place i looked and its not there either
2008-04-12T16:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Pirate_Hunter	running out of ideas then :) Have you run conky yet? A lot of apps only place the dot files on first run...
