2005-07-08T05:47:00.000Z	wulfepup	Miks	 I have a blitzz pci card in my desktop at home, but haven't tried any Linux there yet.... the Ad-Hoc is getting painfull .. and running the laptop in Linux is bad enough on that.. I'll be getting a AP soon though... and after that I can let you know....
2005-07-08T05:50:00.000Z	wulfepup	Miks	 can't help you there ... I'm fairly new myself.
