2010-03-14T02:22:00.000Z	mistere357		Just curious - I'm accessing an Ubuntu server via ssh (no gui).  cron was not installed.  The boss did apt-get install cron and now wants me to tell him why nothing runs.  What am I missing?

2010-03-14T02:24:00.000Z	jrib	mistere357	you should figure out why cron wasn't installed, it may be indicative of a larger problem
2010-03-14T02:24:00.000Z	mistere357	jrib	I'll look into it
