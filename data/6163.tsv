2012-01-27T20:10:00.000Z	cargo23		Possibly the wrong room for this question.  Running vanilla 11.10, when I ALT-TAB, sometimes the window can come to the front, and sometimes, the taskbar (name?) pops out and shows the app wiggling around.  I have to click on the wiggling icon to get the window to the front.  If I ALT-TAB to an app, I always want that app to make it to the front. How do I fix that?

2012-01-27T20:12:00.000Z	cargo23	veagles	 I've done nothing to cause or prevent running compiz.... I don't know what it is.
2012-01-27T20:17:00.000Z	cargo23	veagles	 Should I be running compiz?
