2006-05-05T15:49:00.000Z	ayabara	ompaul	I am still in xp. formatting the drive is one of the steps towards my ubuntu life. I thought I'd use partition magic for the formatting.
2006-05-05T15:50:00.000Z	ompaul	ayabara	let the install disk do the formatting
2006-05-05T15:54:00.000Z	ayabara	ompaul	let the install disk do the formatting even if I'm not installing on that drive?
