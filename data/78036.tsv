I need your help...I want to use unison to synchronize to folders, both on NTFS disk, the one is on an internal HDD and the other on on my USB disk that I plug in...The problem is the usb disk mounts with only permission for me and the hdd folder has permissions for everyone....How do I change the permissions that the usb disk mounts with?

2008-10-04T22:25:00.000Z	Guinnesss	outbackwifi	that would work, but NTFS doesnt remember the permissions does it? Will I have to do that everytime manually?
