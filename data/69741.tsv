I have just tried holding Shift all through the boot process, and a change DOES occur: I get the message "GRUB loading...". However, this disappears after 5 or so seconds and continues with it's configured boot process (i.e. it does not show the GRUB menu)
2012-06-11T16:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	SwashBuckla	 one thing you could do is legthen the timeout by boot live usb/cd and change params in /boot directory
2012-06-11T16:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	SwashBuckla	or change the default boot to be ubuntu
2012-06-11T16:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	SwashBuckla	I think Chuck_Norris is correct it's at /etc/default/grub
