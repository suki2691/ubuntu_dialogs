2008-11-09T09:08:00.000Z	DanaG		good question.  What benefit does 64-bit give, anyway?
2008-11-09T09:08:00.000Z	DanaG		I'll be using 4 gigs.
2008-11-09T09:09:00.000Z	DanaG		What _are_ those benefits?
2008-11-09T09:09:00.000Z	rww	DanaG	if you're just doing normal desktop work, not much. I use 64-bit because I do distributed computing and have an SSSE3-optimized client for it =/
