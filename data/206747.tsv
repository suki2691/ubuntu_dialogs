2006-11-19T06:18:00.000Z	sethk	startswithz	you have a root account, but root login is disabled
2006-11-19T06:18:00.000Z	sethk	startswithz	the system cannot run without a root account
2006-11-19T06:18:00.000Z	sethk	startswithz	you can set the root password, but some people (other than myself) think that sudo is safer
