2009-12-02T04:51:00.000Z	Promit		i'm kinda confused about what differentiates the add/remove programs dialog and the synaptic package manager
2009-12-02T04:51:00.000Z	Promit		they seem to have entirely different sets of entries
2009-12-02T04:52:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Promit	programs use libraries of code, each in its own package.  Synaptic shows everything, while add/remove just shows the main programs
2009-12-02T04:53:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Promit	someone does
