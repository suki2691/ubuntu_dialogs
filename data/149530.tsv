2007-08-22T07:02:00.000Z	Pici	VitrinuS	this should work: sudo find / -name "*ndiswrapper*" -delete     I really really really dont reccomend doing it though, you idealy should be purging out those config files using apt.

2007-08-22T07:03:00.000Z	Pici	VitrinuS	sudo apt-get remove --purge ndiswrapper ; sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper
