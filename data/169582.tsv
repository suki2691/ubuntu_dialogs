2006-11-11T07:27:00.000Z	Genrl_Zod		Like Linux and windows or is that never ever gonna happen
2006-11-11T07:28:00.000Z	tom47	Genrl_Zod	using vmware you can achieve that right now
2006-11-11T09:37:00.000Z	tom47	Genrl_Zod	however if you have xp installed already then i would suggest that you run linux in vmware server/player inside windows until such time as you want to dispense with windows ... why?  its hugely more timeconsuming to reinstall windows than ubuntu
