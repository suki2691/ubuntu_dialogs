2006-03-13T09:54:00.000Z	drakonan		i wonder what's more efficient -running vmware with windows host, linux guest or linux host, windows guest
2006-03-13T09:54:00.000Z	drakonan		or using some other kind of vm program
2006-03-13T09:55:00.000Z	frank23	drakonan	linux is supposed to be more intelligent managing memory so I'd say linux host
2006-03-13T09:56:00.000Z	frank23	drakonan	apt-get shouldn't get messed up dependencies as long as you only use ubuntu sources
