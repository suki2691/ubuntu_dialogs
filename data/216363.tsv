2005-09-30T12:10:00.000Z	zachman123		I'm having trouble installing ubuntu(5.04 and 5.10, shipit cd's AND home-burnt) on my system.  When the install tries to load files from the cd, it's able to read some files, but then stops on a random one and says "Error reading cdrom media" or something similar.
