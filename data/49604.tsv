2009-08-28T07:19:00.000Z	CyL	detonation	no issue, it´s just that i don´t need it... my bios wont let me choose various oses, but would allow me to correctly choose the device which I want to boot... if i have only one os per device, no problem in using the mbr to boot the first poartition on each one

2009-08-28T07:21:00.000Z	CyL	detonation	the "broken linux installation" will be on a sd card... it is much easir just to get the sd card out of the reader, um recover it from a running installation
