2007-08-17T05:30:00.000Z	ZeuGiRDoR	THX-1138	because with the latest version of the nvidia drivers downloaded from nvidia.com works fine, and also with nv driver
2007-08-17T05:31:00.000Z	THX-1138	ZeuGiRDoR	 Ah, - okay.
2007-08-17T05:31:00.000Z	ZeuGiRDoR	THX-1138	the problem is with the nvidia-glx packaged officially in the ubuntu repos
