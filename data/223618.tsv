2006-07-08T16:38:00.000Z	RShadow		hmm... can sombody explain whats wrong with my command /usr/sbin/shutdown -r -t 120 now .. this preforms a shutdown almost immediatly, however shouldn't it wait 120 seconds? (2min) before it does a shutdown
2006-07-08T16:40:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	RShadow	shutdown -r +120    perhaps?
2006-07-08T16:45:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	RShadow	oh.. you wanted 2 minutes, not two hours :)
2006-07-08T05:16:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	RShadow	istanbul ?
