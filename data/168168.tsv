2006-10-05T12:42:00.000Z	atk		Hi. I'm a beginner with autotools and instructions say run aclocal but I can't find aclocal anywhere in the repositories. What's the catch?
2006-10-05T12:43:00.000Z	ardchoille	atk	type: which aclocal
2006-10-05T12:44:00.000Z	atk	ardchoille	returns nothing
2006-10-05T12:48:00.000Z	ardchoille	atk	Are you compiling aps?
