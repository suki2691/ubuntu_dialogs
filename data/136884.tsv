2007-04-25T08:03:00.000Z	Scootin159		does anyone know where I can find a quick 'tutorial' about how ctrl+alt+f_ is supposed to work?
2007-04-25T08:03:00.000Z	RobbieCrash	Scootin159	Ctrl+Alt+F* gets you to a terminal session, and F7 is your main deal. They're all normal terminals.
2007-04-25T08:05:00.000Z	Scootin159	RobbieCrash	- is there a limit to how many I can run x on?
2007-04-25T08:05:00.000Z	RobbieCrash	Scootin159	not that I'm aware of. It'll just slow your computer down.
