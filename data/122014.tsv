2007-10-04T08:39:00.000Z	kevinO		how do i make my windows partition (sda1) mount in my home folder instead of my desktop? It use to mount on the desktop automatically, then someone told me to change fstab from /dev/sda1 to mnt/sda1, and then they gave me a command to symlink it to my desktop. I need to know how to undo that symlink and redo it for my home folder.
