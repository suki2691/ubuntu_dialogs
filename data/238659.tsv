Yesterday I changed to 2x512 RAM and could not boot up.  Tried 1 256 and 1 512 and no go.  tried 1 512 and no problems.  How can I add Ram without reinstalling or is it possible?

2005-12-23T12:57:00.000Z	Quequeg	Killer_Smurf	I'm not sure I'm going to be much help, but for the record, what is the CPU/chipset/MB/memory type/speed?
