2008-11-15T17:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	leafw	 i had a issue where the fstab file had an extra/wrong entry for a cdrom drive  - it wouldent auto mount /dev/sda1 thumb drives automatically because of that.. check the fstab may be a good starting point

2008-11-15T17:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	leafw	 it did this - i think because i installed from a thumbdrive/unetbootin installed drive
