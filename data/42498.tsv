2010-11-16T17:42:00.000Z	L-----D	aeon-ltd	my current one is better than that, I mainly coding in Java, compile neeeeed time
2010-11-16T17:42:00.000Z	L-----D	aeon-ltd	and could be better if gnome running faster
2010-11-16T17:44:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	L-----D	depends if you like gnome, just make some upgrades or compromise on a few things e.g. compiz. but i would try out a few other WMs and DEs to see if you'd like a lighter one better, if you wanna compile and work at the same time i reccommend using 2 machines :)
