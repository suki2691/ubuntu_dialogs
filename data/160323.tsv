2012-04-30T00:51:00.000Z	AbeFM		I think so? It's very unlike the grub 1 and 2 I've used in the past
2012-04-30T00:51:00.000Z	AbeFM		I already HAVE dual boot, on anotehr drive,but now I come into windows and I get a "windows boot loader" option. This was the "install ubuntu from within windows" thing I just thought I'd try
