2010-05-07T08:12:00.000Z	Radio-l		why would two different Windows 7 loaders appear when I run update-grub?
2010-05-07T08:12:00.000Z	Radio-l		they are found on /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2
2010-05-07T08:12:00.000Z	hololight	Radio-l	win7 has some sort of chain loader for itself now
2010-05-07T08:14:00.000Z	hololight	Radio-l	I had a HP with win7 and it was the same
