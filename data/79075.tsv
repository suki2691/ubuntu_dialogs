2008-09-17T14:00:00.000Z	mankal		Hi guys. I'm looking for an app and don't really know what to google for. I need something like a mindmap but not that hierarchical. With mindmap creators you have a fixed structure like parent-child. I only need something where I can have nodes with some text and edges between that nodes. Any recommendations?
