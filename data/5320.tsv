2012-04-28T04:05:00.000Z	benjamindaines		I didn't load grub into the MBR when installing, so when I boot it just goes to the purple ubuntu screen... how am I going to be able to get into recovery mode if I ever need to?
2012-04-28T04:05:00.000Z	L3top	benjamindaines	hold shift during boot
2012-04-28T04:05:00.000Z	L3top	benjamindaines	hold space during boot... sorry
2012-04-28T04:06:00.000Z	benjamindaines	L3top	will that bring up grub, or go to recovery?  I may need to roll back my kernel as well at some point
