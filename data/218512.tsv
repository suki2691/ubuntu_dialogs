2008-01-13T23:12:00.000Z	steve___		why would i create a separate partition for /boot and not just have it apart of /
2008-01-13T23:13:00.000Z	astro76	steve___	not much reason
2008-01-13T23:14:00.000Z	astro76	steve___	the main reason used to be a limitation with lilo and older BIOSs where the /boot needed to be below cylinder 1024 on the hard disk
2008-01-13T23:14:00.000Z	steve___	astro76	i understand.  Thanks
