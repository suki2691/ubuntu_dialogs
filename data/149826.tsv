I just switched from windows 2003  where my processors ran about 5% peak but my memory usage was 1.5 gig normally.  here is a screenshot of my Ubuntu 8.04 currently online http://www.kwtfstudio.com/1/Screenshot-System%20Monitor.png  the website is www.kwtfstudio.com    any way to get the processor usage down ?
