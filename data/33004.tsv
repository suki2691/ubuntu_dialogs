2010-06-09T17:18:00.000Z	lapion	serengeti	have you recently cleaned the system, removing all dust from all cooling systems
2010-06-09T17:18:00.000Z	lapion	serengeti	 and of course do a cold start with memtest allowing it to run for 2 runs or something
2010-06-09T17:20:00.000Z	lapion	serengeti	remove all plugs from the system as well and make sure all parts ( including the processor) are well seated, and apply a slight amount of pressure to reassure they are all well seated
2010-06-09T17:20:00.000Z	serengeti	lapion	the system is clean because I've just put it together :) but I'll try the memory test
