2008-01-22T05:41:00.000Z	[Triona]		Hey. Good evening. Having an issue with X shutting down almost as soon as it starts. Theres nothing in the log for the xserver to indicate why its shutting down.
2008-01-22T05:42:00.000Z	[Triona]		it gets as far as displaying the gdm login screen, and then the X server dies
2008-01-22T05:43:00.000Z	neeto	[Triona]	can you pastebin your /var/log/Xorg.0.log?
