2009-07-26T06:00:00.000Z	drgbr		when i launch trayer, it keeps displaying its borders

2009-07-26T06:03:00.000Z	drgbr	jdu	xmonad is able to do that.. but trayer is an application to be used to display tray icons.. i put it where i wanted it on the screen and used the options for it to be handled as a dock, but the borders are still there :(.. but thx anyway
