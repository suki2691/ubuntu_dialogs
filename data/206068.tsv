2005-12-03T16:25:00.000Z	ubuntu_noob		i've got a question about getting libdvdcss installed, to be more exact, something with compiling is going wrong.  anyone know much about installing libdvdcss?
2005-12-03T16:25:00.000Z	kvidell	ubuntu_noob	uh.. apt-get install libdvdcss2 usually works for me.
2005-12-03T16:26:00.000Z	kvidell		there areason you can't do that?
2005-12-03T16:26:00.000Z	ubuntu_noob	kvidell	mm.  i think i tried that, but i'll try again.  though, i should know how to compile stuff, someday too, if i'm ever to get the hang of linux.
