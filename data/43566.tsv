2010-07-18T14:36:00.000Z	magnetron	boodroscotch	set the wifi to "Manual" for IPv4 and add your IP, your netmask and then the Modem IP as "gateway"
2010-07-18T14:36:00.000Z	magnetron	boodroscotch	also set the correct DNS
2010-07-18T14:37:00.000Z	magnetron	boodroscotch	you can get all these numbers from network manager by right clicking NM and checking Connection Info
