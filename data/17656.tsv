2011-03-06T05:32:00.000Z	[segfault]	edbian	talking to myself again, lol.  true, but won't that show up on a netstat -- successful connections vs unsuccessful?  I'm no expert, just trying to think of ways to test.  like you mentioned, if it is app to app communication, it will continue successfully without lan connection.  malware might see failed/timeouts.
