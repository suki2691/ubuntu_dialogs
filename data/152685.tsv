2009-07-18T02:55:00.000Z	epicreviews		Because of recent events, for my own personal sanity, I'd like to get a linux Anti-Virus. What would you recommend for Ubuntu? ClamAV?
2009-07-18T02:56:00.000Z	epicreviews		I have 64 bit
2009-07-18T02:57:00.000Z	epicreviews		is there a graphical frontend for clamav?
2009-07-18T02:57:00.000Z	arand	epicreviews	depends on what you aim to use the AV for, I'd say that if you want proper real-time scanning I'd guess you'd have to go proprietary...
