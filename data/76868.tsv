2008-10-20T08:19:00.000Z	B1BLancer1		Hi folks.  I'm very new to Ubuntu.  I hope you don't mind a clueless idiot type question.  Ubuntu has asked me a couple of times to enter my default keyring password.  I have no idea what it would be.  Help?
2008-10-20T08:20:00.000Z	izinucs	B1BLancer1	not sure but have you tried your normal password?
2008-10-20T08:42:00.000Z	izinucs	B1BLancer1	did you happen to change your primary password prior to this keyrinig problem?
2008-10-20T08:44:00.000Z	B1BLancer1	izinucs	: I don't think so.  I wouldn't know how to do that.
