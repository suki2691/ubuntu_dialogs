2011-09-22T22:14:00.000Z	sammy	kilrae	though I will admit I didnt know unpartitioned was an option
2011-09-22T22:16:00.000Z	sammy	kilrae	I also would suggest looking into separating certain directories into their own partition, like /usr or /var or /home. its good practice in case something goes horribly wrong
2011-09-22T22:16:00.000Z	kilrae	sammy	neither did i, just saw it today, i can't seem to find any information on it
