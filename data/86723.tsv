2010-04-20T05:16:00.000Z	Wingless		hello
2010-04-20T05:17:00.000Z	Wingless		I have a simple question: I've just installed Adobe Reader, but I don't know how to run it from the terminal.  How do I find out how to do this?
2010-04-20T05:18:00.000Z	Wingless		I want to run Adobe Reader with root privileges, so I want to either figure out how to gksudo it from the terminal (which requires its name or alias or whatever, which I don't know), or figure out how to do the equivalent of gksudo from within the Gnome GUI.
