2011-04-26T16:14:00.000Z	JuJuBee		I have a server currently connected to my lan and isp.  It is my gateway, dhcp server, firewall, etc...  I need to connect to another network.  Added card and when I set the card to dhcp, it gets same IP as my internal NIC.
2011-04-26T16:14:00.000Z	JuJuBee		Can someone help me configure it?
2011-04-26T16:15:00.000Z	JuJuBee		How do you know that?
