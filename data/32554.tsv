2010-05-04T12:18:00.000Z	daverto		Hi, I need some help, I have a iPod Touch 2nd Gen and I am trying to add music using Rhythmbox provided in 10.04 Lucid. My iPod mounts fine and everything but when I try to add a song to my iPod it gives: "Error while getting peer-to-peer dbus connection: The name :1.65 was not provided by any .service files"
2010-05-04T12:19:00.000Z	ldez	daverto	personally, I didn't have so much luck using Rythmnbox to manage my iPod.. I had more luck with gtkpod which you can find in the Ubuntu Software Center
2010-05-04T12:19:00.000Z	daverto	ldez	I will give it a go, grabbing it now
