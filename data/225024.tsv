2006-05-18T12:54:00.000Z	ChoboMog		Hey.  Could someone help me with a possible compatibility problem with a new hard drive?
2006-05-18T12:54:00.000Z	ChoboMog		I'm running an old Pentium III PC and am planning to buy/install a 250gb hard drive which is on sale.  However, I've heard that there can be problems with an old BIOS and a hard drive above 137gb.  I know there is a utility from Intel, called the Application Accelerator, which can let me access the full 250gb even if my BIOS does not support it.  Unfortunately the utility is only offered for Windows, so there is no Linux support.
2006-05-18T12:55:00.000Z	ChoboMog		The utility would work for me right now, since I am still running Windows XP.  However, I was planning on installing Drapper Drake when it is released on June 1st.  Does anyone know if a similar utility is available for Linux or if the drive might work, even with an old BIOS, as long as each partition is below 137gb?
