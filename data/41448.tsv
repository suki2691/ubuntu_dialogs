2009-12-02T16:38:00.000Z	Blinkee	FunkyWeasel	im still deciding to drop my X-Fi in or stick with the on-board(realtek) device to avoid problems...
2009-12-02T16:40:00.000Z	Blinkee	FunkyWeasel	do u have a pci audio card to test with?
2009-12-02T16:41:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	Blinkee	I've got a Yamaha pci card which was in there that I took out incase it was causing a conflict.  But whatever I try audio seems to die every 2 days tops.
2009-12-02T16:43:00.000Z	FunkyWeasel	Blinkee	Tried both, both had similar problems.  Was initially just using ALSA, set up pulseaudio to see if it would be any better.  Am getting resigned to a daily restart.
