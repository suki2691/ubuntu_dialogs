2005-11-21T16:40:00.000Z	NightBird		anyone know how I would share a folder across the network?
2005-11-21T16:40:00.000Z	Niomi	NightBird	look up info on samba, nfs, or SSH, all are good options. i like SSH.
2005-11-21T16:41:00.000Z	NightBird	Niomi	I was wanting one that windows would be able to use natively without needing to install anything..
2005-11-21T16:42:00.000Z	Niomi	NightBird	samba would be your best bet then.
