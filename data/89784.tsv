2008-05-25T19:59:00.000Z	bullgard4		My Hardy did install 149 files having compiz in their names although I never said that I want compiz. I do not need compiz. How can I safely deinstall compiz?
2008-05-25T20:00:00.000Z	xodiak	bullgard4	I just removed compiz using the synaptic package manager.
2008-05-25T20:00:00.000Z	xodiak	bullgard4	I mean just now did it.
2008-05-25T20:00:00.000Z	bullgard4	xodiak	And what packages did you de-select?
