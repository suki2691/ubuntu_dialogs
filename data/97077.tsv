2008-11-08T14:12:00.000Z	_Drax		Im having random freezes with 8.10, kernel panics! I tried googling around and found that it had to do with intel wifi thingie but I dont run any wifi cards etc. Is there any fix for this??
2008-11-08T14:13:00.000Z	_Drax		What, I dont even think the module is running? Is it by default even though you dont have a wifi card??

2008-11-08T14:16:00.000Z	damkor	_Drax	nope, my system hangs but I can still log in through ssh, so I'm guessing it's a different error
