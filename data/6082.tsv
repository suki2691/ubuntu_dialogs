2012-01-30T19:55:00.000Z	martian	cokesmoke	you get blank screens on your actual monitors, or just when you try to connect with vnc?
2012-01-30T20:01:00.000Z	martian	cokesmoke	perhaps visual effects are disrupting it
2012-01-30T20:03:00.000Z	cokesmoke	martian	wouldn't that make problems during execution of the vncserver command too then?
