2006-08-08T10:32:00.000Z	nalioth	harmental	the standard main security universe and multiverse should work
2006-08-08T10:38:00.000Z	harmental	nalioth	 i still get v.13.5....
2006-08-08T10:39:00.000Z	nalioth	harmental	you may have to compile it yourself.  use checkinstall instead of 'make install'   join #conky for more help
