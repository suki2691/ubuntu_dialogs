2007-12-04T01:09:00.000Z	unkmar		I have a PC with a nVidia MX440 video card.  The "Extra" Visual Effects will not work unless a driver is downloaded.
2007-12-04T01:09:00.000Z	unkmar		I'm running from the Live CD.  The driver downloads and installs but requires a reboot for the changes to take effect.
2007-12-04T01:10:00.000Z	unkmar		Clearly, a reboot removes the downloaded changes.  Suggestions?
