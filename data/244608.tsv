2005-11-15T12:15:00.000Z	dirkson		Say- Anyone know how to get the ncurses package? I'm a bit of a linux n00b, but I need it to recompile the kernel. (I need newest version for some hardware of mine)
2005-11-15T12:16:00.000Z	dirkson		(The kernel says it needs ncurses)
2005-11-15T12:17:00.000Z	gratuit	dirkson	install libncurses5-dev or whatever the ncurses dev package is these days
