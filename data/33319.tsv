2011-11-28T16:09:00.000Z	unomi		Hiyas - I am seeing somewhat poor performance copying files between 2 11.04 computers I was getting ~600kbs
2011-11-28T16:10:00.000Z	rumpe1	unomi	which kind of connection? from which filesystem to which filesystem?
2011-11-28T16:11:00.000Z	unomi		after setting netbios name and ensuring that they are mounted via 'cifs' I am now seeing ~1.2 mb/s which is still alot slower than I think it should be
2011-11-28T16:11:00.000Z	unomi	rumpe1	at these speeds the filesystem doesn't matter, the connection is wifi though
