2009-10-31T04:16:00.000Z	justdave		I have an nVidia Mac Mini and had Jaunty working fine... after upgrading to Karmic there's no sound.  The trick used on Jaunty to make sound work (explicitly setting the model via modprobe.d config) doesn't appear to work.  Anyone have any ideas what to check?

2009-10-31T04:17:00.000Z	justdave		of course, the forums are buried under all the posts from people upgrading the last two days, and Google hasn't indexed it recently enough... :)
2009-10-31T04:17:00.000Z	frostburn	justdave	google indexes it quite quickly
