2010-04-30T17:07:00.000Z	Sdonatas		Hi everyone, can anyone tell me what are the possible drawbacks in Ubuntu 10.04 64bit? Are all apps like firefox, flash, java, gstreamer codecs have 64bit versions at this moment?

2010-04-30T17:09:00.000Z	Sdonatas	om26er	does it mean i can install ubuntu restricted extras the same way as in 32bit distro?
