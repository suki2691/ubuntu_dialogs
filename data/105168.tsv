2012-03-01T16:05:00.000Z	FreddyJunior		I have Ubuntu 11.10 on this laptop and I have plugged my USB key into my laptop... now I opened the Terminal and did   cd /media with everything being okay... but then I did  cd my stuff  and it said   bash: cd: mystuff: No such file or directory

2012-03-01T16:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FreddyJunior	if you run:  cd /media; ls   do you see the folder?
2012-03-01T16:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FreddyJunior	ok then type:   cd   then press TAB to complete the folder name
