2011-06-30T08:00:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	myk_robinson	I believe you should be able to do it by clicking both the left and right mouse buttons. I have to do that on my laptop in blender
2011-06-30T08:01:00.000Z	myk_robinson	Seven_Six_Two	I have a weird trackpad and dont seem to be able to do this. is there a key I can press along with a click to force a middle click?
2011-06-30T08:04:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	myk_robinson	sorry, not that I know of. Unless you can use a numpad to move the mouse (accessibility options?) then there might be a way
