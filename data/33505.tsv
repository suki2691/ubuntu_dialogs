2010-04-25T12:45:00.000Z	findsndcard	Pumpkin	it took me a few hours
2010-04-25T12:45:00.000Z	findsndcard	Pumpkin	its better safe (takes it time) than sorry (corruption)
2010-04-25T12:47:00.000Z	Pumpkin	findsndcard	Yeah I know, but I googled it and there are heaps of horror stories about nothing happining after 60 hours =/ besides I used clonezille to backup everything so it's not total loss if I stop it.
