2010-10-30T07:41:00.000Z	smalls2		Is anyone here well versed with iptables? I'm trying to figure out in ubuntu 10.10 how to set my iptables LOG to another file (ie: /var/log/iptables.log)
2010-10-30T07:41:00.000Z	smalls2		no, I dont think so... it would divert all /var/log/messages bound things then
