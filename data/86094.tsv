2011-02-03T02:46:00.000Z	R0b0t1		I'm using EFI to boot Linux alongside OSX. However, just now, I select the partition w/ Ubuntu on it and choose to boot it. It hangs right after that with the cursor blinking in the top-left. What can I do? My DVD drive has been broken for a while (took it in right before warranty expired, turns out they didn't actually replace it/fix it) so I can't boot off of anything but the hard disk.
