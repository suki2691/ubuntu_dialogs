2006-10-15T06:58:00.000Z	davin	kaot	bah, I want to make a dualboot system (barebone stripped windows for games) but I already have ubuntu, guess ill just have to backup and reinstall Windows and then Ubuntu?
2006-10-15T06:59:00.000Z	kaot	davin	I'm pretty sure you could install windows, then boot off a ubuntu bootdisc and reinstall / reconfigure grub, but off the top of my head I don't know specifics on how to do that.
