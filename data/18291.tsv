2012-10-04T21:38:00.000Z	theadmin	tomasm-	ar x something.deb data.tar.gz && tar xf data.tar.gz && rm data.tar.gz
2012-10-04T21:38:00.000Z	tomasm-	theadmin	so a deb file is just a tar file?
2012-10-04T21:39:00.000Z	theadmin	tomasm-	No, it's an ar archive with a bunch of other stuff in it, the actual "contents" (i.e. files that package installs) are in the "data.tar.gz" part of the archive.
