2008-04-08T19:08:00.000Z	DaveTarmac		I'm looking for a piece of web development software, preferably for GNOME rather than KDE - but I'm not that picky. the only thing I really would want is the function to work on a remote system. Anyone got any recommendations for me?

2008-04-08T19:13:00.000Z	DaveTarmac	cwraig	OK, cheers - I'll give that a try tonight
