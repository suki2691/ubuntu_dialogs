2007-12-26T20:44:00.000Z	naxa	ompaul	i will check thank you but what really annoyes me is the menu editor. I already found the files where gnome keeps these names and i edited them but i can only edit them from gnome, and when i log out gnome see that my config is not the default (i changed the default to be ok with us) and saves the wrong idea state to a local place... and i cannot delete them gnome always checks if i deleted them or made them change and saves the wrong st
2007-12-26T20:45:00.000Z	naxa	ompaul	the problem is that gnome is running... it's not enough to change de default system files and the locale files becouse i would have to change them in the memory, too...
