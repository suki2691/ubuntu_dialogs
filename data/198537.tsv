2007-06-23T09:03:00.000Z	busfahrer		I want to install a single package from feisty-backports, but I don't want to add it to sources.list, since I don't want the other updates in there. How to do this properly?

2007-06-23T09:04:00.000Z	busfahrer	defrysk	Won't that cause breakage?
2007-06-23T09:05:00.000Z	defrysk	busfahrer	nope , why ?
