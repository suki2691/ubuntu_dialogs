2005-02-13T17:30:00.000Z	ubuRookie		I am just starting with ubuntua and I have one simple question to make
2005-02-13T17:32:00.000Z	ubuRookie		I am trying to install my winmodem in ubuntu. I have found all the necessary packages but when I go to install them it asks me the linux source build directory. From what I understand that's the package "linux-headers-2.6-386". How I get it from xp to put it in my ubuntu?
2005-02-13T17:33:00.000Z	linux_mafia	ubuRookie	you using ext3?
