2006-06-04T06:45:00.000Z	OrEnn		Why is xchat in universe? I can't see anything "ugly" about it.
2006-06-04T06:46:00.000Z	DarkMageZ	OrEnn	ugly is what we call the packages in multiverse, not universe :)
2006-06-04T06:47:00.000Z	DarkMageZ	OrEnn	because it is not offically supported, it is maintained my the universe team :)
2006-06-04T06:52:00.000Z	DarkMageZ	OrEnn	which app?
