2010-07-30T15:04:00.000Z	alcy1_	wildeja	errm folks, strange issue. Wireless card AR5007G. driver ath5k loaded, dmesg doesn't show anything suspicious. networks are being detected just fine. HOWEVER, when I enter the WPA passphrase, it just won't connect. this ubuntu is running inside windows (through wubi)...10.04
2010-07-30T15:05:00.000Z	wildeja	alcy1_	is it an ad-hoc connection
