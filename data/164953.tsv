2009-01-11T16:31:00.000Z	neil_d	mayank	is it a HDD install?
2009-01-11T16:32:00.000Z	neil_d	mayank	did you install to a HDD not running off a CDROM?
2009-01-11T16:34:00.000Z	neil_d	mayank	oh! I don't know anything about that.  but generally the "/etc/network/interfaces" is where the info on how to setup the ethernet cards go.
