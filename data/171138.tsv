2006-08-13T10:52:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		oh, how can I make a .mid file play in mplayer?
2006-08-13T10:52:00.000Z	EriK	Geoffrey2	 I use clamav to protect users from themselves.  I don't need the protection on our linux/bsd machines, but a lot of our users need plenty of protection from themselves.
2006-08-13T10:54:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	EriK	I tried install clamav....couldn't figure out how to even make it start up, and since everyone on here insisted it was totally pointless on a linux system, I just removed it
