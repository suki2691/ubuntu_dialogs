2007-04-09T12:41:00.000Z	ardchoille	demortes	I could be wrong, but it sounds like the unused variable is due to the file being written in another language.
2007-04-09T12:42:00.000Z	ardchoille	demortes	That "funny looking a" may be due to it being written in another language.. like if I write a source file in Russian. You think?
2007-04-09T12:42:00.000Z	ardchoille	demortes	Ok.
