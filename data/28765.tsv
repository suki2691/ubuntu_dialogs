2010-08-03T19:23:00.000Z	peepingtom	wazzup	yes you can
2010-08-03T19:24:00.000Z	peepingtom	wazzup	It generally goes pretty smoothly. There are 2 methods, using "Wubi" or a standard install where you repartition your drive
2010-08-03T19:26:00.000Z	peepingtom	wazzup	probably, it only becomes complicated when people have "recovery" partitoons on laptops, where grub misdetects a recovery partition as a windows installatio. For example, look at edbian's conversation in this room
