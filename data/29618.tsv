2010-07-21T10:26:00.000Z	DesiArnez6	ImaLamer	on my system I always see grub on startup, and If I don't select anything it automatically continues with a normal startup
2010-07-21T10:27:00.000Z	ImaLamer	DesiArnez6	on my lappy it's the only OS and isn't shown unless i interrupt the boot (grub2)
2010-07-21T10:33:00.000Z	DesiArnez6	ImaLamer	Ah, so its like my last ubuntu laptop where you had to interrupt the boot to get grub, so it depends on the computer. ( I have never had 2 OS's on one computer, although it might be fun, I don't want to treason my Ubuntu for one of the big corporate two un less necessary ;) I didnt realize you were talking with someone named fearful, I just assumed you were fearful that you saw grub at started up, and I was trying to say that
