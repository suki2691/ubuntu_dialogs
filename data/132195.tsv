2008-10-05T01:50:00.000Z	Generic6552		Hi.  I got myself into trouble... again.  I upgraded to Itrepid Ibex without an adequate appreciation for the difference 26 days can make.  Is there any way to downgrade back to Hardy Haron (8.04)?
2008-10-05T01:52:00.000Z	Generic6552		Shucks.  Okay then, can I use the Hardy Heron installer to uninstall Ibex?
2008-10-05T01:52:00.000Z	Generic6552		Okay.  Not quite the answer I was hoping for, but it's certainly better than nothing ; )  Thank s once more for your help.
