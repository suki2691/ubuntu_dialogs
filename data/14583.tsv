2012-03-24T15:34:00.000Z	daviddoria		I want to make a shortcut key that shuts down the computer. is that possible?
2012-03-24T15:35:00.000Z	Prabz	daviddoria	sure, but you'll need to enter your password everytime
2012-03-24T15:35:00.000Z	daviddoria	Prabz	Hm that's annoying. The whole reason I want this is because I have a computer that doesn't always have a monitor, so I just want to press a key and turn it off without any interaction
2012-03-24T15:37:00.000Z	Prabz	daviddoria	reason is only a process in superuser mode can give shutdown command
