2008-01-13T23:29:00.000Z	frafra		hi all, I've seen in synaptic many openoffice.org-style-* packages. I would like to change the default openoffice ubuntu look with tango style. How to do this?
2008-01-13T23:30:00.000Z	nickrud	frafra	in open office, it's under options -> view -> icon style
2008-01-13T23:32:00.000Z	frafra	nickrud	I've to do this from a shell, because I'm making a custom version of ubuntu
2008-01-13T23:32:00.000Z	nickrud	frafra	no clue for that, sorry
