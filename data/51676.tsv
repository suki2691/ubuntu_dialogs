2009-11-02T04:05:00.000Z	lantizia		If I activate the nvidia drivers, X never launches - and my text login prompt flashes for all eternity without stopping or telling me what is wrong it's stupid
2009-11-02T04:05:00.000Z	lantizia		any way of getting some useful information?
2009-11-02T04:07:00.000Z	Alaric`	lantizia	that sounds like it explains my problem ....   and no reason for nvidoa to even be installed on this machine, it doesn't have an nvidia card
2009-11-02T04:08:00.000Z	lantizia	Alaric`	well in older releases X would try to start 5 times then give you a reason why it failed then stop trying - this just keeps flashing as tho it never stops trying... have to go into recovery mode instead, can't even log in properly
