2006-10-13T15:30:00.000Z	friday		Hi, I changed my LCD monitor from using the DVI connection to the VGA connection on my graphics card. Then I had to run dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, but apparently the default frequency settings doesnt, work. Now I im stuck at GDM with a frequency my monitor cant display. How do I get to a console prompt? Is there an easy way to tell what frequencies i need to input? Why doesnt it just autodetect it as it did when I had it on the DVI connector?
