2008-05-13T02:08:00.000Z	kerin		I'm running Heron (fully updated) and my NTFS partition is available, but it doesn't mount until i access the partition through the Places menu or mount it in console.
2008-05-13T02:09:00.000Z	kerin		the partition's in my fstab, but i dunno if the settings are correct.
2008-05-13T02:09:00.000Z	kerin		does anyone know how to make it mount at startup?
2008-05-13T02:10:00.000Z	msnbot	kerin	you have to use /etc/fstab file
