2011-04-13T02:13:00.000Z	qikki		Do I need two separate partitions when installing ubuntu? I read a guide that says one for the file system and another one for linux swap. I did this but when I'm installing ubuntu, do I click on the option "Install them side by side"? And if so, what does the slider on the bottom decide?
