2007-04-05T06:07:00.000Z	bruenig	whtet	the chroot wiki is not really all that crazy, if you are having some real big problems with that, chroot might be a bit much
2007-04-05T06:09:00.000Z	bruenig	whtet	I have looked at the chroot wiki, it is basically downloading a package and then copying a bunch of stuff
