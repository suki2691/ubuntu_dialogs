2012-02-24T08:36:00.000Z	marcosroriz		Hi guys. I'm still using ubuntu natty (11.04), the main reason is because I found the complete lib transition (libgtk2 -> libgtk3) in oneiric too buggy. I was wondering what is the current 'status' of oneiric, is it buggy? Is gnome 3 currently more 'customizable'?
2012-02-24T08:38:00.000Z	marcosroriz		I kinda like unity in natty, because gnome2 is way stable and customizable than gnome 3.
2012-02-24T08:40:00.000Z	marcosroriz		Really liked the default 'look' of ubuntu natty
2012-02-24T08:41:00.000Z	martian	marcosroriz	ditto. Never been more pleased with a default theme.
