2011-12-21T18:06:00.000Z	mouseover1		How do I determine the time when my system went offline?
2011-12-21T18:07:00.000Z	iceroot	mouseover1	offline = halt or internet-connection lost?
2011-12-21T18:08:00.000Z	iceroot	mouseover1	maybe /var/log/syslog has some infos about it
2011-12-21T18:28:00.000Z	mouseover1	iceroot	thanks
