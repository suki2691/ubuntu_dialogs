2006-04-20T12:17:00.000Z	mbelgedhes	harisund	try to check /etc/rc2.d
2006-04-20T12:19:00.000Z	harisund	mbelgedhes	Yes, but there is no update-manager script. I have removed most of my scripts to increase boot time.
2006-04-20T12:21:00.000Z	harisund	mbelgedhes	Will do it. FlannelKing: Got it. Am having a look. Thanks a ton
