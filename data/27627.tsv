2010-08-12T08:57:00.000Z	naptastic	four2zero_ubu	did you try left-clicking the network icon in your system tray and clicking the interface you wanted to bring up?
2010-08-12T08:57:00.000Z	four2zero_ubu	naptastic	yes, i tried that method after i used the manual command, but then it disconnected the wired eth0.
2010-08-12T08:58:00.000Z	naptastic	four2zero_ubu	ok. (I'm not much of a fan of NetworkManager either.)
