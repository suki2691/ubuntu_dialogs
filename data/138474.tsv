2007-05-03T09:04:00.000Z	magnetron		this week i had to visit a homepage that had some info about my job. it required javascript, flash, shockwave and internet explorer. after reboot into xp and ie (which crashed when i first tried to enter the site) i found out that it used ALL THIS for displaying some plain text, some links and a few pdfs. HTML 3 can do that!
2007-05-03T09:04:00.000Z	jatt	magnetron	do you have the link of that homepage?
2007-05-03T09:05:00.000Z	magnetron	jatt	it requires a login. it's job related. but now i am way offtopic
