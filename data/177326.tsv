2006-07-30T14:16:00.000Z	_stev_	Stokkstein	what do you want to edit?
2006-07-30T14:18:00.000Z	_stev_	Stokkstein	you can use the vi command sudo /etc/apt/sources.list (type i in to insert, then escape, :wq= write and quit , but use first the command vimtutor to learn the basics
2006-07-30T14:19:00.000Z	_stev_	Stokkstein	I mean sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list (very powerfull, but first 15minutes of vimtutor)
