2005-11-03T06:05:00.000Z	kanako	p4yn3	logical volume manager? way of having > 4 partitions on a system that also runs windows i believe
2005-11-03T06:06:00.000Z	p4yn3	kanako	when i am prompted with the partition choices, should I pick erase entire disk, or erase entire disk and use lvm? I will only be using ubuntu
2005-11-03T06:08:00.000Z	kanako	p4yn3	if you just want the whole disk as one partition pick "erase entire disk"
