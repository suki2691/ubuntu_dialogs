2011-03-28T16:07:00.000Z	loki__		something that can kick microsoft in the nuts... i'll call it a boot to face routing system... okay guess that doesn't help
2011-03-28T16:09:00.000Z	loki__		but, if anyone is able i could use some help reseting nautilius to default.. somehow it seems to still work with links.. but not when trying to browse through the Places tab...
2011-03-28T16:10:00.000Z	loki__		thank you Willis
2011-03-28T16:11:00.000Z	ohsix	loki__	gconftool --recursive-unset /apps/nautilus, but it probably wont fix that
