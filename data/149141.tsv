2007-02-03T09:54:00.000Z	unop	djtansey	 yes
2007-02-03T09:57:00.000Z	djtansey	unop	good to know. too bad 2.6.19 is no longer available, as far as i can tell, and the 2.6.20 kernels madwifi doesn't work.
2007-02-03T09:58:00.000Z	unop	djtansey	 well, it's unfortunate .. but feisty requires the newer kernels .. give it a few months to resolve itself, it's still a pre-release candidate
