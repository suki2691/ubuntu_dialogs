2009-11-01T17:04:00.000Z	MasterJimmy		is anyone having THIS error upon bootup: One or more of the mounts listed in /etc/fstab cannot yet be mounted:
2009-11-01T17:05:00.000Z	palmje	MasterJimmy	that means that there is an invalid entry in the fstab - have you modified the file at all, or is the default one?
2009-11-01T17:06:00.000Z	MasterJimmy	palmje	i know what it means now. last night i almost trashed my hard drive because of it. i'm trying to help those who are having this problem.
2009-11-01T17:07:00.000Z	MasterJimmy	palmje	this has been a big problem for several uses of ubuntu who were doing the upgrade. the upgrade fails and they can't boot or format the partitions. so the hard drive is stuck in limbo
