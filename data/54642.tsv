2012-07-09T05:30:00.000Z	Roasted	goddard	yeah thanks, doesn't solve chrome though
2012-07-09T05:31:00.000Z	goddard	Roasted	ive been hearing a lot of reports of chrome issues lately.. i would just use another browser until it is fixed or try reinstalling and purging
2012-07-09T05:31:00.000Z	Roasted	goddard	k, I was just curious if other users were seeing it or if it was just me. I'm happy to use firefox.
