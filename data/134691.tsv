2007-05-10T13:57:00.000Z	leftyfBX	lizardmenke	, which feed parser are you talking about? Like I said, i'm looking for a ticker solution to go into my gnome panel .. i don't want to use gdesklets .. they are very limited in function
2007-05-10T13:58:00.000Z	lizardmenke	leftyfBX	ok sorry did see that
2007-05-10T13:59:00.000Z	lizardmenke	leftyfBX	I remember havin a ticker in fedora w. Gnome, can't rmember the name though
