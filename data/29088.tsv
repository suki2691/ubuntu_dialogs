2012-02-08T21:57:00.000Z	pittstains		I have a question about the $PATH variable... when I echo $PATH, /usr/local/bin is not in the output; however, it *is* in PATH in my /etc/environment file
2012-02-08T21:58:00.000Z	ikonia	pittstains	/etc/environment is not used
2012-02-08T21:59:00.000Z	pittstains	ikonia	where is the default $PATH set, then?
2012-02-08T21:59:00.000Z	ikonia	pittstains	in your home directory
