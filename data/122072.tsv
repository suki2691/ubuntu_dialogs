2008-03-27T06:51:00.000Z	Kl4m	badcarbine	you use synaptic
2008-03-27T07:01:00.000Z	Kl4m	badcarbine	Applications, shortcuts and system have pretty much every application, except for the lesser known ones or console commands for which you have to know the appropriate commands
2008-03-27T07:02:00.000Z	Kl4m	badcarbine	system utilities and many programs store their executable in /bin, /sbin or /usr/bin. You can start from there and type "man command" to know more about a command ex.: man man
