2008-05-06T05:31:00.000Z	Bodsda	lmosher	nonfree flash plugin available in repo's
2008-05-06T05:31:00.000Z	lmosher	Bodsda	that's better than any of the 3 firefox suggests? What's the package name?
2008-05-06T05:32:00.000Z	Bodsda	lmosher	actually -- the flsh plugin FF sugests i believe is the package -- search synaptic for   flash     should be easy to find
