2006-03-12T06:58:00.000Z	sohmc		I'm getting an error saying my C++ cannot create executibles.  but I have builttools installed.  is there something I need to enable to make it so I can compile programs?
2006-03-12T06:58:00.000Z	mgedmin	sohmc	do you have build-essential installed?
2006-03-12T07:01:00.000Z	mgedmin	sohmc	paste the contents of config.log to http://ubuntu.pastebin.com
2006-03-12T07:03:00.000Z	mgedmin	sohmc	that's either a GCC bug, or faulty hardware (http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/)
