I found something about it online but it was for NTFS file systems, I have windows 98SE and FAT32. I heard that ubuntu should automatically put a link on your desktop, but mine didn't.

2006-08-11T12:34:00.000Z	sith_man	bruenig	how?
2006-08-11T12:34:00.000Z	bruenig	sith_man	does it already mount on startup or does it not mount at all?
