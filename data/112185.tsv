2007-12-15T11:26:00.000Z	Slynderdale		Ok well, I have a home network with three computers on it, currently I'm the only one on it. Under windows, my computer has the static network IP of 192.168.1.105, subnet 255.255.255.0 and gateway of 192.168.1.1 yet if I enter these under Ubuntu, it doesn't connect and I have no network activity till I remove the info/
