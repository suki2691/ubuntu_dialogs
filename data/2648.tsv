2012-06-16T10:58:00.000Z	riz0n		I am not running Ubuntu Desktop. I am running Ubuntu Server. I do not have a Gnome screen, everything I am doing is straight through SSH and WinSCP.
2012-06-16T10:58:00.000Z	diluted	riz0n	same here... closet server with no mouse/keyboard/monitor
2012-06-16T10:58:00.000Z	riz0n		I may at a a later date install Gnome and "NoMachine" just for fun.
2012-06-16T10:59:00.000Z	riz0n	diluted	that is what I have, but the hard drive is quite old and I'm afraid it's going to quit spinning any day... I have all my web sites, mysql databases imported, dovecot functioning, everything but postfix smtp.
