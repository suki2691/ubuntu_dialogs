2011-08-18T03:18:00.000Z	Gasseus		how would I make it so that the user@host part of my public ssh key is something like the@ubernerd.us?
2011-08-18T03:18:00.000Z	edbian	Gasseus	Bye the ubernerd.us domain and point it at your public IP
2011-08-18T03:19:00.000Z	Gasseus	edbian	I already own ubernerd.us, how would I make it so my ssh public key has that username though?
2011-08-18T03:19:00.000Z	edbian	Gasseus	Oh!  I'm not sure :(
