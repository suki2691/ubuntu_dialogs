2006-07-26T14:49:00.000Z	ironfroggy		in particular, i want all my desktops and laptops to use the same network share for their archives.
2006-07-26T14:50:00.000Z	Alpha232	ironfroggy	sure... but make sure you keep the bare essentials there before you mount it
2006-07-26T14:52:00.000Z	ironfroggy	Alpha232	so that works? because im planning to use the same kind of method to store cached files from remote stores for access when im away from the network.
