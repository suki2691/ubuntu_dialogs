2011-01-11T01:41:00.000Z	herghost		Trying to install a game from CD using Wine (game listed as Platinum on wine db) - can't install because .exe files don't have +x bit set - but it's a read only file system!  help?

2011-01-11T01:44:00.000Z	herghost	inknoir	ha!  command line worked instantly.  Thanks again!
