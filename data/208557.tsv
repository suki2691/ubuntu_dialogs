2006-09-11T15:16:00.000Z	app		I am asking this now for the 5th time in couple of weeks time here: does ANYONE have any experiences/review of the Canonical support contracts? Are they worth it? Do they really solve most Ubuntu problems for the potential 100 million regular office workers that could try to migrate from Windows to Ubuntu?

2006-09-11T15:17:00.000Z	app	Flannel	do you mean that anybody with a job will not waste his working time using Linux ;-)
2006-09-11T15:17:00.000Z	Flannel	app	what?  No, I said that's probably a better place to ask your question.
