2010-09-18T19:20:00.000Z	eross		i notice the latest kernels are 2.6.34.7..  i'm at 2.6.32.24.  does that mean ubuntu lags behind in any security hole fixes and will go thru a slow down before the 'speed up' fix was found in 2.6.35?
2010-09-18T19:22:00.000Z	eross		odd..
2010-09-18T19:22:00.000Z	eross		just wondering why it's slow to update
