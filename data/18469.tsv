2011-02-04T23:29:00.000Z	ChogyDan	QuartZo	I think that depends on how you have hooked them up
2011-02-04T23:30:00.000Z	QuartZo	ChogyDan	one on each SATA channel
2011-02-04T23:33:00.000Z	ChogyDan	QuartZo	I would give it a try.  If it doesn't work, try enabling immed in Edit > Plugins > wodim > Configure   (I know, it is hidden)
