2007-07-21T08:53:00.000Z	jgoguen	bobgill	if you right-click the RAR and choose to extract, I *think* it will show a progress bar, but it's been a very long time since I've done that so I'm not 100% sure
2007-07-21T08:55:00.000Z	jgoguen	bobgill	guess the command line way is the only way to get a progress reading then
