2012-09-06T13:47:00.000Z	very		I accidentally removed a keyboard shortcut from gedit. o.O Do you think it's possible to restore the shortcut?

2012-09-06T13:50:00.000Z	very	gordonjcp	Oh, that would be great. Well, I used the "External Tools" plugin and set the shortcut "Ctrl+f" for such external tool. Now it's not possible to start "Find..." by this shortcut anymore. Even though I removed the shortcut from the external tool already.
