2005-10-24T05:00:00.000Z	Ectropian		is there Default Root password?  I can't remember setting one, hehe
2005-10-24T05:01:00.000Z	Narf	Ectropian	type "sudo passwd root" to set it for the first time
2005-10-24T05:03:00.000Z	Ectropian	Narf	-l doesn't work either
2005-10-24T05:04:00.000Z	Narf	Ectropian	worked on the Hoary install I made 2 days ago, not sure about Breezy as I didn't have the change to try it yet :)
