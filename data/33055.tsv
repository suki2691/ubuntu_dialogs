2010-09-23T00:25:00.000Z	sweetpi	SystemParadox	whats wrong with by uuid?
2010-09-23T00:26:00.000Z	SystemParadox	sweetpi	uuid is really really horrible when you look in your fstab later. You have no idea what is what. Also, it breaks if you've done any disk cloning
2010-09-23T00:28:00.000Z	sweetpi	SystemParadox	good point, guess ive never ran into that problem
