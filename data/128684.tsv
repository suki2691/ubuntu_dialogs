2008-12-23T12:04:00.000Z	hashbrowns		I'm having problems dualbooting windows xp pro x64 and ubuntu 8.10 64-bit.  The ubuntu install went allright, no errors.  After the reboot though, my computer just automatically booted my windows installation without any prompt to choose which OS I would like to boot.  How do I fix this?
