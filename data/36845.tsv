2010-04-02T02:15:00.000Z	Typos_King	Gifted_Child	  hide?  what do you mean by 'hide'?   boot you right into ubuntu with no menu?
2010-04-02T02:20:00.000Z	Typos_King	Gifted_Child	  not sure you can :|
2010-04-02T02:36:00.000Z	Typos_King	Gifted_Child	  I think you might be able to use -> hiddemenu <ENTER> timeout=0
