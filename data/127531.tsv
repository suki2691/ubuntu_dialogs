2009-01-29T19:54:00.000Z	Ben_Cs		hello. what's the difference between kernel 2.6.24-23-generic and kernel 2.6.24-23-386? because after the update (8.04.2) the alsamixer doesn't work in 386 but works in generic?
2009-01-29T19:54:00.000Z	Myrtti	Ben_Cs	in general you don't need 386
2009-01-29T19:55:00.000Z	Myrtti	Ben_Cs	generic has surpassed it
2009-01-29T19:55:00.000Z	Ben_Cs	Myrtti	so i can remove 386 from menu.lst?
