2007-11-23T23:58:00.000Z	ronrito		Hi, I'm sharing some folders with windows machines, I can't see mi pc on "my network places" but I still can see the files by entering in the winexlorer mi pc IP, any ideas on how to solve this?

2007-11-24T00:00:00.000Z	ronrito	tmartin	The workgroup is properly configured, I cannot enter mi ubuntu machine by using it's network name only using it's IP
2007-11-24T00:01:00.000Z	tmartin	ronrito	hmm, i'm not sure then
