2009-11-15T10:05:00.000Z	Ironicus_		I downloaded xampp and I simply don't know how to install it. I followed the instructions and it doesn't work
2009-11-15T10:06:00.000Z	bazhang	Ironicus_	xampp is not supported here try lamp
2009-11-15T10:10:00.000Z	bazhang	Ironicus_	as I mentioned xampp is not supported, use lamp instead
2009-11-15T10:13:00.000Z	Ironicus_	bazhang	I can get lamp directly from ubuntu? I can't find it
