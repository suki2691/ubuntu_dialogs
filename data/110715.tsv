2008-06-23T02:52:00.000Z	ut2004player		Hello, I know this has nothing to do with ubuntu but can someone help me please. Is there any difference between 667 ddr2 ram and 800 ddr2 ram?
2008-06-23T02:52:00.000Z	LimCore	ut2004player	I would guess the 800 is faster
2008-06-23T02:53:00.000Z	LimCore	ut2004player	probably not too much.  Even for games - most data will be stored on the GFX card
2008-06-23T02:55:00.000Z	LimCore	ut2004player	on ubuntu, check out the tremulous game ( #tremulous )   its a cool 3d quake engine based game
