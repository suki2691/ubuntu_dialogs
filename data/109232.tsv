2009-07-24T05:41:00.000Z	Paavi2_0	cooper77z	is that a problem?
2009-07-24T05:43:00.000Z	Paavi2_0	cooper77z	pidgin is a program, not a protocol. and with pidgin you can do im (instant messaging) and irc (internet relay chat)
2009-07-24T05:44:00.000Z	Paavi2_0	cooper77z	in irc you can find out who are you talking to with command /whois i.e /whois Paavi2_0
