2012-10-25T05:07:00.000Z	Tohuw		Unrelated question: how can I pass an option from a Unity shortcut? For instance, can I invoke gnome-terminal --maximized instead of gnome-terminal from the Unity shortcut?
2012-10-25T05:07:00.000Z	yanick_	Tohuw	I bought my laptop 4 years ago :) and, YES! I will NOT buy another ATI card again
