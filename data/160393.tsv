2008-06-10T09:02:00.000Z	critta		Hello. I am having some sound troubles. I can get sound fine in Pidgin, Rhythmbox and Firefox, but not all three at the same time.
2008-06-10T09:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	critta	Are you viewing flash videos in Firefox?
2008-06-10T09:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	critta	, I think the problem is that flash does not work with pulseaudio yet, you have a few options if that is the problem you are having. 1: install libflashsupport to get in development and still buggy ( makes flash less stable ) support for flash in pulseaudio 2: stop using pulseaudio and instead use ALSA directly ( this can be done from System -> Preferences -> Sound )
