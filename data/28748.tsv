2010-08-14T11:33:00.000Z	Lizzard88		Im reading the guide about grub2, but i don't see how to make it run before my default operation system starts up
2010-08-14T11:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	Lizzard88	grub2 will start first and will chain boot your other operating system.  your other operating system can still be default
2010-08-14T11:35:00.000Z	Lizzard88	sacarlson	how can i choose which operating system to run?
2010-08-14T11:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	Lizzard88	from ubuntu I guess I would use the gui start-manager  to set what I wanted as the default boot
