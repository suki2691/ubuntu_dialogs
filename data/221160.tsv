After some try (checking device.map and stuff) I think the main problem is that the linux partition, where grub is installed in, is too far away from the mbr of that disk. Linux is actually installed in the last 30GB of a 1TB USB hard disk. If I use a pendrive to boot the system all works like a charm. What I need to know is: can I overwrite the mbr
