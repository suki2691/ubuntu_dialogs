2011-08-28T18:28:00.000Z	hypnin	Skummel	I've searched around and didn't find really where to ask. I'm interested in contributing to Ubuntu as part of a graduation thesis. I'm interested specifically in Security (Networking and OS internals too). All I need practically is someone from Ubuntu/Canonical who would be a supervisor, help define the roadmap/objectives and answer any queries about work done from school if needed
