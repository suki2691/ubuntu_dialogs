2008-09-11T07:49:00.000Z	eblume		Hi! I need to transfer a Very Large File (8.8 gigs) from an Ubuntu machine to a ista machine. They are connected on a wireless network, and I am computer savvy. The wireless transfer speed would take 3 hours.
2008-09-11T07:49:00.000Z	eblume		My question is - how hard is it to set up a crossover ethernet connection to speed it up?
2008-09-11T07:51:00.000Z	magnatop	eblume	have you ever made a cat5 cable?
2008-09-11T07:51:00.000Z	eblume	magnatop	I have, and I have both crossover and noncrossover at hand.
