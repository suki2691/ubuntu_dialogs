2008-06-05T21:54:00.000Z	anirudh0	tabularasa_	afaik you cant..turn on full volume in alsamixer though
2008-06-05T21:54:00.000Z	tabularasa_	anirudh0	the volume is already at its MAX
2008-06-05T21:55:00.000Z	anirudh0	tabularasa_	then its a thing with the particular file you are working with..but try with avidemux though..it will be interesting to know if it works
