2012-01-09T01:18:00.000Z	StepNjump		I'd like to run photorec but their website says it is good for EXT2/EXT3 though everybody recommends me to give it a shot.. Supposedly they tried it themselves...

2012-01-09T01:19:00.000Z	robbbie	StepNjump	i had a large array fail, ext4 and was able to recover the data with photorec basically doing a rawread of the filesystem
2012-01-09T01:20:00.000Z	robbbie	StepNjump	i believe so, photorec is great.
