2006-01-13T11:27:00.000Z	Hendikins	muhammad	The Gecko 1.7 -> Gecko 1.8 upgrade breaks stuff.
2006-01-13T11:28:00.000Z	Hendikins	muhammad	Unfortunately this is somewhat normal with Gecko upgrades. You can install 1.5 alongside the official 1.0.7 though.
2006-01-13T11:30:00.000Z	muhammad	Hendikins	I tried that, but it tells me that another version of FF is already running, and I need to close it, I'm sure 1.0.7 is closed though.
