2011-06-20T21:08:00.000Z	qwerty121_		Hello all! I am using XAMPP for linux. PHP's mail function isn't working for me. Didn't change any config file that may have connection with it. Am I missing something? [Sorry, if it's not the right place to ask the question.]

2011-06-20T21:10:00.000Z	qwerty121_	ikonia	hmm. thanks. was wondering if anyone uses it and can help me.
2011-06-20T21:10:00.000Z	ikonia	qwerty121_	no, we don't support it
