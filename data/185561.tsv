I gave 10GB to /root 20GB to /home and 1GB to /swap (i know thats a lot).  I ran into problems when trying to format the remaining 219 GB as FAT32, so I just left it as free space.  Now I want to format it so that I can share files between Linux and Windows.  What's the best way to create this partition?

2006-05-27T16:48:00.000Z	jonuk	spacey	 what's the standard size for a FAT32 partition?
