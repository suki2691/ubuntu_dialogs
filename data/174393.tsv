2007-05-14T12:55:00.000Z	RAOF	wauwau	It's generally a good idea to make a "/", a "/home" and a "swap" partition.
2007-05-14T12:57:00.000Z	RAOF	wauwau	Depending on how much space you have, "/" should be about 5-10Gb, "swap" should be 512Mb->1Gb, and "/home" should be everything else
2007-05-14T12:58:00.000Z	RAOF	wauwau	Maybe 5Gb, 512Mb, The rest for /home
