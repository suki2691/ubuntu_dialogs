2008-04-19T02:00:00.000Z	MrBill		On that note.... I do have some other (totally unrelated) questions..... I've got a CD player in my car that can play discs full of MP3s. When burning from Windows with Nero everything plays fine in the car, under Ubuntu I've isntalled gnomebaker, but for some reason my car stereo isn't recognizing the discs. I don't know if the session is being left open on them, or if the naming standard is different or what might be happening. Does anyone here
2008-04-19T02:00:00.000Z	MrBill		 have any experience with this, or advice to offer? (i'm all for installing some other burning software if gnomebaker is maybe not my best option)
2008-04-19T02:02:00.000Z	andi5	MrBill	have you tried brasero? (i think it can do that)
2008-04-19T02:04:00.000Z	MrBill	andi5	I haven't tried it yet... I'll give it a go
