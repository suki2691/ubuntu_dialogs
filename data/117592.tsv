2007-10-07T09:44:00.000Z	shannon_		Anyone experiencing this problem with compiz? You login, you get just a blank (black) screen and mouse pointer, nothing loads. User accounts with compiz disabled work fine, but I can't login to the compiz accounts to turn compiz off. Started happening after I downloaded upgrades today. Running Gutsy beta. Can't seem to find the bug in launchpad.

2007-10-07T09:47:00.000Z	shannon_	vasuvi	ok I'll try there
