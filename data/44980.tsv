2012-11-26T05:34:00.000Z	tavoe		I've been messing with amd graphics drivers for days, and I think I've finally hit a new low. I'm trying to find some alternative to wiping the whole partition and reinstalling, and am almost out of ideas

2012-11-26T05:38:00.000Z	almoxarife	tavoe	you can access a terminal? and have internet access?
