2005-10-17T13:06:00.000Z	antgel_		hi all. i'm deciding whether knoppix or ubuntu for my parents' machine.  from a live cd pov, they prefer knoppix due to kde.  however i understand that that will leave them with a debian unstable system - eek!  is it a plan to install ubuntu and then aptitude install kde?
2005-10-17T13:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	antgel_	heard of kubuntu ?
2005-10-17T13:07:00.000Z	antgel_	HappyFool	yep but don't have resources to burn cd here. is it not the same to aptitude install kde or kubuntu desktop?
2005-10-17T13:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	antgel_	aptitude install kubuntu-desktop , afaik
