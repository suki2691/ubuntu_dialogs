2006-05-31T05:42:00.000Z	nickrud	notos	depends on the context, but usually it's a bug in the package from my experience
2006-05-31T05:43:00.000Z	nickrud	notos	what package?
2006-05-31T05:44:00.000Z	nickrud	notos	erg. LVM is not one of my strong points :) I'd put the entire error message on the pastebin and give the link here. I've done that before and got good help
