2005-12-04T11:00:00.000Z	nEmiSH		is there a benifit during the install for Breezy to select Erase entire disk and use LVM?
2005-12-04T11:02:00.000Z	nEmiSH		Just not sure if there is a reason to encapsulate using LVM.. doesnt' make too much sense from what I can see but looking for some insight

2005-12-04T11:03:00.000Z	nEmiSH	cafuego	Grub can't boot? Grub doesn't like LVM? can't imagine that being a install option if it will barf on reboot
