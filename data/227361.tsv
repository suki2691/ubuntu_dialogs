2005-07-18T05:45:00.000Z	alxwind		can't install vmware, it asks me for directory with C header files that match my kernel, i thought it's usr/include/linux but was wrong (http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/544), can anyone help me to find out what is the directory?
2005-07-18T05:46:00.000Z	CookieNinja	alxwind	have u got the source headers installed ?
2005-07-18T06:08:00.000Z	CookieNinja	alxwind	did you look in /usr/src for then ?
