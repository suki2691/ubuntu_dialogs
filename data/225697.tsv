2005-08-04T07:23:00.000Z	Nate		I tried the Kubuntu amd64 live CD, but the computer locked right after loading the KDE background, can anyone help?
2005-08-04T07:25:00.000Z	Nate		It also happened with the Ubuntu amd64 LiveCD, right after the Ubuntu splash screen
2005-08-04T07:25:00.000Z	Nate		locked right up
2005-08-04T07:25:00.000Z	windex	Nate	i'm going to guess that a lot of people do not have amd64 machines to test with.
