2009-12-23T12:02:00.000Z	cdm101		Hi - how do I edit Grub 2's settings to make the menu delay shorter?
2009-12-23T12:03:00.000Z	dnivra	cdm101	set timeout in /boot/grub/grub.cfg. that's what you need i guess.
2009-12-23T12:04:00.000Z	cdm101	dnivra	there's a fairly giant "DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE" comment at the top... is there somewhere I'm supposed to edit?
2009-12-23T12:04:00.000Z	dnivra	cdm101	back up the grub.cfg JUST IN CASE. and there's a set timeout=10. Think that's what you need to edit.
