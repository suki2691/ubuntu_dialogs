2011-12-06T14:37:00.000Z	INodeNotHere		how can i run a ubuntu system upgrade from the terminal
2011-12-06T14:38:00.000Z	x	INodeNotHere	what do you mean system upgrade, just install the new updates? or upgrade whole distribution ?
2011-12-06T14:41:00.000Z	x	INodeNotHere	update current updates. or to a new ver of ubuntu!?!?
2011-12-06T14:52:00.000Z	x	INodeNotHere	doesn't dangling symlink mean wherever it's pointing is not there ?
