2011-12-06T18:59:00.000Z	urthmover		I have an image of a dev being able to compile a self contained app .... and the end user not having to install all the dependencies
2011-12-06T18:59:00.000Z	slakcphil	urthmover	maybe you could try to compile it yourself and then only install the *required* dpends
2011-12-06T19:03:00.000Z	urthmover	slakcphil	is there a ps switch that shows who initiated a process?
2011-12-06T19:03:00.000Z	urthmover	slakcphil	nvrmnd I'll rtfm the man
