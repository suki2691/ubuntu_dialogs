2011-08-20T10:26:00.000Z	n2i		What about Unity? Should I using Unity of Gnome3?
2011-08-20T10:27:00.000Z	lion42	n2i	using gnome3 on 11.04 is difficult to do and difficult to reverse. You're probably better off using unity or gnome-fallback.
2011-08-20T10:28:00.000Z	n2i	lion42	Oh, thanks! And what about 11.10?
2011-08-20T10:28:00.000Z	lion42	n2i	don't use 11.10 unless you have a reason to (aka, are a developer).
