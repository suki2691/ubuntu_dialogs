2012-08-26T18:28:00.000Z	Monkey		Please help. sudo command is not asking for password. Eg: sudo apt-get update
2012-08-26T18:29:00.000Z	cipherboy	Monkey	sudo -k?
2012-08-26T18:29:00.000Z	cipherboy	Monkey	`sudo -k` is the command, did you try that?
2012-08-26T18:37:00.000Z	Monkey	cipherboy	sudo -k shows nothing in root session. I think I'll have to switch to OtherUser.
