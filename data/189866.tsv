2008-02-04T17:35:00.000Z	Fubarovic		i want to rebuild the xenified kernel that's in ubuntu (linux-image-2.6.22-14-xen), but i can't find any Xen options in the config (make menuconfig)
2008-02-04T17:35:00.000Z	Fubarovic		how can i find out how the kernel was built for ubuntu?
2008-02-04T17:36:00.000Z	JediMaster	Fubarovic	do you mean the configuration?
2008-02-04T17:36:00.000Z	JediMaster	Fubarovic	look at /boot/config-2.6.whatever
