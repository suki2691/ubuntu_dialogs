2011-01-17T05:53:00.000Z	Kevin147		I'm having trouble with Pidgin. I won't be doing anything with it, and it randomly freezes. When I type it freezes, it just keeps freezing. How do I fix this?

2011-01-17T05:55:00.000Z	Kevin147	ilovefairuz	yeah its on, but I need it on in order for docky to work. It just started doing this a few days ago.
