2006-11-25T09:40:00.000Z	cherubiel	Curtman	how do you see this "hostname"
2006-11-25T09:41:00.000Z	cherubiel	Curtman	i mean, where do you see that?
2006-11-25T09:41:00.000Z	Curtman	cherubiel	At the login I see it, if I type 'hostname' I see it.  So I have to log in as root every time and set it manually.
