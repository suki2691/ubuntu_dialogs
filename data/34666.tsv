2010-04-03T04:30:00.000Z	ninjai_		hey guys im having some problems with the live cd booting on 1 computer.  I tried the 10.04 beta, and now im trying 9.10.  I get to the boot screen then after I hit enter to launch the live CD everything on the screen goes black, then the cd drive stops spinning and reading.  What can I do about this?

2010-04-03T04:32:00.000Z	ninjai_	daftykins	will using the alt cd to install solve this little issue?
2010-04-03T04:32:00.000Z	daftykins	ninjai_	not likely. if it's stopping reading from it, it could be a fair number of things. try the memory test and see if it does anything
