2008-03-11T01:53:00.000Z	ShadowAp3x		Hey, I'm just testing out the latest 8.04 release and I'm trying to use likewise's domainjoin-cli to connect to active directory but it's not working correctly. Whenever I try to join I get an error that says "Failed to contact DC when trying to synchronize local system clock! None of the domain controllers listed in DNS could be contacted or there are no DCs listed in DNS"
2008-03-11T01:53:00.000Z	ShadowAp3x		any insight?
2008-03-11T01:55:00.000Z	ShadowAp3x		ok... Requin... that doesn't really help me. There's not even any information about domainjoin-cli/gui on there
