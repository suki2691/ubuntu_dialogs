2008-01-31T21:24:00.000Z	ubuntunut		Hey guys. Is there a list of what processes CAN be disabled under a default Ubuntu install? I'm running from a laptop and hoping to cut down on power consumption

2008-01-31T21:26:00.000Z	ubuntunut	DRebellion	I was hoping for a more verbose output of what these services are so I don't just turn off services willy-nilly and bork my system
2008-01-31T21:28:00.000Z	DRebellion	ubuntunut	yeah, as ejer said, pretty much all of the processes on your linux box are there for a good reason.
