2005-11-19T16:29:00.000Z	phoghawk	felipe_	I don't know the intricacies of dpkg-divert. I'm sure you can find specifics somewhere... including "man dpkg-divert"
2005-11-19T16:29:00.000Z	felipe_	phoghawk	not sure what you mean. I intalled it to see if it would work with the nvidia drivers, but it didnt't and now I want to remove it
