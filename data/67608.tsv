2009-06-13T03:49:00.000Z	dahump		Noob here. In Ubuntu 9.04 I can see my windows network and my other pc's but when I double-click on them I get the error message "Unable to mount location - Failed to retrieve share list from server". I have been able to mount the location a few days ago, but I don't know what changed. Any advice?
