2009-11-13T02:15:00.000Z	ZenMasta	leonel_	you can use the dd command to clone a drive or make a backup

2009-11-13T02:19:00.000Z	ZenMasta	leonel_	i have never tried to clone a hard drive that isn't the same size. It will not hurt to try and see what happendeds. You always have your first hard drive as backup to try again :)
