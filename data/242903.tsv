2005-08-31T14:09:00.000Z	jasoncohen		what's the difference between flashplayer-mozilla and flashplugin-nonfree. I have flashplugin-nonfree installed and flash works. don't both packages provide flash?
2005-08-31T14:10:00.000Z	selinium	jasoncohen	nonfree is from Macromedia and is not open source. Flashplayer is open source
2005-08-31T14:11:00.000Z	jasoncohen	selinium	then why are they bothin multiverse?
2005-08-31T14:12:00.000Z	jasoncohen	selinium	if flashplayer-mozilla is open source it should be in main or universe- not multiverse
