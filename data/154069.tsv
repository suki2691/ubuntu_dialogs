2006-12-19T12:18:00.000Z	Gosha		i run ubuntu edge .. with xubuntu .. and i'm trying to run AOE2 ... i just tried it on ubuntu, with gnome. now problem... but now when i'm trying to start it with xubuntu it keeps prompting about some d3d settings or something .. is it xubuntu not running gnome being the problem? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37877/ <-- that's the output i get when running it from the terminal
2006-12-19T12:18:00.000Z	Gosha		no problem*

2006-12-19T12:19:00.000Z	gmbazillion	Gosha	I am guessing because D3D isn't supported in a unix platform.
