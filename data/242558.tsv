2005-09-13T16:32:00.000Z	medgno		how usable is breezy right now?
2005-09-13T16:32:00.000Z	medgno		so if I've run debian sid for around a year, I wouldn't have problems with the breakage, most likely?
2005-09-13T16:33:00.000Z	benplaut	medgno	you would probably be OK
2005-09-13T16:34:00.000Z	medgno	benplaut	thanks
