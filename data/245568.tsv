2006-07-14T08:53:00.000Z	sproingie	filemover	resizing a partition can take a while
2006-07-14T08:53:00.000Z	sproingie	filemover	otherwise it's nearly instantaneous
2006-07-14T08:54:00.000Z	sproingie	filemover	if you're resizing a partition with existing data, it effectively has to defrag that part first
