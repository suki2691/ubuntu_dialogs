2009-06-11T09:11:00.000Z	StevensUbuntuTr1	TheYeti	 I opened the tower.  How can I find out what type of mother board?  Is there a serial number or something?
2009-06-11T09:12:00.000Z	TheYeti	StevensUbuntuTr1	Yes, generally there is going to be a brand an type somewhere on the board.  Usually located near either the cpu socket or the ram.  Barring that there will be at least a serial number on it.   If that fails you can at least check what type of ram is already in there.
