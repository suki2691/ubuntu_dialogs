2005-09-11T12:43:00.000Z	RedTailhawk		first off ill state the obvious im a noob to linux. when i was installing ubuntu the grub failed and i continued with install and foolishly put the lilo on master boot record. now only ubuntu boots. is there anyway i could fix it so i can get back to windows and start from scratch again trying to dual boot? i guess im asking how to uninstall unbuntu, i think
2005-09-11T12:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	RedTailhawk	do you have a windows install cd ?
2005-09-11T12:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	RedTailhawk	boot with that and run 'fixmbr' -- should give you windows back
2005-09-11T12:45:00.000Z	RedTailhawk	HappyFool	ty ill try that
