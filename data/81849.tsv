2008-08-21T02:05:00.000Z	robelliott2125		Just wondering if someone can quickly answer another prob of mine...  When clicking on my shutdown menu, I used to be offered various shutdown options (restart, Hibernate, shutdown, etc) but now I'm only being offered Log Out, Lock Screen, Switch User and Hibernate.  Is there anything I can do to change it back?
2008-08-21T02:05:00.000Z	captainm	robelliott2125	did you by any change install another windowmanager?
2008-08-21T02:18:00.000Z	captainm	robelliott2125	what happens when you do 'killall kwin' (asuming you're in gnome).
2008-08-21T02:19:00.000Z	robelliott2125	captainm	 kwin: no process killed
