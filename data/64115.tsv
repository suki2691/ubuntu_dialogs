2012-09-28T16:53:00.000Z	atealtha		I've been using the official gnome3 PPA, suddenly today ubuntu kept telling me I had to do a system upgrade, and it took down all those packages with no replacements, what gives?
2012-09-28T16:53:00.000Z	atealtha		anyone else using gnome3 ppa ran into this?
2012-09-28T16:55:00.000Z	xangua	atealtha	you are already using gnome3 and you don't need a gnome3 ppa if what you want is install gnome-shell
2012-09-28T16:56:00.000Z	atealtha	xangua	it says it's already installed, but nothing on boot right now. it just has the ubuntu splash with the row of dots
