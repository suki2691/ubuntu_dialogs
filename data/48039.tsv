2009-09-20T23:27:00.000Z	whitedragon		Is there a separate IRC for Ubuntu Kernel?
2009-09-20T23:28:00.000Z	Hans_Henrik	whitedragon	isnt that same as the general "linux kernel"? :p
2009-09-20T23:30:00.000Z	Hans_Henrik	whitedragon	maybe http://kernelnewbies.org/ is something for you?  they talk about the linux kernel, witch im fairly certain of, is the kernel ubuntu uses (not 100% sure if they use a slightly modified kernel or not, but should be 99% the same)
