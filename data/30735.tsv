2010-06-04T06:28:00.000Z	Sammus		Hey, I went to download the latest ubuntu, and was wondering why 64-bit is not recommended for regular usage?
2010-06-04T06:29:00.000Z	acerimmer	Sammus	primary benefits of 64 bit apply if you have >4 gig of ram
2010-06-04T06:30:00.000Z	Sammus	acerimmer	I am aware if this, but what are the drawbacks which make them say it's not recommended?
2010-06-04T06:31:00.000Z	acerimmer	Sammus	i THINK there are more 32 bit apps than 64.  also not all 32 have been packaged for 64?
