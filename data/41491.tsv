2009-12-09T17:17:00.000Z	Listerthrawn	sponzor	 Should do.  I personally wouldn't run a Database on RAID 5 though
2009-12-09T17:19:00.000Z	sponzor	Listerthrawn	where should i run it?
2009-12-09T17:26:00.000Z	Listerthrawn	sponzor	RAID 1+0 would be better for DB, but it depends how much space you require
