Very noticable (and annoying) when moving the mouse or running something like glxgears.  But glxgears reports a frame rate that's consistent with what I got before the upgrade.
2008-05-30T19:58:00.000Z	jonlanglois		Any thoughts on how to investigate?
2008-05-30T19:59:00.000Z	Alsar	jonlanglois	are you using kubuntu?
