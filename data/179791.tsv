2009-12-09T02:20:00.000Z	jofo`		I'm on an old tower on which I still have an Ubuntu Hardy Heron. The update manager says my system is up-to-date. It does not propose the upgrade to Intrepid Ibex.
2009-12-09T02:20:00.000Z	jofo`		On my laptop, I was able to upgrade from Intrepid to Jaunty, then to Karmic, but I don't see what I could do with my Hardy.
