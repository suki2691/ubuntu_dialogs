2010-07-05T08:07:00.000Z	Smooch	Roasted	Whats the problem?
2010-07-05T08:07:00.000Z	Roasted		at one point on my laptop, I had a monitor connected to it with dual screen. I no longer have the monitor connected, yet about 50% of the time I boot up, it still thinks its connected cause windows often launch on that window. Its an intel card. What can I do? It gets VERY old booting up to find my login screen is gone because its on the 2nd monitor that doesnt exist.
