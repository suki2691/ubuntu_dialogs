2007-02-18T06:57:00.000Z	Flubs		can anyone tell me where php5-dev downloads to when I download it from synaptic?
2007-02-18T06:57:00.000Z	LjL	Flubs	the .deb package itself, or the files it contains?
2007-02-18T06:58:00.000Z	LjL	Flubs	the package is in /var/cache/apt/archives
2007-02-18T06:58:00.000Z	LjL	Flubs	the files are listed if you do "dpkg -L php5-dev"
