2007-11-29T23:04:00.000Z	maek		is there something like a "network profile" where I can have work and home and wireless configured? I cant seem to find a quick way of changing my network settings. at work im on a fixed ip and at home im on dhcp and its a bit of a hassle to make all the changes everytime. thanks.
