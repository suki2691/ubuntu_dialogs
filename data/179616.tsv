2006-09-01T14:29:00.000Z	jrib	iqon	which key?
2006-09-01T14:30:00.000Z	jrib	iqon	hmm that should just work, I use that myself to lock the screen.  What does it get set as when you try?
2006-09-01T14:30:00.000Z	iqon	jrib	i'm trying to set lock screen back to it, i had changed the lock screen shortcut
