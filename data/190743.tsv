2009-02-05T06:00:00.000Z	furythor		can anyone say, why in wine (including winecfg) I have text almost unreadable
2009-02-05T06:02:00.000Z	furythor		I place my money guessing that it is something else, but what. I really would like to know
2009-02-05T06:03:00.000Z	furythor		anyhow is there other way to see wine version that that "about" tab in winecfg ?
