2011-04-10T00:42:00.000Z	rodhash		Guys .. Any idea what FS has the major I/O in Ubuntu? /var maybe?
2011-04-10T00:43:00.000Z	mkanyicy	rodhash	why does that matter?
2011-04-10T00:44:00.000Z	rodhash	mkanyicy	Because I'm creating stripped FS but I'll use only on specific ones
2011-04-10T00:44:00.000Z	mkanyicy	rodhash	by FS you mean filesystem?
