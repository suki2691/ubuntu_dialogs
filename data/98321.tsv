2008-03-06T00:48:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock		Hi, I'm looking to purchase a laptop (incidentally, my first one) and am looking for something that will work well with ubuntu / kubuntu. I would appreciate any advice on how best to choose one.
2008-03-06T00:49:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock		I'd obviously not like to pay for a copy of Windows Vista while doing so either.
2008-03-06T00:49:00.000Z	kjnox	Captain_Haddock	u can download vista by bittorrent and use the paradox crack
2008-03-06T00:49:00.000Z	Captain_Haddock	kjnox	um I don't want vista
