2007-10-31T03:10:00.000Z	EvilAIM		Hey, is there a way to load IRSSI via menu?
2007-10-31T03:10:00.000Z	EvilAIM		or do I have to run it via virtual console?
2007-10-31T03:10:00.000Z	twoshadetod	EvilAIM	you could probably make a launcher for it
2007-10-31T03:10:00.000Z	twoshadetod	EvilAIM	I'm sure you can do the same by adding it ot the menu manually
