2004-11-18T16:09:00.000Z	paulproteus	jonex	You should be able to copy it into /usr/share/fonts.
2004-11-18T16:09:00.000Z	paulproteus		But even better would be to use the "msttcorefonts" package in Synaptic, which will install that (and a few other MS fonts) for you.
2004-11-18T16:15:00.000Z	jonex	paulproteus	hmm I can't find any "msttcorefonts" when searching :/
