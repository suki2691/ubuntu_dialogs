2005-03-02T07:54:00.000Z	sgteich		How do I get my desktop resolution to 1600X1200? I've added that to my XF86Config-4 file, restarted gnome.  Have I missed anything?

2005-03-02T07:56:00.000Z	sgteich	ebone	I've tried that - is there a way to see what resolution and color depth I'm running at from the command line?
