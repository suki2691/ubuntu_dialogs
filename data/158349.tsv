2008-02-11T03:58:00.000Z	howdoudo		I have compiled and installed a program. Now a new version has come out. How do I remove the last version or dont I need to?
2008-02-11T03:58:00.000Z	Slart	howdoudo	depends on what program it is.. some apps have to be removed before the new one is installed
2008-02-20T17:04:00.000Z	Slart	howdoudo	lsb_release -a
2008-02-20T17:05:00.000Z	Slart	howdoudo	or kernel version with "uname -a"
