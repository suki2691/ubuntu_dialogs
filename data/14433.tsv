2011-05-10T09:44:00.000Z	ahriman		I'm still using 10.10 but I'd like to get rid of the stupid volume control popups. I'm using a plain 104-us keyboard and a 5 button USB mouse. I can't seem to get the volume popup that appears at random to go away, or find a button to disable. Please help :(

2011-05-10T09:46:00.000Z	ahriman	celthunder	GhostWolf: top right where all the silly popups appear for notification on mail and IM, the same dialog independent of the taskbar will sometimes have volume info. It will scroll by itself, sit there for hours, etc
