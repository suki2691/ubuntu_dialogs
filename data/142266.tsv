2008-05-02T21:29:00.000Z	GG2		Yesterday I was trying Ubunto installed via Wubi and the power went down. Now I can't boot with it. It just brings the command line terminal instead of login user screen
2008-05-02T21:30:00.000Z	GG2		Yes insstall finished fine and it was working fine till power went down

2008-05-02T21:30:00.000Z	evand	GG2	unless, as others have asked, you were in the middle of the install.
