2010-09-06T01:37:00.000Z	alejandro1		I have some 32 bit application in 64 bit ubuntu that looks for the libraries in the wrong path /usr/lib instead of /usr/lib32
2010-09-06T01:37:00.000Z	ikonia	alejandro1	 you shouldn't be using 32bit applications on 64bit
2010-09-06T01:38:00.000Z	ikonia	alejandro1	?
2010-09-06T01:38:00.000Z	ikonia	alejandro1	then you need to contact adobe as they have hardcoded the lib paths
