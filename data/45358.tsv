2009-10-21T00:03:00.000Z	FCalderon	ender	are you trying to run a windows install CD from ubuntu?
2009-10-21T00:04:00.000Z	FCalderon	ender	the windows install is completely independent of ubuntu, therefore if you're having problems running the installer, maybe it's just that your hard disk is failing
