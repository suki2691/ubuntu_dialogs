2010-01-17T05:09:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss		Hey, I'm going to need a little help here. I'm a complete Linux novice, however I have been running Linux Ubuntu on a spare partition for a couple of years. Today I booted into Linux, and found that the kernel started in low graphics mode. This hasn't happened before. Can anybody help?
