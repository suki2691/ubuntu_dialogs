2007-09-09T11:20:00.000Z	nickrud	gh0sty2k	log into the other machine, and use the regular commands
2007-09-09T11:37:00.000Z	nickrud	gh0sty2k	sometimes the only thing to do is get out the big hammer:  kill -9 pid
2007-09-09T12:44:00.000Z	nickrud	gh0sty2k	sudo fdisk -l shows all the disks and partitions ;  mount  will show what's mounted
