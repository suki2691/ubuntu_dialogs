2009-09-13T21:43:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg		Hi , i want to write a backup script that will run before shutdown. so i created a test script which creates a new file on Desktop.
2009-09-13T21:43:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg		I put this script in /etc/init.d and i created a symbolic link to the script in /etc/rc0.d .
2009-09-13T21:43:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg		the name of the script in /etc/init.d is ranytest and the symbolic link in /etc/rc0.d is K02ranytest .It seems that the script isnt running cuz i cant see the file on the Desktop. What am i doing wrong? thanks
