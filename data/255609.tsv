2007-08-08T16:06:00.000Z	IndyLucian		I am trying to use this command 'sudo apt-get install -d --force-yes libdvdread3' to download a package that is already installed on my computer because i need to transport it to a computer that does NOT have this package. It keeps telling me i already have this package and wont download. How do I download this package?
