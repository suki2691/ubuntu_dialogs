2009-03-25T21:31:00.000Z	Dramawulf	SandGorgon	apvlv! Super light and with all the input quirks you know and love using Vim. ;)
2009-03-25T21:31:00.000Z	SandGorgon	Dramawulf	is there a repo?
2009-03-25T21:32:00.000Z	Dramawulf	SandGorgon	Try sudo apt-get install apvlv. If that doesn't work, then there probably isn't.
