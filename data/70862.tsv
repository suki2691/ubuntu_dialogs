2008-12-22T23:54:00.000Z	donavan_	RobotCow	yeah I know you can do it that way but when I try to open something from the firefox download window (opening it from the net rather than saving to disc first) it always brings up totem which has yet to play anything I have tried with it
2008-12-22T23:55:00.000Z	RobotCow	donavan_	send me a link so i can see if mine opens with totem
2008-12-22T23:56:00.000Z	donavan_	RobotCow	... That wont matter... I have tried mp3s and dvds and just about everything else I think my installation of totem is screwed but I havent been able to get it working
