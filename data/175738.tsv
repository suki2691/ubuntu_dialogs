2007-06-21T10:15:00.000Z	dyrne	rope	it doesnt take up much space if you intend to keep gnome
2007-06-21T10:15:00.000Z	rope	dyrne	No, i want to install fluxbox
2007-06-21T10:16:00.000Z	dyrne	rope	id remove some of the gtk libs but thatll effect other apps so do that if you only want bas ubuntu and xserver and fonts and fluxbox. the other apps you might have to reinstall. not sure otherwise
