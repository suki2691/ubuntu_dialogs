2009-08-14T18:55:00.000Z	bullgard		[Ubuntu 9.04] My Pidgin appears after each reboot anew although I exited it before. What should I do so that it does not open automatically at every reboot?
2009-08-14T18:56:00.000Z	Pharsalus	bullgard	remove it from menu>prefernces>startup Applications
2009-08-14T18:56:00.000Z	Pharsalus		Sorry, menu>system>pref... etc
2009-08-14T18:59:00.000Z	bullgard	Pharsalus	There is no Pidgin entry in System > Preferences > Startup Applications > (Startup Applications Preferences).
