2006-06-18T13:04:00.000Z	null		Hello. I just destroyed my MBR by installing Windows. Now I booted up with the LiveCD, rerun grub and installed it to the mbr... after rebooting I get the grub shell. When I type 'configfile /grub/menu.lst' it boots Ubuntu... Why doesn't it use the menu.lst by default?

2006-06-18T13:05:00.000Z	ardchoille	null	did you type /grub/menu.lst or /boot/grub/menu.lst (notice the diff paths) ?
2006-06-18T13:06:00.000Z	ardchoille	null	was menu.lst not where it should have been?
