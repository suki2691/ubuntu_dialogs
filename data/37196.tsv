2010-02-16T02:16:00.000Z	cmpsalvestrini	IHATERIIDO	Probably just general X weirdness, I have never encountered problems with X unless it's either buggy or misconfigured.
2010-02-16T02:18:00.000Z	IHATERIIDO	cmpsalvestrini	Thanks, but this has been happening since Ubuntu 8.*. Seems a bit ridiculous at this point if you know what I mean.
2010-02-16T02:19:00.000Z	IHATERIIDO	cmpsalvestrini	I've even disabled Compiz and proprietary drives just to make sure it's not those messing up the works.
