2010-05-22T18:32:00.000Z	orion_X11		I have dual boot notebook and when I am in windows i'd like to acesses linux files with explore2fs, but my ubuntu has got raiserfs with is not supported by explore2fs. So, is it possible to change my fs from raiserfs to ext4 without losing my data mainly my /home with gparted?
