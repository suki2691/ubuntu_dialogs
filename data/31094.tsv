2012-06-23T08:08:00.000Z	ClientAlive		my screen resolution in 12.04 is too small (way too small). What's the best way of dealing with that? (Also, there are two monitors on the machine).
2012-06-23T08:08:00.000Z	Pecker	ClientAlive	type display in launcher
2012-06-23T08:11:00.000Z	Pecker	ClientAlive	also go in terminal and type in "lspci -nn | grep 'VGA'
2012-06-23T08:26:00.000Z	Pecker	ClientAlive	graphics drivers?
