2006-11-18T10:41:00.000Z	mlalkaka		Will Fiesty be including Java now that it is open-sourced? If so, what parts? From what I can understand, only javac and the hotspot vm have been open-sourced -- not the run-time environment. is this correct?
2006-11-18T10:41:00.000Z	kitche	mlalkaka	hotspot vm is the run-time it's jsut missing the classpaths right now
2006-11-18T10:42:00.000Z	mlalkaka	kitche	oh. so when one refers to the JRE (java run-time environment), they are refering to the hotspot vm?
2006-11-18T10:44:00.000Z	kitche	mlalkaka	the vm is the run-time
