2007-02-10T17:34:00.000Z	denardo		Hi, folks. I've run out of space on / . Any ideas what do cull? Might I have old .debs piling up somewhere?
2007-02-10T17:35:00.000Z	Flannel	denardo	you only have one partition? or what isn't on /?
2007-02-10T17:35:00.000Z	denardo	Flannel	/home is on its own partition.
2007-02-10T17:38:00.000Z	Flannel	denardo	no standard reason not to autoclean, no.
