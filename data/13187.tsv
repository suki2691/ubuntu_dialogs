2012-11-18T02:02:00.000Z	CorvusCorax		Hi. Ubuntu keeps greeting me after everz restart about a "crash" it wants to "report". However I think its the same crash every time somewhere down in the logs. how can I make it not bother me about the same crash again and again?
2012-11-18T02:03:00.000Z	CorvusCorax		I had such a thing earlier with an Xserver segfault where I solved it by deleting the old Xorg.log
2012-11-18T02:03:00.000Z	escott_	CorvusCorax	have you tried reporting it?
2012-11-18T02:03:00.000Z	escott_	CorvusCorax	alternately just delete all the logs in /var/log
