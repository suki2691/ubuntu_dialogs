2005-10-13T11:36:00.000Z	N6REJ		I got a question guys... I'm installing breezy on my sons machine and it has a belkin 54G wireless nic.  It doesn't see the nic but DOES see what it believes is a firewire device.  Which of course it isn't.... a how-to says I need ndiswrapper... do I ignore the nic for now, finish the install or what?
