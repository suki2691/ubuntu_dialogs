2009-02-06T18:45:00.000Z	redspike		Hi, i canot save or open files from a windows share with openoffice in ubuntu 8.10,  anyone know what the problem can be?  it works fine with gedit and other apps
2009-02-06T18:45:00.000Z	blizzle_	redspike	Could be that OpenOffice doesn't like network shares..
2009-02-06T18:45:00.000Z	redspike	blizzle_	is there any work around ?
2009-02-06T18:46:00.000Z	blizzle_	redspike	Sure, save the file locally and then copy across..
