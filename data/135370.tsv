2009-01-04T11:27:00.000Z	tristanmike		how can I get the old alsamixer instead of the new pulse audio one via the terminal ?
2009-01-04T11:27:00.000Z	tristanmike		I only get one option under Pulse Audio, but I want to make other changes ?
2009-01-04T11:28:00.000Z	ziroday	tristanmike	there is a command line version called alsamixer
2009-01-04T11:28:00.000Z	tristanmike	ziroday	right, but when I use it, I get Pulse Audio with one option, but I want the "old" alsamixer
