2011-08-28T12:19:00.000Z	Yakooza		when trying to boot i get an error "Unable to boot operating system"
2011-08-28T12:20:00.000Z	Yakooza		I think this may be the Win xp setup though, how can I change the active partition in Ubuntu?
2011-08-28T12:22:00.000Z	urlin2u	Yakooza	ycan you give some back info on the problem, like installation orders and the actual ubuntu your using.
