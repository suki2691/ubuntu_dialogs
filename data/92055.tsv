2008-05-05T03:29:00.000Z	norty		Question: I just upgraded from ubuntu 7.10 to 8.01 and got firefox 3 beta 5, for some reason it crashes/closes when I visit some website, is there a fix for this?
2008-05-05T03:30:00.000Z	luser_	norty	what websites? are they using some special plugins? FF3b5 never crashes for me
2008-05-05T03:31:00.000Z	norty	luser_	i can't find a consistent set of website it crashes for, it might be due to some ads or something
