2009-10-27T07:05:00.000Z	Psinetic		I'm running ubuntu 9.04. I have had aMSN installed for months now without ever having a problem. Now everytime I open aMSN it just closes on me with no warning. I ran it with terminal and this is the error I recieved: http://pastebin.com/m40520895
2009-10-27T07:05:00.000Z	Psinetic		anyone know about this problem?
