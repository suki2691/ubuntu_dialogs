2012-05-08T06:58:00.000Z	enyawix		how can pulse be removed? I have hardware mixing making it useless
2012-05-08T06:59:00.000Z	zykotic10	enyawix	expect gnome sound to stop working if you do.
2012-05-08T07:00:00.000Z	enyawix	zykotic10	is gnome sound the only thing that would have to recompiled with sensible defaults?
2012-05-08T07:01:00.000Z	zykotic10	enyawix	pulse has some great features... i'm adding you to /ignore
