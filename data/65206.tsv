2009-03-21T05:12:00.000Z	jlink		I'm having a terrible time getting Ubuntu installed. Anyone have any experience?
2009-03-21T05:12:00.000Z	clsmith	jlink	You are in #ubuntu. I assume we do have experience of installing Ubuntu. ;)
2009-03-21T05:19:00.000Z	clsmith	jlink	What are you having a problem with? Booting without those options?
2009-03-21T05:20:00.000Z	jlink	clsmith	Hah, maybe I should reexplain the whole thing. I just built this new AMD64 computer. I downloaded and burnt the AMD64 8.10 Desktop iso. When I try to boot or install from the CD, it freezes during the Ubuntu splash screen. It also freezes when doing these things from my 32bit 8.10 CD, and that CD worked fine when installing it on this laptop.
