2007-08-18T06:38:00.000Z	Anlar		it's pure dns
2007-08-18T06:39:00.000Z	kauer	Anlar	Are you *sure* about that? That would break a zillion home networks where no DNS is in operation. And it would be a major first for Microsoft to not be backward compatible with netbios name resolution...
2007-08-18T06:40:00.000Z	Anlar	kauer	they will just fall back to netbios in a dire situation, but the primary operation mode is resolving via dns
