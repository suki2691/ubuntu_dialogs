2011-03-21T06:12:00.000Z	ohsix	vicsar	you can skip the imaging and install it on a physical drive if you want
2011-03-21T06:12:00.000Z	ohsix	vicsar	windows won't like that, but it can be done
2011-03-21T06:14:00.000Z	vicsar	ohsix	I know. I just donÂ´t have the other pc yet and wanted to avoid the re-install hassle
