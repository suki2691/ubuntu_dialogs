2010-08-01T01:48:00.000Z	mcnellis		How can I create a link that will go to the actual link's final path?
2010-08-01T01:49:00.000Z	mcnellis		e.g. I have my ~/Documents folder link to ~/Dropbox/Documents but I'd like ~/Documents to essentially redirect to ~/Dropbox/Documents (so my right click menu has the Dropbox features)

2010-08-01T01:55:00.000Z	mcnellis	cablop	hard link not allowed for a directory it seems. ilovefairuz so it's impossible to get the original path?
