2008-09-30T19:01:00.000Z	AngryElf		how can I restart my panels? -- one of them is all white :/

2008-09-30T19:02:00.000Z	LjL	AngryElf	i guess "killall gnome-panel" alone will do, it should restart automatically
2008-09-30T19:03:00.000Z	LjL	AngryElf	well, you'll just have to put any custom applets back into position
