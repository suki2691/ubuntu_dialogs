2007-10-22T05:00:00.000Z	Sgt_Shankers		does it just have packages pre downloaded onto the dvd or something?
2007-10-22T05:00:00.000Z	Pelo	Sgt_Shankers	 dvd has more packages on in and both installers,  so you donT, need to get as many packages online after youi installed
2007-10-22T05:07:00.000Z	Pelo	Sgt_Shankers	you can edit ~/.wine/user.reg
