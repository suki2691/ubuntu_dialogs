2010-09-13T22:41:00.000Z	coty91		Does anyone know how I would go about running dual monitors, one from my Nvidia GTX 260 card and the other from my Onboard Radeon HD 3200?

2010-09-13T22:44:00.000Z	coty91	DexterF	I need 2 Xservers running?
2010-09-13T22:44:00.000Z	DexterF	coty91	yes. you have two different GPUs, so you can't make one Xserver talk to both
