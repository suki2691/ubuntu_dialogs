2005-10-11T15:28:00.000Z	pawel		I'm running breezy and can't get rid of that bloody notice from update-notifier that I need to restart the computer because of the new kernel. I have restarted my computer, few times, but the bulb and notice keeps appearing.
2005-10-11T15:29:00.000Z	pawel		I even reinstalled update-notifier, but the same thing happens.
2005-10-11T15:29:00.000Z	pawel		any clues?
2005-10-11T15:29:00.000Z	[LethAL] 	pawel	You need to boot into the new kernel, I take it you're not using grub?
