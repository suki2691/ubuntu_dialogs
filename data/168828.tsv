2006-09-13T10:29:00.000Z	IceTox		Hey guys. I changed hostname using "hostname <new>" and every time I'm using sudo at any tasks now, I'm getting this message "sudo: unable to lookup rebecca via gethostbyname()"
2006-09-13T10:29:00.000Z	IceTox		Anyone knows what's wrong and how to solve it?
2006-09-13T10:29:00.000Z	ChaosFan	IceTox	did you reboot after changing your hostname?
2006-09-13T10:30:00.000Z	IceTox	ChaosFan	yeah, I did restart
