2006-12-10T15:26:00.000Z	Zaggynl		Hi, when I start amarok, 3 processes pop up, 1x amarok and 2x amarokapp, and they use a whopping 130MB together, is this normal?
2006-12-10T06:28:00.000Z	Zaggynl		Anyone knows how I get the latest amarok on dapper?
2006-12-10T06:28:00.000Z	Enselic	Zaggynl	Compile it?
