2006-04-04T16:17:00.000Z	Drac[Server] 	zerokarmaleft	really? Alright. The drive isn't clean, though.
2006-04-04T16:18:00.000Z	Drac[Server] 	zerokarmaleft	will I need to format the drive somehow, first?
2006-04-04T16:29:00.000Z	Drac[Server] 	zerokarmaleft	OH. Didn't see that part. Um.... Yeah. I need to copy the master boot record and stuff... What other ways can I do this?
