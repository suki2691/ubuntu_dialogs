2010-09-09T19:28:00.000Z	boywonder		hi,can anyone please give me a pointer onto how to run ubuntu from a usb stick( as an installed os)?
2010-09-09T19:29:00.000Z	SmallR2002	boywonder	look into unetbootin
2010-09-09T19:31:00.000Z	SmallR2002	boywonder	look into debootstrap then
2010-09-09T19:31:00.000Z	SmallR2002	boywonder	be careful with grub though
