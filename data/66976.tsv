2009-10-03T22:51:00.000Z	janisozaur	outoftime	m0r0n i've never experienced that, although i have uploaded images to imageshack
2009-10-03T22:51:00.000Z	janisozaur	outoftime	is it possible that it's because i use x64?
2009-10-03T22:52:00.000Z	outoftime	janisozaur	no idea - afaik it's the code in the linux flash player itself. it totally blocks the process on uploads.
