2011-01-20T16:38:00.000Z	knoppies		I want to install GRUB onto a USB Flash drive to boot a linux partition that I have on my HDD (long story short, I want to keep my HDD MBR for winXP, so if I unplug the USB, it boots winXP)
2011-01-20T16:39:00.000Z	Scott`	knoppies	you can boot winxp with grub
2011-01-20T16:39:00.000Z	Scott`		GRUB boots 10.10 and windows 7 for me
2011-01-20T16:40:00.000Z	knoppies	Scott`	I know, but on this particular system, when I installed ubuntu with GRUB it failed to see the winXP, it might have something to do with the fact that the winXP is actually a clone image from another HDD that I just moved across.
