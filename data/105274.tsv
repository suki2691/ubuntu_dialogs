2012-03-10T10:12:00.000Z	kenro		Help? When trying to install gkrellm in 11, it wants to remove my entire gnome dte?! Isn't gkrellm 'gnome-philic'?
2012-03-10T10:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kenro	are there any bugs reported?
2012-03-10T10:15:00.000Z	kenro	ActionParsnip	 Actually, never thought it could be a bug, as I've had repo configure problems as well...
2012-03-10T10:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kenro	can you give the output of:  apt-cache policy gkrellm; lsb_release -a    thanks
