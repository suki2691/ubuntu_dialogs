If you can ping a domain and get a response back but not connect to any web site or establish any other kind of connection sounds like something is wrong firewall or routing wise

2007-10-07T15:32:00.000Z	thedonvaughn	Sarah___	ok, the alternative is to continue to beg for help in the channel.  I'm offering help.  Good luck.
