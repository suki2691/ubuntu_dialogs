2008-03-05T06:36:00.000Z	Kris07		Hello, everyone.
2008-03-05T06:37:00.000Z	Kris07		I'm having a problem with my Compiz-Fusion.
2008-03-05T06:39:00.000Z	Kris07		I wanted to try out an Emerald theme that I just downloaded, so I ran Compiz in the terminal. It works fine, but I can't control Compiz at all. And when I close the terminal out, it takes Compiz and my window borders.
