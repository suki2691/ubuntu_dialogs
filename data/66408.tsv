2009-07-19T02:02:00.000Z	Bob_Dole		Even fairly recent cards like the Radeon X1600
2009-07-19T02:02:00.000Z	mzz	Bob_Dole	fortunately newer versions of the open driver are pretty good
2009-07-19T02:03:00.000Z	mzz	Bob_Dole	I don't know how large the range of cards is that really doesn't work well with the open driver and is no longer supported by the closed one
