2009-06-15T21:07:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong		dajhorn;justin; i am doing a project for a local OS called eswecha. So i have to do an User Interface (UI) using tasksel that it can download/install important packages for specific users
2009-06-15T21:08:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong		dajhorn; this happens when the user installs the OS...
2009-06-15T21:08:00.000Z	swivels	PerryArmstrong	you are trying to build a front-end to tasksel then?
2009-06-15T21:09:00.000Z	swivels	PerryArmstrong	if you are trying to add options to tasksel so people can choose a different UI, you'd have to get the tasksel source and go from there.
