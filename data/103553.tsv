2010-05-06T01:55:00.000Z	ahmose		 hey all, quick question on update manager....
2010-05-06T01:56:00.000Z	ahmose		after a new release [like 10.04]... Should I have both the "recomended updates, and security updates checked off? or is it ok to still just have it to get security updates?
2010-05-06T01:56:00.000Z	ahmose		or does a new release NEED the recomened updates as well?
2010-05-06T01:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ahmose	yes it will need updates
