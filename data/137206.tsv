2007-04-22T05:52:00.000Z	Cam30077	fenrig	 i've burned the cd twice already, and checked it using the option on the splash screen.  It says its ok
2007-04-22T05:54:00.000Z	Cam30077	fenrig	a friend told me about an ubuntu partitioner thats seperate. Do you know where i can get it from.   Or will it be ok using the one from a win98 boot floppy?
