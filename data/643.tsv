2012-10-24T13:49:00.000Z	soc42	lantizia	i guess you are trying to install a network scanner i.e. have one scanner at a usb port used for the server and shared this device over ethernet to other clients on the lan

2012-10-24T13:50:00.000Z	lantizia	soc42	the SANE compatibility database lists some types of connectivity between SANE and the Scanner as "USB Ethernet" instead of "USB"
