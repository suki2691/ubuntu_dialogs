2012-09-07T23:29:00.000Z	Ihsan_		Hello, I'm trying to encrypt my crypted partition (With bitlocker from Windows 7) with dislocker. Im now trying to execute the command: sudo dislocker-file -V encrypted bitlocker -p563200-557084-108284-218900-019151-415437-694144-239976 --decrypted.ntfs, but it says that 'dislocker-file: command not found.. What do I need to do?
