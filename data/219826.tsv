2006-07-12T06:44:00.000Z	Flannel	SelfHarm	the server install on the alternate CD is just ubuntu-base (with a ssh server) the server ISO has some specialized kernels, as well as some additional install options (pre-installed LAMP, for instance)
2006-07-12T06:44:00.000Z	Flannel	SelfHarm	but, if you install ANY server version, you can just apt-get to a full desktop
2006-07-12T06:49:00.000Z	Flannel	SelfHarm	you have another package manager open, it sounds like.
