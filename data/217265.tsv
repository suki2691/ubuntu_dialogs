2006-06-09T13:03:00.000Z	Whyvas	webwolf_27	but it's slower when he clicks on the menus, so obviously it is a slow operating system....
2006-06-09T13:05:00.000Z	webwolf_27	Whyvas	I suspect he meens boot speed
2006-06-09T13:06:00.000Z	Whyvas	webwolf_27	, he is basing his speed comparisons on the speed that the menu comes up when he clicks on applications vs clicking on start in windows...
