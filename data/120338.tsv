2011-08-02T17:37:00.000Z	Ludite		I have an NSLU2 running lenny 5.0 i use rsync via ssh to backup my home directory to it.  I  have been using passwordless ssh successfully to backup to the server but i managed to break the process. now when the scripot executes its asking for a password and i'm not sure how to fixz this.
