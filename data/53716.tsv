2010-08-03T13:52:00.000Z	padi999		My ubuntu root dir / is quite full, how can I make space? I mean: Which files can safely be deleted? I guess there might for example be some software packages that got deleted but not purged.
2010-08-03T13:52:00.000Z	jpds	padi999	sudo apt-get clean
2010-08-03T13:54:00.000Z	padi999	jpds	that saved me 3MB .. well, not a whole bunch :)
