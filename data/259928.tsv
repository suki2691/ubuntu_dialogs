2007-09-29T16:35:00.000Z	Poul|Raider		anyone got a moment to guide me to enable syntax highlighting in vim?
2007-09-29T16:35:00.000Z	regeya	Poul|Raider	could you be more specific?  please?  anything in particular you're trying to do?  (I'm a novice with vim, btw, so be gentle :-)
2007-09-29T16:37:00.000Z	regeya	Poul|Raider	a lot of syntax highlighting packages you'll find on vim.org just need to either be loaded and sourced in vim (if it's a vimball) or need to be untarred into ~/.vim
2007-09-29T16:37:00.000Z	regeya	Poul|Raider	if you're writing highlighting code...I hope to be that helpful to others someday :->
