2007-12-26T01:31:00.000Z	sparr	MasterShrek	yes
2007-12-26T01:32:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sparr	those are packages that are techincally from a different release, "backported" to the one you are running, that may be where you are running into these issues...
2007-12-26T01:32:00.000Z	sparr	MasterShrek	it is not.  thanks though
