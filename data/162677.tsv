2007-04-27T12:06:00.000Z	pugz		Hi! I'm new to Ubuntu and I'm having trouble in installing new firefox, When I type firefox in Console, it tells me that firefox is not installed. What to do?
2007-04-27T12:07:00.000Z	pugz		I followed the instructions on mozillas homepage
2007-04-27T12:08:00.000Z	pugz		that "sudo apt" doesn't work
