2008-09-12T18:16:00.000Z	smm289		isnt that the same as using the remove feature in Synaptic
2008-09-12T18:17:00.000Z	smm289		any idea what ubuntu-desktop is and if I allow it to be removed will I no longer have a desktop
2008-09-12T18:18:00.000Z	bazhang	smm289	that is a metapackage it is safe to remove
