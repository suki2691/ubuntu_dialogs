2010-11-13T01:43:00.000Z	dobreira		Hey everyone, quick, vague question - is there anything I should worry about when installing ubuntu on a 1998 imac?
2010-11-13T01:44:00.000Z	shebang_wafflesa	dobreira	maybe, check the project page (assuming that there is one)
2010-11-13T01:45:00.000Z	shebang_wafflesa	dobreira	yeah, Ubuntu on an olde iMac would CREEP
2010-11-13T01:47:00.000Z	shebang_wafflesa	dobreira	you could try installing netbsd, debian, slackware, etc. Just expect to do alot of configring yourself
