2007-09-18T08:20:00.000Z	pac1		I've got a disk with 15 partitions on it but I don't see the 15th partiton in  ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid
2007-09-18T08:21:00.000Z	pac1		There's definitely a file system on /dev/sda15
2007-09-18T08:21:00.000Z	pac1		I can mount sda15 using /dev/sda15, but I can't seem to find its UUID.
