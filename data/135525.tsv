2007-05-03T12:41:00.000Z	yagami_		someone please help? :( has anyone tried installing the old nvidia-glx drivers from nvidia to get beryl running on cards that are no longer supported by nvidia-glx-drivers since feisty?

2007-05-03T12:42:00.000Z	yagami_	neverblue	i know how to get that done- but problem is beryl won't work, if i install nvidia-glx-drivers. the latest proprietary drivers don't support the card i am using anymore
