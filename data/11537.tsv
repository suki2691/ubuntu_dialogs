2012-02-29T14:10:00.000Z	daan4711		Hi, I have got a question: How can I set up my usb-keyboard to have another keyboard-layout than my laptop-built-in-keyboard. I figured something out using xorg.conf, but this does only work when I start u with my usb-keyboard plugged in, after replugging, it reverts back to the original keyboard-layout.
