2007-03-05T11:31:00.000Z	Guest_370		Noob question--I cannot get any downloaded version of ubuntu to install. Have tried 6.06, 6.10, 6.06 alt, have changed HD, cdrom, cd rom media. ido burners, have burnt super slow, have downloaded via bittorrent, and the result is the ubuntu startup screen, then either a hang up after drivers installed, or in some cases, kernal panic. What is the world am I doing wrong?
