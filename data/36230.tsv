2010-05-30T11:41:00.000Z	epkugelmass		I have a somewhat silly question. top shows my memory usage to be ~38% of 4GB right now. The most memory intensive application, according to top, is Xorg at 2.9%, and everything else is consuming <.5%. How could I possibly be consuming 38% of my memory right now? I have almost nothing running on my computer right now.

2010-05-30T11:48:00.000Z	epkugelmass	Kiff	I ran free--Under 'used', on the second line, discounting buffers/cache, I'm still burning 1.5GB of mem on seemingly nothing!
