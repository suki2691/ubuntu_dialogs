2012-09-17T19:09:00.000Z	iljo		i've installed ubuntu 12.04 and can't remove the folder quick links in left side of the explorer window
2012-09-17T19:10:00.000Z	iljo		i am talking about those Documents, Downloads, etc. links
2012-09-17T19:10:00.000Z	krababbel	iljo	I'd guess that is intentional and part of the desktop
