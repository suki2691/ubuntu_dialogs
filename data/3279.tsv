2012-05-31T18:23:00.000Z	GeoGeek		Guys--I hope someone can help me. I just used boot-repair and got my system back where I can boot it...but I have to go to the BIOS boot menu and TELL it to use the hard drive. It won't just boot off of it...it says "no boot device found." I have only the one hard drive and a CD in the system right now.

2012-05-31T19:33:00.000Z	GeoGeek	bobweaver	Sorry...stepped away for a few. I just let boot-repair do its thing. This is a level of the black arts that I hesitate to dabble in too much...but see pastebin.ubuntu.com/1016391 for boot-info...
