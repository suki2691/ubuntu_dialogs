2010-09-13T00:08:00.000Z	Aemaeth		my friend's brother somehow erased a data harddrive that he had some to-him important data, is there anything in gnu/linux to maybe help him out?  They wont give me information on what they were doing to erase it, so i think anything from disk error to deleted partition, but i'm nervous about setting any changes.  Is there a good undelete or ??? some kind of cool program?
