2008-03-30T08:05:00.000Z	DCRa		Hm Can anyone help me with a general SSH question? It has nothing to do with ubuntu, but the support around here is amazing
2008-03-30T08:06:00.000Z	DCRa		I need the command 'sudo' to work. Whenever I use it it says bash: sudo: command not found.
2008-03-30T08:06:00.000Z	Flannel	DCRa	You're probably not SSHing into sudo
2008-03-30T08:06:00.000Z	Flannel	DCRa	er, into a system with sudo.
