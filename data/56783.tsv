2009-05-20T22:58:00.000Z	desertm4x		I have the following problem: There are two computers, both using a wireless mouse (same model). The problem is that one mouse controls the other computer and the other way round. Using Windows, there is a way to restrict the base station to some frequences, so the wireless mouses do not interfer. Is there a way to achieve something similar using Ubuntu?
2009-05-20T23:00:00.000Z	arand	desertm4x	That I think woulve be tricky, since i guess it's done through the driver software of the mouse, which often does not have an equivalent on linux... since the manufacturers don't bother to create them...

2009-05-20T23:02:00.000Z	desertm4x	arand	That's actually what I expected. I just thought someone maybe knows some driver options or documentation where this could be mentioned. Though I think there is not a standard way to achieve this... :-(
