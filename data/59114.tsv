It completed restarted machine but it wouldn't boot up from the usb drive. I get back into ubuntu, and the drive no longer automounts... I install gparted and try to format it but it comes up as 3.76GiB unallocated. So I tried to plug into windows and format in there, but windows says it can't and to check
