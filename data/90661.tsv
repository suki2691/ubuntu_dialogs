2008-05-22T06:23:00.000Z	DrBanzai		I see lots of people asking about wireless not working...what's up with that?  I'm here for that too.  I just installed Hardy on my Acer 5920 laptop, and I can't get wireless to work either.  It has the Intel 3945 chip...any ideas?  It dosen't even show up under Networking, and I get no wireless icon on the top task bar...
