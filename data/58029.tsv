2009-05-12T00:19:00.000Z	blixt	nigtv	how do you mean in theory no? what would be the proper way edit a config file?
2009-05-12T00:21:00.000Z	nigtv	blixt	what I mean is that if you dont need root privs to edit a file, then you shouldnt sudo gedit it, and if you do need them, then you would have to. As long as you dont sudo gedit a file that doesnt need root privs nothing should 'change' on you. But if you sudo gedit a file that doesnt exist yet (i.e. create one) then, yea, it will need root privs to be accessed again unless you chmod it
