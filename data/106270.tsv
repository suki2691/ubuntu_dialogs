2008-09-08T15:55:00.000Z	Badboy_		Is it possible to write a recursive Macro(function like) in C
2008-09-08T15:57:00.000Z	Badboy_		Actually I want to say that Can a macro call itself?
2008-09-08T15:57:00.000Z	carrera	Badboy_	good questions but why would u want to do that when ANSI C recommends against macros
2008-09-08T15:58:00.000Z	carrera	Badboy_	then just experiment with it!
