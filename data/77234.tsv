2008-10-15T09:18:00.000Z	zoid01		just did some updates, new kernel.. poof, no more wireless. device eth1 not found
2008-10-15T09:19:00.000Z	Halycon	zoid01	that happend to me once
2008-10-15T09:19:00.000Z	Halycon		I think I just did that update as well
2008-10-15T09:19:00.000Z	zoid01	Halycon	its iwl3945 so problematic anyway, but for the device to not even be recognized is a little wacky
