2011-11-10T09:11:00.000Z	skandranon		Ubuntu hates me. Upgraded my girls computer to 11.10, that was a nightmare. She HATES it! Reinstalling 10.04.3 After install (new download, new burn), the pc boots to a "blank" purple screen (the default desktop background) with nothing else. If I try to run the intsall again, it shows ubuntu 10.04.3 being installed, but everytime I boot its back to this blank screen. How can I fix this plz?
