2010-04-07T13:52:00.000Z	igoryonya		and: /desktop/gnome/applications/window_manager/default = /usr/bin/compiz
2010-04-07T13:52:00.000Z	igoryonya		If I switch the values in those keys around to make compiz the current, will i indup in unloadable gnome desktop after boot, or I will be fine, and if it will become unloadable, where are the text files that I can change this back, from the command line if I will be stuck in the console, so I can get back to GUI.
