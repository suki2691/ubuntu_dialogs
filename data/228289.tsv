2006-11-29T13:55:00.000Z	WhiteRabt		ARGHH! I'm trying to move 50 gig of music from a windows machine to my mythtv box... i can't get ftp to connect, even though i've installed 4 different ftpds, ssh and vnc work though... i installed nfs on my mythtv box but i can't find a windows nfs client that works... the only one I can get to connect crashes my explorer... can anyone suggest any alternative ways of moving 50 gig across a local network?
