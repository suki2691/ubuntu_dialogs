2010-10-05T12:46:00.000Z	rww	oskude	because http://paste.ubuntu.com/ had issues for a while. I'll go poke the relevant people to change it back.
2010-10-05T12:46:00.000Z	oskude	rww	oh, nice!
2010-10-05T13:14:00.000Z	oskude	rww	right, with paste.ubuntu.com you need launchpad account to even get the plain text...
