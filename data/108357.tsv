I tried uninstalling FF3 from synaptic and then installing FF2, to no avail.

2008-06-11T21:29:00.000Z	Sanketsu	yell0w	ok.  Thanks, I'll look into that.
2008-06-11T21:53:00.000Z	Sanketsu	yell0w	I looked into some things and figured out that I all I needed to get my stuff working was turn off the computability check for addons.
