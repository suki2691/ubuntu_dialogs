I don't even know how to rename xUbuntu machines through the GUI, let alone command line... Can I make a script to rename them with something like Ram-Tux(Insert Random Number here) ?

2009-05-28T17:11:00.000Z	ziroday	IHS_Intern	you need to change /etc/hostname
2009-05-28T17:14:00.000Z	IHS_Intern	ziroday	thanks, that does help, tells me something I didn't yet know... so now I just need to know how to change it to something a little less constant.
