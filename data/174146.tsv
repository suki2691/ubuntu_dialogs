2008-06-05T12:06:00.000Z	skeftomai		hello gents...can anyone give me any leads on what might be causing the error pictured here http://chadjohnson.ath.cx/error.jpg ? This happens when I resume from suspend with a Turion X2 on Mint Linux Elyssa (based on Hardy)
2008-06-05T12:07:00.000Z	skeftomai		ah, thanks
2008-06-05T12:07:00.000Z	skeftomai		assuming this is not distro-specific though, anyone seen this error?
