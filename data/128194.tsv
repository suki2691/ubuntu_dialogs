2009-05-15T09:49:00.000Z	Optimus55		I'm volunteering at an open source summer camp. but there's a guy i work with, with a really high pitched voice that's scaring me. What should I do??

2009-05-15T09:51:00.000Z	Optimus55	scunizi	i have to work with him. its so weird i never met anyone like that before. he has a beard but talks like a 5 year old
2009-05-15T09:52:00.000Z	scunizi	Optimus55	visualize him with pectoral accentuators and a dress and then the voice won't be so bothersome
