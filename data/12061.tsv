2011-07-12T19:52:00.000Z	bootloader		hey guys...apt-get seems to be missing autocompletion. I'm using 10.4...how might I enable it?
2011-07-12T19:54:00.000Z	bootloader		and then I hit tab, and it should list options/fill it in if its obvious
2011-07-12T19:54:00.000Z	rww	bootloader	do you get tab-complete in bash for other things (like ls, for example)?
2011-07-12T19:54:00.000Z	bootloader	rww	yes, I do. and bash-completion is installed and up-to-date
