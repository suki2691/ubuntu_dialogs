2011-06-23T20:43:00.000Z	testosin		!help: I suddenly have no sound. In the sound preferences program says I don't have any application playing or recording audio. If I open rythmbox, and try to play a song, the song stays in 0:00 and does not move on. The sound was working good minutes ago. Is there a way to restart the sound, alsa restart or something like that?
