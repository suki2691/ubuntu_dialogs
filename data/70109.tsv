2009-01-02T19:52:00.000Z	ikonia	amitz1	why does he want to debootsstrap ?
2009-01-02T19:54:00.000Z	amitz1	ikonia	ah, what I meant is for him/her to create his new installation for his external storage.
2009-01-02T19:54:00.000Z	ikonia	amitz1	so he doesn't need to debootstrap - just install as normal
2009-01-02T19:55:00.000Z	amitz1	ikonia	You're right. I generalized my case to his/her. I used debootstrap thus I thought (s)he probably needs it.
