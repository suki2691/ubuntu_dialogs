2006-08-28T12:17:00.000Z	Thomas3		Hi, problem: trying to connect to the net in a hotel. iwlist eth0 scan finds the AP, but I can not connect to it; with windows, it works right away. I tried iwconfig eth0 essid <the name>, ifdown eth0, ifup eth0 and still no IP; what can I try?
2006-08-28T12:19:00.000Z	Thomas3		anyone can help with a wireless problem?
2006-08-28T12:21:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Thomas3	did you try from the network manager/
2006-08-28T12:23:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Thomas3	no, its nothing like that. Look, you are a hotel, right? Is it a public wifi network?
