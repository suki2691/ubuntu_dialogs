2005-09-25T16:53:00.000Z	Xenguy	mcphail	not that I know of - the only weird thing I noticed was that when I'm at the console (i.e. non-X) the display only takes up part of the screen display, but I don't know if that's really relevant or not
2005-11-10T15:10:00.000Z	mcphail	Xenguy	the docs might have been moved into the main package?
2005-11-10T15:11:00.000Z	Xenguy	mcphail	dunno, I get a similar conflict for a wine setup tool called winesetuptk
