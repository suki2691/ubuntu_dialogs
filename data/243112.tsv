2009-09-10T13:18:00.000Z	glickity		its very annoying
2009-09-10T13:18:00.000Z	glickity		does anyone know where i can change that preference
2009-09-10T13:20:00.000Z	blue-frog	glickity	because the screen is very small then maximised is the best choice; no I don't know how to chnage that. use normal edition of ubuntu
