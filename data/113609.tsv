2008-03-19T20:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	janerik_	I saw the error...
2008-03-19T20:15:00.000Z	janerik_	Jack_Sparrow	What can we read of that??? I can see the disk in konqueror, but its not mounted. Do you think that can be the reason why Grub is not working right?
2008-03-19T20:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	janerik_	If you can see it in Konq then you have a problem on your windows drive and you should see #WIndows for help, they may want you to fix the mbr just to point to windows, but that can be changed back later
