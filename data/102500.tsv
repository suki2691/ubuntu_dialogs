2010-06-29T20:30:00.000Z	Exilant		Does someone know about the status of the ubuntu keyserver? http://keyserver.ubuntu.com just shows an "it works", and gpg cannot retrieve keys for it. Is this a temporary problem?

2010-06-29T20:31:00.000Z	rww	Exilant	also, keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 isn't the normal keyserver address. It's on some random port that I generally use Google to get to
2010-06-29T20:32:00.000Z	rww	Exilant	keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371 , by the look of it. which is down right now, but for future reference...
