2010-03-12T08:19:00.000Z	nwidger		i just followed the directions here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick#From%20Mac to create a bootable usb stick, but when i run 'hdiutil info /dev/disk1', the partition is shown as being not bootable.  shouldnt it be listed as being bootable or am missing something?
