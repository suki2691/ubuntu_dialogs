2008-11-13T00:21:00.000Z	Bodsda		im a bit of a noob when it comes to web programming and web servers, im trying to set up a personal wiki -- ive installed php5 and apache 2 and set up appropriate folders, it then tells me to; in my browser, go to localhost/apache2-default/pmwiki/pmwiki.php   and then i should get more instructions from that php file -- but firefox just tries to download it -- is that meant to happen?
2008-11-13T00:21:00.000Z	tillux	Bodsda	looks like the apache server is not configured properly
2008-11-13T00:21:00.000Z	Bodsda	tillux	hmmm, okay ty -- il go and do some more research
2008-11-13T00:22:00.000Z	tillux	Bodsda	or there's a htaccess file corrupted
