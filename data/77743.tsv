I just tried that live CD from USB and it worked...but when I booted back into windows I got me a message saying "One of your disks needs to be checked for consistency." and it went through the scans and showed no errors...is that normal after using the Ubuntu from USB?

2008-11-14T10:50:00.000Z	Robb_M	BliND123	i wouldnt worry :)
2008-11-14T10:51:00.000Z	Robb_M	BliND123	unless it came up with errors after the check...then i would worry, but if it said it was all good, then...you are definately safe.
