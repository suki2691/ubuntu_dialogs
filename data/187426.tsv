2009-07-24T02:06:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax		I have a new and novel problem, if any of you have information and would be kind enough to help.  When I try to "fullscreen" a youtube flash video it screws up the laptop monitor.  Fills it all with unreadable gibberish.  The 2nd external monitor still shows everything (including the flash video) just fine.
2009-07-24T02:06:00.000Z	JoAnneThrax		It doesn't crash the browser.
2009-07-24T02:07:00.000Z	ikonia	JoAnneThrax	there are some problems with flash in general and some video cards / configs as flash is closed source
2009-07-24T02:07:00.000Z	ikonia	JoAnneThrax	not that that is the problem, just a heads up
