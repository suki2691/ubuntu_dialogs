2009-05-17T16:13:00.000Z	justsee		Hi - can anyone point me to reasonable information on CentOS vs Ubuntu for servers? I've used Ubuntu myself, but our Managed Services guys seem to look down on anything that isn't Fedora / CentOS?

2009-05-17T16:15:00.000Z	justsee	Slart	hmm yeah. This guy seems to recently complain about CentOS's repositories vs Ubuntu, but wasn't entirely convincing: http://is.gd/AGkj
