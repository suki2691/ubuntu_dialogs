2004-10-19T15:14:00.000Z	pere		Thanks for the help with installing mplayer, everyone. However Im getting an error trying to play mpeg-movies: "alsa-control: mixer attach dev/mixer error: No such file or directory". Any ideas

2004-10-19T15:16:00.000Z	pere		in mplayer.conf I see ao=alsa
2004-10-19T15:17:00.000Z	pere	jordi	is that OK?
