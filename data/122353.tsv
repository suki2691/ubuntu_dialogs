2007-09-23T07:21:00.000Z	Usrl_		I have a .rar file that's in 15 parts, how do I recombine/extract them together?
2007-09-23T07:21:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Usrl_	just extract the first file (usually .rar or .r00)
2007-09-23T07:21:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Usrl_	the extracter will pick up the other files automatically
2007-09-23T07:21:00.000Z	Usrl_	SlimeyPete	oh, ok, thanks
