2005-12-09T06:11:00.000Z	darkgamer20		please help me. I added my hp officejet k80 with the gnome printer manager, but whenever i try to print from OO.o the printer dose not do anything it just sits there. I am sure that the hplip driver is installed, any ideas about what might be wrong?
2005-12-09T06:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	darkgamer20	have you configured the printing settings in OOorg
2005-12-09T06:13:00.000Z	darkgamer20	erUSUL	well OOorg says its gonna print to my officejet so i thought that didn't need any other configuration
2005-12-09T06:16:00.000Z	darkgamer20	erUSUL	well tried to configure it but there seems to be nothing that change my result
