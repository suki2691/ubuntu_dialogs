2009-06-06T00:32:00.000Z	Blz		Hey everybody:  i'm building a mythbuntu server and I have a few questions about conversion of TV broadcast to digital format in the US
2009-06-06T00:32:00.000Z	Blz		Nobody seems to be in the ubuntu-mythtv room, so i thought i'd ask here
2009-06-06T00:33:00.000Z	Flannel	Blz	You might try #ubuntu-offtopic
2009-06-06T00:33:00.000Z	Blz	Flannel	 will do.  Is that really offtopic here?  if so, I apologize
