2007-02-27T10:27:00.000Z	D--		I have a question. I just installed a kernel update, but I'm rather unhappy with it. I can still select my old kernel from the menu and boot into it, but is there any way to just remove the new kernel?

2007-02-27T10:34:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	D--	no.  Those are metapackages that link to whatever is newest.
