2011-02-15T22:44:00.000Z	Zoffix_		Hey, is there a way for me to select all the packages I want installed and instead of downloading them to get just the LINKS to them so I could download them on another box?
2011-02-15T22:46:00.000Z	Zoffix_		Basically, I can't use more than a few megs of bandwidth on this location AND I can't remove this computer (it's work). I'm trying to install some software on it...
