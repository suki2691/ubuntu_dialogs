2007-11-21T11:36:00.000Z	freeheels		looking for some help:  recently installed Gutsy on an IBM T43 -- everything has worked fine except for a problem where hotkeys seem 'sticky'.  I have a key combo bound for opening a gnome terminal and occasionally it will start opening an infinite amount of windows...
2007-11-21T11:37:00.000Z	freeheels		to stop it, I have to switch over to one of the non X terminals (alt-ctrl-F6, for instance) and killing all my processes.
2007-11-21T11:38:00.000Z	freeheels		I've been googling the issue and haven't found anything that seems to match up.  Weird stuff.
