2012-11-16T17:32:00.000Z	blno	pythonirc101	11.10 is still supported until 13.04 I think, so you can keep it if you like it. If you want more recent features, 12.04 is good and stable (but uses quite a different interface).
2012-11-16T17:33:00.000Z	pythonirc101	blno	http://pbin.be/show/931/ -- any ideas why this would happen?
2012-11-16T17:35:00.000Z	blno	pythonirc101	sorry, no idea. What does the log says?
