2007-05-08T05:55:00.000Z	Wanderer		does ubuntu have a file->package listing to find what package you need to install a file you do not have?
2007-05-08T05:56:00.000Z	crdlb	Wanderer	you can use ubotu too
2007-05-08T05:56:00.000Z	crdlb	Wanderer	/msg ubotu find filename
2007-05-08T06:02:00.000Z	Wanderer	crdlb	I think the packages.ubuntu.com might be better.  I'm looking for "config.h" ...
