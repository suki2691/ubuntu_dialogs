2010-01-14T22:13:00.000Z	wad	grayhane	yes.
2010-01-14T22:14:00.000Z	wad	grayhane	actually, I want to sort through a certain subset of my music (in a certain directory) and delete the albums I don't like so much, so that I can fit the rest on my mp3 player.
2010-01-14T22:14:00.000Z	wad	grayhane	ah, I'll do that. Then I'll check out songbird.
