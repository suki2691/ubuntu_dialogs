2009-11-08T20:33:00.000Z	mynameisdeleted		I had a really crashy ubuntu install for a week which got fixed by removign a single 1 of 3 sticks of memory in the system
2009-11-08T20:33:00.000Z	mynameisdeleted		which was brand new memory so that surprised me
2009-11-08T20:33:00.000Z	mynameisdeleted		is it recomended I re-install to avoid corrupt files?
