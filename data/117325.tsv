2009-06-14T03:10:00.000Z	stef11		Hi, in add/remove applications I see that the openJDK is installed I would like to install the sun jdk, but on removal it says 'one or more app depend on openJDK remove through package manager.' I start package manager but openJDK cannot be found...
2009-06-14T03:11:00.000Z	stef11		I don't know how open jdk got installed
2009-06-14T03:11:00.000Z	stef11		why can't I find openJdk in package manager?
