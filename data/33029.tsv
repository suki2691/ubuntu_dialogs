2010-04-30T21:59:00.000Z	slw	ghee	you can try installing ubuntu-netbook. It looks promising, though I haven't tried it myself.
2010-04-30T22:04:00.000Z	ghee		so no way to switch from Ubuntu Desktop to Netbook edition? desktop-switcher seems to be out aswell :(
2010-04-30T22:07:00.000Z	ghee	xangua	Ahh didn't know it was there. I found it I think: ubuntu-netbook-remix - Transitional package for the Ubuntu Netbook system
2010-04-30T22:08:00.000Z	slw	ghee	there's also a package called ubuntu-netbook which installs ubuntu-netbook-remix along with it. It might be worth a try too...
