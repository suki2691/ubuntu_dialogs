2009-02-06T16:57:00.000Z	grrr		Hi - CD Audio (using rythmbox plays intermittently, for say 10 seconds, then stops. I don't get any audio at all from KsCD. Using Hardy 8.04LTS - any suggestions? I'm pretty sure all the codecs are on.
2009-02-06T16:58:00.000Z	blizzle	grrr	Try running ryhthmbox from console and see if any errors crop up..
2009-02-06T17:15:00.000Z	blizzle	grrr	Hmm.. maybe give Exaile a spin..?
2009-02-06T17:16:00.000Z	blizzle	grrr	You might also try apt-get reinstall rythmbox
