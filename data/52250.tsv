2010-07-13T21:48:00.000Z	barfster		I am now logging in for the first time to a newly installed Ubuntu 10.04 on a Compaq Armada M700, is ubuntu desktop heavy stuff? I mean it takes forever to launch the indent screen, and also the desktop after authenticating.

2010-07-15T00:00:00.000Z	blackxored	barfster	they do quite a lot, accessing squashfs fs, creating isolinux or syslinux boots, copying files, adjusting device mappings, etc
2010-07-15T00:01:00.000Z	blackxored	barfster	yes they are
