2008-05-09T22:44:00.000Z	dvs		well crap
2008-05-09T22:45:00.000Z	dvs		unless someone else in here knows how to force that to work, i would start over and install xp first.   ubuntu is setup to run real smooth with a dual boot if it is installed after windows
2008-05-09T22:46:00.000Z	blame	dvs	what is your objective ?
