2008-02-05T02:46:00.000Z	nkbreau		does anyone here know how to fix the problem in gutsy gibbon where firefox crashes on loading of a page with flash content ? It's starting to drive me nuts... none of the solutions I've found work, using gutsy gibbon...
2008-02-05T02:46:00.000Z	nkbreau		I'm about ready to go back to vista if i cant get this fixed
2008-02-05T02:46:00.000Z	nkbreau		it also crashes all browsers, not just firefox
2008-02-05T02:47:00.000Z	neverblue	nkbreau	the flash package has been broken for quite sometime now, did you try running FF in a terminal, to troubleshoot the output ?
