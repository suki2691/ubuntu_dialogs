I also get this message: Jun 23 08:48:39 dan kernel: psmouse.c: Explorer Mouse at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost synchronization, throwing 2 bytes away. What can I do about this? In order to fix it I must always unplug my mouse from the KVM then plug it back in
2005-06-30T07:55:00.000Z	Seveas	chillywilly	try without the KVM
2005-06-30T08:27:00.000Z	chillywilly	Seveas	it is definitely something with that newer kernel because everything works fine with the older one...it hangs right before it's about to render the desktop
2005-06-30T13:44:00.000Z	Seveas	chillywilly	hmm, indeed ;)
