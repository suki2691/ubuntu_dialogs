2010-07-18T23:21:00.000Z	zachlr1	oCean_	yesterday you helped me with deleting folders and files on a FAT32 partition that contained illegal characters. I just wanted to let you know that I was able to fix the problem using chkdisk /f on Windows. I would bet testdisk on Ubuntu would have had the same effect. Thanks.
2010-07-18T23:21:00.000Z	oCean_	zachlr1	okay! Good to hear it worked out!
