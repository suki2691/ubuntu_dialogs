2007-02-17T08:55:00.000Z	watson540		Hi, does anyone in here have a lapto? The reason I ask is that I posted a rather intriguing post on the forums. A question about laptops and docking bays under linux. See I just bought an awesome lappy, except the video card sucks, uses shared memory. My propsed solution?? Get a docking bay with PCI slots in it, slap a better video card and tv tuner in the PCI slots and call it a desktop PC! of course the video card would only output to an externa
