2011-07-23T21:42:00.000Z	luckysmack_	kural	i understand them ok. not real well though.
2011-07-23T21:44:00.000Z	luckysmack_	kural	i have a webserver i have custom IP tables setup on to only allow the right ports of 80 and 443 and 22 for ssh and block everything else. but i sometimes reference online articles to modify them.
