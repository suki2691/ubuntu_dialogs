2004-10-26T08:28:00.000Z	Keybuk	Hoodster	shouldn't break, but if it does you get to keep both bits
2004-10-26T08:29:00.000Z	Hoodster	Keybuk	so, packages from universe really should work with ubuntu, but no guarantees (hehe)
2004-10-26T08:29:00.000Z	Keybuk	Hoodster	exactly.  they're not supported, so install at your own risk
