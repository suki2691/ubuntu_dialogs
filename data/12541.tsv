2011-10-29T19:01:00.000Z	DeltaWhy		I am having trouble upgrading to 11.10. When I click upgrade it says it's downloading the upgrade tool, then the update manager closes and nothing else happens.
2011-10-29T19:02:00.000Z	DeltaWhy		is there a shell command to launch the upgrade wizard directly?
2011-10-29T19:03:00.000Z	zykotick9	DeltaWhy	"update-manager" perhaps
2011-10-29T19:04:00.000Z	zykotick9	DeltaWhy	sorry you're upgrading, see elgaton's suggestion
