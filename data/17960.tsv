2011-02-17T22:13:00.000Z	Undisclosed99		can someone tell me why my RAM keeps loading as 750MB when it should be 2.7Gig and only sometimes it loads correctly

2011-02-17T22:14:00.000Z	Undisclosed99	uRock	 ill check now
2011-02-17T22:15:00.000Z	Undisclosed99	uRock	its only seeing 762256, usually after a reboot though it does load correct
