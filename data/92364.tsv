2008-05-02T21:20:00.000Z	pmetzger	mirdin76	do other versions of Ubuntu install okay?
2008-05-02T21:23:00.000Z	pmetzger	mirdin76	does the hardware run another OS successfully?
2008-05-02T21:24:00.000Z	mirdin76	pmetzger	yeah, actually I was able to install gutsy xubuntu on it once in text mode, but it was a buggy install so I'm trying again from scratch
