2006-10-18T15:56:00.000Z	iammisc		i have a laptop which i want to install ubuntu on. However, i need to dual-boot windows because sometimes, I have to use it. The hard drive on this computer is 40gb and I want to know how I should partition it using qt parted. Should i keep 20gb windows, 20 ubuntu or something else?
