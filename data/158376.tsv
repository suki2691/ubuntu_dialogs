2008-08-05T02:35:00.000Z	newuser		I need to format my computer, and add protection to it. I need it to be very safe in terms of encripting files, where can I find good tutorials on maintaning my computer safe of intruders?

2008-08-05T02:38:00.000Z	Slart	newuser	I don't think there is anything that can hide a partition entirely.. truecrypt is supposed to make it undistinguishable from random data but its still there afaik
