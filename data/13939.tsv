2011-05-24T02:42:00.000Z	root-lord	Yoshie	I'm able to activate the nvidia drivers natively but it says it is not in use and I get scribbles when I start up the OS instead of a nice looking Ubuntu splash screen
2011-05-24T02:45:00.000Z	Yoshie	root-lord	 start up boot option using this     nouveau.blacklist=1
