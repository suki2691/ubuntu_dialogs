2011-06-05T07:04:00.000Z	Pilif12p		i'm trying to upload a picture to Facebook, but when I go to my camera, I get the error "Cannot change to folder because it is not local"
2011-06-05T07:05:00.000Z	Pilif12p		if it matters, the camera is a Finepix S2950, using Aurora
2011-06-05T07:05:00.000Z	Pilif12p		I stand corrected. This is Fx5 beta
2011-06-05T07:07:00.000Z	Smackwho	Pilif12p	u probably want to save the images locally first rather than uploading from camera.
