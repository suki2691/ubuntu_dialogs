2008-04-25T01:47:00.000Z	At0x0		Is anyone having problems with us.archive.ubuntu.com (91.189.92.3)?
2008-04-25T01:47:00.000Z	At0x0		Is there someplace I can get a deb for firefox 2 besides the ubuntu archive?
2008-04-25T01:49:00.000Z	At0x0		Will this file install firefox or is it only an update? firefox_2.0.0.14+2nobinonly-0ubuntu0.7.10_i386.deb (its 8.8M)
2008-04-25T01:50:00.000Z	gaurav__	At0x0	that looks like firefox itself, not an update
