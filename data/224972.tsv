2005-08-07T12:10:00.000Z	transgress	brokenbox	yes but use aptitude to remove them
2005-08-07T12:11:00.000Z	brokenbox	transgress	cool thanks,  Yeah i heard that aptitude is the only way to remove anything?
2005-08-07T12:12:00.000Z	transgress	brokenbox	no that's not true... you can use apt-get, aptitude, synaptic, and dpkg... and rm... but aptitude keeps better track of shit
