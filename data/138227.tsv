2009-06-13T09:32:00.000Z	erty		Q: Anyone else using ubuntu 9.04 with ati 9600 or similar?  I am upgrading from 8.10 and it just warned me that my current restricted driver will not work in 9.04
2009-06-13T09:32:00.000Z	usser	erty	it will not
2009-06-13T09:33:00.000Z	usser	erty	ati dropped support for your card in the newest driver, unfortunately older drivers do not work with jaunty's xorg
2009-06-13T09:34:00.000Z	usser	erty	it will, but it'll use opensource driver which has very limited 3d support, that said compiz should work
