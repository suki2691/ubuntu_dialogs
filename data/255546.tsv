2009-05-20T22:54:00.000Z	Uatec		hi there
2009-05-20T22:55:00.000Z	Uatec		the screen brightness buttons that come built in to my laptop are really slow at responding, they increase the brightness by such a tiny amount it takes ages to make the screen bright enough to see
2009-05-20T22:55:00.000Z	Uatec		is there  a tool that will let me control the screen brightness using my mouse or something, the same way there is for the volume?
2009-05-20T22:56:00.000Z	mcphail	Uatec	what graphics card do you have?
