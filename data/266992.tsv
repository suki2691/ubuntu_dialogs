2011-04-25T21:41:00.000Z	charlie_		hello guys, why is the suspend/resume not working in ubuntu 10.10 or is it just me?
2011-04-25T21:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	charlie_	 whats your ram size.. and whats your swap size?
2011-04-25T21:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	charlie_	 swap needs to be at least 2 gb. if not a little more.
2011-04-29T21:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	charlie_	 i think thats handled by the xubuntus file manager.   But it may be an all or nothing 'show icons of not' setting.  theres #xubuntu you can ask
