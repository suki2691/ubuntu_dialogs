2010-11-22T23:24:00.000Z	ratul_		anyone got idea to install packages in a "total" offline computer? ( I have the necessary deb packages, which I collectd from my /apt/archieves)
2010-11-22T23:26:00.000Z	dajhorn	ratul_	Look at something like the apt-zip or apt-offline package.   There are several other utilities that do the same thing.
2010-11-22T23:26:00.000Z	ratul_	dajhorn	thanks, but what are the other utilites?
