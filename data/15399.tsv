2011-09-27T07:21:00.000Z	shadows090		Does anybody have any suggestions for working with csv files that doesn't include open office? any other software that I wasn't able to find?
2011-09-27T07:22:00.000Z	escott	shadows090	what do you want to do with the csv?
2011-09-27T07:24:00.000Z	shadows090	escott	well, a general question, a few times i've found myself finding and replacing a few hundred times. i'm searching for a vim plugin right now, but I wanted to search here just in case
2011-09-27T07:30:00.000Z	shadows090	escott	that's cool, i'll have to look into that. thanks. i'm going to continue looking for a csv plugin that suites my needs.
