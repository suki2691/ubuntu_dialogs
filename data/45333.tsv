2009-10-21T10:59:00.000Z	BossNobody		The wikipeida page actually kind of has no real explanation that I can understand
2009-10-21T10:59:00.000Z	BossNobody		It doesn't really stay the differences between the too or the status of the the Ubuntu Moblin Remix really it could be buggy as hell but they don't say jack
2009-10-21T11:00:00.000Z	BossNobody		nothing about apps available either
2009-10-21T11:00:00.000Z	Ania12lat	BossNobody	maybe moblin isn't based on ubuntu :f
