Having said that, to install a specific version of a package, you can use command like this:  sudo apt-get install zip=3.0-2build1  (to install that specific version of zip)
2011-06-27T23:18:00.000Z	willvarfar	oCean	thx; is there a way to do it bulk for all packages?
2011-06-27T23:21:00.000Z	oCean	willvarfar	I never heard of a tool that could do that in bulk. In /var/log/apt/history.log you can find your recent updates though
