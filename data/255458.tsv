2004-12-12T16:38:00.000Z	confrey		Ican't find the faq page explaining how to play mp3 with ubuntu; I remember I have to download sone gstreamer plugin, but I can't find them
2004-12-12T16:39:00.000Z	confrey		and how can I install xmms? I can't install from net, because I have a modem 56K, I have to download packages manually
