2009-06-15T08:05:00.000Z	screamsayonara		hi... i installed ubuntu over an extremely virus-ridden windows-xp on my parents' laptop, but they hate it, so now i need to reinstall xp.... but when i put the xp disc in, ubuntu is recognising it only as a blank disc, but on MY laptop with ubuntu, it recognises the disc just fine... why is the other ubuntu not able to recognise the windows disc?

2009-06-15T08:07:00.000Z	screamsayonara		no it just goes to ubuntu, i even changed it in bios to boot first from the cd
