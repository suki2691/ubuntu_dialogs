2007-11-29T06:59:00.000Z	Adyeths		I have a small usb drive that used to work fine. But for some reason now that I've upgraded to Gutsy it no longer seems to be recognized and I can no longer mount the drive to read and write files on it. Anyone know how to make ubuntu be able to use it again?
2007-11-29T07:00:00.000Z	spence	Adyeths	what format is it (fat16, fat32, ntfs, ext2...)
2007-11-29T07:04:00.000Z	spence	Adyeths	do other usb sticks work?
2007-11-29T07:14:00.000Z	spence	Adyeths	what brand, how many partitions?
