2006-04-21T08:55:00.000Z	Digiman		anyone on Ubuntu Live CD to help me with internet connectivity?
2006-04-21T08:56:00.000Z	Warbo	Digiman	What Internet? 56k (internal? external?) ADSL (cable? ethernet? usb?)
2006-04-21T08:58:00.000Z	Warbo	Digiman	Is your modem Ethernet (plugs in network) or USB?
2006-04-21T09:00:00.000Z	Warbo	Digiman	OK, this is where drivers are tricky. Do you know if it is a Speedtouch (looks like a shiny crab) or SagemFast800 (says so on it) or neither?
