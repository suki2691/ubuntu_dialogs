2006-01-01T13:51:00.000Z	cipher_		Hi folks, anyone have problems installing firefox 1.0.7 under kubuntu 5.10?
2006-01-01T13:51:00.000Z	kakei	cipher_	it crash sometimes?
2006-01-01T13:51:00.000Z	cipher_		I'm getting complaints about not finding an art file, and a "find" error when I try to apt-get remove it.
2006-01-01T13:52:00.000Z	cipher_	kakei	no, it seems to run OK, but the menu item hasn't been added--it seems like the install itself didn't go properly.
