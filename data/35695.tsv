2010-03-19T11:32:00.000Z	penguinv	psycho_oreos	I see the results but I dont know which is swap. (someone said to another, swap should be 2x ram and I said to self, check it out)
2010-03-19T11:33:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	penguinv	ahh yes, that's because swap doesn't get mounted as a human readable size :) i.e. its only for machine use
