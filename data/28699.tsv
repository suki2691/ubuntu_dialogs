2010-07-21T19:02:00.000Z	uRock	surging	On the left side of the screen where the #s are listed, right click and uncheck "auto-join on connect"
2010-07-21T19:04:00.000Z	surging	uRock	i tried that before but when i restart the program auto-join is checked again, i'll go ask in xchat
2010-07-21T19:05:00.000Z	uRock	surging	that is odd, it has worked without any issues for me. Good luck
