2011-02-23T03:11:00.000Z	JosephKerr001		i'm looking into it but i'm running an older version of ubuntu, not sure if that makes any kind of difference
2011-02-23T03:12:00.000Z	JosephKerr001		the guide i was looking at was for newest version
2011-02-23T03:12:00.000Z	Aginor	JosephKerr001	some of the guides might be too new, but for the obvious things using grub it should be pretty much the same
