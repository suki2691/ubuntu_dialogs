2011-02-02T05:13:00.000Z	curious397	quantumlemur	do this dpkg-reconfigure locales
2011-02-02T05:13:00.000Z	quantumlemur	curious397	I did that, and it said that they were all up to date, and still doesn't work
2011-02-02T05:23:00.000Z	curious397	quantumlemur	try maybe dpkg-reconfigure dash and select no and then dpkg-reconfigure debconf and select readline for a while you can change back any time
