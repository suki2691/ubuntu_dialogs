2009-06-22T00:46:00.000Z	icehawk78	Mike_lifeguard	Typically when I boot into a livecd, it shows me the available options of drives to mount. I'm slightly noobish, and noobish enough to not be very familiar with manually mounting a drive.
2009-06-22T00:47:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	icehawk78	yeah, IIRC it should automount the disc... give me the output of fdisk -l in a pastebin?
2009-06-22T00:50:00.000Z	icehawk78	Mike_lifeguard	Hm. I'm having slightly more troubles - the live session doesn't want to run the terminal.
