2008-05-05T22:01:00.000Z	unop	Kl4m	do you want to be able to edit text files? or just view them?
2008-05-05T22:02:00.000Z	Kl4m	unop	I can "less" them to view them, I would want a graphical editor
2008-05-05T22:04:00.000Z	unop	Kl4m	well, i woudln't recommend anything but vim/gvim for this requirement .. but you've already said you don't want it .. maybe emacs/xemacs then
