2007-03-28T09:08:00.000Z	Pelo	Centaur5	 try looking up the make and model of your pad in the forum
2007-03-28T09:57:00.000Z	Centaur5	Pelo	So I haven't found anything in the forum on my signature pad (it is detected in lspci) and all I find in google is that there are developer tools to help people make a program to use it but I can't find anything completed.
2007-03-28T09:58:00.000Z	Centaur5	Pelo	Thanks, I'll keep hunting then.  I can't imagine linux has a driver for it and it detects but nothing can receive input.
