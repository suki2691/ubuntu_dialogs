2012-10-30T19:16:00.000Z	GunArm1		is it impossible to keep gnome while getting rid of brasero, evolution, simple-scan, rhythmbox, gnash, etc?
2012-10-30T19:16:00.000Z	chatman	GunArm1	why would it be?
2012-10-30T19:17:00.000Z	GunArm1	chatman	I cant do apt-get remove brasero without it removing the whole metapackage
2012-10-30T19:18:00.000Z	GunArm1	chatman	finally I said ok, away with the metapackage then, as long as it leaves the gnome shell, so I removed a few things (lets just say brasero) and now I have no options in lightdm other than recovery console
