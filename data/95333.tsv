2008-04-06T07:56:00.000Z	TheFearsomeFufu		Is there a package that lists any "orphaned" packages? For example libraries that I don't need, etc
2008-04-06T07:58:00.000Z	TheFearsomeFufu		Another question: Is it ok to remove the "ubuntu-desktop" package? I'm trying to remove some things I don't need, but one of them depends on the ubuntu-desktop package
2008-04-06T07:59:00.000Z	nickrud	TheFearsomeFufu	yes, but release upgrades generally require that package be installled to complete
2008-04-06T07:59:00.000Z	TheFearsomeFufu	nickrud	Ah, ok. If it's needed for release upgrades, I'll keep it then
