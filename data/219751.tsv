2010-03-27T07:14:00.000Z	dividedby0zero		anyone?
2010-03-27T07:16:00.000Z	dividedby0zero		lets say you have a fully update copy of lucid. and beta 2 is released... do you obtain beta 2 by simply updating your packages or is it a full upgrade for the system
2010-03-27T07:16:00.000Z	Flannel	dividedby0zero	Yeah, just regular updates (but lucid support in #ubuntu+1)
