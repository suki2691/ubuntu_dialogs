2008-06-13T00:43:00.000Z	HardDisk	LogiTech	the X3100 for example will play a lot of games without a glitch, but don't expect heavy intensive FPS games like fear or crysis to play on full gfx :)
2008-06-13T00:43:00.000Z	HardDisk	LogiTech	the x3100 plays fifa08 smoothly for example, and UT2004 so it all depends on your personal needs.
