2009-04-25T03:00:00.000Z	mrluap		I have a Raid Card which does not have precompiled drivers for linux. I got an email back from their support team saying I need to compile my own set of drivers.  My question is how do I compile these drivers during the install of ubuntu, so I can install ubuntu on to the mirrored raid setup?
2009-04-25T03:01:00.000Z	mrluap		can you compile drivers during the install of ubuntu?

2009-04-25T03:04:00.000Z	cougarten	mrluap	there is an aternate instal CD (wich does not function as a live CD) and it said something about a raid device when I tried to install with it. Don't know if thats what you need
