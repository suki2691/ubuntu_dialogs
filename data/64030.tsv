2011-11-23T04:33:00.000Z	rebecca_		Oh! I have a question! I want to change the password for xUbuntu on my laptop, because I forgot it; not used it in awhile. I usually use Windows because I do a lot of research and you can't barely download anything on Linux to prevent virus infections, but when it comes to fast connection I always turn to Linux. So can you tell me if there is a way to recover a lost password without logging in on Ubuntu please?
2011-11-23T04:34:00.000Z	rebecca_		recovery mode?
2011-11-23T04:34:00.000Z	rebecca_		ok thank you!
