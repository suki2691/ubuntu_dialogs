2010-01-22T18:51:00.000Z	Barridus		anyone know if firefox 3.6 will be an upgrade to the 3.5 package, or be an entirely new package?
2010-01-22T18:52:00.000Z	coz_	Barridus	 my guess an upgrade  but you can install it now
2010-01-22T18:53:00.000Z	Barridus	coz_	you mean via the .deb on the firefox page?  i usually like to wait until things hit the official repos
2010-01-22T18:53:00.000Z	coz_	Barridus	 either the deb or a repository.... either way  ...I have used it and 3.5.6pre is fine here
