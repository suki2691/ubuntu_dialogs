2009-11-06T03:06:00.000Z	usertwo		i was advised to send a 148 MB single compressed file from one ubuntu machine to another remote ubuntu machine using openssh and scp. i checked these, but can i also use the 'Remote Desktop' that comes preinstalled in 9.04 to place a file on another machine or is that just for viewing someone else desktop?

2009-11-06T03:08:00.000Z	usertwo	Jordan_U	openshh client comes pre-installed in 9.04, so does the remote machine need anything else? (I am the one sending the file to the remote machine)
