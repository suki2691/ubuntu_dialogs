2006-05-26T13:20:00.000Z	mikeb		i like a consistant theme throughout the interface
2006-05-26T13:21:00.000Z	mikeb		is there like a program that gives a kde app your current gtk theme look?
2006-05-26T13:21:00.000Z	spikeb	mikeb	yes, there are theme engines that do that
2006-05-26T13:23:00.000Z	spikeb	mikeb	another idea is to find a theme that is available for both kde and gnome
