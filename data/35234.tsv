2010-08-13T20:17:00.000Z	Cryp71c		Within the past couple of weeks my numpad (even when numlock is on) no longer puts in numbers, but ALWAYS moves the mouse cursor...any idea how to turn this off?
2010-08-13T20:18:00.000Z	Oer	Cryp71c	yes, goto system > keyboard, last tab > use numpad as mousepointer
2010-08-13T20:19:00.000Z	Oer	Cryp71c	sorry, 4th tab
2010-08-13T20:19:00.000Z	Cryp71c	Oer	thanks!
