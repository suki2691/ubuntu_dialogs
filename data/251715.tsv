2005-01-30T17:43:00.000Z	Omoshiroi		I am doing the ATI driver setup, do I want to initialize xfree86-dga?
2005-01-30T17:44:00.000Z	sladen	Omoshiroi	leave it as the default (which is probably yes)
2005-01-30T17:44:00.000Z	Omoshiroi	sladen	default is no, which is why I am asking.
2005-01-30T17:44:00.000Z	sladen	Omoshiroi	some things like Quake like to use it for Mouse input
