2011-09-17T05:48:00.000Z	ganymede11		I have an old laptop which has no cd rom support because of a defective drive, additionally it cannot boot to a USB device. It does have a floppy drive that works. Is it possible to set up a network image server and install linux to the laptop without having usb OR cd rom support? Or is that just not possible?

2011-09-17T05:50:00.000Z	ganymede11	waiguoren	 no because i just recently swapped a defective drive from it. Now the old drive does have an os and is still bootable. But the new hard drive is totally blank
