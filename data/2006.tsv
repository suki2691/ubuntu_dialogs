2012-08-20T00:45:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two		Does anyone know how to stream with pulseaudio now that padevchooser isn't available? None of the pulse tools seem to have the option.
2012-08-20T00:45:00.000Z	W4sp	Seven_Six_Two	I have never tried but is 'vlc' not able to do that?
2012-08-20T00:45:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	W4sp	possibly, but that isn't what I want to do. I am using MPD for music. VLC can't do the same thing
2012-08-20T00:49:00.000Z	W4sp	Seven_Six_Two	I see. I have no expertise i multi-media. Only advice would be to see what exception is thrown by the clients connecting to MPD.
