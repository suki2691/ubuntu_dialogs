2010-03-07T00:52:00.000Z	timyeung	bjb1959	did you try system>admin>hardware drivers yet?
2010-03-07T00:53:00.000Z	bjb1959	timyeung	yes, I used Jockey to install the drivers, then droped to tty and ran nvidia-xconfig, then rebooted and x won't start
2010-03-07T00:54:00.000Z	timyeung	bjb1959	did you change xconfig as root?
