2006-08-11T12:00:00.000Z	harisund		I have a question. What does backport mean? What does it mean when someone backports something from edgy repos into dapper because it is newer?
2006-08-11T12:02:00.000Z	bruce89	harisund	a backport is when a newer version of something that is in edgy is build for dapper
2006-08-11T12:02:00.000Z	harisund	bruce89	I see. Can anybody do it? Does it require a developer? Any special/technical skills?
