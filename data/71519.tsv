2008-12-18T08:46:00.000Z	Kevin_	w3wsrmn	I gotta write them down - I don't have access to the machine right now. I used the Firefox extension Firebug to test the page and the Index.php file (and all of the PHP files it calls) are taking forever
2008-12-18T08:47:00.000Z	Kevin_	w3wsrmn	It seems that whenever I have someone access the site the CPU usage peaks to ~80%
2008-12-18T08:47:00.000Z	w3wsrmn	Kevin_	Oh, alright. You might also want to try asking in #ubuntu-server when you have the info. Though I doubt wordpress is the cause of your issues.
