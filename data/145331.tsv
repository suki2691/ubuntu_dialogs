2007-04-14T08:07:00.000Z	kalin		hi, i have an install of feisty fawn beta, and i'd like to upgrade to release without reinstalling completely. is there some guide to doing this somewhere?
2007-04-14T08:08:00.000Z	kalin		oh, for some reason i thought it was released.. some slashdot story the other day perhaps
2007-04-14T08:10:00.000Z	nonewmsgs	kalin	thats because it's super exciting
2007-04-14T08:11:00.000Z	nonewmsgs	kalin	i feel like one of those m$ drones waiting up all night to get vista as soon as it comes out
