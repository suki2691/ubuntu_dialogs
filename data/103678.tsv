2012-04-13T08:34:00.000Z	GuestFor		Ideally yeah
2012-04-13T08:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GuestFor	NTFS will work fine in both, just remember to safe remove the device when you are done in ANY OS and you will have fewer issues
2012-04-13T08:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GuestFor	the installer can make partitions
