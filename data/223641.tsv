2007-01-07T10:50:00.000Z	socorrista_ach		may someone help?
2007-01-07T10:51:00.000Z	socorrista_ach		is it possible to run windows games in linux ubuntu?
2007-01-07T10:51:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	socorrista_ach	depends on the game
2007-01-07T10:52:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	socorrista_ach	dual-boot or get a console. It's easier :)
