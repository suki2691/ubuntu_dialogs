2011-09-20T22:04:00.000Z	CosmicVoyager		Hi. I f I use the same usernam of different OSes, should I be able to move drives between them and have full read write access?
2011-09-20T22:05:00.000Z	rypervenche	CosmicVoyager	I always have.
2011-09-20T22:06:00.000Z	CosmicVoyager	rypervenche	Hmm. I gave "Ubuntu" read write access on my Mac, but I can;t read write with the Ubuntu LiveCD for which the username is Ubuntu.
