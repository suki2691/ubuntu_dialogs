2008-11-29T12:55:00.000Z	Oneiroii	ardchoille	Not disagreeing with you, but you realize that Google's top search results for Ubuntu server installs all suggest webmin?

2008-11-29T12:56:00.000Z	Oneiroii	ardchoille	Again, no disagreement from me - merely pointing out that if webmin is disadvisable, we should let the Ubu forums admins know :)
