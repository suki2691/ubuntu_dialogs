2011-08-05T11:42:00.000Z	flametai1		Does anyone have any suggestions for some advanced video editing software like Sony Vegas? I need a powerful one, not some noob shit =/ But yet free
2011-08-05T11:43:00.000Z	IdleOne	flametai1	try openshot or take a look at novacut
2011-08-05T11:43:00.000Z	IdleOne	flametai1	please also watch the language in here
2011-08-05T11:45:00.000Z	IdleOne	flametai1	apparently novacut is still not in testing phase. try openshot
