2011-08-04T19:32:00.000Z	jackalista		I'm having trouble getting wifi to connect on 11.04 on a dell latitude E6420, was given this link: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx but when I run the "lspci -vvnn | grep 14e4" command here is no output.  Does this mean I don't have broadcom wireless?  any hlpe much appreciated
