2008-02-08T18:22:00.000Z	DaDiablo		can someone help me with installing A4 Tech webcam, cause I get errors with compiling spca5xx drivers
2008-02-08T18:22:00.000Z	ikonia	DaDiablo	are the drivers not part of the kernel already
2008-02-08T18:23:00.000Z	DaDiablo	ikonia	I dunno, how may I check this?
2008-02-08T18:23:00.000Z	ikonia	DaDiablo	look at what the driver is called, and modprobe it, or look on google to see what drivers support it
