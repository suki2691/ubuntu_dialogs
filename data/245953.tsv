2006-05-13T14:21:00.000Z	shevegen		i have installed the latest dapper, now i did "apt-get install build-essentials" to get gcc. For this I had to insert the install CD again. My question is:  Is there a command to install everything on the CD on the system? (Its on another PC by the way.)
2006-05-13T14:22:00.000Z	shevegen		something like "apt-get install whole-cd-content" or so ;-)
