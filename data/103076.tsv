2010-06-10T03:38:00.000Z	vinic		i just used the pendrivelinux.com usb installer to put 10.04 on a usb stick. when i boot up it brings me to the installer boot menu fine. when i select either to run from the stick of install ubuntu to a hard disk it will quickly scroll through some loading text and then the screen goes black and never comes back up

2010-06-10T03:58:00.000Z	vinic	histo	i used startup disk creator on my netbook installation. on boot it displays a nice purple background with some icons in the lower third, then the screen goes back and never comes back. i used the "Discarded on shutdown, unless you save them elsewhere" option during creation
