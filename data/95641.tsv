2008-05-06T12:00:00.000Z	jedwards		meaning what?
2008-05-06T12:01:00.000Z	jedwards		can someone private me? this is too confusing
2008-05-06T12:02:00.000Z	patifa	jedwards	to find out how safe 8.04 is, I suggest you try the livecd.  It will increase your confidence in 8.04 if the LiveCD works in the Try Ubuntu mode.
