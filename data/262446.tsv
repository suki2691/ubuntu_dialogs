2008-06-17T15:03:00.000Z	BobDingley		If anybody can point me in the right direction, for my Login Screen, it is only showing a portion of it, i can only see Ubunt with the u cut off at the end, and the bottom of the screen is just below the section to type in username/password, can anybody tell me how to fix this?
