2008-01-17T22:12:00.000Z	Boglizk	rinaldi_	No, i haven't touched the screensaver
2008-01-17T22:13:00.000Z	rinaldi_	Boglizk	well disabling any screensaver, even the default one seemed to do the trick, it's just that it locks up when in a fullscreen game
2008-01-17T22:13:00.000Z	Boglizk	rinaldi_	Is there anything i can do, from a terminal? Or do i have to ctrlaltbackspace?
