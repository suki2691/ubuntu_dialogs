2010-04-05T17:06:00.000Z	Anarhist		hi, what tool is there to help me convert an ac3 audio file into a vorbis? oggenc doesn't take ac3
2010-04-05T17:06:00.000Z	Anarhist		ffmpeg doesn't do vbr, i've been trying to get around using it
2010-04-05T17:08:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Anarhist	then use ffmpeg to decode ac3 to wav and then oggenc to encode the wav to ogg
2010-04-05T17:10:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Anarhist	'ffmpeg -y -i song.ac3 -f wav - | oggenc -o song.ogg -'
