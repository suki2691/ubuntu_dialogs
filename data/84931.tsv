2009-09-14T16:27:00.000Z	Mamid		hello. :) I'm looking for some remote desktop help.  I have an ubuntu guru on the phone who I trust and both of us want him to get access to my desktop through a remote desktop viewer, but "remote desktop" doesn't work.  any ideas on how to do this?
2009-09-14T16:29:00.000Z	Mamid		can anyone help me?
