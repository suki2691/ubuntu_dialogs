2008-06-08T22:11:00.000Z	eracc		Hmm, I am looking for HARDWARE based SATA RAID for an *buntu system. I remember seeing a SATA RAID hardware solution that mounts in a tower's drive bays and connects a 3 drive array to a single SATA connection. Shows up to the OS as a single drive. I can't seem to find the web site now. Anyone know what I am talking about?

2008-06-08T22:13:00.000Z	sparkyy	eracc	or you can build software raid
2008-06-08T22:14:00.000Z	eracc	sparkyy	yep, I know. The specification is for hardware based RAID only though. I suppose I will just get a hardware based Adaptec controller.
