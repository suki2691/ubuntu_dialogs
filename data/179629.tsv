2007-01-05T06:03:00.000Z	MindFreak		I have a quick question for someone, how do I get FIREFOX to open local .php as html
2007-01-05T06:04:00.000Z	jrib	MindFreak	has nothing to do with firefox
2007-01-05T06:07:00.000Z	jrib	MindFreak	but you'll end up seeing  <?php echo "foo"; ?>  in your browser.  This is what you want?
2007-01-05T06:09:00.000Z	jrib	MindFreak	it will if your php file doesn't actually have any php
