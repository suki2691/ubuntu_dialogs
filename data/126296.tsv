2007-08-02T09:27:00.000Z	daynah	bauer	not to talk down, I dunno you and how much you know :) but the Ubuntu cds first run off of the comp's memory, not the harddrive, so you can see how they work without them potentially messing up your files. Beryl is really fancy video effects. Try googling it on youtube. To me, it was worth the $30 tax refund for a cheap nvidia card :)
