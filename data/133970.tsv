2007-05-16T13:36:00.000Z	teer2		someone just told me that AMD64 chips run 32-bit code already without emulation.
2007-05-16T13:37:00.000Z	teer2		hmm - any idea where I can find more information on using AMD64 for 32-bit apps?
2007-05-16T13:37:00.000Z	teer2		I am very much enjoying the 64-bit support in Ubuntu Feisty, but there are still lots of apps (mostly closed-source) that will not run on my machine
2007-05-16T13:38:00.000Z	mosibfu	teer2	there is some stuff on google, basically u have a 32bit lin vmachine in 64bit linux as far as i know, i just installed 32bit (im noob so why make it too hard)
