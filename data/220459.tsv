2008-07-15T12:54:00.000Z	Lusule		next question:  i was under the impression i need a separate root login from my normal user login, but Ubuntu install just gave me the one login.  Do I need to seperate them and how do I do it?

2008-07-16T12:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Lusule	you can check for a particular program wit which.  "which [program]"
