2008-11-01T03:26:00.000Z	DeadBattery		I am currently upgrading my Ubuntu version to 8.10.  If I stop the upgrade and continue it later, will the downloaded files remain there and start again on my next try?

2008-11-01T03:27:00.000Z	DeadBattery	Guinnesss	thanks, I hate leaving my computer on at night.  ;)
