2007-11-15T08:50:00.000Z	krisbo9000		or too many mounted file systems
2007-11-15T08:52:00.000Z	krisbo9000		guys ... is it possible to install grub onto a floppy from windows?
2007-11-15T08:54:00.000Z	offipso	krisbo9000	there might be a way to make a boot disk that can boot operating systems on the different partitions, but I dont' know if you can install it to a floppy..and if you could, if it would be useful
