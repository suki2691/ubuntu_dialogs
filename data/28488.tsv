2010-12-25T22:19:00.000Z	Musashi0011		I created a bootable usb drive using ubuntu 10.10 with my mac. Yet when I attempt to boot my laptop with it (after selecting the corresponding usb from boot-up) it just continues to load the OS from the hard driver after a few minutes.
2010-12-25T22:19:00.000Z	Musashi0011		Do I have to install grub or LILO on the usb drive?
2010-12-25T22:20:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	Musashi0011	how did you create it?
