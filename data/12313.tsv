2011-10-27T18:27:00.000Z	zykotick9	sandstrom	what is the problem exactly?  your physical memory isn't full (swap is barely being used in your paste)
2011-10-27T18:32:00.000Z	sandstrom	zykotick9	I'm trying to figure out what's using my ram! Only running mongo database (0.12gb total data size) and nginx webserver (~1 visit / minute). I can't see how they can eat so much ram?
