I want to upgrade to at least 1.5.9, or better still version 2. I've tried to use Synatpic package manager and it says it has updated it, but still reported as 1.5.4. I also tried 'sudo apt-get install firefox' but says I have the latest version already? What gives?

2007-01-27T17:40:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	bef	right - I will try that then. It is downloading now, as a tar.gz file. Hopefully it will be a deb file or something :-)
