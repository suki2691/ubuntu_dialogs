2012-01-05T23:01:00.000Z	Resistance	DoctorD	 as llutz_ says, only TLDs that are valid are routed through the net.  (.org, .net, .com, .us, .tk, etc.)
2012-01-05T23:02:00.000Z	Resistance	DoctorD	 not with .drw, because its not a TLD
2012-01-05T23:02:00.000Z	Resistance	DoctorD	 you could of course buy a domain through a registrar with some other domain extension, i.e. .com .net .org .info, etc.
