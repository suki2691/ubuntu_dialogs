2007-03-26T12:53:00.000Z	aDDe		To begin with, I am a Linux NOOB.. But you have to learn some time right? I have problems with my graphic card. I have a ATI Mob radeon 7500 but haven't been able to find any drivers for it anywhere..  Anyone know where I can find a driver? I would like an URL.. Have read so many threads about this.. but no actual driver..

2007-03-26T12:54:00.000Z	dyrne	aDDe	if you've been reading up on this im sure you already know but ati drivers on linux are not the greatest
2007-03-26T12:55:00.000Z	aDDe	dyrne	Yeah I know.. But I have also read that ppl have got it to work.. =) At the moment my beryl works just fine.. But would like to get higher resolution
