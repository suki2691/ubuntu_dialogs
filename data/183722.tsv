2006-10-29T12:56:00.000Z	snoops	Cam-	I've tried the amd64 and i386 of 6.06 and really, the amd64 is brilliant if you want to do server stuff..but I had problems with it with some applications, and some older apps didn'thave 64bit support at all..for a server I'd go with 64bit in a second.. for a desktop..not quite yet
