2006-10-29T11:34:00.000Z	jonisick		Is there a default root password for ubuntu linux?  I installed Ubuntu (my first dive into linux) and now as I'm trying to learn my way around I'm unable to switch to the root user using the bash shell su command.

2006-10-29T11:37:00.000Z	jonisick		Okay that explains it.  Thanks  Do I have all the root ability with my default account?
