2009-02-23T04:32:00.000Z	srid		hello there - I upgraded to Jaunty (9.04) and everything works except wireless: Network Manager shows list of available network, but when I select my wifi network, the connection keeps happening.. after 3 mins or so.. it failes. any idea why?

2009-02-23T04:34:00.000Z	srid	sebsebseb	thanks, i'm asking in #ubuntu+1
2009-02-23T04:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	srid	no problem
