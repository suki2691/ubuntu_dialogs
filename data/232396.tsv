2009-07-21T02:24:00.000Z	dug		I have a harddrive that is only 89% in use but it says no space left on device?
2009-07-21T02:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	dug	maybe it is too fragmented ? also 5% by default is reserved for superuser
2009-07-21T02:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	dug	use the disk analizer to chack where the space is used... maybe a kernel bug or something like that is spamming your logs
2009-07-21T02:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	dug	well then check the data generated by zoneminder... video/image files can be very big
