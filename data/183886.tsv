2006-10-17T11:57:00.000Z	Cas		I've a problem dist-upgrading, I can't remove xinit because I've unmet dependencies with x11-common, but I can't install x11-common because xinit owns some files. Does anyone has an idea how to fix this?
2006-10-17T11:58:00.000Z	talisein	Cas	try using aptitude dist-upgrade instead of apt-get
2006-10-17T12:00:00.000Z	Cas	talisein	tnx, going to try it. aptitude once messed up some things with me, but I guess I don't have a choice now
2006-10-17T12:01:00.000Z	talisein	Cas	just read what the "solution" is and see if it makes sense
