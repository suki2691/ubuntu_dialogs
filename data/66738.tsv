2009-02-13T19:44:00.000Z	oCean_	judget_	open "gconf-editor" and check apps > nautilus > preferences. There are 2 media_automount options should be ticked
2009-02-13T19:47:00.000Z	oCean_	judget_	think that the media_automount should be sufficient.
2009-02-13T19:59:00.000Z	judget_	oCean_	any other ideas?
2009-02-13T19:59:00.000Z	oCean_	judget_	sorry, not ideas atm. Rebuilding GTK might have damaged this or that. I really don't know.
