2009-11-02T19:53:00.000Z	BigMao		Hi there, I'm getting an error when trying to do a distribution upgrade.  W:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/m0sia/ppa/ubuntu/dists/karmic/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404 Not Found
2009-11-02T19:53:00.000Z	BigMao		When I visit the page with a web browser, http://ppa.launchpad.net/m0sia/ppa/ubuntu/dists/, it looks like karmic really isn't there

2009-11-02T19:56:00.000Z	BigMao	EagleScreen	I just did sudo emacs /etc/apt/sources.list :)
