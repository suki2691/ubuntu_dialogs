This is his largest complaint about ubuntu and is a big fedora fan. My question is, is this true or his he crazy? If Ubuntu DID take fedoras style is there some credits page to shoot this argument out of the water?
2006-10-29T13:35:00.000Z	progek		really? :D because his argument can get a little boring after a while but he always goes back to the same thing. How can we say the same thing about fedora?
