2009-06-29T00:38:00.000Z	gabbah		what's the easiest way to download a youtube videos audio? Preferibly, I would like to be able to just right click in youtube and have it downloaded and converted to mp3, and autonaming the file. UtubeRipper seems broken in ubuntu 9.04 :(

2009-06-29T00:39:00.000Z	gabbah	Knotty_	mm.. but then there's still the step of ripping the audio and naming the file... i'm looking for all of this to be done in just one click from youtube... so that it is "girl friend friendly usage" so to speak... :P
