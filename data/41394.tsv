2009-12-13T22:24:00.000Z	svinoba		hi,i have issue with system time. everytime i boot into ubuntu and then into fedora/slackware the system time defaults to utc
2009-12-13T22:24:00.000Z	svinoba		but system clock is set to localtime in all of the distros.
2009-12-13T22:25:00.000Z	yoyoned	svinoba	Fedora uses UTC by default.  Just have all you distros use UTC
2009-12-13T22:25:00.000Z	svinoba	yoyoned	i cant as I have vista along side. ubuntu seems to be doing what windows usually does :(
