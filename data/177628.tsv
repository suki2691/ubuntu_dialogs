2008-02-06T01:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ronny1	Ubuntu cop ?  what is that
2008-02-06T01:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ronny1	I run 32bit on everythin here.. even the 64 bit boxes
2008-02-06T01:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	ronny1	I would not say there is a problem with it.  I just dont see much speed difference (at least when I tried it)
