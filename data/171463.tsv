2007-04-23T14:19:00.000Z	easy		Hi. I am installing Ubuntu 6.*  and when I wanna install on partitions, I have 3 choices: One is "use the largest continuous free space"
2007-04-23T14:19:00.000Z	easy		what does it mean?
2007-04-23T14:19:00.000Z	easy		install in the unpartitioned space, right?
2007-04-23T14:19:00.000Z	Lattyware	easy	Yeah, but if you want to be sure, do manually partition.
