2007-08-04T07:42:00.000Z	alesan		hi do you know if X already supports the 1440x900 resolution? or do I have to do something special?
2007-08-04T07:43:00.000Z	alesan		but even if I set Modes "1440x900" in xerg.conf, I get another resolution
2007-08-04T07:44:00.000Z	Enselic	alesan	fyi, 1440x900 was autodetected for me on Gutsy
2007-08-04T07:44:00.000Z	alesan	Enselic	ok. here I have a more complex evironment
