2006-06-08T06:20:00.000Z	bernier		 i'm having a problem, everytime I try to install java or blackdown java adept stays at "preparing installation of sun-java5-bin" and it never changes
2006-06-08T06:20:00.000Z	avis	bernier	i do a apt-get instal sun-java-bin5 add a couple of symlinks and i'm through
2006-06-08T06:23:00.000Z	bernier	avis	ok ill try but the only way i can close adept is byt the X because i canot cancel while its "preparing" and after i closed it it always says theres a process in memory which is using the package system manager or something
2006-06-08T06:24:00.000Z	avis	bernier	i believe for some reason amarok integrated with it to load with files
