2008-10-21T15:43:00.000Z	balrog	veros	ubuntu is a heck of a lot more friendly to new converts
2008-10-21T15:44:00.000Z	balrog	veros	and i tell you this as somebody who learned part of his stuff on debian before being turned on to ubuntu
2008-10-21T15:46:00.000Z	balrog	veros	if you want to become a pro, i would start off with ubuntu.  if you are currently a pro and want to setup a server, i suggest debian.  if youre a pro and you want to setup a user workstation (ie: desktop), i suggest ubuntu with landscape.  and no, i dont work for or anybody affiliated with Canonical
