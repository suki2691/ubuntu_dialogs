2011-06-04T13:37:00.000Z	herman_		Hi there! I Installed picasa from deb, but it does not work. In fact, starting picasa does nothing at all (10.04)
2011-06-04T13:37:00.000Z	herman_		Familiar issue?
2011-06-04T13:37:00.000Z	KM0201	herman_	did you try starting it in terminal, to see if you get an error?
2011-06-04T13:42:00.000Z	KM0201	herman_	why on earth would you start it as root?
