2008-03-12T13:09:00.000Z	sCOTTo		hey guys - i need some help - i have played around in my new ubuntu install TOO much - as a result my filesharing is screwed - i cant browse other machines which are windows machines on the network or browse my ubuntu machine FROM the linux machines... can someone help me restore my network setup all the way back to the original settings? I wouldnt ask unless i had spent some time trying to figure it out myself

2008-03-12T13:11:00.000Z	osfameron		I've never really got samba filesharing to do anything much useful at all on my ubuntu installs
2008-03-12T13:11:00.000Z	sCOTTo	osfameron	to a degree yes - i could browse other machines on my network before...
