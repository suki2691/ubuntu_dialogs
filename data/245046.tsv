2005-03-20T16:54:00.000Z	nu2ubuntu		I have a dvd with files on it that I put into my drive in order to see if totem would play the media I have on there and now it won't eject the disc.  Is there anything I can do about this short of turning off my pc and manually ejecting it?
2005-03-20T16:55:00.000Z	mlambie	nu2ubuntu	is the disc mounted? try right-clicking on the CD icon and unmounting it
2005-03-20T16:56:00.000Z	nu2ubuntu	mlambie	no the disc is not mounted.  I tried right clicking and clicking eject and it gave me an error.  Afte the error, the disc was unmounted.  I tried remounting and ejecting again with the same result.
