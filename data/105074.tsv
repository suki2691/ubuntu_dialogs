2012-02-12T02:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Daniel-3qt32ngew	use gparted in LiveCD, or windows OS if you dual boot
2012-02-12T02:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Daniel-3qt32ngew	then you will need to tell the XP CD to delete the ubuntu partitions, either way its not an ubuntu issue
2012-02-12T02:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Daniel-3qt32ngew	ask in ##windows
