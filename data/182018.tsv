2006-06-03T14:33:00.000Z	logicalmark		Hey guys. I am not running Ubuntu Server. I am running Desktop. But I want to be able to setup a LAMP enviroment as easy as if I were running Server. Is it possible?

2006-06-03T14:34:00.000Z	logicalmark	kdean06	Do you see any reason why Server edition would not recognize my hardware like Desktop does?
2006-06-03T14:35:00.000Z	kdean06	logicalmark	I'm not too knowledgeable about the differences in the kernel, if any. I installed the server, and then added ubuntu-desktop, and it's running fine for me.
