2008-04-04T18:13:00.000Z	Professor_K	sipior	you mean that the incompatibility is generaly not definitive and that generally about six months later it becomes compatible?
2008-04-04T18:14:00.000Z	sipior	Professor_K	more or less. i believe the first-generation macbooks have supported wireless now. i'm sure the forums contain more information regarding the status of hardware support
2008-04-04T18:15:00.000Z	Professor_K	sipior	ok I will go check the forum then, I will see what I can find. Thanks anyway
