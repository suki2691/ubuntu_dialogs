2010-01-27T04:57:00.000Z	grkblood13		is 9.10 more stable than 9.04?
2010-01-27T04:58:00.000Z	chelz	grkblood13	the only distinction made is between LTS releases and non-LTS releases
2010-01-27T04:58:00.000Z	chelz	grkblood13	so 8.04 and 10.04 are LTS
2010-01-27T05:00:00.000Z	chelz	grkblood13	upgrading is fine if you've used 9.04
