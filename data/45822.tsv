2010-01-06T23:49:00.000Z	_UsUrPeR_		ok, one more time. I just updated my 9.04 server to 9.10, and I got a warning that /boot/ is full. What can I delete in there that will free up some space? For the record, apt-get autoclean/clean has no effect
2010-01-06T23:50:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	_UsUrPeR_	back it up and mount /boot to another drive or make a new partition for it, a bigger one..
2010-01-06T23:52:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	_UsUrPeR_	yes.. but the part is too small, so u could mounnt /boot to the disk that / is on.. if u have enooguh space
2010-01-06T23:53:00.000Z	ae86-drifter	_UsUrPeR_	well u will have to repartition it
