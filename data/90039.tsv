2008-06-19T19:49:00.000Z	jc___	nixnoob	I'm having the same troubles
2008-06-19T19:49:00.000Z	nixnoob	jc___	so it must be a problem with the package itself in the repos.... must be corrupt or something....
2008-06-19T19:50:00.000Z	jc___	nixnoob	I hope not, I just did a remove and trying a reinstall to see if it gets fixed, if its a package I'm without openoffice until it gets fixed
