2007-06-09T13:44:00.000Z	visor		do you guys know if there are compiz 0.4 binaries around? I've tried beryl but i just dont like it, too many configuration settings and stuff, i like better compiz but the default version in repos is 0.3

2007-06-09T13:45:00.000Z	visor	Jordan_U	i have already checked that out on their site, its an external repo but it has 0.3 version :(
