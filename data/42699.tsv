2009-11-29T06:58:00.000Z	gluonman		I just put a new hard drive into my computer. When I start the computer, it's significantly louder than the other hard drive that was already in the computer. What can I use in Ubuntu that might help me diagnose the hard drive and see if the noise levels are a concern or not?
