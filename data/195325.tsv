2011-08-14T10:55:00.000Z	melvincv		Hi everyone, I'm having trouble using Microsoft fonts from my Windows XP installation in Ubuntu. LibreOffice doesn't list the fonts...
2011-08-14T10:57:00.000Z	melvincv		OpenOffice used to list the fonts when I copied the ttf fonts to the /usr/share/fonts/truetype dir... what happened now?
2011-08-14T10:58:00.000Z	milamber	melvincv	what version of ubuntu? and did you remove ooo to install libreoffice?
