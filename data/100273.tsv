2008-02-16T03:22:00.000Z	mad_max02		I have this strange high frequency sound coming out of my case. I'm sure its pcspeaker. I muted him in alsa-mixer and removed and blacklisted mod. Anyone have any other idea ? I dont wanna disconnect it from mobo.

2008-02-16T03:22:00.000Z	doc|work	mad_max02	I'd just remove it, it's not like they're useful anyway
2008-02-16T03:23:00.000Z	mad_max02	doc|work	yeah but I dont wanna do that as only solution.
