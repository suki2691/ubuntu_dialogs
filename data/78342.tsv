2010-05-09T02:29:00.000Z	maco	bodom	CloudMonkee: there's also the Ubuntu Reviewers team. the team exists to go through existing patches attached bugs (1800-2000) and review the patch for 1) being able to apply 2) correctness 3) regression potential, then forward them upstream if they're good. if you can read & understand a bit of code, you could be very helpful there
