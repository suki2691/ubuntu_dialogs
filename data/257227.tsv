2004-11-24T17:00:00.000Z	Nart		hello, my ubuntu install takes forever on boot on 'Configuring Network Interfaces', and after it boots, my onboard LAN doesnt work... I'm running an Athlon64 with Giabit Lan of an nForce3 250gb chipset... anyone ran through this?
2004-11-24T17:02:00.000Z	Nart		installed nForce drivers, enabled it, moved forcedeth into blacklist and still nothing :(
2004-11-24T17:02:00.000Z	LifesizeKenDoll	Nart	what blacklist?
2004-11-24T17:05:00.000Z	Nart	LifesizeKenDoll	sorry /etc/hotplug/blacklist
