2009-02-05T03:15:00.000Z	Peddyt		where should .so files usually be?
2009-02-05T03:16:00.000Z	Slart	Peddyt	they can be almost anywhere... there's no special place for them
2009-02-05T03:16:00.000Z	Peddyt	Slart	and DasEi, a program said 'error opening shared library... could not find...', but I moved the .so to /usr/lib, now it works. Thanks :)
2009-02-05T03:17:00.000Z	Slart	Peddyt	ah.. good
