2004-11-09T09:37:00.000Z	ChibaPet		So, I just installed Ubuntu on my laptop, and two really unfortunate things happened. 1) It installed GRUB into my MBR, losing my ability to boot into NetBSD. 2) It seems to have neglected to ask me for a root password....... Anyone seen this second item before? Is there a default?
