2008-10-17T07:00:00.000Z	julioso		hey folks, I have Ubuntu 8.04 installed on my system, and I need to install Windows XP as well to run some engineering software. I have 6 hard drives, so I may as well use one of them for Windows. I know that if I install Windows with all the drives hooked up, it'll overwrite the GRUB boot loader on my system drive; if I disconnect all the drives but the Windows drive, however, it'll have to...
2008-10-17T07:00:00.000Z	julioso		...install the windows boot loader to the Windows drive. Anyone know if that'll work (i.e. will I still be able to boot into Windows after re-connecting my Ubuntu drive?)
2008-10-17T07:00:00.000Z	julioso		and sorry for the long message, haha
