2005-05-14T16:11:00.000Z	Brunellus		ok, will someone help me out on a network printing issue?
2005-05-14T16:11:00.000Z	fallstorm	Brunellus	it's typically best to just ask your question and if someone can help, they will
2005-05-14T16:13:00.000Z	fallstorm	Brunellus	probably a firewall issue
2005-05-14T16:13:00.000Z	Brunellus	fallstorm	 I don't see how--I used to run this just fine
