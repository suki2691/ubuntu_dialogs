2012-05-10T15:02:00.000Z	LjL	mafiaboy	like all other software, by using Software Center, apt-get or Synaptic
2012-05-10T15:03:00.000Z	LjL	mafiaboy	yes it is, i've just checked on my computer
2012-05-10T15:04:00.000Z	LjL	mafiaboy	uhm, actually packages.ubuntu.com doesn't give it. i see it in my apt-get though
