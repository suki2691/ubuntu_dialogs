2007-08-01T05:58:00.000Z	seamus7	Amon-san	what error message do you see before logging out?
2007-08-01T06:00:00.000Z	seamus7	Amon-san	I've had an issue like that but I receive an error message regarding "ICE authority" so since you're not receiving any message I'm not sure if it's related ...
2007-08-01T06:03:00.000Z	seamus7	Amon-san	in my case, I had to delet some configuration files in my home directory .. usually under gnome ... and I deleted ICE athority ... this fixed my problem in both cases ... i wish I could be more specific
