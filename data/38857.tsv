2010-01-19T08:32:00.000Z	abumaia		I'm having trouble with my monitor.  My screensaver is turned off, power management is set to never turn the monitor off, and there are no BIOS settings regarding monitor power management.  However, my monitor is still turning off after 30 minutes idle.  Where else can I look for the setting causing this?
