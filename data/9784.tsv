2011-09-04T09:36:00.000Z	HypothesisFrog		Hi. xorg is constantly taking up about 98% of cpu. How can that be?
2011-09-04T09:37:00.000Z	tbocs	HypothesisFrog	wow. Does that persist after you reboot?
2011-09-04T09:37:00.000Z	HypothesisFrog	tbocs	haven't tried rebooting. Just noticed that according to top, xorg is on 98% since last night.
2011-09-04T09:38:00.000Z	tbocs	HypothesisFrog	well then I think that really depends on what else you are running.
