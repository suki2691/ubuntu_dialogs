2010-05-06T07:29:00.000Z	Ibag		I need a bit of help with the MySQL piece of a brand new install of Ubuntu server.  Am I in the right place?
2010-05-06T07:30:00.000Z	Ibag		I'm trying to run mysql -u root - give me "Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)'
2010-05-06T07:32:00.000Z	Ibag		I haven't done anything to the MySQL config - I'll try that mysql_secure_install and the mysql -u root -p
2010-05-06T07:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ibag	why are you logged in as root?
