2009-09-25T22:40:00.000Z	void_pointer	ZooK	what is it you want to do?
2009-09-25T22:44:00.000Z	void_pointer	ZooK	you want to copy from the ubuntu root directory to another hard drive/device
2009-09-25T22:45:00.000Z	void_pointer	ZooK	well, Halitech was right first time then probably. You can use "sudo cp /<files> /<destination>
