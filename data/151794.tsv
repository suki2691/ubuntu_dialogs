2007-01-03T16:50:00.000Z	ttheikkila		should I install mythtv or try dvb-utils with my DVB-T -card on Ubuntu 6.10?
2007-01-03T16:51:00.000Z	fluvvell	ttheikkila	which brand of card is it?
2007-01-03T16:54:00.000Z	ttheikkila	fluvvell	it is airsat2 dvb-t -card with flexcop -chip, recognized by the system.
2007-01-03T16:55:00.000Z	fluvvell	ttheikkila	I'd lean towards myth-tv, but there is a bit to do in the setup.
