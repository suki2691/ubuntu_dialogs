2004-12-20T07:55:00.000Z	art_illery		i hope someone could help me with a little trouble i am trying to solve since almost 2 hours with the Synaptic Package manager. It doesnt give any error or anything, yet it doesnt seem to download anything at all. I am starting to think i have mad cow disease *-<8-P=-
2004-12-20T07:55:00.000Z	art_illery		maybe an NAT problem
2004-12-20T07:57:00.000Z	art_illery		ok, when i click update Packages, a window appears sazing downloading File 4of4, then it closes again after a few seconds, and back i am at an unchanged screen in the Packet manager reading no pakets to install
2004-12-20T07:57:00.000Z	thenuke	art_illery	try sudo apt-get update at console
