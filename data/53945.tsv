2009-06-22T19:45:00.000Z	Darck1	tvasht	I'm having the same problem  - I started messing around with dual monitors and now, no matter what i do to my xorg.conf it resets my resolution to 800x600 everytime I restart X
2009-06-22T19:46:00.000Z	tvasht	Darck1	and there is nothing wrong in the xconf
2009-06-22T19:47:00.000Z	Darck1	tvasht	I wouldn't go that far - lol, I'm fairly stupid about these things
