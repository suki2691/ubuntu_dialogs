2009-10-13T17:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Danielpk	 mysql server configs have settings to define what range of ip's and users, and so on can connect. check the config files/mysql dics.
2009-10-13T17:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Danielpk	 perhaps a 'listen to'   setting in the config file.
2009-10-13T17:18:00.000Z	Danielpk	Dr_Willis	i will check.
