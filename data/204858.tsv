2005-12-11T08:28:00.000Z	whatthedeuce		My computers (I've tried it on two) can't boot from the Linux live cd.  Is there anything I have to do to the iso before burning it?  I've changed my bios settings, but it still won't boot from the cd
2005-12-11T08:28:00.000Z	hammerabi	whatthedeuce	does it boot other cds?
2005-12-11T08:29:00.000Z	hammerabi	whatthedeuce	no, just configure your bios to boot the cd, and burn it correctly
2005-12-11T08:33:00.000Z	hammerabi	whatthedeuce	that depends entirely on what windows software you are using
