2006-07-01T11:36:00.000Z	jrleek		I have the same filesystem problem, I automount a Fat32 drive, but I can't get write permissions as a user
2006-07-01T11:38:00.000Z	jrleek		Win32 doesn't actually have any permission system you know.
2006-07-01T11:38:00.000Z	jrleek		It's in my fstab....  I'll try changing the command line args.  Thanks
