2009-10-01T00:03:00.000Z	grawity	ScottG	Depends on the regex library - but usually yes, it's just a character.
2009-10-01T00:05:00.000Z	ScottG	grawity	If you have something like [7-9] does that include the 7 and 9 or only what is in between them (in this case just 8)?
2009-10-01T00:05:00.000Z	grawity	ScottG	[7-9] includes 7, 9, and everything in between.
