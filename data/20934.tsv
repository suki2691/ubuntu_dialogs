2011-01-04T16:26:00.000Z	Gnea	linux_direction	no, they are 2 mutully exclusive distributions
2011-01-04T16:26:00.000Z	Gnea	linux_direction	you could backup /home and port it from one distribution to another, but beyond that, no :)
2011-01-04T17:00:00.000Z	linux_direction	Gnea	when you told me i could port my /home. is that the term used for transfer?
