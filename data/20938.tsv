2011-10-16T04:58:00.000Z	richthegeek		I'm having trouble changing compiz setting with CCSM - is that now deprecated, or am I encountering a bug?
2011-10-16T04:59:00.000Z	Ph0t0nix	richthegeek	I've used CSSM without problems today, so I think it's still OK
2011-10-16T04:59:00.000Z	richthegeek	Ph0t0nix	odd - any changes I make don't take affect, and if I use the "reset to defaults" button unity dies entirely
2011-10-16T05:02:00.000Z	Ph0t0nix	richthegeek	I didn't touch those settings. Just enabled the cube
