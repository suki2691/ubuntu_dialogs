2011-05-02T16:54:00.000Z	jjlee	jcmarini	what are you doing to try to burn DVDs?  What happened when you did that?
2011-05-02T16:59:00.000Z	jcmarini	jjlee	braseo and gnome burner give message; no media when i put blank dvd in
2011-05-02T17:04:00.000Z	jcmarini	jjlee	do some blank dvds just not get recognised because of some reason in manufacture?
