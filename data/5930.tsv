2012-02-06T00:40:00.000Z	rubdos		Can anybody give me (a link for) a laptop for $680 / â‚¬520, with (preferably) no os or a linux system? I'm going FULLY for design/style. Components are second place (altough I need a working network card :p). I fell in love with the Apple macbook look. But I don't like the logo at the back nor the OS :-)

2012-02-06T00:41:00.000Z	rubdos	Zal	I don't like the price either :)
2012-02-06T00:42:00.000Z	Zal	rubdos	yeah, I like thinkbooks, but they ain't cheap
