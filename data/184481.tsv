2007-04-05T15:35:00.000Z	peepsalot		i don't understand what the differences between the free vmware apps are, player and server
2007-04-05T15:35:00.000Z	ra	peepsalot	player is smaller and only plays.. it was the first free product
2007-04-05T15:36:00.000Z	peepsalot	ra	so would it be better to get server?  it can do everything that player can?
