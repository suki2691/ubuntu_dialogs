2008-05-07T10:01:00.000Z	undecim		Hey, everyone, I have a question about chroot....
2008-05-07T10:03:00.000Z	undecim		if I were to create a chroot environment and give someone root access to that environment, would they be able to do anything at all to my computer?
2008-05-07T10:04:00.000Z	undecim		So, they couldn't for example, mess with my running kernel?
2008-05-07T10:04:00.000Z	patifa	undecim	They could load modules into the kernel.
