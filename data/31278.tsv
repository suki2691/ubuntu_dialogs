2010-05-28T21:47:00.000Z	Njh		is there any easy way to convert binary sources into debian packages?
2010-05-28T21:49:00.000Z	guntbert	Njh	what are "binary sources" ? thats a contradiction in itself
2010-05-28T21:50:00.000Z	Njh	guntbert	i have a program that i have created that creates a binary, but i want to be able to make it a debian package so that i dont have to manually do dependencies
2010-05-28T21:51:00.000Z	guntbert	Njh	sorry - I have to go :-(
