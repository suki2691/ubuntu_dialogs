2011-10-09T11:05:00.000Z	llutz_	RobbieCrash	cron-syntax sound right, so if your zfs.. works it should. you should consider using full pathes in cronjobs
2011-10-09T11:06:00.000Z	RobbieCrash	llutz	so do @reboot sleep 60; /sbin/zfs mount ZFS?
2011-10-09T11:07:00.000Z	llutz_	RobbieCrash	to be on the safe side, yes. cron runs in a limited environment, so you have to make sure binaries were found
