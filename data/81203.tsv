2008-12-20T01:20:00.000Z	Vooloo		I've had windows XP disc crash, is it possible to create a rescue disc with ubuntu or other linux distro where I can get the files from the harddrive that are still readable?
2008-12-20T01:21:00.000Z	Neaai	Vooloo	yes. use the install/liveCD and access the hard drive from there.
2008-12-20T01:22:00.000Z	Neaai	Vooloo	it's not hard at all. doubleclicking does the trick, and for the transfer, drag-n-drop does the other trick.
2008-12-20T01:24:00.000Z	Neaai	Vooloo	basically, stick an usb drive in place, insert the livecd in the drive, reboot, and start transfering once you're in the live environment.
