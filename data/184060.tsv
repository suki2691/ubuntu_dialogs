2006-05-30T15:51:00.000Z	spope		I have changed my screen using xvidtune. Now, where do I add the changes, so I don't have to do it again?

2006-05-30T15:56:00.000Z	spope	Soir	hmm, doesn't look like something I recognize... On mandrake I just added the output to XF86Config, but that's nowhere to be found...
