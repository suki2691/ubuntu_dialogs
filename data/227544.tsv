2007-03-25T06:35:00.000Z	Jowi	Obidose	yes. but if windows is on the primary disk you will need a way to boot linux. that means installing a bootloader on MBR (Master Boot Record) that overwrites windows bootloader. the windows install will be intact but its bootloader will be overwritten.

2007-03-25T06:37:00.000Z	Jowi	Obidose	yes. you will get options on where to install linux.
