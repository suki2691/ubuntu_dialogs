2009-03-23T23:15:00.000Z	ZoOl007		hello all - I'm looking for information on corporate gnome/ubuntu deployments. I need info on prestaging user environments, automated installations. Does anyone over here has users on linux on an ad domain? Can someone point me to a correct channel? thx
2009-03-23T23:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ZoOl007	oh Active Direcotry domain?
2009-03-23T23:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ZoOl007	sure Windows server and Linux servers could work together.  ,but Windows server hum I woudn't use that :)
2009-03-23T23:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ZoOl007	what you want to know is not distro specific,  so going to this channel would make sense #linux
