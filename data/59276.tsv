2010-02-20T03:10:00.000Z	vuf		how do i make a samba share writable through the gui? "read only" checkbox appears to be missing (ubuntu 9.10)
2010-02-20T03:10:00.000Z	Gaudi	vuf	have you tried the gksu nautilus command?
2010-02-20T03:11:00.000Z	vuf	Gaudi	it's the connecting client that does not have write access
2010-02-20T03:11:00.000Z	Gaudi	vuf	then I am afraid that's under my knowledge, ask in the channel again they might be able to help you
