2008-02-09T00:22:00.000Z	Wouter		i have a question. I have 2 hdd's, 1 has two partitions C: and D: where C: is windows. The other one has just been formatted. On that one I want to install Ubuntu is that possible or will it erase/corrupt the data on the other HDD?
2008-02-09T00:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Wouter	  I would delete D partition , in the installer I would do manual, create /  which is root, /home  plus a swap
2008-02-09T00:25:00.000Z	Wouter	Jack_Sparrow	DRebbellion: but deleting D:  wil erase the data wont it? :P
