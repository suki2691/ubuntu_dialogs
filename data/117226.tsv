2007-10-19T21:26:00.000Z	SNy		My gutsy gibbon experience so far: xorg and mga is broken, no 1680x1050 on Dell 2007WFP. Gcc installed, but not-working due to missing libc-dev. Azureus is broken.
2007-10-19T21:27:00.000Z	pike_	SNy	azureus is ok but id recommend ktorrent or deluge or any number of non java clients. ati.. yeah thats still a problem often
2007-10-19T21:28:00.000Z	SNy	pike_	Azureus is NOT ok. It crashes out-of-the-box.
2007-10-19T21:29:00.000Z	SNy	pike_	Also, mga (matrox) not ATi. Prior version on debian worked just fine.
