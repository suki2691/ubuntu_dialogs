2009-02-21T00:18:00.000Z	shifty5		and the cdrom is not necisarrly bad, some just handle it better
2009-02-21T00:18:00.000Z	shifty5		yes but the firmware on the cdrom isn't
2009-02-21T00:18:00.000Z	burkmat	shifty5	That's quite the odd theory. :P having a hard time picturing a cd-drive analyzing the data...
