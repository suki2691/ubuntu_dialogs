2012-04-26T07:31:00.000Z	dcoy		Hi, I'm trying to get Conky to work on Xubuntu.  I try to find the dir /usr/share/doc/conky/examples/, but the "examples" folder isn't there, and i need to edit the file .conkyrc.  Any ideas?
2012-04-26T07:33:00.000Z	dcoy		That's the file I can't find.  Do I just need to download that file somewhere online, create an "examples" folder myself, and go from there?
