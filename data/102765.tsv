2009-07-22T11:11:00.000Z	onexused		when I download updates.

2009-07-22T11:14:00.000Z	onexused	mark[oz]	I did manage to pick a mirror there that will be used for most updates.  For some reason, some are still trying to download from security.ubuntu.com instead of gtlib.gatech.edu where the rest of the stuff does.
