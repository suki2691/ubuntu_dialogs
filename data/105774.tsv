2009-11-28T07:44:00.000Z	shaggyoaf		Hi, everybody. I just upgraded to jaunty and I can't seem to find the linux-restricted-modules package for the kernel I'm running (2.6.31-15-generic)
2009-11-28T07:44:00.000Z	shaggyoaf		any hints?
2009-11-28T07:44:00.000Z	shaggyoaf		I'd also settle for being told about a utility to un-do the X-org config changes that happened when I selected the restricted driver
