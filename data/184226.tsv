2006-06-16T13:34:00.000Z	wweasel		Hey, anyone know much about fonts in Linux? I imported some from my windows partition, but they don't have the variations (Windows doesn't really require them). Linux does, so I can't use bold/italic with them.  Can I create the required font variations from the base font? I know OO.o is doing this automatically.

2006-06-16T13:38:00.000Z	wweasel		how is alien dangerous? could I get a second opinion on this? is alien "a very dangerous program"?
