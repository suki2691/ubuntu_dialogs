2009-08-17T21:34:00.000Z	[t0rc]		I have multiple e-mail addresses and I like to use Thunderbird to aggregate them, the checking, etc. Sometimes I use Windows though and like to check things there. Sometimes I use Ubuntu and check things here. Anyone have suggestions as to how I can synchronize the data in Thunderbird so I can see the same e-mails in both OS (as well as deletes affecting both inboxes, etc.) ?

2009-08-17T21:39:00.000Z	BrianE	[t0rc]	"/home/username/.mozilla-thunderbird", you'll see a folder with a random name like "dja185jq.default"... That's the folder you'll need to symlink
