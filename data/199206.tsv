2007-09-14T05:20:00.000Z	ben_		I've got various external hard drives or volumes mounted or unmounted at varying times. When I start Feisty (GNOME), if one of these isn't mounted a gap in my workspace icons where it used to be is left. If I then mount that volume, it doesn't fill the gap but places itself underneath all my other icons. Basically it makes for a messy desktop and I keep having to "Clean up by Name". Is there...

2007-09-14T05:22:00.000Z	ben_	Frogzoo	I want them to be there, I just want things to remain lined up when the mounted volumes chop and change. There's no point in GNOME leaving a gap where one of the icons was if it's not going to fill the gap when that icon comes back
