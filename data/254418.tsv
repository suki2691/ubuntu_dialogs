2005-03-16T07:39:00.000Z	martinald		i have a problem
2005-03-16T07:39:00.000Z	martinald		basically, i'm using novell linux desktop 9 and i absolutely love it, but i'm getting a bit frustrated with the lack of new software on it (most packages are quite old... 1 year or so)
2005-03-16T07:39:00.000Z	monoxide	martinald	what would this problem be?
