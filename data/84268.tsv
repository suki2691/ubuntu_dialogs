2008-07-28T16:33:00.000Z	Ghufran		can anyone tell me the advantages and disadvantages of installing 64bit version of ubuntu on my 64 bit machine
2008-07-28T16:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Ghufran	how much ram do you have
2008-07-28T16:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Ghufran	you've not really got a real reason to use 64bit then
2008-07-28T16:34:00.000Z	Ghufran	ikonia	why? .. the only reason to get 64bit version would be to get memory addressing to work?
