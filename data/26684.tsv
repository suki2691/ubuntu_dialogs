2010-09-02T00:34:00.000Z	SOS		can someone tell me how to md5checksum my ubuntu cd with the windows version? jrib told me to do it like it was possible, but all I see this utility is capable of is files, not drives

2010-09-02T00:35:00.000Z	SOS	Pici	I can't boot off the cd. This is why I was told to md5checksum LOL
