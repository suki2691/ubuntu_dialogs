2008-09-22T17:29:00.000Z	philippe	DasEi1	That would be highly unlikely as the catalyst driver for Linux does not support the Radeon 7000 that ionstorm66 has
2008-09-22T17:32:00.000Z	philippe	DasEi1	it's useless for ubuntu
2008-09-22T17:33:00.000Z	philippe	DasEi1	indeed but support is not the same. Check http://ati.amd.com/support/driver.html for linux and radeon 7000
