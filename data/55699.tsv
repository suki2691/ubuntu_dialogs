2009-06-12T09:24:00.000Z	Threetimes		Hi, ubuntu is using 700 mb ram, I can't figure out why.
2009-06-12T09:25:00.000Z	Threetimes		Xorg uses 120, Opera uses 50, compiz uses 20, and mysql uses 20
2009-06-12T09:25:00.000Z	Threetimes		anything else uses less that 10
2009-06-12T09:25:00.000Z	Dev_u_pper	Threetimes	is there a process that is wasting 700MB of memory, or are you actually short 700MB or RAM?
