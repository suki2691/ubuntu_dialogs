2009-09-18T00:46:00.000Z	karlp		what's the "right" way of mounting filesystems from another ubuntu machine?  In the past I had machineA with samba shares, and machine B ran windows
2009-09-18T00:46:00.000Z	karlp		I've tried sshfs, but it's not as fast as the samba shares were
2009-09-18T00:46:00.000Z	karlp		and samba feels even slower
2009-09-18T00:46:00.000Z	grawity	karlp	NFS, maybe?
