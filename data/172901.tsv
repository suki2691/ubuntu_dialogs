2007-10-04T13:32:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	Madpilot	so if you've installed extra packages which aren't on the cd and don't have an internet connection, you may run into dependency problems
2007-10-04T13:32:00.000Z	Madpilot	howlingmadhowie	yes - the CD is good for kernel/Gnome/OOo/GIMP and some of the other large standard packages, though
2007-10-04T14:08:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	Madpilot	almost. it's actually called hairy hardon, erm, i mean hardy heron
