2006-03-31T17:49:00.000Z	mlaci		hey guys! i'm thinking on changing to ubuntu from debian. the only thing i'm worried about is constant upgrading. i'm currently using debian unstable and new packages get updated every day. is there anything equivalent regarding ubuntu?

2006-03-31T17:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	mlaci	Check in #ubuntu+1
