2009-08-29T04:19:00.000Z	salty-horse	master_	what's a "dualboot one"? can you be more specific?
2009-08-29T04:20:00.000Z	master_	salty-horse	i have a acer with kubuntu and ubuntu 9.04 installed in a dualboot...the kubuntu side is not working correctly
2009-08-29T04:20:00.000Z	salty-horse	master_	so you want to remove kubuntu? and prevent the grub menu from showing?
