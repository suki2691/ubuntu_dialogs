2012-11-18T06:54:00.000Z	Shadowix		hi is it possible to install ubuntu server without creating any user(as it is asking for one), just using root by default
2012-11-18T06:55:00.000Z	Shadowix		yes dr_willis, but i would like to do only a root user for testing purpose, possible?
2012-11-18T06:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	Shadowix	 no idea...
2012-11-18T06:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	Shadowix	 i wonder why you are using a netmask of 255.255.252.0 when its just a local lan,
