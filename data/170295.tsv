2006-08-22T05:32:00.000Z	weirdo		on the disc
2006-08-22T05:33:00.000Z	lupine_85	weirdo	once you've run "wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/x/xorg-server/xserver-xorg-core_1.0.2-0ubuntu10.1_i386.deb", it'll be right in front of you
2006-08-22T06:03:00.000Z	lupine_85	weirdo	it can't be on your CD then. Have you got any way of transferring the file to your laptop from the pc you're on now?
