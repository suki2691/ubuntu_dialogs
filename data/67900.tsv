2009-01-22T15:57:00.000Z	ezerhoden	FazLeeeN	you mean something like iwconfig eth1 essid <essid> key <key> ?
2009-01-22T15:58:00.000Z	FazLeeeN	ezerhoden	yeah
2009-01-22T15:59:00.000Z	ezerhoden	FazLeeeN	ok, well there you go. that should do it. i believe dhclient eth1 or whatever your device name is will then request an ip address once connected.
