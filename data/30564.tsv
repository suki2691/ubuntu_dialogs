2011-01-08T10:00:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	Sc00t3r	I can choose speakers or headphones below.
2011-01-08T10:01:00.000Z	Sc00t3r	q_a_z_steve	Check lower down at 'Connector', and ensure it's set to 'Analog Speakers', or try another option under that menu.
2011-01-08T10:05:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	Sc00t3r	I looked and connector is only analog output or analog headphones. I tried every option under Hardware, tested speakers each time, no dice.
