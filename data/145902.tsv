2007-03-07T08:06:00.000Z	Vilhelms		Hey, I'm having an issue where 1 out of 3 boots it crashes in the middle of booting and I can't figure out how to debug the problem. If I boot in recovery mode it always seems to boot fine, but sometimes it just crashes about 1/4 of the way on the progress bar without any error or display. It just stops doing anything. Could anyone point me as to where I could find logs or something to help debug the problem? I tried looking online but couldn't find anythi
