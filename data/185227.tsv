2007-01-23T08:13:00.000Z	opapo		I can get WPA to work at work, but I can't get WEP to work at home.
2007-01-23T08:13:00.000Z	opapo		What am I doing wrong?
2007-01-23T08:14:00.000Z	BULLE	opapo	no idea, but why not just stick to WPA at home aswell, WEP is in many cases pretty easy to break trough
2007-01-23T08:15:00.000Z	opapo	BULLE	I only have the WEP key for the access point at home
