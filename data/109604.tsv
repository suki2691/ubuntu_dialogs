2008-02-05T18:02:00.000Z	xal2		I just tried playing Tuxracer under Ubuntu and the game seems very laggy, as in a low framerate. Is there something I need to enable to make it run more smoothly?
2008-02-05T18:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	xal2	 you installed the 3d video card drivers for your video card? (what is your video card?)
2008-02-05T18:07:00.000Z	xal2	Dr_Willis	there used to be settings in x.org that are no longer available. (This was in Ubuntu 6.10). I haven't seen them in the latest version of Ubuntu.
