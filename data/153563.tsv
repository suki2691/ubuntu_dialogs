2007-01-11T14:41:00.000Z	Falstius		I have an old thinkpad (iSeries 1452) that I wanted to install linux on, but every distro I tried couldn't handle the cdrom or harddrive (so got one or the other).  So I'm finally resorting to win2k which seems to be installing smoothly ... It is really annoying (all my other machines run Linux).  Has anyone gotten around such problems?
