2007-01-05T13:17:00.000Z	vega-	threeonefour	that's a little too common name for someone to know what it should contain ...
2007-01-05T13:18:00.000Z	vega-	threeonefour	yes, a jar is a java archive
2007-01-05T13:18:00.000Z	vega-	threeonefour	it contains java class and source files and possible other stuff too
