2011-07-11T05:50:00.000Z	Polah	why-not	I have a webserver and I was looking around through SSH and noticed that my home directory had something like 900GB usage while I've only used 15GB myself. I figure it's some setup where there's a filesystem there but a virtual system on top for each user and they can only really access their own. I was interested on the setup and benefits of this and wanted to look into setting it up for my own server
