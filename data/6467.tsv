2012-06-16T10:44:00.000Z	flowerpot	riz0n	what specific issue are you having?
2012-06-16T10:46:00.000Z	riz0n	flowerpot	OK here is the problem. I have an aging Ubuntu server that I set up in 2008, running 8.04 LTS. I took the 10.04 LTS when it came out through synaptics. Well, as you can imagine, this drive is aging. I have a new system with multi-cores and RAID configuration and I have set up 12.04 in a virtual machine. I created the user accounts, then SCP'd the files over, I copied my bind9 files
