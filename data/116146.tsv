2008-01-04T05:05:00.000Z	lhoerste		Is there a way to set up dialup without an internet connection or another computer?

2008-01-04T05:07:00.000Z	lhoerste	zcat[1]	my friend just called me and knows nothing about Linux but installed Ubuntu and wants to connect via dialup. is that pretty much hopeless then? Ubuntu doesn't support dialup out of the box?
