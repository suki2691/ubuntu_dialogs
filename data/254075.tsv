2005-01-02T08:58:00.000Z	BrettMeister		Thanks!
2005-01-02T08:59:00.000Z	BrettMeister		I have read the docs on the Ubunto site.  When using partitionmagic to set up, how many partitions should I set aside for this linux distro?
2005-01-02T08:59:00.000Z	CheatersRealm	BrettMeister	you could leave 1 of unpartitioned space
