2008-08-05T13:53:00.000Z	negge	i2adoo	I don't think so
2008-08-05T13:54:00.000Z	negge	i2adoo	why would yuo wanna do that? You can't do much with your computer until an OS has booted
2008-08-05T13:55:00.000Z	i2adoo	negge	Because GRUB is giving me a bit of a problem. I start the computer and it just loops output of GRUB on the whole screen.
