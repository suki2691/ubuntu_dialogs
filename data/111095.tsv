I want to controll some apps that need graphical interfaces (i know of ssh and so, but i rly need graphical soulutions this time). The problem is that i have to config them while some other ppl is looking at a movie, so basicly i need two desktops, one for local display (the tv) and one for remote uses. Can i do this?
