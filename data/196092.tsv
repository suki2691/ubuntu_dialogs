2006-03-11T10:33:00.000Z	sbalneav	dyggMerald	Odd.  Might be worth everyone's while to file a bug report.  I'd also (if you can) attach a pdf that gives you particular trouble.
2006-03-11T10:38:00.000Z	dyggMerald	sbalneav	i think i can reproduce this error with nearly all pdfs .. i'll look into the output .. if there is any
