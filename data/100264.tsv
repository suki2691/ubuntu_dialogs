2008-06-02T21:08:00.000Z	DRebellion	mad_max02	well, proposed have not been as thoroughly tested as the other repos, so you are more vulnerable to bugs, security flaws, etc.
2008-06-02T21:09:00.000Z	DRebellion	mad_max02	you could download the package from packages.ubuntu.com and install it without enabling the proposed repo.
2008-06-02T21:09:00.000Z	mad_max02	DRebellion	wow that was a nice one. thanks for this dude
