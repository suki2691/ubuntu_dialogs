2010-06-04T12:48:00.000Z	stanmancan		I'm running an nvidia gtx-260 in ubuntu 10.04. I've enabled the restricted drivers. Is there no way to enable desktop effects when using the nvidia driver? THey work when the drivers aren't enabled, but once I enable them I can't turn on the desktop effects anymore.
