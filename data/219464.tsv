2008-09-08T09:56:00.000Z	HeMan		Hi! Can GRUB change memory timing or such?
2008-09-08T09:57:00.000Z	HeMan		When I start memtest from GRUB i finds lots of errors but when I start it from syslinux (on a USB stick) it doesn't find any error

2008-09-08T09:59:00.000Z	HeMan	Flannel	any ideas on my problem then?
