2012-06-05T03:14:00.000Z	Macaroni		does anyone know if Opera's private browsing function writes anything (cookies, history etc) to the hard drive, then deletes it when you quit the session, or is everything kept in RAM?

2012-06-05T03:15:00.000Z	ShinyObjects		Or make everything in ~/.opera (or wherever it keeps its stuff) read only while it's running and find out :)
2012-06-05T03:16:00.000Z	Macaroni	ShinyObjects	i might try that, thanks
