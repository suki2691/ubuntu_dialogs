2006-04-29T15:07:00.000Z	wy		I'm looking for something like screen, which can let Emacs frontends to be detached from the editing work. And later another emacs can attach to it.
2006-04-29T15:08:00.000Z	gnomefreak	wy	cant you run emacs in screen?
2006-04-29T15:09:00.000Z	wy	gnomefreak	 Yes. But sometimes I want to switch from emacs -nw to emacs with X without quitting the editing session
