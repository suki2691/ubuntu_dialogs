2010-10-26T06:52:00.000Z	tortoise	MechanicalYeti	was that directed to me?
2010-10-26T06:53:00.000Z	tortoise	MechanicalYeti	That's alright, but how do I do that? Because it's asking for a root@127.0.0.1's password?
2010-10-26T06:55:00.000Z	tortoise	MechanicalYeti	Wouldn't that just change my own root password? Or is 127.0.0.1 the same as me?
