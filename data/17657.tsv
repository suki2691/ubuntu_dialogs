2011-03-18T17:46:00.000Z	[segfault]	[eXception]	go ahead and ask your question, all on one line, if possible and someone will help if they know the answer.
2011-03-18T17:51:00.000Z	[segfault]	[eXception]	are you sure that your system is using syslogd and not rsyslog?  I think the newer Ubuntus use rsyslog, and you will find the default configuration under /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf
