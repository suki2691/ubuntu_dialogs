2011-05-17T12:26:00.000Z	FCGreg	FloatingGoat	It might be affected IIRC, but I haven't researched this myself.  how did you upgrade it?
2011-05-17T12:26:00.000Z	FloatingGoat	FCGreg	I haven't upgraded, im just wondering if I should.
2011-05-17T13:01:00.000Z	FCGreg	FloatingGoat	i was worried about that.  i would roll back everything with the CD or similar
