2010-10-21T03:36:00.000Z	chzkeeper		Does anyone here know of a package that switches all window controls and keyboard shortcuts to Mac-style? All I can find is themes, but I'm not really looking to change the appearance.

2010-10-21T03:39:00.000Z	chzkeeper		oh. Yes, I can change all of the shortcuts one-by-one, but I thought it would be easier if there was a profile / script / package that made it all happen automatically.
