2008-03-15T07:16:00.000Z	wookienz		i have added a line to fstab to add a smbfs share at boot... will a "networking restart" bring the share up or do i have to reboot?

2008-03-15T07:17:00.000Z	wookienz	stefano_	it is a remote box that i dont want to reboot as it needs me to replug in screen to log on and then i can VNC to it. another thing i need to fix!
