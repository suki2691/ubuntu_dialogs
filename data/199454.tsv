2007-04-03T09:13:00.000Z	dyrne	ndlovu	thats how ive upgraded since hoary
2007-04-03T09:14:00.000Z	dyrne	ndlovu	what i usually do: sudo sed -i 's/dapper/edgy/g' /etc/apt/sources.list; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2007-04-03T09:15:00.000Z	ndlovu	dyrne	that's pretty much what I'm wanting to do. just checking that it's not going to lead to any unexpected instability in the system.
