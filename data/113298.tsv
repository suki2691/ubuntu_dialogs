2009-04-22T04:48:00.000Z	GillaGal		My new system has 4GB of RAM, but an Intel Q2300 Quad core processor.  Should I be installing Ubunutu 32bit still?
2009-04-22T04:49:00.000Z	shadowh511	GillaGal	is it a 64-bit brocessor?
2009-04-22T04:49:00.000Z	GillaGal	shadowh511	Aren't most newer processors?
2009-04-22T04:50:00.000Z	shadowh511	GillaGal	try and see if 64-bit works, and if it doesn't,  use 32-bit
