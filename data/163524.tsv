2006-11-16T07:45:00.000Z	JuJuBee	CarinArr	: put the alias in .bashrc file (there are some examples there) I do it on my box for the same reason...
2006-11-16T07:46:00.000Z	JuJuBee	CarinArr	: alias someName="ssh user@ip.address.here"
2006-11-16T07:46:00.000Z	JuJuBee	CarinArr	then at shell just type someName and it will ssh to the ip add
