2007-11-01T21:03:00.000Z	joar	soho	you could try this in a terminal '# apt-cache search locale | grep 'your nationality'
2007-11-01T21:05:00.000Z	joar	soho	install what ever hits you get related to language and your nationality (+ figure out if it's relevant for your system, e.g. install openofice locale if your using openoffice) ;)
