2008-11-19T17:39:00.000Z	am4zin		i have a video-dvd and in nautilus it is shown as empty. but if i start nautilus with root-rights the files & folders of the dvd are shown correctly. other dvds are shown correctly in nautilus with user-rights. so what's the problem with this one dvd?

2008-11-19T17:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	am4zin	but if it's a video dvd i do not see how could that happen...
