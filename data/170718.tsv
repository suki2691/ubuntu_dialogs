2011-06-24T00:47:00.000Z	gabriel_1980		I have a Dlink-615 wireless router and an Alfa awu036nh usb  wireless n adapter, the problem is that most of the time I cant connect, it keeps looking for signal, but on windows 7 it works fine the connection
2011-06-24T00:48:00.000Z	kevinh90	gabriel_1980	dlink-615 is really old
2011-06-24T00:49:00.000Z	kevinh90	gabriel_1980	do you mean DIR-615 ?  that is newer
