2007-02-16T06:58:00.000Z	donTaquero		I wish to change perl for activeperl into my linbox but I need help to do it.
2007-02-16T06:58:00.000Z	donTaquero		Well, Exist any script to switch between perl and activeperl?
2007-02-16T06:58:00.000Z	Flannel	donTaquero	er... why do you want activePerl?  I didnt even know they mad eactivePerl for !win
2007-02-16T07:00:00.000Z	donTaquero	Flannel	Because I have a problem with CPAN modules configuration. I prefer use ppm that 'perl -MCPAN -e shell'...
