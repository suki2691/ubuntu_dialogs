2008-03-12T21:55:00.000Z	yacc	macogw	No, it kills it and gdm starts a fresh one.
2008-03-12T21:56:00.000Z	macogw	yacc	which is the same as restarting...if you need to have it actually killed, you have to stop gdm totally
2008-03-12T21:56:00.000Z	yacc	macogw	yeah, or make something steal port 6000, but you are right.
