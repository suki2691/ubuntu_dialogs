2012-07-02T11:50:00.000Z	ICWiener		I need a way to synchronize folders between two computers. I can mount them w/ sshfs, but that's not very convenient to do every time I start my computer. Also, I'd need to have both computers on for that to work. Is there any better way?
2012-07-02T11:50:00.000Z	ICWiener		Not over internet. Not w/ HughesNet
2012-07-02T11:52:00.000Z	ICWiener		Any better ideas?
2012-07-02T11:53:00.000Z	gigix	ICWiener	you're fine with sshfs but you'd like it to start automatically ?
