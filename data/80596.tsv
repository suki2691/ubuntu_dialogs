2008-12-22T07:40:00.000Z	wiijii	newsense	thanks I'll take a look
2008-12-22T07:40:00.000Z	newsense		no problem really simple rues
2008-12-22T07:41:00.000Z	wiijii	newsense	cheers for that but it's not really what I'm looking for. It seems my log rules are working, but I'm trying to follow a text book suggestion for testing the logging of 'invalid' packets
