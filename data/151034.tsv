2007-01-12T12:03:00.000Z	psynaps3_		i really don't get it why network manager was implemented this way. the crap doesn't support static ip's, there's virtually 0 configuration options and it overwrites every setting u put in. i can't even retain my dns server ips!!!

2007-01-12T12:05:00.000Z	psynaps3_	mnoir	there wishlist and buglist is pretty filled up... right from the dapper release
