2010-09-19T22:59:00.000Z	ikonia	zorklat	trace what ?
2010-09-19T23:00:00.000Z	zorklat	ikonia	traceroute.  Checks the packet path from me to a remote server, includes IPs of the hops, how long everything takes, etc.
2010-09-19T23:00:00.000Z	ikonia	zorklat	I know what traceroute is, - you just asked for a "trace" program
