2008-07-29T11:45:00.000Z	tanner_		I want to install ubuntu, but I already installed openSUSE and would like to know how I could remove that first
2008-07-29T11:46:00.000Z	Bogus8	tanner_	why not just run ubuntu and wipe out the old partitions when that stage comes up?
2008-07-29T11:47:00.000Z	Bogus8	tanner_	no different than say windows... just more options/power here
