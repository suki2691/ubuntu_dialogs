2007-08-23T15:34:00.000Z	tipote		Hi all ! I was considering switching to ubuntu from a source-based distrib to reduce time spent in working on the distro, but I don't like the 6-month schedule. I'd like a distribution that is has no freezing time, always upstream. Is there a way/a repo to make ubuntu behave like that ?

2007-08-23T15:35:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	tipote	stability will be an issue though
2007-08-23T15:36:00.000Z	tipote	SlimeyPete	ok, thanks. I don't really like to have to upgrade every 6 months...
