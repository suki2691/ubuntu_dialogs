2011-10-10T22:12:00.000Z	iAngry		ok. So I was so happy using my system. I use Ubuntu 10.10. I bought a printer a week back. And it's been 7 whole days since i couldn;t get a single print. The drivers are there, they're installed, everything is smooth, the jobs come as pending, but stay pending. Please Help me!
