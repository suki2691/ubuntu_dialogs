2009-08-29T20:12:00.000Z	Guest45107		I am not able to install any software, cannot sudo or use su commands ( which gives authentication failure), I can not upgrade due to low system resources, I have important data on system,so cant format, I had changed the root password long time back when I made some changes to gnome

2009-08-29T20:18:00.000Z	sentix	Guest45107	In a simular situation I just pulled the harddrive from the laptop, got the appropriate adapter ( IDE -> USB ) and copied what I needed off it... lot easier then doing the laptop version of ship in a bottle
