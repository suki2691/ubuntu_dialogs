2006-09-10T08:34:00.000Z	salim		hi everybody, I've question concerning Ubuntu of course - why is there ubuntu, kubuntu and xubuntu? can't I use KDE, Gnome and XFCE all in one distribution?
2006-09-10T08:35:00.000Z	salim		that means during logging in, cant I chose with which desktop I want to start? whether I want to use gnome or kde or xfce today?
2006-09-10T08:35:00.000Z	quiet	salim	it's all the same distro.
2006-09-10T08:35:00.000Z	quiet	salim	just different CDs... to keep it to 1 disc... easy for people to install/use/understand who are new to linux.
