2005-11-04T16:55:00.000Z	ptlo	apokryphos	is there an explanation how can packages which contain these codecs be located in the ubuntu repositories on the server?  isn't that a legal issue too?
2005-11-04T16:55:00.000Z	apokryphos	ptlo	heh, braino. Mp3 codecs aren't in there because they're propietary -- not illegal; that's java/w32codecs.
2005-11-04T16:58:00.000Z	ptlo	apokryphos	ahh ... i understand your distinction between the two but am still puzzled how any of that can be on server (btw i believe that since mp3 is patented and every implementation is required to pay patent fee, the codecs are technically illegal also, but i'm not sure)
