2006-06-30T14:00:00.000Z	Meshyf		I was reading the wiki and it said that you could install it with the freespace from your window's partition. Does it have to be free space away from the partition or can it use free space on the partition?

2006-06-30T14:01:00.000Z	Lynoure	Meshyf	I thought the installation can repartition for you, by changing the size of the original partition
