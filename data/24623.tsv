2011-07-28T04:22:00.000Z	wols_	BlueMatt	why should it daemonize? it has mounted whatever it wants to
2011-07-28T04:22:00.000Z	BlueMatt	wols_	--daemonize is supposed to, as /etc/init/mountall-net.conf expects it to be running
2011-07-28T04:23:00.000Z	BlueMatt	wols_	also, if it fails to mount a network drive, it still exits
