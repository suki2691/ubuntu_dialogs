2008-02-27T00:12:00.000Z	Deathray		Hi everyone. Hopefully someone can help me out ! I just used partition magic on my XP to shrink it to be able to install ubuntu. But as lucky as I am, it gave an error at 52 % and now XP won't boot (even in safe mode) Is there any way to check for bad sectors on NTFS while in ubuntu live ? Or any other suggestions to fix this problem ? Thanks alot ! Feel free to pm me btw.
