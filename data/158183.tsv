2009-08-06T23:35:00.000Z	tread	Slart	I don't throw strange stuff at it either.  Only stuff that it was able to play fine in Windows, and which it says it can play on its website.  I think it might have to do with the fact that I installed VLC under KDE and am now trying to run it under gnome.. depending on the file type, sometimes it plays, sometimes VLC just doesn't open at all (even though it used to on KDE).  Haven't tried a reinstall though.
