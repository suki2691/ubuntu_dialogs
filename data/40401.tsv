2009-12-22T12:27:00.000Z	phoenixzorn	skitzo	it's supposed to do that.
2009-12-22T12:29:00.000Z	phoenixzorn	skitzo	why would you not want to be able to see it?
2009-12-22T12:30:00.000Z	phoenixzorn	skitzo	because ubuntu can handle NTFS now, so there's no reason to hide it... if you need a document from windows, or something like that, you can just grab it... and not reboot to find something.
