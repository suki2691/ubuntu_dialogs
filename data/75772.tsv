2009-12-19T02:56:00.000Z	Segaja		my boot screen just looks like this: http://cdn.cbsi.com.au/story_media/339299234/ubuntu-910-karmic-koala_1.jpg and at the bottom are the messages scralling by because i have removed the quit statement from the bootline
2009-12-19T02:56:00.000Z	Segaja		is that the normal ubuntu boot screen?
2009-12-19T02:57:00.000Z	aperson	Segaja	that's the grub screen
2009-12-19T02:59:00.000Z	Segaja	aperson	woot? that is after the grub and if i remove the splash keyword from the boot line it is gone. so that makes it clearly ubunu to me
