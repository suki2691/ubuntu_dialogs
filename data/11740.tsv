2011-07-22T00:51:00.000Z	samanathon		Hi! This is my first IRC chat session and I'm not sure if it's appropriate to post really long questions....
2011-07-22T00:51:00.000Z	JustSighDudes	samanathon	That's better than posting many short questions.
2011-07-22T00:52:00.000Z	samanathon	JustSighDudes	could I post a link to a place I've asked the questoin before? redd.it/iw52p
