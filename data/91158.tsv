2009-02-23T00:39:00.000Z	Condoulo		ok, I have a question. I have Compiz Fusion enabled, and I am having a bit of an issue where video playback in totem player (or any media player for that matter) is sorta flashy. Is there any way to fix this?
2009-02-23T00:40:00.000Z	Izinucs	Condoulo	I fixed that with a better video driver for my nvidia
2009-02-23T00:40:00.000Z	Condoulo	Izinucs	eh. I use ATI.
2009-02-23T00:40:00.000Z	Izinucs	Condoulo	sorry don't know much about the ATI's..
