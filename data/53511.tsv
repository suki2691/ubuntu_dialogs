2009-10-11T08:38:00.000Z	Gopher1		I just downloaded a video that says I need to use windows media player to play it, tried using both VLC and Movie Player to no avail, anyone have any ideas?
2009-10-11T08:38:00.000Z	natewiebe13	Gopher1	haha... probably a virus
2009-10-11T08:40:00.000Z	natewiebe13	Gopher1	whenever i have had a video like that.. its usually a video that is bundled with a virus.. is it an actual video stream that says "need to play with windows media player" or another window that comes up?
2009-10-11T08:40:00.000Z	natewiebe13	Gopher1	sounds like virus to me
