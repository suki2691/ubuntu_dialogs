2010-10-12T19:12:00.000Z	karmic-koala		Hi all, I am trying to setup a ticketing system (user support) on ubuntu server. The system needs to be able to read email from Gmail (either real time or thru a pull using a cron job), will I need to setup a Mail Delivery Agent or a Mail Transfer Agent to do what I want?
