2009-06-23T23:48:00.000Z	fccf	jlaroche	hmm i didn't know that ... you should be able to do a Ctrl+Shift+T to get a second terminal tab
2009-06-23T23:48:00.000Z	jlaroche	fccf	ctrl+shift+t doesn't do anything
2009-06-23T23:55:00.000Z	fccf	jlaroche	have you tried Ctrl+Alt-F1, Ctrl+alt+f2 etc ... these are virtual terminals Ctrl+alt+F7 should bring you back to norm
