2005-12-22T12:48:00.000Z	mrkoje_		how long has that been in effect?
2005-12-22T12:48:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	mrkoje_	went to Ubuntu forums to find that out :)
2005-12-22T12:49:00.000Z	mrkoje_	CaptainMorgan	 I just logged into the 2600.net irc and asked about freenode.... I haven't been around for a while so I didn't know what was going on when I couldn't connect to irc.free.......
