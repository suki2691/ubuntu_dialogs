2006-12-25T10:13:00.000Z	modulus		hey, i got a problem. my laptop fails to beep on places where typically the system speaker would beep like on the console
2006-12-25T10:13:00.000Z	modulus		i suspect this is something to do with alsa not supporting the legacy speaker emmulation or something?
2006-12-25T10:14:00.000Z	Icarus	modulus	open up volume control and set pc speaker to the top , that might help
2006-12-25T10:15:00.000Z	modulus	Icarus	sorry for the dumbness but where can i find volume control?
