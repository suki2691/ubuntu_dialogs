2007-01-21T12:48:00.000Z	humblerodent		which log would I look in to find the cause of a total hard crash (i.e. NOTHING works)?  /var/log/syslog ?
2007-01-21T12:49:00.000Z	humblerodent		correction....I don't mean it crashed to the point of not working.  I mean nothing worked THEN, i.e., not Ctrl+Alt+Backspace, nothing.
2007-01-21T12:50:00.000Z	n2diy	humblerodent	check message, and kernel too.
2007-01-21T12:51:00.000Z	humblerodent	n2diy	hm, okay, not seeing it.
