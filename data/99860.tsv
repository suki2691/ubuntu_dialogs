2008-02-22T00:15:00.000Z	TrustNoOne		I leave my notebook on 24/7, it is not a laptop (the fans are on the bottom of the notebook), and when i use it on my lap im careful not to cover the fans. I am asking about what I can do to cool it down, because at night I leave it on my table and shut the lid, but sometimes (once every few weeks) it overheats and shuts down, more frequently in summer it shuts down because of overheating (i am guessing) because no matter what OS
2008-02-22T00:15:00.000Z	TrustNoOne		 i am using it will shut down with no warning or error log, so what can I do to prevent this?

2008-02-22T00:17:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	KaiForce	i dont know if those are a good idea if the laptop cooler covers the fan on the bottom of my notebook in the corner, because it wont cool properly
