2005-10-27T15:15:00.000Z	sudeep		I ran "cat /proc/cpuinfo" It gave me cpu family: 5 . Can I use linux-586 kernel found on a debian site?
2005-10-27T15:16:00.000Z	Bieleke	sudeep	just install the kernel with synaptic
2005-10-27T15:26:00.000Z	Bieleke	sudeep	only advisable when having more than 1 gig mem
2005-10-27T15:27:00.000Z	Bieleke	sudeep	the 386 kernel is optimized, so no need to do that
