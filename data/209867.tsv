2006-12-16T13:17:00.000Z	Capslock118		i dont understand why when i search glibc, only glibc-docs and -doc reference shows up...what about the actual glibc?
2006-12-16T13:19:00.000Z	LjL	Capslock118	long story short, libc6 = glibc
2006-12-16T13:20:00.000Z	LjL	Capslock118	are you sure it's looking for libc6 and not for the build tools and includes? (i.e. build-essential and friends)
2006-12-16T13:21:00.000Z	LjL	Capslock118	that just looks like that shell script is bad, to me... perhaps
