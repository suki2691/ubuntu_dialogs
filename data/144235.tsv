2007-03-02T17:32:00.000Z	RandomizeR		hey guys, i need to move my linux from hda7 to sda1 (new drive), and at the same time make a /home partition.. can someone please talk to me, i did find lots of how-tos but i kinda need to talk to a human about this
2007-03-02T17:33:00.000Z	RandomizeR		i have the Ubuntu live cd, which i know i'll use to copy the files to the new drive
2007-03-02T17:35:00.000Z	SilentDis	RandomizeR	I'm very particular about hardware configs... I'd be the first to recommend a reinstall after backing up your /var/cache/apt/archives, /home, and /etc/apt/sources.list, and then reinstall how you want it, finally restore everything.  that's just me though.  there is other ways to do it (using dd and such), but as I said, I prefer to make things from 'scratch' when i'm upgrading major hardware
2007-03-02T17:36:00.000Z	RandomizeR	SilentDis	i would normally do that, but i have been customizing this installation for a week now and i downloaded a ton of packages and installed a dozen big apps, so i kinda hate to re-do this all from scratch :-s
