Error 18" and then it just stops :(  i googled it and apparently it can be fixed by putting the partition at the start of the drive rather than later on.  is this correct?

2007-06-18T09:39:00.000Z	shiester_miester	tonyyarusso	i thought as much, its not really a problem though since i only just installed it, so all i lose is the time :P
