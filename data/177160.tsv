2006-06-22T07:59:00.000Z	Devil_Hunter		Does anybody know if ubuntu supports Dell Poweredge 2400?
2006-06-22T08:00:00.000Z	neotard	Devil_Hunter	 a better question is does it support the components in your computer
2006-06-22T08:03:00.000Z	neotard	Devil_Hunter	 everyones mileage varies.  I had a friend tell me ubuntu didn't work, but he loves slackware on his dell laptop.. *shrug*
