2009-05-26T17:41:00.000Z	amanda-b	Rorschach	it's unlikely to be copy protected, but it's probably trademarked.
2009-05-26T17:43:00.000Z	amanda-b	Rorschach	different color scheme and different industry. trademark infringement is a bitch.
2009-05-26T17:45:00.000Z	amanda-b	Rorschach	IANAL, but i've done some trademark work. just because it looks similar doesn't mean much necessarily.
