2011-04-25T01:37:00.000Z	Ringwaul		Hello all
2011-04-25T01:38:00.000Z	Ringwaul		I was trying to install ubuntu recently to get away from windows, but I'm having a weird problem installing
2011-04-25T01:39:00.000Z	Ringwaul		So while installing ubuntu 10.10, I get to the "who are you page". After I enter all my info it says "Waiting for you" at the bottom but the "Forward" button is greyed out and I can't do anything.
