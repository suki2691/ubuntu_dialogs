2011-09-07T02:16:00.000Z	TAndriamirado	IGITIHI	before trying to force filesystem verifications, mount the filesystem containing /var/log and see what /var/log/messages and/or /var/log/syslog says
2011-09-07T02:17:00.000Z	IGITIHI	TAndriamirado	Thanks, I'll try that right away!
2011-09-07T02:18:00.000Z	TAndriamirado	IGITIHI	BUT the 1st thing to verify is: your BIOS system date/time. It already happened to me that a faulty bios date/time caused the ext4 filesystem to not being able to be mounted, NOR repaired (which 'd be dangerous!).
