2008-08-22T21:59:00.000Z	whileimhere		Is there a lighter web browser than Firefox that is as good or at least not bad ?:)
2008-08-22T21:59:00.000Z	Terrasque	whileimhere	opera?
2008-08-22T22:01:00.000Z	Terrasque	whileimhere	opera, or dillo. Opera is generally faster than firefox, dillo is very fast, but lack a lot of support for web standards
