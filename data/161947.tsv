2006-10-29T12:53:00.000Z	bj__		I have a problem with firefox and sounds. Flash works fine, but mp3's or wav's in the background of a normal page doesn't seem to work. I've tried a lot of stuff in the forum, but all the threads seem to be about flash not working.

2006-10-29T12:55:00.000Z	bj__	overridex	good idea, I never liked the plugin but it might work better
2006-10-29T13:03:00.000Z	bj__	overridex	mplayer plugin no good either
