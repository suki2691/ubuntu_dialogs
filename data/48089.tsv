2009-12-19T00:43:00.000Z	Scunizi	Alan502	LiVeS! available on www.getdeb.net .. Cinrella (spelling?) usually overkill and tough to setup
2009-12-19T00:43:00.000Z	Alan502	Scunizi	Lives? is it kdenlive?
2009-12-19T00:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	Alan502	no.. it's different.. kdenlive is nice but a little buggy.. at least the last time I tried it.
