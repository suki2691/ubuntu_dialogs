2006-05-19T07:52:00.000Z	WillyTell	twysted	you are right! I am a complete beginner..... I have mounted the windows CD and all is going well. I needed just a little help. Thanks a lot!
2006-05-19T08:57:00.000Z	WillyTell	twysted	I use Ubuntu at home. But where I work, people use windows... I'm trying to show them that linux is better, and the application already exist now can run here too. thanks again.
