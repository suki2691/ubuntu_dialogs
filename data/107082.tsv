2008-04-06T01:34:00.000Z	mikedoty		Hey guys.  I need to install the libc headers to install this driver of mine
2008-04-06T01:34:00.000Z	mikedoty		What package do I install for that?
2008-04-06T01:34:00.000Z	mikedoty		I apt-cache searched on libc but it's a ton of results
2008-04-06T01:34:00.000Z	Starnestommy	mikedoty	is build-essential installed?
