2009-01-12T09:12:00.000Z	miranda_psi	jedex	ps just get the process involved with where you call it from, the -A tells it to list all processes
2009-01-15T13:14:00.000Z	miranda_psi	jedex	there is no problem to fix there - hdds dont have the capacity they say and the filesystem itself uses a part of that...
