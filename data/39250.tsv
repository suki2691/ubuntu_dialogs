2010-01-09T18:59:00.000Z	samdil		my hsdpa modem (huwei e220) indicates that it has connected to the internet, but all the web applications fail to access the internet. I have to unplug-replug the modem to get it really working.. are there reported bugs on this ??
2010-01-09T19:00:00.000Z	mkanyicy	samdil	has it ever worked before?
2010-01-09T19:04:00.000Z	mkanyicy	samdil	what application are you using to make it connect? nm-applet or "sudo wvdial" or something else?
2010-01-09T19:05:00.000Z	samdil	mkanyicy	it's nm-applet
