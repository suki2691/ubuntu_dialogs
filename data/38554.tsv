2010-07-15T20:55:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	daddysmurf	i wish documentation of new stuff wouldn't take so long, i mean arch and other semi bleeding edge distros are at least 4-5 versions ahead of ubuntu
2010-07-15T20:56:00.000Z	daddysmurf	aeon-ltd	have you ever done documentation? it sucks...
2010-07-15T20:56:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	daddysmurf	no but support isn't much better considering most people who are new to ubuntu complain on the forums before even consulting man pages or the specifically written ubuntu wiki
