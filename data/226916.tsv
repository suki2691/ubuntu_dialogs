2007-05-20T06:38:00.000Z	variant	iShock	you don't
2007-05-20T06:39:00.000Z	variant	iShock	unless you use a virtual machine
2007-05-20T06:40:00.000Z	variant	iShock	yes, a program that pretends to be a computer that runs on top of the installed operating system. it allows you to run other operating systems in a window.. heard of vmware?
