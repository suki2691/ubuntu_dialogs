2005-11-03T17:47:00.000Z	lucis		So no one can help me install realplayer?
2005-11-03T17:48:00.000Z	puff	lucis	I had that problem too, the ubuntu realplayer installer package I tried wanted to use an earlier version  of the RealPlayer installer from RealPlayer, I couldn't find it, so I just gave up for now.
