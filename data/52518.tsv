2009-07-15T23:19:00.000Z	QxGY	rhin0	sudo aptitude too, is stuck at 0%
2009-07-15T23:19:00.000Z	QxGY	rhin0	but i am able to download that specific .deb from the repository using wget
2009-07-15T23:20:00.000Z	rhin0	QxGY	not sure then, I tend to avoid apt-get if possible and download the latest .deb from the source for latest build
