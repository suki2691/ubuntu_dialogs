2004-11-20T14:29:00.000Z	DeanG		can someone point me to doc's for replacing an existing linux install, and the implications to the partition setup?
2004-11-20T14:30:00.000Z	DeanG		I don't care about wiping out RedHat partitions, but don't want to lose grub setup and windows partition.
2004-11-20T14:30:00.000Z	bur[n] er	DeanG	you won't
2004-11-20T14:31:00.000Z	bur[n] er	DeanG	a new grub will be installed when you install ubuntu though
