2012-07-16T22:43:00.000Z	iankp_		I'm installing Solr, but I need it in an older release (1.4) so I'm installing it via tarball and not via apt-get.  If I installed it via apt-get it would go somewhere nice off of root, I presume.  If I do it via tarball, do I have to drop it somewhere into my home (~) directory?  Seems slightly awkward

When you extract the tarball there should be more specific instructions either in the readme or the install file. You may need to install certain dependencies before it will compile and install, sudo apt-get install b
