2010-03-26T18:04:00.000Z	moegreen		hey guys... is there a way to know that its the newest version of the app i am trying to install when using apt-get install?  For example how do i know that thunderbird 3 will be installed and not 2?
2010-03-26T18:06:00.000Z	moegreen		thanks guys that worked.  Just to clarify for a newb..when using apt-get that is pulling from what we call in the linux world repositories.. correct?
