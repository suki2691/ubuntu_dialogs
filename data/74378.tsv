2008-11-14T02:16:00.000Z	_vistor		I need help with saving my settings in alsamixer. Ive changed to HDA intel but a reboot reverts to Pulseaudio. Does anyone know what i have to do to make the changes "stick" ? (no, alsactl store wont work)
2008-11-14T02:16:00.000Z	joaopinto	_vistor	no idea, but what's wrong with your pulseaudio ?
2008-11-14T02:17:00.000Z	_vistor	joaopinto	pulseaudio gives me one "Master" channel
2008-11-14T02:17:00.000Z	_vistor	joaopinto	I want to be able to use the front, back etc..
