2007-06-11T13:08:00.000Z	RoC_MM	khin	Yes...it's a graphic, not really a color...you may not want to bother unelss it's a big deal.
2007-06-11T13:12:00.000Z	RoC_MM	khin	mmmm...you could close your eyes...no?   Yes...I think "splash" is a boot parameter...you could remove that....then it would show the normal boot process with all the text info i bet.
