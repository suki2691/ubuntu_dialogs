2009-11-09T09:06:00.000Z	RPS		Hello guys, I started with a clean install of 8.10 back last year and then upgraded to 9.04 back in April. Now I'm interested in moving to 9.10. Is there any reason to worry about updating to the latest version? I might be worried about nothing, but it seems like a logical question & will make me feel more secure. Thanks!
