2009-11-06T18:38:00.000Z	administrator_	Mjateznik	as mkv being a container file, it might be that you have an unsupported codec hidden inside of it. I've had them with Real Media video in them before, that was a pain to get working.
2009-11-06T18:39:00.000Z	Mjateznik	administrator_	yea but I have played the same video file earlier today and other mkv file (sam source) earlier both without and with problem...
2009-11-06T18:39:00.000Z	administrator_	Mjateznik	open it with VLC, look at any errors it gives you. that's how I found out the one mkv I had had real video in it.
