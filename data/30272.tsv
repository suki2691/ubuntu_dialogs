2010-06-14T14:59:00.000Z	siba	erUSUL	 I'm using ubuntu 10.04 (64bit) on a acer aspire 2930 (Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X4500M HD). When I connect an Asus vw222s monitor it looks like the refresh is wrong. It auto-set the refresh at 60hz (and I can't change it using the monitor setting gnome software) but the image is not correct. What can I use to correct the setting? Is there any driver I have to use? Thank you very much
