2008-08-30T02:34:00.000Z	eitri_		hi guys, I have ubuntu installed on one harddrive atm, and will now put a new harddrive in my computer and install windows on that one.. Is there a way to recover ubuntu afterwords. So that it becomes a type of dualboot?

2008-08-30T02:38:00.000Z	eitri_	inspyre	I don't want to reinstall ubuntu.. I've finally gotten it the way I like it..
2008-08-30T02:39:00.000Z	eitri_	inspyre	I think I found a way that will work. Just gotta print it out before I try: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
