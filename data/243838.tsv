2008-02-18T13:24:00.000Z	Aparna_		I patched my kernel. It's taking too long after I typed make. It's been more than 45 minutes since I typed make. Is that normal?

2008-02-18T13:25:00.000Z	crweb	Aparna_	well.. that would be a bit odd.  However, you probably just typed make. meaning you are only using 1 cpu
2008-02-18T13:25:00.000Z	crweb	Aparna_	where you should have typed like  make -j6  ?
