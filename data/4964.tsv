2012-05-02T03:45:00.000Z	papashou		gnome3 - does it keep the menu items on the individual windows?
2012-05-02T03:45:00.000Z	papashou		I'm using Unity now and it is kind fo annoying how the menu bar is torn away and put at the top bar- considering most of these applications were designed to have the menu item in the window itself... does that make any sense ?
