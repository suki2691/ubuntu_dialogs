2011-04-25T02:37:00.000Z	Soothsayer		on my desktop, I presently have one 500 gb hard drive with 3 partitions (NTFS) running Windows 7
2011-04-25T02:37:00.000Z	Soothsayer		now I want to dual boot this with Ubuntu
2011-04-25T02:37:00.000Z	Soothsayer		what's a good way to around managing the partitions? Should I just get a new hard drive or... ?
