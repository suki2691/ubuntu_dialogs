2006-11-15T09:09:00.000Z	fryfrog		When I installed Ubuntu, I told it my clock was set to UTC and my time zone was EST... well, for some reason even though the time zone is accurate (says est) the *time* is actually UTC :/
2006-11-15T09:09:00.000Z	fryfrog		So I *think* I need to tell it that my system clock *isn't* UTC... or I need to do something else :)
2006-11-15T09:10:00.000Z	fryfrog		thanks
