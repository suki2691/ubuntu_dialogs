2006-07-14T07:54:00.000Z	studprog		Hi .,.. anybody know where to find a howto about setting up a local Ubuntu mirror
2006-07-14T07:56:00.000Z	studprog		let me put it this way ... i have to deploy ubuntu on 200 machines - and it would be nice if they were updated via a local mirror instead of using a lot of bandwidth "out-of-the-house"

2006-07-14T07:58:00.000Z	studprog	dr_willis	we were planning on that ... either that or using the intranet
