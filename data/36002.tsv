2010-03-15T21:26:00.000Z	Grey_Loki		Where can I put a program (and what do I have to do to the executable file, which is a .i386 extension) so that it can be run by all users?
2010-03-15T21:28:00.000Z	mw44118-work	Grey_Loki	well, the short answer is to put it in any directory in $PATH.
2010-03-15T21:28:00.000Z	mw44118-work	Grey_Loki	no, you can't put it in a subdir, unless that subdir is also in $PATH
2010-03-15T21:29:00.000Z	Grey_Loki	mw44118-work	hmm, alright - i'll do some googling
