2011-10-15T01:17:00.000Z	enav		Hello i do really want to understand why my LAMP server creates files under the ownership root
2011-10-15T01:18:00.000Z	Morgz	enav	- isn't that a umask issue?
2011-10-15T01:19:00.000Z	enav	Morgz	what?
2011-10-15T01:21:00.000Z	Morgz	enav	- I'm not familiar with it, but umask sets the default file creation permissions from my understanding, maybe good place to start?
