2008-01-19T07:22:00.000Z	Elevator_Hazard	Psynaut	Yea I'm just having one problem after another. I love linux, 7.04 on my old computer wasn't bad but I have a lot of problems now on a nerwer computer with 7.10 safely on an external harddrive.
2008-01-19T07:23:00.000Z	Psynaut	Elevator_Hazard	do you have onboard sound? or a sound card?
2008-01-19T07:24:00.000Z	Elevator_Hazard	Psynaut	I really don't know...
