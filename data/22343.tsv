2011-01-10T06:24:00.000Z	crmangan		Anybody willing to walk me through some wine setup? I'm running 32bit Ubuntu, Wine 1.3, and have done all the config changes mentioned in the community page but still suffer from significantly lower framerates than my windows install

2011-01-10T06:28:00.000Z	crmangan	breadcrumb	thanks for the tip, I'll give it a shot
2011-01-10T06:29:00.000Z	breadcrumb	crmangan	no prob. other than that i don't know. i used to run ubuntu exclusively but got tired of wine's quirks for gaming, so im back on windows for now. by the way there is a wine channel too at #winehq
