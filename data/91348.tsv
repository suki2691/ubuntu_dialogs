2008-05-27T19:09:00.000Z	STSX	Slart	Myrtti: Any idea of the proper syntax to mount stuff with fstab in Wubi? :)
2008-05-27T19:09:00.000Z	Slart	STSX	absolutely no idea what so ever..  but there has to be some info about it somewhere.. canonical invented this little weirdo.. it had better send a manual with it =)
