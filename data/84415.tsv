2011-11-09T18:14:00.000Z	ispirto		I'm getting this error: gzip: test.gz is a multi-part gzip file -- not supported when I use gunzip test.gz. How can I extract this file?
2011-11-09T18:15:00.000Z	ispirto		i don't think there are other parts
2011-11-09T18:15:00.000Z	szal	ispirto	how about using the script containing the archive to extract it?  if the author(s) haven't omitted that for whatever reason, it should come w/ an extract-only option
