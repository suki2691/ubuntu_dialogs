2007-01-29T13:28:00.000Z	fdoving	slyfox	why /root? - i have one big, / + swap.
2007-01-29T13:29:00.000Z	slyfox	fdoving	but what if you want to reinstall OS, that means that you will need to back up all your needed files to a sepeara parition or a hard drive, becaue you will want to clen all those settings and otehr stuff for a OS reinstall ?
