2010-10-14T13:47:00.000Z	razz1	Tokumei	thanks, actually I can run it in windows VM but wanted to know if there were any alternative to run natively in ubuntu

2010-10-14T14:06:00.000Z	razz1	Tokumei	I just installed utorrent in windows VM and it works just fine with speeds hitting the max, I still cannot figure out why transmission is having issues?
