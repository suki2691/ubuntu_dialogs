2010-06-07T20:40:00.000Z	edbian	AaronMT	That's from 2007.  Don't you want the latest version?  10.04 ?
2010-06-07T20:42:00.000Z	edbian	AaronMT	It's not supported any longer so the package manager won't work.  http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/feisty/
2010-06-07T20:42:00.000Z	edbian	AaronMT	I just googled it...
