2007-09-23T10:55:00.000Z	Xera		The ATI website says the fglrx driver supports cards 8500 and above, I have a 9250 and it doesn't work.. can anyone help? The error says something about no device detected on PCI 3:2:1 but in xorg.conf I have it set to PCI 3:2:0..
2007-09-23T10:56:00.000Z	Xera		Ok well uh, how do I remove this? :|

2007-09-23T10:56:00.000Z	Xera	Inglor	But I need to remove the one installed with the .run file first no?
