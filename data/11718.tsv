2012-06-11T14:12:00.000Z	wdp		hm i have ubuntu 12.something and i'm using it with unity. is it possible to add a bar at the bottom of the desktop, with all opened programs
2012-06-11T14:12:00.000Z	wdp		if yes, how?
2012-06-11T14:12:00.000Z	dataphreak	wdp	i could tell you how to do it with gnome, but not unity.
2012-06-11T14:13:00.000Z	wdp	dataphreak	pretty sure it'll be the same. how do you do that in gnome? I've been using xfce4 for years, so i have really no clue about gnome
