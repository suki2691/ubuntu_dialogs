2006-05-27T12:34:00.000Z	Madangren		How do I open a program as root in Ubuntu?  I opened a terminal and ran "su" but the root account doesn't seem to be activated.  It has no password.
2006-05-27T12:34:00.000Z	Madangren		So I would type "sudo ark" to open ark as root?
2006-05-27T12:35:00.000Z	Madangren		ERROR: Communication problem with ark, it probably crashed.
2006-05-27T12:35:00.000Z	mo^	Madangren	or you can type "gksudo ark"
