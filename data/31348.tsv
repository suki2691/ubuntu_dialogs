2010-07-18T10:02:00.000Z	Axilus		I added two export lines and I just want to know how to update it without logging out and logging back in
2010-07-18T10:05:00.000Z	thune3	Axilus	i just mean if .profile has already added something to a path, 'source'ing it will add it again. I don't have any idea how to get it to apply globally without loggin in again.
