2007-07-08T07:08:00.000Z	finn		I have the theme from http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=49443  downloaded and extracted to ~/.themes/VictrolaGrrl   but  gtk-theme-switch still only lets me choose "default"
2007-07-08T07:08:00.000Z	finn		am I missing something?
2007-07-08T07:10:00.000Z	finn		shouldn't it allow me to change to the theme now that I have it in the folder?
