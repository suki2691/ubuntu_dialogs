2007-02-05T16:28:00.000Z	jahid	Jewfro-Macabbi	i can change that, but when i am trying to start my XChat its saying that i dont have permisison to open the log file. but before it was having permisison. and i was trying to open a database using pgadmin, and i got error that, dont have permission to open that db file
