2008-06-17T11:23:00.000Z	Reformer81	Agent_bob	Yeah, it's hard to really clarify.  I want to run a web server with my computer... but I still want to be able to use it as my home system at the same time.
2008-06-17T11:23:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Reformer81	oh.  then yes.   i do that too.  in fact a lot of people have a local apache or cherokee running
2008-06-17T11:25:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Reformer81	and you don't even have to let the world see the server if you don't want it accessable to the web
