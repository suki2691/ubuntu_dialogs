2006-10-14T05:44:00.000Z	tritonx		dave: Im trying to be able to receive mal on my no-ip. Ive installed courier-imap, also runing firestarter for net sharing, the server seems to be listening  on the oustid since I can remote from the net, but maybe I didn<t configured it right but port 143 should be opened
