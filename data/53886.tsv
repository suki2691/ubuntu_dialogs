2009-06-25T14:49:00.000Z	Travo18		is having half windows half ubuntu on a drive suitable you reckon or should i just go whole ubuntu?
2009-06-25T14:51:00.000Z	Aacron	Travo18	 personally what I did was get a small-ish drive, put windows on it, then put my games and backup stuff on a seperate harddrive with it formatted with ext3 and use "ext2 for windows"
2009-06-25T14:52:00.000Z	Aacron	Travo18	 since windows is notoriously easy to screw up, and doesn't recover from stuff very easily, this set-up works fairly well.  If I see something in linux I just can't live without, or find a good linux game I like, I can just have it live on the 'games' drive
2009-06-25T14:53:00.000Z	Aacron	Travo18	 and I like keepign the same stuff for windows as well.  that way if either/or/both OS's fail somehow, I still have my game files, and my backup stuff
