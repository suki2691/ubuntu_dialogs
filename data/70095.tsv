2010-03-25T05:25:00.000Z	smerz	timmy54321	no most settings will remain. It is a BETA though so unless you want to upgrade for something specific i'd recommend against it
2010-03-25T05:25:00.000Z	timmy54321	ubuntu	studio 9.10 is beta??
2010-03-25T05:27:00.000Z	smerz	timmy54321	oh my apologies. 9.10 is stable so go ahead :) sorry
