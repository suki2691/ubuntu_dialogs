2007-06-27T07:15:00.000Z	Selrach		I have a problem. When I managed to install ubuntu via the alternative ISO, during bootup I get dropped to a text session. The last few lines before it prompts for a text login is this: Loading ACPI modules.. | Starting ACPI Services... | Killed. Anyone have any idea whats going on? (repost)
