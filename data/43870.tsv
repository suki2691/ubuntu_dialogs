2009-11-02T10:29:00.000Z	Shoshana	eatThisAndDie	: i mean about perofmance , openoffice is linux version and office2007 is windows version that you need wine (3rd software) you know what i mean ?
2009-11-02T10:32:00.000Z	eatThisAndDie	Shoshana	i think the problem is a little bit more than that. ie: are you sure about the compatibility, do you have the licenses for all the machines that you want to run MSoffice on, what format do you want to save your files in (consideration for compatibility as well)
