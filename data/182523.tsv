2006-09-25T11:57:00.000Z	Mogz		sorry, was a long time ago I last had to bother with this stuff...
2006-09-25T11:59:00.000Z	Mogz		here's another stupid question... could I use the kernel I compiled together with the initrd of the kernel I was using before (am currently using)? they're both 2.6.15.
2006-09-25T12:00:00.000Z	Mogz		hm... brb.
2006-09-25T12:00:00.000Z	stefg	Mogz	the modules inside the initrd won't fit with the new kernel
