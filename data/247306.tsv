2011-04-07T03:07:00.000Z	Spoog		Still having problems with my realtek driver --> anyone had problems with the r8169/8168
2011-04-07T03:08:00.000Z	Spoog		If I blacklist a driver in the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.config ..should it still show up when I do the lspci -v?
2011-04-07T03:10:00.000Z	Spoog		I followed this (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1022411) 80% as I had problems with the last 2 commands.
