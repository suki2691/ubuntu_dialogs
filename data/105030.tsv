2008-04-04T16:07:00.000Z	Tester		Hey there im still having trouble finding a walkthrough for installing windows xp after ive initially installed ubuntu, is there any that anyone here know's of? im using the same HD, so i will have to partition
2008-04-04T16:08:00.000Z	Tester		ive actually already installed Ubuntu
2008-04-04T16:09:00.000Z	Tester		i'd just like to install windows now, but not sure how to go about this, i tried ubotu grub, but i cant really make sense of it :S
