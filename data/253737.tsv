2005-11-26T11:01:00.000Z	CRS2117		Hello, I'm trying to install audacity, and clicking on various links I came across a Ubuntu specific install package, with a .deb extension. Archive manager says it can't open it. What am I doing wrong?
2005-11-26T11:03:00.000Z	CRS2117		What? How do I run dpkg -i? I don't know where the run dialog is
2005-11-26T11:04:00.000Z	CRS2117		Ohh! Audacity is listed on synaptic?
2005-11-26T11:04:00.000Z	budgester	CRS2117	sure is
