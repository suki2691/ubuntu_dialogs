2009-02-26T19:58:00.000Z	banisterfiend	Daft_Punk	alt-f2 doesn't do anything, in fact none of my old shortcut keys seem to work
2009-02-26T19:58:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	banisterfiend	did you try restarting the system a few times? seems like something didnt load properly
2009-02-26T19:59:00.000Z	banisterfiend	Daft_Punk	for example i had Control-ALT-t bound to open a gnome-terminal but now it says it can't even locate the command 'gnome-terminal' anymore!
