2012-02-29T01:09:00.000Z	capslock286		I would like to hear some thought about the Unity-desktop with the Open-source driver of ATI? I use Mobility Radeon 4200 on a Compaq laptop but feel that the Unity desktop is slow

2012-02-29T01:10:00.000Z	capslock286		Any thought on this on how to fix it?
2012-02-29T01:10:00.000Z	aiphee	capslock286	why it would be slower?
