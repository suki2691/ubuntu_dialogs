2008-05-07T02:34:00.000Z	family		hey guys. I have both gtkpod and rythm box installed. Currently rythmbox automatically pops up when I plug in an ipod. Is there anyway to change this to gtkpod?

2008-05-07T02:36:00.000Z	magnetron	family	oh, sorry, i was incorrect.
2008-05-07T02:37:00.000Z	family	magnetron	Ah, yeah, it's not under there. Any other ideas?
