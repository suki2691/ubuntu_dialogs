2008-05-24T13:17:00.000Z	ReleaseX		My laptop's keyboard was working fine til I plugged in a USB keyboard.  Now the right hand letters my laptop's keyboard are registering as numbers.  Any ideas why this is happening?

2008-05-24T13:20:00.000Z	cafuego	ReleaseX	hit it again to turn num lock off
2008-05-24T13:20:00.000Z	ReleaseX	cafuego	doesn't matter if num lock is on or off
