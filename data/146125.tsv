2007-04-13T12:08:00.000Z	Anomal1		hey guys. I'm trying to install grub, because upgrading to feisty wiped it for some reason. I looked at this guide: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=224351, but what it tells me to do doesnt work. after running find /boot/grub/stage1, i just get a file not found error
2007-04-13T12:09:00.000Z	Anomal1		can anyone help?
2007-04-13T12:09:00.000Z	PriceChild	Anomal1	#ubuntu+1 for feisty - it is not finished
2007-04-13T12:09:00.000Z	Anomal1	PriceChild	should it matter that the base system is feisty thought? :/
