2011-10-22T15:16:00.000Z	bdorsi		Ello everyone, i am trieing to make my wlan working on debian, but at the debian channel noone wants to help me... So i hope someone here will have some usefull information. I have a Dell inspiron m5010, and did all the stuff at debian wlna section
2011-10-22T15:17:00.000Z	KM0201	bdorsi	this channel is for ubuntu support, not debian, try #debian, or posting on debian forums
2011-10-22T15:18:00.000Z	bdorsi	KM0201	i know, i did but there is 0 support, so i tryed here, maybe someone can help
2011-10-22T15:18:00.000Z	KM0201	bdorsi	but this channel doesn't support debian, if you want support here install ubuntu
