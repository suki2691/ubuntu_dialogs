2006-10-22T15:16:00.000Z	floyd2	rcarr	ok now apt says I have conflicts. I tried 'sudo apt-get -f install' and it fails. Going to try with synaptic.
2006-10-22T15:18:00.000Z	floyd2	rcarr	apparently my libgdk-pixbuf2-ruby package is broken and neither apt nor synaptic can fix it?
2006-10-22T15:18:00.000Z	floyd2	rcarr	I did the "fix broken packages" in synaptic and it failed.
