2010-01-19T21:30:00.000Z	sephy	^paradox^	That's for you to decide. The package manager will tell you when there's newer versions of a package
2010-01-19T21:30:00.000Z	sephy	^paradox^	As a golden rule, if it works, don't mess with it
2010-01-19T21:31:00.000Z	^paradox^	sephy	so even if its offering updates now itd be better to wait on them in updates manager? just checking
