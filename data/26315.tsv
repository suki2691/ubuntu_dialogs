2010-09-17T06:55:00.000Z	theixle		I'm having trouble printing to a shared printer on a windows machine. I've read all the how-to's on the forum but A) They don't match my kubuntu printer setup options and B) If the windows printer is shared in samba by default I don't know the smb:// address.
2010-09-17T06:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	theixle	 you could always use smb://TheMachinesipNumber/
2010-09-17T06:57:00.000Z	theixle	Dr_Willis	I tried that it didn't find it in the scan.
2010-09-17T06:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	theixle	 you could try the cups web interface also. http://localhost:631
