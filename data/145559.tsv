2008-01-02T07:55:00.000Z	rppp01a		I'd just like to get ubuntu to stretch the desktop across both monitors - the laptop monitor and the attached one. Works fine in windows, but never done any desktop work in linux (I work on many *nixs at work).
2008-01-02T07:55:00.000Z	rppp01a		I figure the driver isn't correct, but any changes causes X to stop working.
2008-01-02T07:55:00.000Z	rppp01a		mEck0- ctrl alt backspace restarts it
2008-01-02T07:57:00.000Z	mEck0	rppp01a	yeah I know, but I must kill it because I can't install the driver for my 8800GT otherwise. the system must also be in runlevel 3. Have problems with this. I can boot without x (from the recovery mode in grub), but when I type telinit3, the xserver starts in low-graphics mode!). :(
