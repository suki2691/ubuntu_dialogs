2012-07-03T16:49:00.000Z	syrinx_priest		Hi all.  Currently on 10.04 and want to run the Upgrade to go to 12.04, but it doesn't show up in the Update Manager even though I have the LTS option selected.
2012-07-03T16:50:00.000Z	syrinx_priest		Shouldn't it be available now?
2012-07-03T16:51:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	syrinx_priest	 type !upgrade for instructions
