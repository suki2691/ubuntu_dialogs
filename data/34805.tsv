I have tried desktop zoom function from compiz and it apparentlly isnt compatible with video out and i have also tried changing the screen resolution. when i change resolution the text is enlarged but the second monitor "television" flickers really really badly. any ideas on how to either fix
2010-11-16T06:16:00.000Z	Chaos2358		 this or an app i can use to get same results?
