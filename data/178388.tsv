2006-09-27T07:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SuperSub	You need to export them from outlook in a different format. or into Thunderbird
2006-09-27T07:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SuperSub	No
2006-09-27T07:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	SuperSub	I never found one,  Thanks again to MS..  You can work around it like I said in how you export the file and get it into thunderbird etc
