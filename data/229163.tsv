2006-01-11T08:50:00.000Z	jason_		i reset the password to the same thing it was before, then i entered "flush privileges;" and reloaded my blog and it came right up
2006-01-11T08:50:00.000Z	jason_		what does flush privileges do magically, and would i have to do this all the time now after restarting
