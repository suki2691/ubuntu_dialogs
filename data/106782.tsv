2009-05-29T05:25:00.000Z	randomircuser		I need help with lvm.
2009-05-29T05:25:00.000Z	randomircuser		I followed this guide: http://www.debuntu.org/how-to-install-ubuntu-over-lvm-filesystem but Grub can't find the root partition. Error message is: "ALERT! /dev/mapper/lvmvol-root does not exist. Dropping to a shell."
2009-05-29T05:25:00.000Z	randomircuser		Any idea why the lvm partitions don't show under /dev/mapper?
