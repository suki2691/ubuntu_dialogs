2007-02-04T13:33:00.000Z	felixcanis11		i'm kind of new to ubuntu, i've been using gentoo for a while but got sick of it and now i'm confused cause i'm not sure how ubuntu works in some respects...so i'm trying to add/remove programs and it says i have to manually run "dpkg --configure -a"......but when i enter that in the Terminal it says i need superuser access......so how do i get that? i feel dumb :(
