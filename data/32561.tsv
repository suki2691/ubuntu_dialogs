2010-05-04T09:41:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	Adman65	yeah upgrade to 8.10, then 9.04, then 9.10, then 10.04. you would be better off just doing a clean install.
2010-05-04T09:44:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	Adman65	try this link, its for the beta but should work still for what you want. http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/lucid/beta1
2010-05-04T09:44:00.000Z	UbuntuJeff	Adman65	has a section called "Upgrading from Ubuntu 9.10 or Ubuntu 8.04 LTS"
