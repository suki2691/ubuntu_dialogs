2011-10-09T07:02:00.000Z	mokilok		Guys, I am having trouble getting Flash to work. I have downloaded and installed it through the Ubuntu software center but still doesn't seem to work for youtube clips?
2011-10-09T07:03:00.000Z	mokilok		I've also tried downloading the YUM and RPM from Adobe.com but I can't install them, the executables only bring up a terminal for one second then close.
