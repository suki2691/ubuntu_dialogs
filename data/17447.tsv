2012-05-21T14:32:00.000Z	johnm		then please mind your sarcastic responses, I'm attempting to help. There are a lot of epople in here seemingly complaining that the world on a stick doesnt exist in the repos, yet every tool required to make it so exists. It wouldn't be hard for you to make a start, start a ppa, log a bug, request for it to be accepted
2012-05-21T14:33:00.000Z	johnm		if you really want it in the repo, I suggest you start doing so yourself and give people a reason to consider it. Also, I don't think you'll see OBSD in the repo ;)
