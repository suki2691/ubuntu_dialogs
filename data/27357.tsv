2010-08-23T06:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linux-dj	its a full release, just the UI is optomised for smaller screens
2010-08-23T06:06:00.000Z	linux-dj	ActionParsnip	so as far as trouble shooting is concerned i can count it as a full release
2010-08-23T06:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	linux-dj	its optomised for smaller screens but the kernel is the generic one like the desktop and there are a few different apps by default
