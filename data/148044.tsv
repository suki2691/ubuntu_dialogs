2007-12-05T05:46:00.000Z	teprrr		hello there. just wanted to ask if there's a page where one can watch the packages going to hardy and so on?
2007-12-05T05:46:00.000Z	kelsin	teprrr	you can always search at packages.ubuntu.com, I don't know about any rss feed or anything
2007-12-05T05:46:00.000Z	teprrr		ie. one could see pending packages and why they're pending and so on
2007-12-05T05:47:00.000Z	teprrr	kelsin	yup, I know about p.u.c, but it doesn't have such an information :P
