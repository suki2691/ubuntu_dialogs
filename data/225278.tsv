2006-06-17T08:04:00.000Z	fiveiron		every time the restricted drivers and nvidia-glx are updated I end up running at 640x480.... *sigh*
2006-06-17T08:06:00.000Z	fiveiron		anyone else at 640x480 after these last nvidia-glx updates?
2006-06-17T08:06:00.000Z	Cin	fiveiron	nope... though mine was updated before... and I haven't restarted X yet. :O
