2009-09-22T05:29:00.000Z	mnemonic76		Is there any way to continue an incomplete installation of Jaunty? I thought the laptop was plugged in and went to bed... apparently the battery died before grub got installed. No /boot/grub directory and I get an 'error 17'
2009-09-22T05:29:00.000Z	CppIsWeird	mnemonic76	why not just start over? it would be much easier
2009-09-22T05:30:00.000Z	mnemonic76		The laptop cant boot to cd, I have to set up a PXE server and let it download EVERYTHING! It would suck...
2009-09-22T05:31:00.000Z	mnemonic76	CppIsWeird	I guess that is what I will do if need be... I am booted into sysrescuecd right now (chatting) and have the hd for the laptop mounted... is there some way to fix?
