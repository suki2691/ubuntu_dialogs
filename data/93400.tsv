2010-07-23T02:49:00.000Z	Pancakez		I booted ubuntu and eth0 has dissapeared.  It also doesn't work when I boot earlier kernels, however it does work when I boot windows 7.  Anybody have any idea how to fix it?

2010-07-23T02:54:00.000Z	violinappren	Pancakez	try first "ifconfig eth0 up" and see if it works
