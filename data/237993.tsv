2006-01-28T13:45:00.000Z	metalsand		Hi, I just installed Ubuntu - but am having issues with my screen's resolution. The only option I have is 1024x768 while my screen's native resolution is 1280x800.
2006-01-28T13:46:00.000Z	metalsand		Do I need to install graphical drivers to get resolutions for my laptop?

2006-01-28T13:46:00.000Z	metalsand	jldugger	There's only 1 option for Hz, too.
