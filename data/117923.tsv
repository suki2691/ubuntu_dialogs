2007-10-03T08:37:00.000Z	Tommy3		I cannot get apache2 to install properly. I must have hosed up the install/uninstall tool info for it.  Is there a way out of this?
2007-10-03T08:37:00.000Z	h1st0	Tommy3	How are you trying to install it?
2007-10-03T08:39:00.000Z	Tommy3	h1st0	I've probably tried too many wrong things.  The thing Im worried about is that I removed a lot of references to apache and apache2 in /etc and other places. new install attempts does not add them back.
