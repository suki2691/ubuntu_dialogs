2011-01-29T16:23:00.000Z	aphrek		Hi All, I've got a fresh install of 10.04 but the grub menu does not appear by default - it boot into the OS directly. How do I get the menu to appear? I've checked it's installed by using grub-install -v
2011-01-29T16:25:00.000Z	oCean	aphrek	ubuntu is only OS in the machine? Hold shift during boot, that will enter the grub menu
2011-01-29T16:26:00.000Z	aphrek	oCean	- it is the only installed OS - I tried the Shift key & nothing happened
2011-01-29T16:29:00.000Z	oCean	aphrek	It should though. I don't know of other options
