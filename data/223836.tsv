2009-08-07T04:14:00.000Z	th0r	bucky	hosts has to contain the name of the local host for X to work...sounds like that name isn't in /etc/hosts. But.....it sounds like jaunty was installed over something else, and that, of course, won't work
2009-08-09T04:32:00.000Z	th0r	bucky	if he is getting that error it is because he is running the 17 kernel (I think)
2009-08-09T04:32:00.000Z	th0r	bucky	but an odd numbered kernel is dev....shouldn't be run by someone who isn't a guru
