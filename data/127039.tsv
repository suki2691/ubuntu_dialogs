2007-07-29T08:24:00.000Z	lethologica		I am having trouble installing compiz-gnome it is stating it can't overwrite libgconf.so which is also in compiz-plugins, I deleted the file and it still gives the same error. ANy ideas what to do?

2007-07-29T08:25:00.000Z	lethologica	bruenig	what should I do then? Why does it point to that file, that seems senseless
