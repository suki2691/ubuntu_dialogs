2012-01-20T11:35:00.000Z	hexacode		hey you guys. i need some help with ubuntu. I use a netbook and it has a small screen. and some programs need me to stretch the window but i cant stretch it past a certain point. Eclipse for example requires that when i create a new class, i have to click on some other buttons on the gui, but i cant even see the buttons because they dont fit on screen
2012-01-20T11:36:00.000Z	metaspike	hexacode	you mean increase the window size?
2012-01-20T11:36:00.000Z	metaspike		cant you just maximize it or something?
