2012-03-05T21:59:00.000Z	Phinnay		Ubuntu server 11.10 will not allow me to log on - I type my username and password at console, it shows Welcome to Ubunto and then kicks me right back to a login prompt. Booted with Live CD and mounted / . What should I look at next?
2012-03-05T22:00:00.000Z	axisys	Phinnay	can you login to one of the text-based ttys ?
2012-03-05T22:02:00.000Z	axisys	Phinnay	so can you login as root?
2012-03-05T22:03:00.000Z	axisys	Phinnay	you really should be in #ubuntu-server .. i assumed you are on desktop since you are on this channel
