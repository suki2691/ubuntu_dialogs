2006-12-30T17:01:00.000Z	wastrel	Yodude	 ubuntu packages are organized into different repositories. the universe repository is not activated by default
2006-12-30T17:01:00.000Z	wastrel	Yodude	 so if you're looking for software in Universe you'll need to "enable" it first
2006-12-30T17:03:00.000Z	wastrel	Yodude	 in the synaptic package manager you can enable universe in settings -> repositories
