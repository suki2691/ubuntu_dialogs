2006-06-12T05:18:00.000Z	LabThug_hm		ok, what's the trick to seeing all the bugs after you login to launchpad.net?  All I can get it to do is show the ones assigned to me (0).
2006-06-12T05:19:00.000Z	gnomefreak	LabThug_hm	are you on the bug team?
2006-06-12T05:20:00.000Z	LabThug_hm	gnomefreak	no, but the last time I tried to file a bug I had to login
2006-06-12T05:20:00.000Z	gnomefreak	LabThug_hm	you have to log in
