2011-08-18T06:33:00.000Z	Nach0z		just outta curiosity, didn't Ubuntu used to come with a "install alongside windows" option? Now i'm having to repartition and everything manually >_<
2011-08-18T06:34:00.000Z	Nach0z		it doesn't have the "install alongside windows" option anymore
2011-08-18T06:34:00.000Z	Nach0z		it's just "delete windows" or "something else" :/
2011-08-18T06:35:00.000Z	MestreLion	Nach0z	it does still have that option
