2005-12-04T10:50:00.000Z	dawei		hello, all. i am trying to run root privileges (in other words, using sudo) but i can not under any circumstances. all my hardware and software are working (except my Nvidia stuff) - when i installed 5.04 (which is my first setup on a dualboot WinUbuntu) i did not set a password for root. when i use my personal acct password under sudo i am told my personal acct doesn't have privileges. any ideas?

2005-12-04T10:52:00.000Z	dawei	nalioth	root and my personal - i guess that means two
2005-12-04T10:53:00.000Z	nalioth	dawei	then why do you need sudo?
