2009-04-30T15:57:00.000Z	rolo		Can anyone help? Hiya. I'm running Jaunty, but all of a sudden when I click on any of my non linux drives to mount them, nothing happens. It worked fine until tiday. I don't get an error message or anything so I don't know how to troubleshoot. Will there be a log file or something somewhere? Cheers.
