2011-10-29T08:21:00.000Z	jjustman		Hello! I'm trying to change from kernel 2.6.32-34 to 2.6.32-33 for compatibility with a binary kernel module. How do I do this without breaking anything?

2011-10-29T08:25:00.000Z	jjustman	xangua	yes, but how do I make that change persist?
2011-10-29T08:25:00.000Z	jjustman	xangua	I'm thinking maybe by editing /etc/defaults/grub
