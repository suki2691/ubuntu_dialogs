2010-03-21T21:03:00.000Z	leonardo		Hi people, I was using Debian Squeeze and had a problem after an update where I can't see all the screen. I tried everything but didn't find a solution. So I installed Ubuntu 10.04 and after an hibernate I have the same problem. The resolution config is ok, so I don't know what is the problem and how fix it
