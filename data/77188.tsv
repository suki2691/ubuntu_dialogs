2010-05-18T21:09:00.000Z	kong		I just screwed up my /bin/mount and /bin/umount commands, can someone tell me what chmod number will return the original ownership to it... Is it 755?

2010-05-18T21:12:00.000Z	kong	costre	yeah this sucks i cant mount anything now i chmod'ed it 777 and now its f-ed, do you know what command i should use to fix it?
2010-05-18T21:12:00.000Z	costre	kong	Sorry ... try to google it, there is quite extensive lists somewhere on the interweb
