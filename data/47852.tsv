2009-11-18T11:28:00.000Z	guybrush		Hello, sorry for bothering you all, but I've just installed 9.10 and now XP doesn't show up in my GRUB anymore... I'm reading through the wiki but don't understand what they are explaining.  Is anyone here familiar with how GRUB works?

2009-11-18T11:32:00.000Z	guybrush	theadmin	it is grub2
2009-11-18T11:33:00.000Z	theadmin	guybrush	Okay thanks, than "sudo update-grub2" would do i think
