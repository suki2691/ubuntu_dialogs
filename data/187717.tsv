2012-04-05T15:58:00.000Z	ikonia	ron__	what does the access and error log show ?
2012-04-05T15:59:00.000Z	ron__		it shows nothing.. it isnt throwing up any errors it simply decided to stop parsing php on anything other than the default host
2012-04-05T16:04:00.000Z	ron__	ikonia	there are no errors in the error log beyond normal 405 errors etc.
