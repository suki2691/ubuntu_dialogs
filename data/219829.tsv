2007-04-07T12:19:00.000Z	olroy		Hey, what's the Difference between Ubuntu & Kubuntu.  I know one is KDE & one Gnome...but what does that mean in real life terms?  :)
2007-04-07T12:20:00.000Z	Flannel	olroy	just different GUI environments, and then the associated programs that go with each (KDE apps in Kubuntu, Gnome apps in gnome, etc)
2007-04-07T12:23:00.000Z	Flannel	olroy	they're both designed for X, obviously.  And you'd be using completely different programs, so there'd obviously be a difference.  As to which is better, that's personal preference
2007-04-07T12:24:00.000Z	Flannel	olroy	It's possible to run both on the same Ubuntu (the linux distro) install.  Just install one with the CD, then apt-get the other.
