2010-01-14T07:22:00.000Z	blakkheim	Mike_lifeguard	aptitude full-upgrade
2010-01-14T07:23:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	blakkheim	thanks - but why would they be 'held back'?
2010-01-14T07:23:00.000Z	blakkheim	Mike_lifeguard	i'm not an ubuntu dev, don't ask me. they have "their own" way of doing things that no other distro does
