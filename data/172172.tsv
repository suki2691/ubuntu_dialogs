2007-09-24T06:37:00.000Z	soundray	zenmonk	if it's not on the path, enter the full pathname. Or try './yourprogram' if it's in the present working directory
2007-09-24T06:38:00.000Z	zenmonk	soundray	thats it.  Do you know what a segmentation fault is?
2007-09-24T06:39:00.000Z	soundray	zenmonk	it's what is called a general protection fault in Windows. A program trying to access memory ranges that it's not allowed to access.
