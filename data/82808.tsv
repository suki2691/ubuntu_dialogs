2009-04-03T01:08:00.000Z	TheCheeks		What do you use when writing a script to pull up a file name? Trying to get rTorrent to twitter when its done with a torrent...
2009-04-03T01:08:00.000Z	guntbert	TheCheeks	are you sure that is  a case for ubuntu support?
2009-04-03T01:10:00.000Z	guntbert	TheCheeks	I don't know, but you *could* get a pointer in #ubuntu-offtopic (these are called "channels" here not forums, btw)
