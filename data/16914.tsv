2011-03-17T21:28:00.000Z	brightspark	llutz_	yeah I didn't see his first line.  based on the error message I did see, that was the solution that came to mind.
2011-03-17T21:29:00.000Z	llutz_	brightspark	is his case, rm -r   would have removed the directory (by mistake)
2011-03-17T21:32:00.000Z	brightspark	llutz_	like I said, I didn't have the part where he claimed it was a symlink.  -r would have, as you pointed out, overridden the error.
