2007-03-14T13:21:00.000Z	Pollywog		I wonder if Melania has recently upgraded
2007-03-14T13:21:00.000Z	Pollywog		when I upgraded to Edgy things got messed up, like my fstab
2007-03-14T13:22:00.000Z	Pollywog		btw why did Linux (or Ubuntu) change the device names?
2007-03-14T13:22:00.000Z	PirateHead	Pollywog	I always need to re-write my fstab and /boot/grub/menu.list when Ubuntu upgrades. Make sure you always back those up between upgrades.
