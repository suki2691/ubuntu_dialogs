2009-04-20T01:03:00.000Z	philipp2084		any one that can give me some guidance towards partitioning? Any links?
2009-04-20T01:04:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	philipp2084	What do you need beyond the tutorials on help.ubuntu.com?
2009-04-20T01:06:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	philipp2084	depends what you'll be using them for, really
2009-04-20T01:10:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	philipp2084	so you probably want a separate /home partition then - not sure what the relative sizes would need to be though
