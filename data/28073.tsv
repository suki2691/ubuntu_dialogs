2010-08-02T04:23:00.000Z	headkase314	Sir_Konrad	You'll have to use the built-in open-source ones, proprietary doesn't support hardware that old anymore unless you install and go back to like ubuntu 7
2010-08-02T04:23:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	headkase314	wow ok.
2010-08-02T04:24:00.000Z	headkase314	Sir_Konrad	It's because driver support was discontinued in the proprietary drivers and stuff like the X server has changed too much since those were current.
