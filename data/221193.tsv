2008-10-14T20:14:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ttt--_	Might be a memory fragmentation issue. How much RAM do you have to play with?
2008-10-14T20:15:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ttt--_	That was not the question.
2008-10-14T20:16:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ttt--_	Well, then memory fragmentation is not the prime suspect. Which media player and which encoding are we talking about here?
