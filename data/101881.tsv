2008-01-30T05:59:00.000Z	Carbonflux		I had to do a dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg to get my resolution settings to work correctly, and edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf directly or use nivida-settings, the UI information is wrong.
2008-01-30T05:59:00.000Z	Carbonflux		nvidia-settings generates a proper file tho
2008-01-30T06:01:00.000Z	Carbonflux		seems like a bug has crept into the latest nvidia driver that causes it to fail to detect the proper mode settings for a monitor by default
2008-01-30T06:02:00.000Z	Mm|Spunky	Carbonflux	was that answer to me?
