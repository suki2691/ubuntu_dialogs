2006-11-10T12:54:00.000Z	Fulcrum		i thought it'd be larger
2006-11-10T12:55:00.000Z	Fulcrum		anyone have any idea why server is smaller?
2006-11-10T12:55:00.000Z	Lathiat	Fulcrum	because it doesnt have as many packages on it
2006-11-10T12:56:00.000Z	Lathiat	Fulcrum	its no real difference to the 'alternate' cd functionally, but it just includies a bunch of server-related packages on the cd
