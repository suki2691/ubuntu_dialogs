2005-05-24T06:35:00.000Z	Shufla	mr_roboto	but binary driver is not needed for normal user. for twaeking gcc is needed, i told about _almost_ all using - web, chat, documents, some games
2005-05-24T06:37:00.000Z	mr_roboto	Shufla	I think we might have a different idea about what a normal user is. I think most "normal" users like fast 3d :)   Yes, you CAN get by without gcc but would you want to?
2005-05-24T06:38:00.000Z	Shufla	mr_roboto	normal user is my sister, mum, my dance teacher. we are _not_ ordinary users. we are, ehhh, [any % here] power users
