After a while, I decided I did not need the file any longer and got rid of it as per Truecrypt instructions (mount file, remove insides, unmount file, delete file). However, the 3GB of space I set aside for the file did not get recovered by the USB drive. What's going on?
2010-04-28T16:05:00.000Z	Ari_Lazarus		I'm hoping it wouldn't have to come to that.

2010-04-28T16:06:00.000Z	lxsysweb	Ari_Lazarus	just an idea, is the file moved into .Trash-1000 or similar on the usb drive?
