2009-10-23T10:35:00.000Z	vtec_		Hello I'm trying to make my Ubuntu windows transparent, I have jaunty 9.04 and compiz, how can I do this? I've seen pictures of Ubuntu with transparent windows
2009-10-23T10:35:00.000Z	bazhang	vtec_	should be in the plugins section of ccsm
2009-10-23T10:42:00.000Z	bazhang	vtec_	do you have ccsm installed
2009-10-23T10:42:00.000Z	bazhang	vtec_	that is one of the plugins iirc you may wish to get expert advice in #compiz if no one here knows
