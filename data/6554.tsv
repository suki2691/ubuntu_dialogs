2012-06-16T21:36:00.000Z	NastyNaz		what's the += command for VB? I want to do 'integer += 2'
2012-06-16T21:37:00.000Z	dlentz	NastyNaz	probably the wrong channel for that
2012-06-16T21:37:00.000Z	dlentz		if VB is like C++, then integer += 2 means integer = integer +2
2012-06-16T21:38:00.000Z	NastyNaz	dlentz	I know C++, I dont know VB. I was wondering if it was the same.
