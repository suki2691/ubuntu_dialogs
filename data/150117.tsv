2007-06-26T10:22:00.000Z	vertigo		no idea, i just like to be able to access everything without having to type commands.. :)
2007-06-26T10:23:00.000Z	vertigo		would get me a security prob though.. btw, are there any Linux Virusscanners / Adaware scanners? I know linux is extremely safe.. but safe enough to run without?
2007-06-26T10:23:00.000Z	vertigo		tnx kritzstapf and Pici :)
2007-06-26T10:23:00.000Z	Pici	vertigo	er, thats not what I wanted.  clamav is available if you want a virus scanner.
