2012-07-02T00:25:00.000Z	fe80	zykotick9	why are they bad suggestions?
2012-07-02T00:26:00.000Z	zykotick9	fe80	smb is windows and thus unreliable/buggy.  ftp just needs to die!
2012-07-02T00:28:00.000Z	fe80	zykotick9	i know smb is for windows isnt that what he needed and since when did it become unreliable and buggy. i use it every day and have for years. and ftp is very stable and fast not to mention makes sure that the file you are trying to access makes it across the network complete.
