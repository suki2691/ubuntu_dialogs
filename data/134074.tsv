2007-05-16T12:32:00.000Z	WindowLess		i have a fresh instnall of ubuntu 7.04. what's the _correct_ way to install multimedia (e.g. Flash)? thanks
2007-05-16T12:33:00.000Z	danny3793	WindowLess	try to let FireFox do that, i let FF do it by itself and it installed just fine :P
2007-05-16T12:33:00.000Z	danny3793	WindowLess	it used Adobe though
2007-05-16T12:33:00.000Z	WindowLess	danny3793	i thought there was something we could do in ubuntu (add/remove or terminal) that would install all multimedia stuff in one go
