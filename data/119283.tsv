2008-02-12T07:46:00.000Z	mikeaz		I need to get HFS+ write support in Linux. Can anyone help me in my noble quest?
2008-02-12T07:46:00.000Z	bazhang	mikeaz	does gparted support that?
2008-02-12T07:47:00.000Z	mikeaz	bazhang	i don't know. my gparted doesn't even start up because i don't have a floppy drive. isn't that silly?
2008-02-12T07:48:00.000Z	bazhang	mikeaz	floppy? this is cd based--you should test on the gparted live cd or the parted magic (cant recall the name) www.distrowatch.com latest you can check there
