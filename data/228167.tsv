2007-02-21T11:50:00.000Z	Nastasia		I installed Ubuntu on my 2nd harddrive to test it, but I need to get rid of it completely so that I will only have 2 NTFS partitions with windows on the first. Is there any way to uninstall it? I tried just whipping it out but the computer didn't boot anymore because the boot-screen was deleted I think.
2007-02-21T11:51:00.000Z	Nastasia		What will I need to do after fdisk /MBR?
2007-02-21T11:52:00.000Z	feross	Nastasia	well, ms-sys will also fix the mbr .. just a suggestion instead of having to boot windows
