2008-01-22T20:46:00.000Z	h1st0	Pie-rate	it should put an applet by the clock.  Just right click on the applet and check box show rhythmbox
2008-01-22T20:52:00.000Z	Pie-rate	h1st0	yeah.... that has absolutely nothing to do with my question. i want the CLOSE button to do what the CLOSE button should do, and CLOSE the window, instead of being a QUIT button.
