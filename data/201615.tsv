2010-06-12T23:13:00.000Z	kary		Hello, I have a server install of 10.04, and I just ran my updates and rebooted, and now the system won't boot fully.  Right now, i'm just trying to figure out how to get my grub boot screen so i can select my old kernel, but I can't get that to come up before boot.  I've pressed Esc numerous times.  Is there a new way?

2010-06-12T23:14:00.000Z	kary	MeanEYE	looks like it freezes after a check of partitions and says something like "init: ureadahead main process (327) terminated".  I'm running a software raid
