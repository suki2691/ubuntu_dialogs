2008-01-21T18:59:00.000Z	n00br1c3		I have two hard drives on my comp 1 has windows the other has ubuntu 7.10 and when i restart my comp it asks which OS i want to boot and etc.. well i removed my ubuntu hard drive and my windows hard drive would not boot. All it would say was "grub loading please wait... Error21"
