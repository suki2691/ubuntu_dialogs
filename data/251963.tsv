2005-02-25T11:48:00.000Z	gazakii		i've been looking for the kernel-source package  by browsing through the ftp. I cant use synptic because i need the kernel source to get my modem to work. I found kernel-source-2.6.8_2.6.8-7_all.deb. but the kernel warty has is 2.6.8.1-3-386. is this the correct package anyway?
2005-02-25T11:49:00.000Z	eyequeue	gazakii	 look for linux-source-*
2005-02-25T11:49:00.000Z	eyequeue	gazakii	 kernel-* is debian, iirc
2005-02-25T11:55:00.000Z	eyequeue	gazakii	 i'd say the former
