2010-11-22T20:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	maxylopes	 i would check the forums to see if anyone else has that scanner working.. Canon has very poor linux support.
2010-11-22T20:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	maxylopes	 and check the 'sane'  scanner driver web site.
2010-11-22T20:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	maxylopes	 sounds like you got 'mouse over focus' set some where in the menus if you have to have  the mouse in a window to 'activate' it.. im not even sure where that setting is at.. its not the default
