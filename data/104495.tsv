2010-11-03T20:12:00.000Z	romulusnr		Is netbook ubuntu significantly different than non-netbook ubuntu? Are they similar enough that I could just install netbook remix on a regular box and just use gnome session and it would be the same?
2010-11-03T20:13:00.000Z	romulusnr		I"d appreciate info, this is for a work computer, all i have is a netbook remix installer.
