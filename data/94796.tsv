2008-08-26T13:07:00.000Z	Ckataklysm		whats the best file system to use for l;inux? ext2 or ext 3?
2008-08-26T13:08:00.000Z	Kohlrak	Ckataklysm	ext3 since it's a later version i would assume
2008-08-26T13:09:00.000Z	Kohlrak	Ckataklysm	prevents fragmentation and protects from corruption during poweroutages
2008-08-26T13:10:00.000Z	Kohlrak	Ckataklysm	so is almost everyone else, that's why we're here.
