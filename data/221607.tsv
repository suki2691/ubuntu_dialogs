2005-09-05T08:47:00.000Z	rbirkby		I've been unable to boot Breezy properly for a month. Can anyone help? The problem can be seen at: http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/1769
2005-09-05T08:49:00.000Z	X3N	rbirkby	looks like a broken package or the permissions on the package are wrong
2005-09-05T08:50:00.000Z	rbirkby	X3N	I tried deleting the package and redownloading, I tried looking at the /usr install location - doesn't exist. So I touched a file to make it exist. It all still fails
2005-09-05T08:51:00.000Z	rbirkby	X3N	libmp4 seems to have a whole string of dependancies that makes it virtually impossible to remove
