I previously had a "mixer type" gui tool that let me select what programs audio would be sent to which sound output.  It was working perfectly but I can't remember the packages and randomly installing jack, pulse etc broke my last installation.

2009-09-11T12:31:00.000Z	korogiannos	hateball	thanks. I'll check it out.  It won't be the chooser as I had it installed from the repos.
