2012-02-13T09:35:00.000Z	nug700		I'm trying to install the ubuntu recomended NVIDIA drivers on ubuntu 11.10, but I need to install nvidia-glx before I can install the drivers. Is that correct
2012-02-13T09:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	nug700	 the druvers in the repos pulled that in for me
2012-02-13T09:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	nug700	 you ran the nvidia-settings tool?
2012-02-13T09:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	nug700	 sudo service lightdm restart
