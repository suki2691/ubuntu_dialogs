2008-06-20T08:24:00.000Z	Metatron^		can anyone suggest how to get my xorg setup, old ati card, no gnome, xorg.conf has all default vaules, no values for card, have tried sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and sudo xdebconfigurator, the later seems to show correct values but they are not added to xorg.conf

2008-06-20T08:25:00.000Z	dmsuperman_		I have a nvidia 7900 GS KO video card. I have downloaded several different versions of the driver, all of which have (at some point in time) worked, so it's not that they're incompatible. Whenever I reboot, I have low settings mode. Stopping X, reinstalling the driver (even the same one I already have downloaded), and starting X again makes the whole thing run smoothly. Once I reboot again, however, I must run through this proces
2008-06-20T08:26:00.000Z	Metatron^	dmsuperman_	other distro's i get an xorg with ati driver, or mach64 driver, and im missing a higher resolution i can run on other distro's
