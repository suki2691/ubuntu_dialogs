2007-08-17T13:46:00.000Z	xike		anyone know why startx would complain about "no screens found"?  I've run xorg-reconfigure with settings I know worked before, but it's not happy
2007-08-17T13:47:00.000Z	xike		it's the same computer :P
2007-08-17T13:47:00.000Z	xike		it says "(EE) No devices detected" and then no screens found
2007-08-17T13:48:00.000Z	THX-1138	xike	Is there an xorg.conf backup file you might reuse? Ubuntu has them located in /etc/X11/
