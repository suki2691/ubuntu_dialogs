2005-08-07T16:39:00.000Z	kaffeend		so I have d/lodaed the live Ubuntu for AMD 64, I browse the cd contents and there's an .ISO file there, but when I try to boot from the cd it ignores it and boots to windows xp login like normal. I was told that it shouldn't show a .ISO but a bunch of different files and fiolders - I'm lost, and soooo close to deleting this Ubuntu thing

2005-08-07T16:39:00.000Z	abarbaccia	kaffeend	you need to burn the iso as an image not as a file
2005-08-07T16:39:00.000Z	abarbaccia	kaffeend	go into your CD burner and OPEN the iso file
