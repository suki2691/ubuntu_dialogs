2008-11-29T21:11:00.000Z	RB2		Good Afternoon. I re-installed Windows and I'm attempting to get grub functioning again. I following the directions on help.ubuntu.com, but haven't been successful. Any help would be greatly appreciated. (fdisk output: http://pastebin.ca/1270279)

2008-11-29T21:14:00.000Z	RB2	loxley_	That's what I'm trying to do, but haven't had any success. No error messages, just grub doesn't load when I reboot. I'm sure it's something silly on my part, but frustrating none the less.
2008-11-29T21:21:00.000Z	RB2	loxley_	I think part of the issue is that Windows is on the first disk and Ubuntu is on the second disk, not two partitions on the same drive. All of the directions I seem to find address the latter situation.
