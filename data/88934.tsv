2008-08-16T16:48:00.000Z	eraldo		I bought the Canon MP210 printer but the linux drivers are i386 but my machine is 64bit... what shall I do now ?
2008-08-16T16:49:00.000Z	yoyoned	eraldo	ubuntu proboly comes with the right drivers.
2008-08-16T16:50:00.000Z	eraldo	yoyoned	when I plugged it in... I could only chose "find driver" and all it set was the generic text only one
2008-08-16T16:51:00.000Z	eraldo	yoyoned	seems like it does not supply the right one
