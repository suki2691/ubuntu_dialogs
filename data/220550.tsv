2007-11-19T10:49:00.000Z	Flannel	judgernaught	The DVD has both the liveCD and the text based installer, and includes more packages
2007-11-19T10:49:00.000Z	Flannel	judgernaught	that is, more packages in the repos on the CD
2007-11-19T10:51:00.000Z	Flannel	judgernaught	The packages will be outdated already, so unless you're using it somewhere that has no internet, you don't really get any benefit
