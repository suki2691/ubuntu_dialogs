2010-05-04T13:00:00.000Z	ectospasm		I'm having a brain fart (too much stuff going on in my life), what's the command to upgrade from 9.10->10.04, using apt-get or aptitude?  I'm thinking "aptitude dist-upgrade..." Am I correct?
2010-05-04T13:01:00.000Z	markatto	ectospasm	you have to change your sources first for that to work, I think
2010-05-04T13:01:00.000Z	ectospasm	markatto	OK, I thought it might be something like that.
2010-05-04T13:03:00.000Z	markatto	ectospasm	don't trust my advice on that too much, I don't actually use ubuntu ;P
