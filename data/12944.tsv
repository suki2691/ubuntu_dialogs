2011-07-04T06:30:00.000Z	roasted	Nobgul-bnc	well I installed grub2 onto a 4gb flash drive, and I set up a grub config file with the menu entry to my ubuntu iso. But it tanks when I try to boot. I just get a grub> prompt
2011-07-04T06:35:00.000Z	roasted	Nobgul-bnc	actually I may have just fixed it. I had the wrong menu entry in. I guess the youtube video I watched was old. Hey, if I use the same menu entry settings for linux mint, think I'd be able to multi boot it as well? I can't find the specific mint settings. :(
