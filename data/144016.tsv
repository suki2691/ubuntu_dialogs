2008-02-03T06:05:00.000Z	fleishman		Greetings, I am having trouble finding the package "compizconfig-settings-manager" in Synaptic.  It lists several compiz packages, all of which i have installed, but the settings manager is not listed as an option to install.  i have an Nvidia 8600GTS which i have the drives installed for.  how do i get compizconfig-settings-manager so that i can utilize the 3d effects?
