2006-10-31T13:05:00.000Z	timalot	BHSPitLappy	when i close the lid it turns off... but sometimes i forget to do this ...
2006-10-31T13:05:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	timalot	when I close mine, the lcd turns off, but a few seconds/minutes? later it turns back on, for the screensaver or some dumb reason.  Causes the laptop to overheat if I go somewhere.
