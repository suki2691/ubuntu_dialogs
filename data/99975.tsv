2009-01-25T00:57:00.000Z	allquixotic	n8tuser	Tell it to Speeder. It's a matter of opinion, I think, and it depends on the amount of headache the user has already had to go through to set up their system the way it is now.
2009-01-25T00:58:00.000Z	allquixotic	n8tuser	I've had a very different experience with upgrades, so to each his own :) If Speeder has a relatively uncustomized install of Ubuntu 7.10, a fresh install would be easier, I agree.
