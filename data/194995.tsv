2009-10-31T00:55:00.000Z	Trezker		Hi, I have a pulseaudio issue
2009-10-31T00:56:00.000Z	Trezker		When I mark pulseaudio for complete removal, it also removes ubuntu-desktop
2009-10-31T00:56:00.000Z	Trezker		is that something I need or can just not give a *?
2009-10-31T00:57:00.000Z	Scunizi	Trezker	it's just a meta package.. wont' hurt anything
