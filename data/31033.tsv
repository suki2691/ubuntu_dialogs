2010-06-02T21:14:00.000Z	dan2		hey guys I need some help here.  I've got a laptop with an nvidia card that has multiple outs, vga, and hdmi.  When I plug a screen into the HDMI port, it tries to make my HDMI screen my second screen
2010-06-02T21:15:00.000Z	dan2		how do I get my laptop to do normal behavior of one screen on and one screen off?
