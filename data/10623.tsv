2011-08-12T18:00:00.000Z	javier__	Majestik	escott: I guess that's it. I rebooted, but get the same ip all the time. The problem is that it looks like I share that ip with other people, and some internet services detect us as the same person, and I cannot use those services (like megaupload, web storage of files)
