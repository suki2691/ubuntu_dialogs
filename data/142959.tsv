2007-12-11T01:12:00.000Z	kharloss		I'm still testing my website and and I want to put a .htaccess file on there to allow some ip-addresses to go to the website, and to deny others.
2007-12-11T01:12:00.000Z	kharloss		How can I do this?

2007-12-11T01:13:00.000Z	preaction_	kharloss	your best bet would be to join #apache on this network
