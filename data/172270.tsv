2009-07-24T15:11:00.000Z	kanub		i have a laptop without a disk drive, so i want to install Ubuntu from a USB drive. i found the following documentation already: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromImgFiles , but it only offers a .img file for the netbook version. how do i get the desktop version on a USB drive? or how can i convert the .iso to .img?
