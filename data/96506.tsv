2009-10-14T20:49:00.000Z	RS-232		My HD died yesterday, no reason, anyway I bought a new one, and I decided to install the 9.04 64bits version (I was using before the 8.10 32 bits version). Have I done the right thing? I feel like things not working completely well...since 64 bits has always had problems...
2009-10-14T20:50:00.000Z	RS-232		My system only show 3.8 GB, but I have 4, ...is this normal?
2009-10-14T20:50:00.000Z	lanoxx	RS-232	using 64bit since 2 years now, works quite well for me
2009-10-14T20:51:00.000Z	lanoxx	RS-232	thats normal because ram is calculated as MB and your system shows it as MiB
