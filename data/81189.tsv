2008-11-18T20:26:00.000Z	TJ-42		which configuration file contains which groups a user belongs to?
2008-11-18T20:26:00.000Z	fde	TJ-42	umm, /etc/group  (not plural)
2008-11-18T20:26:00.000Z	TJ-42	fde	ah, heh, thanks :-)
2008-11-18T20:27:00.000Z	fde	TJ-42	remember that primary group is defined in /etc/passwd though
