2008-01-02T01:24:00.000Z	okeefenokee	ahimaj	Previous post (sorry for the spam) Hi folks. And Happy New Year! I recently tried to upgrade my edgy-installation (running in command-line mode) to feisty/gutsy. I entered sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade and a lot of things happened. After reboot, though, my system tells me it's still edgy. Am I missing something?
