2005-01-30T08:36:00.000Z	nyxx		guys, my main computer died so I'm running ubuntu livecd on a secondary computer with no internal hdd.. I do have a external usb drive (plugged into usb1.1 unfortunately) is there a way to have it save my changes on it (I don't care if I have to continue using the livecd)
2005-01-30T08:37:00.000Z	nyxx		well, I meant stuff like changes I made to x-chat and potentially extra software packages (I'm probably stretching it with that hope though)

2005-01-30T08:40:00.000Z	nyxx	Falstius	my main pc is completely down due to mobo death.. I can't make any new cds right now :(
