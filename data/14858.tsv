2011-04-30T11:06:00.000Z	loworbit		Great :)  I have set up ruby on rails for development.  When I start the server via 'rails s' it start fine.  However when i hit Ctrl-C it does not kill the server as expected?
2011-04-30T11:07:00.000Z	jla	loworbit	does it fork away from the console? might need to kill <pid>
2011-04-30T11:07:00.000Z	loworbit	jla	Not sure.  I do know that on 10.10 I was able to Ctrl-C to kill
