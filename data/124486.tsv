2008-04-11T00:38:00.000Z	jdn		I have an external harddrive that I use with ubuntu. Everytime I reboot it makes a new mount locaton in media. The first mount for example was everything, the next reboot is everything_, the next is everything__, so on and so on, is there a way to get rid of the clutter of "everything" folders/mounts that are residing in my /media location?
2008-04-11T00:39:00.000Z	jdn		Oh, I'm using the Hardy Heron beta.
