2011-02-19T19:32:00.000Z	blkdg		hello, i am using ubuntu 10.4. 32 bit, and it is completely patched.  It has a SIS integrated video card.  I have turned the screen saver off. When I Suspend the machine, the monitor turns Off.  How can I get it to function after the Suspend ends?
2011-02-19T19:32:00.000Z	BuMpIc	blkdg	yes and there was only this: Execute the file install.sh      -----> ./install.sh
