2008-04-14T10:26:00.000Z	fortruth		yes ,i know! to install need root, but in root it can't locate the package when i press key
2008-04-14T10:27:00.000Z	nickrud	fortruth	   try:   gksu synaptic
2008-04-14T10:30:00.000Z	nickrud	fortruth	you mean, when you don't run as root, when you press 's' it jumps to packages that start with s ? It doesn't do that here in either
