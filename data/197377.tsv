2006-11-29T06:21:00.000Z	reiki	lullabud	are you kidding?  It has way more than windows. :)   ok... except for some stuff that will ONLY run in windows but I've gotten around all but ONE of those for myself
2006-11-29T06:22:00.000Z	lullabud	reiki	 i installed windows 98 the other day and it was a nightmare since auto-updates aren't working and drivers are hard to find, so i totally agree.
