2009-10-30T19:24:00.000Z	t00r		I have a problem, I have to order some ubuntu-cd for my student-comitee to make in install party and when I log in shipit, it says I actually receive some cd
2009-10-30T19:24:00.000Z	t00r		what can I do to get some cd's?
2009-10-30T19:24:00.000Z	Bodsda	t00r	shipit, or download them
2009-10-30T19:26:00.000Z	t00r	Bodsda	ActionParsnip1  shipit doesnt let me order them and to give them to new users it's always better to have "original"-cd
