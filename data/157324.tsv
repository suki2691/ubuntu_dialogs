2006-11-25T07:49:00.000Z	pv2b	DARKGuy	are you sure you really want to have a monitor running at 1024x768 interlaced?
2006-11-25T07:50:00.000Z	DARKGuy	pv2b	Well, it's the highest it can run... at 60Hz it shows scrolling video gibberish o.o;
2006-11-25T07:51:00.000Z	pv2b	DARKGuy	but yeah, you should be able to tweak yourself a modeline to do that. i've never done itmyself. try googling around gfor x11 modeline orsomething
