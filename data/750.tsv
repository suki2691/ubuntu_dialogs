And my medium-term solution was to rebind keys on the numeric keypad to send what the busted keys used to send.  (And I've also pried off the keycaps and moved them there.)  I thought you folks might be amused by that hack.

2012-10-25T14:20:00.000Z	Karlo_	jrib	that's the long-term solution, of course.  :-)
