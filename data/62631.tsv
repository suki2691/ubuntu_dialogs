2012-05-01T03:12:00.000Z	JamesB		Say, is it possible to upgrade from Ubuntu 12.04 to a different distro without reinstalling?
2012-05-01T03:13:00.000Z	JamesB		Well, for instance, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, possibly Debian etc. if the former two have the same changes as ubuntu 10.04->12.04...
2012-05-01T03:14:00.000Z	iceroot	JamesB	you can easily install xubuntu/kubuntu/lubuntu by "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop" or "lubuntu-desktop" and so on, a change to debian is not possible
