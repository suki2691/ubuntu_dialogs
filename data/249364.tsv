2005-04-19T06:26:00.000Z	stranger		here is one Irishman's response about the Ireland comment
2005-04-19T06:26:00.000Z	stranger		The notice says that "The European commission has just passed its directive on software patents, violating democratic rules and procedures to the sole benefit of big non-European corporation and Ireland". As an Irish citizen, I'd like to know how the hell this benefits us.
