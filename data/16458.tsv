2011-04-30T23:51:00.000Z	rgr	akashm1990	no. Not with minimal effort. depends on HOW your current partitions are set up. You MUST do your homework. Dont listen to the "its easy" advice.
2011-04-30T23:53:00.000Z	rgr	akashm1990	it might be. But be careful. Tjhere are oodles of issues with many many people. its not me making things up.
