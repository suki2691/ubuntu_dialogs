2007-11-23T01:02:00.000Z	fiveiron	emma	he said lightweight... xchat is anything but.  irssi is lightest
2007-11-23T01:03:00.000Z	emma	fiveiron	in what way do I ever experience the non-lightness of xchat?
2007-11-23T01:03:00.000Z	fiveiron	emma	maybe none.  those with slower systems might notice immediately though
