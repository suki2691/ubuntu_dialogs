2011-06-08T07:02:00.000Z	saulotoledo		After system upgrade my system is crashing ant putting a message "panic occurred, switching back to text console". This happens when I use Skype at video calls, for example
2011-06-08T07:03:00.000Z	julie	saulotoledo	this is a a kernel issue
2011-06-08T07:05:00.000Z	saulotoledo	julie	Polah, ratzz: Before upgrade I think I'm was running 2.6.38-8, now I have 2.6.38-10. But the message now occurs with -8, -9 and -10 versions. This confused me, why stopped working at versions before upgrade? Or I'm wrong?
