2010-06-20T18:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jack__	 last time i messed with a tablet. i had to configure that in the gimp settings somewhere. (2 yrs ago)
2010-06-20T18:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jack__	 load gimp.. look in its settings.. play with them till it works.
2010-06-20T18:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jack__	 thers been so many changes to gimp and how X handles input devices in the last few years..   it would take me time to figure it out.
