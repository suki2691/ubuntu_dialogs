2007-06-13T07:48:00.000Z	aMMuNix		anyone know why can't I unmount my hdd so I can resize it? (I'm in the liveCD right now, each unmount to the HD, mounts it back up)
2007-06-13T07:48:00.000Z	aMMuNix		GParted, right click > unmount

2007-06-13T07:48:00.000Z	aMMuNix	carlosqueso	will check that out thanks
