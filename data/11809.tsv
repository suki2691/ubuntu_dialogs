2011-07-20T10:42:00.000Z	wasanzy_		some quick question
2011-07-20T10:44:00.000Z	wasanzy_		am trying to use cp command to copy files and directories to another directory with the -f parameter, but it is still asking me to confirm before copy could take effect, I want to actually force the copy
2011-07-20T10:45:00.000Z	ZiRiu	wasanzy_	did you try using su?
