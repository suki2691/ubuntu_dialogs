2009-12-05T12:36:00.000Z	Linux-CLI		Please recommend a way I can S-Video to work on my computer. I'm happy to use any Operating System except Windows to do this. As long as I am able to get that Operating System to play WMV. I am using a Dell Inspiron 700m. Which Operating System supports S-Video for my hardware?
