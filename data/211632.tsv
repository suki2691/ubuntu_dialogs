2007-12-22T19:13:00.000Z	fsufitch		hey guys, i have a computer that i just saved from getting thrown away, but i have some problems: its sound card and network card seem completely incompatible with ubuntu; I can deal with no sound, but the network is sort of necessary... I would buy it a simple NIC, but the trouble is I can't run a network cable all across my house to the router/modem/switch/everything else, so I need a wireless card. Any advice on what I should get?
