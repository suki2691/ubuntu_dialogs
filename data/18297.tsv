2011-02-09T20:56:00.000Z	NightNine	Geko	are you talking about completely formatting the drive both times?
2011-02-09T21:04:00.000Z	NightNine	Geko	Yes, I've gone back and forth from windows -> dual boot -> linux -> windows without any problems, both linux and windows disks can format everything the way they need to be formatted
