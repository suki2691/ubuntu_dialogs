2010-10-17T22:04:00.000Z	Xase		So I'm looking to boot my windows 7 retail disc off of a hard drive partition, as now my daughter has sucessfully broken my disc tray, can grub accomplish this?, and does anyone know a rough example entry that'll help me set it up? I am aware I will need to repair grub and have already set up a thumb drive to do so.
2010-10-17T22:05:00.000Z	Xase		Why?
2010-10-17T22:05:00.000Z	Memnochxx	Xase	can your computer not boot from usb?
