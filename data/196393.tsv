2009-01-18T11:44:00.000Z	P4C0		guys one question, is it possible to install swat on ubuntu server?
2009-01-18T11:46:00.000Z	P4C0		i did a sudo apt-get install swat but it didn't start, the line got included in inetd.conf but I don't know how to start it... it seems not to have inetd.conf... since its the only line
