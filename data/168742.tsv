2009-10-08T08:30:00.000Z	Ollonk		I want some information about IO APIC
2009-10-08T08:31:00.000Z	Ollonk		I'm trying to find out if A: My single CPU dell board has it and B: If I can turn it off or fix it to get a faster boot
2009-10-08T08:32:00.000Z	scunizi	Ollonk	there is a way to turn it off.. in the kernel line on the grub boot menu.. at the end I seem to remember adding acpi=no or off
2009-10-08T08:33:00.000Z	scunizi	Ollonk	also in the bios there should be a switch
