2007-07-07T10:28:00.000Z	pike_	wgre0111	best to google for some website thatll build the vmx file for ya. i prefer vmware-server which is free at their website though. or qemu
2007-07-07T10:58:00.000Z	pike_	wgre0111	you need to register at vmware's website. (its free) and they email you a key to use with vmware-server which is vastly better than vmware-player
2007-07-07T11:07:00.000Z	pike_	wgre0111	sometimes there is too much :)
