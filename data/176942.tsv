2006-11-03T17:50:00.000Z	azureal	plugwash	oh, so should i have used the make-kpkg method?
2006-11-03T17:53:00.000Z	azureal	plugwash	they recommend "make menuconfig", "make-kpkg clean" (not sure if i need this), "make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=custom1 kernel_image kernel_headers", and then afterwards install the headers and image .deb files w/ dkpg
