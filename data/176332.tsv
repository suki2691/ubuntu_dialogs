2006-06-30T15:50:00.000Z	nnk		Hey, I'm trying to remove the icons for my ntfs/fat32 partitions off my desktop without making any other changes (like unmounting them).
2006-06-30T15:50:00.000Z	nnk		Anyone able to help?

2006-06-30T15:53:00.000Z	nnk	Lars_G	no good, I get can't delete error, followed by a rec that I unmount them.
