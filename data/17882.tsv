2011-03-14T22:07:00.000Z	skulltip		hi, need some advise. i'm setting an ubuntu 10.10 32bit pc up for my mom, her old pc has bit the dust. she lives alone and has bad vision - uses glasses and resolution as low as 800x600. do i need to give her a complicated password, she only uses it to play games, pay bills, and email.
