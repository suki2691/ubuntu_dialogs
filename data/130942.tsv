I currently have a remote share mounted to my machine from a server on my network using smbfs as the filesystem type in /etc/fstab.  The share mounts fine, but all the files in the share, when accessed from this machine, show up as being labeled something like :x4a, :x4b, and so on and disappear when you click on them.
