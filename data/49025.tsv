2009-10-22T18:38:00.000Z	FireVisor		Hi there, I have recently installed ubuntu. I would like to be able to use a higher resolution.  1024x678 is the max I can do right now, in games and everything.

2009-10-22T18:41:00.000Z	FireVisor	Bob_Dole2	That is definately not the problem, since I know the monitor can handle 1600x1200
