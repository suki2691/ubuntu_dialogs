2009-08-02T16:52:00.000Z	gartral	mizipzor	i see ESD and Pulse in the same list, thats a no-no, also, alsa and oss needs aoss to coexist without dying
2009-08-02T16:53:00.000Z	mizipzor	gartral	should i then, instead, start by removing as much as possible? everything related to sound but alsa and pulseaudio?
2009-08-02T16:53:00.000Z	gartral	mizipzor	i would remove ESD via terminal with sudo aptitude purge esd
2009-08-02T16:53:00.000Z	mizipzor	gartral	im on it
