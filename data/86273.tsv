2008-07-06T09:42:00.000Z	r3volution27		Hi guys, new to ubuntu here, just successfully booted the live cd on a VirtualBox VM running on OS X
2008-07-06T09:43:00.000Z	r3volution27		it was surprisingly easy
2008-07-06T09:44:00.000Z	r3volution27		I only get options for 800X600 and 640X480 resolutions on the live CD, how can I get higher?
