2010-02-21T01:14:00.000Z	Jax		Hi, I asked a few minutes ago about the Lexmark printer driver and how it refuses to actually check to see if it backends.  I've gone into System>Printer, and the status message is "cups-insecure-filter."  Help?
2010-02-21T01:16:00.000Z	Jax		I'd really hate to be pushy or something, but what do I do if my printer says "cups-insecure-filter" as a status?
2010-02-21T01:17:00.000Z	Jax		Never mind about that last one.  Googling it instead.
2010-02-21T01:18:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Jax	see if the following bug discussion helps you out at all https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cups/+bug/436544
