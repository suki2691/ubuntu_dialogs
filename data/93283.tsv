2008-04-26T22:18:00.000Z	Shoops		I just installed Ubuntu 8.04 (not a new user though), and it worked fine until I tried installing the proprietary drivers..... now I get a black screen upon reboot, and no option to login ): Can anyone help me? :D
2008-04-26T22:18:00.000Z	z0g	Shoops	are you able to get to a console? (CTRL-alt-f1)
2008-04-26T22:19:00.000Z	Shoops	z0g	I can try, but I need to know what to do from there, as I'm on the same comp as my linux distro install.. can't have windows and nix up at the same time.
2008-04-26T22:19:00.000Z	Shoops	z0g	any ideas on how to fix then?
