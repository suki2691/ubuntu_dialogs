2010-01-11T01:26:00.000Z	ShereKhan		I have trouble getting X working on a new 9.10 install. After GRUB I see a black/white logo for a short time, and then my monitor throws up an error about being unable to display the display mode. When cycling resolutions with ctrl-alt-+ I do get an image, but it's all garbled up. Vidcard is an Nvidia 7600GS on PCI Express, with a Dell 24" monitor capable of 1600x1200 on the VGA port. Debian is running fine on the same computer, both usi
