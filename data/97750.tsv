I just changed computer, and just plugged in my old hard drive because i want to copy my novell evolution files to my new ubuntu install, but when i try to copy the evolution folder i get the message: "The folder "pop" cannot be handled because you do not have permissions to read it" anyone know how i can solve this problem ?
