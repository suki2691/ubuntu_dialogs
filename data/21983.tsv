2010-12-15T03:42:00.000Z	m4xx	stygian_	i've searched google. the only thing i found someone mentioning it is file-roller which i've installed. can you give me some better keywords to seach for?
2010-12-15T03:43:00.000Z	stygian_	m4xx	unfortunately, no i cannot. i am the type of person who would add it themselves if it were not there. and that means doing all the research as well.. perhaps somebody else will know
