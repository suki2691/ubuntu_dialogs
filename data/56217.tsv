2009-05-31T00:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	koichirose	i've used flash on linux for years on server different distros on both 32 & 64 bit archs - it has always been a "bit" buggy, even now under 64 9.04 i have occasional problem with flash and need to close all firefox windows before it will work again - but Most of the time it work, and i can live with the "bugs"
