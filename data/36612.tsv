2010-03-12T02:28:00.000Z	needles		hey!  Does anyone know where I can find the ubuntu EULA?
2010-03-12T02:29:00.000Z	needles		got it.. so the ubuntu core is GPL and the individual packages are under their own licences?
2010-03-12T02:29:00.000Z	Azelphur	needles	yes, exactly
2010-03-12T02:29:00.000Z	Azelphur	needles	you'll find the majority of packages are GPL too, though.
