2006-05-19T13:36:00.000Z	ironcladlou		where can i get instructions on getting metacity's composite manager running with dapper 6.06b2?
2006-05-19T13:38:00.000Z	ironcladlou		also: has anybody experienced a flickering animated mouse cursor when using the latest nvidia driver?
2006-05-19T13:39:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	ironcladlou	no, but you don't want to see the flickering I get with xgl + gnome-screensavers
2006-05-19T13:40:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	ironcladlou	dunno.. I wasn't having much luck with the latest builds but I got some good tips on #ubuntu-xgl yesterday.. now it's sweet (again..)
