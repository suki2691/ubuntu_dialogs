2008-02-28T23:35:00.000Z	SharkBoy		Hi there - I'm a long term Linux user, returning after a break of a couple of years and I'd like to try Ubuntu - I understand the installation routine is different to what I'm used to (Anaconda). Is there a way to burn a boot CD image, and then continue the install pulling it off the net?
