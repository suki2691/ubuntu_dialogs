2009-10-06T20:33:00.000Z	Matir`		Does anyone know of a way to make OpenSSH require BOTH a password and a pub/priv keypair for login?
2009-10-06T20:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	Matir`	use a pub/priv keypair with passphrase
2009-10-06T20:34:00.000Z	Matir`	erUSUL	that doesn't pass the passphrase on to PAM
2009-10-06T20:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	Matir`	no
