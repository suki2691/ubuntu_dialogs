2009-10-15T19:45:00.000Z	Scooler		 Hey, i have a problem; i am using ubuntu and when my comp was running electricity went out - now when i try to start system it goes to console saying [initramfs], i guess my boot sequence is broken. I tryed a few grub commands i found on internet but everytime i type them - console says "grub: Not found".
2009-10-15T19:45:00.000Z	Scooler		can you help me?
2009-10-15T19:46:00.000Z	Jyxt	Scooler	grub what not found? theres usually an error number?
2009-10-15T19:48:00.000Z	Jyxt	Scooler	and what happens after reboot? does grub give you an errors/warnings? does it drop you into a shell?
