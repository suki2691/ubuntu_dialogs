2008-12-21T22:12:00.000Z	Neaai	Ward1983	I'd guess to be something /etc/init.d/alsa or  /etc/init.d/alsa-utils  but I can't be sure on how to use that start|stop script as it has a CARD parameter too, to what I see.
2008-12-21T22:13:00.000Z	Ward1983	Neaai	ah its just a startup script, i've used those before :) thanx, i can probably find out what parameter i should use in #alsa
2008-12-21T22:13:00.000Z	Neaai	Ward1983	ok you can  try that
