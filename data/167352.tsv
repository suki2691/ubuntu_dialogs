2006-09-18T05:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	kornflak	do you need to filter mail for windows machines? Becose linux does not need antivirus
2006-09-18T05:18:00.000Z	kornflak	erUSUL	mainly an Anti-Virus solution to prevent virus' from spreading through a linux machine and infecting Windows machines
2006-09-18T05:20:00.000Z	kornflak	erUSUL	I know that linux doesn't need an AV solution but I just don't want my Ubuntu machine spreading viruses to Windows machines
