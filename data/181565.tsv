2006-06-10T06:00:00.000Z	Maerksi		hello. I have 3 partitions. Is it safe to try to install ubuntu on my first partition or installing ubuntu is not as safe as installing winxp ?
2006-06-10T06:01:00.000Z	Healot	Maerksi	define "safe"?
2006-06-10T06:01:00.000Z	Healot		you can install ubuntu first and Windows XP later, but it is recommeded to Install XP first
2006-06-10T06:02:00.000Z	Maerksi	Healot	on winxp I can install on the partition I want. I'm afraid installing ubuntu it will try to automaticly do things I didn't ask like cleaning all the partitions, installing bootloaders n' stuff
