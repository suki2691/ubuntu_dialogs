2007-03-29T10:21:00.000Z	Gambit-		anyone know how to perminently turn off powersave mode so that the monitor never turns off?  I've disabled the screensaver, but it still seems to be turning off after about 15 minutes.
2007-03-29T10:22:00.000Z	harpette	Gambit-	yes, the screensaver is not the culprit. but i don't remember where that is. in the kernel config, i believe.
2007-03-29T10:22:00.000Z	Gambit-	harpette	ergh, apci I'm sure, I just don't know how to disable it.
