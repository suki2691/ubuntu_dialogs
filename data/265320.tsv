2004-09-29T05:12:00.000Z	Adonijah-	ryanohorn	it's not installed by default afaik
2004-09-29T05:13:00.000Z	Adonijah-	ryanohorn	when it did install, it installed as /usr/bin/gcc-3.4
2004-09-29T05:17:00.000Z	Adonijah-	ryanohorn	it looks like if you do sudo apt-get install gcc, gcc-3.3.4 gets installed as /usr/bin/gcc
