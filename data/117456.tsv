2007-10-09T16:47:00.000Z	cyberfin		Just a quick question (and a bit obvious maybe) Is it normal that there are so many updates for Gutsy, like everyday? Is it because it's in Beta?
2007-10-09T10:38:00.000Z	cyberfin		Can anyone tell me if it's best to install the stable feisty version and update to gutsy once released or is it safe (enough) to go with gutsy... on a laptop?
2007-10-09T10:39:00.000Z	Hunnur	cyberfin	gutsy seems to work fine on laptops right now (for $laptop that can run feisty already)
