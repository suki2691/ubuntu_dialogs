2008-07-17T03:39:00.000Z	bobertdos	purplestar	not nearly as many as there would be in Windows, plus, you can always clear them
2008-07-17T03:40:00.000Z	purplestar	bobertdos	but I cannot clear them all, because some cookies I need to auto login in to some websites.  Is there a cookie cleaner for Ubuntu Firefox that allows me to tell it not to clear some cookies?
