2006-06-05T15:21:00.000Z	Naynay		Hi all. I can't get sound from 6.06 on this old Panasonic CF-M1ER laptop. Uses NeoMagic driver. No modern linux using ALSA works on it, but FreeBSD does. I doubt anyone cares, but anyway FYI

2006-06-05T15:22:00.000Z	Naynay		I'm going to annoy the ALSA people
2006-06-05T15:23:00.000Z	tanek	Naynay	:P tried compiling a kernel without alsa support but with oss?
