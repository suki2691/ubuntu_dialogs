2009-10-26T10:24:00.000Z	Andorin		When I run ls -l, I get columns... permissions, a username, a username, a multi-digit number, date of last edit of the file, and the file name. Can someone tell me what significance the usernames have and the multi-digit number? I don't see it in the man page.

2009-10-26T10:25:00.000Z	Andorin	vox	Alright, thanks... what about the number?
