2007-01-15T17:57:00.000Z	Sabrex		man this ubuntu installer is giving me such a hard time
2007-01-15T17:58:00.000Z	Sabrex		it says that i cant use XFS for /boot, but i have /boot set to mount /dev/hdb1 which i partitioned as ext3
2007-01-15T06:04:00.000Z	Sabrex		anyone know why the installer is telling me that i cant use XFS for /boot when i have a special ext3 partition for /boot?
2007-01-15T06:05:00.000Z	auTONYmous	Sabrex	were you trying to use a XFS partition at first?
