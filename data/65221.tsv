2009-03-01T04:18:00.000Z	ubuntu_	sprinkmeier_	is it fine if i just used 100 mb for /boot partition
2009-03-01T04:21:00.000Z	sprinkmeier_	ubuntu_	should be fine unless you go on a kernel shopping spree :-) my point is that at less than1c/MB you might as well be generous
2009-03-01T04:22:00.000Z	ubuntu_	sprinkmeier_	i just redid my partitions again and just gave it 300 mb
