2010-04-03T07:44:00.000Z	Ivanlul		how can I check if ubuntu is using my graphics card?
2010-04-03T07:45:00.000Z	jmad980	Ivanlul	for 3d?
2010-04-03T07:47:00.000Z	jmad980	Ivanlul	yeah, if it can display that without being too choppy, it should be setup correctly, other wise you could try playing a game that uses 3d, or perhaps desktop effects
2010-04-03T07:50:00.000Z	jmad980	Ivanlul	well I gotta go eat dinner, so as far as I can tell it's working, but if you need more help i'm sure someone here (thats running ubuntu :p) could help
