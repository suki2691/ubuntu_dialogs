2011-10-21T05:36:00.000Z	StepNjump		Is it best to have a dedicated /boot, /usr, /home partitions?
2011-10-21T05:37:00.000Z	grom358	StepNjump	depends
2011-10-21T05:37:00.000Z	StepNjump	grom358	with the new grub2, I guess a /boot partition is not needed right?
2011-10-21T05:38:00.000Z	grom358	StepNjump	I haven't need a /boot partition in a long long time. IIRC it was more for support for large disks back in the day
