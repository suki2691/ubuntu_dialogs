2006-06-06T16:21:00.000Z	newtuxman		i have installed a ubuntu box in the office, and it has decided it wants a certain IP, that is statically assigned to someone else in the office... how to i get it to stop grabbing that IP? and i thought if the router has that IP statically assigned, then how did this box get it in the first place?
