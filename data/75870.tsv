2009-08-15T15:29:00.000Z	diddy		If I want to make 100% sure I will be able to remove a .deb package again what can I do? Wasn't there some kind of check-install command?
2009-08-15T15:29:00.000Z	kbp	diddy	what do you mean remove .deb package? just delete it
2009-08-15T15:30:00.000Z	diddy	kbp	I want to install a .deb package that is not in the repositories but I don't know the author.
2009-08-15T15:32:00.000Z	kbp	diddy	... my habbit is I keep double click on deb files downloaded from net and not really care about malware... I need to think about it again - I guess...
