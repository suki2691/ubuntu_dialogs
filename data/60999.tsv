2009-12-23T04:28:00.000Z	Bragex9		I am having trouble with ubuntu installation. The partition program has started, but the progress bar has been on 47% for a loooong time. It says: "searching hard drives" How long will this take? I guess it has been on 47% for at least 15 minutes....

2009-12-23T04:30:00.000Z	Bragex9	ActionParsnip	I install from a usb-stick. I have used it on another pc and it worked fine there
