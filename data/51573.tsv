2009-08-01T01:05:00.000Z	ralf_j		Is there a dedicated channel for WLAN problems, or is this the right one to ask?
2009-08-01T01:07:00.000Z	guntbert	ralf_j	as long as it is ubuntu you are in the right place
2009-08-01T01:08:00.000Z	ralf_j	guntbert	it is kubuntu, but since the underlying system is the same I figured I'd start here - is that correct?
