2011-11-08T01:43:00.000Z	mrbean		Hi, I want to install 11.10 in a pendrive, 3.72GB free, is it enough?
2011-11-08T01:43:00.000Z	mrbean		I mean, will I have problems if I try to update it to 12.04?
2011-11-08T01:44:00.000Z	mrbean		no, it's a 4GB pendrive, but the actual space is 3.72GB, you know, the 1000 / 1024 dilemma
2011-11-08T01:45:00.000Z	Liram	mrbean	kinda doubt it reinstalled yesterday afternoon and my current disk space is about 4.3gigs
