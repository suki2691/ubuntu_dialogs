2009-09-03T11:29:00.000Z	nikre		hi, i can not execute a shell script as sudo in rc.local at startup, is there any way i can do that?
2009-09-03T11:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nikre	rc.local is owned by root, so any commands defined in there will run with that priveledge
2009-09-03T11:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nikre	just omit any sudos from the script
