2008-08-08T02:12:00.000Z	gyro54		Please help! I have run the upgrade from 7.10 to 8.04 and the computer is locked with 7 minutes to go? Can I shutdown and restart?
2008-08-08T02:13:00.000Z	gyro54		I am using it to write this but the screen has the upgrade info with the line at 7 minutes to go?
2008-08-08T02:13:00.000Z	gyro54		It has been on 7 minutes for about 3 hours
