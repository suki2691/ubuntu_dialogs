2012-06-18T17:41:00.000Z	betinho	norbert79	i've inserted the line to the /etc/fstab: /dev/sdb1 /media/pendrive /dev/sdb1 /media/pendrive auto rw,noauto,user 0 0 but did not work
2012-06-18T17:42:00.000Z	norbert79	betinho	Fstab lists the mounts you can mount with the mount /dev/sdb1... It will work. The question is more, that why does automount not work? It should work out-of-the-box
