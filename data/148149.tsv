2010-03-09T18:13:00.000Z	malifal		i have managed of disallowing B of creating a new connection to the gatway, but B is still able to create a new connection machine A
2010-03-09T18:15:00.000Z	malifal		i have set in the INPUT and FORWARD to reject if source is B and state of connection is not ESTABLISHED, RELATED.
