2006-04-24T10:17:00.000Z	zF		I have a question
2006-04-24T10:18:00.000Z	zF		Is it possible to raise the volume on Amarok or Ubuntu? My laptop internal volume is maxed and my speakers are maxed but it's barely hearable
2006-04-24T10:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	zF	 install some of the other sound mixer apps. and twiddle with all the controlls :P
