2008-10-25T20:24:00.000Z	LjL	pro-rsoft	which would be?
2008-10-25T20:26:00.000Z	LjL	pro-rsoft	honestly, i'm not keen on looking up what a Windows program does (since i won't ever need it). so if you describe what sort of program you're looking for, then i will do my best to find one that does it
2008-10-25T20:26:00.000Z	pro-rsoft	LjL	its a mac program actually
