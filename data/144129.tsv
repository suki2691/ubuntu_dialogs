2007-03-03T11:31:00.000Z	muzikgoat		so, i'm looking for help on this issue,  when Dapper used to load, I could see my services and modules loading and all that,  since upgrading to Edgy,  that is now gone.   I've been up and down the grub settings and the only thing i can find is quiet boot, but that doesn't change anything that i can see, any suggestions?
2007-03-03T11:32:00.000Z	EADG	muzikgoat	change quit to "verbose"
2007-03-03T11:41:00.000Z	EADG	muzikgoat	change quiet to verbose.
2007-03-03T11:43:00.000Z	muzikgoat	EADG	i'm changing #defoptions=quiet boot   to =verbose,  that should be fine?
