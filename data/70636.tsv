2010-03-02T17:22:00.000Z	swiftarrow		Hi all, I have a problem, and it seems to be rather obscure, since I can't find a solution via Google :O   Here it is:  I'm trying to install FreeCAD, which depends on python-pivy, which depends on libqt4-opengl_4.5.3   The problem is that the latest version in the repos is only 4.5.0, so I can't install python-pivy.  I've got the debs for 4.5.3 from the debian repos, but when I install them, synaptic says half my other programs are broken and wants

2010-03-02T17:25:00.000Z	swiftarrow	Dr_Willis	acicula, When I installed using sudo dpkg -i *, it upgraded the packages, but after that if I try to run synaptic or apt-get it says that a number of my programs (virtualbox, inkscape, scribus, etc) have broken dependancies, so It want's to remove those programs.  I've downgraded the packages thinking that there must be a better way.
