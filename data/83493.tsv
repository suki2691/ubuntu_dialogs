2008-11-01T21:36:00.000Z	DaveCave		so i installed 8.10 and i told it to activate the 177 ver nvidia drivers that 8.10 now comes with, unlike 8.04, and once the drivers install and i hafta restart the computer it loads to TTy1 and wont let me bootup my GUI cause says no video found or some crap, i cant even gedit my xorg.conf cause says no display device, ive loaded and reinstalled 8.10 5 times, cause i cant get a gui back
2008-11-01T21:36:00.000Z	DaveCave		each time i try something different with the drivers and still no good
2008-11-01T21:36:00.000Z	DaveCave		so im at a clean install again, waiting for instructions
