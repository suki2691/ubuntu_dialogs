2004-10-11T05:58:00.000Z	housetier	schalke	I got java working on debian without problems, I installed a java vm and created the symlinks as described and lo and behold it worked :)
2004-10-11T06:02:00.000Z	schalke	housetier	Java alone works on my system, too. My problem seems to be the RealPlayer10. It is not listed in the installed plugins. Joining a site, where RealPlayer is necessary I get a white field and together with Java the browser crashes.
2004-10-11T06:07:00.000Z	housetier	schalke	its absolutely possible that the plugin is not of the best quality, the browser might have bugs too..
2004-10-11T06:12:00.000Z	schalke	housetier	ok. Perhaps I`ll try the 0.93-version. This worked well. Nevertheless the rest of this preview runs perfect. Thx
