2012-11-18T10:35:00.000Z	godlyhell_		I'm having a serious issue.
2012-11-18T10:37:00.000Z	godlyhell_		Updated from 11.10 to 12.04 and towards the end it went goofy forcing me to hardboot.
2012-11-18T10:39:00.000Z	godlyhell_		Now everything is all screwy. I'm sure the update didnt fully install but I cant figure out how to reinstall it.
