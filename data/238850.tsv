2007-02-24T06:57:00.000Z	transgress	LordUltimaDavid	why would you come in here just to ask thta?
2007-02-24T06:57:00.000Z	transgress	LordUltimaDavid	looks like it.  maybe it got hacked again.
2007-02-24T06:59:00.000Z	transgress	LordUltimaDavid	well there are a lot more gui's for crap in opensuse.  i mean guis to set up everything.  but they are all slow, and package management is the slowest i have ever experienced in any distro in opensuse.  not to badmouth it.  i'm using it on this box.  for a little bit longer.  but you have to hack around more stuff in opensuse, media playback is a bit more annoying, but 64bit setup is nicer than ubuntu, but not as fast.
