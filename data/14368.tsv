2011-10-10T08:29:00.000Z	zelozelos	PhaoraohOner	the best way to do what u're wanting is to completely format the drive, set up the 1st partition for 7, leave the rest unallocated, then install 7, then ubuntu, leaving room for the neutral part, and formatting it after install, keep in mind, windows cannot read any ext formatting, it must be ntfs

2011-10-10T08:31:00.000Z	zelozelos	PhaoraohOner	but i do suggest it if you have the sys disk
