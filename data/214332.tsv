2005-10-11T10:23:00.000Z	judah		hi. so after breezy updates last night my update-notifier has the little light bulb stuck stating it has a post update alert.. except there is no alert listed and the close and run action buttons don't work. just the big X ... killing.. restarting.. rebooting.. logging out and back in.. nothing clears it.
2005-10-11T10:24:00.000Z	avalost	judah	reboot probably just anew kernel messege
2005-10-11T10:24:00.000Z	judah	avalost	yep.
2005-10-11T10:26:00.000Z	judah	avalost	so any other ideas?
