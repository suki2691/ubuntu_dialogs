2009-11-20T20:01:00.000Z	wesley_		i mean the server  well i know you can use tsclient but what i don't get is  in all manuals of youtube they talk about  192.168.X.X ip but that is a intern lan ip
2009-11-20T20:03:00.000Z	wesley_		yes i  did read somthing about that so my friends computer has  sudo apt-get install done
