2006-10-26T07:23:00.000Z	jvai		will edgy be a smooth upgrade from dapper? not like from hoary to breezy?
2006-10-26T07:24:00.000Z	Kawaii-Panda	jvai	i doubt that. i had to delete my old dapper partition just to install edgy beta. T_T
2006-10-26T07:27:00.000Z	Kawaii-Panda	jvai	yeah - thats why i installed it. it looks so cool, and it hadnt broken yet for me.
