2008-10-10T03:17:00.000Z	f|uke		can anyone tell me how to keep a vnc4server session active? I'm hoping to launch azureus so that it does not terminate when I quit vnc
2008-10-10T03:19:00.000Z	Slart	f|uke	or just use the remote desktop functionality built in
2008-10-10T03:20:00.000Z	Slart	f|uke	oh... I think x11vnc requires a running session to work
2008-10-10T03:20:00.000Z	Slart	f|uke	there might be some kind of keep alive setting in vnc that I don't know about
