2012-06-08T07:23:00.000Z	BarkingFish		so - without the "you don't know how to configure it" stuff, and the like - can anyone simply answer my question please? How do I block a package from downloading during updates?
2012-06-08T07:23:00.000Z	BarkingFish		I'm not angry or anything, simply tired - it's 4.25am, and I want to resolve this if possible, before I go to bed :)
2012-06-08T07:25:00.000Z	jgalt	BarkingFish	: I know your pain, I've been there.  let me do some looking and see if I might find some help.  it's only 8:25pm here
2012-06-08T07:27:00.000Z	BarkingFish	jgalt	thank you. I've been on linux long enough to know when regardless of configuring something, it's about as useful as a chocolate sunhat :)
