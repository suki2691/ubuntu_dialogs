2005-02-26T06:05:00.000Z	anti_		with the latest hoary kernels (linux-image-2.6.11-1-686_2.6.11-0.2_i386.deb and linux-image-2.6.10-3-686_2.6.10-17_i386.deb) my system logs lots of "scheduling while atomic: gam_server/0xffffffff/9152" messages and stops working after a short while (5-10 mins).
2005-02-26T06:06:00.000Z	anti_		should I file a bug with linux-image? or gamin/gam_server? what information will be needed?
