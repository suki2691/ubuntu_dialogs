2006-05-11T15:09:00.000Z	speedie		I want to run a remote XServer on my Mac, to connect to my ubuntu box. Anyone know where I could find some info on doing that?
2006-05-11T15:10:00.000Z	speedie		I tried SSHing into my linux box, from X11 on the Mac, setting my DISPLAY env. and running an application, but it says can't open display
