2004-11-05T07:40:00.000Z	ATJ		Are those "main", "restricted" and "universe" components same as stable, unstable and testing under Debian?
2004-11-05T07:41:00.000Z	darkersatanic	ATJ	No, they're more like "main", "non-free" and "contrib"
2004-11-05T07:42:00.000Z	ATJ	darkersatanic	But not exactly same as under Debian? So.. Ubundu maintains its own packages?
