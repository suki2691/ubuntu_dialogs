2006-01-08T06:26:00.000Z	kjs-		I'm trying to install ubuntu on an old pentium 400 I have, I installed a cdrom (that works in windows on it) but it doesn't detect it at boot...Is there a way to get it to detected, or another way to install ubuntu?
2006-01-08T06:27:00.000Z	skon	kjs-	do you have  a boot options menu, a bios setup?
2006-01-08T06:28:00.000Z	kjs-	skon	yes..I've heard some comp's that old won't boot off a cdrom though...true?
2006-01-08T06:28:00.000Z	skon	kjs-	it's probably true...you'll need to make a bootable floppy that will load your CD-ROM drive
