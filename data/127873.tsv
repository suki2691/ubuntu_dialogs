2007-10-19T06:21:00.000Z	GamingX		After upgrading to Gutsy, should I install all the packages that I have installed again?
2007-10-19T06:23:00.000Z	seamus7	GamingX	did you do a fresh install of gutsy?
2007-10-19T06:24:00.000Z	GamingX	seamus7	no I already have Feisty, so I plan to upgrade to Gutsy...
2007-10-19T06:24:00.000Z	seamus7	GamingX	then I don't understand your question... all of your apps will still be there after you upgrade to Gutsy
