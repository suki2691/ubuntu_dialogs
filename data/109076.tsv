2008-01-09T07:56:00.000Z	radiounix		Has anyone had firsthand experience installing Ubuntu's "restricted" packaging of the legacy Nvidia (old 7100 tree) drivers on a Gutsy server/base install? I cannot use nvidia-xconfig as this driver tree doesn't have it. While I get the Nvidia splashscreen, glxinfo reports no 3D accel. The driver uneventfully modprobed. If I need to RTFM or STFW, a link or hint would be helpful.
