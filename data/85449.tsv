2011-04-12T19:44:00.000Z	drozdak		anyone can help me with this task: i want to delete all files that ends ".db" (some windows leftovers in various directiories) the "rm *.db" doesn't seem to do the trick, and i'm afraid of using "rm -I -r *.db" not really sure about results
2011-04-12T19:45:00.000Z	Pici	drozdak	find /path/ -name "*.db" -delete    (test with -echo rather than -delete)
