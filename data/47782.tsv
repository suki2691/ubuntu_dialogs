2010-02-05T16:31:00.000Z	raversfantasy		Since ive installed some updates il cant get into the login screen of ubuntu 9.04
2010-02-05T16:33:00.000Z	raversfantasy		There's just a pop-up Window with the german errormessage : "Das Begrüßungsprogramm scheint gerade abzustürzen..." what basicly on english means "The Welcomeappication seems to crash..."
2010-02-05T16:34:00.000Z	theadmin	raversfantasy	It seems GDM is broken.
