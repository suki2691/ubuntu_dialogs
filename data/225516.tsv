2005-08-04T13:38:00.000Z	luke2	elsha	The major problem with us Americans is that it *seems* like we don't care what goes on in the world. The fact is, our media is so polluted with garbage and lies (even controlled by the government despite "freedom of press!". So we just don't watch the news. Unless it's BBC.
