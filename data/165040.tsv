2007-04-04T16:22:00.000Z	DarthDave		Ubuntu works
2007-04-04T16:22:00.000Z	DarthDave		but I already bought Windows
2007-04-04T16:22:00.000Z	DarthDave		so what advantage is there to installing linux, when I already have windows?
2007-04-04T16:23:00.000Z	DualCortex	DarthDave	try googling. You won't get much help here to straighten your opinions, etc.
