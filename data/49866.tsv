2009-08-22T18:36:00.000Z	martingz		hello, i have a problem with my system. Sometimes the filesystem stops working (ext4 on a 2.6.31 kernel), and the kernel says some thing like it found an inode between two cylinders (maybe i'm wrong, don't get logged on syslog). Do any of you heard something about a bug like this, or is my hard drive dead?
