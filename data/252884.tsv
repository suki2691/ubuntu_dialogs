2007-04-16T10:11:00.000Z	Amrog		I just migrated from windows. It was there that when I clicked the mouse wheel on a web page in firefox, It created a reference point, then by moving my mouse away from this point, I could scroll around a web page. This does not happen in ubuntu. Is there someway to make this happen?
