2006-07-21T12:26:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	_fluffee	sure, it works here.
2006-07-21T12:28:00.000Z	_fluffee	fyrestrtr	- Thanks.  Hoping to get clue &c, please feel free to offer insight.
2006-07-21T12:29:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	_fluffee	to be honest, b/g support is very dependent on the drivers you use. Luckily, I use ipw2200 drivers, which support g for my laptop.
