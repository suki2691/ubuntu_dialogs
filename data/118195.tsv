2008-03-11T20:03:00.000Z	lunaphyte_		i wanted to upgrade from 6.1 to 7.0.4, so i went looking for some details, which turned out to be "run do-release-upgrade".  now i have a system that "cannot find any devices listed in mdadm.conf"...
2008-03-11T20:04:00.000Z	lunaphyte_		so now i have to go find a 7.0.4 cd, boot off of that, and do surgery.  which i'm fine doing, but would rather have just done it in the first place.
2008-03-11T20:05:00.000Z	lunaphyte_		where can i download 7.0.4.  do they purposefully make it difficult to find, or am i retarded?
