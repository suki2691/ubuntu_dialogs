2009-04-22T03:02:00.000Z	PROject-Emerald		Can someone help me out? I just changed my user password (to log in) but it said it had to be 6 characters or more, but I want to change it back to what it was (4 chars)
2009-04-22T03:02:00.000Z	PROject-Emerald		Any way to do this?
2009-04-22T03:03:00.000Z	Saiki	PROject-Emerald	that's an ubuntu limit now, there isn't a way to change that
2009-04-22T03:05:00.000Z	Saiki	PROject-Emerald	use a leeted name, or a highschool id number?
