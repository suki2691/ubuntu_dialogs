2006-10-29T17:08:00.000Z	lupine_85	terrox	/bin/sh points to dash now
2006-10-29T17:08:00.000Z	lupine_85		temporarily switch it to bash and the script should work - or just run "bash <script>" - either will work
2006-10-29T17:10:00.000Z	terrox	lupine_85	yeah that nearly worked, I think the script is still not a complete file though,
