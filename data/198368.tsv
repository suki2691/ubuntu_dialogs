2007-10-05T08:21:00.000Z	sexcopter		i'm downloading a whole bunch of updates this morning and noticing that speeds are slow, presumably the repositories are under a big load. just wondering if people have considered a kind of bittorrent system to get updates, which would then fall back to the main server if it failed...?
2007-10-05T08:22:00.000Z	sexcopter		i'm just thinking that battlenet does something like that, i think
2007-10-05T08:23:00.000Z	sexcopter		hmmm, ok. was just a thought!
