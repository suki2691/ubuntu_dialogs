2010-04-13T21:56:00.000Z	mp33pm		I just did software updates and whenever I login now I have no mouse cursor, I can see everything and use everything including my mouse and keyboard but just don't get a cursor. I've managed to "blindly" install XCHAT and connect here... Anyone have any idea how I can fix this?
