2010-02-27T06:31:00.000Z	jnarowski		Hey all
2010-02-27T06:31:00.000Z	jnarowski		I am about to setup a ROR web server and I am wondering what is the best Ubuntu distro for that
2010-02-27T06:33:00.000Z	jnarowski		does anybody have any suggestions? I am not really clear on the differences
2010-02-27T06:34:00.000Z	Dunkirk	jnarowski	I saw that there was a whole Ubuntu sub-variant just for RoR applications. I don't remember the name, tho.
