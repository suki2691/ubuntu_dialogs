2010-05-09T00:10:00.000Z	emghazal		I can't find a way to remove the evolution envelope icon (http://imagebin.org/96127). I uninstalled Evolution altogether. I can't remove the indicator applet because I want the sound, bluetooth, and power icons. And I tried looking at gconf-editor but found nothing. Any ideas?

2010-05-09T00:16:00.000Z	emghazal	MightyTweek	So there is no way to remove it? It's bad enough indicator-applet has more spacing than Notification Area and looks inconsistent. Now I'll also have to live with a useless icon there? :(
