2009-07-24T03:44:00.000Z	ikonia	SomePriest	no massive difference unless there is over 4gb of ram, things like flash are still beta in 64bit nativly
2009-07-24T03:45:00.000Z	SomePriest	ikonia	1.5GB RAM.  Is there much performance gain for JUST a desktop user between 32 bit and 64?
2009-07-24T03:46:00.000Z	ikonia	SomePriest	either would be fine
