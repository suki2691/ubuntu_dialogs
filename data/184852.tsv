2008-05-12T01:30:00.000Z	Znuff		Hi. Does ubuntu require a root password when booting into single mode? (recovery, I did something bad)
2008-05-12T01:31:00.000Z	astro76	Znuff	no
2008-05-12T01:32:00.000Z	Znuff	astro76	you sure? I see there's # What to do in single-user mode. - ~~:S:wait:/sbin/sulogin in /etc/inittab
2008-05-12T01:33:00.000Z	astro76	Znuff	right, there's # because you are root, without a password
