2011-07-02T22:55:00.000Z	Nisstyre	acicula	there's this thing called a kernel module
2011-07-02T22:56:00.000Z	acicula		im aware of linux internals, its just not a good idea
2011-07-02T22:57:00.000Z	Nisstyre	acicula	people do it every day. Compiling kernel modules and then loading them is not a big deal, or a problem, or even close to a bad thing to do.
