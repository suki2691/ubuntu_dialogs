2009-07-04T19:04:00.000Z	Halitech	odonata	server doesn't have a gui and a kernel optimized for servers, desktop has a gui and apps you would use graphically
2009-07-04T19:04:00.000Z	Halitech	odonata	yes it is
2009-07-04T19:07:00.000Z	Halitech	odonata	not necessarily high load but able to fork things out
