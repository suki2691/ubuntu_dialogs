2010-01-24T12:36:00.000Z	h0rnman|recompil		does anyone have an idea as to why a .deb package generated by checkinstall would have problems overwriting an Icon (.png) file?
2010-01-24T12:37:00.000Z	h0rnman|recompil		shouldn't be...I've tried running the whole process as root and get the same issues
2010-01-24T12:38:00.000Z	Myrtti	h0rnman|recompil	because that's what the software developer of the app you've packaged wanted to? perhaps it has the icon in it...
2010-01-24T12:42:00.000Z	h0rnman|recompil	Myrtti	 I don't think so, but you have given me an idea...
