2007-05-10T11:43:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	dhaval	i'm not sure, but you can build it from source. i'm running it.
2007-05-10T11:44:00.000Z	dhaval	FakeOutdoorsman	that i do not want to do. I won't be able to upgrade using apt then (or will I?)
2007-05-10T11:46:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	dhaval	apt may want to "upgrade" your custom install by replacing it once it appears in the repository if you use checkinstall and give it the same name as it will appear in the repository...i think.
