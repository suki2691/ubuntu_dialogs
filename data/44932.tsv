2011-12-10T09:16:00.000Z	ubuntu_n00b	almoxarife	thanks, i figured that out
2011-12-10T09:17:00.000Z	almoxarife	ubuntu_n00b	why are you changing grub? btw, it is read only unless you have admin permission, and I am not sure you are ready for that
2011-12-10T09:20:00.000Z	almoxarife	ubuntu_n00b	do you know why it defaults to memtest?
