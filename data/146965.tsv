2007-10-29T08:35:00.000Z	Samus_Aran		can someone tell me what Ubuntu Gutsy is ?
2007-10-29T08:35:00.000Z	Samus_Aran		I assume it's the next version, but it isn't listed on the site
2007-10-29T08:35:00.000Z	timewriter	Samus_Aran	, Ubuntu Gutsy is the latest Ubuntu release
2007-10-29T08:37:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	timewriter	I was surprised that Ubuntu stopped using /etc/debian_version, but did not add a /etc/ubuntu_version
