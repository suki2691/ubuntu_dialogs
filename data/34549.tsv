2011-01-25T22:02:00.000Z	UltraParadigm	Taos	more specifically, do you wish to overwrite files with the same name, or keep the latest versions?
2011-01-25T22:07:00.000Z	UltraParadigm	Taos	I think what you are looking for is rsync
2011-01-25T22:09:00.000Z	UltraParadigm	Taos	There is also a program called unison which helps maintain the sync between two directories, like for backup purposes, however it only works to maintain because it needs to monitor the directories.  Everything has to be "untangled" first.
