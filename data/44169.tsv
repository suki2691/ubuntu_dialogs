2009-10-31T17:09:00.000Z	Balug	iceroot	Im having a problem with Wubi Rev 160 [or actually all.] Im running windows 7, and i wanna use Wubi next to that. When Wubi wants me to reboot. i got no errors. but when i get into my bootloader and i select ubuntu i get: "Try hd(0,0): NTFS5: No wubildr" and stops working. Does someone know how i can solve this?
