2007-05-26T08:01:00.000Z	Pelo	chanwoman	why don'T you just run your bittorrent aps in the host os instead of the client ?
2007-05-26T08:04:00.000Z	Pelo	chanwoman	you'll probably need to forward your port to your host os first , ubuntu does not close ports on outgoing connections so there shouldn't be an issue I beleive
