2008-12-03T07:08:00.000Z	deadoralive	exodus_ms	so you're telling me that QT has dev++? that's nice, i should give a try.
2008-12-03T07:12:00.000Z	deadoralive	exodus_ms	this is the IDE? :o
2008-12-03T07:25:00.000Z	deadoralive	exodus_ms	this dev c++ is the ide right? no update since 2001, do you think its a good idea to use it or eclipse is a better choice?
