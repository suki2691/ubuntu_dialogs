2007-05-01T10:54:00.000Z	Kogs		Does the fact that I installed the Alternate Feisty ISO have anything to do with the fact that I can't install anything through synaptic?

2007-05-01T10:57:00.000Z	Kogs	stefg	oh I see what happened, i installed it over the network and now it's trying to find the updates on the computer I installed it on instead of the Ubuntu repositories
