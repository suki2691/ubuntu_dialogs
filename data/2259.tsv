2012-06-25T23:53:00.000Z	travisneids		I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 Server.  I have a client using a Windows File Share where they save Access Database files.  What would be the best approach to connect to the file share and run queries on the database?  VPN to file share, grab database dump?  Ugg.  Wish they had a web server.
