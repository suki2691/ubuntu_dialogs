2011-09-23T04:17:00.000Z	MTPrower		I have a folder within Windows called "Casper" and an application file of unetbootin. Can I delete these?
2011-09-23T04:17:00.000Z	Jeruvy	MTPrower	have you set up usb booting? (for windows)
2011-09-23T04:18:00.000Z	MTPrower	Jeruvy	I already created a live USB
2011-09-23T04:18:00.000Z	Jeruvy	MTPrower	you should leave it in place then.
