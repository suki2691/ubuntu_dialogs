2011-03-29T12:17:00.000Z	Elephantman		hi :) the internal mic of my Dell Latitude E6510 doesn't work. Seems related to this issue http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1504774 . But the solution (adding options snd-hda-intel model=dell-s14 at the end of /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf) doesn't work for me. At a guess, it's not the right model written in there, how could I find out what to put in that model value ?
