2009-06-11T07:20:00.000Z	TimReichhart		I am looking for somebody that could help me to see if my dial up server is working
2009-06-11T07:20:00.000Z	gartral	TimReichhart	dialup? are you making an ISP?
2009-06-11T07:23:00.000Z	gartral	TimReichhart	is your home connection dial up, or a "High speed"?
2009-06-11T07:24:00.000Z	gartral	TimReichhart	ok, just doing a sanity check... but I'm afraid actuial modems are a dying breed, noneof my systems have one
