2008-06-16T18:46:00.000Z	enquest		I'm a webdeveloper. I recently went to 1900x1200 screen: is there a way to devide my screen in two parts with a shortcut or something. I want my commandline VIM to be like 700px wide and 100% high and the rest for my browser. I'm realy getting tired of adjustting the windows to fit
