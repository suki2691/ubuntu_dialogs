2009-03-23T16:03:00.000Z	bonez46		I am d/ling ultimate ubuntu.. using torrent.. from estimates.. it looks like it will be late tomorrow before it's finished.. here's my question. what's the advantage to using torrent to d/l a large .iso, over just straight downloading, without the torrent?

2009-03-23T16:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bonez46	ultimate ubuntu is not an official release so is not supported here
2009-03-23T16:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bonez46	torrent clients can be configured to use less bandwidth using settings or bandwidth scheduler
