2007-12-21T14:12:00.000Z	Thornsberr1	bazhang	I installed frostwire and it's running and working fine without a problem.  But whenever I go to the applications and to click on the program instead of the frostwire icon next to the name it just has a blank window.
2007-12-21T14:12:00.000Z	Thornsberr1	bazhang	is there any way that I could change that little icon to show the frostwire icon?
