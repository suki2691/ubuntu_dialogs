2007-08-16T16:35:00.000Z	TheimonCoffeeAfk	dixon	man hdparm
2007-08-16T16:37:00.000Z	dixon	TheimonCoffeeAfk	it's not working in feisty :( cause the developers thought it's better to show all devices as sata. Now everytime I run hdparm I got an error  - HDIO_GETGEO failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device. On ubuntuforums there're a lot unanswered threads :(
