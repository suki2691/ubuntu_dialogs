2012-02-20T01:27:00.000Z	crazydip	OerHeks	I own the second ppa that I want to copy too, I do not own the first ppa that has the package I wish to copy
2012-02-20T01:28:00.000Z	OerHeks	crazydip	you can copy any package to your 'own', but you had an error, which i would not neglect.
2012-02-20T01:31:00.000Z	crazydip	OerHeks	what do you mean? error makes no sense to me, because that package no longer exists in my ppa, so why is there a binary conflict? I'm trying to  copy using the "copy existing binaries" option
