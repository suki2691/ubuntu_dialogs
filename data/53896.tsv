2009-07-29T21:37:00.000Z	surgy		so i just logged back into ubuntu after about a while and noticed that we are now at 9.04? WOOT! anyways, my question is, is it really worth it to upgrade from 8.10 to 9.04? and what am i going to see thyats better?
2009-07-29T21:38:00.000Z	igneousquill	surgy	That all depends on what you want.  I don't upgrade my 8.10 desktop at home because my family is used to it.  I upgraded immediately to 9.04 on my laptop and I like it.  Works well either way.
