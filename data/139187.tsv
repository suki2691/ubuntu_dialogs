2007-06-02T12:37:00.000Z	blue|palm		Hi there, can anybody reccomend a good linux distro for C/C++ development of Linux applications? Ive heard that gentoo is supposedly good for that...
2007-06-02T12:37:00.000Z	blue|palm		lol i know what channel i am in... Im using ubuntu right now
2007-06-02T12:38:00.000Z	blue|palm		The problem is that ubuntu doesnt always have the latest stuff in the repos...
2007-06-02T12:38:00.000Z	idefixx	blue|palm	imo they are all the same for that.. gentoo however has the best build support since all the stuff u emerge is beeing build.
