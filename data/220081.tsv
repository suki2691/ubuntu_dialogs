2007-04-01T07:45:00.000Z	OtakuMark		Is there a 64bit alternate install CD?
2007-04-01T07:45:00.000Z	OtakuMark		also, if I install as 32bit, can I upgrade to 64bit once I get a stable install -_- I'm demoralized
2007-04-01T07:45:00.000Z	Flannel	OtakuMark	no.  64bit and 32bit aren't "upgrades" of each other.
2007-04-01T07:54:00.000Z	Flannel	OtakuMark	no.  It's a GUI command line thing.
