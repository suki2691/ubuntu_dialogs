2012-11-22T23:22:00.000Z	zoneout83	k1l	I have wusb100 using rt2800 the driver I downloaded is rt2870 and no I am not sure but it worked in 8.04 LTS
2012-11-22T23:23:00.000Z	k1l	zoneout83	can you paste the line showing the device in "lsusb"?
2012-11-22T23:28:00.000Z	k1l	zoneout83	it should work with the rt2870 without ndiswrapper. maybe there is a need to block rt2800usb
