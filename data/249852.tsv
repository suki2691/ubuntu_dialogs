2008-01-08T09:59:00.000Z	Lurner		Hey.. I'm 3/4 of the way to getting a samba share to work. I've got both machines to see each other in the Network Neighbourhood/Places/Network area, and the Linux machine can access the XP machine but the XP machine is forced to do a log in to the Linux machine, so obviously I have to make an account on the linux machine for the XP machine. I have already said which folder I want to share, now how to I create an account for this Samba share
