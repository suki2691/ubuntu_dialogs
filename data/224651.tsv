2005-09-06T14:18:00.000Z	vbgunz		can someone please help me enable logging in the irc chat? I've gone to settings > Preferences  > Logging & have enabled logging but I cannot find the file... I am searching like nuts and can't find it, I've tried to save it to the desktop and I've given it a unique name but am having problems :(
2005-09-06T14:19:00.000Z	darkheart	vbgunz	What program?
2005-09-06T14:19:00.000Z	darkheart	vbgunz	It's probably somewhere in ~/.xchat
2005-09-06T14:20:00.000Z	darkheart	vbgunz	correct.
