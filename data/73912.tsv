2010-09-25T08:03:00.000Z	Chiggins		Hey, how would I run a program through the terminal, and keep it running, but be able to still go back to the terminal
2010-09-25T08:04:00.000Z	icarus-c	Chiggins	you mean even after you close the terminal?
2010-09-25T08:05:00.000Z	Chiggins	icarus-c	- like, if i type in 'gedit', Gedit starts, but then i can continue to type commands and other programs into the same terminal
2010-09-25T08:06:00.000Z	icarus-c	Chiggins	after you run gedit,  click back to the terminal,  press "ctrl-z", then enter command "bg".  now gedit has been backgrounded, you could run another program
