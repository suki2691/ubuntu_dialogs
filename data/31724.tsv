2011-01-20T11:00:00.000Z	agentgasmask		Hi. During a dist upgrade from 8.04 to 10.04, I get: "/var/cache/apt/archives/PACKAGE" "Subproces installed pre-removal script returned error exit status 2". I get this error on 10+ packages. It is still telling me about them (ie. I'm not finished the upgrade). Two questions: One, Should I be writing the package names down for later trouble shooting? Two, Is this a sign of a faild upgrade?
2011-01-20T11:02:00.000Z	bazhang	agentgasmask	does the installation stop? in the version upgrade?
2011-01-20T11:03:00.000Z	agentgasmask	bazhang	The install is only waiting for me to click "continue" after I have read the message about the package. So far pressing continue has only lead to more messages.
2011-01-20T11:07:00.000Z	agentgasmask	bazhang	Any other info?
