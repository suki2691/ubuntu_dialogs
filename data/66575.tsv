2009-03-25T05:24:00.000Z	ak-49		Hi I was wondering if anyone might have any idea why my second monitor hooked up to my laptops VGA tends to go blank whenever I load various applications. (example Totem Movie Player) just the external display goes black for a second or two and then returns to a normal display.

2009-03-25T05:26:00.000Z	g4lt-lappy		especially for external VGA
2009-03-25T05:26:00.000Z	ak-49	g4lt-lappy	thats strange.
