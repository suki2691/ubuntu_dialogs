2012-09-02T03:17:00.000Z	Black_Daemon		I was wondering if someone could tell me how to see USB drives in a terminal window
2012-09-02T03:17:00.000Z	histo	Black_Daemon	is it mounted and visible in the gui?  If so you should find it's contents in /media/some-long-string
2012-09-02T03:18:00.000Z	histo	Black_Daemon	if not you have to mount it first
