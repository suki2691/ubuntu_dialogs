2009-05-04T18:19:00.000Z	shortcircuit		I started the upgrade process from 8.10 to 9.04 before I went to sleep last night.  Wake up, and my Bluetooth keyboard/mouse combo is refusing to pair, so I can't acknowledge a question dialog spawned as part of the upgrade.  Plug in a USB keyboard and mouse, and X11 won't take input from those, either.  If I kill applets and such from a console VT, dialogs pop up on the X screen asking if I want to restart them, so I know X isn't *completely* locked
