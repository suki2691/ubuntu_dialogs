2011-04-19T19:59:00.000Z	doah_it_broke		I have an issue w/single boot laptop...I have had ubuntu 10.10 running for 3+ mos..last week on a planned reboot from a patch, I can't get os to load.  I have droped to live CD and am able to mount the HD, but i see no issues... remove disk..press shift and see the machine stops at 'loading grub'...any pointers on where to look?
2011-04-19T20:00:00.000Z	doah_it_broke		I would rather not format and restart
2011-04-19T20:02:00.000Z	doah_it_broke		how do i do that?   I don't know the name of it..where would it be?
