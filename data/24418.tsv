2010-10-12T16:59:00.000Z	qwd		Hi, my friend has a problem with Firefox in Ubuntu 10.04. It appears like this http://i.imgur.com/4fdeP.png and is unusable. She tried "aptitude reinstall firefox" and that didn't solve the problem, neither did rebooting.

2010-10-12T17:01:00.000Z	canci__	qwd	This might break Firefox
2010-10-12T17:01:00.000Z	canci__	qwd	Especially beta extensions and unsupported ones
