2009-04-23T22:50:00.000Z	prometheus765		hi, i installed ubuntu 9.04 rc couple days ago, do i need do something now, when final 9.04 jaunty is released?
2009-04-23T22:50:00.000Z	ectospasm	prometheus765	aptitude update && aptitude -y dist-upgrade
2009-04-23T22:52:00.000Z	prometheus765	ectospasm	i executed this, nothing was downloaded, looks like my system is up to date
2009-04-23T22:54:00.000Z	prometheus765	ectospasm	i was wondering if everything is ok with my jaunty because in rc there was no tray notification about updated packages, even after executing sudo apt-get update there was something to update
