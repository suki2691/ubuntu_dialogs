2010-05-19T22:45:00.000Z	hmw	aeon-ltd	i have a somewhat similar bug; i need to kill gnome-panel after boot. Some elements are drawn as white boxes and are disabled until i kill the panel... sound familiar?
2010-05-19T23:03:00.000Z	hmw	aeon-ltd	that is so cheap. I was thinking to do so on my pc, too... :((
2010-05-19T23:03:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	hmw	you have the same problem?
2010-05-19T23:04:00.000Z	hmw	aeon-ltd	not exactly. I get some applets drawn in total white and dysfunctional on boot, until killall gnome-panel. Seems random.
