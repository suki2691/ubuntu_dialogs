2011-05-13T07:55:00.000Z	ohsix	matthewgreyling	theres a bunch of pages on the ubuntu wiki, especially the kernel section
2011-05-13T07:55:00.000Z	matthewgreyling	ohsix	okay, thanks :)
2011-05-13T07:56:00.000Z	ohsix	matthewgreyling	it's tough though :] try and search for a bug already filed with _whatever_ information you can glean before spending too much time investigating
