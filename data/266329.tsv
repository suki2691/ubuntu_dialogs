2010-10-03T14:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PunkAzz	 linux vbinaries dont have .exe extensions
2010-10-03T14:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PunkAzz	 if it was 'foo.sh' then yes you use the full name
2010-10-03T14:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PunkAzz	 extensions are a windosw sort of thing.. the file name foo.whatever is the full file name.  theres noormally not any special exceptions  like the .exe  and .com exceptions dos/windows uses
