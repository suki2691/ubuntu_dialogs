2007-09-10T15:14:00.000Z	JebJoya		Hi all, having a bit of an issue rearranging my partitions on my mum's machine - originally had just 5Gb Ubuntu and 30Gb Windows, and now she needs more on Ubuntu - gparted is not being terribly useful on a normal boot, any suggestions on what I need to do to move stuff around?

2007-09-10T15:18:00.000Z	JebJoya	penguincentral	yeah, i've had issues with it before, but I'm sure I was able to change it eventually on my own machine, I just can't remember how.  Anyway, nikolam has told me to use partition magic or something on windows, so i'll do that
