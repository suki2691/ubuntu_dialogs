2005-01-27T16:02:00.000Z	wastrel		debian is jolly good.  i haven't tried the sarge installer but it's supposed to be much better.
2005-01-27T16:03:00.000Z	wastrel		yeah i'm thinking of replacing gentoo with ubuntu on my desktop system
2005-01-27T16:04:00.000Z	lavigj	wastrel	I am using instead of gentoo on my laptop since this thing is not a compiling power house.
