2005-06-05T12:27:00.000Z	stimpie		how can I use a splash screen during startup with ubuntu?
2005-06-05T12:28:00.000Z	stimpie		ok but is it supported in the standard kernel or do I need to compile my own kernel?
2005-06-05T12:29:00.000Z	stimpie		I used bootsplash with gentoo which wasnt too hard. But I switched to ubuntu because I don't wanna do all that stuff by hand
