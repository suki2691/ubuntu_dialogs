2011-03-11T23:56:00.000Z	mimor		Why is the Nagios from repository so different from the one compiled from source?
2011-03-11T23:56:00.000Z	MeanEYE	mimor	ubuntu tends to keep one version of software in repository... they call it debian freeze. they usually rollout changes much later. probably due to changes. you can almost always find ppa for program you are looking for and have up-to-date version
2011-03-11T23:57:00.000Z	mimor	MeanEYE	thx for the explanation ;)
2011-03-11T23:57:00.000Z	MeanEYE	mimor	np glad I could help... if you have trouble finding their ppa let me know
