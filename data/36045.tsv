2010-07-08T09:01:00.000Z	techzg		on ubuntu 10.04, on every boot I have to disable bluetooth and re-enable wireless network to get connected to internet. Is there a way to fix this please?

2010-07-08T09:02:00.000Z	aristo		and bluetooth go to Sistem -> preferences -> startup programs (or something like that)
2010-07-08T09:03:00.000Z	techzg	aristo	the wireless networks get discovered when i disable bluetooth
