2009-07-21T01:51:00.000Z	mzz	kjkjava	permissions on the dir
2009-07-21T01:52:00.000Z	kjkjava	mzz	cool - directory permissions always confused me... I'll research it
2009-07-21T01:53:00.000Z	mzz	kjkjava	if you have write perms to the dir and it's not "sticky" you can delete files in there even if they're not yours
