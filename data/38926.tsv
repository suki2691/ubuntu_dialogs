2010-02-26T13:29:00.000Z	abumaia		I have a laptop I use regularly with ubuntu 9.10 on it, and a WinXP desktop that runs 24/7 as my boinc machine.  If I attach an external usb hard drive to my windows machine, is there a way I could mount and access that drive on my ubuntu laptop, via wifi when I'm at home, or over the internet when I'm away?

2010-02-26T13:31:00.000Z	abumaia	airtonix	for ssh, do I have to install anything on the windox box?
2010-02-26T13:32:00.000Z	airtonix	abumaia	actually. sorry not ssh.
