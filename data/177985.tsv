2008-05-18T05:13:00.000Z	blizzardman1219		what i said before didn't make much sense: so here's a better version: i got my wireless card working so that it can read networks, but when i try to connect to my network, it asks for an encryption pass. i put in my encryption pass, and it begins to connect. this is where the problem starts. it will get half way to connecting and then it will ask for my pass again. it does this over and over and continues not to connect. please help
