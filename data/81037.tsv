2010-06-05T13:24:00.000Z	Circs		Could updates be handled by bitorrent in the future to reduce server load?
2010-06-05T13:24:00.000Z	C-Otto	Circs	maybe try a different server? what about http://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de :)
2010-06-05T13:24:00.000Z	Circs	C-Otto	I'm not having problems it was more of a technical question to further my understanding
2010-06-05T13:25:00.000Z	C-Otto	Circs	ubuntu CD releases are spread using bittorrent, I remember uploading with close to 2 GBit/sec using bittorrent a while ago
