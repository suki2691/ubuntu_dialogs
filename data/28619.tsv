Tried leaving some unallocated space, maybe it will see that, but no result. If instead of installing i run ubuntu from RAM, it can see my hdd and i can mount any partition with no problems.

2010-07-23T22:47:00.000Z	iuLianB	th1	tried that, same thing. I mounted the ext3 drive, and when i started the installer, it automatically unmounted it and didn't show anything in the list.
