2008-02-23T14:37:00.000Z	cwillu	Noobie	windows on it previously?
2008-02-23T14:38:00.000Z	cwillu	Noobie	okay, reboot into xp, tell it to run a scan disk (it'll reboot and scan at this point), and then do a _clean_ shutdown (i.e., no reset switch)
2008-02-23T14:39:00.000Z	cwillu	Noobie	the installer won't touch a windows partition that may be damaged due to an unclean shutdown
