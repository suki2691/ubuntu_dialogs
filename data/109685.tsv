2009-05-03T17:34:00.000Z	DaveWM		already looks kind of dark and stealthy
2009-05-03T17:35:00.000Z	oliver_g2	DaveWM	did you try the Appearance dialog (if you use Gnome, that is)?
2009-05-03T17:38:00.000Z	oliver_g2	DaveWM	the app/Gnome/Ubuntu devs will certainly be happy if you supply high-contrast themed icons for their apps :-D
