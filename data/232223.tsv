2010-09-04T16:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	alice_	a simple « sudo dd if=/dev/dvd of=/path/to/windows_img.iso » wont work ?
2010-09-04T16:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	alice_	i would redo the iso. maybe you missed some option  in the program (poweriso or whatever)? or maybe try another program.
2010-09-04T16:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	alice_	do the iso in ubuntu as i told you or using brasero?
