2006-07-13T07:34:00.000Z	poje	merlander	do you need to login to the network? the wifi access at my school does that until you login
2006-07-13T07:35:00.000Z	merlander	poje	no - well, it's encrypted with wpa, but the connection comes up
2006-07-13T07:37:00.000Z	poje	merlander	then I have no idea, coz I haven't used WPA on linux ;d
