2008-05-19T17:08:00.000Z	ub4b	bazhang	does it also work on jeos (not meant as a live cd, most remaster tools seem to be based on modifying a squasfs fs) ?
2008-05-19T17:09:00.000Z	bazhang	ub4b	it likely will do as jeos is ubuntu correct
2008-05-19T17:32:00.000Z	ub4b	bazhang	uck-gui doesn't like jeos: File /mnt/hgfs/ISO/jeos-8.04-jeos-i386.iso is not an Ubuntu DESKTOP EDITION ISO image, alternate CDs can be remastered using backend scripts.
2008-05-19T17:33:00.000Z	bazhang	ub4b	oh that is bad
