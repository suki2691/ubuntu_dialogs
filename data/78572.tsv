2009-08-21T04:55:00.000Z	sumo_su	joaopinto	well i had a corrupted system file that caused quite some trouble... ppl told me that might be data corruption due to ext4
2009-08-21T04:56:00.000Z	joaopinto	sumo_su	I am using ext4 for quite some time, never had troubles, I always trust my data to beackups, not to filesystems, hw failures are much more likely than a filesystem corruption :)
2009-08-21T04:57:00.000Z	sumo_su	joaopinto	thats kinda what i thought... cant be that difficult to code an upgraded FS and make it so solid that it doesnt mess up your data:)
