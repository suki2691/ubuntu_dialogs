2007-06-06T06:52:00.000Z	dmatysiak		in the past it hasn't
2007-06-06T06:53:00.000Z	hwilde	dmatysiak	do you know what a partition is?
2007-06-06T06:54:00.000Z	dmatysiak	hwilde	i am an experienced user. let's start with that. :) yes i know what a partition is. what i'm asking is, what does ubuntu mean by removed.
