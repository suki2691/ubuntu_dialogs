2010-04-07T02:14:00.000Z	Flamekebab	Losha	not quite, no. I've got a load of different video files and I want to rename them into a consistent pattern
2010-04-07T02:15:00.000Z	Losha	Flamekebab	so do you have a file renaming problem, or  a file format tagging problem?
2010-04-07T02:16:00.000Z	Flamekebab	Losha	it's more that I like the way EasyTag allows me to both rename files and sort ID3 tags. So I could have a folder of audio files and mass rename the "artist" component whilst leaving the rest untouched, or label tracks in numerical order
