2007-08-28T15:05:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	AhmedShaikhM	what was the last thing you saw?
2007-08-28T15:07:00.000Z	AhmedShaikhM	fyrestrtr	just a screeen saying loading linux kernel, after that it throws some error "Failed Region" and then saying "loading.." after that nothing
2007-08-28T15:07:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	AhmedShaikhM	sounds like a bad burn.
