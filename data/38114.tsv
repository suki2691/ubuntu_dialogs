2010-01-30T23:25:00.000Z	loonychune		I installed PHP using 'sudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5', was wondering how I might update my version to the latest?
2010-01-30T23:26:00.000Z	jrib	loonychune	run « sudo aptitude update » and repeat the command to upgrade to the latest in the repositories
2010-01-30T23:27:00.000Z	loonychune	jrib	Cheers, but I want to update to a version that isn't in the repositories yet. Is it worth it?
2010-01-30T23:27:00.000Z	jrib	loonychune	nope
