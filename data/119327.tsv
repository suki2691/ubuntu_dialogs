2008-08-07T09:33:00.000Z	lcphr3ak		Hey, I've installed ubuntu on a work machine, and plan on using parallels for running windows (only vm software our company bought). I tried to install it, but ran into an issue. Are there any known issues with Parallels and Ubuntu?

2008-08-07T09:36:00.000Z	lcphr3ak	bazhang	Yeah, I was thinking about install that, but my co-workers are using parallels Vm's to develope on (they all have macs :(). I'll contact parallels. Thanks
