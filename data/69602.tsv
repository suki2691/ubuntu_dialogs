2010-08-08T22:13:00.000Z	SimonP86		I've followed the steps at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu to add the Medibuntu repository to Ubuntu
2010-08-08T22:14:00.000Z	SimonP86		but I still can't see the java runtime in the Ubuntu Software Centre
2010-08-08T22:16:00.000Z	sacarlson	SimonP86	 you might try sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2010-08-08T22:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	SimonP86	 well I don't see sun-java6-jre in the repository but I gave you a name that did install java and other good stuf sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
