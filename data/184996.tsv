2006-05-26T15:53:00.000Z	Blissex	crowley1027	the MS XP booter does not really have a name... Some people call it from one of its components, 'NTLDR'
2006-05-26T15:53:00.000Z	Blissex	crowley1027	the MS XP booter can actually boot Linux too, but arranging that is far more subtle than making GRUB boot XP.
