2006-02-25T15:19:00.000Z	petaruwaru		I've got a question
2006-02-25T15:20:00.000Z	petaruwaru		my brother just installed linux on his computer, it has windows and linux running on it now, dual-boot
2006-02-25T15:20:00.000Z	petaruwaru		and now all of a sudden grub wont pop up when he boots, it gives him "error 15" and then wont do anything
2006-02-25T15:21:00.000Z	Aragorn_Guardian	petaruwaru	 use a boot cd, can be even ububtu live cd...correct the grub and reboot again...always get a live cd...
