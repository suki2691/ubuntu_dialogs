2011-08-27T19:55:00.000Z	th0r	kingofswords	what exactly do you mean by 'unwanted files'?
2011-08-27T19:56:00.000Z	kingofswords	th0r	like temp and cache files
2011-08-27T19:57:00.000Z	th0r	kingofswords	I don't think you want an apt-get option for that. For temp and cache files there is some new ubuntu thing....bitbleach or something like that
