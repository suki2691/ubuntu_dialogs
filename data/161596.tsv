2009-10-17T12:37:00.000Z	youssef		I have upgrade to Karmic Koala. And it freezes usually when using Firefox. I can move the mouse, but windows and menus do not react. ctrl-alt-fX, ctrl-alt-del ctrl-alt-bhackspace do not work
2009-10-17T12:38:00.000Z	Viking667	youssef	try this:    Alt-PrintScreen-R
2009-10-17T12:39:00.000Z	youssef	Viking667	ctrl-alt-f1 do not work then
