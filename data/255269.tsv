2006-10-28T08:55:00.000Z	Flats		Is this upgrade to Edgy going to be like a winblows upgrade where after the update completes, things just stop working?
2006-10-28T08:55:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	Flats	possibly...   are you running xubuntu or just regular ubuntu?
2006-10-28T08:56:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	Flats	do your upgrade like this:         gksu "update-manager -c"
2006-10-28T08:56:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	Flats	those should be fine
