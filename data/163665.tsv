2006-12-11T07:24:00.000Z	damageDOne		Hi does anyone know how to change keyboard shortcuts that aren't available through System>Preferences>Keyboard Shortcuts? I currently have a shortcut SHIFT + BACKSPACE which logs me out with no confirmation. I can't stand it.

2006-12-11T07:27:00.000Z	damageDOne	jrib	Thanks I thought it was a shortcut built into Edgy or my new laptop as I just upgraded to both. Now I know what to search for I might have more luck. Cheers
