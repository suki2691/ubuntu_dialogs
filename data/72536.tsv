2010-01-14T20:15:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	sporedi	been a long time.. but i think the 'who' command
2010-01-14T20:16:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	sporedi	try to talk to him... use the 'wall' command, hehe
2010-01-14T20:17:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	sporedi	ok, maybe it's not the who command. i'll try to keep looking for the command. ask the question again. maybe someone else knows
