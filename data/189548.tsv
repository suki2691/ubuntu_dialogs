2010-08-24T18:19:00.000Z	AmmoniumNitrate		a friend of mine just asked me if the fftw package in the ubuntu repositories is compiled with -enable-sse; how can I find out the answer (or does anyone here know)?

2010-08-24T18:23:00.000Z	coz_	AmmoniumNitrate	 the fftw in the repository  is not the most current however... you could  here  http://www.fftw.org/download.html and compile it with what he needs
