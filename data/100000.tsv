2008-11-26T06:50:00.000Z	|MUSE|		I just installed ubuntu-server. What would I need to install to get a graphical application to run over ssh, like: ssh -X 10.10.10.10 psp.
2008-11-26T06:52:00.000Z	|MUSE|		ï»¿fiXXXerMet: this application does not have a command-line. :/
2008-11-26T06:53:00.000Z	n8tuser	|MUSE|	-> your psp has to have an Xserver also
2008-11-26T06:54:00.000Z	n8tuser	|MUSE|	-> provide a better information
