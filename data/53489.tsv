2009-06-29T07:13:00.000Z	bobzillion	RequinB4	VM not a bad idea, this is for a user who wants to install several distros, but not burn the cds
2009-06-29T07:15:00.000Z	RequinB4	bobzillion	if s/he just wants to test them out, a free virtual machine is best you can just boot the iso without a cd.  Otherwise, there's no way around besdies having a comp that boots usb
