2010-08-03T07:50:00.000Z	soadkombucha		Couple of questions. I'm aware that the Ubuntu derivative I'm using is not Canonical supported, however most of it is added apps and a changed UI, and I am being told to remove broken packages before updating but I don't know how to do that. Secondly, I am having issues with windows install discs does anyone know how to get an ISO extracted to a partition and flag it as bootable so that I can install Windows?
