2011-06-22T20:46:00.000Z	s093294		Hello, i have a database question (any channels good for just that?) Someone might have a comment here aswell - I am to make a system that keeps information about ect all stadions in the world. Some information is logic that they all have, and then theres properly some stuff thats depended on country or other parameters. My question is then, would one create a new column for each time a new field is discovered, would it be better to have a field with xml

2011-06-22T20:47:00.000Z	Pici	s093294	#sql perhaps
2011-09-30T20:52:00.000Z	Pici	s093294	#latex would be a much better place to ask.
