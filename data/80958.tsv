2008-09-10T15:40:00.000Z	sinan		i am having trouble with my router. I know it is not ubuntu related, but any help would be appreciated. I got a new router, which I plan to use, but I forgot my PPPoE password. I have full access to the old router (which has the password), how can i retrieve it? It is a WRT54GLv1.1
