2009-09-27T09:44:00.000Z	DGG		I'm trying to install a program from source but when I type the ./configure command I get command not found. Any ideas?
2009-09-27T09:45:00.000Z	cowbud	DGG	what program?
2009-09-27T09:45:00.000Z	cowbud	DGG	where did you extract it, did you cd to that directory after extracting it ?
2009-09-27T09:46:00.000Z	cowbud	DGG	you need to read more, it uses cmake i.e. no configure
