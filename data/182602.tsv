2008-10-31T05:08:00.000Z	hacknperl		I tried it on three computers now and non of them are detecting the SATA drives...
2008-10-31T05:10:00.000Z	hacknperl		Has anyone succesulloy installed 8.10 on a SATA drive?
2008-10-31T05:10:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	hacknperl	i can probably tell you that tomorrow, 'cos that's what I'll be doing
