2007-12-17T01:27:00.000Z	ghostknife		I have a .deb file. What do I do with it to install/use it?
2007-12-17T01:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ghostknife	 what .deb ? sudo dpkg -i whatever.deb
2007-12-17T01:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ghostknife	 close all other package manager tools...
2007-12-17T01:30:00.000Z	ghostknife	Dr_willis	I figure that, but they are busy. So I wanted to know if I could force it to ignore the database. Does it really need to use it?
