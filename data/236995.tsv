2005-06-20T13:03:00.000Z	Amaranth	PhantomFreak	Also, this isn't "official", this is users trying to help other users.
2005-06-20T13:04:00.000Z	PhantomFreak	Amaranth	Ask the Ubuntu website that!
2005-06-20T13:04:00.000Z	Amaranth	PhantomFreak	Official just means they manage the channel, it doesn't mean we have to help everyone with everything instantly.
