2005-04-24T09:02:00.000Z	AlfonsVH		I've got a problem; I'm trying to install Wine in Kubuntu, but I don't know how to change the repositories in Kynaptic. When I try to install it with apt-get, it says: "E: malformed line 28 in source list", while I don't find any errors.
2005-04-24T09:03:00.000Z	sig	AlfonsVH	did you do: apt-get install wine ?
2005-04-24T09:03:00.000Z	sig		paste line 28
2005-04-24T09:04:00.000Z	AlfonsVH	sig	yes, I did that. My line 28 is : deb-src http://wine.sourceforge.net/apt/source/
