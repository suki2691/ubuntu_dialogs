2010-11-14T23:38:00.000Z	Sterm		I have a question, If you use windows but have a external hardrive with ubuntu, can viruses etc attack the linux software on the external hardrive??
2010-11-14T23:39:00.000Z	jiohdi	Sterm	the viruses can over write the linux software
2010-11-14T23:39:00.000Z	jiohdi	Sterm	if the windows allows it
2010-11-14T23:42:00.000Z	jiohdi	Sterm	normally it cannot unless the linux is on fat32
