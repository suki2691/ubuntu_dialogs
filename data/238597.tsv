2006-03-05T17:20:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	ProjectX	#2 is the only one I see Ubuntu (possibly) having issues with, but that's more of a "making the user understand the layout"
2006-03-05T17:21:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	ProjectX	even #2 might not matter...most (normal users) people just want it to work, and they ask for help, we walk them through it step-by-step (or have how-tos/tutorials ready to go)
