2011-08-10T17:51:00.000Z	Ismail		i originally had ubuntu. installed windows xp at a second partition. Now only windows boots. Right now i am using ubuntu livecd. What is the procedure to restore grub?
2011-08-10T17:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ismail	boot to ubuntu live CD and reinstate grub2
2011-08-10T17:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ismail	the windows installer has blindly overwritten the MBR
