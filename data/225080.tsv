2005-08-10T10:06:00.000Z	ZaphoidBB		I just did a fresh install of Ubuntu. And when I try to apt-get install sun-j2rel.5 as per http://ubuntuguide.org/#jre it says E: Couldn't find package sun-j2rel.5
2005-08-10T10:08:00.000Z	ZaphoidBB		Heh, using the guide at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Java I ran the command apt-get install sun-j2re1.5 and it still says "Couldn`t find package"
2005-08-10T10:09:00.000Z	avanspronsen	ZaphoidBB	did you install the additional repositories?
