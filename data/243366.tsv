2007-02-18T08:03:00.000Z	ElbridgeGerry		Hey all.
2007-02-18T08:05:00.000Z	ElbridgeGerry		Everytime I log in to anything but the failsafe terminal, the GNOME panel starts to load, but then dissappears and the system freezes. I've tried killall, but that didn't work. What can I do?
2007-02-18T08:07:00.000Z	ElbridgeGerry		Every time I try to log into GNOME (even the failsafe GNOME session) it freezes after trying to load the GNOME panel. I'm in the failsafe terminal now, and I've already tried killall. What do I do?
2007-02-18T08:08:00.000Z	thingy	ElbridgeGerry	what does ~/.xsession-errors say?
