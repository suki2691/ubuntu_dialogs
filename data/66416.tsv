2009-05-09T07:49:00.000Z	TimMc		I'm installing Ubuntu on a fresh hard drive. I want to set up encrypted LVM, but inside that I'd like to have separate /home and root partitions. Is this possible from the Alternate Install CD?

2009-05-09T07:51:00.000Z	TimMc	mzz	It seems that encrypted LVM doesn't allow further partitioning.
2009-05-09T07:52:00.000Z	mzz	TimMc	I have zero experience with encrypted lvm (or encrypted partitions for that matter)
