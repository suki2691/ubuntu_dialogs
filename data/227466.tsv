2005-07-28T07:55:00.000Z	just_in		I'm running hoary and I'm having a sound problem with totem, mplayer and xmms - totem plays video but no sound, while xmms and mplayer hang - can anyone point me in the right direction as to a fix?
2005-07-28T07:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	just_in	you need to tell xmms to use the esd output; i think it's under preferences/setup, somewhere like that
2005-07-28T07:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	just_in	i think something similar applies to mplayer -- maybe -ao esd, something like that
