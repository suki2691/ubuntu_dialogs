2009-11-25T02:03:00.000Z	grawity	David-T	Also every hour or something like that... dunno how often, but irssi does autosave its config.
2009-11-25T02:04:00.000Z	David-T	grawity	i think i was trying to change things through irssi & edit the config file at the same time at one point and got into a habit of using /save...
2009-11-25T02:07:00.000Z	grawity	David-T	I used to do that often - then I reached the point of typing /reload and having to wait 5 minutes for irssi to unfreeze >_>
