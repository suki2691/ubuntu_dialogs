2011-04-04T01:22:00.000Z	novitololo		*raid 0
2011-04-04T01:22:00.000Z	wonderworld	novitololo	you could reformat the mounted raid as ext4
2011-04-04T01:25:00.000Z	wonderworld	novitololo	raid drives must be partitioned with a "Linux Raid" partition anyway. when mounted, you get a logical drive which can be formated any way you like
