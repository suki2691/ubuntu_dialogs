2006-11-06T17:27:00.000Z	jeb		I have a quick question, i'm getting an error up "Your kernel sources cannot be found.  Kernel headers found...  They does not match your running kernel." when i run a configure.sh script.  I'm not running a special install or anything either... any ideas anyone?

2006-11-06T17:30:00.000Z	Exposure`	jeb	then you need to install a kernel, there's prolly a nice ubuntu way to do that
2006-11-06T17:30:00.000Z	Exposure`	jeb	kernel yes, kernel sources no
