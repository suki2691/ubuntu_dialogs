2006-06-28T10:53:00.000Z	danfg		is there anyway i can install all or the most common dev packages so i won't have trouble compiling source?
2006-06-28T10:54:00.000Z	GigaClon	danfg	build-essential
2006-06-28T10:55:00.000Z	danfg	GigaClon	build-essential is far from having all the usual dev packages i need to compile basic stuff like apache or php
