2008-08-30T09:04:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Awsoonn	go to nvidia and go through their selector
2008-08-30T09:04:00.000Z	Awsoonn	LSD|Ninja	why didnt I think of that :P I've been in linux land too long... I didn't even think to go to the manufacture page
2008-08-30T09:07:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Awsoonn	nvidia say 173.14.12 for GF6 series, no idea where that falls under Intrepid though
