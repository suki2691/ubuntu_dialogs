2007-09-28T10:05:00.000Z	darklard		 I was wondering if there was a good way to go from alsa version 1.0.15rc3 back to 1.0.14
2007-09-28T10:06:00.000Z	MasterShrek	darklard	if u open synaptic, and click on the alsa package, then go package > force version
2007-09-28T10:13:00.000Z	MasterShrek	darklard	how did you install the other versions?
2007-09-28T10:15:00.000Z	MasterShrek	darklard	youll have to find out how to get rid of the alsa that is already installed, i would try (in synaptic) to completely remove all alsa packages, then reinstall
