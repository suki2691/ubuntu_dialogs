2010-07-02T19:16:00.000Z	ShifftyOneJr		I have a sound blaster live card in this system but it isn't listed in control panel - Sound - Hardware.  How can I fix this and get sound?

2010-07-02T19:19:00.000Z	Oer	ShifftyOneJr	any cheap realtec card will do, i got stuck here with a SB live 24 gold card :(
2010-07-02T19:19:00.000Z	Oer	ShifftyOneJr	maybe onboard sound works ?
