2008-06-26T09:06:00.000Z	wce		Today i installed my amd64 copy of ubuntu 8 on a 80 gig drive by itself, i made sure to unplugg the windows hard drive in case of f ile loss, but what happens now is that when i plugged both drives grub wont recognize my windows install, it will just pass straight to ubuntu. what can i do to fix this???
2008-06-26T09:07:00.000Z	wce		I dont feel like installing it over again, how can i make it dual boot without reinstalling?
2008-06-26T09:08:00.000Z	wce		i guess ill just re install it with windows present!
