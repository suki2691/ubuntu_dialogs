2005-10-26T07:16:00.000Z	mustafu		well, I was custom partitioning with XFS....some of the settings available seemed unknown to me so I just more or less guessed on them...it installs the base packages and LILO, asking me where to install that (have no clue)..on one occasion, the winXP bootloader was still on there, and on another attempt, it did boot but dropped me to a command line..
