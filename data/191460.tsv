2012-05-04T03:28:00.000Z	Praxi		Where is a good place to ask about rails ide's on ubuntu.  Specifically, I want a notepad++ style thing that looks like this http://imagebin.org/210869 but without all the bloat.  ie tabbed editor, file explorer thing on the left, console/terminal on the bottom.  syntax? highlighting for the editor.  I tried Jedit, but its file explorer was hideous
2012-05-04T03:30:00.000Z	Praxi		mainly I just want something fast with a nice file explorer, been using eclipse with a aptana plugin, but it feels slow and kludgy
2012-05-04T03:31:00.000Z	Praxi		will do, thank you aardmark
2012-05-04T03:31:00.000Z	phaidros	Praxi	you might want to ask in #rails
