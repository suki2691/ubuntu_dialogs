2006-12-14T07:30:00.000Z	LjL	brianMan	i removed the 'resolvconf' package to achieve that, not sure it's a reasonable route, and ymmv. maybe you could also just set -w resolv.conf
2006-12-14T07:32:00.000Z	brianMan	LjL	I'm sure I stumbled upon some way to stop dhclient from touching it, but can't find anything in the man pages.. Will try to dig deeper.
