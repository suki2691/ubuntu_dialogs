2008-11-20T07:52:00.000Z	jlaroche		Hey guys! I'm wondering if there is a way to make ubuntu show folder icons the way Windows XP or Vista do. Let me explain... In vista and XP, if a folder has a jpeg within it called "folder.jpg" the folder's will have that picture displayed (when you view your folders in 'folder view'). Is there anyway to do something similar in Ubuntu?
