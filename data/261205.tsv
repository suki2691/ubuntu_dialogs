2004-11-08T13:12:00.000Z	Craigory		Hello all.  When I insert a CD or USB drive no icon appears in the Disks folder.  I can mount the CD or usbkey manually using "mount".  I have enabled auto-mounting in my gnome preferences.  udev, hal, hotplug, and gnome-volume-manager are installed.
2004-11-08T13:14:00.000Z	Craigory		Does anyone know how I might troubleshoot such a problem?
