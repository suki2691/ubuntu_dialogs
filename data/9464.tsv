2011-11-10T22:39:00.000Z	OliveGreen	Guybrush88	If I replace Banshee with Rhythbox, will I still be able to control it from the sound indicator on the top left of the screen?
2011-11-10T22:41:00.000Z	OliveGreen	Guybrush88	I see. Thanks. :-)
2011-11-10T22:41:00.000Z	OliveGreen	Guybrush88	I only wish to see Rhythmbox back as the default media player instead of Banshee in 12.04. :)
