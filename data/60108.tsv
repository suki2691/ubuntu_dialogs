2009-04-30T00:39:00.000Z	vart	quaal	you can try to enter bios setup, boot sequence and see if there is usb hdd in the list of choices for boot
2009-04-30T00:40:00.000Z	quaal	vart	it is not. but i recall on certain computers that option not being there unless there was a bootable device attached
2009-04-30T00:40:00.000Z	vart	quaal	could be the case... - then read docs on the motherboard
