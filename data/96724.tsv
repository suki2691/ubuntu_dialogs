2008-07-20T12:33:00.000Z	jepes		hi guys, i just received the ubuntu 8.04 cd, what is the best file system for me to use? (it will be used only for desktop, home use, single pc internet connection to the internet)
2008-07-20T12:34:00.000Z	jepes		Kernel : so which is better, reiserFS or ext3?
2008-07-20T12:35:00.000Z	jepes		Kernel : ok, thanks for the tip, i'll just google reiserFS and see the diff between ext3 and reiserFS.
