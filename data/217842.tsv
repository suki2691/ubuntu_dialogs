2005-11-03T11:24:00.000Z	Someguy		How do I boot into windows now? I just loaded linux, I can mount in linux but I can not boot into windows now. I can also choose windows from the startup list, but it just freezes after I select it. Any Ideas?
2005-11-03T11:25:00.000Z	Someguy		Can anyone please help with my booting problem?
