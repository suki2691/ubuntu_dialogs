2007-03-16T08:28:00.000Z	Bourne		how do I disable ANIMATIONS, and "show content while dragging windows"  in Edgy Eft Gnome?
2007-03-16T08:29:00.000Z	eck	Bourne	i think there are settings to do that in gconf, but you'd have to dig around a little bit
2007-03-16T08:29:00.000Z	eck	Bourne	probably in the metacity settings
2007-03-16T08:30:00.000Z	Bourne	eck	su gconf?
