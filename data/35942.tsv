2010-07-11T04:45:00.000Z	puff		Hi... so, I downlaoded and burned the live CD, it didn't want to boot on my laptop (t43p).  It did boot and pass media check on another machine, so I know the CD is good.
2010-07-11T04:46:00.000Z	puff		I remembered having a simialr problem, a couple years ago, wtih this laptop (t43p) so I did what I did then - downloaded the altnerate CD.  Booted fine. However, my purpose from the start was to boot into the live CD and use gparted to repartition.  Is this possible with the alternate CD?
2010-07-11T04:47:00.000Z	puff		Anybody know if I can do gparted repartitioning wtih the alternate CD?
