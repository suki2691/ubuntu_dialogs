2007-02-21T16:17:00.000Z	Chameleon22		my machine rebooted all of a sudden few days ago (got overheated). Didn't use it much since then and just noticed that the USB stoped responding to usb disks... Any idea how to fix this? it happened once before and i reinstalled to solve the issue since i couldnt find a solution. Any help?
