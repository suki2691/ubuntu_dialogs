2011-07-20T21:10:00.000Z	andrewS		the only way i know how to start xchat on 11.04 is typing "xchat" from console, since i can't find the link anywhere after installation. is there a method to prevent a console window from hanging there for the duration of the time i run xchat/irc?
2011-07-20T21:10:00.000Z	andrewS		like a silent run or something?
