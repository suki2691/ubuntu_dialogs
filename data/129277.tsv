2007-09-24T07:57:00.000Z	alecwh		I'm in High School, and I would love a program to organize my assignments/homework for my classes. Can someone suggest an app?

2007-09-24T07:59:00.000Z	alecwh	mboldisc	I am, doing my assignments with gedit. :). But I just need to keep track of what my homework assignments are.
2007-09-24T08:01:00.000Z	mboldisc	alecwh	I'll probably get bashed for saying this, but I use igoogle notebooks for small notes/tasks.
