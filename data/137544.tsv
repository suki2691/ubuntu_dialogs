2008-11-02T03:04:00.000Z	Fr0zen_		i've just installed 8.10 and I'm in love; however, I have a Dell E1405 with the broadcom "Draft-N" card that dell offered 2 years ago. The card is not detected, is there a driver update or easy way to fix this? I read the forums a bit but everything seems to be for 8.04 and is 2-3 years old.
2008-11-02T03:05:00.000Z	Doctor_Nick	Fr0zen_	broadcom cards need restricted drivers in order to run

2008-11-02T03:08:00.000Z	Doctor_Nick	Fr0zen_	go to System->Administration->Hardware Drivers
