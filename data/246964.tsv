2011-07-24T04:42:00.000Z	golemz		I feel silly, but is there a music player that will allow me to drag and drop a folder of music into a playlist, instead of scanning that folder and then painstakingly creating my playlist? i've tried exaile and clementine
2011-07-24T04:42:00.000Z	golemz		caveat: the folder resides on an smb share
2011-07-24T04:42:00.000Z	aroman	golemz	i don't see what smb would matter, since everything is abstracted via GIO nowadays
2011-07-24T04:43:00.000Z	aroman	golemz	have you tried Banshee?
