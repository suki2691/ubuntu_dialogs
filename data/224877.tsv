2007-02-06T16:59:00.000Z	Nikolas		Loads of bugs and security holes

2007-02-06T17:03:00.000Z	osfameron	Nikolas	it's probably silly to say that ubuntu isn't hard.  There are certain things about ubuntu that are harder than windows (configuring dual head monitors?  getting wireless to work... at least before gnome-network-applet or whatever it's called)
