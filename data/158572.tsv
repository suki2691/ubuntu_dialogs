2007-12-20T05:03:00.000Z	oggie		is there someplace i can get help for setting up my eggdrop
2007-12-20T05:03:00.000Z	oggie		i looked at eggheads.org and ./configure doesnt work for the apt-get version
2007-12-20T05:04:00.000Z	oggie		i ./eggdrop at the folder and it says no configuration files
2007-12-20T05:04:00.000Z	Slart	oggie	./configure is for the source version... when you apt-get something you get the compiled version
