2010-01-16T17:16:00.000Z	guntbert	meowbuntu-afk	yes - aptitude is another packet manager like apt-get
2010-01-16T17:17:00.000Z	meowbuntu-afk	guntbert	aptitude does more than apt-get right
2010-01-16T17:19:00.000Z	guntbert	meowbuntu-afk	they are both frontends to the same back-end - they do some things different - I prefer aptitude (one thing - it autoremoves packages which where only pulled in for a dependency when you remove the dependant app)
