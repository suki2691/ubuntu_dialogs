2008-04-03T22:16:00.000Z	kitche	plurt	what is the problem exactly?
2008-04-03T22:16:00.000Z	plurt	kitche	when firefox opens a page of it's own, like after an upgrade or so, it uses www.%u.com as link
2008-04-03T22:17:00.000Z	kitche	plurt	might be due to how ubuntu's firefox is setup not sure though
