2008-12-28T15:01:00.000Z	xerox1		is there any backup tool that supports something like versioning (similar to svn)?
2008-12-28T15:03:00.000Z	jtaji	xerox1	you could use svn... but rdiff-backup stores diffs allowing you to retrieve files from older times
2008-12-28T15:04:00.000Z	xerox1	jtaji	but then i need a server...i would like to leave that out
2008-12-28T15:05:00.000Z	jtaji	xerox1	either solution can be used locally
