2008-03-23T03:11:00.000Z	EugZol_		I want to play Laser Age game on wine. But when I do 'wine LaserAge.exe' I get error: 'Beatnik did not initialize, please make sure that a Beatnik Soundbank has been loaded properly'. There are some .RMF files in the game folder and so it seems wine could load proper codec for them. Could somebody help me with this issue?
