2009-07-29T11:08:00.000Z	ProfOak		Hey all, how do I turn off my desktop so I only have a set of terminals?
2009-07-29T11:09:00.000Z	cellofellow	ProfOak	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2009-07-29T11:09:00.000Z	cellofellow	ProfOak	same command except "start" to regain the gui.
2009-07-29T11:09:00.000Z	cellofellow	ProfOak	and I suggest using screen while you are enjoying the land of the console.
