2005-06-28T08:37:00.000Z	mdipi		Does anyone know what 'ncurces' is? I need it for an install but have no clue what i would look for in apt-get
2005-06-28T08:38:00.000Z	Davey	mdipi	its the library that will display "graphic" text UIs
2005-06-28T08:38:00.000Z	mdipi	Davey	is it just 'apt-get install ncurses' ?
2005-06-28T08:39:00.000Z	Davey	mdipi	apt-cache search ncurses if its not :)
