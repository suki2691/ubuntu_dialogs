2007-08-21T16:46:00.000Z	MBR666		i'm using xubuntu. i was wondering how does one browse my network shares
2007-08-21T16:46:00.000Z	MBR666		kde, gnome had their own broswers for network shares
2007-08-21T16:48:00.000Z	silvertip257	MBR666	 I'd be curious to know too - I use Xubu too and I'm not aware of a net share browser
2007-08-21T16:48:00.000Z	MBR666	silvertip257	the only way i know is through samba and it doesn't seem to work correctly under xubuntu
