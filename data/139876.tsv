2009-08-08T01:27:00.000Z	Pharsalus		Hey guys, I've got Opera Internet Explorer problems. Firefox loads webpages fine, but when I try the same page in Opera it acts like there's no connection. I'm using Jaunty UNR on an Advent 4211c (MSI Wind). Looked on the web but it seems like a unique problem, any ideas? tia.

2009-08-08T01:30:00.000Z	Pharsalus		I installed Opera from the .deb file available from the Opera website, should I try it from a repo?
