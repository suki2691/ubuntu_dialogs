2010-12-24T01:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	slide	 you can mount via uuid, or even disk label. if you set up fstab right.
2010-12-24T01:33:00.000Z	slide	ZykoticK9	do i just use that instead of the dev location in the fstab entry?
2010-12-24T01:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	slide	 or other ways i recall. but UUID is common
