2005-11-01T12:57:00.000Z	psusi		one of these days I'm going to build a custom kernel with reiser4 support, and switch over and do some of my own benchmarking

2005-11-01T12:57:00.000Z	TTilus	psusi	when you are done, publish the results and let me know too
2005-11-01T12:58:00.000Z	psusi	TTilus	heh... ok
