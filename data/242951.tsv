2005-04-16T05:18:00.000Z	IceMan3301		Hello everyone...  I am running Ubuntu 5.04.  How do I add an item to the "Applications" menu in Gnome?
2005-04-16T05:18:00.000Z	IceMan3301		Gnome places everything on the panel
2005-04-16T05:18:00.000Z	IceMan3301		dragging the apps to the applications menu doesn't seem to work
