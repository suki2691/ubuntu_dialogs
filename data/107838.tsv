2008-11-02T03:24:00.000Z	tauchris	Fr0zen_	I have the B43 drivers, and they are not working for me.  Could you ack me-- just so I know my messages are getting out?
2008-11-02T03:25:00.000Z	tauchris	Fr0zen_	are you 64-bit?
2008-11-02T03:27:00.000Z	tauchris	Fr0zen_	I think that's the only way you can install them. :)
