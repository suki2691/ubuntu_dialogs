2011-04-08T07:44:00.000Z	UkeofJersey		I had added a PPA source via terminal (pmcenery for iphone stuff) and after perusing the other stuff, decided to remove the source.  I removed it from Software Sources and no dice.  I then deleted the two pmcenery files from /etc/apt/sources.list.d and it STILL shows up in Software Center
