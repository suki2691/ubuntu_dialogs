2010-11-24T01:20:00.000Z	stellarnight		I can't get my wireless card to work. In fact I can't get any wireless card I own to work. Both internal and two different USB cards fail to work. What steps can I take towards diagnosing the problem. The online documentation for my computer states that the internal card should work out of the box with non-free drivers activated.
