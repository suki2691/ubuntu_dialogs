2012-02-06T21:43:00.000Z	jigspan		can anyone explain what cause improper shutdown in 11.10?
2012-02-06T21:44:00.000Z	jag	jigspan	same symptom here, i'm guessing if u logon on plaintext that you should exit before trying to shutdown.. (i think it only shutsdown properly from the gui screen)
2012-02-06T21:46:00.000Z	jag	jigspan	i know.. it sometimes freezes for me too.. i did an upgrade after installing 11.10 and not sure if it'll recur
2012-02-06T21:51:00.000Z	jigspan	jag	i have found that it is bios , acpi or driver problem.
