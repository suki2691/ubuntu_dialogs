2008-06-08T17:16:00.000Z	jrib	r0dzilla	they are in -proposed.  Enable this "testing" repository, grab only that package, then disable it again
2008-06-08T17:16:00.000Z	r0dzilla		ah, I see
2008-06-08T17:16:00.000Z	r0dzilla	jrib	is there a way to temporarily enable a repo on the command line? I've can't remember
