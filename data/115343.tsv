2007-10-24T22:38:00.000Z	philo23_		hey, guys i'm running ubuntu 6.06 on my old pc, is there a way to update it to 7.10 via the command line, i dont have a gusty cd handy, i do have a DVD, but this is an old pc, any ideas?
2007-10-24T22:39:00.000Z	d0ll4	philo23_	: you could manually edit /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-10-24T22:39:00.000Z	philo23_	d0ll4	would i change dapper to gutsy? and so on?
2007-10-24T22:40:00.000Z	philo23_	d0ll4	would that actually update the system from 6.06 it self though?
