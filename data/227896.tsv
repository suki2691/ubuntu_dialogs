2005-07-23T05:26:00.000Z	indigo_	Slipaway172	it doesn't really matter, but you can't have more than 4 primary partitions, and 4 subpartitions per extended partition
2005-07-23T05:27:00.000Z	indigo_	Slipaway172	http://www.ata-atapi.com/hiwtab.htm explains it in detail, but probably you don't really need to read it
