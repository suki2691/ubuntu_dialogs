2009-04-24T07:26:00.000Z	phil1		can anyone give me a hand with a sound issue? i just did a clean install of jaunty and i have a soundblaster audigy 4 card that worked fine with 8.10...it is recognized in jaunty but i am getting no sound at all
2009-04-24T07:28:00.000Z	chappel	phil1	- I had issues with the sound on my eeepc 901 w/ unr - I had to specify the sound device in each app instead of using 'default'
2009-04-24T07:29:00.000Z	phil1	chappel	i'm on a desktop...how would i go about changing each app's sound device?
