2011-04-16T23:36:00.000Z	KSHawkEye		Is there a way to remove all files with numbers in them, such as "filename-3" (only the files with -numbers.extension) in a single command? (Sorry if thats a little confusing, I can explain better if needed)

2011-04-16T23:37:00.000Z	KSHawkEye	pfifo	Thanks, I did it with a "rm /path/*-*.lib"
2011-04-17T02:14:00.000Z	pfifo	KSHawkEye	unset i think
