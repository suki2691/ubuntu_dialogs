2010-10-06T11:35:00.000Z	Cancambo		Alright so, I am very new to Ubuntu (I just installed tonight), and I am very lost.  Specifically, I am not sure what I am supposed to be doing to get my wireless card to work.  I have a USR2216 desktop PCI wireless adapter, and for the life of me I just can't figure out what to do to get it to work.  I am not sure if I am supposed to use ACX or NDISwrapper.
