2010-02-23T02:43:00.000Z	neurochrome	c3l	chmod 000
2010-02-23T02:43:00.000Z	c3l	neurochrome	does that make only the folderowner able to access the folder/file? can root touch it?
2010-02-23T02:43:00.000Z	neurochrome	c3l	000 not only stops them from writing to the file, it stops anyone but root from reading it
