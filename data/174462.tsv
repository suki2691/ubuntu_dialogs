2006-09-12T12:59:00.000Z	iam8up|vis		can anyone tell me why after i 'sudo apt-get upgrade' i get this message: 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
2006-09-12T13:00:00.000Z	iam8up|vis		i'm sure it has something to do with the sources.list in /etc/apt - any ideas?
2006-09-12T13:01:00.000Z	paulm	iam8up|vis	have you opened everything in the software properties?
2006-09-12T13:04:00.000Z	paulm	iam8up|vis	might also be useful to add some of the unoffical back ports to your sources.list file.
