2007-06-15T08:29:00.000Z	leslie		I need help setting up everquest (EQ1) on a ubuntu system, if anyone is familiar with this.
2007-06-15T08:29:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	leslie	what do you want to know?
2007-06-15T08:31:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	leslie	are you sure that everquest is made for linux?
2007-06-15T08:33:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	leslie	well.. you can just try to do 'wine <name-of-setup-file>' and see if it works.. otherwise just install cedega and try to run on that.. but i'm not sure if it will work on any for those 2...
