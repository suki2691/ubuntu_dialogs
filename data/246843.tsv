2005-03-07T07:17:00.000Z	bob2	httpdss	that came up on the list in the past week or so
2005-03-07T07:19:00.000Z	httpdss	bob2	this problem occured for the first time today when y did a dist-upgrade ... yesterday i did one too, and nothing happened
2005-03-07T07:24:00.000Z	bob2	httpdss	adding the kernel paramter "noinotify" should work around it for now
