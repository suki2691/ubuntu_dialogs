2007-08-09T16:30:00.000Z	Tambu	fyrestrtr	happen to know a url or something I can google for that ? I haven't done that before
2007-08-09T16:31:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Tambu	any apt manual should help you out, don't have a url handy. Just google 'apt policy'
2007-08-09T16:31:00.000Z	Tambu	fyrestrtr	thanks
