2009-08-14T09:26:00.000Z	qdb		now update manager says 904 is available. what will it say when 910 will be available?
2009-08-14T09:26:00.000Z	qdb		when 910 is released
2009-08-14T09:27:00.000Z	jedc	qdb	if you are upgrading i think you need to upgrade to 9.04 before 9.10, but a fresh install would probably be easier
