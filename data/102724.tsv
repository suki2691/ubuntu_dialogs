2008-01-27T16:31:00.000Z	linxeh	shedflex	as in the default for serial ports that sit on the pci bus is they start at ttyS2 (so they dont conflict with the normal ttyS0+1 on the old ISA bus). might have changed though and I could be wrong ;P
2008-01-27T16:33:00.000Z	shedflex	linxeh	okay, thanks for that info - wasn't aware of that
2008-01-27T16:33:00.000Z	shedflex	linxeh	first time I've used Ubuntu for working with the serial ports (microcontroller stuff) and normally I'm used to using ttyS0/1, so thanks for that :)
