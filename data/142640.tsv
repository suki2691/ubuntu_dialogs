2007-03-16T16:33:00.000Z	bieb		Is there a partition/volume size limit? I want to connect 5 750gb drives to a raid card in a backup server running Ubuntu and rsnapshot
2007-03-16T16:34:00.000Z	Phonica	bieb	no limits at all other than the normal max 4 primary partitions per physical disk
2007-03-16T16:35:00.000Z	bieb	Phonica	so chuck the disks in, connect them to the raid card and 3tb if backup storage?
