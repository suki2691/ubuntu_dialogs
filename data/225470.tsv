2005-08-03T10:59:00.000Z	faen		I have to say that ubuntu is sort of a tough transition from mandrake/mandriva
2005-08-03T10:59:00.000Z	NekoNeko	faen	please don't compare anything to mandrake
2005-08-03T11:00:00.000Z	faen	NekoNeko	I have used mandrake for quite some time and I guess I am just use to the look/feel of it
2005-08-03T11:00:00.000Z	NekoNeko	faen	I tried mandrake and it did nothing but crash, redhat the same, fedora is a bit more stable
