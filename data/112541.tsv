2007-11-29T07:15:00.000Z	noonah	jsoftw	much faster than ubuntu, but also lighter on functions
2007-11-29T07:17:00.000Z	jsoftw	noonah	define lighter on functions.. like surely it has all the same applications and what not available?
2007-11-29T07:18:00.000Z	noonah	jsoftw	ok one thing that annoys me about xubuntu...lack of network volume handling
