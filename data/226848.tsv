2007-02-11T06:23:00.000Z	n4cht		i'm glad everyone is talking about this nvidia upgrade issue -now-.    i upgraded by haven't restarted yet.
2007-02-11T06:24:00.000Z	n4cht		i'm pretty sure i made an ubuntu forum post about the kernel vs. nvidia upgrade issues probably well over a year ago.  this problem isn't new.   a new kernel version usually brings this sort of thing about, because the compatible nvidia driver is always a few hours (sometimes days) behind the new kernel.
