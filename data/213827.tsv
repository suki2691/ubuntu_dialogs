2009-02-12T22:02:00.000Z	hatten		hello, i wanna move a bunch of files in a bunch of different folders to another folder, renaming the files with their original folders names. Is that possible to do in a quick way with the terminal?

2009-02-12T22:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	hatten	I can give you the pointer, but I'm not going to do the work for you and spoonfeed it to you.
