2007-03-11T11:25:00.000Z	whtvrrob	ttmrichter	another idea is some basic python programming, i know i'm 16 and i like that, they may as well, and simple, also on ubuntu shipit if you order them all a 6.06 cd they'd be more likely to use that than making their own
2007-03-11T11:27:00.000Z	ttmrichter	whtvrrob	eck: I've just sent in an order to shipit for 300 disks for exactly that purpose.  And I want to start them off with being users first -- UNIX is an alien world to them.  They can get their programming from the other classes.  I just want to show them a world outside of Java, Javascript and ASP.
