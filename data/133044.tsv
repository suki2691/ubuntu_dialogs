2007-10-25T11:27:00.000Z	aaronshaf		Could someone please help me out? I somehow switched desktops and I have no bar on bottom or top
2007-10-25T11:27:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	aaronshaf	Are you running Compiz?
2007-10-25T11:28:00.000Z	aaronshaf	DerangedDingo	yes, I'm running compiz, and right clicking the desktop gives me nothing
2007-10-25T11:29:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	aaronshaf	It's just Compiz's problem with multiple desktops. upgrade your version or just remove the extra desktops. you might have to Ctrl + Alt + Bkspc
