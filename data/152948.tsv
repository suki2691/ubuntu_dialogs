2009-01-26T23:10:00.000Z	user___	FuriousGeorge	yes, they just dont match ;-)
2009-01-26T23:13:00.000Z	FuriousGeorge	user___	i read on a forum that because sun-java6-bin is a bin that you can just use the .deb
2009-01-26T23:16:00.000Z	user___	FuriousGeorge	theres some truth to this, but in effect you need a perfectly matching system and this includes for instance having the correct libc, etc..
