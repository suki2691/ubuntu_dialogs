2007-09-03T15:01:00.000Z	dug_	chautemoc	you may need to use ndiswrapper to make your wireless card work.  this page says you have a dell broadcom 1300 wireless card: http://guilds.net/machines/600m/
2007-09-03T15:05:00.000Z	dug_	chautemoc	sorry, the only thing i can tell you is that i have a dell 1490 wireless card and i used these instructions (which work for 1390 too), maybe they can be adapted to the 1300 card: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=297092
