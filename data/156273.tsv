2008-04-30T09:40:00.000Z	sven_oostenbrink		 I need to automate a task where I daily copy some 500 files from some 50 different directories to a remote FTP server.. Im looking at the ftp command but I don't see how I can automate that (like specifying the user name, password, etc).. How could I automate this task?
