2009-09-28T06:30:00.000Z	_schism_		I need some help and google is letting me down. I did a default install of ubuntu with wubi and all is good except it split the loopback into 2 5 gig partitions and the /root is full. is tehre anyway to get some of the other 5 gigs from /boot? gparted seems to only work on physical drives so I am at a loss
