2008-06-01T20:27:00.000Z	ImDude		there is one a little annoying thing that I can't find the settings for it since I am here for a quick stop I may s well as for it: when I have multiple windows open the windows behind the main windows becomes transparent a little, how can I remove that transparency /opacity ??
2008-06-01T20:27:00.000Z	cognatus	ImDude	do you have compiz or the basic WM?
2008-06-01T20:28:00.000Z	cognatus	ImDude	press alt+f2 type 'ccsm'
2008-06-01T20:28:00.000Z	cognatus	ImDude	you'll have to fiddle a bit as tehre are many different transparency settings
