2007-12-25T03:07:00.000Z	mcquaid		not sure if anyone knows about this.  trying to watch a movie, and i have spanish subs for it. and there are a lot of underscores in it
2007-12-25T03:08:00.000Z	mcquaid		when i open the sub file in a text editor i see a lot of question marks where those underscores show up in mplayer
2007-12-25T03:08:00.000Z	mcquaid		is there some spanish lang file i did for subs to work properly?
