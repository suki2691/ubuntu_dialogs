2008-02-15T08:09:00.000Z	LjL	Varanger	well, ubuntu doesn't *want* you to go and install the "latest" NVIDIA driver to begin with, it'd much rather have you use the ones from the repositories, which have the added benefit of not breaking on kernel updates and stuff.

2008-02-15T08:12:00.000Z	LjL	Varanger	well, *our* suggestion (no, call it a strong recommendation) is to keep using the ubuntu-provided drivers. do you know for sure that you've got anything to gain from the "latest" drivers? from what i've heard, there's more added bugs than benefits. and in any case, if you do that, be prepared to have a text-mode only system every time there is a kernel update
