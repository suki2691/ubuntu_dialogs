2009-09-07T03:28:00.000Z	sevol3		I created a bootable usb with USB STartupDisk creator.. it works but I thinks it only for ubuntu/linux boxes cuz when I tried it on a windows box it wont boot, is that true?

2009-09-07T03:30:00.000Z	sevol3	arand	it is set to boot from usb
2009-09-07T03:33:00.000Z	arand	sevol3	In theory there are nothing like a "windows computer" or a "GNU/Linux computer" they're all pc:s... But in what way does the usb not boot then?
