2009-07-08T18:28:00.000Z	abb	frink_	Depends on if you're managing *one* or *multiple* boxes at once.  I've always found Webmin (webmin.sourceforge.net) to be a great tool when dealing with multiple server boxes (and it works w/ other linuxes as well)
2009-07-08T18:29:00.000Z	abb	frink_	oops, forgot to mention that Webmin is a browser-based utility.  GUI, yes, but ... well, you get the idea.  :)
