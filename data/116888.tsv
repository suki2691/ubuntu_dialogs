2008-08-30T16:58:00.000Z	chazco		Hi... whenever i get a kernel update it breaks my wifi :( The wifi is a series of modules that have been compiled (Ubuntu doesnt support the card)... any ideas on fixing this? Also, can i make a module unload/load every so often to try and prevent drop outs?

2008-08-30T17:02:00.000Z	chazco	LSD|Ninja	- heh... just found a different bug report... supposedly its been fixed in Intrepid (about 3 full releases after it first appeared) :)
