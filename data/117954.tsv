2007-10-04T16:05:00.000Z	phoo_		does anybody know whether libquicktime0 replaces quicktime4linux? or the second one should also be built
2007-10-04T16:06:00.000Z	Downix	phoo_	libquicktime is the underlying library, you'd still need quicktime4linux
2007-10-04T16:07:00.000Z	phoo_	Downix	do you know if there are precompiled packages for this?
2007-10-04T16:07:00.000Z	Downix	phoo_	 don't know off-hand,  don't use Quicktime
