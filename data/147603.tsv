2007-02-28T17:58:00.000Z	nexous		Hey, is there a console like program where I can set the whole thing to transparency rather than just the body text?
2007-02-28T17:58:00.000Z	KillerT	nexous	u mean the title bar and stuff?
2007-02-28T17:59:00.000Z	nexous	KillerT	yes, I'm using Konsole right now, but the body is only transparent.
