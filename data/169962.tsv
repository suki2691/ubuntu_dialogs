2007-07-10T11:48:00.000Z	Zrax		Ok, so here's one that's got me:  I decided to be gutsy and try updating to gutsy ;), and now booting is totally screwed up for me...  Grub is still there (and installed properly), but when booting, it will fill half of the first  bar and then freeze indefinately.  When I turn off the graphical splash, it just gives me a completely blank screen (no kernel messages or anything)...  Any ideas?
