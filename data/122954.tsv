2009-05-19T05:19:00.000Z	mabus		I downloaded part of a torrent on another host using rtorrent, i copied the downloaded folder with the partially downloaded content into this host and I'm trying to use transmission but it says I have 0% downloaded, how can I start with a hash check?

2009-05-19T05:21:00.000Z	mabus	mindrape	I'm not on the rtorrent host, but more specifically what do I need from what folder on the rtorrent host, then?
2009-05-19T05:21:00.000Z	mindrape	mabus	- not sure... lots of programs create hidden folders (ie; .programname) in the home directory from where you were running them.
