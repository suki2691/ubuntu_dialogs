My terminal prompt shows up as $ on my domain account now. I would like to change it back, but I am unsure of how because the chsh command will only change the setting for LOCAL users, not domain users. What can I do?

2011-03-08T09:39:00.000Z	roasted__	Jordan_U	perhaps you're right. Either way, I can't change it back, as chsh only works for local users. It errors out saying the user doesn't exist in /etc/passwd, which I was like, no kidding... its a domain user...
