2007-08-03T08:20:00.000Z	ashmund		I just logged out of a guest account, computer locked up with just a black screen.  After a hard reboot, I no longer have use of most number keys. Only "5","6".  On the number pad however I have full 123456789.  Any ideas?
2007-08-03T08:21:00.000Z	ashmund		This is a huge problem because I can no longer login to my main account or root.

2007-08-03T08:22:00.000Z	ashmund	Drizzt321	I'll try that.
