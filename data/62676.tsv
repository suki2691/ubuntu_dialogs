2011-08-14T12:36:00.000Z	iceroot	tabakhase	please dont suggest here to create a root-account, we support only sudo
2011-08-14T12:38:00.000Z	tabakhase	iceroot	its not about creating, its just adding a keyfile/new password ;-) and surly not recommend...
2011-08-14T12:38:00.000Z	iceroot	tabakhase	and we dont support doing something as root
2011-08-14T12:40:00.000Z	iceroot	tabakhase	also debian does not provided a root-account in the expert-installation, debian is using the same config as ubuntu there with only sudo and an disabled root-account
