2006-06-29T08:20:00.000Z	Cornellius	cartesian1984	Would like to.
2006-06-29T08:20:00.000Z	cartesian1984	Cornellius	oh, sorry for my vagueness, I meant do you think Ubuntu will have support?
2006-06-29T08:21:00.000Z	Cornellius	cartesian1984	Ubuntu use 3.4 for ReiserFS as they feel like 4 is stable enough yet. A friend of mine's using ver. 4 and haven't experienced any problems yet. He's not using Ubuntu though.
