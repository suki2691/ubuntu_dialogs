2006-02-23T11:11:00.000Z	Kelerion-flux		ok folks.. I need some help with an xorg.conf problem.. here's what I have http://pastebin.com/561199 .. anyone see anything fundamentally wrong?
2006-02-23T11:11:00.000Z	Kelerion-flux		it's getting resolution on 3rd monitor wrong and everything is totally unstable
2006-02-23T11:13:00.000Z	Kelerion-flux		that was just something I was trying out.. it makes no difference to the problem
2006-02-23T11:14:00.000Z	_lemsx1_	Kelerion-flux	using one screen at a time works right?
