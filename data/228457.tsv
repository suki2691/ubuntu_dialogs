2008-08-26T07:43:00.000Z	voodz		hi i just bought a sony vaio VGN-FW140E ... during install attempts using live cd i get screwed up graphics glitches all over the screen and the install goes into a blank screen. this is using boot off cd to try it out. does anyone have any idea why this is happening?
2008-08-26T07:43:00.000Z	voodz		i have even tried safe video mode install, i get into the os but there are 1 million mouse cursurs on the screen. and its glitched beyond recognition
2008-08-26T07:44:00.000Z	slacker	voodz	did you try installing any video drivers?
2008-08-26T07:45:00.000Z	slacker	voodz	I have never done this, before but I have heard/believe that you can install the drivers for the device prior to the install or include it in the install.
