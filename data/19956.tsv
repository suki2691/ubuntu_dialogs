2011-01-23T05:37:00.000Z	sitescripter		does anyone know an easy way to reduce the bit depth of the screen?  i think it's running at 24 or 32 bit color depth.  i'd  rtfm more, but my eyes recently became very light sensitive, and reading is hard on the screen. i'm hoping reducing the color depth might help reduce the contrast.  i'm using ubuntu/gnome/and ati/"amd proprietary fglrx graphics drivers" .  mostly the default ubuntu 10.10 install.
