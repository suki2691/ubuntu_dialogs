2011-05-14T06:51:00.000Z	papna_		I have an USB external SATA drive dock. I hooked it up and the disk has been spinning several minutes, but I have no indication the drive has actually been mounted. How should I proceed?

2011-05-14T06:54:00.000Z	papna_	EGuinn	Its mostly an ext4 partition.
2011-05-14T06:54:00.000Z	EGuinn	papna_	Oh, that won't be a problem then...
