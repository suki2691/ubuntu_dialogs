2011-05-18T05:59:00.000Z	hypoon	Loshki	I ran memtest, it said everything was OK. I only ran one pass though

2011-05-18T06:19:00.000Z	hypoon	Loshki	I didn't let it run overnight, no. It took about 15 minutes to do one pass, and I exited during the second pass. Pardon me while I swap PSUs with another machine I forgot was around.
