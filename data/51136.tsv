2009-08-05T03:35:00.000Z	Syron4		So which should I install, 32-bit or 64-bit? I've got a quad-core processor with 4gb of ram
2009-08-05T03:36:00.000Z	Syron4		Why do you guys prefer the 64-bit? Will I notice faster operations? Will it limit available software packages?
2009-08-05T03:37:00.000Z	Syron4		is the 64-bit just as stable as the 32-bit?
2009-08-05T03:38:00.000Z	Drained	Syron4	Yes, but conflicts with 32bit app's is the real problem
