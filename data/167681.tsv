2006-10-09T12:30:00.000Z	chico_		Since nobody seems can help me, would someone just let me know if this Linux thinggy ubuntu has SYSTEM RESTORE feature
2006-10-09T12:30:00.000Z	THX-1138	chico_	it's no "fix" but try this create a launcher add shutdown -f now  in the command section  - the f is force filesystem chek and s optional
2006-10-09T12:35:00.000Z	THX-1138	chico_	desktop shortcuts can be dragged to the menu bar on the top and bottom of the screen. right click .. launcher   .. command .. "shutdown now" options -f filecheck -r reboot
