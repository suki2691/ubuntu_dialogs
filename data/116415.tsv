2008-04-28T00:25:00.000Z	garu		does anyone have any idea on why is that there are no updates since 8.04 has been released?every other ubuntu distro has updates right after its release.
2008-04-28T00:25:00.000Z	giovani	garu	because nothing's been updated yet?
2008-04-28T00:26:00.000Z	giovani	garu	there aren't updated packages released every single day ... sometimes they just aren't required
2008-04-28T00:27:00.000Z	garu	giovani	the question is, ever since it came out, it has no updates,its been out for 3 days!
