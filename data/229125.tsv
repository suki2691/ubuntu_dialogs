2007-04-23T13:56:00.000Z	Schmendrick		I have a simple question. I have an empty secondary hard drive. How can I ensure installing ubuntu will not make it impossible for me to boot back into windows?
2007-04-23T13:57:00.000Z	mwe	Schmendrick	the installer sets up a dual boot for you
2007-04-23T13:57:00.000Z	mwe	Schmendrick	or if you're really paranoid don't install the boot loader and boot from a boot floppy to get to linux. but that kinda sucks ;)
2007-04-23T13:58:00.000Z	mwe	Schmendrick	you can always restore the windows boot loader if you want
