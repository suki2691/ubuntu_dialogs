2008-01-22T07:58:00.000Z	jscinoz		ummm why is my glxgears framerate MUCH higher with compiz running than with metacity >_<
2008-01-22T07:59:00.000Z	erawfish	jscinoz	glxgears is no benchmark
2008-01-22T08:01:00.000Z	jscinoz	erawfish	i realise that, but nevertheless it shouldnt run faster with compiz hogging part of the gpu...
