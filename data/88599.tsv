I am planning to run ubuntu. I have a work PC with it on that has an inter core 2 due and nVidia GeForce 8600, and I'd like something fairly comparable, but probably with onboard graphics. looking around, AMD processors seem to be somewhat cheaper than...

2009-01-12T19:52:00.000Z	chalcedony	ne2k__	you will probably love ubuntu, go with alsa for sound. my amd64 is great
2009-01-12T19:52:00.000Z	ne2k__	chalcedony	I already use it for work, and I do love it. I just don't have a PC at home so I'm planning to build one.
