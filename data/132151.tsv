2009-10-26T03:32:00.000Z	ariqz		Is there a distribution of linux that isn't so uppity? I don't want a million different updates all the time. I can care less about every little "fix" and I'd prefer having a package that was done right the first time. I'm in no rush to get the newest silly thing
2009-10-26T03:32:00.000Z	Billiard	ariqz	just dont run the updates then
2009-10-26T03:35:00.000Z	Billiard	ariqz	i hate when downloads make me lose poker tournaments
