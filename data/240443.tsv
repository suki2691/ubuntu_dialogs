2009-07-13T07:58:00.000Z	nickrud	shazbotmcnasty	are you certain you don't have any other apt program running? synaptic, aptitude, etc?
2009-07-13T07:59:00.000Z	nickrud	shazbotmcnasty	only one app can access the package management system at a time, that's what the lock file is fore
2009-07-13T08:00:00.000Z	nickrud	shazbotmcnasty	ok, make sure no other package manager is running
