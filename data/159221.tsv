2006-11-26T16:00:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	DjViper	if you exit with it running, it should just restart at next login, it's the 'sessions' options that govern that
2006-11-26T16:00:00.000Z	DjViper	Kingsqueak	okay
2006-11-26T16:01:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	DjViper	of course you have to tell gaim to auto login when started as well, in gaim's options
