2008-04-30T11:07:00.000Z	Mathman	alienseer23	well, you can do a "chattr +i" to a file or directory (I think on the directory part, never tried it to be honest), and then it's basically stuck like it is until you do a "chattr -i" on it.  but this is a wild guess mind you.  lsattr would tell you if the immutable bit is set at any rate
