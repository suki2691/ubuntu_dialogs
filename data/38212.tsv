2010-01-28T08:33:00.000Z	scotty^	ouyes	- fglrx Catalyst will work with 9.10 if you use the specially-provided (by ATI) prerelease version included with 9.10.  It should also work as of Catalyst 10.1, released yesterday.
2010-01-28T08:36:00.000Z	ouyes	scotty^	but my kernel is 2.6.31-14-generic, so what suggestion do you have ?
2010-01-28T08:48:00.000Z	scotty^	ouyes	- If your kernel in 2.6.31-14-generic the first thing you should do is run Update Manager from the System menu.
