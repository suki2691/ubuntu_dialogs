2006-12-09T10:54:00.000Z	gephalt		Hi, folks. I was able to successfully setup the twin view on an old nvidia card. problem is, when I want to watch some movie on the TV screen, half of it is on the tv screen (in full screen mode) and the other half on my monitor.
2006-12-09T10:54:00.000Z	gephalt		Is this what twin-view is supposed to be?
2006-12-09T10:54:00.000Z	wasabi	gephalt	You probably need to set up twinview so it uses xinerama
2006-12-09T10:55:00.000Z	gephalt	wasabi	how do i do that? don't i need to seperate graphics card to use xinerama (as I understand it) in the first place?
