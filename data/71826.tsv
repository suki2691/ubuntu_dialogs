2008-12-22T01:45:00.000Z	tillux1	eseven73	yes, there is, sadly I can't remember how that was to achieve ^^
2008-12-22T01:46:00.000Z	tillux1		does anyone know if it's possible to tell nautilus to open new tabs instead of new windows?
2008-12-22T01:46:00.000Z	eseven73	tillux1	maybe aptoncd? but i dont think that actually has the full size packages
