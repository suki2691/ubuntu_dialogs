2009-08-07T13:27:00.000Z	Kepc		Can anyone help me? I'm having trouble accessing my files after someone told me to do 'sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda2'. Everything looks garbled now..
2009-08-07T13:28:00.000Z	Kepc		I was told ubuntu was secure.. it's kinda upsetting that I can wipe my system with one command
2009-08-07T13:29:00.000Z	ox	Kepc	well u did sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda2 so you do that
2009-08-07T13:30:00.000Z	Kepc	ox	only because someone in here told me to do it earlier
