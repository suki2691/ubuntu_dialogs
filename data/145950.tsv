2007-02-13T07:16:00.000Z	Rees2		can anyone tell me why I can sudo but not login as root?
2007-02-13T07:17:00.000Z	HymnToLife	Rees2	they don't
2007-02-13T07:18:00.000Z	Rees2	HymnToLife	so I guess I have to root my system?  or can I sudo and change the root password?
2007-02-13T07:19:00.000Z	HymnToLife	Rees2	you can set a root password if you want to
