2009-03-31T22:36:00.000Z	cabrilo_		hello.... is there an 8.10 installer ISO with all the latest updates? I'd like to take the disc to a friend on a slow connection, so I don't want 300mb (or whatever) of updates waiting after the installation
2009-03-31T22:38:00.000Z	cabrilo_		also, can Ubuntu's stock 32 bit kernel read 4gb ram?
