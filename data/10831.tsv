2011-09-15T22:20:00.000Z	rbil		I have tried a number of Linux recommended webcams from Logitech.  Work great with Skype, but not with Googletalk Plugin.  Can anyone help me get this working? I have latest plugin.

2011-09-15T22:23:00.000Z	urlin2u	rbil	out of my area but details are very important. :D
