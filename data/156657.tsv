2007-10-28T03:36:00.000Z	Jay		I have a problem.
2007-10-28T03:38:00.000Z	Jay		I'm using Windows and trying to boot Ubuntu 7.10 on a LiveCD. It gets to the orange progress bar, but after that the screen goes totally blank. I've checked the md5sum and used the integrity check on the boot menu, but still nothing. Anyone know how to fix this?
