2010-10-12T14:38:00.000Z	Moopz	rww	I downloaded the ati drivers from their homepage and ran the .run file I downloaded. It gives me something about not recognizing the encoding
2010-10-12T14:38:00.000Z	rww	Moopz	Have you tried just using System -> Administration -> Additional Drivers instead?
2010-10-12T14:40:00.000Z	Moopz	rww	doing it atm. I'll try something.
