2012-09-15T22:40:00.000Z	TheGentleman		Me and a friend are comp sci majors, and we would like to contribute to ubuntu as developers. We've read through some of the beginner's team wiki, but are still a little lost.
2012-09-15T22:40:00.000Z	TheGentleman		And to be honest, our skills are a little lacking. So we also look forward to building up our skills while contributing to the team.
