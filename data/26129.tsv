2010-10-11T14:11:00.000Z	spikebike	maedox	ah, cool, thanks.  That fixes it.  -d finds the rc, but turning off LTS only finds the maverick release.
2010-10-11T14:12:00.000Z	maedox	spikebike	yes, the -d switch is so you can install pre-releases.
2010-10-11T14:12:00.000Z	spikebike	maedox	I figured it would still find newer release, that's fixed.  Thanks.
