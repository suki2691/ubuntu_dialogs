2009-06-28T08:52:00.000Z	Rob235		:( looks like im gonna switch over to 32bit ubuntu
2009-06-28T08:52:00.000Z	Rob235		unless someone knows how to get 32 bit crossover source code to compile and work on x86_64
2009-06-28T08:52:00.000Z	Rob235		is there really any benefit to 64 bit besides the ram issue
