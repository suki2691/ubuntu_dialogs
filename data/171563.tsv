2011-07-12T04:00:00.000Z	tiox		I am having problems with my hard line to the web. I tried deleting the old wired connections I had, then trying again, failed.
2011-07-12T04:00:00.000Z	tiox		Maybe... should I delete my wired connection and then plug my modem in? :/
2011-07-12T04:01:00.000Z	tiox		That sounds like it might work. BRB
