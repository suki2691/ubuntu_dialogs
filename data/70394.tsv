2009-05-15T02:16:00.000Z	bin10101		this might be off subject a little...but I am trying to find a C++ IDE (been using emacs/vi and terminal) for linux.  I am teaching a c++ class at the local college and they will want an IDE I am sure.  Any favorites out there?

2009-05-15T02:17:00.000Z	gordonjcp	bin10101	I use gedit for all my code editing
2009-05-15T02:20:00.000Z	bin10101	gordonjcp	me too if i am not already using vi or emacs....its been years since I used a real IDE.  These students will be complete newbs so I figure they will want code completion and in IDE debugging.  I could go with visual studio but I would rather stay to something that is linux friendly.  :)
