2012-01-17T07:34:00.000Z	Barbariandude		Hey all! I'd like to update from kernel 3.0 to 3.2 on ubuntu 11.10, due to the updated support for my gfx card and powersaving stuff. I have the patch from kernel.org which seems to be a diff file... How do I proceed in applying the patch with this file?

2012-01-17T07:36:00.000Z	Barbariandude	yabai	so basically don't patch but re-compile the entire thing?
