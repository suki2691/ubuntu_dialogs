2011-06-03T23:18:00.000Z	butch1282		thanks, second question - do you see any comatability issues with this laptop? its the cheapest i can find. http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=357138&CatId=4938

2011-06-03T23:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	butch1282	 with laptops often the 'cheapest' is not that much of a value. if you can get 2x the machine for $30 more..
