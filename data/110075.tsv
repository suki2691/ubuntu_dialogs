2011-03-16T17:54:00.000Z	ks07		Hey guys, I'm running screen with multiuser mode, and I can connect to the other users screen session fine and run commands
2011-03-16T17:55:00.000Z	ks07		But if I add -X to send a command, I get permission denied
2011-03-16T17:55:00.000Z	ks07		Is there any way to fix this?
