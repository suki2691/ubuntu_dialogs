2007-01-04T08:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	maul555	the "ati" driver is the open source one, ATI named their proprietary driver "fglrx", why they did that I have no idea :)
2007-01-04T08:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	maul555	That is strange, there is a command specifically to do it, aticonfig or something I'll ask what it is.
