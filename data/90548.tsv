2008-06-07T10:26:00.000Z	tenX	HappyHater	in what setup?
2008-06-07T10:27:00.000Z	tenX	HappyHater	vmware supports shared access on windows machines but it has been known for many security issues
2008-06-07T10:28:00.000Z	tenX	HappyHater	as far as i am concerned i'd always disable file sharing issues with the hosting machine and transfer files via any kind of networking service (ftp/scp/smb/cfs)
