2005-12-11T08:52:00.000Z	leagris	concept10	I like grip
2005-12-11T08:54:00.000Z	leagris	concept10	the best you can to evaluate, is try by yourself and make your own opinion. Il like grip because it is a gtk frontend to cmdlines. Lightweight and onvert to anythng you should need
2005-12-11T08:57:00.000Z	leagris	concept10	I launch grip, plug a CDDA, it automaticaly sart ripping, encoding to whatever I like (preferer flac) and automagically write a nice m3u playlyst with all metadata included. When finished, the CD pop out.
