2006-12-18T17:52:00.000Z	kitche	A-L-A-R-M	anacron from what I get from it's name will only run when there is a job that needs running
2006-12-18T17:53:00.000Z	A-L-A-R-M	kitche	there also many other services that are like that hotkeysetup,rsync and so on
2006-12-18T17:54:00.000Z	kitche	A-L-A-R-M	yeah rsync is a daemon used for mirroring and such
