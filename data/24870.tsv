2012-10-21T03:07:00.000Z	dante123		hi all, setting up linux pc for my daughter....I have a dlink DWL G510 and a DWL 520+ I cant remember which one gave me some issues under ubuntu before....just wondering which one I should try first (hoping that all works well)?
2012-10-21T03:08:00.000Z	dante123		they are both pci cards
2012-10-21T03:09:00.000Z	dante123		I have read that there are like three different 520+ and that I may need to do something with blacklist prism54 or something
2012-10-21T03:10:00.000Z	crimsonmane	dante123	check the compatibility charts?
