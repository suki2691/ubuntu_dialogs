2010-03-27T17:03:00.000Z	enthdegree		I have a website server. How do I not make my directory tree visible to visitors?
2010-03-27T17:03:00.000Z	enthdegree		Is it permissions?
2010-03-27T17:04:00.000Z	rastagandalf	enthdegree	you mean not letting apache list the directories?
2010-03-27T17:04:00.000Z	enthdegree	rastagandalf	Yes. For some reason I thought it was permissions, not apache.
