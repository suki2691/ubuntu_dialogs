2007-02-25T10:58:00.000Z	xeno1		hi! just installed Ubuntu (long time debian user) - is it possible to run 2.4 kernel on Ubuntu? (need it for 2.4 kernel modules that doesn't exists in 2.6). One problem - 2.4 doesn't support UFS, other - init gots killed (kernel too old). maybe there is some howto for this? I googled whole day, didn't found anything useful. Any ideas or maybe someone has practical experience?
