2009-07-24T22:10:00.000Z	losher	L1NUX1Z3R	we were talking about putting files to burn into a directory. Did I miss something?
2009-07-24T22:11:00.000Z	L1NUX1Z3R	losher	you said move, moving files from a cd
2009-07-24T22:12:00.000Z	losher	L1NUX1Z3R	oh. AceKing didn't say anything to me about the *source* being a CD...Doesn't matter much, just cp instead of mv...
