2011-04-08T23:34:00.000Z	david5345		I installed Xubuntu 10.04 on a laptop with 256 memory. I am seeing "Out of memory: kill process..... Killed process .... ". What am I doing wrong ?
2011-04-08T23:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	david5345	 you did make a swap partition?
2011-04-08T23:36:00.000Z	david5345	Dr_Willis	no. I am activating one now
2011-04-08T23:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	david5345	 thats very likely the issue.
