2008-09-11T18:39:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	Xantor	you probably need to figure out what driver is loading for the built in card, remove it and the blacklist it. that is what i did because i use an external sound card

Try "cat /proc/asound/modules" for that, and see if you can not determine which one is for the sound card you want to disable. Step two is to blacklist that driver in "/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist". Step 3 is edit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base to load the proper driver. Step 3 may not be necessary. That's the basic outline i would say
