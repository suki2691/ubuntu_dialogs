2010-03-23T05:47:00.000Z	Cial		So the Ubuntu Installer doesnt pick up my Harddrive, I did fdisk on it and it didnt show any partitions. Any clue whats wrong?
2010-03-23T05:49:00.000Z	NetScr1be	Cial	auto-partition in install or manual?
2010-03-23T05:51:00.000Z	Cial		Im not sure it just refuses to show the hard drive
2010-03-23T05:59:00.000Z	Cial	NetScr1be	i take back my last statement it isnt working on both of them because i cant see the hard drive
