2009-05-30T21:30:00.000Z	Slart	Penfold	yes.. but you can't upgrade to a 64bit version of ubuntu.. but your 64bit processor will run the 32bit version
2009-05-30T21:31:00.000Z	Penfold	Slart	that'll do, TBH. All I want is rid of the crappy VIA chipset ethernet on the current board
2009-05-30T21:32:00.000Z	Slart	Penfold	linux/ubuntu is pretty tolerant with switching hardware.. as long as you're on the same architecture.. ie you'll get problems if you try switching from ppc to x86 or similar
