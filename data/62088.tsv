2010-01-17T03:41:00.000Z	palanthas_		Is it possible to convert a hard drive from NTFS to FAT32 without losing the data? (drives are currently on winXP but I want to put the drives in my ubuntu machine)
2010-01-17T03:42:00.000Z	meganerd	palanthas_	not that I know of
2010-01-17T03:42:00.000Z	meganerd	palanthas_	Ubuntu can safely read and write ntfs anyway
2010-01-17T03:43:00.000Z	meganerd	palanthas_	I have not had problems recently
