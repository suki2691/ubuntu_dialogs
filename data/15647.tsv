2011-04-20T17:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nbubuntu1	 theres numerous gimp plugin sites and packages not in the default repos  - whatever that one does. may be another plugin can do that same
2011-04-20T17:30:00.000Z	nbubuntu1	Dr_Willis	: I know that , but it's hard to find a good plugin , do you know any plugin for gimp to fix camera shake ?
