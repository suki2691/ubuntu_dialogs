2010-02-20T03:54:00.000Z	SteveG		How can I get gcc-4.4 for Ubuntu 9.04?
2010-02-20T03:56:00.000Z	SteveG		Is 9.04 karmic?
2010-02-20T03:58:00.000Z	SteveG		I wish ubuntu would either just stick with the version numbers or the names... I can't keep both straight
2010-02-20T03:59:00.000Z	sagaci	SteveG	the names are moreso for the development cycle, numbers are for the final releases
