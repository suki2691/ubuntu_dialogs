2008-11-14T03:17:00.000Z	pyBry_		I was looking in /etc/group and it appears that although I have 30+ groups, there are no  group members listed.
2008-11-14T03:17:00.000Z	pyBry_		They are in the format: GroupName:x:ddd:
2008-11-14T03:17:00.000Z	pyBry_		There should be a list of the users in that group after the digits correct?
2008-11-14T03:19:00.000Z	jtisme	pyBry_	depends not all groups have more than one user
