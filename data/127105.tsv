2008-05-04T10:49:00.000Z	switchcat		Q: I'm having audio problems with playing back an .avi since upgrading to hardy... it's like it's being repeatedly inturrupted and skipping back on itself, I'm not sure how to describe it.
2008-05-04T10:50:00.000Z	switchcat		Any suggestions? is this a common problem?
2008-05-04T10:50:00.000Z	vocx	switchcat	what program are you using to watch the file? Use a different program.
2008-05-04T10:52:00.000Z	switchcat	vocx	- I've already tried a few different programs, gxine, vlc, etc. etc.
