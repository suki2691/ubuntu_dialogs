2006-06-21T15:00:00.000Z	bit_doidao		hello all! im having troubles with using skype with amarok, or listen opened. I found some hijack_dsp_skype stuf, but i don't know how to compile or use it. Can anyone help-me?

2006-06-21T15:02:00.000Z	bit_doidao	JeevesBond	i think is this. Skype use the old oss, and dominate the sound card....
