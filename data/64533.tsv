2011-01-22T12:37:00.000Z	HelpMeSamba		Hello everyone, I had a working samba setup until this afternoon, I changed my computer name and now I'm unable to connect to my samba shares even though I can see it on my other machines within the network. Can anyone tell me what is wrong or what can i do to fix this? I tried nmbd restart and nmbd restart and I can see my shares when i do a smbclient -L SERVERNAME

2011-01-22T12:40:00.000Z	HelpMeSamba		Ok nvm.. i fixed my samba by myself turns out the drives were not mounted. Can anyone tell me how I can set it to automount my external harddisks?
