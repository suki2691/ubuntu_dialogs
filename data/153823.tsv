2007-04-21T11:23:00.000Z	TokenBad		on the wiki page for installing the nvidia drivers should I follow for edgy or what...since I have the new ubuntu released just the other day

2007-04-21T11:24:00.000Z	TokenBad	vox754	taking a guess can be bad...since it can mess stuff up...I was told to go to that page...but since its for edgy...and not for the new one...
