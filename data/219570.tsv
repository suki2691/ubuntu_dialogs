2008-02-27T01:40:00.000Z	hw00djohn		Hey, i need help getting my buddies wireless card to work. It's on the supported cards list and it says it should work 'out of the box', however, his computer does not show any wireless networks.  I would appreciate some help as this is the 3rd day i've been looking for support on this
