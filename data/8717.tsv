2011-10-15T16:14:00.000Z	Stefanoz		Hi guys! I have a strange issue! While logged in with my ubuntu my internet is too slow. I am supposed to be synchronized at 9050 kbps but it's getting only 1004 or so... when logged in on windows this does not happen!!!  Any idea ?
2011-10-15T16:14:00.000Z	dutt	Stefanoz	I had the same problem, it just went away after a while...weird.
2011-10-15T16:15:00.000Z	Stefanoz	dutt	I was thinking the same thing and I was assuming that I would dissappear with the upgrading.. but it did no
2011-10-15T16:15:00.000Z	Stefanoz	dutt	what should I check on? any idea? did you look around about it ?
