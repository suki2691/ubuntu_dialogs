2005-05-09T09:23:00.000Z	pochi		how long does it take to aquire my copy from shippit?
2005-05-09T09:23:00.000Z	elcu	pochi	depends where you are apparently
2005-05-09T09:25:00.000Z	elcu	pochi	i've been told mine will take 10 weeks to get here in aus.  an easier way is to just burn the ISO.
2005-05-09T09:29:00.000Z	elcu	pochi	you'll almost certainly get it.  it jsut might take a while. :) i'd cut them some slack.  they're sending t for free after all.
