2008-02-17T14:46:00.000Z	jabez		need an advice here, which iso image should i download for  ntel® Core™ 2 Duo Processor T7700?
2008-02-17T14:47:00.000Z	bazhang	jabez	how much ram?
2008-02-17T14:48:00.000Z	bazhang	jabez	then the 32 bit should be ok--unless you want to use 4GB or more of ram or have heavy video compositing to do
