All of them will be coming with windows XP installed on them and one of them will be having a program put on, then im going ot take the image form that one and put it onto the other 45....the thing is liscensing....does clonezilla have a tool that lets the other 45 machines keep thier liscenses even tho they having an image of another machine slapped on them?
