2006-09-30T12:44:00.000Z	Max_-	nalioth	 I won't pay for unraring something I didn't pay for raring :P
2006-09-30T12:44:00.000Z	nalioth	Max_-	no, it's free.  unrar-nonfree is a package with non-free codecs in it.  it won't cost YOU anything
2006-09-30T12:47:00.000Z	Max_-	nalioth	okay!..  well I added dapper multiverse to my sources.list file.. and I'm actually installing unrar... will see if it does the job.. else I'll get yours
