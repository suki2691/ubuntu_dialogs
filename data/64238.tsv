2010-02-02T00:39:00.000Z	ta_		I am using evolution, and I would like to delete the files from the server that I delete on evo, but I want to keep a copy of them on server. I was wondering, what effect would the "Disable support for all POP3 extensions" have on my email account
2010-02-02T00:39:00.000Z	ta_		by files, I meant emails
2010-02-02T00:41:00.000Z	ta_		is there any repository app that can help me get my files synchronized?
