2005-02-20T10:13:00.000Z	z44k4	Dark_Kyo	What resources?  Just file shares?  NFS might be a better choice maybe?
2005-02-20T10:14:00.000Z	Dark_Kyo	z44k4	i can use NFS to perform this?
2005-02-20T10:15:00.000Z	z44k4	Dark_Kyo	I don't know if NFS or Samba is the better choice if every system is Linux.  I tend to think NFS but who knows.  Samba would be convenient if you have Windows machines that want to connect as well.
