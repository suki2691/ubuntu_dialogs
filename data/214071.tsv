2008-10-11T11:49:00.000Z	fredl		hi guys, I have a server that's running edgy but the apt repository I'm using doesn't have edgy anymore.
2008-10-11T11:49:00.000Z	fredl		what release can I easily upgrade to from edgy?
2008-10-11T11:50:00.000Z	fredl		so what's the next logical release after edgy?
2008-10-11T11:51:00.000Z	airtonix	fredl	i highly recommend clean install...distupgrade will almostsurely give you problems
