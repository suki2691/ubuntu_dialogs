2005-07-18T06:54:00.000Z	imaek		When I first installed ubuntu on this computer, it gave me a list of resolutions and asked me to check the ones that my monitor supports, and it had a few default ones checked, so I left it.  Now, I want a larger resolution (I swear, even though it says 1204x768, it's like GIANT) and I need to edit that list.  How can I do this?
