2008-07-03T14:11:00.000Z	ubunubi		fryguy: any other suggestions about looking into my boot issue? oddly, the error presents itself even when i select an older kernel from my grub menu list..and all those were working fine previously (They have the double echo issue also and the same fglrx is already installed for this kernel) hang
2008-07-03T14:12:00.000Z	ubunubi		my dmesg log doesn't show any boot errors..what log file is used after dmesg in the boot process?
2008-07-03T14:13:00.000Z	ubunubi		i love randomly rebooting a system without making any system changes then not being able to boot >.>
