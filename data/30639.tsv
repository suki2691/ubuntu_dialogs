2010-10-26T01:52:00.000Z	sympt0m		so where i see the desktop link, and a bunch of other folders?
2010-10-26T01:54:00.000Z	brontoeee	sympt0m	you can do: cd ~ to get to your home folder and then: pwd to echo that folder
2010-10-26T01:55:00.000Z	brontoeee	sympt0m	actualy: echo ~ does the trick as well
