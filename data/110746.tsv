2007-12-06T19:41:00.000Z	u_angel		why is VNC inferior to RDP? what is the fastest way to access my linux box gui.
2007-12-06T19:43:00.000Z	Ax3	u_angel	fastest way? ssh.
2007-12-06T19:46:00.000Z	u_angel	Ax3	SSh is def the way, but i can not access certain things for example: i tried to turn on the vnc-gnome server. i found no doc on how to do it via ssh
