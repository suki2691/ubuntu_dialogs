I know it was possible with earlier versions of Ubuntu, but the only help document that I found said that it won't work in 12.04 and forward because the way that hibernation works has changed.

2012-10-26T03:48:00.000Z	wols	cweagans	if you don't need it you can use a swap file. but why would you want to? a swap file is good if you need a temporary one. for a real swap space, you want a partition
