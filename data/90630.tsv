2008-06-13T04:44:00.000Z	ubunubi		Anyone having problems with Pidgin not allowing you to create new a new "buddy group" using the AIM service??
2008-06-13T04:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ubunubi	can't you just create a new group, then add people to it?
2008-06-13T04:46:00.000Z	ubunubi	IndyGunFreak	No. It lets me choose Create/Add Group...then assign a name..but the Group never appears
2008-06-13T04:48:00.000Z	ubunubi	IndyGunFreak	Even if I log into my AIM 6.0 on my WinXP Partition and add a group then relog-in using Pidgin the new group never propogates to Pidgin's list
