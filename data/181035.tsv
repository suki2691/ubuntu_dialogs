2007-12-06T22:06:00.000Z	SeanTater		I know wireless G usually does not reach 54Mbit theoretical speeds, but in between 2 wireless G  computers and a wireless g router, what practical speed should I expect?
2007-12-06T22:07:00.000Z	void^	SeanTater	both on wireless? not much, probably a little over 1mB/s
2007-12-06T22:09:00.000Z	SeanTater	void^	okay -- I'm getting about 800kB/s so I'm not too far.. *wrinkles nose
2007-12-06T22:09:00.000Z	void^	SeanTater	yeah, sounds reasonable.. wireless is really bad when you have more than one active peer on the network :)
