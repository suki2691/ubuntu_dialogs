2009-03-03T10:11:00.000Z	portablefarhan		I have a strange problem with ubuntu, and virtualbox-ose can someone assist me?
2009-03-03T10:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	portablefarhan	just say what your problem is
2009-03-03T10:14:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	portablefarhan	so the keys in the VM are messed up or on your Host?
2009-03-03T10:15:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	portablefarhan	? i've used VirtualBox to install many copies of Windows, never had that problem.  But I'd guess it's something to do with Windows not having the right keyboard selected/installed...  sorry not more help.
