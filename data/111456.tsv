I have an school assignment that i dont quite understand. =>  Find the address to i.root-servers.net. Use dig to do a recursive request against it, where you ask for the IP address to www.nvu.no. Explain the answer you get.

2011-03-06T19:44:00.000Z	hugo__		$dig $njet.norid.no nvu.no NS +norecurse but i cant seem to find the ip of nvu.no
