2012-11-02T07:52:00.000Z	trism	jetsaredim	the code is basically: mkdir /usr/share/unity/lenses.ignore/; mv /usr/share/unity/lenses/lensename/ /usr/share/unity/lenses.ignore/; and the reverse, I think uninstalling/reinstalling is nicer
2012-11-02T07:54:00.000Z	jetsaredim	trism	are the lenses all similarly named packages?
2012-11-02T07:54:00.000Z	trism	jetsaredim	most lenses are: unity-lens-lensname;
2012-11-02T07:54:00.000Z	jetsaredim	trism	kthx
