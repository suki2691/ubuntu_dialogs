2010-09-22T10:15:00.000Z	rifter		has anyone else been having trouble with this channel?  Recently I started getting bounced to #ubuntu-unregged even though I am registered and logged in, and it was working right before
2010-09-22T10:16:00.000Z	rifter		and I checked I am registered, logged in, and I still can't join the channel unless I talk to the floodbot
2010-09-22T10:16:00.000Z	Dulak	rifter	I had that happen today too, not sure what's up
2010-09-22T10:17:00.000Z	rifter	Dulak	well there was a message in the topic for #ubuntu-unregged to check https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InternetRelayChat/Registration, but help.ubuntu.com has been unreachable at least for me all day.  It is reachable now, and it does not say anything about any recent trouble.  it only gives directions for registering and logging in, which I had already followed
