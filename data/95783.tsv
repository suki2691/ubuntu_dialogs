2008-08-16T15:26:00.000Z	tomoyuki28jp		When I try to use IRC client on Emacs, I got this error'*** No identd (auth) response'.  This means I have to install identd on my ubuntu??
2008-08-16T15:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tomoyuki28jp	 identd is normally not needed for most irc servers.  thats proberly just a warning.
2008-08-16T15:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tomoyuki28jp	 some servers might want one.. but ive not seen any in ages that  did.
2008-08-16T15:28:00.000Z	tomoyuki28jp	Dr_willis	I see, thanks for the info!
