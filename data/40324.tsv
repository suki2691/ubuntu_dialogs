2010-01-06T00:19:00.000Z	Sabre-night	mkanyicy	alright, and i know i have a few, but i know the onse getting repeated in shuffle don't have a redunancy
2010-01-06T00:20:00.000Z	mkanyicy	Sabre-night	audacious and amarok then, anyway if you have about 20000+ songs, you don't want to hear you fave song playing again only after 6 weeks, do you?
2010-01-06T00:21:00.000Z	Sabre-night	mkanyicy	nore like 200, but yeah
