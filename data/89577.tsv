2008-06-20T03:32:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder		Help me! I have the Firewire PCMCIA card plugged into the laptop and the camera is plugged in and switched on. When I look at Kino Preferences under the IEEE 1394 tab, it says "The IEEE 1394 Subsystem is not responding. The raw1394 module must be loaded, and you must have read and write access to /dev/raw1394" - What do I need to do?
2008-06-20T03:32:00.000Z	BCM43	CorpseFeeder	open with sudo
2008-06-20T03:36:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	BCM43	ok, now the error is gone and instead the IEEE 1394 tab is empty. No devices are listed.
2008-06-20T03:37:00.000Z	BCM43	CorpseFeeder	im not sure about that. You need to be root to opearte IEEE 1394 on ubuntu though
