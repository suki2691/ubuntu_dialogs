2007-03-30T15:23:00.000Z	MrPotbut		Could someone please send me the command to run in terminal that will autodectect my monitor in edgy eft? I have changed monitors since installing ubuntu and now I only get 800 X 600.
2007-03-30T15:23:00.000Z	dyrne	MrPotbut	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-03-30T15:25:00.000Z	MrPotbut	dyrne	will i need to reinstall the nvidia drivers? or will this only autodetect the monitor?
2007-03-30T15:25:00.000Z	dyrne	MrPotbut	if the nvidia drivers are installed just select them in the reconfigure it should be fine
