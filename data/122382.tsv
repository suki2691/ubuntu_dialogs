2007-09-08T06:31:00.000Z	tatters		decided to switch my home network over fully, to ubuntu linux,there will be no window boxes on my network nor in the future, and wondering about which is best NFS or Samba
2007-09-08T06:32:00.000Z	dappermuis	tatters	if you're just going to have linux boxes then I'd go with nfs
2007-09-08T06:32:00.000Z	tatters	dappermuis	yup just linux
2007-09-08T06:33:00.000Z	dappermuis	tatters	then go for nfs
