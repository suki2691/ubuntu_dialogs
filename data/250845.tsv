2007-02-02T16:19:00.000Z	lecrucious		is there another tool i can use? using parted is not working except for ext2. using fdisk only allows me to do "windows" type fs. cfdisk is ok but the fs type in it says only linux. i think gparted is the graphical tool in gnome. this server does not have a gui installed
2007-02-02T16:20:00.000Z	lecrucious		what ever happened to partman i've read about?
2007-02-02T16:20:00.000Z	Quarupt	lecrucious	have you tried gpartd?
2007-02-02T16:21:00.000Z	Quarupt	lecrucious	its just a gui for partd so it still will not work, and yes you need X
