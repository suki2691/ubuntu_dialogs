2010-02-08T19:25:00.000Z	evantandersen		i wrote a script for my auth, and it returns a 1 or a 0 correctly when I execute it manually, however when I go to use sudo, the script is ignored and access is granted instantly

2010-02-08T19:28:00.000Z	evantandersen	drellok	i posted it on the forums.... no one replied. Look here for more info: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1401277
