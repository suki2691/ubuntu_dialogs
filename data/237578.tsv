2007-04-14T09:24:00.000Z	firefly2442	tupa	I would wait for Fiesty
2007-04-14T09:28:00.000Z	firefly2442	tupa	fiesty will be a good combination of stability and recent packages
2007-04-14T09:30:00.000Z	firefly2442	tupa	no Edgy is current, fiesty is (testing) but will be released as the current stable next week
