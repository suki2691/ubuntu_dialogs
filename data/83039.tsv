2008-08-24T07:22:00.000Z	BeepII		OK, I'm trying to back up some CDs in case they break or something (it's happened to me... not pretty)
2008-08-24T07:22:00.000Z	BeepII		Is there a way to just copy the .iso?
2008-08-24T07:22:00.000Z	BeepII		and burn it to a CD?
2008-08-24T07:23:00.000Z	carandraug	BeepII	just right click in the iso and select burn to disc
