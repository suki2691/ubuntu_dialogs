2007-10-14T08:03:00.000Z	EnsGabe		Does apt/synaptic/adept/dpkg keep track of from where a package was installed?
2007-10-14T08:03:00.000Z	EnsGabe		I've installed 3rd-party packages in the past, and I want to find out if they've persisted across upgrades
2007-10-14T08:04:00.000Z	heguru	EnsGabe	3rd party packages persist (alteast most of them)
2007-10-14T08:06:00.000Z	EnsGabe	heguru	I know they default to persisting- I've got opera going from my feisty install here on my gutsy beta.  What I'm trying to find out is if packages that weren't in the repositories in the past have been replaced by ones that are there now
