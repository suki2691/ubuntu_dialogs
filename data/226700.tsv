2006-04-08T11:23:00.000Z	redguy		can anyone tell me what sets my eth0 to 169.254.0.0 network even though I have a eth0 inet static section in my /etc/network/interfaces?
2006-04-08T11:25:00.000Z	anto9us	redguy	you've done ifdown and ifup ?
2006-04-08T11:25:00.000Z	redguy	anto9us	I am thinking that something related to hotplug might be doing that
2006-04-08T11:27:00.000Z	anto9us	redguy	I don't know, have you configured in gnome?
