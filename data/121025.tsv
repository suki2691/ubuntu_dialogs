2007-09-25T16:46:00.000Z	zombie_monkey		I "completely removed" the non-free flash plugin form adobe, but I still have a ~/.macromedia directory with flash cookies
2007-09-25T16:46:00.000Z	zombie_monkey		isn't a "complete removal" supposed to get rid of everything?
2007-09-25T16:46:00.000Z	murkyMurk	zombie_monkey	you can just delete that if you want
2007-09-25T16:47:00.000Z	murkyMurk	zombie_monkey	but that .file won't do anything without the original app
