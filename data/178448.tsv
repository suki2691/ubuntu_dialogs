2006-06-27T16:02:00.000Z	tich	nickrud	ndazza: so is there any way to just remove the application without removing ubuntu-desktop?
2006-06-27T16:03:00.000Z	nickrud	tich	not easily, no. Just be sure to install ubuntu-desktop before you upgrade to edgy. Do anything you like until then :)
2006-06-27T16:04:00.000Z	tich	nickrud	okay thanks.
