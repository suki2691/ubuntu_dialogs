2006-11-09T07:20:00.000Z	Born_In_Xixax		you may be able to boot/install with the Alternate CD, but I think you will not be happy with Ubuntu performance with that little RAM, without very drastic modification
2006-11-09T07:20:00.000Z	Born_In_Xixax		i have several semi-older pc's that run fine with 128MB
2006-11-09T07:21:00.000Z	pjz	Born_In_Xixax	get more RAM; RAM's cheap, the only limit should be what the motherboard supports
