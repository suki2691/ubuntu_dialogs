2006-03-28T13:41:00.000Z	kingspwned	woland_	personally i'd rather get the images, but people say it works out nicely
2006-03-28T13:47:00.000Z	kingspwned	woland_	you almost sound "gui bitter" :)
2006-03-28T13:48:00.000Z	kingspwned	woland_	me neither. wish w3m was just a little bit better, and i'd be off
