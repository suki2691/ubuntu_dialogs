2011-04-29T00:01:00.000Z	proq		why? does unity use opengl?
2011-04-29T00:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	proq	for some effects, that's why it uses Compiz
2011-04-29T00:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	proq	however there's also already the Unity 2D version which you can get from a ppa, made with Qt what KDE uses, and that will probably be the default fall back for 11.10 instead of Gnome 2 with their Ubuntu specific changes
