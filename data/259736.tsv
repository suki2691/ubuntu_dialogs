2005-04-27T06:24:00.000Z	something_else		ok, how do you create a user for postgresql
2005-04-27T06:25:00.000Z	something_else		what i mean is, i cant seem to find the initdb command, nor can i find who the current db users are ... there probably are none
2005-04-27T06:25:00.000Z	something_else		and if that is the case, how can a user for postgresql be created?
2005-04-27T06:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	something_else	have you asked in #postgresql ?
