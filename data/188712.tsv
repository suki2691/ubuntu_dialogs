2006-05-02T10:42:00.000Z	XiXaQ	HymnToLife	think that's the one I downloaded. 5.10?
2006-05-03T08:00:00.000Z	XiXaQ	HymnToLife	I don't have another box. and I no longer have an installed operating system, cause I tried to install ubuntu yesterday and the installation crashed.. :(
2006-05-03T08:01:00.000Z	XiXaQ	HymnToLife	the ISO is correct and Nero verified the CD as being recorded correctly. Still, the installation halts everytime I try to install. I have a TV-card installed. Think I should uninstall it first?
