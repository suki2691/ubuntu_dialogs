2008-05-10T22:03:00.000Z	BluR		can I just add 8.04's repository URL to my sources.list?  If so, does anyone know that URL?
2008-05-10T22:04:00.000Z	bullgard4	BluR	This is not to be recommended. Use 'Upgrade'!
2008-05-10T22:04:00.000Z	BluR	bullgard4	by upgrade, do you mean apt-get upgrade?
2008-05-10T22:08:00.000Z	bullgard4	BluR	I mean System > Administration > Update Manager and there the button 'New version 8.04 LTS available."
