2011-01-18T02:37:00.000Z	Irreducibilis		I hope I don't offend anyone here, but I'm in the process of switching from Ubuntu to another distro, because I want to see which one I like better. My only concern is that when I overwrite Ubuntu, it will nuke GRUB and I'll be unable to boot anything (its a dual-boot system with windows).
2011-01-18T02:37:00.000Z	Irreducibilis		Fedora :/
