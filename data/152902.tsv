2007-08-30T16:28:00.000Z	theTrav		I've been watching some videos on my ubuntu box using totem video player lately, and the same files have a significant drop in quality compared to when I watch them on my windows box
2007-08-30T16:28:00.000Z	theTrav		is this likely due to codecs? and if so, how do I make them better?
