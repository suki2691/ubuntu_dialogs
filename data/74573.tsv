2009-07-06T18:27:00.000Z	dbugger		Im executing a "exec" call in PHP but I want the web to keep rendering, and the PHP web says this: "If a program is started with this function, in order for it to continue running in the background, the output of the program must be redirected to a file or another output stream. Failing to do so will cause PHP to hang until the execution of the program ends."
