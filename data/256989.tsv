2006-07-23T08:36:00.000Z	Ronz		does anyone know if the new version of wine needs to be patched for WoW?
2006-07-23T08:37:00.000Z	krism	Ronz	pretty much, yeah
2006-07-23T08:39:00.000Z	krism	Ronz	there's a prepatched .deb for 6.06 up at http://evilpen.net/wine-0.9.17_wow_i386.deb
2006-07-23T08:40:00.000Z	krism	Ronz	that deb works for me - running WoW as we speak.. depends on "libartsc0"
