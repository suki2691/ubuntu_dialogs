2009-09-22T00:49:00.000Z	mroc		i need some help mounting an encrypted partition.  i do have the encryption passphrase, i just don't know how to do this from the command line.
2009-09-22T00:50:00.000Z	Gnea	mroc	never mountd an encrypted partition, but I imagine it'd be just like mounting a regular partition and it probably just asks for the passphrase before finishing it
