2005-01-13T15:21:00.000Z	se5a		When I run the synaptic package manager I keep getting "Failed to run /usr/sbin/synaptic as user root: child terminated with 1 status
2005-01-13T15:21:00.000Z	kezz	se5a	did you change ur root pass?
2005-01-13T15:22:00.000Z	kezz	se5a	you can run it from a terminal using sudo /usr/sbin/synaptic if you changed the root pass
