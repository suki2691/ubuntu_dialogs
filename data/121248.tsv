2007-10-25T01:21:00.000Z	MrPink		Ok the thing is I installed a Ubuntu Theme... and it changed my menu bars to be dark... which made my Firefox and Thunderbird have dark writing on the top menu (so "File" and "Edit" etc.) on dark background... I was able to change this in Firefox in the UserChrome.css... does anybody know where to change this in Thunderbird?
