2008-05-04T11:17:00.000Z	Styles		Okay soo apparently I can't run Wine + Steam. I have to have WineX is this true?
2008-05-04T11:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Styles	 ive heard that steam runs fine with the normal wine
2008-05-04T11:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Styles	 check the wine forums/appdb site. there may of been some steam update recently
2008-05-05T07:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Styles	 ive instralled spyware with wine to see what it installs where. :)
