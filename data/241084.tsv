2005-05-16T09:19:00.000Z	alejandro		hmm, someone can provide a mirror? I'm using apt-setup and every mirror I select, I can't access.
2005-05-16T09:20:00.000Z	alejandro		so currently I can't update the sources or install any package.
2005-05-16T09:20:00.000Z	bpuccio	alejandro	I have an i386 binary only mirror if you'd like
