2010-01-19T23:24:00.000Z	xubunoobie		Hello!  If my ipod will not mount after installing the restricted extras package and the ipod plugin for ehaile.  Is there something I am missing or have overlooked?
2010-01-19T23:25:00.000Z	clrg	xubunoobie	Is the driver loaded? Did you reboot since you installed the new module?
2010-01-19T23:26:00.000Z	xubunoobie	clrg	 I did not reboot yet.  Do I also need ffmpeg from synaptic?  It says that ugly and bad gstreamer are installed, but not ffmpeg
2010-01-19T23:27:00.000Z	xubunoobie	clrg	 which driver?   Maybe I should reboot first if you think that will help
