2007-07-18T09:08:00.000Z	Who_	crysalys	soundjuicer is installed by default on ubuntu
2007-07-18T09:09:00.000Z	Who_	crysalys	but you might need to add tools for encoding mp3s - are you familiar with the package manager for installing software?
2007-07-18T09:09:00.000Z	Who_	crysalys	yes - if you talk to it nicely first: ubotu might have just helped you - have a look at the restricted formats page :)
