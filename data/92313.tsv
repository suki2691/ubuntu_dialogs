2008-08-22T06:07:00.000Z	gleyve	bastid_raZor	Ok, but I'd like to open text files without asking if I want do execute or show the content
2008-08-22T06:13:00.000Z	gleyve	bastid_raZor	I configured to always open with the same software(jEdit), but the problem is taht before open the file, it shows me a dialog box
2008-08-22T06:17:00.000Z	gleyve	bastid_raZor	dialog box says like this: "Do you want do show the content or run the file?"
2008-08-22T06:25:00.000Z	gleyve	bastid_raZor	that one was easy..thank you
