2010-01-06T03:10:00.000Z	osmosis		is there a way to add xubuntu to an already existing ubuntu install?
2010-01-06T03:10:00.000Z	dooglus_	osmosis	there is.  I did it.  I just installed package 'xfce4' - but you can install 'xubuntu-desktop' if you want the whole shebang
2010-01-06T03:12:00.000Z	osmosis	dooglus_	do you like it?
2010-01-06T03:12:00.000Z	dooglus_	osmosis	xubuntu?  it's my desktop of choice, yes
