2008-01-03T09:31:00.000Z	Em3raldMcSquizzy	drgeb	well, it's a wierd issue.  I just wanna make sure I know what the issue is.  Correct me if I am wrong.  You have folder A.  Folder B is inside folder A.  You are trying to MOVE folder A INTO folder B.  There lies the problem.  So, if this is true, then I must ask why you are trying to do that?
