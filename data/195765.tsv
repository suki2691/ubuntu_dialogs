2007-12-14T00:50:00.000Z	tarjei_		I need help configuring my MX518 mouse to work. I already searched for it here, but I have a problem. I am suppose to edit xorg.conf, but I can't open it. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=439300&highlight=logitech+518+mouse
2007-12-14T00:50:00.000Z	tarjei_		How do I open it?
2007-12-14T00:50:00.000Z	tarjei_		Where is it, or what do I type in the terminal?
