2010-08-11T22:08:00.000Z	EdwardL		Hello again. Trying to install Ubuntu 10.04 from a USB stick onto my computer, but 41% in it gives me an error: [Errno 5] Input/output error. I have done a memory test and it said everything was fine.
2010-08-11T22:10:00.000Z	BluesKaj	EdwardL	did you md5 sum the copy before using ?
2010-08-11T22:17:00.000Z	EdwardL	BluesKaj	Not quite understanding the md5sums. I put md5sums ubuntu.iso f:\ and I get the hash of the files on the USB stick.
2010-08-11T22:18:00.000Z	BluesKaj	EdwardL	ok that should work...just wondering if you may have bdata loss is all
