2008-05-25T21:27:00.000Z	Rioting_pacifist		 is azureus in repos old or is it a backport of the latest vuze to azureus?
2008-05-25T21:28:00.000Z	vocx	Rioting_pacifist	it is and old version I think, you can check that in the launchpad page
2008-05-25T21:30:00.000Z	vocx	Rioting_pacifist	https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/azureus  as you can see, the one in the repos in 2.5.4.0 however you can run latest tar.gz and it works okay.
2008-05-25T21:34:00.000Z	vocx	Rioting_pacifist	there is one little issue though, that current azureus 3.0.x.x uses some newer version of the SWT graphical libraries, so it spits errors sometimes, but hasn't affected me. However I haven't tried vuze, so I don't know if it'll work fine.
