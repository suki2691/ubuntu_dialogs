2008-10-11T07:48:00.000Z	Joelito		Hi all: What to do when I can't empty the trash bin, some files are still there and there's this message that says "permission denied"
2008-10-11T07:50:00.000Z	airtonix	Joelito	try this is in the terminal : locate Trash

2008-10-11T07:53:00.000Z	Joelito	airtonix	let me check
