2006-09-15T10:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ireneshusband	 you mean how to wire it to the network?
2006-09-15T10:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ireneshusband	 what is this 'other' machine running? linux? or windows?
2006-09-15T10:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ireneshusband	 you just want the samba shares accessable? nothing else?
