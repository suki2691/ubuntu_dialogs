2009-11-12T21:24:00.000Z	fernandor		Excuse me people, But How can I get Ubuntu 9.10 to recognize my FAT & FAT32 & NTFS Partitions???
2009-11-12T21:25:00.000Z	fernandor		as my friend here told my disk is a SATA disk
2009-11-12T21:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fernandor	 install/run ntfs-config for starters
2009-11-12T21:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fernandor	 on the live cd . I think i just doule clicked and it accessed my ntfs/vfat partitions as needed
