2006-09-30T12:34:00.000Z	Answer		 I have a question about starting wpa_supplicant automatically on boot.  I followed the WPAHowto on the wiki and couldn't make it work.  I tried the wpa_supplicant man page example and it didn't work.  When I run wpa_supplicant manually it is fine, so I made a script /etc/init.d/wpa_launch.sh with the right command line options and linked it to /etc/rcS.d/S42wpa_launch.sh.  This seems to start the daemon fine in the background,
