2009-06-07T06:28:00.000Z	wjs_ltop		I'm trying to install ubuntu 9.04 on my AMD Athlon64 based system, and the kernel panics every time.
2009-06-07T06:28:00.000Z	wjs_ltop		I just tried installing 8.10 and upgrading, and now the kernel is crashing
2009-06-07T06:29:00.000Z	wjs_ltop		Is this a known issue, what can I do.  I've tried kubuntu desktop/alternate and ubuntu desktop and server.
