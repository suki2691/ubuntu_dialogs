2011-01-13T02:00:00.000Z	casmo		Hello, running Ubuntu 10.10 and installed Apache, PHP and MySQL, even got the rewrite.load and stuff isntalled but mod_rewrite in Apache won't work, anyone an idea?
2011-01-13T02:01:00.000Z	WaltherFI	casmo	checked the mod_rewrite functions?
2011-01-13T02:01:00.000Z	WaltherFI	casmo	writing .htaccess is a hell
2011-01-13T02:01:00.000Z	WaltherFI	casmo	no, but the actual rewrite commands you have in for example .htaccess file
