2006-12-18T17:53:00.000Z	Flannel	Saturnus-irc	why would you want that?
2006-12-18T17:53:00.000Z	Saturnus-irc	Flannel	I'm customizing bash (ps1) and don't want the complete path.
2006-12-18T17:54:00.000Z	Flannel	Saturnus-irc	that seems... dangerous.  You could just use a regexp and strip out the previous stuff, I suppose
