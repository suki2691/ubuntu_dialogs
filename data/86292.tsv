2010-03-25T12:45:00.000Z	abhinav	jasonmchristos	rsync over ssh is good .. in addition you could try a package called unison, if you're looking for file sync

2010-03-25T12:47:00.000Z	abhinav	jasonmchristos	unison is geared more towards syncing multiple versions (and diff, etc) than backup - for backup rsync is good. and there may be some backup tools that use it (gui based)
