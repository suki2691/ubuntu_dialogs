2005-10-01T12:54:00.000Z	MikaT		Hi people. I have a D-Link DWL-650 PCMCIA WLAN card and Hoary installed on an old HP laptop. LiveCD seems to find the card but installed system not. lspci can't find the card. Could you please give some hints or links on how to proceed?

2005-10-01T13:00:00.000Z	MikaT	concept10	thanks, but I could only find instructions for a case where card was visible to lspci. I'll start searching again, but if you got the link, I'll appreciate a lot...
