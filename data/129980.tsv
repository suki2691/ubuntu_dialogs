2007-07-29T15:56:00.000Z	lor4x		hello, i need some help getting my usb-serial to work.  basically i've loaded usbserial but i don't know what block device it maps the convertor to... any help?

2007-07-29T15:57:00.000Z	lor4x	fyrestrtr	it doesn't tell me a particular device... it says address 7, configuration #1.... do you need a particular usb-serial convertor for linux or do they all work?
