2006-02-20T14:31:00.000Z	jodanlime	luisito	I tried ksmoothdock and it was kinda buggy
2006-02-20T14:33:00.000Z	luisito	jodanlime	are you using kooldock or something like it?
2006-02-20T14:33:00.000Z	jodanlime	luisito	no, I'm on gnome right now because I have dialup and it takes 8 years for me to download kde
