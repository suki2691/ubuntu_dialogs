2008-01-22T19:44:00.000Z	de_dustyciti		Hi guys, need help on cpufreq. Intel E2160 CPU, Ubuntu 6.10 with 2.6.17-10-generic kernel (shipped with ISO), cpufreq seems not working. modprobe either speedstep-centrino or acpi-cpufreq fails with "No such device". Any one has an idea? Thanks.

2008-01-22T19:47:00.000Z	de_dustyciti	Pie-rate	I just happened to have that CD so I installed it first... is there a known kernel works with E2160 / cpufreq or I'll have to apt-get upgrade ?
2008-01-22T19:48:00.000Z	Pie-rate	de_dustyciti	hmm, not sure.
