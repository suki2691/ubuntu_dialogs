2007-05-25T10:03:00.000Z	Pelo	abynt1	 yes this would be agood place but ask in the chanel
2007-05-25T10:06:00.000Z	Pelo	abynt1	 I will disagree with tehbrandon  on this,   windows prog do not run on linux but you can either linux equivalents or you can try running some progs on a compatibility layer called wine or cedega
