2005-10-22T16:27:00.000Z	dabaR	solidgroove	likely, why not use the network?
2005-10-22T16:27:00.000Z	solidgroove	dabaR	its slow right now, and I want to setup hoary as good as possible and upgrade when I get the cd
2005-10-22T16:28:00.000Z	dabaR	solidgroove	well, I am not sure what you should do. Read about apt-cdrom to learn how to add a CD as a repo to your sources.list, and then you can comment out all the others when upgrading, and that should work, afaik.
