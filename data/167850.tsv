2006-09-11T13:26:00.000Z	chinny		am a newbie - how do i find what my com1 port is under ubuntu please - trying to configure minicom
2006-09-11T13:27:00.000Z	lupine_85	chinny	it's probably /dev/ttyS0
2006-09-11T13:29:00.000Z	lupine_85	chinny	note that minicom assumes you have a modem attached and does lots of AT wierdry before you get a chance to do anything
2006-09-11T13:39:00.000Z	chinny	lupine_85	- thanks for the follow up - what AT wierdry is there? I am used to TerraTerm on XP but would prefer to use ubuntu hence am very new to this
