2007-02-23T17:51:00.000Z	Trackilizer		I ment the command that went some thing like this "dpgk -i reconfigure xserver" or something of that nature, can't quite remember it.
2007-02-23T17:53:00.000Z	Trackilizer		Whats the command to reconfigure "X" that goes something like" dpkg -i reconfigure xerver"?
