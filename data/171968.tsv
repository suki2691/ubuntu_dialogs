2006-11-26T11:06:00.000Z	m4rk		hi is there any way I can reverse the audio output in ubuntu - make the left channel come out of the right and vice-versa?
2006-11-26T11:06:00.000Z	defrysk	m4rk	switch speakers perhaps ?
2006-11-26T11:06:00.000Z	m4rk	defrysk	i meant in software
2006-11-26T11:07:00.000Z	m4rk	defrysk	i could also just face the other way but it won't really solve my problem ;)
