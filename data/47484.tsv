2012-01-26T02:52:00.000Z	Geodesical		Hello. I am wondering how to update my Ubuntu OS from Jaunty Jackalope to the newest OS.
2012-01-26T02:53:00.000Z	Geodesical		Thank You!
2012-01-26T02:54:00.000Z	Geodesical		Could I update directly from Jaunty Jackalope to Precise Pangolin or would I need a go-between?
