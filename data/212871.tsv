2006-04-14T11:38:00.000Z	stimpie		Iam trying to upgrade to dapper, now apt-get stops at xfwm4-themes
2006-04-14T11:38:00.000Z	gnomefreak	stimpie	my advice would either be dont or use the tool not the manual way
2006-04-14T11:39:00.000Z	stimpie	gnomefreak	what tool do you mean?
2006-04-14T11:58:00.000Z	stimpie	gnomefreak	my issue with upgradeing to dapper was caused by conflicting xfce4 packages.
