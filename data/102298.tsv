2009-05-30T05:02:00.000Z	matt__		Is there a way to configure how big a Gnome terminal will be when you open it?
2009-05-30T05:04:00.000Z	rww	matt__	if you're launching it from a shortcut or something, you can use gnome-terminal --geometry SIZE GOES HERE. See man gnome-terminal
2009-05-30T05:05:00.000Z	rww	matt__	actually, --geometry's explained better in the X manpage, which doesn't seem to be installed by default. See http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jaunty/en/man7/X.7.html if you want it.
