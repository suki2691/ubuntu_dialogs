2005-12-10T12:26:00.000Z	osfameron	smo	aha!  well, I did say "something like" :-)
2005-12-10T12:26:00.000Z	osfameron		I have trouble getting find and xargs stuff to work properly myself...
2005-12-10T12:27:00.000Z	osfameron	smo	tonyyarusso: how about: for file in `find | xargs`; do mv $file ${file// /_}; done
