2010-07-25T15:05:00.000Z	HarryS		Is the Ubuntu team considering switching the button sides in the next release, how it was prior to 10.04? I understand it's an easy config change, but why?
2010-07-25T15:06:00.000Z	slidinghorn	HarryS	they have plans to keep them in their current spot (on the left) as they want to put "new stuff" in the right corner...not sure what though
2010-07-26T00:51:00.000Z	slidinghorn	HarryS	what happens when you try to boot it back up?  (sorry if I'm making you repeat yourself, was greeting the pizza delivery girl)
2010-07-26T00:52:00.000Z	slidinghorn	HarryS	if you can SSH into it, try running sudo apt-get update  and then sudo apt-get upgrade
