2010-06-07T08:03:00.000Z	mobius2		does anyone know if the "prboom" version of Doom actually runs on any machine?
2010-06-07T08:03:00.000Z	mobius2		ive never seen it run once
2010-06-07T08:04:00.000Z	mobius2		more than 8 seconds that is
2010-06-07T08:04:00.000Z	R3cur51v3	mobius2	isn't Doom still closed source, or at least the data files are?
