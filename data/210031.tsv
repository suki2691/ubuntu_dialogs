2005-10-31T15:36:00.000Z	towsonu2003		another question: I am apt-getting the linux kernel image 686. Should I know anything before I do a reboot? I looked at wiki but nothing.

2005-10-31T15:37:00.000Z	towsonu2003	El_Che	I'm gonna fall in love with ubuntu if this works :) not compiling kernel? wow ;)
