2006-06-23T05:55:00.000Z	finalbeta_		I installed gmailfs thru synaptic, and now I have no idea where it placed stuff and how to use it. little help here.
2006-06-23T05:56:00.000Z	cwillu	finalbeta_	try 'man gmailfs'
2006-06-23T06:03:00.000Z	cwillu	finalbeta_	on windows you can also fix it by turning down hardware acceleration one notch;  probably a similar idea on linux
2006-06-25T05:43:00.000Z	cwillu	finalbeta_	client or frontend?
