2006-07-07T16:51:00.000Z	jonah1980		i've just got amd64 and i installed amd64 ubuntu, i think if it's there we should use it but i've had a lot of trouble with not having things that were available on my old 32bit ubuntu - eg google earth installs fine but looks a mess and scribus was on 1.3.3.2 on 32bit but now i've got 1.2 which is a huge feature downgrade and i can't open old files up i used to use!
2006-07-07T16:52:00.000Z	mauper	jonah1980	just stay tuned, the 32bit bit systems will vanish over time ;)
2006-07-07T16:53:00.000Z	jonah1980	mauper	do you think it'll take a long time or will a lot of 32bit packages become available quite soon?
2006-07-07T16:54:00.000Z	mauper	jonah1980	who the hell am I to know ... but ... I think: quite soon :)
