2010-02-11T21:48:00.000Z	probonono		Does a default install support smp even if installed on a single-core system? (Will modifying a VM running an ubuntu guest from 1 -> 2 cpus cause problems?)
2010-02-11T21:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	probonono	it should not cause problems
2010-02-11T22:10:00.000Z	probonono	erUSUL	are you saying that from experience? Or you think a default install is smp-ready? Or wild guess? ;)
2010-02-11T23:01:00.000Z	probonono	erUSUL	thanks for the response, I'll give it a go next time the VM gets restarted.
