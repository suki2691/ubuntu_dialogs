2007-07-08T09:12:00.000Z	michelecs		Hi, I'm trying to force a python program to run with python2.4, but it still tries to load python2.5 libraries. What should I do?

2007-07-08T09:14:00.000Z	michelecs	strushb	do you any suggest about the env var I should look at?
2007-07-08T09:16:00.000Z	strushb	michelecs	nope
