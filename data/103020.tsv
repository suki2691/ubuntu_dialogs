2010-03-01T07:31:00.000Z	ricree		is there an easy way to install a package from a repository from an older release of Ubuntu?  A program I'm using seems to have a bug that was introduced in the Jaunty binary, but is supposedly working in the Intrepid one

2010-03-01T07:34:00.000Z	histo	ricree	you can try the older packge if you want but I would build from source.
2010-03-01T07:34:00.000Z	histo	ricree	what program is it?
