2007-01-27T08:20:00.000Z	IdleOne	trymmi	you need the codecs right? try !codecs or /msg ubotu codecs
2007-01-27T08:21:00.000Z	trymmi		idleone: What do you mean? I'm not good with irc
2007-01-27T08:22:00.000Z	IdleOne	trymmi	type /msg ubotu codecs it will open a private chat with ubotu and it will give you the info for installing the codecs you probably need
