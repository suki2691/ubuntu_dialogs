2007-02-16T12:44:00.000Z	lorderunion		hi. i've got a weird problem with kde and gnome. i set kde as my default window manager/desktop environment, so when my computer boots up, it shows the Kubuntu screen
2007-02-16T12:44:00.000Z	lorderunion		i log in and then it loads gnome instead.
2007-02-16T12:44:00.000Z	lorderunion		any dieas?
