2007-12-30T19:09:00.000Z	Stormx2	rexy	It doesn't. It points to /var/www, in which there is a redirect to apache2-default
2007-12-30T19:09:00.000Z	rexy	Stormx2	ah, missed that then overwritung that works
2007-12-30T19:10:00.000Z	Stormx2	rexy	its worth symlinking /var/www to a directory in your home folder. That's what I do
