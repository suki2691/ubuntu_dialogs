2006-12-27T10:12:00.000Z	jpjacobs	plagerism	don't think it's possible, since loading another kernel requires you to reboot
2006-12-27T10:14:00.000Z	jpjacobs	plagerism	you can use qemu -cdrom /dev/cdrom -hda /dev/<the hd> but i don't know wheter hardware detection will be right
2006-12-27T10:15:00.000Z	plagerism	jpjacobs	I basically want to have this system of Ubuntu I am currently running, however I want lvm up and running
