2007-05-27T05:17:00.000Z	Cocofat		can anyone help me with an installing problem, I have installed ubuntu in virtual machine fine, but when i do a normal install i have to disable acpi in bios for it to work, it installed ok, then i goto login and it logs in ok, but the ubuntu splash screen just stays there with a grey box in the top left of the screen? and i have to turn acpi back on to get into windoze
