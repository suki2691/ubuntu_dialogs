2010-05-12T05:25:00.000Z	alket	hawkrives	I don't want to be rude but I don't like KDE at all, maybe I should just stick with Transmission
2010-05-12T05:26:00.000Z	hawkrives	alket	That is what I am using now. Unless you dont like Transmission, in which case there are probably 4-5 other GNOME torrent apps int the Sofware Center.
