2010-05-31T20:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dewente	 clarify. Youmean you want to 'boot' straight to windows by default from the grub menu?
2010-05-31T20:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dewente	 the 'startupmanager' program gives you a gui to select the default grub item. Or theres other ways to select the default
2010-05-31T20:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dewente	 check out the grub2 docs/factoids/wiki page and forum posts i recall seeing it covered there.. but i just use the gui tool
