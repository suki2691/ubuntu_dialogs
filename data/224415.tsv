2006-04-19T05:50:00.000Z	joesmith		any ideas on how to set up a secondary gateway for internet traffic (i have two isps and two routers). i'm afraid it is easy in windows because they have a default gateway and you can just add others in a list. I suspect it can be done with the route command, but have not figured out the right parameters to not confuse network traffic
