2009-02-19T10:44:00.000Z	TiZ		Hi. I'm trying to extract from an archive, and I get the following error box. "An error occured while trying to extract the archive. (null)" What does this (null) bit mean, and how do I fix it?
2009-02-19T10:46:00.000Z	chaines	TiZ	one more piece of advice before I kick it: Try using another archive manager than the default one. It seems to be... problematic. PeaZip has been recommended. Google it :)
2009-02-19T10:47:00.000Z	chaines		peace out all.
