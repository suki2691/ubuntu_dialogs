2008-05-16T18:34:00.000Z	eViking		i'm trying to learn about servers... Have installed 8.04 (server) + LAMP + xubuntu-desktop + webmin. Could anyone hint on how to be able to FTP into var/www ? When typing 192.168.1.8 in Firefox the index.html opens, but I do not understand how upload files to the directory...

2008-05-16T18:36:00.000Z	eViking	bazhang	thx for answering! have not seen the u perfect server series ?? Probably too early/lazy of me to aske here. Just eager to get a web server for testing scripts etc.
