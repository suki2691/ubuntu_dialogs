2007-04-11T15:01:00.000Z	greenman		Got another one for ya.  I just apt-gat bittornado, I can't seem to run it though...
2007-04-11T15:02:00.000Z	[domserver] 	greenman	you are doing apt-gat not apt-get
2007-04-11T15:03:00.000Z	[domserver] 	greenman	is APT-GET not APT-GAT
2007-04-11T15:04:00.000Z	[domserver] 	greenman	ensure the repository list is updated
