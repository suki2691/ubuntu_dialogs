2011-02-04T16:14:00.000Z	madsailor		hello, I'm making some new plymouth themes.  What is the best way to take a screenshot/video of them so people can tell what they are like before installing?
2011-02-04T16:15:00.000Z	bonjoyee	madsailor	run them in a VM and get screenshots/videos!:)
2011-02-04T16:18:00.000Z	madsailor	bonjoyee	any recommendations for a screen video capture program (rather than plain screenshots)
2011-02-04T16:18:00.000Z	bonjoyee	madsailor	never used myself..but gtkrecordmydesktop, xvidcap seem good!
