2009-02-18T11:29:00.000Z	Milkeh	tritium	I have a pidgin script that doesn't work with my version of banshee but somebody made a patch for it, I just don't know how to apply it.
2009-02-18T11:29:00.000Z	tritium	Milkeh	patches are applied to source.  Are you recompiling it?
2009-02-18T11:31:00.000Z	Milkeh	tritium	what do you mean b recompiling it?
2009-02-18T11:31:00.000Z	tritium	Milkeh	building it from source code
