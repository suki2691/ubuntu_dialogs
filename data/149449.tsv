2012-06-18T20:38:00.000Z	Ponsjuh		Hi, Is there a way to see how long i have been logged in at X11 at a specific day.. example i login at 08.15 and logout at 18.15 are either simes being logged or can it be logged somewhere?
2012-06-18T20:40:00.000Z	Ponsjuh		or maybe it can be done via gnome.. either way i want to know when i logged in and logged out so i can calculate my active time
