2010-08-13T20:17:00.000Z	mernilio		One thing i have never been able to do, is to use the build-in network-card and soundcard. Why is that? Is it because no drivers exist for linux? I havent put so much thought in it, because i have used separat sound and network cards

2010-08-13T20:19:00.000Z	mernilio	erUSUL	maybe so.. i know linux knows about my integrated soundcard tho. It's no big deal tho.
