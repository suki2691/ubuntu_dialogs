2004-11-25T07:42:00.000Z	idiot	Falstius	unfortunately prelink seems to crash my box all the time, and others as well, but Im a free as in beer person for the most part and Yoper is going to start selling there services, and well theres alot of other reasons why im using Ubuntu
2004-11-25T07:44:00.000Z	idiot	Falstius	I may be wrong but I thought they were going to sell their distro soon, or a pro version, and they have a lot of missing packages and not as myany security or bug fixes as as Ubuntu
