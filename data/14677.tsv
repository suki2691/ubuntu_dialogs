2011-05-04T18:18:00.000Z	mosez		scenario: no vpn connected, use first 127.0.0.1 ns, if it doesnt know the record use the one from dhcp. if vpn is connected try first 127.0.0.1 and if that doesnt find a record try out the one defined by vpn

2011-05-04T18:23:00.000Z	mosez	maxb	thx for that, got to take a look at it... i hoped that i'm not the first who needs that and that there are already solutions i cant find
