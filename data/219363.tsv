2007-12-06T08:23:00.000Z	traderv		can't seem to boot ubuntu from the 7.10 desktop cd.  It says Ubuntu is intalled when I boot Windows.
2007-12-06T08:25:00.000Z	traderv		Where else can I get some help on my initial installation?
2007-12-06T08:26:00.000Z	traderv		I have the cd in the CD drive.  I boot the copmputer, but it doesn't boot from the cd.  Evidently I don't have the boot track copied properly.
