2010-05-26T17:23:00.000Z	broonsparrow	actionparsnip	yeah i did it before. Still no resolution and when I run nvidia settings again it's reverted to auto again
2010-05-26T17:23:00.000Z	broonsparrow	actionparsnip	there is a line "   Option         "metamodes" "1024x768 +0+0"" should I change that one?
2010-05-26T17:38:00.000Z	broonsparrow	actionparsnip	still no luck. it's still displaying at 1024x748 even thought I've changed the figures in the conf file. (the conf file has the correct resolution and I've restarted)
