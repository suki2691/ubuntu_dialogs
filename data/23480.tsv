2010-11-04T22:02:00.000Z	Draqul	joe2371	LTS = Long Term Support. It's a stable we're willing to support longer than other "stable" releases, like 10.10. In two years we won't answer 10.10 questions, but we will on 10.04
2010-11-04T22:04:00.000Z	Draqul	joe2371	do they need distro upgrades? Otherwise disable them and just let them have access to regular updates
