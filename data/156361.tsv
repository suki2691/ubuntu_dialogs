2009-08-17T19:13:00.000Z	genii	JACKSU	Please do not private-message me, I assist only in public channels. The package read-edid installs some utilities which query the video card and attached monitor(s). When you sun the: sudo get-edid   that pulls raw info off the video card and interrogates the monitor attached to it for what capabilities it has. Then the: | parse-edid  part filters that raw info to produce something usable in a config file.
