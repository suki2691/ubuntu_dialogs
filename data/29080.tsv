2010-08-09T23:37:00.000Z	oCean_	Synthead	the configfiles in /etc/init are part of the start/stop scripts in /etc/init.d
2010-08-09T23:38:00.000Z	Synthead	oCean_	I created a .conf file previously that works without any reference from /etc/init.d, but I can't reboot because people are working on the system
2010-08-09T23:39:00.000Z	oCean_	Synthead	yes, I did not mean that there has to be a reference...
