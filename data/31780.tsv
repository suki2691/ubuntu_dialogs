2012-08-17T06:32:00.000Z	jackdeth		I have Ubuntu 12.04 machine. Started with one user account. Added a second user account. First account has full admin privileges. I want the second to have admin rights to install, etc. but don't want that account to be able to modify or delete other accounts. How do I do this?

I was answering your precise question, but I suspect what you actual want is something different that "they can do everying except change users/groups" ... think more about what you want them to be *allowed* to do and create a rule for that only... its easier to do that than create exclusions
