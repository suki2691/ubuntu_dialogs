2007-06-07T06:30:00.000Z	dopefish		hey - I installed ndiswrapper from source back when this computer was edgy, and I'm tired of it not working every time there's a kernel update. Can someone help me - how do you install ndiswrapper the right way so it updates along with the kernel?
2007-06-07T06:30:00.000Z	keith1234	dopefish	remove it, and then apt-get install ndiswrapper
2007-06-07T06:31:00.000Z	keith1234		aboo-ood: yes?
2007-06-07T06:31:00.000Z	dopefish	keith1234	I looked in synaptic and there wasn't a package called ndiswrapper, just a bunch of support utils for it
