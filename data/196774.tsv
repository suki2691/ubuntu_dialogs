2007-08-10T06:59:00.000Z	fulhack		Hi.. My audio playback capabilities have disappeared. I haven't used this computer in a while, but I've just now noticed I can't play audio in amarok and such. The mixer volumes are O.K.. Any ideas? :\ I also can't 'cat' to /dev/dsp.. Not sure wether I should be able to when ESD is running though.
2007-08-10T07:01:00.000Z	sipior	fulhack	do you have multiple ESDs running?
2007-08-10T07:02:00.000Z	fulhack	sipior	I don't believe so.. 1 sec.
2007-08-10T07:03:00.000Z	fulhack	sipior	No, I don't.
