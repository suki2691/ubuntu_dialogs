2009-10-12T09:56:00.000Z	mezquitale	thedude42	upgrading to jaunty caused me a lot of headaches, it broke a lot of stuff, i had to downgraded to intrepid, karmic koala looks promising though

2009-10-12T09:59:00.000Z	mezquitale	thedude42	i am talking about functionality wise, every ubuntu version I have tried works off the box, everything I have learned I could apply it to the next version of ubuntu, with jaunty too many things changed but the worst part was that it just plainly didnt work, that was the worst
