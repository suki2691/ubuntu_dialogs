2007-11-19T16:54:00.000Z	saftle		I haven't been messing with ubuntu for awhile, and wanted to ask if my x1650 ati card can now support aiglx with fglrx yet? cuz I would love to have full 3D-Acceleration with beryl/compiz
2007-11-19T16:54:00.000Z	z1pp3r	saftle	you might want to ask that in #ubuntu-effects
2007-11-19T16:55:00.000Z	z1pp3r	saftle	it should forward you.... the channel is now #compiz-fusion
2007-11-19T16:56:00.000Z	z1pp3r	saftle	compiz-fusion doesnt exist, #compiz-fusion does
