2010-10-01T11:21:00.000Z	tigertv69		i want to basically know the command to transfer a folder from one server to my local server.. and do it in multipart (split files up to transfer faster)??
2010-10-01T11:22:00.000Z	Aemaeth	tigertv69	you can split the files easily using rar (read man rar), and sftp can do a command line transfer
