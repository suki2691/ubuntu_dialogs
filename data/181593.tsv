2010-08-13T18:11:00.000Z	oik		can anybody help me? I'm trying to boot ubuntu-10.04-desktop-amd64 on a dell e6400. I've seen posts on the internet which indicate people have installed it successfully, but I can't even get it to boot. I've tried optical media and usb but I just can't do it. I can boot 32 bit just fine
