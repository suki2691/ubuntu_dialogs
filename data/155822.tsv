2007-01-12T07:10:00.000Z	sara		I have a question about an ASUS laptop that I just bought (used) it runs fine under windows but overheats under ubuntu ans Suse. The overheating takes about 1/2 an hour of moderate use.. Ive tried loading lm-sensors and even setting the temp trip-points to no avail.. it simplely seems to want to overheat no matter what modules are loaded
