2008-10-14T22:31:00.000Z	Niek		I've a question .. I've 2 disks in my computer, and some partitiions on them. I want 1 partition on disk one to be the same "virtual disk" as a partition on another one. (that is becuase I bought the secondary drive today, I ran outta space) I heard something about LVM. But; is there a tutorial; and; won't I loose all my data already present @ disk1 ?
