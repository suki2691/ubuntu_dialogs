2005-07-11T10:23:00.000Z	alkuovi		I am going to install clamAV. I do not use any additional repositories (backports or marillat), does that affect to the security of the program?
2005-07-11T10:24:00.000Z	nalioth	alkuovi	the current clamav from official repos is outdated
2005-07-11T10:25:00.000Z	nalioth	alkuovi	or enable backports/marillat JUST FOR clamav
2005-07-11T10:26:00.000Z	alkuovi	nalioth	thanks for your help
