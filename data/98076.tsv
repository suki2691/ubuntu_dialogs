2008-03-09T00:14:00.000Z	qense		it's very hard to find bugs there if you're not a developer and there are less people who can contribute to the coee
2008-03-09T00:15:00.000Z	Linux_Fresher	qense	 .. erm .. ok .. i know open source where the code is given to people , closed source is that they dont code to people .. how does that matter ? i am confused
2008-03-09T00:15:00.000Z	qense	Linux_Fresher	open source means more people who can look at the code, and can find bugs
