2007-11-01T18:41:00.000Z	ta1		I woke up this morning and my HD was full.. checked Disk usage and it said there was 79gb in the beagle directory logs... so I removed all the logs and emptied the trash.. now I only have 52gb free? WTH  Any idea?

2007-11-01T18:42:00.000Z	ta1	r3m0t	sure but any idea why it would say there is 79gb of data and only free up 52?
