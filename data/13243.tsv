Now I have problems setting up a Brother MFC990CW Printer/Scanner/Copier/Fax.  Looked through the forums.  No joy.  Downloaded the driver from Brother support, followed their instructions.  No joy.  The driver was installed from a Terminal.  Didn't work.  Installed it with Synaptic.  No joy.  Installed it with gdebi.  No joy.
