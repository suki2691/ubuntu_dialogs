2011-08-14T13:50:00.000Z	desss	milamber	how can I create one? or well, generate one?
2011-08-14T13:50:00.000Z	milamber	desss	in any text editor, for example: sudo nano xorg.conf (then add whatever you need to the file ~ lots of examples available via internets)
2011-08-14T13:51:00.000Z	milamber	desss	and have you checked to see if the extern is linux compatible? are there drivers?
