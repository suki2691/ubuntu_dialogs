2010-07-17T15:40:00.000Z	masteroffire		I have some problem getting an ATI Radeon X1600 to work... System is 10.04, Updates are installed. I also installed xserver-xorg-video-radeonhd - but it seems like that it is not used. The graphics performance is very bad, even if I disable all desktop effects
2010-07-17T15:41:00.000Z	masteroffire		I also can't switch the drivers because there is no xorg.conf present
2010-07-17T15:41:00.000Z	bloopletech	masteroffire	have you checked the X wiki to make sure the open source drivers support your card?
2010-07-17T15:43:00.000Z	bloopletech	masteroffire	sorry, can't help you - I use fglrx
