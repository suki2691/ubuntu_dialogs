2008-07-03T14:07:00.000Z	proximas		I have a boot problem too. I installed Ubuntu on a external USB harddrive and the main HD has XP on it. But when i boot the computer without the external HD, XP does not boot
2008-07-03T14:08:00.000Z	proximas		i dont actually know fryguy. I think i probably installed grub on the external HD

2008-07-03T14:09:00.000Z	Bert_2	proximas	there are some guids for that on the ubuntu forums, the best way is to restore the XP bootloader and then edit the boot.ini file, just search on ubuntuforums.org
