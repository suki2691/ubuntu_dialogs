2007-07-16T16:15:00.000Z	saxonjf		I looked "ubuntu-desktop" up and I think that is almost the last thing I'd ever want to uninstall
2007-07-16T09:47:00.000Z	saxonjf		I installed pidgen, and I want to get rid of Gaim via synaptic, it tells me I have to remove "ubuntu-desktop."  Is there a workaround?
