2007-12-05T09:23:00.000Z	treitter	kelsin	brasero is based on nautilus-cd-burner, I believe. But I'll check out gnome-baker. Thanks!
2007-12-05T09:57:00.000Z	treitter	kelsin	have you used GnomeBaker?
2007-12-05T09:58:00.000Z	treitter	kelsin	it seems fine except that it won't let me burn directory structures greater than 6 dirs deep (even if I only select "Rock Ridge" as the filesystem; it still ends up passing "-iso-level 3", which doesn't support deep trees)
