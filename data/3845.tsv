2012-10-18T21:44:00.000Z	Jhonen		i just installed 12.10. what a complete mess
2012-10-18T21:45:00.000Z	Jhonen		compared to 12.04 - That version could at least handle my nvidia card
2012-10-18T21:46:00.000Z	Jhonen		if i press dash, the whole screen goes blurry and then freezes
2012-10-18T21:46:00.000Z	nik90	Jhonen	the graphics card problem and performance fixed will be the focus of attention for 13.04..so that should not be a long time issue
