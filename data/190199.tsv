2006-06-30T14:31:00.000Z	CrashProne		I heard that getting the Ubuntu version of wine just doesn't run as well as getting it off the official site.. is that still true in Dapper?
2006-06-30T14:32:00.000Z	Warbo	CrashProne	The WINEHQ one will always be newer, so maybe have the best features quicker, but I find that there are a few conflicts with Dapper packages (a few libs)
2006-06-30T14:41:00.000Z	CrashProne	Warbo	well, I installed WineHQ's significantly newer looking package from their repos.. no evident conflict (yay) hopefully my installer will work now. :-P
2006-06-30T14:42:00.000Z	Warbo	CrashProne	I think libmjpeg was the main problem I had (though I don't know why WineHQ has it, or why I have it :))
