2007-04-03T10:19:00.000Z	toferrado		I did install the j2re1.4-mozilla-plugin package using sudo apt-get install j2re1.4-mozilla-plugin command... how do I full uninstall it?
2007-04-03T10:21:00.000Z	PhirePhly	toferrado	you can also run "man apt-get
2007-04-03T10:21:00.000Z	toferrado	PhirePhly	I did use sudo apt-get remove but it (java) still works :/
2007-04-03T10:22:00.000Z	PhirePhly	toferrado	the next thing I would do is search for java in synaptic and see what you still have installed
