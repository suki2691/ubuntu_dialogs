2008-08-10T01:04:00.000Z	aliby		I'm using an ALSA setup with a 5.1 speaker system. Every channel except my front right works. Anyone have any idea how to fix this?
2008-08-10T01:05:00.000Z	Grobvok	aliby	type alsamixer in a terminal and set everything on high.
2008-08-10T01:06:00.000Z	Grobvok	aliby	Or as high as you want.
2008-08-10T01:06:00.000Z	aliby	Grobvok	everything is on high currently and still no sound
