2010-01-07T08:24:00.000Z	Cool_Cat		I have a very quick question for anyone who knows anything about bash scripting, how does one define a varible during the time of exicution. For example: sh ./myscript.sh VARIBLE! VARIBLE2
2010-01-07T08:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Cool_Cat	 check the advanced bash scripting guide - it has chapters on 'arguments'
2010-01-07T08:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Cool_Cat	 i cant rember the exact syntax but its somthing like $1 $2 and $3 become the valiues
2010-01-07T08:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Cool_Cat	 watch out for spacwes in arguments
