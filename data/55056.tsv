2009-07-15T03:41:00.000Z	v1d4l0k4		People, I'm trying to extract an damaged ISO (legible, but some files are truncated) without success... File-Roller dies with "isoinfo: Short read on old image" error message. There's any other way to extract non-damaged files ignoring these errors?
2009-07-15T03:41:00.000Z	edbian	v1d4l0k4	Did you try mounting it?
2009-07-15T03:42:00.000Z	v1d4l0k4	edbian	yeap, it mounts with no problem
2009-07-15T03:43:00.000Z	edbian	v1d4l0k4	Then why do you need to un-pack it?  You have access through mounting yes?
