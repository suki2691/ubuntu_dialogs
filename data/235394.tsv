2012-06-08T07:49:00.000Z	MooreJohn		Hi Dr_Willis, I am new to linux ubutu, what you mean "from the source dir"
2012-06-08T07:50:00.000Z	MooreJohn		I uncompress the source code in "Desktop" and I made "./configure", "make" and "make install"
2012-06-08T07:51:00.000Z	Madpilot	MooreJohn	you do know Apache is available in Ubuntu repos, right?
