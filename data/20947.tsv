2012-03-08T21:17:00.000Z	linuxfreaker		I have a brand new CentOS 6 server that I need Asterisk setup on.  it should receive calls on a SIP account, play a audio message that prompts a user to press numbers 1,2,3 or 4 and depending on what number the call should be connected to a phone number over a SIP account,
2012-03-08T21:18:00.000Z	linuxfreaker		Customer Calls  [obscured]   (SIP account) Asterisk picks up the call Asterisk plays the user the prompt message audio file. Customer presses the number 3. Asterisk dials  [obscured]   on the SIP account. Asterisk immediately connects the two calls.  At the moment regardless if the customer presses the number 1,2,3 or 4 it will go to the same number, however later on this may change
