2011-08-03T05:57:00.000Z	clowerweb	graft	or you could virtualbox windows and use illustrator :P
2011-08-03T05:59:00.000Z	graft	clowerweb	yeah, that's something i'd rather avoid
2011-08-03T05:59:00.000Z	clowerweb	graft	me too, unfortunately i have to use Photoshop for work, but i just run windows 7 in virtualbox with PS, works quite well
