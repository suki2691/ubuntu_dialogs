2007-08-06T10:40:00.000Z	dxdt	yaman	if the card supports the command -- sudoiwconfing wlan0 mode monitor  otherwise programs like airmon can aide in setting it into monitor mode.  Some cards don't support it, but I think most do these days.
2007-08-06T10:44:00.000Z	yaman	dxdt	: it's not working as i don't have the (mode monitor thing)
