2012-02-27T05:12:00.000Z	__machine		how risky is an upgrade from 8.04 lts to 10.04 lts? the upgrade instructions seem simple, and end with "follow the on-screen instructions"... this is a staging server, which only has python 2.5 available when i need 2.6 ...
2012-02-27T05:12:00.000Z	CFHowlett	__machine	  just clean install ... and congrats on holding out until now.
2012-02-27T05:13:00.000Z	__machine	CFHowlett	clean install means moving across all the databases and apps that are staged there... is the upgrade process not reliable?
2012-02-27T05:14:00.000Z	CFHowlett	__machine	  I wouldn't say unreliable as it's definitely gotten better.  Just my preference as I always have a cloud backup and a dedicated /home it makes the process less - angst ridden
