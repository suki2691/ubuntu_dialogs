2012-07-10T22:49:00.000Z	ses1984		hi, i just upgraded from 11.10 to 12.04 on a machine and it will no longer boot. i get to the grub screen and if i choose the default kernel i get nothing but a blinking cursor.
2012-07-10T22:50:00.000Z	ses1984		if i choose recovery mode, i see kernel messages that stop after less than a second. it says something like "VFS Cannot open root device sda1" and then about ten more lines "kernel panic - not syncing"
2012-07-10T22:50:00.000Z	ses1984		"VFS unable to mount root file system on unknown block"
2012-07-10T22:51:00.000Z	Till19474	ses1984	try to install it again. And be sure that the GRUB is installed correctly.
