2009-01-25T14:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	tenX	a lot of the problems are caused by very old software trying to use OSS
2009-01-25T14:59:00.000Z	tenX	gordonjcp	well its working for me so far but i experienced problems with input many times. and yeah, many software runs on oss, you got many devices which never clearified to me lacking sound card/system/standards knowledge. of course i usually read things up and there are quiete a few docs. but a basic understanding of how things work together has never been reached from my point.
