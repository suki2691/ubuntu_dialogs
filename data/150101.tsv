2011-10-13T21:05:00.000Z	aaabbbccc		hello everyone
2011-10-13T21:06:00.000Z	aaabbbccc		probably bad timing considering the new release, but I have a question about mail-stack-delivery
2011-10-13T21:07:00.000Z	aaabbbccc		01-mail-stack-delivery.auth is not loaded after a recent update (i was using 11.10 beta)
2011-10-13T21:07:00.000Z	Pici	aaabbbccc	#ubuntu-server is quieter and probably more on-topic for your question...
