2006-10-14T13:28:00.000Z	R3linquish3r		I'm having trouble getting Teamspeak to run on x64 Edgy. Can anyone help?
2006-10-14T13:29:00.000Z	train2	R3linquish3r	runs here... probably just missing some 32-bit libs
2006-10-14T13:30:00.000Z	train2	R3linquish3r	try ldd ./Teamspeak and see what it's missing
2006-10-14T13:31:00.000Z	R3linquish3r	train2	the install i downloaded is missing the setup.sh file its suposed to have. at least i have it in 32
