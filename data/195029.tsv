2008-04-06T05:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	bogdement	yup
2008-04-06T05:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	bogdement	so you're getting rid of Ubuntu... and you wan't to use the empty space for windows.. I suggest joining ##windows and ask there since you'll be using windows tools.  If grub is still installed they can help reinstall the win MBR
