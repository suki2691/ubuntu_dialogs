2009-01-04T11:05:00.000Z	rdvade		Hello, Can someone explain to me what exactly exempts Ubuntu from being a completely free distro (in the eyes of the FSF). I'm Having a discussion about this issue and I'm struggling to find a solid answer on exactly which parts are non-free (on a clean install). I thought it was the trademarks or perhaps how Ubuntu facilitates the use of non free software - but I feel I'm missing something.
