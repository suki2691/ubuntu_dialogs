2010-04-19T15:42:00.000Z	nexsja		i have about 5 or more kernels listed in my grub, i'd just like to remove them
2010-04-19T15:43:00.000Z	zvacet	nexsja	 from synaptic type linux-image in search box and remove kernel qwith lower number
2010-04-19T15:43:00.000Z	zvacet	nexsja	 keep two kernels just in case that latest doesn't work properly
