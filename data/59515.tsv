2009-04-24T19:07:00.000Z	IHS_intern	Munich42	It's changing the volume of the wrong thing. There's several "devices" or outputs, some of which don't actually exist...
2009-04-24T19:09:00.000Z	Munich42	IHS_intern	yes, i think so to. but how can i change the device wich volume is controlled by my keypoard buttons
2009-04-24T19:10:00.000Z	IHS_intern	Munich42	is the icon in the system tray bit working when you change that?
