2008-04-15T01:13:00.000Z	_Rambaldi_		what was that for Slart
2008-04-15T01:13:00.000Z	Slart	_Rambaldi_	there must be some kind of error message?
2008-04-15T01:14:00.000Z	Slart	_Rambaldi_	I just meant that "doesn't work" isn't really a good description.. are there error messages in syslog? do you get any output in the terminal? does the computer reboot?
