2008-07-12T05:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	Matthew12	 in the past ive copied problem dvd's to iso files, or used k9copy to copy them to iso. or ripped/converted them to avi. :)  a bit extreme.. but its worked for me befor
2008-07-12T05:19:00.000Z	Matthew12	Dr_Willis_	would you suggest K9copy as the program of choice?
2008-07-12T05:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	Matthew12	 ive been using it with very good results the last few months.
2008-07-12T05:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	Matthew12	 i like it because i can remove the silly ads/warnings/previews at the start of the disks
