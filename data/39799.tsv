2010-11-01T23:55:00.000Z	LinuxAdmin	glaucous	see anacron
2010-11-01T23:56:00.000Z	LinuxAdmin	glaucous	yes, it's like crontab
2010-11-02T00:02:00.000Z	glaucous	LinuxAdmin	yes I read up on it now. I've been using cron.weekly/daily folders before, and noticed that they ran at various times (because of computer shutdown). And it is indeed anacron which manages them, and not crontab.
