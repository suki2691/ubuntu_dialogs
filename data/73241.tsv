2008-11-29T01:41:00.000Z	malibu		Say I log in as 'testuser' and I sudo to 'root'.  Is there any way for a script running as 'root' to find my original user ID?
2008-11-29T01:42:00.000Z	DigBig	malibu	ofcourse in /var/log/... it's noted that testuser did sudo commands ...
2008-11-29T01:43:00.000Z	malibu	DigBig	Yes but I mean from a more reliable scripting standpoint.... I want to transfer xauth certificates from the user's account
2008-11-29T01:44:00.000Z	DigBig	malibu	i'm afraid i can't help with that ...
