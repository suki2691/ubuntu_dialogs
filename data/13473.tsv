2011-06-09T02:51:00.000Z	res22_		I'm trying to move my /home directory to a new partition, and reinstall ubuntu using that as home. Execpt I've just realised that my current /home is encrypted. Does anyone know if this would work?

2011-06-09T02:53:00.000Z	res22_	strata_	thanks, I'll give it a shot
2011-06-09T02:53:00.000Z	strata_	res22_	double check some groups to see if anyone else has done it before you jump into anything though :)
