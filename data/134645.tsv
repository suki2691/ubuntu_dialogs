2007-05-17T13:12:00.000Z	kikr		I did "sudo hostname kikrbox" and now I can't run any apps
2007-05-17T13:12:00.000Z	kikr		why is this?
2007-05-17T13:14:00.000Z	BigToe	kikr	reboot... I the !hostname suggests that sudo hostname is undone on reboot
2007-05-17T13:15:00.000Z	kikr	BigToe	Flannel, is there a way to just kill X instead of rebooting?
