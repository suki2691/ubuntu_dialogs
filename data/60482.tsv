2010-02-23T21:31:00.000Z	phh45	DasEi	gnome-baker crashed many times. Growisofs failed with i/o-error (okey, the iso was larger than 4 GB). But in the mean time I was _quick enough_ to hit burn button in Nautilus iso-burning (I had burned a couple of isos to my disk for testing purposes) after inserting again and again the DVD+RW. Very good trick! :)
