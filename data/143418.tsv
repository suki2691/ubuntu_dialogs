2009-02-05T12:20:00.000Z	KyleK	syntac	is there any network services that you can test against? like a web server on your lan or something? I've heard of some drivers causing like a bandwidth limitation of that much
2009-02-05T12:21:00.000Z	KyleK	syntac	whatever wireless driver you're using is crap then
2009-02-05T12:25:00.000Z	KyleK	syntac	nope, did you do "lsmod | ndis"?
