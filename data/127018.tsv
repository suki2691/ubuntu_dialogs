2007-07-25T11:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Tomo_	Yes, though you just need to disable hardware overlay
2007-07-25T11:54:00.000Z	Tomo_	Jordan_U	 how do you go about that?
2007-07-25T11:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Tomo_	I only know for gstreamer ( totem ) run "gstreamer-properties" then in the video tab choose the option with no xv
