2008-06-15T10:56:00.000Z	InevGlitch		Hi.  I'm considering making the switch to ubuntu, something I attempted back in the 6 version, but it didn't work out.  I'm hoping things are better now.  I have a question if there is someone available who can help me out.
2008-06-15T10:56:00.000Z	bazhang_	InevGlitch	best to try the livecd first
2008-06-15T10:58:00.000Z	bazhang_	InevGlitch	you need to try the livecd; you could chat about it in #ubuntu-offtopic as this is a support channel
2008-06-15T10:59:00.000Z	bazhang_	InevGlitch	again, need to have an installation to troubleshoot; getting the livecd will be a good indicator of that
