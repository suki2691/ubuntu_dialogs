2009-10-06T09:06:00.000Z	Ramides		Hello... I"m trying to get my Evolution Mail client configured to use my hotmail account, but I can't send email. If anyone's done this before, let me know. I've tried changing the encryption to TLS, bu tthat's not working. Is there another server i should be connecting to perhaps? Instead of smtp.live.com
