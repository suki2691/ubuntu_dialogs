2009-08-24T08:49:00.000Z	droid7	Guest57596	what do you mean sharing internet with xp?
2009-08-24T08:52:00.000Z	droid7	Guest57596	that doesn't make sense. A connection cannot be stolen unless the connection is so weak that the first to connect prevents the others from connecting.
2009-08-24T08:54:00.000Z	droid7	Guest57596	have you checked if the time is set correctly? Sometimes when setting time using 'UTC', window's time configuration becomes messed up and prevents other applications from opperating as expected.
