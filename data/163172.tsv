2006-11-05T07:12:00.000Z	Arrick		Anyone here able to help finish the configuration of a pastebot that was written in perl, thats running on Ubuntu breezy? the only issue I have left is the one where the bot has the dropdown box, where you choose the channel it pastes the link into.

2006-11-05T07:13:00.000Z	Arrick		hence sudo
2006-11-05T07:15:00.000Z	skelter	Arrick	it's "sudo" as short for su, switch user, not superuser. and if you do "su" with no user name, it assumes root
