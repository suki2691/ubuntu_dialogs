2006-09-12T09:16:00.000Z	Morten_		Hey.. I have a problem installing Ubuntu on my laptop. I boot from the CD, and when the first menu pops up, i press <enter> for the default install. BUT after the initial uncompressing, the screen goes black, and nothing happens... - I have tried with different Ubuntu-vers., and it is the same result..
