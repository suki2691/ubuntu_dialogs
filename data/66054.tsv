2010-12-28T21:23:00.000Z	Frenk		Hey, I run a JAVA App Rachota 2.3 to track my time. The app disappeared somewhere in the background and I cant find it! Alt+Tab = nothing but it still works and asks me all 10 minutes if I rly work. How Do I make it appear again? (Console error was Error: Can't create Rachota system tray icon.)
2010-12-28T21:23:00.000Z	jitse	Frenk	could kill it and then restart the app?
2010-12-28T21:24:00.000Z	Frenk	jitse	Its a time tracker ... I dont want to kill and restart it every time ...
2010-12-28T21:24:00.000Z	jitse	Frenk	lol, good point
