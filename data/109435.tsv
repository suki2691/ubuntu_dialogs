2008-05-09T17:44:00.000Z	Ollie		My firefox seems to have updated itself from the standard 3.0b3 to 3.0b5. Ever since then, I can't browse the web, but my connection is still working. Any ideas?

2008-05-09T17:47:00.000Z	Ollie	ushimitsudoki	I am no in offline mode
2008-05-09T17:48:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	Ollie	well, worth a shot :( Outside of that and checking to make sure firefox is not erroneously trying a proxy, I'm out of ideas
