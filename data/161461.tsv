2009-06-11T02:28:00.000Z	tryggvib		Hello, I am trying to use evolution to send an encrypted message (using gpg) to a mailing list so that people on the list (who I have in my keyring) can decrypt it... any help or guidance where I can read more about it
2009-06-11T02:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	tryggvib	you can only encrypt a msg to one recipient at time
2009-06-11T02:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	tryggvib	so only one will be able to decrypt it the one in the From: line
2009-06-11T02:30:00.000Z	tryggvib	erUSUL	I know gpg supports something like -r and I know that others have done this, sending messages to me via the mailing list
