2008-06-28T11:36:00.000Z	PseudoBob		How risky is that?
2008-06-28T11:37:00.000Z	magnetron	PseudoBob	you can do it. and what kind of estimate of the risk do you want? 99%? 1%? 0.00001%?
2008-06-28T11:38:00.000Z	magnetron	PseudoBob	look, no one here will tell you that there's no risk. YOU have to take the responsibility of managing your disk.
