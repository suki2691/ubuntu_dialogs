However, it has a bunch of debs installed that arent part of ubuntu (such as some packages from marillat, some packages ive compiled and installed using checkinstall, etc.). Will these extra debs affect the upgrade process. Also, is there a command to list debs that are installed on the system but are not available from any of the repos listed in your sources.list file?

2005-06-30T13:43:00.000Z	kestas	gm78	which should list it
