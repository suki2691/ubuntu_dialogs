2009-09-06T09:15:00.000Z	RadarG		hello guys I think that I have a strange problem and I could use some help. I'm running ubuntu in virtialbox for some time and now I cant save anything I tried to cp a file to another directory and it gave me a file system is read only error I did a chmod on the folder and got the same error. I tried to create a file on my desktop and once again got the filesystem is read only.

2009-09-06T09:25:00.000Z	RadarG	musikgoat	a reboot fixed it
2009-09-06T09:25:00.000Z	musikgoat	RadarG	yeah, sounds like your filesystem went read only, i'm guessing there was an fsck run on boot
