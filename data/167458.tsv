2007-12-04T07:25:00.000Z	xzased		Im trying to setup a mail server using ubuntu. I've read the documentation and everything is set, but my question is if I need ubuntu server -I have installed the desktop edition- or it doesnt really matter
2007-12-04T07:26:00.000Z	xzased		thanks a lot mr. kelsin -we meet again
2007-12-04T07:26:00.000Z	chuckf	xzased	doesn't matter, but server will be a bit more secure out of the box
