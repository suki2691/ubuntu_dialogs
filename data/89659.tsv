2011-09-20T11:56:00.000Z	meco		I'm using 11.04 (I think). The keyboard has become unresponsive starting with the graphical login screen (which prevents logging in). It works fine in grub, with terminal login, and in Windows, but the keyboard suddenly won't work under xterm. Any suggestions bar a clean reinstall?

2011-09-20T11:59:00.000Z	meco	insmod	Haven't tried that. Maybe I should do that before reinstall at least...
