2010-08-08T18:17:00.000Z	jgeli		i would like to ask does anyone here have the 10 second boot time?
2010-08-08T18:18:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	jgeli	10 second boot isn't there for 99% of systems no (10 seconds is a goal for development on a non-super computer, hasn't happened yet)
2010-08-08T18:19:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	jgeli	i don't have any recommendations actually - i'm around 30 seconds as well.
