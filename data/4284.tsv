2012-03-30T20:41:00.000Z	jonathanellis		I am having problems with google chrome on Ubuntu 11.10. Chrome keeps crashing unexpectedly. I have googled for this problem but the only answers I find are for windows. I have already tried uninstalling, deleting the hidden chrome folder in my home directory and reinstalling but I still have the problem
2012-03-30T20:42:00.000Z	balleyne	jonathanellis	are you using the proprietary Google Chrome? Or Chromium, from the Ubuntu repositories?
2012-03-30T20:51:00.000Z	balleyne	jonathanellis	also, you'll likely have better support with the libre Chromium from Ubuntu's repositories than the proprietary Google Chrome from Google's repos
