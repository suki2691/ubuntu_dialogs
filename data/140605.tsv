2007-04-14T05:32:00.000Z	Marlun		Can I somehow read a ext3 formated drive from windows? I've got file on a harddrive which is ext3 and I want to move it to a ntfs drive.

2007-04-14T05:32:00.000Z	Marlun		Maybe I should ask in a windows channel instead :)
2007-04-14T05:32:00.000Z	Marlun	HymnToLife`	ok :) thanks
