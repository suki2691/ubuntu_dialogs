2011-11-11T00:37:00.000Z	eclor1		Hi. I'm using Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS 64bit with Eclipse Indigo SR1. When I quit from Eclipse by File->Exit it really doesn't quits - I still can see it running (ps ax). Anyone occurred this problem?
2011-11-11T00:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eclor1	are there bugs reported?
2011-11-11T00:39:00.000Z	eclor1	ActionParsnip	I did report this bug to Eclipse bugzilla, but problem doesn't seem to be related to Eclipse itself. On 11.10 it works.
2011-11-11T00:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	eclor1	maybe the newer version solves the bug. Is there a ppa for it?
