2008-04-19T08:35:00.000Z	harksaw		Neither nvidia-settings nor displayconfig give me the option of setting my LCD tv to 1920x1080. I know the hardware works in Windows, how do I get it to work in Ubuntu (geforce 7600) ?
2008-04-19T08:37:00.000Z	harksaw		It seems like it's an ongoing problem wiht no solution on ubuntuforums.org.
