2009-11-05T02:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	knoxville_	you dont, just use sudo and gksudo
2009-12-07T19:27:00.000Z	knoxville_	ActionParsnip	None worked, neither setting xbox ip settings to automated, or restarting the router, though I can connect to the lan, if I remove the "passwd" "user" and "application" forms, but if I use them, trying to connect to my samba file server on this laptop, it cannot get an IP address of the router.
2009-12-07T19:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	knoxville_	then try adding a static resolve in the hosts file
