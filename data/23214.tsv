2010-11-03T13:39:00.000Z	brpeppe		Jussy and hateball, I have adjusted the boot order in the bios. The system restarts loading the live cd of Ubuntu, but the menu for trying or installing Ubuntu does not appear. During the loading of CD live, the phrase "Ubuntu ....." appears, and the PC does not continue to load. I have a Desktop PC "ASUS S-presso", with CPU Intel Celeron 2.67 GHz, RAM 760 Mbyte.

2010-11-03T13:47:00.000Z	brpeppe	hateball	yes, I see a black screen and something like a keyboard at the bottom of that. When this happens, the computer is locked, and it does not continue. I try again, and I try to press a key. Thanks.
