2012-02-13T06:57:00.000Z	pmitros		My computer has a hard drive that mounts in /media on bootup. I accidentally unmounted it. Is there a way to remount it in the same way as ubuntu mounts it? I know I can mkdir /media/[UUID], mount /dev/sdXX /media/[UUID], but that seems like the wrong way to do it.
