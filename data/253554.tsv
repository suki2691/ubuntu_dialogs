2005-01-12T11:45:00.000Z	seabound_penguin	jivera	That'd be alright, but will it set up things such as printers/scanners and the like right out of the box?
2005-01-12T11:46:00.000Z	jivera	seabound_penguin	Dunno, I haven't gotten that far yet.  (I was actually in the process of looking for a good/inexpensive printer for my little sister running Ubuntu.)
