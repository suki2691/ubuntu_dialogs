2010-07-06T23:01:00.000Z	chalcedony		i'm running ubuntu 9.04 on a pc. last night it surprised me by opening a bunch of 'screenprint' windows, which i hadn't told it to do. the computer got slower and slower, i tried to open a terminal and stop proceses, but it didn't work, the clock eventually stopped. i shut it off and restarted. then it didn't have any network connection. i've added 2 network cards.. still no connection, and spent time looking at eth0 eth1 eth2 eth3. today: sudo
2010-07-06T23:01:00.000Z	chalcedony		/etc/init.d/networking start - got it to see the ip for google... but when i started firefox it didn't see it, not even the ip i had pinged. and ping no longer worked.
2010-07-06T23:01:00.000Z	chalcedony		I'm not sure what to do now?
