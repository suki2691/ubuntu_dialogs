2009-10-30T23:28:00.000Z	_jonesy_		I have a Macbook pro that I am going to dual boot Ubuntu 9.10 and Snow Leopard. Should I go with the x64 or x86 version of Ubuntu?

2009-10-30T23:30:00.000Z	_jonesy_	IndyGunFreak	I have 4GB's of memory in this laptop, so that was why I was thinking of going with 64bit
2009-10-30T23:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	_jonesy_	i guess if that 500mb of ram that it won't recognize means that much to you, then use 64bit.
