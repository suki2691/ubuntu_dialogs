2009-11-04T14:19:00.000Z	corigo		Got a GRUB 15 error after install and can't boot. advice is to edit the /boot/grub/menu.lst file, but there is no such file in my boot/grub folder
2009-11-04T14:21:00.000Z	maje	corigo	It sounds like you don't even have a filesystem to boot to...you can use a liveCD to see if your filesystem has been destroyed, or you can just do a fresh install
2009-11-04T14:21:00.000Z	corigo	maje	nope I've got a boot partition and GRUB folder, just not that specific file.
2009-11-04T14:22:00.000Z	maje	corigo	Okay, maybe someone else can help, sorry but I'm here just trying to gather knowledge mostly
