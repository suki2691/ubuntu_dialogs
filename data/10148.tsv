2011-09-27T00:20:00.000Z	_cb		Have Ubuntu 11.04 desktop and server installed. Server booting by default. Trying to change boot order. Start-up Manager does not work, neither gedit /etc/default/grub any ideas (other than re-installing?)
2011-09-27T00:20:00.000Z	alkafoo	_cb	but you _can_ boot to the desktop version?
2011-09-27T00:20:00.000Z	_cb	alkafoo	yes by using the down key to select it
2011-09-27T00:24:00.000Z	alkafoo	_cb	I haven't used GRUB2 much, but GRUB(1) had an option to specify which rule was default regardless of order
