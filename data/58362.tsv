2009-05-03T13:01:00.000Z	Toshibi		Good morning ladies and gents. I'm in a bit of a pickle. I went to try out wicd for some stupid reason or another and it removed gnome-network-manager. I'm in the livecd now as I am using wireless and things have gone bad. real bad. can I just download and install the missing packages?

2009-05-03T13:03:00.000Z	Toshibi		I do know how to do it through the terminal.
2009-05-03T13:04:00.000Z	cspack_	Toshibi	installing network manager should remove wicd (and vice versa).  i've had better luck with wicd myself, network manager never works with my wireless
