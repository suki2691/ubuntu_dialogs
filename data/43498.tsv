2010-05-22T12:02:00.000Z	Cptnodegard	greezmunkey	i dont have issues with the iphone, im just saying this is more locked down. just getting the netbook launcher removed in UNE was an epically backwards task as it kept restareting and according to a statement from Ubtuntu the desktop switcher app that is supposed to do it isnt included because "you shouldnt need to disable it". if that doesnt sound like steve jobs i dont know what does
