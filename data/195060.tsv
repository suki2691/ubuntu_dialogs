2008-06-10T23:43:00.000Z	Scunizi	cszikszoy	does it just stop and not logout?
2008-06-10T23:43:00.000Z	Scunizi	cszikszoy	do you have keytouch installed?
2008-06-10T23:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	cszikszoy	that happened to me.. 2 things to do.. on shutdown do a ctrl+alt+F2 .. login and "sudo shutdown -P now" or uninstall keytouch.
