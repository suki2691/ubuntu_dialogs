2008-05-07T00:21:00.000Z	xborgy	BoomShaka	i had the same prob with compiz just giving erros and not starting but it works now
2008-05-07T00:23:00.000Z	xborgy	BoomShaka	all i had to do to fix it was i ran the Synaptic Package Manager and i clicked All on the left then searched compiz i installed all that stuff and i now got a icon to run the settings for compiz
