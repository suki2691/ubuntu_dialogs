2008-01-08T08:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	SANTAbios	 it does support it.. direct logging in is disbled for security reasons.
2008-01-08T08:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	SANTAbios	 demand a refund then.
2008-01-09T00:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	SANTAbios	 check cups.org to see how well supported that printer is.. with my printers - i just plugged them in and thye were seen/deteted
