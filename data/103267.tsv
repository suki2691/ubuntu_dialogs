2008-02-26T17:10:00.000Z	javb	danand	i did that :/
2008-02-26T17:13:00.000Z	danand	javb	- that will only remove _system_ config files ie config files in /etc. your config files ie .pkgnamerc will remain. if you've done a reinstall and pidgin keeps crashing for you, perhaps you should consider using something else
2008-02-26T17:14:00.000Z	javb	danand	, have tried everything else, for ME, nothing like Gaim, now pidgin.
