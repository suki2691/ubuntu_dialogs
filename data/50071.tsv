2009-08-24T09:01:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	zruty	I suppose you can if you install openssh-server on the LiveCD
2009-08-24T09:02:00.000Z	zruty	leaf-sheep	Mmm.. that is not by default on the live cd, then?
2009-08-24T09:02:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	zruty	No. It's not installed by default... except server edition, I believe.
