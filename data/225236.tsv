2005-08-06T06:27:00.000Z	persia	gilligan_	You can do dmix in hoary - just look in /usr/share/doc/alsa-utils (or maybe -base)
2005-08-06T06:29:00.000Z	gilligan_	persia	oh.. well i haven't really tried.. but when I just did some short test i thought the alsa version was just missing the proper plugins etc.. but i'll just wait until breezy is a bit more stable and get it that way.. i've been getting along for so long with this ESD crap.. some more weeks wont matter
