2009-08-08T05:11:00.000Z	myownserver		I've installed WordPress from the Synaptic Package Manager and I'm not sure how I'm suppose to use/access it.
2009-08-08T05:13:00.000Z	myownserver		I've already installed Apache2, MySQL, PHP5, etc.  But WordPress was installed in some other directory and it doesn't have any explanation how that works.
