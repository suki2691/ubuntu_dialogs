2008-11-15T11:40:00.000Z	deuceswild		Hey Guys. I was in here earlier because when I boot Ubuntu from the HD, my computer suddenly turns off, but it works fine from the livecd. Someone in here told me to try booting with noapic acpi=off and it seems like it works now.
2008-11-15T11:40:00.000Z	deuceswild		I noticed there is a bios update available for my computer. Do you think that might fix it?
2008-11-15T11:40:00.000Z	SeaOfTea	deuceswild	That's how I have to boot
2008-11-15T11:49:00.000Z	SeaOfTea	deuceswild	My boot locks up if I don't boot with those options
