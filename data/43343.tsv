2010-05-06T01:39:00.000Z	Arsin		I'm getting no sound in Lucid, had it in Karmic, check my ALSA config looks right, anyone know what might be wrong?
2010-05-06T01:40:00.000Z	bonez2046	Arsin	did you try killing npviewer.bin and retrying the sound?
2010-05-06T01:41:00.000Z	Arsin	bonez2046	hmm.. how do I do that?
2010-05-06T01:41:00.000Z	bonez2046	Arsin	and then kill the numbered process
