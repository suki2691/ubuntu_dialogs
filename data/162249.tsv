2008-04-22T00:55:00.000Z	adamb		I should be able to install a 32bit version of ubuntu server on a 64bit server, right?
2008-04-22T00:55:00.000Z	Lamego	adamb	sure
2008-04-22T00:55:00.000Z	adamb	Lamego	all I am loosing out on is addressable space, as in amount of memory I can put in, yes?
2008-04-22T00:56:00.000Z	Lamego	adamb	yes, and, theoretically you would get more performance with 64 bits kernel/apps
