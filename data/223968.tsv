2006-06-01T07:09:00.000Z	sybariten	LinuxJones	sure there are rules... i've just never seen anyone being offended on irc by the word "bitch" before. It means female dog or something and its even turned into a verb these days ("hes always the first to bitch").
2006-06-01T07:09:00.000Z	LinuxJones	sybariten	dude it's considered cursing here.
2006-06-01T07:11:00.000Z	sybariten	LinuxJones	ok, well, didnt know that. There should be a blacklist or something somewhere. For non-americans (or non-brits, etc) its sometimes hard to estimate if the word "blabla" will be offensive or not (and ofcourse one always tries to use it anyhow)
