2008-03-17T15:29:00.000Z	TroubleHelix	Blou_Aap	what audio software are you using? ALSA?
2008-03-17T15:30:00.000Z	TroubleHelix	Blou_Aap	Maybe a frequency / sample rate mismatch... You might want to Google search your audio chipset and see if others have problems with it.
2008-03-17T15:33:00.000Z	TroubleHelix	Blou_Aap	Word, I'm just saying - find out the chipset, and google that, there may be some info you can learn from other's detective work. I usually just use the commandline tool 'alsamixer' to identify my card if I know ALSA is installed properly.
