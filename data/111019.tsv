2009-01-11T20:36:00.000Z	aheckler	ezerhoden	i didnt think so, but after i did it, nautilus went all wonky (trying to open it's preferences crashed it) and "sudo ifdown eth0" produced a hostname could not be resolved error
2009-01-11T20:37:00.000Z	aheckler	ezerhoden	everything's fine now, i just dont know why ubuntu would do that
