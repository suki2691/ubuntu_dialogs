2007-01-13T12:40:00.000Z	bcardarella		Okay, I'm getting stuck. Where should I go in my server config to have it listen on port 8080?
2007-01-13T12:40:00.000Z	adaptr	bcardarella	what server ?
2007-01-13T12:41:00.000Z	adaptr	bcardarella	no... what *server* *program*
2007-01-13T12:42:00.000Z	adaptr	bcardarella	change the Listen port to 8080 in ports.conf
