2008-02-24T17:00:00.000Z	rachel84		Hi everyone. Is this an appropriate to place to beg for help with a Ubuntu desktop bug/issue/problem/misconfiguration/me just being daft?
2008-02-24T17:02:00.000Z	rachel84		Right! Will do! I've got a problem with user switching. When I try to switch user I just get a blank screen. Sometimes I get the black screen when I first switch, sometimes the first switch works and get a black screen when I try to switch back to the first user. I'm running Gnome with Compiz on an Intel 910GL card. Trouble is, I'm not really sure where to look to start diagnosing the thing.
2008-02-24T17:04:00.000Z	rachel84		Oh... and when I get the black screen I can here the log-in box appear and type a password and hear the Ubuntu log-in music. I can ctrl-Alt-F1 to get a terminal, but I can't see any error messages anywhere (probably not looking in the right place, though)
2008-02-24T17:05:00.000Z	Squawk	rachel84	dmesg or have a look in /var/log/somethingorother.log
