2011-01-26T08:02:00.000Z	superlinkx		Anyone know why my computer crashes when I try to use any kernel above 2.6.32? I think its a graphics issue, but it works fine on 2.6.32. I use an ATI Radeon 4650 graphics card with open drivers
2011-01-26T08:03:00.000Z	sageb1	superlinkx	yes, a newer card won't crash.
2011-01-26T08:04:00.000Z	sageb1	superlinkx	the 4000s series and the recompiled radeon driver for the newer kernel don't like each other due to obsolescence.
