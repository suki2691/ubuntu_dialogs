2011-09-26T10:34:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	binni	yes I am aware of the virtualization options, this is actually a script written by me, some of the commands are run with sudo so they require that. But I just wanted to check and see if the messages in between commands are formatted correctly, I guess I will simply comment out stuff and confirm that
