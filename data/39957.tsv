2010-04-04T22:06:00.000Z	preston_		I have a canon MP190 printer and need to install it. The linux drivers the canon site provides are 32-bit and do not install on my 64bit version of karmic koala. How can I install this?
2010-04-04T22:08:00.000Z	preston_		How do I do that?
2010-04-04T22:09:00.000Z	preston_		Yes I tried that, it isn't available
2010-04-04T22:10:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	preston_	arent there any generic postscript or whatever options?
