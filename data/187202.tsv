2009-02-12T20:51:00.000Z	Shadoweaver		I am trying to learn how to use a program language.  C++ seems a bit out of my league.  What language should a beginner to unix start?
2009-02-12T20:53:00.000Z	Shadoweaver		Is bash an easy language to learn?  If so where does one start?
2009-02-12T20:53:00.000Z	ikonia	Shadoweaver	not really an ubuntu question
