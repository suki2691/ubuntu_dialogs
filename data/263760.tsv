2008-03-23T02:06:00.000Z	sap	nikrud	hmm... i've been using ubuntu only for many months now , but maybe not right after its realeased , say a few months after it is released
2008-03-23T02:11:00.000Z	sap	nikrud	for example I'd like to update Pidgin messenger, so could that be possible with adding a line or something in the repo ?
2008-03-23T02:12:00.000Z	sap	nikrud	so it has to be a .deb package? or can it be a source as well ( i was thinking of linking it to the download page on the application's website ) ?
