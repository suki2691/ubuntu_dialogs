2011-06-21T08:08:00.000Z	commander1988199		I am trying to install ubuntu on my hp dv6693us laptop. When I try to run it from usb or install it, the screen is not right. It is split up in 3 sections and blurry. almost like an old windows 95 problem. What could be causing this and is there any way to install ubuntu on my laptop?
