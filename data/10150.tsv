2011-09-23T07:01:00.000Z	alkafoo	tim167	because you aren't familiar enough with them to realize it isn't random
2011-09-23T07:03:00.000Z	tim167	alkafoo	well it does seem random, for example some files i recorded with the same camera, transfered to my computer on the same day, the same way...etc, and now I open the disk again, and there is the lock icon on some of them, no idea why
