2012-04-02T23:11:00.000Z	Andi_M_	bazhang	I have 3 SWFs that were running standalone on Windows that I need to port to an Ubuntu install.  1 is a container which then calls the other 2, a video and a game inside it.  They all work individually, but when I run the container, the video just shows a black screen, all the rest of it works...
2012-04-02T23:12:00.000Z	Andi_M_	bazhang	I've tried installing codecs and whatnot thinking it might be that then realized it works if I run it on it's own.  Unfortunately I don't have the original FLAs as this was done 5 years ago.  I tried to decompile but SWFDecompiler took my money and never gave me a valid license key and they're tech is in China now, lol.
