2009-08-05T23:07:00.000Z	ScottG	burkmat	Yea. My X starts with .xinitrc. But at the end it needs a command to hang on.
2009-08-05T23:08:00.000Z	burkmat	ScottG	Aah.. Well then sleep is no good, because eventually it will finish. ;) I... don't know really. Maybe have it ask for input and never give any?
