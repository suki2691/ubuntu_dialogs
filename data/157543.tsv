2007-05-13T08:59:00.000Z	mjunx	DoctorOwl	of course, I think that all software should be freed (not necessarily free as in beer, but free as in speech)
2007-05-13T08:59:00.000Z	DoctorOwl	Enverex	Mark said to make it open-source would encourage people to set up their own Launchpad servers and go against the idea of a unified bug tracking system it was designed to be.
2007-05-13T08:59:00.000Z	mjunx	DoctorOwl	if it can be modified to work like bzr and be distributed, it should work as a unified tracker as well...
