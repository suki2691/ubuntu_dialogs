2010-08-22T09:59:00.000Z	thune3	dublisk	ldconfig man page does not indicate that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is used for cache. I assume a uncached library just has to be linked at runtime without the benifit of the cache. Did you get the LD_LIBARAY_PATH variable sorted. These are the files that affect environment for my login (plus any you call): http://paste.ubuntu.com/481748/
2010-09-23T10:48:00.000Z	thune3	dublisk	i only get that error dialong when my filesystem encounters errors and is remounted read-only. Just pointing it out.
