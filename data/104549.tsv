2012-11-06T07:00:00.000Z	EdLin_		I just installed GNOME, I think it's going to unity shell instead though, so I haven't been able to test my user with it. How do I get it to launch?

2012-11-06T07:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	EdLin_	alternatively (and without dumb quirks) you can install XFCE and use that, its a lot like Gnome2 and you can run your Gnome apps there without issue
