2011-08-17T21:36:00.000Z	cook1es_	ActionParsnip	ok thanks, happen to know what the reason of this error could be aswell? 2apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName
2011-08-17T21:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cook1es_	you should have a line in /etc/hosts     which says:     127.0.1.1     name
2011-08-17T21:41:00.000Z	cook1es_	ActionParsnip	Yes, I do
2011-08-17T21:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cook1es_	not sure then (personally), maybe others can help
