2010-06-10T00:34:00.000Z	completenewbie		because it seems like even though I created a full administrator account I still cant do things like edit files
2010-06-10T00:34:00.000Z	nucc1_	completenewbie	where is the file located?
2010-06-10T00:35:00.000Z	nucc1_	completenewbie	you can only edit files that were created by you. and NO. Do not log in as root, especially if you are a newbie.
