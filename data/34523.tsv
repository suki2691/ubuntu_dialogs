2010-04-07T06:23:00.000Z	DasEi	jhamlin_	(#xubuntu) you can set it under preference/login or, if you use a loginscreen, choose per session
2010-04-07T06:24:00.000Z	jhamlin_	DasEi	xdm doesn't give me any options at all.  Just a little window to type my name, then pass...
2010-04-07T06:25:00.000Z	DasEi	jhamlin_	there is a way for sure, it's in the undermenu of shutdown/reboot/failsafe temrinal
