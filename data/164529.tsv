2010-01-02T04:16:00.000Z	Chelsea	shawn146	it may be a driver/soundcard compatibility problem
2010-01-02T04:16:00.000Z	Chelsea	shawn146	I'm not really great with card/ubuntu stuff though
2010-01-02T04:16:00.000Z	Chelsea	shawn146	try googling for your sound card and ubuntu to see if snyone else has had the same problem
