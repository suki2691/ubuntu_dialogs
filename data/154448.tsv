2006-12-16T06:04:00.000Z	Capslock118		i deleted a rather large folder from off one of my HDDs, it doesnt show that it is there, yet the space is still taken up, why is this?
2006-12-16T06:04:00.000Z	Intangir	Capslock118	it probably put it in the trash
2006-12-16T06:04:00.000Z	Intangir		if you deleted it from inside nautilus it moves it to trash
2006-12-16T06:05:00.000Z	Capslock118	Intangir	trash can is empty
