2005-09-19T11:25:00.000Z	jediborger		hello I just installed ubuntu version 5.10 and can't get my microsft trackball to work, does anyone have any suggestions?
2005-09-19T11:25:00.000Z	nalioth	jediborger	wait until the official release date
2005-09-19T11:25:00.000Z	nalioth	jediborger	breezy will be broken until oct 13
2005-09-19T11:26:00.000Z	nalioth	jediborger	yes it will, but that involves a complete reinstall (not the *nix way)
