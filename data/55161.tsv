I need another user called MxUser which can Read only to this directory via SMB - as a start - where is the best place to create this folder? under /home/MxData ?

2012-11-04T09:33:00.000Z	edbian	Ali_nz^1	There is a system which allows you to add use account to one file on one machine and have all the other machines read that file to become of user accounts.
