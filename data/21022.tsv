2012-07-17T02:07:00.000Z	Schuenemann		hi, I'm trying to install ubuntu 12.04 to my netbook using a pendrive recorded with unetbootin. But I get that busybox shell and a kernel panic when I exit it. Any help, please?

2012-07-17T02:10:00.000Z	ActionPa1snip	Schuenemann	sorry, misread
2012-07-17T02:10:00.000Z	Schuenemann	ActionPa1snip	it's ok
