2008-04-23T20:45:00.000Z	Vlet		I just got my new server in for the office, and I'm wondering if anyone could advise me on whether or not I 'should' use the 64 bit version of the server dist... in other words, am I going to find that some software in the repos is not available for 64bit?

2008-04-23T20:47:00.000Z	Vlet	Stroganoff	maek: great, thanks. Yeah, it's dual quad xeons with 8 gigs of memory, so yeah, 64 bit would be a 'good thing'. Just wanted to double-check :)
2008-04-23T20:49:00.000Z	Stroganoff	Vlet	i dont think so
