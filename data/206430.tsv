2005-11-23T15:37:00.000Z	samscol	topyli	do you know where grub's error messages are documented? as in some web page where the grub bootup sequence is explained?
2005-11-23T15:38:00.000Z	samscol		i googled, but only found a page with late stage error messages
2005-11-23T15:38:00.000Z	topyli	samscol	dunno, i bet grub's home page has documentation though
