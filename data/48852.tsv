2010-03-30T23:45:00.000Z	iceroot	jzacsh	dpkg tab tab will show you the options
2010-03-30T23:46:00.000Z	jzacsh	iceroot	ah, sweet tab completion (that is thanks to bash's tab completion right? -- or is that not really completion?)
2010-03-30T23:47:00.000Z	iceroot	jzacsh	zsh is doing the same (but much much better) :)
