2007-03-11T06:00:00.000Z	Trentster		hey all, I have cloned a ubuntu dapper install to another drive and put it in a pc with almost identical hardware, everything works fine except its not automatically assigning an eth0, i can see its being picked up by dmesg as "sky2" how do i go about reconfigging so that when the pc boots eth0 comes up by default..?

2007-03-11T06:04:00.000Z	Trentster	IndyGunFreak	its a custom vmware build running vmware-server on top of ubuntu dapper server...
2007-03-11T06:04:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Trentster	i see
