I am using this link http://www.unixmen.com/linux-tutorials/linux-distributions/linux-distributions4-ubuntu/1679-how-to-install-burg-in-ubuntu- . I am stuck at this part: "Remember to substitute ‘hd0′ with the drive on which your MBR is installed." My question ius how to find out what drive my MBR is installed on ?
