2011-08-19T05:29:00.000Z	megaloman		I have a question. Can I separate workspaces across dual monitors so that switching windows leaves one static on a video or something like that?
2011-08-19T05:29:00.000Z	megaloman		Would that be in ccsm?
2011-08-19T05:30:00.000Z	urlin2u	megaloman	you can drag from screen to screen
2011-08-19T05:30:00.000Z	megaloman	urlin2u	I can have the two screens fine.
