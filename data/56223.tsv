2009-05-27T17:06:00.000Z	frodon1		I have the standard Open Office installation - which is my preferred office product - and then I installed Lotus Symphony. Since that my text files (odt) open automatically with Symphony.
2009-05-27T17:06:00.000Z	frodon1		How can I switch back so that Open Office starts the odt files as a standard?
