2009-11-07T01:01:00.000Z	Alice1		Can anyone help me with this? I tried to use the Update Manager, but a message saying E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
2009-11-07T01:01:00.000Z	Alice1		E: _cache->open() failed, please report.
2009-11-07T01:01:00.000Z	Alice1		came up. Does anyone know anything about it?
2009-11-07T01:03:00.000Z	cankoy	Alice1	the message tells you what to do... open a terminal and type that command.
