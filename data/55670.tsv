2009-07-25T01:22:00.000Z	Clooluss	meatyboy	i had something similar for a long time. Delete all the networks and start again.

2009-07-25T01:26:00.000Z	Clooluss	meatyboy	Yeah, it was like that for me until I got jaunty. Now I have to reconnect regularly, but don't have to enter my password any more.
