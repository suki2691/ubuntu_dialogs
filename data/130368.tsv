2007-06-18T11:41:00.000Z	Adam4444		Hello. I'm currently configuring vmware-player and need my Linux headers for that. How can I find out which Linux headers I should use?
2007-06-18T11:43:00.000Z	yondie	Adam4444	u should use the header with yer current kernel
2007-06-18T11:44:00.000Z	yondie		remember to configure back the vmware server each time u update the kernel
2007-06-18T11:44:00.000Z	Adam4444	yondie	I have tried all headers in /usr/src/, but vmware-player didn't like them.
