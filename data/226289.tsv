2010-11-25T06:00:00.000Z	GringoStar		It look less busy now so I'll ask again: I 've set my screensaver to never and the power management to never sleep in 10.04 but it continue to sleep after 15 minutes download or movie or game...
2010-11-25T06:02:00.000Z	GringoStar		How can I disable monitor sleep?
2010-11-25T06:02:00.000Z	muelli	GringoStar	try running the gnome-screensaver with --debug and check what it says.
2010-11-25T06:08:00.000Z	muelli	GringoStar	so use gnome-screensave-command --quit or so to get rid of the running instance
