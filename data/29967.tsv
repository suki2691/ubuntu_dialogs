2010-06-23T07:20:00.000Z	Tarkers		I just did something recently that stopped my flash from working in Chromium and I'm having problems diagnosing it.  I'm not sure what exactly it is I did but things like youtube videos just show up as a grey box now, though I still get audio.  Anyone have any suggestions?

2010-06-23T07:23:00.000Z	sabuntu	Tarkers	did you try closing and reopening chrome?
