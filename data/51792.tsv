2010-05-02T18:35:00.000Z	Casperin		I'm on a netbook (with NBR) where there's no workswitcher icon. I also cannot add it to the panel (no free room to right click and add stuff).. So how do I get to the properties of it? =/
2010-05-02T18:36:00.000Z	jiohdi	Casperin	there is room, but its hard to find
2010-05-02T18:37:00.000Z	Casperin	jiohdi	do you know *know* this? Because usually I can find it the room (on non-NBR's).. but not this time
2010-05-02T18:37:00.000Z	jiohdi	Casperin	I have found it several times with trial and error
