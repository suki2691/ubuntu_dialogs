2008-12-01T19:17:00.000Z	Ayoub	chiliblue	: you have to edit file named sudoers
2008-12-01T19:17:00.000Z	chiliblue	Ayoub	the user did have access to sudo...but for some odd reason it has automagically stopped working
2008-12-01T19:18:00.000Z	chiliblue	Ayoub	do you think it is some kind of timestamp issue
