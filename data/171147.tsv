2006-08-13T07:57:00.000Z	grubedithelp		hi, I'm having some issues with ubuntu, was wondering if I could some advice-  I'm an XP user, just made the switch- I have to disable dma to boot ubuntu, and I'm trying to see if there's a way to get it going, possibly there's a different "mode" to use for it or a way I can setup dma manually.  I'm sure my drive has it.  Can someone give input?
