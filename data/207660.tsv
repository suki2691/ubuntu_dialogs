2008-05-04T02:24:00.000Z	gord_	Phantal	there's one installed by default in hardy, i forget the name though, sorry. i run fluxbox
2008-05-04T02:26:00.000Z	gord_	Phantal	fastest way to find if not seen in menu is use synaptic to search for "RDP"
2008-05-04T02:28:00.000Z	gord_	Phantal	look for Vinagre client, it talks to XP RDP also, so i'm told
