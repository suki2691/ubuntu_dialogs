2011-05-21T04:40:00.000Z	gonzalo		Hello, I installed Ruby (programming language interpreter) with: "sudo apt-get ruby". This installed Ruby 1.8.7, but I want 1.9.2. I did't find 1.9.2 in the synaptic package manager, so I downloaded the source and compiled. However, the Ruby my system has is still 1.8.7. In the folder I downloaded I execute "./ruby --version" and there it's 1.9.2. How do I replace the ruby I have installed...
2011-05-21T04:40:00.000Z	gonzalo		...for the new one??? Thanks!
