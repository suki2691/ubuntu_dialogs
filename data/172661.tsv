2006-11-13T17:01:00.000Z	JamieBE		Hello, I am having some trouble installing a piece of software on Ubuntu. It is a tar.gz file, I am doing a "make" command from the terminal and it does a whole load of stuff and then gives me an error: undefined reference to `atk_object_add_relationship'
2006-11-13T17:02:00.000Z	SpComb	JamieBE	before trying to compile something from source, make sure that there isn't a existing ubuntu package for it... apt-get install <foo> is considerably easier
