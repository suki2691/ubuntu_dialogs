2005-06-11T09:46:00.000Z	darth_schmoo		I'm trying to get the java plugin for firefox working.  The ubuntuguide site recommends that I install a package (sun-j2rel.5) that doesn't exist.  What next?
2005-06-11T09:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	darth_schmoo	the package you need is on the Sun site (it might be a slightly different version - haven't looked lately)
2005-06-11T09:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	darth_schmoo	the sun java is a restricted format - legal issues
