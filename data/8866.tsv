2011-12-27T16:18:00.000Z	ix_		hello, I've just deleted my partition table, any ideas?
2011-12-27T16:18:00.000Z	SunTsu	ix_	use gpart to recover it
2011-12-27T16:19:00.000Z	ix_	SunTsu	I was just doing that, thank you
2011-12-27T16:19:00.000Z	SunTsu	ix_	but beware, there's dragons ahead, better grab an image of your whole disk before doing that
