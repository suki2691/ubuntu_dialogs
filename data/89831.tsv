2008-06-05T23:44:00.000Z	blumm		anyone know why rhythmbox wont load m3u playlists in correct order?
2008-06-05T23:45:00.000Z	notsniw	blumm	i dont know that app, but may you toggled a "random"-switch, and it applies it even to playlists?
2008-06-05T23:47:00.000Z	blumm	notsniw	random order is disabled - it just doesnt follow the m3u order but loads the album in random order
