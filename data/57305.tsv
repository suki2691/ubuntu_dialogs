2010-01-02T01:54:00.000Z	w3asal		when I run compiz, everytime I use alt-tab to switch from and then eventually back to gnome-terminal, gnome-terminal does not capture *any* keystrokes, if I move the window or switch back and forth with the mouse, it works again. where should I report this? it's 100% reproducible on my system
2010-01-02T01:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	w3asal	log a bug
2010-01-02T01:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	w3asal	i'd also ask in #compiz
2010-01-02T01:56:00.000Z	w3asal	ActionParsnip	I plan to, should I file under compiz or gnome-terminal? also should I file in ubuntu or upstream?
