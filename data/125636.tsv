2007-10-26T12:28:00.000Z	oxeimon		how can I stop my monitor from going black every 10 minutes?
2007-10-26T12:29:00.000Z	oxeimon		under power management, it says to put the display to sleep when inactive for 31minutes, not 10 minutes
2007-10-26T12:30:00.000Z	oxeimon		screensaver preferences say to regard the computer as idle after 30 minutes, not 10 minutes
2007-10-26T12:30:00.000Z	dgjones	oxeimon	is it a laptop? maybe there's a power management setting to switch off the screen after 10 minutes outside of the activate screensaver settings
