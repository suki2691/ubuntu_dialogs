2012-05-29T19:33:00.000Z	qlum		I am currently having a problem opening software sources, I can open the files themselves but I can't open software sources via sympatics nor ubuntu software center, this happened after updating to 12.4 or maybe earlier to 10.10, or 11.4, or 11.10 as I didn't use the feature in the meantime. I also can't add add repositories.

2012-05-29T19:36:00.000Z	vfw	qlum	So you seem to be unalbe to add new sources?
2012-05-29T19:37:00.000Z	vfw	qlum	Not sure what would cause that...
