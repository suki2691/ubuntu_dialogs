2008-04-13T23:55:00.000Z	xteven	BritGuy	what about user management stuff.. like moving users from group to group... and listing all current groups, adding and removing groups?
2008-04-13T23:58:00.000Z	BritGuy	xteven	-I think the command for adding, listing, removing groups is just "group", u can get help on the command by doing group --help
