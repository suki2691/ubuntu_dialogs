2006-09-11T14:57:00.000Z	archangelpetro	djm62	well i managed to get that working when i was on gentoo, both through wine (although it was very very slow).. but it also worked through the firefox binary too. So perhaps there is at least some availablity for linux ?
2006-09-11T14:59:00.000Z	djm62	archangelpetro	nope, it's proprietary software from Adobe :( flash 9 will be available next year.  older flash stuff won't cut it for youTube, although it is available.  I've found that the default wine build on ubuntu runs it at a rasonable speed on my reasonable laptop
2006-09-11T14:59:00.000Z	archangelpetro	djm62	weird, i had it working on gentoo? Oh well i'll do as you advised and install it through wine :D thanks very much :)
