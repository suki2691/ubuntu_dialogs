2008-09-19T05:12:00.000Z	jedimind		i installed nvidia drivers from nvidia's site; and they work great but every time i reboot, ubuntu doesnt recognize my display and prompts the 'configure now' popup before login, and doesnt let me set a resolution (only 640x480) so i have to kill x, install the drivers, and start X again in the same session every single reboot....
2008-09-19T05:12:00.000Z	jedimind		any ideas?
2008-09-19T05:13:00.000Z	b-relaxed	jedimind	 did you check with hardware drivers ?
2008-09-19T05:13:00.000Z	jedimind	b-relaxed	what do you mean ?
