I changed to power managment settings but I can only set it to blank screen (and some other) but I want it to do nothing because I want to close the lid when I work on another screen at work. How can I get it to do nothing?

2010-01-26T21:57:00.000Z	h00k	sl00	it just turns the light off on the laptop's LCD
