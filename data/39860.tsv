2010-01-05T18:29:00.000Z	tavasti	Xfact	yes you can, but you need to add anothert to grub by hand
2010-01-05T18:33:00.000Z	tavasti	Xfact	I'm not sure if ubuntu install cd can resize your existing partition, or do you need to get some other rescue cd for shrinking it
2010-01-05T18:34:00.000Z	Xfact	tavasti	but maybe install in free space can help....
