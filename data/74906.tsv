2008-11-07T22:35:00.000Z	chuckmoney	robacarp	maybe if you use the alternate CD and select the ubuntu-minimal package instead of the default ubuntu-desktop package.  But usually an install step has to fail for it to manually let you select packages.

2008-11-07T22:37:00.000Z	chuckmoney	robacarp	then just install gnome-desktop.  should install only gnome and not any of the prebundled ubuntu applications.  but since you installed from the server CD it might not.  I'm not sure.
