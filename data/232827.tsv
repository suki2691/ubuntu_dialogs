2011-01-17T00:10:00.000Z	opium		I have 2 user accounts - my personal one and a guest account. How do I maek it so as the guest account can't access my filesystem?
2011-01-17T00:11:00.000Z	opium		yeah
2011-01-17T00:12:00.000Z	opium		if guest is logged on and goes into my personal directories and tries to access files, I don't want the guest to have that permission
