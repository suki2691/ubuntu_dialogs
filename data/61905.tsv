2009-11-25T21:24:00.000Z	Fatb0y		anyone familiar with /etc/exports?  i would like a range of ips from 192.168.1.100 - 150 or 200 to be able to access the nfs shares and i keep failing on the correct switch.  i have one ip accessing just fine.
2009-11-25T21:25:00.000Z	Fatb0y		i have tried a notation yes, but not familiar with what that switch means.
2009-11-25T21:26:00.000Z	Fatb0y		i did and the /24 or whatever i read on only gave about 15 ips access when i want even more than that
2009-11-25T21:26:00.000Z	grawity	Fatb0y	Use a different number then >_>
