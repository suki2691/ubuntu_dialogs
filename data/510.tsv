2012-11-03T22:33:00.000Z	Archio		Is there any way to get Ubuntu's default g++ to show line numbers for errors? As of now I just get "file.cpp:(.text+0x653): error" instead of "file.cpp: (line  5): error".

2012-11-03T22:34:00.000Z	Archio	handuel	So those errors would show up like that on any platform?
2012-11-03T22:35:00.000Z	handuel	Archio	paste your cpp file to ubuntu paste and I'll attempt compilation
