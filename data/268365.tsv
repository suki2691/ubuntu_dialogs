2006-06-04T12:54:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos		Hey everyone. I followed the wiki steps for installing LAMP in Ubuntu 6.06, but now that it's done, my browser displays a download dialog box instead of serving up the pages (.php or .html) within the browser.
2006-06-04T12:54:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos		Any suggestions?
2006-06-04T12:55:00.000Z	GuardianAtomos		As if those files are foreign to apache2.
2006-06-04T12:55:00.000Z	sladen	GuardianAtomos	check the apache error log
