2008-02-25T21:07:00.000Z	Gigamo		I have a question. I have windows installed on sda1. My root partition is sda2. Now I want to uninstall windows, I installed windows first so I suppose the MBR is on sda1, grub is installed on my root partition
2008-02-25T21:07:00.000Z	Gigamo		If i remove windows, will I still be able to boot into ubuntu?
2008-02-25T21:08:00.000Z	Gigamo		I mean if i delete the windows partition
2008-02-25T21:08:00.000Z	Bruum	Gigamo	 :  yes you can still boot into ubuntu :)
