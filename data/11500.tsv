2011-07-31T03:18:00.000Z	nsadmin2		are the alternate installer isos bootable?
2011-07-31T03:18:00.000Z	exutux	nsadmin2	sure
2011-07-31T03:22:00.000Z	nsadmin2	exutux	so I guess I have some choices here, one I don't have presently is to burn a cd... but, I could put it somewhere on the external drive... but if I do that, how do I arrange to boot the iso?
