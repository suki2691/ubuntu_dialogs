2004-12-28T15:14:00.000Z	Odin-		Hmh.
2004-12-28T15:16:00.000Z	aj	Odin-	if you put debian urls first in apt/sources.list, but use apt's pinning mechanism to say "only select ubuntu packages", apt'll download ubuntu packages from debian urls whenever they're available
2004-12-28T15:17:00.000Z	aj	Odin-	(ie, for universe packages where ubuntu's just using debian's package)
