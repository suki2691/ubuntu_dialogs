2009-11-21T22:26:00.000Z	Billiard	digitalfiz	you can download from nvidias website but i dont recomend it
2009-11-21T22:40:00.000Z	digitalfiz	Billiard	think using the installer directly from nvidia is a good idea?
2009-11-21T22:41:00.000Z	Billiard	digitalfiz	i wouldnt use it, but it might work,  package managers drivers work perfect and are new enough for me
