2005-10-10T14:29:00.000Z	_jason	imc1	 have a link so I can try?  I just upgraded to breezy as well
2005-10-10T14:31:00.000Z	imc1	_jason	installed breezy, launched FF, went to vmware, clicked download and instead of the download mgr coming up I got an xml parsing error. Did the same at dell.com with a driver, same error
