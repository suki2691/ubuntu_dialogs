2009-05-20T00:44:00.000Z	Tommy\DO		how can i prevent ubuntu from recreating the default folders that i manually deleted (like ~/Music, ~/Pictures, etc...) every time it reboots?
2009-05-20T00:45:00.000Z	rangzy	Tommy\DO	I deleted the directories a few days back. they are not showing back here.
2009-05-20T00:46:00.000Z	rangzy	Tommy\DO	I use interpid. and I deleted from the cmdline
2009-05-20T00:47:00.000Z	Tommy\DO	rangzy	seems like only jaunty shows this annoying behaviour
