2005-03-17T07:32:00.000Z	DoppelGanger		oh and bulverseburrito you prob can run slack on thath comp
2005-03-17T07:32:00.000Z	knapjack	DoppelGanger	...but not the same apps
2005-03-17T07:35:00.000Z	knapjack	DoppelGanger	You can run Ubuntu on anything you can run Slackware on, but it's the app combination that matters.  bulverseburrito isn't going to be happy running GNOME 2.x on that box, no matter which distro.
