2008-06-13T08:00:00.000Z	IdleOne	Darlok_Williams	yes it should. there are several backup utils that need progress indicators
2008-06-13T08:01:00.000Z	Darlok_Williams	IdleOne	I'd have even been satisfied with a "Please Wait" dialog... but nope, it just shows every indication of having completely crashed.
2008-06-13T08:01:00.000Z	IdleOne	Darlok_Williams	yup I know
