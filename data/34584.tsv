2010-09-20T06:26:00.000Z	smegzor		Something is always running find on my 10.04 ubuntu.   Using htop, I notice that it is looking for mp3, ogg, wav, etc.  Is there an easy way to find out what is running find all the time?

2010-09-20T06:29:00.000Z	smegzor	rallias	thanks but that tells me nothing new.  I know find is always running and looking for music files.  I just don't know why.  I'm not running any media players (except vlc occasionally).
