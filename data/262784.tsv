2004-10-16T09:47:00.000Z	Tux_Rox		I have a small Ubuntu issue I can't seem to resolve. I don't get GDM loading after the system boots. I have to run startx. If I try to configure GDM, I'm told there is no such user. If I add gdm as I user I am required to give a home directory. Any advise?
2004-10-16T09:48:00.000Z	Tux_Rox		ok, nice to know. GDM is installed though. What in the init or X start up scripts should I modify to make GDM come up at boot?

2004-10-16T09:51:00.000Z	Tux_Rox	aitrus	EXACTLY! Doh!
