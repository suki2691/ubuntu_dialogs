2008-10-10T09:02:00.000Z	jsq	badfish	do you have xserver-xorg-input-joystick? i believe you need that.. at least i diid for alot of joystick games
2008-10-10T09:06:00.000Z	jsq	badfish	interesting, i can't find that file now :)
2008-10-10T09:10:00.000Z	jsq	badfish	honestly, i bet you will use js for awhile, then switch back.. it's my guess, fps are hard to control with joysticks
