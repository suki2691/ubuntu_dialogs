2010-09-30T02:08:00.000Z	Meraki		I started using Linux about a year ago and I am in love with it, I've been learning quite a bit about Linux as of late and I was wondering of a professional sysadmin could point me in the direction of a few good classes to take or books to read, so many out there I'd love to hear the opinion of someone who works with Linux for a living.
