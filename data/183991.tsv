2009-10-13T12:49:00.000Z	toomai	Flannel	but that doesnt actually solve the issue of v_v that there is no /etc/inittab anymore...where editing runlevel was easy as pie
2009-10-13T12:52:00.000Z	Flannel	toomai	Right, upstart changes that.  I believe /etc/event.d/ deals with it.  Or /etc/init/*
2009-10-13T12:52:00.000Z	Flannel	toomai	I'm on Hardy, where we still have inittab, so I can't verify.
