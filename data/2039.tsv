2012-07-12T00:38:00.000Z	bwat47	jlkkljh	you are just trying to boot from your usb drive?
2012-07-12T00:39:00.000Z	bwat47	jlkkljh	to do that open your bios's device menu and select the usb drive to boot from. most bios's have a key to open a simple boot menu, some you might have to go into the bios settings and change the boot loader that way. When you boot the pc the bios should tell you the correct key
