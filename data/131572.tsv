2007-06-07T11:57:00.000Z	computerjd		Hey, I've got a question for you guys.  I'm about to install Ubuntu (try to anyway).  The problem is, i have sata drives, and I know that I will need the drivers for this to install.  However, there are no linux drivers listed for my motherboard.  I have a GA-K8NSNXP.  My sata is SLI 3112/3512.  Any help is much appreciated.
