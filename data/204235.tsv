2005-12-16T10:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SoulPropagatio1	 yes. several programs can do that.. theres even wallpaper randomizer scripts out.
2005-12-16T10:46:00.000Z	SoulPropagatio1	Dr_Willis	what's the command?
2005-12-16T10:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SoulPropagatio1	 off hand i can think of... esetroot, bbsetroot, xv, xsetroot, and proberly a dozen other programs that can do that.
