2006-05-30T06:28:00.000Z	tomek_	amphi	sorry for being such a moron, but what exactly do i have to type: badblocks -what?
2006-05-30T06:29:00.000Z	amphi	tomek_	man badblocks - you want non-destructive, probably; if it's a recent drive, you'd probably be better off to use smartctl to run the drive's onboard diagnostics
