2011-04-09T14:47:00.000Z	bouma	s3r3n1t7	ok, im not talking about that. i just wondered if anyone knew if the start or end of a hdd was faster. i just benchmarked and got min 34meg/s vs 72meg/s max and need every bit of speed i can on a 512meg ram p4. im partitioning now so im trying to proceed with the install. but if nobody knows.. i did try googling first but didnt get anywhere
