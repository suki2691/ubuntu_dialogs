2008-12-10T20:57:00.000Z	reduz	ActionParsnip	but why a different app? it's supposed to be this one, i mean i go change the network to static IP and set everything fine, but the ip doesn't change when i close the window
2008-12-10T20:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	reduz	ive never used apps like that, i just set it with the config file (im old school)
