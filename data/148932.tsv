2008-01-27T05:38:00.000Z	filthpig		is there some way to convert an entire folder from flac to mp3? I have approx 100 gb with flac, so it would be nice to convert all of it without human interference...

2008-01-27T05:43:00.000Z	filthpig	unop	and that would be clean? All folders and subfolders and names copied?
