2010-01-17T23:29:00.000Z	AGoldstein		Question about Wubi Ubuntu: I installed Ubuntu on my Windows computer with the "Install Inside of Windows" option, but it had a lot of bugs, so I decided to uninstall it. Even after uninstalling it through the "Add/Remove Programs", every time i boot it still asks to load Ubuntu or Windows, even though i unninstalled it. How do i get that to go away?
