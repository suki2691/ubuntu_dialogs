2006-01-03T09:35:00.000Z	ph8		When my friend starts ubuntu he gets a nice little graphical screen where all the filesystem checks/network config/clock synchronisation that usually happens on startup appears (the usual about 20-30 lines of initiations) - on mine it's not graphical at all it's all just plain text, any ideas how to turn this feature on?
