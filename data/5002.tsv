2012-04-06T23:38:00.000Z	ArchInsomniac		I see a download for CD option for 12.04 but is there a USB version?
2012-04-06T23:38:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	ArchInsomniac	you load the iso to a usb
2012-04-06T23:39:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	ArchInsomniac	using a app to load like unetbootin or others, although that release is a hybrid can be loaded other ways as well.
