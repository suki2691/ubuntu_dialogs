2008-12-12T07:39:00.000Z	TecnoBrat		anyone able to tell me what exactly console-kit-daemon does?  It seems to use up to 50% of my CPU when I am doing CPU intensive things (like compiling)
2008-12-12T07:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	TecnoBrat	 Ive seen otehrs  with bugs/issues with that thing going berzerk also.
2008-12-12T07:41:00.000Z	TecnoBrat	dr_willis	yea, I've done some googling, and I can't seem to find a straight answer of what exactly its supposed to do for me :)
2008-12-12T07:43:00.000Z	TecnoBrat	dr_willis	hmmm it seems to have to do with fastswitching with gnome ..... I don't even have X installed on this particular machine .. haha
