2008-12-20T01:53:00.000Z	amine		Hello, I have a few questions about ubuntu - does it use the latest kernel or does it backport security patches to an old stable one? Also, do the repositories have cutting-edge releases or just old stable ones? (e.g. a new version of eclipse comes out, does it get released on the repositories after a few days or after a few weeks when deemed stable/secure)?
