2004-10-15T07:00:00.000Z	danc3		hello all, just booted Ubuntu for the first time, and I like it (I'm not a newcomer to Linux).  One question:  during the install, it never asked me to set the root password, and now how can I "su" to root in a terminal?  Is there a default root password?
2004-10-15T07:00:00.000Z	danc3		umm, ok
