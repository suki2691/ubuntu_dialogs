2011-10-24T09:42:00.000Z	esq		I sure do hope someone has seen the following issue and can give some advice on how to fix it... I installed Synaptic Package Manager from the terminal from some site for the top 10 tweaks for 11.10. However after installation once clicked, synaptic asks for a password and once you enter it and click autherize the screen dissappears immediately. Does any one have any idea how to fix this isses?
