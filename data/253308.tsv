2005-03-15T08:57:00.000Z	kent		I know its not an Ubuntu issue, but my computer has problems with overheating. At normal usage (browsing internet, playing music) i have no issues. But if i ran seti or other programs that uses the system alot, it overheats and shutdown. What would be the most rational to do? Should i buy a new CPU fan, or should i invest in one of those chassi-fans?
