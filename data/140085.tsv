2007-10-12T10:18:00.000Z	foug		is there a list of problems that are in 7.10 atm, unfixed ones?
2007-10-12T10:18:00.000Z	MasterShrek	foug	not really, its more case-by-case i guess,but so far 7.10 seems very stable to me
2007-10-12T10:19:00.000Z	foug	MasterShrek	good to hear, i'm interesting in switching now :)
2007-10-22T05:17:00.000Z	MasterShrek	foug	it should work, they probably just havent updated their list of supported distros since 7.10 just came out
