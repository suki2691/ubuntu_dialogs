2004-11-15T13:46:00.000Z	hmtr	Hikaru79	try the computer's id, it should work
2004-11-15T13:50:00.000Z	Hikaru79	hmtr	OK I tried the computer's name (which is 'administrator') and now it CLAIMS to see the printer but when I go to "Print a Test Page" it says the page has been sent to printer... but nothing happens :| It doesn't print...
2004-11-15T13:52:00.000Z	hmtr	Hikaru79	i'm going to try to setup my printer now. can i PM you?
