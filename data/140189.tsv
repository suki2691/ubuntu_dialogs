2011-05-31T23:16:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna		Does anyone here know of/know a solution to an issue w/ guake where every tab but the first is non-transparent (opaque)?  I'm having trouble finding anything pre-2009 and their solution was also to reinstall, which I've tried.
2011-05-31T23:18:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna		I of course suspect unity, but I actually like unity a lot and would prefer a workaround (or recommendation for another quake terminal.  I've tried tilda (no tabs?) and yakuake (massive kde dependencies))
2011-05-31T23:19:00.000Z	Pici	Shirakawasuna	guake perhaps?
2011-05-31T23:20:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	Pici	guake is the app with the bug :)
