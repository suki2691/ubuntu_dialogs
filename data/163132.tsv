2006-10-23T06:06:00.000Z	jdt_		Hi, who has any recommendations on the best way to setup a "very" secure ftp server using ubuntu dapper. . One that Microsoft clients can access over the net. So - using ssh / ssl etc. Pref one that requires not much config on the client end so that it is easier for them to use?
