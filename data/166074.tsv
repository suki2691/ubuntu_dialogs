2007-01-21T10:55:00.000Z	mikejanssen		it recognizes it just fine, just cant see any 'sync' options
2007-01-21T10:55:00.000Z	PirateHead	mikejanssen	I don't think syncing is built in, look at alternatives.
2007-01-21T10:56:00.000Z	PirateHead	mikejanssen	talisein: I've never used gtkpod, but honestly you could write a perl script that syncs an ipod and a music library pretty easily =D
