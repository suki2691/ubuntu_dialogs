2010-10-14T19:48:00.000Z	tensorpudding	drew212_	what is what you're trying to alias, exactly?
2010-10-14T19:49:00.000Z	tensorpudding	drew212_	you could either add the host to /etc/hosts, or make an entry in ~/.ssh/config
2010-10-14T19:55:00.000Z	tensorpudding	drew212_	does ping resolve the hostname to the correct IP?
