2008-09-10T06:54:00.000Z	cab938		Hi all, I'm not much of a linux guy, can someone explain to me what "pts" means?
2008-09-10T06:55:00.000Z	cab938		The context is in trying to understand this: "As the owner and user of the pts, simply allow others read/write access by chmodding it"

2008-09-10T06:57:00.000Z	cab938	Fondor1	I did, alas, it wasn't immediatly helpful.  I'll keep digging
