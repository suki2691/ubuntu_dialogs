2007-01-25T10:57:00.000Z	riotkittie	mwalsh	what problems might those be?
2007-01-25T10:57:00.000Z	mwalsh	riotkittie	they are numerous, and nasty.
2007-01-25T11:15:00.000Z	riotkittie	mwalsh	if you find it that bad, why are you still here? if you dont like it, you dont like it and that's fine but please bash it elsewhere
