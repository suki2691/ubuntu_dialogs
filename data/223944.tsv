2010-08-01T01:27:00.000Z	phaer	jimbo_	Read the source code. But the easy solution would be to read man xrandr for everything you'll need.
2010-08-01T01:28:00.000Z	jimbo_	phaer	I know enough about xrandr, just want to cheat and use gnome's computed values, which are ideal.
2010-08-01T01:30:00.000Z	jimbo_	phaer	actually I suppose `xrandr -q` shopuld give me everything I need after gnome sets things up, huh?
