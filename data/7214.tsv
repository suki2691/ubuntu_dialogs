2012-02-14T04:49:00.000Z	Canadian1296	trism	Okay I'll take a look
2012-02-14T04:49:00.000Z	trism	Canadian1296	you can always add /etc/motd.tail if you want it (I'm not sure what you are trying to do) 99-footer adds it
2012-02-14T04:50:00.000Z	Canadian1296	trism	I found the scripts, so I'll let you know what I find. Thanks :)
