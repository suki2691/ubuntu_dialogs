2010-03-11T03:43:00.000Z	Coppered		this may sound incredibly stupid.....but i would like my Ubuntu to look and feel as much like a Mac as possible...given that...i should install Ubuntu...or Kubunutu?
2010-03-11T03:43:00.000Z	[V13]Axel	Coppered	YOu want Ubuntu, and then google "Mac4Lin"
2010-03-11T03:43:00.000Z	[V13]Axel	Coppered	You're welcome. I'm currently using Mac4Lin, and it looks EXACTLY like Mac OSX Snow Leopard.
2010-03-11T03:44:00.000Z	[V13]Axel	Coppered	You're better off with Ubuntu. Kubuntu's desktop is... Meh.
