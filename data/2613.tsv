2012-06-11T13:21:00.000Z	potofcoffee		Hi. I'm on Unity-2D and the Alt+F2 shortcut is not working. Trying to set it in system settings -> keyboard -> shortcuts fails because, there it says "Disabled" and the word "Disabled" is italicized. Any ideas what to do?

2012-06-11T13:24:00.000Z	potofcoffee		That's what I want back.
