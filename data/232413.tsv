2008-03-13T00:52:00.000Z	bthornton		I'm running 32-bit Ubuntu and just recently upgraded to 4GB of memory. System Monitor is only reporting 3.2GB of memory (no surprise there). If I just upgrade my kernel to the AMD64 version, will that be enough to have all of my memory be recognized?
2008-03-13T00:53:00.000Z	bthornton		Or will I need to "upgrade" my entire OS to the 64-bit version?
