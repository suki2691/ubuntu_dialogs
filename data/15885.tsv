2011-06-10T13:26:00.000Z	Firefishe		I've recently downloaded the 64bit ubuntu 11.04 cd, but it doesn't want to boot.  I've tried compatibility mode in my bios, and that doesn't work.  The cd starts to boot, but it's always left hanging at the boot screen, with the ubuntu logo and the little dots blinking.  Nothing else happens

2011-06-10T13:27:00.000Z	KNUBBIG	Firefishe	yes
2011-06-10T13:29:00.000Z	Firefishe	KNUBBIG	How do I set up vbox to use the .iso image (32bit I'll probably have to d/l).
