2007-08-09T12:28:00.000Z	jonathan8di		Seems like a lot of space to loose, 5%!  It is in my extended partition, which also has fat32 partition next to it
2007-08-09T12:28:00.000Z	jonathan8di		Maybe that setup is bad?
2007-08-09T12:28:00.000Z	jonathan8di		I could merge the two partitions into one and just go w/out fat32
2007-08-09T12:29:00.000Z	astro76	jonathan8di	what's the problem?
