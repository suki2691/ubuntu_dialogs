2011-04-06T23:53:00.000Z	Primedeath		I was wondering if anyone here knew of a program that is able to turn a quick succession of a key into another keystroke?
2011-04-06T23:54:00.000Z	Primedeath		I use my laptop in my car regularly for music and don't want to do any combinations of keystrokes to change track/pause/random. I want a single tap of space to pause, two taps to go to next, and three to randomize.
