2007-06-09T13:51:00.000Z	Flannel	WillJitsu	Pidgin is still GAIM in Feisty, won't be pidgin until gutsy.
2007-06-09T13:52:00.000Z	WillJitsu	Flannel	oh ok so I can just install GAIM from the repositories and it's actually the latest Pidgin?
2007-06-09T13:52:00.000Z	Flannel	WillJitsu	no, Pidgin is v2.0 GAIM is last beta (beta 6) prior to the 2.0 release
