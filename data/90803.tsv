2008-05-13T15:44:00.000Z	Nevern		So if Ubuntu does not use common inits how do I set the service level at startup?
2008-05-13T15:45:00.000Z	jrib	Nevern	why do you need to edit inittab because you have an nvidia card?
2008-05-13T15:47:00.000Z	Nevern	jrib	because the NVidia drivers will not install without service levels being set to exclude X windows system running.
2008-05-13T15:48:00.000Z	jrib	Nevern	sure they will, you should be using System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers  to install them.  In any case, all the runlevels (2-5) in ubuntu/debian are identical by default and 2 is the default runlevel
