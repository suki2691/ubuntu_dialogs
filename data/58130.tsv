2010-01-16T15:11:00.000Z	diverse_izzue	loquitus	i think it is safe
2010-01-16T15:12:00.000Z	loquitus	diverse_izzue	but you know then about all the issues and are saying those problems are not prevelent anymore?
2010-01-16T15:13:00.000Z	loquitus	diverse_izzue	well I upgraded one machine and mid upgrade it gave an error and the machine was incapable of booting in anymore.
