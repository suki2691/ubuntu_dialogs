2009-11-27T13:46:00.000Z	Madpilot	Lostinspace_46	you know both chmod and chown can do resursive changes, right?
2009-11-27T13:47:00.000Z	Madpilot	Lostinspace_46	also, "leftover" sounds like a good way to delete something some other part of the system is still using. Are you that short of harddrive space?
