2007-07-08T14:25:00.000Z	DilfATX		Hi guys.. quick question.. I have seen this method done before.. but have not yet found out with Ubuntu Ulitmate.... How do I update my Ubuntu Fiesty to Ubuntu Ultimate (the new 1.4 version) through the terminal, i would like to avoid downloading an iso

2007-07-08T14:29:00.000Z	DilfATX	stefg	? ? ? What do you mean.. the old version of Ultimate was based on Ubuntu 6 and thus the easy upgrade.. your saying that this new version of Ultimate is not based on the new version of Ubuntu? or you just don't know?
