2008-07-30T23:52:00.000Z	jparishy		Hey, last night I was able to start a session in gnome and kde4, but this morning whenever i try to start a session using anything other than failsafe, it just freezes up, anyone have this problem before?

2008-07-30T23:53:00.000Z	jparishy	Flare183	i was thinking that, i think it's using gdm right now, i'll try switching to kdm
2008-07-30T23:53:00.000Z	Flare183	jparishy	 ok
