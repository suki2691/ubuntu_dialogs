2007-04-30T13:40:00.000Z	ibbuntu		hi, just tried to install swiftfox (32-bit) using automatix2. I am on Feisty and AMD64 and I think I've done something silly at some point as I get this error message: ./swiftfox-bin: error while loading shared libraries: libfreetype.so.6: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64
2007-04-30T13:41:00.000Z	ibbuntu		ok, I don't think my problem is related to automatix though
2007-04-30T13:43:00.000Z	ibbuntu		ok so it looks like I've said an evil word and won't get any help today. I will go back and try and reproduce the error with something other than automatix (which is why I tried using it in the first place) and I will come back with a reworded question).
2007-04-30T13:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	ibbuntu	are you running the 64bit version of Ubuntu, or 32bit?
