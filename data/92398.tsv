2008-08-06T05:14:00.000Z	snowveil		I am installing a new video card driver from Nvidia in hopes of getting my video card to work with Xandr Rotation, and need to exit X to install the driver
2008-08-06T05:14:00.000Z	snowveil		how do I exit X completely to get to just a terminal?

2008-08-06T05:15:00.000Z	snowveil	cwill747	, I've tried that, but it tells me that X is still running
