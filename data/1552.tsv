2012-08-16T03:21:00.000Z	cetigar		I want to buy a laptop with Ubuntu preinstalled.  Would you recommend http://zareason.com/shop/UltraLap-430.html, https://www.system76.com/laptops/model/lemu4, http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/19/dell-to-ship-xps-13-with-ubuntu-linux-in-some-areas/, or something else?
2012-08-16T03:23:00.000Z	cetigar		anyone have suggestions for ubuntu laptops?

2012-08-16T03:26:00.000Z	cetigar	bluezone	ok, thanks
