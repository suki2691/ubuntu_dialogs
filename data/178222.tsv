2008-06-28T00:17:00.000Z	MacGyverNL		I've got a Tecra 8200 here (128 MB Ram, unknow CPU (identifies itself as "GenuineIntel, x86 family 6 stepping 8 model 10))
2008-06-28T00:17:00.000Z	MacGyverNL		Is it wise to install Ubuntu on that?
2008-06-28T00:17:00.000Z	MacGyverNL		Or should I use a lighter distribution?
