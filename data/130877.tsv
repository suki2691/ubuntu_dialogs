2008-07-31T07:28:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Vampy	depends on the program.
2008-07-31T07:31:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Vampy	and wine won't run all applications.  there's also virtual machines, like virtual box (www.virtualbox.org)
2008-07-31T07:32:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Vampy	go to their web page.  there's an open source version in the repository (virtualbox-ose) but i recommend their compiled binaries
