2006-08-11T06:15:00.000Z	sethk	Perkins	mount (with no arguments) shows you what is currently mounted
2006-08-11T06:16:00.000Z	Perkins	sethk	 I tried that, it doesn't show up.  Does Ubuntu perchance fake the mounting somehow?
2006-08-11T06:17:00.000Z	sethk	Perkins	no, if it is mounted it will show up in the mount output, type smbfs
