2009-10-13T05:54:00.000Z	rpj8	LuisJa	I wouldn't know. I don't run a 64 bit system OR runescape.
2009-10-13T05:56:00.000Z	LuisJa	rpj8	My laptop supports 64amd, but i am not pretty sure abouyt the driver, can u help me?
2009-10-13T05:58:00.000Z	rpj8	LuisJa	I don't know. Like I said, I don't play runescape, use 64bit ubuntu, or knwo what you're saying when you say "driver" :)
