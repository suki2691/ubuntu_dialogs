2011-12-11T03:41:00.000Z	sburwood1		I've been trying to update my computer for the past 16 days.  I get packages upgraded, but the system tells me that there is a problem with a GPG key and that I haven't updated the packages for the past 16 days.  What do I need to do to resolve the problem?
2011-12-11T03:43:00.000Z	sburwood1		Anyone with an idea??
