2006-07-30T10:58:00.000Z	juan		Hi there
2006-07-30T11:00:00.000Z	juan		An easy question: rar doesn't accept wildcards (*.rar) Is there any way to pass all the files in a directory to it to unrar them using pipes ?
2006-07-30T11:00:00.000Z	gregg__	juan	you can make a loop using for: for i in *.rar: do unrar x "$i"; done
