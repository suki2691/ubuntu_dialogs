2012-01-22T04:39:00.000Z	acerimmer	mega2	need more info than that ...
2012-01-22T04:41:00.000Z	acerimmer	mega2	not an expert but I'm pretty sure that boot is failing because grub can't find the previous HD
2012-01-22T04:42:00.000Z	acerimmer	mega2	wrong.  you're ONLY installing the boot loader - no formatting/partitioning.  See this  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Reinstalling_GRUB2
