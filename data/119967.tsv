2010-06-18T15:52:00.000Z	maodun		This question isn't actually regarding an Ubuntu system, but I've found this channel to be useful for more generic Linux questions, so... I would like to record sound coming from my browser. How can I do this?
2010-06-18T15:52:00.000Z	maodun		I'm not even sure if I'm using PulseAudio or OSS. lsof shows me that chrome is using '/dev/snd/pcmC0D0p', which looks like PulseAudio to me, but I don't know where to go from there. Can anyone please help?
