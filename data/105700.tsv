2009-10-16T00:47:00.000Z	Whitor		Hi. I'm installing an application from CDROM, and the install software is asking me to insert disk two...  When I try and eject disk one, I get an error: Cannot unmount volume, An application is preventing the volume '' from being unmounted. ok.  ... If I tru and sudo unmount /dev/cdrom I too get an error... How can I move forward with this install ?
