2011-12-30T22:59:00.000Z	Deltatash		I wonder if anyone can help me with a problem I have. I am trying to burn some files to disc using Brasero and when I click burn it instantly ejects my disc and says "Error while burning, Some files have invalid names" I then have an option to save the log. I save the log and read it it mentiones invalid names but does not exactly say what are the invalid names it does nolt make sense to me :s
