2007-06-04T16:46:00.000Z	liquiddoom		I'm trying to setup my ubuntu server as a router with an NAT firewall. Know of any software which would help? All the software I find is for actual routers or is its own distro. Should I just run one in VMware?

2007-06-04T16:48:00.000Z	liquiddoom	stefg	But I really wanna keep it as light as possible
