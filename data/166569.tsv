2007-05-27T16:53:00.000Z	wols_	Flying-Penguin	yes. glcgears is not a benchmark
2007-05-27T16:53:00.000Z	Flying-Penguin	wols_	heh, it was way back in the day I first started linux sorry =/
2007-05-27T16:53:00.000Z	wols_	Flying-Penguin	glxinfo is the proper way to check. and -fps is what you want from glxgears
