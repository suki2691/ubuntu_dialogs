2007-10-20T04:02:00.000Z	markt9		Greetings, I'm not a seasoned IRC user, but I'm having problems with my desktop after upgrading to 7.10 today.  After a successful upgrade, when I reboot and enter my logon name and password, I hear the drums and get the new wallpaper, but the application bar menu on the top of the screen won't drop down and I can't click on anything.  I tried dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and that didn't seem to make any difference.  x does seem fine,

2007-10-20T04:03:00.000Z	markt9		should I reconfigure gnome-panel?
