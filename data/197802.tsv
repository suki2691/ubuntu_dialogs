2006-02-25T06:01:00.000Z	peej_	elkbuntu	tsk. He was far too sensitive. I gave him good, honest advice that would help him.
2006-02-25T06:03:00.000Z	elkbuntu	peej_	it was hardly a respectful way of doing it. he indicated himself that the wizard reference in his name was nothing to do with this. you havent gone off at me for playing pun on the name ubuntu, when i certainly dont know all about it
2006-02-25T06:06:00.000Z	peej_	elkbuntu	your point is taken. I will try to be less acerbic with nicks that make me wince in future.
