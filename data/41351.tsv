2009-12-06T06:46:00.000Z	SeattleOtaku	S0LIDUS	are you looking for n-only?  I connect with one in b/g/n mode.
2009-12-06T06:47:00.000Z	S0LIDUS	SeattleOtaku	I have a connection in G, but I would rather it where in -N.
2009-12-06T06:54:00.000Z	SeattleOtaku	S0LIDUS	What does 'lspci' show as your Wireless controller?  Can't tell further here, as mine's an Intel a/b/g.
2009-12-06T06:56:00.000Z	S0LIDUS	SeattleOtaku	My driver is meant to be supported but does not work with -N!
