2007-08-11T13:13:00.000Z	astro76	ParaDoX34690	you can force fsck on next boot by doing sudo touch /forcefsck
2007-08-11T13:13:00.000Z	astro76	ParaDoX34690	then restart
2007-08-11T13:14:00.000Z	ParaDoX34690	astro76	Thanks... I think I'll just stay away from that then, but seriously, thank you anyways....
