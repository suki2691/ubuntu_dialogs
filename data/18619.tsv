2012-09-07T15:50:00.000Z	Nordom		I am thinking clean install ubuntu over my win7 is this wise? Or is better to duel boot?
2012-09-07T15:50:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Nordom	 dual boot, in case you don't like ubuntu or need win7
2012-09-07T15:52:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Nordom	 clean install on its own partition
2012-09-24T11:14:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Nordom	 there's also ccsm, compiz-config
