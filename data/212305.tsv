2006-10-22T15:59:00.000Z	Keyseir		I was running apt-get dist-upgrade and it gave me an option to review the differences between the old modified file and the new maintained file. I got done reading the log but I don't know how to go back to the installation... I've got a blackened (END) at the prompt.
2006-10-22T15:59:00.000Z	Keyseir		How do I get back to installation?
2006-10-22T15:59:00.000Z	Erwin	Keyseir	you are in less. press q.
2006-10-22T16:00:00.000Z	Erwin	Keyseir	less is a replacement for more (a pager, that lets you review the output of some long command)
