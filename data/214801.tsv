2006-06-18T10:27:00.000Z	mnishizawa		I just upgraded a machine to dapper and my wireless card has stopped getting an ip from the router... I get signal from the router, my network info has not changed, but no ip address

2006-06-18T10:30:00.000Z	mister_roboto	mnishizawa	i had the exact same problem. i never could get it to work until i reinstalled dapper from scratch. it was like the updated dapper was using some old info from breezy or something. never did figure out how to get the upgrade working. the upgrade didn't work but booting from the live cd worked fine.  <shrug>
