2011-10-18T22:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kimi_tesal	you can set interfaces to dhcp (address only) in network manager and manually define DNS servers
2011-10-18T22:04:00.000Z	kimi_tesal	ActionParsnip	i try it. the same think. there is no another possiblity to change the dns excepti gui of newtork manager?
2011-10-18T22:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kimi_tesal	you can use other apps or purely use interfaces and resolv.conf. I advise this on desktop systems on wired connection
