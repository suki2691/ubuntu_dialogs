2009-03-26T16:03:00.000Z	ziroday	tyson_	if there is a newer version in the repo's then yes, otherwise nope
2009-03-26T16:04:00.000Z	tyson_	ziroday	right I was just making sure it was not like if you compile something by hand and then the package manager doesnt see it,  thanks
2009-03-26T16:04:00.000Z	ziroday	tyson_	yep the pacakge manager will see it, and you can remove it from there
