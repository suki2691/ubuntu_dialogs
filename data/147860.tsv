2007-01-25T17:01:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	kupesoft	it's okay.  really it is.  I don't know what it is...but it's okay :)
2007-01-25T17:02:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	kupesoft	no problem!  what are we encouraging you for?  trying to install Kubuntu on a 486?  from experience, it won't work :D
2007-02-09T13:16:00.000Z	AWOSDev7360	kupesoft	you have to specifically request that those packages be upgraded.
