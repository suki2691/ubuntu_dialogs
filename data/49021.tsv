2012-03-16T01:35:00.000Z	osse		I love Ubuntu One, but at work I use RHEL5 most of the time. Is there any reasonable way to access my Ubuntu One account from RHEL5 except for the web interface?
2012-03-16T01:36:00.000Z	guntbert	osse	I suggest you ask in #ubuntuone
2012-03-16T01:40:00.000Z	osse	guntbert	thanks. I didn't know it had its own channel. But perhaps I should have.
2012-03-16T01:40:00.000Z	guntbert	osse	no problem :)
