2010-07-08T03:24:00.000Z	lfitz		i would like to run 2.6.34
2010-07-08T03:26:00.000Z	slidinghorn	lfitz	open synaptic and search for linux-headers   find the one you want and mark for installation
2010-07-08T03:27:00.000Z	slidinghorn	lfitz	however the one you want isn't available in the repos (i just looked) you'll have to compile from its source
