2009-02-19T03:28:00.000Z	Chronosphear		hi, i'm getting "WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!" when trying to install new apps with apt-get. I've already looked on google and tried install debian-archive-keyring and debian-keyring but the problem remains. There's also no mention of any useful logging features in man apt-get to see why it's failing. could someone offer any advice on this?
2009-02-19T03:30:00.000Z	Chronosphear		anyone?
2009-02-19T03:31:00.000Z	Chronosphear		i did ask my real question it was ignored
