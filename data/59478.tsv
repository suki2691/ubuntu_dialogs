2009-05-03T11:16:00.000Z	T_T_T_		Hey, I'm new to ubuntu and trying to figure something out. I'm at my girlfriends place, and she has a wireless network set up, and an external harddrive set up to it. I have successfully connected to the wireless network, but am unable of how to find the external harddrive. Anyone have any ideas?
