2005-10-12T13:18:00.000Z	HappyFool	Ofe	maybe the stuff in the lm-sensors package?
2005-10-12T13:20:00.000Z	Ofe	HappyFool	does lm-sensors package come with default installation or do I have to install it separately?
2005-10-12T13:20:00.000Z	HappyFool	Ofe	it's not installed on my system; i don't think it's installed by default
