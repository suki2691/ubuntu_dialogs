2007-05-29T14:08:00.000Z	Hawkins		Anybody here who could help me with insane Xorg CPU usage which is also described by another user here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=236083&highlight=high+idle+cpu+usage
2007-05-29T05:41:00.000Z	Hawkins		Does anyone have ideas why my Ubuntu is a massive CPU-user. Idling on desktop uses 4%, moving mouse gets it to 8% and opening a menu gives me 12% CPU usage and so on. Can't be normal (at least I hope so)

2007-05-29T05:42:00.000Z	Hawkins	kritzstapf	it's Xorg which uses most of the juice
