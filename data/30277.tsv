2012-07-09T23:04:00.000Z	tomswartz07	genii-around	hm. i figured as much. is it able to be edited?
2012-07-09T23:06:00.000Z	genii-around	tomswartz07	Almost not certainly by inserting them directly into the bios. But it is conceivable to use a hex editor on the bios .bin file and maybe look for that string, change it there, etc, reflash. I'm not sure it's such a good idea however.
