2008-04-23T22:39:00.000Z	elventear		Hello. I am migrating a  IPSEC connection from an old OpenBSD box to Ubuntu. OpenBSD uses isakmpd for IPSEC while, it seems to me, on Linux the KAME implementation is more popular. But there is isakmpd on Linux. So I was wondering if any of you guys might have a suggestion why I should use one or the other? For now I suppose that by using isampd on Linux would allow me to transfer everything verbatim from the OpenBSD box
