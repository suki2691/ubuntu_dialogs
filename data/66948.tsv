2009-02-07T07:06:00.000Z	shawnmstout		xon, yes unplug and replace
2009-02-07T07:07:00.000Z	xonpathos	shawnmstout	yeah... but every time I shutdown/restart?
2009-02-07T07:09:00.000Z	xonpathos	shawnmstout	it's actually a bug first reported in 2005, I'm just hoping someone knows some fix I can't find...  I find it hard to believe such a crippling bug has gone uncorrected for 4 years
