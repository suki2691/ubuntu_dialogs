2010-01-02T02:05:00.000Z	karleeto		i have just setup an nfs share on my server, and i have it working here on my laptop, but my question is: how come if i mount a cd or a pendrive or whatever, even a windows share, it adds a thing to the desktop where i can unmount it or access it easily
2010-01-02T02:05:00.000Z	karleeto		well, i would like for my nfs share to do the same thing
2010-01-02T02:05:00.000Z	karleeto		can i accomplish this?
