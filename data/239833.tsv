2008-01-12T07:57:00.000Z	nickrud	javatexan	you would have to compile it, a sec & I'll give you a couple of links
2008-01-12T07:59:00.000Z	nickrud	javatexan	hm, I'm not finding the pages I expected
2008-01-12T08:02:00.000Z	nickrud	javatexan	the best info I have for you is that alsa 1.0.15 is going to be in hardy, you can ask about it in #ubuntu+1
