2012-03-02T11:15:00.000Z	hopstafarian	Django_Novice	what command are you trying to schedule?
2012-03-02T11:34:00.000Z	hopstafarian	Django_Novice	also , if you add the line <username> ALL=NOPASSWD:[TAB] ALL into your /etc/sudoers file, in will let you run cron jobs that normally start with 'sudo' and wait for a password...but like, i say i'm no expert, and am not sure if that's a gaping security vulnerability or not..
2012-03-02T11:38:00.000Z	hopstafarian	Django_Novice	note: [TAB] is meant to represent the actual 'tab' key, and shouldn't be carried...be VERY careful with the /etc/sudoers file...type slow, and double check your work..it's very easy to create a significant bump in the road for yourself with this one..better safe than sorry...
