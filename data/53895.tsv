2009-06-29T18:27:00.000Z	xteejx	igneousquill	report a bug against this please
2009-06-29T18:28:00.000Z	igneousquill	xteejx	I will later today.  I guess this means there's no fix.
2009-06-29T18:28:00.000Z	xteejx	igneousquill	havent a clue tbh, have you goolgled around and searched on launchpad for a workaround? when is it failing, at what part?
