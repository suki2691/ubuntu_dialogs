2008-02-23T00:02:00.000Z	luislo		Hi all. I apologize for the many times some of you have heard my problem. The thing is, I was a happy suse user until it unfortunately occurred to me to upgrade my BIOS. After that, my music (sound card hda) sounded like "scratched cds" and my wireless card is detected but it doesn't recognize my wireless network. This coincided with a suse update, so some of you suggested me to make a clean install. I have made 3 clean installs

All of them had the aforementioned problem (the installation process was even hung in ubuntu). The thing is, after every clean installed I've made in the past, suse was perfect. So the only thing that have changed is the BIOS... and I don't think the issue is a defective harware because everything still works
2008-02-23T00:02:00.000Z	luislo		perfect in windows... so I don't know what to do guys. Please I'd really appreciate any help. Now I want to install ubuntu, but the installlation cd (7.04) doesn't seem to work and the media check says it is just fine. Just right after getting to the desktop, I can't pass an orange-pink screen... it just stays in there... and I can't move the cursor, but in a totally orange pink screen....
