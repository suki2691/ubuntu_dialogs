2008-01-15T07:46:00.000Z	Elevator_Hazard		Hey I'd hate to interrupt any conversations but I have a possibly quick question: I recently installed ubuntu and I'm running it now... But my screen res is at 800x600 and at startup it says that it can't find info on monitor or graphics card, and I can't fix that.
