2006-01-21T06:51:00.000Z	johnblade		I have a minor issue, i have setup mythtv on ubuntu and everything is going great - just one minor issue i have is that if I leave the machine for too long it goes into a blank screen
2006-01-21T06:51:00.000Z	johnblade		I have disabled the screensavers, it seems to be some type of energy saver thing.  Any idea what it could be ?
