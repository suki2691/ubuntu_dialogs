2008-06-26T12:58:00.000Z	AmirB		Hi, I dual boot Vista and Ubuntu and I wanted to add XP as well, and I was wondering if I could partition my drive in such a way to share it between the OS's?
2008-06-26T13:00:00.000Z	AmirB		narcissus: hmm, that sounds good. can all three OS's access that partition though? and how? and what is the risk? (why is it a bad idea?)
2008-06-26T13:01:00.000Z	AmirB		hmm
2008-06-26T13:01:00.000Z	Jester45	AmirB	if y ou use fat you can access with all three and the only risk is getting a virus on one windows and passing it to the other but linux will be fine
