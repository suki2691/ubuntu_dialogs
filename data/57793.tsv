2009-05-13T23:03:00.000Z	Cryptic_Donkey	FrankQC	Netstat -rn will show you your routing table in numaric form
2009-05-13T23:04:00.000Z	FrankQC	Cryptic_Donkey	: Yeah but it won't tell me the other computers on the network
2009-05-13T23:05:00.000Z	Cryptic_Donkey	FrankQC	Palces Network should tell you thnames of the other nodes on your network or you might have to configure a hosts file,
