2012-06-09T19:34:00.000Z	sharkmap		Hi all, just upgraded my PC with new cpu/mb/memory and ubuntu 12.04 64bit is running like a champ. I checked with google, and it said everything should be good to go with no reinstall. Can someone verify that or tell me it there's anything I still need to do please? Thanks.

2012-06-09T19:35:00.000Z	sharkmap	Seveas	thanks! I am just overthinking I guess.
2012-06-09T19:36:00.000Z	Seveas	sharkmap	yeah, apt-get source libreoffice and build the package. Should give it a good stresstest :)
