2005-10-13T13:57:00.000Z	calc	Yetr2	you can probably throttle the bandwidth via iptables to the site that apt is downloading from
2005-10-13T13:58:00.000Z	calc	Yetr2	not sure if you can throttle the app itself directly though
2005-10-13T13:58:00.000Z	calc	Yetr2	most network apps outside of p2p apps don't have throttle support
