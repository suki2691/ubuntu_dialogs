2005-12-09T17:18:00.000Z	Raskall		but I run hd-backup every night of /home, /var, /usr/local and /etc.
2005-12-09T06:56:00.000Z	Raskall		hmm.. I am setting up NFS mounting over my 802.11b-wlan. The mount itself takes looooong time. I haven't tried I/O on the mounts yet, but guess that will hang to. What are the best options to have for nfs over wlan?
2005-12-09T06:58:00.000Z	mgedmin	Raskall	I use NFS over WiFi with no special options
2005-12-09T06:58:00.000Z	Raskall	mgedmin	ok.. maybe try with just the defaults, then?
