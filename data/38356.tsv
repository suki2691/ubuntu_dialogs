2010-01-31T06:23:00.000Z	Trizicus		My graphics performance compared to windows is very bad in Linux. For example java performance is halfed in comparison to Windows. I have latest nVidia drivers installed as well. Does anyone have any suggestions?

2010-01-31T06:25:00.000Z	Trizicus	archboxman	Ok I just wanted to be sure i have the 'best' perf allowed to me by closed source devs...
2010-01-31T06:25:00.000Z	archboxman	Trizicus	usually my nvidia card runs hot have two fans in case for just this???
