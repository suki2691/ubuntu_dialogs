2008-05-16T05:07:00.000Z	ratpoison	martianlobste1	try searching synaptic for gethostname, or google it
2008-05-16T05:09:00.000Z	martianlobste1	ratpoison	ok I just did that, no luck.
2008-05-16T05:10:00.000Z	martianlobste1	ratpoison	  a google on  "man gethostname"  gives me what I want, but it would be nice to havve the docs on my local machine
