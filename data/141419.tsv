2007-08-07T08:24:00.000Z	ubuntu_		Hi, this is level1.  I'm having a lot of trouble with my computer, randomly hanging, refusing to boot.  I found this error over and over in my dmesg:reading i2c device failed (error=-71)
2007-08-07T08:25:00.000Z	ubuntu_		I'm also seeing this error a lot: [   26.550433]  msp3400 0-0044: I/O error #0 (write 0x12/0x04)
