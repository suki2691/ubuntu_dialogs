My ubuntu 10.10 64bit most of the times can't browse the internet, can't download updates but is getting a network connection to ISP, settings are default from install, DHCP, not PPPOE, no routers, connected straight to DSL modem. The MS Windows is working. I tried deleting old network settings and adding new one, again connected to ISP but still cant use internet. Can someone
