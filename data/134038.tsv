2007-05-21T09:54:00.000Z	mobutu	vikzx86	you could somehow figure out what package this mysterious 'extra fonts' thing was from automatix, and remove it with apt-get remove --purge packagename
2007-05-21T09:55:00.000Z	vikzx86	mobutu	I cant get Ubuntu to boot properly, there is a x windows error..
2007-05-21T09:56:00.000Z	mobutu	vikzx86	look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log
