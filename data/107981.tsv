I know there are a few out there but I'm not sure which one would work best with my iPod Touch.  I'm just looking to transfer music and videos.  I don't care about access to the iTunes store.  Anyone out there have an iPod Touch working with Ubuntu?

I found three packages that show promise...gpodder, gtkpod, and tripod. gtkpod scrambled my nano on first access so I had to use the itunes software to restore it to factory settings. I don't have pictures so haven't tried tripod, and gpodder didn't see the ipod even though gtkpod did
