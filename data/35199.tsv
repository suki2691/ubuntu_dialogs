2010-03-27T20:08:00.000Z	hamush		does anyone know of a way (besides looking in xorg.conf) to tell what xorg video driver is in use? xdpyinfo and xvinfo won't tell me... any other ides?
2010-03-27T20:09:00.000Z	acicula	hamush	glxinfo or the xorg log file?
2010-03-27T20:09:00.000Z	hamush	acicula	log file! i'll try that route... thanks for the tip!
