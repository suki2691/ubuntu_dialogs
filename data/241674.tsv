2005-04-26T08:32:00.000Z	Reblended	dcraven	is it true when you copy the .ttf's you have to sudo?
2005-04-26T08:32:00.000Z	dcraven	Reblended	not if you put them in ~/.fonts... That's your home dir.
2005-04-26T08:33:00.000Z	Reblended	dcraven	hmm. I heard that font's wont install unless you are superuser...
