2007-08-10T07:26:00.000Z	jonathon		Need help with installing flash player using the terminal. New to Ubuntu.
2007-08-10T07:27:00.000Z	taxman	jonathon	have you read up on how to enable the right repositories?
2007-08-10T07:28:00.000Z	taxman	jonathon	no problem, I'll teach you how to fish :)  Look up how to enable the extra repositories (it's much easier if you don't use the terminal) then do sudo apt-cache search flash
2007-08-10T07:30:00.000Z	taxman	jonathon	that will give you a list of installable packages that have flash. You need to pick the right one. Best bet is to read the docs at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UserDocumentation   search for words like flash, and read the common questions document
