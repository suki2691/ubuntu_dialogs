2006-01-23T12:10:00.000Z	setuid		I just did a clean Hoary install, started up X, GNOME'y things start to load, and then X just sits there for about 20 minutes on the "Nautilus" part when its loading in the little progress panel.
2006-01-23T12:10:00.000Z	setuid		Wtf?
2006-01-23T12:11:00.000Z	setuid		Anyone?
2006-01-23T12:12:00.000Z	novaaa	setuid	maybe start X with verbosity and find out what exactly sits ?
