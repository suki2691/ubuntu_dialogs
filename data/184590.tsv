2008-02-21T04:29:00.000Z	Takatski		Hey ive got a question, i'm trying to install Ubuntu right (first timer) and i was following along a guide, but it says i cant install on an NTFS partition, is linux compatible with a FAT32? and can i install linux on a portable harddrive?
2008-02-21T04:30:00.000Z	Takatski		not to mention the ubuntu installer wouldnt let me resize my partition, which im assuming is due to the fact that its NTFS in this first place
