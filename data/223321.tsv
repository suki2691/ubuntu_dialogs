2006-04-17T05:32:00.000Z	natesmith		hey, right now i have a dual-boot XP and ubuntu PC an 2 hard disks, but I'd like to remove windows and install ubuntu on the main hard disk, so that it runs using both hard disks. How will this work? How do I format each and once I've done it how will I access each disk?
2006-04-17T05:34:00.000Z	natesmith		do I format the second drive using LVM?
2006-04-17T05:35:00.000Z	CookedGryphon	natesmith	you can set the other hard drive as a mount point
