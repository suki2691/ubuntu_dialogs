2010-05-29T06:31:00.000Z	mikelifeguard		What tools exist for making HTML websites on ubuntu (like Dreamweaver)?
2010-05-29T06:31:00.000Z	Ken1	mikelifeguard	There isn't really a dreamweaver equivalent as far as I know. I did use BlueFish and thought it was good.
2010-05-29T06:33:00.000Z	mikelifeguard	Ken1	thanks, I'll give it a try
2010-05-29T06:33:00.000Z	Ken1	mikelifeguard	Sure, glad to help.
