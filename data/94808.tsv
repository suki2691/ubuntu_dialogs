2008-08-26T12:14:00.000Z	Kohlrak	s3a	sounds like a virtual box error
2008-08-26T12:16:00.000Z	s3a	Kohlrak	o ya now no more error message all it does is show me windows xp loading then the window just disapears as if i clsoed it
2008-08-26T12:16:00.000Z	s3a	Kohlrak	like it has the fading effect of wen i actually close windows too
2008-08-26T12:17:00.000Z	Kohlrak	s3a	so now the vm crashes? try running from terminal and maybe that'll give you a clue... (personally i prefer vmware, not sure i used what you're using)
