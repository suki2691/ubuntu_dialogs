2011-02-20T08:00:00.000Z	Aikar		can someone please lead me to an idea on how to make flash stop completely deadlocking my kernel :( no logs, tried every ver of flash, tried reinstalling nvidia drivers, chrome, firefox, hardware accel, non accel, cleared .adobe and .macromedia home folders. nothing has helped. flash vid randomly deadlocks entire system and absolutely no log is written to /var/log
