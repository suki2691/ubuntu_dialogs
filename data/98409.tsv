2008-03-09T15:49:00.000Z	steel_lady		is there some program to split audio files???
2008-03-09T15:49:00.000Z	steel_lady		I want to cut out a refrain of one mp3 and have it as a separate file
2008-03-09T15:51:00.000Z	steel_lady		it says it can not install it because it depends on libraries that are not installable
2008-03-09T15:52:00.000Z	greasy_leftwing	steel_lady	try wavbreaker maybe?
