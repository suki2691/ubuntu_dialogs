2005-07-11T07:56:00.000Z	bddebian	Trace	What type of info?
2005-07-11T07:58:00.000Z	bddebian	Trace	You won't get the motherboard "Make" from anything if thatis what you mean
2005-07-11T08:00:00.000Z	bddebian	Trace	You might be able to get chipset type information from lspci or /proc but it won't say "Intel DE815"
