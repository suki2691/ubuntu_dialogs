2008-06-12T12:43:00.000Z	Sid		My friend was asking if he should switch to Fedora 9 or wait for OpenSUSE 11 for his home computer, any suggestions?
2008-06-12T12:43:00.000Z	HardDisk	Sid	try them all
2008-06-12T12:44:00.000Z	Sid	HardDisk	What if he was stuck on an island with only one writable CD and both the ISOs?
2008-06-12T12:44:00.000Z	HardDisk	Sid	use a vm environment
