2011-05-13T22:16:00.000Z	fosa__		Hello, I am using 11.04 when I tried to enable Desktob Cube it asked me to enable "Composite" and "OpenGL" plugins, I said yes but since, all title bars are missing.
2011-05-13T22:17:00.000Z	fosa__		I tried to enable "Windows Decoration" plugin as I found out in forums but that didn't work.
2011-05-13T22:17:00.000Z	fosa__		Any help please?
