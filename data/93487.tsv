2008-04-26T05:07:00.000Z	otarid	MattJ	I do :(
2008-04-26T05:10:00.000Z	MattJ	otarid	What was the wifi error you had? (guessing you have one by your smiley face :) )
2008-04-26T05:12:00.000Z	otarid	MattJ	I don't know what the error is, it just doesn't seem to be detecting any wireless network (and the wireless on/off button doesn't seem to work anymore)
