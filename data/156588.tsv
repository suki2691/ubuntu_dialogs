2007-10-09T11:07:00.000Z	jeroen-AFK		only thing with RPM's is the fact that you have to install the dependencies yourself
2007-10-09T11:08:00.000Z	jeroen-AFK		well it's possible to install RPM's.........but, why bother?
2007-10-09T11:09:00.000Z	riotkittie	jeroen-AFK	because people equate "compile from source" with "get eaten by bear" :|
