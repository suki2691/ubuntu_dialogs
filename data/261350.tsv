2005-12-27T15:47:00.000Z	jave		I'm trying to use smbmount in ubuntu, I just installed.. but it doesn't seem to be available
2005-12-27T15:47:00.000Z	jave		How do I acquire it?
2005-12-27T15:48:00.000Z	jave		What is the default pass for root anyway? I can do sudo by using the same password as I set for my normal user, but "su root" doesnt work with the same password
