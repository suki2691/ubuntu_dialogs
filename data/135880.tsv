2007-06-22T12:13:00.000Z	SoulChild		is there a way to save the whole boot output into a file ?
2007-06-22T12:15:00.000Z	_Ahti	SoulChild	What kind of error? Not all errors are deadly :P
2007-06-22T12:16:00.000Z	SoulChild	_Ahti	that's the problem,... i can't read it, since my computer boots so fast
2007-06-22T12:17:00.000Z	_Ahti	SoulChild	Assuming that since your here, the boot went fine... Therefore, as i said before. Not all errors are "important" :)
