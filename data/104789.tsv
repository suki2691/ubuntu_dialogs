It was so nice to simply restart x as opposed to restarting the whole frickin' machine.  What I want to know is what caused it to go buggy though?

2008-07-10T18:40:00.000Z	compilerwriter	ActionParsnip	restarting X after closing all of the apps seems to have fixed the issue.
2008-07-10T18:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	compilerwriter	id reboot then but im sure theres a better way
