I started off wiht a ~10GB partition, it's now down to 4GB free even though I haven't installed many packages. Somebody reccomended I do "sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb" to remove cached .debs, but what's causing all this bloat?

2008-02-16T06:54:00.000Z	Jorophose	hobbs	will the command I was given still be useful? or will it mess up my install somehow?
