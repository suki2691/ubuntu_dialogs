2008-01-21T09:53:00.000Z	Michael133		got a question. I have dual monitors and I'm running Ubuntu 7.03 x86, (MSI) nVidia NX7100GS Video card, I installed the driver from the "Restricted Drivers Manager" and I see no controls allowing me to adjust settings for multiple monitors..
2008-01-21T09:54:00.000Z	nickrud	Michael133	I think you can run   nvidia-settings
2008-01-21T09:55:00.000Z	nickrud	Michael133	yes
2008-01-21T09:56:00.000Z	nickrud	Michael133	out of curiosity, could you check if there's a way to run that from system->admin menu?
