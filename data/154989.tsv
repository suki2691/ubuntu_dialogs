2007-06-12T07:26:00.000Z	jesus		I'm trying to get my tv-out working (nVidia FX 5200), setting up modes like "1600x1200,640x480" does not make the computer display in 1600x1200 and the tv in the other, but instead changes the computer to display 2240x1200 so it extends the desktop in such a way that the tv displays something out of the (to the computer) visible desktop range.
2007-06-12T07:26:00.000Z	jesus		Any one know of whats wrong? or where I can get help?
