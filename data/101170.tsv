2008-02-07T09:33:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Invisible_Ubunti	gtk themes are what the widgets look like, the splash screen shows between logging in and when trhe desktop is loaded, and the GDM theme is what the login screen looks like
2008-02-07T09:35:00.000Z	Invisible_Ubunti	Starnestommy	So Splash is what normally shows all the things loading before it gets to the desktop,  GTK is that what is like a Windows Theme controls Window Color's/Fonts/Etc, while GDM theme is the login screen where I type user/pass?
