2007-05-24T09:29:00.000Z	techjim		Quick q:  when I remove a package, sometimes a list comes up listing packages that were installed and no longer needed.  How does ubuntu tell? Dependencies?  Is it wise to autoremove?
2007-05-24T09:30:00.000Z	techjim		defrysk; dr_willis: it seems like a good idea but their are like 20 progs that came with screenlets.  I guess it's safe.
