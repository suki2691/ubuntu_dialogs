2009-02-21T10:57:00.000Z	jstew		Hey, I just installed 8.10 on a system and I'm getting /dev/sda1 does not exist, dropping to shell. Any hints? The install went fine, the live CD runs fine, and I was just running arch on this same machine for months.
2009-02-21T10:59:00.000Z	jstew		Ubuntu is starting to piss me off more and more with each release. Seems like I have many more issues than I used to.
2009-02-21T10:59:00.000Z	jstew		I hope so..,... yeah, and I agree
2009-02-21T10:59:00.000Z	hmw	jstew	- i dont like 8.10 very much either. 8.04 is the best ubuntu these days, IMHO
