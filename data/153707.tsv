2007-06-13T15:54:00.000Z	Nicholas		Hi all, I have messed up my ubuntu and wish to reinstall the operating system. I have the live cd in the drive but  my computer still loads the old copy on the HD regardless of the fact I have it set to boot for the CD drive. How can I load the Live cd instead of the local ubuntu
