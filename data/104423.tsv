2011-03-07T11:50:00.000Z	Keshava		Hi,
2011-03-07T11:50:00.000Z	Keshava		I have a problem clipboard sharing (copy / paste problem) with Remote Desktop Connection when i connect to a VNC server, I am not able to copy selected text from my remote machine to my local machine (where as the other way round is possible)...
2011-03-07T11:50:00.000Z	Keshava		Has anyone faced similar problems ?
2011-03-07T11:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Keshava	I've heard vino cannot do it but other vnc servers can
