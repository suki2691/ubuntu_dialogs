2008-04-28T09:33:00.000Z	josiah		I'm having some serious issues with the official Hardy release. I'm running it on a dual-core AMD 64bit laptop with 3GB of ram. It lags severely when any process is dominant. Anyone know why?
2008-04-28T09:35:00.000Z	josiah		I experience lag when a browser is loading a website, or when Transmission is pulling down torrents, or really when any process is running.
2008-04-28T09:36:00.000Z	josiah		will the 32 bit distro of Hardy run on my AMD laptop??
2008-04-28T09:36:00.000Z	Maxdamantus	josiah	yes.
