2010-08-25T15:55:00.000Z	Slart	jadoe	hmm, same one here.. it fails on all windows or only on some?
2010-08-25T15:55:00.000Z	Slart	jadoe	or wait.. it's supposed to keep windows from even being in the same area as the dock?
2010-08-25T15:57:00.000Z	Slart	jadoe	ah.. now I see.. I'll have to change my previous statement.. it doesn't work when I put the dock on the sides.. it does work on the bottom.. my bad
