2007-07-28T13:09:00.000Z	Jimdb		any advice on retaining my system configuration when I upgrade my mobo?  I'm upgrading the mobo from a nforce4 939 athlon to nforce 590 socket am2 with an athlon 6000+? is there a way to do this without having to start all over?
2007-07-28T13:10:00.000Z	Jimdb		what should just pick up everything?
2007-07-28T13:10:00.000Z	Jimdb		will i need to reinstall or will the hardware detector upon boot recognize everything?
