2007-07-19T11:25:00.000Z	HEP85	sixfour	did you try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"? it configures xorg.conf automatically. there is also a page to select resolutions
2007-07-19T11:26:00.000Z	HEP85		*well, rather interactively than automatically
2007-07-19T11:27:00.000Z	sixfour	HEP85	the screen resolutions preferences page doesn't give me any other options that the ones i listed. I'll try the reconfigure util
