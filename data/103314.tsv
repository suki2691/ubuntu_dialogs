2008-02-05T05:54:00.000Z	dxdt	speedcore	both if I understand you properly.  Both have to do encryption using each other's keys
2008-02-05T05:54:00.000Z	speedcore	dxdt	but which one is making the least encryptions?  both equal?
2008-02-05T05:55:00.000Z	dxdt	speedcore	I'm no expert in it, but I would assume they are doing equal amounts on the average.
