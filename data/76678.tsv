2010-03-17T02:01:00.000Z	thevor		Hey. I have a quick question about dual booting, and partitioning.
2010-03-17T02:01:00.000Z	thevor		I am currently running ubuntu 9.10, and would like to set up a dual boot with vista. Is there an optimal way to do this? I was thinking of just partitioning my drive to make space for windows, and then to an install on the free space. Should that work alright? Also, is there a best way to partition my drive?
