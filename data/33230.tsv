2010-05-19T02:47:00.000Z	Loshki		There's no pulsaudio in Kubuntu? Those guys are smarter than I thought...
2010-05-19T02:48:00.000Z	Bizon	Loshki	Yes, it seems so... It would be better to use the same server in every fork not to get angry people like me, who hate using dumb apps like dragon, which can do nothing
2010-05-19T02:49:00.000Z	Loshki	Bizon	I guess. But pulseaudio is a nightmare and you're better off without it...
2010-05-19T02:50:00.000Z	Bizon	Loshki	Maybe, but I can't play any sound in my VLC, even if switching sound server from one to another...
