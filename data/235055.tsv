2007-09-08T11:27:00.000Z	Tiradin		I'm running Ubuntu's liveCD on a ThinkPad T23 beside me, and I'm trying to decide if it's running slow because it's off a CD or if it's because it only has 256MB of ram...
2007-09-08T11:27:00.000Z	Tiradin		Another issue I have is that I had to replace the original hard drive with a much smaller one (Around 500mb, i believe.) Will I still be able to install/run Ubuntu with such a small drive?
2007-09-08T11:28:00.000Z	dug	Tiradin	probably both I'm afraid :)
2007-09-08T11:29:00.000Z	dug	Tiradin	yeah DSL is good, see pendrivelinux.com
