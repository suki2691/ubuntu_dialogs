2009-02-16T22:39:00.000Z	jrib	refefer	ummmm, use ion or any other window manager in the repositories?
2009-02-16T22:40:00.000Z	refefer	jrib	yes, well, I would like the convenience of gnome or kde in terms of polish, but with that window tiling style option
2009-02-16T22:40:00.000Z	jrib	refefer	so use it as your window manager and use gnome and kde as you wish
