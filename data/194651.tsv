2006-05-01T08:38:00.000Z	DBO	hajuu	/etc/apt/sources.list -> pastebin
2006-05-01T08:41:00.000Z	DBO	hajuu	any way we can talk you into upgrading?
2006-05-01T08:42:00.000Z	DBO	hajuu	my guess is the problem isnt with your machine but that might just be me being stupid.  You COULD try using a different countries servers and see if that helps
