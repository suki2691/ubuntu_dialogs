2010-09-28T00:49:00.000Z	_RMoD	bobstro	 If you're referring to the Video Safe Mode in the F4 menu, then it doesn't exist for me.  My video isn't extremely unusual, it's a widescreen 1280x800 display on an Intel HD Graphics (which is supposedly supported).

2010-09-28T00:53:00.000Z	bobstro	_RMoD	 sorry, i can't think of anything to suggest. is there another video out it's grabbing perhaps?
