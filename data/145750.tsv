2007-02-15T11:34:00.000Z	MikesHardLinux	seb-_	I personally don't recommend doing version upgrades. they never work for me, I always end up with major problems
2007-02-15T11:35:00.000Z	seb-_	MikesHardLinux	shirish: so you guys do a new install?
2007-02-15T11:36:00.000Z	MikesHardLinux	seb-_	yes. every time. one thing i do is have a separate partition for /home. that way i can keep all my settings and stuff
