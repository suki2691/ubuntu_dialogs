2007-03-04T10:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	alecjw	 edit the sudoers file is one way,, but i think there may be a better way/group he needs to be in
2007-03-04T10:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis	alecjw	 you want him to have full 'sudo' access?
2007-03-04T10:31:00.000Z	alecjw	Dr_willis	i want hinm to be able to use sudo. do i jsut add his username to the end of /etc/sudoers?
