2005-12-03T10:22:00.000Z	osh		how can I get my [several nasty cursewords]  printer/cups, to stop printing my [the cursewords again]  job? The driver was wrong and now it's just printing gibberish. Resetting the printer doesn't work and stopping the job from cups doesn't either.
2005-12-03T10:23:00.000Z	osh		the printer sais it doesn't accept jobs and I can "Cancel job" until my face turns blue. Doesn't stop the fscking printer from wasting paper anyway. :-(
2005-12-03T10:24:00.000Z	frogzoo	osh	- the printer is printing from it's own memory
2005-12-03T10:25:00.000Z	osh	frogzoo	I was thinking that too, but resetting the printer should purge that, but still it just keeps on printing.
