2006-10-04T13:08:00.000Z	jeevesbond		Hello, am attempting to compile Wine from source (in Edgy), but it always segfaults due to this bug https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/wine/+bug/56965 (which neither party seem willing to fix). To workaround the bug I need to add '-fno-stack-protector' to my CFLAGS. Where are CFLAGS defined? In Gentoo they seem to be stored in /etc/make.conf, but in the Ubuntu Edgy environment that file does not exist?!

2006-10-04T13:09:00.000Z	oskude	jeevesbond	see "./configure --help"
2006-10-04T13:10:00.000Z	oskude	jeevesbond	or you can manually add them to the "Makefile"
