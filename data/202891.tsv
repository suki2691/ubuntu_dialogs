2010-12-19T23:27:00.000Z	keito	Abhish	you compile everything from source, beginning with the kernel, and build your system from there
2010-12-19T23:28:00.000Z	keito	Abhish	LFS is where you basically create a distro by putting the kernel and packages together.  gentoo is a distro where you build everything from scratch
