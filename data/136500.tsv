2008-08-14T09:39:00.000Z	osxdude	XiXaQ	Yes, and it comes with Ubuntu. System Monitor. lol
2008-08-14T09:39:00.000Z	osxdude	XiXaQ	You have to configure it, though, to show network usage
2008-08-14T09:44:00.000Z	XiXaQ	osxdude	no, that doesn't display the transferred data on the panels. It displays a diagram, but I'd like to have digits.
