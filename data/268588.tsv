2005-01-20T06:40:00.000Z	brian__		can anyone tell me how to get 32 bit color with my nvidia card? I only have 24-bit
2005-01-20T06:40:00.000Z	mjg59	brian__	Most cards only provide 24 bit colour in 32 bit mode
2005-01-20T06:41:00.000Z	mjg59	brian__	When X says "24 bit colour", it's probably using the card in 32 bit mode
2005-01-20T06:44:00.000Z	mjg59	brian__	It's likely to be some other problem
