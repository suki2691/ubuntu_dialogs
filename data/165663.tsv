2006-10-01T08:41:00.000Z	michael		Hello all, I'm having a problem activating my on-board ethernet card, a Via Rhine II.
2006-10-01T08:41:00.000Z	odyssevs	michael	a guy was in here earlier reporting that to be a problem.
2006-10-01T08:42:00.000Z	odyssevs	michael	the bloke in question used a separate NIC to solve it.
2006-10-01T08:48:00.000Z	odyssevs	michael	the bloke in question has arrived - blenderx, you can consult with him over the VIA_Rhine.
