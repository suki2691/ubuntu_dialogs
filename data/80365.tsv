2009-03-12T19:02:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong		can anyone tell me what this pts/0 mean
2009-03-12T19:02:00.000Z	storbeck	PerryArmstrong	It's the 1st psuedo-terminal
2009-03-12T19:04:00.000Z	storbeck	PerryArmstrong	man tty and man pts
2009-03-12T19:06:00.000Z	storbeck	PerryArmstrong	essentially, tty is a controlling terminal, and pts is a pseudo-terminal
