2008-02-20T14:00:00.000Z	seraph		anyone done a fresh install lately? I want to know how many megs of updates a fresh install needs...
2008-02-20T14:01:00.000Z	dgjones	seraph	I did one on sunday, the updates were a couple of hundred mb, can't remember exactly though
2008-02-20T14:01:00.000Z	seraph	dgjones	but around that amount?
2008-02-20T14:03:00.000Z	dgjones	seraph	yes, I'd sat 2-300mb, but I wouldn't like to gurantee it - This install was from an original alternate install cd when it was released, I don't know if the cd iso's are updated when updates are added, if they are it could be less
