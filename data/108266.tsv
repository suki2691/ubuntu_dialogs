2007-12-30T11:38:00.000Z	zcat[1]	uzerzero	I've had terrible experiences with trying to use ndiswrapper (never got it to work) and great experiences with the open source drivers .. I guess it depends on the card.
2007-12-30T11:39:00.000Z	uzerzero	zcat[1]	my only complaint with ndiswrapper is that whenever i am doing large data transfers, it will sometimes cause my entire computer to lock up. i am experimenting with gutsy to see if i can get the native drivers working, but still no luck.

2007-12-30T11:42:00.000Z	uzerzero	zcat[1]	thanks, i will try those out when i'm done copying these discs
