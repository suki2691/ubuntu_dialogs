2012-05-19T01:31:00.000Z	xangua	bluesnow	if by upgrading 11.04 to 12.04 you mean editing the sources and changing the release codename in those to precice, yes it will break soon or later and it's also not supported here
2012-05-19T01:32:00.000Z	bluesnow	xangua	is that the same as using the update manager to upgrade to 12.04? I'm not sure what you mean
