2011-04-08T02:31:00.000Z	acicula	Galvatron	if you must use the drivers from nvidia directly at least use the provided --deb flags to properly install packages without hosing someones system permanetly
2011-04-08T02:32:00.000Z	Galvatron	acicula	I'm personally installing them as I mentioned and observed no problem
2011-04-08T02:33:00.000Z	acicula	Galvatron	the problem is not with the installing of the drivers, but with the fact that they ignore the ubuntu package manager and break subsequent upgrades or removal attempts
