2010-05-06T14:03:00.000Z	llutz	wulfy	 no security-benefits at all, so why care?
2010-05-06T14:04:00.000Z	wulfy	llutz	i can think of several high profile sites that disallow pining to there servers... im sure theres a reason behind it
2010-05-06T14:05:00.000Z	llutz	wulfy	that they do doesn't mean it makes sense ;)
