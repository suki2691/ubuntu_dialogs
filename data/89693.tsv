2008-06-04T01:39:00.000Z	eight_		Hey... I installed Hardy on a school computer, but it has a crappy connection and I can't apt-get update and install stuff..
2008-06-04T01:39:00.000Z	eight_		I need to get the things I need install from a livecd at home..

2008-06-04T01:44:00.000Z	DaveKong	eight_	 I am not sure how to help you with that, try the forums
