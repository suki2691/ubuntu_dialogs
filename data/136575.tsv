Everytime I update my linux-headers from update-manager my video goes into safe mode, last time I had to purge all nvidia and install the drivers from nvidia website after killing gdm, I did this time but still goes to safe mode, what is really going on? I never had this problem before
2008-02-14T02:09:00.000Z	generalj_		I cant even get the nvidia-glx package to work either,
2008-02-14T02:09:00.000Z	generalj_		is it some kind of symlink broken?
2008-02-14T02:09:00.000Z	neverblue	generalj_	there is an #nvidia channel on the network...
