2007-04-01T15:23:00.000Z	craigbass1976		what's up with /etc/fstab?  I'm coming from RH type linuxes and am not used to seeing lines like UUID=xxxxxxxxx.
2007-04-01T15:23:00.000Z	shatrat	craigbass1976	you can still use /dev/hdb2 type entries if you want, the UUIDs confuse me too.
2007-04-01T15:24:00.000Z	craigbass1976	shatrat	ok.  I'll looking into UUID but for now I just want an nfs share to mount at boot.
2007-04-01T15:25:00.000Z	shatrat	craigbass1976	you should be able to do it the same way you would in any linux or unix distro
