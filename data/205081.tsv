2008-11-18T05:48:00.000Z	yoyo	Falstius	theres nothing i can set in the fstab to give root privledges?  Also how do i use chmod?
2008-11-18T05:50:00.000Z	Falstius	yoyo	in fstab you can set who can mount and umount a partition, but to actually allow writing and reading you generally need to change the permissions (unless this is a NTFS drive).
