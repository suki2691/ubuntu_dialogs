2011-09-07T23:48:00.000Z	mmyers		Good afternoon, everyone.  I'm having a problem with the Ubuntu Installer on a Mac Mini.  I see the purple boot screen, and I can select "Try Ubuntu before Installing" or "Install Ubuntu", but either way, when I do, I lose signal to my monitor, and my disk drive just clicks around for a while.  I've tried waiting 20 minutes, but nothing ever happens.  Is there any troubleshooting or anything I can do here?
