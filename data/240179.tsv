2009-01-27T23:50:00.000Z	Magnusmagnus		(Wubi ubuntu installation) while in ubuntu, I accidentally deleted the windows' boot manager, and had to pop in the vista CD to repair it.. When it was done fixing, ubuntu was removed from the list, or was never put in it. Does anyone know how to recover ubuntu to the Windows' boot manager list? I installed ubuntu via the Wubi
