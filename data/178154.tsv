2009-01-22T23:49:00.000Z	mustard		hi folks. i'm trying to resize my linux partition to give my vista partition some extra space, but gparted won't let me do it. any suggestions?

2009-01-22T23:55:00.000Z	mustard	Jack_Sparrow	what might some other reasons be that i can't resize it?
2009-01-22T23:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	mustard	errors on the drive,  not enough free space after the proposed resize, locked down from unclean removal etc
