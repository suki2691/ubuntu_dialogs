2012-10-22T01:28:00.000Z	XliamX		Hello all. I'm just looking for a little advice. One question really.
2012-10-22T01:28:00.000Z	XliamX		Is it possible to boot a Ubuntu live iso from a grub bootloader?
2012-10-22T01:29:00.000Z	XliamX		What kind of coding would I have to put in the menu.lst to boot the iso properly?
2012-10-22T01:30:00.000Z	escott	XliamX	a lot of bioses won't like that
