2005-07-04T05:30:00.000Z	stazz	TheKarn	gentoo kinda has a way around it :)
2005-07-04T05:30:00.000Z	TheKarn	bulletbrain	ok ... well i'm on a livecd so i dont want to waste time downloading and installing. i just wanted to see how easy apt-get was to use and what was available
2005-07-04T05:30:00.000Z	stazz	TheKarn	the gentoo policy is a much looser policy
