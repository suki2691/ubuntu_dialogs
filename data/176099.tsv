2008-01-15T04:42:00.000Z	Gumby		hi all.  Is there anything that can be done about this? I am at a command line prompt only and I am getting this when trying to use sudo  "sudo: timestamp too far in the future"

2008-01-15T04:43:00.000Z	Gumby	LiraNuna	without being able to use sudo how would I do that?
