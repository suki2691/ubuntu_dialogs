2008-02-27T22:29:00.000Z	Squawk	anthony_	what do you want to do with linux/ubuntu. Your reading will be dictated by what you want to achieve
2008-02-27T22:32:00.000Z	Squawk	anthony_	i presume you dont want to be limited to jsut ubuntu in that case. I would suggest looking at kernel compilation. learn how to compile a kernel, first under ubuntu, but also under other distros
