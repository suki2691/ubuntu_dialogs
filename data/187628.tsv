2008-01-19T01:07:00.000Z	gmoore		i currently have my ubuntu system plugged into my Dell lcd (1680x1050). i'm going to shut it down and connect it to my projector (1280x720). will Ubuntu read the device EDID info and set the resolution appropriately, or is it going to keep trying to use the initial res of 1680?

2008-01-19T01:08:00.000Z	gmoore	ikonia	my windows pc gets the EDID info ok, so i know it does. good then; if i was going to have to mess with the resolutions i'd want to know in advance before i unplug stuff. thanks.
