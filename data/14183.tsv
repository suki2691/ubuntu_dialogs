2011-05-18T18:07:00.000Z	Kateon	martinrame	is that a local port forward, or remote? to my knowledge, if you forward a local port to the remote host's port, you can initiate as many connections as you'd like

The first test I did was connect to a database using Flamerobin, then connect to the same database using a sample program made by me, and I couldn't connect. But, if I connect with flamerobin to a different database, both programs can coexist.
