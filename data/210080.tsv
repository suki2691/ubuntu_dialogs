2006-05-16T13:42:00.000Z	osotogari		Trying to set up a file server here at home so I was wondering should i just install "server" or just do a "normal" install, the machine is an old 800Mhz AMD with 256 MB RAM
2006-05-16T13:44:00.000Z	osotogari		would the machine be able to handle Gnome desktop though with only 800 MHz processor and 256 RAM?
2006-05-16T13:44:00.000Z	Samuli^	osotogari	I think so.
2006-05-16T13:44:00.000Z	Samuli^	osotogari	and if it's slow try some other window manager.
