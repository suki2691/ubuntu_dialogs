2009-08-15T18:58:00.000Z	_mnemonic76		I am trying to understand the details of what happens when I plug a usb drive in in Ubuntu... the details of what makes it appear automatically for me to mount.
2009-08-15T18:59:00.000Z	_mnemonic76		I have a minimal ubuntu install on an old laptop using fluxbox instead of gnome... and I don't know what I need to add to make it function MORE like the gnome (basically the automounting)
