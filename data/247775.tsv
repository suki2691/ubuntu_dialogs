2006-05-26T06:41:00.000Z	TempicoMB		Can I get any help here concerning installation of Ubuntu on my Mac?
2006-05-26T06:43:00.000Z	ompaul	TempicoMB	try ##apple it might have one or two ubuntu people in it
2006-05-26T06:44:00.000Z	ompaul	TempicoMB	or waith 4 hours when one of the mac users should be here, however I understood it was rather trivial to install it on a Mac, but I am not inthat camp
