2011-02-15T21:14:00.000Z	ajf		I stupidly installed ubuntu-desktop on my Ubuntu Server install. How can I remove all of it?
2011-02-15T21:16:00.000Z	ajf		As it's a meta package
2011-02-15T21:16:00.000Z	ajf		it isn't actually installed
2011-02-15T21:17:00.000Z	Pici	ajf	sure it is. It just doesn't have any files that it installs with it.
