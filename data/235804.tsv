2011-01-31T10:53:00.000Z	bucky	Madpilot	what's the default passwd for ubuntu if you make one during install?
2011-01-31T10:54:00.000Z	bucky	Madpilot	*dont' make one
2011-01-31T10:54:00.000Z	Madpilot	bucky	there is no default PW. The liveCD/desktop is passwordless, the install will not continue AFAIK if you don't give it a pw
