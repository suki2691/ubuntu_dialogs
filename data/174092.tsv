2007-10-18T10:27:00.000Z	towlieba		who here has been using 7.10
2007-10-18T10:29:00.000Z	towlieba		i read that you can upgrade to the final version of 7.10 by doing update-manager -d if i run that command, do i get the final version ?
2007-10-18T10:30:00.000Z	varun0	towlieba	I always thought -d wasn't for "final versions", just for development versions, but I could be wrong
