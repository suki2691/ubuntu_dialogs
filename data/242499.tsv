2012-10-16T17:05:00.000Z	Redoovius		Quick question (hopefully) ... I have a ASUS 1000HA... and it seems to have deleted the wireless card from itself after using it for literally two years. Any ideas on how to get it back?
2012-10-16T17:05:00.000Z	Redoovius		For Ubuntu? Really? I never even looked there... that's interesting
2012-10-16T17:06:00.000Z	Redoovius		Well... we are in an Ubuntu channel, sir. ;P
2012-10-16T17:07:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Redoovius	do you know what kind of wireless card it is?
