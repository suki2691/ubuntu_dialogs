2008-05-10T17:33:00.000Z	compengi		i had a problem with hardy detecting my fx5500 nvidia vga card. after installing the restricted driver, resolution went down to 640x480. so i loaded gutsy live cd and copied xorg.conf file to hardy, restarted x server and it worked. but the problem is that everytime i reboot my pc, the resolution goes down back to low and i need to restart the x server before logging in

2008-05-10T17:40:00.000Z	compengi	wirechief-intel	i tried that before an idea of using the gutsy xorg.conf configuration. i tried several things and made over 3 hardy installs. one of my tries was using the guide you suggested. but it didn't help. i reinstalled hardy and tried to compile nvidia drivers, it worked but i didn't like the kernel recompile thing. so i also reinstalled hardy to try using gutsy's xorg file and it worked but with the problem that i stated
2008-05-10T17:45:00.000Z	wirechief-intel	compengi	well i dunno, i have a ati 1300, the proprietary drivers used fail miserably too, i use my kanotix xorg.conf and then the install-fglrx-debian.sh script and it works, there is similar scripts for nvidia but you would need a xorg.conf from kanotix ;)
