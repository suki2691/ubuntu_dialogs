2011-02-07T01:44:00.000Z	Anon7-2521		Hello all. I'm getting an error when I try to play any kind of media both with rhythmbox or MPlayer
2011-02-07T01:45:00.000Z	Anon7-2521		It says: "Error Failed to connect stream: Too large"
2011-02-07T01:45:00.000Z	Anon7-2521		I should. This is a brand new problem and I've been running Ubuntu for months
2011-02-07T01:46:00.000Z	Diamondcite	Anon7-2521	Is that a file or streaming?
