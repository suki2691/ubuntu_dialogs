2006-05-05T09:46:00.000Z	simplydazed	Steff_breezy	stuff, just remove it from the panel and use ALT + arrow key to change workspaces
2006-05-05T09:49:00.000Z	Steff_breezy	simplydazed	hmm, this idea is also worth thinking about, I could use the shortcuts ALT x, ALT y, ALT c to switch. Are these shortcuts maybe occupied by another function?
2006-05-05T09:50:00.000Z	simplydazed	Steff_breezy	no idea, check the Keyboard shortcuts
