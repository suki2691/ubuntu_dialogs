2008-06-22T00:04:00.000Z	sstchur		Basic question (I think) for someone who knows what he/she is doing:  I can connect to my ubuntu printer by specifying http://my.ip.address:631/printers/printerName, but I'd like to be able to specify http://ubuntuComputerName:631/...  This isn't working though; any ideas why?
2008-06-22T00:05:00.000Z	FAJALOU	sstchur	i have to do the same thing to get my printer to work...
2008-06-22T00:05:00.000Z	sstchur	FAJALOU	no way to specify the computer name instead of IP?
2008-06-22T00:06:00.000Z	FAJALOU	sstchur	i am not sure, but i know that that is how I do it, and it works.  there may be a way around it,,,
