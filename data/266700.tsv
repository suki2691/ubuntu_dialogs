2011-02-11T23:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	virious	 ask the question - see who can help
2011-02-11T23:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	virious	 i always use a command similer to --->  sudo grub-install --root-directory=/media/InstalledSystemMointPoint  /dev/sda --recheck
2011-02-11T23:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	virious	 so i think you got it backwards
