2007-11-07T22:38:00.000Z	selector_waxx		does other ppl have problems with open arena and ubuntu 7.10
2007-11-07T22:39:00.000Z	kst-	selector_waxx	I'm running not openarena but challengeq3 (icculus q3) and it works fine
2007-11-07T22:40:00.000Z	kst-	selector_waxx	it's only a binary tho, not a full game... you still need the original q3 content
