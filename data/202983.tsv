2006-03-02T14:51:00.000Z	northie		How do I change my keyboard layout?
2006-03-02T14:51:00.000Z	vivid	northie	from the System -> Preferences -> Keyboard app
2006-03-02T14:52:00.000Z	northie	vivid	that doesn't work either. I add a keyboard, move it to the top, and gnome changes through all my desktop themes, gives me an error message on some missing icon in one of them, and I'm back at square one.
