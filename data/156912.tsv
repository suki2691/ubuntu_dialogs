2009-12-13T07:25:00.000Z	wilberfan		I just installed 9.10 onto a system with Debian Sid (sidux) and Windows 7.   When I boot, the Sidux grub menu still displays.  I'm pretty sure Ubuntu recognized the other two installs...but no 'buntu grub menu...

2009-12-13T07:26:00.000Z	wilberfan	thiebaude	i WANTED to overwrite the grub...but I don't think it overwrote properly?
2009-12-13T07:26:00.000Z	thiebaude	wilberfan	ok
