2006-05-02T10:46:00.000Z	Mon	ketsugi	i think that means giving totem support for it since totem-video-thumbnailer (or something) is being used for that
2006-05-02T10:47:00.000Z	Mon	ketsugi	those should work
2006-05-02T10:48:00.000Z	Mon	ketsugi	hmm ico == bmp afaik. but i don't know how to add the filetype. maybe you could check gconf-editor?
