2008-09-12T01:40:00.000Z	unfo	Saulin	try this: ask the whole channel the following :) "Did my question make sense?"
2008-09-12T01:43:00.000Z	Saulin	unfo	I guess not. I changed my session options by mistake and cannot get is back to the regular sign on instead of the remote host sign on.
2008-09-12T01:49:00.000Z	unfo	Saulin	try asking your latest revision of the question to the channel.  See if anyone replies.  If not, before you try repeating, ask the channel: "Did my question make sense?"  :)
