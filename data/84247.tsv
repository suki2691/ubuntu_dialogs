2008-07-28T22:10:00.000Z	Zillios		I'm new to ubuntu and was hoping someone could answer me a question about wine?
2008-07-28T22:12:00.000Z	Zillios		I installed a simple mud client using wine and i've noticed a significant difference that how it is with my xp box. I was wondering wine worked well with heavy games like WoW, or Warcraft3:FT
2008-07-28T22:13:00.000Z	DRebellion	Zillios	apparently, wine runs wow very well.
2008-07-28T22:16:00.000Z	Zillios	DRebellion	its probably the only reason why I haven't changed my main OS to ubuntu, fear of having problems with it. Is there anything I should be aware between WoW and wine? How about ventrilo?
