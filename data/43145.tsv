2010-08-13T01:01:00.000Z	husimon	thune3	so it looks like somehow i've deleted part of the file but the space hasn't been freed up yet.  So I need to figure out how to get linux to release that inode.
2010-08-13T01:06:00.000Z	thune3	husimon	you could also try "lsof | grep somefilenamepattern"
2010-08-13T01:06:00.000Z	husimon	thune3	tried that first, didn't show up
