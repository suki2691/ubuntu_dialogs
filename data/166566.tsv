2011-08-08T08:04:00.000Z	exodus_ms		bullgard4, "E: Couldn't find package libreoffice"
2011-08-08T08:06:00.000Z	exodus_ms		lame... searching "libreoffice" in synaptic package manager brings up everything installed, but using the terminal I get "E: Couldn't find package libreoffice"
2011-08-08T08:08:00.000Z	wols_	exodus_ms	synaptic won't give you "Libreoffce" but things like "Libreoffice-common". there is a difference there
