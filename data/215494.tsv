2008-05-16T01:26:00.000Z	david___		Anyone know a good place to start, when i am trying to get my ATI 9600 drivers up and running for Hardy Heron?
2008-05-16T01:27:00.000Z	david___		yes i downloaded and installed but fglrxinfo still shows Mesa something or another
2008-05-16T01:28:00.000Z	david___		OpenGL renderer string: Mesa GLX Indirect
