2006-09-05T08:24:00.000Z	wweasel	fishy	Not comfortable compiling stuff yourself? I wasn't a couple weeks ago, but I found out it wasn't as hard as it sounds
2006-09-05T08:25:00.000Z	fishy	wweasel	No, I can compile most things. I made something in Glade and it won't compile. I've spent three hours in this channel and on the Ubuntu Forums trying to figure it out.
2006-09-05T08:25:00.000Z	wweasel	fishy	Ah. Sorry I can't help, I'm about to head off to bed.
