2005-03-12T09:13:00.000Z	steintr	andrewski	Don't know.  It just looks different (perhaps a different default theme than on my old install)
2005-03-12T09:13:00.000Z	steintr	andrewski	Personal taste :)
2005-03-12T09:13:00.000Z	andrewski	steintr	yeah, i was gonna say it's probably your theme, because i don't know how the program itself could be uglier... ;)
