2009-02-21T15:49:00.000Z	jonson		Hey, I'm accessing a remote machine via gnome and ssh://ip ... however, I cannot make any changes to files owned by root... is there a way to raise my privileges? or do I have to log in via a terminal to do that?
2009-02-21T15:51:00.000Z	jonson		and I only have one user and no root user activated.
2009-02-21T15:51:00.000Z	jonson		well, I guess, I have to use the terminal then
2009-02-21T15:51:00.000Z	crdlb	jonson	well, why do you want to make changes that require root in the first place?
