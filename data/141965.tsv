2007-07-24T11:35:00.000Z	b4l74z4r		i've got 2gb of ram and was wondering how large i should make my swap partition and wether it matters if it's a primary or extended partition

2007-07-24T11:36:00.000Z	Maximander	b4l74z4r	or as least almost, i don't think it compresses much
2007-07-24T11:37:00.000Z	Maximander	b4l74z4r	as far as primary/logical, well... if you're ever going to want more than 4 partitions, start making logicals
