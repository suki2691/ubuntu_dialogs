2008-12-17T19:30:00.000Z	freeqstyler	gansc	I have a problem with booting. I have two disk - first 320GB with Ubuntu 8.10 installed (SATA converted to IDE- Primary) and second 40GB with WinXP (Secondary IDE). When i try to boot from first drive I see "GRUB loading stage 1.5 error 25" instead od GRUB menu. I tried to boot from Super Grub Disk, but then I saw "Grub loading stage2 read error" after choosing Ubuntu partition. Sorry for my english :P
