2010-11-19T02:52:00.000Z	gustavo-ferreira		Hi all, i was wondering if someone in here could help me on get a title for a really good book on programmin in C on Linux? Although i use linux for about an year and half, i consider myself a newbie on this matter. I know how to program in C, but just the ANSI C. I'm right now with my eyes on this book: http://www.amazon.com/Linux-Programming-Unleashed-Kurt-Wall/dp/0672316072. Could someone suggest if this book is good enough or i
