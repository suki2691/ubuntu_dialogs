2011-11-01T17:48:00.000Z	lapion		In a virtualbox, I just tried to convert my home fs to btrfs, only to find out there is no tool to change the uuid of btrfs-fses
2011-11-01T17:50:00.000Z	_r00t_	lapion	why do yo need btrfs ?
2011-11-01T17:51:00.000Z	lapion		does anyone know which tool can be used to change uuid of btrfs
2011-11-01T17:51:00.000Z	lapion	_r00t_	it's for experimenting..
