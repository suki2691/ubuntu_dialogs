2010-06-03T01:51:00.000Z	Nic		I have just downloaded/installed a PPA to upgrade pidgin messenger and now when booting my ubuntu 10.04 will not load any further than the purple booting screen just before the login window... does anyone know how I could correct this?
2010-06-03T01:53:00.000Z	guntbert	Nic	I cannot imagine how those two things are related ...
2010-06-03T01:54:00.000Z	Nic	guntbert	apart from anything else that was in the Upgrade Manager after I downloaded the PPA pidgin had emailed me the link to get for a ubuntu upgrade I have no made any changes that I could think would cause this... and its sorta suck when you can turn ur comp on but not load the os :(
2010-06-03T01:58:00.000Z	guntbert	Nic	so it was some upgrade -- try to boot with an older kernel
