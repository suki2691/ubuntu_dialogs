2010-07-15T20:25:00.000Z	Danny2010		Hello, I'm looking for a distro that has all the security of Linux, which has no hardware problems and if possible, to disable 'gnome' and start the programs with the console, which is light is really what I seek
2010-07-15T20:25:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	Danny2010	sounds like RHEL
2010-07-15T20:26:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	Danny2010	CentOS in the free (no money) version
2010-07-15T20:26:00.000Z	Beyecixramd	Danny2010	or Debian
