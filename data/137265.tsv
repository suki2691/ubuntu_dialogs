2008-05-10T17:09:00.000Z	Beastage	Mickinator	 appears it is a proper install , with supposedly inferior HDD performance but so far the hdd performance are very fast
2008-05-10T17:11:00.000Z	Beastage	Mickinator	 yes , wubi creates a virtual partition in a big file , its like vmware but much better performance
2008-05-10T17:11:00.000Z	Beastage	Mickinator	 it works just like a proper one
