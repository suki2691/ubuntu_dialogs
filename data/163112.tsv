2007-01-18T07:35:00.000Z	AlexFicelle		Hi everyone! Does anybody know what packages I need to install to get full support for an additional language? I am using Ubuntu 6.10 and would like to install Spanish.

2007-01-18T07:44:00.000Z	AlexFicelle	finalbeta	Thank you, thank you! I had actually installed several packages by hand, but missed a few. The language support applet proposed to install what was missing from the start. It's grand! Thank you very much...
