2008-06-07T20:01:00.000Z	mthe		does anyone know how to remove panda desktop secure for linux from ubuntu 8.04? It opens the panel to let you register it, only to close it a second later - even if you manage to click through. Horrible bug!
2008-06-07T20:02:00.000Z	smallfoot-	mthe	did you install proprietary software?
2008-06-07T20:03:00.000Z	smallfoot-	mthe	proprietary software no good, better donate money of 3 licenses to clamav and use that
2008-06-07T20:04:00.000Z	smallfoot-	mthe	but there is no spyware + malware for ubuntu
