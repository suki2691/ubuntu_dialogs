2010-03-25T18:01:00.000Z	tomiondrums	recon69_lap	oh, i guess i have to mention i'm using Kubuntu
2010-03-25T18:02:00.000Z	tomiondrums	recon69_lap	i'm pretty sure i have the original nvidia one
2010-03-25T18:03:00.000Z	recon69_lap	tomiondrums	well, I'm not going to be much help anyway, luckly my HDTV is detected fine, I just need to get the display app to run in sudo mode so i can get it to update x-conf
