2012-03-11T17:22:00.000Z	Mikero		Hi. Is there a general conventions or rule on where to install applications (like Program Files on Windows)?
2012-03-11T17:23:00.000Z	theTroy	Mikero	normally you tend to install applications with software centre, or apt-get, they install automatically and do not provide you with choice of location
2012-03-11T17:25:00.000Z	theTroy	Mikero	do you want to install it for all users, and have it accessible via terminal? or just run it locally from one user?
2012-03-11T17:28:00.000Z	theTroy	Mikero	that will depend on what the file does, does it run the phpstorm, or does it compile it and install it on the system?
