2007-08-04T14:32:00.000Z	Senesence		Anyone? Dhcp lease dates - how can I see what they are?
2007-08-04T14:33:00.000Z	serenityUK2	Senesence	cat /var/lib/dhcp3/dhclient.leases
2007-08-04T14:34:00.000Z	serenityUK2	Senesence	try cat /var/lib/dhcp3/dhclient.leases
2007-08-04T14:34:00.000Z	Senesence	serenityUK2	That file is empty - and that's weird, because how can I be online without a lease.
