2007-08-05T15:54:00.000Z	Gimm1eDat		Im havin a helluva time gettin ubuntu to install.. im using the "alternate cd".. i get through everything fine.. the installer starts, gets to the "select and install software" stage.. you know, like the most important stage... starts, goes to 2%.. skips to 6%.. says please wait.. skips to 85% and then fails out..
2007-08-05T15:54:00.000Z	Gimm1eDat		first time I couldnt even get that far cause the CD was apparently bad.. could that be the case this time as well?
2007-08-05T15:54:00.000Z	Gimm1eDat		since I got this far you'd think the CD is good
