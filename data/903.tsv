2012-10-03T01:24:00.000Z	crimsonhat		Hello. I have a server connected to a switch and I was wondering how I can get a client that is also connected to the switch to talk to the server?
2012-10-03T01:25:00.000Z	zykotick9	crimsonhat	assuming you don't have a DHCP server.  set static IPs on both machines...
2012-10-03T01:26:00.000Z	crimsonhat	zykotick9	The server is connected to a modem. Should I just set the server as a dhcp server?
2012-10-03T01:27:00.000Z	zykotick9	crimsonhat	maybe.  that's really up to you.  best of luck, i have no experience using a computer as a router, so can't help ya.
