2005-03-30T09:35:00.000Z	imnes		I'm going through a fresh install right now of Warty, if I'm going to immediately upgrade to Hoary do I need to let the installer of Warty go online and download additional packages at the end of the installation or can I skip that?
2005-03-30T09:35:00.000Z	imnes		If I skip that, once I change my repos and issue a dist-upgrade will it still grab all those packages that I skipped in the installer?
