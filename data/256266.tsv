2011-08-03T15:36:00.000Z	Har1equin		I have a non Ubuntu related question that I need help on, it's relating to blocking IP networks based on the IP address...
2011-08-03T15:36:00.000Z	Har1equin		I am designing a website and would like to redirect anyone visiting from outside the UK, i.e. not connecting on a UK based IP to another page. Is this possible...?
