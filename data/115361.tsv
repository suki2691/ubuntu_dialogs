2011-09-16T05:33:00.000Z	mgparisi		Im running a VERY old EVGA card, that can get an AMAZING 800x600... is there a Remote Desktop software that will allow me to go bigger then that?
2011-09-16T05:33:00.000Z	c4pt	mgparisi	probably not
2011-09-16T05:34:00.000Z	c4pt	mgparisi	even if you use RDP or VNC with 1280x1024 and the physical card is 800x600 at max the screen will be downsized in a 1280x1024 (as an example)
2011-09-16T05:34:00.000Z	c4pt	mgparisi	you will have 800x600 of viewable area and another area of just blank/black space
