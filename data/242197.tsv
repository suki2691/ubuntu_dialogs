2005-04-15T11:40:00.000Z	JonnySlack		I just have a few questions... in general.
2005-04-15T11:41:00.000Z	JonnySlack		and aside from that... how would one turn on spell checking in xchat?
2005-04-15T11:41:00.000Z	Jlow	JonnySlack	i dont use own email server because many many email providers like aol, gmx etc, block those private senders
