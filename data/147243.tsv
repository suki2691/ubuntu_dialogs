2007-02-01T12:01:00.000Z	falfool		Anyone free to help me with a video issue please? I've been trying to fix it for over 8 hours, it's really getting to me!
2007-02-01T12:03:00.000Z	falfool		I've apparently messed up my nVidia drivers trying to update for the latest version, I can't get anything to work now. The system says there's an API mismatch between the kernel module and the one I'm trying to install, I tried removing linux-headers, linux-restricted-modules, linux-386, nvidia-glx, nothing seems to work!
2007-02-01T12:04:00.000Z	falfool		I reinstalled, removed, reinstalled, all in vain!
2007-02-01T12:05:00.000Z	yomm	falfool	you need to build the lasest nvid driver with the linux-headers_your_kernel
