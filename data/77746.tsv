2008-11-02T13:59:00.000Z	alanbshepard77		I need help getting php5 to work with apache. I've installed everything but when I load a php script in my browser it either asks where to save the file or prints the code on screen. PHP isn't doing its job.
2008-11-02T14:00:00.000Z	djhash	alanbshepard77	sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
2008-11-02T14:00:00.000Z	alanbshepard77	djhash	I've done that :(
2008-11-02T14:01:00.000Z	djhash	alanbshepard77	check with #apache you might have a problem with httpd.conf or something like that
