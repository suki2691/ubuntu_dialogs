I've tried both install via a dvd and using wubi and neither works correctly. Everything works fine but the screen refuses to turn on while ubuntu is booted. I manage to get it to output to my monitor by a vga cable though so I'm sure the os itself is working. Would anyone know how to

2012-01-09T05:02:00.000Z	Teratogen	D4nt3	does the screen turn on at all?
2012-01-09T05:02:00.000Z	Teratogen	D4nt3	you don't even see the BIOS splash?
