2007-10-11T05:56:00.000Z	ARAJABAT		hello, I installed ubuntu in my laptop and then I installed windows. Now I've no acess to my linux. How can I install the grub again? I don't have the Ubuntu CD, I only have a slack cd
2007-10-11T05:57:00.000Z	Pelo	ARAJABAT	 the easiest way is to get the  super grub cd to fix it,   and then add windows to the grub boot menu ,   check the last link on the bunch ubotu gave you toward the end of the page
