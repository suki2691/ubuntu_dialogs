2010-04-08T09:34:00.000Z	gerzel		Does this matter?  I have a 64 bit machine but want to re-install grub using a 9.04 server dvd.  specifically from the Ubuntu Server book
2010-04-08T09:35:00.000Z	gerzel		I don't want to download a whole nother iso, I have 9.10 versions of Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Xubuntu dled and burned.
