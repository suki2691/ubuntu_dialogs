2011-12-30T16:49:00.000Z	MK--		i'm having a nightmare trying to install ubuntu on my new Dell i7 pc. I have tried installing from usb, from cd; 32 bit version and 64 bit version; 11.10 and 11.04; i have checked the iso mdsums and everything! It just won't install. I keep getting this message and then it hangs!
