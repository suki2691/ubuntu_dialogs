2005-06-26T11:30:00.000Z	DanielC		Help. None of my Firefox dialogs work. They all give an error of the form "XML Parsing error ... chrome://browser/content/pref/pref.xul ... root.localname = prefElements[i] .localName;"
2005-06-26T11:30:00.000Z	DanielC		I triend uninstalling firefox, and re-installing, but it didn't help. A locate on pref.xul turns up nothing. :(
2005-06-26T11:30:00.000Z	DanielC		Dang, my internet connection just had a hiccup. I hope I didn't miss any responses.
