2007-05-26T11:39:00.000Z	illriginal		Hey guys?... How would I be able to back up my bookmarks? I want to install Ubuntu Feisty but I don't want to lose my bookmarks. I'm currently on Ubuntu Edgy
2007-05-26T11:39:00.000Z	magnetron	illriginal	firefox has the options to export the bookmarks as a single file
2007-05-26T15:16:00.000Z	magnetron	illriginal	just type "sudo chown filename"
