2009-07-25T11:48:00.000Z	JPeterson		I installed the latest Ubuntu in VMWare 6.0.4 and ethernet doesn't work, VMWare tools mounting doesn't work so sharing doesn't work or drag and drop
2009-07-25T11:48:00.000Z	JPeterson		So how am I supposed to get it working?
2009-07-25T11:48:00.000Z	Jeruvy	JPeterson	you may wish to ask in #vmware
2009-07-25T12:05:00.000Z	Jeruvy	JPeterson	no, you simply mount it then install it.  IF you have a current set of lib's it should work fine, if not, then it's hell.
