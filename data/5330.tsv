2012-07-21T05:34:00.000Z	Andril		i need help with this "W: Duplicate sources.list entry http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates/main i386 Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/us.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_precise-updates_main_binary-i386_Packages)"
2012-07-21T05:35:00.000Z	L3top	Andril	typically running sudo apt-get update twice typically fixes that... but you can look at your /etc/apt/sources.list and delete any duplicates.
