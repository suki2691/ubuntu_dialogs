2006-03-08T10:53:00.000Z	knite		i.e.  can someone resize an NTFS partition?
2006-03-08T10:54:00.000Z	intelikey	knite	 yes   but i sujest you shrink your partition with winxp's tool  and just leave unallocated space for your ub install.
2006-03-08T10:54:00.000Z	knite	intelikey	oh, i didn't know you can shrink partition in winxp itself
