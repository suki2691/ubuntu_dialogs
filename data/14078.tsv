2011-07-01T21:37:00.000Z	j^2		is the only way to configure transmisison through the settings.json script? how do i take away the add screen and it just start the dl?
2011-07-01T21:38:00.000Z	sudokill	j^2	i think its show options windows false in settings.json
2011-07-01T21:39:00.000Z	sudokill	j^2	but settings.json shouldnt be needed, just go to edit preferences untick show options
