2010-03-07T15:14:00.000Z	Learner	ikonia	: thanx for the info, i already did that, i can run php as well, but i think i need to change some of the apache2 directives in order to make php execute in html files, it would be easy for me if i can find .htaccess in /var/www, but unfortunately i cant find it, any solution, thanx
