2010-07-06T09:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lucas-arg	That's not what makes a distro a rolling release distro. A rolling distro doesn't have releases at all.
2010-07-06T09:20:00.000Z	lucas-arg	Jordan_U	maco, i know the point u are refering, but... what im trying to know is if i just upgrade whenever 10.10 is out, from synaptic... im going to have lastest release (if i configure to do so) so i dont have to download the cd again and re-install all packages ive downloaded already...
