2004-10-06T15:00:00.000Z	Hmmmmm_	yojimbo-san	can i also copy this stuff to someone else's ubuntu install and save him the trouble of downloading it ?
2004-10-06T15:02:00.000Z	yojimbo-san		Hmmmm, in theory yes, I *think* but I'm not sure, that you should copy all these files back into the other machine's ...cache, and then run apt-get as normal - it will find the cached files, and if they;re still current, it'll use them instead of downloading new ones
2004-10-06T15:02:00.000Z	yojimbo-san	hawksmoor	- does the error happen while booting from the CD, or during the copying files process? Where did you get your CD from?
2004-10-06T15:04:00.000Z	Hmmmmm_	yojimbo-san	i'll giv it a shot
