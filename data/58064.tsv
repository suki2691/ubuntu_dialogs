2009-05-08T05:13:00.000Z	grzesiek		Hi! I'm trying to change gdm login screen through gnome administration menu... and nothing changes. Any ideas...?
2009-05-08T05:14:00.000Z	cgkades	grzesiek	what did you do to install the new gdm theme. or are you just trying to change it to one of the other ones that comes with ubuntu?
2009-05-08T05:14:00.000Z	cgkades		phantom: what command are you trying to run?
2009-05-08T05:14:00.000Z	grzesiek	cgkades	no, I didn't install anything
