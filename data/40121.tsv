2010-05-03T00:06:00.000Z	xfact		Sometimes when I update my APT database, it 'hit' the sources and packages rather then downloading, and it ends faster. Is it normal?
2010-05-03T00:06:00.000Z	hypetech	xfact	that means there is nothing new for it to grab
2010-05-03T00:06:00.000Z	xfact	hypetech	Oh, then it's absolute normal, thank you :)
