2008-09-20T13:40:00.000Z	chalcedony		i copied .xcat2 to .xchat3 in order to create another completely different instance of my irc client.. but it did not make another xchat icon in the dropdown menu, to start it. I can make another internet icon, but not the submenu icons. How can i start the second xchat?

2008-09-20T13:42:00.000Z	chalcedony	case^	so can xchat .. but *not* if you want it to auto join a bunch of totally different channels with two instance on the same network.
