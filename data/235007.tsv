2008-11-16T08:49:00.000Z	samacs		I'm trying to install ubuntu from a LiveCD but got this error telling me that the live cd cannot resize anypartition, I googled it and found that when a partition is damaged MBR protects partitions from being changed, is that right? so partitions cannot be made by live cd
