2010-05-23T01:50:00.000Z	tripelb		I have a drive that was a failed windows installation and somehow Transmission cant get permission even tho I can read and write to the drive. So how can I reformat the drive?

2010-05-23T01:55:00.000Z	tripelb	dksoba88	soba=noodles : funny, I am going to use the disk only to download the liveCD to burn it and then see if I can install windows on it (if this win-cd will work) -- I have a wireless card I bought that didnt work and I need to check it out with windows because they dont support linux.
