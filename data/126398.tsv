2007-09-25T08:23:00.000Z	drama1981	twoshadetod	i use convert x to dvd under wine
2007-09-25T08:23:00.000Z	drama1981		idk about a native linux app though
2007-09-25T08:23:00.000Z	twoshadetod	drama1981	i was thinking of going the wine route, i'd probally go svcd2dvd + tmpgenc - if that is still good, haven't done it in a while
