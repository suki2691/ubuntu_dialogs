2006-09-08T16:54:00.000Z	Adam_G		Hello all. In Xubuntu with XFce, I'm able to bind key sequences to commands. Can this be done in gnome? If so, how?
2006-09-08T16:55:00.000Z	skavenge	Adam_G	System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts
2006-09-08T16:56:00.000Z	Adam_G	skavenge	that's not it. I want to be able to actually define the command
2006-09-08T16:56:00.000Z	Adam_G	skavenge	like, control+pause->"mpc toggle"
