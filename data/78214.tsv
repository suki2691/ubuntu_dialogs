2009-02-10T18:04:00.000Z	GodfatherofEir1		Any ideas why my 8.10 install is becoming abnormally slow at startup? I think it has something to do with initializing the multimedia controller
2009-02-10T18:06:00.000Z	GodfatherofEir1		Well, how would I turn it off, considering that I'd have to modify startup procedure
2009-02-10T18:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	GodfatherofEir1	 i would disable the framebuffer/splash screen to look for any boot time error messages/clues as to whats going on.. If you have not allready done so
2009-02-10T18:09:00.000Z	GodfatherofEir1	Dr_willis	well it doesnt seem to have any errors though, but it just doesnt process, like, what happens, is that it goes to load the multimedia controler, and it takes about 10 seconds to load before it goes to load the other one
