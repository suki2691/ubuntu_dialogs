2010-10-16T23:03:00.000Z	sporkboy	Lxndr	I dunno, but I'm interested in the answer, as it tells me internet isn't a word sometimes ;)
2010-10-16T23:05:00.000Z	sporkboy		ok, this thing's begging for a restart for some reason.
2010-10-16T23:06:00.000Z	Lxndr	sporkboy	That could be because most dictionaries claim that Internet can only be a word while it's capitalized
