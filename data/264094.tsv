2006-06-17T06:32:00.000Z	phire		Could some one help me??
2006-06-17T06:32:00.000Z	phire		I'm having problem with my resolution in 6.06, I've setup my xorg.conf so it should allow me to set 1152x864 at 75hz, but it is stuck in 1024x768, and I can't change it in 'screen resolution preferences'.. My xorg.conf -- http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15838
2006-06-17T06:34:00.000Z	phire		I have the choice of 1024x768 at 70hz only
2006-06-17T06:34:00.000Z	neuro_	phire	at least you can get 70hz :P
