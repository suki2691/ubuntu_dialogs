2007-11-26T00:04:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	popern	the repositories are too different to allow an "upgrade" really
2007-11-26T00:04:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	popern	i do know someone who took damn small linux -> knoppix -> breezy badger -> etch
2007-11-26T00:04:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	popern	but that is very unlikely
