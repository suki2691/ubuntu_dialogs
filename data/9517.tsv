2011-09-18T13:41:00.000Z	Luca1		Hi! Yesterday I installed KDE on my Ubuntu system and since then Firefox is working very strangely. Fonts are rendered quite badly and back and forward buttons are always grayed out. Anyone who experienced this already?
2011-09-18T13:41:00.000Z	brokencodes	Luca1	do system update, and restart
2011-09-18T13:44:00.000Z	Luca1	brokencodes	update? System is up to date...
2011-09-18T13:50:00.000Z	Luca1	brokencodes	solved by removing the configuration directory. Don't know what happened.
