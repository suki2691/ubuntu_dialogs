2007-06-12T08:26:00.000Z	markymarkus		is there any GUI utility to create RPM files?
2007-06-12T08:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	markymarkus	 ubuntu uses debs so i doubt if any are in the repos. try a 'apt-cache search rpm' perhaps.
2007-06-12T08:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	markymarkus	 ive belive its possible to compile/make rpms - but no gui tool that i know of.
