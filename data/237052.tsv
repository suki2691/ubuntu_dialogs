2009-03-30T23:46:00.000Z	Nithrin		I have a Ubuntu installation problem. Anyone help please?
2009-03-30T23:48:00.000Z	Nithrin		I downloaded Ubuntu 8.10, and I burned the iso to a DVD and then restarted my computer and on reboot it just does not recognize the CD. I did go in and change the boot order, so I know that is not it. Perhaps I am not rebooting from DVD or whatever properly
2009-03-30T23:48:00.000Z	Nithrin		What is that? Apparently not
