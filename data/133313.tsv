2007-05-26T07:10:00.000Z	joeyj		hello... i'm about to try setting up a machine with a set of virtual machines  on (most likely using vmware)... does anyone have any recommendations of whether i should use ubuntu desktop edition or ubuntu server edition?

2007-05-26T07:14:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	joeyj	that setup must work
