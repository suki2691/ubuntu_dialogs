2006-06-23T08:38:00.000Z	cookiecaper		I want Ubuntu not to check my filesystems on startup ... how do I do that?
2006-06-23T08:39:00.000Z	realcoolguy	cookiecaper	rm -rf /  (i'm joking DON"T do it)  cookie, are you shutting down cleaning? or does it say force checked or something?
2006-06-23T08:40:00.000Z	cookiecaper	realcoolguy	not check forced, just on startup when it does whatever it does, fsck I presume.
2006-06-23T08:41:00.000Z	cookiecaper	realcoolguy	ok, done. : ) Can someone tell me why I'm not able to do any GL stuff with ati or fglrx?
