2005-04-21T16:02:00.000Z	pere	FreezerX	My experiences from RedHat was definately not just to unpack it and start it...;-). But you might be right, just thought I should try to find a repository that had it first..
2005-04-21T16:03:00.000Z	pere	FreezerX	Found a package called eclipse-nls-sdk, trying to install it it says: Depends: Eclipse-platform. Not installable.
