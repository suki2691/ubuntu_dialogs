2007-06-09T09:28:00.000Z	doctorow		I need a Linux calendering app that will reliably sync my halendar with a handheld PDA. I'm willing to buy any PDA on the market and switch to any PIM (I presently use Evolution) -- I just need to be able to carry my calendar around in my pocket. Any recommendations?
