2007-01-31T11:24:00.000Z	po0f	DHN_WP	What has changed between not getting the kernel panics and now?  Any upgrades of notice, hardware changes, etc?
2007-01-31T11:27:00.000Z	po0f	DHN_WP	A hardware issue is a more likely cause for a kernel panic than filesystem errors.
2007-01-31T11:27:00.000Z	DHN_WP	po0f	the panic is "Not syncing" VFS"
