2009-11-30T08:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dhaivat_	depends on hardware and such
2009-11-30T08:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dhaivat_	if your on 9.04,  may as well just stay with that untill 10.04,  since there isn't really anything ground braking in 9.10.  plus  if you try and upgrade from 9.04, you might get issues
2009-11-30T09:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dhaivat_	Ext4 will be even more stable in 10.04 :)
