2009-12-12T14:18:00.000Z	rwparris2		I have karmic installed on a flash drive.  Is it possible to install it from that to my harddrive (and keep settings and applications) or will I need the CD to do that?

2009-12-12T14:19:00.000Z	rwparris2	Dr_Willis	From the live CD I clicked install and then chose the flash drive as my installation drive.
2009-12-12T14:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rwparris2	 sounds like you did a 'normal' install to the flash drive.  I dont think you can install from that to another location then
