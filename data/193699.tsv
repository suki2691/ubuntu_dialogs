2006-08-27T12:01:00.000Z	matthewf		ok so i have installed the nfs stuff, but all the documentation i can find only covers shareing folders on the linux side to the mac side .. i want to use the share i have set up on the mac on the ubuntu box
2006-08-27T12:02:00.000Z	matthewf		so how do i get a nfs share that is on the mac, mounted to a folder on the ubuntu PC ?
