2012-04-30T16:51:00.000Z	Daghdha		Hello. After upgrading from 10.04-> 11.. -> 12.04 this weekend i seem to have lost my Transmission client. It was in the start menu.
2012-04-30T16:51:00.000Z	Daghdha		I see 6 transmission-xxxxxxx executables on the commandline but i have no idea wich one it is, does anyone know wich one the client is?
2012-04-30T16:52:00.000Z	Daghdha		ihave: -cli -create -edit -gtk -remote and -show
