2010-03-04T22:42:00.000Z	Samus_Aran		does anyone know if and how apt knows which version the distro is, for determining appropriate packages to install ?
2010-03-04T22:43:00.000Z	umbra_	Samus_Aran	does not apt use the same sources list?
2010-03-04T22:44:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	umbra_	suffah: so then how does it know what to install, if for instance you put two different version names ?
2010-03-04T22:47:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	umbra_	suffah: so any idea why a sources.list that only has 9.04 listed would not be able to apt-get install --reinstall any packages, saying none of them can be found ?
