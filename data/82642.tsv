2010-08-23T00:03:00.000Z	Andrew__		Hello, I have been using Teamviewer as a remote assistance for my Ubuntu friends who need help, question is: Is there an opensource product out there that is as slick as Teamviewer? It is soooo easy to use....
2010-08-23T00:04:00.000Z	Andrew__		Coolabra, its not, I'm being sincere..
2010-08-23T00:06:00.000Z	Andrew__		Another question: I see a new release is here 10.04.1  How do I upgrade to 10.04.1 from 10.04??? Or is it automatic via the regular updatyes???
