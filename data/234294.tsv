2005-07-07T10:24:00.000Z	tuks		Hey, this is my first time trying to compile and run a java application in Linux... Why won't it let me execute the .class I created?
2005-07-07T10:25:00.000Z	tuks		it didn't give me any errors when I used javac on it...
2005-07-07T10:26:00.000Z	tuks		but it says permission denied when I say ./javapp.class
2005-07-07T10:26:00.000Z	reka	tuks	what's the error when you try and execute?
