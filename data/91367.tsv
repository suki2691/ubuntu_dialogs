2008-05-08T18:23:00.000Z	Wraithan		Howdy, I am an arch user normally, setting up a computer for a buddy of mine who was having issues installing ubuntu a while back, anyway, I was just wondering if there is a reason to go with one of the older supported versions or if I should just grab the newest version for him?
2008-05-08T18:23:00.000Z	white_eagle	Wraithan	why not the newest one?
2008-05-08T18:24:00.000Z	Wraithan	white_eagle	that is what I am asking, all the versions are available still, I was just curious if there was a reason to go with a older one or if I should go with the newest
