2005-01-02T07:30:00.000Z	Dko		Could someone tell me what multiverse is? Maybe that would help me because it seams I require it. ><

2005-01-02T07:33:00.000Z	kayali	Dko	you want java right?
2005-01-02T07:34:00.000Z	kayali	Dko	Java is non free software, hence, it's found in a special ubuntu repository called multiverse
