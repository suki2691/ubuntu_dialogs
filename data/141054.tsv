2009-05-29T01:06:00.000Z	Malekar		hey everyone :) i'm trying to get hebrew to work correctly under jaunty. The font is fine, the thing is when i want to use punctuation marks such as a comma while typing in hebrew it doesn't work. the comma button is shared with a hebrew letter and it uses that hebrew letter. in windows you press Caps Lock or hold shift in order to add a special character with hebrew, in ubuntu it doesn't work that way
2009-05-29T01:07:00.000Z	Malekar		i went over the forums, and they mention a setting under keyboard layout called Group shift/lock behaviour. this doesn't appear under layout, alot of options do, that specifically doesn't. any thoughts?
