2005-03-24T10:58:00.000Z	zerovertex		I need some help. I wanted to get gnome 2.10 so I changed my /etc/apt/sources.list to hoary instead of warty and did "apt-get upgrade gnome" after about 45 minutes on my g3 powerbook it finished and I rebooted. now all the icons are just sheets of paper. it's a minor problem but it is an annoying problem. what can I do?

2005-03-24T10:59:00.000Z	zerovertex	knapjack	I don't want to upgrade everything, just gnome.
2005-03-24T11:00:00.000Z	zerovertex	knapjack	ah what the hell, okay, i'll do it
