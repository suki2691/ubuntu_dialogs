2007-10-22T16:48:00.000Z	morningmarigold		Hello! I just installed 7.10 then hooked up my windows drive as a slave, and edited menu.lst so grub would let me switch between win/lin without editing windows MBR. All boots fine, but when in gutsy I can not see my windows drive. Could i get some help with that?

2007-10-22T16:49:00.000Z	morningmarigold		thank you, I will look from there
