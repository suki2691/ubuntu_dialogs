2008-08-04T04:21:00.000Z	RequinB4	sweetgum	good luck, and i would try #wine, but it will probably require new development: http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=4813&sAllBugs
2008-08-04T04:23:00.000Z	sweetgum	RequinB4	Thanks. Could you tell me what server I could find an active #wine channel on? I'd like to contribute to the functionality of this software.
2008-08-04T04:24:00.000Z	RequinB4	sweetgum	well, no #wine is THAT active, but if you want to start developing (yay!), type /join #wine now, and start at winehq.org
