2010-03-31T02:50:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	Urda	I don't hate the swap, actually I like that, but I HATE ubuntu for not doing a poll
2010-03-31T02:51:00.000Z	Urda	MaximLevitsky	Bad idea, especially for users coming from Windows. I PRAY there is a way to change it via GUI
2010-03-31T02:52:00.000Z	MaximLevitsky	Urda	I agree with you. I hate the culture of removing options, and _then_ changing them
