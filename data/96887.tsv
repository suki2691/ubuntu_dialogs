2008-04-22T20:59:00.000Z	GamingX	rwycuff	How come it was working fine before installing Ubuntu?
2008-04-22T21:01:00.000Z	rwycuff	GamingX	first in my opinion windows/Drivers is horrible to begin with it coulda happened weather you had installed ubuntu or not its about the timing that it happend thats all
2008-04-22T21:12:00.000Z	GamingX	rwycuff	It happens when I install Ubuntu, doesn't it? So that makes it an Ubuntu issue.
