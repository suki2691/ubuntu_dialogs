2009-08-05T05:41:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	renic	OK, well then I guess I'll generate a new key.  How did it become lost?  Where was it before it was lost?
2009-08-05T05:41:00.000Z	renic	TwoToneSpirit	I dunno... I just read the ssh manpages.
2009-08-05T05:43:00.000Z	renic	TwoToneSpirit	did you try entering a blank passphrase?
