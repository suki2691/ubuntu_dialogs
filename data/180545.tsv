2006-06-12T07:03:00.000Z	logica_lmark		Does anyone here use XGL? I am trying to figure out what they mean when they say "super key"
2006-06-12T07:04:00.000Z	[GUARDiAN] 	logica_lmark	it's the windows-key on your keyboard
2006-06-12T07:06:00.000Z	[GUARDiAN] 	logica_lmark	strange... i can't currently look at my xgl-desktop since my opengl is b0rked
2006-06-12T07:07:00.000Z	[GUARDiAN] 	logica_lmark	np... i guess my "question" also has the "any ideas?"-bug, so it won't be answered *g*
