2008-02-18T16:39:00.000Z	singlesun	KevinMai	why not just stay with iptables that ubuntu already has?
2008-02-18T16:40:00.000Z	singlesun	KevinMai	ubuntu already uses IP tables.... if you would like a gui so you can see what its doing a little better... goto terminal "sudo apt-get install firestarter" you then will have a gui that you can use
2008-02-18T16:41:00.000Z	singlesun	KevinMai	should install as default to your "Applications -> Internet" tab
