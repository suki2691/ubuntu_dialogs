2011-10-14T19:37:00.000Z	brian_		after i removed pulse audio now it shows no audio devices
2011-10-14T19:39:00.000Z	brian_		is there another option than pulse audio to get my system sound back?
2011-10-14T19:40:00.000Z	reisio	brian_	pulse is extra on top of the ordinary sound system, ALSA, technically you can remove it
2011-10-14T19:42:00.000Z	brian_	reisio	how can i reinstall alsa maybe that will fix my broken sound?
