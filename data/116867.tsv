2008-04-27T19:38:00.000Z	danbhfive	LSD|Ninja	yeah, the issues with nvidia and ndiswrapper have me spooked.  I HAVE to have those working
2008-04-27T19:40:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	danbhfive	nvidia works for me (though I'm using an older driver I think as I only have a GF2MX) and I have a wireless card that works without ndiswrapper (atheros ftw) so I'm fine there. Having to manually fix my hosts list to get sudo working, add a dir for my printer driver and having to put up with a new, broken sharing system isn't cool
