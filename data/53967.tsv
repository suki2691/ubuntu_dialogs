2009-06-21T11:31:00.000Z	Webuu		Hello, what am I supposed to do to upgrade a Gutsy (7.10) server? Looks like the repositories don't exist anymore?

2009-06-21T11:35:00.000Z	Webuu	losher	BaudThief, ah I see - maybe I'll check out if I can find any old repositories available, if not then do a fresh install yep.
