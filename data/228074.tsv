2009-07-07T03:08:00.000Z	BloodyScum		I have been running a dual boot on this comp for a while of ubuntu 7.10 and XP now i have a laptop that i have made ubuntu the sole OS on, and i want to remove it from this desktop. i would also like to remove the boot loader from this drive without damaging the XP operating system, is that possible? and how?
