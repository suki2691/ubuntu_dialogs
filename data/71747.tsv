2009-02-12T02:48:00.000Z	Gabriel_		I got trouble with soundcard, audiosetup and software, windowmanager and i was missing some windows specific programs like Earmaster and Photoshop
2009-02-12T02:48:00.000Z	aiuw	Gabriel_	use GIMP for Photoshop
2009-02-12T02:49:00.000Z	Gabriel_	aiuw	GIMP has many differences and misses some features that are very important to me. Photoshop is commercial, it will always be some steps further
2009-02-12T02:51:00.000Z	Gabriel_	aiuw	but thanks for the suggestion. Maybe you could give me a good program for soundoptions
