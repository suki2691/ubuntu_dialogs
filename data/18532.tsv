2011-02-14T13:33:00.000Z	ale_		hi, I have a secondary disk in my PC, and it is not mounted. How can I figure out how to mount it?
2011-02-14T13:34:00.000Z	moth_woman	ale_	how is it formated?
2011-02-14T13:36:00.000Z	moth_woman	ale_	use fdisk -l to find out the device name, then sudo mount /dev/sdx -t ext3 /mnt/sdx x being the drive info you got from fdisk -l
