2010-11-24T05:09:00.000Z	heebie	Ddorda_dok	Did you install nVidia video drivers perchance?
2010-11-24T05:10:00.000Z	heebie		Hi. i've just installed 10.10, and for some reason..after updating to the nVidia drivers from nVidia.. the system won't boot anymore.  I haven't found any fixes online other than switching back to the "nv" driver (which uses xorg's nvidia driver that doesn't support 3d or acceleration) instead… and on top of that the system just won't boot.  Has anyone else run across this?
