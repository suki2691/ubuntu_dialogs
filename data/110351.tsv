2008-02-25T22:02:00.000Z	mibuk		I would like to create a package that not only wraps up a commercial application we want deployed to our linux workstations, but needs to update the default /etc/bash.bashrc to source an environment variable setup script.  Whats the best way of doing this.  obviously simply packaging a replacement bash.bashrc would be bad as someone may have customised it

2008-02-25T22:04:00.000Z	mibuk	DRebellion	seems a bit hacky
2008-02-25T22:05:00.000Z	DRebellion	mibuk	meh
