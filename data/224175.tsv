2005-08-21T13:56:00.000Z	Runofthemiller85		Q.  I'm trying to install Ubuntu and not having much luck.  When I get to the installation screen, I hit enter.  It shows 'loading vmlinux' and then maybe 'loading initrd', then my computer abruptly shuts off.
2005-08-21T13:58:00.000Z	Seveas	Runofthemiller85	use acpi=off on the command line before hitting enter
2005-08-21T14:03:00.000Z	Runofthemiller85	Seveas	I tried acpi=off, and the same problem occured.  Are there any other similar commands I can pass before installing?
2005-08-21T14:03:00.000Z	Seveas	Runofthemiller85	yes
