2007-11-07T16:05:00.000Z	oj		hey i just got nvidia 8600GTS and i'm trying to switch from my onboard ati video card. I change my BIOS primary display to PCI-EX but when ubuntu boots up the screen goes blank and monitor starts blinking. When I switch primary back to the onboard, ubuntu boots up. I used Envy to install nvida drivers and uninstall ati drivers, but still my monitor goes blank whenever I use boot ubuntu with the PCI-EX card...any advice?
