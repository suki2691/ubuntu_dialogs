2008-03-04T20:04:00.000Z	ComputerGuru		So I'm giving a course on Linus for beginners and I'll be using Ubuntu - but I have a real tough question
2008-03-04T20:04:00.000Z	ComputerGuru		what's the best way to teach when I have the only non-Windows machine in the lab?
2008-03-04T20:05:00.000Z	Slart	ComputerGuru	well.. you could teach them to install ubuntu on their machines.. learning to use linux without actually getting to use it would be hard
2008-03-04T20:06:00.000Z	Slart	ComputerGuru	but Odd-rationale seems to have got his coffee today .. I haven't.. the live cd is a much better option
