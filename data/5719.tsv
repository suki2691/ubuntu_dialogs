2012-06-29T00:25:00.000Z	aFeijo		I have 20 files without extension, I want to add .conf to all files. How can I do that?
2012-06-29T00:27:00.000Z	maquis	aFeijo	you could do a bash for-loop
2012-06-29T00:27:00.000Z	aFeijo	maquis	I found examples in google with a for loop, but none for for files without extension
