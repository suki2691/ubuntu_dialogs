2007-07-08T06:25:00.000Z	ubuntuEdg1	Shadow6363	still no luck , can i temporally stop my ip tables, home thins makes sense I'm a noobies
2007-07-08T06:27:00.000Z	Shadow6363	ubuntuEdg1	from my understanding, with default ubuntu installs, iptables will not be blocking anything you should need
2007-07-08T06:28:00.000Z	Shadow6363	ubuntuEdg1	if the port test doesnt work, i think it is likely more of a router config issue
