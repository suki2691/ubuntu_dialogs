2007-11-26T04:11:00.000Z	MasterShrek	ctp	nothing really except the alternate uses a text installer and the desktop is a live cd with a gui installer
2007-11-26T04:13:00.000Z	MasterShrek	ctp	go for it, kde is better btw =)
2007-11-26T04:14:00.000Z	ctp	MasterShrek	definitely it is. i have to setup 16 boxes at one time. kubuntu installing via fai is my goal
