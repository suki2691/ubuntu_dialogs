2008-09-25T14:32:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Hexus	It's an old-time tool - not available in the Ubuntu repositories now. Just wondered if it may help.
2008-09-25T14:34:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Hexus	there is a recent Debian package: http://www.roestock.demon.co.uk/isapnptools/
2008-09-25T14:35:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Hexus	that link refers to a good article on the subject of ISA cards, and using isapnptools: http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3269
