2009-08-28T05:06:00.000Z	KenSharp		evening all, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mesa/+bug/371750  I can't find apport-collect.  which package provides it?
2009-08-28T05:06:00.000Z	BioVore	KenSharp	apt-get install apport
2009-08-28T05:06:00.000Z	BioVore	KenSharp	looks like that file is in that package.
2009-08-28T05:07:00.000Z	KenSharp	BioVore	it's already installed.  i guess there's something wrong with my paths
