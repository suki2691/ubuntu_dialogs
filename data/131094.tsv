2008-07-04T06:38:00.000Z	xtknight	SchighSchagh	turtle beach montego DDL and sound blaster audigy2 series... (NOT x-fi though)
2008-07-04T06:39:00.000Z	SchighSchagh	xtknight	thanks. i'll look them up see which i like better :)
2008-07-04T06:42:00.000Z	xtknight	SchighSchagh	i just got the montego.  it's better for music and audio connectivity/etc (not sure if spdif-in is supported in linux or not).  audigy is good for hardware game acceleration, but linux doesnt support that anyway
