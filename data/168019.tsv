2006-10-11T11:02:00.000Z	JosefK	jadacyrus	you don't, it isn't safe, it may/may-not work
2006-10-11T11:02:00.000Z	JosefK	jadacyrus	on dapper you stand little chance, edgy is more optimistic
2006-10-11T11:03:00.000Z	JosefK	jadacyrus	you can use make-kpkg to build the kernel into .deb's, so it's fairly easy to remove - plenty of stuff on google about building a kernel for Debian/Ubuntu
