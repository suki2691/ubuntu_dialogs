2012-06-09T00:47:00.000Z	twig11		I just upgraded the integrated Intel graphics on a Dell Optiplex GX520 to an ATI Radeon 7000 card I had lying around. From what I read I should be able to get 3d graphics in ubuntu with that but it's falling back to unity2D every time. I've been searching this problem for awhile without any luck, and I could really use a helping hand on troubleshooting.
