2009-05-29T03:01:00.000Z	vanita_		when I'm running VLC on Ubuntu 9.04 with my i7 920 & Nvidia GTS 250 (AKA 9800gtx+ using G92 GPU), how can I tell if VLC is using VDPAU to decoded video directly (hardware compression h.264 for blu-ray for example) instead of putting most of the load on the CPU?
2009-05-29T03:03:00.000Z	vanita_		anyone have an idea on how to enable VDPAU for VLC in ubuntu 9.04 with supported Nvidia graphics cards?
