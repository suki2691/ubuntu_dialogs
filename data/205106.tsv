2005-12-08T16:03:00.000Z	hydroksyde	surfer	what do you mean no response? does it go straight back to shell?
2005-12-08T16:06:00.000Z	hydroksyde	surfer	I would ask you to "sudo cat /etc/sudoers" and stick the output on pastebin.com right now, but that wont work, obviously
2005-12-08T16:06:00.000Z	surfer	hydroksyde	right, no response
