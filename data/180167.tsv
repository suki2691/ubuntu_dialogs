2011-09-16T00:00:00.000Z	TheMatrix3000		I am running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Server Edition, which firewall software would you recommend for easy management?
2011-09-16T00:00:00.000Z	TheMatrix3000		does UFW create iptable rules?
2011-09-16T00:00:00.000Z	TheMatrix3000		or is it completely different
2011-09-16T00:01:00.000Z	jrib	TheMatrix3000	I believe it creates iptables rules, yes
