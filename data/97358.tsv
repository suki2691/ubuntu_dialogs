2008-06-26T06:00:00.000Z	[[thufir]]		is it possible to get stuck in a loop of running the update manager to from 7.10 to 8.x? I've already run it once and it's running again for a partial update.   http://www.papernapkin.org/pastebin/view/1398/
2008-06-26T06:01:00.000Z	RAdams	[[thufir]]	can you run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade and post the terminal output to pastebin?
2008-06-26T06:02:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	RAdams	the update manager is running right now, but I wlll.  thanks.  anything else?
2008-06-26T06:03:00.000Z	RAdams	[[thufir]]	just that for now. we're looking for what isn't resolving or being met to allow a complete upgrade
