2008-02-20T18:56:00.000Z	Andreysen		Hey guys! Need help: I'm trying to install Ubuntu 7 on my Laptop at the moment. When I boot with the downloaded CD the startup screen pops up and I choose option 1 to start/install Ubuntu. The loading bar in the next screen freezes and I have to switch off the Laptop physically. Any ideas??
