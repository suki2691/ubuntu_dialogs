2007-07-02T06:32:00.000Z	beruic		Hi, I have a huge problem with a Thinkpad 600E (Type: 2645 - 4A0). My Trackpoint is broken, and is unuseable. However it keeps sending mouse signals which makes it very hard to work sometimes. I have tried to comment out all synaptic stuff in xorg.conf, but it didn't work. What else can I do?

2007-07-02T06:33:00.000Z	beruic	supremesonic	I restarted the machine after it...
