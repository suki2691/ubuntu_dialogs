2010-05-26T10:12:00.000Z	Zenchess		I am trying to download source code from random packages in ubuntu repositories, in 'software sources' (10.04) "Source code" is in orange, but I can't make it have a checkmark without turning it white.  How do I get source code?

2010-05-26T10:13:00.000Z	Zenchess	actionParsnip	I can't make it do a checkmark, it only turns orange or white, everything else has a checkmark.  Also it's been orange for a while and I can't figure out how to get sources
