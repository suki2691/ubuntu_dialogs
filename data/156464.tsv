2007-09-11T07:23:00.000Z	reon		What tools can I use to recover files from a formatted HD ? User did not back up all his mail in winxp, hd was repartitioned and formatted to ext3 for ubuntu. Can I recover that mail ?
2007-09-11T07:24:00.000Z	genii	reon	Because of all the changes made, not a simple reformat in the same FS for instance, this is nearly impossible. you MAY get something if you send it to a data recovery place.
