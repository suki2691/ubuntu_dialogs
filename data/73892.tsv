2010-10-25T01:23:00.000Z	fester225		I'm trying to edit etc/fstab using vi. This doesn't work. Are there any SIMPLE editing programs I can use to edit fstab?
2010-10-25T01:24:00.000Z	blakkheim	fester225	vi is simple to me, maybe try nano
2010-10-25T01:25:00.000Z	fester225	blakkheim	At the end of editing I typed zz and vi didn't save or quit.
2010-10-25T01:26:00.000Z	blakkheim	fester225	maybe read some vim tutorials
