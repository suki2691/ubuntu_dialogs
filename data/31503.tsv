2010-05-21T01:31:00.000Z	UT8F	Youresorock	I dont need any barcode reader via usb or web cam, I need barcode reader software, where I could type in barcode number and it whould show where that product was made
2010-05-21T01:32:00.000Z	Youresorock	UT8F	Oh sorry, I misunderstood.  I don't know of any software like that.
