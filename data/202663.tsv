2006-01-10T13:32:00.000Z	Terrasque	purpleheart_USMC	the dvd version got more stuff on it
2006-01-10T13:32:00.000Z	purpleheart_USMC	Terrasque	like what?
2006-01-10T13:33:00.000Z	Terrasque	purpleheart_USMC	dunno. only real difference I've noticed is that it installed an optimized kernel for my machine. But I always replace the apt sources.list asap..
