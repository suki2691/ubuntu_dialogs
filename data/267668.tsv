2009-06-09T20:35:00.000Z	Paulo39		is there any danger in adding this repo: ppa.launchpad.net/kubuntu-ppa/backports/ubuntu to my GNOME? i have ubuntu 9.04
2009-06-09T20:35:00.000Z	Paulo39		and i'm doing this to upgrade my amarok
2009-06-09T20:37:00.000Z	maco	Paulo39	that's fine
2009-06-09T20:37:00.000Z	maco	Paulo39	it's maintained by kubuntu developers and mixing kubuntu & ubuntu is just dandy
