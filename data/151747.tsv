2007-11-26T14:08:00.000Z	TiJay		I'm trying to install Pixel and it doesn't say which libsdl it needs
2007-11-26T14:10:00.000Z	TiJay		will deb packinstaller automatically install dependencies?
2007-11-26T14:10:00.000Z	capiira	TiJay	 see if its installed then do a symlink to the file with the name that pixel is searching for
2007-11-26T14:11:00.000Z	capiira	TiJay	sometimes ubuntu debian libs are named different as *.so.1 or so then a non repo app can't find it
