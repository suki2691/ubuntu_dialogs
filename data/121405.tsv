2007-09-20T08:48:00.000Z	borovy3488		ok, I have been trying for hours to burn an iso image made from DeVeDe.  I have tried Gnoe Baker, K3B, and the built in image burner, always get an input/output error.  Any ideas?  I have burned a dvd on here before, and I used Gnome Baker

2007-09-20T08:51:00.000Z	borovy3488	sixpence	is cdrecord preinstaled? if so I have already tried it.  Synaptic says I already have it installed.
