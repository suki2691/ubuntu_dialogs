2007-10-13T12:14:00.000Z	Redneck|Ubuntu		anyone willing to help a n00b trying to get what ever version of gutsy is out?
2007-10-13T12:15:00.000Z	cdm10	Redneck|Ubuntu	Nope, because first of all, this is not the place to ask about Gutsy, and second of all, noobs should not be using Gutsy.
2007-10-13T12:15:00.000Z	cdm10	Redneck|Ubuntu	At least wait until the 18th, when it's released...
