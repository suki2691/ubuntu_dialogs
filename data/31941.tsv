2011-03-07T16:35:00.000Z	RPMcMurphy		i just posted my problem
2011-03-07T16:35:00.000Z	botcity	RPMcMurphy	i would get a 10.10ubuntu  live disk from somewhere and just use that as you can install, try , or adjust partitions all from cd
2011-03-07T16:38:00.000Z	botcity	RPMcMurphy	can you download another disk 10.04 or 10.10 ? make sure you checksum the iso..
