2008-11-01T08:55:00.000Z	NkZ830_		Ripps: Even the partition manager recognizes my 1st HD is using NTFS, but I cant even mount it from linux, which is weird too.
2008-11-01T08:56:00.000Z	jim_p	NkZ830_	does that ntfs drive come from a bad shutdown?
2008-11-01T08:57:00.000Z	NkZ830_	jim_p	Negative to that. I Just booted from the 8.10 CD, installed and bang, GRUB messed up.
2008-11-01T08:58:00.000Z	jim_p	NkZ830_	grub is irrelevant to ntfs not being read
