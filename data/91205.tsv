2008-06-18T17:07:00.000Z	age6racer		Hi all, I have had a long-term problem with slow searching in Evolution. It only affects one of my mailboxes. I thought that upgrading might help but it hasn't. Does anyone have any advice for me abotu how to fix the issue? I guess there is something in the mailbox file which Evolution is having trouble with.
