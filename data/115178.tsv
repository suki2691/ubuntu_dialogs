2007-10-26T04:15:00.000Z	adayah		Im using ubuntu studio 7.10 and can´t get the darn nvidia drivers installed right manually or with envy.  all the dependencies are satisfied.  I´m quite at a loss and confused
2007-10-26T04:15:00.000Z	d0ll4_	adayah	why you dont use the restricted driver manager?
2007-10-26T04:16:00.000Z	d0ll4_	adayah	 no
2007-10-26T04:17:00.000Z	d0ll4_	adayah	install linux-restricted-modules
