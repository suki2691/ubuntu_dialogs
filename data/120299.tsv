2008-06-24T22:27:00.000Z	milaks		Hi guys. I'm trying to install ubuntu from image on hard disk (CD isnt option). I did the following short steps: http://paste.ubuntu.com/22658/ as described on this page: http://www.instantfundas.com/2007/08/install-any-linux-distro-directly-from.html Installaltion process starts cleanly but stops in "detectin CD rom" step because it isnt working. Is there a way to workaroudn this problem?
2008-06-24T22:28:00.000Z	milaks		should I maybe try it with some other non-CD based image, if so can someone please tell me where can I download those other version (like for installing over net... dunno)
