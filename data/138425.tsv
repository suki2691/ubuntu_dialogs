2011-02-21T17:36:00.000Z	magnetron	kyo	currently, not much. except they're developed by different groups with different philosophies
2011-02-21T17:38:00.000Z	magnetron	kyo	libreoffice is same as go-oo.o, those two are both better than oo.o
2011-02-21T17:38:00.000Z	magnetron	kyo	ubuntu is shipped with go-oo.o
