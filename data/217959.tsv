2005-09-24T13:46:00.000Z	oO[NOVA] Oo	Blissex	i create a file called mountsmbshares in /etc/init.d/ and i put this command in: sudo mount -t smbfs "//192.168.0.250/ADMIN 2" "/mnt/smb/192.168.0.250/ADMIN 2" -o username=narf,password=narf,rw,fmask=777 and i ran init-rc.d mountsmbshares defaults to get it hooked up, but it's not working.
2005-09-24T13:47:00.000Z	oO[NOVA] Oo	Blissex	the command does work when executed from a root terminal.
