2006-01-09T13:28:00.000Z	everett_	mwe	I installed gnome-devel, package, etc. But I forgot about build-essential. :/
2006-01-09T13:33:00.000Z	everett_	mwe	after two weeks of work, trying to get this stupid electron microscope software working (not even tested the hardware yet) I finally passed the last hurdle. Words cannot express how thankful I am. Now that I'm almost done with this software, hopefully I can get the electron microscope working, and then I can get back to working on the funding request proposal for a research center. thanks.
