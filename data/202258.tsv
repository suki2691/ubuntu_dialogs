2010-02-25T08:16:00.000Z	iggimin		I'm working on a friend's machine where I recently installed Karmic and now it's stuck at "grub rescue>" -- any idea what's happening?
2010-02-25T08:18:00.000Z	iggimin		is it possible to re-install grub without a full Ubuntu reinstall?
2010-02-25T08:18:00.000Z	IdleOne	iggimin	grub or grub2?
