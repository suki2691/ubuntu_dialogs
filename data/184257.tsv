2006-05-30T07:44:00.000Z	maikol		and how do i remove gnome... runs too slow on my 64 meg ram comp
2006-05-30T07:44:00.000Z	planetcall	maikol	apt-get install kde-desktop  to install kde incase you dont like to use gnome
2006-05-30T07:45:00.000Z	maikol	planetcall	i would prefer kde, but any desktop is too much for 64mb ram
