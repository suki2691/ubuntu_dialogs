2007-10-05T11:48:00.000Z	jumbalia		So here's a broad question.  What is the main difference between distro's of linux
2007-10-05T11:50:00.000Z	jumbalia		Am I missing out on using Ubuntu voer other distro's I haven't tried?  Or can I pretty much do the same thing in all of them, just different ways of doing it.  I only want to learn linux and mess around with linux gaming, so nothing major
