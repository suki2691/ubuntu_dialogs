2011-05-10T01:19:00.000Z	Zachriel		Is there a good discussion of 32 vs. 64 bit Ubuntu, the download page recommends 32-bit but I'm not sure why!
2011-05-10T01:19:00.000Z	wad	Zachriel	I'm using 64-bit, and it's great. No problems.
2011-05-10T01:19:00.000Z	wad	Zachriel	how much RAM do you have in the box?
2011-05-10T01:20:00.000Z	Zachriel	wad	Laptop with 3GN of RAM. It comfortably runs Windows 7, 64bit at the moment.,
