2006-09-02T09:23:00.000Z	vincenz		Why is totem-gstreamer unable to handle any formats?
2006-09-02T09:24:00.000Z	vincenz		I'm constantly usign the old totem version, cause at least xine can handle some formats
2006-09-02T09:24:00.000Z	HeathenDan	vincenz	maybe your totem-gstreamer doesn't have the proper codecs
2006-09-02T09:25:00.000Z	vincenz	HeathenDan	heh... I install zillions of codecs to no avail, I'm always dissapointed by gstreamer
