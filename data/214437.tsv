2005-10-11T16:07:00.000Z	Crell		Hey, folks.  I'm considering Ubuntu for a small office server, but I'm having trouble finding docs on what actual versions of various packages Ubuntu ships with.  Is that information available anywhere?  (Eg, PHP 4.what?  Samba 3.what?  Subversion 1.what?)
2005-10-11T16:08:00.000Z	Crell		I've not been able to find actual versions on the web site yet, for any release.  (I'd be interested in Breezy, I suppse.)
