2010-09-07T14:36:00.000Z	sniperjo		i keep getting search for a suitable plugin when playing videos in firefox using the mozilla-plugin-vlc on ubuntu, when i cancel the dialog the video plays. Any ideas how to fix / stop the dialog from comming up ?

2010-09-07T14:40:00.000Z	sniperjo	magnetron	 if i go onto plugins in firefox i have a dropbox where i can select either VLC totem compatable or VLC , if i use just vlc, the player just shows "waiting for video"
