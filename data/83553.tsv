2008-08-12T05:15:00.000Z	sabayonlive-6049		I keep getting data from old partitions reappearing in new partitions made in the same place, even when I delete the old partitions. Why is this and how can I fix it?
2008-08-12T05:15:00.000Z	qr	sabayonlive-6049	you could zero the partition with dd
2008-08-12T05:15:00.000Z	sabayonlive-6049	usser	What if I actually delete the partition itself?
2008-08-12T05:16:00.000Z	qr	sabayonlive-6049	ie, zero the partition then format it and install a new os
