2009-01-28T01:43:00.000Z	phorensic	jcapinc	doesn't that happen automagically?
2009-01-28T01:44:00.000Z	jcapinc	phorensic	unfortunatelly it doesnt, the filenames are required to be .php or .phtml
2009-01-28T01:45:00.000Z	phorensic	jcapinc	i thought you can just do like a <?php yadda yada .. .> and it will be paresed by php
