2006-09-12T13:02:00.000Z	el_capitan|afk		could somebody tell me how to get permission to move a folder to another folder
2006-09-12T13:02:00.000Z	el_capitan|afk		is there a way to just have it recognise me a root or owner or whatever all the time
2006-09-12T13:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	el_capitan|afk	which folder to which folder ?
2006-09-12T13:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	el_capitan|afk	if the sj=kins folder is in ~/.amsn or whatever it should not need special privileges
