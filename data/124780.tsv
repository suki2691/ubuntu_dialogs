2007-08-13T13:22:00.000Z	discodave		Hi guys and gals, just a question if anyone is willing to help - Can someone tell my why ubuntu prompts me for a password when connecting to my home wireless network and secondly is tearing a common problem with compbiz?
2007-08-13T13:22:00.000Z	MasterShrek	discodave	it prompts you for a password because you need root priviledges to change network settings, as for compiz, you shold join #ubuntu-effects

2007-08-13T13:23:00.000Z	discodave	MasterShrek	thanks. But ubuntu connects to be neighbors network without me asking...but when i reselect mine it asks for a password. Does the network manager have a favourite network to connect to automatically?
