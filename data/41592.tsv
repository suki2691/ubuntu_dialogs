2012-04-15T23:37:00.000Z	ceti331		anyone know there way around stl
2012-04-15T23:37:00.000Z	ceti331		beyond just using it,
2012-04-15T23:38:00.000Z	ceti331		i'm curious to know if there is a standard version of std::vector where capacity always = size, i.e. no information is stored relevant to dynamic resizing
2012-04-15T23:39:00.000Z	ssta	ceti331	maybe ask in #c++ ?
