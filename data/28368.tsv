2012-08-30T08:30:00.000Z	luftikuss	loneTiger	Please note that my nick includes a letter "k". --  To have to install another 3 systems does not justify to make a Ubuntu distribution. You might consider making a CD containing almost all the files you need foryour 3 installations. This is much less work load than making an Ubuntu distribution.
