2006-10-24T14:21:00.000Z	crochat		I have upgraded my system to Edgy, and I saw that now, the partitions are named with UUID in fstab ! That's great... but how to deal with UUID ? If I change my partitions, how can I know which new UUID I must write in the fstab ?

2006-10-24T14:24:00.000Z	POVaddct	crochat	i don't know
