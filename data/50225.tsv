2010-01-06T23:49:00.000Z	_UsUrPeR_		ok, one more time. I just updated my 9.04 server to 9.10, and I got a warning that /boot/ is full. What can I delete in there that will free up some space? For the record, apt-get autoclean/clean has no effect
2010-01-06T23:51:00.000Z	przemo_one	_UsUrPeR_	great nick. easy one. it apears that your root / or /boot partition is full
2010-01-06T23:51:00.000Z	przemo_one	_UsUrPeR_	tell us is /boot a separate or a dir on /
2010-01-06T23:52:00.000Z	przemo_one	_UsUrPeR_	so go there and remove an old unused kernel perhaps
