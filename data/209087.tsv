2005-11-23T08:20:00.000Z	senectus		Guys my internal DNS is bloody spotty and crap, because of the dumb little modem router I have... What DNS server would you recommend for a bit of a n00b (but not a complete idiot ;-) )
2005-11-23T08:22:00.000Z	Terminus	senectus	maek your own. :)
2005-11-23T08:23:00.000Z	senectus	Terminus	yeah that's what I mean.. is there serveral sorts of DNS server or is there just one generic package?
2005-11-23T08:23:00.000Z	Terminus	senectus	almost everybody uses bind for that. you're probably gonna have to do some reading to set it up correctly though.
