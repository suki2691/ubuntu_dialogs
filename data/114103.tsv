2008-08-05T22:56:00.000Z	amirman		how does netbooting work? i'm trying to install ubuntu on a laptop that refuses to boot from the cd drive
2008-08-05T22:56:00.000Z	maybeway36	amirman	you can boot the netboot kernel from hard drive, USB drive, or the network (hardest)
2008-08-05T22:56:00.000Z	maybeway36		unetbootin is a good choice probably
2008-08-05T22:57:00.000Z	amirman	maybeway36	thanks
