2011-07-26T04:41:00.000Z	bencc		is there a way I can make ubuntu ask my router to assign a ipv6 instead ipv4?
2011-07-26T04:41:00.000Z	Blue1	bencc	depends on 2 things - software in the router, and whether isp offers ipv6
2011-07-26T04:42:00.000Z	bencc	Blue1	if the router is getting ipv4 from the isp, can't it provide ipv6 for ubuntu?
2011-07-26T04:43:00.000Z	Blue1	bencc	this is a question the isp must answer - cox for instance does NOT currently provide ipv6
