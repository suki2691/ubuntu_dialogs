2011-08-08T14:06:00.000Z	ProstheticS		hey guys, im more or less wondering a little about the basics of disk access in linux/ubuntu here but: if i write a cron job, that is going to do an ls on 3 directories, and possibly write that to a file, is this going to prevernt my harddrives from going to sleep, or is there some form of disk cacheing that will save me from the above?
2011-08-08T14:08:00.000Z	ProstheticS		oh bummer, so my disks would basically never go to sleep if i set that ?
2011-08-08T14:09:00.000Z	ProstheticS		is there a nice way to 'check' the output of ls?
