2007-04-19T10:12:00.000Z	peter78		I'm using fiesty beta, supposedly when the final release is in the repos I'll just update as usual and don't need to upgrade the distro?

2007-04-19T10:13:00.000Z	peter78	Angeluz	ok so I've already got the packages?
2007-04-19T10:13:00.000Z	Angeluz	peter78	If there are none left in the update manager, then yes.
