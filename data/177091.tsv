2009-06-03T01:56:00.000Z	id10t		got a grub question... have ubuntu 9.04 on a usb drive, works fine to boot on several computers that are like where it was installed... other machines (more drives) give an error 2... I'm assuming this is the hd(X,Y) for the / partition changing.. but, when I edit the grub line during boot, it won't tab-complete device names/UUIDs/etc
