2007-10-31T05:13:00.000Z	bobbob1016		I'm doing a speech on Linux tomorrow, focusing on Ubuntu.  I am just curious how many of you have had experience with installing on a computer with XP or Vista on it already, and if the auto-resize NTFS partitions works well.  I'm also planning on having some LiveCD's with me incase anyone wants them.

2007-10-31T05:14:00.000Z	Macros42	bobbob1016	for my first tryout I installed on a XP box - resized the partition fine and dual booted it - easy as pie
2007-10-31T05:17:00.000Z	Macros42	bobbob1016	that's what I thought - it's works perfectly in my experience
