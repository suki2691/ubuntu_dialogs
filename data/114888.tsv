2008-06-19T22:06:00.000Z	doubled	Guest85269	you can install software in 4 different ways ( at least thats how i do it ) you can go to Apllications and then to add\remove programs. Second option is to go to System then Administration and then Synaptic. Third way is to download .deb packages from the internet for the program you like. the forementioned is all for linux apllications
