2007-07-04T06:30:00.000Z	Skaag		can I somehow tell openoffice that comes with my ubuntu to anti-alias the lines in drawings I make?
2007-07-04T06:30:00.000Z	Skaag		is this at all related to the operating system, or is it a thing specific to openoffice alone?
2007-07-04T06:31:00.000Z	stefg	Skaag	this is related to openoffice interacting with xorg. so it's partly ubuntu, partly openoffice related
2007-07-04T06:37:00.000Z	Skaag	stefg	sorry about the delayed response, yes, I just found a bug report for this with many votes (more then 130) on the openoffice feature request list, so it is being taken care of slowly. Until then I export to PDF and it looks just great when in PDF format.
