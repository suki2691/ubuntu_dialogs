2007-07-18T15:27:00.000Z	kduboi1	flashbak	i think its the other way around. ivtv are the drivers
2007-07-18T15:31:00.000Z	kduboi1	flashbak	try compiling from source. perhaps they made two different builds for edgy and fiesty or whatever you used to use. i take it you're using a digitial card then
2007-07-18T15:34:00.000Z	kduboi1	flashbak	have you tried other ways to verify the drivers are working/not working?
