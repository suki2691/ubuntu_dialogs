2007-05-22T09:35:00.000Z	rukuartic		Is there anything in linux like 'start service' for RedHat? I'm curious :P
2007-05-22T09:36:00.000Z	h3xis	rukuartic	you do it by running /etc/init.d/<service name> start|stop|restart
2007-05-22T09:40:00.000Z	rukuartic	h3xis	I know... its just much cooler to do start-service /whatever/
2007-05-22T09:41:00.000Z	h3xis	rukuartic	you cant do that in ubuntu
