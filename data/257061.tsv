2006-01-13T14:10:00.000Z	holotone		My laptop has a HDD with two NTFS partitions, one 14GB, one 40GB for storage. I want to turn this XP machine into a dualboot w/ Ubuntu. Would it be safe to just back up the first (14GB partition), wipe it, and do the dual boot install, and not worry about backing up the data partition?
