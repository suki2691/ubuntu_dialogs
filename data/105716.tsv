2008-04-16T04:52:00.000Z	MrStitch		If I want to install a new piece of hardware, do I need to contact the manufacturer for linux drivers, or does Ubuntu have some other type of system?
2008-04-16T04:53:00.000Z	Elevator_Hazard	MrStitch	pretty sure it depends on the drivers
2008-04-16T04:53:00.000Z	Elevator_Hazard	MrStitch	some companies aren't so good with linux drivers
