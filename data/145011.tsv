2007-11-07T21:16:00.000Z	fxfitz		I've upgraded to Gutsy, and it seems like my Suspend and Hibernate options on my laptop do not work. Before, when the computer was in Suspend, the power light would slowly oscillate on and off. Now it just stays on all the time, and I can't revive it without manually rebooting. Can anyone help?

2007-11-07T21:18:00.000Z	hendrixski		is there a way to change the part before the $ on the terminal?
2007-11-07T21:18:00.000Z	fxfitz	hendrixski	Right. Thank you!
