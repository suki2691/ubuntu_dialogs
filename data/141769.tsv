2007-03-23T14:00:00.000Z	Fouad		I just installed Ubuntu to dual boot with my WinXP, but I need GCC to compile my modem's driver
2007-03-23T14:02:00.000Z	Fouad		bruening: the fact that my modem doesn't work(without the driver that i need to compile) under linux should make that quite difficult

2007-03-23T14:02:00.000Z	Fouad	jrib	will try that, thanks
