2011-02-20T04:07:00.000Z	scarface		How can I mount an SSH directory via the command line?  It seems to happen automatically via Nautilus when I use a "ssh://whatever" URL, and the location gets mounted in ~/.gvfs.  I'd like to be able to do the mounting by hand from the command line.

2011-02-20T04:08:00.000Z	scarface	erUSUL	sshfs came up in some searches, but it's not already installed on my system.  So I thought there might be another way to do it, since it already works via Nautilus
