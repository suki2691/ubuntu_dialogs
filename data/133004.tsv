2007-09-01T16:30:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon		I've tried googling "virtual serial port linux" but that seems to get me usb to serial converters and drivers for them... What would an actual virtual driver be called? Would it be difficult to write one?

2007-09-01T16:32:00.000Z	Ar-Pharazon	predaeus	That doesn't sound very simple... Would you happen to know which module that is?
2007-09-01T16:32:00.000Z	predaeus	Ar-Pharazon	no sorry.
