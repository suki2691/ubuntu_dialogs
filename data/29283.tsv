2010-10-20T11:51:00.000Z	Karen_m		why does php5-fpm not exist in the aptitude repository?
2010-10-20T11:51:00.000Z	maco	Karen_m	it's in 10.10's repo...
2010-10-20T11:52:00.000Z	Karen_m	maco	is there a way for me to install it without upgrading to 10.10?
2010-10-20T11:53:00.000Z	maco	Karen_m	you could download the source package from 10.10 and locally rebuild it into a deb that might work wtih 10.04's php
