2007-06-29T09:27:00.000Z	SlimG		What driver should be chosen for a ATI Mobile 1300 ?
2007-06-29T09:28:00.000Z	Vlet	SlimG	The 'restricted drivers' tool should install the right one...
2007-06-29T09:28:00.000Z	Vlet	SlimG	although you won't be able to get hardware acceleration working
2007-06-29T09:29:00.000Z	SlimG	Vlet	X won't start, so I need to know the exact driver, I guess that means I need to use the "ati" driver?
