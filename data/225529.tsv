2005-08-02T15:41:00.000Z	Amaranth		btw, where can i find splash images and where do i put them to make grub use them?
2005-08-02T15:41:00.000Z	godzirra_	Amaranth	Well...  It works from the command line but when I boot and it tries to load the image behind while its booting, I get funky looking ascii crap.
