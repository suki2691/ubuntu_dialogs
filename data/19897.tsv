2011-12-11T13:18:00.000Z	edson		Lubuntu does not use all of my RAM. I have 2GB RAM but only 991mb is used. Anyone can help me?
2011-12-11T13:20:00.000Z	pnorman	edson	are you doing something that you would expect to use up all of your ram with? if you're not doing anything, the ram isn't going to be used
