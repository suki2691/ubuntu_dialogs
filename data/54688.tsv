2009-08-15T03:31:00.000Z	ascheel	A4O_91	Counterstrike is not free software.  I would advise you try valve's website to look for a Linux client.
2009-08-15T03:39:00.000Z	ascheel	A4O_91	CounterStrike is not free software and this channel will not provide links for it illegally.  I recommend you look into purchasing it and then you can ask #wine how to run it in Linux
2009-08-15T03:39:00.000Z	ascheel	A4O_91	that's assuming there is in fact no linux client available
