2009-06-26T02:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pooky_	  you might want to read up on a bash tutorial or 2 to learn the basics.  Rember Directory names ARE case senesetive also.
2009-06-26T02:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pooky_	 some times you jsut have to spend an hr and read through some very basic beginner guides to learn what people are talking about. IRC is not a replacent for that.
2009-06-26T02:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pooky_	 theres a good site - google for 'learn the command line' (i forget the url)
