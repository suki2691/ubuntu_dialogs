2009-06-08T12:00:00.000Z	nerovengene		I downloaded Ubuntu 9 desktop... I cant get to see any development libraries in the package manager. why is that?
2009-06-08T12:00:00.000Z	hoohaah	nerovengene	maybe they're not available on the cd
2009-06-08T12:00:00.000Z	hoohaah	nerovengene	did you add an online ubuntu repo to apt sources?
2009-06-08T12:00:00.000Z	nerovengene	hoohaah	I've checked all the repositories too.. all are selected, including sources
