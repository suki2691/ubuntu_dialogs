2007-06-08T10:39:00.000Z	ShadowRelic		hello, ive been trying to get a driver for my tablet pc pen (i dont think it exists) but i ran into a source that was talking about using windows drivers in a wrapper for linux, does anyone have any info on this?
2007-06-08T10:41:00.000Z	levander	ShadowRelic	maybe they're talking about ndiswrapper??  i know people use that for wireless card drivers
2007-06-08T10:41:00.000Z	ShadowRelic	levander	could be, would that work for any driver?
2007-06-08T10:42:00.000Z	levander	ShadowRelic	i don't know, that's a guess, it's worth looking into
