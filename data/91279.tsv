2008-05-10T06:35:00.000Z	Derander	lorenzo_	system->preferences->appearance->visual effects
2008-05-10T06:36:00.000Z	lorenzo_	Derander	yeah that is what i thought, i can only select No effects, normal or Additional effects there. I do not see the plugins tab
2008-05-10T06:37:00.000Z	Derander	lorenzo_	Ah, you'll have to install "compizconfig-settings-manager".  in terminal: sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
