2007-09-24T11:29:00.000Z	iownyou		does anybody know how to mount the root partition, chroot and edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf vert refresh and horizon sync?
2007-09-24T11:29:00.000Z	cast	iownyou	why bother with chroot? why not just boot at a run level that doesn't start x? or just boot normally and switch out of x [if you can] 
2007-09-24T11:29:00.000Z	cast	iownyou	there's no reason to chroot if you're just editting a text file
