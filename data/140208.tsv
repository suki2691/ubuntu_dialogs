2009-05-12T18:57:00.000Z	Leszczoman		My brother wanted to install Ubuntu 9.04. He checked the full instalation and in the half ot this the battery in the laptop ended. When he turned on the laptop, there is a notice 'Windows couldn't start because the following file is missing. Re-install it' and there is somethnig about Win root
2009-05-12T18:57:00.000Z	Leszczoman		What to do?
