2009-11-16T01:00:00.000Z	dragon_reborn		I am a newbie and need some help please
2009-11-16T01:02:00.000Z	dragon_reborn		I upgraded to 9.10 from 9.04, (I am running the mythbuntu distro) now the movies that where playing fine before don't play.
2009-11-16T01:04:00.000Z	pietje	dragon_reborn	can you give more details? What kind of movies, what player, what happens when you try to play a movie
2009-11-16T01:07:00.000Z	pietje	dragon_reborn	i do not know mythbuntu myself, on normal ubuntu I would start mplayer in a terminal and look for any error messages
