2004-12-04T09:46:00.000Z	cbpye		Hi, My name's CBPye, I'm somewhat new to debain-ish distros, and was wondering how I could easily install this deb I downloaded?
2004-12-04T09:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cbpye	the answer is probably: don't. Instead use the synaptic package manager
2004-12-04T09:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cbpye	what is the .deb?
2004-12-04T09:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cbpye	OK in that case it won't be in the repositories. You can try using :  sudo dpkg -i <name_of_deb>
