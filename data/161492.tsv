2008-10-13T00:11:00.000Z	kkrusty		I need to know where I am at with trying to have wifi work on my laptop. I can do a iwlist scan but I cant connect yet. So does this mean that my wlan driver is configured correctly?
2008-10-13T00:11:00.000Z	gord_	kkrusty	have you tried using the gnome network manager?
2008-10-13T00:12:00.000Z	kkrusty	gord_	the horrible news is that I dont have display and Im entirely depending on ssh over an ethernet link
2008-10-13T00:12:00.000Z	kkrusty	gord_	and so I dont have X
