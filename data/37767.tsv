2011-03-23T08:24:00.000Z	GeForce88		apport on 11.04 is buggy. can't file bug report because it faults out. any ideas how to report the fail ?
2011-03-23T08:25:00.000Z	ohsix	GeForce88	"faults out", does apport crash or say that type of crash can't be reported? also, you might try #ubuntu+1
2011-03-23T08:26:00.000Z	GeForce88	ohsix	windows pops up says sorry, apport has unexpectantly closed. do you wish to file a bug report blah blah, click to report and system freeses
2011-03-23T08:27:00.000Z	ohsix	GeForce88	peculiar, afaik apport is mostly python, if it were crashing something would be seriously amiss
