2007-10-26T23:23:00.000Z	pjz		if a 'safe gnome session' works but my normal gnome session doesn't (in gutsy), what do I need to change to make my normal one more like the 'safe' on ?
2007-10-26T23:23:00.000Z	hwilde	pjz	hit e or o in the grub menu to see the options safe mode puts on the kernel
2007-10-26T23:24:00.000Z	pjz	hwilde	not the safe mode in the grub menu, the 'safe session' from the gpm session menu
2007-10-26T23:24:00.000Z	hwilde	pjz	oh i don't know where that session menu comes from
