2011-12-30T00:16:00.000Z	brophat		i have cairo dock installed but i want to uninstall it
2011-12-30T00:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	brophat	 and how did you install it?
2011-12-30T00:17:00.000Z	brophat	dr_willis	I forget but I probably did an apt-get
2011-12-30T00:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	brophat	 then you use the pacakge manager tools to remove it.
