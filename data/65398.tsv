2009-02-26T21:28:00.000Z	klystik		Hi, I edited the cron.deny file, removed the user "nobody" and added "nobody" in cron.allow. I can now create a cron command like "crontab /path/to/command.txt", how would I edit this cron in the future from command line though? Without editing the file where crons are listed?

2009-02-26T21:34:00.000Z	klystik	Seveas	how do I exit from crontab -e? (ssh n00b)
