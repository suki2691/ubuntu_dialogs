2010-05-03T01:08:00.000Z	R0b0t1		Hello. I am on a 8.04 LiveCD trying to fix my broken 10.04 system. Since upgrading, the mouse and keyboard do not work. Anything I can do? I ran sudo apt-get dist-upgrade as suggested, but nothing seemed to happen. Help?

2010-05-03T01:10:00.000Z	R0b0t1	ZykoticK9	It boots fine.
2010-05-03T01:10:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	R0b0t1	ok - just confirming
