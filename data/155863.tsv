2010-04-22T06:08:00.000Z	zeroseven0183		Hi! Does anyone know how I can correct this error: "bzr: ERROR: Connection closed: Unexpected end of message. Please check connectivity and permissions, and report a bug if problems persist." ? I'm trying to download the via Bzr the Ubuntu Manual project files.
2010-04-22T06:10:00.000Z	zeroseven0183		Last night I was already downloading the files. However, since I was very sleepy, decided to cancel the process and continue it this morning instead. Then that's the error message I receive
