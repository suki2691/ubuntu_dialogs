What procedure did I follow? I just wrote the following on the command line: sudo chown -R USERNAME:USERNAME /media/mynewdrive

Later I entered another command in order to fix it but I did not work. I would like to know what command could I use so I can figure out the current situation and the work on it to fix it.
