2008-10-26T14:36:00.000Z	darq		hey guys i just downloaded the rc interpid ibex and it wont boot (AMD Barton 2800+, 1GB ram, ATI HD2400) ... it gets me to the gdm and there it stops
2008-10-26T14:37:00.000Z	darq		and then only the caps lock led is blinking .. and nothing starts. does anybody know that bug?
2008-10-26T14:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	darq	 caps lock blinking is a sign of a bad crash...
2008-10-26T14:39:00.000Z	darq	dr_willis	hmm does this mean the new kernel messed something up. 8.04 runs ok
