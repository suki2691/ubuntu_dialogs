2010-07-31T08:40:00.000Z	hylian	bintut	i personally prefer ext 3 because there are some nice windows programs that can write to ext3.
2010-07-31T08:41:00.000Z	bintut	hylian	it should be able to access from the lan
2010-07-31T08:43:00.000Z	hylian	bintut	i know that software works locally, i have never used it over a network. technically it should work, but, i can't guarantee it
