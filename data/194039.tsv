2008-01-03T03:35:00.000Z	seanh		Can anyone explain to me how I get video output to an external monitor, after I have plugged it into my laptop? I'm fiddling with the Screens and Graphics dialog but not getting anything out
2008-01-03T03:36:00.000Z	Jowi	seanh	did you reboot the computer after you plugged it in? is it enabled in BIOS (some laptops need it, some don't)?
