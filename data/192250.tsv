2010-04-22T08:20:00.000Z	Name141	charles__	Would that still let her access the MP3s on my computer/the rest of the network ?
2010-04-22T08:20:00.000Z	Name141	charles__	or would that also disable the whole network ?
2010-04-22T08:21:00.000Z	Name141	charles__	That wont work cause the MP3s are on my computer, plus she might want to do OpenOffice and need printing on the computer in the living room
