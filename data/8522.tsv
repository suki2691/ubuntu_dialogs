2011-10-20T02:33:00.000Z	Demonicpagan		this is what i'm presented with in the terminal when i got to the upgrade of GRUB when upgrading from ubuntu 11.04 to 11.07: http://paste2.org/p/1727937
2011-10-20T02:35:00.000Z	Demonicpagan		i'm more than happy to kill this upgrade by shuttin down the system, formatting my paritions through windows and starting over with installing 11.04
