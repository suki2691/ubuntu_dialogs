2012-02-17T07:23:00.000Z	psusi	Canadian1296	making a bootable windows usb is a windows question... and I don't think windows supports that anyhow
2012-02-17T07:24:00.000Z	Canadian1296	psusi	I know what you're sayingâ€¦ walrus__, go ask if a bootable Windows usb is possible in #windows
2012-02-17T07:28:00.000Z	psusi	Canadian1296	that only works if it is a hybrid iso
