2010-04-24T14:22:00.000Z	cjdevlin		ok, one more question - is there any program available that will allow me to take streaming video (/dev/video0), add a timestamp and some other text, and save it as a file?
2010-04-24T14:22:00.000Z	cjdevlin		i have tried ffmpeg and it does not support that.
2010-04-24T14:22:00.000Z	moetunes	cjdevlin	vlc might do that
2010-04-24T14:25:00.000Z	cjdevlin	moetunes	the features page, under a/v filters has a 'logo overlay' option, but it seems that only can handle a static image. i would like to be able to do a timestamp. and i tried #vlc, but there was no one available at the time i tried to get more answers.
