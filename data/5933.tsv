2012-09-30T04:37:00.000Z	Richard_Cavell		Guys I'm on 12.04 running from USB.  I have a parallel port installed on my computer and I want to know whether Ubuntu recognizes it.  How do I tell?
2012-09-30T04:37:00.000Z	KM0201	Richard_Cavell	something as old as a parallel, i'd say probably, i take it you're trying to get a printer or scanner working?
