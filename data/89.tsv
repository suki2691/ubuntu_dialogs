2004-10-16T06:23:00.000Z	psr	jdub	, LinuxJones : right, thanks.  I realise its not something many people are going to come across, but when you do its painful on the eyes :-)  Are there plans to handle Dual head systems better in the installer?
2004-10-16T06:23:00.000Z	jdub	psr	not for the first release
2004-10-16T06:24:00.000Z	psr	jdub	Fair enough, I can see that its a minority issue.  Ubunutu otherwise seems to rock really very hard.  Keep up the good workl and thanks! :-)
