2009-05-18T14:54:00.000Z	BlackDalek		Are there any good fancy font packages in the repositories? I have the bland mscorefonts ttf package installed and the DejaVu and the font included with the system, all of which look like 1001 versions of the same boring font... so, is there anything more interesting?
2009-05-18T14:56:00.000Z	BlackDalek		Are there any decent font packages out there for Ubuntu? I am a bit sick of using the same courier/times/arial/comics sans clones for everything....
2009-05-18T14:57:00.000Z	BlackDalek		surely there must be some easier way to get more fonts than to google for font sites and download install each font 1 at a time?
