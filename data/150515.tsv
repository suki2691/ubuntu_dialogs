2007-04-12T10:11:00.000Z	jamesbrose		Hmm, I've got an AMD 64 cpu does this mean I have to have the x64 of ubuntu? Or will 32 bit work?
2007-04-12T10:11:00.000Z	Pici	jamesbrose	32bit will work fine
2007-04-12T10:11:00.000Z	jamesbrose	Pici	Its just i'm having a problem with the new kernel (when on 32bit) and was wondering if I switched to 64bit it would solve the problem? (Kernel panics...)
