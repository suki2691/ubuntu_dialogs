2008-03-11T01:32:00.000Z	z_is_the_new_a		Hey People! I would like to try if my notebook (Samsung X20) can boot from a SD-Card. I only have this 256mb SD-Card. Any ideas how to make it bootable? Can I install ubuntu on it?

2008-03-11T01:33:00.000Z	z_is_the_new_a	genii	im fine with any ubuntu
2008-03-11T01:34:00.000Z	z_is_the_new_a	genii	or with anything else that boots.
