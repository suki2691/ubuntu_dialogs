2009-10-06T09:29:00.000Z	Myth`	calebH	Hash differences or strictly file names?
2009-10-06T09:29:00.000Z	calebH	Myth`	yeah, rsync won't help you much.  I'm thinking...
2009-10-06T09:30:00.000Z	Myth`	calebH	I have the LS of each dir saved in a file, I'm just not familiar enough with diff to utilize it or understand it's behavior. If one line is changed are the proceeding lines all flagged as 'incorrect'
2009-10-06T09:31:00.000Z	calebH	Myth`	maybe we should take this convo offline?
