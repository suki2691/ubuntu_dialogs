2009-06-30T15:18:00.000Z	alarm		is it normal for xorg to have always above 12-13% cpu usage ? even when i am not doing any process ?
2009-06-30T15:20:00.000Z	alarm		why do i think that on debian my idle was like lower than 20% on a slower system, while here i am above 20% most of the time
2009-06-30T15:20:00.000Z	sarmisak	alarm	might it be trackerd daemon?
