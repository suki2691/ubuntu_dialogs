2006-04-13T12:34:00.000Z	torkel_		Hello, I installed dapper on this desktop computer, a shitty one :P Lots of ram, 900mhz cpu and geforce2gts... i also installed Gnome/Xgl/Compiz but I am experiencing some problems. Is this computer to slow to handle Xgl or is it something wrong here? :) When I move windows... the wobbling effect hits in, but it's pretty resource demanding, same goes for resizing etc. But not the basic effects

2006-04-13T12:37:00.000Z	torkel_	arrinmurr	 ok, what about the wobbling effect when moving windows? It all move nice and smoothly at first, but when they wobbling effect start to turn out, so does 'fps'
2006-04-13T12:38:00.000Z	arrinmurr	torkel_	hmm.. i don't know about that. but try to ask at #ubuntu-xgl #xgl-ubuntu and http://compiz.ed3n.com/
