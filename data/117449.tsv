2009-11-04T21:07:00.000Z	Ubersoldat		Hi, I have installed the chromium daily PPA, but the updates made doesn't seem to be working (last version 4.0.226.0~svn20091026r30050-0ubuntu1~ucd1~intrepid) do I have to configure something to make it work on a daily basis as it should do?
2009-11-04T21:08:00.000Z	protocol1	Ubersoldat	how do I do that?
