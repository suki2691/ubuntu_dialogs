2012-09-10T18:42:00.000Z	mits	MonkeyDust	just want to know the command to enable the remote desktop
2012-09-10T18:43:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	mits	 what you can do, but maybe there's a more elegant way: start's the user's pc from a live usb stick, download and install the .deb for openssh-server, then you can login using ssh
2012-09-10T18:44:00.000Z	mits	MonkeyDust	i can ssh the machine.. but i need to view the desktop.
