2008-01-08T17:53:00.000Z	PriceChild	db-keen	gutsy's have new versions of most htings, built for gutsy.
2008-01-08T17:53:00.000Z	PriceChild	db-keen	don't use gutsy sources on feisty... upgrade properly or not at all
2008-01-08T17:54:00.000Z	PriceChild	db-keen	because sometimes they need to do seperate because of build deps
