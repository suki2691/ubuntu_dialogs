2009-08-19T06:21:00.000Z	MsMaco	superjoel	to use in a program? well youd want your program to parse the outpt and insert the stuff into an array
2009-08-19T06:22:00.000Z	superjoel	MsMaco	kind of..
2009-08-19T06:23:00.000Z	superjoel	MsMaco	The thing is that there are spaces in the values that screws up my attempts on making an array
