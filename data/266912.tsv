2005-12-30T17:13:00.000Z	jimferd		I have a question: I'm installing something with Wine, and it's multiple CDs. I've made images of the CDs, but how would I mount them so that I can use all four of them? The installer doesn't give me the option to point to where the next files are located, so I have no idea what to do.
