2011-04-25T06:58:00.000Z	chr0n0		i got a simple question here, or so I would imagine...I was the only user on my box til recently, and I went to add a user.  When I log in, all of my drives are mounted, or at least available to be mounted from the places menu.  When the new user logs in, only two of the 4 mounts are available to her.  The drive partition in question is ntfs.  Is this just super easy?  I don't know if I am wording it very well for google.  :)
2011-04-25T06:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chr0n0	 the ntfs-config tool can set up ntfs filesystems where all users can access them fully.  but last i used the tool it was a little flakey. it would work.but crash on exit)
