2010-09-01T23:46:00.000Z	Arthur_D		I am trying to connect a game with a friend through with cables through a network switch. And I'm configuring this manually in Network Manager. Problem is, the network manager wants me to give a DNS, and I don't have any/don't know of any. Could anyone please help me ASAP?
