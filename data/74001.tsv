2009-03-10T15:22:00.000Z	hmw	debian_user	ic. I guess you gotta live with it. Please write all in one single line, do not chat here. (/join #ubuntu-offtopic) Ask your question and see, if someone answeres. Please always prepend the nick name of the person, you are talking to. Use TAB key for autocompletion of nick names.
