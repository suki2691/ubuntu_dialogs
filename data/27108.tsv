2010-09-06T14:03:00.000Z	th0r	pie_time	you get that when the server does not respond....there is nothing to enter...it is a bogus prompt
2010-09-06T14:03:00.000Z	pie_time	th0r	then how do i access this station ive accessed 5 times before with no problem?
2010-09-06T14:04:00.000Z	th0r	pie_time	it is probably either busy or offline. Sometimes you can get in by trying several times, but sometimes the server is just offline
