2008-07-09T08:01:00.000Z	andrewy		any idea why I get no sound in vlc with both alsa and pulseaudio?
2008-07-09T08:02:00.000Z	Mighty_Penguin	andrewy	have you tried running alsamixer in the terminal and turning the volume all the way up?
2008-07-09T08:02:00.000Z	andrewy	Mighty_Penguin	the sound is all the way up
2008-07-09T08:02:00.000Z	Mighty_Penguin	andrewy	have you tried to kill the process pulseaudio? that sometimes helps
