2008-12-12T05:34:00.000Z	pb11		I have a question concerning partitioning
2008-12-12T05:34:00.000Z	atticstorm	pb11	I can try to help. What is the issue?
2008-12-12T05:38:00.000Z	atticstorm	pb11	When I boot into the Ubuntu live CD I then use gparted (system > admin > partition editor) and them move/shrink to make a raw space.  From there I then intall from the CD and tell it to intall into the blank drive space.
