2010-09-17T22:47:00.000Z	dancrew32		trying to monkey with the config file for my 10.04 remote desktop over ssh, but I'm not sure what "Remote Desktop" is actually called. Anyone know?
2010-09-17T22:48:00.000Z	ectospasm	dancrew32	there's VNC, and RDP
2010-09-17T22:48:00.000Z	ectospasm	dancrew32	you can also install NX
2010-09-17T22:48:00.000Z	ectospasm	dancrew32	NX will probably provide the best performance
