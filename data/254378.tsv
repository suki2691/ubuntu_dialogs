2005-03-11T07:59:00.000Z	error_29		Bob2, correction, it's panels that are crashing, and on another forum (about fedora) I find this, which is exactly what's happening to me:
2005-03-11T07:59:00.000Z	error_29		When changing backgrounds, I get a message telling me that the panel has crashed. I then get a message telling me that it discovered a panel already running and will now quit. Then the panel dissapears, and then is reloaded. I think this mainly happens when switching between types of wallpaper, such as between "No Wallpaper", "Tiled", and "Centered".
