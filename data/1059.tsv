2012-11-01T20:53:00.000Z	[TiZ]		Hi. I can't select text in any way at all in pure GTK applications. Click/drag, shift+arrow, even ctrl+a, none of them work. What do I do to fix this? This is on my work box, and it completely cripples my ability to use my computer.

2012-11-01T20:56:00.000Z	[TiZ]	blazemore	Yes, any kind of text field at all. Gedit, Zim, even the input box in XChat here.
