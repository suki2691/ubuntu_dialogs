2010-01-10T02:08:00.000Z	yetifoot		hi, i just rebooted, and at the logo screen, there was a box flashed up, "warning one or more" but i never got a chance to read the rest, where can i find that message?

2010-01-10T02:11:00.000Z	yetifoot	Kieran0413	thanks, but it's not there
2010-01-10T02:11:00.000Z	Kieran0413	yetifoot	try dmesg
