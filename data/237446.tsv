2006-06-29T09:26:00.000Z	mikere	nu2ubuntu	from a command line you could try: ./mybinfine.bin
2006-06-29T09:26:00.000Z	mikere	nu2ubuntu	although you may have to do: chmod +x mybinfile.bin
2006-06-29T09:27:00.000Z	mikere	nu2ubuntu	the second command flags your .bin file as executable if it isn't already
