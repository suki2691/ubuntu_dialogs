2010-05-21T23:34:00.000Z	eee		Hi :-) I upgraded to 10.04 a couple of hours ago, and since then my keyboard and/or my touchpad mouse has simply stopped. I did not have this problem before, it works perfect in GDM, I found nothing in logs, xorg.conf is no longer than 16 lines (is that normal? not a few years ago)
2010-05-21T23:34:00.000Z	eee		I mean, they simply stops randomly
2010-05-21T23:35:00.000Z	eee		they can work for an hour and then suddenly, no idea what triggers it
