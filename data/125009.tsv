2007-11-05T03:18:00.000Z	Asterix_		I recently upgraded to 7.10 and now whenever I alt-tab out from world of warcraft I lose sound and cannot get it back until I restart the game.  Never had an issue before the upgrade and I'm using the latest WINE.  Any suggestions on what might be causing the problem?
