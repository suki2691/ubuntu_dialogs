2011-09-15T21:24:00.000Z	adamrb		having an issue with Ubuntu 11.04 running under VMWare Professional on Windows 7 x64. The VM just randomly turns itself off; I assume Ubuntu is having a kernel panic or something. Where would I look to see what happened? Syslog has no info.
2011-09-15T21:24:00.000Z	h00k	adamrb	even if it has a kernel panic, it shouldn't turn the VM off
2011-09-15T21:25:00.000Z	adamrb	h00k	any thoughts on why the VM would just power off? Other VM's stay running.
