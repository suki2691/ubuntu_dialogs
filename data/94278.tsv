2008-11-01T23:20:00.000Z	Bert_2		Hi, I'm having some issues with my LCDs, on whatever ubuntu version I have I keep on getting wierd stripes on it that go all fuzzy, it's not the videocard because VNC sessions and CRT monitors work fine but both of my LCDs really can't work with it normally, can anyone help me with that ?

2008-11-01T23:22:00.000Z	Bert_2	ieldib	yeah, 60, 70 and 75 all result into chaos
2008-11-01T23:23:00.000Z	Bert_2	ieldib	someone suggested that it's because of the intel+sis graphics, but then why does it work with CRT monitors ?
