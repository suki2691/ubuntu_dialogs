2008-10-02T13:36:00.000Z	susa24		could someone please tell is their a way and how can you dual boot Ubuntum, windows xp and windows 98 all at once?
2008-10-02T13:37:00.000Z	maco	susa24	ubuntu should automatically add both instances of windows to the boot list so you can choose. getting both versions of windows on one computer to begin with could be tricky though.
2008-10-02T13:40:00.000Z	maco	susa24	installing any version of windows after ubuntu is likely to knock out grub.  why would you want to though? it doesn't even get security updates, and if you need a way to run ancient DOS apps, dosemu on linux should help
