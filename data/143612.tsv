Xfce, on the other hand, uses GTK like GNOME, so they should play well together

2007-11-08T03:32:00.000Z	LjL	Oli``	two gigs is plenty, you shouldn't have too much of an issue. you should just expect amarok to take a bit longer to start than a GNOME application. ever given a try to actual KDE, though?
