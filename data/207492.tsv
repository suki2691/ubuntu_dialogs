2007-06-21T14:35:00.000Z	oskude		i got an old HP E-PC 40 and installed feisty (for my mom). but theres a 30sec long show stopper -> http://osku.de/feisty-20070621-1.png. it seems that its caused by the CD-ROM drive. when i remove the CD-ROM drive, the 30sec "delay" is gone. what could i test/investigate ?
