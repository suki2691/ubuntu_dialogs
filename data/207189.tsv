2006-05-03T05:38:00.000Z	polpak	watson540	that depends on where you put it..
2006-05-03T05:39:00.000Z	polpak	watson540	there isn't an easy answer unfortunately
2006-05-03T05:39:00.000Z	polpak	watson540	generally when I compile from source I tell it to install everything to a particular directory in /opt that way I know where everything is
