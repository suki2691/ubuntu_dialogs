But there is a point between login and desktop where the background turns to the default brown before my personalized desktop is applied.  Anyone know where to change that color?

2005-12-31T08:45:00.000Z	Krontabz	cmatheson	would you happen to know which one... and under what key?
2005-12-31T08:45:00.000Z	cmatheson	Krontabz	hmm, i don't know... i don't use gnome anymore
