2008-06-23T00:34:00.000Z	ImMelody		I feel so stupid for having to ask this question..
2008-06-23T00:35:00.000Z	ImMelody		We have a Mythdora machine set up, and it's hosting a network printer, but I am unable to see the Mythdora machine under network, and when I directly smb connect to it, it shows no printer.. My son's Fedora computer sees it as does my husband's Vista machine.. so I figure it must be something with my computer
2008-06-23T00:37:00.000Z	ImMelody		anyone? no one? /cry
2008-06-23T00:37:00.000Z	naxa	ImMelody	sorry i have no idea absolutely
