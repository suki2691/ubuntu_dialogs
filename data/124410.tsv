2010-06-09T15:36:00.000Z	Random832	n2diy	but why do you _want_ to write all zeros to a drive?
2010-06-09T15:36:00.000Z	Random832		it seems like an odd thing to need to do - and i think the term "low-level format" doesn't mean what you think it does
2010-06-09T15:38:00.000Z	n2diy	Random832	just to see if I can do it, before I trash the drive.
