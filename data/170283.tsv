2009-05-08T02:51:00.000Z	Crash1hd		umm gparted livecd says that there is 931.51 gb of unallocated space (what happend to my install?) and if that is the case why doesnt it see the whole 1000GB?
2009-05-08T02:52:00.000Z	Crash1hd		sure I know that 1000gb != 1000 GB but I didnt think it would take 69gb away
2009-05-08T02:53:00.000Z	lupine_85	Crash1hd	it takes 24 bytes in every thosand
2009-05-08T02:55:00.000Z	lupine_85	Crash1hd	sounds like the partition table is gone
