2006-05-14T10:23:00.000Z	hastesaver	stofferdk	sorry, ignore that
2006-05-14T10:26:00.000Z	hastesaver	stofferdk	you can try #cedega, but I've heard there's usually no one on that channel
2006-05-14T10:27:00.000Z	hastesaver	stofferdk	have you read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Cedega ? Maybe it has something useful (or do /msg ubotu cedega )
