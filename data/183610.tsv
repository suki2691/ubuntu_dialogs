2006-06-01T11:07:00.000Z	mjmac	visik7	one's a CD, and the other's a DVD.  the DVD has more packages on it.
2006-06-01T11:08:00.000Z	visik7	mjmac	which packages ?
2006-06-01T11:09:00.000Z	mjmac	visik7	i dunno.  "a bunch"?  i can't see any reason to get a DVD ISO unless the machine(s) you're installing to are on a really bad (or nonexistent) net connection
