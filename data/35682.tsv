2010-03-17T14:59:00.000Z	theadmin	Life_Support	I think... "boot IMAGE" does it in GRUB prompt
2010-03-23T13:46:00.000Z	theadmin	Life_Support	Wait, if it doesn't boot even from CD it means it's some problem with hard drive or other hardware. Or a bad cd, but... can you boot _anything_ at all?
2010-03-23T13:47:00.000Z	Life_Support	theadmin	until 2 days ago I was abel to run 2.6.31-19-generic with edit line now it freezes too
