2008-04-16T17:23:00.000Z	dmsuperman		i just put a blank dvd in my drive and am trying to use the built in ubuntu burn:/// window to burn one, however when I click write to disc it just says please insert a blank dvd. the drive works, I just burnt a dvd in windows yesterday, and I've tried 3 different DVDs (including different brands).
2008-04-16T17:24:00.000Z	dmsuperman		It popped up "you have just inserted a blank dvd, what would you like to do?" so it does recognize that it's a blank dvd at least somewhere
2008-04-16T17:24:00.000Z	DJones	dmsuperman	have you tried using gnomebaker or k3b to burn with?
2008-04-16T17:25:00.000Z	dmsuperman	DJones	nope, just realized it was selecting my other dvd drive to try and burn with haha. thanks :D
