2009-04-03T07:05:00.000Z	FrozenFire		Is it possible to, using SSH, launch a session on a remote system, and then use Gnome? X11 forwarding seems to work quite well on a single application basis, but I want to launch my entire workspace.

2009-04-03T07:08:00.000Z	FrozenFire		Next question. Is there a simple interface for setting up and managing a router from within Ubuntu. That is, Ubuntu running a DHCP server, firewall, etc.
