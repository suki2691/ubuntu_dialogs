2007-05-29T06:08:00.000Z	Pelo	xMore	 what is the actual queston ?
2007-05-29T06:10:00.000Z	Pelo	xMore	 you can't on setup , activate your onboard intel card,   install ubuntu then reactivate the nvidia one and install the nvidia drivers
2007-05-29T06:11:00.000Z	Pelo	xMore	 he last resort is using the alternate install cd, which is text based and cares not about the video driver
