2008-06-17T19:56:00.000Z	Aaron_Feldspar		lol, sorry then: is there a way to use the ubuntu command line without installing the rest of the os(especially the kernel ;( )?
2008-06-17T19:57:00.000Z	sipior	Aaron_Feldspar	no. without the kernel, the machine does nothing...
2008-06-17T19:58:00.000Z	sipior	Aaron_Feldspar	i suppose you could install cygwin on windows or so...
