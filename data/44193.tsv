2009-11-03T13:39:00.000Z	koshari1	meowpup	thats effectively what a live session does
2009-11-03T13:40:00.000Z	meowpup	koshari1	to a degree. but you still need cd in drive. puppy runs compleatly in ram and ejects cd
2009-11-03T13:40:00.000Z	koshari1	meowpup	use a USB device, where does the ram load from with puppy?
