2011-06-12T06:56:00.000Z	aashift	rationalOgre	i'm aware of that. however, still wondering how to fix it, if possible.
2011-06-12T07:03:00.000Z	aashift	rationalOgre	the gnome3 shell may be broke, but the problem i'm having is with apt. it won't let me install packages until the gnome3 issue is fixed. is there a workaround or something for apt? i don't even care right now if it's an ugly fix. i just need apt to work properly for the time being.
2011-06-12T07:07:00.000Z	rationalOgre	aashift	Sorry, I have no idea. There may be a workaround, I don't know it.
