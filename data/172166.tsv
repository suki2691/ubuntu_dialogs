2006-08-12T12:24:00.000Z	bigbill52a		I had some problems with wireless, but I am wondering if the problem came from having two active connections with the same channel, provider, etc...i changed the channel for one of these connections and will try kubuntu again at that computer

2006-08-12T12:26:00.000Z	bigbill52a		you should just be able to plug it in and it will find it
2006-08-12T12:26:00.000Z	|thunder	bigbill52a	2 wireless cards or ethernet cards should both be able to connect to an AP simultaniously as they both have different MAC addresses.
