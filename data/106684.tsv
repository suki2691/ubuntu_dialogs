2009-08-01T16:29:00.000Z	ranga		I have a problem with network speed throttling down unexpectedly.  The machine connects through a wireless N router as wired gigE.  The router is performing fine since another machine in Windows that connects wirelessly to the same router doesn't see this speed drop when it is occuring on this machine in question.  I am running Ubuntu 9.10.  When I restart my network using /etc/init.d/networking restart, there is no change.

The only way I can get the speed back to the original 6 mbps range is by rebooting the machine.  Even then not all reboots restore the network speed.  The speed drops to as low as 200 kbps.  I am using a bandwidth testing site to measure.  I don't see any errors that I can spot in "dmesg".  I have been using linux a while and
