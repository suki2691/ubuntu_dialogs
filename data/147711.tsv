2007-05-27T06:35:00.000Z	soundless		Hi could someone forward me to a channel where people MIGHT help me learning to program
2007-05-27T06:36:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	soundless	what kind of programming do you want to do.
2007-05-27T06:37:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	soundless	i'd sugguest Perl or Java. I use a lot of perl for network adminstration tasks.
2007-05-27T06:38:00.000Z	r00tintheb0x	soundless	perl is fairly straight forward.
