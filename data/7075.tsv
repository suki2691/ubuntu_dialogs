2012-02-02T07:13:00.000Z	_John		How do I write random text to a file? I thought it was "cat /dev/random > file" but it's not working
2012-02-02T07:14:00.000Z	Ben64	_John	/dev/random is slow, you can use /dev/urandom
2012-02-02T07:14:00.000Z	Ben64	_John	but /dev/urandom isn't really random
2012-02-02T07:14:00.000Z	_John	Ben64	Meh, anything that writes crap to it
