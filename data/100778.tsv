2008-02-18T06:05:00.000Z	Jouva		Ok, I'd like an HONEST answer: If I WERE to buy an nVidia card to replace my ATi card but I'm on a budget, what one should I get? I'm not looking to get OMG BEST 3D GRAPHICS EVER. I want something that won't be generally slow with stuff like just watching a youtube video. I MAY want to run Second Life as well, but it doesn't have to be super fast with that.
2008-02-18T06:06:00.000Z	Jouva		I'm not looking for a gamer card. I'm looking for a card that works that I can afford, so WELL under $100
2008-02-18T06:06:00.000Z	Jouva		But I know nothing about the nVidia line.
