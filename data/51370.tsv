2010-02-10T03:26:00.000Z	Inquiry		What is the latest stable Ubuntu release?  And can I upgrade to it from my 8.04?
2010-02-10T03:27:00.000Z	trism	Inquiry	9.10, an no, you need to go 8.04->8.10->9.04->9.10, you are better off clean installing (or you can wait and go 8.04->10.04)
2010-02-10T03:28:00.000Z	Inquiry	antdawg	 That's the problem, right there.  Update manager doesn't show any reference at all to new distro releases being available.  I don't know that it ever did.  I did an update using it just today, but I still have 8.04 afterwards.
