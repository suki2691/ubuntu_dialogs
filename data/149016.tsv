2007-01-23T06:52:00.000Z	m12		is it possible to turn off "suggestions"  in the Firefox search field?
2007-01-23T06:52:00.000Z	unop	m12	 err do you mean "previously typed entries"?
2007-01-23T06:53:00.000Z	m12	unop	 No, I mean suggestions
2007-01-23T06:54:00.000Z	unop	m12	not that i know off -- you might like to try asking in #firefox (both here and on irc.mozilla.org)
