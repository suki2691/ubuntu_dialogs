2008-02-23T06:11:00.000Z	WhoaItsPhil		anyone have a clue about an issue with a laptop? i've got ubuntu 7.10 on it and when i start it, it says something about "cannot allocate resources to region 7....blablabla" i can't catch the rest it just flashes up and then goes black for about 30 seconds before it starts...takes a lot longer to bootup than it should...it's an HP laptop
2008-02-23T06:12:00.000Z	WhoaItsPhil		yeah it goes black and hangs for at least 30 seconds before booting...quite annoying
2008-02-23T06:12:00.000Z	WhoaItsPhil		cause it boots on my desktop lots faster even though my laptop is newer with decently better hardware
