2005-09-22T08:05:00.000Z	pizzaiolo		so everybody install software and launch it using the command line or is there a way to make appear items from /usr/lib/menu in the gnome menu ?.. lol

2005-09-22T08:10:00.000Z	pizzaiolo	sproingie	maybe i can add items manually with smeg but since there's a lot of menu items in /usr/lib/menu anybody would LOVE use something like update-menus instead...
