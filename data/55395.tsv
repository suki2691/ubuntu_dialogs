2011-03-07T06:17:00.000Z	luxgeek		How in the world am I supposed to get one large desktop on my dual monitors? everything "ubuntu" related on the net talks about an xorg.conf which doesn't exist...? GAH!
2011-03-07T06:17:00.000Z	luxgeek		HELP!
2011-03-07T06:17:00.000Z	edbian	luxgeek	just create it.  (please don't yell)
2011-03-07T06:17:00.000Z	edbian	luxgeek	the file does not exist by default.  If you create it the system will read it.
