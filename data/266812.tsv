2009-12-06T17:57:00.000Z	Feyd		Hi, I have 1 paration (1 hd) with windows 7 on it, is it possible to install ubutu in dual mode without reinstalling my windows again?
2009-12-06T17:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Feyd	 i would suggest using windows to resize yur windwos install. and leave a section of the HD unallocated. then boot the ubuntu cd and start the ubuntu installer
2009-12-06T17:59:00.000Z	Feyd	ubuntu	installtion knows how to do that with out destryoing any data?
2009-12-06T18:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Feyd	 it CAN - but the windows resize tool is faster i find. by like 5x
