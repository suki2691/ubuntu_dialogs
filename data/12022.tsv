2011-07-14T06:10:00.000Z	sladfra		I am in the middle of upgrading from Ubuntu 9.10 to 10.04 LTS.  It presented me with a prompt "Replace the customized configuration file /etc/sysctl.conf?" but my USB mouse and keyboard aren't responding!  I've tried another USB mouse and keyboard (on various USB ports), and even dug up an old PS/2 mouse.  Is there a way to reset the mouse without resetting the computer?  I tried modprobe -r usb_storage but that module is in use.  Sug

2011-07-14T06:14:00.000Z	sladfra	ActionParsnip	I tried unplugging but that didn't work.  I honestly don't care about my changes to the configuration file, I just want the upgrade to continue without restarting the computer in the middle (which I assume might brick it).
