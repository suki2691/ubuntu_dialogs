2011-01-29T19:29:00.000Z	davejb		using the 10.10 install how should i partition my 80GB SSD drive (assuming i want no swap and only keep around 3 or 4 kernal images)?
2011-01-29T19:31:00.000Z	lgn12	davejb	You want a separate /home if you n√©e to reinstall
2011-01-29T19:37:00.000Z	lgn12	davejb	/ probably 10-15gb
2011-01-29T19:39:00.000Z	lgn12	davejb	I would have / at 10-15gb, /home for rest
