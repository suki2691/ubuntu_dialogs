2011-03-18T03:24:00.000Z	Urocyon		I have a vexing problem.  I uninstalled some packages, but now when I reinstall them they don't get completely installed.  They are missing configuration files and such.   Tried purging deleting, etc, but when I go to reinstall - it doesn't work.
2011-03-18T03:24:00.000Z	Urocyon		any ideas on what I may have done and how to correct?
