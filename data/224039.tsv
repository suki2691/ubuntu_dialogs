2005-08-22T07:34:00.000Z	aru		my power went out and now when I boot two of my drives don't show up, I'm pretty sure they are mounted, but I have no idea what to do now
2005-08-22T07:36:00.000Z	aru		when I open the Home Folder the drives have an X on the icon, if I try to cd to the directories they are empty
2005-08-22T07:36:00.000Z	samigaru	aru	ya have no permission to do that?
2005-08-22T07:37:00.000Z	aru	samigaru	do the permissions change when the power goes out?
