2010-08-07T06:21:00.000Z	glib		i am trying to watch a big mkv video file (8gb) using vlc but it is really glitchy and freezes and pixalates sometimes.  how would i fix this?
2010-08-07T06:22:00.000Z	tensorpudding	glib	what video drivers?
2010-08-07T06:22:00.000Z	glib	tensorpudding	i think vlc has it's own drivers
2010-08-07T06:22:00.000Z	glib	tensorpudding	if i try to use totem with gstreamer is it even worse
