2008-11-01T20:09:00.000Z	cbau		I'm running on a Macbook Pro, was dual booting OS X and Ubuntu. Installed Ubuntu over top of the Boot Camp partition. The problem is, it will not let me boot off of a live or install CD. When I attempt, it goes straight to GRUB, and refuses to load any CD/DVDs. Any thoughts on why it won't let me boot from a CD?
