2009-09-02T06:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	SuperMIguel	I  am not sure, but it should add itself to the menu, and if not,  re install the package  or log out and back in to your Ubuntu account, and it should be there
2009-09-02T06:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	SuperMIguel	under system tools I think,  I don't have it installed right now
2009-09-02T06:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	SuperMIguel	 as in don't have 3.0.4 installed right now on this computer, or whatever the latest version is
