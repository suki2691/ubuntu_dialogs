2010-11-22T17:24:00.000Z	g__	Dr_Willis	well it's not for permanent autostart, just something like say, starting "project 1 session" will open all the folders i had open in that session etc.
2010-11-22T17:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	g__	 ive seen similer features. but i never use them
2010-11-22T17:33:00.000Z	g__	Dr_Willis	i guess i could set up the different directories on the different screens, and just switch between them. when i shutdown, the state of  all screens would be stored right?
