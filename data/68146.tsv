2009-01-26T08:00:00.000Z	Dr_willis	olethri0s	 you are proberly safer just not using it.. then 'removing' it.
2009-01-26T08:01:00.000Z	olethri0s	Dr_willis	Because I want to use fluxbox now for practicality.
2009-01-26T08:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	olethri0s	 if you set to use fluxbox.. then you wont be using compiz at all.
