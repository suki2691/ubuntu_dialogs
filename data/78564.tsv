2009-06-19T23:25:00.000Z	maddin		I installed a raid 5 array with mdadm, want to use the same array with windows, too, possible?
2009-06-19T23:26:00.000Z	Cybertinus	maddin	sorry, that is not possible
2009-06-19T23:27:00.000Z	Cybertinus	maddin	mdadm has his own way of writing on the disk how the RAID5 set is defined. Windows doesn't understand that notation
2009-06-19T23:27:00.000Z	Cybertinus	maddin	heh, yes, you could stop indeed :)
