2010-06-24T20:51:00.000Z	shomon		I have recently upgraded to lucid lynx from hoary so this problem comes from 8.06. It has always asked me for a login keyring
2010-06-24T20:51:00.000Z	shomon		how do I get rid of this useless prompt?
2010-06-24T20:53:00.000Z	shomon		can I just remove my login keyring?
