2009-02-09T15:20:00.000Z	ddoom		how do I get a script to run on boot?
2009-02-09T15:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ddoom	There are multiple ways.  What sort of script is it / what does it do?
2009-02-09T15:23:00.000Z	ddoom	tonyyarusso	starts a ushare daemon, for some reason the actual ushare service doesn't work properly
2009-02-09T15:24:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ddoom	then I think what fosco_ is probably appropriate.
