2006-08-24T09:05:00.000Z	Don_jr		Is ther a way to recapture an install from where it left off? or do I have to start it over?  And if I start it over would it be okay to just run it over top ot things, or should I reformat the HD and try again?

2006-08-24T09:07:00.000Z	Don_jr	seraphim	when I did that last time I got "could not create file system" and it hung
2006-08-24T09:07:00.000Z	seraphim	Don_jr	you got the newest release of the installer cd?
