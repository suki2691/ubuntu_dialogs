2006-05-15T13:33:00.000Z	salmiak		but installing something ON a samba share?
2006-05-15T13:33:00.000Z	salmiak		well, i guess it's possible to install it on the samba share if you got write permissions
2006-05-15T13:34:00.000Z	mutante	salmiak	like when he is at the windows client installing a setup.exe and he picks the network drive which is mapped via samba on the linux server ,and tells the windows app to install in that path
