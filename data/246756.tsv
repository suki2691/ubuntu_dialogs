2006-08-07T10:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	lzap	 at this time theres still a few little issues with usinga  a 64bit distro
2006-08-07T10:50:00.000Z	lzap	dr_willis	so you suggest to stay at 32 bits and wait for next release?
2006-08-07T10:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	lzap	 depends on your needs.  64bit support is geting better.. but theres still a lot of little issues.. depends on what progams you use on a daily basis
