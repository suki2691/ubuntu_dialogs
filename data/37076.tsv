2010-11-13T05:05:00.000Z	Gary_B		im concerned that malware has got on my windows xp system, would installing the Ubunto on windows (Wubi) from the ubuntu site be sufficient to ensure my security (while using ubuntu obviously)?
2010-11-13T05:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gary_B	malware is mainly made for windows so wont affect ubuntu (it's not spelled ubuntuo)
2010-11-13T05:07:00.000Z	Gary_B	ActionParsnip	will parts of the windows OS be running when im in Ubuntu?
2010-11-13T05:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gary_B	none
