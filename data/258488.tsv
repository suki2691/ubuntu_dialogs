Trying to copy some files from internal HDD (ext3) to the usb drive, i have problem copying files with "special caracters" eg. 00. NYC_ Tag 7 | h23 - h24 | Video.m4v.   Is there any tool to "batch rename files within a folder", so to search files for unwanted caracters and deletem from the name of the file. ????
