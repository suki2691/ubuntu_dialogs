2012-03-25T09:08:00.000Z	Lax		hello I recently installed 11.10 as a virtualbox guest vm.   I have a dual core AMD 7850 but for some reason Ubuntu wont recognize both cores.  ACPI is enabled in my bios.  Anyone have any thoughts?
2012-03-25T09:09:00.000Z	wylde	Lax	look in the settings, there's an option for how many cores to use.
