2008-03-09T12:57:00.000Z	niklas		/home/niklas/.opera/lock because I need to delete this file
2008-03-09T12:57:00.000Z	niklas		But I can't find by going to My Computer and further on?
2008-03-09T12:58:00.000Z	cpk1	niklas	thats because the .opera folder is hidden, folders prefixed with a . are hidden
