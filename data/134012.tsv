2011-12-12T22:47:00.000Z	Matt_Slack_Debia		I have a question about Ubuntu and Grub, I installed 11.10 twice, didn't work on 2nd boot, twice, hated dasher, installed 11.04, like the Gnome, afraid to 2nd boot because I cannot find anything to manually configure Grub in the Gnome System Tools.   Liloconfig was so much easier.
