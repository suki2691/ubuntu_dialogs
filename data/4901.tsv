2012-09-21T13:48:00.000Z	minixvbox	Tyler91	pastebin is for multple lines of text, you describe your problem here
2012-09-21T13:48:00.000Z	minixvbox	Tyler91	eg: pastebin your syslog
2012-09-21T13:49:00.000Z	minixvbox	Tyler91	thats exactly what pastebin is for, or are you saying you can't get it to a pastebin?
