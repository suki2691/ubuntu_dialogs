2008-11-27T15:31:00.000Z	robf_	hmw_pidgin	well I'm still wondering wtf happened
2008-11-27T15:32:00.000Z	robf_	hmw_pidgin	do you thnk it may be that I had ntfs partition mounted,   then updated,  and perhaps something normally called by ntfs_3g or fuse was changed to a conflicting version that was not preloaded in memory by it's callers?
2008-11-27T15:33:00.000Z	robf_	hmw_pidgin	 yeah except a lock doesn't account for the enpoint error
2008-11-27T15:34:00.000Z	hmw_pidgin	robf_	some stuff restarted with another context?
