2010-11-26T15:06:00.000Z	hinog1		I have a problem in Ubuntu 10.10 x64, I have no sound in flash not in firefox nor in chromium and the sound pref doesn't show any application when I play a flash video
2010-11-26T15:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hinog1	 but sound works normally otjerwise?
2010-11-26T15:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hinog1	 that issue pops up every so often, Its not near as common as it used to be.
2010-11-26T15:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hinog1	 ive never had an issue.. I recall a whole page once of 'possible fix's' - but never needed them
