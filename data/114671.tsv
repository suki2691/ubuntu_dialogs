2008-11-20T09:22:00.000Z	hektic		Can I install games form one version of ubuntu (a cd) to a newer version on my pc without using a package mananger? (everytime i try it downloads the packages and that would take forever)
2008-11-20T09:23:00.000Z	binarymutant	hektic	yes with the sudo dpkg -i command
2008-11-20T09:24:00.000Z	binarymutant	hektic	you'll have to download the .deb first though from like packages.ubuntu.com or something
2008-11-20T09:25:00.000Z	binarymutant	hektic	its under settings->repositories in synaptic
