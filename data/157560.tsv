2006-12-21T09:57:00.000Z	sunnz2		By default installation, does "hibernate" actually turns off the system or just suspend to RAM?
2006-12-21T09:58:00.000Z	sod75	sunnz2	hibernate is suspend to disk, so turn off
2006-12-21T09:59:00.000Z	sunnz2	sod75	cool... the same applies to xubuntu right? (And I don't mean the command "hibernate", but the hiberante 'button'.)
