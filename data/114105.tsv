2007-12-23T00:33:00.000Z	magne_		I just ran the command sudo chown user /*/*    I tried to fix it by making everything owned by root and changing /home back. But I guess that's not all good either. Anyone know a way I can set everything back to default (hopefully not by reinstalling)

2007-12-23T00:37:00.000Z	magne_	tony_math	root is the owner. anyone else can only access files
2007-12-23T00:39:00.000Z	tony_math	magne_	on my system, /etc/sudoers is owned by root. Only root has read access as well as members of the root group.
