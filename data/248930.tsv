I plugged a new piece of hardware in to a usb slot which I've never used on this OS before-- it's a playstation controller run through a RadioShack USB converter.  This usually requires installing drivers from a floppy, with no other way to acquire them, in order to work in windows.  I just plugged it in and started zsnes, and it was instantly able to take in
