2005-07-15T13:16:00.000Z	Hikaru79		I'm getting mixed reports. Some people tell me to use the backports repository to get the Sun Java JDK, and others tell me the warty-backports repos are the devil and I should rather sacrifice my firstborn than add it to sources.list ... anyone here can throw an objective light on the issue?
