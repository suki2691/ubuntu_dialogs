2011-05-16T18:58:00.000Z	GJohanns		Hello, I have a projector hooked to a Ubuntu box that I would like to do a "remote desktop in reverse" on. (The guest would connect to the Ubuntu box, and the Ubuntu box would display the clients desktop.) Anyone know of software to do this?
2011-05-16T18:59:00.000Z	Walex	GJohanns	yes.
2011-05-16T19:01:00.000Z	Walex	GJohanns	so you expect to find something that allows you to display locally another PC's desktop without doing *anything*? Wouldn't that be a big problem?
2011-05-16T19:03:00.000Z	GJohanns	Walex	No, I would like for the server (the ubuntu box) to accept connections from the client, and then once a session is started, the server would display the clients desktop.
