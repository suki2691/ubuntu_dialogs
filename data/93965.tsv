2008-08-21T21:04:00.000Z	zetheroo		I am thinking of getting a HP Pavilion laptop ... but I am wondering if the built-in webcam will be working with Ubuntu Hardy!?!? Has anyone here had any experience with this?

2008-08-21T21:09:00.000Z	Scorp_	zetheroo	Not among pavillions... and anyways, they all work..!!
2008-08-21T21:14:00.000Z	Scorp_	zetheroo	just make a backup DVD of the original OS... so that in case of any manufacturing defect, u can keep ur warranty intact... then install ubuntu and rejoice !!
