2008-10-08T07:49:00.000Z	oscillocam	lainy	I just have to chime in 'cause it's so weird... does you new password work from the console? are you sure it got changed?
2008-10-08T07:50:00.000Z	lainy	oscillocam	i changed it twice with sudo passwd, but i can still only log in with the old password
2008-10-08T07:58:00.000Z	lainy	oscillocam	problem solved. my mistake. by using sudo passwd, i was changing the root's passwd, not the user with which i was connecting to
2008-10-08T07:59:00.000Z	lainy	oscillocam	thanks for your help
