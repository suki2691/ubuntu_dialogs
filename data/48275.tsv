2011-10-25T00:33:00.000Z	robinson		When Firefox needs to save something and is asking for the save location, the window it spawns is as big as my monitor. How can I change the size of this windows and get it to stick? Ubuntu 11.10 with all updates

2011-10-25T00:35:00.000Z	robinson	OerHeks	I didnt mean it literally. Its not fullscreen but is VERY large to where the save button is off screen. I have to drag and resize the window every time
