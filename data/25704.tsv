2011-04-19T03:23:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob		why is my transmission torrent manager running so slowly? my max download speed seems to be under 10KiB/s for every torrent, and the same torrents download around 300KiB/s on my other windows computer with bittorrent on the same network. Also, while using transmission, i cant access the internet via any browsers
