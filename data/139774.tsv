2008-07-14T07:55:00.000Z	Fut_		For some reason my icons are not coming up anymore. I have items that state: "<program>.desktop" Anyone know why?
2008-07-14T07:56:00.000Z	Fut_		When I try to modify the icons to have the image show, the *.png images are not showing.
2008-07-14T07:57:00.000Z	Shujah	Fut_	none of the icons are showing
2008-07-14T07:58:00.000Z	Shujah	Fut_	go to menu > system > preferences > appearence > click customize theme and change the icon pack see if it works
