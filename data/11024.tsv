2011-08-07T02:45:00.000Z	doit_		what is a good mouse management tool for ubuntu? I am using Linux Mint 10 lxde and may need to install an application to change the mouse double click speed.
2011-08-07T02:47:00.000Z	astraljava	doit_	In vanilla ubuntu, there's an app for that in System | Preferences. Since you're using Mint, we cannot help you here.
2011-08-07T02:49:00.000Z	doit_	astraljava	you are aware that mint is built on ubuntu and if the app works in ubuntu and is in the mint repos I can install it and be off and running.
2011-08-07T02:50:00.000Z	astraljava	doit_	Yes, I am aware, and the official policy of the channel is not to provide support for Mint, as they do some tweaks that ubuntu does not.
