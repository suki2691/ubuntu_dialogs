2008-06-27T04:27:00.000Z	spoonman	giacomo_carissim	are you trying to get drivers newer than those in the Ubuntu repository?
2008-06-27T04:29:00.000Z	spoonman	giacomo_carissim	the most reliable way to install drivers not in the official repository is probably EnvyNG: http://albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html
