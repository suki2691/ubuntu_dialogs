2011-08-15T10:08:00.000Z	feng_		 I use vim + ctags in ubuntu Linux to browse source code, when there are more than one implement , say ioremap,  the vim just give the first implement , not giving a list of implement like in fedora. Why?
2011-08-15T10:08:00.000Z	feng_		can anybody answer my question?
