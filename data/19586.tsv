2011-06-17T04:43:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne		(like the games, the media players, all of that)
2011-06-17T04:44:00.000Z	Starminn	TheLifelessOne	GNOME comes with software, just like KDE. The "GNOME desktop" package comes with that default software. No way to get around it IIRC. Same with KDE. It comes with crap.
2011-06-17T04:45:00.000Z	TheLifelessOne	Starminn	seriously? I just want GNOME. :(
