2009-03-26T02:44:00.000Z	Bodsda__		Hi, I want to upgrade from hardy to intrepid, I already hapen to have an intrepid iso so can i upgrade using that rather then downloading all the packages through update-manager -d?

2009-03-26T02:47:00.000Z	Bodsda__	B419kid	i dont think thtas true, im still using hardy repo's and normal apt-get update/upgrade will not change your 'sitribution'
2009-03-26T02:47:00.000Z	B419kid	Bodsda__	sorry
