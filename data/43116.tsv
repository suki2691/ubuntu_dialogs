2009-11-10T18:22:00.000Z	gcola		I've recently installed 9.10 w/Gnome.  Previously I was running 8.04 and KDE.  I liked the default window picker for KDE better.

2009-11-10T18:24:00.000Z	gcola	Gadget3000	Thanks, but not sure I want to switch to KDE just for the window picker, but I'll think, about it.
