2009-06-08T22:04:00.000Z	tiyowan	Norpan	Okay, do this then. Boot into Windows, try connecting to the Internet, note down the -exact- error msg, and tell me what it says.
2009-06-08T22:05:00.000Z	Norpan	tiyowan	 well its basicly the same as in ubuntu, the behaivor is exactly the same
2009-06-08T22:05:00.000Z	tiyowan	Norpan	That's fine, but I need some sort of error msgs in order to diagnose the problem.
