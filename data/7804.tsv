Both times I got the same error after a "successful" install. The error occurs when I try to boot to the usb device. it says that there is on pae kernel included.... I think the pae kernel is in the iso by default

2012-11-10T01:13:00.000Z	MaynardWaters	genii-around	so im not going insane, the pae kernel should be included in the default iso, right?
