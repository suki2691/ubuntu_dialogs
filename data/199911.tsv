2009-08-23T21:50:00.000Z	grim76	stefg	It was installed at one point, but I think it was removed.  Let me verify that it is indeed removed.
2009-08-23T21:52:00.000Z	grim76	stefg	Ok network manager has been re-installed.  Verified through dpkg -l | grep network
2009-08-23T21:53:00.000Z	grim76	stefg	I will verify if it was installed through a patch/update, or re-installed for a specific reason.
