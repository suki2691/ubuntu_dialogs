2006-06-07T14:17:00.000Z	kholerabbi	kakalto	I had a look at ubuntuguide, but couldn't find what I wanted anyway.... I am running a program under wine, this program needs files from a cdrom, I have an iso image of the cd. I want to extract the iso content and make wine emulate the isocontent as a cdrom for the winprogram.. anybody help with that?
