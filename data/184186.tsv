2006-06-16T08:10:00.000Z	jorvis_		what command can I do to see all the /dev/hda* on my system when I'm booted from the LiveDVD ?
2006-06-16T08:11:00.000Z	Krhis	jorvis_	did you try "mount"?
2006-06-16T08:12:00.000Z	jorvis_	Krhis	I'm booted off the LiveDVD, so all that shows me is the tempfs that are mounted
2006-06-16T08:14:00.000Z	jorvis_	Krhis	it was "sudo fdisk -l"
