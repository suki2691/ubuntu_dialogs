2012-02-04T18:19:00.000Z	kwtm2		Is there a deadline beyond which version upgrades to common software packages are no longer backported to LTS versions?  I'm trying to figure out how to get Vim 7.3 to the current LTS Ubuntu (current is Vim 7.2)

2012-02-04T18:22:00.000Z	kwtm2	LjL	Thx for info.  Backports is something that is not installed by default, and that I would have to enable myself?  Could you point me to where I could find backports?  I'm sure someone has requested vim 7.3
