2011-07-29T16:33:00.000Z	ebanias		 can anyone tell me how to launch orca(text reader) in ubuntu?
2011-07-29T16:33:00.000Z	ThinkT510	ebanias	tried typing it from the terminal?
2011-07-29T16:38:00.000Z	ThinkT510	ebanias	sorry, i've never needed that funcunality and haven't used orca myself so i wouldn't know what to recomend to you
