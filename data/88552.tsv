2009-01-15T22:09:00.000Z	felix		Hi. If I have basic working environment of some older ubuntu installed without graphics interface, is it possible to install new linux from hard disk (downloaded) without using CD?

2009-01-15T22:11:00.000Z	felix	ASULutzy	that's installing from net directly, right?
2009-01-15T22:12:00.000Z	ASULutzy	felix	You can use unetbootin to install from an iso, so you can just wget the iso first, or I think it also can install directly from network
