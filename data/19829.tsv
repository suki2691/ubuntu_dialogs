2011-01-27T09:27:00.000Z	JoseeAntonioR	bonjoyee	If you refer to MSN, Yahoo, GMail, etc., yes. In MSN.
2011-01-27T09:27:00.000Z	bonjoyee	JoseeAntonioR	i mean..do you have this issue with only a specific protocol? like MSN, Google Talk etc?
2011-01-27T09:29:00.000Z	JoseeAntonioR	bonjoyee	I only use MSN. I don't have a way to check if this is ocurring with another protocol, as I only have a MSN Messenger account.
