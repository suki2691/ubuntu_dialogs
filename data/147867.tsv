2008-10-16T22:26:00.000Z	andre_		I'm looking for a mail software that can receive the mails from my several freemail accountsvia pop3, send mails via my isp's smtp server and provide a web interface on my local server to access these mails.
2008-10-16T22:27:00.000Z	smultron	andre_	most can do thos, minus the webmail part.
2008-10-16T22:29:00.000Z	andre_	smultron	What are 'most'? I need something to download the mails and i need a imap server. Then i could use any webmail client.
