2010-11-15T02:31:00.000Z	hydrozen		I have samba running on a ubuntu server and its running and working but I can't see it when I browse the network (Finder, Windows Explorer, Network in Ubuntu). Any ideas why a server would not broadcast its presence all of a sudden? (it worked before... and it works at my place with a similar setup..)

2010-11-15T02:32:00.000Z	hydrozen	RiverRat	I'm pretty sure yeah. It's all 192.168.2.255
2010-11-15T02:33:00.000Z	hydrozen	RiverRat	and i see the server in the output if I do findsmb
