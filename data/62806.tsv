2009-10-22T18:09:00.000Z	issyl0		Just I have a friend who I'm going to visit in a couple of weeks and I only have Ubuntu on my laptop and I don't know if dial up will work or not with it.

2009-10-22T18:10:00.000Z	issyl0	Bob_Dole2	oh right.  I tried last time when I went and it didn't work, it didn't even detect it and it was all plugged in okay, but I thought it was just my laptop as I was running Ubuntu through Wubi at that time
