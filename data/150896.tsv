2007-01-14T15:56:00.000Z	Schminux		I running Dapper Drake (6.0.6) and need to include the command "sudo iwpriv ath0 authmode 2" on every reboot since it enables WEP on my wireless card.  How do I add the instruction?  Config file? Can I use a text editor?  I am new to Linux and would appreciate some help.
