2010-08-05T22:39:00.000Z	thune3	jgcampbell300	i would examine your motives, what you are trying to accomplish, and ask if upgrading to 64-bit ubuntu would serve any reasonable purpose. (if you are just doing it for kicks, then fine)
2010-08-05T22:42:00.000Z	thune3	jgcampbell300	so you have more memory on your system than 32-bit ubuntu can utilize?
2010-08-05T22:44:00.000Z	thune3	jgcampbell300	i'm not sure what the complaints against the pae kernel are, but pae kernel should be an easy transistion. I recommend trying that first.
