2008-07-20T06:35:00.000Z	ShinjinAkag1		I am having some connectivity issues with a game server. The problem is they don't support linux so I was wondering if someone here could help me.

2008-07-20T06:38:00.000Z	ShinjinAkag1	Jack_Sparrow	It's a game called Furcadia. It is running and everything and I've never had any trouble before but now it's really laggy for some reason. The site suggests doing a traceroute but when I do all I get is 1 *** 2*** 3*** etc
