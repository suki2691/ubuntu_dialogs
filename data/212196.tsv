2008-04-18T06:52:00.000Z	jack|Argon		I'm having a weird xorg configuration issue. I'm not using ubuntu (on this box at least), but I figured maybe someone in here could help. When I configure my apple wireless mighty mouse in xorg.conf using evdev (and only when using evdev), holding down any of the mouse buttons registers a series of extremely rapid clicks until I let it up. I have no idea why this is, and can't find any info on the internet about it.
