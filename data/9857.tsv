2011-09-01T15:11:00.000Z	Thykka	CluelessPerson	what do you intend to "hack"
2011-09-01T15:11:00.000Z	Thykka		hacking is not illegal, cracking is. and only if you're not cracking something you own :P
2011-09-01T15:11:00.000Z	CluelessPerson	Thykka	I have no specific intentions, I like to be knowledgable.
