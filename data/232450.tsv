2005-11-24T07:50:00.000Z	Obsidians		Hey guys! I'm trying to install Ubuntu, and I need a bit of help.
2005-11-24T07:51:00.000Z	Obsidians		See, the problem is with the xserver thing. I haven't actually made it into Gnome yet, it keeps saying that I have "no screen" in my xorg.conf file. Did something get set up wrongly?
2005-11-24T07:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	Obsidians	run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg in terminal
2005-11-24T07:54:00.000Z	Obsidians	erUSUL	I tried that. I even didn't add the actual resolution that I want to run at. It still didn't help.
