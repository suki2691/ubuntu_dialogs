2005-09-25T11:15:00.000Z	AngryParsley		ok, so I've read like 10 ways to install the java plugin for firefox, and I've tried a few and they don't work
2005-09-25T11:15:00.000Z	AngryParsley		I'm using breezy, so a lot of the stuff doesn't apply
2005-09-25T11:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	AngryParsley	 - Hmmm i am using breezy.., and i THINK all i did was use the 'add new applications' menu item. clicked on a few things and it even added Multiverse and isntalled java... let me check...
