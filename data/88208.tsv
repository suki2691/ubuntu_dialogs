2011-02-25T22:09:00.000Z	asdfgh		I have a problem. When I shutdown Ubuntu it shows KILLING ALL REMAINING PROCESSES [fail].
2011-02-25T22:10:00.000Z	asdfgh		Anybody?
2011-02-25T22:11:00.000Z	lolcatz	asdfgh	when I get those it means I have been doing too much too fast with little backup.. :/ honestly.... I 'd cconsider a nice fresh install :)
