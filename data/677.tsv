2012-10-23T04:27:00.000Z	daviddoria	PatrickDickey	(sorry for the long delay in my reply) - but the installation is stuck (for 10 hours now) - so what would you do if not stop it?

What you might be able to do (and somene else will probably be able to answer this better than I can) is download the iso and burn it to a DVD. Then use that to install. It *should* detect the current system, and allow you to upgrade it.
2012-10-23T04:33:00.000Z	daviddoria	PatrickDickey	ok, that sounds like a reasonable thing to try next if I reboot and it is broken...
