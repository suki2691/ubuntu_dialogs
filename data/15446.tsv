2012-10-07T07:29:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499		Hi, I've looked for a solution everywhere and couldn't find one...    I'm running VMWare Workstation 9.0.0 build-812388 on Ubuntu 12.04 AMD 64 bit version, everytime I go to start a virtual machine my display gliches up and is totally unusable unless I kill workstation by bring up a tty (via ctrl+alt+f1 through f6)   can anyone help me with this?
