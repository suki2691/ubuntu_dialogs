2007-07-27T09:01:00.000Z	BigMac		Hey, I am trying to dual boot ubuntu and xp using this guide: http://apcmag.com/5459/dualboot_ubuntu_and_windows_xp, but my grub has failed to load and when I perform 'find /boot/grub/stage1'it gives (hd0,1) instead of (hd0,0) as the guide assumes. Can some help me adapt those three or four commands to work with this location?
