2009-07-02T13:45:00.000Z	discorpia		i have a samsung syncmaster 2493hm, i'm running freshly installed 9.04, how do i get it to detect the monitor (currently set to a generic supporting maximum 1280x900, but can't find any way to change it)
2009-07-02T13:45:00.000Z	discorpia		there doesn't seem to be any proper display/screen sections in xorg.conf nowadays either
2009-07-02T13:47:00.000Z	discorpia		dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg gives nothing related to monitor selection, where am i supposed to change this??
