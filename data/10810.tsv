2012-02-01T03:35:00.000Z	JeffJassky		Hey, guys. I'm trying to learn more about hosting and servers for high traffic websites for a project and I'm not really sure where to start.. I've been reading about distributed computing, load balancing, etc. I know it all depends on the specific needs of the project but I'm just hoping to get a little more educated. If anyone has any suggestions on where I'd start some reading it'd be greatly appreciated. Thanks, guys.
