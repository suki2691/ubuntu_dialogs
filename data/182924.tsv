2007-05-02T06:46:00.000Z	Pelo	kiowa	no you don'T
2007-05-02T06:46:00.000Z	Pelo	kiowa	 worst case scenario you'll have to learn a little something about the command line
2007-05-02T06:47:00.000Z	Pelo	kiowa	 just type sudo apt-get install wine in the terminal or look it up in synaptic  ,   this might help a bit  http://cutlersoftware.com/ubuntuinstall/
