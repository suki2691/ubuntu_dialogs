2007-02-10T06:48:00.000Z	unop	patrick_king	 create a hook around your signup.php's register function to send a notification to you
2007-02-10T06:48:00.000Z	patrick_king	unop	how do i do that
2007-02-10T06:49:00.000Z	unop	patrick_king	 errm, i dont know how your script is laid out nor do i know much php -- what i mean is -- get the script to notifiy you (by some means) after it has finished adding a record to the mysql database
