2010-11-08T18:40:00.000Z	pwnt		how do I go about if i had a bad install, where I used to have windows 7 partition with 600gb hd. then the ubuntu took 300gb hd, and left windows 7 300gig, then after that the installation failed, Now I don't have ubuntu, but when I go to windows 7 it only has 300gig, so where can I restore my other 300gig that i've lost?
2010-11-08T18:42:00.000Z	jellow	pwnt	just re-install over the 300gb partition
2010-11-08T18:43:00.000Z	pwnt		I actually want to try and install ubuntu again, but this time what will happen when I press "Install ubuntu" that at the stage after telling it "Install aside by side with another operating system" Now instead of leaving windows 7 300gig, and ubuntu 300gig, it shows me win 150gig, ubuntu 150gig, Its like my Hard-disk shrunk in the half if you know what i mean, after failing first install, trying install again that happened to me
2010-11-08T18:43:00.000Z	pwnt	jellow	that what I am trying to do
