2005-05-10T05:40:00.000Z	_ubuntu	blackbird_	you are joking right? it boots everything out of the box
2005-05-10T05:42:00.000Z	_ubuntu	blackbird_	You really can't complain about that right? because it is the same thing when you complain about opening an ext3 in windows and it doesn't work, then can you say "windows is still too advanced for users"?
