2007-09-25T08:23:00.000Z	newbuntu		is dapper drake partitioner worthless? I get illegal block messages after installed and restarted...
2007-09-25T08:23:00.000Z	mistform	newbuntu	I can't really decide if it's worthless or not. I had 2 HDDs die while I was running dapper
2007-09-25T08:24:00.000Z	mistform	newbuntu	but I can't really say if it was from the partitioner or it was just my laptop
2007-09-25T08:26:00.000Z	mistform	newbuntu	I don't understand. You are mounting a liveCD .iso??
