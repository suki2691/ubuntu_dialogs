2010-09-21T14:00:00.000Z	dancek	llutz	he didn't say he doesn't
2010-09-21T14:01:00.000Z	llutz	dancek	"sshing into server for backup" sounds different to me
2010-09-21T14:02:00.000Z	dancek	llutz	i thought this was more about some security stuff rather than the backup technique -- i for one use rsync over ssh
