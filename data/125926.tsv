2009-10-03T21:08:00.000Z	vimalg2		Is the NVIDIA 180.xx glx  plug and play when changing between graphhics cards in the 8xxx and 9xxx series. It worked for me. Can anyone confirm?
2009-10-03T21:09:00.000Z	vimalg2		I successfully changed to a 8500gt from a 9800gt and after a reboot it picked it up correctly. Will the clock and GPU settings be correct for older card

2009-10-03T21:10:00.000Z	vimalg2	musikgoat	I figured. Thanks for confirming. :) I appreciate it
