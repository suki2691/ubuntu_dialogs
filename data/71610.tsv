2009-06-06T10:15:00.000Z	Cosmo1		when I do a custom key map bri-h do I just include the keys I need to change or all of the keys?
2009-06-06T10:16:00.000Z	Cosmo1		ok thanks
2009-06-06T10:18:00.000Z	Cosmo1		sorry about the slow typing, switched over to a devorak layout today
2009-06-06T10:20:00.000Z	Getterac7	Cosmo1	congrats on the switch.  I suggest going cold turkey and never looking back to qwerty.  it took me about 2 months to get my typing speed up to about where i was when i was using qwerty.
