2007-01-17T10:05:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	covOPprometheus	I don't know what corel is like, but I use a combination of Gimp and Inkscape for most things.
2007-01-17T10:05:00.000Z	covOPprometheus	tonyyarusso	gimp doesn't convince me, been struggling around for a while but can't get my ideas onto the bitmap
2007-01-17T10:06:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	covOPprometheus	Try inkscape then - vectors instead of bitmap
