2007-01-09T10:16:00.000Z	verdRousseau		how would I go about changing that
2007-01-09T10:17:00.000Z	sdgr406	verdRousseau	you mean just after POST and before gdm loads? the bootsplash?
2007-01-09T10:18:00.000Z	sdgr406	verdRousseau	the text 'Ubuntu' with a bar that scrolls across? that's the bootsplash
