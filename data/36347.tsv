2010-03-02T22:52:00.000Z	Jacquerie		Hey there! A quick question. Do you find it worthy to be an Ubuntu torrent seeder? Or is it just a waste of mine and everybody else bandwidth?
2010-03-02T22:52:00.000Z	OerHeks	Jacquerie	it is oke to be a seeder / mirror
2010-03-02T22:55:00.000Z	OerHeks	Jacquerie	at release lucid lynx, rour ratio will be higher
2010-03-02T22:56:00.000Z	Jacquerie	OerHeks	thank you. I'll continue seed Ubuntu (and a few other distros)
