2006-06-05T15:25:00.000Z	mitrovarr		I have some general questions about the new version (6.06)
2006-06-05T15:25:00.000Z	mitrovarr		have many of you tried it?  Does the upgrade script work well?  Does it break anything important?
2006-06-05T15:26:00.000Z	mitrovarr		I'm a little nervous ever since I completely hosed a good mandrake system with an upgrade.
