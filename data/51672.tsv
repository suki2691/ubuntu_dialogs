2009-07-30T02:08:00.000Z	burris		how do I turn off strong password checking (i.e. passwd won't reject "bad" or "simple" passwords)?  I looked in /etc/pam.d/passwd and didn't find anything beyond @include password-common ...  I also tried googling but had no luck... and please don't try to convince me not to do this or that it's a bad idea
