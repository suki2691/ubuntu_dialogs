2008-02-29T06:46:00.000Z	bluefoxx		ok, so i just got a new dvd drive and installed it, however, gxine wont detect it, and says something about dma mode rad failure from /dev/dvd. the device in question is a brand new lg super multi dvd burner with secure disk capabilities. how should i configure this device?
2008-02-29T06:48:00.000Z	bluefoxx		so how do i configure a new dvd drive in 7.10?
2008-02-29T06:48:00.000Z	LimCore	bluefoxx	hmm what is there to configure? it should just work
2008-02-29T06:50:00.000Z	bluefoxx	LimCore	for the most part, it does. however it doesnt appear as /dev/dvd and as such gxine cant seem to use it. also i dont belive the dvd reigon has been set in it
