2010-03-25T06:39:00.000Z	tp2		whitedawn - very new to ubuntu. all my *nix experience is Sun Solaris/HP-UX/AS400.  Very new to Linux in general.  The way you describe 'under sys/adm/syn top bar' it sounds very gui like?  my install of server sits at command prompt after login etc. did i miss an install option to get the synaptic tool?
2010-03-25T06:41:00.000Z	tp2		whitedawn - ok thx.  i think i will do some google searching on ubuntu and some vm/hypervisor pkgs to speed things up on vmware.  i tried a vmware tools install with my vmware guest mgr but it doesn't seem to work or install anything.

2010-03-25T06:42:00.000Z	histo	tp2	then you can sudo apt-get instlal <packagename>
