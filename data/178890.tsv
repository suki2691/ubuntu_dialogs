2010-02-01T00:22:00.000Z	Drunken_Irony		have an interesting question. I'm trying to upgrade pulseaudio in ubuntu 9.10. the commands i've read to use are here: http://pastebin.com/m77c6352e
2010-02-01T00:23:00.000Z	Drunken_Irony		will the apt-get dist-upgrade push me to 10.04 alpha?
2010-02-01T00:23:00.000Z	Drunken_Irony		or just update the pulse audio?
2010-02-01T00:24:00.000Z	jrib	Drunken_Irony	it will upgrade all packages you have installed to the latest versions in your repositories (no, it won't upgrade to 10.04)
