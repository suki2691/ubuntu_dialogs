2007-12-25T06:06:00.000Z	the_darkside_986		hey everyone... how can i convert a CD into mp3's? yes i would militantly defend ogg vorbis, but this is for my mom whose mp3 player doesn't like that format. any ideas?
2007-12-25T06:06:00.000Z	hyperb0lix	the_darkside_986	You could use Grip to rip the CD
2007-12-25T06:07:00.000Z	hyperb0lix	the_darkside_986	Grip utilizes lame if you want MP3 encoding
2007-12-25T06:09:00.000Z	hyperb0lix	the_darkside_986	lame isn't encoding the wavs as mp3s?
