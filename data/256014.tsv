2005-01-29T16:07:00.000Z	melazyboy	thenuke	it will just add the constrant of having to utilize the drives wheither you use them or not
2005-01-29T16:07:00.000Z	melazyboy	thenuke	but setting it up is easy you will have loose everything when you create the array just apt-get raid-tools, and man mkraid, and raidtab
