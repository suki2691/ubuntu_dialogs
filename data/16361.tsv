2011-04-29T13:24:00.000Z	Sik		So, I just updated to 11.04 through the updater, and was forced to go into safe mode since apparently Unity crashes on this hardware (video doesn't respond, sometimes system won't boot at all)... besides I don't like it anyways. Is there any way to set Ubuntu to always start with the old shell?

2011-04-29T13:25:00.000Z	Sik	jatt	OK, how do I make the old shell the default though? (I'll forget to do it every time, and my mum won't even get she has to do it)
2011-04-29T13:26:00.000Z	jatt	Sik	I don't remember either :(... maybe in the login screen you can set it as default?
