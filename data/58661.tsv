2009-12-26T01:54:00.000Z	xiong	n8tuser	That's my idea. I don't know how to do that. I'm not even sure how to search for background, how to study the issue, because I don't know what to call things. I'm floundering in detailed docs for 'XDG' without having any idea what controls menus, in a practical user sense.
