2006-04-06T11:23:00.000Z	ds[de] 	steffen	rmdir /folder
2006-04-06T11:28:00.000Z	ds[de] 	steffen	rm -Rf /folder but BE CAREFUL, because it will delete the folder with all files and subfolders in it
2006-04-06T11:30:00.000Z	ds[de] 	steffen	yes, but it'll ask you for every file in it if you really want to delete it
