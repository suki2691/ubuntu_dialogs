2007-01-06T14:10:00.000Z	eitan		hey guys...I wish to install xfree86 over xorg on my 6.10 laptop.  When I try to install xfree86-driver-synaptics for my touchpad, it results in a message about dependencies.  I am doing this to solve a problem I've been having (along with many other people) with their laptop ALPS touchpad devices being buggy in Xorg.  Thanks!
