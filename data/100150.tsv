2008-04-25T07:56:00.000Z	Surrealwraith		Hey.  Just installed 8.04 on my IBM/Lenovo Thinkpad T60, i386.  When I close the laptop, then open it again, the screen becomes all "messed up" and I need to do a hard system shutdown.  Any suggestions?

2008-04-25T07:58:00.000Z	jordanjay29	Surrealwraith	You sure? I just adjusted my settings, closed my lid and opened again. It does nothing, as I instructed it too. And, yeah, comcast is a pain in the [you know where] for torrents.
