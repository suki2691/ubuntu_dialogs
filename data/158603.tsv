2009-12-10T00:57:00.000Z	Eqnox		What's the latest LTS release?  And how do I get it from the ubuntu download page?  It seems to want to 'detect' 32-bit...Whereas I want the option to download 64-bit LTS AMD64
2009-12-10T00:58:00.000Z	Eqnox		So 9.04 isn't a LTS ?
2009-12-10T00:58:00.000Z	Slart	Eqnox	you should be able to select any version you want from the ubuntu site, click Alternative download options
2009-12-10T00:59:00.000Z	Slart	Eqnox	last LTS was 8.04
