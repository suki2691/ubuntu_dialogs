2009-06-10T19:28:00.000Z	Spike1506	ZykoticK9	i will read that, altough it did work fine before when i had dual boot with windows :/
2009-06-10T19:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Spike1506	i think it's a BIOS setting rather then "problem"
2009-06-10T19:30:00.000Z	Spike1506	ZykoticK9	well there are not many settings in my bios and i already changed them to factory default
