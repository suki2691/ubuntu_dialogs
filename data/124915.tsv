2010-07-31T08:21:00.000Z	hrishi		I'm having problems in my desktop. I'm running ubuntu 10.04 on i386 arch. Ocassionally when I start my system, the window decorator of gtk goes missing. Is this because I installed compiz(is it a bug in compiz)? I have to do "gtk-window-decorator --replace&" to get it working. How do I get this resolved permanently?
