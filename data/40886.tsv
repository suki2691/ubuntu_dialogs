2009-12-16T17:53:00.000Z	Sumpen		hey guys! Im about to install Ubuntu 9.1 on a ThinkPad with a Intel Core 2 Duo processor. When I switch to 64-bit version on Ubintu download page, the file name when downloading is: ubuntu-9.10-desktop-amd64. Does this mean its wrong version ( for AMD processors ) or is it just a confusing file name? Thx in advance.
