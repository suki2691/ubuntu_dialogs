2009-03-02T04:35:00.000Z	gomli		why isn't /etc/init.d/ssh restart disconnecting me from ssh?
2009-03-02T04:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gomli	 becuase the service just starts the connections
2009-03-02T04:36:00.000Z	gomli	Dr_willis	I changed the port in ssh_conf but it's still using the old port
2009-03-02T04:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gomli	 interesting.. i cant say that vie tried that.
