2008-05-11T01:47:00.000Z	andi5	salah_	if you do not mind the terminal, try aptitude, and skip removing of the other dependencies of ubuntu-desktop by pressing '+' on the header of the corresponding group in the confirmation screen... but probably there is another (more standard) way to achieve the same effect
2008-05-11T01:48:00.000Z	salah_	andi5	can you give me a example command of the + operator?
2008-05-11T01:49:00.000Z	andi5	salah_	just play around with aptitude, + is for marking as to-be-installed/upgraded, -/_ for marking as to-be-uninstalled
