2008-08-11T04:03:00.000Z	aechols		is there an application that will organize coupons for Linux?
2008-08-11T04:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	aechols	 sort of like a  Virtual refrigrator - with virtual magnets holding the virtual cupons? :) thats what my wife uses... (well a real fridge)
2008-08-11T04:05:00.000Z	aechols	Dr_willis	I just don't feel like taking the time to create a database for the coupons, that's why i was wondering.
