2010-02-25T20:52:00.000Z	roblem		hey everyone.  trying to make a custom distro cd of karmic, and trying to leave off a lot of packages.  when I blow packages away, the no longer show up in the Packages file,  and aren't on the CD, but the 'ubuntu-desktop' task still selects them, and they download instead.  how can I make the installer forget about them?
