2007-01-17T16:54:00.000Z	morpheus74		I'm running Ubuntu 6.06 and tried the unix2dos command but the command is not found.  Is this utility part of the 6.06 package?

2007-03-22T06:57:00.000Z	ikonia_	morpheus74	yup - but if you follow the guide and get the nvidia-glx package it will do it all for you
2007-03-22T06:58:00.000Z	ikonia_	morpheus74	that one (see pm)
