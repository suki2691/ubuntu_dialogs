2010-03-03T01:21:00.000Z	Samstein		The reason i'm switching to windows is, I have a legit copy of Windows with a fancy sticker on the side of my case, but because i don't have 'recovery disks' i borrowed the same version of windows to install it again using my key that is paid for...but it wont activate and now my computer has reduced function...and they want me to pay $200 for the recovery disks that should have come with the computer in the first place, talk about a load
