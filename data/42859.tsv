2010-04-15T23:19:00.000Z	Wallace		I burnt an ISO of 9.04 to CD, and all is fine from the machine I burnt it from.  However, I can't boot from it on my old laptop, and from windows, the CD appears empty.  Any ideas what might be wrong?  Any known compatibility issues that I've missed?

2010-04-15T23:20:00.000Z	Wallace	xangua	about 4 or 5 years (I used to have 7.04 on it).  What do you mean by "resources" exactly?
