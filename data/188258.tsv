2006-05-20T09:56:00.000Z	bbrazil	YoussefAssad	very easy to wipe the account after every customer
2006-05-20T09:57:00.000Z	YoussefAssad	bbrazil	I'm just thinking from the perspective of cybercafes hee in Egypt. People use them overwhelmingly for multiplayer games and for that, cedega + linux + $GAMES just isn't worth the trouble
