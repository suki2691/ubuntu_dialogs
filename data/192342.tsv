2006-04-01T15:11:00.000Z	frederik		I'm a Linux newbie. I installed Ubuntu earlier today. Now I've reached the point where I need to edit a file that's write-protected and owned by root. What's the smart way to do this? I read something about sudo, but I thought I might ask in here. Thx for your answers
2006-04-01T15:12:00.000Z	harm__	frederik	.. sudo vi /FILELOCATIOn
2006-04-01T15:26:00.000Z	harm__	frederik	just do sudo gedit /location
2006-04-01T15:26:00.000Z	harm__	frederik	where is the file located? and sometimes files are empty
