2005-05-07T11:04:00.000Z	mitrick	Raskall	what do u mean by unfinished?
2005-05-07T11:05:00.000Z	Raskall	mitrick	a lot of ubuntu things are missing from the kde setup, I think. I haven't used it much because it bugs me that I cant find the things I have gotten used to in gnome.
2005-05-07T11:07:00.000Z	Raskall	mitrick	but it might just be that I don't like kde anymore since I switched to gnome.
