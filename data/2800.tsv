2012-05-29T09:42:00.000Z	Drecondius		Can someone point me to a website that has a fairly recent list of wireless hardware compatible with linux? I have googled, and googled till I just can't do it any more.

2012-05-29T09:43:00.000Z	Drecondius	MrMalak	Hardware to buy, specifically Wireless N adapters
2012-05-29T09:44:00.000Z	MrMalak	Drecondius	From what I know which isn't a lot the name brand hardware like linksys tends to be supported but I am not an expert but I hope that helps heh
