2007-05-06T14:22:00.000Z	Nubbie	jhall	you need to set up a key combo in Keyboard Shortcuts.
2007-05-06T14:23:00.000Z	jhall	Nubbie	do you know if the "windows" key works with ubuntu?
2007-05-06T14:23:00.000Z	Nubbie	jhall	once again, you would need to set up that shortcut yourself in Keyboard Shortcuts
