2008-08-09T01:59:00.000Z	Dada_		Hi guys :) Anyone have experience with Ubuntu running in Parallels 3?
2008-08-09T02:00:00.000Z	Dada_		I've got Ubuntu installed but can't connect to the internet. I need to make it connect to a virtual wireless driver I think.
2008-08-09T02:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Dada_	Have you tried System -> Administration -> Hardware ?
2008-08-09T02:01:00.000Z	Dada_	Jordan_U	I'll try this, thanks
