2012-06-06T00:23:00.000Z	KarateKip3		Hallow! I am trying to open a port here, but it just won't work. I tried ufw, and "sudo ufw status" says that the port is open, but nmap says that the port is closed. Even after I type "sudo ufw disable", nmap still says that the port is closed. I already rebooted and checked again, but still closed. How do I open a port?
2012-06-06T00:23:00.000Z	llutz	KarateKip3	is there something listening on that port?
2012-06-06T00:24:00.000Z	KarateKip3		yes, but i have another port which has nothing listening on it. Same problem.
