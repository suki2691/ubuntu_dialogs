2009-04-24T06:35:00.000Z	recon69_lap	peterloorke	check your firewall, it's probably blocking share
2009-04-24T06:40:00.000Z	peterloorke	recon69_lap	i installed gufw and it says my firewall is disabled
2009-04-24T06:58:00.000Z	recon69_lap	peterloorke	the router firewall should be left on, check the windows machine's firewall, and also check you workgroup setting
