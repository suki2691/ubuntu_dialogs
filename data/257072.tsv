2007-08-06T09:29:00.000Z	Quingin		need some help trying to get ubuntu to boot. and im hoping someone here can help me. and it may be the computer. when i put the disk in it runs like normal goes through the boot process and then hangs when it tries to load the gui. it shows the splash screen that says what is loading and when that disapears and before anything else loads it locks up. any ideas? i have used this same disk to install on my laptop so i know the disk works

2007-08-06T09:33:00.000Z	Falstius	Quingin	you'll have to check the help at the boot menu or do a google search for details (I don't know the exact syntax)
