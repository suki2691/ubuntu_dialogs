2012-04-18T22:50:00.000Z	buhman		what's the difference between -updates and -security?
2012-04-18T22:51:00.000Z	jrib	buhman	-updates is for updates that are not security related
2012-04-18T22:52:00.000Z	buhman	jrib	if it is security related, will -updates and -security be identical?
2012-04-18T22:55:00.000Z	jrib	buhman	see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories My guess is an update is not placed in both -updates and -security, but I am not sure.
