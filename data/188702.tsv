2006-07-15T13:22:00.000Z	XiXaQ	Felos	actually, that's a very good idea.  I wish I'd done that when I installed the system.

2006-07-15T13:26:00.000Z	Felos	XiXaQ	all right, thanks. I remember hearing that certain mount points shouldn't be in separate partitions/drives, I don't recall which atm though.
