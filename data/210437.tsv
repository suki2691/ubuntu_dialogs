2005-12-12T11:08:00.000Z	linux_n00b_e		I have a question: Is there a way to replace or upgrade the processor and CPU in a computer?
2005-12-12T11:09:00.000Z	linux_n00b_e		Really? Where could I find info on that?
2005-12-12T11:10:00.000Z	linux_n00b_e		I have a computer with a Pentium II and I'd like to upgrade the chip, but I figured I'd have to replace the whole entire motherboard and CPU in order to do that....
2005-12-12T11:11:00.000Z	hedonick	linux_n00b_e	probably true with a computer that old. It's not like you can cram any newfangled processor in there.
