2008-12-27T19:58:00.000Z	joaopinto	Schuenemann	there is no such package for ubuntu, probably what you are looking for is included in another package like nfs-common
2008-12-27T20:07:00.000Z	Schuenemann	joaopinto	it's not. I'm following a tutorial to kernel recompilation and it's asking for those packages
2008-12-27T20:08:00.000Z	Schuenemann	joaopinto	what is it for, anyway?
