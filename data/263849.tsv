2005-03-03T11:46:00.000Z	photoguy41		then why when i try to compile fluxbox does it say Fluxbox requires the X Window System libraries and headers
2005-03-03T11:46:00.000Z	Agrajag	photoguy41	because you don't have the X static libraries and headers installed
2005-03-03T11:47:00.000Z	Agrajag	photoguy41	yes, and most likely so is fluxbox
