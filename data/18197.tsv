2011-02-16T23:22:00.000Z	mtkorb	BiPolah	When I try to ping any server, I get "...Packet filtered..." and I can't use apt-get install. I'm not behind a firewall, and the same commands work as expected when I boot the exact same Ubuntu install on a different laptop (it's installed on a USB drive).

2011-02-16T23:29:00.000Z	mtkorb	BiPolah	It's a fresh Ubuntu install on a flash drive. I want it to be able to move from one laptop to another, but it's having network issues when I boot a different laptop.
