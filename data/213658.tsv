2009-10-11T16:49:00.000Z	nibbler	tonyyarusso	Letterbomb05: if you have it not as .iso, to a mount -obind /directory/on/usb/with/iso/content /where/it/should/be/mounted
2009-10-11T16:50:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	nibbler	Yeah, but that's assuming a running system, not the installer.
2009-10-11T16:50:00.000Z	nibbler	tonyyarusso	sure,i dontknow if the installer accepts that - if it does only check for existance of files or if it checks the mount output including FS etc
