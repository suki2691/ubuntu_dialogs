2010-03-23T18:06:00.000Z	CR0W		In System>Administration>Time and Date when I change the day it changes back after about a second. Why? What do I do wrong? Ubuntu 9.10 just isntalled.
2010-03-23T18:08:00.000Z	CR0W		Could someone at least check if this problem occurs in his ubuntu 9.10?
2010-03-23T18:09:00.000Z	vertx	CR0W	I don't have your problem. I'm using 9.10
