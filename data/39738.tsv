2010-11-13T18:21:00.000Z	asina12	llutz_	If I do ps -A|grep compiz and the result is null, can I say with certainty that the current window  manager is metacity?
2010-11-13T18:22:00.000Z	llutz_	asina12	no, you just can say "its not compiz"
2010-11-13T18:23:00.000Z	asina12	llutz_	sorry...forgot to say...assuming that my system only has compiz and metacity installed...
