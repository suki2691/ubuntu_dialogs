2009-11-10T00:13:00.000Z	tag	bruno123	Works fairly well, runs 32 bit binaries alright too so long as you install libc6-i386 and friends.
2009-11-10T00:13:00.000Z	tag	bruno123	I'm able to run 32 bit oracle-xe on it without any trouble.
2009-11-10T00:14:00.000Z	tag	bruno123	Good question, I've been meaning to test that.
