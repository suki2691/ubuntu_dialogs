2004-10-02T06:26:00.000Z	jeedee		I wish I could boot into ubuntu but for some reason grub refuses to work, it just hangs at Loading stage with no apparent errors
2004-10-02T06:28:00.000Z	jeedee		Nope, everything standard (ext3, ect.) The only thing that might cause a problem is that im installing on the same hd as windows
2004-10-02T06:28:00.000Z	jeedee		What version of grub is included in ubuntu?
2004-10-02T06:29:00.000Z	Kamion	jeedee	      grub | 0.95+cvs20040624-3ubuntu15 |         warty | source, amd64, i386
