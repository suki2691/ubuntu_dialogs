2009-05-21T22:10:00.000Z	timater123	iam_techno	ok let me try this
2009-05-21T22:10:00.000Z	iam_techno	timater123	 if autoremove removes packages, then you've probably "downgraded"
2009-05-21T22:12:00.000Z	timater123	iam_techno	it has selected to remove 6 packages, including linux-headers-2.6.28-11-generic
