2009-10-29T07:56:00.000Z	zedster		I have a share on my win7 box that does not need a pw, yet when I try to open if from ubuntu a pw dialogue opens, anyone know what I can do to fix this? It was working fine untill I ran a update on windows
2009-10-29T07:57:00.000Z	gogeta	zedster	leave the pw empty
2009-10-29T07:57:00.000Z	zedster	gogeta	it won't let me hit ok
2009-10-29T07:58:00.000Z	zedster	gogeta	correction, I get nothing
