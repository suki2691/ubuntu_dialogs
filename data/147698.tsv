2007-01-26T15:02:00.000Z	mustaukko	tonyy_on_kde	super. Sounds reasonable. Since those instructions have really helped me. Though it's much tougher on newcomers.
2007-01-26T15:03:00.000Z	tonyy_on_kde	mustaukko	agreed, it should be better.  But any wiki is xetter than the frustration of reinstalling a broken system.
2007-01-26T15:04:00.000Z	mustaukko	tonyy_on_kde	Yeah, by miles. And even the current is a lot better than gentoo (which on the other hand teaches users a lot about linux) :)
