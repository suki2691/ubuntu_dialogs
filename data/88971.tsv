2011-01-13T20:41:00.000Z	abli		Hi! Is something wrong with ubuntu repositories / mirrors? I am getting 404 errors when trying to get for example http://en.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu//dists/lucid/main/i18n/Translation-en_US.bz2
2011-01-13T20:42:00.000Z	abli		(Which, apparently aptitude would want to download when running an 'aptitude update')
2011-01-13T20:43:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	abli	Seems to be down from here, but most of the site is up - http://en.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/lucid/main/
2011-01-13T20:47:00.000Z	abli	Gaming4JC	no, it appears that of the en_* variants, en_US is missing. Did the USA go away while I was not looking?
