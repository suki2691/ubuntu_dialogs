2008-01-12T02:26:00.000Z	tretle		hi, I installed ubuntu and then upgraded it to ubnutu+1 or hardy alpha a few weeks ago. I installed windows xp on another partition afterwards and then a few weeks after last night I installed ubuntu gutsy onto the last partition.... I thought that it would reinstall grub but it didnt and now Im stuck with the windows boot manager which gives me too options... windows xp or other os and the other os option doesnt work
2008-01-12T02:27:00.000Z	tretle		how do I get grub to reset as default  and detect the three os's
