2008-11-17T06:08:00.000Z	Mikkas		Anybody have a link to the preferred way to install gimp 2.6 in Ubuntu 8.04? I can't upgrade to 8.10...
2008-11-17T06:09:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Mikkas	 proberly compile from source would be the best way...  unless you can find some 3rd parth that has debs made for  8.04 allready that would be better .
2008-11-17T06:09:00.000Z	Mikkas	Dr_willis	If thats the way, thats cool. Wasn't sure if some deb package from a reputable place existed
2008-11-17T06:10:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Mikkas	 check the PPA repos..   or backports repos.. or  if you want to risk it.. those autopackage/klick packages.. :() but i would do source befor i tried those..
