2006-09-25T08:33:00.000Z	chronic1	dgl	there is a page on the wiki via RESTEDFORMATS
2006-09-25T08:34:00.000Z	dgl	chronic1	I know about mp3 license problems, but I ve got a lot of mp3, and now, I want to encode them to ogg
2006-09-25T08:35:00.000Z	chronic1	dgl	i think that wiki page has instuctions how to transcode them
