2010-02-19T05:28:00.000Z	preston_		I am having a problem with flash player. I am running ubuntu 9.10. I have tried reinstalling both firefox and flash player, but nothing worked. It says they are both working fine, but nothing I can't seem to load any videos or flash applets. Can anyone help?
2010-02-19T05:29:00.000Z	PeskyJ	preston_	did you install flash player using ubuntu software centre or a download from the adobe site?
