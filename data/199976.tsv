2006-05-05T12:14:00.000Z	cius		why is it that in order to remove ekiga using synaptic it tells me I have to remove ubuntu-desktop?
2006-05-05T12:16:00.000Z	cius		what if I don't want to remove the entire ubuntu-desktop, but just ekiga?
2006-05-05T12:16:00.000Z	slavik	cius	ubuntu-desktop doesn't actually provide anything ... it only has lots of dependancies
2006-05-05T12:17:00.000Z	cius	slavik	so removing it doesn't actually remove anything from the system?
