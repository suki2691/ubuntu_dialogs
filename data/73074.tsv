2011-10-30T23:41:00.000Z	LargePrime		Dear Sirs; I disabled/removed my proprietary graphics driver.  Upon reboot, no graphics.  ubuntu 11.10.  Thoughts (besides I am a moron)??

2011-10-30T23:48:00.000Z	LargePrime	Wolfsherz	how did you get it to have any graphics
2011-10-30T23:48:00.000Z	Wolfsherz	LargePrime	it just came up with only my background-image
