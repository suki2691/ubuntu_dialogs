2010-03-17T08:15:00.000Z	Guest12516		So, I'm thinking about investing in a GeForce 9400gt video card, but I wanted to ask the room a couple more questions.
2010-03-17T08:16:00.000Z	Guest12516		I wanted to know, because my Intel video card can't even do desktop effects, would the GeForce 9400gt be able to do compiz well and support above 1024x768 resolution? And would it be able to handle a game like Doom 3?
2010-03-17T08:17:00.000Z	Guest12516		That's what I figured but I just had to be sure. I've asked like three times now but I lost the results when someone answer lawl so I asked again
