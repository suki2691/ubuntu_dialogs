2007-02-08T08:36:00.000Z	ian6		I'm using edgy, apt-get upgrade -s shows that there are kernel upgrades (2.6.17.11), but refuses to install them. Are those packages broken, or is there something else going on?
2007-02-08T08:36:00.000Z	soundray	ian6	there is an inconsistency on the server side.
2007-02-08T08:36:00.000Z	ian6	soundray	so this is something that will clear itself up eventually?
2007-02-08T08:37:00.000Z	soundray	ian6	yes, I hope so
