2009-05-31T21:14:00.000Z	ziroday	thebitgu1u	I believe so, you could probably check with sudo iptables -L
2009-05-31T21:17:00.000Z	thebitgu1u	ziroday	weird, I have allowed port 4444, but I can't seem to access it.  Can you please help me debug this? Here is iptable -L http://pastebin.com/d160537db
2009-05-31T21:18:00.000Z	ziroday	thebitgu1u	I'm sorry I'm not iptables expert :)
