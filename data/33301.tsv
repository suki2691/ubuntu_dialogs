2011-08-20T20:35:00.000Z	rumpe1	Kyle__	sudo iwconfig <device> mode managed (?)
2011-08-20T20:36:00.000Z	Kyle__	rumpe1	OK, so that's a no, not through network-manager, but using the CLI methods.
2011-08-20T20:36:00.000Z	Kyle__	rumpe1	I just didn't want to go through using the CLI tools, to find out it screwed up what ubuntu setup :)
