2007-09-23T05:06:00.000Z	akos		Hello! Can anyone help me out if there is an automated thing for putting multiple pictures together side by side? like a 2x2 grid, or something... And please don't just say "use gimp", because I am really new to it... :P

2007-09-23T05:07:00.000Z	akos		matthew_, e.g. copy it to the htdocs dir
2007-09-23T05:08:00.000Z	matthew__	akos	 where is the htdocs directory?
