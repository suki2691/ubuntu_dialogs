2010-09-01T23:49:00.000Z	FoolishOwl		Hello folks. Evolution is driving me nuts -- it's slow, and often fails to display emails that include HTML. I'm thinking of switching to Thunderbird, or maybe Seamonkey. Any reason not to?

2010-09-01T23:50:00.000Z	FoolishOwl	eblume	I don't know. My main use is for reading Gmail via IMAP.
2010-09-01T23:50:00.000Z	eblume	FoolishOwl	then you should be fine switching to whatever.
