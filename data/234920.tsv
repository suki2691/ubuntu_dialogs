2005-05-29T15:56:00.000Z	mattlins		When I try to install the Netbean 4.1 IDE I get an error message about "unable to run in graphical mode"  Does anybody know how to resolve this?
2005-05-29T15:57:00.000Z	pestilence	mattlins	how are you trying to run it?
2005-05-29T15:57:00.000Z	mattlins	pestilence	It is a .bin file.  I try to execute it by typing sudo <netbeans.bin>
2005-05-29T15:59:00.000Z	pestilence	mattlins	same thing for sudo sh netbeans.bin ?
