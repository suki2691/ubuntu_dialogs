2004-11-28T09:00:00.000Z	drakonim		No `START-INFO-DIR-ENTRY' and no `This file documents'. \ install-info(/usr/share/info/sed.info): unable to determine description for `dir' entry - giving up
2004-11-28T09:00:00.000Z	drakonim		I have added a line in dir for sed to make it look like a working one... but no luck.
