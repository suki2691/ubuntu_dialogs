2009-08-30T00:02:00.000Z	gustavonarea	Flannel	Thank you, but I cannot see that example. I mean, I can see several sample labels, but I cannot see one for servers. Do you know if in the case of a Jaunty ISO I should use "kernel install/vmlinuz"? The HOWTO suggests "kernel ubuntu-desktop/casper/vmlinuz" but it doesn't exist

2009-08-30T00:06:00.000Z	gustavonarea	Flannel	ok, thank you!
