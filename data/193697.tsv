2006-07-21T12:08:00.000Z	abbot45		so anyone.  is there any reason why .mov, .mp3, .avi shouldn't be working in totem-xine even though i've got w32codecs installed?
2006-07-21T12:09:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	abbot45	got all that gstreamer stuff installed?
2006-07-21T12:09:00.000Z	abbot45	fyrestrtr	yes, but that doesn't matter because totem-xine doesn't use gstreamer.  totem-gstreamer does.
2006-07-21T12:10:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	abbot45	oh yeah :) whoops.
