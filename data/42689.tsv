2010-06-13T05:59:00.000Z	goplexian		I'm having a problem with a zip file not unzipping, I know the archive is valid since it matches the md5sum value
2010-06-13T06:00:00.000Z	goplexian		but when I do `unzip file.zip` I get End-of-central-directory signature not found.

2010-06-13T06:03:00.000Z	goplexian	hoonteke	no I'm not sure about that
