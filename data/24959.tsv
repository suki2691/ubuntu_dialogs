2010-10-03T18:27:00.000Z	c3l	hjhkjh	what is your issue?
2010-10-03T18:28:00.000Z	hjhkjh	c3l	when i try to install ubuntu, it freezes, when i press ESC it appears the console and says: Process: 311 GLib - WARNING **: get pwuid_r ( ) failed due to unknown user id
2010-10-03T18:31:00.000Z	c3l	hjhkjh	hm, thats not a very uncommon error. sometimes I see it at boot, but it doesn't cause any trouble. I would place my bet on that the installation medium is screwed up.
