2009-10-19T00:12:00.000Z	Euler_		I have a strange problem! All of a sudden, the drivers for my graphics card is gone (can't change resolution or use any desktop effects). I have a EEE 1005 with EasyPeasy 1.5. Anyone have an idea of how to fix this? I have tried to reinstall the drivers through Synaptic package manager.
2009-10-19T00:14:00.000Z	xrandr	Euler_	tried going to the manufacturer's website and checking there for drivers?
2009-10-19T00:14:00.000Z	Euler_	xrandr	Yes, no luck for Linux, but i'll check again
