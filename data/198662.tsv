2008-08-05T21:48:00.000Z	DragonDon		Greetings all!
2008-08-05T21:50:00.000Z	DragonDon		I'm fairly new to ubuntu but have enjoyed installing it on 3 different machines.  Now working on tweaking them and how to use them better.
2008-08-05T21:51:00.000Z	DragonDon		Got a question about formatting a 2nd drive.  I have a 160GB old WinXP drive that is installed but I would like to wipe it and use it strictly for storage and shared on the network.  What is the best tool to do this?
