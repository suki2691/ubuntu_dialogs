2012-10-30T20:28:00.000Z	Ashael		quick question: my archive manager seems to be broken. how do i reinstall? I get a warning if i try to remove it. (on 12.10)
2012-10-30T20:29:00.000Z	wols	Ashael	name of said manager?
2012-10-30T20:30:00.000Z	wols	Ashael	you can remove and reinstall it, but unless you know how it "doesn't work" it's probably not a good idea
