2009-11-16T21:20:00.000Z	ziesemer		How can I disable NetworkManager in karmic?  I ran "update-rc.d -f NetworkManager remove", but something is still relaunching it.  I need to configure my interfaces manually.

2009-11-16T21:23:00.000Z	ziesemer	tritium	what counts as "manually configured"?  Anything in /etc/network/interfaces?
2009-11-16T21:23:00.000Z	tritium	ziesemer	yes
