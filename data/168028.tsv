2006-11-11T17:27:00.000Z	damg_		are there any mono 1.2 final debs available already?
2006-11-11T17:28:00.000Z	JosefK	damg_	alas no, fairly trivial to build them into /usr/local from source though
2006-11-11T17:29:00.000Z	damg_	JosefK	thanks, I'll try to build a deb then (:
2006-11-11T17:29:00.000Z	JosefK	damg_	well, you can build a deb if you're adventurous, I just meant compiling the latest mono into /usr/local though :)
