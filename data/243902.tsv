2005-04-24T15:58:00.000Z	fangorious	XTC	is there an /etc/init.d script for iptables?
2005-04-24T15:59:00.000Z	fangorious	XTC	iptables supports arguments like --save and --restore that you can use to save the rules at shutdown, and then load them again at startup
2005-04-24T15:59:00.000Z	fangorious	XTC	see the manpage for the details on the commands. If you have access to an FC box you can look at their init.d script which does the save/restore
