2004-12-14T16:27:00.000Z	davmor2		can anyone help please I just tried to upgrade my kernel to the i686 version as i thought it might speed things up a bit for me. when i rebooted and in grub selected the i686 kernel it wouldn't boot xserver as it could find the nvidia module, yet if i go back to the i386 kernel it boots up fine how can i stop this so i can use the i686 kernel
