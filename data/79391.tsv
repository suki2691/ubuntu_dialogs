2011-08-17T02:42:00.000Z	Amin_		just tried to run Internet Explorer under Wine (cause I've got to browse a site which is only opens with IE). While the default IE on Wine does'nt open I tried installing IE6 which I was downloaded but it says there's an older version of IE already installed on my pc... what to do?
