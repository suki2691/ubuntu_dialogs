2011-05-11T15:52:00.000Z	http\junky	emilevictor	do you have root?
2011-05-11T15:53:00.000Z	emilevictor	http\junky	I have root. I am getting this error. "NEW SGAC [10:51:55] ~ # service mysql start   start: Job failed to start " I have googled it, but the internets don't have a very good answer for me
