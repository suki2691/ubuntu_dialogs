2009-08-28T14:41:00.000Z	XQbit		so uhh, my friend's PC shows a message - An automatic fsck of the root filesystem failed. A manual fsck must be performed in maintenance mode. Maintenance shell started.
2009-08-28T14:41:00.000Z	XQbit		what is he supposed to write then?
2009-08-28T14:42:00.000Z	MenZa	XQbit	I suggest booting into a livecd, and fsck'ing all my partitions manually iwth that.
2009-08-28T14:43:00.000Z	MenZa	XQbit	File-system check disk. It basically checks if something went wrong with the partitions and tries to correct whatever mistakes it finds.
