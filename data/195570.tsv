2007-12-17T05:19:00.000Z	kitche	kregg	stable as in what?
2007-12-17T05:20:00.000Z	kitche	kregg	well with intel chips compiz-fusion won't work that great anyways
2007-12-17T05:21:00.000Z	kitche	kregg	it could be the driver you usign as well if you use the intel driver since it crashes all the time on certain chipsets
