2011-11-27T01:10:00.000Z	c_smith	jari	if you feel like some games, try playdeb at http://www.playdeb.net/welcome/
2011-11-27T01:11:00.000Z	jari	c_smith	no thanks. not realy playing games on linux ;p
2011-11-27T01:11:00.000Z	c_smith	jari	then, try getdeb if you feel like discovering some neat apps (playdeb is getdeb's sister site) getdeb doesn't have games, but there's some neat apps there.
