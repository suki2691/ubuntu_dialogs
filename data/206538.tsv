2007-12-02T03:25:00.000Z	syngin001		ok thanks
2007-12-02T03:27:00.000Z	syngin001		is there a place also to place a script when system is shutting down?
2007-12-02T03:28:00.000Z	sethk	syngin001	there is, but I don't recall the name off the top of my head.  Look in   man shutdown    I think it will tell you
