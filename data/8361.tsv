2011-11-03T15:15:00.000Z	ZeitFight		When I typed vim in my terminal it tells me "The program vim can be found in the following packages: vim, vim-gnome, vim-tiny, vim-athena, vim-gtk, vim-nox." Which one should I download?
2011-11-03T15:15:00.000Z	jrib	ZeitFight	the one you want ;)
2011-11-03T15:16:00.000Z	ZeitFight	jrib	I'm looking for a less GUI-based editor. Which one would that be in this case?
2011-11-03T15:16:00.000Z	jrib	ZeitFight	all of them... Do you want gvim (vim outside of terminal as a gui window)?
