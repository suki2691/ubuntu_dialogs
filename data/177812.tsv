2006-09-05T06:56:00.000Z	tuxedup		I was reding ont he ubuntu forums about the problems people were having with their laptosp overheating if they had a intel core due.  Does thios affect other processors, specifically the pentium m series?

2006-09-05T06:58:00.000Z	tuxedup	Jack_Sparrow	do you have to do anything in rehgards to setting trip point for the fan to kick in, or does the kernel handle all this its self, or do config files for acpi control this?
