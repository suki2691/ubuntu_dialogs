2009-01-12T20:10:00.000Z	Ham1979		Help! I upgraded to 8.04 which went wrong towards the end and now I have a system which is painfully slow doing things that worked fine previously - any way of refreshing the op system?

2009-01-12T20:15:00.000Z	n8tuser2	Ham1979	-> not all of it, some are in the server side? and not stash in /home
2009-01-12T20:21:00.000Z	n8tuser2	Ham1979	-> you can make copies of your /etc/ and stash it in a dir in /home/  if /home will be preserved
