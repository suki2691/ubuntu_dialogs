2009-12-20T23:06:00.000Z	leo		hey guys could anyone help me with an ubuntu9.10 issue? im totally new to this os and i decided to try it out a few days ago. i installed it above my windows xp system. as i tried to run ubuntu, something like the loading screen with the ubuntu logo appeared. afterwards i had a totally black screen with only the cursor in the middle of it. since i was able to move the cursor and saw it...
2009-12-20T23:06:00.000Z	leo		...changing into the "link" hand on some places i assumed that there was something wrong with the gui. starting ubuntu directly from a cd in demo mode leads to the same problem? anyone a idea of what i did wrong? :(
