2006-10-30T09:34:00.000Z	nrdb	zeus77	there wouldn't be any GUI for a requester.
2006-10-30T09:34:00.000Z	zeus77	nrdb	what about the the command line?
2006-10-30T09:36:00.000Z	nrdb	zeus77	the init.d scripts are run as root anyway, you could probably use sudo to run a script as non root, and get sudo to prompt for a password.
