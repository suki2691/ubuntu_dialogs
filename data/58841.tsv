2009-12-12T16:03:00.000Z	cmdshftn		quick question for anyone; checked in forums and couldn't find much; woke up and heard my karmic server's hard drive going, ran a ps aux over ssh and found this process running on root "dd bs=1 if=/pro"  any reason why this would be running automatically during the night?
2009-12-12T16:04:00.000Z	cmdshftn		I know dd and bs=1, not familiar with the if=/pro and why it would be running on its own

2009-12-12T16:06:00.000Z	cmdshftn	frogzoo	I'm hoping that this box isn't compromised as I don't have it exposed to external network right now
