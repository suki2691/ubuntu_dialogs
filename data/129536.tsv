2009-07-26T11:26:00.000Z	eboyjr	woodgrain2701	You do not have Flash installed.. I will give you a link to install it. One second please.
2009-07-26T11:28:00.000Z	eboyjr	woodgrain2701	Click this link: http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/ . Then where it says "Select version to download..." , select .deb for Ubuntu 8.04+. Agree to the terms and click the yellow button.
