2007-02-20T12:22:00.000Z	Gonzo		hey guys, is it possible to skip the partitioning step in the installer?
2007-02-20T12:22:00.000Z	Gonzo		or to run the installer in text mode with the live cd
2007-02-20T12:22:00.000Z	Gonzo		i wanna use a swap file instead of swap partition
2007-02-20T12:23:00.000Z	zerodni	Gonzo	you are using a swap file :p everything in linux is a file
