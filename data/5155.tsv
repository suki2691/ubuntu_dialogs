2012-04-20T22:21:00.000Z	angels		is there a way to turn off the joined and quit notifications in this room?
2012-04-20T22:21:00.000Z	K1rk|Work	angels	That would be a feature of your IRC client, not of the channel.
2012-04-20T22:22:00.000Z	angels	Atlantic777	and K1rk|Work - freenode. It is web based and the only one I know. Is there a better one?
2012-04-20T22:23:00.000Z	K1rk|Work	angels	There's a ton of IRC clients... I personally like xchat, konversation, and irssi.
