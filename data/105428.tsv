2010-11-01T00:48:00.000Z	willemb	ActionParsnip	  its not like the machine doesn't know it should have wireless, the 'bonding' just always times out
2010-11-01T00:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	willemb	see if there are bugs or a driver update that fixes it. I suggest you use a wired connection to get fully updated
