2005-10-24T07:05:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	ubuntunewbie2	it will only tell you that it WILL have to remove it if you do actually *need* to. in Windows' case, it's not even sure.

2005-10-24T07:39:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	ubuntunewbie2	it depends what it wants to drag down with it - what packages are you trying to remove?
