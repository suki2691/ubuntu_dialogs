2007-10-31T21:08:00.000Z	darthmarth37|Wk		Is the Ubuntu installer a package available in apt?
2007-10-31T21:10:00.000Z	darthmarth37|Wk		I'm essentially trying to put the livecd on a hard disk for a machine with no CD drive and no PXE boot capability.
2007-10-31T21:10:00.000Z	darthmarth37|Wk		Any way to do that?  All I really need is to be able to boot and run the installer from a hard disk.
