2007-01-02T12:29:00.000Z	enigma32	arrenlex	what is audacity 1.3.0+ using instead of wxwidgets?
2007-01-02T12:29:00.000Z	arrenlex	enigma32	I'm going to go out on a limb and say it uses gtk2 directly, just like a normal gnome program. Please, please don't quote me on that.
2007-01-02T12:30:00.000Z	enigma32	arrenlex	thanks. maybe I'll look more into it.
