2009-09-08T13:09:00.000Z	krdyt		any ideas how i could install thunderbird into a trucrypt container, and then copy my settings and profiles over to that container?
2009-09-08T13:11:00.000Z	alazar_	krdyt	you could get the source and compile it there
2009-09-08T13:13:00.000Z	krdyt	alazar_	you mean download the thunderbird pack, unzip and make file then copy ./mozilla.thunderbird dir?
2009-09-08T13:14:00.000Z	alazar_	krdyt	yeah, although i'm not sure about the settings
