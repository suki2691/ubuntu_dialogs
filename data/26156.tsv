2010-09-14T02:52:00.000Z	coffee412		I will be installing ubuntu 10.04 to a customers computer. Any real reason not to install 64bit and doing 32 bit for it?
2010-09-14T02:53:00.000Z	Emanon	coffee412	32 is a little more compatible for now

2010-09-14T02:53:00.000Z	coffee412	Emanon	Thank you very much. I was leaning the 32 bit way but wanted to be sure.
