2007-02-11T06:20:00.000Z	clacker		does the ext2/3 thing really make a big difference?
2007-02-11T06:21:00.000Z	variant	clacker	yes, 3 has a journal and 2 does not
2007-02-11T06:21:00.000Z	variant	clacker	for certain devices it's pointless like usb disks etc (improve the reliability of the data if you dont use a journal on a usb disk too)
