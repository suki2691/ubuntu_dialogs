2010-12-23T02:41:00.000Z	abli		Hi! I am upgrading a server that I don't have physical access to, and after the upgrade, I am supposed to reboot it. The problem is that it doesn't want to reboot, ie. after giving the 'reboot' command, the "The system is going down for reboot NOW!" line is printed, but nothing happens. The machine keeps on running and doesn't go down for a reboot. Any idea what might be causing this?
