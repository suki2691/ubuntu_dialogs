2011-07-13T06:08:00.000Z	madsailor		I'm dual booting ubuntu and win7.  If I mount the windows partition under ubuntu and delete some files will windows know that those files have been deleted when it boots next time, or will the OS not recognize that the files were deleted and still reserve space on disk for them

2011-07-13T06:11:00.000Z	rad_sci_guy	madsailor	i'm pretty sure.  I haven't removed huge amounts of files mind you.
