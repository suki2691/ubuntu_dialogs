2007-09-08T13:08:00.000Z	splitfish		I'm attempting to create a modular Ubuntu setup on my flash drive, installation goes smoothly and my only problem thus far is the booting/installation of a bootloader. (I don't wish to affect the MBR permanently on the host's computer.) Any advice is appreciated, thanks in advance.
2007-09-08T13:08:00.000Z	rambo3	splitfish	did you read !install
2007-09-08T13:11:00.000Z	splitfish	rambo3	what's in !install?  I've been consulting the online documentation and what has been provided with the liveCD, does !install have information directly related to my problem?
