2010-02-01T17:49:00.000Z	jack5463		I'm trying to play a dvd movie with movie player. I'm using unbuntu 9.10 from usb. A window appears saying " Totem cannot play this type of media (DVD) because it does not have the appropriate plugins to be able to read from the disc." how do i install the appropriate plugins?
