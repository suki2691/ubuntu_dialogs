2012-05-21T03:38:00.000Z	nydel	kuranta	tell me the problem
2012-05-21T03:39:00.000Z	kuranta	nydel	once I restarted after the update, the mouse and keyboard were no longer working properly, all icons were invisible or just white boxes with red x's, and the desktop background was solid blue.
2012-05-21T03:40:00.000Z	kuranta	nydel	I tried booting from an old kernel, and it solved some of the problems but made others worse
