2006-05-12T09:18:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		Basicly a Windows program can access Linux partitions, any ideas?
2006-05-12T09:18:00.000Z	NoobSauce	PrimoTurbo	I think it's called ext2fs or maybe ex2fs
2006-05-12T09:18:00.000Z	NoobSauce	PrimoTurbo	despite what the name might imply, you will be able to read ext2 and ext3 partitions with it
