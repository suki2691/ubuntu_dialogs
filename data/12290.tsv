2012-05-21T23:52:00.000Z	russjr08		Hi guys, quick question that I'm sure I'm overlooking but how do I give my self permission to view a mounted drive that I put in fstab? It seems only root can view it (I placed it in /media)

2012-05-21T23:53:00.000Z	zykotick9	russjr08	then adjust the permission on the mounted folder
