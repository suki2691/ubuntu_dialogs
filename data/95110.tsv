2008-04-18T09:50:00.000Z	tuntun		Hi, im tying to watch a flash video in firefox, i select to 'install missing plugin', but then its says it is already installed and it finishes. so i try to watch it, but then it starts all over again. What is going wrong here?
2008-04-18T09:51:00.000Z	harriseldon	tuntun	did you check about:plugins in firefox location bar to ensure flash is installed?
2008-04-18T09:52:00.000Z	tuntun	harriseldon	its not registered in about:plugins
2008-04-18T09:53:00.000Z	harriseldon	tuntun	then flash is not installed correctly
