2007-02-07T11:52:00.000Z	White_Lightning		!metacity
2007-02-07T11:53:00.000Z	White_Lightning		that's what I thought, so would I be right in saying that it seems most GTK themes have metacity themes imbedded in them? or at least part of them. because changing GTK themes ususally changes the window along with it
