2008-01-18T08:51:00.000Z	mattholimeau		on windows i currently have winscp with notepad++ integrated as an editor... i would guess that ubuntu comes with something like that

2008-01-18T08:57:00.000Z	mattholimeau	jrib	beautiful, thanks. i tried that before asking in here... just didn't bother think about syntax
