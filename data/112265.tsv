2009-10-28T14:35:00.000Z	gRnt		Hi all I have a quick question I am following a tutorial for my server install. One of the packages that is meant to be installed is libkadm55 however because this is a dated tutorial ubuntu says that the package no longer exists is anyone able to tell me how I can find an alternative if there is one?

2009-10-28T14:40:00.000Z	jrib	gRnt	what version of ubuntu are you using exactly?   That package exists in the latest ubuntu
