2009-02-12T06:28:00.000Z	jruss		Hi I have been with ubuntu for a while but I am an IRC noob, so please go easy on me. I am having a bizarre system failure and I have run out of ideas of how to track it down.
2009-02-12T06:28:00.000Z	jruss		I get a kernel panic at boot
2009-02-12T06:29:00.000Z	letalis	jruss	what was the last major change you made before the panic
2009-02-12T06:30:00.000Z	letalis	jruss	maybe a hardware issue if your system does it intermittantly
