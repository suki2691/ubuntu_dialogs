2011-06-17T13:24:00.000Z	Airris	llutz	what won't break anything ? I'm still not entirely sure what i'm supposed to be doing here. Trying to remove libjpeg62 and install libjpeg8c from source in commandline was the best idea i had. If something simplier would work that'd be great
2011-06-17T13:33:00.000Z	Airris	llutz	theadmin : just to make sure you two aren't disagreeing, so the checkinstall thing will work if i masquerade this new package as the old one's name?
2011-06-17T13:54:00.000Z	Airris	llutz	hmm. would dpkg know how to revert it if i uninstalled it afterwords?
2011-06-17T13:54:00.000Z	Airris	llutz	and there's a way to forcibly just reinstall the older package over itself if that doesnt work, right?
