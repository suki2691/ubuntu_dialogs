2007-05-10T09:54:00.000Z	`alex	MBChris	thanks. why does connecting with nautilus to ftp server wont work? It works for most of FTP servers but for "ftp://ftp.assyrianchurch.com.au" it just doesnt, can anyone test it in some random FTP program and see if it gives answer back? i get "site down or osmething like that"
