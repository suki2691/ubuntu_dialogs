2009-01-31T10:10:00.000Z	Delvien	ryanprior	Was that necessary?
2009-01-31T10:11:00.000Z	ryanprior	Delvien	There actually is a file somewhere that you can touch or echo 1 to or something that disables the system beep on a kernel level. I forgot what it was though, and hated myself a little, so I lashed out at you. =P
