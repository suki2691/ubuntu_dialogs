2008-06-18T23:09:00.000Z	lohung		greetings...I'm upgrading to 8.04 using the alternate CD; why is it still downloading pkgs from the 'net? (using the CD because downloading was slow in the first place)
2008-06-18T23:09:00.000Z	RAdams	lohung	so you get hte latest version. the cd isn't updated every time a post-release update comes out.
2008-06-18T23:15:00.000Z	lohung	RAdams	thanks...do you know if it's possible to set the download mirror?
