2009-08-06T16:58:00.000Z	ake_		hello people, I just upgraded to jaunty and everything seems to function as usual except for firefox and epiphany. When I start these applications I get an error line that looks like this: \n /usr/lib/firefox-3.0.13/firefox: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/xulrunner-1.9.0.13/libxul.so: undefined symbol: PR_GetPhysicalMemorySize
2009-08-06T16:59:00.000Z	ake_		does anyone know the problem?
