2006-11-19T09:57:00.000Z	vnDW		is there a way I can get a REAL root on ubuntu?
2006-11-19T09:57:00.000Z	ashika	vnDW	you mean like no gnome or KDE?
2006-11-19T09:57:00.000Z	vnDW	ashika	no, teh root user...I can't access it, I can't do apt-get dist-upgrade, I can't interact with sudo commands
2006-11-19T09:58:00.000Z	ashika	vnDW	use sudo -i or login with root as your user. Did you set the root password?
