2010-12-23T04:43:00.000Z	Livin4Jesus		I need some help... When I run "sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl", a error comes up saying "E: Unable to locate package xserver-xgl". :/ Anyone know how to solve this?
2010-12-23T04:45:00.000Z	Livin4Jesus		Well, I'm trying to get my nVidia graphics card to work, so I can use the Desktop Effects, but when I try to do it, it says "Desktop Effects could not be enabled", so that's why I'm trying to install XGL. :/
2010-12-23T04:46:00.000Z	Livin4Jesus		I'm trying to follow this guide: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=580748&highlight=install+compiz  , but like I said above, it's not working. :/
