2009-09-01T02:21:00.000Z	wildmadsci		I have used and installed Ubuntu numerous times, but recently I installed it on my family's home computer. It appears that when multiple users are logged on, even if they are not running any processes, the computer occasionally slows to a crawl. Switching users also is buggy, either taking a long time, or hangs on a black screen, or apparently (according to my sister) the desktop background for half the screen.
2009-09-01T02:21:00.000Z	wildmadsci		Does anyone have any ideas why this is so?
