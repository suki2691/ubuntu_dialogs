2010-02-02T14:05:00.000Z	jleeperry		Hi everyone. I've got an ftp question. Is there anyone in here familiar with FileApp?
2010-02-02T14:05:00.000Z	ikonia	jleeperry	just ask your real question
2010-02-02T14:06:00.000Z	ikonia	jleeperry	if you can't ftp to something - it's either not running ftp, it's on a different port
2010-02-02T14:07:00.000Z	ikonia	jleeperry	that suggests it's not an ftp at the other end
