2006-12-11T11:31:00.000Z	flankk		Ubuntu 6.10 is shutting down my PC at random intervals due to ACPI reporting a false temperature.  When I set "acpi=off" in my Grub menu.lst, my keyboard and mouse freezes on GDM.  I have had this problem for months and am ready to leave Ubuntu if it's really this unstable.
