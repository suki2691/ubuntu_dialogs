2006-09-19T16:16:00.000Z	micahcowan	soniXX	yes, I believe the mailing list is ubuntu-legal.
2006-09-19T16:17:00.000Z	micahcowan	soniXX	then again, I could be wrong. Can't find it on the wiki... but I thought I'd heard of it...
2006-09-19T16:19:00.000Z	micahcowan	soniXX	I can't find much on it in Google, either, so I must be wrong.
