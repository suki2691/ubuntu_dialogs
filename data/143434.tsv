2011-04-19T22:36:00.000Z	ee99ee		I'm trying to learn how to configure NFS replicas to support distributed file system with NFS failover and cross-datacenter replication on Ubuntu... anyone have any pointers for how to get started?

2011-04-19T22:39:00.000Z	ee99ee	Seven_Six_Two	more specifically, steps to configure this on Ubuntu... rather than how it should be implimented, as would be defined in such a standard
2011-04-19T22:40:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	ee99ee	fair enough.
