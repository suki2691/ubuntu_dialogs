2009-02-16T09:06:00.000Z	joobie		is there another location for the network configs apart from interfaces file that coiuld be bringing the int up?
2009-02-16T09:07:00.000Z	n8tuser	joobie	-> interfaces file does not bring up the interfaces
2009-02-16T09:08:00.000Z	joobie	n8tuser	where would it define to use eth0 as dhcp?
2009-02-16T09:09:00.000Z	n8tuser	joobie	-> in the interfaces file, but perhaps a new rule can be added via udev
