2008-12-30T15:30:00.000Z	amerinese_	dns53	i guess i'm not really familiar with that
2008-12-30T15:33:00.000Z	dns53	amerinese_	https://launchpad.net/ is the bug tracking system used for ubuntu, try and find the application name and see if anyone has submitted a bug report for it, if it's a new issue include as much info as you can so it is easier to track down the bug
