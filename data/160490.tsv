2009-04-02T00:43:00.000Z	Lego_Dan		Um, I just burned the ISO for 8.10 (with imgburn) it reads the cd like it wants to boot it but then brings up the freebsd boot manager.. and if i don't let it boot from the hdd, i get an insert boot media error
2009-04-02T00:44:00.000Z	Lego_Dan		there is only so many options for the boot order... and bsd/windows cds boot fine.. even memtest
2009-04-02T00:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lego_Dan	Do you have FreeBSD installed?
2009-04-02T00:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Lego_Dan	Did you verify the disk burned correctly and can you boot from other CD's ?
