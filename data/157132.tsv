2007-11-21T11:03:00.000Z	MasterShrek	geoaxis	it is possible, some routers have static dhcp
2007-11-21T11:04:00.000Z	geoaxis	MasterShrek	 i am implying that is it possible that particualr IP cannot be assigned by hand to other systems
2007-11-21T11:04:00.000Z	MasterShrek	geoaxis	not sure exactly, not much of a networker
