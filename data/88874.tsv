2008-06-01T11:24:00.000Z	Priest		Is there a way to tell terminal that I want to run each command with sudo until exit? Or do I need to type sudo each time?
2008-06-01T11:25:00.000Z	SirAlexander	Priest	 Type "sudo bash".  Then it's basically like you're root until you type "exit".
2008-06-01T11:26:00.000Z	SirAlexander		There are more ways than those two too.
2008-06-01T11:26:00.000Z	Priest	SirAlexander	Flannel: Thanks. I only need to do it for the next five commands, then I'll restart terminal. I know not to run it constantly. =P Not unless I want someone to kick me out of the loop.
