2007-07-06T16:43:00.000Z	Ltar		what is the function of rebooting twice? I've found that failing to do so leaves the drive broken to linux. also, is there any way I could increase the survivability of the drive, while writing to it from linux? It seems to encounter an I/O error after about 4 gigs have been transferred to it.
