2010-05-14T12:44:00.000Z	kajo	theadmin	he told me to open gparted, and then I asked a question about what I was doing with it, and then he said don't open it. I didn't know if he was saying don't open my harddrive within gparted, or don't open the program, or what, or why.

2010-05-14T12:44:00.000Z	kajo	theadmin	it's not completely alien to hear people refer to accessing files as 'opening' them, since you often click an icon which looks like clicking an icon to open a program.
