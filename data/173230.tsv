2009-03-23T01:23:00.000Z	duffy		I love FF, its fast, its addons enhance it like no other, and as such, no other comes close
2009-03-23T01:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	duffy	well how about  Seamonkey?
2009-03-23T01:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	duffy	you can do add ons for Seamonkey etc.    and I hope you know about the link between Seamonkey and Firefox
