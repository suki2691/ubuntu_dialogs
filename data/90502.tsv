2008-09-06T05:54:00.000Z	bazz		the volume up/down buttons on my thinkpad don't seem to generate keypress/release events, just keymapnotify ones (according to xev).  i can map it to a keyboard shortcut (XF86AudioRaiseVolume) in xfce, but it doesn't ever seem to execute the shortcut.  how do i fix this?
