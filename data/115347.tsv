2007-10-24T21:17:00.000Z	mumrah		I am on a laptop with an intel graphics card, the laptop has a widescreen display, and i want to enable a secondary display that is not widescreen. the xorg configure utility (preferences->screen and graphics) will not allow me to enable a secondary screen. here is my xorg.conf http://pastebin.com/d7371f19e thanks!
