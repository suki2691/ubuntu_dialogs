2010-08-17T03:02:00.000Z	headkase314	insulina_	do you have the needed -dev packages installed?
2010-08-17T03:04:00.000Z	insulina_	headkase314	I think I do, it just says glut ...
2010-08-17T03:05:00.000Z	headkase314	insulina_	if the package is called "glut" then you need to install another package called "glut-dev" to go along with it for compiling.  Beyond this tip there is not much help I can offer.
