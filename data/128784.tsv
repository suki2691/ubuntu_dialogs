2007-07-06T06:34:00.000Z	Bartzy		I have a windows XP installation. I want to install ubuntu in another partition. I have a SATA 250GB disk devided to 20GB (XP boot partition), 200GB for data (ntfs) and left about 10GB for ubuntu... I also have 80GB and 30GB NTFS IDE HD's. Anyways, in the 10GB of freespace in the 250GB hd, I added an ext3 partition for the root, and a swap partition. when I'm being asked to specify the device to install the boot loader to, what to enter ? :|
