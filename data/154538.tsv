2007-07-22T16:26:00.000Z	scorp123	JodiH	what do you need a firewall for?
2007-07-22T16:27:00.000Z	scorp123	JodiH	different than Windows most Linux distributions are not running any stupid + unsafe services that are open to the network and that would require a firewall in the first place ....
2007-07-22T16:28:00.000Z	scorp123	JodiH	if you want to hook up a small network to the internet it may be easier for you if you just bought one small router with built-in NAT and firewall features.
