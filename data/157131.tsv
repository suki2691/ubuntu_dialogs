2007-10-21T20:06:00.000Z	jdong	MasterShrek	why do you think a realtime kernel would help with desktop performance?
2007-10-21T20:06:00.000Z	jdong	MasterShrek	I mean it helps with audio latency and other forms of instant response-times, but overall a -rt kernel is slower than a standard one in the big picture
2007-10-21T20:06:00.000Z	MasterShrek	jdong	i dont know, i think a low-latency kernel is better
