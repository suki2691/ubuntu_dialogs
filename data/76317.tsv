2009-07-31T19:58:00.000Z	LjL	aboSamoor	you could use xargs, i suppose. how was the list generated, what exactly does it contain?
2009-07-31T19:59:00.000Z	aboSamoor	LjL	it is generated by dpkg --get-selections
2009-07-31T19:59:00.000Z	LjL	aboSamoor	in that case, you need to use dpkg --set-selections
