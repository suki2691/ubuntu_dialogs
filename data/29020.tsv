2010-07-15T02:39:00.000Z	amit08		hi I am trying to ping my router or any other website from my linux box running on Vbox on windows, bt with error : "bad address" .. what could be the problem?
2010-07-15T02:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amit08	 can it actually get to the web sites in a browser?
2010-07-15T02:40:00.000Z	amit08	Dr_Willis	yes it can .. actually I am running IRC on the same linux box.
2010-07-15T02:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	amit08	 sounds like the router mauy be blocking things.. or vboxc's network config is
