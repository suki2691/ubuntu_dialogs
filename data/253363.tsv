2007-05-03T14:40:00.000Z	samushka		but, how can i remove JUST gaim? (im guessing its an apt-get command)
2007-05-03T14:40:00.000Z	poningru	samushka	you can do apt-get remove gaim but that will take out ubuntu-desktop
2007-05-03T14:44:00.000Z	poningru	samushka	just make sure that you add it when you are updating!
