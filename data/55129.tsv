2010-01-17T21:46:00.000Z	adversarian		Hello. I'm back again. I checked the hash and checked the disc integrity (burned a new one), and that went fine. But when I load the LiveCD, choosing install or try without changing doesn't go anywhere. It just freezes after the logo glows for a few minutes.
2010-01-17T21:46:00.000Z	adversarian		There aren't any messages.
2010-01-17T21:48:00.000Z	adversarian		Where do I put that in? Do I have to boot and choose terminal?
