2008-04-19T14:52:00.000Z	foo-nix	magnetron	I shut down kmix and swapped amarok to alsa, now music is playing, only it can not be heard.
2008-04-19T14:53:00.000Z	foo-nix	magnetron	but esound is a framework just like alsa, wont they conflict?
2008-04-19T14:53:00.000Z	magnetron	foo-nix	they won't conflict if you set esound to use alsa
