2012-10-09T07:39:00.000Z	grumpy		Hello everyone... I hope someone knows the answer to this cause I don't. I should say that I'm new to Linux so not knowing is not a news flash. I have been working on this for 3 days now and have had no success and going crazy. I have a new DVD that plays in my DVD player in vmware running mythbuntu but it won't play in mplayer or vlc. Vlc both open and close immediately.
2012-10-09T07:40:00.000Z	grumpy		I have installed Ubuntu's restricted extras, ffmpeg, mencoder, Medibuntu repository including libdvdcss2 and bdvdnav4, lilibdvdread4, gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad, and gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly. But still nothing
2012-10-09T07:41:00.000Z	grumpy		no error with mplayer it justs opens and closes
