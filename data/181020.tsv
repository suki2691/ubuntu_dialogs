2006-10-16T15:40:00.000Z	cryptonic		might do it under windows and then, finally install ubuntu
2006-10-16T15:40:00.000Z	SeanTater	cryptonic	I imagine it can be problematic, it just got write capability
2006-10-16T15:40:00.000Z	SeanTater	cryptonic	but it's possible, there are utilities for it, AFAIK
