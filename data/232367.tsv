2010-10-11T02:04:00.000Z	siberius3		hey, I'm trying to get my linksys ae1000 to work with ubuntu 10.10, and well, it doesn't.
2010-10-11T02:04:00.000Z	siberius3		It worked with 10.04, in fact I'm on 10.04 with it now on a different computer.
2010-10-11T02:04:00.000Z	siberius3		What do I do? Ndiswrapper doesn't and traditionally hasn't worked with it, and the Ralink driver won't compile correctly.
2010-10-11T02:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	siberius3	what chip? most ralink chips work ok with free drivers
