2009-12-29T07:20:00.000Z	Chakravanti		Can I get Ext4 support on 8.10?  What's the best way?  e2fsprogs syas it has ext4 support but when I try to mount an ext4 HD from the live CD it says my system does not support the format and I'm a little confused.

2009-12-29T07:22:00.000Z	edbian	Chakravanti	It already does in 9.10
2009-12-29T07:22:00.000Z	Chakravanti	edbian	okay, i was kinda hoping 9.04 has it because I have a 9.04 CD but not a 9.10 =P
