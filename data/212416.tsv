2010-09-21T23:24:00.000Z	syli725	erUSUL	thanks for the reply. I just don't like gnome-shell. it looks very weird to me. It doesn't look like a desktop manager anymore. That's why I am asking this question. If gnome3 will look like gnome-shell, I am thinking to switch to kde4.

2010-09-21T23:29:00.000Z	syli725	erUSUL	ok, thanks. I was just wondering how gnome3 will look like. it's very hard to find this infomation by googling.
