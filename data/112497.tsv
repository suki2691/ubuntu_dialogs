2007-12-01T12:26:00.000Z	Weng	dns53	Newer kernel
2007-12-01T12:29:00.000Z	Weng	dns53	Now that I really think about it, the best course is probably going to be to go build the drivers by hand and hack the makefile's "check to make sure this goon actually has an nVidia card" to recognize my one-off video chip's dev id
