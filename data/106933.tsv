2008-01-08T18:04:00.000Z	db-keen		I am trying to set up a general repository for programs written in Ruby, which may or may not have extensions requiring system-dependent compilation, but I don't see any point in having separate distribution folders. Why should dependencies be different from Debian stable to Ubuntu Gutsy to Ubuntu Feisty?
2008-01-08T18:05:00.000Z	Pici	db-keen	Because the packages arent necessarily named the same across distributions
2008-01-08T18:06:00.000Z	db-keen	Pici	is it common for packages to change names?
2008-01-08T18:07:00.000Z	Pici	db-keen	Certantly across from debian to ubuntu, yes.
