2007-06-04T09:45:00.000Z	dgt84	dxdemetriou	a normal DVD should hold 4.3 GiB of files and I think the normal limit is 1024MiB per file depending on the filesystem you use
2007-06-04T09:46:00.000Z	dxdemetriou	dgt84	I know about the limitations, is that the reason I try to use something for only udf writing and not mixed with iso
2007-06-04T09:47:00.000Z	dgt84	dxdemetriou	oh okay, alternatively you could use split to break up the files if that's possible (not sure what you are trying to store and if it can be split up)
