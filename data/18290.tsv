2012-10-04T20:56:00.000Z	fidel	tomasm-	what kernel version do you currently use? terminal: uname -a
2012-10-04T20:57:00.000Z	tomasm-	fidel	3.2.0-31 .... but a post last month about my wireless glitch said it wont be backported to anything earlier than 3.7 .... i just got 12.04 installed and it seems like the kernel is a bit behind
2012-10-04T20:58:00.000Z	fidel	tomasm-	1 possible option might be using a ppa
2012-10-04T21:00:00.000Z	tomasm-	fidel	hmmm, i see 3.6.0 on kernel.ubuntu.com , but i'm not sure how to get a ppa set up
