2008-11-28T14:48:00.000Z	harvey		Hey guys. Can anyone help me. Ive just upgrade to 8.10 got the usual problems, I love Ubuntu but I've had enough, does anyone know where I can just pay to get some support and just have someone fix my laptop for me. (Movies dont play, screen resolution is messed up.) Thanks in advance.
