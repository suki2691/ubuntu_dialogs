2008-08-31T07:49:00.000Z	mcquaid		my router broke and i'm using this other router that only has 1 nic port so I hooked it up to an old hub I have so I can hook up my other computers
2008-08-31T07:50:00.000Z	mcquaid		i noticed a fair bit of degradation on the network, not massive but noticeable
2008-08-31T07:50:00.000Z	mcquaid		i read that hubs only operate at half duplex.  should I force all my nics to half duplex?
2008-08-31T07:50:00.000Z	phantomcircuit	mcquaid	the problem is the hub
