2012-07-29T12:13:00.000Z	soulstitchmmo		Ok this might be more than an ubuntu irc question, but I have 3 script I want to run, however they each require a different terminal window. Can I run a script that calls all 3 other scripts and opens up the terminals for them?
2012-07-29T12:13:00.000Z	soulstitchmmo		I did not know that existed.
2012-07-29T12:13:00.000Z	soulstitchmmo		Thank you
2012-07-29T12:15:00.000Z	timfrost	soulstitchmmo	why do the scripts each need a separate terminal window?
