2011-04-29T08:27:00.000Z	mordof	rgoytacaz	apparently mine are working.. i don't know
2011-04-29T08:28:00.000Z	mordof	rgoytacaz	it tells me that they're installed but inactive in the additional drivers, but my nvidia x server settings tool works
2011-04-29T08:29:00.000Z	mordof	rgoytacaz	saying the same thing to me.. and my desktop performance is sluggish, so i'm not sure what's happening with mine
