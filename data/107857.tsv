2008-01-03T00:49:00.000Z	zenobius	alex314	you need compizconfig-configurator
2008-01-03T00:50:00.000Z	zenobius	alex314	you need compizconfig-settings-manager
2008-01-03T00:51:00.000Z	zenobius	alex314	compizconfig-settings-manager & some extra plugins...then im pretty sure you can specify waht to do with waht window, failing that look at devilspie
