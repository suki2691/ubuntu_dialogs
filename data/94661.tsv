2008-04-15T07:11:00.000Z	Tyrosine		>> My audio isn't working!  It was working a few days ago...  My device looks normal in "alsamixer" (everything 100%, unmuted) and I don't get errors, I just can't hear sound! (laptop) - any ideas?
2008-04-15T07:12:00.000Z	Pelo	Tyrosine	anything special happened ?
2008-04-15T07:12:00.000Z	Tyrosine	Pelo	I installed a restricted video driver, but that's about it
2008-04-15T07:13:00.000Z	Pelo	Tyrosine	restricted driver is probably the problem
