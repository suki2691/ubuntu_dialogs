2012-09-29T19:07:00.000Z	PapaSierra		i don't understand the implication of choosing libcurl4-gnutls-dev over libcurl4-openssl-dev, any ideas?
2012-09-29T19:08:00.000Z	gordonjcp	PapaSierra	why has this question arisen?
2012-09-29T19:08:00.000Z	PapaSierra	gordonjcp	simply because i'm installing pecl_http and it requires curl.h which is available in either of those two. so it's a straight choice between them?
