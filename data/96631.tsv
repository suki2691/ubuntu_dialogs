2009-08-28T01:45:00.000Z	Strife89		Hello, I'm having an issue with using multiple monitors. The first time I tried to attach a CRT to my laptop, I went to Preferences -> Display, and tried to turn on the CRT. However, "Monitor Resolution Settings detected that the virtual resolution must be set in [my] configuration file ... to apply the settings." When I gave it the go-ahead, my screen resolutions went haywire.
2009-08-28T01:46:00.000Z	Strife89		I was unable to put my screen resolution back to normal, and ended up reinstalling Ubuntu. Any ideas what happened, and how I can make it work properly?
