2005-04-27T07:44:00.000Z	Kouros		Hello!
2005-04-27T07:45:00.000Z	Kouros		I'm using the Live CD at the moment, but no sound support - is that normal?
2005-04-27T07:47:00.000Z	Kouros		That's fine then - I didn't want to go the full hog (Hoary, natch) and find no sound. If it's just a LIve CD issue, I'm OK with it
2005-04-27T07:48:00.000Z	elcu	Kouros	how are you finding ubuntu?
