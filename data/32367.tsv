2010-05-28T08:14:00.000Z	acerimmer_		Lucid Window Controls vanish on LOGIN.  I reinstalled the metacity packages with synaptic.  No fix.  I have to go to Appearances and re-enable Visual Effects but that only works until next login.  Any ideas?

2010-05-28T08:16:00.000Z	acerimmer_	greezmunkey	yeah, i've got great sound but had to change settings for my headset.  NOW i have to reconfigure to get speakers back
