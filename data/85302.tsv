2008-12-01T20:34:00.000Z	fudus9		the monitor definately isn't receiving a signal because it is going into power saving mode
2008-12-01T20:35:00.000Z	fudus9		it only does that when the computer is off or it tells it to go active-off
2008-12-01T20:35:00.000Z	ConstantineXVI	fudus9	or it's getting a signal the monitor can't hande
