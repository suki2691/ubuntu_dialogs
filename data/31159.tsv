2010-08-18T06:38:00.000Z	IdeAleSs		I need a simple image editing tool for my wife.  Something like irfanview.  Is there anything like that for ubuntu?
2010-08-18T06:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	IdeAleSs	 thats more of an image viewer.. what editing tasks are you doing?
2010-08-18T06:39:00.000Z	IdeAleSs	Dr_Willis	Resizing and minor color adjustment.
2010-08-18T06:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	IdeAleSs	 check the package manager. thers some image editing tools  and viewers that may do those.. Irvanview does work in Wine.
