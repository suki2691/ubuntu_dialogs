I can tell it to connect manually, and it connects, but not automatically at boot! I installed some packages, and it stopped working, can't figure out what.

2007-01-16T16:44:00.000Z	mnoir	katabatic	but when it was installed, did you mark the interface for dhcp?
2007-01-16T16:48:00.000Z	mnoir	katabatic	did you see my question?
