2010-07-07T03:01:00.000Z	MysteryX		Can I install a 64-bit Ubuntu inside a VMWare which runs on a 32-bit Ubuntu host?
2010-07-07T03:01:00.000Z	PaulM	MysteryX	you should be able to
2010-07-07T03:01:00.000Z	PaulM	MysteryX	It won't necessarily be particularly efficient though
2010-07-07T03:02:00.000Z	MysteryX	PaulM	Thanx
