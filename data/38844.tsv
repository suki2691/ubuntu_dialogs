2010-08-17T07:21:00.000Z	saxon		I've got a problem with Wubi.  When I try to load Ubuntu, it takes me to a limited GRUBonDOS menu, and I don't know how to load Ubuntu from there.
2010-08-17T07:22:00.000Z	urlwallace	saxon	does the menu list 2 boot options?
2010-08-17T07:24:00.000Z	urlwallace	saxon	what version of windows?
2010-08-17T07:28:00.000Z	urlwallace	saxon	I know I had problems with Vista and wubi but not with win 7.  If you havnt uninstsalled the wubi from windows and reinstalled ubuntu with wubi sory I dont know beyond that
