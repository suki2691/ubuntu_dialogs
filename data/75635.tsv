2011-03-24T18:33:00.000Z	ks07		hey all, I'm having some problems with a remote dedicated server - it will not boot. However, I do have access to a recovery system and all the files - any idea where I should begin looking for problems?

2011-03-24T18:35:00.000Z	ruan	ks07	syslog maybe
2011-03-24T18:37:00.000Z	ruan	ks07	also kern.log, messages, and user.log
