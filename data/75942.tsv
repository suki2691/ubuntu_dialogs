2011-03-30T15:28:00.000Z	saruji		Hello, I am have a question.  Attempting to install ubuntu 10.10 on top of win7, however ubuntu installer only see's my 2nd hard drive (D: in windows)  I partitioned my first drive in windows (C:) to have free unpartitioned space, however it does not show up in the ubuntu installer.  Any ideas?  Thanks for any input

2011-03-30T15:30:00.000Z	saruji	YankDownUnder	I go through the manual partitioning instead, however the drive does not appear there?  Is it possible that win7 wrote MBR to the 2nd drive and install itself on the 1st?
