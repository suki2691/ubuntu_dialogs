2005-09-08T09:10:00.000Z	misterdiff		i'm having problems playing mp3 files with rhythmbox. i've got a pretty big collection of mp3s and xmms just will not due for playing my jukebox. everytime i try to import something to rhythmbox it says it has no plugin for mp3
2005-09-08T09:10:00.000Z	misterdiff		anyone know a fix for this?
