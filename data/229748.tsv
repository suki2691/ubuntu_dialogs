2006-03-16T14:30:00.000Z	Marlun		I'll write about my problem again so anyone can help me. I'm on a server-install and the terminal is not using the whole height of my screen. It only uses half, positioned in the middle. I was told to press "e" at boot prompt and add "vga=normal" but when clicking "e" I'm given a list of choices first (root, kernel, initrd, savedefault, boot) what should I edit?
