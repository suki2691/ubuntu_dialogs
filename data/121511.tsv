2009-03-28T07:54:00.000Z	jamiejackson		creating a usb startup disk from ubuntu, and it seems to only want a fat32 partition. won't it install to a ext2?
2009-03-28T07:54:00.000Z	kitche	jamiejackson	it might install to an image that isolinux will boot from
2009-03-28T07:55:00.000Z	jamiejackson	kitche	i let it do its thing on the stick the first go round (while the stick was still factory formatted to win32), wouldn't boot tho
2009-03-28T07:57:00.000Z	kitche	jamiejackson	it might install to ext3 though I never looked into linux usb booting myself since I don't use usb booting
