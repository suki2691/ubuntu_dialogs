2009-06-03T23:22:00.000Z	Slart	crankharder	in the machine settings I think you can set the network card to use NAT or similar
2009-06-03T23:25:00.000Z	crankharder	Slart	I selected that and still cannot connect
2009-06-03T23:26:00.000Z	Slart	crankharder	then I don't know what to say.. that works for my vm's
