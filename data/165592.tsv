2006-10-05T10:26:00.000Z	rockstar_		Can anyone point me to a fglrx install howto that's worth a damn?  This is MUCH harder to install than it is on debian... I thought it was supposed to be backwards

2006-10-05T10:28:00.000Z	rockstar_	beefsprocket	Do you really think it's a good idea to mix the packages like that?
2006-10-05T10:29:00.000Z	beefsprocket	rockstar_	I've done that on a 64bit dapper install, no problems, have to grab a few libraries, not much work though
