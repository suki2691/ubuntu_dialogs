That means that it's not normally supported here, though your question about using apps purchased via Software Center in other Distributions without re-purchasing is something I'd still consider on-topic for this channel. Unfortunately my guess is that you won't find anyone here who knows much about how purchasing from Software Center works.
2012-06-05T03:57:00.000Z	c_smith	Jordan_U	thanks for the info, yeah, I would like to see if there is something I need to do with the USC to get purchases working in a spin/derivative that it isn't included in.
