2012-10-23T17:18:00.000Z	BlackNarcissus		Hello everyone. Anyone else using jabber.org for XMPP messaging with empathy on Ubuntu 12.04 is having a certificate expired warning when logging in ?
2012-10-23T17:19:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	BlackNarcissus	I'm not using jabber, but I'd imagine they'll be updating their certificate shortly.
2012-10-23T17:21:00.000Z	BlackNarcissus	PatrickDickey	Yes, but I wonder if it's not a bug with empathy, it has a history of messing up with certificate, and jabber.org hasn't notified any certificate updates. Thanks :)
2012-10-23T17:23:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	BlackNarcissus	no problem, and sorry for not replying sooner.
