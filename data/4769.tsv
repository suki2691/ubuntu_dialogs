2012-03-09T00:30:00.000Z	helo__		hello, I am trying to modify my partitions and can't figure out how to move my linux partition. Current layout is 205GiB unallocated, then a 25 GiB extended partition with the EXT and swap in it. How can I move the OS to the beginning of the drive? (remnant of when Windows was at the beginning)
