2009-06-25T04:05:00.000Z	eternal_p		afternoon all..quick question, how can I change the default command line ftp client to NOT use FTP (without having to type passive) after login)
2009-06-25T04:07:00.000Z	rww	eternal_p	you want it to always use passive FTP? "ftp -p"
2009-06-25T04:07:00.000Z	rww	eternal_p	or "pftp"
2009-06-25T04:07:00.000Z	eternal_p	rww	it seems to always default to passive mode, I want to connect without passive mode
