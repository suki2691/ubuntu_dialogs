2008-07-16T01:26:00.000Z	leftyfb	localgod11	if you haven't installed a firewall, ubuntu isn't blocking any ports
2008-07-16T01:26:00.000Z	localgod11	leftyfb	 i thought all ports were clsoe unless opened by an app
2008-07-16T01:26:00.000Z	leftyfb	localgod11	no. There's no firewall installed/enabled by default
