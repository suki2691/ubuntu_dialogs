2008-02-17T10:22:00.000Z	elsha		i dont remember there being an enable networking checkbox. i'm not in the same room as the computer so it's a bit difficult for me to go check
2008-02-17T10:22:00.000Z	elsha		the only option that's coming up is modem connection
2008-02-17T10:23:00.000Z	Jangari	elsha	is there a network cable connected?
