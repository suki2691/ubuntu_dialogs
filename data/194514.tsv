2007-02-19T13:41:00.000Z	solid_liq		oh, after using gentoo for about 1.5-2 years is when I got sick of it, heheh
2007-02-19T13:42:00.000Z	skar	solid_liq	i too dumped gentoo after 2 years, switched to ubuntu for desktop, though for servers with exotics libds and development, no beating gentoo with its source based installs and use flags
2007-02-19T13:43:00.000Z	solid_liq	skar	nah, I switched to debian for the servers, more reliable, faster, more stable.  seriously, the packages built for debian are usually built by the project leads themselves, so they're built very well
