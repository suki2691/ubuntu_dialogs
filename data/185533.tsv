2006-09-26T05:51:00.000Z	Cyberai		hey, I am running Dapper with a radeon 9200 video card and an Acer 19" widescreen LCD. My LCD supports 1440x900 as it's best native resolution, but when I set my resolution to that I get very dark weird color. I have to go down to 1280x768 to get anything useable. I tried doing a sudo dpkg reconfig on xorg but no luck.
2006-09-26T05:51:00.000Z	Cyberai		does anyone have any insight on this problem?
2006-09-26T05:52:00.000Z	fredl	Cyberai	you know you're on the newest but you need to look which one you're using?
2006-09-26T05:53:00.000Z	Cyberai	fredl	I ran sudo upgrade
