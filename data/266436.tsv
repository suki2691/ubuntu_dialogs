2010-01-24T09:58:00.000Z	Vladimir_		Hello everyone! I'm going to try Ubuntu and wanted to know how it performs as far as BitTorrent in concerned. Is Transmission a good, stable BT client/? Will I have problems with bandwidth/firewall limitations or issues?

2010-01-24T09:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Vladimir_	 it depends on what extra features you need.
2010-01-24T09:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Vladimir_	 ive been using qTorrent lately - it works very well for me
