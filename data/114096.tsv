2008-11-25T06:39:00.000Z	DarkKnight		zsquareplusc; i have faced enough problems with intrepid
2008-11-25T06:39:00.000Z	amirman	DarkKnight	i had some problems after upgrading, so i just installed intrepid from scratch, you may want to try that
2008-11-25T06:43:00.000Z	amirman	DarkKnight	i just copied my entire home directory to an external drive, that worked fine for me, you have to reinstall your apps but all your settings and stuff are store in hidden folders and files in home so once you reinstall the apps they'll be there
