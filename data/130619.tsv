2007-09-05T11:39:00.000Z	Nicark	taime1	what other resolutions do you want?
2007-09-05T11:40:00.000Z	taime1	Nicark	i want 1600x1200 and under, but i have listed them all, and now im trying it with just one listed. but no matter what i do, i only get 800x600
2007-09-05T11:42:00.000Z	Nicark	taime1	did you tried by writing those modes in your xorg.conf ?   Modes   "1680x1050" "1280x1024" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
