2009-08-17T23:42:00.000Z	guntbert		how can I prevent my panel applets to get mixed/moved when I change the resolution/orientation of my desktop? or: how can I restore *my* panel once its been messed up?

2009-08-17T23:44:00.000Z	guntbert	trevorj	ok, I'll try that, thanx
2009-08-17T23:58:00.000Z	guntbert	trevorj	the locking of all applets helped - thx again
