2012-09-18T01:35:00.000Z	ironhalik		Is there any way to get better MTP support under Ubuntu 12.04? Currently, my Android phone takes about 30 seconds to connect to my Ubuntu box, and after that, I get 3MBps of thoughput at most. This is compared quite low compared to Windows 7 laptop that mounts my Gnex ~instantly, and offers ~12MBps of throughput
