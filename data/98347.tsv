2008-04-07T08:19:00.000Z	amidaniel	f0rmat	What do you mean by optimize memory? You mean to optimize a single program or an entire os?
2008-04-07T08:21:00.000Z	f0rmat	amidaniel	the entire os
2008-04-07T08:24:00.000Z	amidaniel	f0rmat	That's not really possible to do unless you recompile all the programs on your system to be more memory efficient
