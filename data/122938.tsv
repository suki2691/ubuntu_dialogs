2009-01-01T02:11:00.000Z	DragonLotus		Hey, I'm having Sound Problems in Intrepid.  I followed the multimedia & video guide and apt-get'd a bunch of stuff.  Still no luck.  Is there a permission thing I could be overlooking?
2009-01-01T02:12:00.000Z	DragonLotus		I'm using the Intel HDA chipset on my Intel P45 Motherboard.  I don't know if I'm using pulse audio or not.  lazyPower, thanks for the repsonse.
