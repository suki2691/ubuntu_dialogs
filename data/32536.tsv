2010-05-04T17:39:00.000Z	kgrandis		can anyone recommend a top tier managed hosting provider that supports ubuntu?
2010-05-04T17:40:00.000Z	Jaelae	kgrandis	- most of the big ones seem to only do red hat and centos.  You could try to find one that will let you install your own distro
2010-05-04T17:40:00.000Z	Jaelae	kgrandis	- but yiou would have to rent the entire server
2010-05-04T17:41:00.000Z	kgrandis	Jaelae	yeah that's what we've found as well. We can do dedicated/unmanaged, but yeah I'm waiting for managed ubuntu.
