2009-12-02T03:32:00.000Z	squircle	Samuli^	while WTF is used to describe linux a lot (way too much, in my opinion), it's possible to replace that with other, more useful phrases :)
2009-12-02T03:32:00.000Z	Samuli^	squircle	sure.. I was just talking about acronyms. :P
2009-12-02T03:33:00.000Z	squircle	Samuli^	yeah, i get it. but WTF/noob, those kind of things are not in general alignment with the language rules (which I don't make)
