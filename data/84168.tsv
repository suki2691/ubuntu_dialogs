2008-07-29T21:07:00.000Z	energY		I installed a ubuntu package on my debian once, maybe I should try installing a mac package...
2008-07-29T21:08:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	energY	It doesn't work that way
2008-07-29T21:08:00.000Z	EvilDennisR	energY	..and it wouldn't work because the libraries are different
2008-07-29T21:09:00.000Z	energY	EvilDennisR	I know, ubuntu packages is useless. Messed up my system...
