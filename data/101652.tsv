2010-04-20T07:56:00.000Z	maginot	crankharder	you have a lot of problem trying that...
2010-04-20T07:56:00.000Z	maginot	crankharder	to start, how do you expected to receive emails on that box, second how do you expect to gmail handle your smtp forwards ?
2010-04-20T07:57:00.000Z	maginot	crankharder	well, I don't think you can, or at least you had to have more knowledge to understand what you want. Or B you make your question wrong.
