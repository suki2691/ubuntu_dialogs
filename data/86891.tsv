2008-07-27T04:01:00.000Z	plouffe		my audio card is not listed at alsa-project.org . What is the best way to go from here and can I use alsa at all? I know that I used alsamixer and it did affect my sound. But I keep getting sound problems. I'm confused.
2008-07-27T04:03:00.000Z	crimsun	plouffe	what's the issue?
2008-07-27T04:03:00.000Z	plouffe	crimsun	right now no sound on any application
2008-07-27T04:03:00.000Z	crimsun	plouffe	ok, I'll help in #ubuntu-audio-help
