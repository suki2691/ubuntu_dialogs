2008-01-07T00:22:00.000Z	pg	Xintruder	what do you mean by a battery being identical in two operating systems?
2008-01-07T00:23:00.000Z	Xintruder	pg	I think my laptop overheats faster with ubuntu, but can't verify that
2008-01-07T00:24:00.000Z	pg	Xintruder	that's possible.  If you have a dual boot, you can test the time it takes to discharge the battery in Windows and in Linux.
