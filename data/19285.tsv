2011-07-31T20:32:00.000Z	Stormx2		Hey - finally got around to installing 11.04 and theres some new kind of scrollbar in certain applications (pidgin etc) that's tiny and I can only use once I mouseover and wait for some slider to appear next to it. How can I get the old scrollbars back?
2011-07-31T20:33:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Stormx2	do you have a mouse wheel?
2011-07-31T20:33:00.000Z	Stormx2	ThinkT510	I do
2011-07-31T20:34:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Stormx2	does that work, i would have thought you wouldn't need to hover over the scrollbar
