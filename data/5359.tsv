2012-04-03T17:24:00.000Z	mi3		is it possible to merge all the iso into 1 single DVD? I want to merge ubuntu, ubuntu rescue and boot repair iso's into one sick DVD
2012-04-03T17:24:00.000Z	mi3		huh?
2012-04-03T17:24:00.000Z	Church	mi3	i'd dump dvd usage at all. usb keys are cheap and way easier
2012-04-03T17:26:00.000Z	mi3	Church	so what might be the estimated size required to merge the above ISO?
