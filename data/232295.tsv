2008-08-29T16:10:00.000Z	Malwir		how do I install the GIMP
2008-08-29T16:12:00.000Z	Malwir		what do I do if my GIMP has already lost its kernel support, should I reinstall the source????
2008-08-29T16:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	Malwir	sudo apt-get install gimp (but is installed by default afaik). Btw is almost impossible that a userspace app lost "kernel support"
2008-08-29T16:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	Malwir	whatever that means anyway
