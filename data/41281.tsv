2010-02-07T21:24:00.000Z	Eremite	EgOr	password and user name should be "root" I believe
2010-02-07T21:26:00.000Z	Eremite	EgOr	 have you just tried pressing Enter instead of entering a name and password?  Some linux distros have no default username and pass for the live cd
2010-02-07T21:29:00.000Z	Eremite	EgOr	I suggest that you stay here and periodically ask for assistance.  Not everyone here is knowledgeable in all fields of Ubuntu.  Someone should be able to assist you shortly.
