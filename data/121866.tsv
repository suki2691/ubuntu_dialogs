2009-01-31T12:23:00.000Z	_2	bruenig	no.   superuser is uid=0 reguardless of name.
2009-01-31T12:23:00.000Z	bruenig	_2	I misread your statement
2009-01-31T12:24:00.000Z	_2	bruenig	one could say "the default superuser is root"   but to arbitrarily  call root superuser  would be a grave error, especially on my ssystem.
