2011-05-20T16:01:00.000Z	schnuffle	brubelsa1s	I can recommend Suse, Fedora, Mint
2011-05-20T16:01:00.000Z	brubelsa1s	mathezula	fedora has rpm, wouldn't this be, a regress?
2011-05-20T16:02:00.000Z	schnuffle	brubelsa1s	no, for KDE I recommend Suse, Fedora doesn't has multimedia in the default repositories
