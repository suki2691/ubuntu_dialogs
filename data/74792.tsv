2011-05-04T21:43:00.000Z	Cassini		can someone help me getting my nVidia 9500 GT card working? I am in 11.04,  the current drivers are loaded but are not being used. Log error is "Failed to initialize the NVIDIA GPU at PCI:1:0:0". In lshw it lists the PCI as "Bus Info: pci@0000:01:00.0"
2011-05-04T21:45:00.000Z	Cassini		dunno if that might be it on the pci addy... if 0000:01:0.0 is pci 0:1:0 or what... any ideas?
2011-05-04T21:47:00.000Z	Cassini		the only way I can get ubuntu 11.04 to boot is into recovery low graphics mode... at least 10.04 would boot.. I am about to give up again...
