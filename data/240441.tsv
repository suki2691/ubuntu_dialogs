I suspect that NBC is discriminating against linux users because of it's affiliation with MicroSoft, but I suppose there could be a bug in my computer. Would some people here please tell me if http://www.nbc.com/The_Tonight_Show_with_Jay_Leno/video/episodes/ works for you, or says you need to upgrade?
