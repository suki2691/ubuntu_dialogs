2008-07-08T04:10:00.000Z	thiefness		How could I find out exactly what wireless card I am using without opening my tower? I looked in 'hardware information' and all it said was vendor etc and ralink was the vender
2008-07-08T04:12:00.000Z	thiefness		Would the usb wireless card be listed under Host Bridge?
