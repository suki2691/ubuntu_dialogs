2004-12-31T12:07:00.000Z	andrew		doesn't have all the little exotic things, but still it has a lot
2004-12-31T12:09:00.000Z	mike_dougla1	andrew	I built gtk2 emacs-cvs packages if you want them. A lot better on the eyes (without having to run it in gnome-terminal)
2004-12-31T12:10:00.000Z	andrew	mike_dougla1	no thanks, mike_dougla1.  i'm not running ubuntu yet, just considering it.  appreciate it.
