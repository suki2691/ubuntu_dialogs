2010-10-26T19:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	trojan_spike	? alacarte is the program name
2010-10-26T19:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	trojan_spike	i would "guess" it is stored in a database or gconf somewhere.  (they aren't shortcuts like they once where)
2010-10-26T19:39:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	trojan_spike	to edit the menu, use System / Preferences / Main Menu
