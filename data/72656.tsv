2010-09-15T04:39:00.000Z	tbr		I'm trying to install Ubuntu on a friends machine but after the purple screen with the little icons at the bottom I get a message box that pops up with "/casqer/vmlinuz". I have tried three different LiveCDs and two DVD drives. I'm now leaning toward a bad RAM module. Does anyone know anything other than bad RAM that might cause this?
2010-09-15T04:39:00.000Z	tbr		Oh and I once did make it to the initial cd menu and every selection would pop up the same message box

2010-09-15T04:47:00.000Z	versuchsanstalt	tbr	oops. so get new ram!
