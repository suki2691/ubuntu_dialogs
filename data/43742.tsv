2010-11-12T19:46:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	nha	try setting up a web server to get ton of hits a day and you'll figure it out. ;)
2010-11-12T19:47:00.000Z	nha	Sir_Konrad	well duh, they're not very powerful, but if you have a spare one lying around for some low-power, but always-on tasks, why the hell not?
2010-11-12T19:48:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	nha	yeah I didn't see what Twiggy|worx was setting up his server for. But yeah, small stuff is ok.
