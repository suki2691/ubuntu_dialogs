2008-01-10T02:31:00.000Z	iclebyte		thats the problem.. you need to get to a text login on the live CD first..
2008-01-10T02:31:00.000Z	iclebyte		Does anyone in here know how to get the Ubuntu live CD to boot to a text mode login?..
2008-01-10T02:32:00.000Z	Slart	iclebyte	try the alternate install cd.. it uses a text mode installer.. I don't know if you can make the live cd go into text mode..
