2008-10-29T10:14:00.000Z	Ishnu-		I am having a problem with my Ubuntu 8.04 - every now and then (it has happened 4 times in the last week and a half), the screen just goes black, shows some text about running boot scripts, then asks me to log in again (when I log in, all the windows from my previous session are gone).
2008-10-29T10:14:00.000Z	Ishnu-		It seems to just happen at random times - once when I was reading a manual in the terminal, once when I was typing in openoffice word

2008-10-29T10:26:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Ishnu-	no, it will give you one more window manager in the sessions list
