2008-09-18T22:45:00.000Z	nalys		Hello there, I have few with my laptop and desktop computers, both running ubuntu 8.04 with latest updates (I hope so :P) : one problem I have on both is that when I'm root I can't access the trash folder... neither with nautilus nor with the terminal... I'm sure (I hope) it's something dumb I just didn't figure out or did wrong because I'm a new user :>

2008-09-18T22:46:00.000Z	ejer		!sudo | nalys
2008-09-18T22:47:00.000Z	nalys	ejer	I wouldn't though what I did (not on purpose) is I put a file as root in the trash folder ... and now cant erase it :P
