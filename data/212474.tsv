2005-11-09T17:35:00.000Z	dbug		I've got a strange problem: I want to compile psybnc with ssl support. so I did "apt-get install openssl libssl-dev" but make gives me the error 'SSL-Support: Yes, but no openssl binary found in "/usr/bin/"' even though the binary is definitely in there
2005-11-09T17:35:00.000Z	dbug		what am I doing wrong here?
