2009-05-10T13:36:00.000Z	Eevee	Niv3k	plug the computers into a router.  after that it rather depends what you want to do
2009-05-10T13:38:00.000Z	Eevee	Niv3k	right-click folders, Sharing Options.  other machines should show up under Network
2009-05-10T13:39:00.000Z	Eevee	Niv3k	er no, that's only if you want to make a fake LAN over the internet
