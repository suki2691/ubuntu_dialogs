2006-05-02T16:14:00.000Z	Jasey		my question is: last night i was installing some updates on dapper, and then the power cut me off mid install. this morning, i tried to boot into linux. i cud log in, but nothing loaded. i was left to enjoy moving a mouse around a brown screen with nothing to do. what could be wrong?
