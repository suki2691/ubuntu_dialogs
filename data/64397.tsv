2009-03-06T04:08:00.000Z	balleyne	Koenigsegg	System > Preferences > Screen Resolution ?
2009-03-06T04:10:00.000Z	Koenigsegg	balleyne	It ssays my max res is 1024x768. Nvidia X Server settings says 1360x768. But I don't believe that..
2009-03-06T04:10:00.000Z	balleyne	Koenigsegg	ah, yeah, that GUI seems to only work within the limits of xorg.conf I think
