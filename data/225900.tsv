2006-10-04T14:06:00.000Z	axa-axa		Since dapper drake 6.06 is LTS (Long Term Support) does that mean that last Gnome version will also be available for dapper drake?
2006-10-04T14:07:00.000Z	trappist	axa-axa	Long Term Support
2006-10-04T14:08:00.000Z	trappist	axa-axa	security fixes and bugfixes will be backported to dapper for 5 years
