2005-04-03T09:35:00.000Z	Chromatron600		(Sorry to repeat myself, but I no one replied) I can't make Ubuntu recognize my monitor's capabilities. It won't let me use resolutions other than the ones I set during setup and only allows refreshing at 60Hz. I already tried messing around with it, but all I did was corrupt X and had to reinstall. What do I do?
2005-04-03T09:36:00.000Z	odie5533	Chromatron600	you try installing the nvidia config files?
2005-04-03T09:37:00.000Z	Chromatron600	odie5533	I installed the nvidia display driver for my GeForce, yes.
2005-04-03T09:38:00.000Z	odie5533	Chromatron600	nvidia-settings <-- I don't know what it is, but it reminds me of windows where you had nvidia tools you could set that in
