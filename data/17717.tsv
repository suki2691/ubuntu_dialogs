2012-08-30T15:40:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Guest1100101	 delete the ppa from the software sources
2012-08-30T15:44:00.000Z	Guest1100101	MonkeyDust	done, but I think some of the packages from the ppa still remain around - I need the original ones
2012-08-30T15:45:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Guest1100101	 try sudo apt-get autoremove
2012-08-30T15:55:00.000Z	Guest1100101	MonkeyDust	thnx for help, I manually forced versions through synaptic, and it seems to work now
