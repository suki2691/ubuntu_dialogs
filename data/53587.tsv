Using an option of Ubuntu installation, it changed some boot procedure/file in WinXP. Booting from the HD gave a menu: a)install from cd  b)Continue in windows. Ubuntu install proceeded. Now, there still remains that menu when booting in WinXP. How to get rid of it?

2009-06-27T16:00:00.000Z	Night_Elf	ChoboMog	there's no way to edit any file of windows ?
2009-06-27T16:03:00.000Z	Night_Elf	ChoboMog	I will check that. Thanks  :)
