2011-12-20T18:05:00.000Z	theadmin	resonantsky	I'm not so sure about what "bootstrap.log" is, but "sudo apt-get -f install" or "sudo dpkg --configure -a" usually fix broken packages.
2011-12-20T18:06:00.000Z	resonantsky	theadmin	seems to be a log of all dpkg actions... its cool, i assume that adding all these predependencies can do no harm...
