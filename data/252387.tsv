2006-10-08T06:50:00.000Z	Daynah		When I change from ATI back to Vesa, do I change the "driver" in BOTH of the "Device" sections? And what do I do to the rest of the sections (Identifier, for example, that says stuff about ATI)
2006-10-08T06:51:00.000Z	Daynah		Wickedpuppy, if it doesn't work, how would I change it back?
2006-10-08T06:51:00.000Z	xav	Daynah	you can just edit the Driver
2006-10-08T06:52:00.000Z	xav	Daynah	why do you have several ones?
