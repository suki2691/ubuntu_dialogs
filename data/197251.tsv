2006-11-14T09:20:00.000Z	jenda		I have trouble with beryl. Till now, I used fglrx+xgl+beryl, and it worked nice. Except the fact that xgl is a dirty hack and prevents other things from working right. Now I finally installed the opensource radeon driver, and run xorg+aiglx+beryl on that. However, it runs very slow, and makes it nearly unusable. gnome-panel eats up around 80% CPU.

2006-11-14T09:22:00.000Z	jenda	Mastastealth	well, unusually choppy.
