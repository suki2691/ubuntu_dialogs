2008-04-30T08:06:00.000Z	yuri_		if I want all windows to be borderless, what do i do?
2008-04-30T08:07:00.000Z	h00k	yuri_	check out VirtualBox and it's "Seemless mode"
2008-04-30T08:07:00.000Z	yuri_	h00k	i meant the window decoration, not the ms operating system
2008-04-30T08:08:00.000Z	h00k	yuri_	:) okay
