2007-03-06T06:32:00.000Z	Allen3373		I can't get ndiswapper to install. it tells me the file or directory doesn't exist, even though it's sitting there on my desktop.
2007-03-06T06:34:00.000Z	Allen3373		So any ideas on why I can't install ndiswrapper?
2007-03-06T06:34:00.000Z	bruenig	Allen3373	how are you trying to install it?
