2008-01-31T03:33:00.000Z	NASAchusetts		I guess my real question is this; Is it possible to dual boot with 2 different harddrives? In my case my fist HD is already partitioned with Vistax64/XP, I found this spare 15GB HD in my house and wanted to use that just for Ubuntu. So can it be done or does all the OS's have to be on one HD?
