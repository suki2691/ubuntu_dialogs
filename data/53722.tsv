2009-06-24T08:25:00.000Z	lorenzino		Can I install Ubuntu on a Sony Vaio VGN SR 290 ? The guy at Sony told me no, but I thought you can run Linux pretty much on any PC hardware....

2009-06-24T08:26:00.000Z	lorenzino		Thank you. I should not have problems because of lack of drivers for that particular hardware, correct ?
