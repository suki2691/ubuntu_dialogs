2009-02-24T01:51:00.000Z	georgez		I am having trouble with the wired interface of a laptop on 8.10
2009-02-24T01:51:00.000Z	georgez		it worked upon install of 8.10, but when i updated the packages it would no longer obtain the address
2009-02-24T01:51:00.000Z	Huufarted	georgez	 so the problem is that it won't get an IP address via DHCP on a wired network?
