2007-07-10T09:46:00.000Z	pike__	nfi-admi1	yeah. just alt-ctrl-f2 then sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop then sudo apt-get remove --purge xserver-xorg  i guess. you wont have a gui though afterwards
2007-07-10T09:47:00.000Z	pike__	nfi-admi1	i thought you were asking about the server install. the server install is basically just a stripped cli only desktop install
2007-07-10T09:48:00.000Z	pike__	nfi-admi1	yeah but those packages are available anyway for you now
