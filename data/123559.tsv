2007-08-26T14:02:00.000Z	Adlai	TheSaint	if it's really old hardware, you should go with the alternate install disc
2007-08-26T14:05:00.000Z	TheSaint	Adlai	thank you for the reply. I'm going to install onto a P3 800 Mhz w/ 512 MB RAM. is it ok even for Server edition?
2007-08-26T14:05:00.000Z	Adlai	TheSaint	yeah that'll be fine
