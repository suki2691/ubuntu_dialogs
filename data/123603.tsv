2007-09-04T12:51:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		is anyone in here using iceweasel?  it looks interesting, but I need to know which file I should be downloading
2007-09-04T12:52:00.000Z	nbkr	Geoffrey2	Iceweasel is Firefox (or Mozilla I think). Just the name has changed.
2007-09-04T12:55:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	nbkr	from what I've read, it's basically Firefox minus restricted/non-free software
2007-09-04T12:55:00.000Z	nbkr	Geoffrey2	Correct. I have IceApe in use on a Debian Etch System. I didn't se any problem.
