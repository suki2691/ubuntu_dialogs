2011-12-19T13:44:00.000Z	|Frodo|		hello! I have a strange problem: booting my old notebook (256 MiB RAM; no harddisk) with kubuntu live DVD, my PCMCIA WLAN card (compaq WL 110) is recogniced and configured in a way, that I am able touse WPA.
2011-12-19T13:45:00.000Z	|Frodo|		poorly I can not lealy work with ubuntu caused of the small RAM size. so I am trying to use "grml" live CD.
2011-12-19T13:47:00.000Z	|Frodo|		the suppising problem is, that with "grml" my WLAN card is not able to use WPA, only WEP is supported there! how can I find out, what ubuntu makes "better" then "grml"?
2011-12-19T13:48:00.000Z	llutz_	|Frodo|	check what kernel-module(driver) grml/ubuntu uses, check versions
