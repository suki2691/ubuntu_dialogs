2009-12-17T04:04:00.000Z	Peter-netbook		Question for the knoweldgeable folks; I'm trying to boot into a live session from a freshly made 9.10 UNR bootable off a Kingston 2GB stick just bought today, made with Unetbootin.  It gets through the first parts but then gets to the loading screen ( with spining dial ) and stays there indefinately.  this is on HP Mini 1115NR.  Haven't found anything yet on the forums.
