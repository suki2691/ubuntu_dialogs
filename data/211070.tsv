I have a ~280gb harddrive, laptop, and my plan is to have dual-boot with W7(i don't pay MS, so don't think i'm an infidel) and Ubuntu (is 9.10 the best one to use right now?). And I am wondering how many partitions I should make. It sounds like for W7 i will only need 1 ntfs partition, bbut not sure how big. About ubuntu - I heard that I should make Reiser for system partition, and Something else for the other files. S
