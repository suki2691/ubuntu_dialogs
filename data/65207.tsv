I've tried booting Ubuntu 8.10 32bit and 64bit from the live CD, both are locking up on the Ubuntu load screen (with the orange bar that goes back and forth). Anyone have any ideas as to what kind of hardware issues could cause it to lockup during loading, that doesn't lock up when running MemTest86+ for half an hour?
