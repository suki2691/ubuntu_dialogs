2008-09-30T02:55:00.000Z	Gammi	BobCFC	but why? why not just use su or sudo... ?
2008-09-30T02:56:00.000Z	BobCFC	Gammi	the gk versions ask for password in a window not command line.. i think the problem is if sudop crashes when as root somehting happens to permissions and u might get stuck. i never had a problem though
2008-09-30T02:57:00.000Z	Gammi	BobCFC	bobertdos: I never got problems with that either... but i don't use sudo... but i will reamember it.. thanks..
