2010-12-19T20:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ejcweb	 ive seen similer trticks done with the 'webcamstudio' program . it lets you reroute stuff to differnt /dev/video# and /dev/audio# type devices you could use as if they were a real input
2010-12-19T20:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ejcweb	 its also perhaps possible with the various pulse audio config tools. (some are not installed by default)
2010-12-19T20:35:00.000Z	ejcweb	Dr_Willis	I mean, the alternative is to select a different input source. I've got a choice of OSS, Port Audio, or PulseAudio. At the moment I'm on Port Audio default, which is my mic.
