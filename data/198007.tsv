2006-02-24T13:14:00.000Z	jsestri2	fangorious	yes i am
2006-02-24T13:14:00.000Z	fangorious	jsestri2	if you know what module is being loaded for the sound card, you can list it in /etc/hotplug/blacklist and hotplug won't load it
2006-02-24T13:15:00.000Z	jsestri2	fangorious	thanks i already figured that out, i'm not trying to get hotplug to actually load it
