2005-05-31T15:11:00.000Z	HiddenWolf		FYI, I'm now running on a 4-year old ide disk my gaming-winblows
2005-05-31T15:13:00.000Z	pfp	HiddenWolf	a good idea now probably would be backup the entire messed-up disk before repairing it, with dd if=/dev/hdx of=/dev/hdy
2005-05-31T15:13:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	pfp	I don't have ~120gb free, really. :S
2005-05-31T15:16:00.000Z	pfp	HiddenWolf	does /proc/partitions have correct info (if you boot with the disk in a 2nd system)
