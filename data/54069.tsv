2009-11-09T06:30:00.000Z	youngblood		I have a string in a C++ program that I would like to display it as red. I'm not using any GUI, just displaying it on the terminal. How would I do this?

2009-11-09T06:31:00.000Z	youngblood	Heebie	Do you have a pointer to a doc?
2009-11-09T06:32:00.000Z	Heebie	youngblood	No. I haven't done anything like that in years.
