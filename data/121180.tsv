2008-02-26T07:07:00.000Z	Kalic		hey all, just got a quick question.. Im wanting to boot Ubuntu off my cd rom without installing it. but i was curious if it would work correctly with an ntfs filesystem?

2008-02-26T07:08:00.000Z	arakthor	Kalic	no problem. nothing should change unless you actually go through the install process
2008-02-26T07:09:00.000Z	arakthor	Kalic	yes
