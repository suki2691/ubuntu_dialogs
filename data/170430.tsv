2006-10-12T10:28:00.000Z	Tonren	w30	whichever shows up first in $PATH
2006-10-12T10:28:00.000Z	Tonren		Hey guys, there is a workgroup on the Windows Network that I can access from Windows, but in Linux when I try to access it via Nautilus, I get a "could not display all the contents of this folder" error.
