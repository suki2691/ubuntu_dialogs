2008-12-05T07:49:00.000Z	simester		Help please - My Ununtu desktop is "Unable to mount [my USB hard drive]". I know it's because of how I removed it from my Windows laptop, but there was no "Unmount" option, so I just removed it.
2008-12-05T07:49:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	simester	try force mounting it...
2008-12-05T07:50:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	simester	unfortunately i forgot... isn't on the error message?
2008-12-05T07:51:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	simester	somethings like "mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /media/sda1/ -o force"
