2006-08-19T13:32:00.000Z	d104		Hi Guys, I'm having problems connecting Evolution to my exchange account. Does anyone know how I can diagnose whats going wrong?
2006-08-19T13:34:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	d104	check the logs on the exchange server.
2006-08-19T13:36:00.000Z	d104	fyrestrtr	I'm afraid it's a hosted exchange server with 1and1 so I have no access to the exchange logs
