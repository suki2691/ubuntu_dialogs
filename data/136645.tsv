2007-05-21T09:24:00.000Z	Rebecca		hey, im curious as to the difference between ubuntu server and desktop.. is there a 'diff like' comparison?
2007-05-21T09:25:00.000Z	mobutu	Rebecca	you know how ubuntu has all the GNOME stuff and kubuntu has the KDE stuff?  ubuntu server has neither
2007-05-21T09:25:00.000Z	Rebecca	mobutu	that's it?
2007-05-21T09:27:00.000Z	mobutu	Rebecca	if you want a detailed list, you should find the package list that makes up the meta package 'ubuntu-desktop' or the package list that makes up the meta package 'kubuntu-desktop', and.... that stuff wont be in ubuntu server
