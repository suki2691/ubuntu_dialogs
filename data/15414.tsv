2011-08-08T03:00:00.000Z	escott	bananasdoom1	there is a ppa at sevenmachine for flash 64 as well as flash in the archives. i would suggest using one of those
2011-08-08T03:03:00.000Z	escott	bananasdoom1	not entirely certain. make sure flash is uninstalled you dont want any confusion. and then add the flashplugin to your ~/.mozilla/plugins folder?
