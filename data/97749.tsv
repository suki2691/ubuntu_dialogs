2009-02-28T03:52:00.000Z	darrend		hi.  I have a problem with a  music player (UMS) that used to be recognised and mounted when I plugged it in, but no longer is.  Where do I start looking to troubleshoot this?

2009-02-28T03:52:00.000Z	darrend		dmesg shows the device is recognised, so I guess it's udev somewhere, but where?
