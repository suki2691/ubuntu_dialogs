2006-06-08T11:30:00.000Z	ijeff	yurtboy	ATI mobility Radeon 7500
2006-06-08T11:31:00.000Z	yurtboy	ijeff	some cards have extra packages, like the s3 i had to install a package to get the external monitor to display on a laptop do a search in synaptics with description ati?
2006-06-08T11:32:00.000Z	ijeff	yurtboy	the external monitor works fine, but shows whatever is exactly on my laptop screen, is it possible to have my desktop expand to this monitor rather than have it mirror?
