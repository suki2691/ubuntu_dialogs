2009-05-31T08:38:00.000Z	krepta		I am in trouble, grub won't boot, error 13, I just installed the newest ubuntu, windows xp is already there, but grub won't boot either OS.  Can someone please help me fix this?  I have no idea where grub even IS.
2009-05-31T08:39:00.000Z	krepta		If I can't figure this out soon, I'm going to have to wipe the drive and install XP clean again, I hate that.
