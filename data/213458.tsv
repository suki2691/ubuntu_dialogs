2007-05-30T16:45:00.000Z	obsethryl		hello, i was wondering, is anyone to add pidgin to the repositories or this will remain on hold for now (gaim became pidgin recently so i guess new dev branch as well)
2007-05-30T16:46:00.000Z	obsethryl		of note, so far I have only found this: http://download.ubuntu.pl/_Feisty_Fawn/pidgin/ regarding the pre-compiled stuff
2007-05-30T16:46:00.000Z	obsethryl		i compiled it here ok, no problem, but i was just wondering if we are to have an additional repo for feisty
