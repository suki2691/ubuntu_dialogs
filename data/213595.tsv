2008-04-10T08:15:00.000Z	TerrorBite		I'm having difficulty enabling mouse support in the virtual consoles
2008-04-10T08:15:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	TerrorBite	you've installed gpm?
2008-04-10T08:17:00.000Z	TerrorBite	tonyyarusso	I'm running gpm, I can move the cursor round the screen, but if I run vim and :set mouse=a, vim doesn't seem to recieve any clicks
