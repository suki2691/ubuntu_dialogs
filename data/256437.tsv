2012-03-09T00:41:00.000Z	spaceneedle		Why am I unable to update  the transmission bittorrent  blocklist?  It says it has zero rules.
2012-03-09T00:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	spaceneedle	 you downloaded a blocklist from somewhere? or gave it a url to a list?
2012-03-09T00:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	spaceneedle	 theres sites with them. the transmission forums/faq i think mention some.
2012-03-09T00:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	spaceneedle	 even blocklists are not that safe.  best to use some vpn/proxy anonymizeing service if you are worried about things
