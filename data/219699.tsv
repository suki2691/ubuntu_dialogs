2008-01-24T10:34:00.000Z	Flannel	ginge2k8	Suggest you use a proper LAMP stack instead
2008-01-24T10:36:00.000Z	Flannel	ginge2k8	Well, XAMPP isn't supported here, but LAMP is real easy to setup, just a few simple commands (hooray for package management): https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP  will get you all up and running
2008-01-24T10:36:00.000Z	Flannel	ginge2k8	and we support that here too.
