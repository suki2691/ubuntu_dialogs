2012-06-24T01:29:00.000Z	TransitTycoon		Sorry, computer crashed when fiddling with ccsm. Still have this problem where I can not move windows with my mouse, not even while holding alt, or by trying the new unity handles
2012-06-24T01:29:00.000Z	TransitTycoon		or for that matter, by right clicking the window manager and clicking "move"; any ideas?
2012-06-24T01:31:00.000Z	TransitTycoon		ill give that a try, thanks!
