2011-04-02T10:14:00.000Z	ubquest		i am looking for a (cad style) program that can draw 2d maps, and can easily apply measurement annotations that show distance of lines etc
2011-04-02T10:16:00.000Z	ubquest		i looked at it, couldnt see a way to do automatic distance annotations (might have just missed the feature)
2011-04-02T10:18:00.000Z	ubquest		tried inkscape - it has a ruler but doesnt seem to display the actual distance in text (unless i missed a setting somewhere)
2011-04-02T10:19:00.000Z	milamber	ubquest	try qcad?
