2008-09-29T01:15:00.000Z	asmussen		I'm trying to install Ubuntu for the first time (Although I have a lot of experience with Red Hat and Fedora distros), and I'm not getting very far. When I'm trying to boot the install CD, I choose the menu option to install, and then it gives me the splash screen with the thing going back and forth for a while, but then it just dumps me to a busybox prompt with a '(initramfs)' prompt.
2008-09-29T01:15:00.000Z	asmussen		There aren't any error messages that I can see, and I'm not sure what to do from here. Does anybody here have any experience with similar symptoms?
2008-09-29T01:17:00.000Z	asmussen		The system currently has a FC 9 installation on it that I am planning on overwriting. And no, I dont know for certain that the cd is good, although I have no particular reason to believe that's the problem. If nobody has any other suggestions, I'll try reburning it.
