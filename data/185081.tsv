2006-05-25T13:29:00.000Z	UltraMagnus_		what sort of system specs does ubuntu require to be usable? i mean, it doesnt say anything about the processor speed in requirements, but i doubt it would be very useable on a 286......
2006-05-25T13:29:00.000Z	dmbt	UltraMagnus_	ubuntu works with a 386+
2006-05-25T13:29:00.000Z	dmbt		not a 286
2006-05-25T13:30:00.000Z	UltraMagnus_	dmbt	but, how well..... could you run firefox? for instance
