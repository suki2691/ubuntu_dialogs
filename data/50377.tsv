2011-03-23T15:12:00.000Z	dyd		i'm trying to add this remote folder icon to my panel... but won't work!! i added a custom application launcher with this app: nautilus ../../149.132.120.83\d$
2011-03-23T15:13:00.000Z	arand_	dyd	I think you might get a problem using relative paths in a launcher...
2011-03-23T15:15:00.000Z	arand_	dyd	Also shouldn't that be just //IP/$d
2011-03-23T15:16:00.000Z	dyd	arand_	if i do that it gives an error of path not found cause it tries to go /home/user/\\ip\d$
