2009-09-23T20:37:00.000Z	anodesni		Hi, I have an ftp folder (with Connect to server... in places menu), which I want to access from the terminal. Where is it located?

2009-09-23T20:37:00.000Z	captnchaos	anodesni	man ftp
2009-09-23T20:38:00.000Z	anodesni	captnchaos	doesn't nautilus mounts the ftp folder to the filesystem?
