2005-10-18T13:06:00.000Z	Chadza		How do I list processes in order to kill one?
2005-10-18T13:07:00.000Z	Severian	Chadza	  try   ps aux
2005-10-18T13:08:00.000Z	Severian	Chadza	  usually, I know I want the postfix program, so I do something like     ps aux | grep postfix
2005-10-18T13:09:00.000Z	Chadza	Severian	Thanks for the pointer.
