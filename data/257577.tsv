2005-09-02T10:24:00.000Z	volvoguy	candlelight	you could try the expert install. otherwise the installer just installs everything.

2005-09-02T10:28:00.000Z	volvoguy	candlelight	when you boot the install cd, you can choose expert instead of just hitting enter. i've never needed to do it myself, so i'm not sure where the docs would be.
