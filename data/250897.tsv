2005-02-05T10:22:00.000Z	Bigglez		Installed Ubu 1st time today. Funny problems, Gnome crashed, but I think I will be patient.
2005-02-05T10:23:00.000Z	Bigglez		Real irk: Install shows all drives for partitioning etc. When finally in Gnome, shows only one HDD - why no others?
2005-02-05T10:25:00.000Z	grepper	Bigglez	/sbin/fdisk -l will show other partitions/disks to you.  If you want to use them you need to mount them
2005-02-05T10:25:00.000Z	Bigglez	grepper	- cool. I think that Ubu should do that auto - esp after install. no?
