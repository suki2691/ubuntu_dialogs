2009-02-03T01:30:00.000Z	GeffIsLegend		oh okay, now about my music, documents and such, that i want to not lose, how would i transfer those from windows to ubuntu? or when i do the cd install, will it already give me the option?
2009-02-03T01:30:00.000Z	ChronosZA	GeffIsLegend	intrepid gave me the option to copy it all over for me. and did a good job of it too. except for my email.
2009-02-03T01:32:00.000Z	ChronosZA	GeffIsLegend	i would dual-boot until you are comfortable with ubuntu, unless u have another windows pc to do anything urgent on. you dont want to find yourself getting stressed out with something that needs to be done urgently and u cant, it will only turn you against it.
