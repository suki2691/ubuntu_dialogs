2008-02-20T06:05:00.000Z	WhiteNerd		Does anyone know of a good tutorial of how to deploy a file server and have desktop machines connect to it to transfer file to and from. I also need Remote Desktop to be able to run. I'm setting up a computer lab

2008-02-20T06:10:00.000Z	levander	WhiteNerd	I think ssh is the easiest to set up, but having Samba setup is going to be the easiest for users to use.
