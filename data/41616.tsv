2009-12-16T00:51:00.000Z	obscure		Hey guys, I have this new server. I have apache set up and I create web sites in /var/vhosts, I have also set up samba... what I would like to do is set up so me an the other devs can login via our normal user account do work right in /var/vhosts/* how can I do this?
2009-12-16T00:51:00.000Z	obscure		would I basically create a new group say "devs" and chown that section to that group?
2009-12-16T00:52:00.000Z	Flannel	obscure	That'll work, yeah.
2009-12-16T00:53:00.000Z	obscure	Flannel	ok thanks.
