2011-02-19T21:35:00.000Z	geekahedron_	toph	i don't have an xorg.conf file ... I thought that was deprecated?
2011-02-19T21:39:00.000Z	geekahedron_	toph	yes, basically. i'm not sure if it's a driver issue necessarily, but after I change the setting it spends a few seconds "searching for drivers"
2011-02-19T21:40:00.000Z	geekahedron_	toph	okay then, my issue that it's not remembering the effects setting. any ideas?
