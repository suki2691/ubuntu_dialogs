2005-11-16T15:15:00.000Z	Ethan		hi, how can I give root right to a user?
2005-11-16T15:16:00.000Z	dooglus	Ethan	"sudo adduser <username> admin"
2005-11-16T15:17:00.000Z	dooglus	Ethan	you need to run it as a user who already has root privs...
2005-11-16T15:17:00.000Z	dooglus	Ethan	otherwise where's the security?
