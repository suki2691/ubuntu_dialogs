2009-08-20T22:09:00.000Z	grawity	alexanderubuntu	Depends on what you mean by 'root'... but you are probably looking for either 'sudo -s' or 'gksu'
2009-08-20T22:11:00.000Z	grawity	alexanderubuntu	'gksu thunar' in Xfce, or 'gksu nautilus' in GNOME.
2009-08-20T22:11:00.000Z	grawity	alexanderubuntu	Actually, both work.
