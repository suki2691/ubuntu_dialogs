2010-01-10T21:20:00.000Z	Galban		I've been using Ubuntu since April 2005 and Linux since the days when Mandrake and Red Hat reigned in this world. I'm just tired. Blu-Ray looks very bad in the near future of Linux and I do not spend $ 200 for having to uninstall it because Linux is not able to digest it. Registered Linux user # 358,506 --- Registered Ubuntu user # 6814 IS OUT! At least for a while.
