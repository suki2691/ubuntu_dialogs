2009-03-11T19:33:00.000Z	storbeck	mikevankuik	use ssh keys
2009-03-11T19:34:00.000Z	mikevankuik	storbeck	? how do you mean? I'm not sure
2009-03-11T19:34:00.000Z	storbeck	mikevankuik	ssh-keygen, install the key, then copy the key to an ~/.ssh server
2009-03-11T19:36:00.000Z	mikevankuik	storbeck	but I have access on the machine (via sftp its possible to access the machine too just nog via vnc but that is solved as soon as I have the user autologed in)
