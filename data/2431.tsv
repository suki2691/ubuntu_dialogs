2012-06-15T21:23:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	palis11	 find 'quirk' on this page and read the answer below it http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-nvidia-295-40-drivers-in-ubuntu-12-0411-10-using-ppa.html
2012-06-15T21:25:00.000Z	palis11	MonkeyDust	did that already, read all the pages in English about it. I'm going to remove them though
