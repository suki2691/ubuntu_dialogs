2011-02-02T19:43:00.000Z	BlueBomber7	JetBoyJetGirl	Mine's ALT+F9, but they're all customizable.  It depends on your window manager.
2011-02-02T19:46:00.000Z	BlueBomber7	JetBoyJetGirl	Close is ALT+F4
2011-02-02T19:46:00.000Z	BlueBomber7	JetBoyJetGirl	Certain programs might use additional shortcuts to close a window or quit, though.
