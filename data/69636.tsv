2010-09-07T16:36:00.000Z	phlak_user	sacarlson	Ankur as per my understanding, wubi just creates a large file to simulate ubuntu (but i could be wrong)
2010-09-07T16:37:00.000Z	phlak_user		!wubi
2010-09-07T16:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	phlak_user	I think your right.  well my method would be to try to recover grub with a bootable usb flash.  but in this case you might just us it to reinstall ubuntu.
