2005-02-04T06:14:00.000Z	trey3	Flyounet	don't make a mistake?
2005-02-04T06:15:00.000Z	trey3	Flyounet	haha... no... you can turn off console beeps... dunno how though  :(
2005-02-04T06:19:00.000Z	trey3	Flyounet	hmm... try 'softbeep'... takes it to sound card... or theoretically /dev/null (to shut it up entirely)
