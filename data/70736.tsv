2008-12-25T13:09:00.000Z	Caldrin_home		Hi! I updated from Ubuntu 8.04 to 8.10 recently. This removed KDE3.5 and installed KDE4 on my system. Since KDE4 is far from being usable, I want to move back to 3.5
2008-12-25T13:09:00.000Z	Caldrin_home		How can I do this?
2008-12-25T13:10:00.000Z	Grasputin	Caldrin_home	I had the same problem, so I went with gnome....
2008-12-25T13:10:00.000Z	Caldrin_home	Grasputin	Didn't want to go that far. I installed 8.04 from DVD again.
