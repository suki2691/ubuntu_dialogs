2007-06-18T11:56:00.000Z	clefia		i just have a simple question to ask. to run an executable, i used ./a.out  but how do I execute an executable in another directory?
2007-06-18T11:58:00.000Z	shiester_miester	clefia	 ../a.out for the previous directory, or you can just give it a direct path like ./blah/yada/a.out
2007-06-18T12:05:00.000Z	clefia	shiester_miester	I've tried ./home/user/Steam/steam where steam is the executable but I get no such file or directory. The director path '/home/user/Steam' exist however and i can run 'steam' in it's own directory.
