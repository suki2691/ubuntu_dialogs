2008-03-28T19:20:00.000Z	jimcooncat		I need to back some stuff from an infected Win 2000 computer over an ethernet link. Can I use a Gutsy LiveCD, or should I use a Hardy Beta? Or Knoppix, SystemRescue?
2008-03-28T19:22:00.000Z	unop_	jimcooncat	you can use the livecd for that
2008-03-28T19:23:00.000Z	jimcooncat		thanks Jack_Sparrow. I haven't used ClamAv to actually remove a virus before, but I guess trying would be a learning experience
2008-03-28T19:23:00.000Z	jimcooncat	unop_	thanks, I've used knoppix before for this, but haven't dealt with ntfs before
