2010-01-22T21:32:00.000Z	ge2x		hello. I'm trying to install Ubuntu 9.10, but the installaion tells, the cd is faulty. However, it's not - I checked. Also I got a crash report for modprobe. Maybe it is the problem?
2010-01-22T21:32:00.000Z	acicula	ge2x	how did you check the cd is ok
2010-01-22T21:33:00.000Z	ge2x	acicula	with the built in checker, when I booted
2010-01-22T21:34:00.000Z	acicula	ge2x	where in the proecss does it fail
