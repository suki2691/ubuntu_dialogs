2005-10-23T15:26:00.000Z	xur1z	synthetic_fenix	of course, why?
2005-10-23T15:27:00.000Z	synthetic_fenix	xur1z	did you have to change anything to bring up the testpage when going to http://server-ip-address/ rather than having the ftp-like interface come up
2005-10-23T15:33:00.000Z	xur1z	synthetic_fenix	it's a default page that's activated in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf if there is no html in /var/www
