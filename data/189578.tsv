2006-05-03T09:07:00.000Z	muraii_	cens0red	apt-get update?
2006-05-03T09:07:00.000Z	cens0red	muraii_	yeah. is archive.ubuntu.com down? Haven't been able to connect to it for days.
2006-05-03T09:08:00.000Z	muraii_	cens0red	I had that problem a few days ago; but when I did the update things worked fine for me.
