2010-04-03T05:04:00.000Z	UbuntuBoy		Question: I have Adobe Reader 9 on Ubuntu 9.04. Every time I open a PDF it opens it in about 10% zoom. If I resize it and close it, and reopen it it will still be zoomed at 10%. How can I change it to open the way I want it (say 95% for example)?

2010-04-03T05:06:00.000Z	daftykins	UbuntuBoy	yeah, why use adobe reader? use something free. if you insist though, if there isn't something in the settings about a default zoom level you'll probably have no choice
