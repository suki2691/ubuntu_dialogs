2007-06-17T12:29:00.000Z	stevej		I have a script that rips a DVD to an avi file. I want to put a menu option in the right click menu (on mounted DVD icon) to run the script, like the "Copy Disk" option. Is there a reasonably simple way to do that?
2007-06-17T12:30:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	stevej	yes, a very simple way in fact. Press Alt+F2 and enter 'alacarte' (no quotes)

2007-06-17T12:32:00.000Z	Megaqwerty	stevej	did that help you at all?
