2010-08-28T05:14:00.000Z	xangua	HPL	there is a kernel ppa https://launchpad.net/~kernel-ppa/%2Barchive/ppa and there is also another that i use for kernel and better performance https://launchpad.net/~guido-iodice/+archive/best-intel . PD. use PPA's under your own risk, you can easily remove them with ppa-purge (if you don't have it or you don't know what it is google it  ;) )
2010-08-28T05:18:00.000Z	HPL	xangua	thank you, I will try that PPA (yes i am familiar with using them). Will this allow for PAE? I understand PAE has changed in 10.04 (linux-headers-pae, etc are required now?)
2010-08-28T05:19:00.000Z	xangua	HPL	no idea, i don't use pae
2010-08-28T05:19:00.000Z	HPL	xangua	thank you for your assistance. i should be able to manage from here
