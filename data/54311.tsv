2009-06-15T02:04:00.000Z	TBotNik		All:  Really frustrated with my U 8.04.  Refuses to run update manager, synaptic package manager, apt-get upgrade, load 8.10 kernel, etc.  Trying to figure out why.  Was orginally trying to install mkisofs and isomaster when it started giving problems.  Any suggestions?
2009-06-15T02:05:00.000Z	TBotNik		All: the apt-get update works and packages download, but none will install.
