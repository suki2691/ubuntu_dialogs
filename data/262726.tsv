2005-04-18T07:16:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber		I'm having problems with gstreamer's theora playback being extremely jerky (CPU isn't pegged, and the audio stream plays smoothly), is there anything I can do to fix this short of installing mplayer or totem-xine?
2005-04-18T07:16:00.000Z	martinald	Ex-Cyber	i had the same problem! i just put totem-xine on
2005-04-18T07:16:00.000Z	martinald		basically i think it's gstreamer isn't ready yet
2005-04-18T07:19:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber	martinald	I kind of got that impression too... it seems to basically work, but has enough issues that I'm not sure why it was chosen as the "out-of-the-box" solution
