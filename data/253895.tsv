2005-04-25T09:31:00.000Z	dantheman		does anyone have an example of an xorg.conf from a setup with a single nvidia card that has two monitors hooked to it?
2005-04-25T09:32:00.000Z	dantheman		i've installed all the nvidia stuff, but i can't make my xorg.conf enable the second monitor
2005-04-25T09:33:00.000Z	dantheman		do you know how i could make it recognize my second monitor?
2005-04-25T09:33:00.000Z	zenrox	dantheman	 ask in #nvidia
