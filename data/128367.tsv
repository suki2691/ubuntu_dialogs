2007-07-11T10:28:00.000Z	thinksInCode		Here's another question for you guys. I am running this Ubuntu box as a home server, so it isn't running X or anything. Is my best bet to run the Server edition and just add what I need, or do the desktop version and remove what I don't need?
2007-07-11T10:28:00.000Z	thinksInCode		I notice that it's running a "-server" kernel but I'm not sure what the differences are - although part of my learning is going to be to try to build my own kernel
2007-07-11T10:29:00.000Z	Flannel	thinksInCode	the biggest difference with the -server kernel is that the -server disables PREEMPT.
2007-07-11T10:29:00.000Z	thinksInCode	Flannel	and what's PREEMPT?
