2006-07-24T08:56:00.000Z	ben__	erUSUL	I'm trying to extract some icons into the same folder as all the icons are in, but i dont have permissions. is there a commandline thing to extract then i can just do it with sudo?
2006-07-24T08:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	ben__	it is a tar.gz or tar.bz2 or a zi file or what (second time i ask)??
