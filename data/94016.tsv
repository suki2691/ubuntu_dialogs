2008-04-22T14:20:00.000Z	bazhang	NLS	hard to find? ubuntu gutsy dvd iso top link or so will do it
2008-04-22T14:21:00.000Z	bazhang	NLS	need that link?
2008-04-22T14:23:00.000Z	NLS	bazhang	the two most obvious locations are: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download and http://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/8.04 ...where is the DVD?
