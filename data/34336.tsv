2010-04-16T03:57:00.000Z	hunahpu	wyclif	they are not up for sale yet
2010-04-16T03:58:00.000Z	wyclif	hunahpu	yeah I know, but can you *order* one on the site before the release (I realise it won't go out until the release date)
2010-04-16T03:58:00.000Z	hunahpu	wyclif	no you can't pre-order one either
