When it's happened, the only applications open (other than normal GNOME stuff) were Firefox and GNOME Terminal.  Is there any way to tell whether the hangs were caused by Firefox or by the Ubuntu base system?

2007-12-06T11:48:00.000Z	Agent_bob	vasuvi	note that will kill everything.   so probably  ctrl+alt+del for a restart afterwards.
