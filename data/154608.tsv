2009-06-23T09:58:00.000Z	DirectorBonesy		Well, by official I mean how easily are they loaded.
2009-06-23T09:59:00.000Z	DirectorBonesy		Since, Arch seems determined to make my life annoying in that regard. :/
2009-06-23T09:59:00.000Z	n2diy_	DirectorBonesy	don't know, Ubuntu officials don't hang out here, to my knowledge? But if you can get it to work, who would care?
