2011-04-04T17:31:00.000Z	Emil		hello anybody here? i want to install eclipse-cdt on my ubuntu but it says that some of the files are missing. do i continue or not? if not, where do i get the missing files? this seems to be happening for a lot of software for me. isnt it a good idea to remove the softwares from the list if files are missing?
