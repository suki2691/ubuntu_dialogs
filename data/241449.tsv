2005-11-22T12:41:00.000Z	Rubin	Cyphase	sorta, depending what you mean
2005-11-22T12:41:00.000Z	Rubin	Cyphase	any website that is https:// is using encryption like ssh does
2005-11-22T12:41:00.000Z	Rubin	Cyphase	or you can use ssh to tunnel all your connections via another machine you have access to
