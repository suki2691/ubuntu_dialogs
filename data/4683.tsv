2012-03-12T20:39:00.000Z	races		Hi Everyone, My ubuntu system is taking very long to load when I initiate it. I have installed bootchart and hosted the image here http://www.filedropper.com/races-t410-oneiric-20120310-1_1 . Is this the right place to ask these questions?
2012-03-12T20:41:00.000Z	zykotick9	races	are bootchart images to large for imagebin (it is an image right)?  i'm no help, but i would have been interested to see it - but captcha download, no thanks ;).
2012-03-12T20:43:00.000Z	races	zykotick9	the image is really big, that is why I uploaded there. I wrote in the ubuntu forum and posted the picture and it was impossible for people to read it. that is why I used that hosting place to put the picture. what other service can I use to show you the picture?
2012-03-12T20:44:00.000Z	zykotick9	races	!paste suggests http://imagebin.org/?page=add for images, have you tried it?
