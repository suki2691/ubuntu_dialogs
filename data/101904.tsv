2008-02-11T18:31:00.000Z	emma		what if you don't know the path?
2008-02-11T18:32:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	emma	you could use the 'find' command, and grep the output for the file you want. suppose the file you want is called 'foobar', and you're looking for it from root (/), you would do something like - find | grep -i foobar
