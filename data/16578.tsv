2011-03-24T06:42:00.000Z	jamie4		Anyone know about using Gnome3 for Ubuntu? (not looking forward to Unity desktop after f15a) Should I look to Debian instead?

2011-03-24T06:44:00.000Z	jamie4	Aginor	thanks I'm thinking of coming back to Ubuntu after some adventures (I want my computer to work for me, not the other way around) but I've been using Fedora 15 alpha (with Gnome3) and it's sublime. I'm scared to downgrade!!
