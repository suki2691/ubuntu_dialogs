2010-08-07T17:03:00.000Z	TraumaPony		If I have grub installed on my main hdd which boots windows on that drive and linux on a secondary drive, can I additionally install grub to the secondary drive which just boots linux?

2010-08-07T17:04:00.000Z	TraumaPony	miha	Is it possible after both OS's are already installed?
2010-08-07T17:05:00.000Z	miha	TraumaPony	probably. don't expect any whizzard dialog though :)
