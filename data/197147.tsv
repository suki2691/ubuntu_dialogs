2008-10-15T05:27:00.000Z	dli		when is 8.10 due?
2008-10-15T05:27:00.000Z	bobertdos	dli	fifteen days, and counting :)
2008-10-15T05:29:00.000Z	dli	bobertdos	thanks, I wonder whether I should upgrade now, I think I need better xrandr support from X 7.4
2008-10-15T05:30:00.000Z	bobertdos	dli	I wouldn't recommend it. The Beta IS getting pretty stable, but I'd be apprehensive to try any advanced X footwork with it yet.
