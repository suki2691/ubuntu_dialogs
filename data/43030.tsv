2009-11-12T02:19:00.000Z	guntbert	nusch	no, those are different distros
2009-11-12T02:21:00.000Z	nusch	guntbert	but after upgrading will the system completely braoken or just not having all features of ubuntu server, including init-ng instead of upstart ?
2009-11-12T02:21:00.000Z	guntbert	nusch	the "safe" guess: it could be utterly broken
