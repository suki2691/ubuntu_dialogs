2007-02-01T12:36:00.000Z	Hacim07		than thats probably why it failed on my other pc.
2007-02-01T12:36:00.000Z	tovella	Hacim07	no i really don't think so.  you can upgrade a server with only text based programs from Dapper to Edgy.
2007-02-01T12:39:00.000Z	tovella	Hacim07	it really doesn't matter.  the upgrade is performed based on what programs you already have installed
