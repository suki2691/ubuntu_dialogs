2009-02-16T13:53:00.000Z	Dartel		Is there any reason why Linux will mount one USB Flash drive but not another? One is a very cheap 16 gig verbatim (Works), Other is a 4 Gig Lexar (wont Mount) and it has all my personal stuff on it from when I was using windoze

2009-02-16T13:54:00.000Z	binarymutant	Dartel	reformat it to use ext3
2009-02-16T13:56:00.000Z	binarymutant	Dartel	it probably uses ntfs, back it up on a different computer and then reformat it, etc
