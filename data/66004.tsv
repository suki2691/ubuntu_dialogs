2009-10-26T19:58:00.000Z	martin_henry		I'm having some trouble burning a data DVD with my compaq laptop's internal burner in 9.04. I have tried GnomeBaker and Brasero. any ideas?
2009-10-26T20:00:00.000Z	mcphail	martin_henry	i have found both of those programs so buggy that I default back to k3b. What are the specific issues?
2009-10-26T20:01:00.000Z	martin_henry	mcphail	schnetf, Brasero ejects after  a minute creating image but before burning and gnomebaker just throws up an error immediately saying image couldn't be made
2009-10-26T20:01:00.000Z	martin_henry	mcphail	schnetf, i'll give k3b a quick try :) thanks
