2006-10-20T10:47:00.000Z	fatsheep		I've got a quick q...  Is Ubuntu a good base for compiling linux from scratch (www.linuxfromscratch.org)?
2006-10-20T10:48:00.000Z	sproingie	fatsheep	pretty much anything can be used to compile LFS
2006-10-20T10:49:00.000Z	sproingie	fatsheep	you're basically cross-compiling, i don't see how ubuntu's kernel or libc would really affect it
2006-10-20T10:50:00.000Z	sproingie	fatsheep	hell you could probably compile LFS with cygwin if you were crazy enough
