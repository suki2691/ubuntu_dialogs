2008-05-10T18:07:00.000Z	f190		hello, i was about to fresh install 8.04 and was wondering if i should get 64bit AMD architecture or the standard. i heard that the 64bit AMD is terrible as no one writes code for it

2008-05-10T18:10:00.000Z	f190		i hope it fixes the problems i am having with gutsy for the standard release, it doesnt properly use the processors for the dual cores
