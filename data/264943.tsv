2007-02-04T09:13:00.000Z	rjm1982		Anyone here installed Ubuntu on an intel mac mini?  I'm thinking of getting one because of the small size...i dont like osx at all though..so it would be strictly a linux bx...anyone had any experience with it and or knows of hardware issues?
2007-02-04T09:13:00.000Z	bur[n] er	rjm1982	me too!!  I'm so curious... i know there were issues with wifi card awihle ago
