2005-05-26T12:24:00.000Z	bob2000		installing ubuntu for the first time. I'm switching from gentoo...got tired of compiling everything. One thing I don't understand is..the ubuntu installer never asked for a root password. So is my regular user account's password the same as root's password?
2005-05-26T12:25:00.000Z	bob2000		root account is disabled? um...ok...so what if i need to be root? say...if i need to start a service
