2007-02-05T15:31:00.000Z	clearzen		hi, My dns servers are not resolving domain names. I can ping the dns servers but they are not working. Is there anything I can do on the server itself to correct this problem?

2007-02-05T15:32:00.000Z	hjmills	clearzen	208.67.219.67 thats the ip for opendns
2007-02-05T15:34:00.000Z	hjmills	clearzen	erm - just edit /etc/resolv.conf i think
