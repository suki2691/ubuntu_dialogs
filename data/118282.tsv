2008-05-14T18:29:00.000Z	hwilde	hdevalence	what is the problem, it just hangs there?   run  "sudo dpkg --configure"
2008-05-14T18:31:00.000Z	hdevalence	hwilde	the problem is that it's keeping back certain packages that I need... The current version of ssh that I need to upgrade is bad ( http://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys is why )
