2007-08-28T05:20:00.000Z	dho_ragus	KlrSpz_	are you downloading stuff over the network too?  i heard there's a problem with listening to audio and using the network at the same time

2007-08-28T05:21:00.000Z	KlrSpz_	dho_ragus	well i notie when i AM downloading, it does lag more, but when i stop the downloads, it still lags out every 10-15 seconds for about 1/3 to 1/2 a second
