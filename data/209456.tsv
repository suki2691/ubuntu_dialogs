2007-12-19T08:01:00.000Z	nerbs		i'm having trouble installing ubuntu 7.10 - the installer gets to where it's copying files (with the percent bar) and then it suddenly disappears off the screen without an error message
2007-12-19T08:02:00.000Z	nerbs		like it just quits copying.  it has happened anywhere from 30% to 90%
2007-12-19T08:03:00.000Z	nerbs		yeah.  it says it's okay.  i've tried re-burning it and using different media.  i checked the md5 sum of the iso matches the website.
