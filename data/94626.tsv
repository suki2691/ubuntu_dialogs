2008-04-15T18:24:00.000Z	aliosha		I need some help compiling gimp from source...
2008-04-15T18:26:00.000Z	sipior	aliosha	what did you specify in configure?
2008-04-15T18:26:00.000Z	aliosha	sipior	nought, I just ran ./configure and it did itself
2008-04-15T18:27:00.000Z	sipior	aliosha	try "./configure --help" and look for a switch to specify the location of glib
