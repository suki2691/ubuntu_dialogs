2005-01-27T07:00:00.000Z	njs12345	cavediver	depends what you mean by "safe" :P
2005-02-03T15:53:00.000Z	njs12345	cavediver	there's a backports problem
2005-02-03T15:53:00.000Z	cavediver	njs12345	yes, i've tried that server but it can't download any packages. I guess it's was because i'm running AMD64 version
