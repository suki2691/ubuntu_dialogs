2007-02-20T17:46:00.000Z	colbert		Can someone please help? I have installed Ubuntu 6.1, and upon boot it says "Error Loading Operating System." I installed it on a IDE slave drive, formatting it during install. I have Vista installed on a SATA which i normally boot to.

2007-02-20T17:48:00.000Z	colbert	halkonst	So it is likely a version being incompatible for me?
2007-02-20T17:49:00.000Z	halkonst	colbert	I don't know at all, I have never used 6.1. It just seems like if you can't even boot your OS, that particular install is beyond rescue
