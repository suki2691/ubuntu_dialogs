2006-07-06T11:39:00.000Z	roostishaw	maagimies	where can i find a guide to install xgl, since compiz is in the repos?
2006-07-06T11:41:00.000Z	roostishaw	maagimies	so a 'sudo apt-get install compiz-gnome xserver-xgl' would do the trick?
2006-07-06T11:41:00.000Z	maagimies	roostishaw	it might, just follow the guides :)
