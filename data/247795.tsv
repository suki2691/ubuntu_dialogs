2006-10-07T10:09:00.000Z	Tabias		can somebody explain the main differences between gnome and kde?
2006-10-07T10:11:00.000Z	Tabias		and what would you advice to a novice then?
2006-10-07T10:11:00.000Z	ompaul	Tabias	they have a different look and feel, gnome tends towards less configuration, kde tends to let you tweek any one part you want to - they have different bus technologies below the bonnet, and they are constucted using different lanuagages, and I use GNOME wich is Ubuntu
2006-10-07T10:12:00.000Z	ompaul	Tabias	I want a simple interface to my programs and I have 12 years of this stuff under my belt
