2007-05-20T10:48:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	tls_81	I did until fairly recently
2007-05-20T10:49:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	tls_81	'cos Ubuntu's essentially Debian with a nicer installer...
2007-05-20T10:50:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	tls_81	nope. I didn't specifically ditch Debian, though - it's just that I got hold of new hardware / bought new hard disks so I needed to reinstall anyway
