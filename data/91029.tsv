2011-08-19T15:05:00.000Z	dabukalam		I'm trying to install ubuntu-desktop on a minimal oneiric, and I'm getting an error (ubuntu-desktop has unmet dependencies: Depends: gnome-session but it is not going to be installed Depends: unity but it is not going to be installed Depends: unity-2d but it is not going to be installed E:Broken Packages)
2011-08-19T15:06:00.000Z	dabukalam		yeah, but it's an ubuntu question not ubuntu+1
2011-08-19T15:06:00.000Z	dabukalam		i'm not asking why oneiric is broken, i'm asking about a problem that could occur on dapper
