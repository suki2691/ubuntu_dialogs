2012-02-07T17:50:00.000Z	Degot		Hi, all.. Is there an alternative to x11vnc based on Spice protocol or something like this ? (need to access remote desktop via LAN to play 3D games)
2012-02-07T17:51:00.000Z	auronandace	Degot	3d games via remote desktop? performance would be atrocious i would have thought
2012-02-07T17:54:00.000Z	Degot	auronandace	VNC performance is terrible.... But PCoIP  is fine...  I want to use Spice, PCoIP-like protocol not for VM , but for real hardware
2012-02-07T17:55:00.000Z	auronandace	Degot	i've never used vnc and i'm not much of a gamer, so i'm probably not a good person to ask
