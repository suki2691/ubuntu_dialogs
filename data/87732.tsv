2010-04-08T17:51:00.000Z	elegos	minimec	can't I use the tool directly from the LiveCD and make a bootable stick on that partition? I don't have Ubuntu installed yet on that laptop
2010-04-08T17:52:00.000Z	elegos	minimec	I should install grub too, and then launch initramfs
2010-04-08T17:52:00.000Z	minimec	elegos	You could try that, but how would you start that one if you don't have the master boot sector set to grub2?
