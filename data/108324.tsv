2007-12-26T22:12:00.000Z	identityx		I tried to install java6.0-doc in Synaptic. Now, this required me to be in root during installation. Changed my mind, don't want to install it anymore etc. so I choose abort in the option it gives me. However, whenever I install something in Synaptic now, it brings up the Sun Java install as well. How do I stop Synaptic from doing this each time? It is a great annoyance.
