2007-10-09T16:35:00.000Z	erichj		anyone else have an issue with compiz dying when you start virtual box? is this intended?
2007-10-09T16:36:00.000Z	kitche	erichj	probably can't run compiz and virtual box together
2007-10-09T16:37:00.000Z	erichj	kitche	it just started happening. hasn't been an issue before. installed an update to vbox and no more compiz while it's running
