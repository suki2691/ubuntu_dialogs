2007-02-16T11:17:00.000Z	wkdown		How come if I want to remove certain packages, I'm told I also have to remove 'ubuntu-desktop' ??
2007-02-16T11:17:00.000Z	PFA	wkdown	dw, just remove it.
2007-02-16T11:17:00.000Z	PFA	wkdown	ubuntu-desktop is a dummy package that installs the default programs for ubuntu. you don't need it.
2007-02-16T11:17:00.000Z	wkdown	PFA	what's 'ubuntu-desktop' is its not the GUI itself?
