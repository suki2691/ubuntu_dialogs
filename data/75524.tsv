2008-11-03T10:00:00.000Z	Conglomo	Atomic_UE	I was wondering the same thing. I ended up right clicking on the network icon in the status bar..
2008-11-03T10:02:00.000Z	Atomic_UE	Conglomo	i have a system > admin > network in 8.10 but it only does wifi/vpn network stuff, it no longer does hosts file or gateways etc
2008-11-03T10:03:00.000Z	Conglomo	Atomic_UE	I see. I'm using the xubuntu and I couldn't find network config period. :)
