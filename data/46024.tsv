2009-12-31T08:09:00.000Z	nfrs		I'm trying to compile a c++ program, which includes <string>, but g++ produces "error: string: No such file or directory". does anyone know what I'm missing?
2009-12-31T08:11:00.000Z	FireCrotch	nfrs	is it string.h ?
2009-12-31T08:11:00.000Z	nfrs	FireCrotch	it's <string> in c++
