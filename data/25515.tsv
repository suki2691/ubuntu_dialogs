2010-09-26T20:40:00.000Z	robisinho		to login I have to replug-in the keyboard before it will type. and then the same is true once Im logged in, again I first have to replug the keyboard. but I cant get the keyboard to work at all in gnome. any idea how to get gnome to work with the keyboard?
2010-09-26T20:41:00.000Z	ppq	robisinho	is it a bluetooth keyboard?
2010-09-26T20:41:00.000Z	robisinho	ppq	no .. I have this weird problem since installing nouveau-firmware pacakage trying to get 3d to work
2010-09-26T20:42:00.000Z	robisinho	ppq	now 3d still doesnt work, and the keyboard started not working either
