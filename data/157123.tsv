2007-10-09T09:54:00.000Z	ephesius	MasterShrek	you've been running the beta with no problems?
2007-10-09T09:55:00.000Z	MasterShrek	ephesius	no problems at all, well a few minor things here and there, but im pretty good with this stuff so i can get around things, for the average user i wouldnt suggest upgrading
2007-10-09T09:55:00.000Z	ephesius	MasterShrek	usually I can fix most things and don't have a problem but for some reason I couldn't access google and a few other sites after i upgraded
