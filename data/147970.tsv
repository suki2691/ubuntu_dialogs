2007-01-28T17:42:00.000Z	mytruehero		I'm having trouble getting synergy to autostart before the login screen. I followed the directions on help.ubuntu.com, but no luck. When I ssh into the box and try to manually start it before I'm logged in, I get this error: "DEBUG: CXWindowsScreen.cpp,840: XOpenDisplay(":0.0") Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server Xlib: No protocol specified WARNING: synergyc.cpp,337: cannot open secondary screen: unable to open screen"
