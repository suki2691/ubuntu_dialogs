2011-03-17T22:20:00.000Z	sandking		i just downloaded this app http://www.3ds.com/products/draftsight/download-draftsight/ but when i try to install it it tells me that it's wrong architecture (i got 64 bit Ubuntu)  - shouldn't 64 bit run also 32?

2011-03-17T22:20:00.000Z	ruan	sandking	install 32bit libs to run 32bit applications
2011-03-17T22:21:00.000Z	sandking	ruan	problem is i got these installed as i ran such apps before . but this deb doesn't want to start in app manager
