2012-05-02T22:45:00.000Z	kesavan		I could see this '/dev/sda2 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro)'
2012-05-02T22:46:00.000Z	kesavan		but I didnt see and cdrom or sr0 when i ran just 'mount'
2012-05-02T22:46:00.000Z	kesavan		is there any other command I need to run?
2012-05-02T22:46:00.000Z	khaktoos	kesavan	ask Justin Bieber about it
