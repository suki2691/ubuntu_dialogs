2009-07-02T04:05:00.000Z	LogicalGhost		Does anyone know if it's possible to turn a wireless card "on" even if it has no on/off switch?

2009-07-02T04:07:00.000Z	LogicalGhost	Jimmio	How can I figure out what driver I need?
2009-07-02T04:08:00.000Z	Jimmio	LogicalGhost	By the name of the card. If you don't know it, PM me, I'll help you so you can actually read what I say o.o
