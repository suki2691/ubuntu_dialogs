Plus windows emulation may be a good alternative for the time being but encouraging people to give up on native ports as cedega generally does is just wrong

2007-09-25T15:02:00.000Z	murkyMurk	tretle	they have instructions for how to download original wine & use it. trust me, cedega is LEAGUES ahead of wine in interfaCE and usefullness
