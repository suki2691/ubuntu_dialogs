2009-09-12T00:34:00.000Z	austin_work		part of the rule is ' ID_SERIAL_SHORT=="1234wxyz" '
2009-09-12T00:35:00.000Z	G_A_C	austin_work	/dev/disk/by-id lists devices on my system including their serial number and firmware revisions
2009-09-12T00:36:00.000Z	austin_work	G_A_C	I've got the serial number, but apparently udev is ignoring it
