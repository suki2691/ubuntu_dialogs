2007-01-26T17:03:00.000Z	Enverex		Is it possible to "schedule" a check on next boot on a drive?
2007-01-26T17:04:00.000Z	pbureau	Enverex	every 30 reboots it does it auto.
2007-01-26T17:04:00.000Z	Enverex	pbureau	Actually it doesn't, I disabled that ages ago and I'm not going to reboot 30 times just to get it to check if I turn it back on, heh
2007-01-26T17:05:00.000Z	pbureau	Enverex	 ah ok... fschk should have a help on it
