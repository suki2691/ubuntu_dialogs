2009-03-08T04:41:00.000Z	ajehals	NemesisD	- you can probably do all of it using OSS and some scripting for the automation, but it's been a while since I have had to look at the windows side of it...  if you were in the UK, I'd give you my office number, that is the kind of thing we could sort out for you for a lot less than 3k...
