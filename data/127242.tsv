2008-02-07T11:05:00.000Z	imforgetfull		I'm running off the 6.06 Live CD, I did this before but I forgot... how do I get the Flash plugin for Firefox... I did it before... it was a code I used in the Terminal
2008-02-07T11:05:00.000Z	WGGMk	imforgetfull	"sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree"
2008-02-07T11:06:00.000Z	WGGMk	imforgetfull	prolly because the live cd doesnt have the universe or multiverse repository enabled..
