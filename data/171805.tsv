2007-09-01T15:25:00.000Z	Enselic	bartekJoJoM	to my knowledge, just use that instead. I doubt you can use any other file manager than nautilus as the "default" without serious hakage
2007-09-01T15:26:00.000Z	Enselic	bartekJoJoM	yeah :(  but just run whichever filemanger you want instead
2007-09-01T15:26:00.000Z	Enselic	bartekJoJoM	that's a differnt issue   not sure how to do it though, but googling should give results
