2009-02-27T07:42:00.000Z	SuspectZero		hey there. another quick question
2009-02-27T07:43:00.000Z	SuspectZero		hmm this is weird. when i type the command "firefox -remote 'openUrl(http://www.google.ca/,new-tab)'" into console it works but when i type it into the run command field it doesnt do anything. any ideas why?
2009-02-27T07:43:00.000Z	unop	SuspectZero	make a script that runs that command and call the script instead?
2009-02-27T07:44:00.000Z	SuspectZero	unop	i might but thts getting way more complicated than it needs to be. what ever. i'll just ignore the whole -remote 'openurl' thing and just do "firefox url"
