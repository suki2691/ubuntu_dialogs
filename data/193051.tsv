2006-03-26T09:27:00.000Z	FuSiOn`		why is ubuntu > kubuntu?  I am not trying to start anything.  I used kubuntu 5.10 for a while, and for various reasons I switched, and to say the least... this is a lot nicer.  It can't be just gnome?  I mean the memory useage isn't even comparable.. its odd

2006-03-26T09:28:00.000Z	FuSiOn`	bjv	well I thought it looked nicer
2006-03-26T09:28:00.000Z	bjv	FuSiOn`	i dont use either though. LWM ftw :P
