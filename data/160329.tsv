2006-11-22T12:19:00.000Z	nub_		i have a somewhat advanced question for you guys
2006-11-22T12:20:00.000Z	nub_		what i want to do is this: i want to install linux on my slave drive, but not put grub on the master. i want to use my BIOS menu to select which drive i boot from, so that if i take the ubuntu drive out, it doesn't affect my windows drive. is this doable?

2006-11-22T12:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nub_	Still possible.
