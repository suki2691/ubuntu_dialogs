2008-08-23T23:44:00.000Z	gkrnours		I've a little problem with a 13GB's .xsession-error file. Can I remove it safely ?
2008-08-23T23:44:00.000Z	wols	gkrnours	yes. but maybe check why there are so many errors?
2008-08-23T23:45:00.000Z	wols	gkrnours	you can open it with "less"
2008-08-23T23:45:00.000Z	gkrnours	wols	less work fine, thank
