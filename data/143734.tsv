2007-03-14T07:28:00.000Z	dahoople		Trying to mount a loop device.  mkdir -p /mnt/loop,  mount -o loop linux /mnt/loop  Error is "mount: you must specify the filesystem type". Tried various -t parms (ext2, ext3, iso9660).   Any ideas?

2007-03-14T07:29:00.000Z	UB`	dahoople	try "file linux" to discover what is it
2007-03-14T07:31:00.000Z	UB`	dahoople	well so try with -t minix
