2010-01-15T22:57:00.000Z	Myrtti	BlouBlou	this is because root account isn't set by default and setting it might break some applications or shortcuts to them.
2010-01-15T22:58:00.000Z	Myrtti	BlouBlou	also, you're welcome to shoot yourself to your leg, but we'd rather you not tell others do it
2010-01-15T22:58:00.000Z	BlouBlou	Myrtti	you're wrong, applications' configurations are in differents files, so isn't any problem
