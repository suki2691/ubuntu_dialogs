2011-01-26T04:57:00.000Z	ejv	Taste	you can download the vanilla kernel sources from http://www.kernel.org/
2011-01-26T04:57:00.000Z	ejv	Taste	if you *really* want to play with the committed realtek driver code...
2011-01-26T04:59:00.000Z	ejv	Taste	also naturally you can go to the vendor's website as well and look under Unix (Linux)
