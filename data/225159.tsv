2005-08-11T13:21:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	Linux_Galore	 remember when I was talking about the only thing i didnt like about the ubuntu community? they think eveything that we consider a right of passage in linux is a bad idea
2005-08-11T13:30:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	Linux_Galore	 3.9 blows.. i rolled back to 3.7 for my rescue cd's.. i hated 3.9
2005-08-11T13:30:00.000Z	Linux_Galore	PurpleMotion	3.9 and 3.8 (my default) works fine for me
