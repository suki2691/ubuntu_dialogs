2008-10-21T04:18:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	magnetron	I have been using libdvdcss2 but had problems. Ripping isn't working for me.
2008-10-21T04:20:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	magnetron	At one stage I could click on the DVD I had in my trap on the desktop and had the choice to copy disc. By copying disc it went into a folder with an iso. I didn't have to rip etc.,
