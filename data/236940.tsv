2007-04-30T10:07:00.000Z	drummer		YO!!! DOES ANYBODY ON THIS CHANNEL KNOW ABOUT PRINTER ISSUES  &  FEISTY? (He asked for the 5th time)
2007-04-30T10:08:00.000Z	concept10	drummer	maybe he needs a better question thats no so vague
2007-04-30T10:09:00.000Z	drummer	concept10	Actually this is the original question I asked 4 times:  Need some help on a printer problem with a Feisty install.  The os saw my HP 4050 and appeared to install it - but nothing prints.  Help please
2007-04-30T10:10:00.000Z	concept10	drummer	the question is vague.  Test pages do not work?  What application are you printing from?
