2010-04-27T15:33:00.000Z	diffrant		3/4 years ago i had hard luck using Ubuntu on my desktop & lenovo laptop, several hardware incompatibilities, wanted to but did not get a chance to use Ubuntu since then. Things must have improved since. Now i hear Dell Mini 10 plays nice with Ubuntu, if i get one i should not have much trouble using & learning ubuntu [and python eventually, thts the goal] i suppose?
2010-04-27T15:34:00.000Z	diffrant		i figure all i need is the wireless to work, and i can read online docs, try small stuff over the terminal, learn python etc, will a Dell Mini be good for that?
2010-04-27T15:35:00.000Z	diffrant		if i dont enable special visual effects 1 GB RAM will be good?
