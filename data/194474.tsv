2006-04-19T05:57:00.000Z	tevulytis		Hi! Is it possible to somehow securely unmount + resize an hda (ext3) from inside the system avoiding the message that it's busy? Like without using GParted or Ubuntu LiveCDs?
2006-04-19T05:58:00.000Z	tevulytis		that's my problem that I don't manage unmounting it
2006-04-19T05:59:00.000Z	tevulytis		it says it can't unmount hda cause device is busy
2006-04-19T06:00:00.000Z	CraiZE	tevulytis	 reboot :P
