2007-10-06T16:54:00.000Z	frylock^		using ubuntu 7.04 (feisty). i took out my old cd-rom drive and plugged in my new one (creative rw 2440). ubuntu does not seem to recognize it. i can see /dev/sdc0 /mount/cdrom0 in my /etc/fstab, however there is no /dev/sdc0 so i'm thinking that's the reason. bios does see it as secondary master. anybody knows how can i mount it properly?
