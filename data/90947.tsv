2010-04-17T08:13:00.000Z	maxxist		anyone with any experience running hfs+ on ubuntu?  nautilus is finding the drive and showing most of its contents.  but permission problems on much of the data on the hfs+ volume.  where it shows my folders but wont let me into some of them.  I also tried this with a sudu nautilus.  same permission problems...
