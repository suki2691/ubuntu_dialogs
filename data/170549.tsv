2008-11-02T21:56:00.000Z	remu		Hey guys, I'm new to SIP and what not, but was wondering where I should sign up if I want to chat using Ekiga on my ubuntu system with my cousing using qutecom on windows. We would like to be able to do audio and video. I don't know where to go to sign up for service.
