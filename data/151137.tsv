2011-09-10T16:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	droogie	 yep. its a bit of a new fad. still hasent totally caught on for the masses.
2011-09-10T16:30:00.000Z	droogie	dr_willis	okies, thank you. will try installing a multitouch game and seeing if that works, and that should narrow down the possibilities. :D
2011-09-10T16:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	droogie	 i cant even think of a game that has multitouch... or much else that has it really...
