2008-08-08T14:39:00.000Z	Jaef		Hi, I just booted from a Live CD for the first time due to some delightful dll malfunctions in Vista causing explorer not to start, I'm trying to get into my hard drives to restore some files but it doesn't want to mount them since the log file indicates an improper shutdown. Any tips?

2008-08-08T14:42:00.000Z	jimqode	Jaef	yes they should
