2008-02-07T14:11:00.000Z	Peanut		Good morning - I have a bit of an Ubuntu Emergency - when I try to boot into Ubuntu, all it will say is "GRUB" and a flashing cursor. This is a MacBookPro with MacOSX and Ubuntu installed. Yesterday I shrank the MacOSX partition by 5GB, then allocated that space to my Ubuntu single partition using Gparted. Worked like a charm, booted well for both Linux and MacOSX.

2008-02-07T14:13:00.000Z	Peanut	astro76	oh, there is diskspace aplenty on the Ubuntu again - but I fear that having the disk full and the boot area in the middle of that 5GB disk killed my bootloader in some way.
