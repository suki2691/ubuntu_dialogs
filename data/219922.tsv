2010-10-16T11:00:00.000Z	Daremonai		can I do a dist-upgrade but use the cd rather than the internet?
2010-10-16T11:00:00.000Z	Daremonai		(the alternate disk for 10.10)
2010-10-16T11:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Daremonai	Yeah.  Add the CD to your sources (using apt-cdrom add) and then go through the regular upgrade process.
