2009-11-07T03:03:00.000Z	Tohuw		I reinstalled recently, and just brought over my backed up .gnupg folder into my fresh home folder. This results in the complete key being visible in Seahorse, but I don't have an encrypt/decrypt option in Nautilus. Why?

2009-11-07T03:05:00.000Z	cast	Tohuw	maybe you're missing a package? or a nautilus conf option?
2009-11-07T03:09:00.000Z	Tohuw	cast	you were right. seahorse-plugins was missing -.-
