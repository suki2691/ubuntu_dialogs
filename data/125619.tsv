2008-01-22T14:12:00.000Z	vincent_		Well, i am running kubuntu.. but i run apt get, to try to update the package lists, it hangs when it tries to connect to archive.ubuntu.. my internet is only 256k, and im in australia, so is it possible to either 1) find a better connection, or 2) download everything i need without using apt-gets in built downloader?
