2008-03-14T16:40:00.000Z	vampiregirl		I'm attempting to download ubuntu, but each time I do, after about five hours of download time, it gets to the end at it wants to do something with Sonic Record Now which doesn't work over here, so right now Sonic wants me to choose a path for something, which I have no idea what, and that was a huge run-on sentance.

2008-03-14T16:42:00.000Z	Slart	vampiregirl	when you download the file.. do you select "open this file" or "save this file"
