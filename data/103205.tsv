2009-05-18T21:55:00.000Z	TBeholder		Hi! i updated to 9.04, installed new ATI driver (doesn't work without it), now it all stuck.
2009-05-18T21:55:00.000Z	TBeholder		after login i see only desktop's background, but not icons or menu.
2009-05-18T21:55:00.000Z	TBeholder		i tried to switch to kubuntu (ran aptitude from command line), but it's the same, so problem isn't in Gnome. what to do?
2009-05-18T21:56:00.000Z	Daremonai	TBeholder	any errors?
