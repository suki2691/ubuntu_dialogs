2010-11-22T15:20:00.000Z	x404x		I have problems connectin ubuntu to internet, if i lock the adress manually in ipv4 it will only work locally even with gateway and dns set, if i choose dhcp/auto it seems to use ipv6 and im not sure if my old router from 2004 supports that
2010-11-22T15:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	x404x	ipv6 should work with ipv4 with no problem
2010-11-22T15:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	x404x	and dhcp only does work on ipv4
2010-11-22T15:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	x404x	yes
