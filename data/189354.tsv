2009-07-24T19:46:00.000Z	coz_	IonCannon218	  it can I just dont know if anyone has bothered with that
2009-07-24T19:47:00.000Z	coz_	IonCannon218	ooo  that doesnt sound right at all... I have no solution to that  ...one of the developers should know
2009-07-24T19:48:00.000Z	coz_	IonCannon218	 well by all logic it should adjust automatically to the screen size  but then I am not sure
