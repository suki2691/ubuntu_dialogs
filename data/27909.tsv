2011-05-09T05:25:00.000Z	Note-book		I'm sick and tired of graphics card trouble with 11.04. My GeForce GO 7400 on HP DV6000 is messing around. Even now, I tried activating the drivers again  but to no avail and it's all a mess now. My windows etc. don't have any buttons or anything. I even did apt-get remove nvidia-current and deleted X11.conf but still the same. Help!
