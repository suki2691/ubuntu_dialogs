2008-02-07T11:36:00.000Z	xopher		is there a way to speed up extraction of rar-archives? It seems to take ages. And using winrar via wine isn't an option...

2008-02-07T11:40:00.000Z	xopher	karlNY	Im gonna check it out, it should be faster than unrar/rar ?
2008-02-07T11:41:00.000Z	karlNY	xopher	not sure - just know it works ok for me when I have to unrar once in a blue moon
