2011-07-24T02:43:00.000Z	bryce910		is there any network traffic sniffer like tcpdump that doesn't require root to run?
2011-07-24T02:44:00.000Z	edbian	bryce910	No, they are all going to need root to run
2011-07-24T02:44:00.000Z	bryce910	edbian	Is there a way to get past that?
2011-07-24T02:45:00.000Z	edbian	bryce910	Not that I am aware of
