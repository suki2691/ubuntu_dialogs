2005-05-13T10:56:00.000Z	dad		What is the difference between kernels 2.4 (stable?), 2.5 (?) and 2.6 (testing?)
2005-05-13T10:56:00.000Z	dad		i'm having net crashes with 2.6.11.7
2005-05-13T10:57:00.000Z	dad		i was thinking about dropping down to either 2.5 or 2.4
2005-05-13T10:57:00.000Z	gorilla_	dad	try 2.6.10 as the 2.5 series are for kernel developers only....
