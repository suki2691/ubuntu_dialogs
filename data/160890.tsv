2009-07-02T11:17:00.000Z	croddy		hello, is there a way to configure grub to wait forever for me to select a kernel before it boots?

2009-07-02T11:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	croddy	IIRC if you remove the "timeout" line in /boot/grub/menu.lst it won't boot anything automatically but let me check before you try that.
