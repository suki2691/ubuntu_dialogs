2010-08-05T14:55:00.000Z	JamesWStubbs	Hello	I'm doing an Ubuntu port to the iPhone, I'm having a problem with screen rotation using Fbdev and evtouch. Both will work fine in portrait, but for screen estate reasons I need it to be landscape before I can release my images. I've added Option "Rotate" "CW" to xorg.conf, which will rotate the screen when X starts but as soon as the screen is touched the X server closes. I've also tried adding Mode "480x320" to the Display section of xorg.conf bu
