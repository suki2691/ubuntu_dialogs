2009-09-18T23:02:00.000Z	Gnea	CBro2007	as I understand it, ubuntu will just see the external drive as another hard drive on the system - just need to make sure it can be booted as a boot device
2009-09-18T23:04:00.000Z	Gnea	CBro2007	er... well, it depends if your mac can boot off of an external hdd
2009-09-18T23:05:00.000Z	Gnea	CBro2007	then you don't want to install ubuntu to an external hdd
2009-09-18T23:06:00.000Z	Gnea	CBro2007	that might be a better idea, if you've got the space
