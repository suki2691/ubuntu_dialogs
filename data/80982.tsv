2010-10-29T16:42:00.000Z	gaelfx		in the past few days, I've been checking the SMART status on my hard drive and it has gone from having 1 bad sector to fourteen in about three days time. The warning is in the "Current Pending Sector Count", though everything else seems to be good. This is a pretty new hard drive, so it's not related to age, so should I be worried about this and is there anything I can do about it?

2010-10-29T16:43:00.000Z	gaelfx	DGM	yeah, but this will have been the second drive to die on the same mobo, plus my DVD drive doesn't ever work properly either, so I'm starting to suspect there is a problem with the SATA ports
