2008-04-17T19:01:00.000Z	seasurf		<nickthorley> u can go from 7.10 to 8.04 naturally
2008-04-17T19:02:00.000Z	nickthorley	seasurf	is that a path most people do?  I presumed that the .04 releases were mainly for servers being lts and the .10 releases were for workstations so hence I thought I would normally wait for 8.10 but I wasnt sure how it went - I am used to fedora when you just get the latest version as it comes out and centos their server version is separate
2008-04-17T19:05:00.000Z	nickthorley	seasurf	yes it does thanks - so .04 is really a steping block to 8.10 then basically but obviously it will be supported for longer - so really the choice is to stay on the lts and have longer release cycles or keep updating every time a .04 or .10 comes out to stay the most upto date
2008-04-17T19:09:00.000Z	nickthorley	seasurf	i dont see the point though i may as well just move to version 8.10 and miss out 8.04
