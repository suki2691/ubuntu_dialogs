2008-09-01T02:10:00.000Z	Dandre1		is there any way to have a firefox with resolution of, say 3000x2000, on a destop at 1024x768? for instance with some virtual x server?
2008-09-01T02:10:00.000Z	wols	Dandre1	you can have a virtual resolution with your current X server
2008-09-01T02:13:00.000Z	Dandre1	wols	can this virtual screen resolution be dynamically set?
2008-09-01T02:13:00.000Z	wols	Dandre1	cause X can't do it
