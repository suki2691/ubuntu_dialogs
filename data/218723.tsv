2011-10-26T19:50:00.000Z	anAngel		Hello. Any stable filesystem supporting deduplication on ubuntu 11.10?
2011-10-26T19:51:00.000Z	sipior	anAngel	not to my knowledge. the zfs port does, and is pretty stable, but there's no formal release yet.
2011-10-26T19:52:00.000Z	sipior	anAngel	that said, recent betas are promising. your call :-)
2011-10-26T19:54:00.000Z	sipior	anAngel	still no.
