2008-07-08T18:05:00.000Z	_uniXrex_		Hey - I have a machine that I am working on that is running ubuntu server 7.04. I want to get the apache access logs /var/log/apache2/access.log . I need to posts the results of these logs on a forum. Here is the problem though - the server just has a command line, and I do not know how to get the file with the log information, so I can post it on the forums on my GNOME machine. Anyone know how I can do this? Thanks in advance
