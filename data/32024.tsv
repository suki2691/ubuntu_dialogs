2010-11-06T19:21:00.000Z	blue_anna		anyone know how to get compiz working with the nouveau/gallium drivers?
2010-11-06T19:21:00.000Z	coz_	blue_anna	  let me quote from #compiz-dev   the Gallium3D driver for offering up OpenGL support will not be going into Ubuntu 11.04 or any other release until the upstream Nouveau developers commit to providing support (or a "1.0" release).
2010-11-06T19:22:00.000Z	blue_anna	coz_	I havent installed any ppas since updating to 10.10 and I followed install isntructions from blogs and I have the driver .. glxinfo reports OpenGL renderer string: Gallium 0.4 on NV43 properly and everything ...
2010-11-06T19:24:00.000Z	coz_	blue_anna	  well I cant respond to that... all I know right now is what I mentioned already ,,, you sould probably.. at some point... talk with  sam  on #compiz-dev
