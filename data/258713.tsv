2004-11-11T17:29:00.000Z	mjr	tuxx	well, Radeon 8500 is supported by the free DRI drivers for 3d acceleration; I don't know how well's that integrated in Ubuntu
2004-11-11T17:30:00.000Z	tuxx	mjr	I can see in Synaptic that there is a driver.. however I'm not sure how well it works and it's not on my machine I have the ATI. I have a nvidia and it works with the provided driver. Will ATI be like the same?
