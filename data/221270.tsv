2008-11-15T20:33:00.000Z	mercutio22		I am reposting a question here from yesterday, please don't get insane at me. I think I can be more specific this time. Gparted won't show my partitions because my partition table is bad and some partitions are laying off the disk. http://paste.ubuntu.com/72395/
2008-11-15T20:34:00.000Z	mercutio22		is there a way to fix it? I know they are starting at the proper cylinders, its just the end thats messed up
2008-11-15T20:35:00.000Z	mercutio22		so, is there a way to take away that last cylinder from partitions 4 and 7?
2008-11-15T20:35:00.000Z	BlueEagle	mercutio22	gparted should be able to do that iirc.
