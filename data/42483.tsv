I used wmctrl some time ago, but it seems buggy on ubuntu 10.04 (I have 5 active workspaces but if I show the desktops number with wmctrl it only sees the active desktop)

2010-07-19T15:28:00.000Z	faLUCE	aeon-ltd	I don't understand
2010-07-19T15:29:00.000Z	faLUCE	aeon-ltd	I want to make sure that myApplication starts automatically on desktop 2
