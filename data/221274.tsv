2006-08-14T09:21:00.000Z	kirsten		I have a question: i'm trying to install a printer driver, and the manufacturer gives me a choice between a Redhat/Mandrake/SuSe OR Debian (there is no ubuntu option :( ). which should i pick?
2006-08-14T09:22:00.000Z	BlueEagle	kirsten	Doesn't gnome-print-manager recongnize your printer with the drivers it already has? which printer are we talking about?
2006-08-14T09:23:00.000Z	BlueEagle	kirsten	How is the printer shared on the network?
2006-08-14T09:24:00.000Z	BlueEagle	kirsten	So then I assume that you've got samba installed so that you will be able to connect to that windows share?
