2010-10-01T01:06:00.000Z	supernapalm		Heya (on 10.4 btw), I'm trying to get Half Life 2 working, got it started in game with sound, but it doesn't show any models like all npcs but background objects are fine. I was told on the wine irc that I needed more reliable drivers (got edge open source ones atm) like gallium3d but I'm not sure how to remove my old drivers and install ones that might work better
