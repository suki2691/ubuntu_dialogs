2010-11-13T08:19:00.000Z	Maahes		is anyone familiar with xterm? shift+ctrl+v is doing nothing for me, and It should work by default, should it not? I haven't overriden anything related to keys in my .Xdefaults
2010-11-13T08:20:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	Maahes	isn't shift+ctrl+v to paste?  maybe you didn't copy?
2010-11-13T08:21:00.000Z	Maahes	ubuntu4shane	I have already copied, and I've tested it in gnome-terminal, shift+ctrl+v works there.
2010-11-13T08:21:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	Maahes	hmm, odd, I'm not really familiar with xterm, must be preferences somewhere.
