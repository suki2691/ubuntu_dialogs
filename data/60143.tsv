2009-10-31T01:50:00.000Z	Voldenet		i'm trying to get apt-keys with command: apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com <key1> <key2> ... <keyN>
2009-10-31T01:50:00.000Z	Voldenet		and i'm getting answer that "server is inaccesible"
2009-10-31T01:51:00.000Z	ekimmargni	Voldenet	There are so many people trying to do the same thing that the server probably can't keep up. Perhaps try later.
