2007-10-25T05:50:00.000Z	Luigi		Is there any noticeable difference between x86-64 and i386 Ubuntu?
2007-10-25T05:51:00.000Z	dxdt	Luigi	no.  I'm using AMD64 for the first time and although the speed seems a little better in places, it isn't so noticeable.  There is no reason not to run 64 though right now.  Don't believe those scary people who tell you you can't get software.  I haven't found a program yet I can't run.
