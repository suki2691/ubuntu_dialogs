2011-11-12T21:37:00.000Z	kamilnadeem		a friend of mine is has posed this question to me "Was there something done to linux kernel that it does not recognize PS3EYE as audio input? I tested it on Fedora 16 and Ubuntu 11.10. It worked without any problem in old releases of Ubuntu.Video is still working without problem."
