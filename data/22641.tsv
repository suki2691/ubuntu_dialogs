2010-11-16T05:31:00.000Z	Trea		I currently have a HP laptop running windows 7 64bit with 4gb of ram, 320gb hard drive.  AMD Turion II Dual-Core Mobile Processor M520.  I'm trying to get it Ubuntu to dual boot on the hard drive.  When I get there in the installation I select my hard drive and then try to select the amount of space to give Ubuntu and then continue but i get a message saying I didn't select the root even though I selected as high up as I could

2010-11-16T05:35:00.000Z	Trea	hiexpo	I use linux at work all the time I just wasn't the one to load it.  I wanted to have it on here so at times when I want to bring my work home with me I have a compatible system
