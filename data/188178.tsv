2006-08-07T16:11:00.000Z	ubuntu		what's the best way to manually setup partitions for ubuntu?
2006-08-07T16:12:00.000Z	ubuntu		i'm gonna use gparted...but should i do root, swap, usr, var, etc, home, and then tmp like bsd?
2006-08-07T16:13:00.000Z	frying_fish	ubuntu	you could do, I personally just do / /home and swap
2006-08-07T16:15:00.000Z	frying_fish	ubuntu	nope, I think my / is like the 7th partition on this drive
