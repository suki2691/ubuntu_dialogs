2007-12-15T08:27:00.000Z	jdw	kayce	Is there a JBOD option in the partitioner?
2007-12-15T08:29:00.000Z	jdw	kayce	OK, just a thought. JBOD is 'Just a Bunch Of Disks" which is one way to logically put a bunch of disks together. Google for setting up a RAID - there's at least one tutorial out there that I know of
