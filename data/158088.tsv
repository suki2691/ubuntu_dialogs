2010-05-28T11:29:00.000Z	BodyThief		i hate to be a pop-in question asker.  but i'm kinda stressing.  wonder if i can get a bit of assistance from someone.
2010-05-28T11:29:00.000Z	BodyThief		i guess i'll do the question toss and see anyone wants to help..  dual boot, XP & unbuntu , just upgraded from unbuntu 9.x to 10.04.  unbuntu boots fine, but now i cannot access XP.  grub shows an option for it, but when it trys to start, just shows a cursor in upper left.
