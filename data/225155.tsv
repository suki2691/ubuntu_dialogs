2005-08-21T15:13:00.000Z	Blazer_ES		How do I prepare the 80gb hdd then? Ill format it to FAT32 from windows ok?
2005-08-21T15:13:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	Blazer_ES	 just put in the ubuntu cd and tell it to use the 80gb hdd, it will do what you need
2005-08-21T15:18:00.000Z	PurpleMotion	Blazer_ES	 you're overcomplicating a very simple process ;) Just throw the cd in and go :) It won't hurt, we [almost]  promise
