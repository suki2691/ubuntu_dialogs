2008-11-28T00:28:00.000Z	Ubunoob		I just downloaded Ubuntu 8.10, burned it to a CD using Disk Utility, and booted from the CD by holding C. I got the menu to choose to install Ubuntu, Check the CD for defects, run the live CD, etc. but when I choose to run the live CD, after loading for what seems like a few minutes, the screen goes black after the loading bar is complete, and remains that way for well over half an hour. I tried 4 times unsuccessfully to boot up
