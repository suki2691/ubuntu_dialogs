2009-12-13T19:18:00.000Z	sAnta89_	JJ1219	no, complete installs are recommended
2009-12-13T19:19:00.000Z	JJ1219	sAnta89_	I xannot full install 9.10 because my dad uses this computer and he hates ubuntu
2009-12-13T19:20:00.000Z	sAnta89_	JJ1219	in any case, it's still unwise to upgrade from 9.04-9.10, why can't you install 9.10 Wubi?
