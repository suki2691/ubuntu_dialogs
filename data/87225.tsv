2008-06-21T01:39:00.000Z	trainpic	tara0101	what happened to make your sound stop working? did you change a setting, install something?
2008-06-21T01:40:00.000Z	tara0101	trainpic	there was a system update thing, then it asked me to restart. Upon restart I lost all sound
2008-06-21T01:43:00.000Z	tara0101	trainpic	were you telling me to use the old kernel?
