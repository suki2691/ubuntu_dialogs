2007-12-01T11:05:00.000Z	Jaszbo		Hi room. I have been working on getting my wireless connection up and running in UbuntuStudio. I have an HP DV6646US laptop and it has a broadcom wireless. I have been on the forums and I have downloaded a bunch of stuff, but it still won't work. I have tried Network Manager, but it doesn't recognize my wireless connection. Any ideas+

2007-12-17T01:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jaszbo	which screensaver.. and are you running effects?
2007-12-17T02:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jaszbo	Does it happen with effects turned off
