2009-04-30T11:14:00.000Z	Surlent777		Anyone able/willing to help me figure out why 1. I have random static at random times and 2. I have audio output on only one side of my headphones?
2009-04-30T11:15:00.000Z	mgmuscari	Surlent777	your headphone cable is broken
2009-04-30T11:15:00.000Z	Surlent777	mgmuscari	very much doubt it
2009-04-30T11:16:00.000Z	Surlent777	mgmuscari	I notice that neither side of the Headphone meter in the gnome sound thing affects it, but master, which the tooltip labels as mono, does affect it
