2005-03-24T16:42:00.000Z	Utnubu		I can remember how hard it was for me to understand what sys:devs/mountlist does. And now guess what my first OS was :-)
2005-03-24T16:43:00.000Z	Utnubu		Well, I started using computers a long time ago and I would have been very glad to have something like and irc channel to ask peoples. We should be more patient with the people or make things more userfriendly so noone has to ask.
2005-03-24T16:45:00.000Z	dazed	Utnubu	i appreciate all the help i can get in the irc chat but again i dont agree with being spoon fed everythign about this amazing OS cuz if you dont learn it then people will just eventually expect it to be like the rest...so the part that makes this OS better than the rest that it takes time to learn
2005-03-24T16:47:00.000Z	Utnubu	dazed	many people just want to use their pcs. That means browsing, writing emails, chatting. And not learning stuff and editing config files. Linux is pretty userfriendly but it could be better.
