2010-09-03T00:43:00.000Z	pietro10_		Hi. Can I configure NetworkManager to flash the whole screen when the VPN connection "AirNet" drops (like it just did)? I use Compiz's magnification so I won't know until it's too late. Thanks

2010-09-03T00:44:00.000Z	pietro10_		also can someone kill the regular pietro10
