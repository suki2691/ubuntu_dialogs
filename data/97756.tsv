2008-03-13T20:20:00.000Z	brobostigon	artenius	hal is hardware abstraction layer
2008-03-13T20:23:00.000Z	artenius	brobostigon	any idea why it would say that? it never has so far. My net went out, which is why I logged out and back in, to see if it would fix it.
2008-03-13T20:23:00.000Z	brobostigon	artenius	no idea, sorry, never had that error.
