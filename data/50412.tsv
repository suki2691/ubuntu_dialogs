2010-11-11T20:36:00.000Z	sideone		i need to find a cobol channel.. anyone know of a general coding channel on #freenode,eff,dal,under?
2010-11-11T20:37:00.000Z	gdoteof	sideone	#cobol here has a topic set
2010-11-11T20:38:00.000Z	gdoteof	sideone	it looks like irc.synirc.net has #cobol
2010-11-11T20:40:00.000Z	gdoteof	sideone	i checked r/cobol too but not much action there.. though i bet if you had a couple days you could get some help there
