2010-11-27T18:57:00.000Z	nagchampa		i've opened htop to look at what's going on and it's running gksu, but there was NO popup to ask for my password
2010-11-27T18:57:00.000Z	nagchampa		it's getting root access without me having to even approve it
2010-11-27T18:57:00.000Z	histo	nagchampa	you can build a packaage without root but not install it
