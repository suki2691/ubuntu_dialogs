2009-05-24T05:28:00.000Z	Sevenlances		Umm I am a total moron with this but I accidentally unmounted my partition and I am wondering how I fix that?
2009-05-24T05:28:00.000Z	boss_mc	Sevenlances	which partition?
2009-05-24T05:29:00.000Z	boss_mc	Sevenlances	sudo mount -a
2009-05-24T05:29:00.000Z	boss_mc	Sevenlances	that mounts everything in fstab, which you'd hope would include your /home folder ;-)
