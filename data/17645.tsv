2011-06-23T19:42:00.000Z	dr_Willis_	Grav	 good idea of ay least ram id you want to suspend
2011-06-23T19:49:00.000Z	Grav	dr_Willis_	sipior: I'haven't created swap partition when i installed system and now I see ubuntu can't manage memory. I got 2gb ram and system freezes always when it's full. And it's getting full fast. It's never cleared. I know there is probably nothing that can be done about it.
