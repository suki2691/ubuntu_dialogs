2008-09-13T16:38:00.000Z	LetsGo67		It does look pretty neat so far... maybe a few tweaks here and there.
2008-09-13T16:40:00.000Z	notwist	LetsGo67	is wall-light even a theme? thought it was a mock up
2008-09-13T16:41:00.000Z	notwist	LetsGo67	afaik there are a lot of things in the mock up that aren't possible for real. Why wont the guy make a real theme instead?
