2010-06-06T17:40:00.000Z	ManDay		I bound Hibernation to the PWR-Button on the case. When I press it, the computer goes into hibernation as expected. When I press it again, it comes back up. But I'm only back on the desktop for a few seconds and it hibernates again! When I then bring it back a second time, it stays on-line. Can anyone help?

2010-06-06T17:49:00.000Z	ManDay	NoPyGod	the power button is allright. oCean_ I didn't find anything anywhere
