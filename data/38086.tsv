2010-01-31T04:00:00.000Z	i3inary		tuv0k: how can i tell if i am still in failsafe?  i dont see why i would loose all my gui configurations?
2010-01-31T04:02:00.000Z	i3inary		does anyone know how can i verify that i am in or not in gnome failsafe mode?
2010-01-31T04:03:00.000Z	tuv0k	i3inary	yeah, which did you login to. There is no verifying anything you either logged into failsafe or you did not
2010-01-31T04:04:00.000Z	i3inary	tuv0k	 i just enabled the compiz window reflections setting and it locked me up completely so i rebooted and entered gnome failsafe mode then disabled the window reflections setting via compizconfig settins manager.  i then rebooted and logged into gnome normal mode.  i dont see compiz loaded nor do i see gnome-do docky which i also had configured....why else would i lose all these configurations if i was not in failsafe?
