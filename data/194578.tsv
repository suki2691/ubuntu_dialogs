2006-08-10T05:31:00.000Z	mytruehero		I ran a big group of system updates that showed up in the notification area of my panel, and now my sound doesn't seem to work (it did before the updates). I'm totally new to all this. What can I do?

2006-08-10T05:33:00.000Z	mytruehero	DBAlex	Good question... let me doublecheck
