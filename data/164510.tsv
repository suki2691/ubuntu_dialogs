2007-04-22T10:13:00.000Z	peeps	Kazol	do you mean for the command line, or the fonts in your desktop environment?
2007-04-22T10:14:00.000Z	Kazol	MrBarkyVonShnauz	so there is no way to change the color of the text at the bottom panel (that shows the open programs)?
2007-04-22T10:15:00.000Z	peeps	Kazol	there should be some gnome display preferences somewhere where you can set that(assuming you are running gnome).  I am in XFCE right now, so I can't really look to tell you
