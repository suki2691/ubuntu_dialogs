2007-10-20T09:09:00.000Z	rickjones		hi all, i'm trying to install edgy on a new system ( new to me ) and everything goes fine till i try to use the command " lspci" nothing happens. also, the realtec nic is not being detected, in fact NOTHING is being detected. is there a way to `force` edgy to detect hardwaRE?

2007-10-20T09:10:00.000Z	rickjones	asbani	the last 3 gutsy cd's i've burned do NOT boot the computer at all, so , i'll go edgy and upgrade.
2007-10-20T09:12:00.000Z	asbani	rickjones	don't do that mate. you have edgy, then fiesty, then gutsy. edgy is real old I think. not really good idea to upgrade from edgy > fiesty > gutsy! I've read somewhere that upgrading has bugs. I couldn't upgrade from gutsy beta to gutsy final. or even from fiesty to gutsy myself. see here too another people has same problem too. http://www.linux-noob.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=3262
