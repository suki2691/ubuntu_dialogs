2007-09-29T14:45:00.000Z	sirrus		Good evening everyone, anyone using Gutsy Beta and rt2500 here?
2007-09-29T14:47:00.000Z	sirrus		Is rt2500 working in Gutsy yet, or is it still broken as it was when the Beta image was released?
2007-09-29T14:49:00.000Z	sirrus		One last try, in case the previous ones got lost in the sea of messages :) :Does anyone know whether rt2500 is working (with WPA) with the current snapshot of gutsy?
