2008-02-08T21:41:00.000Z	Lettuc3		i've got ubuntu booting up in verbose mode, initially the kernel boot time starts at something like 24 seconds, then after say 5 seconds, it resets and goes down to 5 and increments from there. is that normal behaviour? if so, why is that? and if not, is it important, and should i fix it(+how)? i got disconnected earlier, i dont know if anyone gave me the answer.

2008-02-08T21:46:00.000Z	bazhang	Lettuc3	should be fine
2008-02-08T21:46:00.000Z	bazhang	Lettuc3	off topic at this point
