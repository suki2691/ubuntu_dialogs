2009-09-30T20:44:00.000Z	NEWbuntu49589023		I have an older computer that has a AMD 3000+ 64bit process or with 1 gig of ram, using an AGP 6800 GT.. when I install Ubuntu 9.04 it goes smooth, when finished I wanted to turn on the graphical stuff, but get prompted to install Nvidia drivers... ok I do that... when the computer restarts it no longer uses the VGA port but wants to use the DVI port.. well my DVI port is bad on this one... how can I switch it????
