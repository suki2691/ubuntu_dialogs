2008-11-26T11:49:00.000Z	wit_273		In 8.10 there is a guest account that can be access through user switcher--it creates a new account each time a deletes all settings once the account logs out.  I am wanting to configure the account, but I do not know where it pulls the defaults from--does anyone know this?
