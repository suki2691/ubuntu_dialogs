2011-10-27T18:22:00.000Z	Yyharssargyhaell		I am having trouble getting Ubuntu to recognize my printer driver. I installed the printer driver, both the LPD and the cupswrapper, from the Brother website and Ubuntu continues to recommend the generic foomatic driver. Help?

2011-10-27T18:24:00.000Z	Yyharssargyhaell	usr13	I'm not familiar with what I should do with that. = /
2011-10-27T18:25:00.000Z	usr13	Yyharssargyhaell	Open Firefox, type  localhost:631  in address bar, hit enter.
