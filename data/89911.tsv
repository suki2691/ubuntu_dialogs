2008-12-17T21:33:00.000Z	Quagmire		Uh, maybe I should have referenced the question I had asked above my request. ...its further up the screen about hardware compatibility
2008-12-17T21:34:00.000Z	anirudh0	Quagmire	in general, most hardware is supported
2008-12-17T21:34:00.000Z	anirudh0	Quagmire	though support may be experimental for some
2008-12-17T21:35:00.000Z	anirudh0	Quagmire	if your piece of hardware is unlucky enough to be unsupported, most of the time you'll just have to wait for the next (many) kernel releases
