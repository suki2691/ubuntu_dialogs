2010-02-26T16:22:00.000Z	peleg_	rifter	I have upgraded from 7.10, and I am using VLC. At the moment I am trying to play it with mplayer to see if the problem exists also there.
2010-02-26T16:25:00.000Z	peleg_	rifter	actually, it looks like the problem does not occur using mplayer. So: is it possilbe that vlc has a problem due to the upgrade?
2010-02-26T16:26:00.000Z	peleg_	rifter	I see... have any idea how can I check that? How can I check what mixer does it use, and how can I check the mixer itself?
