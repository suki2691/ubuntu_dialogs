2012-08-13T09:23:00.000Z	GBGamer		Hey everybody, I need help. I just installed Ubuntu(from Mint, though I've used Ubuntu before 12.04) and I did the initial update, and one of the updates broke 3d unity. I can now only use Unity 2d.
2012-08-13T09:25:00.000Z	GBGamer		Is there anyway to roll back X.org or something?
2012-08-13T09:26:00.000Z	jrib	GBGamer	what do you mean "from Mint"?
2012-08-13T09:39:00.000Z	GBGamer	jrib	I came from Linux Mint.
