2009-10-31T02:19:00.000Z	Royall		Is there an easy way to change my main, root password (I know the current one)
2009-10-31T02:19:00.000Z	Bodsda	Royall	yes, but I am not allowed to tell you how
2009-10-31T02:32:00.000Z	Bodsda	Royall	that usually means synaptic/apt is already running
2009-10-31T02:32:00.000Z	Bodsda	Royall	log out then back in will probably resolve. Either that or delete the lockfile
