2007-10-21T05:50:00.000Z	yaloki	luislo	"make uninstall" if you still have the sources, or pray
2007-10-21T05:50:00.000Z	luislo	yaloki	I have them, hehe, and I did make uninstall... but then, how do I erase everything?
2007-10-21T05:50:00.000Z	yaloki	luislo	how do you mean, "everything" ? make uninstall supposedly removes everything it installs with make install
