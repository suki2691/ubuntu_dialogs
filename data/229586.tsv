2007-03-02T10:45:00.000Z	K3nto		is there a way to search multiple packages at the same time?
2007-03-02T10:46:00.000Z	K3nto		i have a huge list of packages to get
2007-03-02T10:46:00.000Z	K3nto		and to paste all of them individually into the search seems really trivial
2007-03-02T10:47:00.000Z	bimberi	K3nto	sudo apt-get install package1 package2 package3 ...
