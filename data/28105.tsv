2010-08-04T08:42:00.000Z	nphase		why does it say 64-bit ubuntu is not recommended for daily desktop use?
2010-08-04T08:43:00.000Z	texastwister	nphase	probably mostly a legacy recommendation from when 64-bit was a little buggy with spotty driver support, etc.
2010-08-04T08:43:00.000Z	nphase	texastwister	sure
2010-08-04T08:43:00.000Z	texastwister	nphase	I've been on 64 bit only for over a year with no complaints
