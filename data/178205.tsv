2009-01-06T04:53:00.000Z	FireStorm		something is wrong with my windows because the uninstaller of wubi doesnt work and the wubi installer doesnt work from the site AND on the cd so does anyone know what is required to run the wubi installer/uninstaller... files are md5 checked
2009-01-06T04:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	FireStorm	I wont use or recommend wubi..
2009-01-06T04:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	FireStorm	see the wubi factoid, in general we dont think too highly of it
2009-01-06T05:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	FireStorm	you dont need vbruntime to get wubi to run.
