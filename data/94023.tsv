2009-11-04T08:45:00.000Z	tc111	c0ld	i like jaunty and will probably leave a couple of my machine on jaunty for a while. Hardy Heron 8.04.3 LTS is very stable. karmic +1 (Lucid Lynx) will also be an LTS release (10.04 LTS) so if you choose to go with the 8.04.3 LTS, you'll only need to wait 6 months for the next LTS release.
