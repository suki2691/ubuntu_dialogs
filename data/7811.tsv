2011-11-13T00:49:00.000Z	peque_	pfifo	ok, perhaps for the next time (or if this doesn't work) :-)
2011-11-13T02:14:00.000Z	pfifo	peque_	lol exim4-light is all you need to get php's mail working
2011-11-13T02:15:00.000Z	peque_	pfifo	anyway, after that, I would like to configure a full mail server, so I would better do all the work now :-)
