2011-07-07T18:24:00.000Z	Broseph	pppZero	it's just one interface with a shared gateway and netmask, do I need to use the auto eth0:n notation?
2011-07-07T18:28:00.000Z	Broseph		say I have a block of 100 IPs, do I need 500 lines in my etc/network/interfaces
2011-07-07T18:29:00.000Z	pppZero	Broseph	only if you want all of those IPs to go to one machine / physical nic
