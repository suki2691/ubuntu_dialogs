2009-11-07T12:22:00.000Z	cousin_mario		can you recommend anything besides screenlets-sensors and gnome-sensors for displaying the system status?
2009-11-07T12:22:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	cousin_mario	conky with your own sensor script?
2009-11-07T12:23:00.000Z	cousin_mario	leaf-sheep	I'll have a look, thanks
