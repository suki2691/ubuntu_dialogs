2007-12-09T14:02:00.000Z	rgl_		I'm trying to install ubuntu in a raid, so I've downloaded the alternate install cd, but it installs X, is there other CD that can install to raid, but without X?
2007-12-09T14:03:00.000Z	astro76	rgl_	server install I believe
2007-12-09T14:04:00.000Z	astro76	rgl_	I wonder if minimal install cd can install to raid
