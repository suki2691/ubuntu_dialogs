2007-02-13T10:20:00.000Z	lineman60		I am running 6.06TLS ed. I was trying to get my wireless card to work, and some how i removed it.  Ubuntu no longer sees it in the network config tool and iwconfig shows no wireless devices.
2007-02-13T10:21:00.000Z	lineman60		is there an easy way to reload the wireless config
2007-02-13T10:21:00.000Z	n2diy	lineman60	did you ever have the card working?
2007-02-13T10:22:00.000Z	n2diy	lineman60	hmm, gl.
