2012-02-17T14:09:00.000Z	u890		hello, I want to convert images files from TIFF to JPG format. This command "convert *.tiff *.jpg" works, but leaves out filenames with spaces. How should I change that command to add files with spaces?

2012-02-17T14:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis	u890	 checkout  the various find examples and find  with spaces in filenames
