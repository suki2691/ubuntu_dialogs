2005-09-19T08:15:00.000Z	Waerner		Hi, back again :)           I have 2 questions, the fist one is simple: Is Ubuntu 5.10 supposed to be able to install via apt-get?
2005-09-19T08:15:00.000Z	tritium	Waerner	yes
2005-09-19T08:16:00.000Z	Waerner	tritium	it's just a matter of time? or should it appear there by now?
2005-09-19T08:16:00.000Z	tritium	Waerner	it won't appear.  you have to change your /etc/apt/sources.list file
