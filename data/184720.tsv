2012-09-14T04:13:00.000Z	ubuntugeek		hi #ubuntu, I work on webkit project (http://www.webkit.org). Earlier I was using 11.10 and recently shifted to 12.04. But I am experiencing the compilation is much slower in 12.04 than 11.10. Anybody facing the same issue during compile cycle with any projects?
2012-09-14T04:14:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	ubuntugeek	wasnt webkit unsupported by 12.04?
2012-09-14T04:15:00.000Z	ubuntugeek	lotuspsychje	in fact I have a situation where my gtk port only builds with 12.04 out of the box whereas 11.10 I need to handfix a lot of broken packages..:)
2012-09-14T04:19:00.000Z	ubuntugeek	lotuspsychje	sure.
