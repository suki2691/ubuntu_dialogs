2009-10-14T22:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Daremonai	You can get the name of the directory that the rar file is in by taking the path and running dirname then basename, so if you start with a variable "path" like: 'path=/foo/bar/foobar.rar' you can get the name of the directory, 'bar', with 'name="$( basename "$( dirname "$path" )" )"' Though there is probably a cleaner way to do that
