2010-07-10T08:36:00.000Z	Blazento		can someone please help me figure out why i can't enable networking?
2010-07-10T08:37:00.000Z	Blazento		I was able to connect to the internet a couple of hours ago. Then my battery ran out, i restarted, and now the networking button on the upper right hand corner won't show up. I try to toggle fn F11, and it still doesn't show up
2010-07-10T08:38:00.000Z	Blazento		yeah, 10 times maybe
2010-07-10T08:38:00.000Z	cellofellow	Blazento	that button is the Network Manager Applet. Try typing Alt+F2 and running nm-applet.
