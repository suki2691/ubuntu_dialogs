2007-08-04T07:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	snipex	 the idea of a 'bin' file is vague - its just a self installing executable.. so yes.
2007-08-04T07:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	snipex	 what .bin are ya trying to run?
2007-08-04T07:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	snipex	 its in the mediubuntu repository. no need to mess with the .bin
