2012-04-19T08:35:00.000Z	maheanuu		I have a problem with my Upgrades, I went down hard on this laptop I had a hard drive failure along with a cd/dvd rom drive failure at the same time...   I replaced the sata drive and then found that I could not boot as the cd/dvd rom was telling me there was no media in the drive...  I finally used a usb boot flash memory to get the laptop to finally accept a new version of Ubuntu (10.04.4 LTS 64 bit..   I like it a lot, but the upgrades
2012-04-19T08:35:00.000Z	maheanuu		 are failing

2012-04-19T08:39:00.000Z	maheanuu	cowboydren	 have went thru it with a fine tooth comb, and I have pretty well got it all diagnosed and the only problems were the early morning failures that took out the hard disk and I think at the same time took out the cdrom
