2007-11-29T23:15:00.000Z	zatic		my normal users don't have cmd line features like history, auto-completetion, but root does. what could be wrong? (server)
2007-11-29T23:17:00.000Z	pike_	zatic	are they using bash as default shell? maybe theyre in sh?
2007-11-29T23:17:00.000Z	zatic	pike_	bash, yes
2007-11-29T23:24:00.000Z	zatic	pike_	actually, I forgot to re-login after switching the users to bash...., thanks, works now
