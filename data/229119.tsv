2007-07-12T14:56:00.000Z	rolfen		btw i'm really surprised... why is my runlevel 2 and i'm running x and all... on fedora it was like 5
2007-07-12T14:56:00.000Z	mwe	rolfen	because it's default in ubuntu and runlevels don't differ much by default
2007-07-17T15:46:00.000Z	mwe	rolfen	install gtk-theme-switch then run 'gksudo switch2'
2007-07-17T15:46:00.000Z	mwe	rolfen	the theme for root is taking precedence
