2009-11-15T01:50:00.000Z	Billiard	craigbass1976	yes
2009-11-15T01:50:00.000Z	Billiard	craigbass1976	but if its dying idk how well it will work
2009-11-15T01:52:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Billiard	I can actually boot, but there's an issue (the drive is dying) but it mounts readonly.  I tried earlier writing out the dumps to a thumb drive (mounted in /mnt) but that too was read only.  Now that I'm at home (no customers busting in) I can probably dork with it enough to get it to write out
