2012-04-29T17:00:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Maya	blame Adobe for making substandard software
2012-04-29T17:01:00.000Z	Maya	Stereocaulon	Seriously. A lot of people has this problem and it seems to relate to gnome-do or unity. I don't have this problem in unity 2D.
2012-04-29T17:02:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Maya	sorry for my position on this, but on my box I see more "Sorry, the Flash plugin has crashed" then actual Flash content. That's why I blame Adobe.
