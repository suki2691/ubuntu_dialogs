2006-12-06T14:16:00.000Z	mooreand13213		is it hard to migrate from gnome to kde? i like the looks of kde better, but my comp doesn't like the kubuntu live cd
2006-12-06T14:17:00.000Z	nothlit	mooreand13213	it should be relatively simple
2006-12-06T14:17:00.000Z	nothlit	mooreand13213	theres equivalent apps and kde actually has more
2006-12-06T14:19:00.000Z	nothlit	mooreand13213	ok if you want just a functioning kde without anything else, install kdebase, if you want kubuntu, then install kubuntu-desktop, and if you want all of kde you install kde (you can use synaptic, but a command line package manager from a virtual console would be preferable)
