2007-11-02T23:09:00.000Z	dxdt	nedrik	I can do all of those with Rhythmbox and it is using 24 mb right now though...  hmmmm  I guess that is a little high, but my system doens't lag or anything.

I don't get foobar personally, I just ended up customizing it to do what a lot of players did off the bat and then one day I was like "Oh..."  I would suggest just opening synaptic and searching around for music and such
