2011-08-17T22:58:00.000Z	Ogi0n	rakathan	thank you, the reason I ask is because instead of creating a Guest account (non-admin) I'm thinking of creating a another partition so if I lend the computer to someone and they do something silly, it wont affect my main O.S., now I'm wondering if there's away to make a Guest non-admin account, reset everytime the computer is rebooted??
