2007-12-24T06:06:00.000Z	Smurf-Slayer		I can't get Pidgin GUI's to come up after upgrading to 7.10...  Apparently it replaced GAIM?  I know it is running in the background because I'm on on another machine, and message windows pop up on this one... But no GUI...

2007-12-24T06:10:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Smurf-Slayer	Hmm... What happens if you open up a terminal and run it from there?
2007-12-24T06:11:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Smurf-Slayer	That's fairly normal.
