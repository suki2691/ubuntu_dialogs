2012-04-18T02:23:00.000Z	zykotick9	joseph_	lol, good luck with that...  you have autologin enabled?
2012-04-18T02:25:00.000Z	zykotick9	joseph_	i don't think there is a "solution" to that.  If you turn off autologin, you won't get the keyring password.
2012-04-18T02:26:00.000Z	zykotick9	joseph_	i'd guess most users don't use autologin
