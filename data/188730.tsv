2010-01-04T00:56:00.000Z	pm		Hey, does ubuntu karmic server have pcmcia support built in? I can see a pcmcia card via lspci. does that mean pcmcia support works?

2010-01-04T00:57:00.000Z	XiXaQ	pm	I don't see why it wouldn't though.
2010-01-04T00:57:00.000Z	pm	XiXaQ	noone seems to answer there, but I#ll try again. thanks for your answer anyway.
