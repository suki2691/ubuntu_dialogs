2009-02-24T09:58:00.000Z	chu_		Hi, if I need a printer driver (CUPS BJC8200), is there an easy way (i.e. synaptic) I can get it?

2009-02-24T10:00:00.000Z	chu_		The CUPS BJC8200 driver works with mine, just wondering if there' an easier way to get it, I don't want to download it and have to dick around.
