2012-03-11T17:26:00.000Z	theadmin	Mikero	Is there "README", "INSTALL", "Makefile", "configure" or "configure.ac" (or a combination of those) among em?
2012-03-11T17:28:00.000Z	theadmin	Mikero	Uh, just do that then?
2012-03-11T17:28:00.000Z	theadmin	Mikero	Oh, you mean a universal place to put it to? Try /opt, that's what it's intended for (binary packages which unpack as one folder)
