2009-01-27T14:05:00.000Z	simion314		why now i need a invitation to enter #kubuntu+1?
2009-01-27T14:07:00.000Z	stdin	simion314	it's #ubuntu+1
2009-01-27T14:07:00.000Z	simion314	stdin	so #kubuntu+1 is not official?
2009-01-27T14:08:00.000Z	stdin	simion314	it should forward to #ubuntu+1, there is no separate channel for ubuntu/kubuntu with development releases
