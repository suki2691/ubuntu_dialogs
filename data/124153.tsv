2007-08-29T07:38:00.000Z	scalawag420		Can anyone tell me how to remove a package that doesn't seem to want to be removed?
2007-08-29T07:39:00.000Z	scalawag420		dpkg - how do I use that?  like apt-get remove?
2007-08-29T07:39:00.000Z	Truman_	scalawag420	If sudo apt-get remove doesn't work, you could try synaptic, find the package and "mark for complete removal" .. that worked for me
2007-08-29T07:39:00.000Z	scalawag420	Truman_	tried both, both give the same result
