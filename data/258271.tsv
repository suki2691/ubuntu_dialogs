2005-07-31T06:30:00.000Z	huttan		This is strange, I can find my accesspoint, the networkcard seems to work fine, everything is setup right and still I cant ping my router

2005-07-31T06:31:00.000Z	paulproteus	huttan	That sounds like the routes aren't working.
2005-07-31T06:31:00.000Z	huttan	paulproteus	any idea on how to fix it?
