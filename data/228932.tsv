2005-10-26T15:07:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt		Back in warty I used mplayer plugins of some sort for firefox.  In breezy I'm trying to give the defaults a chance.  What plugin do I need to watch a video clip on the CNN web page?

2005-10-26T15:10:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	TiMiDo	Hmm... mozilla-mplayer is already installed.  When I click on a video link, a window comes up, but then I get an error that says "Totem could not play 'fd://0'."
