2009-04-02T13:31:00.000Z	grandemahatma	sebsebseb	that's the plan
2009-04-02T13:31:00.000Z	grandemahatma		but since my htfs partition is bigger than my /home partition, I was thinking to move the whole /home in that partition
2009-04-02T13:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	grandemahatma	by the way only  a few weeks now, and Ubuntu 9.04  with optional Ext4 suppourt.  and for full  Ext4 you would have to put those partitiosn on, altough there is a way to get some of it's functionality with Ext3.   and  I am not sure if the dataloss issue is sorted out yet
