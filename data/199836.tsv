2006-04-15T10:24:00.000Z	stikif	intelikey	 isn't identd part of inetd i didn't think you had to install it as a seperate package
2006-04-15T10:26:00.000Z	intelikey	stikif	 idk  but there are sever identd apps listed in the repos,   i've never used it.  and know nothing about.   so i only asked if it was installed.  sorry to ask a foolish question.
