2008-06-01T07:14:00.000Z	wormz		Hey. My new laptop is a ntel(R) Core(TM) 2 Duo Processor T9300 with 4G of ram, to use all that ram I need to run 64 bit linux or use pae kernel (which never worked). What does anyone recommend???
2008-06-01T07:14:00.000Z	Ahadiel	wormz	I'd recommend 64-bit.
2008-06-01T07:15:00.000Z	wormz	Ahadiel	Though I assume the Intel(R) Core(TM) 2 Duo Processor T9300 is 32 bit, does that cause a problem?
2008-06-01T07:15:00.000Z	Ahadiel	wormz	The Core 2 Duo can support both 64 and 32-bit OSes.
