2008-07-01T23:25:00.000Z	RonLut		What's the advantages (if any) of not shuting down the computer every day (As I read some people saying about linux: "forget about shuting down your computer, you can work with it for months turned on")?

2008-07-01T23:27:00.000Z	RonLut	SRabbelier	ok... thanks anyway ;)
2008-07-01T23:27:00.000Z	SRabbelier	RonLut	well, that, and bragging rights ;)
