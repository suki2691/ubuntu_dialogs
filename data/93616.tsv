2009-09-27T03:45:00.000Z	Saladin		Heya people, I'm wondering if you can help me... For some reason unknown to me, my sudoers file has had its ownership changed from root to myself. I now can't do any admin tasks, and also cannot chown the file back to root. Any advice?

2009-09-27T03:46:00.000Z	Saladin	firecrotch	Yeah, good idea. Thank you...
