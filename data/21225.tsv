2010-12-29T05:07:00.000Z	Lxndr		My Ubuntu desktop computer refuses to boot (I get a 'Gave up waiting for root device.' error). It booted fine six days ago, before I shut it off to go spend holidays with my family. Now it fails. Please tell me how to get my desktop working again so I'm not stuck on my laptop.
