2008-03-19T07:40:00.000Z	Fishscene	Spagbol	why?
2008-03-19T07:41:00.000Z	Fishscene	Spagbol	the filesystem is considered to be good enough to not have to defrag
2008-03-19T07:41:00.000Z	Fishscene	Spagbol	I personally would think so too, but without a utility to view the fragmentation, I can only go by what others say
