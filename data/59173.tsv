2009-09-24T03:00:00.000Z	vock		I had a question: I went to the ubuntuone website, and installed the PPA from the link, and the repository shows up on software source, but Ubuntuone doesn't show up in Synaptic Package Manager, any ideas?
2009-09-24T03:01:00.000Z	VCoolio	vock	did you update? or press reload in synaptic?
2009-09-24T03:02:00.000Z	vock	VCoolio	reloaded and rebooted just to make sure :(
2009-09-24T03:03:00.000Z	VCoolio	vock	ah ok the reboot wasn't necessary; don't know then.
