2005-03-28T12:45:00.000Z	technomajian		Got a couple of questions to throw into the fray, though.  I'd like to get rid of OpenOffice -- want to install 1.1.4 -- but in order to remove the package using Synaptic, it wants to remove ubuntu-desktop as well.  How do I get around that?  Do I need to get around that?
2005-03-28T12:46:00.000Z	technomajian		Oh, oh, okay.  Thanks.
