2008-02-12T03:18:00.000Z	testic		I would like to install Apache httpd, I don't see it in the add/remove applications dialogue. I have no problems with compiling from source, but is that the best way forward?

2008-02-12T03:20:00.000Z	testic	erUSUL	thank you for that, it looks like what I need. But is that method of installing packages compatible with Applications > Add/Remove?
