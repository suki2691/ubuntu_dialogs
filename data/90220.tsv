2011-04-20T03:02:00.000Z	Berto		Hi - I got a cheap VPS and they're making me use my own nameserver.  It's ubuntu 10.04.  Are there docs on how to turn my VPS into a nameserver?
2011-04-20T03:04:00.000Z	minion35	Berto	use a public dns and domain name?
2011-04-20T03:05:00.000Z	Berto	minion35	don't i need admin access to point mydomain.com to my IP address?
2011-04-20T03:06:00.000Z	minion35	Berto	yeah you should.
