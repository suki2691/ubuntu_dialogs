2010-01-07T01:03:00.000Z	Rodensky		Hello ppl - ubuntu 9.04 - many times the sound suddenly stops working, what should I do?
2010-01-07T01:05:00.000Z	Rodensky		I restart my pc everytime in order to get the sound back on, untill the next time it goes off (laptop without external speakers, nothing muted)
2010-01-07T01:06:00.000Z	ubuntu__	Rodensky	do you have any idea what you do (open program etc...) that makes the speakers turn off?
2010-01-07T01:06:00.000Z	Rodensky	ubuntu__	- no, it happens randomly
