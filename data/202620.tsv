When i run firefox, azureus (any ther bittorrent) and firefox my system becomes slow until freezing point. since both system has the same prblem it has to by ubuntu.  anyone knows about this problem?

2006-06-13T10:53:00.000Z	krazykit	ranpha	and it doesn't happen if you don't do torrents?
2006-06-13T10:57:00.000Z	krazykit	ranpha	sounds like a networking problem then.  don't know what to say :-/
