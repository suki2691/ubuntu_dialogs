2007-10-20T08:01:00.000Z	Shoopuf		I'm sitting here right now using the 7.10 Live CD ready to install. I've reached the "partitions" part and don't know what to do. I only have 1 hard disk, it is currently formatted as NTFS and it has Windows XP on it. I want to install Ubuntu now but don't want to erase the stuff on the old partition. Should I "Manual" partition or "Guided?"
