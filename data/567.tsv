2012-10-29T11:02:00.000Z	Naddy	somsip	yes - that was basically what I am trying to do but I need it to be sort of conditional - and so I have the perl script that decides whether to do it
2012-10-29T11:04:00.000Z	Naddy	somsip	you have it - and looking at the gdm script I see that the problem is that it is now an alias to upstart and so we do need to ensure that the name is right
