2008-01-16T17:39:00.000Z	Ziroday	mutable	on boot up you can press alt+f1 to get verbose messages
2008-01-16T17:40:00.000Z	mutable	Ziroday	no, i want bootsplash !
2008-01-16T17:40:00.000Z	Ziroday	mutable	then you simply change your usplash theme to one that supports showing of verbose messages, its easy to install usplash themes with SUM
