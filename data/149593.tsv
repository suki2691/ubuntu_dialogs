2011-04-13T19:19:00.000Z	blueghost		An idea. Can develop an application, mixing multiple sources based on different package management. Such as yum, abs, apt. A program can install the different packages. For example, a software package provided only fedora. But I want to install under ubuntu. This program can be installed from the fedora source.
