2011-02-06T08:14:00.000Z	HowardTheDuck		i plan on buying a 2tb 4k sector hard dive to use as a media/storage drive on my win7/ubuntu 10.04 dual boot system.  do i need to worry about these alignment issues if i'm only using it for data, no os?
2011-02-06T08:14:00.000Z	HowardTheDuck		im a bit confused

2011-02-06T08:17:00.000Z	HowardTheDuck	Jordan_U	okay thanks...now i'm going to be formatting this drive as ntfs of course, so my windows partition can read it too.
