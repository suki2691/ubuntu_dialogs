2007-10-17T23:12:00.000Z	swatF1RESTORM	PriceChild	I tried the eth0 down/up and that didn't work. gonna try the network restart
2007-10-17T23:15:00.000Z	swatF1RESTORM	PriceChild	when I look at the /etc/network/interfaces it has all my correct network settings but still can't get to my network. any more ideas?
