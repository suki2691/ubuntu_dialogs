2010-02-05T09:29:00.000Z	rahduke		can anyone confirm that this bug is legit? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/481432 and if so is there any fix?
2010-02-05T09:30:00.000Z	mezquitale	rahduke	it's legit, it used to happen to me, i bought a new router, been a happy camper ever since
2010-02-05T09:31:00.000Z	rahduke	mezquitale	umm a new router is not an option, is there any work around?
2010-02-05T09:32:00.000Z	mezquitale	rahduke	you need to look at the thread in launchpad and participate, that's the workaround
