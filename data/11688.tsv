2011-07-24T12:30:00.000Z	lion42		I am still trying to figure out if it is possible to disable my cd drive from responding without actually, physically removing it. It has an easy trigger and keeps popping out, and I fear I will break it unintentionally if this continues.
2011-07-24T12:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	lion42	 you mean the actual eject button is very senesetive?
2011-07-24T12:31:00.000Z	lion42	dr_willis	yes.
2011-07-24T12:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	lion42	 is the case one of those that has a 'fake' front over the actual cd face? i had a case once with a bad design. button was to tight on the 'real' button
