2012-10-23T14:05:00.000Z	DocBarretta		I am trying to build ChromiumOS onto my netbook and seem to be working in circles. I get to the step where I need to download the sourcecode onto my netbook and each time, I get an error telling me "repo" is not a valid command when it was supposed to be installed in step 2 and from what I can see, it was done so sucessfully
2012-10-23T14:06:00.000Z	bin_bash	DocBarretta	repo is not a recognized command.
2012-10-23T14:11:00.000Z	bin_bash	DocBarretta	just install chrome
2012-10-23T14:13:00.000Z	bin_bash	DocBarretta	why are you asking about chromiumOS here?
