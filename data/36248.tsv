2010-03-04T12:46:00.000Z	darolu	nsitin	it depends on the blog, sometimes [code], others you have to write the styles; most blogs have a "code" button
2010-03-04T12:46:00.000Z	nsitin	darolu	like [code] #include<ios.. > [/code] ?
2010-03-04T12:47:00.000Z	darolu	nsitin	yeah, that's used on forums mostly, but I've seen some blogs that use the same syntax; it can be different though, look for a "insert code" button
