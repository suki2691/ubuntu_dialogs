2008-02-21T11:51:00.000Z	aperson		I just installed Ubuntu from Vista. I didn't back anything up and don't even have a windows back up CD. What I Want to know is how can I get back to Vista, my biggest fear is that ubuntu formated my HDD and installed itself. I've tried using the boot menu then hard drive boot but all that comes up is Ubuntu which I currently don't want.

2008-02-21T11:54:00.000Z	aperson		I believe I've tried that

Great I hate Ubuntu now.
