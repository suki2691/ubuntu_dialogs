2007-12-20T14:12:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	luke-jr	well then I have no idea what happened, because the optional parameter that allowed ubuntu to boot existed in the menu.lst file before the last bug fix for the kernel two or so days ago, now it's not appearing in either menu.lst file, and Ubuntu won't boot at all.....
