2010-05-23T10:14:00.000Z	jmichaelx		chromium browser makes a stupid sound whenever one of its window buttons is clicked. could someone tell me how i could make it stop doing this?
2010-05-23T10:15:00.000Z	Wyzerd	jmichaelx	open the sound preferences (applet in panel) and choose to not have sounds on.
2010-05-23T10:16:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Wyzerd	i have already selected that... problem is, i use kubuntu (but have gnome installed as well)
2010-05-23T10:18:00.000Z	jmichaelx	Wyzerd	without gnome installed, kubuntu does not do this. however, with gnome installed, chromioum browser and firefox both make these stupid sounds, even if they are turned off in gnome.
