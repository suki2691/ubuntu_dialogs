2008-01-05T08:42:00.000Z	dhamma		no one here is good w/ piping commands?
2008-01-05T08:43:00.000Z	dhamma		i want to find all my oggs, then run vorbisgain on them
2008-01-05T08:43:00.000Z	Pici	dhamma	just do: find ~/ -type f -name *.ogg -exec vorbisgain {} -whatever
2008-01-05T08:43:00.000Z	dhamma	Pici	i was using | xargs...maybe that's what the problem was
