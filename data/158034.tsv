2012-11-07T18:50:00.000Z	ert3go		Hello , can someone tell me how to convert a postcript file to a text file ?
2012-11-07T18:50:00.000Z	Slart	ert3go	isn't there a ps2ascii app or something similar?
2012-11-07T18:51:00.000Z	Slart	ert3go	try the one theadmin linked you to instead
2012-11-07T18:56:00.000Z	Slart	ert3go	what's wrong with "sudo apt-get install ps2txt" ?
