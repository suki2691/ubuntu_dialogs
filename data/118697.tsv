2008-02-07T18:52:00.000Z	Feanix	bazhang	thanks I am trying that right now. The program displayed several dialogs which I could confirm with ok, but now it is displaying one again, and it does not react to any keypress?

2008-02-07T19:25:00.000Z	Feanix	bazhang	Thanks a lot, "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" worked! I had to guess the answer to most questions, I hope I did not screw anything up, but the display wokrs great again!
