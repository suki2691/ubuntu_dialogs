2007-10-23T12:49:00.000Z	dxdt	zoidberg_	yes and no.  Newest ones can sometimes be choppy, older versions of the wmv play the best.  For the most part, yes.
2007-10-23T12:50:00.000Z	zoidberg_	dxdt	i'm trying to play this.wmv from this website and i'm suing the firefox mediaplayerconnectivy plugin but vlc popsup but wont play it?
2007-10-23T12:51:00.000Z	dxdt	zoidberg_	oooh..  I dunno.  I have bad luck with stuffs over the net so I'm not a good person to ask.  If I were you I would try to download the file and see if it would then play.  If it doesn't there, you might get more info at least.
