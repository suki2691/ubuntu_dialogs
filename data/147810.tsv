2007-02-06T14:38:00.000Z	Jowi	hitammanis	maybe you have better luck asking in #windows or in a qemu forum
2007-02-06T14:39:00.000Z	hitammanis	Jowi	Tried #qemu it does not seem to be a qemu problem... ps. they were very helpfull
2007-02-06T14:40:00.000Z	Jowi	hitammanis	I think most people here run ubuntu natively. or maybe run win98 in qemu under linux. not very likely the other way around...
