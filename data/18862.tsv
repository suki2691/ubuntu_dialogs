2012-07-28T14:27:00.000Z	scottj		is there a command that given say foo.log it will return 5 if there's a foo.log.4?
2012-07-28T14:28:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	scottj	 not a command, you need a script
2012-07-28T14:28:00.000Z	scottj	MonkeyDust	is there some syntax in bash for that or do I have to write the code myself?
2012-07-28T14:29:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	scottj	 i know the principle, not the syntax, better ask in the channel #bash
