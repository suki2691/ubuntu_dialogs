2010-12-26T10:57:00.000Z	iKitsune		Is there a way to make 10.10 use a normal xorg.conf?
2010-12-26T10:58:00.000Z	rigved	iKitsune	normal as in the one used by failsafex mode?
2010-12-26T10:58:00.000Z	iKitsune	rigved	normal as in the kind xorg/X11 used since the dawn of time
2010-12-26T10:59:00.000Z	rigved	iKitsune	fail safe X mode is just about that. copy the xorg.conf.failsafe to xorg.conf
