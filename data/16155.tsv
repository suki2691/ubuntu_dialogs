2011-04-05T19:16:00.000Z	crashus		no- iÂ´m using windows 7. i made partitions for ubuntu already. if i try instaling it in windows thru wubi, I can choose the correct partitions and start instalation, but I either get stuck at creating virtual disks, or get a root filesistem not set error later
2011-04-05T19:16:00.000Z	crashus		if I boot from usb or cd, I can only choose the entire disk for installation and would lose win 7 and all files
2011-04-05T19:17:00.000Z	crashus		if i try manually set partitions, they are not there
2011-04-05T19:17:00.000Z	waynerr	crashus	what kind of partitions did you create for ubuntu ?
