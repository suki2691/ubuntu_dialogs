2011-05-29T02:28:00.000Z	russjr08		Hey guys, I have a problem. I just bought a SanDisk Ultra Backup flashdrive, and when I plug it in, it doesn't automount. All of my other flashdrives do and this flashdrive automounts in Windows, can someone tell me if it's possible to fix
2011-05-29T02:29:00.000Z	russjr08		ok
