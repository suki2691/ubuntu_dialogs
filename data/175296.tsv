2007-01-24T08:38:00.000Z	fm		I opened a VNC session on a box on my local network, I can see the remote desktop, but I cannot move the mouse or type from my computer on the remote one... the server is "vino" I guess, and I use vncviewer as a client
2007-01-24T08:38:00.000Z	falz	fm	are you sure the vnc server isn't set to a read only mode?
2007-01-24T08:39:00.000Z	fm	falz	I think it isnt, chacked the "allow other users to control your desktop" box
