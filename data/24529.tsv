In Windows no matter which driver you use (and I doubt they are open source) you can manage them from the exact same spot (at least the basic functions) without problem, in Linux with the proprietary drivers you always need to rely on those shitty tools they bring with

2011-04-29T01:33:00.000Z	BajK	tensorpudding	as I said: in windos no matter which driver you use, you can change screen resolution and everything by using the Desktop settings while in Linux you always have to rely on the tools the driver makers provide
2011-04-29T01:33:00.000Z	tensorpudding	BajK	i'm pretty sure that the Resolution thing works with any driver you want
