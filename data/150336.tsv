2011-10-12T00:47:00.000Z	aarcane		Hi, I'm interrested in setting up my own private cloud, and I have two machines to host  the cloud and I want them to be "fully redundant", IE if either fails, the other will be able to run the cloud...  guests?  Is that the right term?  without batting an eyelash.  a few minutes of downtime is acceptible, but failover has to be autonomous to be worth my time implementing it.
2011-10-12T00:47:00.000Z	aarcane		Is the UEC software capable of handling this sort of setup, including data replication?  I've been browsing the manuals and have yet to identify an answer.

2011-10-12T00:47:00.000Z	aarcane	Pici	I figured, but if anyone here knows, I'd still love an answer.
