2008-03-30T23:54:00.000Z	Oasys		I have a noob question, what programing language would I have to learn to edit the ubuntu code?
2008-03-30T23:54:00.000Z	dxdt	Oasys	well, lots.  It is more than just one language, I would say look into Python + GTK and Mono + GTK
2008-03-30T23:55:00.000Z	Oasys	simplexio	the operating system
2008-03-30T23:56:00.000Z	dxdt	Oasys	still unclear lol.  Your desktop apps can be written in Python, Mono, etc.  While the kernel is written in C.  Deskbar is written in mono for example.  So is F-Spot  ( I think)
