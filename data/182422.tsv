2006-07-18T10:23:00.000Z	rebelfallen		I have a USB external Hard drive. Is it possible to somehow have it running as well as my current hard drive running, and switch over to it like a VNC between computers... ?

2006-07-18T10:27:00.000Z	rebelfallen	stefg	 I want to be able to swap over to my other hard drive that runs a separate operating system. Right now I have to restart, switch the hard drive boot sequence in the bios and login. I want to be able to login to ubuntu on the USB drive while running my current internal hard drive
