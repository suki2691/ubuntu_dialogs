2005-04-09T15:01:00.000Z	bitar		i'm trying to change my network settings in Ubuntu, but it's tell me that i don't have enough proviliges :S .. so i thought of logging in is as the root... but the password is not working.. is there a default password for the root?
2005-04-09T15:01:00.000Z	bitar		still not allowed...
