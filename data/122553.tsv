2009-06-03T11:24:00.000Z	Anixx		Hi.  I'm running Ubuntu-EEE on my Acer Aspire One.  Before I installed that, it had a different version of linux, and everything worked.  Now, everything works except for wifi.  Not sure what steps to take to troubleshoot this?  It's weird though, b/c there is an on/off switch for wifi, with lights, but now it won't even light up.  It light up before with the other version of linux.
