2010-07-14T00:10:00.000Z	Ademan		is there a FUSE filesystem I can use to create a union of two directories? ideally I could do this in the same directory (but I had a memory that just doesn't work) ie, ${HOME}/Music merge "in place" with /media/remote/Music or something

2010-07-14T00:10:00.000Z	Underbyte		gunt: why? j/c
2010-07-14T00:11:00.000Z	Ademan	Underbyte	hah, that's a little more work, and a little too permanent, but thanks
