2006-09-22T15:14:00.000Z	neildarlow		i want to configure a rt2570-based USB NIC with WPA-PSK. any pointers please
2006-09-22T15:16:00.000Z	POVaddct	neildarlow	i don't know if it's possible at all. i also have rt2570-based usb-wlan here (d-link dwl-g122 rev.b1)
2006-09-22T15:17:00.000Z	POVaddct	neildarlow	the readme file in the rt2570 sources documents some iwpriv commands for WPA, but they seem to be wrong or outdaten
