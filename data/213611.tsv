2006-04-25T12:42:00.000Z	VSFH		I got a question for anyone who knows a bit about wvdial / gnomeppp
2006-04-25T12:44:00.000Z	VSFH		question on wvdial / gnomeppp -- running wvdial from a terminal will get me online (most the time), running gnomeppp (with the same settings, analog modem, stupid mode on, check carrier off) will not get me online
2006-04-25T12:44:00.000Z	VSFH		I had to chmod +s wvdial so that it would run as root, otherwise it can't open the modem. any ideas ?
2006-04-25T12:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	VSFH	Same happened for me.  I just used wvdial.
