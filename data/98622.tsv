2008-10-12T03:03:00.000Z	Slart	[T]ank	I think there's a cedega channel somewhere.. might have better luck there
2008-10-12T03:04:00.000Z	[T]ank	Slart	there is... but this is something ubuntu specific if anyone here has successfully run cedega on ubuntu 8
2008-10-12T03:04:00.000Z	Slart	[T]ank	well, it was just a suggestion.. you're free to ask whereever you want =)
