2009-08-06T21:35:00.000Z	firecrotch	LastExyle	A script that runs at login that runs the following command: at now + 1 hour /sbin/shutdown
2009-08-06T21:36:00.000Z	firecrotch	LastExyle	or /sbin/reboot
2009-08-06T21:36:00.000Z	LastExyle	firecrotch	thanks. pardon the newbie question, but where would I put such a script?
