2010-08-23T19:14:00.000Z	rypervenche		Hello all. I have a question for anyone available.
2010-08-23T19:15:00.000Z	rypervenche		I have a program installed on my computer and I wanted to manually install a newer version of it not available in the Ubuntu repositories. I tried to do it using ./configure then make then make install, but it did not work. How can I remove any changes that that may have had?
2010-08-23T19:16:00.000Z	rypervenche		Is anyone available to help me with this?
2010-08-23T19:16:00.000Z	Stavros	rypervenche	you need to do it by hand
