2010-01-10T23:14:00.000Z	LinuxAdmin		I'm finding myself questioning why have I installed ubuntu in vmware environment without trouble and did the same with ubuntu server, but this time the graphcal system did not work at the first time
2010-01-10T23:16:00.000Z	LinuxAdmin		I really like the command line, but there are some circunstances where a graphical interface is welcome, even in a server environment
2010-01-10T23:17:00.000Z	LinuxAdmin		for example a server that hosts virtual machines
