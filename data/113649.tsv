2007-12-12T12:35:00.000Z	generalsnus		im having a hard time trying to encode mpeg 2 videos into wma/xvid on my x64 WinXP.. is there any better in ubuntu x64?

2007-12-12T12:39:00.000Z	generalsnus	ere4si	i cant encode it at all.. i get a error that a codec is missing.. so what i need is a mpeg 2 codec that is written for x64
