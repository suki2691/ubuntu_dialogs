2010-02-20T10:56:00.000Z	LINUXHELPNEEDED		When I right click on my desktop nothing pops up, I dont get the menu popping up!? How do I go about getting that to work again?

2010-02-20T10:58:00.000Z	knoppies	LINUXHELPNEEDED	then it sounds like you are not using nautilus to render your desktop, give me a sec while I go find the correct setting.
