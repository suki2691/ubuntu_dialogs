2012-01-31T21:01:00.000Z	craven222		I was typing 'passwd' instead of 'passwd [USERNAME]'
2012-01-31T21:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	craven222	then log in as a user whom can use sudo and lock the account
2012-01-31T21:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	craven222	tell the user who set the password that they are a fool
