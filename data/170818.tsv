2007-03-22T07:11:00.000Z	teenbeat		and how do i do that i know nothing of compiling and stuff
2007-03-22T07:11:00.000Z	pluma	teenbeat	open a console and say "man mount"
2007-03-22T07:24:00.000Z	pluma	teenbeat	I think so. You can switch to the console regardless, though. Unless the vga mess actually locks your box up.
