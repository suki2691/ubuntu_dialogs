2006-04-06T09:29:00.000Z	samalex		hello -- I installed ubuntu on my powermac g3, but there's no gcc...  can I not compile apps on linux running on powerpc?
2006-04-06T09:30:00.000Z	samalex		ahh, thanks :)
2006-04-06T09:31:00.000Z	samalex		do most apps compile fine on linux running powerpc processor, or is there a difference between apps written for x86 and ppc?
2006-04-06T09:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	samalex	not in most apps
