2012-06-06T10:17:00.000Z	NeoMorph4000		what can I do to speed up my pentium 4 with 512MB ram on ubuntu 11.10?
2012-06-06T10:19:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	NeoMorph4000	I've seen ubuntu run on some fairly slow hardware, 90% of the time there are performance issues, it's lack or RAM
2012-06-06T10:20:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	NeoMorph4000	and it's not even entirely ubuntu's fault. firefox and thunderbird both like about 200MB each on their own
2012-06-06T10:24:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	NeoMorph4000	depending on what sites you visit, addblock-plus and noscript will make a HUGE difference (they do for me)
