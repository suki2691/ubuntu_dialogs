2010-05-04T11:47:00.000Z	phoenix_srv		one more question, for whoever's able to answer it
2010-05-04T11:47:00.000Z	phoenix_srv		why is the grub in ubuntu 10.04 so slow?
2010-05-04T11:47:00.000Z	phoenix_srv		like, it hangs for at least 10 seconds before booting into windows
2010-05-04T11:48:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	phoenix_srv	 Are you talking about booting up the first time after installing 10.04, or is this slow-down happening every time
