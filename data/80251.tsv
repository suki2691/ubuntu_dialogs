2012-09-30T02:05:00.000Z	Walex	Gycklarn	that's a very, very complicated story.
2012-09-30T02:05:00.000Z	Walex	Gycklarn	there is a large difference between the X selection and copy operations.
2012-09-30T02:06:00.000Z	Walex	Gycklarn	the selection mechanism is not a copy-and-paste mechanism as in Other GUIs.
