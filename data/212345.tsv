2005-10-16T16:29:00.000Z	daxxar	asraniel	also, you could just do chmod go+rwX -R /path/to/stuff
2005-10-16T16:30:00.000Z	daxxar	asraniel	if it's fat, you should put this into the options of the mount: umask=000, but you're better off doing uid=someUser,gid=someGroup,umask=007, then just make sure everyone that needs rwx is in someGroup. (:
