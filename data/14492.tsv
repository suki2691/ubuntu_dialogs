2011-06-27T02:39:00.000Z	brian_lim		hi: not sure if this is the right place to ask, but does anyone know of a mysql tutorial which shows how to install multiple, standalone instances of mysql from source which does not install a background daemon
2011-06-27T02:40:00.000Z	brian_lim		basically my idea is to install many different mysql instances maybe on a usb key so I can use different ones for different purposes
