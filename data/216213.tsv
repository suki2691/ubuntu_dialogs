2006-06-04T10:05:00.000Z	DShepherd	siimo	it depends what desktop manager you like best... xubuntu is lighter so it may be nicer to older hardware
2006-06-04T10:06:00.000Z	siimo	DShepherd	irrelevant , just what software is included etc..
2006-06-04T10:06:00.000Z	DShepherd	siimo	oh.. well hmm..... ubuntu maybe... they are all good :-)
