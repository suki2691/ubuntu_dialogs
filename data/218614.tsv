2007-08-10T07:12:00.000Z	bentob0x		I always used apt-get instead of aptitude and I installed apache and apache2 which I want to clear both perfectly before reinstalling apache2
2007-08-10T07:13:00.000Z	bentob0x		but as I installed apache and apache2 with apt-get, I think aptitude can't find what to purge
2007-08-10T07:13:00.000Z	sipior	bentob0x	safest just to purge with apt-get, surely?
