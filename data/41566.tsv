2012-01-28T19:16:00.000Z	ssta		I guess a 6month releasse cycle doesn't give time to test upgrade path properly
2012-01-28T19:18:00.000Z	izinucs	ssta	releases between LTS releases are not necessarily stable
2012-01-28T19:18:00.000Z	ssta	izinucs	yeah.  It's a tradeoff.  Fast release cycle means newer stuff, but maybe less stability
