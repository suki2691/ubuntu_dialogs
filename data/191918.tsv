2006-04-11T08:51:00.000Z	ibob63		my installation of suse linux crashed - so i'm moving over to ubuntu. I have recovered my home directory but don't know how to restore the evolution mail. Can anyone tell me how to do this?
2006-04-11T08:52:00.000Z	orbin	ibob63	copy your ~/.evolution folder over?
2006-04-11T08:52:00.000Z	ibob63	orbin	I've done that but evolution just goes to the configuration wizard
2006-04-11T08:54:00.000Z	orbin	ibob63	worth a shot
