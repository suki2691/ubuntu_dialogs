2009-08-19T06:57:00.000Z	Jimmio		Hello everyone! I just installed 9.10 A4, and other than a few minor annoyances, is it okay to use as a main OS? I mean, PulseAudio crashed once... and the keyring is a little annoying, but otherwise everything works.

2009-08-19T06:58:00.000Z	MsMaco	Jimmio	but yeah ive been using since alpha 1 without much issue
2009-08-19T06:58:00.000Z	MsMaco	Jimmio	well... my main issues seem to be fixed in the most recent kernel
