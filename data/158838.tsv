2009-05-22T03:15:00.000Z	Lone_Pedo		I'm having trouble getting 3d graphics to work on my older computer running Jaunty. Graphics is Intel 82810 DC-133 integrated. I've read that the newer version is causing some problems. Is there a fix for this older machine?

2009-05-22T03:16:00.000Z	Slart	Lone_Pedo	if you're experiencing the intel driver bug thingy
