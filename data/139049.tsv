2009-06-09T03:11:00.000Z	onexused		I see mention of a kernel patch to use tuxonice, in the description for tuxonice-userui.  Can I get this through apt?  What's it called, if so?

2009-06-09T03:14:00.000Z	onexused	erUSUL	Okay.  Is the .config file for Ubuntu's default kernel stored anywhere, so I don't have to configure as much?
