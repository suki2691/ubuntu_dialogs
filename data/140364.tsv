2007-10-18T20:03:00.000Z	JuJuBee		I finally got my dual head settings working after  much frustration.  When I restart, the settings are all messed up and I need to reconfigure x and redo the settings to get dual head working again.  How can I ensure the current settings work upon restart?
2007-10-18T20:03:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	JuJuBee	what application are you using to set it up?
2007-10-18T20:04:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	JuJuBee	does aticonfig have a save to Xorg.conf button?
2007-10-18T20:05:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	JuJuBee	sorry, can't help then...  I am an an Nvidia Chic. :)  The answer lies in saving all those changes to your Xorg.conf, but the path is a mystery.
