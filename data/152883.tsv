2007-09-22T12:58:00.000Z	Yasumoto	ianmcorvidae	yeah, apparently there's a bug which prevents meta key combinations from working in an xterm
2007-09-22T12:59:00.000Z	ianmcorvidae	pyr3	Huh, ok. Well, Alt *sometimes* works, then, for those not enamored of Esc :)
2007-09-22T12:59:00.000Z	Yasumoto	ianmcorvidae	& pyr3: yeah, I usually use alt. thanks a bunch guys :)
