2006-11-30T09:27:00.000Z	jumble		so i have a simple help question. i find the nuts and bolts of ubuntu very confusing because i dont understand anything about how the OS works, ie the filesystem, the partioning, the shell, etc.etc. all this i understand in windows and it makes things a lot easier. the ubuntu docs don't seem to have this basic information about the OS - do you guys know some online tutorial that can lay this stuff out for me?
