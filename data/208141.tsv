2005-11-08T15:16:00.000Z	loufoque		I'm having a problem with gcc. "g++ test.cpp -o test" works but "gcc test.cpp -o test" gives me errors (undefined references to std::cout etc.). It works if I do "gcc test.cpp -o test -lstdc++". Someone has an idea how to fix that ?

2005-11-08T15:17:00.000Z	loufoque		gcc should call the appropriate compiler based on the file extension
