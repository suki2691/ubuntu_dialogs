2010-01-26T22:10:00.000Z	sebdah		Hi guys! I have a set up much like this one http://people.apache.org/~mturk/docs/article/fig3.gif. And the applications running on the Tomcats can _not_ run in parallell. So I would like to have some kind of master/slave functionality in Apache. Suggestions?
2010-01-26T22:10:00.000Z	sebdah		I have been looking at mod_proxy_balancer, which I am using for other real load balancing purposes, but I can't really see a way to totally disable one Tomcat while the first one is up and running.
