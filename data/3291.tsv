2012-05-03T20:40:00.000Z	jgharris	Captain_Proton	Try F6 at boot and add the option nomodeset to the boot line. Wouldn't work on my MacBook unless I did that.
2012-05-03T20:41:00.000Z	Captain_Proton	jgharris	I will give that a try
2012-05-03T20:42:00.000Z	Captain_Proton	jgharris	is it shift to break the boot process
