2009-10-24T05:18:00.000Z	xocite	Samus_Aran	what do you mean 'in theory'?
2009-10-24T05:19:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	xocite	that means "it should".  upgrades in Ubuntu are not always perfectly smooth, though they are supposed to be.  my recommendation is before you do any distro-upgrade to turn off the repositories such as multiverse/universe/and other personal ones
