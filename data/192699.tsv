2006-03-31T06:55:00.000Z	damian_		hi just wondering what that smb mount script is? The one that adds everything automatically to my fstab after a few questions
2006-03-31T06:57:00.000Z	damian_		whats wrong with this fstab line: //192.168.1.6/backups        /media/backup  smbfs ,dmask=777,fmask=777   0       0
2006-03-31T06:58:00.000Z	Arrick	damian_	get rid of the s on backups
