2009-04-22T08:24:00.000Z	juls4		Hey guys, after replacing my xorg.conf file with one NVIDIA settings wrote my pc keeps starting up with 1600x1050 instead of 1650x1050. It's out of range and it kind of makes my monitor go nuts. I've tried selecting both 1650x1050 & auto select (replacing xorg.conf file each time) but it still reverts back to 1600x1050. Any suggestions?
