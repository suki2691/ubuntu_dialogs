2010-09-10T05:22:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	bitreader	have you tried Netbeans?
2010-09-10T05:22:00.000Z	bitreader	sinisterstuf	that's exactly what I'm going to install. Yet, I was recommended to do it with the .sh from the netbeans website instead of the ubuntu packages.
2010-09-10T05:25:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	bitreader	I don't remember what I did. I probably installed it with synaptic, works fine.
