2004-12-09T12:39:00.000Z	guile		help needed: when i boot using ubuntu live CD, it loads up, and then monitor goes in sleep mode. i can still use the menus and hear clicks on using the mouse and kbd. is it due to lack of drivers for monitor? same thing happ with mandarke.
2004-12-09T12:41:00.000Z	guile		monitor's model is LG Studioworks 44i. pretty popular. so i guess the drivers would've been included with CD. but why does it go dark then?

2004-12-09T12:43:00.000Z	KneelBeforeXorg	guile	have you tried turning off the xdmcp or whatever it is?
