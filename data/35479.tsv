2010-10-14T18:12:00.000Z	PDani		I installed a python module from deb, which puts the python source into /usr/share/pyshared dir. But when i try to import this module from python2.5, it can't find the module. why isn't the default behaviour of python2.5 to look after modules in pyshared, and how can i reach this behaviour in debian-way?
