2012-04-01T03:37:00.000Z	Felishia		I'm tired of going to a cyber cafe to download as many packages (deb) as I can and then when i go home I notice there's always a another deb I need, and then again and again, and it's been like that the whole day :(
2012-04-01T03:38:00.000Z	Felishia		isn't there a easier way?
