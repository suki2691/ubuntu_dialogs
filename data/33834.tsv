2010-04-27T00:13:00.000Z	ZeroCool		Hello, planning to install Ubuntu on one of my computers.  Should I wait for 10.04 release, or is the RC about the same.  What is the difference between the two anyways?  Should I wait the 3 days, or is upgrading from RC to the release easy enough?  Any suggestions?
