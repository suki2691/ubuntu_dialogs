2009-09-12T00:39:00.000Z	G_A_C	Yorub	I've done many dist-upgrades in place with barely a problem
2009-09-12T00:39:00.000Z	Yorub	G_A_C	Then I guess you just know how to fix the small but annoying bugs that come with each upgrade.
2009-09-12T00:40:00.000Z	G_A_C	Yorub	I don't think I've ever had any problems specifically with an upgrade. Whenever I've had problems with a new version, it's a problem that woul dhave occurred with a fresh install as well (such as the Intel graphics performance regressions in Jaunty)
2009-09-12T00:41:00.000Z	Yorub	G_A_C	It's exactly fresh installs that I'm complaining about (too).
