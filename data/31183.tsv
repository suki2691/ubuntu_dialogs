2010-05-27T18:35:00.000Z	Psy-T		Hey, how do I set up a simple shortcut to start a Terminal with?
2010-05-27T18:35:00.000Z	Pici	Psy-T	Look in System > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts
2010-05-27T18:36:00.000Z	Psy-T	Pici	- went there, I just don't know what I'm supposed to be triggering by name... I tried to call it a terminal, that wasna't it :p
2010-05-27T18:36:00.000Z	Pici	Psy-T	I thought there was already something there for a terminal? If not, just use 'gnome-terminal' as the application name.
