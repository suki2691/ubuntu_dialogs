2005-12-25T15:26:00.000Z	cmatheson_	mcphail	you can deny hosts based on ip address etc. in your apache.conf
2005-12-25T15:27:00.000Z	mcphail	cmatheson_	yes, but is there a daemon which will monitor and automatically block these? DenyHosts is simple.
2005-12-25T15:27:00.000Z	cmatheson_	mcphail	i don't know anything automatic
