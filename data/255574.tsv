2006-08-23T05:58:00.000Z	mcphail	chantron	broken X, passwords logged in plain text, etc
2006-08-23T06:07:00.000Z	mcphail	chantron	i think a debate about a broken GUI is rather topical today
2006-08-23T06:08:00.000Z	mcphail	chantron	we're debating whether an update process which breaks X is a significant systems failure
