2005-01-06T14:26:00.000Z	Blackwell		do i need to restart the pc to restart xfree86/gdm? i tried "/etc/init.d/gdm restart" but that reports "[fail] ". looking at /var/log/gdm/:0.log i see seemingly entries from before trying to restart it.
2005-01-06T14:27:00.000Z	Blackwell		also, the virtual console 7 shows a message from gdm, telling me to restart gdm when i fixed the configuration and an OK "button", however, i cannot press that button.
