2008-01-16T16:54:00.000Z	g0rbeh		Good morning, I booted ubuntu this morning and it seems to have lost all the screen / grahpics cards settings, the x.org.conf still looks fine with all my old things in it
2008-01-16T16:55:00.000Z	g0rbeh		when i look in the the "Screen / resolution" applet it looks like my graphics cards / monitor are now not detected
2008-01-16T16:55:00.000Z	un0p	g0rbeh	what do you mean by "lost all screen/graphics cards settings" ?
2008-01-16T16:57:00.000Z	un0p	g0rbeh	have you tried increasing the res,>?
