2009-12-13T16:39:00.000Z	pj		Can anyone help me with this?  I recently upgraded my kernel to 2.6.32-020632rc8-generic in order to get a webcam to work (and it does work with this RC kernel), but now the 3d driver for my ATI graphics chipset is disabled and won't reinstall (when I try to activate it from the hardware drivers window it simply does not change to active), can someone help me to get graphics accelleration back?
