2008-02-28T00:31:00.000Z	beautifulsnow		Wondering if someone can help me with Wine, (yes I know there's a channel but its dormant :( )  My exe's don't run, and when I try to set up drives through config, I get "err:winecfg:apply_drive_changes   unable to define devicename of ...."  so when I come back and try again there are no drives... :-/

2008-02-28T00:33:00.000Z	beautifulsnow	MasterShrak	it was working fine a while back, and I had made no changes other than install wine-doors. even then Wine was working fine. But now it says theres no C drive (I think that's why it wont work)... I tried purging wine, purging my .wine directory, reinstalling fresh... nothing worked
