2006-06-29T15:45:00.000Z	Chewie		I got a legal question. The Ubuntu Logo is subject to trademark policy (http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/TrademarkPolicy/). However, it's included in the package "ubuntu-artwork", whose copyright says its contents are licensed under Creative Commons. Is this an incoherence or am I missing something?
