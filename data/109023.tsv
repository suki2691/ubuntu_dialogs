2008-01-12T03:03:00.000Z	sourcemaker		somebody tested kde4? is it stable?
2008-01-12T03:04:00.000Z	DrakeJustice_	sourcemaker	works good... few icon glitches on my box...
2008-01-12T03:04:00.000Z	DrakeJustice_	sourcemaker	supposedly svn fixed already
2008-01-12T03:09:00.000Z	sourcemaker	DrakeJustice_	all right... but I think... I will wait for kde 4.1 :-)
