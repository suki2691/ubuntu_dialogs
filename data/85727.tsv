2008-07-12T09:34:00.000Z	FingerSoup		Is there any way to un-mark a program for removal in Hardy?  I had some problems with FGLRX drivers, and ended up doing a manual install, now any time I try to use synaptic or apt-get, it tries to remove FGLRX drivers, then crashes when it tries.  The drivers work fine.....

2008-07-12T09:36:00.000Z	Shujah_	FingerSoup	synaptic custom filters > marked changes & broken
