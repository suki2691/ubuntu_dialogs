2011-02-14T12:40:00.000Z	robot7p		like ! code
2011-02-14T12:40:00.000Z	Fuchs	robot7p	this is not a code, but a command for the bot to answer. It works with any IRC client.
2011-02-14T12:41:00.000Z	Fuchs	robot7p	no, I would never use an instant messenger client for IRC. But it doesn't matter for you.
