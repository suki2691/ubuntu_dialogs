2009-10-10T14:58:00.000Z	alfatau		hello, i'm trying to switch from my windows workbench to ubuntu. i need a replacement for miktex and texniccenter. i tried texlive and kile, but texlive seems to be really outdated. do you know if it's possible to have an updated version of latex packages, or if there's another latex distro wich serves apt sources for ubuntu? thank you

2009-10-10T15:02:00.000Z	alfatau	KurtKraut	the problem isn't the ide, the problem is the outdated texlive distro. it's the 2007 version and includes a 2005 version of memoir class. I need a really updated texlive (or other distro for linux) version.
