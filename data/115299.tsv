2007-11-03T10:02:00.000Z	stanmancan132		I had WinXP Pro installed, and i installed Ubuntu 7.10 on another partition so that I'm dual booting. I want to un-install Ubuntu now so the drive is Windows only (i'll be installing ubuntu on a different computer completely)... How do I do this and still have my computer boot into windows??

2007-11-03T10:05:00.000Z	stanmancan132	Flannel	So do I fix the MBR, and then format the partition again???
