2009-04-24T10:08:00.000Z	webkris	mattgyver	you can upgrade from EXT3 to EXT4
2009-04-24T10:09:00.000Z	mattgyver	webkris	does it transfer existing files to the ext4 partiton?
2009-04-24T10:09:00.000Z	webkris	mattgyver	I (think) that it's like a FAT32 to NTFS upgrade - all data will stay intact. Google it tho.
