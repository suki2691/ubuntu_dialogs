I am trying to intall ubuntu 7.10 with xp already running on a system with 5 partitions. when i boot with the cd it shows my harddisk as one blnk space of 160 gb offering to create NEW partion tables. Would this Damage my data stored in the other drives if i create the partitions required for ubuntu at the end of the hd setting them as logical. later i can install the ntfs drivers. :|
