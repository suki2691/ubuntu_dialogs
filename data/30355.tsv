2010-06-13T13:23:00.000Z	EE_		i just came across something interesting and remembered that it wasnt the first time it happened and now really want to know what the deal is but can't find the answer. after i installed ubuntu on my desktop my bluetooth keyboard/mouse did not work until i moved the dongle to the usb slots at the back (instead of the ones on top of the tower)
2010-06-13T13:23:00.000Z	EE_		anyone know why?
2010-06-13T13:23:00.000Z	codebrainz	EE_	are the top ones plugged into the motherboard?
2010-06-13T13:24:00.000Z	EE_	codebrainz	where else could they be plugged into? i think last time i noticed was in windows when the drivers for a usb drive were installed again when i swithced between front and back. it's an acer aspire btw
