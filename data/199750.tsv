2007-03-10T17:05:00.000Z	metal		quick question: I'm starting a new job that uses Ubuntu and I want to setup a li'l box to familiarize myself Ubuntu and Drupal. Would you assume they are running the 6.06 LTS release, or should I go with the 6.10.
2007-03-10T17:06:00.000Z	cafuego_	metal	Do they have a public site that I could check apache or php versions on? :-)

2007-03-10T17:07:00.000Z	cafuego_	metal	No, I mean: you cna get apache/php info from the web server (if they have one) which would tell you which ubuntu version they use.
