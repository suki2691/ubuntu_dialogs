2009-08-17T02:54:00.000Z	ge2x		where does ubuntu store resolution options? because it seems to ignore my /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-08-17T02:55:00.000Z	ge2x		so now I'm stuck with 620x480 resolution and can't change it
2009-08-17T02:56:00.000Z	boss_mc	ge2x	no other options in System->Prefs->Display?
2009-08-17T02:56:00.000Z	ge2x	boss_mc	yes
