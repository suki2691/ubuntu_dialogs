2011-12-31T11:03:00.000Z	bis0n	forcemp	I'm using "wget -r -l 5 -I tst domain.com/dir/"  ok for "domain.com/dir/tst" but not for "domain.com/dir/directoryX/tst"
2011-12-31T11:04:00.000Z	bis0n	forcemp	using 'find . -type d -name "tst"' seems to be an good idea but how I can execute that on domain.com/
2011-12-31T11:06:00.000Z	forcemp	bis0n	i thought you were trying to accomplish something else. find wont work.
