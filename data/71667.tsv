2008-12-31T09:59:00.000Z	AnnonyMouse		hi. how can I better distribute processes & task evenly accross my dual-core processors?
2008-12-31T10:00:00.000Z	AnnonyMouse		CPU1 is running @ 90% & CPU2 @ 30%
2008-12-31T10:00:00.000Z	Boohbah	AnnonyMouse	that is controlled by the kernel process scheduler
2008-12-31T10:01:00.000Z	AnnonyMouse	Boohbah	thanx. any way to alter/controll this, as task are being disproportionately assigned
