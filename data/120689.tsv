2008-05-03T22:29:00.000Z	hb		Has anybody had any luck getting the extra buttons on a g15 logitech mouse to work?  I modified my xorg.conf to Option "buttons" "9" but it still only sees the first 5 (including mouse wheel up/down)

2008-05-03T22:31:00.000Z	danbhfive	hb	no, I guess its 8 buttons on this mouse, including mouse wheel
2008-05-03T22:32:00.000Z	danbhfive	hb	I did use an .Xmodmap to remap the buttons, I dont know if that would help you
