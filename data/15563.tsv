2011-05-04T21:00:00.000Z	DJones	donkeyinspace	Is the cd a desktop cd, or the minimal install cd? The minimal cd is a download of of only about 100Mb maybe that could be the cause
2011-05-04T21:00:00.000Z	donkeyinspace	DJones	, it is a desktop cd
2011-05-04T21:01:00.000Z	DJones	donkeyinspace	ok, it was just a thought
