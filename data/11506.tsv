2011-11-15T07:39:00.000Z	elz89	scristopher	yes, I seem to remember it just working, although you'll need 'joystick'
2011-11-15T07:40:00.000Z	elz89	scristopher	got it plugged in?
2011-11-15T07:41:00.000Z	elz89	scristopher	if you can see it working in 'joystick', then you need to go away and 'try harder'
