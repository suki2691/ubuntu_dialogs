2007-09-01T07:38:00.000Z	VladimirBG		After a long while I decided to give programming a try, so I'd like to learn C++, especialy with ALP coming (Access Linux Platform), so, is there any GOOD online tutorials, and which IDE would you suggest? I saw MS's Visual Studio, and it's seems user friendly, anything similar for linux?

2007-09-01T07:39:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	VladimirBG	Oops. I hit enter too early. Anyway, If you tweak some of gedit's options, it becomes sort of coder friendly. There's also VIM, and eMacs, and for GNOME I think there's.. whatdya callit, Anjuta
