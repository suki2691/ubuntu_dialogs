2008-10-23T14:45:00.000Z	Hisamu		there's a mirc-like irc client for ubuntu?
2008-10-23T14:46:00.000Z	Hisamu		xchat is the best option? :/
2008-10-23T14:46:00.000Z	MenZa	Hisamu	Depending on what you want - irssi and xchat are really good clients. xchat if you want a GUI client; irssi if you want a terminal one.
2008-10-23T14:47:00.000Z	MenZa	Hisamu	Although the list of IRC clients goes on; irssi, bitchx, xchat, konversation, xchat-gnome, etc.
