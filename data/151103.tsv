2007-02-05T14:06:00.000Z	fliptop	viller	 the ones that come w/ it are, to install others you need msttcorefonts
2007-02-05T14:06:00.000Z	viller	fliptop	I don't need msttcorefonts. I just needed to know if I can use those fonts to create stuff
2007-02-05T14:09:00.000Z	fliptop	viller	 you can use those fonts all you want, but if you install something like scribus you'll need the msttcorefonts too
