2009-04-08T06:46:00.000Z	Matson		what do I use to set which services start and stop on the server at boot time?
2009-04-08T06:46:00.000Z	Matson		on debian I used to use rcconf - is there somethin like that for ubuntu?
2009-04-08T06:46:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Matson	you can do the same thing.  I like the sysv-rc-conf tool myself (ncurses-type pseudo-GUI).
2009-04-08T06:47:00.000Z	Matson	tonyyarusso	will check out sysv-rc-conf
