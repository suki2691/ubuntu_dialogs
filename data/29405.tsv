2010-07-25T20:41:00.000Z	LeeQ		Quesion about server mirroring and database backups. I have main server and backup server, backup taked mysqldump every night.
2010-07-25T20:41:00.000Z	LeeQ		dns points to backup server if main server is down. say main server goes down and things are added to the db on the backup server. what is the best way to reconcile?
2010-07-25T20:42:00.000Z	LeeQ		is there a better backup method to keep the two servers matched?
