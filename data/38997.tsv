2010-01-17T03:26:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Cyberthunder	it depends what software, for example office is difficult to get running with wine, but playonlinux makes it easier
2010-01-17T03:27:00.000Z	Cyberthunder	MikeChelen	for office i only use open office, but i understand you
2010-01-17T03:28:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Cyberthunder	me too, but some people need ms office for compatibility with other users
