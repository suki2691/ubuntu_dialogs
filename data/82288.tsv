2008-09-12T03:03:00.000Z	carandraug	TheMaxzilla	that depends on how much RAM you hvae and what software you'll run in Windows
2008-09-12T03:05:00.000Z	TheMaxzilla	carandraug	Okay, I have plenty... does 615 sound good for a minimum?
2008-09-12T03:07:00.000Z	carandraug	TheMaxzilla	it really depends on what you'll be running there. games like UT3 is out of question for example
