2009-11-05T08:46:00.000Z	chowder	DugenNash	set it up in the /etc/fstab
2009-11-05T08:48:00.000Z	chowder	DugenNash	if you look at the /etc/fstab file you'll see that ubuntu already has some entries so you can get the general idea. Either way there are a million and one tutorials online about editing the /etc/fstab. Google is your friend.
