2006-12-23T09:52:00.000Z	gratuit		Whenever I put a blank disk into the cd tray, a dialog pops up asking me what I want to do, is there any way to disable this "feature"? Also when I put a cd in, thunar pops up, I would like to disable this as well. I'm using xfce
2006-12-23T09:52:00.000Z	un_operateur	gratuit	have you checked the properties of the CD-Rom drive?
2006-12-23T09:53:00.000Z	gratuit	un_operateur	where would I find those?
2006-12-23T09:54:00.000Z	un_operateur	gratuit	I havent used thunar in a whole -- right click on the CD-Rom drive - properties -- im guessing
