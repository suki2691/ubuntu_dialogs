2007-11-01T02:48:00.000Z	Gmac		Quick question, ive just quited from the game Lgenerals and my desktop is slightly lower resolution and I can scroll around it?
2007-11-01T02:49:00.000Z	Gmac		 :) how can I reset it to its original res?
2007-11-01T02:49:00.000Z	Pelo	Gmac	check in sysgtem > prefs >`screen res , see if you can set it back
