2009-12-10T15:00:00.000Z	bishops		hello i have this problem, i was trying to install wicd for my internet connection on ubuntu, so it removed the gnome default one, and then it stopped downloading because there wasn't any internet software to connect me. How can I re-install an internet program without being connected?
