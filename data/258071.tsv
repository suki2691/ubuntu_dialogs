2005-08-13T08:12:00.000Z	yyc747		how is ubuntu in terms of connecting via ppp?  what is a good dialer to use (I've heard kppp is good, but I'd rather not use KDE stuff)?
2005-08-13T08:13:00.000Z	Xenguy	yyc747	pppconfig is worth a try also
2005-08-13T08:14:00.000Z	Xenguy	yyc747	dpkg -l pppconfig
2005-08-13T08:15:00.000Z	yyc747	Xenguy	well, I'm not at the computer in question right now, or in a place where I need to use dialup... but I will be soon
