2007-03-11T16:07:00.000Z	robbie_crash		I have an issue with a bluetooth keyboard/mouse combo. When I first start up my machine, I have to immideately type something (ie my login) then my keyboard and mouse stop responding until I unplug and replug my bluetooth hub, then they work normally. It seems like I've got about 3 or 4 seconds to type before it stops responding, and if I don't, then it refuses to respond and I need to reboot
