2009-02-21T07:37:00.000Z	thomc		Hey can I login to a second user account on my system whilst still leaving the programs on the user account I was originally using up and running? How would I do this?
2009-02-21T07:38:00.000Z	DasEi	thomc	logoff (don't reboot) and login again as diff. user
2009-02-21T07:38:00.000Z	thomc	DasEi	won't that end all the programs I was running before I logged off.
2009-02-21T07:40:00.000Z	DasEi	thomc	multiple users can do different tasked at the same time, only restricted by ressources, so there is a way, maybe restarting loginmanager from terminal does the trick
