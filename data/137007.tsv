2008-08-05T21:55:00.000Z	Asterix_		would a bad driver allow me to play a 3d game for about 10 minutes and then have a hard crash or would this be more of a sign to a failing video card?

2008-08-05T21:58:00.000Z	Asterix_	wols	I'm running xsensors and my temp is around 50 degrees celsius at desktop but this is a shuttle system and they're kinda compact as it is
