2008-07-08T03:12:00.000Z	laplacianguy		does anyone of you knows how to determine the age of an installed system?
2008-07-08T03:13:00.000Z	linxeh	laplacianguy	you could check the oldest file on the system, or the kernel version (perhaps), or the OS version
2008-07-08T03:14:00.000Z	laplacianguy	linxeh	i don;t keep any old kernel..
