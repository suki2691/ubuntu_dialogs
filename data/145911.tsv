2007-02-13T13:09:00.000Z	kiwii		is 2.6.17 good version or should I install other ?
2007-02-13T13:09:00.000Z	HymnToLife	kiwii	it should be good enough for you
2007-02-14T11:07:00.000Z	kiwii	HymnToLife	but to change to 64 version, do i have to change kernel only ?
2007-02-14T11:08:00.000Z	HymnToLife	kiwii	I don't think so, you'll also have to change all your binaries to 64bit ones
