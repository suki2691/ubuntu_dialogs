2009-06-22T12:53:00.000Z	Halabund		Yet another win-to-ubuntu transition question :)  On windows I can open any file by just typing its name in the terminal, or, alternatively, typing "start filename".  Is there an equivalent in Ubuntu?  I would like to avoid having to figure out the exact name of the program that can open a specific file ...
