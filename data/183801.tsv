2006-09-20T14:09:00.000Z	Squatch		Quick question, I'm installing Ubuntu for the first time and have an extremely limited knowledge of Linux...  So, sorry if this question doesn't make any sense.  I'm trying to set up how things will be mounted, have a 5GB partition for Root, 2GB partition for Swap, and the rest of a 40GB HDD for whatever else...  Should I mount /var, /usr, /home, and /boot on the 33GB partition or in some other configuration?
2006-09-20T14:11:00.000Z	Squatch		So I have to have dedicated partitions for /usr, /var, /home, and /boot as well as root and swap?

2006-09-20T14:13:00.000Z	JoseStefan	Squatch	sounds good
