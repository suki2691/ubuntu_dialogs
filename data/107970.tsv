2008-01-07T02:26:00.000Z	Cpudan80	syntaxerror55	thumbs.db is a windows thing that shows you thumbnails of the pictures - not necessary
2008-01-19T23:58:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	Cpudan80	not true. What about Flash 8, etc
2008-01-19T23:58:00.000Z	Cpudan80	syntaxerror55	OK sure - if you actually *make* flash movies.... but that is a small minority
