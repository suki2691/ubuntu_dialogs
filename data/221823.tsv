2005-09-23T06:05:00.000Z	mpm2		not specifically ubuntu related, but does anyone know how to compile a program in say Pascal on Linux (Ubuntu) and have it be executable on someone else's Windows machine?  Is it compatible by default?  I'm very new to programming :-)
2005-09-23T06:07:00.000Z	mpm2		any of you know whether the Gnu Pascal Compiler (GPC) supports cross-compiling? Thanks for the answers

2005-09-23T06:08:00.000Z	mpm2	JDahl	yes, I'm not going to be using Pacal in the long run, just wanted to share stuff I'm working on for a class with my sister who doesn't run linux yet :-)
