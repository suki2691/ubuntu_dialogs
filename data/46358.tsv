2010-01-03T19:58:00.000Z	TDJACR		I'm trying to use IPv6 via a tunnel on a server of mine and ufw seems to block all ipv6 connections while allowing ipv4 connections to the same ports
2010-01-03T19:58:00.000Z	TDJACR		And ipv6 is enabled in /etc/default/ufw
2010-01-03T20:00:00.000Z	TDJACR		UFW is ubuntu's firewall
2010-01-03T20:01:00.000Z	BlouBlou	TDJACR	No, ufw is firewall manager
