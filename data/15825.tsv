2011-04-24T06:41:00.000Z	aaron_wayne	magn3ts	yeah, i dont know, i think i have some missing space on the disk though, could be related to the bad sectors i guess, i have had problems ever since i tried to boot backtrack4
2011-04-24T06:42:00.000Z	magn3ts	aaron_wayne	are you experiencing data loss or are you concerned about the integrity of your drive? I missed what the problem you're trying to solve was.
2011-04-24T06:44:00.000Z	aaron_wayne	magn3ts	no data loss, I am running dual boot, and both OS's want to run disk check ocassionally on startup, and i was looking into and found that I had the bad sectors, long story short, dual boot, tried to boot backtrack, back to strictly windows, use gparted to merge partitions, lost some space, back to dual boot right now
