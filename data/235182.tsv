2005-05-27T06:52:00.000Z	crimsun_	k	hoary-security is updated as fast as humanly possible for the security team
2005-05-27T06:54:00.000Z	k	crimsun_	well. I don't want to complain about the fixing of security holes ;) - But when I run upgrade with an debian-archive after a month or so, I get massiv of stuff to update.
