2009-06-10T00:13:00.000Z	ratzes	_Roke_	have you messed with the volume settings?
2009-06-10T00:13:00.000Z	ratzes	_Roke_	 most of the time i've fixed my sound issues by just screwing around with all the different volume settings
2009-06-10T00:17:00.000Z	_Roke_	ratzes	I've tried to use the sound settings but It does not work at all. I've heard something about alsa sorround because I've noticed that that sound is divided in my speakers and headfone
