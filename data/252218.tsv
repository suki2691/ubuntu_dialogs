2005-02-05T11:10:00.000Z	sensebend	cg0def	a normal user wouldn't notice it
2005-02-05T11:12:00.000Z	cg0def	sensebend	well what about stuff like mplayer and xmms that can used 3dnow and other optimizations that were not available for 386/
2005-02-05T11:14:00.000Z	cg0def	sensebend	how would you use USE flags in debian?
