2008-04-13T05:57:00.000Z	CorbinFox		is there a way to update alsa to the version that is in 8.04 from 7.10?
2008-04-13T05:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	CorbinFox	you could, but why do you need to?
2008-04-13T05:58:00.000Z	CorbinFox	IndyGunFreak	because it appears that the version used in 8.04 actually works for my sound card completely
2008-04-13T05:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	CorbinFox	well, 8.04 is only 2 weeks away, i'd just hold out if i were you.
