2012-06-22T04:25:00.000Z	fishbait	trinisoljah	this is an ubuntu support channel those here are likely familiar only with ubuntu
2012-06-22T04:27:00.000Z	fishbait	trinisoljah	no ubuntu is based on debian thats a common misconception
2012-06-22T04:28:00.000Z	fishbait	trinisoljah	what i'm trying to say is that backtrack is debian based.
