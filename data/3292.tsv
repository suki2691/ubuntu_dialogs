2012-05-04T22:09:00.000Z	MrIronMan		Hello guys, I managed to install 12.04 on a crap hardware (256 ram, nvidia fx 5500) and I am getting some strange behavior with USB mouse and the ps/2 keyboard, the mouse suddenly and randomly stops and the keyboard go nuts, repeating the last key I typed, randomly as well. Could anybody try to point me to the right direction of the fix?
2012-05-04T22:10:00.000Z	MrIronMan		if anybody have had this issue before and I can give away more info as well
