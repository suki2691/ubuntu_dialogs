2011-02-16T08:28:00.000Z	Jon--		I want to make a complete image of one Ubuntu machine and port it to another, excluding grub.cfg would be nice. Anyone care to help me ?
2011-02-16T08:30:00.000Z	dirty-harry	Jon--	you could use clonezilla to clone partion to the another hdd!? why exclude grub?
2011-02-16T08:31:00.000Z	Jon--	dirty-harry	Because one has windows 7 dualboot and the other has windows xp. I only want to touch /  not image the entire drive.
2011-02-16T08:35:00.000Z	dirty-harry	Jon--	ok, I see. but isn't it possible to clone only / and install grub with new configuration afterwards? I thought it...
