2008-09-27T03:01:00.000Z	Axle		how do I shut off power to my drive in ubuntu?
2008-09-27T03:02:00.000Z	Axle		I think I can pry it open, but I don't want it to be trying to read the disc inside while I am prying
2008-09-27T03:02:00.000Z	Axle		umount /dev/scd0?
2008-09-27T03:03:00.000Z	andy_	Axle	you'll need sudo for that
