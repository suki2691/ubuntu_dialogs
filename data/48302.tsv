2012-05-28T03:49:00.000Z	TheAscended		hey all. You know that blinking cursor next to the text that you type? I was in gedit and something happened where it started replacing text instead of inserting text, so I can't fix my work without having to re-write large portions of it
2012-05-28T03:49:00.000Z	TheAscended		I'm not sure which button I pushed to change that
2012-05-28T03:49:00.000Z	TheAscended		can anyone help me?
