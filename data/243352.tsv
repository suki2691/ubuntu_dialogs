2009-10-14T00:59:00.000Z	rafael	andrew__	Is it free software?
2009-10-14T01:01:00.000Z	andrew__	rafael	yes it is free to use... i don't think it is open sourced however... more of a service they provide on facebook.  they may have a stand alone program, but I am unaware of one.  e-mail them.  they intend you to add books you have read, and want to read and it shares that information with your friends
