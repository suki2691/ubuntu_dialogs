2006-09-17T08:02:00.000Z	Meroigo		I have two soundcards, one for the main sound for speakers/earphones andthe other one is an on board one that i use for the microphone (the other one's microphone thing is broken or something :P)... Can i choose that microphone will be from the board card but still have sound in the speakers? I can't find anything about it! I want to use Skype etc... >_<
