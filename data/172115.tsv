2006-10-22T09:11:00.000Z	wickedpuppy		btw whats the upstart command ? i did upstart and get no such command error
2006-10-22T09:12:00.000Z	printk	wickedpuppy	it's not a command.  it's the init system, the rc files.  it consists of several things
2006-10-22T09:12:00.000Z	printk	wickedpuppy	start is one, init is one... etc etc..
