2011-05-31T16:42:00.000Z	Vustom		On my other PC I'm running Ubuntu 10.04 and it was working just fine but when I restarted the PC and logged in, I only got a black screen with the mouse.. I can't do anything and I can't open a terminal..

2011-05-31T16:45:00.000Z	Vustom	MonkeyDust	No, at the moment I'm on the same PC just on the live CD at the moment..
