2009-04-27T03:54:00.000Z	cptblood		i have a php script that needs php gd2 installed, when i run it, it says cant find the PHP GD2 library. Please make sure you have removed the semicolon from this line ';extension=php_gd2.dll" in your php.ini and the library is correctly installed.
2009-04-27T03:54:00.000Z	cptblood		any takes? i've tried apt-get install php5-gd

2009-04-27T03:55:00.000Z	mzz	cptblood	that's an option, but I'd prefer to do it in software
