2006-05-13T12:38:00.000Z	driggers		hello.  i have a rather general question.  why is it so hard (for me, a relative linux newbie) to install programs on linux ( i have ubuntu).  i download files with long, incomprehensible names, use programs that give a lot of errors.  unpack stuff, do a lot of trial and error w/ the words config and make, find i'm missing essential parts of my compiler and end up making a big mess
2006-05-13T12:38:00.000Z	driggers		there is a point to this btw
2006-05-13T12:38:00.000Z	driggers		is there something obvious i'm missing?  like maybe a "how do do your basic program installation guide and where important things are and go in you linux machine guide?"
