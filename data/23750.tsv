2010-10-20T23:42:00.000Z	woofthing		I have a fresh install of ubuntu 10.10 netbook remix. when the system starts and desktop finishes loading, any dialog box (including mousing over the left chooser bar) causes the desktop to reset (screen goes black, desktop reloads -- not a reboot, just a refresh of desktop). Any thoughts?
2010-10-20T23:42:00.000Z	woofthing		this happens over and over -- the system is unusable b/c nothing can be done between resets.
2010-10-20T23:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	woofthing	log in to terminal session (CTRL+ALT+F1 at login screen) and get updated there
2010-10-20T23:43:00.000Z	woofthing	ActionParsnip	thank you SO much.
