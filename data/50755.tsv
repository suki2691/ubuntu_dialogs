2010-02-11T08:52:00.000Z	shapr		I upgraded today, and now vlc won't produce sound. I am unable to kill pulseaudio via pactl or kill. Anyone have suggestions?
2010-02-11T08:53:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	shapr	do you mean upgraded to Karmic (9.10) or Lucid (10.04)?
2010-02-11T08:53:00.000Z	shapr	ZykoticK9	I'm using Karmic.
2010-02-11T08:53:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	shapr	ok - just checking
