2006-05-01T15:37:00.000Z	sopido	pax	question: why should i install this xlibs package just for opera if the installation works fine without it (just the conflicts appear)?
2006-05-01T15:37:00.000Z	sopido		isn't there a way to let apt accept this installation without it?
2006-05-01T15:37:00.000Z	sopido		just curious..
