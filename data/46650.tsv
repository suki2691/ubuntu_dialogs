2009-10-15T06:19:00.000Z	Dayspring		ok audacious is in the usr/local/bin/audacious but they are locked....can't delete them
2009-10-15T06:21:00.000Z	Dayspring		so it's sudo apt-get remove ~/usr/local/bin/audacious ??
2009-10-15T06:22:00.000Z	WanHouse	Dayspring	you dont need sudo. Its rm -rf ~/usr/local/bin/audacious (For a single file its just rm /Path/To/File)
2009-10-15T06:23:00.000Z	WanHouse	Dayspring	To remove an entire package as you probably want to do, its: apt-get remove audacious
