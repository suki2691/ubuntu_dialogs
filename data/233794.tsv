2005-06-12T14:07:00.000Z	japoeder		I would like to see embedded video in Mozilla, but am not currently able to.  Can anyone make some suggestions as to how to get this to work?  I have xine and can play downloaded files in it, but this isn't possible for videos that are embedded in the browser.

2005-06-12T14:08:00.000Z	japoeder		would apt-get install mplayerplugin work or is there a special repository I need
2005-06-12T14:11:00.000Z	japoeder	Fikrann	It isn't listed in any of the repositories I have.  By any chance do you know which one it in?
