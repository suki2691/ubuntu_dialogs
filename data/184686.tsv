2006-05-27T16:25:00.000Z	BazziR	petrik	I write everything I install into a kubtuntu-packages.txt and after a reformat etc I just install everything in that document :)
2006-05-27T16:27:00.000Z	petrik	BazziR	Yeah but where do you get it from. What if you get something you are relying on and the repos no longer has it. I prefer to have things tangible in my house. Not on some server where it may or may not be there when I next need it.
