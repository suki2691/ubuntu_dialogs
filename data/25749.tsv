Yesterday  I got another webpage

And installed Xdebug for PHP.  after this I put  the  webpage to another /var/www/ folder called fashion. Now in fashion everything works as its needs to: url rewrite , expires.. everything. But now my original folder shimmi, doesnt works: no url rewrite, no imagick thumbnails nor the original image shows up.
