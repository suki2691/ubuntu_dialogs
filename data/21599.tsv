2010-12-26T06:24:00.000Z	burhan	r000t_laptop	run software update, if there is something available it will tell you.
2010-12-26T06:25:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	burhan	Also, how do I tell what drivers I have? I heard the x.org project built drivers manually
2010-12-26T06:25:00.000Z	burhan	r000t_laptop	run the driver wizard (that's the easy way). Or, grep the Xorg.log file, it will tell you which driver is being used.
