2008-10-16T06:23:00.000Z	AllNewToMe	DigitalFiz	Yes, samba is installed and works perfectly with other machines on the network. (Windoze 98, OpenSuse, Mint, XP)
2008-10-16T06:24:00.000Z	DigitalFiz	AllNewToMe	go into vistas network settings and make sure sharing is on
2008-10-16T06:26:00.000Z	AllNewToMe	DigitalFiz	I have already done that, and I have no problem accessing Vista from other machines
