2011-01-15T23:17:00.000Z	KM0201	Windowed	taskel?
2011-01-15T23:19:00.000Z	KM0201	Windowed	you'll probably have to uninstall each package individually would be my guess.... sudo apt-get remove packagename   or use the GUI (system/admin/synaptic package manager)
2011-01-15T23:19:00.000Z	KM0201	Windowed	so what are you wanting to do, remove kubuntu, and get back to CLI only?
