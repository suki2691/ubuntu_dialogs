2008-11-22T02:54:00.000Z	alexmart		hello, I have ubuntu 7.10 installed. I've recently installed kubuntu 8.10 on another partition. How do I add kubuntu to /boot/grub/menu.lst ? (When I installed Kubuntu I didn't choose to rewrite the boot so there's no Kubuntu in my grub menu when I turn on the computer.)

2008-11-22T02:55:00.000Z	Stormx2		You'll need to edit that file.
