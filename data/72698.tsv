2011-08-13T18:36:00.000Z	Nashenas		Does anyone know what would keep me from being able to move my windows? I made some changes in compiz config settings manager, and I changed them back, but I still can't drag any windows
2011-08-13T18:37:00.000Z	IdleOne	Nashenas	restart compiz and see if it still does it
2011-08-13T18:37:00.000Z	Nashenas	IdleOne	I've restarted my desktop and I still can't move them
2011-08-13T18:40:00.000Z	Nashenas	IdleOne	I got it. Somehow the movewindow extension had been disabled
