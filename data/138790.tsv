2009-06-16T05:00:00.000Z	David__		Ok here's a different question. I'm setting up an Ubuntu test environment (so I can run a localhost). What's a good free server management program? (like cpanel)
2009-06-16T05:00:00.000Z	David__		Sorry, not cpanel. Something more akin to running a server and setting up domains.
2009-06-16T05:00:00.000Z	David__		Apache.
2009-06-16T05:02:00.000Z	_gtt_	David__	I would recommend WebMin
