2010-05-01T18:58:00.000Z	wagnix		I installed ubuntu on my SATA drive and I have 2 pata drives (for storage) and when the computer boots the computer stops with a black screen after the bios info.. I checked boot order in the bios and its all correct even when I hit f8 and manually tell it to boot from the sata it wont... so I have to go though a few (normally 4 boot cycles) and it finally loads ubuntu... whats going on?
