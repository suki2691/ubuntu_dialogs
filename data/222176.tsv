2005-12-20T13:41:00.000Z	intelikey	siorai	hmm preinstalled but not active might be more like it.  iptables is the firewall
2005-12-20T13:42:00.000Z	intelikey	siorai	firestarter is the config app for iptables methinks
2005-12-20T13:51:00.000Z	intelikey	siorai	if iptables is the reason    'iptables -L '  should show it methinks
