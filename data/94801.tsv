2008-05-08T00:49:00.000Z	ogt		anyway I can run several synaptic or apt-get instances at the same time???
2008-05-08T00:49:00.000Z	Kohlrak	ogt	you shouldn't have more than one type of synaptic open at a time
2008-05-08T00:51:00.000Z	Kohlrak	ogt	pretty much. you don't want to install 2 things at once on linux because things in linux are a little more closer to the OS than they are in windows.
