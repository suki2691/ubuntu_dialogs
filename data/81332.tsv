2008-12-30T08:08:00.000Z	savid		Ugh! I'm having this really annoying problem where I can't watch any flash videos --  The video stops about two seconds into it.  If I move the slider to another position in the video, it plays for another two seconds and stops again.  Has anyone else experienced this?

2008-12-30T08:09:00.000Z	savid	hansel	no, it's not buffering.  This happens even when the video has completely buffered.
