2009-09-10T07:42:00.000Z	UBuntuNewbie		This may be  a stupid question but.... I'm currenlty running Ubuntu, is it possible for me to upgrade to Kubuntu so I can try out the KDE desktop?
2009-09-10T07:42:00.000Z	PMantis	UBuntuNewbie	apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
2009-09-10T07:43:00.000Z	PMantis	UBuntuNewbie	ubuntu vs kubuntu ... there's really no difference except for what packages are installed.
