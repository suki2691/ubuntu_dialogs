2007-01-25T17:21:00.000Z	shatrat	minimec	there is no self compiled FGLRX driver.  If you install it yourself you compile the interface bit of it, but most of it is binary. Installing yourself can be the only way to get brand new versions.  Depends on how current a repository you can get for it I guess
2007-01-25T17:22:00.000Z	minimec	shatrat	But... For the radeon 9000 card that other guy has, the driver of the ubuntu repo should do... Don't you think?
