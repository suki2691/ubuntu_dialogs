2008-02-06T00:03:00.000Z	Alex2		Hi. I've got an problem with probably whole GStreamer - everything connected with it or something like this (KDE based apps are grayscale too) is grayscale; all videos and visualisations (in Totem and Rythmbox, I heard that it uses GStreamer-based plugins for visualisations, but I ain't sure) are GRAYSCALE. I tried reinstalling all parts of GStreamer in the Synaptic, but it wouldn't help :/.
