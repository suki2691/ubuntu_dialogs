2010-06-10T21:41:00.000Z	mbeierl	hyuukai	it's sudo apt-get install alsamixer if you want to install a prog
2010-06-10T21:41:00.000Z	mbeierl	hyuukai	but I know nothing about the problem, or alsa, so I cannot help any further than that...
2010-06-10T21:42:00.000Z	mbeierl	hyuukai	sorry "aptitude search alsamix" shows alsamixergui and gnome-alsamixer
2010-06-10T21:42:00.000Z	mbeierl	hyuukai	so it would be one of them...
