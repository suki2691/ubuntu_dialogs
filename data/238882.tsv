2005-05-20T08:57:00.000Z	Dutch		Hi all.. Just looking for a headsup before installing Hoary on an old laptop. DellLatitude CP, with a CS3237 Soundchip. Not being able to autoconfigure it with the LiveCD..
2005-05-20T08:58:00.000Z	Dutch		Any advice for the actual install.. ? It's an ISA chip, so the automatic Alsa config can't find it.
