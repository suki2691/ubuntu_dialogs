2010-09-28T21:48:00.000Z	SteveThing		can someone help me track down why a program tries to start on boot-up and how to remove it?
2010-09-28T21:49:00.000Z	st__	SteveThing	session settings?
2010-09-28T21:49:00.000Z	SteveThing	st__	I don't think so. I don't see it in the startup programs list
2010-09-28T21:52:00.000Z	SteveThing	st__	the program is Playstation Media Server and I didn't add anything to startup applications. It tries to start on boot-up, but doesn't seem to start correctly
