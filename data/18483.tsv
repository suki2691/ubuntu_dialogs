2011-09-13T10:28:00.000Z	susundberg	Blake	it is doable at least with xorg.conf, but can you do that with GUI i am not sure
2011-09-13T10:30:00.000Z	susundberg	Blake	see that page i pasted, section "Configuring X "
2011-09-13T10:30:00.000Z	susundberg	Blake	Again, as i said, i have no glue if there is GUI for doing that
