2009-12-24T00:51:00.000Z	ericdb		I'm using the default NetworkManager under Karmic...I want to use OpenDNS...do I have to set it up individually on every wireless connection I use?
2009-12-24T00:52:00.000Z	ericdb		thanks llutz

2009-12-24T00:54:00.000Z	ericdb	blakkheim	I might check into wicd later on (I used to use it back when it was the only way for Ubuntu to talk to my campus network), but for now I'm looking for a NetworkManager solution.
