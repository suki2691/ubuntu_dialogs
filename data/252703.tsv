2005-05-26T13:19:00.000Z	neighborlee	HappyFool	no i'm saying on other distros this is exactcly how it works...just like it does in windows...thas all ;-)
2005-05-26T13:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	neighborlee	have you tried installing the setcd package? (in hoary universe) It mentions controlling CD properties like auto-locking
