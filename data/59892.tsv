2011-10-24T16:17:00.000Z	ericP		why on a freshly upgraded 11.10 can't synaptic find a gnuserv package?
2011-10-24T16:18:00.000Z	tomodachi	ericP	because it doesent exist in the repositories. I just tryed searching for it myself
2011-10-24T16:19:00.000Z	ericP	tomodachi	it used to work out of the box until 11.10. dunnot if it was its own package, but at least /M-x gnuserv did what it needed
2011-10-24T16:19:00.000Z	tomodachi	ericP	dont even know what it is unfortunately. Just telling you that it dont exist in the repos. Maybe the package maintainer hasnt made a version for current ubuntu.
