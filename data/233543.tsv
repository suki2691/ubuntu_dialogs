2005-06-26T10:13:00.000Z	tchmnky	DanielC	apt-get dist-upgrade would upgrade you to the newer Ubuntu, which right now is Breezy, which is very unstable. See !breezy. ;)
2005-06-26T10:14:00.000Z	DanielC	tchmnky	You're kidding. How can it take me to breezy if I only have hoary archives in sources.list ?
2005-06-26T11:31:00.000Z	tchmnky	DanielC	doesn't look like you ever left. :-/
