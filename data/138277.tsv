2009-05-07T05:17:00.000Z	Yanick_		Hi, I installed Orange Box and Wine, and thw whole thing seems to work fine, but the game is laggy, which is weird because I have quite a decent computer :) my older computer plays Portal better than this one. Anyway. I've read that using DX8 improves performance, but I don't know how to procede. can anyone assist?
