2008-06-16T08:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Chikubu	and it should, it has drivers available in XP
2008-06-16T08:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Chikubu	i'm saying thats might be way... generic drivers, make generic features work.
2008-06-16T08:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Chikubu	maybe.. try asking on ubuntuforums.org
