2009-05-14T20:05:00.000Z	bmorris		hey guys I'd like to change the extension on a whole bunch of files in one directory.  What would be the easiest way to do that?
2009-05-14T20:05:00.000Z	tonytraductor	bmorris	I would use rename.ul (which used to be just rename, before they renamed prename to rename and rename to rename.ul)
2009-05-14T20:05:00.000Z	bmorris	Pici	would that work on a number of files at once?  I want to keep the filename.. just change the extension
2009-05-14T20:06:00.000Z	tonytraductor	bmorris	with rename.ul do "rename.ul .jpg .JPG *.jpg" or whatever the extentions are, like "rename.ul ext1 ext *.ext1"
