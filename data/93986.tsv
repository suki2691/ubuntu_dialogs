2008-09-09T21:01:00.000Z	samtb		i'm trying to create a bzr branch of mplayer so i can create personal packages that track the official releases but some of the launchpad branches don't seem to be setup and others give bzr: not a branch
2008-09-09T21:01:00.000Z	samtb		can someone here explain what's going on or should i be asking on ubuntu-dev?
2008-09-09T21:02:00.000Z	alphabeta	samtb	it'd probably be better, I don't know how many people in here are package developers
2008-09-09T21:03:00.000Z	samtb	alphabeta	thanks - it's more about the bzr hosting to start with i guess, but i'll go over there
