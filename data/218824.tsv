2005-09-19T05:41:00.000Z	paco_		yea, I've noticed. That bites, all my partitions are ntfs... Now to figure out how to transfer all my linux stuff onto my ntfs drive.
2005-09-19T05:41:00.000Z	paco_		is there a reliable way to make windows read my linux partition?
2005-09-19T05:41:00.000Z	avi	paco_	I'm in the process of configuring a dual-boot (w/ WinXP & Ubuntu)... I created a FAT32 partition, moved docs over to it, and can work just fine with them from Ubuntu.
