2009-05-19T00:07:00.000Z	tdn		I have just installed Ubuntu 9.04 on my girlfriends laptop. During install I created a user for me 'tdn'. When the install finished, I created an admin user for her 'hhc'. When I use it, it regularly pops up with security updates. But when she uses it, it does not. How do I fix this? I have checked today that there are several updates. Why is she not notified?

2009-05-19T00:11:00.000Z	tdn	soulfreshner	yes.
