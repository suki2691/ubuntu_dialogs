2009-08-10T13:10:00.000Z	mr_lou		Hello. Running Ubuntu v8.04 here. Can I update to v9.04 via a CD without problems, or is it best to install v9.04 "clean"?

2009-08-10T13:12:00.000Z	mr_lou	DJones	rww mkay then.... what's the best way of upgrading then? I can't seem to find anywhere of doing it within Ubuntu, so I need to manually download something, right?
