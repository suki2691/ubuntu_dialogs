2009-11-12T07:18:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	mbrigdan	almost certainly yes
2009-11-12T07:19:00.000Z	mbrigdan	Mike_lifeguard	Its just that the upgrade wants to install apache, and I'm thinking that the only reason would be if I can't have lighttpd anymore. It also wants to drop selinux and install apparmor. Is that normal?
2009-11-12T07:19:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	mbrigdan	no clue, sorry
