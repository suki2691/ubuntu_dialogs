2006-09-15T14:00:00.000Z	mcd	Tonren	on the FAQ it says i need to login into the Debian site to do something to allow me to connect to a site via SSL
2006-09-15T14:02:00.000Z	mcd	Tonren	do you know how to set a site to connect SSL using gFTP?
2006-09-15T14:02:00.000Z	Tonren	mcd	Hmm, I don't, but I don't think you really need the default sites to d oit.
