2010-01-20T08:35:00.000Z	ryanCH	onetinsoldier	well ubuntu configured it all automatically .. so what do i need to do to install the new video card
2010-01-20T08:37:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ryanCH	i'm not sure. it used to be a command like 'dpkg-reconfigure -plow xserver-xorg' - but i'm not sure if that command is it anymore
