2011-03-02T07:47:00.000Z	Mios		I need some help. I am trying to install Ubuntu 10.04 64 bit on an AMD64 computer, yet I don't seem to understand partitioning for it. I do not want to erase my entire hard drive.
2011-03-02T07:48:00.000Z	Mios		I had 32 bit on my desktop, and it's install process was great. I do not know how to partition this one correctly to not screw it up.

2011-03-02T07:55:00.000Z	BlkSvr	Mios	Then getcha geeky glasses on and read about partitions, your about to learn how computer software devides physical media :)
