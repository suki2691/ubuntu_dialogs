2008-08-26T12:52:00.000Z	Kohlrak	gregge	that's what wikipedia says.. and i hope it isn't, as i havn't seen a beta up yet... they did this with hardy and look what happened.
2008-08-26T12:54:00.000Z	gregge	Kohlrak	Ok.. I certainly have to agree hardy isn't stable enough.. Are there usually betas before?
2008-08-26T12:54:00.000Z	Kohlrak	gregge	there was a beta of hardy, but they released it on schedual instead of holding it off to make sure it's stable enough first.
