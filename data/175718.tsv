2006-07-14T11:02:00.000Z	londondave	CarlFK	have you the codecs, mplayer should play anything
2006-07-14T11:03:00.000Z	CarlFK	londondave	mplayer won't play it if mplayer doesn't get run :)
2006-07-14T11:04:00.000Z	londondave	CarlFK	take deFrysk's advice you just need to set the app that should run when you click a wmv file extension
