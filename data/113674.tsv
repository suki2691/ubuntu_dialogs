2009-08-03T10:08:00.000Z	Exhahe		prapp193: make sure the proper workgroup is listed.. a reboot I think is required after completion of install/configuration
2009-08-03T10:09:00.000Z	prappl93	Exhahe	how do I set up Samba... I have it installed, but dunno how to config it
2009-08-03T10:11:00.000Z	prappl93	Exhahe	but there are two networks that our house has set up that I want to hop back and forth between, does that mean that I will have to mess with it when changing between them?
