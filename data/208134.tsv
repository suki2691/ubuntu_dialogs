2005-11-09T08:32:00.000Z	penguinbrat	jaramillo	I think the list is in /etc/DIRCOLORS, but what is coming to mind is a fifo...
2005-11-09T08:32:00.000Z	jaramillo	penguinbrat	no /etc/DIR* here
2005-11-09T08:35:00.000Z	penguinbrat	jaramillo	i guess ubuntu is just using the default colors or something, DIRCOLORS is a config file for it... try man'ing ls see if it gives you the color coding...
