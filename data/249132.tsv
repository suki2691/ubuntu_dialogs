2007-10-31T16:56:00.000Z	jens_		Hello, I have a machine ubuntu 7.10. This box has a lot of music/video's on it. I have a privat lan network at home; and I would like to share this music/video with f.ex. my sister, who is running microsoft windows. Is there a way I could stream the content to her pc?
2007-10-31T16:58:00.000Z	jens_		no, it's the other way around, my ubuntu pc has the content; I need to stream it to a windows box
