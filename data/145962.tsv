2007-02-13T16:11:00.000Z	linxeh	agliv_	AMD created the 64bit extensions for the opteron. Intel then copied them to stay in the game
2007-02-13T16:13:00.000Z	agliv_	linxeh	so the 64-bit PC version is also for Intel Core 2 Duo processors?  Why doesn't it say that on Ubuntu.com?
2007-02-13T16:16:00.000Z	linxeh	agliv_	dunno; generally the EM64_T extensions are refered to as amd64 I guess
