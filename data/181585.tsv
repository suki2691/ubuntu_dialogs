2006-06-06T09:09:00.000Z	directhex|work	vladootz	1) why run a 1-year-old version? 2) logged in where? a text prompt? that suggests that your graphics hardware wasn't configured
2006-06-06T09:11:00.000Z	vladootz	directhex|work	i logged to the text promt i guess... it says "user@computername: ~$" and i can type commands... how do i go to ubuntu desktop?
2006-06-06T09:12:00.000Z	directhex|work	vladootz	try "aptitude install ubuntu-desktop". you should never get a console prompt on a standard ubuntu installation, unless you don't have the desktop packages installed, or your hardware isn't configured correctly
