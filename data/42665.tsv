2010-10-04T05:53:00.000Z	DanDare		Hello. I have Win7 and Ubuntu in this computer. I want to wipe GRUB boot loader, how to do it ? I tried old DOS fdisk /mbr but isnt working, probably because NTFS. Any clue ?
2010-10-04T05:54:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	DanDare	windows 7 install disk?
2010-10-04T05:57:00.000Z	DanDare	aeon-ltd	tried yet the win7 install disk but no deal
