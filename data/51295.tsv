2012-08-04T02:40:00.000Z	levis		hi, is there any repo for updated chromium versions? I've one, but the last is 18.x, now there is 21.x
2012-08-04T02:42:00.000Z	trism	levis	12.10 has 20 as does the webapps preview ppa, though if you really want to stay updated, probably better to use chrome for now until someone starts working full time on chromium in ubuntu again
2012-08-04T02:43:00.000Z	levis	trism	oh, so no one is taking care of chromium :-/ I'd prefer chromium than chrome..
2012-08-04T02:44:00.000Z	trism	levis	yeah, me too
