2010-05-11T21:25:00.000Z	dj_segfault		Due to my problems with nvidia discussed earlier, I am going to try to upgrade from 9.10 to 10.04.  Does 10.04 use the same version of MythTV, or will I have to upgrade my backend too?
2010-05-11T21:26:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	dj_segfault	i think it's a newer version, but i'm not sure. you could probably find out by visiting --> http://packages.ubuntu.com/
2010-05-11T21:28:00.000Z	dj_segfault	onetinsoldier	Clarification: When I upgraded from 9.04 to 9.10, Mythtv's API had changed along with the version so I had to upgrade all my machines.  If the Mythtv change is minor, I shouldn't have that problem.  I'm trying to recover from a laptop crash, so I don't have my full laptop at my disposal to do the research, only a tiny netbook.
