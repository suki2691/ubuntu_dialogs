2009-09-12T00:05:00.000Z	ubuntu	G_A_C	That's a thought, is there a defrag tool in Ubuntu I can use? Kinda lazy to switch OSes :)
2009-09-12T00:06:00.000Z	G_A_C	ubuntu	I don't believe so, no. And I would rather defrag NTFS from its native operating system, that's pretty IO intensive and I'd hate to show up an ntfs-3g bug in ubuntu
2009-09-12T00:06:00.000Z	ubuntu	G_A_C	that is a good point. thanks man
