2008-09-20T09:37:00.000Z	hml		way OT: for a us citizen to travel abroad, what documentation do i need? (or rather where can i look this up; google searches returns result of ppl leaving the us permenantely; i just want to travel)
2008-09-20T09:39:00.000Z	hml		what should i be googling for? i feel this has to be well documented somewhere on the internet
2008-09-20T09:39:00.000Z	hml		wait; if i'm going to HK, i don't need this?
