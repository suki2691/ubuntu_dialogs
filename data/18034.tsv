2011-03-04T14:23:00.000Z	dtrf4837	mickster04	do you mean i might as well not bother with the password if i have to write them down or if both the login password and admin password are going to be the same?
2011-03-04T14:23:00.000Z	mickster04	dtrf4837	if you write them down, probable security risk imo
