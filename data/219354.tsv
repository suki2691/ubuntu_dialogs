2011-01-01T14:44:00.000Z	_6502_		hello... how do I shut down that F**KING DUMB self proclaimed "smart" tab completion ?
2011-01-01T14:44:00.000Z	Flannel	_6502_	Please mind your language.  Which tab completion?  What software?
2011-01-01T14:48:00.000Z	Flannel	_6502_	In what software? firefox? a terminal? some other program?
2011-01-01T14:49:00.000Z	Flannel	_6502_	To be honest, I'm not sure what smart tab completion you're talking about.  Is it substituting for what you've already typed somehow? or can you give an example?  my bash tab completion always does what I think your target behavior is
