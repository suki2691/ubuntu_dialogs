2005-04-06T11:22:00.000Z	srv		I'm trying to install the KDE packages with Synaptic, but when I mark it for installation, it tells me a bunch of required files have unresolved dependencies then tells me to make sure I have all the correct repositories added.  When I go to: Settings -> Repositories, I have all of them checked.
2005-04-06T11:22:00.000Z	srv		Anyone have any idea whats wrong?
2005-04-06T11:22:00.000Z	queuetue	srv	are you doing a dist-upgrade?
2005-04-06T11:23:00.000Z	queuetue	srv	*have* you done a dist-upgrade would be a bettter question.
