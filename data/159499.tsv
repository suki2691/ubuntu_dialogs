2006-11-25T08:54:00.000Z	ryanakca		how do I block all services from the outside except ssh, http and https? I've been messing around with iptables all day with no success... Firestarter and Guarddog are not what I'm looking for. Any suggestions?

2006-11-25T09:09:00.000Z	ryanakca	GenNMX	I wonder why I never found out about quicktables earlier... I was trying to do something manually all day that only took about 5 minutes with it...
