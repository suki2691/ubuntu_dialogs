2008-12-05T02:51:00.000Z	Yeermania4		consider a standard 8*8 chessboard consisting of 64 small squares coloured in the usual patterns, so 32 are black and 32 are white. A zigzag path across the board is a collection of eight white squares, one in each row, which meet at their corners. how many zigzag paths are there?
