2009-06-15T21:55:00.000Z	TeRMX_		I had to use Unetbootin because my operating system was destroyed. I have no blank disks, nor flash drives. How would I install windows from a partition?
2009-06-15T21:55:00.000Z	TeRMX_		I'm trying to install OSx86, but I cannot format the Partition because in OSx86 is shows as "FAT32"
