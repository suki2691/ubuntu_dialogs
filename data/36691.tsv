2010-03-02T13:56:00.000Z	Unislash		hey all, i was wondering what your opinions on using gparted to *resize* my windows partition (ntfs of course) is. i'm making it larger, if it matters (for storage) :-)
2010-03-02T13:57:00.000Z	Unislash		i've read places that it's kind of risky to resize partitions, but i have no idea what effects chances or even what kind of chances there are... hence the question

After resizing, boot into Windows twice to allow Windows to perform its checking operations.
