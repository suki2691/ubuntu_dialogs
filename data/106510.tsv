2010-11-13T23:42:00.000Z	jkp		question: i have used an lvm volume as a virtual disk for a KVM based VM.  The VM treated the disk as a block device and put its own partition table on it (GPT).  what i need to do now is mount one of those partions in the KVM host...does anyone know how i can do this?  I can see the partition using parted, but there is no block device for it...im a bit lost
