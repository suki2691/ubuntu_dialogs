2009-04-29T17:35:00.000Z	zzxxzz		I just did another complete install of 9.04 and still have problems networking. Wiki's, and googling has not helped. Anyone know how to properly set up networking?
2009-04-29T17:36:00.000Z	RizR	zzxxzz	what exactly do you want to setup it like?
2009-04-29T17:37:00.000Z	zzxxzz	RizR	I have both a wired and wireless, the desktop icon for Network manager indicates a wireless connection, but I'm connected using the wired and can't figure how to set up the wireless.
2009-04-29T17:41:00.000Z	zzxxzz	RizR	When I right click network manager, connection information, it says "no valid active connections found" but I can browse. I need this computer to use it's wireless connection, but when I try to set it up I lose all connectivity.
