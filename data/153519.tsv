2007-02-02T11:45:00.000Z	cstextile1	LjL	do you have the database?
2007-02-02T11:47:00.000Z	LjL	cstextile1	no, only on the server which i can't access... the database can be generated from the "Packages" lists in repositories by the script itself, though - except you still need the schema (but it should be guessable from the queries that the script does)
2007-02-02T11:47:00.000Z	LjL	cstextile1	you can probably get those Packages list from my site, but then they're the same as the ones you find on archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
