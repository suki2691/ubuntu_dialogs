2005-10-31T13:24:00.000Z	Anjay		Hi folks. I was wondering, how good is Ubuntu at partioning NTFS? I've a 250GB SATA hard drive, currently with 1 fat and 2 ntfs partitions and i want to resize the ntfs ones.
2005-10-31T13:25:00.000Z	frank	Anjay	ubuntu can partition but it can't format ntfs. windows will have to format later
2005-10-31T13:26:00.000Z	Anjay	frank	could you explain a bit more? Why will Windows then have to format the partition?
2005-10-31T13:26:00.000Z	frank	Anjay	ubuntu can create the partition ("the space") but not format ntfs (create the filesystem)
