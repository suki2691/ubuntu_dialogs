2010-03-10T04:17:00.000Z	amaur		Hello! After updating to karmic, I seem to be missing the file FindCompiz.cmake. Isn't this file supposed to come as part of compiz? Should I reinstall compiz to get it back?

2010-03-10T04:19:00.000Z	amaur	GeekSquid	oh, ok. but universe is already enabled in my package sources
2010-03-10T04:21:00.000Z	amaur	GeekSquid	a simple sudo aptitude reinstall compiz did not have any noticable effect
