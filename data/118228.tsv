2008-01-26T22:46:00.000Z	xoqa		hai, my internet doesn't work with my kubuntu distrobution... it had been working fine until i rebooted. and earlier, i had did a "sudo aptitude upgrade".. i'm thinking that has something to do with it, or maybe my iptables are not allowing me to access the internet?
2008-01-26T22:47:00.000Z	xoqa		how do you look at your startup log?
