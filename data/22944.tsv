2011-11-07T20:10:00.000Z	QuikNik		hey all, i'm thinking about switching my one desktop to Ubuntu but I am not a big fan of Unity... is there any way to use Gnome2 like came default in 10.10 with the newer revisions like 11.04, 11.10 or the upcoming 12.04 LTS?  I just prefer Gnome2

2011-11-07T20:12:00.000Z	QuikNik		I haven't tried 11.10 yet, has unity changed much since 11.04?
2011-11-07T20:13:00.000Z	QuikNik	Sidewinder1	yeah or just say the heck with it and keep a 10.10 installation hjehe
