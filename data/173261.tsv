2010-11-20T22:52:00.000Z	FreakyCheeseMan		Hey all. Semi-new Linux user here trying to dual-boot Ubuntu on my new machine (this one), having problems. Anyone care to help?
2010-11-20T22:53:00.000Z	FreakyCheeseMan		Ok. I told windows 7 to shrink it's partition space by 500 gigs, which worked- it says there's that much unalocated space. However, when I try to install ubuntu, it says it doesn't have the 2.something gigs it needs, and won't let me proceed.
2010-11-20T22:53:00.000Z	FreakyCheeseMan		Oh, 10.10, 64 bit.
2010-11-20T22:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	FreakyCheeseMan	how did you try to dual boot?
