2009-05-03T16:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mello	 you mean a 'music' cd ?
2009-05-03T16:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mello	 what are you trying to do exactly? Pop it in. and gnome 'should' pop up a 'play this' dialog.. or you could run some cd-player app.
2009-05-03T16:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mello	 you DONT 'mount' audio cd's  normally. :)
