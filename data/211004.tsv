2007-12-26T22:59:00.000Z	dm		Hello. I have a usb webcam 0c45:602c which is supported by the ubuntu included gspca driver. When plugging it in the driver is loaded and /dev/video0 is created. But I get error messages when trying to use it: xawtv says "X Error of failed request:  XF86DGANoDirectVideoMode", camorama "Could not connect to /dev/video0". It's an ATI video card (if that matters). Any idea?

2007-12-26T23:02:00.000Z	MenZa	dm	there wasn't. We don't get that well-phrased questions a lot.
2007-12-26T23:02:00.000Z	MenZa	dm	but alas, this is offtopic---carry on, and good luck.
