2009-06-16T00:46:00.000Z	Hydrant		hey all... do I actually need 64 bit ubuntu for seeing > 4GB of memory?
2009-06-16T00:47:00.000Z	Slart	Hydrant	yes, or the server kernel
2009-06-16T00:47:00.000Z	Slart	Hydrant	I think the server kernel has PAE enabled
2009-06-16T00:48:00.000Z	Slart	Hydrant	but I would recommend 64 bit over the server kernel
