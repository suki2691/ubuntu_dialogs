2010-08-27T18:10:00.000Z	x-ip		Hi, i downloaded the iso 32 bit  from ubuntu 10.04 and when it tries to boot i'm getting a uncompression error system halted, any ideas ? :)
2010-08-27T18:11:00.000Z	bazhang	x-ip	md5 the iso ? burn at low speed then do the disk integrity check?
2010-08-27T18:11:00.000Z	x-ip	bazhang	the md5 is fine, and i tryed to use it with virtual box (to discard the burns erros) and getting the same error
2010-08-27T18:15:00.000Z	x-ip	bazhang	yes, the difference is that i'm not upgrading, =)
