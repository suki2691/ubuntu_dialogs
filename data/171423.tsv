2006-12-11T10:17:00.000Z	ThePub	tuxub	have you tried just putting a disk into them?
2006-12-11T10:18:00.000Z	tuxub	ThePub	yes :)... one of them doesnt appear. the other is there but when I put a disc in it does nothing. when I click in it it says: mount: block device /dev/hdd is write-protected, mounting read-only
