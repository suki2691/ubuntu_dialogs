2007-07-13T09:42:00.000Z	abli	OldPink	no I dont, because I moved all my data to an old_data/ directory. So if the installer would be willing to do what i want, I would simply end up with a fresh install, and with my data in /old_data/ .Thats all

2007-07-13T09:43:00.000Z	MrElendig	abli	that's why you shoud use a seperate /home partion
