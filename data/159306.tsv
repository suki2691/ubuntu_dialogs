2007-12-01T00:31:00.000Z	Zaehlas		Hello, I had an error with the 64 bit version upgrade of 7.10.  The update manager package failed, and now there's no way for me to upgrade my system.  It says everything is up to date, even though it isn't.  Is there any way to force the upgrade to run again, or look through the logs to fix the failed package?
2007-12-01T00:32:00.000Z	Dynalon	Zaehlas	try the console version: apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
2007-12-01T00:34:00.000Z	Zaehlas	Dynalon	OK, I'll try that real quick, and see what happens.
2007-12-01T00:35:00.000Z	Zaehlas	Dynalon	Thanks, it may be proceeding.  I have to watch for errors, but I'll stay in the room.
