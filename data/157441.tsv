2008-06-22T22:51:00.000Z	technel		I am using the ATI proprietary drivers and whenever my screensaver comes up, I cannot get the screen to come back on unless I restart X. Any ideas?
2008-06-22T22:53:00.000Z	apophis	technel	do you use compiz and a OpenGL screenserver?
2008-06-22T22:53:00.000Z	technel	apophis	No, it is buggy for me, so I have effects disabled
2008-06-22T22:54:00.000Z	apophis	technel	ok, no idea
