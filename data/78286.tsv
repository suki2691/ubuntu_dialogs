2011-06-11T21:07:00.000Z	milind		hi guys, i was wondering if you could help me with something. I am running ubuntu on virtual box, and started working on a lot of my projects there. But lately it has been running kind of slow. It shows i have just 2 gigs remaining in virtual harddisk available. I am not sure if that is the problem but can u give me some tips to optimize performance of ubuntu in virtual box
