2008-07-12T13:41:00.000Z	joseph_		I'm trying to use hwinfo to get some information about my hardware, but for some reason it wont accept any modifiers, such as hwinfo -short. Am I doing something wrong?
2008-07-12T13:41:00.000Z	joseph_		I figured it out... should be hwinfo --short
2008-07-12T13:41:00.000Z	euz734	joseph_	maybe it has to be long option syntax: --short
2008-07-12T13:43:00.000Z	joseph_	euz734	yep, that was it, thanks
