2009-10-19T09:43:00.000Z	Kajros		I am curious why is it when Grub loader boots up it shows 2 versions of ubuntu but I only have 1 installed?
2009-10-19T09:43:00.000Z	Bluey	Kajros	It's the previous kernel versions
2009-10-19T09:44:00.000Z	Bluey	Kajros	I had issues with v 15 and had to use v 14 for awhile - this easily gave me that option
2009-10-19T09:45:00.000Z	Bluey	Kajros	naw, that's normal....
