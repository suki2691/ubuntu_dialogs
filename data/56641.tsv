2011-11-04T17:44:00.000Z	puff		I have a thinkpad t520 running 10.4 LTS.  Loathe though I am to leave LTS, I need to upgrade to get various things working.  What's the safest way to do this?

2011-11-04T17:46:00.000Z	velcroshooz	puff	i just went from 10.10 to 11.10 today incrementally. it may not be the best choice but its doable .. havent seen any issues yet.
