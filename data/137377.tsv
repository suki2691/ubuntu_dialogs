2007-04-21T10:52:00.000Z	coopster	steharg79_	any section in particular, or are you suggesting I should read the whole thing?
2007-04-21T10:53:00.000Z	steharg79_	coopster	- depends what you need help with - almost everything is covered there though
2007-04-21T10:54:00.000Z	coopster	steharg79_	no, that is incorrect.  when i say i've been googling, i mean it.  i am having a problem that is not mentioned on the internet and has very few error messages to start from.  i need an experienced ubuntu person to give me a hand, not a link to the new user guide.
