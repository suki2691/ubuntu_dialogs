2006-07-31T13:02:00.000Z	_libra_		I have a pc with breezy, a swap and a fat 32 partition. Once I insert the Dapper CD installation and arrive to the partitioning step it sais there's no partition (and shows all the space as unasigned), what can I do?
2006-07-31T13:03:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	_libra_	use the alternate cd and upgrade, or follow the !upgrade instructions
2006-07-31T13:04:00.000Z	_libra_	fyrestrtr	where can I find that instructions?
