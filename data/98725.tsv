2008-04-27T22:29:00.000Z	Wobbo		I am really desperate, do i need to change back to ubuntu 32bit to be able to play World of Warcraft under wine? I've installed WoW 3 times now under wine in ubuntu 8.04 64b, still keep getting segmentation error. The WoW installations runs fine. Wine does make start menu entries but without icons (it does under 32)? Help?
