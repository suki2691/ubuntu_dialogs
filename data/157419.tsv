2006-11-24T17:18:00.000Z	TuxN00b		I have some questions about installation/partitioning
2006-11-24T17:20:00.000Z	TuxN00b		is it actually feasable to install ubuntu alongside a windows partition without having to format my harddrive and losing everything?
2006-11-24T17:21:00.000Z	scrambled2486	TuxN00b	yes
2006-11-24T17:21:00.000Z	scrambled2486	TuxN00b	the Ubuntu installer can resize windows partitions
