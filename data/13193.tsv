2011-06-16T01:46:00.000Z	UbuntuHero		Good evening? I am using Ubuntu Lucid 10.04 at the moment. Is it possible to install the latest version of Ubuntu I think it is 11.04, but without that Unity crap? I really love Ubuntu and swear by it to everyone I come across, but Unity is a piece of retarded fucking shit and I really would prefer to not have that on my Ubuntu. Thanks in advance. :-)
