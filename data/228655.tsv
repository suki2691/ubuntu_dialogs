2005-08-08T07:36:00.000Z	reka	spola	try this: right-click on file with extension you want to change> properties > select custom icon...
2005-08-08T07:37:00.000Z	spola	reka	does that work for all files or just that one?
2005-08-08T07:38:00.000Z	reka	spola	honestly, not sure.....one way of finding out. :)
