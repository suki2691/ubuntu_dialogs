2011-07-10T18:41:00.000Z	sublime		Hi, rhin0 tells me that it is better to use python for shell scripting than a scripting language like bash or csh. Is this true?
2011-07-10T18:43:00.000Z	oCean	sublime	There is no single "best". Each has its uses.
2011-07-10T18:43:00.000Z	sublime	oCean	of course. I am asking specifically about shell scripting
2011-07-10T18:44:00.000Z	oCean	sublime	it depends on what you want to do. It's quite a generic discussion, so you might also try the relevant channels and/or ##linux
