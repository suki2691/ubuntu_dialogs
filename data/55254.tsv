2010-08-22T05:05:00.000Z	NinoScript		hello! I want to know what's all the differences between desktop and netbook editions. Do they get different default applications?
2010-08-22T05:06:00.000Z	edbian	NinoScript	That is the difference.  The netbook edition has some software that runs instead of the typical desktop and panels.
2010-08-22T05:07:00.000Z	NinoScript	edbian	but, aside interface, are there any changes? like pidgin instead of empathy or something like that? where can I read about that?
2010-08-22T05:08:00.000Z	edbian	NinoScript	I don't know of any differences like that.  I don't know where you'd find that either.
