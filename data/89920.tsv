2008-05-30T08:36:00.000Z	dhamma	anirudh0	i've had audio problems from ktorrent taking control of my audio, but it was never anything that couldn't be fixed by closing ktorrent or (at worst) rebooting
2008-05-30T08:36:00.000Z	anirudh0	dhamma	it is not ktorrent, but arts that controls the audio..hence sudo killall artsd will help
2008-05-30T08:38:00.000Z	dhamma	anirudh0	i have ktorrent running right now and this is what happens: killall artsd
