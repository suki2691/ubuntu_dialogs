2007-09-01T07:57:00.000Z	Jobias	oj	is your card one of the 8 series (ie. dx10 compatible)?
2007-09-01T07:57:00.000Z	Jobias	oj	lol, that happened to me too. lemme guess, x11 error on ubuntu startup?
2007-09-01T07:58:00.000Z	Jobias	oj	i had that problem with my 8800 gts. i used http://www.albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html after futzing about for a whole weekend and then it worked. dunno if it'll work right away though; i had to do a lot of tweaking beforehand
