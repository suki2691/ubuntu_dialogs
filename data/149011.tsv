2007-02-04T11:12:00.000Z	jackson3246		hey for some reason my keyboard (PS/2 connection) refuses to work with edgy live. the numlock light stays green, but pressing the numlock (or ANY other) key does nothing. any ideas why?
2007-02-04T11:12:00.000Z	unop	jackson3246	 is it a non-standard keyboard?
2007-02-04T11:13:00.000Z	jackson3246	unop	I can't imagine it is. it's just a US English PS/2
2007-02-04T11:16:00.000Z	unop	jackson3246	 hmm, can you verify that the keyboard works sometime during the bootup of the live CD?
