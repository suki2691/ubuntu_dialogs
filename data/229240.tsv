2007-04-23T14:43:00.000Z	matt1982		hi im having trouble with my system, fresh install of 6.06 then i ran the updater to upgrade to 6.10 it downloaded and installed everything then went to reset. Now the system wont boot it displays the Ubuntu loading bar then after that i get a cursor on a black screen and the keyboard goes to sleep. It happens on reset and from off to on too. Any ideas about this? How to start even tackling...
2007-04-23T14:43:00.000Z	matt1982		...this problem?
2007-04-23T14:45:00.000Z	matt1982		is there a "safe mode" i can boot into maybe in Ubuntu? so i can view logs and see why the system is hanging on boot?
