2006-08-09T10:35:00.000Z	Sivik	AllenA	run glxgears -printfps and inform us of what you get
2006-08-09T10:36:00.000Z	Sivik	AllenA	there is a way to add the line in the xorg.conf
2006-08-09T10:44:00.000Z	Sivik	AllenA	then you don't have the drivers installed  correctly, i have a friend with a tnt 2 and it runs just over 1k fps when the drivers are installed correctly
