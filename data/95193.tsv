2008-04-09T16:21:00.000Z	un0p	iliya_	perhaps this works.. sudo apt-get install --reinstall network-manager knetworkmanager
2008-04-09T16:25:00.000Z	iliya_	un0p	tried that dont work
2008-04-09T16:27:00.000Z	un0p	iliya_	try this, if it doesn't work, i'm out of ideas.  sudo apt-get install --reinstall $(dpkg -l | grep -i net | cut -c 3-30)
