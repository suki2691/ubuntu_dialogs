2005-11-20T13:54:00.000Z	agtnz		How do I open ports with Linux, like for torrents etc? I tried installing firestarter but it crashes on me...
2005-11-20T13:55:00.000Z	polpak	agtnz	 really?? I haven't had any issues with it. When does it crash?
2005-11-20T13:56:00.000Z	agtnz	polpak	I uninstalled it now, but it was after the first screen, just when I pressed 'next'. I'm using a server install of breezy w/ xubuntu installed, that might affect it
2005-11-20T13:57:00.000Z	polpak	agtnz	I'm not sure.. I assume you have all the gome libs etc?
