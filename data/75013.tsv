2008-12-25T02:19:00.000Z	BobPenguin		I'm installing ubuntu on a friend's box. His got an old celeron 750 machine. What would be the lightest linux distribution to install? I would need something that would stand in a good light compared to the win98 already installed in the box
2008-12-25T02:20:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	BobPenguin	i'm usually happy with standard ubuntu. if the box has 5120MB RAM. otherwise you may want to try xubuntu
2008-12-25T02:22:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	BobPenguin	probably not. how much RAM does it haev?
2008-12-25T02:23:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	BobPenguin	that should work. it may help if you stop all unneded services.
