2011-04-12T10:27:00.000Z	Milossh		hello. USB disk creator does not work with some of the .iso types. Can you tell me how to convert an raw CD iso image to ubuntu version of it?
2011-04-12T10:27:00.000Z	Milossh		it seems like there's ubuntu compatible iso format
2011-04-12T10:28:00.000Z	randomuser	Milossh	there's no special 'ubuntu' version of a disk image....
2011-04-12T10:29:00.000Z	Milossh	randomuser	but startup disk creator cannot recognize some of the iso files
