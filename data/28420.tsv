2010-07-24T10:53:00.000Z	gbear14275		I've been noticing during my kernel upgrades some odd behavior during my crub config generation.  errors that look like this: "File descriptor 3 (pipe:[3580460]) leaked on lvs invocation. Parent PID 2199: /bin/sh"  Can anyone tell me what that is?
2010-07-24T10:53:00.000Z	gbear14275		I'm wondering if it's something I should try to address
