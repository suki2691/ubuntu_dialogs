2012-02-15T02:47:00.000Z	sskalnik		Though if you are insanely paranoid, I personally recommend NOD32. I use it on my Windoze box, and it's so effective I can download malware for fun.

2012-02-15T02:49:00.000Z	sskalnik	mustafaerhann	 Yes. Though if all you are doing is scanning a system for Win viruses - say, you have a samba server that is also used by Windows boxen though you host it on Ubuntu - you might look at the free ClamAV
