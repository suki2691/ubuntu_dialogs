2008-11-23T00:50:00.000Z	LF|Irssi	amaranth	i was too having the same prob of .php files downloading , so i just installed ubuntu server edition, and installed gnome over that and it worked :)
2008-11-23T00:53:00.000Z	LF|Irssi	amaranth	i was installing from some "HOWTO" i found on google, i can't remember all the software that it told me to use,
2008-11-23T00:56:00.000Z	LF|Irssi	amaranth	i would say if you have nothing to loose, just install ubuntu server edition, tell it to install all the apache/php stuff, and install gnome on top of that if you want a GUI
2008-11-23T00:58:00.000Z	LF|Irssi	amaranth	i see, ok, well maybe try joining #Apache or #apache2 not sure which, they might be able to help more :)
