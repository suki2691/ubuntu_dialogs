2012-02-24T03:37:00.000Z	martian	Admin_User	Yeah, why not just download 10.04 LTS instead?
2012-02-24T03:38:00.000Z	martian	Admin_User	if anything, you'll be creating yourself more confusion by doing so
2012-02-24T03:41:00.000Z	martian	Admin_User	oh yeah I suppose that's fine then, but it's still a little goofy :)
