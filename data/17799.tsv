2011-10-16T19:07:00.000Z	dpierce	diverdude	mtpaint is pretty quick and dirty
2011-10-16T19:07:00.000Z	diverdude	dpierce	yep, its wonderful...simple and has all necessary functions
2011-10-16T19:08:00.000Z	dpierce	diverdude	the kde paint program is the most mspaint-like one ive seen though. have to pull in all those deps though
