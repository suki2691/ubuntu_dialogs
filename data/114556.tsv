2010-02-28T11:14:00.000Z	joshuah	freezway	did you install warcraft 3? cuz you should be able to use regedit to set it, that's a warcraft 3 thing
2010-02-28T11:15:00.000Z	joshuah	freezway	http://warcraft.freakygaming.com/tutorials/running_warcraft_3_in_widescreen.html says you can edit "HKEY_CURRENT_USER > Software > Blizzard Entertainment > Warcraft III > Video" with regedit to change your resolution (in windows or wine)
2010-02-28T11:19:00.000Z	joshuah	freezway	np, but if you go into Options > Video in warcraft 3 you'll hafta reset it again ^^
