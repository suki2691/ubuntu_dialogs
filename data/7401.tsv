2011-12-02T00:25:00.000Z	Guest1965		i installed ubuntu 10.04 as a second os on my win xp computer, i've installed the proprietary graphics driver, but scrolling web pages with alot of graphics is noticeable choppier/laggier than in xp, is there anything to do about this?

2011-12-02T00:27:00.000Z	rypervenche	Guest1965	Did you restart afterward?
