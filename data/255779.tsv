2005-12-06T17:25:00.000Z	calamari	ruairi	they seem to work in all gnome apps for me.. kde too
2005-12-06T17:25:00.000Z	calamari	ruairi	I rarely use them tho.. I prefer the ancient Ctrl-Ins, Shift-Ins, Shift-Del combos
2005-12-06T17:27:00.000Z	calamari	ruairi	for the terminal I usually middle click to paste.. dunno, sorry
