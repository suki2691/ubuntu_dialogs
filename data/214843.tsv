2006-01-10T13:26:00.000Z	Chris_Tucker		i need help with my monitor horizontal sync range! its way out of wack, the picture is skewed and overlapping.. i have a picture but only via dcc or anonymous ftp if available.. imageshack is broken here :(
2006-01-10T13:27:00.000Z	Chris_Tucker		right now im using 31.4 in my xorg.conf, thats the closest i can get to sqare, if i raise this, it gets overlapped more and skewed beyond visability
2006-01-10T13:27:00.000Z	sas171	Chris_Tucker	your xorg.conf is probably wrong
2006-01-10T13:27:00.000Z	Chris_Tucker	sas171	i know. but i kneed help finding the right ranges... if i didnt know i wouldnt know what was wrong ;)
