2011-04-24T09:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		Hmm - i click on a torrent file here. it asks to open with transmission <default> here,  Not even sure where the system gets those default apps from. MIME types perhaps
2011-04-24T09:41:00.000Z	eric	Dr_Willis	have you tried "Tixati"?  Best torrent program, hands down!  Deluge and Transmission have nothing on it
