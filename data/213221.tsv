2005-11-04T11:09:00.000Z	BassHombre		I can suspend my laptop from the GNOME log out menu, but the ACPI sleep.sh script doesn't work.
2005-11-04T11:10:00.000Z	BassHombre		This seems to be a common problem (judging by the forums), but no one seems to have found a solution
2005-11-04T11:10:00.000Z	BassHombre		What script / program does the log out menu run?
2005-11-04T11:10:00.000Z	mustard5	BassHombre	I'm not sure
