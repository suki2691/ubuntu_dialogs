2006-10-29T12:01:00.000Z	amiyourjuliet		I'm trying to build from src, and I get this error:       "make: Nothing to be done for `all'."
2006-10-29T12:01:00.000Z	amiyourjuliet		what does that mean?
2006-10-29T12:03:00.000Z	lostat1	amiyourjuliet	It means you have made it already now its time for make install
2006-10-29T12:05:00.000Z	amiyourjuliet	lostat1	i did make install, and i get: teg:~/gsopcast-0.2.8/src$ sudo make install
