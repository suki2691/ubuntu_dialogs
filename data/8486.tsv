2012-01-05T03:29:00.000Z	ZooMonkey		Hey all! I have a setup I'm required to run for a piece of hardware that needs setup. Near the end of it's setup, it runs- "rm /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules" , which would remove my net rules. I am then told to reboot. Will rebooting auto-re-build the persistent.rules file??? Will my net work afterwords?

2012-01-05T03:31:00.000Z	ZooMonkey		it is also after the install of vnc. Would that make sense? Would setting up VNC need that to be changed I wonder?
2012-01-05T03:31:00.000Z	ZooMonkey	Chipzzz	Yeah not a bad idea
