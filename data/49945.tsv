2010-10-26T05:30:00.000Z	xiven		Can someone please help me with why Wubi always gives an error at 99-100% that says it couldn't retrieve the installation files?
2010-10-26T05:32:00.000Z	xiven		I also notice that pyrun seems to have a big problem at start with error dialogs saying drive not available or something, it probably gives me 15-20 of them "right off the bat". I just keep clicking the mouse and the installer pops up shortly.
2010-10-26T05:33:00.000Z	xiven		cd5 sounds like a command-line utility for reading or writing a cd.
2010-10-26T05:35:00.000Z	seidos	xiven	sudo apt-cache search cd5 says it's a checksum checker for tracks on a cd or something
