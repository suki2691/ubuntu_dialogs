2008-02-01T23:48:00.000Z	JewStyleKungFu		I can move my mouse around, but no amount of mouse clicking will actually cause the OS to respond...

2008-02-01T23:51:00.000Z	serenityUK	JewStyleKungFu	if you have programs running outside of the X windows such as downloads in text mode they keep going without stopping... linux is desing as a multiuser system an not to break everything
