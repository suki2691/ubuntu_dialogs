2007-01-21T11:09:00.000Z	Gabby_Hayes		Why does edgy have a different /etc/fstab than other distros?  am trying to put a second HD into /etc/fstab,  but it seems that I need a "UUID=  " entry.  Where do I get that UUID= ?
2007-01-21T11:09:00.000Z	adaptr	Gabby_Hayes	of course you don't *need* a UUID
2007-01-21T11:09:00.000Z	adaptr	Gabby_Hayes	Ubuntu uses it to enable some magic
2007-01-21T11:14:00.000Z	Gabby_Hayes	adaptr	   so there isn't a comand  apt-get -f purge  microsoft,  yet?  :-(
