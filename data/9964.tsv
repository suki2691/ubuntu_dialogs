2011-10-25T10:58:00.000Z	Stanley00	Bear10	you can try "ls -l" and then look for the file name, you will know what it means... ;)
2011-10-25T11:01:00.000Z	Stanley00	Bear10	haha, I confuse too... may be it's just a dir,
2011-10-25T11:02:00.000Z	Stanley00	Bear10	I rarely use color code to identify a file type, just use ls -l.
