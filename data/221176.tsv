2008-10-12T16:05:00.000Z	z0r		What is wrong with this sh script http://rafb.net/p/PdMuLw81.html ? I am getting error 24: "Syntax error: end of file unexpected (expecting "then")
2008-10-12T16:06:00.000Z	BlueEagle	z0r	that script is not 24 lines long.
2008-10-12T16:07:00.000Z	BlueEagle	z0r	also #bash might be a more appropriate place to ask. It might be the ; before then
2008-10-12T16:07:00.000Z	BlueEagle	z0r	not sure though.
