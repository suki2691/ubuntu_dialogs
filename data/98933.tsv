2008-06-04T20:28:00.000Z	legend2440	phoenix3051	in the dropdown box "Run in terminal"
2008-06-04T20:32:00.000Z	legend2440	phoenix3051	try this right click on desktop choose Create Launcher. now see the Type box? choose Application in terminal. is that there?
2008-06-04T20:33:00.000Z	legend2440	phoenix3051	are you creating new launcher or trying to edit existing one?
