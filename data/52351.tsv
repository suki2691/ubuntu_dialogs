2010-06-05T07:04:00.000Z	browserice		can someone help me with my problem ?  10.04 Live CDs are OK, md5 checksums are OK, all previous versions work ok on my monitor but not 10.04 live cd
2010-06-05T07:04:00.000Z	arleslie	browserice	does your monitor have an "auto" button?
2010-06-05T07:05:00.000Z	arleslie	browserice	or do you get an error while using the CD?
2010-06-05T07:06:00.000Z	arleslie	browserice	when some live cds boot it messes with the screen, try booting the cd and hitting the auto button and see if it'll bring the screen back
