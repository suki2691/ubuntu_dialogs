2008-11-30T21:56:00.000Z	NetEcho		is there a way to have more then 4gb of ram on the 32bit version of Ubuntu?
2008-11-30T21:57:00.000Z	NetEcho		but I've heard that Ubuntu doesn't have support with 32bit from other people
2008-11-30T21:57:00.000Z	Konsole	NetEcho	from what ive seen ubuntu only supports up to 4gb
2008-11-30T21:57:00.000Z	Konsole	NetEcho	but then again i could be wrong
