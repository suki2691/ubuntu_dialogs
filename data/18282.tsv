2011-02-10T10:30:00.000Z	Abinadai		can someone tell me if there are ubuntiu drivers for an HP dv7-4177nr notebook that will give me the richness of sound quality that I get in windows 7? I'm already using pulseaudio and I'm not feelin' the love.

2011-02-10T10:31:00.000Z	ariaxu	Abinadai	Pulse talks to ALSA
2011-02-10T10:33:00.000Z	Abinadai	ariaxu	ok.  I get that now that I'm looking.
