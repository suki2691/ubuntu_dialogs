2010-07-21T01:14:00.000Z	shoofle		I turned on compiz fusion a while back, and now I would like to return to metacity. How do I change the default window manager for ubuntu 10.04?
2010-07-21T01:16:00.000Z	soreau	shoofle	sys>prefs>appearance>visual effects <-- set to None would be metacity
2010-07-21T01:16:00.000Z	shoofle	soreau	I've done that, but it still starts up with compiz running.
2010-07-21T01:18:00.000Z	soreau	shoofle	Start metacity then close all other windows and go to sys>prefs>startup applications>options and click Remember currently running programs
