2006-09-03T11:47:00.000Z	snoops		hey.. I was running some items in terminal - like 4 big things which have been working for ages..then I open another terminal and get a message saying terminal has crashed.. and to restart. If I hit restart(for terminal) it'll kill those processes which are still running in the background, right?
2006-09-03T11:48:00.000Z	whaley	snoops	yes, it will kill them
2006-09-03T11:48:00.000Z	whaley		they are child processes of the terminal
2006-09-03T11:48:00.000Z	snoops	whaley	okay.. is there some way of restarting terminal without killing them?
