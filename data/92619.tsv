2008-04-30T14:19:00.000Z	jaredbuck	anix	k3b can burn CDs/DVDs that boot, the files on the disc themselves will tell your computer that they can be booted from the disc when it starts up.

2008-04-30T14:22:00.000Z	jaredbuck	anix	k3b comes standard if you installed kubuntu or kde. if you didn't install it right away you can install it using a package manager or in GNOME, the add/remove applications selection.
