2008-02-04T17:33:00.000Z	nives1		hi, im installing ubuntu on an intel notebook , when i boot from live CD it uses intel experimental driver (and 3d effects work) but after install it says only VESA generic, and whatever i change it changes it back
2008-02-04T17:33:00.000Z	nives1		note: i installed with safe-vga because of another issue during install
2008-02-04T17:33:00.000Z	nives1		any solutions for this pls?
