2007-03-03T11:54:00.000Z	ffxr		can someone tell me what these modules are, ive been trying to fix my audio, no i want to identify any unnessary modules in my modules file : lp  rtc sbp2
2007-03-03T11:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ffxr	 lp = line printer, rtc = real time clock, (i think) spb2 = not sure.. :)
2007-03-04T10:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ffxr	 you mean a source code ./configure stuff?
2007-03-04T10:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ffxr	 thers some build deb command that can make one from source code.. but its not very reliable
