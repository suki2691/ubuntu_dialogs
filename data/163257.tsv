2006-10-22T16:56:00.000Z	Yourname	watson540	Thank you. If the main ubuntu dude saw you saying that, I'm sure he'd whip you. :)
2006-10-22T16:59:00.000Z	Yourname	watson540	Sure. But, if Google records the queries I must've given it to tell me how to upgrade a .tgz or install one, or get WPA to work with my drivers.. then Google would know me by first name.
