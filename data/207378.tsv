2005-12-01T08:33:00.000Z	theacolyte		I just installed 5.10 on a new machine, and it boots fine up til it gets to the graphical login, where if I press the session button it crashes (hard locks, can't switch screens,etc) and when I log on sucessfully it just sits there with the brown background indefinately, I can still use the mouse. I can't force GDM to quit.
