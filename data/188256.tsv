2006-08-24T05:22:00.000Z	bbrazil	justin_	if you run aptitude, it'll give you a list of manually installed and obselete debs
2006-08-24T05:24:00.000Z	justin_	wweasel	Yes I know how Synaptic works, I am talking about Debs I manually installed that were not in synaptic, bbrazil - Thnks, i'll give it a shot
