2007-05-09T16:36:00.000Z	wunky		hey eveyone :) I'm new to ubuntu, but I'm thinking is the x86 better than x86-64 for software support ? :)
2007-05-09T05:03:00.000Z	wunky		isn't ssh package included in x86-64 ?
2007-05-09T05:03:00.000Z	wunky		seems like "apt-get install openssh" doesn't work for me
2007-05-09T05:03:00.000Z	dyrne	wunky	apt-cache search openssh
