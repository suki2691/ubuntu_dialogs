2006-03-07T14:16:00.000Z	sinaduel		I have a small newbie question, but my friend told me you could be a server with linux, how do I go about doing this? And since I am worried about certain foreseeable problems, does linux alreay have a firewall?

2006-03-07T14:17:00.000Z	Spec	sinaduel	what type of server?
2006-03-07T14:17:00.000Z	Spec	sinaduel	firewall = iptables
