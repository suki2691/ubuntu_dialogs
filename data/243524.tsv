2005-04-30T14:50:00.000Z	zoldar		is there something like searchable repository via www ? i mean something like on debian.org - you can look for particular files, not only packages... ?
2005-04-30T14:50:00.000Z	zoldar		ok thanks
2005-04-30T14:50:00.000Z	dockane	zoldar	sudo apt-cache search does it maybe
