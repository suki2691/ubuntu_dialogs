2005-07-15T05:32:00.000Z	dryad		Hey - I'm really looking forward to install Ubuntu linux 5.04 on my amd64 machine, however, one thing is holding me back from installing it. I've got a 200gb ntfs-formatted drive, which I will need access to from Ubuntu. Is it possible to convert this partition to Fat32?

2005-07-15T05:34:00.000Z	Moppin	dryad	I have a 500-GB FAT32 that runs just fine.
