2009-05-28T07:36:00.000Z	lakotajames		Will someone help me figure out how to connect to my computer with my ds (running linux) using ssh?  I have openssh-server installed, and ssh seems to be installed on the ds.

2009-05-28T07:38:00.000Z	lakotajames	urban_ryoga	Oh.  well, I assumed ssh was pretty much the same on everything.  And I don't know how it works.  And the Ubuntu community is much bigger than a nds homebrew community
