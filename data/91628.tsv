2010-04-30T14:05:00.000Z	joaopinto	jbu	no schedule will work if there is none one involded on testing, it works for me because I made sure it would work during these 6 months
2010-04-30T14:06:00.000Z	jbu	joaopinto	yes, but to be a OS that competes with windows and mac's os, if they don't have the testers they shouldn't stick to a half year schedule
2010-04-30T14:06:00.000Z	joaopinto	jbu	why not ? it works great for those who care about it
