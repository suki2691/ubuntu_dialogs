2007-08-09T07:22:00.000Z	macogw	|Carrera	bad cpu frequency scaling?
2007-08-09T07:24:00.000Z	|Carrera	macogw	How do I find out if that is the problem?
2007-08-09T07:25:00.000Z	macogw	|Carrera	i dont know. if thats the problem, its a bug and there are workarounds like telling it not to use over a certain frequency, for instance, 1.2ghz
