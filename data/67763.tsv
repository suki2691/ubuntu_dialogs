2009-01-25T10:28:00.000Z	monjaro		Hey.  I'm trying to set rc as my default shell, but when I do chsh and then choose rc, it says it's an invalid shell.  Why would this be?
2009-01-25T10:29:00.000Z	n8tuser	monjaro	rc is a shell?
2009-01-25T10:30:00.000Z	n8tuser	monjaro	this is ubuntu, plan 9 ?
2009-01-25T10:31:00.000Z	monjaro	n8tuser	I'm using plan 9 from user space (a port of plan 9 programs)
