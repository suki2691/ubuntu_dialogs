2010-07-13T23:54:00.000Z	Godfather8850		does anyone know if the VGA out of the computer works on VirtualBox? I have a problem with my VGA out in Ubuntu and I was thinking to give it a try through VirtualBox

2010-07-13T23:57:00.000Z	Godfather8850	luanlmd	so you think I should install the ATI drivers on the virtual box and then connect it with the VGA out inside Ubuntu? will this work?
