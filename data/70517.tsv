2008-12-27T04:15:00.000Z	Watcht	onetinsoldier	i dunno i mean i have some of the regular repos like community and multiverse and nothing is showing up I'd think that would still show up without gpg keys
2008-12-27T04:16:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Watcht	yeah, i don't know, keep asking. i would be interested in seeing if anyone knows what's up there. have you taken a checked out your /etc/apt/sources.list file and made sure it looks ok?
