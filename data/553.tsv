2012-10-30T15:49:00.000Z	chatman	gusta778	why do you want nested terminals?
2012-10-30T15:50:00.000Z	gusta778	chatman	:sh in vim for instance. Then I can't remember if this or that terminal is running vim or not accidentally killing off terminals sometimes.
2012-10-30T15:52:00.000Z	chatman	gusta778	surely you'd only use :sh in vim on certain occasions, you can't remember when you do that?
2012-10-30T15:52:00.000Z	gusta778	chatman	Regularly, actually. And no. I might have many, too. Please try helping me instead.
