2007-10-20T08:22:00.000Z	jrgp		I just upgraded to gutsy. My sound is all sticky now. What can I do?
2007-10-20T08:23:00.000Z	trogdor	jrgp	lick it? lol I'd just download the gutsy cd and install then move my files over from back up
2007-10-20T08:23:00.000Z	trogdor	jrgp	well if this has been an ongoing problem and not a bug
2007-10-20T08:24:00.000Z	trogdor	jrgp	perhaps try changing some alsa options or the frequence its running at
