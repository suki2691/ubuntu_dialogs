2009-09-09T18:45:00.000Z	rabidweezle	suigeneris	basically, you will notice it won't work
2009-09-09T18:46:00.000Z	rabidweezle	suigeneris	for the record though, ubuntu recognizes about 90% of all hardware I have thrown at it
2009-09-09T18:47:00.000Z	suigeneris	rabidweezle	thanks. a colleague asked that though
