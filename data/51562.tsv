2012-01-30T07:43:00.000Z	jfeole	dsnyders	- your machine can't connect with the remote host..
2012-01-30T07:44:00.000Z	jfeole		try using the remote machine IP Address if you have it..
2012-01-30T07:45:00.000Z	dsnyders	jfeole	remote host is a linksys router, ip 192.168.7.1 and my eth0 is 192.168.7.42.  link lights are on.
