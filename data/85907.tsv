2008-11-01T05:32:00.000Z	dmsuperman		I'm having an issue with video. I installed intrepid, then I installed nvidia-glx-177. My Xorg.0.log says "Fatal error, no screens found"
2008-11-01T05:32:00.000Z	dmsuperman		But I have tried both default xorg.conf and nvidia-xconfig one, both have a screen defined
2008-11-01T05:33:00.000Z	chad1	dmsuperman	there is serious issues with nvidia and 8.10 whether they are admitting it or not, there are a lot of problems
2008-11-01T05:33:00.000Z	dmsuperman	chad1	There have always been issues with nvidia, but I'm using older cards. That usually works better, but here it's not at all -_-
