2011-02-24T01:29:00.000Z	anthony_	drc	bullgard, ThinkT510 thanks very much for your help.  will look at xubuntu instead.  I want to grab files off it initially then look at doing a minimal install when backed up.  in your experience how does hardware support differ between ubuntu and xubuntu?  is there much of a difference?

2011-02-24T01:33:00.000Z	anthony_	drc	ThinkT510, bullgard that's what I wanted to hear.  thanks for the help. need to stop the woman using my T60 and treating the USB ports like crap - girlfriends eh! if you do php I'm on #yii most days.  take it easy
