2008-05-20T16:41:00.000Z	chris_	CapeTown-HardyHe	you have more info? maybe url?
2008-05-20T16:43:00.000Z	CapeTown-HardyHe	chris_	: Not sure what more info you need. I installed ov511 drivers via Synaptic but Skype only show /dev/video0 once and I don't get any info from "modprobe ov511" command... :-(
