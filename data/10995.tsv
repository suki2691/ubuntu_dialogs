2012-01-06T07:00:00.000Z	codyc1515		Is there any particular reason that the apt-get packages are a bit older than the versions that are downloadable?
2012-01-06T07:00:00.000Z	urlin2u	codyc1515	as in what packages?
2012-01-06T07:02:00.000Z	urlin2u	codyc1515	not sure with those but ubuntu like many OS's os the tweaked versions of many packages.,
2012-01-06T07:02:00.000Z	urlin2u	codyc1515	I use straight downloads of some like a daily FF, bleachbit and others so many run fine.
