2011-06-26T09:26:00.000Z	parolang		Okay, sort of a newbie question, though I'm not really a newb.  But I plug my USB drive (2TB hard drive) in, how do I find it?  I can't find it in /dev/disk/ and dmesg doesn't really tell me where it is (it says "usb 2-2: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 3") but I don't know how to interpret address 3 to get a mount point.  Any ideas?

2011-06-26T09:28:00.000Z	ChaosSaber	parolang	oh ok
