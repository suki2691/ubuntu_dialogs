2006-11-13T06:59:00.000Z	Tarvok		Hello. Can anyone tell me if there's a way to install programs on an Ubuntu machine that currently has no internet connection, in a manner that will enable it to find updates normally when I finally get the internet working?
2006-11-13T07:00:00.000Z	Tarvok		I'd like to download files on this machine and write to CDR.

2006-11-13T07:03:00.000Z	Pelo	Tarvok	 if you have the dvd it's on it,  if you have the whole cd set it's on one of them but I don'T know which
