2008-09-22T05:07:00.000Z	koshari		i had that error the other day on a acer one using a 8.04 disc but an 8.04.1 worked
2008-09-22T05:09:00.000Z	koshari		abbot its the latest downlaodable iso, you may have it if you had downlaoded recently, the 8.04 was the first release of LTs
2008-09-22T05:09:00.000Z	abbot	koshari	in that case, i've already tried it.
