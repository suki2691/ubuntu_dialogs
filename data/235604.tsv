2008-10-31T08:57:00.000Z	billybigrigger		or why xchat isnt even installed on a default ibex install
2008-10-31T08:58:00.000Z	Madpilot	billybigrigger	xchat is in Universe
2008-10-31T08:58:00.000Z	Madpilot	billybigrigger	but xchat hasn't been installed by default for a couple years - just Pidgin, which bites as an IRC client
