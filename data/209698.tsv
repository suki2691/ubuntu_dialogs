2007-09-21T11:04:00.000Z	Downix		Hmm, I have a thought.  Is there any way I can keep the graphical login but allow each of my users to have a different WM?
2007-09-21T11:05:00.000Z	Downix		my son is used to GNOME, but I prefer KDE, for example

2007-09-21T11:06:00.000Z	LjL	Downix	i mean simply the login screen. the "Options" button there allows one to choose GNOME, KDE or whatever you have installed
