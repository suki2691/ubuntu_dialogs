I've tried 'umount' and 'eject' but the green light on the USB is still on... somehow ubuntu has the option to 'safely remove' on it's gui and it turns the light off, is there any way to do it on Gentoo's command line?

2010-08-07T21:58:00.000Z	icmp_request	ikonia	but is there a way to interrupt the power from the port like windows and ubuntu do? | maco: nope, it keeps always on =/
2010-08-07T21:58:00.000Z	ikonia	icmp_request	I wouldn't worry about power
