2007-03-28T15:15:00.000Z	ChrisTek		I must be doing something totally STUPID, but I'm getting errors when trying to run "make" on ndiswrapper-1.39
2007-03-28T15:16:00.000Z	ChrisTek		Ubuntu doesn't come with make...?
2007-03-28T15:16:00.000Z	Flannel	ChrisTek	No.  But it's easy to install.
2007-03-28T15:18:00.000Z	Flannel	ChrisTek	it's in the repositories, 'build-essential'.  It's also on the CD (both desktop an alternate) if you need it to connect to the interblags
