2006-10-22T05:06:00.000Z	johso	Vaske_Car	Thanks, that software looks really useful (wish I'd know it before), but I can access my data fine. problem is that I can't write. tried it before, and moved everything to another computer, wiped the disk and moved everything back. but I was wondering if this was doable without moving everything, just fixing it.
