My understanding was that a lookup was done against /etc/hosts, and then if not available, did a DNS lookup using /etc/resolv.conf - but that doesn't appear to be so
2011-03-21T20:21:00.000Z	sipior	mweichert	no, have a look at /etc/nsswitch.conf.
2011-03-21T20:21:00.000Z	mweichert	sipior	hosts: files dns - wouldn't that mean, /etc/hosts, and then nslookup via /etc/resolv.conf?
2011-03-21T20:22:00.000Z	sipior	mweichert	yes, but i didn't appreciate that you were talking about dig specifically. Pumpkin- is quite correct in saying that it will ignore /etc/hosts.
