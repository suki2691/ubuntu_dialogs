2008-11-10T19:28:00.000Z	khaotik		i just installed intrepid and my wlan0 is not enabled. my wireless is working but its labeled eth1 and my ethernet is eth0. how can i get it working on wlan0??
2008-11-10T19:29:00.000Z	khaotik		is there a way i can get my wireless working as it used to be on 8.04??

2008-11-10T19:31:00.000Z	seronis	khaotik	if i boot my laptop up with the livecd it also shows its wireless as  eth1 too,  so its not an 'upgrade' issue
