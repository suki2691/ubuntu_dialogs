2011-05-22T02:44:00.000Z	antaranian		Guys, I owned a vps server with Ubuntu, and connected with root (only available) account via ssh
2011-05-22T02:44:00.000Z	antaranian		then I accidentally used "sudo passwd -l root" so disabled root, and now I can't login via ssh, what will I do ?

2011-05-22T02:44:00.000Z	Flannel	antaranian	and next time, create a new user with admin rights before disabling root :)
