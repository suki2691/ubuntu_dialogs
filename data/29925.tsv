2010-06-25T05:42:00.000Z	jteknet	kesroesweyth	gparted does, in fact, see it. The problem is the installer isn't seeing it to auto-partition it for the swap space and all that jazz that I don't know how to do, nor do I know what size to make it.
2010-06-25T05:43:00.000Z	kesroesweyth	jteknet	> so do it manually. decide on a partition size for both your root ( / ) and home partitions, and then make the swap size double or even triple your total amount of RAM - ubuntu is great with memory management so you should be fine with double your RAM's worth of swap space
2010-06-25T05:51:00.000Z	jteknet	kesroesweyth	Heh, did some googling. Turns out the problem was with dmraid. I found a forum post and it said to run apt-get remove dmraid. It fixed the problem. Install now sees my drive!
