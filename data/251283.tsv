2007-12-10T14:45:00.000Z	Richard51684		My volume is very low... When I set it to 50% it's unhearable and when it's on 100% it feels like it's actually at 25% volume. What's causing this and/or how can I fix it? I know the volumes aren't correct because I used to be on Windows.

2007-12-10T14:47:00.000Z	VSpike	Richard51684	run it from a terminal
2007-12-10T14:48:00.000Z	VSpike	Richard51684	just turn everything to max, and try toggling some of the options too, especially if you have anything like "external amplifier" or similar
