2010-02-04T03:43:00.000Z	unixalot		In startup applications for the command i have to call the script i made is , /usr/local/bin/awn
2010-02-04T03:43:00.000Z	unixalot		and its already executable
2010-02-04T03:45:00.000Z	trism	unixalot	unfortunately, startup applications doesn't seem to like to run anything that isn't an x application...so what I generally do is use an xterm to execute the script (you won't see the xterm if the script is quick), something like: xterm -e /path/to/script;
