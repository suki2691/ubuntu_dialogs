2006-07-14T15:43:00.000Z	skavenge	blanky	yes, iptables, install firestarter for a gui frontend
2006-07-14T15:44:00.000Z	skavenge	blanky	yes, iptables is the firewall, and you need to configure it with firestarter, as stated
2006-07-14T15:45:00.000Z	skavenge	blanky	it blocks all incoming by default hence your issue
