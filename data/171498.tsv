2006-08-10T08:36:00.000Z	wirelain		Hm, anyone have a link to a good overall hardware burn-in tester? (ubuntu is randomly locking up, but i'm pretty sure it's not ubuntu's fault, same symptims described for windows 98 too)

2006-08-10T08:38:00.000Z	wirelain	EriK_	i'm pretty sure it's not the ram, that was not part of the original system that was known to be issues, and i ran a cursory memtest alredy from my first failing install cd.
