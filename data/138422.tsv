2007-05-16T07:47:00.000Z	fluid		ive tried to figure this out over and over again. i have an nforce4 motherboard, feisty, and i really want to be able to use sound from several apps at once. ive followed a guide for setting up dmix, doesnt seem to have worked ... if i start playing mp3s with anything, then run say, ut2004/tremulous/anything, i get no sound in ut2004.
2007-05-16T07:48:00.000Z	magnetron	fluid	you need the aoss package
2007-05-16T07:49:00.000Z	magnetron	fluid	then run the software like this: aoss ut2004
2007-05-16T07:49:00.000Z	magnetron	fluid	start ALL the programs with aoss
