2011-04-28T22:50:00.000Z	chadi		if my current maverick version is 32-bit, and I'm installing 64-bit natty, will it read my /home? (I have a separate /home partition)

2011-04-28T22:51:00.000Z	chadi	HyperShock	gaara: sure I will, but is there a 32-bit / 64-bit move problem?
2011-04-28T22:52:00.000Z	HyperShock	chadi	i would say only if you have 32bit custom programs residing in it, you may need to recompile them
