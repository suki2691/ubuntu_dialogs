2006-08-17T16:09:00.000Z	PRab		I have a laptop with a turion X2 processor, I woul like to install the 64bit edition, but am worried about driver issuse. Do you think I should use the 32bit version instead?
2006-08-17T16:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	PRab	the problem is not the drivers but userspace apps flash, w32codecs etc will not work
2006-08-17T16:21:00.000Z	PRab	erUSUL	what are "userspace apps flash"?
2006-08-17T16:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	PRab	userspace apps like flash, and the ones using w32codecs will not work on 64bits ubuntu
