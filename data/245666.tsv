2006-11-07T16:14:00.000Z	walnut		hi there, I'm writing to ask help about a problem I got with my bittorrent client. I can only use one session per time!!!
2006-11-07T16:14:00.000Z	cwillu	walnut	are you behind a router/firewall?
2006-11-07T16:16:00.000Z	cwillu	walnut	so you have a port forwarded for bittorrent already?
2006-11-07T16:16:00.000Z	cwillu	walnut	you did it yourself I mean?
