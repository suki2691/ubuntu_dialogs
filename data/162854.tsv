2012-02-11T18:37:00.000Z	Luigi		when installing ubuntu with wubi and i choose my external hard drive (wich has already some files and folders on it) the hard drive won't get overwritten,will it?
2012-02-11T18:38:00.000Z	holstein	Luigi	it shouldnt... though i wouldnt do it that way, or suggest using wubi.. or installing an OS without backing up whats already there
2012-02-11T18:40:00.000Z	holstein	Luigi	you get a bigger "fake" hard drive
2012-02-11T18:42:00.000Z	holstein	Luigi	the best would be *not* using wubi... if you are asking if 30gb's is enough.. that depends, but it should be a good start
