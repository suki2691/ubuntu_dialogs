2009-03-24T00:26:00.000Z	Guest79817		Help!!!  Saturday my 8.10 started randomly capitalizing the first character of things I typed, including in command lines (OUCH) and search boxes (Annoying)  Has anyone heard why?

2009-03-24T00:28:00.000Z	Joker_-_	Guest79817	Just giving wild guesses: any new corrector application? Any "filter" that might change/format what you type?
2009-03-24T00:30:00.000Z	Joker_-_	Guest79817	it does that in console aswell, out of X? or in terminal inside X only??
