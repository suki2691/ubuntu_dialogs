2010-12-15T15:51:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	twitch	can you pastebin it for me? i'm having all kinds of issues eventually resulting in my conf file disappearing :(
2010-12-15T15:53:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	twitch	i uninstalled nvidia-common, rebooted, reinstalled/activate, rebooted, ran /usr/lib/nvidia-common/bin/nvidia-xconfig, rebooted, ubuntu failed ot pass ubuntu logo, deleted conf file and now i'm back to default nvidia drivers instead of proprietry
2010-12-15T15:53:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	twitch	so now i'm looking for the xorg.conf that you get when you first install nvidia proprietry - i'll copy it in there and hopefully it'll work
