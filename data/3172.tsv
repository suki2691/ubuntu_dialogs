2012-05-08T21:57:00.000Z	craigbass1976	DeltaHeavy	Mine borked, but you might have better luck.  I had some extra repos that might have screwed it up
2012-05-08T21:58:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	craigbass1976	THanks, I might not upgrade then. It's a work PC and I don't have time to deal with a fresh sintall
2012-05-08T21:59:00.000Z	craigbass1976	DeltaHeavy	Nor did I, but dummy me had to do it anyway.  Three days, in between customers, to get it back up to snuff.
