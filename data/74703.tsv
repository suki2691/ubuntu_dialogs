2010-05-18T19:32:00.000Z	Roasted		Is there a way to suck up all folders/permissions and re-deploy them to a new server? I know Linux tends to associate owner ID's with names... aka Jason might be user 1001, Fred might be 1002, etc. I have NO clue how I could possibly re-add all users on the new server and get them dead-on to match the permissions. Is there any way I can save those accordingly and transfer them w/o a headache?
