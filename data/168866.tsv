2006-09-08T12:02:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		got an issue: usually when I close my laptop lid, I re-open it, and get my screensaver lock. yay. sometimes (now) I'll open it, and the screen decides not to even turn on. I'll switch VT's, to no avail. it seems like it's running fine, beneath that black screen...
