2008-04-24T08:20:00.000Z	milly1234		I am running Ubuntu 7.10 and just installed a TV Tuner card and now my Webcam stopped working, it doesn't even show it under the multimedia systems selector in the video part, though it does show its usb mic, it also shows up when I enter "lsusb" in a terminal but nothing else shows it or can use it, anyone have a clue what might be causing this?
