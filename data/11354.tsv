2012-01-18T03:26:00.000Z	JohnTeddy		My cell phone is named weird in /media, I can't even cd into it.. I have to use mautilus..
2012-01-18T03:26:00.000Z	JohnTeddy		How can I rename the device, so /media/xyz is different?
2012-01-18T03:27:00.000Z	auronandace	JohnTeddy	can't you tabcomplete the device name?
2012-01-18T03:30:00.000Z	JohnTeddy	auronandace	no, because cdrom exists
