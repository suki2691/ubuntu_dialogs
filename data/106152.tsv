2008-03-13T00:15:00.000Z	jvm		hi. i had strange emask problems and read that my sata disk could be dying. i bought a new one and replaced the old, copied all data and had two weeks without problems. now i get the same error messages. even my bios/bootloader behaves unusual sometimes (no vga signal, slow reaction); so it can't be a hard drive or software problem. i searched some more and found people insisting that this could be caused by sata cable/power supply/chipset/damaged
2008-03-13T00:15:00.000Z	jvm		sata controler problems. how do i find out?
