2010-01-23T05:12:00.000Z	gui7		if i install windows 7 and then ubuntu, will grub allow me to boot straight into win7 or will i have to  then re-choose windows 7 in 7's own bootloader?

2010-01-23T05:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gui7	one will automatically load by default, and that one is Ubuntu
2010-01-23T05:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gui7	should do yes
