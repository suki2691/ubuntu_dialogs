2006-06-21T06:45:00.000Z	vanberge		i get the following error from totem:  Video codec 'XviD' is not handled. You might need to install additional plugins to be able to play some types of movies
2006-06-21T06:45:00.000Z	samsonasu	vanberge	i use www.videolan.org to play videos and it handles all the popular codecs
