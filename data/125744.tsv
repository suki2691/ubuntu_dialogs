2007-08-06T10:54:00.000Z	Julius1		Hello, I have an USB Sitecom WL-168. I installed it with ndiswrapper but It scans only 2 essid. There's about 10 around here
2007-08-06T10:54:00.000Z	Julius1		Do you have an idea ? :/
2007-08-06T10:54:00.000Z	DWSR	Julius1	Do you get the ESSID that you're looking for?
2007-08-06T10:55:00.000Z	Julius1	DWSR	no :/
