2008-12-19T06:20:00.000Z	dereks		i have a dumb question. i checked the man pages and can't find the answer. I am trying to gunzip a file to a different directory (space issues). how do i do this?
2008-12-19T06:21:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dereks	probably quotes around the path
2008-12-19T06:21:00.000Z	dereks	IndyGunFreak	eh? i want it to be in a different path than the gz.... so where do i put the new path?
2008-12-19T06:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	dereks	oh, misunderstood.. sorry, i dunno
