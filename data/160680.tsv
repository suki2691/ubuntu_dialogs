2008-09-06T07:22:00.000Z	Aquahallic		If I'm logged in as my normal user on my laptop and I open nautilus and type ssh://servername I'm prompted for a password.... if I use my root acct on that target box to login with it lets me in fine.. but for every file that I open after that it prompts me again.... even if I use the "Remember Forever" bullet... is there a way to have it remember that user I'm logging in with?
