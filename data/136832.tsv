2008-05-17T23:28:00.000Z	chocobanana		Hi there everyone. I have a problem in making the @ sign on a portuguese keyboard. It is supposed to work by pressing Alt Gr+2 (right Alt + 2), but when I press the right Alt key it will only turn on the num and caps locks and sometimes act like I'm pressing the F1 key, thus opening the Help. Does anyone have a clue on how to fix this?
