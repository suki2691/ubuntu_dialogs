2009-11-16T03:04:00.000Z	jzacsh		may someone please point me to how I can properly ssh  into my box (without using a password - as i currently do) - I'm told the better way is to keep a single copy of a "key" on hand and the same one on my box. i just don't know where to start reading up on that. is that what "pgp" keys are??

2009-11-16T03:05:00.000Z	jzacsh		i know that ssh is a way for me to connect (like a replacement for telnet) - but i mean, a way to use a key, instead of a password
