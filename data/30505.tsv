2010-06-08T22:51:00.000Z	acicula	ulkn	the system will tell you it is a bad idea when you try to set it
2010-06-08T22:58:00.000Z	ulkn	acicula	if you don't run a badly configured sshd, weak passwords shouldn't be a problem, except it gives worms a local root access, which they have anyway....
2010-06-08T23:00:00.000Z	acicula	ulkn	weak passwords are always a problem, you cant fix ssh to not allow users with a simple password
