2005-11-04T13:08:00.000Z	jeremy913226	jenda	I *definitely* need help
2005-11-04T13:10:00.000Z	jenda	jeremy913226	scrolling upwards, I'd reckon a repository problem, no?
2005-11-04T13:11:00.000Z	jeremy913226	jenda	possibly. I'm not able to install anything from apt-get, unless i supply an explicit url for the source
