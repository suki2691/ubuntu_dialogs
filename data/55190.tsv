2011-01-10T09:11:00.000Z	Samison		Hi  I lost my NetworkManager panel applet when I rebooted after installing pppoeconf, and I can't even find an applet package in Synaptic.  Anyone know how I can resote it?

2011-01-10T09:16:00.000Z	edbian	Samison	sudo apt-get install nm-applet
2011-01-10T09:16:00.000Z	edbian	Samison	Then re add those things to the panel, or restart
