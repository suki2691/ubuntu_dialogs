2011-03-26T21:08:00.000Z	zxiest[a]		If I installed something to a user, how can I get it moved to root? (and all other users)
2011-03-26T21:10:00.000Z	giff	zxiest[a]	move manually from home to /opt or add the PATH?
2011-03-26T21:10:00.000Z	zxiest[a]	giff	doesn't matter.. whichever works
2011-03-26T21:11:00.000Z	giff	zxiest[a]	both works :P
