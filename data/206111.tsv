2005-11-27T14:29:00.000Z	coz		has anyone here ever used any of the defrag utilities for linux?
2005-11-27T14:30:00.000Z	SpaceCake	coz	why do you need it ? by default defragmentaTION level on an linux filesistem is below 3%
2005-11-27T14:30:00.000Z	coz	SpaceCake	true for normal use but if there are many things accessing the file system at the same time fragmentation happens
