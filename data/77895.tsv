2009-04-07T13:26:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		ok, when playing flash videos online, I'm getting video only...no audio...today is the first day I noticed this problem....
2009-04-07T13:26:00.000Z	ziroday`	Geoffrey2	what version of ubuntu?
2009-04-07T13:27:00.000Z	ziroday`	Geoffrey2	hmm, it shouldn't do that. Does pulseaudio -k make sound reappear? Or does logging off and logging back in or restarting help?
2009-04-07T13:29:00.000Z	ziroday`	Geoffrey2	thats fine, does audio play on flash videos?
