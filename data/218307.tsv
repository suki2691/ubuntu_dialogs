2007-01-17T07:43:00.000Z	bruenig		by the way I have no idea if that is what it is
2007-01-17T07:43:00.000Z	bruenig		but it looks similar enough
2007-01-17T07:44:00.000Z	malex	bruenig	Too bad there is a dependency in the base system on slang1a-utf8, not on libslang1-utf8. This is the first time I see debootstrap unable to create a base system from the "main" archive. Really weird.
