2011-12-08T07:53:00.000Z	superlou	Mitchell_	depending on what you're looking to do with it, might find the answer here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile
2011-12-08T07:54:00.000Z	Mitchell_	superlou	i dont need to compile it, i just need it to compile a driver
2011-12-08T07:54:00.000Z	superlou	Mitchell_	i believe that page links to the git repo with the source
