2008-02-21T20:38:00.000Z	bazhang	nDuff	that would be better discussed in #ubuntu+1 ;]
2008-02-21T20:38:00.000Z	nDuff		...there are some tickets basically marking the big picture (dmraid+lvm2) WONTFIX for a few releases -- but if I provide some patches to make it work, would they likely be accepted?
