2008-01-04T09:36:00.000Z	ottothecow		are there boot options for ubuntu-server that force it to configure a static ip?
2008-01-04T09:36:00.000Z	th0r	ottothecow	atr startup it will configure each interface as it is defined in /etc/network/interfaces
2008-01-04T09:37:00.000Z	ottothecow	th0r	I'd like to configure the interface manually during the install (the server install currently pulls a dhcp lease)
2008-01-04T09:38:00.000Z	th0r	ottothecow	ah....don't know about that...never tried it.
