2006-11-09T09:15:00.000Z	agent	bjornolai	when you log in there is an option to change language (if you have it installed)
2006-11-09T09:16:00.000Z	agent	bjornolai	if you need to install a language, go to system->administration->language support (thats in english - you will need to transalte into the current language)
2006-11-09T09:16:00.000Z	agent	bjornolai	when you type in your username/password... there is an options button on the bottom
