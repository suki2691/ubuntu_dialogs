2012-10-22T23:58:00.000Z	Nono923	designbybeck	thanks, that's exactly my problem!
2012-10-23T00:08:00.000Z	Nono923	designbybeck	It worked! Thanks for pointing me to it. Although the boot screen is uuugly now (text and wrong resolution), and I see an nvidia splashscreen now, but that's an acceptable trade for the other things.
