2006-07-15T13:48:00.000Z	aldudturn		Does anyone know if it is possible to fit a PC Card, in a desktop PC rather than a laptop without an adapter? I have no other ethernet card available to connect to the internet :-(

2006-07-15T13:49:00.000Z	aldudturn	penguin42	there is no way whatsoever?
2006-07-15T13:49:00.000Z	penguin42	aldudturn	It physically won't fit
