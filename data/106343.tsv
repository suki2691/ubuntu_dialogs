2008-11-13T09:13:00.000Z	freddy_engels		I'm trying to connect to an openWRT device via ssh, but after I login it immediately kicks me out. Is this likely a problem with the openWRT device or is there something clever I can do with ssh?
2008-11-13T09:14:00.000Z	freddy_engels		The command I am using is just "sudo ssh root@openWRT"
