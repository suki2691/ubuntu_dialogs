2012-05-18T04:33:00.000Z	Kaigh		Hello, I was wondering if I could receive some help
2012-05-18T04:35:00.000Z	Kaigh		I'm trying to install ubuntu alongside Windows 7. I've created a partition of 35 gb to install ubuntu on, but am lost on how to install ubuntu on this partition.
2012-05-18T04:37:00.000Z	Kaigh		It is unallocated, nothing's on it. The unallocated partition doesn't show up when I try to install
2012-05-18T04:38:00.000Z	psusi	Kaigh	a partition that has no files in it is not the same as unpartitioned space... delete the partition and when you install ubuntu, tell it to install using free space
