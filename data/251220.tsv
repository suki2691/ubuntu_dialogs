2007-03-02T16:09:00.000Z	TheVault		well, my gaim messenger just crashed and Iv always been told that programs in ubuntu never crash
2007-03-02T16:10:00.000Z	tony_	TheVault	programs in ubuntu crash... it's just they don't take the OS down with them LOL.  Although it is annoying when programs just disappear...
