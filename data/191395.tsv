2006-04-18T08:56:00.000Z	SanderD		hi. when installing the latest dapper flight, resizing ntfs partitions doesn't seem to work. could it help to defragmentat them?
2006-04-18T08:57:00.000Z	saskia	SanderD	maybe "parted" can help
2006-04-18T08:57:00.000Z	SanderD	saskia	is that on the installation cd? starzinger: the default tool you get when installing ubuntu
2006-04-18T08:58:00.000Z	saskia	SanderD	better to do the other suggestion instead (do it under windows)
