2005-03-25T13:43:00.000Z	lamont	BiteMeBill	but why not just run hoary?
2005-03-25T13:44:00.000Z	BiteMeBill	lamont	I was editing my source.list and renamed every warty to hoary and then came up with the error on the backports.
2005-03-25T13:45:00.000Z	lamont	BiteMeBill	which leads immediately to the question of how exactly one would backport something to a release that isn't even out yet....
