2012-08-31T08:37:00.000Z	lcc		hi. I'm getting an error when running alsamixer on xmonad launched from startx: cannot open mixer: No such file or directory. any ideas of how I can resolve this?
2012-08-31T08:38:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	lcc	maybe try and run it from terminal with -v and see if it gives you anything else?
2012-08-31T08:45:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	lcc	you are indeed correct. This is a bit of a copout, but what about reinstalling alsamixer?
2012-08-31T08:46:00.000Z	lcc	JokesOnYou77	no, it works on gnome.
