2006-12-07T10:20:00.000Z	bitflip	SilentDis	correct, an advantage of doing it that way ;)
2006-12-07T10:21:00.000Z	SilentDis	bitflip	 hmm... i'll be going from dapper to edgy though... should i be worried about prefs or the like 'hanging over' and causing problems?
2006-12-07T10:22:00.000Z	bitflip	SilentDis	I can't forsee any and all scenarios but it worked for me, I even have amd64 and 32bit systems I switch between without problem (with a bit more care than just a /home) but point is yes, you *should* be alright
