2010-07-15T08:00:00.000Z	electrofreak	porus	could vary... I'd probably leave at least 1 GB
2010-07-15T08:02:00.000Z	porus	electrofreak	thanks, I thought of getting source of vyatta and it includes linux-image. 800+MB is downloaded for linux-image and it is still going :)
2010-07-15T08:02:00.000Z	electrofreak	porus	yea, it can be pretty large. I don't know the exact size tho...
