2012-10-24T09:46:00.000Z	kunji		Hmm, I know it's kinda off topic, but would anyone know why the performance of https://launchpad.net/gl-cairo-simple  degrades very quickly as the window size is increased.  The default size has quite good performance, but when fullscreen it crawls and uses close to 100% CPU.  Also, is this typical for relatively simple constructions with Cairo, or do you think something else is at fault (the openGL or SDL compnents?)?  Or could this be a p

2012-10-24T09:48:00.000Z	kunji	Scott_S	yeah, I guessed that much, I guess I was just wondering why it drops off that badly, considering that the example is fairly simple, i.e. why does this get so bad while running SCII in Wine will still get 60 ish fps on my system
