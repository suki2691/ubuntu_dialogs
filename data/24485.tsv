2010-10-11T18:13:00.000Z	tbuehlmann		greetings! just installed 10.10 on a virtualbox vm and trying to install ruby 1.9.2 from source. last few ubuntus I used `$ sudo apt-get build-dep ruby1.9` for some deps, which now just gives an "E: Unable to find a source package for ruby1.9". so, what changes have been made regarding this and what do I do now?
