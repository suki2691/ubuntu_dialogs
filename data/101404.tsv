2008-02-13T03:21:00.000Z	Lettuc3	sourcemaker	maybe something to do with not purging vmware player? if i remember correctly, if the installer can't find an appropriate pre-compiled module for your distro/architecture, then it will try to compile one for you, but not otherwise.
2008-02-13T03:21:00.000Z	sourcemaker	Lettuc3	yes... I did not purge... only remove
2008-02-13T03:22:00.000Z	Lettuc3	sourcemaker	i can't say for sure that's the problem, but it's something to think of... i dont think you'd have to compile it manually though.
