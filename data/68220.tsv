2009-01-23T18:43:00.000Z	n4h0j		I have a Gigabyte GA-EX58-UD5 motherboard with the Realtek 8111D network. When I try to install 8.10 x64 it does not recognize my network at all. Just wont show. In 9.04 alpha x64 the network is working like a charm. Anyone who knows how I might use this knowledge to get 8.10 x64 working? I really don't have the tech-skills to run alpha...
2009-01-23T18:45:00.000Z	Jeruvy	n4h0j	lots of bugs with the realtek chipset, have you checked to see if this is a patch set to be backported?
2009-01-23T18:48:00.000Z	n4h0j	Jeruvy	simplexio, both your answers are a bit to high-tech for me, just trying this out straight from using Vista (trying to get rid of my gaming addiction). how would I use this kernel in 8.10? and is it possible to do without access to internet from this very computer?
2009-01-23T18:49:00.000Z	Jeruvy	n4h0j	well, checking for patches and backports are typical for fixing bugs.  See launchpad.net and search there, you may find what you seek.
