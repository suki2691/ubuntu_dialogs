2010-05-30T11:13:00.000Z	_Brun0_	mneptok	are you sure? I think modprove comes in kernel now.
2010-05-30T11:14:00.000Z	mneptok	_Brun0_	yes, you can use the pf config to turn off IPv6. "alias net-pf-10 off ipv6"
2010-05-30T11:19:00.000Z	_Brun0_	mneptok	i'm confused.. where is that pf config i should use to disable ipv6?
