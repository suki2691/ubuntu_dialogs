2012-04-26T14:23:00.000Z	ThePendulum		I am running Ubuntu 12.04 on a dualscreen set-up. I was wondering if it's possible to have the panel items (notifications, time, auth, etc.) only on one screen, rather than both
2012-04-26T14:23:00.000Z	Myrtti	ThePendulum	you're on the wrong channel for that
2012-07-26T16:16:00.000Z	ThePendulum	Myrtti	Oh, so now wanting to know my driver version is not a support discussion? :\
