2009-01-19T15:46:00.000Z	Pyru		new ubuntu user here, how would I tell if my ati card is installed?
2009-01-19T15:46:00.000Z	Slart	Pyru	glxgears -info.. look at the top of the output
2009-01-19T15:48:00.000Z	Pyru	Slart	tells me a list of stuff. GL_renderer = Mesa... bla bla
2009-01-19T15:50:00.000Z	Slart	Pyru	Mesa is a software renderer afaik so I think your ati drivers are not installed
