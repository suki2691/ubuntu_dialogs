2006-07-21T05:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		Guys I need to vent a little.  This is the second time in a row where tha update has overwritten my grub.lst..  Is it too much to ask that you warn a user or make a bacjup of something so basic as a persons bootloader?

2006-07-21T05:15:00.000Z	ernstp	Jack_Sparrow	it has certain rules however
2006-07-21T05:15:00.000Z	ernstp	Jack_Sparrow	man update-grub       and look at the commented config options in the file
