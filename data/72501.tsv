2010-01-14T19:56:00.000Z	dane		Sorry for the repeat. I think my first question got drowned :( Does anyone know of a fix for VisualBoy Advance? It used to work just fine in Jaunty, but when I upgraded to karmic, it started freezing every 15 minutes of use (ish).
2010-01-14T19:57:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	dane	hi. do you know if visualboy got upgraded during the dist-upgrade to karmic?
2010-01-14T19:59:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	dane	so, you installed karmic totally fresh and clean? hmmm
2010-01-14T20:00:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	dane	you could to check on whether or not a newer version visualboy is available from source on the internet and try to compile it to see if that fixes the issue
