2007-07-29T08:12:00.000Z	viller	buzzbuzz	firestarter is just an interface for iptables which is the firewall installed by default
2007-07-29T08:12:00.000Z	viller	buzzbuzz	you don't NEED to do anything because it's already safe enough
2007-07-29T08:13:00.000Z	buzzbuzz	viller	Alright, so I can leave it out?
