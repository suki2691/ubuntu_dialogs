2010-09-01T21:20:00.000Z	Schmorgluck		I have another question: a few months ago, I bought some two 512 Mo memory modules  to extend my laptop's memory to 1Go, but my computer doesn't seem to be aware that said memory modules are 512 Mo instead of the former 256
2010-09-01T21:20:00.000Z	Schmorgluck		is there anything I should do to correct that?
2010-09-01T21:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Schmorgluck	 check the laptop makers bios/forums/homepage there may be updates.. or it may be a limit of the laptops design
2010-09-01T21:22:00.000Z	Schmorgluck	Dr_Willis	theoretically, the limit is 1Go, but you're right, I should check out there
