2007-06-21T10:02:00.000Z	TaJMoX	slackmagic	: everything i've learned about linux was thanks to google.   and before google, there was webcrawler.     anyways, the answer is always out there already if you know how to search.
2007-06-21T10:03:00.000Z	slackmagic	TaJMoX	amen ..the problem is that - I'm not saying everyone - but quite a lot of people just keep coming here for all sorts of questions..questions they could find answers for by themselves if they took the efforts...I personally think you learn more by trying to search for an answer rather than just asking for one (besides..it improves your searching skills via google as well)
2007-06-21T10:06:00.000Z	TaJMoX	slackmagic	: irc support should be used for quick problems - or as a last resort - like for example: "What's the command to do x"  or  "I have looked everywhere, how do I get x to work with y?"
2007-06-21T10:07:00.000Z	slackmagic	TaJMoX	that's how I mainly use IRC...for stuff I have no answers for really, after I've done quite an amount of time of research ..other than that it's just for entertainment to sit back and read what type of problems other people are dealing with here
