2007-12-28T19:07:00.000Z	argie		Here's the forum thread I posted in detail in: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=652020
2007-12-28T19:07:00.000Z	argie		Basically, what happened is ubiquity crashed while partitioning and now both GParted and Ubiquity show the drive as unpartitioned. However fdisk reports that the partitions exist and that "Partition table entries are not in disk order". It also claims that "Warning: invalid flag 0x0000 of partition table 5 will be corrected by w(rite)".
