2009-08-30T20:35:00.000Z	loak		hello all, I'm going to change my laptop, nVidia® GeForce™ G103M or ATI Mobility™ Radeon™ HD3430, as graphic card ?

2009-08-30T20:40:00.000Z	arand	loak	ok, well, I was referring to ati/nvid in general, if you find that the ati seems to have less issues on ubuntu when you search around, I guess that would be a wiser choice...
