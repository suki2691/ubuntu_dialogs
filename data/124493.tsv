2008-04-10T23:45:00.000Z	Geezle		This is starting to make me a little crazy...it wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't stuck with an awful refresh rate
2008-04-10T23:46:00.000Z	Geezle		Would I be better off just dusting off my 7.10 CD and starting from scratch?  I'd hate to do it, but this is going beyond my knowledge

2008-04-10T23:49:00.000Z	GIn	Geezle	I would do a reinstall
