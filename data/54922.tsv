2011-08-20T06:19:00.000Z	zakwilson	xangua	Gnome is slow to load and I keep finding gnome-settings-daemon doing disk IO for no reason that I can tell. I don't lack for memory, cpu or gpu, so it's not exactly that I want *light*, but I want non-broken.
2011-08-20T06:24:00.000Z	xangua	zakwilson	activate the desktowp switcher plugin in compiz
2011-08-20T06:27:00.000Z	zakwilson	xangua	I see no plugin called that. I use rotate cube.
