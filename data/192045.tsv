2007-04-15T14:53:00.000Z	regress		I'm running an "awk" command which pipes to a "sed" command, and I want to alphabetize the output...any suggestions?
2007-04-15T14:53:00.000Z	regress		should I use awk to sort the output?
2007-04-15T14:53:00.000Z	regress		or is there an easier command in bash to do it?
