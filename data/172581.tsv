2007-05-05T16:43:00.000Z	Meshezabeel		er, what I meant was: is 7.04 capable of detecting serial mice? 6.06 and 6.10 weren't capable
2007-05-05T16:44:00.000Z	Elda	Meshezabeel	not quite sure about the serial mice :>  Let me see if I have one around here though to check.  If its not here it would be at home
2007-05-05T16:44:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	Elda	ok thanks :)
