2009-12-23T12:33:00.000Z	chu_		hey guys, just playing around with the main-menu applet, and I'm wondering if it's possible to remove the menu icon? I can change it, but I would rather remove it. I've looked through gconf a bit, but I'm probably in the wrong place. Any help would be appreciated.
2009-12-23T12:35:00.000Z	quietone	chu_	which icon do you mean?
2009-12-23T12:36:00.000Z	chu_	quietone	I'm using the Mist gtk theme, so the icon for me is a small green tick. Normally it would be an Ubuntu logo (or perhaps a gnome foot, etc). It's the icon to the left of the Applications | Places | System menu
