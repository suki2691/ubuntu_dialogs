2008-12-15T07:20:00.000Z	Phase		On my ubuntu install (doesn't happen on Windows or Debian) in Firefox when I right click a link, there is a good chance it won't pop up the right click menu and it'll just randomly select an option (or so it seems) and it'll do whatever action. I've tried this on a 100% fresh install of Ubuntu 8.10 and Firefox (without addons), any ideas/known issue/fixes?
2008-12-15T07:22:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Phase	i haven't encountered this... fresh install eh? interesting. i have done a few right-clicks on links, but perhaps i should try some more
2008-12-15T07:22:00.000Z	Phase	onetinsoldier	Yeah
2008-12-15T07:23:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Phase	you can always check the bugtracker. but i am pretty new to unbuntu. i don't have an exact link to it.
