2011-05-02T06:12:00.000Z	HyperShock	Guest1224	yes
2011-05-02T06:12:00.000Z	HyperShock	Guest1224	but why would you, libreoffice is far superior to openoffice
2011-05-02T06:28:00.000Z	HyperShock	Guest1224	in your ubuntu software center, you can find and remove open-office there or you can from shell do sudo apt-get remove open-office
