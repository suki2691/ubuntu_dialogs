2012-06-04T00:43:00.000Z	ChrisWere	g3orge	I don't think there is a way. Canical wanted to standardise the UI to make it more easy to give GUI instructions from what I gather
2012-06-04T00:44:00.000Z	g3orge	ChrisWere	there isn't a way? it's still Linux right?
2012-06-04T00:45:00.000Z	ChrisWere	g3orge	it's unity though, and it's not so good
