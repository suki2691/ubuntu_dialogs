2005-06-21T15:04:00.000Z	chombee		Okay - here is a tough problem. My friend is trying to install Ubuntu but has only a non-bootable USB cdrom. Does anyone know of anything that will let us run the cdrom install, some sort of boot disk or something?
2005-06-21T15:04:00.000Z	chombee		 Perhaps we need a boot disk for a linux distro that will let us then mount the usb device and then boot it

2005-06-21T15:05:00.000Z	chombee	madsen	- I just mean some sort of boot disk or distro on disk that will allow me to run the Ubuntu install from the USB cdrom
