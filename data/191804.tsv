2006-12-15T06:57:00.000Z	abo		I found the other day someone who used wine to run IE on linux, ... anyone knows about running msn messenger on linux?
2006-12-15T06:58:00.000Z	abo		arrenlex,will__, I'm using GAIM.. but i miss many of the nice annimations/video/audio features of msn
2006-12-15T06:58:00.000Z	clearscreen	abo	try amsn, and if that doesn't work out, I guess there is no choice then to go for wine + msn messenger
2006-12-15T07:01:00.000Z	abo	clearscreen	arrenlex, amsn says there is a newer version, shouldn't the ubuntu update manager tell me about that and update my amsn?
