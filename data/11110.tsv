2011-08-04T01:35:00.000Z	naptastic		I just did a fresh install of Ubuntu 10.10; I set my account to log in automatically, and did not provide a password for the default keyring. Now my wifi doesn't connect on startup. How do I fix it?
2011-08-04T01:35:00.000Z	naptastic		ah, nevermind, I found it.
2011-08-04T01:35:00.000Z	naptastic		Wow, I'm apparently a dummy ;-)
