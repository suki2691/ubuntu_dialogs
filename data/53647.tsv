2009-06-29T12:15:00.000Z	Guest51792		I am wondering how, in ubuntu 9.04, what command do I run to upgrade to kernel 2.6.28-13?
2009-06-29T12:16:00.000Z	Guest51792		Thanks, snakdoc
2009-06-29T12:17:00.000Z	snakdoc	Guest51792	btw you have to reboot for new kernel to start working
2009-06-29T12:20:00.000Z	snakdoc	Guest51792	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade i made a mistake if you aren't root sorry about that
