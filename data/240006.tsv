2009-02-05T11:22:00.000Z	R34L1TY		Hey guys, Ive just downloaded another backup of Ubuntu, but this time the md5sum is completely different
2009-02-05T11:23:00.000Z	R34L1TY		Anyone know what could cause the md5sum to be so different if the file was downloaded from the same source?
2009-02-05T11:24:00.000Z	R34L1TY		Can anyone run a md5 on ubuntu-8.04.2-desktop-i386
