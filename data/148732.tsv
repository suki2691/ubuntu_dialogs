Is there something more useful than gaim? I would like to have at least sound notice if someone types my nick, and be able to reopen the chat window after having it minimized to the systray

2007-05-02T08:15:00.000Z	slackthumbz		personally I think irssi is the best irc client evar, but it's not graphical
2007-05-02T08:15:00.000Z	nagyv	slackthumbz	it handles irc, I am also able to cook an egg on my computer. Still I am not use to do so. :)
