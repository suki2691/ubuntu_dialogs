2010-02-06T08:01:00.000Z	chelz	Travis-42	faster than running off of a CD but slower than running off of a hard drive
2010-02-06T08:01:00.000Z	Travis-42	chelz	much slower than a hard drive, or might it actually be an acceptable speed?
2010-02-06T08:02:00.000Z	chelz	Travis-42	try installing ubuntu to a usb drive with Unetbootin and try it out.
