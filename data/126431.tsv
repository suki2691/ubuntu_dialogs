2009-01-20T03:35:00.000Z	lokieee		hi guys, this is kind of strange, my sound was working fine on my GNOME but now I installed KDE and I don't have sound...any ideas on what I can check?  In the sound mixer everything is unmuted
2009-01-20T03:36:00.000Z	Rudd-O	lokieee	does the sound come back when you run gnome again?
2009-01-20T03:38:00.000Z	lokieee	Rudd-O	 okay so it seems, my log on and log off sound works fine..i just heard it when I went to log out...but like if i want to say play music via the internet with say www.pandora.com  which uses adobe flash I don't hear any sound.
2009-01-20T03:39:00.000Z	Rudd-O	lokieee	are you using pulseaudio?  IIRC there was a library libflashsupport that you needed to install if you use pulseaudio
