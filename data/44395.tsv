2011-03-28T20:45:00.000Z	cba123		Rebooted my computer, and my mdadm raid5 won't mount.  It says either /dev/sdb1 has no superblock, or I only have 3 devices present.  I see them in gparted.  Here is my mdadm --examine http://pastebin.com/CqXEeBzY
2011-03-28T20:45:00.000Z	cba123		Any ideas?
2011-03-28T20:46:00.000Z	hedkandi	cba123	about what?
2011-03-28T20:47:00.000Z	cba123	hedkandi	I didn't phrase it as a question I guess.  Trying to get my mdadm raid5 to work after a reboot.  Says 3 device isn't enough.
