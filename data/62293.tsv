2009-10-27T02:39:00.000Z	asteroid		hello, running 9.10 I would like to disable (not uninstall) NetworkManager. I disable nm-applet in "preferences â†’ start applications" and via gnome-terminal I did "sudo update-rc.d -f network-manager remove". I reboot. But NetworkManager still manage eth0 and run (seen in `ps`)
