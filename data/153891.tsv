2008-05-07T19:31:00.000Z	starcannon	fnord__	nvidia vidcard, nforce chipset, amd or intel cpu, thats my favorite build if were doing a desktop, everything works great
2008-05-07T19:32:00.000Z	fnord__	starcannon	i was wondering more about how much ram/cpu hardy needs to run smoothly
2008-05-07T19:33:00.000Z	starcannon	fnord__	I have 1gb memory on an everex cloudbook and it works smoothly, ram is the key, cpu anything over 500mhz (of course faster is better but over 500 will get you in the game)
