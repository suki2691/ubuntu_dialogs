2007-03-09T09:53:00.000Z	carlosqueso		to install those packages, just use sudo apt-get install <package name> in the terminal, it's alot faster than synaptic
2007-03-09T09:53:00.000Z	taTe	carlosqueso	 and when i don't know the exact name of the package?
2007-03-09T09:54:00.000Z	carlosqueso	taTe	you can use apt-cache search <something> or that's when synaptic comes in handy
