2009-06-07T15:43:00.000Z	frowningfreezer		I installed Ubuntu 9.04 on an old Pentium III 450Mhz 128 Mb RAM a few days ago, found it way too slow, so tried Xubunty and also Fluxbuntu, but they didn't work for my situation, so now I'm back to Ubuntu and wanted to install Fluxbox on top of that. But now my regular Ubuntu installation seems faster (and workable!) than last time I installed it! The only difference is that I haven't yet installed all the updates the Update Manager
2009-06-07T15:44:00.000Z	frowningfreezer		not when using alternate installation CD
2009-06-07T15:45:00.000Z	frowningfreezer		XFCE better than fluxbox?
2009-06-07T15:45:00.000Z	dakarn	frowningfreezer	i would recommend xfce if you like the 'gnome' experience, but i recommend openbox wm
