2009-09-24T09:31:00.000Z	Caimlas_		hi, I'm trying to figure out how to get kdevelop to work on ubuntu 9.04. I can't seem to find the dev packages for it - qtcore and qtgui headers, specifically. they aren't the logical libqtcore4-dev or libqtgui4-dev packages (whereas the same packages sans the -dev are available). what might I look at doing?
2009-09-24T09:32:00.000Z	lstarnes	Caimlas_	the -dev packages contain headers
2009-09-24T09:32:00.000Z	Caimlas_	Lartza_	ok, I know/realize that. but the dev packages I mention do not appear to be in the repositories.
2009-09-24T09:33:00.000Z	lstarnes	Caimlas_	they may have different names
