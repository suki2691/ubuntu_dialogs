2009-12-28T08:57:00.000Z	edbian	Guest72290	Install the compizconfig-settings-manager and customize compiz to your heart's delight!
2009-12-28T08:58:00.000Z	Guest72290	edbian	dont I already hav it since i can use the cube and other compiz effects
2009-12-28T08:59:00.000Z	edbian	Guest72290	There is compiz (which actually creates the effects) and then there is the settings manager (an enormously complicated setting dialog for compiz)  The settings manager is not required to run compiz.  Do you have the settings manager installed already??
