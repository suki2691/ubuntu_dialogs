2010-06-23T01:05:00.000Z	superannuatedgee		I have just installed Ubuntu server.  It of course has a command line interface.  The documentation seems to imply that I can install Gnome  and use it for many tasks.  Is it sufficient to apt-get gnome? Or do I need to install other stuff too?

2010-06-23T01:12:00.000Z	tic^	superannuatedgee	why not install gnome-desktop and install only the services you need from there? unless you install all the server services.
