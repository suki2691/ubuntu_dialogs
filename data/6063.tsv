I remember that users could vote for things that, if they had enough votes, they'll be implemented in following releases.

2012-01-31T04:16:00.000Z	dablostudio	pgib__	yes! exactly! But i think there was another one, more general, where you can even create your own "brainstorm"
2012-01-31T04:16:00.000Z	pgib__	dablostudio	you can create your own "Ideas" on that page.  then have people (including yourself) propose solutions, vote, etc..
