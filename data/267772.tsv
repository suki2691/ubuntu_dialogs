My sound card seems to be detected when i type lspci but I am receiving an error message when I try to open a volume control "The volume control did not find any elements and/or devices to control. This means either that you don't have the right GStreamer plugins installed, or that you don't have a sound card configured"

2006-05-24T08:44:00.000Z	crimsun	osotogari	no, yours is fine, but lsb_release is the preferred way :-)
