2006-12-08T11:31:00.000Z	Flannel	majestik	they're different.  Simple as that.  "better" depends on what you're looking for, and even then, theres almost always ambiguity
2006-12-08T11:33:00.000Z	majestik	Flannel	yeah its ambiguous, you just cant decide which distribution, its kind of choices of destiny
2006-12-08T11:33:00.000Z	Flannel	majestik	best thing to do is try a few out, and see what you like
