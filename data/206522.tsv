2006-10-18T08:07:00.000Z	sethk	spinz8r	yes.  you can override it
2006-10-18T08:07:00.000Z	sethk	spinz8r	tune2fs can be used to set the check interval, or turn it off completely
2006-10-18T08:07:00.000Z	sethk	spinz8r	turning it off completely is not recommended, but you may want to disable the auto check so you can decide when to take the time hit.
