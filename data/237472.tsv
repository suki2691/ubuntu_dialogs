2010-04-24T19:51:00.000Z	haavaros		Do you think Ubuntu is as noob-friendly as Win 7? For a complete noob, is Ubuntu as simple to use as Windows?
2010-04-24T19:51:00.000Z	haavaros		I myself think so, but that's from my perspective
2010-04-24T19:52:00.000Z	isaac_	haavaros	I haven't tried Win7 yet (I don't pay for stuff I don't need... probably get Win7 when I get a new computer) but Ubuntu latest is dead easy even for me.
