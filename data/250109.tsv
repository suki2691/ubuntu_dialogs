2005-02-10T11:55:00.000Z	Ewwmg		I just installed gdesklets with snyaptic.. did nothing else. It.. doesn't start. One of the FAQ's said to check the logfile at ~/.gdesklets.. I'm a nub at Linux, could someone please tell me how I can at least view that? I don't know how exactly to "get to it"
2005-02-10T11:55:00.000Z	mbp_	Ewwmg	ls -l ~/.gdesklets
2005-02-10T11:59:00.000Z	mbp_	Ewwmg	how are you trying to start it
2005-02-10T12:00:00.000Z	Ewwmg	mbp_	I have Xfce.. pretty much right-clicking > Accessories > Gdesklets
