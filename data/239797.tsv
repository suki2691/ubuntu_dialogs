2007-12-24T22:16:00.000Z	nickrud	casey__	no, it requires a reinstall
2007-12-24T22:16:00.000Z	nickrud	casey__	and really, there's no reason to change to 64bit unless you're doing some real strong number crunching on software written for 64bits
2007-12-24T22:19:00.000Z	nickrud	casey__	they are nuts.  add deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu gutsy partner   /etc/apt/sources.list , then run sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude install vmware-server
