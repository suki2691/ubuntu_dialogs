2007-07-26T16:19:00.000Z	ianRG		hypothetically i want to upgrade apache2.0 to 2.1 or any other common program for that matter. can i just "apt-get upgrade"
2007-07-26T16:21:00.000Z	Kawika	ianRG	I just tried that.  I think that command will look for all upgrades ??
2007-07-26T16:21:00.000Z	Kawika	ianRG	I'm running Ubuntu Feisty, and in the GUI, I get a notification of upgrades available.
