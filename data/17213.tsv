2011-06-08T07:23:00.000Z	sontek	Polah	I tried the gnome3 team ppa and it hosed my system, actually had to reinstall...first time I've ever had an unfixable problem in linux :P
2011-06-08T07:24:00.000Z	sontek		but Unity is broken, I launch stuff and the windows pop up behind other things
2011-06-08T07:24:00.000Z	Polah	sontek	It broke my GNOME and Unity disappeared. I use PPA-purge to revert to 2
