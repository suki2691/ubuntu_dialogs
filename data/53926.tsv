2009-12-11T08:07:00.000Z	vixermixer		ok i was able to succesfully start postfix server after reinstallation. For a basic website SMTP do i need to change any settings?
2009-12-11T08:09:00.000Z	vixermixer		in postfix config can i enter my gmail address or it has to be servers account name to receive mail over smtp?
2009-12-11T08:10:00.000Z	vixermixer		<Guest20044> uninstall all plugins like swfdec and gnash and then go to package manager and find flash installer...
