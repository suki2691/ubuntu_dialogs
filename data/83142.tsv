2008-08-09T22:18:00.000Z	qr	pyrite1978	why would it freak out? as long as you don't actually try to USE the option it should be fine. Worst case senerio you remove the entry from menu.list and everyhting is good.
2008-08-09T22:19:00.000Z	pyrite1978	qr	Im not sure,,  ijust seem to recall one time removing a linux install, and grub would not let me load my remaining vista,  i had to use vista recovery disk to remove grub
2008-08-09T22:20:00.000Z	qr	pyrite1978	yes, that is the case... however that is not the senerio we were talking about. you removed linux with grub as the bootloader, we were talking about removing windows when grub is the bootloader.
