2010-08-02T20:45:00.000Z	lynne		I have a question about video memory  ! any one
2010-08-02T20:47:00.000Z	lynne		I bought a Video Card with Large amount of memory for video inside of Windows inside of Virtual Box
2010-08-02T20:47:00.000Z	lynne		and it ( Virtual Box ) does not see it
2010-08-02T20:47:00.000Z	bareego	lynne	once you go into a virtual box the memory in your video card won't make a difference
