2011-01-18T20:01:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	markturnip	background it? 'commandofchoice &'
2011-01-18T20:03:00.000Z	markturnip	aeon-ltd	Ist that the only way? Some init.d/ scripts allow me to "start" then they will just run as a daemon?
2011-01-18T20:04:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	markturnip	no idea, i've never created a daemon
