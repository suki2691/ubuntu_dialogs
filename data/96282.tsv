2010-06-12T00:34:00.000Z	nacitar		I've installed amarok on an ubuntu server installation and the tray icon is showing up as a question mark, as if it couldn't find the icon... any clues how to fix it?
2010-06-12T00:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nacitar	why are you installing amarok on the server release? Why didnt you install the desktop if you wanted a desktop system?

However, if installing the "ubuntu-desktop" package would be the solution to amarok then that would mean amarok is missing a dependency somewhere along the way.  using the server release isn't "the problem".
