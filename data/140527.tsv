2008-06-19T19:48:00.000Z	Marcieking		I'm trying to log in to the web-interface of Vmware Server 1.0.6, installed on Ubuntu 8.4 server (64bit). When I use my own username it gives an error when I click the options tab, it says i'm not authorized to do that. I've found out that the root account should be authorized, but logging in as root doesn't work as i've never set a root password
2008-06-19T19:49:00.000Z	Marcieking		it's a webbased interface where i need to log on

2008-06-19T19:50:00.000Z	sivel	Marcieking	no
