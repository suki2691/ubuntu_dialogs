2011-10-15T07:53:00.000Z	arghx	boxbeatsy	only with several ftp clients. you could write a script for ncftpput which does this
2011-10-15T07:55:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	arghx	ah i see, i was trying to write a script that automates ncftp, but it just pauses fater the initial login when promnpted for the username.  do you know how i can write a shell script that can take standard input?
