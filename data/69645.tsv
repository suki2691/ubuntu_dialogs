2012-03-29T15:50:00.000Z	Ben64		i'm running lucid, and libc6-dbg is  2.11.1-0ubuntu7.10
2012-03-29T15:50:00.000Z	Ben64		doesn't want me to downgrade anything
2012-03-29T15:51:00.000Z	Ben64		i'm guessing its a repository problem, because mine is working fine
2012-03-29T15:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	Ben64	we have a list of his repository already http://paste.ubuntu.com/905460/ ; I haven't seen the source.list.d yet maybe we should also see that?
