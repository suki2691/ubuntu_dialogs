2006-06-01T05:30:00.000Z	dyn		hi all :)
2006-06-01T05:31:00.000Z	dyn		i'm doing a clean install of 6.06.. approximately how long should it take to resize a 80Gb NTFS to 60Gb? it's been working for half an hour now and I'm slightly worried..
2006-06-01T05:32:00.000Z	_nano_	dyn	i think if the drive is fragmented it might take a while
2006-06-01T05:32:00.000Z	dyn	_nano_	so over 30 mins can be ok?
