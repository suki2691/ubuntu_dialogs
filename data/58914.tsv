2009-12-05T19:01:00.000Z	khensthoth	mefiX	http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.32/ Use at your own risk =)
2009-12-05T19:03:00.000Z	mefiX	khensthoth	jrib: thx! but when will 2.6.32 be available in ubuntu "mainstream"?
2009-12-05T19:03:00.000Z	khensthoth	mefiX	Probably in the next release. I don't know though.
