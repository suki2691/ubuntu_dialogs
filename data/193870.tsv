2006-10-26T15:50:00.000Z	mariano		well, the ubuntu community is large enough as far as help goes right?
2006-10-26T15:50:00.000Z	Phlosten	mariano	dapper has long term support, edgy is cutting edge,. depends what you want
2006-10-26T15:51:00.000Z	Phlosten	mariano	i was going to stick with dapper for a while, but edgy has some nice new software which is handy
