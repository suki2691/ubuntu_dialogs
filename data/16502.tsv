2011-03-26T15:20:00.000Z	truepurple	sacarlson	So is the root one the only one worth concerning myself with, and ignore these /home and /usr labels?
2011-03-26T15:22:00.000Z	truepurple	sacarlson	I will have at least 3, 1 for linux, 1 for windows, and a joint one. Should I concern myself which is /home and which is /usr?
2011-03-26T15:23:00.000Z	brothersome	truepurple	usr Universal services/system root ---- Only for programs / libraries etc.
