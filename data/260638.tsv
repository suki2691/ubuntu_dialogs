2004-12-19T06:03:00.000Z	jo		Hello, I have a question concerning Ubuntu and hackers :-) I'm still missing some stuff in Ubuntu that makes Debian a great hacker's workstation. Stuff like Mono for example. Will this be improved with Hoary? I'm curious, which one (Debian or Ubuntu) do the Canonical employees use for their daily hacking?

After basic install, I tried to use udev/hal and alsa instead of oss. Couldn't get alsa to work properly. It's nice to see this stuff pre-configured in Ubuntu. Unfortunately I'm still quite reluctant to completely switch, since I'm not sure how my programming needs are supported by Ubuntu...
