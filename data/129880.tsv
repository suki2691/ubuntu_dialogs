2007-06-23T06:39:00.000Z	marfeath		I'm trying to get postgresql in ubuntu and it is not working - "Your PHP installation does not support PostgreSQL. You need to recompile PHP using the --with-pgsql configure option."  Am I missing something?

2007-06-23T06:40:00.000Z	marfeath	Ireal	hah, actually I just figured it out, I needed to reload apache after I did that.  Thanks though
