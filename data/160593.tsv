2007-06-13T10:40:00.000Z	sid		I have Ubuntu 5.10, what is the best way to upgrade to the latest?
2007-06-13T10:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sid	You can either upgrade to Dapper then Edgy then Feisty or clean install keeping your /home
2007-07-31T13:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	sid	Have you tried the -t switch with the mount command?
2007-07-31T13:09:00.000Z	sid	Jordan_U	yea, mount /dev/sda1 -t vfat /tmp; works... but this filesystem doesn't show up on a windows machine
