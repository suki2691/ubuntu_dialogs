2007-04-01T15:09:00.000Z	therealnanotube	comradec	click the window close button? :)
2007-04-01T15:10:00.000Z	comradec	therealnanotube	I want it to close automatically though, it seems my monitor won't shut off if I leave it open, its weird though cause xscreensaver will come on, but it wont turn the power off to the backlight
2007-04-01T15:12:00.000Z	therealnanotube	comradec	hmm, don't know...
