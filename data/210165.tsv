2005-11-29T14:02:00.000Z	wickers		ok, quick question, how do you guys fight linux addiction?
2005-11-29T14:02:00.000Z	wickers		'cause I'm currently depressed, or in a form of depression, and being adicted to linux is only distracting me from getting better.
2005-11-29T14:04:00.000Z	Rotan	wickers	have you been addicted to other distros?
2005-11-29T14:04:00.000Z	wickers	Rotan	it's linux in general.. or computing in general...
