2012-09-06T04:04:00.000Z	dalek_	xangua	been searching.. cannot find anything relevant.. there are image frames on this template, and I can't even click to select them.
2012-09-06T04:07:00.000Z	dalek_	xangua	I can find nothing about selecting a frame which cannot be clicked. Everything in the documentation seems to involve being able to actually click the image frame. I don't get it.
