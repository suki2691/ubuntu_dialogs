2006-01-07T10:10:00.000Z	Linksman		Just installed Ubuntu for the first time (long-time SuSE user) and am LOVING it. Don't know why I waited so long. Happy New Year everyone!

2006-01-07T10:12:00.000Z	Linksman	ColonelPanique	I hear ya. The free aspect has a philosophical pull on me. I simply feel better using Ubuntu. If you're gonna stick it to the man, don't just switch to another man.
