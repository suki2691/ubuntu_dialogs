2011-02-22T02:55:00.000Z	oldlady		I wonder if you could help me, please. I think my husband will soon make me get a laptop. I'd like to have linux on it, but I really can't afford any of the preinstalled linux computers. Is there any laptop that plays nice with linux that I can buy at say, Best Buy or Microcenter?
