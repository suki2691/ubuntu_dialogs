2005-06-16T13:35:00.000Z	d1		I've got a (little) problem setting up my wlan connection. i've installed the appropriate drivers of my card via ndiswrapper and iwlist returns the wlan-net i want to connect to. however, when using windows, i have to go to a login-page (https://login....) and sign-on with my username/pw. when i try to connect to the login-page in ubuntu i get an error... anyone who has a hint for me, where i should start looking?
