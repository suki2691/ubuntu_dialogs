2009-03-10T17:34:00.000Z	x4d		Now that you mentioned emacs and vim... what would you suggest for PHP? I'm used to writing with TextMate on a mac but I've been thinking about seeing what's so great about vim and emacs...

2009-03-10T17:35:00.000Z	x4d	sachac	how is the code completion?
2009-03-10T17:36:00.000Z	sachac	x4d	Hmm, I don't know, I've never bothered to set it up. I use tags to jump around to function definitions a lot, though.
