2010-09-23T22:41:00.000Z	deryl	rizzuh	~ not true. i have to have more than 2GB for suspend to disk to work
2010-09-23T22:41:00.000Z	rizzuh	deryl	sure. Anything more is useless with decent amounts of RAM.
2010-09-23T22:42:00.000Z	deryl	rizzuh	~ while agreed, the usual rule of thumb is equal to ram in the event that the entire amount of ram (for whatever reason) has to be swapped out. (fucked up context switch or something)
