2006-06-28T06:34:00.000Z	apokryphos	angry_candy	hd is normally an actual hard-disk, whereas sd is normally reserved for external devices

2006-06-28T06:35:00.000Z	angry_candy	apokryphos	i have 4 sd's here that seem to correspond to 4 drives.  not sure if they are set up as hw mirrors/raid/etc. ... ?
