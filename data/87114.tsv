2008-06-22T23:27:00.000Z	aslock		I just installed ubuntu 8.04 64bit and encountering problems with "applications->add/remove..."...first it always asked me to reload the list of applications...now it doesn't even start anymore...what's wrong?

2008-06-22T23:29:00.000Z	aslock	MrWizeGuy1983	thanks, how's that package manager called?
2008-06-22T23:29:00.000Z	MrWizeGuy1983	aslock	i'm not sure of the name, i'd search package manager and see if it comes up
