2008-05-20T08:59:00.000Z	calm		Hi everyone! Does anyone know how to find out the current value for the hdparm apm setting? (For example, hdparm -B 254 will *set* the value to 254, but I just want to *get* the value.)
2008-05-20T08:59:00.000Z	cdm10	calm	try just typing hdparm -B

2008-05-20T08:59:00.000Z	calm	cdm10	that doesn't work for -B
