2011-10-07T00:25:00.000Z	dockhorn		hi, i just upgraded from 10.04 to 10.10 and my sound is really quiet...  i looked online and found suggestions i recompile the kernel.  is there a simpler way to fix it?
2011-10-07T00:27:00.000Z	OerHeks	dockhorn	maybe continue upgrade to 11.04 ?
2011-10-07T00:28:00.000Z	OerHeks	dockhorn	check the update manager, software-sources, and see if upgrade is set to normal ( bottom line )
2011-10-07T00:30:00.000Z	dockhorn	OerHeks	yep, it's set to normal.  though yesterday it didn't think there were any updates at all, now it says there are 165 updates and it's running through them.
