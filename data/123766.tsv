2008-10-26T19:05:00.000Z	flats		Good morning,  I am running the ultimate edition of ubuntu and I have a laptop running 1920X1280.  When I first login to ubuntu before the desktop and when I exit ubuntu I have screens that look like they out way out of sync.  The normal desktop is OK but these two login and logout screens looks all out of whack.  Anyone familiar with what I'm talking about or how to fix it?
