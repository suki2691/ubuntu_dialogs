2008-12-13T18:39:00.000Z	AzizLight		im installing kubuntu on top of ubuntu in a seperate partition at the moment. I was wondering, can I use the same swap partition or I have to create a new one?
2008-12-13T18:41:00.000Z	AzizLight		can I use the same swap partition for two linux distros that are on the same computer?

2008-12-13T18:41:00.000Z	AzizLight	afief	ok thanks :)
