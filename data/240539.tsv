2005-07-06T15:36:00.000Z	IceDC571	cion	pretty much anywhere in your home folder.. if you're using it for yourself
2005-07-06T15:37:00.000Z	IceDC571	cion	firewall should already be running (iptables)
2005-07-06T15:38:00.000Z	IceDC571	cion	the firewall should already be running on boot, i think firestarter would tell you if its not running
