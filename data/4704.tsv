2012-03-11T22:51:00.000Z	CacheMoney		I installed Ubuntu (32-bit) on an old laptop yeterday and it went fairly smoothly (after setting up the wireless card).  However, I'd like to now dual-boot with my new laptop but I'm unsure if I should go with the 32-bit or 64-bit version.  On the Ubuntu page it says 32-bit (recommended)
2012-03-11T22:53:00.000Z	CacheMoney		i was viewing the page on my old laptop, I'm going to visit the page on my new laptop and see what they recommend
2012-03-11T22:54:00.000Z	CacheMoney		I have a 64-bit CPU... just wondering if I will run into more challenges using Ubuntu 64-bit (I'm new to Linux and want to reduce the friction for adoption)
