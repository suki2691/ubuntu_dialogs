2010-03-21T08:39:00.000Z	gustin	albech	it depends on how you set up networking
2010-03-21T08:40:00.000Z	albech	gustin	but it is possible? i have a dual wan router configured, but was just wondering if a host behind the router creating a tunnel to another one outside the router would utilize both connections
