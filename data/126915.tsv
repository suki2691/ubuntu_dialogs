2008-01-01T18:08:00.000Z	alyssum	checkers	gnome partition editor has it, if it's installed (under System->Administration)
2008-01-01T18:08:00.000Z	checkers	alyssum	can I do it in console?
2008-01-01T18:10:00.000Z	alyssum	checkers	well, i don't know an easy way, but you can look at your /boot/grub/menu.lst file and figure them out
