2005-07-31T11:46:00.000Z	sanguinalis		So, I'm a complete newb and I have no idea what I am doing and I can't seem to figure out how to get my wireless card to work on Ubuntu
2005-07-31T11:48:00.000Z	sanguinalis		Yeah, Awesome, ok, that is the first straight forward guide I have found so far...
2005-07-31T11:48:00.000Z	highvoltage	sanguinalis	which one? ubuntuguide? it's not recomended, since it's just a bunch of commands.
