2005-02-10T10:07:00.000Z	thully		Does anybody know of good flash-based music players that work w/Linux?  I noticed latest rhythmbox has some type of iPod option, what exactly does that do?

2005-02-10T10:10:00.000Z	ironwolf	thully	rhythmbox doesn't work with my ipod, gnupod-tools does.  *read README carefully though*
2005-02-10T10:11:00.000Z	ironwolf	thully	sorry, for putting songs on/off and playlists, for playing no reason rhythmbox shouldn't work.
