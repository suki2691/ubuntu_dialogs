2011-11-10T08:08:00.000Z	quixotedon	soreau	this is what i understood though, without the term of more reliable/stable
2011-11-10T08:09:00.000Z	soreau	quixotedon	I'm sure this behooves the ubuntu team to strive for LTS to be as reliable as possible but that's not particularly different from any other release
