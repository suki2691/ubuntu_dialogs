2010-09-05T20:17:00.000Z	bitreader		Hi, I just installed ubuntu, and would like to watch some youtube videos but flash's not installed yet. When firefox's plugin manager prompts for the assistance to install flash, and I agree, the installation fails, well it doesn't even start. What should I do?
2010-09-05T20:18:00.000Z	focusone	bitreader	are you root?
2010-09-05T20:18:00.000Z	focusone		ok I will help you set it up... can I get an account? ... lol..
2010-09-05T20:19:00.000Z	bitreader	focusone	I don't think so. BluesKaj 'aptitude install flashplugin-installer'?
