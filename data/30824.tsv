2010-06-10T14:34:00.000Z	sburjan		anyone know how can I extrect information from a windows .exe ? my guess is that it's a SFX file actually
2010-06-10T14:36:00.000Z	FireCrotch	sburjan	an SFX file is a self-extracting type of archive, I believe. You'll probably have the most success running it with Wine
2010-06-10T14:38:00.000Z	sburjan	FireCrotch	: it;'s the office 2010 instlall, and It's only ONE executable file. And I getsome error, and in order to fix that error, I have to unpack the .exe and edit some files
2010-06-10T14:38:00.000Z	FireCrotch	sburjan	you may have some success with cabextract then
