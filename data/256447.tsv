2009-01-11T12:14:00.000Z	Cotowar		Yea, i've been in for about a year, and I really haven't done anything too tough. I set up a virtual machine, recompiled the kernel, and installed a few things from source. not too tough
2009-01-11T12:16:00.000Z	Cotowar		I was wondering, is it possible to transfer some of my Kernel files to a flash drive, so that my computer can only boot if the drive is plugged in?
