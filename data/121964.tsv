2008-10-03T07:15:00.000Z	l337ingDisorder		I'm trying to write a bash script that calls another bash script for output... to simplify, I'd like to have a list of e-mail addresses in a text file separated by commas, and I'd like to have this list dumped in between a pair of quotes in a bash script.. can someone point me in the right direction for docs on how to do that?
2008-10-03T07:17:00.000Z	l337ingDisorder		hmm.. -simplify +clarify
