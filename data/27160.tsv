2010-10-12T02:15:00.000Z	LordDragon	tacomaster	length isnt as big a deal as variety of chracters. make it 6-10 random chars. use punctuation, alternating case, and numbers
2010-10-12T02:16:00.000Z	tacomaster	LordDragon	so if i have above 20 chars long with symbols, numbers, and letters its that decent?
2010-10-12T02:16:00.000Z	LordDragon	tacomaster	yes that should be sufficient
