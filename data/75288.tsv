2011-11-17T23:41:00.000Z	genii-around	Explodingpiglets	Alternately: sudo dpkg -i filename.deb
2011-11-17T23:46:00.000Z	genii-around	Explodingpiglets	A file that has an ELF header
2011-11-17T23:47:00.000Z	genii-around	Explodingpiglets	Is the file in a folder within /home/your-username  or somewhere else?
