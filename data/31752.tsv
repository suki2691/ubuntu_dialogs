2012-09-13T18:27:00.000Z	vector		I dislike unity
2012-09-13T18:29:00.000Z	vector		i have 4 24" monitors... I hate flying the mouse all the way over the the left screen (screens 1 and 2 counted from the left are my secondary monitors really)
2012-09-13T18:29:00.000Z	vector		I'm sure there's probably a way to move the thing, but I get irritated quickly (in seconds) and didn't ever give it another chance
2012-09-13T18:30:00.000Z	TJ-	vector	Same here - I've always been a big multi-monitor user and these small-device accommodations are a backwards step for me
