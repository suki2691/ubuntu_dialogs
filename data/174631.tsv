2007-06-07T11:46:00.000Z	lunartear		I'm having a problem starting named in a chrooted environment. I'm not getting any kind of messages from it and i dont see anything in the logs. I'm issuing /usr/sbin/named -u bind -t /var/lib/named   any ideas to help me get it up and running or even some error messages would be great.  its BIND 9.3.2
