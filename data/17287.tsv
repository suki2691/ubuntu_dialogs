2011-03-07T05:23:00.000Z	dasen1		Hi guys, I'm using natty amd64 and for some reason things don't get upgraded after I do a "sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get dist-ugprade', it says there is nothing to upgrade, and I've been getting that for a few months. The reason I'm disappointed is that I want to try the latest Unity code. Does anyone have the same problem? Do you want me to show my sources.list?

2011-03-07T05:29:00.000Z	dasen1	edbian	safe-upgrade doesn't work, apt complains it doesn't recognize that option...
2011-03-07T05:29:00.000Z	edbian	dasen1	oh, sorry.   There is an aptitude safe-upgrade.  It's apt-get upgrade for apt-get.
