2008-02-19T08:23:00.000Z	CaptainMurphy		Which sounds kind of retarded becuase it should be easy right?
2008-02-19T08:24:00.000Z	CaptainMurphy		I'm doing a dual boot ubuntu/xp. I'v already loaded xp, and I want to have ubuntu partion itself 35gigs, with a 4 gig swap and the rest of my harddrive (like 160 gigs) into fat32 so that both xp and ubuntu can get at it.
