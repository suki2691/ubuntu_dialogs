2008-06-04T02:45:00.000Z	Bachiir		Help, please (let me know if I should just stop reposting and just be more patient): I just upgraded to hardy and have been having graphical issues ever since. I'm pretty sure that it has something to do with fglrx not being installed correctly, but I can't seem to figure it out on my own. Any help would be appreciated.

2008-06-04T02:46:00.000Z	_Ben__	Bachiir	oh dear... onboard ati is always difficult...
