BUT in the AM when I pressed ESCAPE it didnt do anything. In fact nothing I pressed did anything and I tried to try it all. I noticed that the Numlock lisght was on. Nothing was blinking. And so here I am again, imposing on your good graces. (AMD-Ubuntu 9.10- nothing fancy uses browser, xchat, transmission,
