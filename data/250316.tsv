2006-12-16T09:18:00.000Z	sadf		I have a problem... Dapper Drake on amd64... the icons I use to launch programs mostly fail now, especially admin stuff.  I get no error message, it simply fails to launch.

2006-12-16T09:19:00.000Z	apokryphos	sadf	why?
2006-12-16T09:19:00.000Z	apokryphos	sadf	I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that it's a 64-bit install
