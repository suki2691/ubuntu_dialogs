2011-08-02T16:14:00.000Z	vaev		how does the ubuntu package system work in this case: natty repository has package x version y but another source has package x version y+1.. how does ubuntu (apt) determine which one to use/install?
2011-08-02T16:15:00.000Z	vaev		how about if it's a distribution default package that should not be overwritten by a newer version? (like gnome2 to gnome3 I assume)
