2010-10-17T14:29:00.000Z	martijn_		hi folks, i'm having trouble getting  a backtrace for a program, can anyone lend me a hand?
2010-10-17T14:30:00.000Z	nibbler_	martijn_	what exactly do you want to do? you can use strace to trace it in the first place
2010-10-17T14:33:00.000Z	martijn_	nibbler_	I'm trying to use gdb to get a stacktrace from rhythmbox (as described on the wiki). The weird thing is, rhythmbox doesn't crash like it does without the debugger, but does get frozen.
2010-10-17T14:34:00.000Z	nibbler_	martijn_	sorry, no idea.
