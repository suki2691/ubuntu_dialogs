2007-09-10T13:31:00.000Z	FrazzledPenguin	academy	My experience has been that they will not. I do not know this as a fact, but I have had issues with that in my own mail servers. Once I requested a PTR record in place so that AOL could do a successful reverse DNS lookup everything worked from there on out.
