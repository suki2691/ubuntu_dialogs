2007-06-07T09:42:00.000Z	ubuntu-rocks		i have a fiesty lamp box with only a 6 gig drive and just ran out of space causing the web site to go offline, what is the recommended solution for adding another drive?
2007-06-07T09:43:00.000Z	ubuntu-rocks		e.g what should i put on the additional drive, logs etc.
2007-06-07T09:44:00.000Z	ubuntu-rocks		120 Gigs, i'm not sure the drive will work, i couldn't get the drive to be recognized during my install, hence the smaller drive
