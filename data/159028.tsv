2007-08-16T08:46:00.000Z	Lanf		irishdave, you could install kbiff I guess if you need to stick with evolution
2007-08-16T08:46:00.000Z	IrishDave	Lanf	I need the exchange functionality that evolution provides, I cant get thunderbird to do exchange properly for me, only by pop3 or IMAP
2007-08-16T08:49:00.000Z	IrishDave	Lanf	thanks for trying anyway, I did see some people using xfce that had something which seemed to be an applet on the application bar that informed of new mail?
