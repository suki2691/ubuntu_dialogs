2006-03-18T07:48:00.000Z	FlannelKing		Hey guys, is there any easy (as in, not me having to write it myself) method of blacklisting an IP after they fail to login X times? or... try to login to too many user names or anything?

2006-03-18T07:49:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Kyral	any idea on keywords?  tried googling a few things, not much in the way of answers, just other people asking the same questions ;)
2006-03-18T07:50:00.000Z	FlannelKing	Kyral	nevermind, found it.  Strangely the second listing under "howtoforge" googling.
