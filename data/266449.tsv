2009-09-21T18:10:00.000Z	NoMS		Is anyone here pretty familiar with conky?  I have it setup to display cpu load information on a quad core processor.    It displays the % of cpu power used correctly, but the bar graph does not reflect the % used.  ie.  % = 100%  bar graph shows roughly 25% used.  Any ideas?
