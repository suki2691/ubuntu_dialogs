2007-04-15T16:22:00.000Z	san_diego_guy		i just installed Ubuntu for the first time last night (6.10) and spent a lot of time setting up my system
2007-04-15T16:22:00.000Z	san_diego_guy		i'm coming from Windows XP and so far things look really good... the only thing i can't live without would be: World of Warcraft, Adobe PhotoShop and Lightroom
