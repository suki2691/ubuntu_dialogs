2009-01-28T20:42:00.000Z	j-b-r		I'm getting corrupted .deb files during the installation no matter if I use the normal or alternate installer and different CDs.
2009-01-28T20:42:00.000Z	j-b-r		No.
2009-01-28T20:42:00.000Z	Slart	j-b-r	have you used the "check cd" option?
2009-01-28T20:45:00.000Z	Slart	j-b-r	then I think there's something wrong with the cd
