2009-05-22T02:18:00.000Z	sidh		i feel disapointed : i've chosen alternate cd for having the choice of not install grub on MBR (i've made an install of 3 OS before ubuntu without touching the mbr)
2009-05-22T02:18:00.000Z	sidh		while the ubuntu installation
2009-05-22T02:18:00.000Z	mzz	sidh	this *is* possible but it was not particularly obvious
2009-05-22T02:19:00.000Z	mzz	sidh	I forgot exactly what I had to do, but basically hit "no! don't do that! abort!" a couple of times until I got a list of installer steps, then pointed it to the one right after the mbr
