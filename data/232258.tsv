2008-01-28T16:34:00.000Z	BuksH		help: my ubuntu LAMP sever keeps reboot every hour (Gutsy and Hardy) both does this.
2008-01-28T16:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	BuksH	any clue on the logs ? ( /var/log/syslog /var/log/messages )
2008-01-28T16:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	BuksH	and the other log?
2008-01-28T16:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	BuksH	maybe it is a hardware error? CPU overheating?
