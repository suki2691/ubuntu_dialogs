2008-11-11T11:10:00.000Z	Phobiac		Anyone know where I can go from here? I suspect I messed up the config file that amarok uses. It won't load up. I've tried uninstalling, purging, purging and removing the folder that holds the settings, nothing works.

2008-11-11T11:12:00.000Z	Phobiac	midifreak	I know, I uninstalled and deleted the amarok folder under .kde
