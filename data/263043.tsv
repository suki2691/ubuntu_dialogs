2007-05-22T06:30:00.000Z	voraistos		HI. I have a question about *other* linux distros.
2007-05-22T06:30:00.000Z	voraistos		How come some companies can charge for it ?
2007-05-22T06:31:00.000Z	voraistos		but it is supposed to be based on the GPL, and the GPL says you cant charge for the software, but you can charge for the support
2007-05-22T06:32:00.000Z	mjr	voraistos	the GPL says no such thing
