2005-05-16T12:21:00.000Z	djm62	Le-Chuck	no need to beg, but if people here could help, they would have done so
2005-05-16T12:22:00.000Z	djm62	Le-Chuck	can you try for an IRC channel more specific to that software?
2005-05-16T12:25:00.000Z	Le-Chuck	djm62	of course but the problem is surely specific to the ubuntu package - it's very easy to install the package in general from source, but I don't know anything about apache configuration, nor I know how ubuntu does the "automatic" configuration after installation
