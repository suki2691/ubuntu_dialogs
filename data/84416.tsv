2011-07-12T13:33:00.000Z	naxa		hi! i have 10.04 and having problems with my nvidia geforce 6200: cpu usage is very high by xorg, compiz enabled. previously i had geforce2 so and i also tried the binary drivers from nvidia site, could anyone help me sort this out so i could properly reinstall my drivers, not ubuntu? (i have already purged nvidia* and installed nvidia-current what first caused conflict with the kernel modules somehow and also some warning about vdpau)
2011-07-12T13:34:00.000Z	szal	naxa	first properly uninstall the binary nVidia driver -> 'sudo nvidia-installer --uninstall'
