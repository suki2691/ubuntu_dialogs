2011-07-21T12:58:00.000Z	tomodachi	jatt	if they are both in the package manage then its easy. the command python2.6 will give you that version and python2.7 the other

2011-07-21T13:03:00.000Z	tomodachi	jatt	youre welcome . in your system you will also have python. wich will be a symlink to either 2.6 or 2.7
