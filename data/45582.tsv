2011-10-28T18:52:00.000Z	Snicksie		I still cant unlock my screen... changing my password doesnt work, mv'ing .Xauthority (as suggested on the forum) doesnt work, my permissions for the shadow and gshadow-stuff is correct... Logging in via tty1 works perfect, Trying to unlock gives Incorrect password, even though the password is 100% correct... I cant reboot because I have some important files open...

2011-10-28T18:54:00.000Z	Snicksie	_trine	its graphical interfaces that have the files open... i can login via tty (ctrl-alt-f1), but that wont really help me with saving the files :(
2011-10-28T18:55:00.000Z	_trine	Snicksie	could you add another user and login with that
