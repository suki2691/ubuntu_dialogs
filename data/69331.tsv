2009-01-18T12:02:00.000Z	nickrud	P4C0	I don't see swat in the repos; if it's not there it's probably for a similar reason to webmin
2009-01-18T12:02:00.000Z	P4C0	nickrud	i did a apt-get install swat and it worked
2009-01-18T12:03:00.000Z	nickrud	P4C0	it's not in my intrepid list, you mush have an older editon
