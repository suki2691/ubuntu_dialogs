2011-10-14T17:12:00.000Z	drapedup		is there a remote desktop/vnc server/client that is fast enough over gigabit wired ethernet to stream 1080p+ video?
2011-10-14T17:12:00.000Z	drapedup		xrdp is not doing it for me. I tried nx, but it didn't work the way I wanted it to either
2011-10-14T17:12:00.000Z	phlak_user	drapedup	why would you use vnc to do that?
2011-10-14T17:13:00.000Z	drapedup	phlak_user	I just want to know if it's possible.
