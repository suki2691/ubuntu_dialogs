2010-04-22T05:25:00.000Z	Halitech	vocx	mark it in Synaptic and see what it wants to include and how much additional space it wants to use, can cancel if its too much

2010-04-22T05:27:00.000Z	Halitech	vocx	got ya, I run xfce and I use a few gtk apps and a few qt apps, avidemux being one that looks better in qt then gtk
