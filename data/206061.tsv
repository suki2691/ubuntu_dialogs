2005-11-28T12:41:00.000Z	Stormx2		how can I make ubuntu a bit faster on a 1.4ghz cpu / 256mb ram?
2005-11-28T12:42:00.000Z	swistak	Stormx2	well for starters - thing that i'm going to so - recompile kernel and install more compact window menager (ex. fluxbox)
2005-11-28T12:42:00.000Z	Stormx2	swistak	Fluxbox eh ;-) Do my gnome apps work on it?
2005-11-28T12:43:00.000Z	swistak	Stormx2	well, as far asi i know, if you have libraries (and you do if you have gnome installed already) then yes the'll work just like KDE aps work under gnome
