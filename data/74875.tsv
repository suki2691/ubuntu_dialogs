2010-09-03T13:50:00.000Z	joljam		I want to install Windows XP and ubuntu 9.10 together as dual boot. should I install XP first and them ubuntu 9.10 or vice versa
2010-09-03T13:51:00.000Z	lelle	joljam	why not 10.04? i think it has long term support = 4 years instead of 2 like 9.10
2010-09-03T13:51:00.000Z	joljam	lelle	.. I am having problems with 10.04 so for the time being I am not using 10.04
2010-09-03T13:51:00.000Z	lelle	joljam	ok
