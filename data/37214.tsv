2010-02-15T11:31:00.000Z	josephnexus	deity1	most likely not ext4, unless you've manually updated the kernel
2010-02-15T11:32:00.000Z	josephnexus	deity1	sometimes people run old distros, but only update the kernel
2010-02-15T11:32:00.000Z	deity1	josephnexus	 why would they update kernel and not distro?
