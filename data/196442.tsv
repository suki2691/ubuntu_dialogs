2008-10-08T04:58:00.000Z	morth_		Could anyone hold my hand with FTP?  im pretty new on it
2008-10-08T04:58:00.000Z	dr_Willis	morth_	 why use ftp at all? ssh and sftp can do most transfers
2008-10-08T04:59:00.000Z	dr_Willis	morth_	 i would read up on ssh, and scp then.. and tell the channel what you are trying to do exactly.
