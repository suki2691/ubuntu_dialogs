2008-08-24T14:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	luckyhell	 you could edit them in gimp and resize them
2008-08-24T14:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	luckyhell	 resize them to be smaller..  and that will make the file size smaller.
2008-08-24T14:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	luckyhell	 gimp is one editor.. theres proberly a dozen ways to do it...
