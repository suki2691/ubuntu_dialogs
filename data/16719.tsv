2011-07-29T23:04:00.000Z	Alec2		hello, i'm looking for a way to change keyboard keys, for example my new laptop has (disgustingly) the function keys (f1-12) as the secondary keys they-ve been replaced by media keys, i'd like to change this, i'd also like to have it so the calculator key links to a different program and such (repost)
