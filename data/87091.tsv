2008-06-23T12:37:00.000Z	pixel683		I'm new to ubuntu (not to linux), but am I right to assume that switching to KDE from a default 8.04 ubuntu install is pretty easy?
2008-06-23T12:37:00.000Z	pixel683		I don't mind a bit of bloat from the gnome stuff right now, although I'd probably remove it eventually.
2008-06-23T12:37:00.000Z	Slart	pixel683	yes..  install the kde-desktop .. or whatever it's called.. and you should be able to change the session at the login prompt
2008-06-23T12:38:00.000Z	pixel683	Slart	OK, and should I expect there to be reasonable amounts of KDE administrative tools, or is that pretty much gnome-only?
