2006-06-10T05:40:00.000Z	adamant1988		Hey can someone tell me why programs installed from the universal and multiverse repos aren't in the addremove program?
2006-06-10T05:41:00.000Z	trippyskippy	adamant1988	 that add/remove is just for the basic supported packages
2006-06-10T05:41:00.000Z	trippyskippy	adamant1988	just use synaptic to add and remove packages not in the base system
2006-06-10T05:42:00.000Z	adamant1988	trippyskippy	so all my other programs will have to be done through synaptic then? so be it. I wish it would add them to the menus upon install though
