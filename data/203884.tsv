2005-12-26T07:49:00.000Z	bz0b		can someone tell me how to get my X server to start on boot?
2005-12-26T07:50:00.000Z	{alejandro}	bz0b	or kdm
2005-12-26T07:50:00.000Z	{alejandro}	bz0b	or if you wanna kick it old school xdm (is that even in the repository?)
2005-12-26T07:51:00.000Z	{alejandro}	bz0b	it doesn't matter whether it is gdm or kdm, honestly
