2010-05-10T21:17:00.000Z	tin_nqn		I'm trying to install 10.04 . As always in the past, I've use the alternate installer passing vga=771 parameter
2010-05-10T21:17:00.000Z	tin_nqn		it fails with 10.04 alternate cd
2010-05-10T21:18:00.000Z	robin0800	tin_nqn	as you have found you can not use that any more
