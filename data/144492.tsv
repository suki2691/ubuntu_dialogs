2008-12-28T11:16:00.000Z	noswears		noob question here, how well does an 8800gt work with ubuntu? are the nvidia drivers still pretty bad?
2008-12-28T11:18:00.000Z	noswears		so would compiz fusion's desktop effects work better with my 8800gt desktop compared to my laptop that has only integrated graphics?
2008-12-28T11:18:00.000Z	crdlb	noswears	what kind of integrated graphics?
2008-12-28T11:20:00.000Z	crdlb	noswears	sure, I guess it'll be faster then. the 965 is more than enough for compiz, but the 945 is perhaps a bit less than ideal
