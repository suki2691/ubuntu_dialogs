2007-04-10T09:48:00.000Z	Flannel	jahpraiseherb	a .deb can be installed locally, yes.  As long as the dependencies and stuff work
2007-04-10T09:51:00.000Z	Flannel	jahpraiseherb	Yes, debian has repositories like ubuntu.  No, they aren't linked (an ubuntu user doesn't use debian repositories).  Binary compatability isn't guarenteed (you can't grab a debian package and install it on ubuntu), but does *sometimes* work.  Purely coincidentally.
