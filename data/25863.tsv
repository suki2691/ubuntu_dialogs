2010-09-22T20:51:00.000Z	jags		I'm trying out gpmc and im not sure how to get it to work, Its trying to connect to localhost, is this designed to pull music off a server and not be its own library?
2010-09-22T20:52:00.000Z	jags		what music player is good for library organization, but runs fast, rhythmbox runs pretty slow on my p4 with compiz on
2010-09-22T20:53:00.000Z	jags		I'll give it a try, It doesn't really matter if an app is kde if I'm using gnome?
