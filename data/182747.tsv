2007-04-28T10:32:00.000Z	foolhardy		thankyou yigal.
2007-04-28T10:33:00.000Z	foolhardy		My question relates to 'apt-get' and my apparent lack of ability to get valid 'sources', I type 'sudo apt-get update' and it goes through a large list of servers but either ignores or errors on them, because of this I cant install many packages I wish
2007-04-28T10:34:00.000Z	Pelo	foolhardy	 did you mess around with your sources list ?  also the servers have had some rough time in the last week because of the upgrade to feisty it might be related
