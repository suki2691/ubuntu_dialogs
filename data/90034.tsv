2008-05-21T12:07:00.000Z	Velio		I have a little problem when shifting between ubuntu and windows,when I want to use ubuntu my screen is 3-4 pixels right and I have to set through monitor settings.When I boot Windows it is opposite :( It's quite stupid to do it every time

2008-05-21T12:08:00.000Z	Velio	SFauconnier	it's the same
