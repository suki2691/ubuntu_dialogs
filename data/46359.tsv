2011-05-15T14:36:00.000Z	HIGHMAN		People, help please! I have the problem: when I'm attach any usb device, all works normal. But when I detach it and attach again(quickly, <2 seconds) ubuntu freezes. Cursor don't move too. Ctrl-alt-F1 and others don't work(seems to freeze all). Ctrl-alt-del don't work too, to fix it I need to push reset button only :(
