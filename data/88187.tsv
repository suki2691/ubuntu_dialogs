2008-06-24T04:17:00.000Z	|Juan|		I have a main user whos session I keep always open. Then I have a second user for anyone else who wants to use the computer. Since I upgraded to Hardy, whenever the second user logs in after my user's session is locked, the second user automatically leaves its session, goes to the gdm screen, re-authenticates and continues with its session while mine is killed. Any help?
