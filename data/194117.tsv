2007-09-11T09:23:00.000Z	keith4_		i'm going to setup an ubuntu box for a windows user.... which version would be most appropriate?
2007-09-11T09:23:00.000Z	keith4_		i don't want to have to support it
2007-09-11T09:23:00.000Z	keith4_		i'm considering 6.06 and 7.04
2007-09-11T09:24:00.000Z	pike_	keith4_	7.04 will be more usable imo
