2012-05-13T21:43:00.000Z	tensorpudding	anon_	what do you mean?
2012-05-13T21:44:00.000Z	tensorpudding	anon_	do what xangua said, you might have to configure input method support if you want to support german typing
2012-05-13T21:44:00.000Z	anon_	tensorpudding	xangua, I prefer the command line as everything is Japanese. I want to have Libre Office in German.
