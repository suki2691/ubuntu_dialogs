2008-01-24T01:51:00.000Z	offload		Does anyone here use Gnome in ubuntu?  I'm trying to figure out why a task i take for granted is missing.  When I want to upload pics I can only see a list view and not a thumbnails view.  Anyone have a solution to this?

2008-01-24T02:05:00.000Z	offload	wyclif	that didn't fix it.  Let me be more detailed.  I'm in firefox, and am in the "FILE UPLOAD" window.  But it only shows lists.  Inside that window there is no ability to choose view as thumbnails.  So I close firefox open a regular folder window and make sure it's set to thumbnails and reopen firefox and still the same thing.  list view only in a file upload window within firefox.
