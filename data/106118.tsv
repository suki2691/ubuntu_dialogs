2008-01-13T02:29:00.000Z	stupid_		i just installed the last ubuntu on my laptop but can't see my wireless card with ifconfig -a
2008-01-13T02:31:00.000Z	dmlb2000	stupid_	what kind of wireless card?
2008-01-13T02:33:00.000Z	stupid_	dmlb2000	but i think it's recognized because I can see the card drivers (these are not free drivers)
