2008-10-20T00:23:00.000Z	BriteLeaf		I just went to this page to try to fix my video resolution... help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto. I put in these commands... sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.custom
2008-10-20T00:24:00.000Z	BriteLeaf		I have done everythiung that site said to fix my video resolution, but the commands it has me do just resets up the keyboard. Any ideas?
2008-10-20T00:25:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	BriteLeaf	may you like to fix your video resolution over "sudo displayconfig-gtk" in an terminal?
2008-10-20T00:29:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	BriteLeaf	okay
