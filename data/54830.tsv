2009-06-09T08:00:00.000Z	The_Frustrated	ha1331_	yes
2009-06-09T08:01:00.000Z	The_Frustrated	ha1331_	100%
2009-06-09T08:02:00.000Z	ha1331_	The_Frustrated	try without any hd present, atleast that way you can force it to boot from cd, atleast on some situations/configurations. You wont achieve the goal, but possibly more information
