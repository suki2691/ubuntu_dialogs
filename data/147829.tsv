2007-01-25T13:13:00.000Z	frogzoo	flutterwings	rm the S*gdm in /etc/rc2.d/ or mv it to K*gdm
2007-01-25T13:15:00.000Z	flutterwings	frogzoo	Umm... I don't want to get rid of /gnome/, just gnome-wm. I've got another wm that will work fine with the rest of gnome.
2007-01-25T13:15:00.000Z	frogzoo	flutterwings	k, dunno
