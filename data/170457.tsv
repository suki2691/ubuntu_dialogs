2007-12-28T09:47:00.000Z	tritium	Xplicit	it's far from pointless.  It keeps the noise down in the channel.
2007-12-28T09:47:00.000Z	Xplicit		id of thought noise was less important than removing help from the channel
2007-12-28T09:48:00.000Z	tritium	Xplicit	we have a code of conduct as well.  He decided to be rude.
