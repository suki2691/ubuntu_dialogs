2008-12-10T23:20:00.000Z	powertool08	MrCollins	cp -hR or something to copy a directory recursively, check with cp --help
2008-12-10T23:21:00.000Z	MrCollins	powertool08	so it would be cp -hR /dir /home/user/dir  ??
2008-12-10T23:22:00.000Z	powertool08	MrCollins	yes, and like hc, probably don't need the h, i just remembered using it at one point but forget what its for
