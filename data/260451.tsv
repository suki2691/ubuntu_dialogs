2009-05-29T05:25:00.000Z	Severian	foolz	I think it has some support.  If I remember right, it may not handle transparency right.
2009-05-29T05:29:00.000Z	Severian	foolz	maybe.  I am sorry I can't be more definite.  I don't run any IE newer than 5.5  And, I have not run that in a while.  So, I am going from memory.  If you are displaying the pngs in IE, then trust your eyes.  Convert them to jpegs if you need ie support.
2009-05-29T07:25:00.000Z	Severian	foolz	using google, I see some css patches that purport to fix png support for IE6.  For example, http://www.twinhelix.com/css/iepngfix/
