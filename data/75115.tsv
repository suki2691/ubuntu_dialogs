2008-11-16T09:15:00.000Z	sanjiro		I installed Ubuntu 8.10 from live cd, I setup my initial user ... now I'm running aptitude and its asking for root.. do I have to setup root seperately? This is odd.
2008-11-16T09:16:00.000Z	sanjiro		ah.. sudo passwd root
2008-11-16T09:17:00.000Z	sanjiro		what's the quickest way to open new terminal?
