2010-12-23T01:16:00.000Z	balloooza	alex88	you can resize the ubuntu partition with the ubuntu live cd and then boot back into ubuntu, and make the new partition, get its uuid, copy over everything in boot with cp -p -r and then add it to your /etc/fstab
2010-12-23T01:16:00.000Z	alex88	balloooza	ok i'll do that..thank you..btw, can't i do all on livecd, then chroot and update grub?
2010-12-23T01:17:00.000Z	balloooza	alex88	I should restate that, since it could ruin your ubuntu if done wrong...
