2008-05-18T12:33:00.000Z	benben	Jordan_U	I am aware of the archive manager's ability to open ISO files. But what i want to do is to have my programs to process the ISO contents.
2008-05-18T12:33:00.000Z	benben	Jordan_U	obviously the easiest way to do so is to lay it out just like a normal file system
2008-05-18T12:34:00.000Z	benben	Jordan_U	but I really don't want to ask the user for root privilege just for accessing the ISO :(
