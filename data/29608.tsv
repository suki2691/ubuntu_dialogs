2010-06-29T23:36:00.000Z	supam	daniel	gdm or any other similar package should help, although you still need to "login" once X starts, there are probably ways to skip that as well
2010-06-29T23:38:00.000Z	supam	daniel	gdm, xdm, kdm, etc depending on which window manager you use
2010-06-29T23:38:00.000Z	supam	daniel	I'd use xdm then
