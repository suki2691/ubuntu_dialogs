2005-07-28T13:27:00.000Z	HappyFool	thespiritoftal	df, on the command line. i think nautilus might tell you too
2005-07-28T14:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	thespiritoftal	run 'file foo.tar.gz' -- it will try to guess what kind of file it is
2005-07-28T14:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	thespiritoftal	maybe it's not gzipped, (i.e., plain tar), in which case, just tar xf foo.tar.gz will work
