2012-05-13T05:09:00.000Z	wildman330		Ok so I changed my GTK theme in ubuntu.  But now I cannot see some of the fonts inside webpages (firefox).  Is there any easy way to adjust this?
2012-05-13T05:10:00.000Z	wildman330		basically in firefox some of the fonts are white on white.  Cant see them.  Basically like when i am responding to a blog post, cant see the fonts I am typing at all

2012-05-13T05:13:00.000Z	wildman330	LinuxMonkey	I know done tried it.  Oh well, guess I will just have to use the default theme.  No way to change it without screwing up fonts
