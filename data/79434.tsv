2009-08-05T03:06:00.000Z	DasEi	baba_b00ie	can't say much to the hardware, try macversion, 4 gig isn't big, maybe try to get rid of unneeded packages
2009-08-05T03:09:00.000Z	DasEi	baba_b00ie	so try with the mac version, just the basic facts macs used to be tougher, and ubu can ran on a 233, too (intel)
