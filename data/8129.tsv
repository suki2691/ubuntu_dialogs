2011-11-02T05:13:00.000Z	friskd	footballsux	i guess the question is. If someone did care about me. What types of issues do i really expose myself to?
2011-11-02T05:14:00.000Z	friskd		Someone would have to basically write some code that generated potential private keys and run them agains the public key to guess it.
2011-11-02T05:15:00.000Z	footballsux	friskd	u can hire a CS degree having person for $5.99 an hour or whatever the minumum wage is to write that code
