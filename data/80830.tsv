2008-09-01T06:49:00.000Z	strategy		I'm moving over from fedora (downloading the ISO right now :D), and i'd like to keep my data. I Hear i just go to custom partitioning and choose to keep the /home partition. Is there anything else i should know?

2008-09-01T06:49:00.000Z	strategy	Flannel	great, thanks. Format everything else, right?
