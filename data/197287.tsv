2006-10-10T07:26:00.000Z	kronos	sethk	i believe that i want to migrate the mailboxes
2006-10-10T07:33:00.000Z	sethk	kronos	that would be imap server specific, so you would have to start there.  It's been months since I did it, and I don't really remember a lot of the specifics.  I have some work stuff to do here; when I get a break I'll see if I have any useful notes from when I installed imap.
