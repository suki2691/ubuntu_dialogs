2009-05-08T22:10:00.000Z	jonz		let me know if there's a better forum for this:
2009-05-08T22:10:00.000Z	jonz		so in OSX each program gets only one entry in the alt-tab menu, no matter how many windows are open..  whereas in windows and linux each window gets its own entry.  In OSX you then switch between windows of a program with alt-~.
2009-05-08T22:10:00.000Z	jonz		is that clear?  is there anyway to emulate the OSX style in Ubuntu?
