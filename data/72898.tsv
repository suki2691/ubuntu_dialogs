2011-04-21T06:36:00.000Z	luckybunny		I've been trying to figure out how to get a dist upgrade to Natty working while I'm using the xorg-edgers ppa
2011-04-21T06:36:00.000Z	luckybunny		if I'm reading right, the way to go about a dist upgrade with xorg-edgers ppa is to first purge and remove the current ppa, perform the upgrade and then add the ppa back, using the one for the new distro
