2006-10-29T06:17:00.000Z	hectorC		anyone knows if there is a way to automount EXT3 partitions in external drives with user writing access?
2006-10-29T06:18:00.000Z	hectorC		variant I know about that option... I was maybe looking for a more "elegant" solution... so I don't hard code a USB drive in fstab
2006-10-29T06:19:00.000Z	hectorC		variant so, is there not a way to configure whatever automounts the disk to do it with user permissions? (udev?)
