2010-03-15T01:17:00.000Z	tempolo		Hi everyone. I am a software developer, having some general trouble with the 64 bit version. Where do I best address my questions, and maybe also make some improvement suggestions about the difficulties I encountered?

When I launched it from Terminal, all I got was "No such file or directory". I think this needs better error msgs
