2009-11-05T03:00:00.000Z	Piranah		OK here is a nice question.  I have ran proftpd for months with no issues. I was away for a cpl days and came back to find the service stoped, Log files showed a pile of attempts to log in from invalid accounts.  It now wont start at all even after re-installing the package
2009-11-05T03:00:00.000Z	Piranah		No error msg's when i issue a restart on it
2009-11-05T03:00:00.000Z	joakim-	Piranah	check what log files the tool has and see what the output is
2009-11-05T03:01:00.000Z	Piranah	joakim-	ya i checked logs are clean. Also checked to make sure nothing had been placed on port 21
