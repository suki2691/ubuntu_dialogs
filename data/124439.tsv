2007-09-08T16:44:00.000Z	KenSentMe	tom17bombadil_	i found it. I just need to run mount share to test if it works
2007-09-08T16:46:00.000Z	tom17bombadil_	KenSentMe	mount share?
2007-09-08T16:46:00.000Z	KenSentMe	tom17bombadil_	like mount /media/documents for the /media/documents mount i added to /etc/fstab
