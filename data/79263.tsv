2008-09-16T11:44:00.000Z	schnoowork		does anyone know at all ?
2008-09-16T11:45:00.000Z	sfer3	schnoowork	They should, but 3g dongles are different things completely.
2008-09-16T11:46:00.000Z	schnoowork	sfer3	yeah i am looking at how to actually get it working. Does it require manual mounting. If so how would i do that :\
