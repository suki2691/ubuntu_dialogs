2010-10-28T21:58:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	pankajm	yes, but imo a fast boot compensates, also don't run polls
2010-10-28T21:59:00.000Z	pankajm	aeon-ltd	how does fast boot account for saved state of apps
2010-10-28T22:00:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	pankajm	it doesn't, but its not for everyone, i don't do elongated processes like rendering or compiling etc
