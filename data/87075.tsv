2008-06-23T20:00:00.000Z	TheStevenTM		Could anybody help me? My graphical environment won't load when I boot Ubuntu.
2008-06-23T20:01:00.000Z	TheStevenTM		No, I'm just running the personal version.
2008-06-23T20:01:00.000Z	TheStevenTM		It usually works. =(
2008-06-23T20:01:00.000Z	TheJames	TheStevenTM	 have you done anything to your video drivers or your xorg configuration file?
