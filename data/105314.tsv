2011-09-08T20:28:00.000Z	Synlu		can someone help me? I would like to burn some linux's iso image on a DVD... can I run those image by boot?
2011-09-08T20:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Synlu	are you downloading the DVD ISO?
2011-09-08T20:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Synlu	I suggest you download and burn the DVD ISO (burn as slowly as possible)
2011-09-08T20:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Synlu	not done it personally, I'd imagine it's different
