2011-12-20T07:55:00.000Z	DaemonWitch		06:54 < DaemonWitch> (like in kde the partion appears at dolphin window unmounted, you click it and its automounted)
2011-12-20T07:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	DaemonWitch	could use /etc/fstab to make it mount at boot
2011-12-20T07:57:00.000Z	DaemonWitch	ActionParsnip	i dont understand why they dont make nautilus or what is it called be able to automount like dolphin.
