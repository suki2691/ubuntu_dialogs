2009-08-09T16:40:00.000Z	Gromph		Hi, I have been using 9.04 for many months without any issues. All of the sudden last night my USB ports stopped working. Then I rebooted and I lost sound *everywhere*. I wiped my hard drive and reinstalled 9.04. However, the same issues still exist.
2009-08-09T16:40:00.000Z	Gromph		Does anyone have any clues as to what my issues could be?
