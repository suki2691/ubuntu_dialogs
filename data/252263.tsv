2007-07-27T13:32:00.000Z	adam_		I am having a problem with my display in ubuntu... For some reason the middle of my screen is blurry and the outsides are fine
2007-07-27T13:33:00.000Z	ali1234	adam_	i doubt that is a software problem
2007-07-27T13:34:00.000Z	ali1234	adam_	define "blurry" - and what type of screen is it?
