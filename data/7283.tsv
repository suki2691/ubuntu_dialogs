2011-12-08T08:53:00.000Z	chamunks	Sid0035	But my server is currently only in pre public release but if you would like to come visit its at. mynickname.com as the ip.
2011-12-08T08:54:00.000Z	chamunks	Sid0035	well by all means please stop by :) as long as you can get java working minecraft has a working linux version which should suffice. there is plenty of documentation on how to make it go.
