2012-05-23T17:59:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander	vlt	thanks, I just found something on that error message in the Forums but not about the "extra" message about the "was it a purely graphical isssue...report to Compiz"
2012-05-23T18:03:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander	vlt	the first window I got looked almost like this on the wiki page here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Apport only that it wasn't the gedit symbol but the ubuntu logo
2012-05-23T18:17:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander	vlt	so my message I got probably was just Apport notifying me of the failure of unity-panel-service?
