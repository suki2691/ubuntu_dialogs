2009-07-08T09:17:00.000Z	derenrich_		so any chance i'll see vlc1.0 in this version of ubuntu?
2009-07-08T09:17:00.000Z	R_YoYo_R	derenrich_	compile it yourself
2009-07-08T09:18:00.000Z	derenrich_	R_YoYo_R	i'm considering it, but I don't want the package to update later and that to conflict with my install and such
2009-07-08T09:18:00.000Z	R_YoYo_R	derenrich_	just pay attention to the updates. keep the source and uninstall when the new one is available
