2009-05-15T01:44:00.000Z	kirlyin		I'm trying to install the drivers for a nvidia fx 5700 ve (which ubuntu 9.10 recognizes, even recognized it during the demo of ubuntu before i installed it), now that i installed it (lets me choose between windows and ubuntu), it still recognized the video card but won't install it...what happened?

2009-05-15T01:47:00.000Z	ehs1	kirlyin	yes, but you might wanna check envy's site. just google envy ubuntu, you'll find it :)
