2007-10-22T03:59:00.000Z	casey_		I just found out there is a "Xubuntu".  Is there anything specific about it that would make me want it?
2007-10-22T04:00:00.000Z	casey_		Fryguy: do I just use apt-get and install xfce if I would want to?  is it very different from GNOME?
2007-10-22T04:02:00.000Z	astro76	casey_	xfce is much more lightweight and much less featured than gnome or kde, it's usually only used by people with low-spec systems
2007-10-22T04:02:00.000Z	casey_	astro76	so basically it isnt as pretty as GNOME or KDE?
