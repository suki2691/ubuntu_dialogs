2006-04-27T07:14:00.000Z	avr		hi! where do i get a list of official repositories for ubuntu which have the latest packages? kind of like debian unstable...
2006-04-27T07:16:00.000Z	Warbo	avr	Dapper (same as your breezy ones but with dapper instead of breezy)
2006-04-27T07:17:00.000Z	avr	Warbo	thanks, but i dont want to upgrade to dapper.. i just want to know which lines to add to sources.lst for getting the latest packages.
2006-04-27T07:17:00.000Z	Warbo	avr	Dapper has the latest. The sources.list lines are the same as breezy but replace "breezy" with "dapper". If you don't want to upgrade then don't add them to your sources
