2010-03-01T21:07:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss		After installing Ubuntu 9.10 os-prober didn't detect my Vista partition and add a menu entry in GRUB. I  suspect it's because Windows can't be mounted, even in read-only mode because the OS wasn't shut down properly the last time it was used. I have tried adding an entry manually, but when I boot my PC GRUB doesn't display a menu and boots to the first menu entry. Can anybody help?
