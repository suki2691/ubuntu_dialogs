2010-05-15T21:23:00.000Z	johann		I would like to mount permanently a SSH connexion but I am not sure how to proceed. Can someone help me?
2010-05-15T21:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	johann	 thats doable via sshfs. if you mean mount a remote box to a local directory
2010-05-15T21:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	johann	 read up on sshfs and examples of usng it from fstab
