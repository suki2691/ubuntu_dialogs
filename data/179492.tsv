2012-09-20T06:24:00.000Z	Richard_Cavell		I'm on 10.04 and I see there's a Linux kernel update.  Is it normal to have updates 2 years after the release of the distro?
2012-09-20T06:24:00.000Z	Richard_Cavell		So does 10.04 have the leading edge kernel or is it some way behind?
2012-09-20T06:24:00.000Z	jrib	Richard_Cavell	10.04 is supported for 3 years on the desktop and 5 years on the server.  If there are security issues for supported packages, then there will be an update (see !sru for details)
2012-09-20T06:28:00.000Z	jrib	Richard_Cavell	read the changelog and see if it's worth it in your case then
