2006-06-30T10:47:00.000Z	tct		can I upgrade the packages in ubuntu by editing /etc/apt/sources.list to point to the debian testing packages?
2006-06-30T10:48:00.000Z	bimberi	tct	no, that's probably going to break your system
2006-06-30T10:49:00.000Z	bimberi	tct	and if you're on dapper you'll have mostly later versions than debian testing anyway
2006-06-30T10:49:00.000Z	tct	bimberi	: so how do I goabout upgrading it to testing?
