2008-12-04T02:17:00.000Z	rlt		Hola everyone. I'm currently running intrepid, but there's a couple of packages from jaunty universe that I'd like to use (specifically, boinc-manager and its deps). I know that this isn't a Good Idea, but don't know the potential problems that might result; anyone feel like educating me?
2008-12-04T02:18:00.000Z	enzotib	rlt	why don't you feel good with the ones in intrepid repos?
2008-12-04T02:20:00.000Z	rlt	enzotib	the version of BOINC included in intrepid-release is a prerelease developer version. The version in jaunty-release is an actual released version. That's what I gather from https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/boinc , anyway.
2008-12-04T02:20:00.000Z	rlt	enzotib	well, that page and the fact that boinc-manager in intrepid has "(Pre-release)" plastered all over it.
