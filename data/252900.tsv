2005-01-18T15:57:00.000Z	Corkasus		I'm about to try burning Ubuntu to a CD-R.. should I tone it down from 24X just to be safe?
2005-01-18T15:58:00.000Z	Corkasus		only goes up to 24x :(
2005-01-18T15:59:00.000Z	Corkasus		Okay.. I ask because I've already wasted 7 CD-R's on Knoppix or Fedora installs that failed, and I don't know why they failed..
