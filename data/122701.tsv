2009-09-12T06:23:00.000Z	Chriswaterguy		hi - looking for install help. I'm installing Crunchbang 8.10 which is Ubuntu-based (a temporary install - I know it and have the disk handy).
2009-09-12T06:23:00.000Z	Chriswaterguy		When I get to "Prepare Partitions" the list is empty and the buttons underneath are greyed out. yet if I run gparted, it detects my partitions no problem. Ideas?

2009-09-12T06:29:00.000Z	Chriswaterguy	sebsebseb	I know - Crunchbang is really Ubuntu with a different desktop.
