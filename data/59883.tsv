2009-04-21T22:13:00.000Z	konam		i downloaded a dvd and it was a folder with the video_ts and audio_ts folders... can i burn them like that and my dvd will recognize it or is there an app in ubuntu that i need to use first?

2009-04-21T22:14:00.000Z	konam	JackWat	ActionParsnip i ask because in some forums they talk about authorizing the dvd first even when I have those two folders
