2005-10-20T09:46:00.000Z	LazyAngel		hi! i'm running a process in a terminal window. It takes a very long time, and it writes the output to a file. Now i need to restart the x server. How can i let the process run in the background? i tried "ctrl+z" then "bg 1" but when i close the windows, the process will stop anyway...
