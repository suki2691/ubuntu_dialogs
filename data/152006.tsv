2009-02-16T04:37:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	tranceparance	I know you can configure it to split one sound card into several virtual devices, and combine multiple devices into one virtual device. I think you need the latter
2009-02-16T04:37:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	tranceparance	I'd say search for advanced ALSA configuration guides
