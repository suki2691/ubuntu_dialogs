2009-03-16T05:21:00.000Z	Jackaruto		Would someone please be so kind and to explain to me one more time why I canâ€™t log on via vnc to the desktop unless someone is actually logged on to tty7. When the server is hundreds of miles away it is not always possible to get someone to drag a KVM switch over to the rack and log in just so I can use the gui for a few minutes. Is there a cheat to get around this?

2009-03-16T05:24:00.000Z	Jackaruto	_Whipper	point the way kind sir
2009-03-16T05:25:00.000Z	_Whipper	Jackaruto	: i dont do know much about anything.. but i know google does :)
