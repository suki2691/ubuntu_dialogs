2007-04-25T10:18:00.000Z	John		I read in the Ubuntu forum that I could run Shockwave by installing Firefox and Shockwave in wine. Is this the right place to ask a few questions about that?
2007-04-25T10:18:00.000Z	bruenig	John	yes
2007-04-25T10:20:00.000Z	bruenig	John	what did you do exactly, did you download the firefox.exe to the desktop and then wine it or what
2007-04-25T10:21:00.000Z	bruenig	John	right so you cd ~/Desktop, and then wine firefox.exe and then what
