2011-11-10T14:15:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk		How can I have the rights to write to a usb hard drive ?
2011-11-10T14:16:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk		is it by creating a folder named like the device and owning it ?

2011-11-10T14:19:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk	auronandace	well, it worked like this for me too but I created a new partition table and the partition is mounted as root
