2007-06-09T14:04:00.000Z	aamy		hi, total newbie. just downloaded the latest release of ubuntu and running off of the live cd. Before installing on my hard drive, i want to make sure my multiple monitor (3) setup will work with ubuntu. Right now only one monitor is active. How do I get the others to come on?
