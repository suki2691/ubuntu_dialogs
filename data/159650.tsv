2007-06-09T16:26:00.000Z	frank_b		I get some horizontal lines when watching .vob video files. does anyone know if it's a codec problem or a linux ati driver problem?
2007-06-09T16:27:00.000Z	gonzoism	frank_b	you might try changing the output or display setting.  like the xv or opengl option
2007-06-09T16:28:00.000Z	frank_b	gonzoism	hmm, ok. I get the problem also in totem. can I change that in totem also?
2007-06-09T16:29:00.000Z	frank_b	gonzoism	I'll look for that in totem also. thank you very much for your help :)
