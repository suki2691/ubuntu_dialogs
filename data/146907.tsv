2007-08-04T15:20:00.000Z	davetarmac		I've dual booted ubuntu with vista and I want to access a file from my windows drive. I can see everything with no trouble, but in Terminal - how do I get it to go to a dir with spaces in it?
2007-08-04T15:20:00.000Z	RyanT5000	davetarmac	put a backslash before each space
2007-08-04T15:20:00.000Z	RyanT5000	davetarmac	or put the entire filename in quotes
