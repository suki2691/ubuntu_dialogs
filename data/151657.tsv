2007-02-24T09:30:00.000Z	Turgon		Is there a way to change Ubuntu's sensibility to the scrolling of the mouse's wheel? Thanks.
2007-02-24T09:31:00.000Z	AndrewB	Turgon	yeah. Preferneces -> Mouse.
2007-02-24T09:32:00.000Z	Turgon	AndrewB	: thanks but I don't have that option (I use Edgy)
2007-02-24T09:32:00.000Z	AndrewB	Turgon	should have it somewhere still..
