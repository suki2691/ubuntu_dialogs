2012-04-03T23:47:00.000Z	Sharkfin		I'm a total n00b to linux and need a bit of advice
2012-04-03T23:48:00.000Z	Sharkfin		I need to start learning Linux for my IT degree. I managed to scrape together a rather old system. Specs are as follows: Intel Celeron 2.4 GHz single core, 512 MB RAM, will this be enough to run Ubuntu?
