2012-06-11T14:20:00.000Z	wdp	Dr_Willis	different stuff. welcome to multitasking :) a calculator here, a compile there, a chrooted environment there, a few man pages there, some vim here.. it sums up. Probably i should start using screen, but somehow i don't like it
2012-06-11T14:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	wdp	 been multitasking on my amiga since the 80's ;)
2012-06-11T14:23:00.000Z	wdp	Dr_Willis	heh. My first box was an 80286. been 8 years old. 97' i've been the first time on internet, which is where i heard about linux. I think 99' or 00' i had my first tries using linux. in 03' i became a developer for a source based linux distribution, and now i'm taking a look at ubuntu for a few days - because i need some stuff fast, and source based doesn't give me that.
