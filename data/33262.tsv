2010-09-24T22:11:00.000Z	coal		anyone? tried using WINE for some things. Executable bit rule cannot be circumvented. Need one way or another to use these files
2010-09-24T22:12:00.000Z	Loshki	coal	can you say more about the actual problem you're trying to solve?
2010-09-24T22:16:00.000Z	Loshki	coal	maybe you need help from #winehq ?
