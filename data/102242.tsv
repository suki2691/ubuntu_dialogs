2009-02-27T07:11:00.000Z	bartek		Like my most recent one updated the flash player package, so Im curious what this did
2009-02-27T07:11:00.000Z	rww	bartek	I think update manager shows that usually. There's also the package apt-listchanges, which might help.
2009-02-27T07:13:00.000Z	rww	bartek	oh, yeah. If you locate the package on packages.ubuntu.com, there's a link to the changelog on the right side of the package details page
