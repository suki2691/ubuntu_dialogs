2009-11-12T12:46:00.000Z	BDOTH	joerack	having the same problem you are with my Dads computer. Firefox loads web pages and youtube a lot slower then before.
2009-11-12T12:46:00.000Z	joerack	BDOTH	can it be the video driver?
2009-11-12T12:48:00.000Z	BDOTH	joerack	no it's not the video driver. The new version of Ubuntu consumes more resources then the previous one. It can make single core processors lag a bit. I've narrowed that much down. Also Firefox 3.6 will come out soon in December that will put more speed back into it, so have some patience.
