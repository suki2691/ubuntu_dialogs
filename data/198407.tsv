2011-04-29T21:48:00.000Z	Nyromith		Hello. I didn't like unity and want to migrate to xubuntu (several computers). Is there a possibility that Canonical will drop the support for xubuntu because it's not popular?
2011-04-29T21:50:00.000Z	cablop	Nyromith	afaik xubuntu didn't have the support that gnome orkade had, so... i suggest you to use classic ubuntu instead, it is gnome, but gnome works so nice in a netbook

2011-04-29T21:52:00.000Z	cablop	Nyromith	I'm running Ubuntu 10.10 on a Compaq Mini netbook with compiz enabled and classic interface, able o launch a Virtualbox with Windows XP on it and using the whole hard drive encrypted, performance is nice
