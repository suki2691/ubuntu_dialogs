2007-10-19T01:46:00.000Z	GoldChaos		Hello there! Quick question, easy one at that.
2007-10-19T01:47:00.000Z	GoldChaos		if I'm running the RC of Gutsy, is there a need to try and upgrade to the final? Will it automatically do that - will it even appear on the Update Manager?
2007-10-19T01:47:00.000Z	GoldChaos		Or will it not and just install normal updates as usual?
2007-10-19T01:47:00.000Z	sparrw	GoldChaos	youll see new updates, but not a new distro
