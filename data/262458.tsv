2005-05-25T16:55:00.000Z	SatanCow		is there anyone available to give me a bit of help? I am getting an error that dose not make sense to me
2005-05-25T16:56:00.000Z	SatanCow		it says "I've detected a panel already running, and will now exit.
2005-05-25T16:56:00.000Z	SatanCow		but that's all it says and there's no extra info
2005-05-25T16:56:00.000Z	Blissex	SatanCow	I suggest reading this: http://WWW.sabi.co.UK/Notes/linuxHelpAsk.html as to asking better questions.
