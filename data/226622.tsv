2006-08-21T13:55:00.000Z	Omni|Work		The Mercurial package shipped with Ubuntu is horribly old.  And even if it weren't, I sometimes do development work with Mercurial.  So, I would very much like to be able to create my own Mercurial packages.
2006-08-21T13:56:00.000Z	Omni|Work		Is there a guide somewhere with some simple steps for taking an existing .deb file + source code and creating a new package with the new source code?
