2010-11-09T22:26:00.000Z	pmitros		Is it possible to do an upgrade of Ubuntu in steps? I'd like to download the relevant files from one location (where I have fast internet), but actually install them from a second location (where I expect to have time).

2010-11-09T22:28:00.000Z	pmitros	ffl	Not a bad idea. I'd need to get an external CD drive, or actually, maybe I can just mount the .iso.
2010-11-09T22:28:00.000Z	pmitros	ffl	I'll poke at that.
