2010-08-12T06:10:00.000Z	biodegabriel		Hey Everyone, How do I find out if my filesystem has 'no exec' on it? Is there a command or something to see that?
2010-08-12T06:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	biodegabriel	 check the mount command and what it says about the filesystem in question
2010-08-12T06:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		rebirth you hit the shift key BEFOR you would see that loading screen
2010-08-12T06:12:00.000Z	biodegabriel	Dr_Willis	THX
