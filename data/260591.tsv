2005-04-13T15:56:00.000Z	jhaig		Just installed Ubuntu (4.1) for the first time.  It seems that I have managed to get an 'April Fool' special edition - I thought the login image was a bit odd but didn't realise until I changed it.  Anyway, are there any other April Fool's surprises?  Also, if I keep this CD, will be be worth vast sums of money in the future as a collectors item?  ;-)
