2006-08-16T10:43:00.000Z	VileChild		I have one more question for all of you :), it's recently come to my attention that I live beside multiple neighbourhood hot spots and was wondering how Ubuntu wil handle wireless? That's basically my only form of an internet connection in my room

2006-08-16T10:45:00.000Z	VileChild	junaid	So should I buy any specific type of wireless card? I'm pretty sure the wireless routers will be compatible, they work with my brothers laptop and my nintendo ds as well
