2010-07-14T07:59:00.000Z	Melectric|Matt		Hi, I'm having an issue with installing Ubuntu 10.04, when I choose to install, my screen goes to an aquamarine/greenish colour
2010-07-14T08:00:00.000Z	Melectric|Matt		I get the same problem with installing 32bit or 64, a CD or from USB
2010-07-14T08:00:00.000Z	_genuser1	Melectric|Matt	has it been giving you lot of issues?
2010-07-14T08:03:00.000Z	_genuser1	Melectric|Matt	does it boot at all into the ubuntu installer?
