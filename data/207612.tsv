2005-11-16T11:51:00.000Z	|rt|_	blackhat	yes but you need to defrag your ntfs valume first
2005-11-16T11:51:00.000Z	|rt|_	blackhat	qtparted or gparted should then be able to resize the filesystem
2005-11-16T11:54:00.000Z	|rt|_	blackhat	i believe there is a command line tool to do it if qtparted is refusing to do it
