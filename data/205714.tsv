2008-08-27T12:43:00.000Z	alistair_	richard	can I go driver=vga ???
2008-08-27T12:44:00.000Z	alistair_	richard	I did try using the grub on boot and assigned vga=876 but that didnt do anything useful resolution stayed the same
2008-08-27T12:45:00.000Z	alistair_	richard	Ill go edit it and try again. Im not sure its a fairly old beast but was working with higher resolution before I changed the memory which checks out ok
