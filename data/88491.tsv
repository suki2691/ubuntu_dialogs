2008-07-11T20:46:00.000Z	ChoboMog		Does anyone know how powerfull a graphics card it takes to run Compiz at 1080p?
2008-07-11T20:47:00.000Z	ChoboMog		okay
2008-07-11T20:48:00.000Z	ChoboMog		I'm currently using a radeon 9200/p4 3ghz, which can run 720p playback without issue, but I wasn't sure how intensive compiz would be compared to that
