2011-07-17T15:22:00.000Z	Flynsarmy		I typed 'uptime' and it says '6 users'. I'm the only user on this laptop - shoudl I be concerned?
2011-07-17T15:23:00.000Z	oCean	Flynsarmy	no, open a new terminal, and run uptime again, you'll have 7 users
2011-07-17T15:24:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	oCean	oh cool - why is that exactly?
2011-07-17T15:24:00.000Z	oCean	Flynsarmy	as Tomoka pointed out, run 'who' or 'w' in a terminal (no quotes) - it's just your sessions
