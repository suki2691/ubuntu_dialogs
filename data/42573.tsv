2011-02-15T05:15:00.000Z	eross		i'm going to install 10.10 onto a harddrive and am backing up. question is, it is ext3 from an old install and i find i have to reformat for ext4 and is recommended. Does ext4 read ext3 and winxp paritions? Will I have to reformat again for the next greatest filesystem? Or can I partition the ext3 to have a ext4 without deleting the contents of the harddrive?
