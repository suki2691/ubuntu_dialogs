2012-05-08T00:17:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	bobk	running 10.04 without updates is not safe after a while.
2012-05-08T00:19:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	bobk	12.04 still contains a few bugs, but nothing that will break my system.
2012-05-08T00:19:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	bobk	I only upgraded today. I did have some upgrade issues, but they were minor and most of them were easy to fix.
