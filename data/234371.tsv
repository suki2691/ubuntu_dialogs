2005-11-09T13:27:00.000Z	iceman	FarrisG	full 64 bit, but issues to use 32 bit apps there ways to run them, but gets complex
2005-11-09T13:28:00.000Z	FarrisG	iceman	Regarding 32but binaries, any more issues with Ubuntu than any other 64 bit OS?
2005-11-09T13:29:00.000Z	iceman	FarrisG	Seem 64 bit is awsome, I went back to 32 bit rather than fight the bootstapping to get 32 bit to work in 64 bit
