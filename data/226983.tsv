2007-12-17T04:44:00.000Z	astro76	mame	perhaps you could pick one and fix it instead
2007-12-17T04:48:00.000Z	mame	astro76	Is there a place to upload such ideas?
2007-12-17T04:50:00.000Z	astro76	mame	probably some gaming forum... I don't really see you having much luck... probably better to see if you can convince an existing front-end author to implement your suggestions
