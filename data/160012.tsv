2006-11-09T08:15:00.000Z	eobanb	powercat	32 is the same as 24.  32 is just 24 with 8 bits of alpha channel
2006-11-09T08:17:00.000Z	powercat	eobanb	But when I try to use beryl, I get this error in the console: beryl: No GLXFBConfig for depth 32
2006-11-09T08:17:00.000Z	powercat	eobanb	And I don't see any borders to my windows
