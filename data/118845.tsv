2009-10-23T10:00:00.000Z	seetherM		I downloaded ubuntu and installed it but it didnt install drivers for my gforce 210 (nvidia) can anyone point me in the right direction?
2009-10-23T10:01:00.000Z	bazhang	seetherM	is there anything in hardware drivers (system administration hardware drivers)
2009-10-23T10:05:00.000Z	bazhang	seetherM	this is an older card?
2009-10-23T10:11:00.000Z	bazhang	seetherM	I'm not familiar with that card, its odd that there is nothing in hardware drivers for it
