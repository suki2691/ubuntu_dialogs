2007-11-14T21:44:00.000Z	Baneblade		anyone help me with WINE on a 64bit AMD? Have installed it, but when i right-click, "Open program using WINE" nothing happens.. any ideas?
2007-11-14T21:45:00.000Z	mavi-	Baneblade	open a terminal and type "wine program.exe"
2007-11-14T21:45:00.000Z	mavi-	Baneblade	and look at the output
2007-11-14T21:47:00.000Z	mavi-	Baneblade	check with "file `which wine`" that its compiled for 64bit
