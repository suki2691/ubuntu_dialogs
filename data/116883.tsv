2008-08-30T21:36:00.000Z	Lunis		how about this.. is there a kernel parameter to disable ACPI Trip points or ACPI in general, so I can attempt to debug the machine?
2008-08-30T21:36:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Lunis	noacpi on your kernel line in menu.lst?
2008-08-30T21:37:00.000Z	Lunis	LSD|Ninja	I believe that's what I'm looking for, thank you
2008-08-30T21:39:00.000Z	Lunis	LSD|Ninja	strangely enough, devs closed a bug related to my situation saying to use 2.6.27
