2007-07-24T12:52:00.000Z	tupa		Hey I just noticed Ubuntu not having alsaconf (debian has it), then, how do I configure the sound in Ubuntu?
2007-07-24T12:53:00.000Z	Frogzoo	tupa	sound -> volume control
2007-07-24T12:53:00.000Z	tupa	Frogzoo	-_-, alsa !! not sound itself
2007-07-24T12:54:00.000Z	Frogzoo	tupa	same options as alsamixer if you care to look
