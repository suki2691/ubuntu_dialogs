2012-04-26T22:25:00.000Z	c3l_		how hard is it to use multiple graphics cards? (I need more screen outputs.) are there any requirements on the graphics cards, or can I pick two arbitrarily? ie. will an ati card work with a nvidia card?
2012-04-26T22:25:00.000Z	RobinJ1995	c3l_	ati + nvidia = no go
2012-04-26T22:25:00.000Z	RobinJ1995	c3l_	even only ati is a no-go :')
2012-04-26T22:26:00.000Z	c3l_	RobinJ1995	so what is required to use several graphics cards?
