2009-12-25T16:41:00.000Z	chadi		after I updated my ubuntu, when I boot my computer, grub shows: GRUB _ < with this underscore turning on and off and it hangs. What's wrong? I can't do anything now :/ Please help me guys, I am unable to access any OS!
2009-12-25T16:41:00.000Z	chadi		yeah
2009-12-25T16:43:00.000Z	chadi		puffs how can I explain more? it's not a system crash, it's a grub failure apparently
