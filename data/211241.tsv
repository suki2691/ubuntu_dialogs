2005-12-03T12:50:00.000Z	nick01		I can't use that update tool- it doesn't fit on screen at 800x600 :(
2005-12-03T12:51:00.000Z	nick01		any way to make it install the updates ?
2005-12-03T12:52:00.000Z	ecobuntu	nick01	you could use the terminal and type sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
2005-12-03T12:52:00.000Z	ecobuntu	nick01	you could also try to shrink the window
