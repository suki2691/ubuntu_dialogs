2008-03-30T07:23:00.000Z	Lazarus		I have a question regarding VNC: I installed 8.04 on a PC, and I can vnc into the machine to "share" the desktop with the logged on user; but I want to be able to VNC into an entirely new session...so two people can use the computer at the same time.
2008-03-30T07:23:00.000Z	Lazarus		I've found a variety of "how to's" on the web, but can't get them to work...either get a bunch of errors, or I can connect, but I just get a grey screen with the X cursor.
2008-03-30T07:23:00.000Z	Lazarus		Since this is a busy forum, I'd be grateful for a privat message chat to discuss this.
