2009-11-02T08:53:00.000Z	SJrX		What packages should I install for c development
2009-11-02T08:53:00.000Z	Izinucs	SJrX	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2009-11-02T08:54:00.000Z	SJrX	Izinucs	 is there anything else, I'm specifically trying to compile for ia32 but am getting an error during linking: http://codepad.org/3I3w6fNZ
2009-11-02T08:55:00.000Z	Izinucs	SJrX	sorry.. I'm just aware of build-essential.. you'll need the linux headers for your kernel as well I believe.. but that's the end of my knowledge ..sorry
