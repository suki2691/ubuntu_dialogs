2010-09-20T03:58:00.000Z	steves		I have two raid drives that were on a system that failed badly.  So I am moving them over to a different system to get the drives back online.
2010-09-20T03:59:00.000Z	steves		When I try and assemble them I get an error stateing that sdb1 is busy _and_ that the there isn't a supperblock.  Does anyone know how to add drives to a system?
2010-09-20T04:00:00.000Z	OerHeks	steves	maybe the superblock is damaged, you said it had problems allready ?
2010-09-20T04:12:00.000Z	steves	OerHeks	  If the superblock is bad is my data unreachable or is there a way to rebuild (assemble) the array and access my data?
