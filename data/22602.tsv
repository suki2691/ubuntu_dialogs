2011-01-12T02:03:00.000Z	cragdor		Whats the correct channel for an issue with NVidia Binary Driver and 10.10, i have a GTS250, which is apparently not supported
2011-01-12T02:03:00.000Z	hi5	cragdor	you card HAS to be supported
2011-01-12T02:04:00.000Z	hi5	cragdor	if i were i would try maybe the 10.04 version with a live cd and see if working
2011-01-12T02:06:00.000Z	cragdor	hi5	Not that old..... Ubuntu 10.04 worked great but was a pain in the *** to install due to fake raid, this has only happened since upgrading to 10.10
