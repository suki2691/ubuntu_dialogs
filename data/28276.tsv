2010-07-27T17:45:00.000Z	MikeChelen		can anyone recommend a gui for webcam recording? a middle ground between cheese (too simple) and vlc (too complex) would be great
2010-07-27T17:47:00.000Z	cypher-neo	MikeChelen	have you tried mencoder?
2010-07-27T17:48:00.000Z	MikeChelen	cypher-neo	is there a gui for mencoder? been using it from command line, but too unknowledgeable to get desired results
2010-07-27T17:48:00.000Z	cypher-neo	MikeChelen	AFAIK, it's strictly command line.
