2011-06-05T20:42:00.000Z	judget		ok so then maybe i should inquire at the postfix channel?
2011-06-05T20:43:00.000Z	judget		ok well I am happy to follow any suggestions. I have been trying to figure this out for several days
2011-06-05T20:44:00.000Z	th0r	judget	do you have the latest mysql installed? might be that the latest postfix requires the latest mysql for those modules mentioned earlier
