2009-03-23T04:17:00.000Z	Drknezz		Why some entries in my repo list are commented out? "Line commented out by installer because it failed to verify:", even when they are ubuntu-security
2009-03-23T04:18:00.000Z	Flannel	Drknezz	Because when you installed, you didn't have internet access to verify that they were up.  You should uncomment them.
2009-03-23T04:18:00.000Z	Drknezz	Flannel	ok, thx
