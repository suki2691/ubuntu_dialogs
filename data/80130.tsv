2010-12-28T19:05:00.000Z	needhelp1		im having an issue installing ubuntu 10.10 from any medium, i have tried a cdr, usb, unetbootin and startup disk creator. I have checked the md5 many times its right, i keep getting stuck on the same line of code that states "Kernel_thread_helper 0x6/0x10" and it will not drop into a cli. Can anyone help me
