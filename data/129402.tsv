2007-06-30T16:16:00.000Z	|Carrera	jhakk	you can add any source to the source list as long as you have the correct address
2007-06-30T16:17:00.000Z	jhakk	|Carrera	obviously :) I was just wondering why there were these convoluted instructions under "Adding Repositories" here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu
