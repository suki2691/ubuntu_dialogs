2010-04-22T15:53:00.000Z	Ben201		im looking for a simple network static ip change utility
2010-04-22T15:54:00.000Z	hateball	Ben201	You can do that with network-manager
2010-04-22T15:55:00.000Z	hateball	Ben201	Yes, it will. You can even set up different profiles, if you'd like to change between different sets of static IP's
