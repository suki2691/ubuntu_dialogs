2011-02-22T04:03:00.000Z	Stew_822		I was wondering how can I change the program that starts when I use a shortcut (to a directory) in gnome-do, the current program is chrome, and that isn't really all that great for browsing through my files :P

2011-02-22T04:05:00.000Z	Stew_822	brontoeee	okay cool thanks :). It looks terrible on my LXDE desktop anyway :P
