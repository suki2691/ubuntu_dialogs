2007-11-16T17:42:00.000Z	H-Town		what's the easiest way to format my harddrive and delete everything under ubuntu?
2007-11-16T17:43:00.000Z	H-Town		i mean completely wipe clean my hard drive
2007-11-16T17:44:00.000Z	H-Town		i've already tried putting in my vista cd but it seems that ubuntu has a firm grip on things
