2009-09-16T06:31:00.000Z	rhsanborn		I had an existing 9.04 install on my laptop. I ran the installer and installed a fresh 8.10 install on an external HD. It looks like it overwrote my existing boot loader on the primary HD to point to the /boot partition on the external HD. How do I write the bootloader to point to the original, internal hd?
