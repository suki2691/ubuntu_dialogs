2010-07-15T14:19:00.000Z	Gryllida		rage2, why do you want to change the /etc/resolv.conf  ?
2010-07-15T14:19:00.000Z	rage2	Gryllida	because it keeps putting in my router's IP, and that causes pages to not load
2010-07-15T14:20:00.000Z	Gryllida	rage2	what do you want to put instead, what do you expect it to do
2010-07-15T14:21:00.000Z	rage2	Gryllida	I know my ISP's DNS servers.. I'm putting them in manually to avoid the connection problems created by having my router's address in there
