2007-03-18T06:11:00.000Z	Pollywog	linuxnewbie755	try googling Linux and charter in a search
2007-03-18T06:19:00.000Z	Pollywog	linuxnewbie755	I found that Charter uses DHCP, did you specify that in your settings?
2007-03-18T06:20:00.000Z	Pollywog	linuxnewbie755	the other thing is did you specify nameservers in /etc/resolv.conf ?
