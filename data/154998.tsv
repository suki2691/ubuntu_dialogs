2007-05-27T15:00:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008		oh man this frustrating!!!  I can't do any administrative tasks from from Xfce/Xubuntu, because it keeps saying "Enter your password for administrative tasks"  I give it my root password, which WORKS GREAT by the way inside a terminal using SU or SUDO, but it won't accept it in the GUI
2007-05-27T15:00:00.000Z	Clarrisa_2008		please help anyone?
