2006-08-11T16:07:00.000Z	Flannel	IAskew	doesn't matter.  Do you want a graphical or textmode installation?
2006-08-11T16:07:00.000Z	Flannel	IAskew	they both install the same packages
2006-08-11T16:08:00.000Z	Flannel	IAskew	alternate ISO provides more control/options (and not having towait for the live CD to boot first), desktop provides click based installation
