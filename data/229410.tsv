2006-07-25T15:37:00.000Z	comtech_		Hi, I've got dapper installed on a p4 1.8/512 machine with a hard drive that passes tests in smartmontools. My load is ridiculous though, I am hitting 5.00 load by web browsing and having 5 bittorrents open.  Xorg has used like 120 minutes of cpu time in the day it's been powered on, and it is constantly using between 15 and 25% depending what I do. please advise me
2006-07-25T15:39:00.000Z	comtech_		I have a similarly spec'd laptop that runs WAY better
2006-07-25T15:39:00.000Z	comtech_		runs great actually
2006-07-25T15:39:00.000Z	Spec	comtech_	yeah, my laptop runs waay better too.
