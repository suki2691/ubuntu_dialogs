2010-10-20T12:34:00.000Z	ABGD		Hi folks. I am having a weird issue on 10.04 LTS, sometimes when I leave my computer on overnight or more than 16hours+ and I get back on my computer, my screen is just black (looks like command line) there is just an underscore _ and pressing keyboard does nothing to get me back to login screen. Does anybody have an inkling as to why this is happening?
