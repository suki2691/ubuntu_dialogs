2011-09-11T23:05:00.000Z	alkafoo	lockheed	do you want to read these files often, or just once?
2011-09-11T23:06:00.000Z	alkafoo	lockheed	fermulator's suggestion is good for one offs, for long term I'd suggest http://www.ext2fsd.com/
2011-09-11T23:29:00.000Z	alkafoo	lockheed	was probably ext4, then
2011-09-11T23:35:00.000Z	alkafoo	lockheed	if it's ext4, I'm not sure there is if ext2fsd can't do it
