2012-03-11T16:16:00.000Z	Osmond		When i boot up I have to enter the grub menu, hit E on the kernel, and edit that text.  Where do I find that file once I'm logged on? I would like to make the changed permanent
2012-03-11T16:16:00.000Z	szal	Osmond	what change exactly?

2012-03-11T16:20:00.000Z	szal	Osmond	iirc, yes
