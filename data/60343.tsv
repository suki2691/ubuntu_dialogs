2009-08-31T06:22:00.000Z	Guest36562		Can someone tell me what software I may be missing??  I want to play yahoo chess and after logging on, I get the smaller rooms window with a grey advertising bar with a grey arrow in a circle, a white window and the bottom infor bar saying   transferring data from games.yahoo.com...      and thats all that happens for the longest now..
