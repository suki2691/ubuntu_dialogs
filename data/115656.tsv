2007-10-22T02:09:00.000Z	Clinton__	Tranto1	thank you for offering to help.  It is a desktop.
2007-10-22T02:11:00.000Z	Tranto1	Clinton__	I have a laptop and my problem was that, with 6.2.20 kernel, it was always running at the maximum speed, so 'On demand' mode was not working. It was a bug, and in 6.2.22 it was solved. it was related with some specific models of laptops, including my sony vaio. But you use a desktop... don't know if this has something to do with your problem
