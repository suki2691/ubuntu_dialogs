2007-08-13T09:38:00.000Z	theonlyalt		I have an Intel Core 2 Duo and I'm not entirely sure both cores are being utilized. How can I check this?
2007-08-13T09:40:00.000Z	palintheus	theonlyalt	you can add the applet to the top panel that monitors cpu throttling and when you right click and select preferences it should have the option to pick which cpu to monitor, if it does both cores are usd
2007-08-13T09:43:00.000Z	theonlyalt	palintheus	thanks. I can select between the two! So linux automatically takes advantage of both cores, right?
2007-08-13T09:44:00.000Z	palintheus	theonlyalt	yup
