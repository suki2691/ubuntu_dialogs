2009-01-17T20:02:00.000Z	usr13		I'm having trouble with flashplugin.  When I go to youtube and try to play a video the video screen area comes up as a black square for couple seconds and then just goes away and I'm just left with white area up there.  I've run firefox ubuntu.com from terminal and am posting terminal ouptut at http://paste.ubuntu.com/105913/  (OS is Ubuntu 8.04)
2009-01-17T20:02:00.000Z	usr13		I ment to say firefox youtube.com  not firefox ubuntu.com
