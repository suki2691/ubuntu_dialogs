2007-11-05T20:02:00.000Z	sharpie		i'm installing winxp on virtualbox but the installation is EXTREMELY slow (like, it's been running for about an hour and still says it'll finish in 33 minutes)
2007-11-05T20:02:00.000Z	Vlet	sharpie	could your XP cd be busted?
2007-11-05T20:02:00.000Z	sharpie	Vlet	no
2007-11-05T20:03:00.000Z	Vlet	sharpie	you may be better off asking in #vbox
