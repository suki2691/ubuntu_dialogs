2006-12-12T08:39:00.000Z	pinchartl		I'd like to request an openldap backport for edgy. I compiled openldap2.3 (apt-get build-dev openldap2.3 && apt-get source -b openldap-2.3) successfully. the .deb packages install without any problem, but both libldap-2.2.26 and libldap-2.3.29 are now installed side by side. would that make the backport invalid per rule 3. (No new libraries that have negative impact on ANY other system component) ?

2006-12-12T08:40:00.000Z	pinchartl	LjL	I know. this is the first time I'm playing with ubuntu backports, so I'm looking for some input regarding the validity of my request, to make sure I don't spam the forum
2006-12-12T08:40:00.000Z	LjL	pinchartl	at any rate... i don't know precisely what the backports rule are, but if the libraries are actually installed *side by side*, i.e. they don't interfer with each other, i'm not sure that should be a problem
