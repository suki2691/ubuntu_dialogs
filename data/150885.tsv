2007-01-25T06:06:00.000Z	hairulf1		I had a beryl crash, beryl wouldn't start, got me a blank screen and a moving cursor, I deleted /usr/bin/beryl - how do I "reinstall" beryl?
2007-01-25T06:06:00.000Z	frogzoo	hairulf1	sudo apt-get --reinstall install beryl
2007-01-25T06:08:00.000Z	hairulf1	frogzoo	Thanks :) I'll give it a try
