2005-04-22T08:58:00.000Z	picochu	tritium	the work around is just to much work. I am not going to go thru all the steps for the desktops I'm going to install for non tech users
2005-04-22T08:59:00.000Z	tritium	picochu	ubuntu has to stay legal, so they can't include restricted formats
2005-04-22T09:00:00.000Z	picochu	tritium	they don't have to include the binaries... there's always automated scripts to install "restricted formats"
