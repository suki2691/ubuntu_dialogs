2012-10-10T23:59:00.000Z	ardian		Hi I have a question I installed Ubuntu but I didn't do any updates I am not sure if I should get the proprietary driver first and then update the system ?

2012-10-11T00:00:00.000Z	ardian	AresTheLion	ok will this get the proprietary driver sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates ?
2012-10-11T00:00:00.000Z	AresTheLion	ardian	I'm not an expert on drivers, sorry. Someone else should know
