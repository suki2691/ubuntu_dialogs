2010-02-23T02:37:00.000Z	neurochrome		Hi all, I have a folder that is _rammed_ full of images (12GB+) and when I open it the window just greys out (nautilus) and the system becomes unresponsive.  What I want to do is run a script to filter the contents of the folder into other folder 1-9 A-Z, hopefully that will mean I can browse my art again easily
