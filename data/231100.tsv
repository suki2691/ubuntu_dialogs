2005-11-16T08:10:00.000Z	edoardo		you guys, i'm the author of an audio conversion script named audio-convert. you might have read about it in the ubuntu forums. anyway, it's becomin' really popular lately. would anyone help me make a .deb? it's two files only, so it's probably not that hard. anyone? thankyou! : )
