2011-02-21T23:08:00.000Z	JMOB0909873		Hi, possibly silly question: how would one place a fresh install of ubuntu onto a separate partition from within ubuntu?  Have some unpartitioned space, an .iso of 64-bit Maverick, and am currently running from a 32-bit wubi maverick).  Can this be done w/o external media (I have no discs available to burn)?

2011-02-21T23:09:00.000Z	avis-		don't have one.  read it on http://linuxhomepage.com its a very nice linux news portal
2011-02-21T23:14:00.000Z	JMOB0909873	avis-	so does that mean I need to direct grub2 to the .iso file and restart?
