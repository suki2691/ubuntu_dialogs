2009-09-23T04:53:00.000Z	bobbyd		does anyone know where the settings are stored from the compiz config settings manager?
2009-09-23T04:53:00.000Z	bobbyd		I often want to just disable compiz temporarily, but I lose my custom settings when I do that
2009-09-23T04:54:00.000Z	coz_	bobbyd	 that would be  gconf backend
