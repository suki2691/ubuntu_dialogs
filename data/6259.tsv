2012-01-23T22:00:00.000Z	dat0m		hey, I just tried to boot into kubuntu from a live cd (I bought the original CD) on my XPS 17, but it failed, it loaded for a while, then it just hang up and nothing else happened. I tried with normal ubuntu from usb too, it hangs up too, with SCPI error (or something like that)
2012-01-23T22:00:00.000Z	dat0m		does anybody use ubuntu/kubuntu on the XPS 17?
2012-01-23T22:01:00.000Z	ikonia	dat0m	I do on a xps 13
2012-01-23T22:01:00.000Z	dat0m	ikonia	did you have any problems while booting the livecd/installer?
