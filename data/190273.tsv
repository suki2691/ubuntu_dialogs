2007-04-04T12:23:00.000Z	sjbrown		anyone know how to change scrollbars so that there's a "jump to top" button on them?
2007-04-04T12:23:00.000Z	sjbrown		is there a theme out there somewhere that has this?
2007-04-04T12:24:00.000Z	Warbo	sjbrown	Are you sure the "Home" key won't do it?
2007-04-04T12:31:00.000Z	sjbrown	Warbo	ah nice.  works well enough.  thanks
