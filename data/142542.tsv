2012-07-04T21:50:00.000Z	Pinkamena_D		i cant scroll up the page of the terminal
2012-07-04T21:50:00.000Z	Pinkamena_D		how do you scroll with screen? usually its just shift+pageup but that does not work
2012-07-04T21:50:00.000Z	andre_pl	Pinkamena_D	you need to press ctrl+A to enter scrollback mode in screen
