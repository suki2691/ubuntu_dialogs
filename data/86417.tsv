2008-07-04T11:11:00.000Z	jkoltner		OK, I have two machines that are now working just fine with their Ethernet cards, but "sudo network-admin --configure eth0" just produces the error message, "The interface does not exist...," even though ifconfig certainly shows an eth0 with an assigned IP address, etc.  Anyone know what's going on?
2008-07-04T11:13:00.000Z	ePax	jkoltner	Your comp mught be using ath0 or eth1... type ifconfig to see
2008-07-04T11:13:00.000Z	jkoltner		Would anyone be willing to try "sudo network-admin --configure eth0" on their own machine and let me know if they get the same error message or not?  (I'm using 8.04, BTW.)
2008-07-04T11:14:00.000Z	jkoltner	ePax	It's using eth0... the first few lines of ifconfig are: eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:17:08:41:b1:91
