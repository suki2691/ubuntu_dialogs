2009-08-22T07:27:00.000Z	marcelo_	william56	missing glx drivers?
2009-08-22T07:28:00.000Z	william56	marcelo_	i meant that glxinfo is giving me the old extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0"
2009-08-22T07:34:00.000Z	marcelo_	william56	I am using a nvidia Geforce 9800 GT and the glxinfo gives me what i expect.
