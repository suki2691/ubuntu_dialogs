2007-02-21T07:04:00.000Z	Zoffix		Hi, my cdrom doesn't want to open :| it has a DVD inside and I can view the files on it, but neither clicking "Unmount" nor pushing the button on CD-ROM itself, nor executing `eject` opens it :/ It gives me `umount: /media/cdrom0: device is busy` and I don't think anything is using the DVD inside :/ Any ideas on how I can open it without rebooting?
