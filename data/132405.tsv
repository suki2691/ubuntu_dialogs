2007-10-16T11:24:00.000Z	Colro		I want to install the latest stable ATI drivers (8.40.4) but the newest in the restricted driver manager are 8.37.6 -- I know they work fine from word of mouth, but I have no clue what I'm doing and want to know just how to remove them and go back to the restricted manager version if they do mess up for me. Anyone able to help? ;x
