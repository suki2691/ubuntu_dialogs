2008-08-14T21:57:00.000Z	Kenthree		Hello, I sent files from windows through samba, But I can't write to them on ubuntu because i'm not the owner. can I fix this?

2008-08-14T22:14:00.000Z	Kenthree	Prose	I used chmod +rw but I get Operation not permitted. The owner of the folder is "nobody"
2008-08-14T22:15:00.000Z	Prose	Kenthree	change the owner of the folder with 'chown -R' so it's recursive
