2006-04-29T11:48:00.000Z	engla		Obligatory question: I'm trying to take a screenshot for a bug, but I need 1. the hover (prelight?) effect on a button and 2. A screengrab with a menu open. 1. Doesn't capture to the screenshot (?!) and 2. You can't take screenshots when having a menu open. Solution?
