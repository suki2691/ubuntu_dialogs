2005-10-28T08:22:00.000Z	nubuntu		anyone Norwegians here who can help me get those special characters (ea oe aa) working in xmms and gtkpod...
2005-10-28T08:22:00.000Z	liquidten2	nubuntu	 it just won't work ufortunately
2005-10-28T08:23:00.000Z	liquidten2	nubuntu	 You need to use beep-media-player (bmp) to see special characters.  It is essentially the gtk2 version of xmms
2005-10-28T08:24:00.000Z	nubuntu	liquidten2	well, xmms can executed to work with special characters, but I cant get it permanent
