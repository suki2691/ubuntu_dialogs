2008-08-03T09:03:00.000Z	NewbieKH		I stumbled upon a cool guide that tells you how to hide a rar archive in a .jpg image on windows. I've been playing with the "cat" command to try to do the same
2008-08-03T09:03:00.000Z	NewbieKH		does anyone know a way to do this for linux?
2008-08-03T09:05:00.000Z	RequinB4	NewbieKH	- um, linux distros use MIME types and not file extensions... If you want to fool a person you can just rename it to name.jpg
2008-08-03T09:06:00.000Z	RequinB4	NewbieKH	- but anyone on ubuntu will get a warning message telling people what is wrong
