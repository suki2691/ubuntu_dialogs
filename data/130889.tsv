2008-05-13T06:19:00.000Z	Shpook		How easy is it to use the Ubuntu install CD to recover information off of a windows HDD? Would I have to compile a special kernel or some type of magic?
2008-05-13T06:20:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Shpook	it's actually pretty easy.  i think ntfs-3g is even installed by default so you just need to mount the drive
2008-05-13T06:21:00.000Z	Shpook	arrrghhh	Sounds good to me....that's if the drive will allow me. From past experience, I would say clicking hard drives aren't a good thing. Thanks :-D
