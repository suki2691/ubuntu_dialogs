2009-01-14T01:07:00.000Z	bn43		can anyone help? I can't get a script to execute after starting wvdial
2009-01-14T01:08:00.000Z	nickrud_	bn43	you mean if you start wvdial in a terminal, you can't run a script in the same terminal?
2009-01-14T01:09:00.000Z	bn43	nickrud_	no I put a script in /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/ and read that any script in there executes
2009-01-14T01:10:00.000Z	nickrud_	bn43	ah, I've never used wvdial and expected that to happen. I've always used pppconfig so don't have any usable insight
