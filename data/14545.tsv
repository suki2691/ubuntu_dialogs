2012-01-02T01:50:00.000Z	DrPenguin	savid	you can get info about a particular package from apt, and it will tell you where it comes from. it all comes from the control file
2012-01-02T01:51:00.000Z	savid	DrPenguin	 apt-get?  Not sure which apt cmd will do that for me
2012-01-02T01:51:00.000Z	DrPenguin	savid	I think its apt-get info? im not sure, check out the manpage
