2010-02-24T04:44:00.000Z	MenZa		Is it possible to choose what users should be displayed on the GDM login? I'm installing Ubuntu for a friend, and I'm trying to make a maintenance user in case I ever need to troubleshoot it over ssh or by other means.
2010-02-24T04:45:00.000Z	meganerd	MenZa	this was possible on 9.04
2010-02-24T04:45:00.000Z	MenZa	meganerd	Aye, this is on Karmic
2010-02-24T04:45:00.000Z	meganerd	MenZa	just like hiding the userlist was point and click on 9.04, but not 9.10
