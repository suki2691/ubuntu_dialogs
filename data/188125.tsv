2006-05-10T10:49:00.000Z	jeff303		how can I view the standard output and/or error stream output from apps not launched from a terminal (i.e. the Gnome menu)?
2006-05-10T10:50:00.000Z	hastesaver	jeff303	I don't know, but why not just launch them from a terminal?
2006-05-10T10:50:00.000Z	jeff303	hastesaver	yeah I guess that's easy enough with Gnome's "Run in Terminal" option  :-)
2006-05-10T10:51:00.000Z	hastesaver	jeff303	Or really have a terminal running and type the command from there :p
