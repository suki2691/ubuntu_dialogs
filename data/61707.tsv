Generally when i go to some ftp site a window appears requiring user and pass to login, but in my case when i go to my ftp server it doesnt prompt me for user and pass
2009-04-22T18:59:00.000Z	_XAXAB_O_P_E_X_		i did that in vsftpd.conf
2009-04-22T18:59:00.000Z	_XAXAB_O_P_E_X_		but it still logs me directly without the window prompting for user and pass
