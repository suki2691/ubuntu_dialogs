2005-04-18T09:46:00.000Z	SirGrok		I feel like a total idiot saying this: I can't get my sound to work (doh! n00b shouts headed my way). I just reinstalled 5.04 from scratch and I just can't seem to get the sound working.
2005-04-18T09:47:00.000Z	SirGrok		I have an audigy 2 card and onboard sound (audigy is my main card. I think everything is configured correctly)

2005-04-18T09:48:00.000Z	SirGrok	Whiffle	I thought that I had done that... I must not have. I will go and give that a spin. Back in a flash.
