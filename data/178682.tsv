2006-06-16T10:38:00.000Z	peanutb		what is the best terminal irc client?
2006-06-16T10:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	peanutb	 terms like 'best' are always very very 'relative'
2006-06-16T10:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	peanutb	 i would suggest trying irssi, and  check freshmeat.net for other console/text based irc clients
2006-06-16T10:39:00.000Z	peanutb	dr_willis	ok thanks
