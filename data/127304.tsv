2008-03-15T15:47:00.000Z	r-c		is it possible to access 2 networks at the same time with 2 NIC's ???
2008-03-15T15:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	r-c	 gateway machines do that all the time.
2008-03-15T15:48:00.000Z	r-c	Dr_willis	with two gateways?
2008-03-15T15:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	r-c	 It would make sence that  2 different subnets would each have their own gateway.
