2005-04-08T05:28:00.000Z	spiraloid		quick question.. I need to modify my PATH for non-console environments. it appears that bashrc and .bashrc (and the like) are not being parsed when logging in through GDM.. where can I set these on a per-user basis?
2005-04-08T05:28:00.000Z	spiraloid		not just path, but also add some env. vars
2005-04-08T05:29:00.000Z	spiraloid		the thing is, those arne't being parsed
2005-04-08T05:29:00.000Z	Chipzz	spiraloid	you should RTFM :P
