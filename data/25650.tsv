2010-09-23T08:07:00.000Z	MalelDraconis		Is there a way to input multiple commands in Terminal?  I'm coverting a bunch of .mp4 files to .wav files, and I'm getting tired of doing it one at a time..

2010-09-23T08:08:00.000Z	MalelDraconis	Ryen	Thanks.
2010-09-23T08:08:00.000Z	Ryen	MalelDraconis	No problem.
