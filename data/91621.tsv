2009-06-30T14:42:00.000Z	joaopinto	drowsy	you mean you want to install the desktop packages on a minimal/server install ?
2009-06-30T14:49:00.000Z	joaopinto	drowsy	are you sure you dont have another cd/iso setup for the vmware image ? That message does not appear to be related to an ubuntu installer
