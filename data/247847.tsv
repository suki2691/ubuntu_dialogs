2006-01-12T13:42:00.000Z	top222		One problem... if I have Debian Unstable packages installed, then how do I downgrade them to the latest Hoary version?
2006-01-12T13:43:00.000Z	top222		Or how do I do that downgrade automatically?

2006-01-12T13:46:00.000Z	ompaul	top222	I would get the breezy CD back up the home partition, do a clean install, put the old home partition somewhere the those who need it can read it and work from there
