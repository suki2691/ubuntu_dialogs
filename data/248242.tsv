2005-03-14T09:20:00.000Z	nix000		anyone can tell me how i can have multiple wlan0 configurations so that i can hop on the local wifi network {home,work} by just doing ifup,ifdown ?
2005-03-14T09:21:00.000Z	nix000		i dont think i can have multiple configuration for the same interface in /etc/network/interfaces and the ui sucks btw !

2005-03-14T09:23:00.000Z	nix000	meuserj|work	i was speaking of the network-config. i assume the ui should to make non obvious things easier .. like my case.
