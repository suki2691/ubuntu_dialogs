2012-07-15T18:43:00.000Z	HelloWorld321		My Ubuntu Software Center says that I have the MySQL client installed, yet I can't find it from the "Dash" bar.  Is there a way to get in on the "Dash" bar?  Is there a way to run it from elsewhere?
2012-07-15T18:44:00.000Z	HelloWorld321		Should I check the installation somehow to make sure that it's really there?  dpkg says yes.
2012-07-15T18:44:00.000Z	Kruptein	HelloWorld321	did you try running it from command line?
2012-07-15T18:46:00.000Z	Kruptein	HelloWorld321	it can have a gui :p I just wondered whether you could start it from command line so that you are sure that it is there and then you can add it to the dash
