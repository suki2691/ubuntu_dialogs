2012-04-30T00:47:00.000Z	abs		hey, my laptop keeps getting ridiculously hot (it's dualboot one -- win7, and I put 12.04 on it recently). I should mention that when on win7 it doesn't get NEARLY as hot. Any tips?
2012-04-30T00:48:00.000Z	abs		basically, it gets so hot that it auto shuts off pretty frequently
2012-04-30T00:49:00.000Z	abs		Iḿ thinking itś because of the nvidia drivers. Should I get rid of them and use the opensource ones? Can someone please briefly describe how I would do this?
