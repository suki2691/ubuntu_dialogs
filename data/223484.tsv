2005-08-30T09:40:00.000Z	anekdoten		i installed unbuntu on ide2, i was expecting to be asked for a bootloader config and i wasnt, now it appears to have overwritten my mbr which was my 120gig ntfs drive, how can i fix this? the data on there is critical, and it would be hard to get the backups
2005-08-30T09:42:00.000Z	anekdoten		anyone?
2005-08-30T09:43:00.000Z	Velox	anekdoten	Is the original MBR Windows?
