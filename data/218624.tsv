2011-01-31T20:11:00.000Z	tehloki		Hi. I'm running wubi with windows 7 and I just did an update and grub no longer loads when i choose the ubuntu option from the win7 bootloader. It just looks for wubildir, finds it on hd0,1, then restarts. is this a known issue? what should i do
2011-01-31T20:12:00.000Z	tehloki		it seems like every time i update grub in ubuntu, it breaks the boot process with wubi

2011-01-31T20:13:00.000Z	sipior	tehloki	no, i'm afraid there isn't (to my knowledge)
