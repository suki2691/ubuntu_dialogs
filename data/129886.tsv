2011-02-25T02:14:00.000Z	dvda		I have a question about security: I have apache on my computer and lately I see connection attempts to it from 127.0.0.1 which try to connect to different servers http://paste.ubuntu.com/571919/ . What could that be caused by?

2011-02-25T02:17:00.000Z	dvda	ikonia	but yeah, still, I hope it's not some bad software of something. I didn't use to have that before like 3 days ago
2011-02-25T02:17:00.000Z	ikonia	dvda	it's not
