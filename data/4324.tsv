2012-03-28T19:33:00.000Z	Nightweels		Isn't there graphical version of "sudo" in ubuntu something like "open as administrator". (Yes Im a little weird programmer, interested in graphical commands more than the terminal ones don't blame me people Its just I can't get rid of this obsession :p )
2012-03-28T19:33:00.000Z	Nightweels		what ever just have all the permission
2012-03-28T19:34:00.000Z	hylian	Nightweels	yes, gksu. for instance, gksu synaptic would get you a sudo'ers access to synaptic,
2012-03-28T19:38:00.000Z	Nightweels	hylian	I mean basically when modifying a protected file (by the system for example) graphically, I get error related to permission so I'm obliged through the terminal to modify it...
