2010-11-06T17:06:00.000Z	Jef91		Anyone know how I would read and write to a text file using bash?
2010-11-06T17:06:00.000Z	jrib	Jef91	what do you want to accomplish?
2010-11-06T17:08:00.000Z	jrib	Jef91	ask #bash what's the best way.  There are lots of ways to edit text files: echo/cat with redirection, sed, awk, etc...
2010-11-20T18:51:00.000Z	Jef91	jrib	you still around? After installing halevt I can mount drives as a normal user - but I cannot write to them for some reason (vfat flash drive)
