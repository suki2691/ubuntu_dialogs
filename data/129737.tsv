2007-12-05T18:17:00.000Z	ciacon		hi all... how can I load vesa-fb @ startup?? I miss a high-res command line ;-)
2007-12-05T18:17:00.000Z	wols_	ciacon	set a different videomode with "vga=XXX" as a kernel-parameter iirc
2007-12-05T18:19:00.000Z	ciacon	wols_	tried that, but the kernel-module is not loaded or even there... it used to work for 7.04, but sadly upgrading to 7.10 I had a dead command-line...
2007-12-06T13:56:00.000Z	wols_	ciacon	don't ask to ask, just ask
