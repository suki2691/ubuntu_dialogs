2008-08-25T07:05:00.000Z	qr_	murlidhar	you don't . nothing on your computer happens at all without using a software.
2008-08-25T07:06:00.000Z	murlidhar	qr_	i meant with using a GUI application like gtkchtheme
2008-08-25T07:06:00.000Z	qr_	murlidhar	ahh, I see. it's unlikely that you'd be able tochange gnome themese without using a gnome gui app.
