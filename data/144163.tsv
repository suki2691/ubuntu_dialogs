2007-03-03T07:51:00.000Z	Tom___	AndrewB	thanks for the advise.  I will install rcconf and disable usplash as soon as I can, but I am still following your first bit of advise which was to reconfigure the xserver-xorg.  It got stuck on the video modes selection.  Nothing I do seems to be accepted (keep getting knocked back to the same screen after selecting "OK")
2007-03-03T07:52:00.000Z	AndrewB	Tom___	good luck.
