2007-08-15T15:13:00.000Z	RickH		How can I search all .txt files in the current directory for any files containing the word "Sunday"?
2007-08-15T15:13:00.000Z	BrowneR	RickH	man grep
2007-08-15T15:14:00.000Z	RickH	BrowneR	 grep works with files?
2007-08-15T15:14:00.000Z	BrowneR	RickH	sure "grep Sunday *.txt"
