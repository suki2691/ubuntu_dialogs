2012-01-25T09:02:00.000Z	oconnore__		Hi, I recently installed ubuntu 11.10 on my laptop, and now it's won't boot (stuck on the initial boot animation). Any ideas?

2012-01-25T09:04:00.000Z	oconnore__	Juv1228	what should I be looking for? It's just a stock install.
2012-01-25T09:05:00.000Z	oconnore__	Juv1228	eh, I hit alt-f1 and there is no output
