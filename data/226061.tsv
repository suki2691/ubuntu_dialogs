2005-07-30T06:12:00.000Z	StFS		hello. I'm trying to install DeMuDi (an ubuntu based distro that has some patches for increased sound performance). I'm having problems getting my NIC to work when I boot up the installation CD and I've found out that I need to disable ACPI in order to get my network card up and running... however, when I boot the installation CD with "linux26 acpi=off" I get a "Kernel panic: Too many boot env vars at 'acpi=off'"
2005-07-30T06:13:00.000Z	StFS		anybody have any idea?

2005-07-30T06:50:00.000Z	StFS	resiak	sorry for the late response but DeMuDi 1.2.1 Live CD is an Ubuntu CD at the core.
