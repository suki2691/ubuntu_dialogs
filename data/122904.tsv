2007-09-02T08:32:00.000Z	_cms		Hello. I'm installing 7.04 right now using the standard graphical installer, and gotten past the confirmation screen. However the "Installing system" window does not have the progress bar, and is nearly as small as a window can be (just a small gray square). It is not resizable. How might I be able to check the progress?
