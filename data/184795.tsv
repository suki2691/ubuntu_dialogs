2006-06-23T16:09:00.000Z	tomlikestorock		Is there any reason why I wouldn't want to install a 64 bit kernel?
2006-06-23T16:10:00.000Z	tomlikestorock		hm. I really want wireless on my laptop, and in order to do that I need acer_acpi loaded. It's 64 bit only. Acerhk isn't working, either.
2006-06-23T16:10:00.000Z	tomlikestorock		frogzoo:let's say I installed the 64 bit kernel. What if it messed up? How would I go about loading the 32 bit again?
2006-06-23T16:11:00.000Z	Schalken	tomlikestorock	or like I have, simply installed 32bit instead :D
