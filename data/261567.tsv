2005-05-24T13:34:00.000Z	Gentleman_finn		When I try to mount my fat32 drive it says "FAt: IO charset iso88591 not found" what I have in my fstab is: "/dev/hda5 /media/hda5 vfat umask=0,iocharset=iso88591 0 0" what did I do wrong :)?
2005-05-24T13:35:00.000Z	Seveas	Gentleman_finn	isn't it iso8859-1
2005-07-01T11:27:00.000Z	Seveas	Gentleman_finn	he should type his password correctly...
2005-07-01T11:28:00.000Z	Seveas	Gentleman_finn	maybe his username contains invalid characters
