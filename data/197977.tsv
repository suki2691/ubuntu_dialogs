2006-04-18T10:25:00.000Z	Cainus		hey... I installed gcc, but I still don't have some files that are supposedly common files (limits.h, syslimits.h)... anyone know what else I need to install?
2006-04-18T10:25:00.000Z	_jason	Cainus	build-essential
2006-04-18T10:25:00.000Z	Cainus	_jason	say what? :)
2006-04-18T10:26:00.000Z	_jason	Cainus	the build-essential package should give you all of those things
