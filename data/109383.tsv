2007-12-20T13:10:00.000Z	poppy75		I have an ssh server and some network shares setup on my desktop. i want to leave it on all the time but i dont want to waste that much power. i consider WoL but my desktop only has connection via wireless. what options do i have to make the shares and server available and save as much power as possible?
