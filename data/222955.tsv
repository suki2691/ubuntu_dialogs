2006-09-21T09:49:00.000Z	Krooga		since ntfs isn't too linux friendly, how windows friendly are linux filesystems?
2006-09-21T09:50:00.000Z	Krooga		any idea of the efficiency of ntfs vs ext2/3 in a windows environment?

By default, you'll find that filsystems such as ext3 and ReiserFS will not work under Windows, but you can get them recognized with third-party drivers.
