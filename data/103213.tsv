2008-01-21T12:01:00.000Z	ranjhana		How can I boot to a command line instead of the GUI on a fresh install of 7.10? It's selecting the wrong video mode (had to use the alternate installer since the default installer has this problem too) and I can't see anything.

2008-01-21T12:02:00.000Z	ranjhana	bod_	At what point during bootup? Or wait until the system loads and then do that so it kicks me back to a command line?
