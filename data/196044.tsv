2006-03-12T14:09:00.000Z	jc2	geek|sauce	: dpkg -i file.deb just worked for me. (Can I get a confirmation on this?)
2006-03-12T14:14:00.000Z	geek|sauce	jc2	i did that with sudo and it unpacked it and said "setting up frostwire" and nothing happened
2006-03-12T14:14:00.000Z	geek|sauce	jc2	nevermind...it's working now
