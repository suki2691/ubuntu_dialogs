2011-01-16T23:52:00.000Z	FrozenFire		The other evening, my younger sister's Ubuntu box lost power suddenly because of a storm and the power going out. Now, it won't boot. It hits a BusyBox shell and it doesn't appear that anything's being mounted.
2011-01-16T23:52:00.000Z	FrozenFire		Should I just reinstall it, or is there an easy fix? There's not much on the box, and I can access any data she wants to keep from a LiveCD during install.
2011-01-16T23:54:00.000Z	FrozenFire		Probably the fstab
