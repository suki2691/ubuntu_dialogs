2008-02-26T10:31:00.000Z	deniz__		aka not live cd
2008-02-26T10:31:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	deniz__	no, gparted requires the partitions it is working on to be unmounted
2008-02-26T10:32:00.000Z	deniz__	jeffMASTERflex	well in that case can i tell virtualbox to use another hd than the one that has the os on?
