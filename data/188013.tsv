2006-09-13T06:40:00.000Z	panegi		im running windows xp right now, so if anyone has any experience with windows (i hear most linux users dont but its worth a shot) isnt there something you can enter in the command prompt to switch your harddrive from ntfs to fat32?
2006-09-13T06:41:00.000Z	panegi		so after i format it the filesystem no longer matters?
2006-09-13T06:42:00.000Z	||arifaX	panegi	you can not convert from ntfs back to fat32 but from fat32 to ntfs in windows xp you need 3rd party apps like partition magic or diskdirector
2006-09-13T06:42:00.000Z	||arifaX	panegi	and windows can only format fat32 with 20gbytes since windows 2000
