2012-04-30T16:10:00.000Z	acer-ubuntu		I installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop, and am now trying to get it to run. In the grub menu, if I load it normally, all I get is a black screen. In order for it to boot successfully, I have to edit the menu item and add 'nomodeset'. With this, Ubuntu boots up.
2012-04-30T16:10:00.000Z	acer-ubuntu		Is there a fix for this, so that I don't have to constantly add the nomodeset? I tried to install the proprietary drivers but I still had the same problem
2012-04-30T16:11:00.000Z	acer-ubuntu		anyone can help me?
