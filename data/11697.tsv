2011-07-23T17:50:00.000Z	uboontu		If I don't check to format existing partition(in which I want to install Ubuntu), will my data on that partition be saved?
2011-07-23T17:50:00.000Z	Polah	uboontu	Ubuntu will overwrite things it needs to etc. I'd back up the data you need to keep to be sure.
2011-07-23T17:51:00.000Z	uboontu	Polah	so it should not delete everything? I already did backup
