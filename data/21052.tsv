2011-08-24T04:31:00.000Z	Lyca		i know there is, but im very new to the linux scene. im still trying to figure it out
2011-08-24T04:31:00.000Z	clemenstimpler	Lyca	you find them by opening synaptic and entering 'torrent' in the search box
2011-08-24T04:32:00.000Z	clemenstimpler	Lyca	some programs are tied to particular environments: if you install ktorrent on a lubuntu install, it will draw in many dependent packages
