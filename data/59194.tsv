2010-03-05T00:57:00.000Z	NfNitLoop		I'm running karmic and I can't copy and paste between several applications.   It seems that selecting text in Konsole just doesn't bother putting it in the clipboard, even when I do Edit -> Copy from the menu.  Any thoughts?

2010-03-05T00:58:00.000Z	VCoolio	NfNitLoop	just select and then middle mouse, or shift+insert, should be generally working
2010-03-05T01:00:00.000Z	NfNitLoop	VCoolio	Yes, I know how to copy/paste.   It's just Konsole that's affected.
