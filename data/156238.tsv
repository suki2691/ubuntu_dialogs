2009-05-21T20:46:00.000Z	petsounds		hello, tomorrow i'm going to buy a new hard disk, and i want to use it for single boot. i read from http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=282018, about creating partitioning but i don't really understand it and i need interactive guidance. the point is i want to create 2 partitions (C, D) so if i need to reinstalling ubuntu i don't lose any of my data on drive D. thanks b4

2009-05-21T20:53:00.000Z	genii	petsounds	There is the concept of "mount points". So the place your personal stuff is in a directory structure like /home/yourname     and the dir /home  can actually be an entirely different disk or partition for instance, which is "mounted" to that dir. This is how it works for the most part.
