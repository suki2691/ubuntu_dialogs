2011-10-17T03:12:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two		I upgraded my desktop to 11.10 a little while back, and pulseaudio hasn't worked (won't start) since. I've tried purging and reinstalling all pulse pkgs, but it still isn't working. What I'd like to do is remove all ubuntu desktop pkgs (I'm in xfce now), manually remove any remaining configs, and reinstall them. Is there an easier way?
