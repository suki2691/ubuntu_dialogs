2008-05-08T04:25:00.000Z	McRib		Could someone please help me get my Microsoft (gasp!, it was cheap) Wireless Laser Desktop 4000 working?  Everything appears to work fine except for the middle mouse button... the wheel works fine, though.  Also, if you have info on how to configure the extra keys, I would accept that :)

2008-05-08T04:28:00.000Z	MachinTrucChose		it's installed by default in Kubuntu, not so with Ubuntu
2008-05-08T04:28:00.000Z	McRib	MachinTrucChose	Good call.
