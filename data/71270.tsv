2011-07-06T01:08:00.000Z	froq		So I am looking for a dock/ app launcher to place on my ubuntu, yet I don't want to use compiz.... any direction y'all?  I have looked @ cairo-dock, wasn't a fan...
2011-07-06T01:09:00.000Z	jdevel	froq	checked out google yet?
2011-07-06T01:09:00.000Z	froq	jdevel	I did... it came back with AWN, Docky, Cairo-dock, SlimDock & one other one (don't remember the name...) the last two match my goal, yet have support and therefore break often...
