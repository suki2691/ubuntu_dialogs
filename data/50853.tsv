2009-08-23T20:18:00.000Z	mnaines	xiphos	its supposed to do that.  You WANT iptables to enable the firewall every time you boot up

2009-08-23T20:25:00.000Z	mnaines	xiphos	here's a conversation I heard from two security guards one time, pay attention because it applies to network security as much as physical security:  "What kind of security do you have inside the foundry?"  "We have a state of the art security system."  "What do you need all that security for in a remote location like this?"  "It was (Raheem) Kadir's idea.  And I don't think he was worried about outside threats."  "He didn't trust his own people."  "
