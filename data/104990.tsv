2011-03-25T02:27:00.000Z	mili_cor		I watch videos on Chrome 10 or Firefox 4 . If i reload the page or re-open the page the video starts from beginning to load (download) . My connection is slow but my computer is very good. I need to increase my cache memory for videos ( flash and html5 videos...) but i don't know how.. can someone please help me ? Thank you!
