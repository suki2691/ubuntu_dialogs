2010-01-19T06:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	noXandOs	can you clarify the question, wubi and virtualbox are seperate
2010-01-19T06:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	noXandOs	you can run virtualbox inside a wubi install
2010-01-19T06:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip__	noXandOs	its a different file structure so i doubt it will work
