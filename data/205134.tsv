2008-10-15T06:08:00.000Z	Ashkore		When I try to install swfdec-mozilla it has a billion broken dependences, what should I do? The package manager keeps sending me on a goose chase through dependencies
2008-10-15T06:08:00.000Z	dli	Ashkore	it sounds like a package for another release
2008-10-15T06:17:00.000Z	dli	Ashkore	libswfdec0.5-1 sounds very old:(
2008-10-15T06:31:00.000Z	dli	Ashkore	no need :( or Ctl-C
