2008-09-20T23:15:00.000Z	norbert_		hi, I'm trying to help a friend and I told him to execute a Root Terminal
2008-09-20T23:15:00.000Z	norbert_		but Ubuntu doesn't seem to have that menu option (I'm in Debian)
2008-09-20T23:16:00.000Z	norbert_		can any Ubuntu user well me how Ubuntu users start a root terminal?
