2012-07-20T01:34:00.000Z	kiyoshiakira		ok, just wondering, if I've installed xubuntu does that mean I can have Lubuntu in xubuntu as well by installing the LXDE desktop environment?
2012-07-20T01:34:00.000Z	kiyoshiakira		Because I did that, and it said there was a choice for the LXDE session
2012-07-20T01:35:00.000Z	auronandace	kiyoshiakira	sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop will get you the lubuntu session
