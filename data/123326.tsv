2007-10-24T02:10:00.000Z	Evanlec		anyone know where i can download individual kernel patches released by the ubuntu development team? (to add wifi rt2500 chipset support)?
2007-10-24T02:10:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Evanlec	They are part of the Ubuntu Gutsy kernel source
2007-10-24T02:11:00.000Z	Evanlec	IntuitiveNipple	right but i want to patch a vanilla kernel for my specific hardware
2007-10-24T02:13:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Evanlec	the Gutsy Ubuntu-Linux-Modules (l-u-m) is what you want I think
