2011-01-13T00:49:00.000Z	Bogus8	mongy	it will read ntfs partitions... sometimes ones that windows won't read
2011-01-13T00:49:00.000Z	mongy	Bogus8	I mean file systems that are damaged.
2011-01-13T00:49:00.000Z	Bogus8	mongy	other than that I'd suggest something like UBCD for other utils to manipulate damaged systems
