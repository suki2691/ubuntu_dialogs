2006-10-31T12:24:00.000Z	jaks		is firefox 2 coming to dapper?
2006-10-31T12:25:00.000Z	|rt|	jaks	ubuntu locks versions shortly before release...so there will never be firefox2 in dapper...atleast not from a ubuntu repository
2006-10-31T12:26:00.000Z	|rt|	jaks	no they fully support the versions that it shipped with
2006-10-31T12:27:00.000Z	jaks	|rt|	ahh well i dont like that. not very dapper friendly
