2010-04-28T00:17:00.000Z	Italian_Plumber		I have a number of directories contiaining zips. http://pastebin.com/TEU8iPBp ... From the parent, I want to unzip all of them.  "unzip \*/\*.zip" doesn't work.  Any ideas?
2010-04-28T00:17:00.000Z	Italian_Plumber		I'm sorry I posted that twice.
2010-04-28T00:18:00.000Z	LjL	Italian_Plumber	are you sure unzip supports multiple files at all? i have some vague recollection that it doesn't
2010-04-28T00:19:00.000Z	LjL	Italian_Plumber	in which case, try:  for file in */*.zip; do unzip "$file"; done
