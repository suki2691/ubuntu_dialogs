2009-01-28T13:55:00.000Z	mcbane		I want to test the new evolution version that comes with gnome 2.25.5. Is that already in some repo?
2009-01-28T13:57:00.000Z	scizzo-	mcbane	hard to believe....might be in a backport
2009-01-28T13:57:00.000Z	scizzo-	mcbane	since it might depend on 2.25 of gnome in that case
