2006-07-28T09:16:00.000Z	Larsson-Sweden		Having problems with abiword, and especially with the letter "m" . If i type two in a row, for example "summer" it looks like "sum mer" but not that much spacing. To put it simply, there are two much spacing when using letter m. Any ideas? I suspect a DPI setting but cant find the abiword conf file
