2005-03-15T16:43:00.000Z	Jentoo000		i need help
2005-03-15T16:44:00.000Z	Jentoo000		im trying to install emule and, it says on the install.txt that you should ./configure after you unzipped the .zip file, I've tried a million times but it says Permission Denied
2005-03-15T16:45:00.000Z	Lathiat	Jentoo000	chmod u+x configure and then try it
2005-03-15T16:45:00.000Z	Lathiat	Jentoo000	but if thats an issue, you probably gonna have a few more -- if there is a .tar.gz youd be better off with that
