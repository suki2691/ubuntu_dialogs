2011-03-04T02:10:00.000Z	mouse		I've got a question.  There's this old computer I've got and when you start it up the fans and lights come on but that's it.  It doesn't load the bios or anything.  I know the monitor and ram chips work but that's the extent of it.  Any ideas what the problem could be?
