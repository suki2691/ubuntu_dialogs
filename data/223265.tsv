2007-12-21T21:49:00.000Z	Javid		If I wanted to remove Ubuntu from a dualbooting system, how would I restore the bootloader? I don't have a CD drive I can stick a windows cd in and fixmbr from, is it possible to keep grub?

2007-12-21T21:51:00.000Z	butcherbird	Javid	thats why i usually install grub to its own partition /boot  you can i think fdisk /mbr or somesuch
2007-12-21T21:51:00.000Z	butcherbird	Javid	the fdisk is command from windows rescue disk
