I tryed even apt-get ubuntu-desktop to install anything that might of gotten deleted but still no. can anyone help?

2010-01-03T05:54:00.000Z	chriscreasy	faileas	i removed and reinstalled gdm, still doesnt work. still goes straight to command prompt
2010-01-03T05:54:00.000Z	faileas	chriscreasy	tried apt-get purge to remove it?
