2007-02-13T08:55:00.000Z	ithaycu		Can anyone give me some advice on tracking down the cause of unexpected machine shutdowns?
2007-02-13T08:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	ithaycu	check the varius logs in /var/log/
2007-02-13T08:58:00.000Z	ithaycu	erUSUL	Thx, I'll check the logs. I know the shutdowns are non-graceful
