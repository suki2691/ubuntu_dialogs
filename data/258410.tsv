2005-09-03T09:56:00.000Z	apollo13		why?
2005-09-03T09:56:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	apollo13	debian is not ubuntu, they use different compiles and setups
2005-09-03T09:57:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	apollo13	using packages from debian on ubuntu or vice-versa is unrecommended, and might break your system. Then again, It might not.
