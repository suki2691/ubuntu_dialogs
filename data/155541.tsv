2006-12-09T10:27:00.000Z	wabbit		hi all I'm a newbie to ubuntu... I just dist upgraded my dapper distribution to edgy but the apt/source.list still shows dapper. Do I need to change the source.list myself to point to edgy??
2006-12-09T10:28:00.000Z	wabbit		or am I missing something??

2006-12-09T10:28:00.000Z	arrenlex	wabbit	If that upgraded your system, then you have edgy in your sources.list
