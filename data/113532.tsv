2008-06-16T19:49:00.000Z	Jadd76		I'm doing a small home movie with friends. Can anyone recommend a video editor on Ubuntu?

2008-06-16T19:49:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jadd76	Linux doesn't have much in the way of decent video editing software really
2008-06-16T19:50:00.000Z	Jadd76	gordonjcp	I know, I was just wondering which one I should learn
