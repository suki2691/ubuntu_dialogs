2007-07-27T09:05:00.000Z	yagran		"Use rEFIt's partition map tool to copy the GPT partition map into the MBR. The new GPT partition format can handle very large disks and contains the canonical partition map; the old MBR partition map should contain a shadow of this information and is used here primarily by the GRUB bootloader. I am sure that one day soon rEFIt will boot Ubuntu's Linux kernel directly and will be able to skip this." help?
