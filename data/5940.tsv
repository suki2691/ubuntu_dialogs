2012-02-05T00:43:00.000Z	ARGHh		I have a problem with kde + avant-window-navigator...i have no icons! Must I install gnome-icon? What are the dependencies?
2012-02-05T00:43:00.000Z	hroi	ARGHh	 the more I use linux, the more I try to turn of extra graphical features... have you tried using Alt - Shift instead of this dock?
