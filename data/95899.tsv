2010-03-08T11:01:00.000Z	Monona	h00k	My soundcard shares an IRQ with other processes, and I'm getting crazy xruns in jack for audio processing.  I'm just trying to figure out what will make them go away.
2010-03-08T11:06:00.000Z	h00k	Monona	I suppose if you want to mess around with your IRQ settings, that will be done in the BIOS
2010-03-08T11:07:00.000Z	Monona	h00k	 Yeah, just no apparent way to do that.  I guess I'll have to research my BIOS a bit more. *sigh*
