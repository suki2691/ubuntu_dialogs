2011-06-19T23:47:00.000Z	wrek-gar		WARNING: All config files need .conf: /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper, it will be ignored in a future release.
2011-06-19T23:48:00.000Z	llutz	wrek-gar	there will be a time all config files have to be rename following new conventions, /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper  has to be called /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper.conf then
2011-06-19T23:49:00.000Z	llutz	wrek-gar	nothing to worry about yes, just a warning
