2006-06-20T07:02:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m		i have a dual-boot setup (dapper and xp), is it possible to sort out virus and spyware problems on the xp partition while booted into dapper? are there tools to do this in the repos?

2006-06-20T07:02:00.000Z	Hobbsee	sexcopter8000m	try booting into windows safe mode, and running an antivirus scan from there
2006-06-20T07:03:00.000Z	sexcopter8000m	Hobbsee	oh yeah, i forgot about that bit! :s
