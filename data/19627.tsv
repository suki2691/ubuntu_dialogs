2011-01-29T23:37:00.000Z	aphrek		hi all - is it normal for an atom based laptop (running 10.04) to hit 100% cpu when opening firefox or any other browser for that matter
2011-01-29T23:38:00.000Z	_`-`	aphrek	for more than 3-5 seconds?
2011-01-29T23:40:00.000Z	_`-`	aphrek	the entire time the browser is open :o?
2011-01-29T23:41:00.000Z	_`-`	aphrek	perhaps it's trying to load a faulty extension/dependency and having trouble. try with opera?
