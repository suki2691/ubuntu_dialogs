2008-08-02T20:22:00.000Z	djhash	usser	i'd love to use dd. but i wouldn't know what flags and options to use
2008-08-02T20:24:00.000Z	usser	djhash	theres no flags dd is easy basically u'll need to know names of the partitions/hdds u want to copy then dd if=/dev/<part1> of=/dev/<part2> does the trick
