2010-09-23T09:28:00.000Z	Takieda		I downloaded a .bz2 file that was supposed to be compiled... I extracted the one file from it, and when I try to double click the extension-less file, it gives me an error saying "There is no application installed for executable files" trying to type it into terminal gives the error "command not found"
2010-09-23T09:28:00.000Z	Takieda		what should I be typing to get it to run?
2010-09-23T09:30:00.000Z	Takieda		nope... now I get permission denied... I'll run it with sudo
2010-09-23T09:30:00.000Z	sweetpi	Takieda	chmod +x filename; ./filename
