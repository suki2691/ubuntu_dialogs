2007-11-06T21:46:00.000Z	Laser87	b1f30_w0rk	You have to reboot every Linux after a Kernel upgrade
2007-11-06T21:47:00.000Z	b1f30_w0rk	Laser87	that's the kernel dude - i'm talking about basic desktop stuff - gnome/nautilus didn't remember my settings, my desktop, my wallpaper, my window sizes, gdm has bailed at least twice - what gives?
