2007-03-17T08:11:00.000Z	Tominator		does anybody know why? and how can i solve my problem?
2007-03-17T08:12:00.000Z	Tominator		oh i don't know... one moment please...
2007-03-17T08:12:00.000Z	bulmer	Tominator	you have your old kernel around? boot off of the old and look in /lib/firmware/`uname -r`/  see if there are differences?
