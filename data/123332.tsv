2009-12-22T03:47:00.000Z	LadyLynn		I'm a complete newbie to ubuntu and am having two problems.  I have an external hard drive that I can not seem to find (it's NTFS) and I would like to view my windows file (dual booting with Vista)
2009-12-22T03:48:00.000Z	blackest_knight	LadyLynn	click on top or bottom panel and add to panel disk mounter
2009-12-22T03:50:00.000Z	blackest_knight	LadyLynn	 with a little luck your drive should pop up on the panel and you can mount it
2009-12-22T03:51:00.000Z	blackest_knight	LadyLynn	it might take a reboot/ log out  before it works
