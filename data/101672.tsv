2008-04-17T00:20:00.000Z	Na-Fiann		When opening a rar file of multiple parts, fileroller only shows the first file in it, is there any way for it to show all the files and perhaps extravt only one of them?
2008-04-17T00:21:00.000Z	Moridin333	Na-Fiann	is there a .rar file or only .<number> files?
2008-04-17T00:22:00.000Z	Na-Fiann	Moridin333	 they're all of the type name.part<number>.rar
2008-04-17T00:22:00.000Z	Moridin333	Na-Fiann	I'm at a loss then.
