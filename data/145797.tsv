2007-12-05T14:23:00.000Z	blue|palm	rob	recovery software for ubuntu? do you have a name for me?
2007-12-05T14:24:00.000Z	rob	blue|palm	not off the top of my head sorry, you will need to google for it. There does exist several Live CD distros for exactly that purpose, you might be able to recover it by replaying your filesystem journal if you use a journaling filesystem but don't quote me on that
