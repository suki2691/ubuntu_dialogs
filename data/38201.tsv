2010-01-28T08:11:00.000Z	gerrin		just installed a windows program using wine, but now having problems running said programming , any hints?
2010-01-28T08:11:00.000Z	JCC_Starguy	gerrin	depends on the application. Which one?
2010-01-28T08:13:00.000Z	JCC_Starguy	gerrin	not every Windows prog will run on Wine. Have you looked at www.winehq.org?
2010-01-28T08:14:00.000Z	JCC_Starguy	gerrin	the applications page will tell you if it will work or not and often someone will post how they got something to work.
