2011-05-17T02:08:00.000Z	pfifo	lsmobrian	i was having some weired problems putting an app together that used UDP
2011-05-17T02:09:00.000Z	lsmobrian	pfifo	you think it was caused by network latency
2011-05-17T02:10:00.000Z	pfifo	lsmobrian	Im not sure, my ping was acting funny to localhost, not the gateway, but i can reproduce the problem
