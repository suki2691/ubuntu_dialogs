2006-06-01T10:07:00.000Z	T313C0mun1s7		I am up to date now - I assumed that because of the code freeze I would see many updates, but the last week I have seen several a day.
2006-06-01T10:08:00.000Z	nhaines	T313C0mun1s7	there was no code freeze.  :)
2006-06-01T10:09:00.000Z	nhaines	T313C0mun1s7	they had an external professional artist doing icons.
