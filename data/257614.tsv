2008-04-04T13:34:00.000Z	mikedoty		Then you have this envy app that won't even fit all of its contents when you're stuck in sad low res mode and won't let you scroll down.  YOu have to guess with the space bar :(

2008-04-04T13:35:00.000Z	Amaranth	mikedoty	the infrastructure is being fixed and at least intel will rock by the end of the year, then we just need the ati/radeon driver to get there too and nvidia to write a better driver
