2011-07-16T17:20:00.000Z	AnonUser		Hi, I've got a problem. After switching my graphics card (nvidia to ati), session startup takes more time, the system is slower and most part of gnome do not appear to be working.

2011-07-16T17:21:00.000Z	AnonUser	fjorgynn	already did
2011-07-16T17:21:00.000Z	AnonUser	fjorgynn	And nothing works still - gnome-panel doesn't appear and half the time it hangs after logging in
