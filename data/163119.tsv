2006-12-11T16:16:00.000Z	c0ldfusi0n		I tried installing 6.06LTS (web iso), 6.10 (web iso), Kubuntu (dvd) and i get the same error everytime when i try to install. Something like "connection reset by peer: no screen found". I have an ATI x800 on an AMD64, anyone can help?

2006-12-11T16:17:00.000Z	c0ldfusi0n	Music_Shuffle	I'm on XP right now, both work fine. I can also see the console-like text as well as the boot menu.
2006-12-11T16:19:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	c0ldfusi0n	eh...perhaps the card then. In which case, I can't help you. *Has an Nvidia card*
