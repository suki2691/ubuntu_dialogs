2010-10-14T17:55:00.000Z	keith2		Need help with a problem. I've installed Xubuntu on an old Compaq 500Mhz, 512MB RAM, 80GB HDD. System Monitor shows monitor itself using 80-85% of system. Tried to consider Lubuntu but it says   - system is lacking 'cmov' try another kernel-
2010-10-14T17:56:00.000Z	keith2		Is there a way to load with minimal system requirements?
2010-10-14T17:57:00.000Z	rusty149	keith2	use alternative cd to install
2010-10-14T17:59:00.000Z	rusty149	keith2	either I have never installed lubuntu. but a general rule with ubuntu is that the alternative cds use less memory etc.
