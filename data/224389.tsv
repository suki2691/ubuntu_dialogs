2009-09-01T20:20:00.000Z	roy_1		Hi! I tried to replace grub with grub2 (for cooler looks) and it did some terrible things and the kernel can't load
2009-09-01T20:22:00.000Z	roy_1		I'm now using easy bcd to load the vista bcd (only xp and ubuntu installed though)

2009-09-01T20:25:00.000Z	tonii	roy_1	yeah, should be in the boot menu
