2006-06-27T16:45:00.000Z	Ackeubu_		when i get to loginscreen the screen is black and i only see the cursor. i have to do ctrl+akt+backspace then press alt+f1 many times... and then i can do alt+F7 to get to desktop or to logg in.. my fglrx for ATI mobility radeon seems to be working properly after that. can someone explain what i am doing in this process and what i might maybe do to avoid it??
