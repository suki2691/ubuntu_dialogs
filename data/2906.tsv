2012-05-23T13:20:00.000Z	footprints0	MonkeyDust	thanks you. does ifconfig working if i am not logged in to the router?
2012-05-23T13:22:00.000Z	footprints0	MonkeyDust	i think you must logg into the router for ifconfig to show router MAC address, yes?
2012-05-23T13:22:00.000Z	footprints0	MonkeyDust	but what if I am not connected to router?
