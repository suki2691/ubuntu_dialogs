2005-08-10T12:13:00.000Z	ajmitch	_SD_Keo	the manpage says that an errorcode of 6 means fixable errors left uncorrected..
2005-08-10T12:14:00.000Z	ajmitch	_SD_Keo	your question is at once rather vague & specific :)
2005-08-10T12:18:00.000Z	ajmitch	_SD_Keo	sorry, I'm just going from what the manpage tells me, if it cannot fix them, then I don't know
