2010-04-09T15:19:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	tertitten	pulseaudio, but can be made to use alsa with some hacks
2010-04-09T15:20:00.000Z	tertitten	psycho_oreos	ok, thing is, I have no sound, and it seems that it might be due to some conflict between pulseaudio and alsa
2010-04-09T15:22:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	tertitten	it might also be muted, check for that as well
