2006-10-27T14:20:00.000Z	sladen	Ademan_	I think Canonical would prefer to get /other/ people to ship Ubuntu preloaded and pick up the support revenue
2006-10-27T14:20:00.000Z	sladen	Ademan_	yes, there has been alot of money gone into Ubuntu, Launchpad and the tools
2006-10-27T14:21:00.000Z	Ademan_	sladen	hrm, but they've got the power to bulk buy, and as we know from system76 its going to take real bulk buys to even MATCH the prices you can get on computers preloaded with windows
