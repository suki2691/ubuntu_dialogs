2009-05-31T14:02:00.000Z	sharkk		hi, I'm trying to add an item on the menu of gnome, but I cannot find a way to change the working directory before the execution of the command, how can I do that? cd path ; command doesn't work neither in application nor terminal application mode. thanks

2009-05-31T14:03:00.000Z	fryguy	sharkk	also for the launcher there is a 'working directory' option, just set that
2009-05-31T14:03:00.000Z	fryguy	sharkk	no idea
