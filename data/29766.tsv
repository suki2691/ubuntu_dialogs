2011-05-06T03:56:00.000Z	Maarten		Hmmm..... What do you guys think of Unity? I am a Gnome 2.x guy on 10.10 Ubuntu, and I have been reading a lot of bad reviews on Unity as of late.... I know I can force it back to Gnome 2, or try Gnome 3 (which does look nice from screenshots), but is Unity really the way Ubuntu is going?

2011-05-06T04:21:00.000Z	Maarten	cntrational	I'm thinking, if Linux needs to become more popular, I think the different distro's need to get together and come up with 1 installation standard.... replace .deb, .rpm, .whatever install files with a ".bin" (which already exists somewhat) that will install on ALL distros. Then commercial and game companies can come up with a one-click installer..... and that might bring more games to linux! :)
