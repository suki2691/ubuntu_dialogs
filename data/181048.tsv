2009-07-24T09:47:00.000Z	diazepam		hey all -- i know this question has most likely been asked a million times but what is the easiest way to install a basic gnome desktop (e.g. without OO, Evolution, Games and fluff)?
2009-07-24T09:48:00.000Z	gogeta	diazepam	sudo apt-get install gnome i assume
2009-07-24T09:48:00.000Z	diazepam		i still want the admin panel
2009-07-24T09:48:00.000Z	diazepam	gogeta	- sudo aptitude gnome-desktop puts the full blown thing on
