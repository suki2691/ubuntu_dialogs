2008-03-24T09:20:00.000Z	pulpfiction	elthan	tintin++ - is that a ftp client name? :P
2008-03-24T09:21:00.000Z	elthan	pulpfiction	no, it's a MUD client, but there's some useful scripting built in. probably a bash script way to do it
2008-03-24T09:23:00.000Z	pulpfiction	elthan	sorry, but what's a MUD?
