2012-08-24T16:12:00.000Z	maxjso		Hi - looking for NFS, autofs and rpc.statd help
2012-08-24T16:13:00.000Z	maxjso		basically I'm unable to mount NFSv3 from Ubuntu 11.10 - I get "mount.nfs: rpc.statd is not running but is required for remote locking."
2012-08-24T16:13:00.000Z	maxjso		but rpc.statd is running for sure
2012-08-24T16:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	maxjso	are there any bugs reported?
