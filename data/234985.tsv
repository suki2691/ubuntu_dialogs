2012-01-02T09:20:00.000Z	Gallomimia		alas, i have nothing else which will read a pata drive :(
2012-01-02T09:20:00.000Z	Gallomimia		in fact i want to get this up and running to read another old pata drive from a system that's tits-up
2012-01-02T09:20:00.000Z	CarlFK	Gallomimia	can you boot a floppy?
