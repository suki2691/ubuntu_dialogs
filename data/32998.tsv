2012-05-07T15:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	lapion	 i belie you can do a upgrade by mounting the  alternative installer cd iso file.
2012-05-07T15:41:00.000Z	lapion	Dr_willis	then you get an outdated upgrade.. I used to do it with the "jail" option but that can mess up a running system if you don't stop it before changes are made ( even though only temporary)
2012-05-07T15:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	lapion	 Huh?
