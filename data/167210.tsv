2008-09-04T06:23:00.000Z	Choobie		i have a networking problem
2008-09-04T06:24:00.000Z	Choobie		i can't connect to the internet on my other Ubuntu computer, it works just fine plugging directly into the wall, but plugging into my router causes issues. The computer is getting a network address, the router sees the computer, but I cannot pass any traffic to or from the computer
2008-09-04T06:25:00.000Z	Choobie		does this sound like it could be an Ubuntu problem or a router problem?
2008-09-04T06:26:00.000Z	Maczimus	Choobie	sounds like a router config problem as the system works directly in the wall. did you reboot?
