2008-12-06T02:48:00.000Z	TJ-42		I have this problem on ubuntu 8.10 that I can't solve.  I am able to successfully connect to a WPA2 network the first time.  All subsequent times, Ubuntu fails to keep my wpa2 password and substitutes a different wpa2 key.  Even if I try to type in my own keep it fails and again shows the old key.  I can only connect if I delete the network and retry.  I find several bug reports and messages about this, but no solution.  Any idea?
