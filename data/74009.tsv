2009-03-22T06:20:00.000Z	Wolfpawz		I have a little problem. It seems Windows Vista does not like having an entry password for Grub on a dual boot setting; causes BSOD.
2009-03-22T06:21:00.000Z	Wolfpawz		Therefore, I turned off the entry password, and locked it with the main password, and it does not BSOD. What causes this?
2009-03-22T06:23:00.000Z	hmw	Wolfpawz	you should probably ask in #grub ...  this sounds very strange... no idea, what is going on here
