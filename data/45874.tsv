2009-10-20T14:57:00.000Z	pee	erUSUL	puh.. I was searching in synaptic for any with »ln«, without success.
2009-10-20T14:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	pee	given that coreutils have cp mv and a lot of other core utils of any sane unix system i'm amazed that you do not have that installed
2009-10-20T15:00:00.000Z	pee	erUSUL	mv and cp are working well. thats my httpd.conf (from the apache2-folder - dunno why sudo find / -name wasn't finding it): http://bin.cakephp.org/view/744963666
