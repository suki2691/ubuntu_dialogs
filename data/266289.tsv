2011-04-16T13:58:00.000Z	StackUnderFlow		new to ubuntu - how do I connect to a network share? I could just type the share under 'Win + R' under windows (of type \\abcd\xyz)
2011-04-16T13:59:00.000Z	StackUnderFlow		I tried to do 'Places -> Connect to server', but it didnt work out :(
2011-04-16T13:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StackUnderFlow	 smb://server/sharename  (or use ip#) should work also..  or check thenetwork location under the menus
2011-04-16T13:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	StackUnderFlow	 you may need to instll some samba psakcagea
