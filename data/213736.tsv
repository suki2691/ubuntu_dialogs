2009-09-04T04:45:00.000Z	LucidGuy		Picked myself up a netbook and was wondering if you guys recommend the netbook remix version or should I stick to the full ubuntu version.
2009-09-04T04:46:00.000Z	LucidGuy		I personally would like a full desktop version.
2009-09-04T04:47:00.000Z	LucidGuy		When it comes to kernel/hardware detection does the remix version support netbooks better .. or is the full desktop version just as good?
2009-09-04T04:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	LucidGuy	Hardware detection will be identical.
