2009-04-30T14:31:00.000Z	Canaen		how do I get sudo permission to perform an action (ie, replacing a file) without doing so from the command line?
2009-04-30T14:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Canaen	you can run graphical apps with gksudo
2009-04-30T14:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Canaen	it gives graphical apps like nautilus and gedit, sudo powers
2009-04-30T14:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Canaen	if you see a guide that says sudo gedit, it is WRONG
