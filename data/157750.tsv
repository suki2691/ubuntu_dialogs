2008-12-09T23:54:00.000Z	uniformsquare		I have installed adobe flash player yet it fails to support flash in firefox
2008-12-09T23:54:00.000Z	EDinNY	uniformsquare	did you install flash from the deb or by hand?
2008-12-09T23:57:00.000Z	EDinNY	uniformsquare	I used the "sudo apt-get flash-nonfree", then restarted firefox, then it worked
