2007-05-24T13:00:00.000Z	mojo		Hi.  I have a new 500GB drive I am wanting to format, and am wondering if reiserfs or reiser4 would be a better fs than ext3... I will use it as my /home and have lots of large media including DVD images, bittorrents, music, etc.  Any advice?

2007-05-24T13:02:00.000Z	mojo	crabgrass	but i have been running ext3 on my 250 w/o problems/complaints
2007-05-24T13:03:00.000Z	crabgrass	mojo	same here... running ext3 on a 270gb partition of a 300gb drive, with reiser for os files and some swap... no complaints
