2010-06-02T02:44:00.000Z	mikel		Hey all - I'm having some difficulty with sudo-ldap. Most LDAP functionality is working fine, users can login and so on, but they can't sudo at all - auth.log reports '3 incorrect password attempts' rather than 'you're not allowed sucka', but the passwords work just fine for the purpose of logging in via ssh in the first place.

2010-06-02T02:47:00.000Z	pyrophelia	mikel	how is the speed?
2010-06-02T02:51:00.000Z	mikel	pyrophelia	I haven't been putting it under particularly heavy load but it's performance seems pretty comparable to reiserfs which I was using before
