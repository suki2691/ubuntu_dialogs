2010-01-05T02:24:00.000Z	dtolj1	hellspawned	I have done so and I have a bridge running, however when I try to ping external sites from PC (connected to the bridge) it gives me Destination host unreaschable, however I can ping the bridge from PC.
2010-01-05T02:24:00.000Z	dtolj1	hellspawned	but I can ping external sites from the bridge itself not from the PC.
