2006-01-12T17:45:00.000Z	shooters		Is there a way to do a script that would look for a string in a file, and if it finds it, simply delete the file...
2006-01-12T17:46:00.000Z	shooters		look for the string "File not found" (I'm downloading some pages from a website)
2006-01-12T07:04:00.000Z	shooters		How could I set if ((grep - q "text" "filename.txt") == (NULL)) is true/false to a variable?
2006-01-12T07:06:00.000Z	bshumate	shooters	that question would probably be best asked in #bash ;-)
