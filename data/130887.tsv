2008-08-23T22:24:00.000Z	arrrghhh	adilson	create the account with no password.
2008-08-23T22:25:00.000Z	arrrghhh	adilson	it should force the user to create a password on the first login.
2008-08-23T22:27:00.000Z	adilson	arrrghhh	unop: oh ok but I wish to fix their account before they use it and allow them to change pass afterwards, is there a way to get icewm to log in on their account only?
