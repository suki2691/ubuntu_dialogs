2007-09-16T09:06:00.000Z	alecw1		 I"m having a weird problem. I rebooted my PC, and when it came up again, my "notification area" was in a weird place, actually on the desktop. I took a screen shot, http://img487.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotyc1.png . Can someone help me get it where it's supposed to be again? :)
