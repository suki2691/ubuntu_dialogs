2012-04-12T17:57:00.000Z	eugzol		Hey guys, I have a question for a real Linux guru. On every machine I use, with every single user, I had to go over and over these lines: # uncomment for a colored prompt, if the terminal has the capability; turned
2012-04-12T17:57:00.000Z	eugzol		# off by default to not distract the user: the focus in a terminal window
2012-04-12T17:57:00.000Z	eugzol		# should be on the output of commands, not on the prompt. I want to run 'git/svn blame' or something on them and know the name of the bastard who first introduced them into default bashrc, so that I have a chance to get revenge someday. How do I do that?
