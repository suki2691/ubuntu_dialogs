2009-07-04T18:46:00.000Z	MMcGee		Hey, I have added a new logical volume, how do I get the UUID for it? It does not appear in blkid, although the other logical volume in the volume group does.
2009-07-04T18:47:00.000Z	grawity	MMcGee	vol_id --uuid
2009-07-04T18:50:00.000Z	MMcGee	grawity	I do vol_id --uuid /dev/mapper/vg01-backup and I get "unknown or non-unique volume type", am I doing something wrong?
2009-07-04T21:06:00.000Z	MMcGee	grawity	I tried vol_id but it says "unknown or non-unique volume type", I actually got the UUID from lvdisplay, but having it doesn't do much because the volume isnt in /dev/disk/by-uuid/ so it is unrecognized anyway.
