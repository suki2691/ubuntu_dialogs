2005-06-04T07:35:00.000Z	Stalagna		I want to get a file from ftp and it has spaces in it, how do you treat spaces in linux
2005-06-04T07:36:00.000Z	justin	Stalagna	clicking on the file doesn't work?
2005-06-04T07:38:00.000Z	justin	Stalagna	is there any particular reason you are using the crappy ftp program and not just using the integrated ftp client in nautilus, or at least lftp?
2005-06-04T07:39:00.000Z	justin	Stalagna	how did you come to be using the ftp command then?
