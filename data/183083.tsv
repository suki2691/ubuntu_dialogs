2007-10-04T11:17:00.000Z	zeroflag		ubuntu just "lost" 60GB of files that I moved accidently to the trash bin and couldn't restore because the drive was full... how do I get my stuff back?
2007-10-04T11:18:00.000Z	Pelo	zeroflag	is it still in the ~/.Trash folder ?
2007-10-04T11:45:00.000Z	Pelo	zeroflag	the sales point of aptitude it taht ir removes  dependendies when you remove a package,  next time use apt
2007-10-04T11:46:00.000Z	Pelo	zeroflag	more then likely you tried to remvoe someting with gdm as a dependency so gdm got removed as well
