2011-12-24T17:15:00.000Z	hololight		my mouse keeps freezing every 1-5 seconds for anywhere from 3 to 10 seconds.... does this for a while (say 5 minutes)... then wont do it for a while.... When it does happen, keyboard is still responsive. this is not a new installation and I haven't had this problem before maybe 2 days ago. Thoughts?
