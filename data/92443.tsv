2009-01-29T00:52:00.000Z	exco		since some recent update my krusader looks like this (no titlebar) http://img90.imageshack.us/my.php?image=krusadernq4.png (or is that just some fullscreen mode I don't know how to get out of?)
2009-01-29T00:53:00.000Z	maco	exco	are you using compiz?
2009-01-29T00:54:00.000Z	exco	maco	yes
2009-01-29T00:54:00.000Z	maco	exco	if yes, go to the workarounds section of compizconfig-settings-manager and disable legacy fullscreen support. some apps have trouble with it.
