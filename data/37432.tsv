2010-03-03T13:34:00.000Z	ddavids		 i just started my karmic desktop this morning and my sound is not working...the only thing i did yesterday was to install gnome-alsamixer but i didnt change anything inside... can anyone help?
2010-03-03T13:36:00.000Z	|ns|nR8	ddavids	 could try the ubuntu live cd, if sound works then
2010-03-03T13:36:00.000Z	|ns|nR8		rule out hardware fault
2010-03-03T13:36:00.000Z	ddavids	|ns|nR8	then?
