2007-06-20T08:40:00.000Z	Reed_		I am having a lot of problems with installing ubuntu 7.04. When I use the live CD, I get to the 1st load screen, everything goes fine and it just stops at a blank screen. When I use the alternate CD everything will load up until it asks me to select a Screen Resolution. After that it freezes at 6%
