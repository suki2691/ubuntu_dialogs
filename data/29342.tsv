2010-11-07T06:38:00.000Z	Onnionion		I'm trying to install Ubuntu 10.10 (64 bit) onto a 10GB Partition and when I click install, it give an error of how I have no "Root File System"
2010-11-07T06:39:00.000Z	Onnionion		I guess that was kinda obvious :
2010-11-07T06:39:00.000Z	trojan_spike	Onnionion	the partition youre installing on has to be set as (/)
2010-11-07T08:18:00.000Z	trojan_spike	Onnionion	your picked user name has to be small letters
