2005-06-17T13:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	hellraiser_rob	ask specific questions, maybe someone can assist (not me, i have nvidia)
2005-06-17T13:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	hellraiser_rob	perhaps the driver hasn't actually been loaded? how many fps do you get with glxgears ? And have you checked the X log ? (/var/log/Xorg<seomthing>)
2005-06-17T13:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	hellraiser_rob	at a guess the string fragment 'ati' ? (not sure)
