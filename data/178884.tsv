2008-02-14T10:19:00.000Z	Nekro		Help! I downloaded clamav-0.92.1.tar.gz and when I tried to build it got this error: "Please install zlib and zlib-devel packages" but I already have installed zlib1g-dev and zlibc. Any idea??
2008-02-14T10:19:00.000Z	jrib	Nekro	why are you installing clam?
2008-02-14T10:20:00.000Z	jrib	Nekro	clam is in the repositories.  Is there a reason you are not using that?
2008-02-14T10:23:00.000Z	jrib	Nekro	not if it is still supported
