2008-04-25T20:05:00.000Z	andycr	sipior	A mirror for apt? I'm not sure how I would add a mirror to sources.list.
2008-04-25T20:07:00.000Z	sipior	andycr	just edit the sources.list to point at another mirror. i think there's also a command-line program to do this, though the name currently escapes me.
