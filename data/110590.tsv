2008-07-02T23:52:00.000Z	white_eagle		OK, my ubuntu system after 6 months of usage is very slow with compiz (it wasn't even a bit the first 2-3 months - i created a new user - its with the comfortable speed) so, whats the problem? Do I have too many progs. installed or what? I want the speed back!!

2008-07-02T23:53:00.000Z	white_eagle	saint-takeshi	me too
2008-07-02T23:54:00.000Z	white_eagle	saint-takeshi	so I think I should create a new user or something and continue from it
