2008-06-19T15:03:00.000Z	clockswork		Hello! I currently installed Ubuntu on my Dell xps 1530, and I'vr noticed something about the battery life, it went from 4.5 h (in windows) to 2.5h (in ubuntu). Find this pretty weird :S
2008-06-19T15:05:00.000Z	__ryan__	clockswork	 are you going by the estimate, or how long it actually lasted
2008-06-19T15:33:00.000Z	clockswork	__ryan__	: About the battery, does your battery meter say 0% altough your computer is still going?
2008-06-19T15:34:00.000Z	__ryan__	clockswork	 i never let it get that low so not sure
