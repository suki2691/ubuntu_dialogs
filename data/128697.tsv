2007-07-17T06:08:00.000Z	RoC_MasterMind	zango	I don't think so, it's for 32-bit.
2007-07-17T06:09:00.000Z	zango	RoC_MasterMind	i figure: CSS runs on 64 windows fine and Linux can run 32 bit binaries....
2007-07-17T06:09:00.000Z	RoC_MasterMind	zango	oh...I don't know, usually esoteric and proprietary stuff doesn't work out for 64bit people.
