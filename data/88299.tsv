2008-06-07T15:11:00.000Z	YuLin		could someone help me with sed?
2008-06-07T15:12:00.000Z	danza	YuLin	tell the problem ... you can also eventually ask in #bash
2008-06-07T15:13:00.000Z	YuLin	danza	ok, thanks. So: I have a text file with some lines ending with a tab but not always. How do I remove that?
