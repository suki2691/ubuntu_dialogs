2007-06-27T07:47:00.000Z	newtubuntu		I'm planning to use 200/320Gb for a shared FAT32 partition, then the remaining 120Gb is for Ubuntu which will run 1 virtual machine of... say 10Gb max (enough!)
2007-06-27T07:47:00.000Z	newtubuntu		how should I split my diskspace between / and /home ?
2007-06-27T07:48:00.000Z	newtubuntu		if I plan using 120Gb for Ubuntu, I should I split it between / and /home ?
2007-06-27T07:48:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	newtubuntu	how about....30/90 for / and /home?
