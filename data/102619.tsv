2008-12-01T23:05:00.000Z	matitaccia		hello. is it possible that transmission is working with slow performance although I have opened the port?
2008-12-01T23:06:00.000Z	rww	matitaccia	try a different client. I had problems like that with Transmission and switched to deluge-torrent
2008-12-01T23:08:00.000Z	matitaccia	rww	Rainarrow ? so what should I do? I'll try with the new client, the deluge one.
2008-12-01T23:09:00.000Z	rww	matitaccia	well, try it out and see. Worst case scenario it doesn't help =/. package name is deluge-torrent, install with sudo apt-get install deluge-torrent or via Synaptic.
