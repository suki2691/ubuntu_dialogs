2008-11-09T15:12:00.000Z	matt70		hi, has anyone switched from 8.04 32bit to 64? I'm looking for an "upgrade" option that will do that in syaptic rather than reinstalling
2008-11-09T15:13:00.000Z	bazhang	matt70	there is no such option
2008-11-09T15:13:00.000Z	matt70	bazhang	so.... reinstall is the only option?
2008-11-09T15:14:00.000Z	bazhang	matt70	to change from 32bit to 64bit? Yes
