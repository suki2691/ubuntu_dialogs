2011-11-11T00:00:00.000Z	r4y		I have one last question
2011-11-11T00:00:00.000Z	r4y		What's the difference with the alt download and desktop?
2011-11-11T00:01:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	r4y	the alt download will have a textual instalation process... not graphic... that uses less memory
2011-11-11T00:01:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	r4y	you could also try minor tweaks to adjust to your needs a little easier
