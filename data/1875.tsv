2012-07-20T19:38:00.000Z	dcullen_	L3top	I was just getting my head wrapped around ALSA (I did some driver work to get a TI codec working on a custom Atmel board) when Pulse came along
2012-07-20T19:39:00.000Z	dcullen_	L3top	What do you think is behind all of this "different account" business?
2012-07-20T19:40:00.000Z	L3top	dcullen_	The modules aren't being loaded is my guess.. but it is a blind one. Very weird situation. I beleive jack may be a depends of pulse. I deal only with alsa directly.
