2007-06-03T07:22:00.000Z	Wolydarg		Grub is showing two copies of both the Ubuntu kernel and the recovery mode, is there anyway to fix this?
2007-06-03T07:23:00.000Z	Flannel	Wolydarg	Two copies are probably different kernel versions.  That's normal
2007-06-03T07:23:00.000Z	Wolydarg	Flannel	both are identical, and both options brings me to the same screen
2007-06-03T07:24:00.000Z	Flannel	Wolydarg	they'll both boot Ubuntu, yes.  Are you sure they're identical?  Pastebin your menu.lst (/boot/grub/menu.lst)
