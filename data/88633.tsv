2008-12-29T13:04:00.000Z	Arelis		Hello people. I have had a mac for about one year now and have previously been using Ubuntu. I have stopped using Ubuntu because the sudden problems it caused were eating away my time. They were hardware problems, from my other pc. I want to try out Ubuntu on my Mac, see how it goes there. But i do not want to damage anything, that means no dual boot. Something like Wubi. How do i install ubuntu safely?
2008-12-29T13:05:00.000Z	Arelis		Anyone?
2008-12-29T13:06:00.000Z	Sa[i]nT	Arelis	Get a real computer.
2008-12-29T13:06:00.000Z	Arelis	Sa[i]nT	Gee, thanks for the support. I have a mac now.
