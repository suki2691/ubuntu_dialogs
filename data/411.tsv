2012-11-14T18:43:00.000Z	Ben64		I upgraded from 10.04 to 12.04, and now I can't delete in gcalctool
2012-11-14T18:43:00.000Z	tomatopotato	Ben64	just wondering why not to 12.10
2012-11-14T18:43:00.000Z	Ben64		the old hardy man page, http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man1/gcalctool.1.html says "delete" clears the screen, but it doesn't
2012-11-14T18:43:00.000Z	Ben64	tomatopotato	because LTS are good
