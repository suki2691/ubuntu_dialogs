2007-07-29T15:43:00.000Z	greendragon	jowi	i have no idea about beryl or compiz..  i just installed edubuntu today...  my windows hard drive crashed.  so I wanted to reload anyways so finally felt today was a good day to go linux...
2007-07-29T15:44:00.000Z	Jowi	greendragon	ok. without having any details i would guess that you have a problem with your video driver. what video card do you have?
