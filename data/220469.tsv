2007-02-25T13:53:00.000Z	Flannel	Sayers	packages.ubuntu.com is a nice interface to it
2007-02-25T13:54:00.000Z	Flannel	Sayers	no.  Warty is the oldest.  Edgy is 6.10, Dapper is 6.06
2007-02-25T13:54:00.000Z	Flannel	Sayers	you can also do searching using Synaptic, on your own computer.  Which is how you'd install anyway, so it works out like that
