2009-08-14T06:45:00.000Z	donavan_		I want to install a program in wine and all the howtos are for 32bit and in running 64bit ... does wine care ?
2009-08-14T06:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	donavan_	 dosent care here... 'wine path/to/program.exe' works for me.
2009-08-14T06:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	donavan_	 64bit wine works fine for me  so far.
2009-08-14T06:46:00.000Z	donavan_	Dr_Willis	... cool thanks
