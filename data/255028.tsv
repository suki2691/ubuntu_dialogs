2005-03-06T13:26:00.000Z	entius		Hi, i have added repository  ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/  but synaptic can't connect!
2005-03-06T13:26:00.000Z	entius		is that repository down? or i am configuring it badly?
2005-03-06T12:33:00.000Z	entius		To allow FTP through IPTABLES, it is enough to open source and destination ports 20 and 21, right? i cannot access to ftp repositories debian-marillat with synaptic and i guess it is an iptables bad configuration ...
