Doesn´t send any error message. Just freeze. I tryied to restart, launch in "safety mode", but nothing seems to work. I started the live cd, it worked ok, but there´s no recovery option. I don´t have a clue of what to do... I removed the splash screen, but didn´t see anything wrong.. I think that if there´s a way to see
