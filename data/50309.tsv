2009-09-04T23:44:00.000Z	userone		i had an 9.04 iso image on my hdd. i extracted the files to a folder. i copied these files to a usb. i tried to use this usb to install ubuntu on a netbook, but it said no boot partition found. why didnt this work?
2009-09-04T23:45:00.000Z	Ben64	userone	thats not how to make anything bootable
2009-09-04T23:47:00.000Z	userone	Ben64	h4f: so how can i use an existing iso file (rather than download an img file and use usb-imagewriter) to make a bootable usb?
