2007-06-17T07:50:00.000Z	whyameye		I have a running box with Dapper on it. If I take the disk out of it and stick it in a different box (different brand name, video card, etc.) is it going to work or do I have to start from "scratch" on the new box?
2007-06-17T07:51:00.000Z	heroin	whyameye	huh u can install ubuntu on it assuming its also a i368 processor
2007-06-17T07:52:00.000Z	whyameye	heroin	but I'm saying to stick the old disk in the new machine as is
