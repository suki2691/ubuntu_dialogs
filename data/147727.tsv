2007-02-07T10:15:00.000Z	oljanx	Jordan_U	 Thanks, I'll try it out on a system with no important data first.
2007-02-07T10:16:00.000Z	oljanx		has anyone used and experienced trouble with ntfs-3g before?
2007-02-07T10:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	oljanx	According to the site there are no known problems with it but it has some limitations ( for esoteric things you probably don't need ) I would read the wiki
