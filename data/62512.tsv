2010-01-03T19:12:00.000Z	somnium		Hi, Im running 9.10 64-bit on dual core with 4g ram, several times now its maxed 6g of swap space (while ram is reportedly in 3.6-3.8 range), and X all but locks up
2010-01-03T19:13:00.000Z	somnium		are there any known issues/fixes? (Im considering switching to 32-bit), I used 32-bit 9.04 without ever such a problem before
2010-01-03T19:15:00.000Z	iceroot	somnium	64bit is working fine like 32bit
2010-01-03T19:15:00.000Z	iceroot	somnium	also with flash and java
