2008-08-26T21:32:00.000Z	yoshi		hello. i forgot the password for a username in ubuntu (installed with wubi). is there any way to recover/reset it ?
2008-08-26T21:32:00.000Z	jrib	yoshi	do you get a grub menu when you start wubi that lets you get to recovery mode?
2008-08-26T21:33:00.000Z	jrib	yoshi	ask the wubi channel how to get to recovery mode
2008-08-26T21:34:00.000Z	jrib	yoshi	I don't see a channel, try their forums if no one here knows
