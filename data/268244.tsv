2004-10-19T09:43:00.000Z	mir		I have just installed Ubuntu Linux, updated it with the latest patches etc... most things did go well.. howevery, videoplayback is not working.. I either get a black screen in totem, and with the voice working, or a error msg depending on what type of media file, the error is probably related to the codec not being installed, thats ok... but the blackscreen thing is not.. Anyone got an idea?
2004-10-19T09:44:00.000Z	mir		No one here?
2004-10-19T09:44:00.000Z	mir		oki.. I'll return later then
