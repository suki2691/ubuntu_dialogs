2008-11-04T01:19:00.000Z	Mullethunt		Hello. I recently installed Ubuntu 8.10 and I cannot get my dual monitors set up properly. I have my dual monitors set up for Separate X, but I cannot choose the option twinview. Is there anyone that can try and help me out?
2008-11-04T01:20:00.000Z	Hideme	Mullethunt	where are you setting that?
2008-11-04T01:20:00.000Z	Mullethunt	Hideme	in nvidia-settings.
2008-11-04T01:24:00.000Z	Mullethunt	Hideme	anything else?
