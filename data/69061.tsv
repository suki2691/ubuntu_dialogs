2009-11-01T03:03:00.000Z	_dean		any reason for this
2009-11-01T03:05:00.000Z	soreau	_dean	Sounds like compiz may be crashing which could be caused by a number of things. The prime culprit is typically the graphics driver
2009-11-01T03:05:00.000Z	_dean	soreau	maybe install the unstable ppa compiz repository maybe
