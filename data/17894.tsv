2011-02-20T06:48:00.000Z	Tookish		Hi.  Have a little audio problem, hoping for help.
2011-02-20T06:49:00.000Z	Tookish		Using 10.04, Dell Inspiron 9200 laptop. Sound Preferences>Output shows "Analog Out" and "Analog Out (LFE)" as separate connectors.  Would prefer built in speakers AND build in sub to be on, not one or the other.  Any ideas?
