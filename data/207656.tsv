2005-11-16T08:10:00.000Z	edoardo		you guys, i'm the author of an audio conversion script named audio-convert. you might have read about it in the ubuntu forums. anyway, it's becomin' really popular lately. would anyone help me make a .deb? it's two files only, so it's probably not that hard. anyone? thankyou! : )
2005-11-16T08:12:00.000Z	gord_	edoardo	does your script do a lot of files at once? iv been meening to convert my mp3 collection to ogg for a long time but have been put off because the only auto things i can find don't copy over the ide info
2005-11-16T08:13:00.000Z	edoardo	gord_	it does that, very easily. it even copies the metatags on to the new files. follow the link and you'll find out! : )
