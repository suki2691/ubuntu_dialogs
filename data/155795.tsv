2007-05-01T12:26:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		I'm having an issue booting into Ubuntu after install, Ubuntu just hangs, recovery console shows that it stops at loading at drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c v2.6:USB HID core driver
2007-05-01T12:26:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		I tried to reinstall with a different cd and the same problem using 7.04
2007-05-01T12:26:00.000Z	PrimoTurbo		pls I need a way to fix this!!! What's odd is that I installed 7.04 a few days before and it worked! Now the same cd and new cds don't work there is a problem
2007-05-01T12:28:00.000Z	killermach_	PrimoTurbo	do you have any memcards in the USB?
