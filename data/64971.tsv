2011-06-18T03:33:00.000Z	oraqol		i have an hp dv4 laptop, i upgraded to 11.04 over wire but i hate unity so i reformatted and reverted to 10.10, worked fine for a few days, then i did something (not sure what) and now it will boot up to black screen.  Not blank, black, as in no power to lcd.  If i plug in vga monitor it recognizes it.  No amount of jiggling helps.  Eventually after I reboot enough the lcd comes back up.  I doubt its hardware.  Any ideas?
