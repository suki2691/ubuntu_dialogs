2010-03-14T13:15:00.000Z	Nulpoints	wgrant	Oh, sorry. Can you point me in the right direction? I have googled the hell out of this question, and most of what i find says that there should not be a problem and is literally plug and play.

2010-03-14T13:17:00.000Z	Nulpoints	wgrant	Oh yeah, does having the problem with virtualbox make it better? cuz i'm sure it's the same problem?
