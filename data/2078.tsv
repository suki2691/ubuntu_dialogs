2012-07-11T00:03:00.000Z	stiv2k		i legitimately think ubuntu should make the window borders thicker........
2012-07-11T00:03:00.000Z	stiv2k		resizing is hard!
2012-07-11T00:05:00.000Z	stiv2k		why must people have to show me 6 different alternate ways of resizing? why can you just make the window border a little thicker so i can resize the normal way? the way every other OS in the world is?
2012-07-11T00:06:00.000Z	zixxy	stiv2k	well I would assume because they're trying to help you and most likely have no part of the development of Ubuntu...
