2008-06-27T23:22:00.000Z	vlt		Hello. I try to `resize2fs /dev/hda1` which is an ext3 fs mounted on "/". But I get "resize2fs: Filesystem does not support online resizing" which doesn't match the man page's "the Linux 2.6 kernel supports on-line resize for filesystems mounted using ext3" very well. Any idea what to do?

2008-06-27T23:26:00.000Z	vlt	ASULutzy	I have no CD drive.
2008-06-27T23:27:00.000Z	vlt	ASULutzy	I think I'll have to debootstrap and boot another installation ...
