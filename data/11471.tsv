2012-05-24T00:01:00.000Z	GunshipJelly		Hello Ubuntians, former ubuntu user here, back from the dead.    Have a noob question for anyone who feels they have the gusto to answer it.
2012-05-24T00:03:00.000Z	GunshipJelly		If i choose the option to use the windows installer to install ubuntu.   Is ubuntu running within windows (meaning it'll run slower and have limitations vs a full clean installation)  or is the computer essentially duel booting the two OSs...?
