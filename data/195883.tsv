2006-03-14T07:26:00.000Z	Tom_Kidd		I'm playing Unreal Tournament 2004, and I've set my Anti-Aliasing to 8x and my Antistropic to 16x via nvidia-settings. Yet I seriously doubt it's actually working, is UT2004 overriding my settings or something?
2006-03-14T07:27:00.000Z	Tom_Kidd		nvidia-glx-config enable?
2006-03-14T07:28:00.000Z	Zenethian	Tom_Kidd	In general I find that UT never obeys the AF or AA settings.
2006-03-14T07:29:00.000Z	Zenethian	Tom_Kidd	Heh, I have the same card.  I turn all the settings pretty low.
