2008-03-14T04:56:00.000Z	xp_prg		anyone want to help me with creation of a vmware image of a small program I made for an opensource project?
2008-03-14T04:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	xp_prg	 a vmware image is normally for a whole OS. Not just a program.   There are premade ubuntu  and jeos vmware images at the vmware appliance web site.
2008-03-14T04:59:00.000Z	xp_prg	Dr_willis	I know that, my laptop does not have enough memory to make one though, I need your help
