2006-11-10T13:47:00.000Z	Adnarim		is there a shortcut in ubuntu to change between the different desktops?
2006-11-10T13:48:00.000Z	Pelo	Adnarim	 you mean between  gnome and kde ? or between workspaces ?
2006-11-10T13:50:00.000Z	Pelo	Adnarim	look under system > preferences > keyboard shortcuts,  if there isn'T one you can specify your own
