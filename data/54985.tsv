2009-07-27T03:58:00.000Z	neohashi		hmm did a driver update on 9.04 using nvidias installer 185.x and now I get this error: Screen(s) found, but none have a usable configuration.. what should I do.
2009-07-27T04:00:00.000Z	ctmjr	neohashi	run sudo nvidia-xconfig in a terminal then reboot see if that fixes it
2009-07-27T04:14:00.000Z	ctmjr	neohashi	when you said upgraded what driver did you have before that?
2009-07-27T04:18:00.000Z	ctmjr	neohashi	did you uninstall it first before installing the new driver if not you need to uninstall everything and reinstall
