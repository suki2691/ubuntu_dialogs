2007-06-20T09:56:00.000Z	aurynn		Q: Is it worth it to fight to get ubuntu x86-64 working, or should I go with works-without-many-issues-32 bit?
2007-06-20T09:57:00.000Z	aurynn		well, 64-bit was more of a "because I can"
2007-06-20T09:58:00.000Z	aurynn		my system maxes at 2gb, so that's not an issue
2007-06-20T09:59:00.000Z	Tom47	aurynn	its a moot point .... check out the issue in ubuntuforums where its been discussed adnauseum
