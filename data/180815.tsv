2006-06-16T15:45:00.000Z	BIAF		hi all : Does the server build of ubuntu provide gnome as well as command line?
2006-06-16T15:45:00.000Z	dysmind	BIAF	only if you apt-get install gnome
2006-06-16T15:46:00.000Z	dysmind	BIAF	though I'd apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2006-06-16T15:47:00.000Z	dysmind	BIAF	try xubuntu-desktop then. XFCE is lighter than gnome.
