2005-11-21T08:38:00.000Z	mae		i'm building a new system -- what is your guys opinions on ati vs nvidia?
2005-11-21T08:40:00.000Z	mae		really now -- from what i've heard ati has decent linux drivers now -- and even some of the new x800 chipsets have an opensource driver available r300
2005-11-21T08:42:00.000Z	mae		from a functional perspective nvidia is better support -- but from a semantic viewpoint ati has tried harder in the past .
