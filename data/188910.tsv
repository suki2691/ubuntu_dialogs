2006-06-18T12:24:00.000Z	Lynoure	digivore	it's not, necessarily, many distros are good, just different

2006-06-18T12:43:00.000Z	Lynoure	digivore	 Can you rephrase that question? What are you trying to run? (What is executable depends on many things and often executable stuff does not have any special thing in their name unlike with windows .exe.)
