2012-01-05T18:06:00.000Z	mackminer		Guys, I have an issue where my ubuntu machine keeps switching itself off! Can you someone point me to where I can check logs for the possible reason?
2012-01-05T18:07:00.000Z	txm	mackminer	try dmesg - depending what the problem is, you may not see anything useful
2012-01-05T18:09:00.000Z	mackminer	txm	vega- It's one of four servers and I think the issue may be related to power draw. Was hoping I could find a reason in the logs. How would I search for such a thing txm within dmesg?
