2005-07-10T16:00:00.000Z	cheezee		why? .13 is so beautiful
2005-07-10T16:01:00.000Z	eyequeue	cheezee	 it needs to be thoroughly tested agsinst everything else to be a default kernel ... all architechtures and such ... if .13 has something important, it might go in, or have that driver/feature backported to .12 i guess
2005-07-10T16:02:00.000Z	eyequeue	cheezee	 basically the point is "well-tested on everything" so that "it just works" for newbies, etc
2005-07-10T16:03:00.000Z	cheezee	eyequeue	thanks.. i understand
