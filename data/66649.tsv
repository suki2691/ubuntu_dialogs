2009-04-18T10:03:00.000Z	rainofkayos	donavan01	citrix does have an application that does RDP like a terminal server.. but they have many applications.. i need the web client to load a portal app
2009-04-18T10:05:00.000Z	donavan01	rainofkayos	 gotcha ... like I said its been a while ... last time I really used citrix was back in the nt4.0 days wiht metaframe ... and a little in 2000
