2009-11-10T13:48:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	dczammit	that's what i did before, the problem as i told you and you should be enought intelligent to understand it, it's not the same to boot on a 750 mb compressed file than a 2 giga installed ubuntu, they are both working on all computers and i install grub on the usb pen drive so i can directly mount iso from the grub 2 now and have the live cd to install the ubuntu if i want it, like i have my xubuntu personnal (better
2009-11-10T13:49:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	dczammit	means i can put xubuntu + entrie of xubuntu live cd.iso + entrie of knopix (example), + entrie of windows seven + entrie of even mac os x snow leopard
