2008-07-28T05:04:00.000Z	Shpook		Okay, i think I really screwed my system up this time. I dropped my laptop, and now I'm having all sorts of problems. It won't connect to any wireless networks, it won't load the x server on a soft reboot, it randomly freezes for 3-5 minutes at a time, programs will open but only display an empty window, and gives an unable to resolve error. Not to mention I can't open anything that requires root privelages. Where do I start?
