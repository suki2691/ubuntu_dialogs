2009-04-26T00:39:00.000Z	KYWL		hi, I'm trying to compile Conky but it keeps telling me that my X11 can not be located any ideas?
2009-04-26T00:41:00.000Z	KYWL		I've also tried apt-get x11-common but that was already installed, so what am I missing?
2009-04-26T00:43:00.000Z	hbekel	KYWL	got x-dev and libx11-dev?
2009-04-26T00:44:00.000Z	KYWL	hbekel	no I'll try
