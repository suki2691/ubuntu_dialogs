2010-10-10T07:15:00.000Z	Mathuin		Hrm.  What's the best way to determine whether I should be using the AMD64 build of Ubuntu instead of the 32-bit?

2010-10-10T07:17:00.000Z	blakkheim	Mathuin	possibly
2010-10-10T08:38:00.000Z	Mathuin	blakkheim	I use apt-get because Ubuntu recommends it when I run a command.  If xpdf isn't installed, Ubuntu says to type 'sudo apt-get install xpdf'.
