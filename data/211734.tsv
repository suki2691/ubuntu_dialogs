2007-05-07T14:36:00.000Z	Idle		I'm trying to get the latest (7.04) installed, but it just seems to hang forver, and I dont seem to have any interfaces to figure out why its stalling
2007-05-07T14:38:00.000Z	Idle		does anyone know of a way to get a terminal so I can figure out why this installer is hanging?
2007-05-07T14:40:00.000Z	Idle		damnit, I should just switch to anything else... ubuntu seems too moron friendly, so when something breaks, its no better then windows
2007-05-07T14:40:00.000Z	raf256	Idle	its debian, as easy to fix I think
