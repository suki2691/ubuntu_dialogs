2010-10-24T10:14:00.000Z	riPPerMD		I have a Dell Inspiron 1546. The usb ports do not work even with clean install of 10.10. lsusb shows nothing. Any ideas?
2010-10-24T10:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	riPPerMD	 they work on the live cd? have they ever worked with any linux?
2010-10-24T10:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	riPPerMD	 havent tried in 10.04 eh?
2010-10-24T10:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	riPPerMD	 you could check the modules loaded with 9.10 and compare to the ones in 10.10  perhaps a module is not getting autoloaded properly
