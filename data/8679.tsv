2011-10-30T03:47:00.000Z	ejv	zacarias	development mailing lists, ubuntu brainstorm, and launchpad are places to go to start a conversation like that
2011-10-30T03:48:00.000Z	ejv	zacarias	the culture of open source development is such that, nobody will *do* the work for you; if you show initiative, write your own code, and work hard, you CAN make things happen
