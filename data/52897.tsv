2009-08-28T02:30:00.000Z	i00nsu		In a LAN with 5 computers-clients and 1 server, I want to set up a DNS in the Server machine, so I can write the machine name in the browser, instead of writing the IP? .. I know that is the DNS configuration, but I need to configure that in the Server or in all machines-clients?

2009-08-28T02:31:00.000Z	i00nsu	moymoy	purplenurple,  in the Server machine or in all client machines?
