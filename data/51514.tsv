I'd play around with the root entries in your menu.lst (assuming we've gotten to the menu.lst?)  If you don't see a menu.lst, then you've got a similar problem, albeit earlier, where stage1 isn't finding your boot stuff (isn't finding stage 2)
2009-08-02T00:10:00.000Z	Bjornlaf	Flannel	i have a menu.lst, the uuid's and entries look correct. I've tried manually setting grub again to hd2,1 which is the partition i installed the os to
2009-08-02T00:11:00.000Z	Bjornlaf	Flannel	my primary hdd is /dev/sdc and it's partitioned into /dev/sdc1 <2gb swap> and /dev/sdc2 <118gb />
2009-08-02T00:23:00.000Z	Bjornlaf	Flannel	any more suggestions? i've even tried doing root (hd2,1) and setup (hd0) and that still gets me the error 15 after it says Grub Loading Stage 1.5.
