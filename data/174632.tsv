2008-12-09T16:12:00.000Z	mountaindew		Hi all, I have been using Ubuntu 8.10 and vlc to watch mp4 movies with no problem, but lately I have been having problem, vlc seems to show only blue screen and sound but nothing else, same case with totem player, the mp4 file seems to play ok on xp.
2008-12-09T16:13:00.000Z	mountaindew		totem asked me to install the codecs (2 choices) and I installed both.
