2006-08-24T09:19:00.000Z	Berto	Warbo	awesome, thanks.  that's what I was wondering -- if there's a NO FORMAT option.  i'd flip out if it formatted my stuff
2006-08-24T09:20:00.000Z	Warbo	Berto	There is a page on the installer just after the manual partition editor (I assume you are going to do it manually) which lets you set each partition's mount point and whether it should be formatted. (I have only done it with manual, it may be available on automatic I don't know)
2006-08-24T09:21:00.000Z	Berto	Warbo	perfect, i'm confident now.  i can figure out the rest.
