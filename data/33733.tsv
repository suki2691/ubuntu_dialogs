2010-09-19T05:05:00.000Z	teepark		on my wife's laptop, since upgrading to 10.4 the network manager applet has been missing from the notification area. it has a nm-applet process running but its just not showing up. has anyone seen this before / is it a known problem?
2010-09-19T05:06:00.000Z	uLinux	teepark	did u try to reinstall the applet
2010-09-19T05:08:00.000Z	uLinux	teepark	just a silly question.. is it starting up on boot? (startup applications
2010-09-19T05:10:00.000Z	uLinux	teepark	maybe it's a panel bug?
