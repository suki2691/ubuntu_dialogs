2007-10-28T20:50:00.000Z	larson9999	riotkittie	yeah, that's why i didn't try envy.  but finally, i figured if i was going to reinstall from scratch there wasn't much worry to me about envy messing up my system.  but it didn't.  and none advice i got from here or forums worked.
2007-10-28T20:52:00.000Z	larson9999	riotkittie	and i never found out what envy could mess up.  folks here said the same thing about the other app that's similar to envy and it never messed any of my systems up either.
