2010-06-29T08:58:00.000Z	bsmith093		im trying to connect to a windows network and samba ( or whatever i use when i open the network folder) says cannot get share list from server
2010-06-29T08:59:00.000Z	codebrainz	bsmith093	did you try the Connect to Server... option?  that's what I usually use for gui samba
2010-06-29T09:02:00.000Z	codebrainz	bsmith093	i can't help much, I never had much luck with any samba/cifs GUI programs I just end up putting the mounts in /etc/fstab so it 'just works' and then I forget all about it :)
2010-06-29T09:03:00.000Z	codebrainz	bsmith093	it's *supposed* to work with hostnames I believe
