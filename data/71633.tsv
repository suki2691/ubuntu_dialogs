2010-10-07T22:01:00.000Z	sc30317		 I want to setup my own debian x86 repository locally.  There seems to be bunch of different documentation on how to do this.  Has anyone done this recently, and have any advice?
2010-10-07T22:02:00.000Z	sc30317		but if I could have it update as well that would be cool

2010-10-07T22:03:00.000Z	sc30317	erUSUL	they didn't answer my question (yet)
