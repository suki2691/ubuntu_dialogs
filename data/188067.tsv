2006-08-09T15:46:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	Kronospyder	yep
2006-08-09T15:48:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	Kronospyder	the alternate install cd is for you I think, just make sure to grab the 64bit version
2006-08-10T16:01:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	Kronospyder	the alternate install cd IS the full OS, just a different install method (customisable)
