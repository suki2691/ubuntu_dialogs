2008-05-28T03:15:00.000Z	alt12	ixion	wouldn't that be my router?
2008-05-28T03:16:00.000Z	ixion	alt12	depends on the size of the network.... if when you try communicate via a hostname its resolving the old IP address it means that DNS has not updated... reboot whatever might be your DNS server
2008-05-28T03:16:00.000Z	alt12	ixion	ok.. what if i don't have a dns server?
