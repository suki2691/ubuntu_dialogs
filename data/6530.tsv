2012-01-09T10:52:00.000Z	wickedwiccan	Ben64	I did it flashed there are drivers for your system i clicked it and told it to install and it gave me an error.  Mint done the same thing, odd thing though is the drivers do install and function its just jockey keeps saying they are not activated
2012-01-09T10:53:00.000Z	Ben64	wickedwiccan	what error
