2008-01-29T21:26:00.000Z	gvsa123		i made a text file with ntpdate -u ntp.ubuntu.com inside it... saved it in a directory
2008-01-29T21:27:00.000Z	sluggo	gvsa123	you might be better off installing ntp
2008-01-29T21:27:00.000Z	gvsa123	sluggo	i had problems with it because it needs the -u option to update automatically... i believe i have it installed already
2008-01-29T21:28:00.000Z	gvsa123	sluggo	i also want to try cronjobs out... :)
