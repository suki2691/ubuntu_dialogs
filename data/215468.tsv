2008-09-11T20:22:00.000Z	UbuntuWizkid		Hello All, Has anyone here tried to build Ubuntu server only to find that they can't get startx to work?
2008-09-11T20:24:00.000Z	soundray	UbuntuWizkid	server comes without X, so it's no surprise that startx doesn't work
2008-09-11T20:26:00.000Z	soundray	UbuntuWizkid	so startx does work
2008-09-11T20:27:00.000Z	soundray	UbuntuWizkid	if you want a complete desktop environment, install ubuntu-desktop  (but why, then, did you choose server?)
