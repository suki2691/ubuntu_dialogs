2009-06-22T23:30:00.000Z	Galbadore		Anyone know why when I plug in a WD 1 TB ethernet My Book into a Cisco switch and if I get dhcp from the switch it works fine, but if it gets dhcp from Ubuntu 7.10 server it works for 20-30 pings and then quits.
2009-06-22T23:30:00.000Z	Galbadore		No network connectivity
2009-06-22T23:30:00.000Z	cabrey	Galbadore	try #ubuntu-server and for goodness sakes, update
2009-06-22T23:35:00.000Z	cabrey	Galbadore	go to 8.04 rather than 8.10
