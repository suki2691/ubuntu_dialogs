2007-06-26T14:33:00.000Z	fuzzy_logic	sparrw	ubuntu can't run on a kernel that isn't linux
2007-06-26T14:36:00.000Z	sparrw	fuzzy_logic	im curious if you would be willing to bet on that?  :)
2007-06-26T14:48:00.000Z	sparrw	fuzzy_logic	since debian will run on other kernels, i would be surprised if you cant get ubuntu to do the same
