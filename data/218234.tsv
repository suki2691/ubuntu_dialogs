2006-04-21T16:21:00.000Z	obscurite	Stormx2	- sometimes sound cuts out on my lappy too. Usually a reboot fixes it. It seems applications are fighting over control of the sound. Did you just install anything?
2006-04-21T16:22:00.000Z	Stormx2	obscurite	No, well, a new version of the media player, but I doubt that did it.
2006-04-21T16:23:00.000Z	obscurite	Stormx2	- nice job
