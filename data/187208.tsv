2010-10-22T22:49:00.000Z	sideone		hey all. i am about to build a new router under ubuntu. I had worked with PFsense and other, but couldtn get everything i wanted out of the packages. I chose 10.10 server edition for my base. Does anyone have a good faq on setting up ubuntu with a scope on higher performance routing, fw, kern/sys ctl tweeking, and hardening?

2010-10-22T22:51:00.000Z	ikonia	sideone	that's just common sense stuff, eg: hdparm sets disk access speed, set that up as you see fit
