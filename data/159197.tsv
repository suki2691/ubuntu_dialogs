2007-09-07T06:16:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm		does anyone know how to completely reset wireless configuration? i want a clean slate.... my wireless is a mess... it will not obtain ips from open access points (like my school's) consistently. its driving me crazy and im considering reinstalling... but maybe there is a better way to fix this... reinstalling all of my applications and what not between problem sets and stuff.... not such a good idea. any suggestions?

2007-09-07T06:17:00.000Z	radioaktivstorm	DjViper	yes i do. however, i would rather not have to reinstall all of my junk
