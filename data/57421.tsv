2009-05-14T15:35:00.000Z	swiftarrow		Hey, How can I find a file book.cls somewhere in my filesystem?  find book.cls says it doesn't exist, but latex is able to use it.  This is driving me nuts...

2009-05-14T15:37:00.000Z	Kalmi	swiftarrow	find is a bit tricky...
2009-05-14T15:40:00.000Z	Kalmi	swiftarrow	you have to use find like this: find -name book.cls
