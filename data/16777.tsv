2011-12-06T00:57:00.000Z	kz3		what are going to be the best features in ubuntu 12.04?
2011-12-06T00:58:00.000Z	AlanBell	kz3	it will be much like 11.10, but more polished and stable
2011-12-06T00:59:00.000Z	kz3	AlanBell	I am very unhappy with 11.10, its not that stable and I have also stopped using unity. I use GNOME 3.2
2011-12-06T00:59:00.000Z	AlanBell	kz3	maybe give precise a spin and file bugs (and talk in #ubuntu+1 about it)
