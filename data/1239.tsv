2012-09-06T23:34:00.000Z	pcbsdl1	hlpme	Download the text based installer and you can easily skip certain steps
2012-09-06T23:44:00.000Z	hlpme	pcbsdl1	I've reinstalled many times and it either makes it worse (borks bootloader) or does nothing. I might try a console installation next, if it's not too hard.
