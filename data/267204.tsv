2010-02-28T12:24:00.000Z	zane		i just had to turn my compiz off to get my vnc to work
2010-02-28T12:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	zane	 vnc and compiz = not a good combo :)
2010-02-28T12:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	zane	 i use a dedicated vnc server like tightvnc.  and i dont normally share the 'current' desktop
2010-02-28T12:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	zane	 also lighter windowmanager/desktops are better for vnc
