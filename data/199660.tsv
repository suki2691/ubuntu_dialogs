2006-04-08T05:42:00.000Z	happyponcho42		hi, my Ubuntu server keeps rebooting at random intervals.  I've never dealt with system logs before, so which logs should I take a look at to determine the source?
2006-04-08T05:44:00.000Z	bimberi	happyponcho42	/var/log is the place to look around, try /var/log/messages
2006-04-08T05:45:00.000Z	happyponcho42	bimberi	is there anything specific i should look out for?
2006-04-08T05:45:00.000Z	bimberi	happyponcho42	i don't know sorry, search for 'Error' perhaps
