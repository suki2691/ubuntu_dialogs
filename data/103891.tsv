2010-11-01T09:37:00.000Z	anolis		there was this program i used to use for monitoring changes to a script, and i cant for the life of me remember what it was called. It would refresh new data on the console and leave the old info there
2010-11-01T09:37:00.000Z	anolis		does anyone know the name of this utility

2010-11-01T09:40:00.000Z	anolis	ActionParsnip	well no im not looking for an IDS, it was a console app that would essentially run any given script repeatedly, updating the fields that were changed
