2006-09-21T10:30:00.000Z	voraistos		hello huys. I wanted to know how to install a different GL theme for gnome? (using aiglX) By the way if there is someplace where i can find info about what GTK 1 and 2 , compiz and metacity exactly are, that would help;) cheers
2006-09-21T10:31:00.000Z	voraistos		yeah; no problem, except that i am not using XGL

2006-09-21T10:35:00.000Z	voraistos	jcml_uk	thanks mate. I was wondering, how can i relook old GTK 1 apps without changing all my system's theme (which i prefer to be GTK2). they also talk about GTK engines. cant get it. and yes i googled, but couldnt understand. that why i was asking around here ;)
