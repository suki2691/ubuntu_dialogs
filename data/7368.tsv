2011-12-04T03:51:00.000Z	mattalexx		In Firefox in Natty, I'm having a performance problem. I disabled all plugins and extensions, loaded this page: http://preview.tinyurl.com/7lg396z , And middle-clicked any of the links to products on that page. It's over two seconds before a new tab appears and starts to load. Can anyone please confirm on their installs?

2011-12-04T03:53:00.000Z	mactrent	mattalexx	How many tabs do you have?
2011-12-04T04:03:00.000Z	mattalexx	mactrent	1 tab. Still happening in safe mode.
