2012-06-16T00:14:00.000Z	andai1		I have my home folder on the same partition as everything else. I want to do a fresh install but keep all my stuff ( user preferences etc )
2012-06-16T00:14:00.000Z	andai1		Should I use a new username for this install, or is it safe to use an existing one?

2012-06-16T00:15:00.000Z	gigix	andai1	and create a separate /home directory on your next install
