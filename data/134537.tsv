2007-08-03T07:58:00.000Z	lazz		I was looking for info about running a command with or without ./
2007-08-03T07:59:00.000Z	DWSR	lazz	./ is sometimes just a formality.
2007-08-03T07:59:00.000Z	DWSR	lazz	It means "in the current directory"
2007-08-03T08:06:00.000Z	DWSR	lazz	Don't worry about it, you don't need to do it for your problem. When you type in ./setup.sh, what error does it come up with?
