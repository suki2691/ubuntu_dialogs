2012-08-22T17:22:00.000Z	Plumblum	Kasir	i honestly have no idea, im guessin files stored there would be if you were to install programs and such when you are booting from your usb key, so if you are going to just boot and play around, i would put 0 if you are going to boot play around and then install on the hdd i would still put 0 but if you are going to use it i would say 1GB or so depends on what you are going to do
