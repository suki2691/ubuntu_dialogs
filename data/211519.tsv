2009-07-14T03:20:00.000Z	hoboman		hello, i have had instability issues with ubuntu for a long time, my hardware is just crappy... i have a problem now, i've re-installed windows to the harddrive, but, it doesnt re-write the boot loader... i've looked at the hdd, its one partition, all ntfs...
2009-07-14T03:21:00.000Z	hoboman		how do i get rid of grub and have it work properly to boot my winxp install?
2009-07-14T03:21:00.000Z	Dulak	hoboman	can you boot windows xp alright?
