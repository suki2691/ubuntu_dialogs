2009-01-12T22:13:00.000Z	oCean_	workingchair	if the win box is configured to let users remote connect, "rdesktop <host>" should work
2009-01-12T22:15:00.000Z	workingchair	oCean_	I'm not exactly sure what to put for <host> though.  I know what the "name" of the computer should be.  is it just that, or do I have to have that in conjunction with a port number, etc...??
