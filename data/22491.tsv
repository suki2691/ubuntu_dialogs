2011-01-20T21:58:00.000Z	bencahill		Hey guys, booting the livecd, i get this error: "Can not mount /dev/loop0 (/cdrom/casper/filesystem.squashfs) on //filesystem.squashfs" any ideas?
2011-01-20T21:58:00.000Z	daedaluz	bencahill	did you verify image integrity on liveCD?
2011-01-20T21:59:00.000Z	bencahill	daedaluz	not this one, but this happens with verified cds also, it's the laptop, weird hardware or something...
2011-01-20T21:59:00.000Z	bencahill	daedaluz	this any clue? "udevd[81]: worker [223] unexpectedly returned with status 0x100"
