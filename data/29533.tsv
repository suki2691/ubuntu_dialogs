2010-07-02T14:08:00.000Z	nunners42		Does anyone have any experience of 10.4 Lucid crashing regularly?  I've installed it about 2 weeks ago, and can't get it stable.  When it crashes the who thing freezes.  Nothing in logs, and no regularity of what it could be.  I've been raising it on the forum (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=9537321) but no luck so far...

2010-07-02T14:10:00.000Z	nunners42	vizzy	tried memory test, nothing found
2010-07-02T14:14:00.000Z	nunners42	vizzy	also tried new installs... thinking maybe need to go backwards in versions and try something a little older?
