2010-07-07T00:19:00.000Z	Roasted	Drknezz	Ive ran FOG on Ubuntu before, which PXE boots systems for imaging.
2010-07-07T00:20:00.000Z	Drknezz	Roasted	im trying to install ubuntu from a tftp server running on windows, problem is, i need to preload drivers for my laptop net hardware
2010-07-07T00:20:00.000Z	Roasted	Drknezz	hmm, wouldnt have any experience there. My experience is the opposite - I use ubuntu as the server, and image windows clients.
