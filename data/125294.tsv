2009-02-20T19:08:00.000Z	josh__		Hey guys, running Heron here on a Dell Inspiron netbook (not sure if that matters), but I can't switch users.   No matter which "switch user" button I hit (directly from the panel or from the "System -> Quit" screen, I just get a black screen and then back to asking for the password of the last user logged in (basically it just locks the screen and never gives me an option to switch users)... anyone have any suggestions on where to start
2009-02-20T19:08:00.000Z	josh__		 to fix it?  i've googled with not much luck....
