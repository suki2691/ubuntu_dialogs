2004-09-26T15:21:00.000Z	xTina		Is it just my system, or does the preview release ISO for PPC reliably crash DiskUtility on Mac OS X when trying to burn?
2004-09-26T15:22:00.000Z	mako	xTina	um.. i've not heard that reported....
2004-09-26T15:23:00.000Z	mako	xTina	but i've not tried to burn with diskutility either
