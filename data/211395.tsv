2005-10-31T09:38:00.000Z	agt		I've done a server install of Ubuntu, then installed the xubuntu-desktop package. I'm having problems getting my iPod to be recognised ... what packages should I install / modules should I modprobe?
2005-10-31T09:39:00.000Z	SEJeff	agt	If you want ipod goodness, use gnome
2005-10-31T09:39:00.000Z	SEJeff	agt	I got an ipod nano yesterday and was surprised when it worked perfectly in gnome
2005-10-31T09:40:00.000Z	agt	SEJeff	yeah I had it working on the default breezy install, I found gnome too slow though :/ thx anyhow
