2007-02-03T10:00:00.000Z	LeeJunFan		are there debs available for edgy for gaim 2.0 b6?
2007-02-03T10:01:00.000Z	blind	LeeJunFan	you can download the rpm from sf and then use alien to turn it into a deb.
2007-02-03T10:02:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	blind	I was worried about not resolving all the deps with that method. worked for you?
2007-02-03T10:02:00.000Z	blind	LeeJunFan	debs don't carry the deps anyways.
