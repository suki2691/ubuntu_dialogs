2009-05-08T04:04:00.000Z	Schiz0|2		I'm running Ubuntu Server in recovery mode to fix a hosed system. I need to transfer files off of it...but I can't find openSSH in order to use SCP. Is there any way I can do this?
2009-05-08T04:04:00.000Z	lupine_85	Schiz0|2	packages openssh-server and openssh-client - if installed, try telinit 2
2009-05-08T04:06:00.000Z	lupine_85	Schiz0|2	no reason why not
2009-05-08T04:14:00.000Z	lupine_85	Schiz0|2	get a beter webhost? ;)
