2008-07-04T13:28:00.000Z	ShaqFu2Fu		Hi, does anybody know how to 'make' a 32 bit program on 64 bit hardy without getting a 'stubs-32.h no such file or directory error?' Is that caused by a missing library?
2008-07-04T13:29:00.000Z	ShaqFu2Fu		I've spent the last 6 hours trying to get Martian to run so I can use an Agere winmodem, no joy yet.
2008-07-04T13:29:00.000Z	unop	ShaqFu2Fu	install the build-essential package
2008-07-04T13:30:00.000Z	unop	ShaqFu2Fu	well, it doesn't appear to have been installed properly -- its the package that has that particular .h file
