2006-01-19T16:36:00.000Z	fluvvell	Steven_M	how expert do you need?
2006-01-19T16:50:00.000Z	fluvvell	Steven_M	if you can't login as root then su - will not work
2006-01-19T16:51:00.000Z	fluvvell	Steven_M	whereas sudo -i will work if you are in the admin group (if you are the only user in ubuntu, this is normally the case)
