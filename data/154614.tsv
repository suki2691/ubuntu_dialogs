2007-01-05T16:56:00.000Z	jontec		I have a major problem. I don't think that my connection is allowing me to upload files. You name it, I haven't been able to upload files to gmail, hotmail, transfer files across my network OR even sftp upload to a computer sitting right beside me! What is going on!?!
2007-01-05T16:56:00.000Z	jontec		this has happened on both my school network and my home network
