2007-12-28T23:42:00.000Z	mahrellon		I need some help. I need shut down X and install a driver through a TTY (I think it's called TTy atleast) but when I try "gdm stop" or "init 3" or just switch to a tty (ctrl+alt+2) I always end up with a blank screen and a blinkin cursor to my upper left. Any ideas what I can do to solve this?
