2007-08-09T10:31:00.000Z	erdteer		I have vmware server running in Ubuntu, I mounted an Image using AcetoneIso, how do tell vmware to select that virtual-drive to install a new OS?
2007-08-09T10:32:00.000Z	MasterShrek	erdteer	you dont need to mount the iso using acetoneiso
2007-08-09T10:33:00.000Z	MasterShrek	erdteer	do you have permissions to the iso?
2007-08-09T10:33:00.000Z	MasterShrek	erdteer	i dont know how a mounted iso would help you
