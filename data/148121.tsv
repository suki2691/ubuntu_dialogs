2007-06-17T10:35:00.000Z	lo4fer		Hi folks. Wifi radar can see the my wireless network so I know the card is at least partly functional, but how do I actually configure the connection? In network tools there's only loopback, eth0, and eth1
2007-06-17T10:35:00.000Z	mage	lo4fer	I've been using a "network-admin" command
2007-06-17T10:36:00.000Z	mage	lo4fer	also my wifi card is eth1 :)
