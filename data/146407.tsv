2007-10-10T09:22:00.000Z	ArtVandalae		I don't think there is a filesystem that doesn't fragment. I mean you could technically implement a non-fragmenting FS, but it would be as slow as hell
2007-10-10T09:23:00.000Z	myconid	ArtVandalae	Actually it wouldnt be slow... but it would have issues if you went over, say, 90% utliziation of the drive
2007-10-10T10:42:00.000Z	myconid	ArtVandalae	are you asking a/s/l?
