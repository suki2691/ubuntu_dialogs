2008-02-20T23:43:00.000Z	luisa	ConstyXIV	go to System>preferences>sound
2008-02-20T23:44:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	luisa	i meant before it boots: i'm installing the livecd in a library, and don't want to PO people
2008-02-20T23:44:00.000Z	luisa	ConstyXIV	go to System>preferences>sound, then choose No Sound for those you dont want sound for
