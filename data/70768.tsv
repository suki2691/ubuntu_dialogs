2009-12-26T19:50:00.000Z	RFXCasey		I have an old machine with a geforce 4 mx and want to know which version of ubuntu or what driver will give the best video performance or directly support that card in general?
2009-12-26T19:51:00.000Z	Slart	RFXCasey	I would try xubuntu for a weaker system
2009-12-26T19:52:00.000Z	Slart	RFXCasey	try 9.10, if that doesn't work.. try with the latest LTS.. !lts for more info on that
2009-12-26T19:54:00.000Z	RFXCasey	Slart	ok thanks
