2010-10-28T19:58:00.000Z	gaelfx	archlich	not that I noticed, what seems to be going wrong?
2010-10-28T19:59:00.000Z	archlich	gaelfx	nothing loads, im not getting any debug output from the console, this is 64bit though
2010-10-28T20:00:00.000Z	gaelfx	archlich	yeah, I use 64-bit too, but FF has been working without a problem (save for flash trouble). try running it from terminal and pastebin the output
