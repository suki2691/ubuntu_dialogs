2007-08-07T06:07:00.000Z	TheCreationist		My friend recently moved to a new apartment and no longer has a wireless internet connection (instead she has a high-speed ethernet connection).  The problem is, Ubuntu no longer connects to the network for her.  It recognizes the ethernet card, but hangs when listening for DHCP.  Anything we can do?

2007-08-07T06:10:00.000Z	TheCreationist	frostburn	Her entire system has been restarted several times.  Even tried restarting the network, but nothing.
2007-08-07T06:11:00.000Z	frostburn	TheCreationist	are you able to access the AP through a wired connection? all i can suggest is seeing if it sees her nic
