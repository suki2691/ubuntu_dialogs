2010-09-12T09:26:00.000Z	norty		So, can I safely rename my SD card back to what it was?
2010-09-12T09:26:00.000Z	norty		Would I just use "mv"
2010-09-12T09:27:00.000Z	spinningcompass	norty	Is the card formatted as ext2, VFAT, or something else?
2010-09-12T09:29:00.000Z	spinningcompass	norty	mlabel can do it
