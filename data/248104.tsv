2005-09-22T09:07:00.000Z	MrFaber		Is this the right channel to post bugs or ask for solutions?
2005-09-22T09:08:00.000Z	ompaul	MrFaber	ask for solutions, and we will if it a bug point you to reporting it :) buzilla.ubuntu.com so don't ask to ask let's play who has a bug today :)
2006-03-23T17:25:00.000Z	ompaul	MrFaber	go to the channel #ubuntu+1 there is nothing wrong with it but we don't support it here
