2004-12-14T07:58:00.000Z	marsjays	titbread	but be sure to check out that all dependencies are met (on every debian package page there is a list of dependencies, packages you must have for that one to work)

2004-12-14T08:00:00.000Z	marsjays	titbread	ok.. well, in that case i'm not sure you should do it that way at all.. umm.. it would probably be better to download and burn the debian cd images with kde, and add them to your sources.list (could probably do that with synaptic)
