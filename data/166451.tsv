2011-06-02T16:13:00.000Z	SAngeli		Hi, I just installed ubuntu 11.04 and wish to install nomachine NX but do not know how to. I am confused because some old docs report that I have to install extra applications to make NX work. Is there a doc or page on Internet that would guide me through on how to install NX on a desktop for current 11.04 version?
