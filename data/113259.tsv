2008-04-14T12:38:00.000Z	kksm19820117		Greetings, all. I am trying to pick a distro for my father's box - a PIII - 600MHz, 64MB SDRAM machine. I have a AMD 2000XP+, 512 MB DDR box and it ran the standard Ubuntu install so sluggishly that I ended up installing a command line install and adding Fluxbox to it. I won't have access to the internet while I am at my Dad's, and I think he needs something like KDE which will look familiar. Will KUbuntu 7.10 do the job for him?
