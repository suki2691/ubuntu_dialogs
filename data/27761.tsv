2010-08-09T19:48:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Israfel	left click on the Rhythmbox icon in system tray - quit
2010-08-09T19:52:00.000Z	Israfel	ZykoticK9	It wasn't in the system tray. I had to reopen it and stop the song then close it.
2010-08-09T19:53:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Israfel	is this the only times it's happened?
