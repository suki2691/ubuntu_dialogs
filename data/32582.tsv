2010-05-04T05:58:00.000Z	daftykins	Guest46867	probably find a repo or install from the site
2010-05-04T05:59:00.000Z	Guest46867	daftykins	 the site isn't working. and it's not available in the backports. do you know of an http mirror that I could use?
2010-05-04T05:59:00.000Z	daftykins	Guest46867	no idea sorry. have you queried ubottu for open office related aid?
