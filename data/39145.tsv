2010-01-13T14:19:00.000Z	Dextronaught		I'm currently experiencing sound problems.  I'm using Karmic.  I get sound through Flash and Java of Firefox, but don't get any sound when I play music I've downloaded or when I try to use a program.  I've checked my sound preferences and don't have any hardware, and no input devices either. I'm sure that my sound jacks are plugged in properly, and when I do get sound, when I do, I can get it out of both my onboard speakers, and my head
