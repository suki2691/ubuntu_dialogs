2009-10-04T11:17:00.000Z	eepberries		I'm trying to change the resolution of my ubuntu computer because it is hooked up to a monitor with a lower max resolution than what it's currently set to. I know how to access the command line (ctl+alt+f2) and i've tried using xrandr, but it says "can't open the display". what should i do?
2009-10-04T11:18:00.000Z	eepberries		you can use sudo su i think
2009-10-04T11:18:00.000Z	eepberries		sort of similar
2009-10-04T11:18:00.000Z	lstarnes	eepberries	sudo -i, not sudo su
