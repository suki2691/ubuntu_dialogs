2007-09-07T14:44:00.000Z	aleix		does anyone know if there is a particular channel to talk about dhcpd server?
2007-09-07T14:45:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	aleix	I've set up dhcp servers once or twice...
2007-09-07T14:46:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	aleix	dhcp keeps a lease file somewhere, can't rememebr where off the top of my head. I think it also logs them to /var/log/messages when it hands them out
2007-09-07T14:48:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	aleix	cool, glad to help :)
