2008-11-11T03:20:00.000Z	rand0mabo		hey everyone... quick question -.. my optical USB mouse just randomly stopped working in ubuntu.. any idea what the problem could be, or how to fix it (without having to reboot) ?
2008-11-11T03:20:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	rand0mabo	try another usb-port
2008-11-11T03:21:00.000Z	rand0mabo	DIFH-iceroot	 and zleap it's not the physical port as I never have this issue when running windows. (I have a dual-booted system)
2008-11-11T03:21:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	rand0mabo	i had the same problem but with windows and not ubuntu, another port was working,  sorry dont know the reason
