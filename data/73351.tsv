2008-11-24T02:44:00.000Z	Peppe80iii	oskar-	do you know if it is the [accounting] section that should do the trick, just found that i missed that option..
2008-11-24T02:45:00.000Z	oskar-	Peppe80iii	 i do not even know that section. has it special meanings?
2008-11-24T02:46:00.000Z	oskar-	Peppe80iii	 i think you should not try upper or mixed case share names, because: "Section and parameter names are not case sensitive." (man smb.conf)
