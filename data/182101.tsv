2012-07-24T06:13:00.000Z	blubee		hello guys i am on ubuntu 12.04, i am developing with eclipse, i have 4 gb of ram but sometimes my computer just totally locks up, requiring a force power down. So i checked the internet and found to use the terminal command free -m, it should show 4gb of ram but only shows 2, i believe this is the cause of my problems, i rand a memory test and all 4gb passed so now how do i enable ubuntu to see all my memory? I am on a 32bit install

2012-07-24T06:17:00.000Z	edgy	blubee	then do as blubee, or escott told you, install a pae kernel
2012-07-24T06:18:00.000Z	edgy	blubee	or better install a 64 bit system
