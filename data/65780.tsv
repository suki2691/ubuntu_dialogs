2009-02-21T02:55:00.000Z	somebee		hi. I've just got a new webserver setup with ubuntu server 64bit.. would you recommend using apt-get or aptitude to install packages? or is it two sides of the same thing?
2009-02-21T02:56:00.000Z	oskar-	somebee	 i would say the latter, just two interfaces to the package system
2009-02-21T02:57:00.000Z	somebee	oskar-	so I can even use both of them for different packages? (not that I would ever=)
2009-02-21T02:58:00.000Z	oskar-	somebee	 yes, i think so
