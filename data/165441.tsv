2006-10-26T16:14:00.000Z	kdean06	xzk	When editing a control file (dh_make) I'm aware you can use pipes to specify multiple packages ot meet the dependancy, but is it pissible to specify both an & as well as a | in a single entry? I'm packaging something that requires a working php install on Apache, but php4 or 5 work, AND apache and apache2
