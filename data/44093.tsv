2011-03-14T23:53:00.000Z	makmanalp		hello, i'm trying to get the 3m microtouch touchscreen to work and i hit the bug described here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-input-mutouch/+bug/533502 . The end states that the bug is fixed in 11.04, does that mean that there is no way to use it in, say, 10.10?
