I tried to reboot afterwards and it locked up so I had to power off the tower and power it back on, now it's all broken
2006-06-08T05:55:00.000Z	DavidJaq		It goes to the Ubuntu logo where it says a bunch of stuff and '[OK] ', then when it tries to start X Server it says that it's failed and then drops me to a command line. I've tried reconfiguring the x server thingy like someone else said, but it didn't work
2006-06-08T05:55:00.000Z	DavidJaq		How would I uninstall Ubuntu?
