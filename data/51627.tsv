2009-12-07T23:35:00.000Z	Jamed	enherit	do you want to see them while booting or after?
2009-12-07T23:35:00.000Z	enherit	Jamed	after
2009-12-07T23:36:00.000Z	Jamed	enherit	afaik thats not possible, however you can make the messages pause after boot is finished until you hit any key (i know it works, but i dont know how)
