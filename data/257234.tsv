2006-01-25T11:18:00.000Z	zoexii		hello, I need some help finding help...  I recently upgraded processor and motherboard from PIII to AMD Athlon XP.  My Ubuntu install made the transition without problem, but my windows install crashes while booting.  Can I reinstall windows without damaging my Ubuntu install?
