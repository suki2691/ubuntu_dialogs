2009-12-13T00:12:00.000Z	jason_____		hey guys - my DHCP service isnt starting whenever it boots up. What could be the problem?
2009-12-13T00:13:00.000Z	pecisk	jason_____	did you mean your computer doesn't aquire dhcp ip?
2009-12-13T00:13:00.000Z	jason_____	pecisk	- No, I have two laptops I use for imaging windows machines, and the imaging software runs on Linux. Theyre both Ubuntu and theyre both PXE booting the clients and hand out generic IPs to connect them. But the clients dont pick up an IP address unless I manually stop then start the dhcp service each time.
