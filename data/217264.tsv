2006-10-17T14:58:00.000Z	babo		guys, I'm having problems compiling the kqemu module, it's telling me that it can't find the kernel includes. I've installed linux-kernel-devel but my /usr/src/linux/ folder is empty ...
2006-10-17T14:58:00.000Z	babo		is that weird ?
2006-10-17T14:58:00.000Z	webwolf_27	babo	you need the kernel-headers package
2006-10-17T15:05:00.000Z	webwolf_27	babo	yes there are, look through synaptic
