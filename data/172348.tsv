2006-08-03T15:24:00.000Z	TheKittenEater		Alright, "my brother" being the genious he is, decided to get rid of my Ubuntu partition on my laptop using Partition Magic. GRUB now fails to load and because of "my brother" I can't boot into XP. Any ideas on what to do?

2006-08-03T15:26:00.000Z	TheKittenEater	Madpilot	I'll do that for sure, any other ideas?
2006-08-03T15:26:00.000Z	Madpilot	TheKittenEater	sorry, not really. You might be able to salvage the install from a LiveCD, but that's not an area I know anything about
