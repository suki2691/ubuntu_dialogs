For instance if i do /etc/init.d/slurm status I get nothing since slurm isn't located in /etc/init.d yet when i do top | grep "slurm" it's running. I need to restart the process and want to make sure i can
2011-12-20T08:15:00.000Z	cipherboy	shade34321	want the path to the process?
2011-12-20T08:17:00.000Z	cipherboy	shade34321	ls -l /proc/PID | grep 'exe'
2011-12-20T08:20:00.000Z	cipherboy	shade34321	might try a rhel channel then.
