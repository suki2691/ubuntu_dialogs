2007-12-09T23:07:00.000Z	WARlrus|away		Hi, I'm having trouble using 7.10 and a USB wireless adaptor. Ubuntu recognises the adaptor, but when I put in the correct WEP key it doesn't seem to connect
2007-12-09T23:08:00.000Z	wols	WARlrus|away	what chip in the usb adapter?
2007-12-09T23:08:00.000Z	WARlrus|away	wols	I don't know that, how can I find that out?
