2008-01-25T17:26:00.000Z	Slart	ballie1972	64bit can access a bit more memory.. a lot more really
2008-01-25T17:27:00.000Z	Slart	ballie1972	I think 64bit is a bit faster when doing large calculations.. such as rendering stuff or working with designing airplanes and such..
2008-01-25T17:28:00.000Z	Slart	ballie1972	but in daily use.. not a lot is different.. I doubt a regular user would be able to tell the difference between a 64-bit install and a 32-bit install
