2005-04-12T14:06:00.000Z	FlimFlamMan		does the live cd boot on dual-proc systems?  i tried it on a dual-athlon system, and a friend tried it on a dual ppc system - both failed.  it worked on a single-cpu intel box though
2005-04-12T14:07:00.000Z	bob2`	FlimFlamMan	it should work fine
2005-04-12T14:07:00.000Z	bob2`	FlimFlamMan	it has the same kernel as the install cd
2005-04-12T14:08:00.000Z	bob2`	FlimFlamMan	might be an X problem, or a corrupt cd
