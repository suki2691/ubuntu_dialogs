2009-09-15T09:11:00.000Z	xeer		I dont see any download available...
2009-09-15T09:12:00.000Z	xeer		Seems ubuntu "assumes" everyone has networking that wants to compile
2009-09-15T09:12:00.000Z	harisund	xeer	not really. ubuntu just assumes most users won't need to compile anything to get a functional system, and that if someone wants a compiler, they will be able to figure out how to get it:)
