2007-06-15T14:40:00.000Z	Lacrymology	TheShocker	gentoo is the shit. I learned more about linux and my computer in the three days it took me to have a working system, than in the following 2 years
2007-06-15T14:41:00.000Z	TheShocker	Lacrymology	I used gentoo too, I must say the ubuntu community rules compared to them
2007-06-15T14:42:00.000Z	Lacrymology	TheShocker	really? I have a much harder time getting help here than at #gentoo
