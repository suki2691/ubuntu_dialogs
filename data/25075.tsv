2010-09-30T16:43:00.000Z	SinusPi		Greetings. May some of you shed some light on a problem of mine? I need USB-booted Ubuntu 10.10 to not try to initialize one of the hard disks; it has (probably) unreadable partition table (or worse) and ubuntu keeps failing on some DMA reads and won't even go into X mode, stuck in the error loop. Any way I can prevent any attempts to mount it, so that I can do it manually once everything is up..?
2010-09-30T16:44:00.000Z	Oer	SinusPi	#ubuntu+1 for 10.10
2010-09-30T16:46:00.000Z	SinusPi	Oer	and it's SO much of a difference between 10 and any other version?
2010-09-30T16:47:00.000Z	Oer	SinusPi	i think not, but any bug should be discussed there, to avoid your bug gets lost.
