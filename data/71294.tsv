2008-12-15T09:59:00.000Z	djet13		Help Needed: I'm attempting to install Ubuntu on a Macbook using CD, but no matter what I do, if I boot from the CD, I simply get a textual menu with Boot: where I'm able to enter text, but no matter what I enter it complains about no finding a kernel image. If I simply press enter it says the same thing, but with linux at the end. Like "Cannot find kernel image: linux"
2008-12-15T10:00:00.000Z	evilGUI	djet13	is it a bad burn?
2008-12-15T10:00:00.000Z	djet13	evilGUI	i mean it's possible. i verified the burn after burning it though and it checked out fine.
2008-12-15T10:01:00.000Z	evilGUI	djet13	it's a intel macbook correct?
