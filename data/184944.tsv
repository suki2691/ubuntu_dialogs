The old hard drive had crashed and I have a new blank harddrive I want to install Ubuntu on. Before putting it in the laptop I'm wondering if I may install Ubuntu onto the drive by USB connecting it to my desktop computer and install Ubuntu then place drive in laptop & if it will work

2012-06-08T10:22:00.000Z	Corey	Guest75733	It could work, but it adds complication.
2012-06-08T10:23:00.000Z	Corey	Guest75733	Hmm.  That's not likely to go away with different install methods.
