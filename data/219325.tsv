2007-06-13T06:19:00.000Z	Finity		Guys, I'm having a /huge/ problem
2007-06-13T06:20:00.000Z	Finity		I'm getting Error 17 when I turn on my computer (Grub Error 17).  Apparently that means grub doesn't recognize one of the partitions filesystems... what would cause this, and how do I fix this?
2007-06-13T06:22:00.000Z	Finity		Apparently I need to edit menu.lst or something, where is that?
