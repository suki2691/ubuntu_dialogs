2011-08-06T16:04:00.000Z	Stava		can i temporarily hide the gnome panel(s) and then get them back again after a while?
2011-08-06T16:04:00.000Z	karni	Stava	Right click -> Properties -> Autohide?
2011-08-06T16:05:00.000Z	karni	Stava	you could probably use a custom command with Compiz magic to hide them temporarily, but that's a little playing.
2011-08-06T16:05:00.000Z	Stava	karni	alright, thanks
