2011-01-13T11:32:00.000Z	user___		hey guys, two questions. 1) what "service" and "port" does irc run on? 2) how do i get a non-repository executable file to run? (it seems to be blocked by default) thnx
2011-01-13T11:34:00.000Z	user___		so i downloaded a program i want to use in wine, but its blocked by default as an executable (presumably because it wasn't download via repository). how can i bypass this?
