2011-11-10T07:54:00.000Z	maestrojed		I am building a media center so I am going for a little more pizazz over utilitarian. I'd love to have my desktop show the weather and a cool clock. Suggestions? I have tried screenlets and kde superkarama but they aren't really working well. Any other suggestions?
