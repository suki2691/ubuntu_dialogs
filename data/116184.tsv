2008-03-19T13:17:00.000Z	zcat[1]		hehe.. two or three min, yeah. It's a bit slow to boot and stuff too.. I really need 512M and it would be sweet
2008-03-19T13:18:00.000Z	dgjones	zcat[1]	what desktop manager do you run on that, I've got an old laptop, sounds like a simlar spec to that, works great with xfce, gnome was a bit slow
2008-03-19T13:19:00.000Z	zcat[1]	dgjones	yeah, gnome .. it would probably be quite OK with xfce but I plan to get more ram sometime and I like gnome
