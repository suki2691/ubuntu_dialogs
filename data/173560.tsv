2009-11-01T20:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	thevdi	Yes Ext4 is the default for 9.10 and it's  stable
2009-11-01T20:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	thevdi	default for clean installs
2009-11-01T20:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	thevdi	it's 9.04 where there is optional support and it's not perfectly stable, because of the kernel they have for it and such
