2010-07-05T15:59:00.000Z	blackthor		i'm still trying to figure out if ubuntu works fine on a HP ML150 G6 (which is "fairly new", not 'bleeding edge')  however, on the canonical site, HP compatibility list looks outdated  (no mentioning of 10.04), is there anybody that did a successful 10.04 install on that machine (incl raid ctrller) ?

2010-07-05T16:01:00.000Z	blackthor	stevecam	but i'm naturally concerned about (raid) driver crap, so that's why i try to inform myself first
2010-07-05T16:03:00.000Z	blackthor	stevecam	yes there were some issues with the HP raid chipset but it's fairly undocumented... that's why i'm asking here ;)
