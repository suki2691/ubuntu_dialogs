2008-06-11T22:25:00.000Z	DarkAudit	Ice_Max	forget X-fi for now, there are no suitable drivers at present...
2008-06-11T22:26:00.000Z	DarkAudit	Ice_Max	there's nothing packaded, and my Linux-fu isn't strong enough to go mucking about with those
2008-06-11T22:27:00.000Z	DarkAudit	Ice_Max	but for flash, if you're runnig Firefox, and you get a message at the top of a pageabout missing plugins, click on the button, and installing flash should be near-automatic
