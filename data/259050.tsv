2009-08-27T07:18:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	lordnikon	what kind of wireless? might not even need any more than what is on the ubuntu disk if you have good cards
2009-08-27T07:22:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	lordnikon	because the card is a broadcom chip ... do an "lspci |grep bcm" in the terminal to see what you have
