2008-04-12T12:48:00.000Z	blinkiz		Am looking for a way to see how much memory a process is taking. Not in % but in MB. "top" can't do this in a easy way. No GUI tool because it will be runned on server version of ubuntu. Please advice
2008-04-12T12:50:00.000Z	t1n0m3n	blinkiz	System > Administration > System Monitor?
2008-04-12T12:50:00.000Z	t1n0m3n	blinkiz	Processes tab?
2008-04-12T12:50:00.000Z	blinkiz	t1n0m3n	Yes, your right. But no gui tool
