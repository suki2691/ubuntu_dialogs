2007-02-04T17:51:00.000Z	farruinn	Caffeine	oh, so you want the thumbnail in the open file dialog. Yeah, sorry, no idea :S
2007-02-04T17:52:00.000Z	farruinn	Caffeine	here's an alternative though: browse for it in Nautilus where you *do* get thumbnails, then you can drag the icon onto the open file dialog in firefox
