2005-07-04T14:57:00.000Z	Garyu		I have a relatively old videocard (Nvidia Riva TNT2, 32Mb) in my system, but was able to run a 'quite decent' game of Unreal Tournament. How would I go about in Ubuntu to install OpenGL drivers? Or are they already installed?
2005-07-04T14:58:00.000Z	yuacht	Garyu	i think the nvidia-glx package supports it yes
2005-07-04T15:02:00.000Z	Garyu	yuacht	a bit late reply from me, but thanks :). You were right, it's supported by the glx-drivers
2005-07-04T15:03:00.000Z	yuacht	Garyu	np ;)
