2008-04-17T18:39:00.000Z	Lainy		does anyone know of a program that can allow me to save multiple file paths and copy them into another directory with the click of a button? thanks.

2008-04-17T18:44:00.000Z	Lainy	erUSUL	i'd like to specify several file paths and to copy all these files into a directory.. and to be able to save this action so in the future, i can hit a "Backup now" button to copy all those specified files automatically
2008-04-17T18:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	Lainy	make a script that backups those files and call it from terminal or via a launcher
