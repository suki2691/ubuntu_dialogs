2008-12-06T01:33:00.000Z	DavidCanarias		I have a DVD a friend burnt to disc for me. In one section there are photos in mpg format and the other is a Webcam video converted to mpg. I am trying to copy the DVD to send to a friend but I am finding it pretty impossible to do with all the tools I have. Any ideas please to help me?
