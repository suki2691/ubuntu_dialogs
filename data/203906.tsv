2007-09-12T06:14:00.000Z	Mar1		what ubuntu-dist should I use/download if I have a Core 2 Duo, I've tried the one for AMD64, which it said I should use if I had a 64-bit processor.. but when I try to boot the CD, the computer just hangs on me.. any clues/ideas?
2007-09-12T06:14:00.000Z	LadyNikon	Mar1	32bit
