2011-05-17T21:44:00.000Z	A_J		hey all I have an Issue. When I leave my comp on for extended periods. Mostly when i move the mouse or press a few keys the login window comes up, asking for password. Sometimes Though it does not just showing a black screen with the mouse pointer. Any Idea What Can Be Doing This ?
