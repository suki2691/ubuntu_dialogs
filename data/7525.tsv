2011-11-25T05:12:00.000Z	tolland		my ubuntu 11.10 laptop with xfce is spinning the fan continuously, not sure when this started, it might be due to mank building up on the fans or some lower settings for starting the fan for temperatures
2011-11-25T05:12:00.000Z	tolland		are there any tools that I should look at so see what the fan settings and system temps are ?
