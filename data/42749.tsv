2009-12-17T10:47:00.000Z	jonzbcc		I spend most my time I gnome-terminal anyway!
2009-12-17T10:48:00.000Z	losha	jonzbcc	my uptime is generally in weeks. Top cpu user if always firefox, xorg is second by a factor of 10...
2009-12-17T10:49:00.000Z	jonzbcc	losha	.. firefox, interesting. very interesting.
