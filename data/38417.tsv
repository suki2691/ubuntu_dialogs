2010-01-24T23:00:00.000Z	scunizi	I^llGetOverIt	if they were .deb files originally they will show in synaptic.. if not then it may be tough to do depending on the program and if it contained an uninstaller..
2010-01-24T23:02:00.000Z	I^llGetOverIt	scunizi	it is not .deb i installed with sudo python setup.py install but the application does not work, so I find it in dep package but can not install it because uf old installation there is a conflict
2010-01-24T23:03:00.000Z	scunizi	I^llGetOverIt	just start deleting files that belong to it then...
