2005-07-02T12:17:00.000Z	tag		thats what I thought
2005-07-02T12:17:00.000Z	gm78	tag	yes, ubuntu is based on debian and has apt
2005-07-02T12:23:00.000Z	tag	gm78	During the ubuntu installation it you have to provide a root password right?  (the answer should be "duh" I would think but a non-unix-person friend of mine installed ubuntu and I'm trying to help him, he doesn't seem to know his root password)
