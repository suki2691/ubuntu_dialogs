2010-03-28T09:28:00.000Z	SwimmingRat		minor question:  where can I go to make all my desktop icons start out smaller. Ditto for windows opening with list and not icons.
2010-03-28T09:29:00.000Z	casemods	SwimmingRat	right click > change icon size or similar
2010-03-28T09:29:00.000Z	SwimmingRat	casemods	I dont want to change them one at a time but change the default size. I found it once and I dont know where.
