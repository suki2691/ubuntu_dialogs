2011-09-02T20:20:00.000Z	paulh-paulh		hi, i just upgraded to a new version. in the new version the screen stays black. is there any way to "downgrade"? so i dont need to press on older versions in the boot process?7
2011-09-02T20:22:00.000Z	paulh-paulh		at the moment i got version 11-.04
2011-09-02T20:23:00.000Z	paulh-paulh		anyone got an idea?
