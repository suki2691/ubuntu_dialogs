2010-10-01T03:15:00.000Z	Scott__2		hi all. i'm trying to install ubuntu desktop amd64. i've got an ati radeon 5770 and everytime i load the installer, from usb or cd, 10.10 or 10.04.1, i just get a black screen after it's finished booting which i guess is a display issue. any ideas? i've done a search and found a few people with similar probs with 5770 but can't find any solutions
