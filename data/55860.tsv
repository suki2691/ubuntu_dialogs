2009-06-01T20:28:00.000Z	G_A_C		does anyone know of a way using the 9.04 livecd that I can find out what version of a Pentium 4 is installed? x86info isn't available, and I don't have a network connection handy to install it, can it be done other ways?
2009-06-01T20:28:00.000Z	Vlet	G_A_C	or check out dmesg perhaps
2009-06-01T20:29:00.000Z	G_A_C	Vlet	I'll check dmesg, good idea, thanks
2009-06-01T20:31:00.000Z	G_A_C	Vlet	it's a P4 3.4 stepping 09, that could give me a clue, thanks for the tip :)
