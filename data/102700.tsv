2009-07-26T15:07:00.000Z	rage		I'm looking at shifting from a 32bit install of Ubuntu to a 64bit version. Would I encounter any problems if I simply copy /home to a fresh 64bit install from a 32bit install (other than the fact I'll need to reinstall any applications I had)

2009-07-26T15:09:00.000Z	rww	rage	I've copied /home from one install to another multiple times, and have never had problems
