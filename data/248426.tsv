2008-01-28T00:10:00.000Z	Leila		All the spaces in the names.
2008-01-28T00:10:00.000Z	Leila		qmp3join is the app.
2008-01-28T00:12:00.000Z	bascule	Leila	there are simple bash loops for file renaming like that, or look at easytag, it renames mp3/ogg files to various different schemas, as will amarok IIRC
