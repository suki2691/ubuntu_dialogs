2012-09-01T17:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	DrChaos	 you could copy the .iso file it makes to the usb, then mount the iso file on the other box. Ive see that  work for update media.
2012-09-01T18:00:00.000Z	DrChaos	dr_willis	what are the dependencies for like e.g. build-essential? I see no way to get apt-on-cd on MS Windows
2012-09-01T18:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	DrChaos	 no idea. I rarely need apt-on-cd
