2008-03-20T02:32:00.000Z	CJS3141		I just installed a program thru Synaptic, but how do I know how to access it?
2008-03-20T02:33:00.000Z	minimec	CJS3141	You may find it in the menu editor 'alt+f2 alacarte'
2008-03-20T02:34:00.000Z	CJS3141	minimec	I couldn't find it with alacarte--not in any of the menus I think.
2008-03-20T02:36:00.000Z	minimec	CJS3141	Is that a GUI application? What happens if you start it in a terminal like 'kwi<tab>'?
