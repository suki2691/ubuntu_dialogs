2010-05-18T00:13:00.000Z	fastfwd		I have multiple users on my system, I work in English and the other accounts are all in Dutch. On the accounts other than my own everything is translated to Dutch accept Firefox and Thunderbird (installed from the default repo), which are still English. Anyone have any idea on how to get them to Dutch?
2010-05-18T00:15:00.000Z	fastfwd		I already tried the Dutch channel and there's no solution there, furthermore, neither the documentation nor google have so far provided me with a solution
2010-05-18T00:16:00.000Z	fastfwd		Everyone just tells me it "should work", which it unfortuneately doesn't
2010-05-18T00:18:00.000Z	Loshki	fastfwd	also try #firefox
