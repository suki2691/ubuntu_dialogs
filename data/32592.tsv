2010-05-21T04:54:00.000Z	hou5ton		I have a short video on a DVD and would like to burn it to my hd, but am having trouble figuring out how to do that.  If I open the DVD there are two folders there: Video_rm and Video_ts
2010-05-21T04:55:00.000Z	dddw	hou5ton	you can simply copy the .vob files... you can open them with VLC
2010-05-21T04:56:00.000Z	hou5ton	dddw	 and then what about burning copies of the video
2010-05-21T04:58:00.000Z	dddw	hou5ton	see what Grujah said: <Grujah> hou5ton, or you could make an image with Brasero and than mount it... you can use a program like gmount-iso to run it... and burn the iso to dvd again with a burning program
