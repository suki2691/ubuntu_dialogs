2008-03-21T19:39:00.000Z	fbc	aalper	 /etc/init.d/apache2 start will do the job manually, I would suspect having to enter the line in the rc.local, however I believe it should startup automatically unless otherwise told.

2008-03-21T19:43:00.000Z	fbc	aalper	sry, I'm not that much a geek in linux. There are probably others here that help with such a easy problem.
