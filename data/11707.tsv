2011-07-23T07:49:00.000Z	lwizardl	testytesty	yeah I have looked at sysrec before. I was looking at the xubuntu because of how low the overhead system requirements that are needed. I'm just looking for a distro version to keep on hand for older machines. Like the system I was given today to do some repairs on seems to only have about 64mb of ram
