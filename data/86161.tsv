2008-07-16T11:53:00.000Z	KDB9000	Ahadiel	yes, i tried in the shortcuts but it doesn't pick anything up so it won't set them. i have read methods to set them but i haven't been able to get the key codes
2008-07-16T11:54:00.000Z	Ahadiel	KDB9000	Hrm, I have a DV6000 and everything is fine.
2008-07-16T11:55:00.000Z	KDB9000	Ahadiel	there seems to be a big difference from the 5000 and the 6000. i have found info about the key codes for 6000 but none for the 5000
