2009-10-16T05:19:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	ZykoticK9	pkill <name> is like kill (pidof <name>)
2009-10-16T05:20:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	StrangeCharm_	Billiard so it doesn't really matter which we use?
2009-10-16T05:21:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	ZykoticK9	there are some other methods for using dual monitors. there's a very good proprietary one for nvidia cards (twinview)
