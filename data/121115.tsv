2011-01-14T05:14:00.000Z	kay		hey can anyone walk me through the installation of steam on linux? i have wine but im not sure what to do next.
2011-01-14T05:15:00.000Z	s3a	kay	put the msi file on desktop and open a terminal and copy paste this: cd Desktop && /msiexec *.msi
2011-01-14T05:17:00.000Z	s3a	kay	did it work? because i think i made a mistake
2011-01-14T05:17:00.000Z	s3a	kay	i think it's msiexec /i *.msi instead
