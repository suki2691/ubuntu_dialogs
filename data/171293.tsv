2006-08-11T10:29:00.000Z	remnant		hi, would someone happen to be able to give me some pointers as to how I can setup mysql on ubuntu?  I installed mysql-admin but I don't yet know how to login to administer it
2006-08-11T10:29:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	remnant	sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client
2006-08-11T10:29:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	remnant	mysql-admin is not the server, just a front end to administer other servers.
2006-08-11T10:30:00.000Z	remnant	fyrestrtr	yes, I installed phpmyadmin too, but is there a default user and password?
