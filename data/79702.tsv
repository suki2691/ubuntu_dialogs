2009-05-27T19:45:00.000Z	v4vijayakumar		I am using latest ubuntu (24 days old; updating now). I was watching a video (VLC) from my external hard disk (not backed up by a UPS). during a power cut, VLC crashed, and from then on I couldn't play any sound. is this happened to anyone here.
2009-05-27T19:45:00.000Z	h4mx0r	v4vijayakumar	no but I uninstalled gdm and sound stopped working
2009-05-27T19:46:00.000Z	h4mx0r	v4vijayakumar	tried checking your synaptic history for that day? any weird dmesg output now?
2009-05-27T19:47:00.000Z	v4vijayakumar	h4mx0r	dmesg ? /var/log/messages ??
