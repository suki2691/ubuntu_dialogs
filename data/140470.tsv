2007-05-06T09:34:00.000Z	Furthur		I just installed pidgin from getdebs and uninstalled gaim. but I can still open gaim... it seems as though synaptics left the binaries in /usr/bin
2007-05-06T09:34:00.000Z	Nubbie	Furthur	you shouldn't uninstall gaim.
2007-05-06T09:35:00.000Z	Nubbie	Furthur	pidgin should install completely separate from gaim anyways.
2007-05-06T09:43:00.000Z	Nubbie	Furthur	everytime after you upgrade you'll have to remove rhythmbox, compiz, etc.... every time...
