2010-10-08T02:16:00.000Z	raidix	aeon-ltd	I figured you would say that, but it isn't in the repos, so i guess i must build it.
2010-10-08T02:19:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	raidix	meh, compiling isn't too hard, and handy aswell. its a shame ubuntu doesn't have volwheel (well prob due to the fact that it really is a pro-gnome distro)
2010-10-08T02:19:00.000Z	raidix	aeon-ltd	yeah, i just built it now, quite surprising how quick that was, in a virtual machine too
