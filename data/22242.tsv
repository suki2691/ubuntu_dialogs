2010-12-26T14:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nirazio	You might have driver problems. What is the output of "glxinfo | grep direct"? (if it's more than one line use http://pastebin.ubuntu.com )
2010-12-26T14:08:00.000Z	nirazio	Jordan_U	DO you want me to instal glxinfo for that??
2010-12-26T14:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	nirazio	Yes.
