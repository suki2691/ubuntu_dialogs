2007-05-20T16:02:00.000Z	linux_manju	purpzey	You mean rdesktop ?
2007-05-20T16:03:00.000Z	purpzey	linux_manju	I guess yeah....I mean, I just converted both my computers over to Ubuntu over the course of a few weeks...I used to have a remote desktop w/ XP so that if I was in the living room and I wanted something from my room I would just login to that machine...I read that it is possible to do that using Ubuntu...Just wondering if it works well, and if it's worth it etc
2007-05-20T16:04:00.000Z	linux_manju	purpzey	Well apt-get install rdesktop and then rdesktop -u username ipaddr
