2011-03-04T04:21:00.000Z	jaustin		Hi. For some reason whenever I open a file in vim, i got prompted with: "indent" [New File] ... Vim appears to be opening the wrong file, and when i try to close it, it says "E173: 1 more file to edit"
2011-03-04T04:22:00.000Z	jaustin		in the terminal
2011-03-04T04:22:00.000Z	jaustin		just vim myfile.txt
2011-03-04T04:22:00.000Z	mgolisch	jaustin	by anychance does the filename contain spaces?
