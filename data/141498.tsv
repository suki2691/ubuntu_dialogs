2009-02-27T21:56:00.000Z	polytan		I've just finished to install ubuntu. I added a few repo in sources.list. the gnome program to install software (not synaptics) find them. Synaptics find nothin, it's like it only look at the main packages
2009-02-27T21:56:00.000Z	polytan		and apt-get install synaptics find nothing :(
2009-02-27T21:56:00.000Z	polytan		did you already had this problem ?
2009-02-27T21:57:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	polytan	have you updated your package lists? Click 'Reload' in Synaptic
