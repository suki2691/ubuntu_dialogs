2012-05-15T18:02:00.000Z	ironhalik	Oer	could you guide me to it? :) I cant find it in cups, and job options in printing allow for 'monochrome' only
2012-05-15T18:03:00.000Z	Oer	ironhalik	so no grayscale in % ? then the driver does not support it, i'm afraid.
2012-05-15T18:04:00.000Z	ironhalik	Oer	hmm, kk, Ill look around in other options and drivers :)
