2010-05-19T05:48:00.000Z	gartral	shadmego	you should post your issue, know will know if they can help you untill we all know your problem
2010-05-19T05:50:00.000Z	gartral	shadmego	then post all on one line, if it's a log, paste it too www.pastebin.com then post the link here
2010-05-19T05:54:00.000Z	gartral	shadmego	you need to learn how to use irc before anyone can help you, i cannot follow you if you dont 1) post my name in front of each message so i SEE they're for me. 2) dont use enter as period. and 3) paste all logs/errors to a pastebin
