2009-10-31T08:17:00.000Z	Wolfcastle		weird, sudo apt-get dist-upgrade doesn't install anything
2009-10-31T08:17:00.000Z	jken146	Wolfcastle	do-release-upgrade is what you want
2009-10-31T08:18:00.000Z	Wolfcastle	jken146	yes I'm running that now, thanx....and it seems to be working, don't know what was up with update-manager
