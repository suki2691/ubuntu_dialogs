2012-04-27T08:53:00.000Z	chris215		i was hoping i could free up some space on this computer, only 40 gb hd, by compressing my movie files when im not using them, but i am noticing that in tar.gz form its the same size as the file itself...  is there a compression format that will make the average 700mb movie file fit into a smaller file?
2012-04-27T08:54:00.000Z	chris215		or is that not really what compression does

2012-04-27T08:55:00.000Z	chris215	sfears	-c 9 will increase the compreession?
