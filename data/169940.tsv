2008-02-21T18:23:00.000Z	macogw	Christina18	you can try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" or you can use "sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf" to edit the file manually

2008-02-21T18:24:00.000Z	macogw	Christina18	well, as long as you know that ^ means you press Ctrl with the letter and that "Write Out" means "Save"
