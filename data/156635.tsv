2007-10-31T07:49:00.000Z	kkathman	riotkittie	 you're installed poor distros then
2007-10-31T07:50:00.000Z	kkathman	riotkittie	 the responsible ones DO
2007-10-31T07:51:00.000Z	riotkittie	kkathman	the fact that my distros of choice don't demand seperate home partitions doesn't make them poor, but that's offtopic and so i will shut up
