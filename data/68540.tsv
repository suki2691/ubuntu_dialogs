2009-10-12T07:22:00.000Z	kandjar		is there a way in ubuntu to redirect the home folder? let say i want home to be /data/home duing the install process?
2009-10-12T07:23:00.000Z	kandjar		the reason being: i have a 500gb hdd; which i want to partition, i need about 20gb for the os; and the rest should be distributed for video/photo/music/and home folder
2009-10-12T07:24:00.000Z	kandjar		yeah but that sound weird to me to have /home/video :) /home/photo... /home/git
