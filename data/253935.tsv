2005-03-25T07:03:00.000Z	mlambie	SidDithersL	is that for roaming between APs?
2005-03-25T07:04:00.000Z	mlambie	SidDithersL	http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/waproamd/ -- it migh tbe for WPA but I'v ehead people using it for roaming access
2005-03-25T07:09:00.000Z	mlambie	SidDithersL	I was pointing out that waproamd was replaced with wpa_supplicant, which I thought was for roaming access between APs
