2008-12-09T16:38:00.000Z	Tyrath	kop	the graphics drivers are dependant on the xorg.conf file, not the other way around
2008-12-09T16:39:00.000Z	Tyrath	kop	what I'm trying to say it there's one xorg.conf file that will contain the settings for your graphics drivers
2008-12-09T16:59:00.000Z	kop	Tyrath	what I'm trying to say is I know where the file is and how to edit but what to change is another matter
