2009-02-09T08:41:00.000Z	F4RR4R		If I'm going to use CVS/SVN to download the source code to the ogre/cegui/ode libraries and compile them myself, is there a specific place that ubuntu prefers I store that source code?

2009-02-09T08:42:00.000Z	MoTec		when you do the make and make install it'll put it where it belongs
