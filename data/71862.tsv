2009-03-01T01:49:00.000Z	magnetron		eseven73→ how did you format it in the first place?
2009-03-01T01:50:00.000Z	eseven73	magnetron	I used k3b, but it did not give me options, it only said something like "Format disk"
2009-03-01T01:51:00.000Z	eseven73	magnetron	apparently i didnt, but it did not give me any options to format it to UDF
