2012-03-27T14:57:00.000Z	Erquint		Ok. Maybe if i type a big message -- someone would notice me: I am using Ubuntu 11.10 for like a couple of months now and i am REALLLLLY tired of permission system. I made changes to "sudoers" file, but it seems to be working only for terminal and i know i can make everything using it(and often do), but it eats my time hard. I am the only user of PC and give no phat buddy about security risks. It's just came to a state when i am angered
2012-03-27T14:57:00.000Z	Erquint		so much that i just want to log off and never log back in Ubuntu again. Worst thing is that sometimes when i lack some privilege  Ubuntu DOESN"T prompt me for password and i have NO qqqing way to explain it that i am the boss here! Do somebody of you know how to override this behavior? Cause i like most things about Ubuntu and feel comfortable with it, but i desperately need to be a boss of my PC!
