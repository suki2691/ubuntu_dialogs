2007-05-21T08:55:00.000Z	jsmidt		I want to mount a cdrom.  How do I know where it is on my computer?  I thought it was supposed to be in /dev/hda, but the terminal says it doesn't exist.  Does anybody know how I can find it?

2007-05-21T08:59:00.000Z	jsmidt	Frogzoo	hal does pick it up, I just need to mount it as root.  So I need to umount then mount.  I am trying to figure out how to do that.
