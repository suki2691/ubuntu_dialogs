2011-01-11T19:13:00.000Z	ccw		Hi all.  I'm setting up a machine running 10.10, and I'd like to set up a communal scratch space where all the users can read and write all the files without having to change permissions everytime something is added.  I think I'm clear on how to do this from the command line manually, but am I reinventing the wheel?  Is there already a directory for this sort of thing by default?
