2012-07-27T21:58:00.000Z	Phoenixz		On 12.04, I want NOT to have to enter a PW for sudo, tried myuser ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL, myuser ALL =  NOPASSWD: ALL, nothing works.. what is wrong here?
2012-07-27T21:59:00.000Z	Phoenixz		It keeps asking for password on sudo
2012-07-27T21:59:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Phoenixz	believe me, you don't want to do that
2012-07-27T22:01:00.000Z	Phoenixz	ThinkT510	Believe me, I want to do that, and yes, I am aware of the risks.. I need it to work, something has changed because this worked on 11.04 w/o problem
