2008-02-14T05:33:00.000Z	macogw	shadowvice	currently, upgrades are only supported from one version to the one right after it.  skipping is not supported.  for LTS's, there is work being done to make it possible to smoothly go from one LTS to the next, skipping what's in between (probably involves it doing a bunch of extra checks regarding configuration files and software versions)
