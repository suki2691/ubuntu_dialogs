2010-01-26T14:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DomeDan	well Debian and Ubuntu quite similar since  Ubuntu is based on it, as I expect you already know.  Anyway I might do testing soon after trying the next Ubuntu when that comes out.
2010-01-26T14:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	DomeDan	Debian testing already tried in vm, and  it might become my host OS on here, after doing 10.04 for a bit.   Anyway back to support or whatever now, but not that many to help right now.
2010-01-26T14:26:00.000Z	DomeDan	sebsebseb	im on debian testing now 2.6.32-trunk :) only had problem with touchpad
