2011-10-04T05:55:00.000Z	Nicolas_Leonida2		Hey I'm trying to add a cron job to the system that runs every 30 minutes, I've done sudo crontab -e
2011-10-04T05:55:00.000Z	Nicolas_Leonida2		and I've added this line 0,30 * * * * cronscript
2011-10-04T05:55:00.000Z	Nicolas_Leonida2		that's enough right?
2011-10-04T05:56:00.000Z	DasEi	Nicolas_Leonida2	yes
