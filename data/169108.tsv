2006-09-20T10:28:00.000Z	rathel		hey I got a folder with a bunch of RAR files with MP3s in them, how do I get XMMS to play from RAR or is there another player that allows me to do that?
2006-09-20T10:29:00.000Z	rathel		hmm... does, foobar2000 work under wine? cuz I can just use that
2006-09-20T10:29:00.000Z	CharonX	rathel	mp3s are already in a compressed format. Thats quite odd to play them from a rar ?
2006-09-20T10:30:00.000Z	CharonX	rathel	you could try mounting the rar .....
