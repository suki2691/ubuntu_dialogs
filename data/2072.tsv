2012-07-09T13:58:00.000Z	L3top		Well... welcome to Ubuntu IlikeMoose... but this is why polling is not allowed here, because you get a bunch of people arguing about the thing they like/dislike... and when it is active, it makes it REALLY annoying to scroll through to get info to help people. Chit chat etc should happen in #ubuntu-offtopic. Like I said, not a big deal atm... but still not allowed.
