2007-02-25T06:06:00.000Z	k_keller		hi. I try to install ubuntu 6.10 DVD on Toshiba with ati radeon x700, however I get black screen during installation. I tried using dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and nano /etc/x11/xorg.conf but nothing works. In the case of the last one, i got the following error: bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off - can someone please help me
