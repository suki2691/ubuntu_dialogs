2011-05-26T02:44:00.000Z	Bigbucks		Is there a way I can disable a certian error from coming up in Ubuntu Server? I keep getting a USB error, and it prevents me from being able to enter any commands because it comes up a couple times every second, is there a way I can stop this so I can actually use the server?
