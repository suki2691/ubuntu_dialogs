2009-01-03T04:02:00.000Z	thomas_		Well here is a better question: In ubuntu 8.10 how do I know what restricted drivers are running on my system?
2009-01-03T04:03:00.000Z	thomas_		I'm in the hardware driveres but it says that there are no drivers in use... are the X3100 and other intel chipset drivers come with ubuntu 8.10 by default?
2009-01-03T04:04:00.000Z	thomas_		do the X3100**
2009-01-03T04:04:00.000Z	nickrud_	thomas_	yes, the drivers for the intel chips are open source not restricted
