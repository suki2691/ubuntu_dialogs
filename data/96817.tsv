2008-03-22T08:55:00.000Z	squizzi		Hey guys.. I'm getting the infamous VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0) kernel panic ... and I'm pretty new to Linux in general. Sooo, yeahhh, any ideas would be helpful, I'm currently burning a live CD so I can get in to my kernel, somehow.

2008-03-22T08:57:00.000Z	squizzi	Fryguy--	Any ideas? ..
2008-03-22T08:58:00.000Z	Fryguy--	squizzi	sorry, without more context as to how/why it started happening, I can't offer any meaningful input
