2005-04-18T15:48:00.000Z	Grock		HI is there a way to compile the sources for a kernel module while I'm compiling the kernel?
2005-04-18T15:48:00.000Z	ompaul	Grock	that question does not make sense
2005-04-18T15:49:00.000Z	Grock	ompaul	srry i meant to say extra modules, as in not included in the linux kernel sources
2005-04-18T15:51:00.000Z	ompaul	Grock	you should make the modules after the kernel
