2009-01-05T04:27:00.000Z	nickrud	Guest37328	when you boot, probably delete key or maybe f2 key. Depends on the bios. First screen should say
2009-01-05T04:28:00.000Z	nickrud	Guest37328	try hitting f2, f8, delete keys madly during bootup
2009-01-05T04:29:00.000Z	nickrud	Guest37328	only using your bios. see what rweait1 said above if all else fails
