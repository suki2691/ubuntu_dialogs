2005-05-02T10:43:00.000Z	HillTop		Oh this is just great! I play a music CD with Totem movie player. Oh yea, I remember someone complaining about that. Grief.
2005-05-02T10:43:00.000Z	HillTop		Also I had installed acrobat and now it is nowhere to be found.

2005-05-02T10:51:00.000Z	HillTop	kkathman	acruread is in /usr/bin - now how do I get it working again?  Open with functions seem broken. Example, a .txt file right click to open with gedit fails. .pdf open with anything - the default app fails.
