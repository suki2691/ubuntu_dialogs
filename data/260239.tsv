2006-10-27T06:35:00.000Z	MarcN	aleka	today? Probably more than a hour.  Heavy load on the servers right now.
2006-10-27T06:36:00.000Z	MarcN	aleka	probably closer to a few hours for a standard upgrade.      (I got in early and all upgraded ;-)
2006-10-27T06:38:00.000Z	MarcN	aleka	sudo apt-get -dy dist-upgrade  (and come back in a few hours and do:    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade)
