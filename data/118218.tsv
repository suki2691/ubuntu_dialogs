2008-03-11T19:41:00.000Z	leo_rockw		i'm connecting to my comp through ssh. when i try playing an ogg file the sound comes out in the comp i connect to and not in the comp i'm using ssh from. how do i change that?
2008-03-11T19:42:00.000Z	brobostigon	leo_rockw	just using shh, i dont think its possible to redirect audio output
2008-03-11T19:43:00.000Z	brobostigon	leo_rockw	maybe some kind of audio server may work??
2008-03-11T19:44:00.000Z	leo_rockw	brobostigon	will google that, thanks for your help
