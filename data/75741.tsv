2010-07-22T10:12:00.000Z	Spirits-Sight		how do I make gnome-shell default window-manger in ubuntu 10.04? thanks in advance
2010-07-22T10:14:00.000Z	soreau	Spirits-Sight	gnome-shell requires gnome3 which I do not think ubuntu has in repos yet
2010-07-22T10:15:00.000Z	Spirits-Sight	soreau	I am using it right now I just don't know how to turn it on by default only know through term
2010-07-22T10:15:00.000Z	soreau	Spirits-Sight	In that case, can't you just add it to startup applications in sys>prefs>?
