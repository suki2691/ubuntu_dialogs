2006-10-07T08:22:00.000Z	blind		Problem. I get home, switch my workspace to the one I use, computer locks up. I get into tty1, do a ps aux, nothing seems out of the ordinary. I restart X. It loads, I can do stuff. I have no background icons, alt+click isn't moving stuff, ALT+F2 isn't opening my run  box, etc etc
2006-10-07T08:23:00.000Z	sethk	blind	how do you get it back?
2006-10-07T08:24:00.000Z	sethk	blind	when it's working, do ps aux (saving the output)
2006-10-07T08:24:00.000Z	sethk	blind	then do the same when it's borked
