2010-11-01T18:38:00.000Z	qwertyjustin		Hi, i have install a windows xp and unbuntu dual boot.
2010-11-01T18:38:00.000Z	qwertyjustin		Every time i boot into ubuntu its ok. but every time i boot into windows, --then the following time i try to boot into anything, my computer cant find the MBR. windows is wiping my MBR everytime i boot into it.
2010-11-01T18:38:00.000Z	qwertyjustin		To temporarily fix it, i have to boot a live ubuntu cd and reinstall the grub. how can i defeat this?
