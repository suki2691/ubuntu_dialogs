2007-01-09T12:31:00.000Z	jlewis_		As a long time Red Hat user, trying out ubuntu for the first time, I have what's probably a silly question...but I'm used to being able to paste a URL anywhere in the main portion of a firefox window, and firefox loads the URL...in my Ubuntu 6.10 install I just did, nothing happens when I do that
2007-01-09T12:32:00.000Z	riotkittie	jlewis_	 is that a red hat thing? or perhaps a firefox extension?
2007-01-09T12:36:00.000Z	riotkittie	jlewis_	that sounds like a firefox extension. jlewis_ : do you still have your redhat install?
2007-01-09T13:25:00.000Z	jlewis_	riotkittie	yeah, I still have plenty of centos installs and fedora
