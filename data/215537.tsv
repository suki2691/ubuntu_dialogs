2008-08-06T03:10:00.000Z	CartoonCat		mmm, ok looks like this is related to not being able to detect my monitor correctly (as the nvidia drivers are loading and working)
2008-08-06T03:10:00.000Z	CartoonCat		is there a (simple) way to force specific monitor settings with out mucking with the xorg.conf file?
2008-08-06T03:12:00.000Z	soundray	CartoonCat	have you tried 'gksudo displayconfig-gtk'?
2008-08-06T03:17:00.000Z	soundray	CartoonCat	 'gksudo displayconfig-gtk' will be even easier
