2010-01-27T19:39:00.000Z	jcarroll		How long is Ubuntu 8.10 supported?  Has the window closed?
2010-01-27T19:40:00.000Z	jcarroll		My real question is: 'd like to upgrade from 8.04.3 LTS to the latest release (9.10); according to the doc's on help.ubuntu.com, the "supported" path is to upgrade through each release.  Is this correct?  Can I expect *support* while passing through 8.10 and 9.04?
2010-01-27T19:41:00.000Z	ouyes	jcarroll	 why, 8.04 is more stable and why to update, why not make fresh installation using a cd or a usb start driver
2010-01-27T19:44:00.000Z	ouyes	jcarroll	 I suggest that you make a fresh installation ,because the to upgrade to 9.10 will download a lot of data and cost you a lot of time
