2008-11-05T11:34:00.000Z	Agent7629	scientes	give me a quick second and ill get the exact setting, but i think its under Cube Color
2008-11-05T11:34:00.000Z	Agent7629	scientes	Desktop Cube => Appearance Tab => Cube color...
2008-11-05T11:35:00.000Z	Agent7629	scientes	can also scroll down for cube cap and put images on there if you want .. hope that helped
