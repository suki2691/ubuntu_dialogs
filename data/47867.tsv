2010-02-20T22:51:00.000Z	IsmAvatar		apt-get purge
2010-02-20T22:52:00.000Z	theadmin	IsmAvatar	Hm... interesting. Say, I have kubuntu-desktop, so I sudo apt-get purge kubuntu-desktop and it will remove KDE and all crap that comes with it?
2010-02-20T22:53:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	theadmin	not sure. Usually, purge just removes the package and directly associated packages, and then removes any leftover orphans
