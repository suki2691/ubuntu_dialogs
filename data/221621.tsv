2006-03-25T09:03:00.000Z	ArchAngelNix		Does anyone know where I can find a NIC compatibility list?
2006-03-25T09:04:00.000Z	ArchAngelNix		I just picked up a Dell P3, 866MHz, no NIC. I have a spare StarTech NIC sitting around. Wondering if that will work.
2006-03-25T09:06:00.000Z	ArchAngelNix		Amaranth I am installing Kubuntu on the Dell right now, just wondering if that NIC doesn't work, where I can find one that can.
