2009-03-10T09:43:00.000Z	Dacvak		Ever since I installed Emerald and Compiz-Fusion, double clicking the title bar makes the window roll up. I want it to maximize. Changing the settings in System>Window doesn't do anything. How can I fix it?

2009-03-10T09:44:00.000Z	Dacvak	shear_clone	I checked all around there. I couldn't find anything.
2009-03-10T09:45:00.000Z	shear_clone	Dacvak	stuff like this is compiz' job. i'm looking right now, but i believe it has to be somewhere around here
