2007-08-21T13:20:00.000Z	unity	valehru	what do you mean by "up?"
2007-08-21T13:21:00.000Z	unity	valehru	1280x1024 and 1600x1200 have different aspect ratios
2007-08-21T13:21:00.000Z	valehru	unity	thanks...will test both of them, using dual resolutions at the moment, want to see if I can get the resolution smaller than it is now....
