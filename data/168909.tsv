2011-07-09T03:27:00.000Z	Jesdisciple		Unetbootin is saying it can't find init... typing `exit' causes a kernel panic because /dev/console (I think) isn't found
2011-07-09T03:28:00.000Z	Jesdisciple		should I redo the Unetbootin install, or what?
2011-07-09T03:28:00.000Z	Byan	Jesdisciple	probably
2011-07-09T03:42:00.000Z	Byan	Jesdisciple	while thats true.. if it does fix it then I can call it a day..
