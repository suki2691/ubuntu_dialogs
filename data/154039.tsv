I try to load a LateX document (.tex) into kine/texmaker/gedit/emacas (whatever, really), but I cannot get the norwegian characters  to work. They come up as small questionmarks. But I can take _the same_ document that got interpretted without special characters, and still write them in it

2006-12-23T15:57:00.000Z	un_operateur	flux_	no real idea about tex? just a guess - after loading up the document can you refresh it?
