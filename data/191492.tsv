2006-04-09T08:29:00.000Z	Evixo		is there an alternative way to install mysql when apt-get install mysql-server let's you down by saying the file cannot be found?
2006-04-09T08:30:00.000Z	_jason	Evixo	best way would be to fix that problem, do you have breezy's main repository enabled?
2006-04-09T08:36:00.000Z	Evixo	_jason	: no I don't have the main repository enabled ... gonna do that now
2006-04-09T08:36:00.000Z	_jason	Evixo	ok, there is a wiki page on lamp that might help if you are setting up lamp instead of just mysql, want me to link you?
