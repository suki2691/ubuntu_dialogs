2010-03-27T14:45:00.000Z	tobylane		you know how language files are something like - program.identifying.string = "bonjour", is there a way to use an automatic translator on just the stuff in the quotes?
2010-03-27T14:46:00.000Z	Draglor	tobylane	yes ... grep the things in the quotes , translate it and write a new file ... but it's not an easy comman .. try read manuals of tr awk grep and sed
2010-03-27T14:47:00.000Z	Draglor	tobylane	I think you won't need awk .. sed and grep should be enough
