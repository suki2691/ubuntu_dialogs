2011-10-02T06:16:00.000Z	mystiqueba		hello, I need help with my microphone.  Only sound output is working not input.  I'm using a dell xps and it used to work fine before.
2011-10-02T06:16:00.000Z	gimble	mystiqueba	have you visited the input tab in your sound preferences?
2011-10-02T06:18:00.000Z	mystiqueba	gimble	yeah, I can't manipulate anything there.  The hardware currently seems to work for only "Analog Stereo Output"
2011-10-02T06:19:00.000Z	mystiqueba	gimble	never mind.  I figured it out.  Thanks anyway.
