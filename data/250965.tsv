2005-02-04T12:17:00.000Z	acidmaxd		can anyone give me more information about this? there are incomplete packages in the repository, for example Vega Strike (the game). There are vegastrike-data and vegastrike-music, but not the main package...
2005-02-04T12:18:00.000Z	acidmaxd		the game is not usable without the main package :(
2005-02-04T12:19:00.000Z	MainVoid	acidmaxd	best option is prob to talk to the maintainer of that package...
2005-02-04T12:20:00.000Z	MainVoid	acidmaxd	Oooppss.. ;)
