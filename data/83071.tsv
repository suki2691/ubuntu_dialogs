2008-10-05T13:17:00.000Z	Kharnov	ShinobiTeno	It won't let me. I installed it from a third party repo, and I forgot what it was.
2008-10-05T13:18:00.000Z	Kharnov	ShinobiTeno	Once I find the repo, what should I do?
2008-10-05T13:20:00.000Z	Kharnov	ShinobiTeno	Alright, I actually found the repo now, and force reinstalled it. But if I try to remove the package again, I get the same error.
