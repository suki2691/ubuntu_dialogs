2007-11-01T04:57:00.000Z	kcm		anyone have an idea of how to replace the kernel *and* modules the dapper install CD uses?
2007-11-01T04:59:00.000Z	kcm		basically, yes.  I need to update the kernel and modules to 2.6.15-51, only.
2007-11-01T04:59:00.000Z	niosop	kcm	look at reconstructor
2007-11-01T05:00:00.000Z	niosop	kcm	might work for you
