2008-08-19T03:38:00.000Z	tomasko	Gnea	load? you must be joking. haven't seen too many !commands go by to justify the 4-6 lines worth of spam ubottu produces per !command
2008-08-19T03:39:00.000Z	Gnea	tomasko	Actually, your offtopic rant about it, filled with negativeness is much more pollutant. I suggest you reconsider that concept.
