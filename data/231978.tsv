2010-02-25T19:15:00.000Z	null		Question: In Intrepid, if I enable my wired ethernet, even if it's a different subnet (192.168.2.1),  when I try to ping my wireless AP (192.168.1.1) I get a message from 192.168.2.1 saying there's no route to host. How can I have my wireless interface always take precedence?  Something with the route command I believe, but I don't know what to Google.
