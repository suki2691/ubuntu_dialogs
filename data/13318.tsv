2011-11-11T13:07:00.000Z	Lasers	barecracker	What IRC client?
2011-11-11T13:07:00.000Z	Lasers	barecracker	Well, that's not a real client. The features are there only if they added it.
2011-11-11T13:09:00.000Z	Lasers	barecracker	I understand. You shouldn't use webchat.freenode.net (web) as a permanent solution to IRC. :)
