2010-08-09T05:57:00.000Z	tripelb-livecd		pidgin just closed unexpectedly too. "maybe" I hit the button, edbian.  I've been running ubuntu on another HD (20G) for months with no issues. I installed windows on still another (40G) HD. Now I put in my brand new Hitachi. Everything was fine..... OK can I check the CD without rebooting it?
2010-08-09T05:59:00.000Z	tripelb-livecd		do I have to reboot to check the validity of my liveCD?
2010-08-09T06:00:00.000Z	tripelb-livecd		I am running on a liveCD hence "nick"
