2005-05-16T15:33:00.000Z	topyli	Fish-Face	how do they know what breezy will have when it's time to upgrade?
2005-05-16T15:34:00.000Z	Fish-Face	topyli	the FAQ states they inserted a tilde into the version, which will force the use of other upgrades. I don't know how apt-get works, in that respect, though
