2005-11-27T17:12:00.000Z	baggins		also. is there a nice list that i can use to decrypt the names of the releases (warty/hoary) into sensible release numbers?
2005-11-27T17:13:00.000Z	dooglus	baggins	it's year.month - 5.10 is 2005/Oct
2005-11-27T17:13:00.000Z	dooglus	baggins	it's not obvious though, is it.  5.10 < 5.04 mathematically
