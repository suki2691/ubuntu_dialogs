2005-02-11T13:43:00.000Z	balc		i cant get firestarter to startup automatically on boot...
2005-02-11T13:45:00.000Z	balc		does anyone here have firestarter firewall successfully installed?
2005-02-11T13:46:00.000Z	ficusplanet	balc	Have you installed any server software?  Because the default ubuntu setup does not need a firewall.
2005-02-11T13:47:00.000Z	ficusplanet	balc	No.  There are no open ports.
