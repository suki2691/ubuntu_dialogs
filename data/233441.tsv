2005-06-16T09:48:00.000Z	jared		hi all!  one question - how do I fix the log in screen so I can log in as root from the log in screen?  I get the message "system adminstrator not allowed to log in" on that screen.
2005-06-16T09:49:00.000Z	disasm	jared	now why would you want to run X as root?
2005-06-16T09:49:00.000Z	jared	crimsun	 where do I find that?  and disasm - i need to move some files manually without the use of the console.
2005-06-16T09:49:00.000Z	disasm	jared	sudo nautilus them
