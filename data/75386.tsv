2009-09-21T05:52:00.000Z	misteralexander		I forgot, how do I load new fonts onto my system?  I recall there being a terminal thing, stuff to type to update the cache.  Any ideas?  I've already searched Ubuntu Help.
2009-09-21T05:53:00.000Z	Out_Cold	misteralexander	go into synaptics package manager and search for new fonts
2009-09-21T05:54:00.000Z	misteralexander	Out_Cold	I've got the fonts, about 10,000 ttf's . . . I know I can just put them in "/home/username/.fonts . . . but wasn't there something about updating the cache?
