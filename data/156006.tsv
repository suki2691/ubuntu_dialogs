2006-12-02T15:14:00.000Z	toM|vendettA		Hi, can someone tell me how I can get the login screen for Ubuntu to show the users available, so I dont have to type in my account name, i can just click on my account and type in the password?
2006-12-02T15:15:00.000Z	dsnyders	toM|vendettA	you mean, like a dropdown list of users?
2006-12-02T15:16:00.000Z	toM|vendettA	dsnyders	like the windows xp login menu ( i just replaced xp with ubuntu, and my mom doesnt know how to logon, trying to make it as simple as possible for her )
