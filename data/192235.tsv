2006-04-02T09:28:00.000Z	David_Mills		Hi all, I'd like to know what to do with this bug I've discovered (or not): When I boot a dapper 5 live CD, I can't get static networking to work. I've looked in bugzilla.gnome.org, where they say the bug is fixed, but I can't see any trace of said fix getting into Dapper. I'va already asked on #launchpad, and they told me to come here.
