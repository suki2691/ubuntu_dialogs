2008-11-25T11:05:00.000Z	ahtmly2k		question; does the sound on games usually get affected by media players such as amarok?
2008-11-25T11:06:00.000Z	ahtmly2k		cause i cant seem to play open arena and listen to music at the same time
2008-11-25T11:08:00.000Z	faryshta	ahtmly2k	me to, I love open arena, and I can only enjoy it hearing death metal, so I don't think that is the problem.
