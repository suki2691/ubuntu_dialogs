2007-09-18T05:51:00.000Z	Jose		hi. i'd like to download unbuntu to try it out on livecd but i'm afraid it might interfere with my ms os
2007-09-18T05:52:00.000Z	Jose		can anyone assure me that it won't
2007-09-18T05:52:00.000Z	Jose		i mean downloading live cd to burn it later.  that itself won't interfere with my os?
