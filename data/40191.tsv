2010-03-05T04:25:00.000Z	neezer		I want to kill a process with PID of 2093, but I'm not sure how to. I tried using sudo top, then k to kill it and the PID, but it isn't doing the trick.
2010-03-05T04:27:00.000Z	stdisease	neezer	kill <pid> , kill -9 <pid> for more stubborn processes
2010-03-05T04:28:00.000Z	neezer	stdisease	is the PID going to be the same one that I see in top?
2010-03-05T04:28:00.000Z	stdisease	neezer	sure if it's the same app that's been running all along
