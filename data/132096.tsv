2009-11-12T11:06:00.000Z	zero00		why can i not delete a user i have already created it allows me to delete but when i open users/groups it reappears
2009-11-12T11:07:00.000Z	zero00		i accidentaly created the user with users and groups instead of using adduser --encrypt-home as i shouldve
2009-11-12T11:07:00.000Z	zero00		now i am stuck with an unencrypted user home that i cannot delete
2009-11-12T11:08:00.000Z	Billiard	zero00	what if you use userdel and manually remove their home dir
