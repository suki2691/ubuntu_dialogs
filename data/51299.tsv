2010-06-16T08:11:00.000Z	cd1zz		When I try to connect to the Ubuntu box from another computer using any VNC viewer, I get prompted for my VNC password and type it in. The remote screen shows up and everything appears to be working. However, when I start clicking around, nothing on the screen changes. At first I thought the mouse and keyboard inputs were disabled but they were not. I put both computers side by side and could watch

So, it appears that as soon as I connect, I get a static image, none of the video is changing on my viewer machine. I have tried both Real VNC viewer and Tight VNC viewer. I also tried using a different VNC server, TightVNC on the Ubuntu box, same problems. Any ideas?
