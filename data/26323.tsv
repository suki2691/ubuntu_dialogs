2010-09-12T02:32:00.000Z	lxadmin		I'm trying to allow all users to connect to open-sshd, but it seems that by default all users are denied
2010-09-12T02:32:00.000Z	lxadmin		I have explicitly allow each one
2010-09-12T02:32:00.000Z	lxadmin		is there a way to have sshd allow all users by default?
2010-09-12T02:33:00.000Z	idletask	lxadmin	what do you mean?
