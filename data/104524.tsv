2012-05-18T04:49:00.000Z	Boyo		I am installing Ubuntu.  It's asking to partition my current hard drive, which has Windows 7 installed.  It's asking me to size the partitions using a slider, but the partitions are not even named!
2012-05-18T04:50:00.000Z	Boyo		So I don't know which partition will be which size when I am done.
