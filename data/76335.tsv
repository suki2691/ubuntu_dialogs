2008-10-28T05:30:00.000Z	themiddleman		heres the situation: i have an old tosheba laptop with a pentium and 16 mega of ram, it has no usb, networking, (floppy only), so i am taking the hard drive out, putting it into my laptop and booting from a cd and using a flash drive / cd for transfering stuff.   so ive copied the ubuntu alternate cd (plan to run fluxbox) onto the hard drive and grub also, its booting to the kernel but it hangs on "early unpacking initramfs..." and there is no workaroun
2008-10-28T05:30:00.000Z	themiddleman		d to be found, so should i use an older kernel or what?

2008-10-28T05:33:00.000Z	themiddleman	danbh_intrepid	yeah, that just has crap for a package manager
