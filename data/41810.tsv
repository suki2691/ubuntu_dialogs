2010-02-22T07:53:00.000Z	jesse2		Hello.  I just re-installed ubuntu 9.10.  When I booted into the system, I chose to install the Nvidia driver.  The nvidia driver worked fine on this computer in a previous installation, but now when i reboot it gives me an error message and has me run in "low graphics" mode
2010-02-22T07:54:00.000Z	jesse2		is there a way i can re run the nvidia driver installation?
