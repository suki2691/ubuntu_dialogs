2008-06-30T07:20:00.000Z	Fryguy--	J-a-k-e	ask a question, don't ask to ask
2008-06-30T07:25:00.000Z	Fryguy--	J-a-k-e	and have you looked up what those errors mean?
2008-06-30T07:31:00.000Z	J-a-k-e	Fryguy--	this has only been a problem since I upgraded from 7.10 when 8.04 was released in April, error 17 refers to "can not mount selected partition" and error 13 refers to"Invalid or unsupported executable format" also I have already tried re-installing ubuntu. If I reinstall grub the problem seems to go away until i next restart
