2008-03-19T12:53:00.000Z	zcat[1]	tanner	put all your work on public ftp servers and let other people mirror it.. works for Linus
2008-03-19T12:54:00.000Z	tanner	zcat[1]	... right.. because thats exactly what i'm looking to do
2008-03-19T12:55:00.000Z	zcat[1]	tanner	add/remove programs.. type 'backup' in the search box. I rsync stuff to my webserver when I remember (a non-shared directory.. although I put a lot of stuff on the web too)
