2009-05-07T00:32:00.000Z	rhleis		Is there a simple way to make a usb thumb drive bootable? I used unetbootin to put eeebuntu on it, and it was supposed to make it bootable, but didn't. So, I used dd to copy the iso, but it's not bootable... and my internet connection is really slow because a wind storm took down the primary tower in my area, so I can't google it
2009-05-07T00:34:00.000Z	rhleis		Anyone?
