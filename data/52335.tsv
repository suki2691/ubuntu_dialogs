2009-09-02T05:55:00.000Z	Quarterstaff		I see Opera 10 browser is out now. I am running Ubuntu 9.04. Would I need to uninstall Opera9.64 before downloading Opera 10?
2009-09-02T05:56:00.000Z	Uuu	Quarterstaff	I downloaded new Opera as deb file and it removed old version automatically.
2009-09-02T05:57:00.000Z	Quarterstaff	Uuu	Thank you for your reply
2009-09-02T05:59:00.000Z	Uuu	Quarterstaff	but the settings (hold in ~/.opera) were not deleted, which is OK.
