2010-01-08T20:16:00.000Z	Narc		Hello folks, sorry to repeat: any idea on what can cause my left click to become unresponsive since I updated karmic a week or so ago ? I'm on a desktop computer, mouse works on Windows os, disabling Compiz changes nothing. Any help welcome, it's very crippling. Thanks.
