2010-04-29T12:20:00.000Z	Kalidarn	thrityfourfifty	skype cannot be used with pidgin, it's proprietary
2010-04-29T12:21:00.000Z	thrityfourfifty	Kalidarn	but there are other protocols that I would switch to if I find out that a chat program is scanning files in /etc
2010-04-29T12:21:00.000Z	Kalidarn	thrityfourfifty	i wasn't aware skype scanned files in /etc ?
