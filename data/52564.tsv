2009-07-16T01:07:00.000Z	pelle_k		Allright guys. Here we go. I'm trying to find out how to list *deliberately* installed packages. However, for some reason, packages that are installed as dependencies seem so be marked as "automatically installed: no". I'm just trying to find out the rationale/reason for that.

2009-07-16T01:10:00.000Z	pelle_k	Nitsuga	any reason for that behaviour? How *do* you install packages, and have the dependencies marked properly, as installed as "automatically"?
