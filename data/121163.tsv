2007-09-23T10:15:00.000Z	willrjmarshall		Ok. Fsck appears to be *doing* something now, so I'll leabe it running ;)
2007-09-23T10:17:00.000Z	__sork	willrjmarshall	what is the error msg again?
2007-09-23T10:19:00.000Z	willrjmarshall	__sork	, heguru: There isn't really one. When I boot in safe mode it throws some stuff at me too fast to read, then appears to  display some logs about various devices, then prints a few lines similar to "attached SCSI generic sg5 type 0", then hangs, then drops into initramfs
