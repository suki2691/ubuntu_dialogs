2006-07-19T11:45:00.000Z	sponix	rhican	 yeah, its not hard, there is only one file to edit.. want me to look it up for ya ?
2006-07-19T11:48:00.000Z	sponix	rhican	 /etc/X11/default-display-manager   just change from gdm to kdm in that file... I have ubuntu/kubuntu/xubuntu all installed, but as long as you have a working kdm that should pick right up
