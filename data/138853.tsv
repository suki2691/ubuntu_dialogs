2007-04-19T10:14:00.000Z	cBau		I use BitTornado with Feisty beta.... 4 torrents at one time, 50kB upload max per file, no additional lag on my other computer running WoW, no skyrocketing pings. I prefer BitTornado over all the other clients I have used.

2007-04-19T10:16:00.000Z	cBau	Angeluz	You are SOOO right, I leave that comp alone when I am torrenting. I am fortunate enough to have a couple comps sitting there. Torrents on one, WoW on the other.
