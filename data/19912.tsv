2011-02-19T04:45:00.000Z	rami1983		another question. i've uninstalled brasero but the update manager keeps asking me if i want to update it. is it possible that the program is not entirely  removed?
2011-02-19T04:46:00.000Z	a_p3rson	rami1983	use synaptic to search and see if a brasero dependency is left on there
2011-02-19T04:49:00.000Z	rami1983	a_p3rson	u are right. there were some leftovers. i thought the ubuntu software manager removed it completely
2011-02-19T04:50:00.000Z	a_p3rson	rami1983	in the future, you can use computer-janitor-gtk to check for leftover dependencies
