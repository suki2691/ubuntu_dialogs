2009-09-24T08:56:00.000Z	Logomachist		After I customize the Gnome applications menu, when I reboot the Gnome panels don't load and I need to delete my customizations in the .local/share/applications directory to get Ubuntu working again. This has happened twice and it is really annoying b/c I don't like the default setup. I would like to report this bug and maybe find a fix, but where do I report it?
