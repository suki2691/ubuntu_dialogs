2010-03-01T20:35:00.000Z	flamsmark		i'm using 9.10. i want to install a media player. i've heard good things about amarok, but i'm somewhat leery about the resource costs of installing a kde app on gnome. am i overly concerned; is there an alternate app that i should be looking at; or am i otherwise misinformed?
