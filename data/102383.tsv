2009-09-10T05:54:00.000Z	mh512		without going thru a double upgrade?
2009-09-10T05:54:00.000Z	rww	mh512	probably, but it's not supported at all. the only current supported upgrade path is 8.04 > 8.10 > 9.04.
2009-09-10T05:54:00.000Z	rww	mh512	When the next LTS comes out (10.04 or 10.10, we don't know yet), you'll be able to upgrade directly to that.
