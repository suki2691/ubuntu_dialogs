2005-11-15T06:58:00.000Z	hedonick	dylan_rogers	very unlikely... I used a separate /var partion for a couple of years withough the fragmentation rising over 10% (and with a lot of updating of debs, then purging etc... trashed that partition good I think)
2005-11-15T06:58:00.000Z	dylan_rogers	hedonick	so no?
2005-11-15T06:59:00.000Z	hedonick	dylan_rogers	could be extreme cases... but generally I think no
2005-11-15T06:59:00.000Z	dylan_rogers	hedonick	great
