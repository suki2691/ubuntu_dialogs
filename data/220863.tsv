2005-09-11T06:14:00.000Z	twibbler		Im just curious and please say if this is not the place to ask. but during the chat about desktops . i wondered With linux being all about choice and there being a lot of choice can it evere replace windoze .....
2005-09-11T06:16:00.000Z	robzon	twibbler	"replace"... I don't think so... but I'm sure it has the potential to take A LOT of desktop market share... it will just co-exist with windows... but I bet it's share will grow
2005-09-11T06:17:00.000Z	twibbler	robzon	that is my thought but we are just swiching all desktops over to ubuntu ....
