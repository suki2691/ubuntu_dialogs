2012-03-05T19:03:00.000Z	heero_		just a quick question: anyone tried "ls -d" lately? shouldn't that list directories??? all I'm getting is "." on the next line and that's it. even doing sudo ls -d on / only gives "."
2012-03-05T19:05:00.000Z	heero_		ls gives a list of files in a directory, why not ls -d giving a list of only directories in the current directory?

2012-03-05T19:08:00.000Z	lolcat^	heero_	ls-d is dangerous
