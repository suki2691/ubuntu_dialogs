2008-04-25T04:22:00.000Z	ibleed		i only have swap / and /home partitions.  what other possible partitions might i want and what might their sizes be ?
2008-04-25T04:23:00.000Z	ere4si	ibleed	a partition for / is handy
2008-04-25T04:23:00.000Z	ibleed	ere4si	yes i have swap, /, and /home.  i'm wondering what others are useful
