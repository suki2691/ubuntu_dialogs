2005-01-09T10:35:00.000Z	Ravenlock		A description of the problem: CD in drive, boots into the install, allows me to select my location and language, and then does the "scanning CDrom" part and freezes on a blue screen
2005-01-09T10:35:00.000Z	Ravenlock		This seems similar to the behavior I got from a straight Debian install CD, which told me it couldn't read the image.
