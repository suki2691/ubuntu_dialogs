2009-08-13T02:31:00.000Z	MOUD		I want to reinstall Ubuntu but I have Windows XP installed. If I remove the ubuntu partition and create a new one, will XP still be on the grub menu?
2009-08-13T02:32:00.000Z	MOUD		mostly is "not enough free space" and "cannot open /etc/****    to load file"  .   Also, I still have around 700MB of free disk space -.-
2009-08-13T02:34:00.000Z	MOUD		oh ok
2009-08-13T02:35:00.000Z	mzz	MOUD	but if you're in the installer you'll almost certainly be offered to install grub near the end of it, at which time it should pick up any windows partitions too.
