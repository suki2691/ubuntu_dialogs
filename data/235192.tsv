2005-05-27T12:21:00.000Z	djames		i switched to ubuntu from gentoo. Seems like SCP file transfers are faster in gentoo. Anyone have issues with lagging performance with SCP in ubuntu?
2005-05-27T12:22:00.000Z	djames		well, ubuntu by default uses EXT3 FS. my gentoo had JFS...maybe JFS boosted it...writing files faster
