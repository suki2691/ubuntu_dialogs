2010-12-16T03:28:00.000Z	madjr	dexi	try to add it back
2010-12-16T03:29:00.000Z	dexi	madjr	i don't find anything in "add to panel" for it. Window list just shoes some small lines... I accidentally clicked "New Panel" and now I have a panel-sized empty space on the side of my window, right clicked goes to desktop... it created the space for a panel, but not the panel... AUGH
