2011-08-31T00:32:00.000Z	Osmond		Is Unity incompatible with Radeon video cards? When I boot up in the Unity desktop I get the logon screen, then when I log in I get just a splash screen with nothing.  I removed compiz-core and restarted, when I logged in that time I got the splash screen, but that time I got a notification box telling me there were available internet connections but I still get no task bars or anything.
2011-08-31T00:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	Osmond	 why did you get the idea to remove compiz-core?
2011-08-31T00:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	Osmond	 whats the exact video card? unity needs 3d acell features to work properly. Unless you use unity-2d
