2007-01-13T10:25:00.000Z	Rio		i want to run azureus as root, but for some reason "sudo azureus" does not work.  whats another way around it?
2007-01-13T10:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	Rio	bad idea, do not run anything as root
2007-01-13T10:26:00.000Z	Rio	erUSUL	when i run it as any other user, it asks me to update the program, then fails 'cause that user doesnt have any privelages
2007-01-13T10:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	Rio	that's why i stopped using it ;)
