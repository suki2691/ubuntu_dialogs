2009-03-31T22:41:00.000Z	Downing		Hello I'd like to speak to someone about graphic card's drivers and how I could sort them out. Currently I am using "NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (version 177) [recommended]" but it's still quite bad and all dodgey of that makes any sense, scrolling isn't smooth and so on. I'd appreciate if someone could help me with this in private as there's quite a lot of people speaking in the channel. Thanks, P.S. I think ive got geforce 9600gs
