Is there any way to speed this up. It makes opening even the smallest apps really slow. This didn't happen when I had windows on this computer.

2009-12-22T21:41:00.000Z	Hyppy	bwallen	firefox can get bogged down when there are a massive amount of tabs and its been running for a while.  3.5 is better than 3.0, if you don't have it yet.  Otherwise, I suggest closing and reopening it at least daily
