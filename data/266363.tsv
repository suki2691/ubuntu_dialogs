2010-01-24T06:57:00.000Z	Talon_		I was here a couple days ago, asking about ram usage inside ubuntu 9.10, I had 1gb and tried running a virtual machine (windows xp) with virtual box. 83% of my memory was used.
2010-01-24T06:58:00.000Z	Talon_		using system monitor and my new machine I built to accomidate this, I now have 8gb of ram, and it's still using it ALL! gnomes system monitor shows 16% used by programs and 83% as cache
2010-01-24T07:00:00.000Z	Talon_		so does cache matter? 16+83 = 99, i assumed 99% of my ram is in use
2010-01-24T07:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Talon_	 so its used as cache.. that how its supposed to work
