2012-06-14T15:25:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Macready	 the software in the software centre is free
2012-06-14T15:26:00.000Z	MonkeyDust		...and learned something new :)
2012-06-14T15:26:00.000Z	Macready	MonkeyDust	- no, so today I bought the Humble Bundle for about $8.50 (Â£6 ish). 8 cool games - but would like to verify that they are all purchased properly.
