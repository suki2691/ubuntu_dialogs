2008-02-06T17:28:00.000Z	geer1		thnx. i'm running gutsy and the default (restricted) driver is 100.14.19, however 169.09 has come out. will ubuntu upgrade 'automatically' to this new driver soon, or do we need to go the route with envy and such.

2008-02-06T17:33:00.000Z	Bodsda	geer1	search ubuntu docs for drivers
