2011-02-02T18:38:00.000Z	Zenger		I have installed lampp it's working fine and stuff like that. But i hate that I must run sudo /opt/lampp lampp and enter my password each time . Can I create an link so that it makes su mypass and then runs the lampp and doesn't require my password .. ???? maybe a bash script..
