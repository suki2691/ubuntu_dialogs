2008-09-28T23:45:00.000Z	wam		Hi, does the exim package support radius? Or will I have to compile it myself?
2008-09-28T23:45:00.000Z	unstable	wam	/join #exim
2008-09-28T23:53:00.000Z	wam	unstable	I'm not sure - exim does support radius, however the docs say that you'd have to tell it when compiling it. Now I'm wondering if it is working out-of-the-box in ubuntu or not.
2008-09-28T23:53:00.000Z	wam	unstable	so I think, #exim won't help much.
