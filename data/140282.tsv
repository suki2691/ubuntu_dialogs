2007-04-12T13:53:00.000Z	scottam		pathogen246: there are some free ones out there like clamAV or something
2007-04-12T13:53:00.000Z	scottam		pathogen246: clamAV should work from linux or windows
2007-04-12T13:54:00.000Z	Pathogen246	scottam	anyway i can run a virus scan from linux to windows partition?
