2006-08-25T16:57:00.000Z	nate_d		My X session seems to log me out randomly.  I will come home from work and my system will be at the login screen.  I know it's not rebooting because "uptime" says 5 days.  Any ideas on why this is happening?
2006-08-25T16:58:00.000Z	kitche	nate_d	could be that X is setup to log out on a timeout
2006-08-25T16:58:00.000Z	nate_d	kitche	would that be in the gdm setup?
2006-08-25T16:59:00.000Z	kitche	nate_d	it probably is
