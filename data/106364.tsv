2011-03-30T07:12:00.000Z	Sik		So: trying to install Ubuntu from the LiveCD. First time, it fails mid-install because of "I/O error" (probably failed to read something, most likely would have worked if it had retried, but it didn't even give me the option to clean the CD and retry!).
2011-03-30T07:12:00.000Z	Sik		Second time, it copies everything, then it fails when configuring something, and the error message isn't helpful (besides no giving me any real information, it sends me straight to the LiveCD install in hope that I can "research about it").
2011-03-30T07:13:00.000Z	Sik		And now I think that it also screwed up the ext4 partition it made, because now the installer is completely unable to recognise the partitions on the hard disk and the only options it gives me are to wipe it!
