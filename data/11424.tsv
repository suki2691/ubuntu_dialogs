2012-07-14T09:50:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor		When Update Manager asks if I want to replace a system config file or keep the old one, is there any way to "merge" the two?
2012-07-14T09:51:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor		http://paste.ubuntu.com/1091038/ I want it to add the 3 with +'s, but keep the 4 google earth ones with -'s
