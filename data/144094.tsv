2007-04-07T10:58:00.000Z	atoponce	LordLimecat	well, he can edit his /etc/X11/xorg.conf from anything, then restart X
2007-04-07T10:58:00.000Z	LordLimecat	atoponce	the nvidia distributed driver installer needs to be run from console
2007-04-07T10:59:00.000Z	atoponce	LordLimecat	yeah. makes more sense now. he wasn't exactly clear on what he was trying to do
