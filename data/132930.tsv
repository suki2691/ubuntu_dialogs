2007-05-27T14:33:00.000Z	Lycus		I have one other silly question. I have my Ubuntu hostname set as thoth - but other computers on my network don't recognize this, and say invalid hostname. However, it recognizes other computers, such as my OS X machine named setesh - is there something I need to do to get other computers to associate my Ubuntu machine's hostname with its IP?

2007-05-27T14:35:00.000Z	Lycus	kalon33	Can I enable it myself, or is it simply not there?
2007-05-27T14:35:00.000Z	kalon33	Lycus	that's the question :p
