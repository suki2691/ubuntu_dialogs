2009-02-15T00:09:00.000Z	gg1234		Need help doing a partion. Ubuntu recognizes my NTFS partitions in "My Computer" but in the instalation it thinks that the hard drive has no partions. However it does recognize my other hard drive that is partioned into  winXP and a pure data only partion. Please help.
