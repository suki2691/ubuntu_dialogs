2008-12-31T04:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mimi	can you give us the output of: ifconfig eth1 (in a pastebin)
2008-12-31T04:03:00.000Z	Mimi	ActionParsnip	... LAME. Thanks :P I didnt know I had to type the NIC name after ifconfig, thank you!
2008-12-31T04:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Mimi	if you use a specific interface you get a bit more info, ifcofig on its own kinda sucks
