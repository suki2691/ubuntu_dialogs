2009-06-27T04:59:00.000Z	geirha	dazjorz	It's a good idea to have a root shell open when editing sudoers. Visudo will not warn you if you revoke your own sudo privileges ....
2009-06-27T04:59:00.000Z	dazjorz	geirha	oh, of course, true
2009-06-27T04:59:00.000Z	dazjorz	geirha	I thought you were talking about syntax errors :)
