2008-07-01T20:49:00.000Z	vasily		 My sound works well under autodetect, alsa, oss etc. So, the sound manuals will not help. I have one very specific problem: I need to make USB mic working. This is the only option for me since my soundcard does not have a mic jack. I tryed so far EVERY option in System-preferenses-sound and in volume control. I do not have any sound from my mic. It was recognized by the system since I got DSP1 in my devises as I read in Google. Please
