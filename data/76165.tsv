2008-10-30T20:53:00.000Z	mikebeecham		I installed 8.04 the other night...it is worth upgrading to 8.10 yet?
2008-10-30T20:53:00.000Z	mker	mikebeecham	sure, it's pretty nice.
2008-10-30T20:54:00.000Z	mikebeecham	dug_	mker I'm a 2 day user of Linux...would it be better to stay stable, or are the bugs going to be negligible?
2008-10-30T20:55:00.000Z	mker	mikebeecham	well I haven't noticed any bugs so far (after using it for several minutes :) ) but I don't *think* there's anything to worry about.
