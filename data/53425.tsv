2009-11-15T20:51:00.000Z	Jakobsen		I just did a MinimalCD install of Ubuntu 9.04 but I never got prompted for a user and password. What's the default login?

2009-11-15T20:52:00.000Z	Jakobsen	leaf-sheep	I know, but I never got prompted during the install..
2009-11-15T20:54:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	Jakobsen	Heh. Either somebody else installed the machine or you really didn't remember seeing user/password. ;o
