2010-08-02T12:13:00.000Z	mm2000		hi there, I am having some problems with my internet connection. For some reason some webpages loads very fast and som very slow (or not at all) Any ideas what the problem can be? I have make sure ipv6 is off and I have the same problem in both firefox and chrome.
2010-08-02T12:13:00.000Z	TiK	mm2000	how do you disable ipv6?
2010-08-02T12:14:00.000Z	mm2000	TiK	I have tried that but still have the same problem.
