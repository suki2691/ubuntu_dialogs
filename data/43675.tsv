2009-11-15T08:17:00.000Z	ace_		I am trying to install Ubuntu 9.10 on my Toshiba A135-S2266 Satellite laptop. When it comes to the menu to type my name I have no keyboard or mouse. I've been working on this all day and cannot figure out a solution. I hooked up an external keyboard and mouse to get install. Can anyone help me with this?
