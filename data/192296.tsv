2006-09-07T12:08:00.000Z	smacky_wolf		yes, but is your machine called something other than localhost?
2006-09-07T12:08:00.000Z	harisund	smacky_wolf	generally localhost always refers to the same machine.
2006-09-07T12:09:00.000Z	smacky_wolf	harisund	somehow I managed to make my point to chakat (my machine name) and it worked for a bit, but then something else broke o.o
