2008-01-09T19:25:00.000Z	LjL	Belisarivs	i was under the impression that it's there by default.
2008-01-09T19:44:00.000Z	LjL	Belisarivs	well no, that's only to be able to use it *with mp3 files*. for other, non-patent-encumbered, types of files, libtunepimp5 is a dependency
2008-01-09T19:49:00.000Z	LjL	Belisarivs	you might want to file a bug because of the fact it's not automatically installed when you install mp3 support. on kubuntu at least, i think it should.
