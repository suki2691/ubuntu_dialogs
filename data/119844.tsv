2008-04-29T13:41:00.000Z	shashi__		I am running Ubuntu 7.10 AMD64 Desktop. I want to go for fresh installation of 8.04 . In my existing 7.10 , i have about 50GB of data in my home directory. I don't have any place to take the backup of that much of data. My question is, when i am installing 8.04, is there any option Ubuntu gives to preserve the /home directory ?
2008-04-29T13:42:00.000Z	bazhang	shashi__	is it a seperate /home partition?
2008-04-29T13:43:00.000Z	bazhang	shashi__	then best to upgrade via the net
2008-10-31T14:41:00.000Z	bazhang	shashi__	use paste.ubuntu.com
