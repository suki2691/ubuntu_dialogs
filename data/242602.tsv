2005-04-20T14:01:00.000Z	Enspyron		I have installed php, apache 2 packages and everything associated with it by synaptic, but when I try to search for the config files I can't find them (I can't find any file that has php in it's name with the search function) So, where can I find packages I just installed?
2005-04-20T14:03:00.000Z	Enspyron		thx, I have found php.ini. But why couldn't the search function find it in the first place?
2005-04-20T14:03:00.000Z	Enspyron		and where is httpd.ini
2005-04-20T14:04:00.000Z	FreezerX	Enspyron	you mean httpd.conf
