2004-11-06T13:01:00.000Z	shawnr		Using remote desktop on my Ubuntu machine and apparently it's a program called Vino that does it. I would really like to change the default port to something else as it worries me to have the default. I have no idea how to change it and I've speent hours looking... Anyone know?
2004-11-06T13:02:00.000Z	bob2	shawnr	you want to change thedefault port for security reasons?
2004-11-06T13:04:00.000Z	bob2	shawnr	that doesn't really help
2004-11-06T13:05:00.000Z	bob2	shawnr	yes
