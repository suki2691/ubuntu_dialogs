2007-11-29T07:15:00.000Z	John_R	jsoftw	lower overhead with xubuntu, but the shell integration isnt all that. ubuntu-desktop is pretty slick
2007-11-29T07:17:00.000Z	jsoftw	John_R	what do you mean the shell intergration...?
2007-11-29T07:22:00.000Z	John_R	jsoftw	if you are looking for something low-overhead that emulates windows, try icewm
