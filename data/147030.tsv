2007-04-30T07:06:00.000Z	jvolkman		I love KDE technologically, but I hate it's cluttered look
2007-04-30T07:07:00.000Z	jvolkman		so I stick to gnome and use Konqueror, Kate, etc. as needed.

2007-04-30T07:10:00.000Z	jvolkman	dimeotane	there really is no difference other than the differences between KDE and Gnome.
