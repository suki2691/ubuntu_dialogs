2010-02-04T20:34:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	Kamokow	 I think it is a system DLL (MIDAS.DLL).  I believe its used for ODBC
2010-02-04T20:36:00.000Z	Kamokow	k0d3g3ar	Well, if the dll is usually in the same folder, it will probably work in the same folder, otherwise, it probably wont, just like it works in windows... (unless im wrong, I dont really use wine much anymore)
