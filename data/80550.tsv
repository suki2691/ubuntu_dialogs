2009-07-22T08:56:00.000Z	rhl6856		can anyone here help me with getting my onboard ATI cards DVI port to work?
2009-07-22T08:56:00.000Z	rhl6856		xrandr detects the port, but it can't detect the tv
2009-07-22T08:56:00.000Z	dotblank	rhl6856	there should be a way to force detection
2009-07-22T08:57:00.000Z	dotblank	rhl6856	or is this a DVI TV
