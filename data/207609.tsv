2005-11-23T16:47:00.000Z	N1omi		is there a way i can launce XCFE settings from CLI?
2005-11-23T16:48:00.000Z	Blissex	N1omi	almost surely so, the XFCE4 control panel is a program IIRC. Ask in #XFCE perhaps...
2005-11-23T16:49:00.000Z	Blissex	N1omi	just looked, it is called 'xfce-setting-show'
2005-11-23T16:50:00.000Z	N1omi	Blissex	thanks! settings aren't being launched correctly from the terminal either >_<
