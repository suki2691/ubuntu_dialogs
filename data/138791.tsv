2007-04-20T08:31:00.000Z	adultswim		I understand this may not be the correct channel to aask this --- if not, just point me to the correct channel :P     When using beryl, my video playback on VLC fails... when I switch back to the Metacity window manager, it works fine... any ideas whats going on?
2007-04-20T08:32:00.000Z	boojit	adultswim	i have problems with VLC under beryl too -- it just doesn't work well. I had to go to Mplayer which works fine when using xvid
