2011-04-29T03:17:00.000Z	compdoc		I notice in a fresh install of natty, that services like acpid and irqbalance are not set to run. Are these not needed anymore? I intend to use the box as a qemu-KVM server
2011-04-29T03:18:00.000Z	acicula	compdoc	you mean the kernel services?
2011-04-29T03:18:00.000Z	compdoc	acicula	well, I'm using Boot-up manager, and its the services that start at boot
2011-04-29T03:20:00.000Z	acicula	compdoc	err im not familiar with boot-up manager. the services you mentioned sound familiar but are you experiencing an actual problem or just wondering why they are not appearing anymore?
