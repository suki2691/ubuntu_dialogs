2009-12-05T05:49:00.000Z	WinterWeaver		erm... what does this do ?... "> /dev/null 2>&1" ... I know the first ">" sends the output to whatever comes next, but have no idea what the rest is
2009-12-05T05:49:00.000Z	rww	WinterWeaver	it sends error output too
2009-12-05T05:50:00.000Z	WinterWeaver	chmac	rww, ok thx... so what is /dev/null ... is it like a Null in coding? ie... nothing? O.o
2009-12-05T05:51:00.000Z	rww	WinterWeaver	it's a black hole. if you send stuff there, it disappears
