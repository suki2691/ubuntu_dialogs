2010-04-28T23:28:00.000Z	amereservant		Can a mini install be done from the full install cd?  The mini install disk is missing the necessary drivers for my network card, so it won't work.

2010-04-28T23:29:00.000Z	m0RrE	amereservant	if you however get it to work in some random way, plz tell me. :P
2010-04-28T23:29:00.000Z	amereservant	m0RrE	Dang.  I was afraid of that.  I have no idea how to find the driver it needs to make the mini install work.
