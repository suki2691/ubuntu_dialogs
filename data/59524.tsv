2009-04-24T15:02:00.000Z	biNdle		ok here goes: a month back, i deleted windows by mistake. then i loaded on ubuntu. now, i have vista and i want to load it on (JUST VISTA). however, when i try, it doesnt work, because it says it needs an ntfs partition (which i dont have). i also tried the GPart live cd, and for some reason it failed to work. ANY SUGGESTIONS?

2009-04-24T15:03:00.000Z	biNdle	faileas	so do what i did to windows and delete everything\
2009-04-24T15:04:00.000Z	faileas	biNdle	yup. I tend to do that when i want to totally change over OSes, just in case
