2005-05-26T06:33:00.000Z	SantaOne		Sorry for the offtopic-question:  Is there anyone from the USA ?  I am going to fly to the USA in the next time,  and the cheapest destination is Orlando.  So I try to find a VERY cheap way to travel from Orlando to Los Angeles (maybe by Bus or train?)  what is the cheapest way?
2005-05-26T06:34:00.000Z	nalioth	SantaOne	the bus would be the cheapest
2005-05-26T06:34:00.000Z	nalioth	SantaOne	if you can make advanced arrangements, you might get a flight cheaper, but that takes some planning
2005-05-26T06:40:00.000Z	SantaOne	nalioth	how can I find out how much such a bus ticket costs, please?
