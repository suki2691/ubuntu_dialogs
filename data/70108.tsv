2009-10-31T21:17:00.000Z	SJr		I suspect that my upgrade to Karmic didn't go so well, it got locked up a few times, and thten I finally just completed it with dpkg --configure -a, but now my system seems unstable, things like Appport crash, I can't hibernate or suspend to RAM and bring the system back up. Is there perhaps something I forgot to do, or is it time to reinstall?
