2007-03-25T08:48:00.000Z	morpheus74		Hello.  I'm having some issues with the internet connection.  I installed 6.10 on my parents computer that has only a pci wireless card.  I was able to download all the updates, but when trying to 'surf the web' pages sometimes load, and sometimes will not.  Any ideas?
