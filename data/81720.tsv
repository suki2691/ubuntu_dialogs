2008-11-04T18:28:00.000Z	YlandeFaran		I can watch movies with Movie Player, and with mplayer. But when I try to run something with vlc, I get nothing (if I try to right-click on the file)
2008-11-04T18:29:00.000Z	YlandeFaran		if I try to run the movie with vlc from the terminal, I get the sound in the background, but I get no picture.
2008-11-04T18:29:00.000Z	YlandeFaran		What could be the problem?
