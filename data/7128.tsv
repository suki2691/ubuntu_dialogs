2012-02-19T02:03:00.000Z	thatkid		How do I transfer a .zip file to a USB device when I'm being forced to work in a "read-only file system"?
2012-02-19T02:03:00.000Z	thatkid		Alternatively, how do I make it not a read-only file system?
2012-02-19T02:04:00.000Z	thatkid		So there is absolutely no way I can back up these files? I have root access, if that helps any
