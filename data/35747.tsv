2010-09-29T23:50:00.000Z	jimjimovich		what is the best way to restrict use of an application to a group of users (and assuming my users are smart and know how to Alt+F2)
2010-09-29T23:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	jimjimovich	set executing bit only to the group they belong to
2010-09-29T23:51:00.000Z	jimjimovich	erUSUL	will this get reset when apt updates that application?
2010-09-29T23:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	jimjimovich	probably; but i dunno for sure
