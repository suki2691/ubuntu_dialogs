2008-11-22T03:52:00.000Z	garret		@thunderstorm have you tried using grep?
2008-11-22T03:53:00.000Z	thunderstorm	garret	yes, but i dont know, why rsync in the intrepid version makes the output so bad - before intrepid i see all "Deleted" lines on top - its better than now
2008-11-22T03:54:00.000Z	thunderstorm	garret	now i cannot find the deleted lines - they are in middle of the file, ordered by directory name
2008-11-22T03:56:00.000Z	thunderstorm	garret	its a problem with the new rsync version 3.0.3?
