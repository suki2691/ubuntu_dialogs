2005-08-08T12:02:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	anwar	and ppp connections that set the DNS
2005-08-08T12:03:00.000Z	anwar	HrdwrBoB	it's all ok on startup but I suddenly noticed that I can't browse or do anything and when I check the resolv.conf I don't see my dns servers there.i only see 10.0.0.138(my gateway ip)
