2011-06-29T23:47:00.000Z	zeroedout		You can try to use something like firestarted to config it easy... or just disable it completely
2011-06-29T23:48:00.000Z	Pici	zeroedout	firestarter is deprecated, gufw is what we are recommending now.
2011-06-29T23:49:00.000Z	Pici	zeroedout	ufw is the cli equivalent, they both interface with iptables though.
