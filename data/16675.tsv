2011-05-08T15:20:00.000Z	phibxr		Do I really need to enable HDMI-video output to send Audio through HDMI, or is it just my TV ignoring the Audio signal until it receives Video too?
2011-05-08T15:26:00.000Z	uabn93	phibxr	Thanks. I think I will just end up getting NVidia. I'm mostly worried about AGP support.
2011-05-08T15:27:00.000Z	phibxr	uabn93	been a long time since I used AGP since I've only had laptops the past few years, but my last AGP-card worked fine, and NVIDIA keep a very high release pace for new drivers and generally tend to give the linux drivers attention. :)
