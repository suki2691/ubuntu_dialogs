2010-07-30T16:01:00.000Z	pvh_sa		hi there. ubuntu 10.04, when i do an apt-get upgrade or dist-upgrade  libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-graph-dev libboost-serialization-dev are kept back - any idea why? i got no apt preferences for this set
2010-07-30T16:02:00.000Z	USGIshimura	pvh_sa	they're kept back because they didn't do well in school
2010-07-30T16:02:00.000Z	pvh_sa	USGIshimura	ah! clearly! apt-cache policy seems to suggest otherwise though
2010-07-30T16:02:00.000Z	USGIshimura	pvh_sa	on a more serious note, perhaps it has something to do with dependencies?
