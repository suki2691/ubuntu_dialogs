2007-10-23T02:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	LjL-Temp	lol, so everyone says, but i only do clean installs, and have never done it.
2007-10-23T02:36:00.000Z	LjL-Temp	IndyGunFreak	well, it's certainly possible to reinstall without losing the /home directory, but it requires some trickery
2007-10-23T02:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	LjL-Temp	i have no doubt its possible, i just always doc lean installs, don't really know why.
