2005-04-18T08:04:00.000Z	george		sorry to bother you again, one last question though.  How do I set my default run level?  I want to set it as such that I don't boot directly into x, but to a vga console (at least that's what my graphics driver wants me to do)
2005-04-18T08:05:00.000Z	george		thanks again =)
