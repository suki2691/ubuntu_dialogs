2008-05-01T06:36:00.000Z	kneeki	amirman84	Good to hear! How do I go about doing the same thing?
2008-05-01T06:37:00.000Z	amirman84	kneeki	it involved editing the xorg.conf file to force it to recognize your driver and your resolution etc. , i am a total noob so i couldn't walk you through it with any assurance that i wouldnt mess it up more, but i know that if you go to #compiz and describe your problem to them someone there will be very able to help you
2008-05-01T06:38:00.000Z	kneeki	amirman84	thanks! I'm going to google it first though, to see if anything comes up :)
