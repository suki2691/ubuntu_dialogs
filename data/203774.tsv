2005-12-20T08:20:00.000Z	nickrude	skierkegaard	you can use soundjuicer, but you'll need to do the steps at the end of the preferences section of soundjuicers' help
2005-12-20T08:21:00.000Z	nickrude	skierkegaard	you may need to install lame for abcde to do mp3's
2005-12-20T08:25:00.000Z	nickrude	skierkegaard	no, apt-get install lame ; if it that doesn't work, check out wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto
