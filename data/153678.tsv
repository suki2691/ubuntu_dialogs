2006-12-24T07:48:00.000Z	jpjacobs	wkerzend	i'd use make menuconfig :) it's much handier imho
2006-12-24T07:50:00.000Z	jpjacobs	wkerzend	there's nothing really wrong with it, i just like navigating by keyboard over navigating by mouse and having to switch all the time to type something in, to swap fields,...
