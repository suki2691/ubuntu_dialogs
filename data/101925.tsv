2008-03-24T22:05:00.000Z	unop__	Creeture	just don't change your nick in the channel - why fight that?
2008-03-24T22:06:00.000Z	Creeture	unop__	I'm not fighting it. I'm just typing this one last line so that now I've equaled the amount of BS that the automated message causes. Now we're all caught up.
