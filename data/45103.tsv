2009-12-10T03:15:00.000Z	Tiders		In Karmic... How come my speakers "pop" when a sound is made sometimes
2009-12-10T03:16:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Tiders	Probably pulseaudio. It sucks big time/
2009-12-10T03:16:00.000Z	Tiders	linuxguy2009	Any fixes or workarounds?
2009-12-10T03:17:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Tiders	remove pulseaudio and use alsamixer CLI or gnome-alsamixer as replacements for the loss of the panel sound volume control that you will lose. Sucks I know.
