I can get two to run, (they are on a dual head Nvidia card using nvidia-settings) then I have a second card. Screens and graphics seeis it but it won't do anything (can't save settings) and nvidia-setting won't work. I've tried manually editing the xorg.conf and well I'd like to stay away from that. Any suggestions?
