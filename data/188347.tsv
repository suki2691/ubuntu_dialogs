2007-06-05T16:10:00.000Z	Pupeno		I want to install Ubuntu in my MacBook Pro. Should I turn FileVault off to reziseVolume?

2007-06-05T16:13:00.000Z	Pupeno	mc44	according to other sources, bootcamp is not needed if you use refit and that guide tells me to install bootcamp (and doesn't mention anything about wether I should run bootcamp's wizard or not). And it *doesn't* mention FileVault at all.
