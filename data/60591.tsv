Can you in a shell script do a CASE under another CASE.  Like you can do IF then, IF then Else, Else.  but cases seems to be reconising my ending esac for the second case for my first one.

2009-04-09T19:57:00.000Z	stodorovic	djtoast	oh right. I foolishly assumed you were using bash. The ksh man page might have more info, but as you say, you fixed it :)
