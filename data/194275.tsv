2006-10-28T05:09:00.000Z	budluva		can someone help me out here....i know that glxgears is not a benchmarking tool....but im installing ati's fglrx 8.29.6 drivers from ati.com and everything seemed to go ok, fglrxinfo works fine, but glxgears is showing like 200fps, i have an athlon64 4000+ 1 gig ram, ati x600, i should be getting like 2000-3000
2006-10-28T05:10:00.000Z	budluva		well my 5 year old machine with an fx5500 gets 2700fps
