2009-04-27T09:01:00.000Z	asiks		So when I do manual partition, what do i put as the mount point?
2009-04-27T09:01:00.000Z	scunizi	asiks	make 3 partitions / for root, /home for home and /swap  ..
2009-04-27T09:11:00.000Z	scunizi	asiks	on initial install there's LOTS of room in the 10 gig partition.. just in case you install LAMP or other stuff that gets stuck there.
2009-04-27T09:17:00.000Z	scunizi	asiks	forget root2.. no need
