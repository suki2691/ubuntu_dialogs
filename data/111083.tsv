2007-12-03T06:15:00.000Z	nano|marek		I understand taht k3b has mp3 support in the form of libk3b2-mp3. Is there something similar for any of the Gnome equivalents? which one shoukld I go with
2007-12-03T06:15:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz	nano|marek	i read somewhere that brasero is a decent gnome replacement for k3b
2007-12-03T06:15:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz	nano|marek	although, i don't see why you couldn't just run k3b in gnome...
2007-12-03T06:16:00.000Z	nano|marek	corruptionoflulz	ok thanks for the advice
