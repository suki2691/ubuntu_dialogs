2009-04-20T00:27:00.000Z	Slart	AndyTimUbuntu	you might want to rephrase that.. I can't make sense of your question
2009-04-20T00:28:00.000Z	AndyTimUbuntu	Slart	Thanks for your response.  I am wondering if there is an Ubuntu initrd with support for mounting the squashfs image via HTTP (maybe httpfs FUSE module)
2009-04-20T00:29:00.000Z	Slart	AndyTimUbuntu	hmm.. no idea, sorry.. never messed with that
