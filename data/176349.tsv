2007-03-07T11:16:00.000Z	Jimme1		How can I force an unmount? umount -f doesn't work
2007-03-07T11:16:00.000Z	Jimme1		umount: /media/cdrom0: device is busy

2007-03-07T11:18:00.000Z	Jimme1	soundray	I can't. I'm trying to install RTCW in wine, it's asking for the second CD, and I'm trying to mount an .iso file
