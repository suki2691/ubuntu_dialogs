2009-11-20T21:07:00.000Z	Dnrock	JonathanEllis	with windows XP i can convert FAT to NTFS easy with one command line, so i think is same with ubuntu

It might be safer to copy the FAT32 volume to an external hard drive, then delete the partition in GParted and make a new NTFS partition. Then copy the data back. Thats how I would do it to be on the safe side. Otherwise if something goes wrong during the conversion process you could lose data
