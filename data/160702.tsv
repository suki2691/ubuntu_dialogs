2007-05-24T11:53:00.000Z	usea		when booting from the ubuntu cd (fawn), trying to check the cd for errors or trying to start/install ubuntu gives me the same message. /bin/sh: can't access tty: job control turned off.  then I get a (initramfs) prompt
2007-05-24T11:54:00.000Z	usea		I'm not an experienced user, so I don't know if it's the result of faulty hardware or if I'm doing something wrong or what
2007-05-24T11:56:00.000Z	usea		any suggestions? I have no idea what to do
2007-05-24T11:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	usea	I would try the Alternate install CD
