2009-08-24T07:17:00.000Z	gizmobay		Anyone know how I can install kernel 2.6.30?
2009-08-24T07:19:00.000Z	rblst	gizmobay	you need to compile it from source and then install it
2009-08-24T07:19:00.000Z	gizmobay	rblst	no packages?
2009-08-24T07:21:00.000Z	rblst	gizmobay	ubuntu 9.04 currently uses 2.6.28, i don't think you can install a different one from packages
