2007-06-18T11:36:00.000Z	new_to_ubuntu		am I right to assume then, that I can partition my Vista drive, create a dual boot (Vista/Ubuntu), and THEN install XP with VMWare as a VM in Ubuntu ?
2007-06-18T11:36:00.000Z	DShepherd	new_to_ubuntu	you should be able to. I had to do the partitioning in vista though
2007-06-18T11:36:00.000Z	new_to_ubuntu	DShepherd	partitioning in Vista using a Vista utility ? or a s/w like Partition Magic ?
2007-06-18T11:37:00.000Z	DShepherd	new_to_ubuntu	i think theres a disk manager utility default in vista.. not sure where to find it though.. i have used vista much
