2009-11-02T23:16:00.000Z	Igg-man		I can't get lirc to start, if I run "/etc/init.d/lircd start" nothing seems to happen
2009-11-02T23:16:00.000Z	Igg-man		well, it seems to start if I run it directly "/usr/sbin/lircd"
2009-11-02T23:17:00.000Z	LjL	Igg-man	just a guess, maybe it's got config in /etc/default an that's disabled?
2009-11-02T23:17:00.000Z	Igg-man	LjL	I'll check
