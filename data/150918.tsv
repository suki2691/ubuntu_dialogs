2007-01-14T17:02:00.000Z	riotkittie	beem	thats odd. being terribly impatient, i would kill it and restart to see where it pops up. or manually partition with gparted.
2007-01-14T17:03:00.000Z	beem	riotkittie	this before i have been given the option. it has done the percentage bar and now sits loading before giving me the option to manually or automatically partition
