2006-05-27T10:50:00.000Z	IronBlade	singsung	is the vnc server an ubuntu machine?
2006-05-27T10:51:00.000Z	IronBlade	singsung	silly question, but does it have X on it?
2006-05-27T10:55:00.000Z	IronBlade	singsung	I dunno.. I haven't set up vnc server on linux for ages. I vaguely remember having to set up a startx to get it to actually start a window manager..
