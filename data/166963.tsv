2007-02-09T11:29:00.000Z	Justy-		I get an error with update manager about 2.6.17.11 kernel and tells me that it is broken. Update manager offers me the command: sudo apt-get install -f . And that command removes linux-image-generic and linux-generic which are 106kB. What should I do? Should I say yes to this command?
