2007-06-03T09:00:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		skyhook: i assume you have kubuntu?
2007-06-03T09:01:00.000Z	Skyhook	bastid_raZor	so I can play my windows games with ubuntu (i have ubuntu) without installing again, maybe just by 'wine <command path>'
2007-06-03T09:02:00.000Z	Skyhook	bastid_raZor	i dunno what I was thinking, ive only used wine by installing things in ubuntu, but thanks anyways
