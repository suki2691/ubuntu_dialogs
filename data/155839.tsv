2006-12-03T15:22:00.000Z	DBO	Ali2004	I dont know aobut feisty, but support will eventually drop as PPC isnt made by well... anyone any more
2006-12-03T15:23:00.000Z	Ali2004	DBO	well. it mean that Powerpc users must re-migrate to Debian?
2006-12-03T15:24:00.000Z	DBO	Ali2004	I dont think they will be dropping support that fast
