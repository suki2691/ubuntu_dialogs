2004-10-31T12:47:00.000Z	spiritz		I'm trying to install the ATI video driver, but when I get to the module compilation, it returns : "XFree86 drm includes at /lib/modules/2.6.8.1-3-386/build/include/../drivers/char/drm do not fit this driver." "This driver is designed to only work with X4.1.0 or higher."  "You can match this by getting Linux kernel 2.4.8 or higher." blablabla ... I'm using Linux ubuntu 2.6.8.1-3-386... What did I miss ? :o
