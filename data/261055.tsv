2004-12-10T13:48:00.000Z	JetlagJen		Can someone help me with a shared FAT32 partition that seems to have mounted ok, but isn't working right?
2004-12-10T13:48:00.000Z	ogra	JetlagJen	whats the error ?
2004-12-10T13:49:00.000Z	ogra	JetlagJen	show us the fstab line for the partition
2004-12-10T13:53:00.000Z	ogra	JetlagJen	change it with sudo gedit /etc/fstab so that it looks exactly the same
