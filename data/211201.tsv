2005-10-31T12:51:00.000Z	Bergcube		I'm doing a Ubuntu server install, from the specialized server CD.  From what I've read on the Ubuntu users mailing-list it sounds like /WEBMIN/ is a good tool for administration.  ( Is there any better / preferred alternatives? )  Will /LINKS/ be sufficient to access webmin on Localhost or is there another console web-browser better suited?

2005-10-31T12:56:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	Bergcube	what kind of server do u want?
