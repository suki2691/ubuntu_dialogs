2010-09-11T15:09:00.000Z	kneaux		hello comrades, i have a server set up on my lan but i'm trying to use the external ip to connect to it
2010-09-11T15:10:00.000Z	kneaux		that is i can connect on 192.168.foo.bar but not on ipv4:port

2010-09-11T15:11:00.000Z	jrib	kneaux	I mean they don't let you access it internally (at least my verizon-provided one doesn't and I never looked into why).  People outside your lan can still get to it if you setup port forwarding and such
