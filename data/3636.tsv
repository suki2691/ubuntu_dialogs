2012-05-22T18:44:00.000Z	oldereagle		anybody else experiencing that Filezilla freezes on Ubuntu 12.04? It started a couple of days ago. It randomly freeze and I have to kill it to be able to use it again.
2012-05-22T18:45:00.000Z	fidel_	oldereagle	no issues so far. do you get any error output? tried to start it from a cli? log-output?
2012-05-22T18:45:00.000Z	fidel_	oldereagle	there is #filezilla as well - maybe a good additional place to ask
2012-05-22T18:46:00.000Z	oldereagle	fidel_	ok. Thanks
