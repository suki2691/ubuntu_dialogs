2009-01-27T08:40:00.000Z	Talkradio	plcTowlie	google dhcp reservations.. nothing more than adding the mac addy of the pc to get the address
2009-01-27T08:40:00.000Z	plcTowlie	Talkradio	my router does not support that
2009-01-27T08:42:00.000Z	plcTowlie	Talkradio	I will attempt that again, my last attempt at that gave me intermittent internet access
