2007-08-31T16:16:00.000Z	Amaranth	Nalleman	f-spot and picasa are the only 'photo management' tools I know of, the others are just photo viewers
2007-08-31T16:17:00.000Z	Amaranth	Nalleman	Oh, so you don't want 'photo management' in the iPhoto or f-spot sense :)
2007-08-31T16:18:00.000Z	Nalleman	Amaranth	yes, but f-spot doesnt work well for my purposes and I dont like picasa
