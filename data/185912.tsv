2007-07-03T14:51:00.000Z	BetaTester		 Hi all. Can somebody tell me which cpu type do I use with AMD Turion 64 x2?
2007-07-03T14:51:00.000Z	BetaTester		 k7 or k8? I compiled 2.6.21 with K8 but system hung at boot :(
2007-07-03T14:52:00.000Z	BetaTester		k7 stock kernel is fine, but I guess I am not using all the benefits of K8
2007-07-03T14:53:00.000Z	ajax4	BetaTester	Use the install for x86. You won't get all the benefits of the 64-bit processor, but it's better for compatibility reasons.
