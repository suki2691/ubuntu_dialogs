2009-09-26T05:57:00.000Z	dmf		Hey, everyone. I'm trying to create an 'emergency' USB stick running non-live Ubuntu... installation went absolutely perfectly, but I'm noticing that /tmp if using waaaay too many cycles on the poor thing. I heard that using tmpfs for /tmp would help, can anyone explain how to do that?

2009-09-26T05:59:00.000Z	dmf	Dr_Willis	It's a bit late for me to be attempting to use usb-creator... I'm trying to find a definitive guide to forcing /tmp into a tmpfs, but I've yet to find a decent one.
