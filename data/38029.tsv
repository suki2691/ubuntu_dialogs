2010-07-08T03:36:00.000Z	lfitz	ActionParsnip	i should have specified the kernel is for armv5 sheevaplug
2010-07-08T03:45:00.000Z	lfitz	ActionParsnip	the kernel is 2.6.30 for armv5 sheevplug, can i update this to the lucid kernel? i read lucid only supports a different version of arm
2010-07-08T03:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lfitz	ive not used arm with ubuntu so cant really comment. You could upgrade to the newer releases to get later kernels.
