2008-02-13T23:11:00.000Z	sipior	xeom	sure, i believe the gnome mixer can select different sound cards and mute them as you like
2008-02-13T23:13:00.000Z	sipior	xeom	yes, i have had on occasion as well. seems to depend on the two cards. you might have an easier time just preventing the undesired driver from loading at startup
