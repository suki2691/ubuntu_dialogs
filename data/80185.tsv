2008-10-31T05:35:00.000Z	dr_willis		Ive had no real issues with 8.10 so far.. other then its not wanting to automount my usb thumbdrive
2008-10-31T05:35:00.000Z	Singer2	dr_willis	with the 8.10 beta, my wireless worked, with the 8.10 release it doesn't work.. hence beta= better then release
2008-10-31T05:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	Singer2	 wireless onboth my laptops finally worked with just a few clicks for me under 8.10 - so to each their own.. :)
