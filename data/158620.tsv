2008-02-09T21:19:00.000Z	Audacitor		Hey all, having a minor problem.  Is there anyway I can boot into Ubuntu from a flash drive on a MacBook?
2008-02-09T21:19:00.000Z	Slart	Audacitor	you can boot ubuntu from flash.. don't know about the macbook part though.. perhaps someone else knows
2008-02-09T21:20:00.000Z	Slart	Audacitor	hmm.. hard to do that if the operating system isn't loaded yet
