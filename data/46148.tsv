2010-07-14T18:28:00.000Z	darkneo		I'm not sure whether I should use 64bit, or 32bit with PAE. My computer usage is general web browsing, web development using Nusphere PhpEd running under Wine, local web services (LAMP setup), some game playing, and cross compiling embedded Linux installations. Anyone have any suggestions/warnings?

2010-07-14T18:30:00.000Z	darkneo	dr3mro	Are there still compatibility issues? I remember trying 64bit almost 2 years ago and could barely get anything working (I had to install loads of compatibility libs)
2010-07-14T18:32:00.000Z	dr3mro	darkneo	it works OK now most of things are solved already but if you wont find it neccessary to do it just use 32bit .... 64 is the future but now it is very good and works fine ... but if u have to use a certain app that only is 32b then use compitability libs or use 32b
