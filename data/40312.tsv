2009-12-23T05:20:00.000Z	Slart	Solorvox	looks like a good bug report.. I have no idea if it's in the right category or not though
2009-12-23T05:21:00.000Z	Solorvox	Slart	it's not in a category, nor assigned. (been about a week)  Wondering if that's why no one as looked at it. :-/
2009-12-23T05:21:00.000Z	Slart	Solorvox	might be a holiday thing
