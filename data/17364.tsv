2011-03-05T12:16:00.000Z	SirCane		Corleone but most home routers will try to issue the same ip for known mac addresses anyway, but few allow you to set an ip to a mac address. best thing to do it just set a static ip manually on the client
2011-03-05T12:17:00.000Z	Corleone	SirCane	yes, how would i do that?
2011-03-05T12:19:00.000Z	Corleone	SirCane	yeah i removed it from my DHCP from my router, no connection now :/
