2007-10-12T07:31:00.000Z	LT1Caprice57L		any ideas on why a GTK theme that worked fine in Feisty wouldn't work right in Gutsy?
2007-10-12T07:31:00.000Z	LT1Caprice57L		in my case, it's only one that doesn't work properly anymore
2007-10-12T07:31:00.000Z	LT1Caprice57L		all the rest do
2007-10-12T07:31:00.000Z	Flannel	LT1Caprice57L	#ubuntu+1 for Gutsy support, thanks
