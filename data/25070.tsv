2010-09-30T18:12:00.000Z	_learner		Hi, I want to create and maintaine new iso which will be a mixture of ubuntu-maverick and some packages in main ubuntu repo + local ppa. I have a idea about seeds, but not other things completely
2010-09-30T18:13:00.000Z	_learner		Wish, if someone can provide me pointers and resources :-)

2010-09-30T18:14:00.000Z	_learner	st__	I am not sure, but we can't use remasterysys for creating iso on remote vm or local vm.. right?
