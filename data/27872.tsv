2010-08-21T17:38:00.000Z	itsux2bu	ibrahim-kasem	i think you will find that zipping a mp3 files won't save any hard drive space
2010-08-21T17:39:00.000Z	ibrahim-kasem	itsux2bu	i want to zip it and email it but like you said the space is still the same
2010-08-21T17:41:00.000Z	itsux2bu	ibrahim-kasem	re-encode an mp3 file?
