2005-01-23T09:45:00.000Z	__learner__		I still don't know how to properly configure my refresh rate
2005-01-23T09:46:00.000Z	froust	__learner__	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86
2005-01-23T09:46:00.000Z	froust		(or replace xfree86 with xorg if you use xorg)
2005-01-23T09:47:00.000Z	__learner__	froust	what that will do? I changed Xfree86 file and I could get 85hz, but my monitor supports more than 100.
