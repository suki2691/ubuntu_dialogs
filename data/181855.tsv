2006-07-04T09:37:00.000Z	wweasel		I'd like to make my Desktop folder in another location, as in not ~/Desktop. How would I do that?
2006-07-04T09:38:00.000Z	Bot_Builder	wweasel	- have you tried a symbolic link?
2006-07-04T09:39:00.000Z	wweasel	Bot_Builder	I just made one. It worked, but no icons appear on my desktop. If I go into my home folder and click the symbolic link it brings me to the right place. Perhaps I should restart X?
2006-07-04T09:39:00.000Z	Bot_Builder	wweasel	- yeah, restart nautilus or X
