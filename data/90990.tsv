2008-05-11T22:46:00.000Z	rutgermasi	DRebellion	what do you mean?
2008-05-11T22:47:00.000Z	DRebellion	rutgermasi	even if the virus only has your user permissions, it can still delete all of your files...
2008-05-11T22:47:00.000Z	rutgermasi	DRebellion	yes, but most of the programmes on linux are in repos, so less chance for virusses
