2008-03-03T02:20:00.000Z	nickrud	zulerdongle	yes, there's a bunch of stuff that's not on the cd, if you don't get them your install will break
2008-03-03T02:22:00.000Z	nickrud	zulerdongle	for example, libc6 in gutsy is newer in gutsy; if an app you have installed requires that newer libc , it'll break unless you upgrade that as well.
