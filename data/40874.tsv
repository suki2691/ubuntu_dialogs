2010-05-11T00:35:00.000Z	ManDay	LzrdKing	what would you call speed up? i got 6 ext4 and one ext2 - the startup certainly didnt take more than 4 seconds longer than normal - you think all those PLUS the ext2 could have checked in THAT SHORT time?!
2010-05-11T00:38:00.000Z	LzrdKing	ManDay	delete them :)
2010-05-11T00:38:00.000Z	ManDay	LzrdKing	too practical - i need a more exotic solutioon
