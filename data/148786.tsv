2008-01-08T19:10:00.000Z	Jonny88		hi, i'v got a ubuntu DVD from linux format magazine, and I want to install it onto a 1gb usb flash drive. How do I do minimal install? I'v read guides saying use the alternative CD (I dont have) and use 'custom' as a boot option, which isnt working for me. Any help?
