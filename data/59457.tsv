2009-04-25T08:08:00.000Z	bmx2962		Why do some programs install easily, but others I need to use the console, like I did with installing Adobe AIR??
2009-04-25T08:09:00.000Z	doleyb	bmx2962	because that's how adobe made it... and they made it that way because they wanted it to work on any linux, not only ubuntu
2009-04-25T08:10:00.000Z	bmx2962	doleyb	thank you.
