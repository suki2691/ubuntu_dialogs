2006-09-05T07:39:00.000Z	bluepop13		I'm currently new to Linux and Ubuntu all together and in the past, using Windows I've really enjoyed Winamp. I'm currently using the default media player on Ubuntu 6.06 and was wondering if there's a better player that's fast, efficient, reliable and is just about like Winamp
2006-09-05T07:41:00.000Z	bluepop13		can someone setup a private chat with me and help me out with this small issue, if you will
