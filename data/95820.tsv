2009-11-05T19:03:00.000Z	blinkiz		Hi there. Have set up a 9.10 minimal virtual machine. Installed asterisk but I get problem getting it installed okay. get complains that dahdi can not be compiled against the kernel. What to do?
2009-11-05T19:05:00.000Z	sipior	blinkiz	do you have build-essentials and the kernel source package installed in the VM?
2009-11-05T19:06:00.000Z	blinkiz	sipior	I have not installed that manually. I was hoping that depends for the dahdi package should take care of that
2009-11-05T19:06:00.000Z	sipior	blinkiz	i'm guessing it didn't :-)
