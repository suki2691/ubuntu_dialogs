2008-07-31T07:31:00.000Z	histo		Alright I messed up some kernel modules in /lib/modules/2.6.blah blah Is there a way to replace them?
2008-07-31T07:32:00.000Z	arrrghhh	histo	delete them and apt-get update?
2008-07-31T07:32:00.000Z	histo	arrrghhh	they aren't controlled by apt
2008-07-31T07:33:00.000Z	histo	arrrghhh	I guess I would have to reinstall the kernel would fix it no?
