2006-10-20T16:33:00.000Z	White_Castle		I keep getting command not found when I try 'make' and then 'make install'
2006-10-20T16:33:00.000Z	White_Castle		What's going on?
2006-10-20T16:34:00.000Z	White_Castle		Erm, no idea. :|
2006-10-20T16:34:00.000Z	slacktyro	White_Castle	are you typing "./make" instead "make"?
