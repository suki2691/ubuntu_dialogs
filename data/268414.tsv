2005-11-15T12:02:00.000Z	cef	bluestrain	yeah.. I have a message that is crashing evo... in an imap mailbox
2005-11-15T12:04:00.000Z	cef	bluestrain	so I fire up evo using -c cal (well it avoids the thing crashing) .. get into the prefs, turn off the mailbox, and it stops crashing
2005-11-15T12:04:00.000Z	cef	bluestrain	however, if I go back into preferences and enable the mailbox - BANG! it crashes
