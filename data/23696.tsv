2011-03-17T21:36:00.000Z	dTx	skulltip	why would you want to uninstall libreoffice for openoffice. That's quite the downgrade.
2011-03-17T21:40:00.000Z	skulltip	dTx	- the downgrade is not being able to design forms as a front-end for db processing
2011-03-17T21:42:00.000Z	dTx	skulltip	I was not aware of that. Carry on. :P
