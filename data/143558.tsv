2007-10-31T19:55:00.000Z	taonari		Hi I have the latest nvidia driver installed and had to remove compiz because of the title bar corruption that keeps happening. Now on reboot all my title bars are missing.  How can I get them restored?
2007-10-31T19:56:00.000Z	taonari		My title bars are missing after removing Compiz in 7.10.  Any ideas on how to get them restored when Gnome loads?  Right now I have to type metacity in a terminal.
