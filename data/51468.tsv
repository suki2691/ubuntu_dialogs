2009-08-02T08:52:00.000Z	BeWop		Hey, I have an interesting request for anyone who wants to help
2009-08-02T08:54:00.000Z	BeWop		Alright, so here's the basis. My computer has stopped detecting my cd drive. I've run firmware and everything to try to get it to detect it again. Nothing's worked. I also don't have a usb drive. I currently am dual booting XP and ubuntu, but I need to reinstall windows XP. Is there anyway I can do this from ubuntu?
2009-08-02T08:54:00.000Z	Guest69215	BeWop	ubuntu and windows cant see cd drive or just windows?
2009-08-02T08:58:00.000Z	Guest69215	BeWop	I doubt it.
