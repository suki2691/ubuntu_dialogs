2009-04-22T02:06:00.000Z	TheDracle		Is there a way to take my current Ubuntu system, and generate a CD that will produce a clone of it- install all of the same packages, and install my startup scripts?

2009-04-22T02:07:00.000Z	Ahlee	TheDracle	the best way to do that would be to feed it with preseeding
