2008-02-22T02:11:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rainrunner87	i guess tracker probably doesnt let you tag files arbitrarily
2008-02-22T02:16:00.000Z	rainrunner87	prince_jammys	Tracker's not particularly friendly to the problem, or at least not that I've seen in my tinkerings with it.  I guess I'll just have to code something up.  Oh well.
