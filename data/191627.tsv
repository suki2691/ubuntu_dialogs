2010-11-07T10:45:00.000Z	MTecknology	turtle_	'man mount' look for permission and user options
2010-11-07T10:46:00.000Z	turtle_	MTecknology	what do they need to be set at?
2010-11-07T10:47:00.000Z	MTecknology	turtle_	I can't remember offhand - you probably want to mount it as samba-users user/group and grant people access by adding them to that group
