2007-12-03T07:52:00.000Z	htmldotcom		I have a problem with Beryl and Ubuntu Desktop Effects, whenever I try to enable them, my screen just goes white and I can't see anything. Then I have to guess at where the box is to turn it off and do it without seeing anything. Anyone know what my problem it is?
