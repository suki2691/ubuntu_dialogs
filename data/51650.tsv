2009-07-31T05:44:00.000Z	Neros		Ok guys... I have a problem. I've had it before and I don't remember how to fix it. I resized my external drive using gparted. now the ntfs drive shows up as raw (but the partition is intact.. the type is just off) how do I manually set the partition to NTFS type?
2009-07-31T05:45:00.000Z	Neros		no...
2009-07-31T05:45:00.000Z	Neros		the drive is there... all the data is intact
