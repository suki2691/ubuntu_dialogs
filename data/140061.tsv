2007-04-11T06:12:00.000Z	reep	haku	did you do anything to get it working the first time? or did it just work out of the box?
2007-04-11T06:14:00.000Z	haku	reep	well first time it worked ok (apart from 5.1 sound), and with the new kernel it does not work at all
2007-04-11T06:15:00.000Z	reep	haku	ok, if you did something the first time, you probably have to do it every time there's a new kernel, so it sounds like a bug in the new kernel then
