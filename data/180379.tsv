2006-06-14T06:06:00.000Z	cafuego	JakeDude	How do you mean?
2006-06-14T06:07:00.000Z	JakeDude	cafuego	well.. my install seems to be damaged. It worked and now its having trouble booting.. I figured there may be a repair feature that checks system files and/or boot sequences and such :S
2006-06-14T06:08:00.000Z	cafuego	JakeDude	No, your best bet is to boot on rescue mode and note *where* the boot fails. Then you can use the cd to log in to the install and fix the problem.
