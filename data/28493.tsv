2010-09-09T22:55:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	dp	it's okay if it gets removed, it's just a "virtual package"
2010-09-09T22:55:00.000Z	dp	ilovefairuz	will I then have to install it again afterwards?
2010-09-09T22:57:00.000Z	dp	ilovefairuz	I was having problems with that earlier.  let me get back to a "stable" software list, and I'll see what was going on
