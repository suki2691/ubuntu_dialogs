2007-02-21T16:35:00.000Z	betatux	loca|host	firestarter ?
2007-02-21T16:38:00.000Z	loca|host	betatux	that seems a 'local' iptables configurator, i need one that can configure interfaces not existing on my workstation, just to get a iptables config file to put on server
2007-02-21T16:38:00.000Z	betatux	loca|host	then you want fwbuilder
