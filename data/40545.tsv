2009-12-21T19:18:00.000Z	matteo1990		Why if i try to set up a wireless connection with ifconfig in Ubuntu i get problems and with the same settings with Gentoo Live i get no problems? Any tips?

2009-12-21T19:22:00.000Z	matteo1990	john11	the real difference is that i can't ping anithing with ubuntu after the same steps throught terminal... And if launch route -n with the same pc under Ubuntu i can't see any "lo" wireless device... do you know what it means?
