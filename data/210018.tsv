2011-05-02T02:46:00.000Z	LjL	Deihmos	it is slow *because* it needs hardware acceleration ;)
2011-05-02T02:47:00.000Z	LjL	Deihmos	yes there is, but how well it works depends on your card
2011-05-02T02:48:00.000Z	LjL	Deihmos	if you find it unacceptably slow, you can try installing the package "unity-2d" which will get rid of the graphical effects but be faster
