2010-05-10T02:26:00.000Z	Matisse		I thought I solved my flash-kills-firefox-problem, but now FF is crashing again when opening a video page (f.e. a youtube vid). It happens since upgrade to 10.04 and was solved by deactivating one of the 2 flash plugins in the addons menu
2010-05-10T02:28:00.000Z	duffydack	Matisse	remove the flashplugins (purge) and install flashplugin-nonfree or the 64bit version if you are running 64bit https://launchpad.net/~sevenmachines/+archive/flash
2010-05-10T04:04:00.000Z	Matisse	duffydack	hi again, tried to purge the old flash player and also deleted some persisting files and installed the 64bit version of the flashplayer but still firefox is crashing when getting in contact with a flash file (right after displaying the black background)
