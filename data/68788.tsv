2009-03-02T07:09:00.000Z	doodle77	felixsulla	~/.local/share/applications/defaults.list
2009-03-02T07:11:00.000Z	felixsulla	doodle77	Do I need to copy everything from the /usr version or can i just add to my local one and have it "overwrite" the /usr defaults?
2009-03-02T07:11:00.000Z	doodle77	felixsulla	only add your local one
