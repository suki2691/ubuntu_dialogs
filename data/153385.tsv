2008-09-18T12:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	clarenc1	dell is the only one i know of thats a major distributor... why cant you just try downloading and installing it?
2008-09-18T12:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	clarenc1	so why not download and install it yourself and dual boot your PC to try it?
2008-09-18T12:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	clarenc1	meaning, download Ubuntu, and install it on the PC you have now, or use the live CD, if you want to try Ubuntu, no real need to buy a new computer with it pre-installed.. unless you just want a new PC
