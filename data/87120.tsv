2008-06-27T23:35:00.000Z	Jason2gs		Is there some sort of guide for installing Ubuntu with the text-based installer? It keeps messing up on me.
2008-06-27T23:35:00.000Z	unop	Jason2gs	at what stage does it fail and how?
2009-06-09T08:15:00.000Z	unop	Jason2gs	does /dev/fd0 exist?
2009-06-09T08:42:00.000Z	Jason2gs	unop	yes. /dev/fd0 exists. Though, it didn't create itself automatically. I had to run MAKEFLOPPIES, if that matters.
