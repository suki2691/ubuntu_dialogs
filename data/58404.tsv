2010-10-14T01:06:00.000Z	Black_Phantom		Hello all, whats the best dvd player for Ubuntu ? I want one that can show menus
2010-10-14T01:06:00.000Z	duncan-nz	Black_Phantom	have you tried the one you've got? The next would be VLC.
2010-10-14T01:07:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	duncan-nz	yes I tried both, VLC cannot select from menus :/ and sometimes the dvd is split into many VOBs which is a problem playing with VLC where I have to play each one of them separately
