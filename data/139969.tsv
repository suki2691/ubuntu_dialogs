2007-04-23T06:39:00.000Z	NickGarvey	Jump86	some programs are, some aren't, server/player is, which is what most people use
2007-04-23T06:39:00.000Z	Jump86	NickGarvey	I have player, now what do I need to run a guest os?
2007-04-23T06:39:00.000Z	NickGarvey	Jump86	I actually have never used player.. I do think you need to convert or something though, google would say I'm sure
