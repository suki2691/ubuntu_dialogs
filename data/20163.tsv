2011-05-22T16:39:00.000Z	martijn_dekker		Hey folks.. I just noticed that the default Ubuntu, recently upgraded here to 11.04, does not actually install the "Gnome" package even though I have Gnome set as the default window manager
2011-05-22T16:39:00.000Z	martijn_dekker		On a scale of 1 to OMGWHATHAVEYOUDONE, where would the decision to install it anyway be?

2011-05-22T16:41:00.000Z	martijn_dekker	quiescens	the odd thing is that I'm already using Gnome, so .. will installing Gnome put a Gnome in my Gnome so I can Linux while I Linux?
