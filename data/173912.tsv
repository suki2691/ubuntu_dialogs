2006-11-03T15:51:00.000Z	nikosapi		Hi, I'm trying to configure libgpod from cvs and I'm stuck on this error:  testing glib-gettextize... not found.   Where can I get this?
2006-11-03T15:53:00.000Z	OoberMick	nikosapi	I'm guessing but do you have libglib2.0-dev?
2006-11-03T15:54:00.000Z	nikosapi	OoberMick	No, that's what I'm trying to compile...
2006-11-03T15:55:00.000Z	OoberMick	nikosapi	I thought you said libgpod?
