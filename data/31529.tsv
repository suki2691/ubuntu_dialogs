2010-09-21T21:53:00.000Z	till_	uLinux_	in a nutshell, isc-dhcp-client was removed from my system during an update and since then i tried to re-install various dhcp packages but none of them seem to work with network-manager. the error message i usually get is on the bug report. something about the wrong usage.
