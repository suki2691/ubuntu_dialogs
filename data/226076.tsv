2005-12-20T11:06:00.000Z	Knowerrors		Hey all, trying to get ntpdate to work, tried sudo ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com 14 Dec 21:02:28 ntpdate[4260] : no server suitable for synchronization found, any ideas to fix?
2005-12-20T11:06:00.000Z	nickrud	Knowerrors	i think it's ntp.ubuntulinux.org you want to try
2005-12-20T11:08:00.000Z	Knowerrors	nickrud	bob_4_a_day , both of those say no sutiable server for sync found
2005-12-20T11:09:00.000Z	nickrud	Knowerrors	I don't know the problem, but that's what my ntpdate is using
