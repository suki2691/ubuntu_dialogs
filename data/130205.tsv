2007-06-26T11:57:00.000Z	Kprofthreat		Can anyone help me mount an IDE drive? It doesn't detect it in fstab. I really need to get on it though because it has all my important files.

2007-06-26T11:59:00.000Z	bruenig	Kprofthreat	is this an external drive?
2007-06-26T11:59:00.000Z	Kprofthreat	bruenig	No, it's an entirely separate drive. IDE, on its own cable. As master
