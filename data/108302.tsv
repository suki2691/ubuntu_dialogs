2008-08-11T20:09:00.000Z	taak		where can i ask a question about gnu screen?
2008-08-11T20:09:00.000Z	wols	taak	here if you run ubuntu
2008-08-12T01:31:00.000Z	wols	taak	X has copy pastge, screen does, gpm does
2008-08-12T01:32:00.000Z	taak	wols	i'm using screen, but it would be so much more convenient if i could do it natively in vim
