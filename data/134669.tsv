2007-05-11T06:25:00.000Z	Bradf0rd		I'd like to know if there's a version of LAPACK that I can run in Linux
2007-05-11T06:25:00.000Z	crimsun__	Bradf0rd	apt-cache search lapack
2007-05-11T06:28:00.000Z	Bradf0rd	crimsun__	Yeah, I know how to find it, but Lapack3 says it's a "binary incompatible upgrade for lapack"
