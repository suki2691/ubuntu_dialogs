2010-01-25T22:40:00.000Z	Izinucs	Squeese	Brother has their own drivers.. they are a pain to install but typically work..
2010-01-25T22:40:00.000Z	Squeese	Izinucs	I tried to follow their guide, but I get errors on each step - I feel as if I've messed up my system and reinstall and try again is the only way togo
2010-01-25T22:43:00.000Z	Izinucs	Squeese	perhaps.. Brother's most recent instructions including their .deb's have been better then in the last 2 years.. I've found you have to read all their instructions and write them down because they have "If you have "ubuntu" then do this first then do that.. "etc..
