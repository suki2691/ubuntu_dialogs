2008-02-04T03:30:00.000Z	wht1		hi. got a slight problem. deleted a friend's ubuntu partitions thinking all would be ok, but now grub gives an error and refuses to boot. he doesn't know the administrator password on his computer anymore for the windows. how can we get rid of grub from the live cd?
2008-02-04T03:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis	wht1	 with a xp cd - you can boot to its recovery mode and use the fixmbr and fixboot commands
2008-02-04T03:31:00.000Z	Dr_willis	wht1	 vista has some other commands, (yea for ms to change things)
2008-02-04T03:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	wht1	 a xp  install cd. shouldent need a password to write the mbr. or at least I dont think so - check the #windows channel.
