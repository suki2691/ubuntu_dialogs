2009-08-04T18:23:00.000Z	maodun	sol93	currently I'm trying to pipe my DNS requests over the openvpn connection - and my DNS servers are located at 10.0.80.11 and 10.0.80.12, should more specific information is useful.
2009-08-04T18:23:00.000Z	maodun	sol93	OK, I can keep digging, I've just been scratching my head for a while. Thanks for the help!
2009-08-04T18:24:00.000Z	sol93	maodun	if the machine can ping the DNS, it should be able to use the service. Looks like you still need the proper routes. I am not an firewall expert, so i cant help much more.
2009-08-04T18:24:00.000Z	maodun	sol93	Ah, ok, thanks!
