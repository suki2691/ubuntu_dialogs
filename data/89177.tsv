2008-06-01T07:00:00.000Z	Jangari		can someone give me a quick explanation of what the 's' in directory modes refers to?
2008-06-01T07:00:00.000Z	Jangari		yes, what does that mean, Starnestommy?
2008-06-01T07:01:00.000Z	glitsj16	Jangari	that's a window type, sticky = available on all your virtual dekstops or workspaces
2008-06-01T07:03:00.000Z	glitsj16	Jangari	sorry for the confusion, read your sticky question in the wrong context
