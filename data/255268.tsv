2006-08-21T10:14:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	mememe	latest version that is released is dapper drake, 6.06
2006-08-21T10:15:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	mememe	6.06.1 simply refers to a security update or something of that sort...  i'm not that familiar with the naming but they are just simple updates that you have received over the past month or two
2006-08-21T10:16:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	mememe	it also means that they image they are now sending out to people includes security updates to a certain point iirc
