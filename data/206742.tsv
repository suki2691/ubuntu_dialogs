2006-08-22T13:19:00.000Z	Luxurious		I cannot, for saving my life, figure out a way to turn reverse DNS mapping off for my SSH.  Does anyone know how to?
2006-08-22T13:19:00.000Z	sethk	Luxurious	no, and I've looked extensively
2006-08-22T13:24:00.000Z	sethk	Luxurious	other than the reverse lookup, which is an annoying delay at times but doesn't stop it from working, it works very well for me
2006-08-22T13:24:00.000Z	sethk	Luxurious	fix reverse dns so the lookup doesn't fail
