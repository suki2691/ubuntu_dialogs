2008-01-10T00:48:00.000Z	pmratpoison		u need to change the umask labels (I think) to 0000
2008-01-10T00:48:00.000Z	KlrSpz	pmratpoison	only for it to mount at boot; you can mount it in real time as a user
2008-01-10T00:50:00.000Z	KlrSpz	pmratpoison	again, only for boot.. you can mount anything without fstab, and particularly you can mount an smbfs mountpoint as a standard user easily
