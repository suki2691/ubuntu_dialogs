2009-01-07T00:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	HReiser	the short answer is yes
2009-01-07T00:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	HReiser	run the live cd and see if it works
2009-01-07T00:46:00.000Z	HReiser	Jack_Sparrow	it does not run... but I didn't do any change, I just booted the live CD. Didn't enable the restricted drivers.
