2005-02-08T15:02:00.000Z	holzbrenner		hello everyone ... I have a question I didn'f find any answers for in the forums
2005-02-08T15:02:00.000Z	holzbrenner		how do I change the resolution and keyboard layout for the login screen?
2005-02-08T15:03:00.000Z	DAC1138	holzbrenner	base-config maybe?
2005-02-08T15:03:00.000Z	DAC1138	holzbrenner	ive never run it, ive never had to configure my system, but base-config is the setup utility that you use to setup your system like in the installation of ubuntu
