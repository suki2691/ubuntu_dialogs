2008-10-07T07:12:00.000Z	Doc8404		What's a good FTP/firmware upgrade client for a Topfield TF5000PVRt that runs on GNU/Linux?
2008-10-07T07:12:00.000Z	amason_	Doc8404	fairly specific question. i like lftp as an ftp client, not sure if it does what you need
2008-10-07T07:13:00.000Z	amason_	Doc8404	yeh. its  command line driven app. otherwise gftp is available for use or nautilus supports ftp
