I have options for what to set my second harddrive in this computer to what mount point, like /home or /usr, what exactly would that mean if I pick /usr, would all /usr/ stuff be put in that second harddrive? even if / is my primary harddrive?

2010-08-31T05:23:00.000Z	ridin	MrWise	when you want all of them mount them as /
2010-08-31T05:25:00.000Z	ridin	MrWise	sure
