2011-06-02T15:01:00.000Z	AdvoWork	qin	smw im just trying to print a normal page to an A4 printer, in cups it says the printer is A4, but whgen i print from firefox it defaults to US letter and wont print properly, ive read up and tried to change what I can, but same problem. Tried google chrome, and that goes to A4, so its def firefox, so i was thinking of being clever and overwriting the width/height of US letter.. any further suggestions?
