2005-03-26T11:48:00.000Z	rigbyd		A friend of mine is going to try Ubuntu on his powerpc, I'm a Gentoo user, does ubuntu have something comparable to portage? If so, can you point me in the direction of some documentation on how to use ubuntus package manager? Thanks.
2005-03-26T11:49:00.000Z	rigbyd		ah, is there a documentation page on apt?

2005-03-26T11:51:00.000Z	LinuxJones	rigbyd	apt-get update (fetches updated package lists from the repositories) apt-get update (downloads and installs all updated software on your system)
