2006-06-27T15:02:00.000Z	Tom7e		i'm a former fedora user, so i'm not used to how this works... when i installed ubuntu i didn't set a su password... so what is my su password?
2006-06-27T15:04:00.000Z	Tom7e		i've used sudo before... so i can never become root?  then why does the su command still ask for a password?
2006-06-27T15:04:00.000Z	swaj	Tom7e	sudo su - root
2006-06-27T15:31:00.000Z	swaj	Tom7e	yes goto System > Administration > Synaptic Package Manager
