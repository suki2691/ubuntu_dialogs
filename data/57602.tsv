2009-06-28T23:42:00.000Z	the1corrupted		I'm having trouble with my apache2 server.  It seems that it doesn't want to load (or recognize) the php5 module that I installed.  How do I get it to load properly?  (#httpd is idle)
2009-06-28T23:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	the1corrupted	have you installed php5-cli
2009-06-28T23:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	the1corrupted	you'd probably be better asking in #apache
2009-06-28T23:44:00.000Z	the1corrupted	ActionParsnip	Yes, and #apache is down, and #httpd (the new apache channel) is idle.
