2011-04-21T11:26:00.000Z	meganerd	siloxid	ifup would work if you removed network-manager and set up eth0 in /etc/network/interfaces
2011-04-21T11:27:00.000Z	meganerd	siloxid	for now, you should be able to test with "sudo ip link set eth0 up" and then "sudo dhclient eth0", assuming that your network is using dhcp
2011-04-21T11:28:00.000Z	siloxid	meganerd	thanks, will give it a try
