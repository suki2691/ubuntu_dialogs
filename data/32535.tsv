2010-05-04T19:02:00.000Z	airtonix	lucida_	because when you want to reinstall the operating system (new or same version) you only need to overwrite the system partition and tell the partitioing stage of the installer to mount your /home partition as the mountpoint /home

2010-05-04T19:04:00.000Z	lucida_	airtonix	I got your point but I can also copy the /home and cp it again back but yours is a bit easier ;)
