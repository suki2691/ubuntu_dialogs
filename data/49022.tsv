Obviously starting bash that way is pointless; what I'm actually doing is starting tmux, but I guess this rules tmux out.

2012-04-16T23:41:00.000Z	osse	Boohbah	when I log in regularly I get 'LANG=en_US.UTF-8' and all the others except LC_ALL. When I log in with -t LANG also is empty the the remaining ones are POSIX. Do you know how I fix this?
