2007-12-23T22:30:00.000Z	ikonia	zoe	I know this, and it's not what he needs as he's running the server install which is more than "no desktop"
2007-12-23T22:31:00.000Z	ikonia	zoe	no - the server install is not appropriate for him,
2007-12-23T22:32:00.000Z	zoe	ikonia	ok, well, I don't know what is appropriate for anyone
