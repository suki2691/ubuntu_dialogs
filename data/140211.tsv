2007-04-06T08:34:00.000Z	dStumbler		Is there a way to create an install disc containing my complete current set-up?  If so, can someone direct me to the wiki??
2007-04-06T08:35:00.000Z	dStumbler		is it that bad?

2007-04-06T08:38:00.000Z	black9ice	dStumbler	my understanding of dd is it will make an image of a disk, maybe even a partition, just look at the wiki or google it  ;)
