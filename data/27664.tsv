2010-11-07T12:08:00.000Z	OY1R		this is a bare bone install of ubuntu about 7Gb big and i have a 100Gb partition available should i just delete the 100Gb partition and DD the new partition on the new disk or perhaps use clonezilla ?
2010-11-07T12:09:00.000Z	OY1R		and how will the cloned Ubuntu react to the other partitions on the disk (and a different size swap ?
2010-11-07T12:11:00.000Z	OY1R		if i clone it how do i make sure the grub also gets cloned
2010-11-07T12:12:00.000Z	tcopeland	OY1R	is grub installed to the ubuntu partition?
