2012-01-09T23:28:00.000Z	plustax		this is basically my issue. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/empathy/+bug/891562   is there a solution for it yet?
2012-01-09T23:30:00.000Z	h00k	plustax	since the bug report would probably show if there's a solution, and it's marked as undecided, confirmed, I would assume there isn't yet.

2012-01-09T23:32:00.000Z	plustax	h00k	okay I will
