2008-06-17T23:22:00.000Z	ch0wda		i'm getting a 404 for a few of the packages that i'm trying to upgrade.  it's a completely fresh install.  for example the openssl-blacklist
2008-06-17T23:24:00.000Z	ch0wda		yeah, after searching around it seems like the version numbers aren't jiving
2008-06-17T23:24:00.000Z	dabaR	ch0wda	did you sudo aptitude update?
2008-06-17T23:26:00.000Z	ch0wda	dabaR	i had already updated, but had to do it a second time.  it worked this time.  thanks
