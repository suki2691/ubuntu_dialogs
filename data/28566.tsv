2010-08-14T14:48:00.000Z	rypervenche		I have a question for anyone who is able to help. I just got Ubuntu and I was wondering... If I have to change monitors, is there anything that I have to do or will it automatically recognize the monitor?
2010-08-14T14:49:00.000Z	rypervenche		Do I have to change it beforehand or can I do it afterward?
2010-08-14T14:49:00.000Z	rypervenche		Because when I did it the first time, I wasn't able to boot Ubuntu and I was getting these messages. http://3.ly/GtkB
