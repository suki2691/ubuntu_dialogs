2011-07-06T15:30:00.000Z	vishaltelangre		My site http://vishaltelangre.com is opening under Windows but it's not in any browser (Firefox5, chrome, opera, epiphany) under my Ubuntu 11.04... Please tell me the solution... :(
2011-07-06T15:32:00.000Z	nightrid3r	vishaltelangre	the site opens fine in firefox on windows
2011-07-06T15:35:00.000Z	nightrid3r	vishaltelangre	try a ping to your website
2011-07-06T15:54:00.000Z	nightrid3r	vishaltelangre	do you have any network connection on that machine cos it looks like your network interfaces are not setup right
