2011-07-25T20:36:00.000Z	DBordello		i just have xterm
2011-07-25T20:38:00.000Z	DBordello		so I need X, but I don't need anything displayed
2011-07-25T20:40:00.000Z	bitterblackale	DBordello	do you have a way to see if the GPU is doing the calcs, and if so, see if they work w/o GDM??
2011-07-25T20:43:00.000Z	bitterblackale	DBordello	could also try compiling kernel with GPU modules built-in... maynot need gdm or even X then
