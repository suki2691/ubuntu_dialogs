2009-07-13T02:53:00.000Z	Andorin		Does anyone know why Songbird and Exaile would play some music files quieter than others, but Amarok plays them all at equal volume?
2009-07-13T02:54:00.000Z	carpediem1	Andorin	perhaps Amorok does normalization ?
2009-07-13T02:56:00.000Z	Andorin	carpediem1	Normalization... a function that sets track volumes?
2009-07-13T02:56:00.000Z	carpediem1	Andorin	yes.  A player with normalization (not sure if amorok does) would make the volume roughly the same for all tracks
