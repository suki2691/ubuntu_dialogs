2010-09-21T03:38:00.000Z	Pertheria		is there some simple way to get workspace switcher to show the previews in 10.10? i know the feature was there automatically in previous ubuntus, but it isnt enabled and i'm not seein option?
2010-09-21T03:39:00.000Z	AndrewMC	Pertheria	are you talking about the thing in the menu bar?
2010-09-21T03:40:00.000Z	AndrewMC	Pertheria	right click> add to panel> (bottom of list) workspace switcher
2010-09-21T03:41:00.000Z	AndrewMC	Pertheria	add that to the panel and right click> Move if it isnt in the right spot and right click> lock to pannel if you want it to not move
