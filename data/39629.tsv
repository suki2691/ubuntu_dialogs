2010-01-04T01:29:00.000Z	VirusCollector		Would anybody be willing to help me get TiLP working?
2010-01-04T01:31:00.000Z	VirusCollector		Wondering why I chose 64-bit... makes everything harder...
2010-01-04T01:33:00.000Z	PatrickDK	VirusCollector	was it maybe compiled for 32bit and you don't have 32bit libs installed?
2010-01-04T01:33:00.000Z	VirusCollector	PatrickDK	Nope, I installed it from repositories.
