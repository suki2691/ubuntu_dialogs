2009-01-25T21:22:00.000Z	CaMason_		I'm having troubles connecting to unsecured wireless networks using 8.10 on an Asus Eee 901 (using WICD). I can connect to a WPA2 secured network, but with the unsecured, the logs just keep 'setting dhcp mode' and not optaining an IP
2009-01-25T21:23:00.000Z	step21	CaMason_	sounds like the network is unsecured but uses mac adress filtering
2009-01-25T21:24:00.000Z	CaMason_	step21	no, its any unsecured network, including all hotspots
2009-01-25T21:24:00.000Z	step21	CaMason_	try forcing it into dhcp mode?
