2007-08-02T15:56:00.000Z	RickH		So, how do I get my two Ubuntu machines (desktop + notebook) to share files and a printer resource?  I have them both hooked up to my router.  Both can access the shared internet through the router.  But, they don't know each other.
2007-08-02T15:56:00.000Z	RickH		I can ping them.
2007-08-02T15:58:00.000Z	JesusOnStilts	RickH	haha there is a Detect LAN Printer option
2007-08-02T15:58:00.000Z	RickH	JesusOnStilts	 Okay, and the file sharing?
