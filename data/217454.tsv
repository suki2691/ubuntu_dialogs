2005-09-26T07:53:00.000Z	brownie17	arkanes	umm... when you say compiler, do you mean it just converts the FLA files to a SWF file? or do you mean the full program?
2005-09-26T07:54:00.000Z	arkanes	brownie17	I'm not really sure, I'm not a flash guy, but my understanding is that it converts ActionScript/FLA files into a SWF movie, yes
2005-09-26T07:55:00.000Z	brownie17	arkanes	ok, what is it called?
