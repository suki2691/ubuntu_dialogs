2010-09-19T19:10:00.000Z	neekers		ok, dumb question, i just changed my ssh over to using keys and i'm still having to login with my user name and rsa passphrase, i thought having keys would allow you to not have to do that in putty?

2010-09-19T19:12:00.000Z	TrXuk	neekers	there is a way to cache the RSA key password on your system, so that it is available to putty while you are logged in, as geoffmcc  has just pointed out, it's called pagent
2010-09-19T19:14:00.000Z	neekers	TrXuk	and geoffmcc: thanks, looking at pageant right now, will i need to do something similar for my macbook pro or will i just be able to use the mac's terminal window?
