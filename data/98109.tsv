2008-08-31T07:34:00.000Z	arielkhandadash		Hey guys, this is sorta my first time using IRC so I was wondering if someone can show me to the appropriate channel. I'm looking to buy a new "NetBook" pc for myself and plan to run ubuntu. I have never used ubuntu before but I plan on using it for the netbook and future endeavors. Firstly, can anyone point me into the direction of somewhere where people can give me advice on which NetBook to buy?
