2005-07-07T14:43:00.000Z	TFK		Howdy guys, it seems that the default apt repositories that Synaptic gives me by default are a bit outdated (I'm particularly interesting in up-to-date clamav and cgoban), so I've been trying to find some kind of unsafe repository, but no luck.
2005-07-07T14:43:00.000Z	TFK		Or are the repositories the same as Debian's?
2005-07-07T14:43:00.000Z	TFK		Yes.
2005-07-07T14:43:00.000Z	Seveas	TFK	maybe backports can help you
