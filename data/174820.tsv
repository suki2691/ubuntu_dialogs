2006-07-15T15:46:00.000Z	dbe	ic56	Ok.
2006-07-15T15:47:00.000Z	dbe	ic56	I'm not using Ubuntu, does it use iptables?
2006-07-15T15:49:00.000Z	ic56	dbe	yes, Ubuntu has /sbin/iptables , from which I presume that the rest of the functionality is there.  However, I have not used it -- the ubuntu box doesn't act as my firewall
