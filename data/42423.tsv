2010-09-11T02:25:00.000Z	hihihi100		if I have succesfully installed-upgraded ALSA via AlsaUpgrade-1.0.23-2.sh, and when running cat /proc/asound/version I get cat: /proc/asound/version: No such file or directory, what should I do? U can see the ALSA information of my laptop in http://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=1b0fa73915fd1553ddd7b381181bb2a64abde167

2010-09-11T02:27:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	hihihi100	if you want new versions of alsa, just update the normal way
