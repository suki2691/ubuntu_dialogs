2011-05-12T05:27:00.000Z	InfectedSoul		i thought with the latest ubuntu 10.10 2.6.35-24-generic-pae kernel, the Asus USB-N13 300Mbps adapter is fully plug & play.
2011-05-12T05:27:00.000Z	InfectedSoul		i have 10.11 and its not working
2011-05-12T05:28:00.000Z	coz_	InfectedSoul	 well thats likely because there is not 10.11  there is 10.04   10.10  and 11.04
2011-08-08T18:12:00.000Z	coz_	InfectedSoul	 does deluge have the option of chaning directories?
