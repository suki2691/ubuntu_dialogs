2009-01-27T05:13:00.000Z	Halai		I am experiencing a bug which is exactly the same as described in Bug 225975 in Launchpad. The issue has been confirmed resolved but I'm not sure how to resolve it on my end. Could someone help me out please
2009-01-27T05:15:00.000Z	Halai		How do I go about going from kernel linux-image-2.6.27-* to linux-image-2.6.26-*
