2008-09-05T10:58:00.000Z	Losowski		ok, important question which will help me decide which to install: Which OS operates 'faster" (not referring to boot time, but speed in running desktop applications, etc)...Ubuntu or OpenSuse...your answeres would be greatly appreciated...Thank you!
2008-09-05T10:59:00.000Z	Losowski		Because the fastest OS I've used in FreeBSDE
2008-09-05T10:59:00.000Z	Kurt	Losowski	I switched from OpenSuSE to Ubuntu a couple of years ago...at least at the time, I noticed an improvement in runtime with Ubuntu over OpenSuSE
