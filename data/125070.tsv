2007-10-23T07:44:00.000Z	BlackTech		Can anyone help me I just downloaded the ubunu 7.10 from the website and the file is in a .rar how do I install?
2007-10-23T07:45:00.000Z	scguy318	BlackTech	its an ISO, dont be confused by the WinRAR file handlers
2007-10-23T07:45:00.000Z	scguy318	BlackTech	since it handles ISO too
2007-10-23T07:45:00.000Z	scguy318	BlackTech	or its just an iso :P
