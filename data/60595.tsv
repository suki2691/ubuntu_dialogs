2010-03-18T23:57:00.000Z	Nielsen		127.0.0.1 is localhost, 127.0.1.1 is the hostname
2010-03-18T23:57:00.000Z	hal	Nielsen	but why not 127.0.0.1 for both.  This is a relatvely new thing - what is the advantage of doing this?
2010-03-18T23:58:00.000Z	Nielsen	hal	i have no idea. I just like the fact that 127.0.0.1 is localhost, and not my box' name
2010-03-18T23:59:00.000Z	Nielsen	hal	i changed it, so my box' name points to it's lan ip
