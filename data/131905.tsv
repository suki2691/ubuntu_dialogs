2007-06-09T08:49:00.000Z	Smegzor		ok I have found my kernel files in synaptic.  I want to do a complete removal of all but the last two?  I figure I shouldn't remove the version I just upgraded from just yet.
2007-06-09T08:49:00.000Z	mrsn0	Smegzor	first of all be 101% sure the new kernel isn't causing any problems
2007-06-09T08:51:00.000Z	Smegzor	mrsn0	even if it is, I want to upgrade to fiesty immediately anyway.  Does it matter if its got problems?  Also this is a file server only.
2007-06-09T08:52:00.000Z	mrsn0	Smegzor	please check the upgrade notes
