2007-10-20T22:25:00.000Z	bruenig	charles	the script that runs after the files in the package have been moved into the filesystem failed
2007-10-20T22:26:00.000Z	bruenig	charles	depending on what the script was supposed to do, it may not even matter, you would want to take a look at the script, should be in /var/apt somewhere iirc, and go from there. There is no "you do this for sure" kind of answer to this, it depends on the package.
