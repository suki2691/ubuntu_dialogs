2011-06-30T04:49:00.000Z	lov		Hi, I'm using jaunty, and I can't use apt-get update to get any packages. I just get 404s. Looking at the site itself, it looks like jaunty no longer exists (but stuff like dapper is still there)
2011-06-30T04:49:00.000Z	lov		is there any way for me to upgrade to a newer distro? Is this even advisable for me using a lower end netbook?
2011-06-30T04:50:00.000Z	lov		preferably without downloading a new CD :|
