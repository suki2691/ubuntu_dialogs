2009-02-19T16:27:00.000Z	Favorit	bangalibabu_	what kind of information?
2009-02-19T16:30:00.000Z	Favorit	bangalibabu_	please don't pm me, i'm barely following the channel, let alone private messages
2009-02-19T16:31:00.000Z	Favorit	bangalibabu_	but the question: you can use "top" to see running processes, you can use "df" to see disk space, you can use "ifconfig" to see VERy basic net stats
