2008-04-27T14:45:00.000Z	seamus7		Why are there two Actions schedulers listed in Services (anacron and atd) and two Computer Activity Loggers (klogd and sysklogd) and two Power Managements (acpid and apmd) ... can I disable one of each?
2008-04-27T14:47:00.000Z	virtuald	seamus7	no, they do different things
2008-04-27T14:48:00.000Z	virtuald	seamus7	though i could remove at without breaking anything
2008-04-27T14:48:00.000Z	seamus7	virtuald	ok .. I've always wondered if I had installed two sets back when I had temporarily installed KDE Desktop in addition to Gnome .. thanks
