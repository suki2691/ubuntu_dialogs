2012-03-16T19:12:00.000Z	Defusal		is it possible to safely remove some space from the swap partitions size and add it to the /home partitions size? keep in mind i would be working remotely and cannot afford to lose ssh access to the system

2012-03-16T19:14:00.000Z	Defusal		but now it seems that its hardware raid 1
