2011-07-22T05:07:00.000Z	ichbinder_		hello. I need to install sun-java6-jdk and a few weeks ago that still was found in synaptic and installed, when canonical partners was added as repository. Now I installed same ubuntu 11.04 on a different machine today and it can't find sun-java6-jdk anymore, even though canonical partners etc. is the same...?

2011-07-22T05:12:00.000Z	ichbinder_	Polah	oh man... I shouldn't setup a new system last minute when I need it 9 hours later for a demo... and then forget to reload package list... -.-
