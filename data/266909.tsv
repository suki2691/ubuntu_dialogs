2010-12-29T23:39:00.000Z	Pawmaniac		back to what i meant to ask... do emulators run generally faster on linux?
2010-12-29T23:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Pawmaniac	  depends on the emulator.
2010-12-29T23:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Pawmaniac	 when my C64 emulator can run at 10,000x normal C64 speed... its hard to really worry about if windows can do 10,002x speed :)
2010-12-29T23:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Pawmaniac	 you would have to just try it and see. Thats a very new and work in progress emulator.
