2007-11-23T00:24:00.000Z	sproingie		should i use a theme manager other than emerald?  it seems to be kind of buggy

2007-11-23T00:27:00.000Z	sproingie	Jordan_U_	i tweaked it with emerald tho.  is emerald the standard way of packaging compiz themes or is there something builtin?  i'm not entirely happy with emerald anyway.
