2008-12-18T14:58:00.000Z	elijah_frost		Good day ladies and gentlemen.The question is kinda kubuntu-related but I hope to get help anyway.  How do I switch keyboard layout? KMenu -> System Settings -> Regional & Language -> Keyboard Layout -> XKb options doesn't work for me (I've tried to bind it to ctrl+shift but it doesn't seem to be working). I have no idea why doesn't my binding work. What am I doing wrong if anything?
