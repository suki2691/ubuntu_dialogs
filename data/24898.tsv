2010-10-05T03:17:00.000Z	U2010		Hello. can anyone tell me what's the status of btrfs in meerkat's release candidate?
2010-10-05T03:17:00.000Z	rww	U2010	As I understand it, it's available in the installer's partitioning, but isn't default. #ubuntu+1 would likely know better.
2010-10-05T03:17:00.000Z	rww		(so you can use it, but you need to tell it to use it)
2010-10-05T03:17:00.000Z	U2010	rww	I'll ask there. thanks
