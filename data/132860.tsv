2007-10-28T21:47:00.000Z	cwgannon		can somebody please explain to me why a partition of mine would be ignoring its fstab entry?
2007-10-28T21:48:00.000Z	cwgannon		please, can somebody walk me through this ... it's not at all complicated
2007-10-28T21:49:00.000Z	kane77	cwgannon	walk through what?
2007-10-28T21:50:00.000Z	cwgannon	kane77	yesterday, i created a new ext3 part. from some unused space on my drive; i cannot, though, get it mounted in the right place and with the right permissions and with the right FS size ... everything is going wrong at once and it's really disheartening
