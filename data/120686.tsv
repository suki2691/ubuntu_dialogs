2008-04-10T23:56:00.000Z	danbhfive		hey guys, I'm looking at a tutorial on apache configuration, and it claims that my httpd.conf will be full of stuff.  Mine is blank.  Are there any tutorials/docs that are uptodate with the way ubuntu sets apache up?

2008-04-10T23:57:00.000Z	jonaskoelker	danbhfive	I think that's the major difference
2008-04-10T23:57:00.000Z	danbhfive	jonaskoelker	ok, cool, I'll look into that, thanks
