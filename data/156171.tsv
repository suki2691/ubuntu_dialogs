2006-11-29T13:03:00.000Z	Darth_Lappy71	bjron	why dont you test it yourself?
2006-11-29T13:03:00.000Z	bjron	Darth_Lappy71	because it doesn't work for me, and I want to make sure it's not just my system before I file a bug report
2006-11-29T13:04:00.000Z	Darth_Lappy71	bjron	go to #lfswiki so i can talk to you with out all the other people and ill test it for you
