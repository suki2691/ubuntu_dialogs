2011-08-03T00:20:00.000Z	jtannenbaum		I'm on 10.04 and apt-get keeps telling me to update linux headers and stuff but I'm too afraid to update or upgrade to any higher version of Ubuntu without a clean install.. what should I do (besides a clean install)?
2011-08-03T00:21:00.000Z	jtannenbaum		either way doing either of those things has often broken/messed up my install in the past

2011-08-03T00:22:00.000Z	immortalz	jtannenbaum	Should it fail then reboot using the kernel that worked before ;)
