2007-04-13T16:27:00.000Z	kbidd	Lbawinowns	yep :)
2007-04-13T16:31:00.000Z	kbidd	Lbawinowns	do you have the drive mounted properly (use the commmand "mount" with no options to display all currently mounted devices with the filesystem they are mounted as... if its an XP partition, its most likely ntfs)
2007-04-13T16:33:00.000Z	kbidd	Lbawinowns	yes, just type "mount" (without the quotes) in a terminal
