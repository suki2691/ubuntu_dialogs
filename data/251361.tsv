2007-04-19T12:34:00.000Z	szymon_g		what's is the difference (in Feisty alternate cd) between 'instal command line system' and 'install something-something for manufactures'?
2007-04-19T12:34:00.000Z	szymon_g		could anyone tell me that difference?
2007-04-19T12:35:00.000Z	r3m0t	szymon_g	I think you want "command line system"
