2008-03-20T18:52:00.000Z	ggergely		i just want to state that ubuntu sucks. it lacks LVM support, the only useful feature of the lajnugz kernel. i wanted to use it to recover my root password on a machine, but now i'm shot.
2008-03-20T18:53:00.000Z	ggergely		but i do not want to install ubunu
2008-03-20T18:53:00.000Z	blue-frog_	ggergely	lacks LVM support :)  . you must use something for use but it's not ubuntu then
