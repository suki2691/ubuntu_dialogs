2010-02-28T23:43:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	imaginativeone	define hot
2010-02-28T23:44:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	imaginativeone	none that I know of, because its not safe to resize/add/remove whilst the partition is mounted
2010-02-28T23:44:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	imaginativeone	well LVM is probably different, I personally wouldn't know
