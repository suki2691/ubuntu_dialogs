2010-01-07T08:44:00.000Z	rjb		which one is the right place to install programs manually?
2010-01-07T08:45:00.000Z	harvey	rjb	/opt/program_name
2010-01-07T08:46:00.000Z	rjb	harvey	why do i need privileges to copy to /opt?
2010-01-07T08:48:00.000Z	harvey	rjb	because it is not your home directory? ;) if you want to install some 3rd party software system wide /opt/ is the right place. Otherwise ~/ as banished suggested
