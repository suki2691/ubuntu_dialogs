2004-11-08T16:23:00.000Z	sabdfl	jamaas	do you fix it manually just by creating a symblink?
2004-11-08T16:23:00.000Z	jamaas	sabdfl	not just the symlink but aslo creating ttyUSB0 and 1
2004-11-08T16:25:00.000Z	jamaas	sabdfl	that is how I create the tty (modules?) each time I boot, but next time they are gone! :(
