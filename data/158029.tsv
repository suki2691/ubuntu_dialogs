2007-10-23T12:45:00.000Z	Slart	askvictor	you could install a deb-cache and make the next computer use that..
2007-10-23T12:45:00.000Z	askvictor	haru	that sounds hard and I'm lazy
2007-10-23T12:46:00.000Z	Slart	askvictor	I guess you could burn them to a cd/dvd and tell the next computer to use that.. but I don't know if that requires something special.. like folders, special files etc
