2007-05-14T12:38:00.000Z	RAOF	sivaji	No, you can use either i386 or AMD64 on an AMD.
2007-05-14T12:39:00.000Z	sivaji	RAOF	: i could see separate package for amd processor
2007-05-14T12:40:00.000Z	RAOF	sivaji	Yes, and you can use either the i386 or the AMD64 version.  Although you probably want the i386 one.
