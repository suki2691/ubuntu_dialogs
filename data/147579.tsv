2008-02-08T13:51:00.000Z	Roy		I would like to delete all the windows applications in wine and just to re-check, the command would be "rm -rf ~/.wine" Is that right or do I have to prefix it with sudo?
2008-02-08T13:52:00.000Z	fragged	Roy	that should work, then you have to call another comman to rebuild .wine
2008-02-08T13:53:00.000Z	Roy	fragged	I tried using that command but I didn't notice any change
2008-02-08T13:54:00.000Z	fragged	Roy	I'm new to wine and I had no .wine dir, after callitg that or something else it seemed to be build and had a few essentual looking applications such as explorer.exe
