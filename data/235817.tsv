2006-03-23T16:06:00.000Z	H0lyD4wg		will it cause problems if i upgrade straight from hoary to dapper without going through breezy first?
2006-03-23T16:07:00.000Z	Madpilot	H0lyD4wg	probably :P
2006-03-23T16:08:00.000Z	Madpilot		Hoary -> Breezy -> Dapper would proably be safer
2006-03-23T16:11:00.000Z	H0lyD4wg	Madpilot	thanks, i'll just d/l a dapper cd then.
