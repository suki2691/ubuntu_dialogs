With "apt-get install lsb", I got "lsb: Depends: lsb-core but it is not going to be installed", ....  That doesn't seem like user-friendly at all if my package depends on lsb. Some lsb's dependencies seem to conflicts with lsb itself, but I'm not entirely sure.

2008-06-27T23:49:00.000Z	asmo[B]	dyek	try doing sudo apt-get remove lsb && sudo apt-get autoremove then try installing the lsb package again...
