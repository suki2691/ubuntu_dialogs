2009-01-04T12:57:00.000Z	KTL		what is the exact difference between a ubuntu and a debian install?
2009-01-04T12:58:00.000Z	KTL		if i install a ubuntu, change the sources.list and upgrade heavily ... what remains of ubuntu?
2009-01-04T12:59:00.000Z	rww	KTL	change the sources.list to what? debian? what would remain would probably be very broken
2009-01-04T12:59:00.000Z	rww	KTL	although some crazy people could probably get it to work. I've seen crazier... why would you want to do that, though?
