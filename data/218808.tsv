2011-05-10T21:32:00.000Z	DrShoggoth		I have two natty installs on different hardware, and they both like to crash when I unlock them from the screensaver
2011-05-10T21:32:00.000Z	DrShoggoth		is this a known issue?
2011-05-10T21:33:00.000Z	sipior	DrShoggoth	both running the same screensaver?
2011-05-10T21:36:00.000Z	sipior	DrShoggoth	i guess the tentacles were a given, considering your nick :-) do both machines lock up after a similar period of time?
