2006-08-01T15:28:00.000Z	toxicfume		Does Ubuntu work out of the box with Acer Laptops' wireless lan that have hard-switches? My Wireless card is an Intel Wireless 2200B/G
2006-08-01T15:28:00.000Z	mwe	toxicfume	ipw2200 is very well supported in linux at least
2006-08-01T15:29:00.000Z	mwe	toxicfume	but I think you need to download the firmware yourself as it's not allowed to redistribute it
2006-08-01T15:29:00.000Z	toxicfume	mwe	and frying_fish: but the problem is that my laptop has a hardswitch for the wireless card that is turned off by default on the computers startup. I have had problems other with Linux distributions not detecting the hardswitch
