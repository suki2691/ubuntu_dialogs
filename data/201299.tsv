2006-01-13T13:05:00.000Z	fancyydk		Hi, I have a question about Linux distros. Are all distros equally customizable?
2006-01-13T13:06:00.000Z	made	fancyydk	no.. then there is gentoo
2006-01-13T13:09:00.000Z	made	fancyydk	I liked SuSe. I like gentoo.. I have been able to set up gentoo to my liking
2006-01-13T13:13:00.000Z	made	fancyydk	yeah.. you need to try out the easier distros first and get a feel.. then move up
