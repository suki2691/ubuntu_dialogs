2007-04-13T07:14:00.000Z	regress		I have a slightly different question, but thought here would be a good place to ask - what tools would you recommend for making a script that will pull down a series of webpages, run regular expressions on them, and then output that to a text file?
2007-04-13T07:14:00.000Z	regress		should I use shell scripting and wget, or make a python applet, or what?
2007-04-13T07:15:00.000Z	regress		hmm, interesting
2007-04-13T07:15:00.000Z	xtknight	regress	bash will do it
