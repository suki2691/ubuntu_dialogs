2008-10-31T14:09:00.000Z	nayfly		can anybody suggest a hard drive mounting GUI for ubuntu?
2008-10-31T14:09:00.000Z	nayfly		preferably which allows auto-mount
2008-10-31T14:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nayfly	if its an internal drive it will automount
2008-10-31T14:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nayfly	you can add lines to /etc/fstab and it will automount at boot
