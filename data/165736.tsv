2007-07-03T07:10:00.000Z	Sp4rKy		does anyone know how split a dd output on 2G files ?
2007-07-03T07:11:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Sp4rKy	explain what you're doing?  I just learned how to split a file with split, but I didn't pipe anything into it
2007-07-03T07:13:00.000Z	Sp4rKy	craigbass1976	i would do the same but with disk :)
