2008-11-15T11:57:00.000Z	Lymies	chuckmoney	the first line of the script is #!/usr/bin/perl -w
2008-11-15T11:58:00.000Z	Lymies		Nope. I'm running flac2mp3.pl
2008-11-15T11:58:00.000Z	chuckmoney	Lymies	no clue why it would be failing then, since those commands are basically one and the same.  try checking your $path and see if one of the other locations listed first also has perl in it
