2010-08-09T18:39:00.000Z	SeaOrifice		hii, i have installed ubuntu inside Windows 7; When i m trying to change my eth0 settings it asks for a root password, even if i enter correctly, it still says authentication failure
2010-08-09T18:40:00.000Z	SeaOrifice		though when i change to root in terminal it works fine
2010-08-09T18:41:00.000Z	SeaOrifice		can someone answer me ?
