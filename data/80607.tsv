2008-09-04T14:08:00.000Z	Rdy		when i try to boot off unbuntu it says something about GRUB Loading 1.51. and then just restarts :(?
2008-09-04T14:09:00.000Z	djhash	Rdy	grub was not installed properly
2008-09-04T14:09:00.000Z	djhash		!gurb > Rdy
2008-09-04T14:10:00.000Z	Rdy	djhash	i just let ubuntu install it, does that mean i did something wrong with the partitions ?
