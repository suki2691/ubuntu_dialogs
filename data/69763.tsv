2009-01-08T08:14:00.000Z	Logomachist		I asked this earlier but my problem still isn't fixed so I'll ask again:
2009-01-08T08:14:00.000Z	Logomachist		Grub doesn't kick in after installing Ubuntu. What can I do? I tried "install-grub" but the command wasn't found. I tried Auto Super Grub Disk for Windows but that didn't do anything.
