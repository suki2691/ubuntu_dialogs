2009-12-18T16:11:00.000Z	MartinCleaver		Y, completely freezes. Doesn't respond to caps lock, to ctrl-alt-delete
2009-12-18T16:12:00.000Z	MartinCleaver		or to ctrl-alt-backspace
2009-12-18T16:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MartinCleaver	there are a few X30 guides here: http://www.linux-laptop.net/ibm.html
