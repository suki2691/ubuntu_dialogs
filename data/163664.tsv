2007-06-17T13:46:00.000Z	damageDOne		Hi everyone, Does anyone know how to install kde themes in gnome so that kde apps running in gnome will have the theme. For example, I have ubuntustudio theme installed in gnome but amarok isn't affected. I've read that I can install a similar kde theme so that kde apps will blend in better. Any ideas? I've looked on google but I just get howtos on themeing ubuntu or kde or amarok but nothing for themeing amarok in gnome.
