I used alien to change it to a .deb file and installed it. but when I try to run LimeWire in the terminal I get "(" unexpected (expecting "}") . I was talking to a friend a while ago and he said to update java, I was running 6.10 at the time so I did, but it still wouldn't work so I had to use some special command to start it. My question now is,...
2007-04-28T08:47:00.000Z	BK		...Does 7.04 have updated java? WHat command would I need to use in order to start LimeWIre?
