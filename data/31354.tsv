2010-06-13T08:43:00.000Z	Gnea	ne7work_	^^^
2010-06-13T08:43:00.000Z	ne7work_	Gnea	I uninstall mine network-manager with sudo apt-get remove network-manager
2010-06-13T08:45:00.000Z	Gnea	ne7work_	yes, that is the problem. you should be able to use wicd or networkmanager to handle a static ip with pppoe. personally, I prefer wicd.
