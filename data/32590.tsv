2010-05-04T01:20:00.000Z	WoodieAllen		I am on Windows 7 and would like to install Ubuntu 10.04 using WUBI.  I would like to report that WUBI does not except Unicode characters in the username field so I can't use my name as the username
2010-05-04T01:20:00.000Z	WoodieAllen		why doesn't WUBI accept Unicode characters?
