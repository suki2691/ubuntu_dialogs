2006-02-18T10:47:00.000Z	NoStress	beniamino_	what is extra , something else than multi, universe or restricted  ?
2006-02-18T10:54:00.000Z	beniamino_	NoStress	it was where a whole load of restricted stuff lived for hoary.  much of that stuff seems to be in breezy-multiverse.  i think it was an ubuntu-backports project
2006-02-18T10:55:00.000Z	NoStress	beniamino_	ok, thanks
