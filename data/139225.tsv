2007-04-20T16:22:00.000Z	Adimanuk		Hey, where can I change the resolution for the login screen? It doesn't seem to follow what I set for the desktop
2007-04-20T16:22:00.000Z	Subhuman	Adimanuk	it uses your xorg.conf settings- and uses the highest resolution
2007-04-20T16:22:00.000Z	Subhuman	Adimanuk	run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and follow that-  itll let you select resolutions you want.
