2010-06-26T04:06:00.000Z	gperaltascura		(Sorry for my bad English) Is it better to update Ubuntu formatting the partition again or is it the same if I just use the upgrade option?
2010-06-26T04:06:00.000Z	gperaltascura		for example from 9.10 to 10.04
2010-06-26T04:06:00.000Z	Blue1	gperaltascura	backup /etc/ and /home/ and do a fresh install
2010-06-26T04:07:00.000Z	Blue1	gperaltascura	I have run into grub problems, and some programmes not being updated properly...
