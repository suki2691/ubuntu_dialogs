2008-09-01T06:27:00.000Z	odditie		Can someone point me in the direction to fix my screen resolution? Just installed Ubuntu, have some previous experience, but it has been a long time
2008-09-01T06:27:00.000Z	odditie		it has absolutely nothing in it
2008-09-01T06:28:00.000Z	dash9	odditie	try system - preferences - screen resolution
2008-09-01T06:29:00.000Z	odditie	dash9	only goes to 1024 x X, that is too small for my liking
