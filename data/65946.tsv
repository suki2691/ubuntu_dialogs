2009-11-07T01:07:00.000Z	PITA1		Hi All, I've been trying to download b0146b3d658d2471c7d4e9e43d32f24431d5a9bf ubuntu-9.10-desktop-powerpc+ps3.iso torrent for 2 days now, and nothing happens. I've got the normal 9.10 32 and 64bit cd's to download via bittorrent, but the PS3 one does not want to budge, not one bit.
