2009-10-19T08:14:00.000Z	Bluey		I'm trying to find a Linux Media Player that will decode closed  captioning on DVDs. closed captioning != subtitles  I have tried:Â  totem, mplayer, and vlc -- they do subtitles, but NOT  closed captioning.
2009-10-19T08:14:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Bluey	Would you please make sure there is a bug filed against VLC for that? It should do it.
2009-10-19T08:15:00.000Z	Bluey	Mike_lifeguard	not a bug -- it's a feature that's not present
2009-10-19T08:16:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Bluey	Sure, but we still call them bugs (it is shorter that "enhancement request")
