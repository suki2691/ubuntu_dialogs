2010-02-01T12:35:00.000Z	Jonathan_Glam		Hi sorry. But is it possible for me to create a swap space after I've installed ubuntu?
2010-02-01T12:35:00.000Z	Jonathan_Glam		just looking at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq
2010-02-01T12:36:00.000Z	Jonathan_Glam		Because I can't seem to get it to create a swap file out of my partition that I've made for Ubuntu. So maybe if I install it there then create a swap space?
