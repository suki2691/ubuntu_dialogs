2010-03-22T23:00:00.000Z	andrevanzuydam		Ok - but when i need to run a whole group of commands - ie compiling etc - its a pain to do sudo each time, what is the difference ?
2010-03-22T23:00:00.000Z	andrevanzuydam		I would like to understand this properly

2010-03-22T23:00:00.000Z	bobstro	andrevanzuydam	 there's a timeout
