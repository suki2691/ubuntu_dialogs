2008-08-19T20:17:00.000Z	TJ-Linux		I've messed up my Ubuntu settings a little bit too much trying to get my dual monitor setup to work I think and want to try to reinstall... If I keep my /home partition, what exactly will be preserved -- settings for installed applications, but not the applications themselves or Ubuntu settings?
