2007-05-15T07:36:00.000Z	seamus7	Tom47	I'm just looking for an easy way to open some ports permanently.
2007-05-15T07:38:00.000Z	seamus7	Tom47	yeah... I do that ... I have a static ip profile in Network that I use when I use Azureus for torrent sharing ... but something is not working quite right ... I have a feelilng it's a NAT error somewhere ... maybe my ISP has reassigned my area with different addresses???
2007-05-15T07:40:00.000Z	seamus7	Tom47	I have a DSL modem/router that connects to my Belkin wireless router which I've set as an Access Point .... which simplifies everything ..
