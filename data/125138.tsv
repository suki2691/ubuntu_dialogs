2007-10-24T05:49:00.000Z	gary_inNYC		can anyone please tell me what i reference Nautilus as in imwheelrc?  im thinking it's "^Nautilus-bin$" though i'm not certain
2007-10-24T05:49:00.000Z	scguy318	gary_inNYC	should be just nautilus
2007-10-24T06:01:00.000Z	scguy318	gary_inNYC	i think Compiz 0.3 has a bug which screws up the latest fglrx
2007-10-24T06:01:00.000Z	scguy318	gary_inNYC	0.6 has it resolved
