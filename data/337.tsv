The system works absolutely fine for days with no signs of failure then it will just shoot this error and stop.  Is it related to this?
2012-11-21T02:03:00.000Z	Clair		sorry about that I had a link queued up for the end.  There was a bug report about this
2012-11-21T02:03:00.000Z	Clair		I do not have a machine to test them in.  They were 3 brandnew just shipped drives though and they all fail the same way.  I cant believe it is the drives
