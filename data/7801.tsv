2011-11-20T11:32:00.000Z	tripelb		I have a question: three's something that is a bunch of linux stuff, runs a shell, and it starts with cynus or cyrus or cygnus
2011-11-20T11:32:00.000Z	brjannc	tripelb	cygwin, but that's beyond the scope of this channel
2011-11-20T11:35:00.000Z	brjannc	tripelb	try #cygwinx
2011-11-20T11:37:00.000Z	brjannc	tripelb	sure thing
