2006-11-24T13:12:00.000Z	Ernz		Hi everyone am trying to install Ubuntu 6.06 on an older computer with 750Mhz Athlon, 650MB RAM, 64MB NVidia Grphx card. Should this work??
2006-11-24T13:12:00.000Z	Terminus	Ernz	it should.
2006-11-24T13:13:00.000Z	Ernz	Terminus	I am getting to the "This is Ubuntu Live CD." "For the default live system, press ENTER." - But the cursor isn't flashing and nothing happens when I hit ENTER of F1, whats the deal?
2006-11-24T13:14:00.000Z	Terminus	Ernz	hmmm... i've never encountered that problem. then again, i never use the livecd.
