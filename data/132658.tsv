2008-11-15T08:54:00.000Z	fryguy	genii	sudo does not exhibit that behavior for me
2008-11-15T08:56:00.000Z	genii	fryguy	After testing I agree it works as you say
2008-11-15T08:57:00.000Z	fryguy	genii	sudo doesn't run a login shell by default, so it will not change the current environment variables, so HOME for example is unchanged
