2007-07-06T07:22:00.000Z	tretle		can someone help me recover from a partial upgrade to gutsy, basically i want a full upgrade but the upgrade manager crashed when i was upgrading so i had to do a partial upgrade instead
2007-07-06T07:22:00.000Z	macogw	tretle	did you try just running the upgrade again?
2007-07-06T07:23:00.000Z	macogw	tretle	i had a half-dapper/half-edgy system at one point because of that crap, but running the gui updater again fixed it
