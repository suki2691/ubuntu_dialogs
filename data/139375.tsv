2007-04-17T11:39:00.000Z	ybott		Hello, a new ubuntu user.  I plugged my zip drive into my computer, It asked me what do you want to do, I clicked open in new window, but nothing happened. How do I mount a zip drive or find wherever it went?
2007-04-17T11:40:00.000Z	ybott		anybody know what device a zip drive sits on?
