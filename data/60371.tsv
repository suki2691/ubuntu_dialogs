2011-04-28T08:52:00.000Z	gueriLLaPunK		i want to make a SSH shell for a friend. what settings do I enter for his username?
2011-04-28T08:52:00.000Z	gueriLLaPunK		like User ID or shell access... just /bin/sh?
2011-04-28T08:52:00.000Z	celthunder	gueriLLaPunK	whatever you want? just make sure he has a shell and preferably a home dir so he doesn't get thrown in /
