If your / and /home partitions are also going to be ext2 - ext4 then there is no need for a separate /boot partition

2010-08-15T19:48:00.000Z	napterk	headkase314	thank you for the articles. I only take ext4 for the system partitions. I always had /boot on a separate partition but I never understand why this is better.
