2008-08-17T23:46:00.000Z	Lunks		How to install packages which are necessary to compile a program? I forgot how to do it...
2008-08-17T23:47:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	Lunks	you could try synaptic package manager
2008-08-17T23:47:00.000Z	Lunks	speedhunt3r	hmm I'd rather use apt-get (just console on that computer)
2008-08-17T23:49:00.000Z	Lunks	speedhunt3r	it's build-dep
