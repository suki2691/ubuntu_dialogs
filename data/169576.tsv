I have ubuntu on my laptop and I have downloaded the SmartBoard software.....however....I can't seem to get it to detect the board.....hooked up via laptop USB to Serial port on Smartboard. Has anyone here had experience getting ubuntu to work with a Smartboard (interactive whiteboard)...I'm running ubuntu 6.10
