2008-05-08T23:32:00.000Z	StevenTyler		Well I am considering installing Ubuntu onto my box which has XP already installed. I have C/D/E/F, with E having enough space for an Unbuntu installation. Can I install it on E or should I need to make some space on C for Ubuntu?
2008-05-08T23:32:00.000Z	Mimi	StevenTyler	   Install it in E if you want
2008-05-08T23:33:00.000Z	StevenTyler	Mimi	I hope it won't be problem? Cos I remember installing Red Hat 9 some years ago and it requiring me to do some MBR stuff.
