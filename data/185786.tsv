2007-10-11T08:52:00.000Z	pike__	vanberge	you should be able to just grab the tar.gz from mozilla website  and unpack and run it
2007-10-11T08:52:00.000Z	vanberge	pike_	i saw that - but figured tar.gz would be source code
2007-10-11T08:53:00.000Z	pike__	vanberge	to be honest ive never installed thunderbird but that holds tru for firefox and such
