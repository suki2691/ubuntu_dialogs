2008-09-26T19:10:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	spsneo	probably to do with the existing audio back-end (or another audio application) hacing exclusive access to the sound hardware
2008-09-26T19:11:00.000Z	spsneo	IntuitiveNipple	any solution
2008-09-26T19:12:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	spsneo	Well I'm sure there is one - let me know when you find it! :D
