2007-09-29T16:05:00.000Z	r7o		I would like to know if Gnash works under Ubuntu 64. any idea?
2007-09-29T16:06:00.000Z	soundray	r7o	it's designed to work, but it's still experimental.
2007-09-29T16:08:00.000Z	soundray	r7o	I tried it in Ubuntu feisty 64, that didn't work either, but nspluginwrapper works well there.
2007-09-29T16:10:00.000Z	soundray	r7o	I can't test it right now, but it works with youtube
