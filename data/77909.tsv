2008-11-23T17:23:00.000Z	paul68		Hi I was just wondering are there any distros where soundcards from creative labs working almost from out of the box?
2008-11-23T17:25:00.000Z	Frogzoo	paul68	sound blasters are widely supported
2008-11-23T17:26:00.000Z	paul68	Frogzoo	 yes I do know that however the xfi card is not surrendering without a big fight was wondering if there is a distro that has less trouble with it then ubuntu
2008-11-23T17:32:00.000Z	paul68	Frogzoo	any ideas?
