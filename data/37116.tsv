2011-08-15T14:55:00.000Z	janedoe		the terminal tells me to check /var/log/rkhunter.log , how do I get there?
2011-08-15T14:55:00.000Z	janedoe		ok thanks so far
2011-08-15T14:55:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	janedoe	what error all I see is not shared libraries and mail warnings... that is just a log
2011-08-15T14:56:00.000Z	DebiansArmy	janedoe	unless something is not working its just a warning
