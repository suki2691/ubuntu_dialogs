2011-12-04T01:46:00.000Z	KomiaPoika		i need to edit a config on a usb drive with openbsd BSD 4.2 filesystem, is it possible in ubuntu?
2011-12-04T01:47:00.000Z	ThinkT510	KomiaPoika	i think openbsd uses ffs by default so i don't think so
2011-12-04T01:48:00.000Z	ThinkT510	KomiaPoika	not that i'm aware of, though i must admit i haven't really looked
