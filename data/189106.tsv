2008-12-05T17:30:00.000Z	darryl		I'm playing with a new install of Dapper 6.06, my screen saver works ok, but when I wake up in theh morning, the box is frozen, and won't reboot into X. Running startx  at reboot locks up too. To get here now, I had to boot into safe graphics mode, recreate my user, etc... I didn't have this trouble with 5.10, ideas?

2008-12-05T17:32:00.000Z	darryl	ardchoille	roger that, and that is my plan, but I can't get 8.04 until 6.06 is working.
2008-12-05T17:33:00.000Z	ardchoille	darryl	ah, ok
