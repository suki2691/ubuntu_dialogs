2007-04-29T08:43:00.000Z	goxen		I'm trying to install some deb packages that I've downloaded. how do I convince apt-get to find them?
2007-04-29T08:45:00.000Z	goxen		so apt-get can't install from local filesystem?
2007-04-29T08:46:00.000Z	PMantis	goxen	It can... /etc/apt/sources.list can to point to a local repository, too.
