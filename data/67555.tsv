2009-02-06T07:47:00.000Z	Mike_92		Can someone link me to a tutorial that will let me set up user accounts over a network so I can access the same user accounts from different computers around my house?
2009-02-06T07:48:00.000Z	cast|lir	Mike_92	hmmm, could export their home dirs via NFS
2009-02-06T07:49:00.000Z	Mike_92	cast|lir	Do you know of a tutorial that will tell me how to do that?
2009-02-06T07:51:00.000Z	cast|lir	Mike_92	not a specific one. google will answer such things. ;). just just remote login to boxes as well, in a server-thinclient like setup, thats probably easiest than exporting home dirs and possiby setting up centralized authentication
