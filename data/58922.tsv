Can you see anything in the server error log (if available to you) etc...
2009-04-28T16:51:00.000Z	Kahomono	hbekel	thanks I was just checking the log site to see if I was squelched.  The problem appears to be on the client side, since the Windows machines can connect the server would seem to be OK.  I tried both Nautilus and Firefox, neither can connect from the Jaunty box.  If you can tell me where to look I will check the server logs, I am more of a Windows jockey
