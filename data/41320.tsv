2010-10-09T19:59:00.000Z	mmaksimov	vexati0n	you need a flashplayer plugin
2010-10-09T20:00:00.000Z	vexati0n	mmaksimov	i have flash, it works fine in Opera, and it also works in firefox as long as it's a stupid advertisement or something
2010-10-09T20:02:00.000Z	mmaksimov	vexati0n	there are ways too many different flash plugins, mine also faulted on youtube... as a last resort, you may install adobe's non-free version, I beleive there's package flashplugin-installer that does it.... however, it may conflict with the free flashplayers so you better remove them before
