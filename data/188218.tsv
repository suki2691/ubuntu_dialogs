2006-05-23T05:48:00.000Z	Nullified		Hey guys, this is probably a bit of a weird one, But i listen to alot of foreign music, namely tatu, but some of my stuff is in russian, however the GUI displays this in funny characters instead of the proper russian ones, Anyone know how to allow the proper russian ones?
