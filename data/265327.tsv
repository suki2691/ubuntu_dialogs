2004-09-28T09:48:00.000Z	renners		hrdwr_BoB: yesterday I asked you about screen res (I could only get 1024, not 1280). FYI I have fixed this by re-installing and picking the correct res during setup! thanks. 
2004-09-28T09:49:00.000Z	sladen	renners	you should be able change this by doing   sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86
2004-09-28T09:50:00.000Z	sladen		although thanks for reminding us that it's actually easier for most people to just reinstall...
2004-09-28T09:50:00.000Z	renners	sladen	i tried nut it didn't work... re-install was drastic but did the job!
