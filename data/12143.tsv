2012-03-21T18:10:00.000Z	LucidGuy		Is it possible to registar a web ssl cert with a common name containing a wildcard?  *.domainname.com?
2012-03-21T18:12:00.000Z	MestreLion	LucidGuy	as in *.mywebsite.com ?
2012-03-21T18:13:00.000Z	LucidGuy	MestreLion	yes .. a single wildcard for all hosts/sites of a domain.
2012-03-21T18:13:00.000Z	MestreLion	LucidGuy	as ikonia said, it's only dangerous to your pockets :P
