2005-02-01T15:47:00.000Z	Falstius	svenl	set up your dvd drive with scsi emulation otherwise you can't do dma with cdrecord (so far as I know)
2005-02-01T15:48:00.000Z	svenl	Falstius	i thought scsi emulation was obsoleted in 2.6 kernels.
2005-02-01T15:48:00.000Z	svenl	Falstius	and it worked fine in cdrecord with dvd patch on real debian, so i am baffled.
