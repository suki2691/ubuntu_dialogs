2009-09-29T06:46:00.000Z	Cryp71c		I'm downloading the netbook remix of ubuntu, which is in a .img file and I've been using unetbootin to write .iso to a thumb drive for installation.
2009-09-29T06:47:00.000Z	Cryp71c		However unetbootin can't handle .img files as near as I can tell, anyone have any suggestions?
