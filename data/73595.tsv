2012-04-28T08:40:00.000Z	r4y		The Ubuntu Software Center is stuck with what I was installing. I am new to Unity and just installed Ubuntu 12.04 yesterday. Is there a force quit?, I liked Gnome because of the force quit applet.
2012-04-28T08:41:00.000Z	r4y		I guess I could just try closing, never mind
2012-04-28T08:41:00.000Z	pepee	r4y	stuck downloading?
