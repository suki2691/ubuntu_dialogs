2011-07-07T07:28:00.000Z	afallenhope		Hey guys, I had a quick question about iptables /linux firewalls. I have disabled iptables by allowing all traffic through. I was just wondering why is it that port is still not being open?
2011-07-07T07:29:00.000Z	afallenhope		I've tried using netcat and listening on the port but even then it didn't take.
2011-07-07T07:30:00.000Z	lapaga	afallenhope	so you have no firewall and all ports are open listening and you want what??? a honeypot?
2011-07-07T07:32:00.000Z	afallenhope	lapaga	no I'm just trying to allow connections to a single port
