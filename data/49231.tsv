2009-09-07T10:23:00.000Z	Tekk		how to I have gcc compile a C program into a plain executable(not a.out)
2009-09-07T10:23:00.000Z	kahen	Tekk	man gcc tells you "gcc -o hello hello_world.c"
2009-09-07T10:34:00.000Z	kahen	Tekk	yes. why could that POSSIBLY be?! i mean... it's not like it expects something after "-o"... eh... wait... yes it does
2009-09-07T10:34:00.000Z	kahen	Tekk	seriously. read the error message.
