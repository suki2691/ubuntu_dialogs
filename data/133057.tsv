2007-10-25T11:23:00.000Z	Greyfox		G'day everyone. I'm on Windows XP x64 right now and I'm looking to install Ubuntu. What's my best option for a free disk partitioning software?
2007-10-25T11:24:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	Greyfox	Ubuntu has disk partitioning software on the CD
2007-10-25T11:24:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	Greyfox	several programs, in fact
2007-10-25T11:26:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	Greyfox	You're gonna wanna use the "manual partitioning" method when you're installing, if it's still there. I haven't played with Gutsy's installer.. things might've changed. If it's not there, Go to System > Administration > and there should be partitioning software in there
