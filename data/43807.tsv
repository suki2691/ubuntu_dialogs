2010-02-19T07:20:00.000Z	Talon_		dclick does nothing, and right click I get mute or sound preferences, and those preferences are hardly worth a darn
2010-02-19T07:20:00.000Z	quietone	Talon_	the sound pref gui in 9.04 had more options. I also don't like the 9.10 one.
2010-02-19T07:22:00.000Z	Talon_	RuediiX	like what kind of networking? Internet connection sharing?
2010-02-19T07:24:00.000Z	quietone	Talon_	a while back someone here reverted to the 9.04 sound  prefs. I kept a note that they used https://launchpad.net/~dtl131/+archive/ppa. Maybe that will help
