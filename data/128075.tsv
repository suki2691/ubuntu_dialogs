2011-06-11T01:05:00.000Z	julie	mbeierl	although it is not recommended by the "community", try "sudo su -"
2011-06-11T01:06:00.000Z	mbeierl	julie	no, it's not su that I want, I'd like tab to complete for all the things that it used to work for turned back on
2011-06-11T01:07:00.000Z	julie	mbeierl	so you mean that in a terminal window, if you type fscTAB, it doesn't work?
