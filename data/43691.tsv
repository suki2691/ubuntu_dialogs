2009-11-29T22:30:00.000Z	bcj	Snausages	I run 64 bit Ubuntu and have had no problems what so ever.  I use sound, Flash Java, Firefox, etc without problems.

2009-11-29T22:31:00.000Z	Snausages	bcj	yeah I imagine it's trouble-free in some configs, just as the 32-bit is...  but from the volume of traffic in here it certainly seems to be harder to achieve that config than with the 32bit setup
