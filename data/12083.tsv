2011-10-20T06:34:00.000Z	soupeee		I've got a 900A EEE with only a 4G SSD and 8GSD card. Oneiric is too big for it. What's the best ubuntu-like distro for it?

2011-10-20T06:37:00.000Z	soupeee	aeon-ltd	what distro? lubuntu?
2011-10-20T06:37:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	soupeee	ubuntu server, my suggestion is a lot of work though, prob 45mins
