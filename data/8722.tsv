2011-10-15T22:07:00.000Z	Gargoylle		I am against having to live by some other guys aesthetic decisions. I want to easily setup my system like I want. a simple right click like the old days will do nicely thank you. I refuse to be manhandled like gnome3 and unity do. what part of this does anyone not understand?
2011-10-15T22:07:00.000Z	Gargoylle		I am not a kid nor a nanny. I do work on my machine. and set it up so that the work flows.

2011-10-15T22:13:00.000Z	Pauluntu	Gargoylle	problem is eventually gnome2 will phase out gotta learn to move with times even if its not exactly what you desire.  I'm having to get used to this setup as well I'm a big Arch user and gnome3/unity is hard for me LOL i'm used to my desktop e17
