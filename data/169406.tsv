2006-08-28T05:40:00.000Z	RePete		@cyber - Sorry. Been so long since I've used IRC I can't remeber how to reply to just one person. No, root is kinda disabled in ubuntu. you doing things with the intial super user account. sudo -i will keep the cli running with su privs.
2006-08-28T05:41:00.000Z	bhrobinson	RePete	is it bad then to reset your root password?
2006-08-28T05:42:00.000Z	RePete	bhrobinson	- From what I've read in the forums, it is not recommended to reenable or do anything with the root acount.
