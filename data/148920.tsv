2008-08-11T03:23:00.000Z	jdrake		Is there a way to get gnome to close the nautilus window for a cdrom when it ejects, or at least reuse the window for the cdrom? (I end up with a mountain of windows)

2008-08-11T03:24:00.000Z	jdrake	unop	having the window come up is convenient
2008-08-11T03:25:00.000Z	unop	jdrake	it is .. but perhaps too much of a convenience - almost an annoyance
