2007-10-23T08:30:00.000Z	CHMEarl		In rhel I do yum groupinstall "Development Tools" to get gcc and make. What about UB?
2007-10-23T08:30:00.000Z	beta__	CHMEarl	you should have gcc and make
2007-10-23T08:31:00.000Z	beta__	CHMEarl	If not, apt-get install gcc would work
2007-10-23T08:31:00.000Z	beta__	CHMEarl	or rather, listen to the guy before me ;)
