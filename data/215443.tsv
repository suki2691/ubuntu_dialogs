2009-05-02T04:38:00.000Z	mattgyver		has anyone had issues browsing their network computers after upgrading to 9.04?  I can only browse my linux machines, none of my windows machines, and cant view the 9.04 machine filesystem from other computers.
2009-05-02T04:39:00.000Z	mattgyver		actually, might not be able to view my 9.04 cuz its an ext4 ';\ thst probably it.
2009-05-02T04:39:00.000Z	mattgyver		Can anyone verify that 8.10 cannot view an ext4 filesystem?
