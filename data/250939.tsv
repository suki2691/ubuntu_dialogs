2005-02-04T08:23:00.000Z	lanerebel	ThreeShot	I'm using an old HP Pavilion right now (PIII 1GHz) with i810 and I couldn't get X to run until I put in an even older VooDoo 3 card
2005-02-04T08:25:00.000Z	ThreeShot	lanerebel	all I know is what i've done myself.  neither 2.4 series nor 2.6 series has trouble with an i810 chipset.  I know because when I used fedora I started with the 2.4 kernel then upgraded to 2.6 and neither had issues.
