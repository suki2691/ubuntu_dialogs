2007-03-29T16:13:00.000Z	screevo		I have copied the Ubuntu 6.06 LTS Server CD to /media/ubuntu. What do I add to /etc/apt/sources.list to use that DIR as a repository?
2007-03-29T16:14:00.000Z	jrib	screevo	you want to specifically use it from your HD?  You know that you can use it from the cd directly?
2007-03-29T16:15:00.000Z	jrib	screevo	why even use the cd instead of the online repositories?
2007-03-29T16:16:00.000Z	jrib	screevo	yes, and the repositories get security updates ;)
