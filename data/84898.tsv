2008-07-23T10:24:00.000Z	kev_		I've downloaded the new linux kernel .26 how do i now compile it?
2008-07-23T10:26:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	kev_	if i were me i would just wait until they come out with .26 in the repo. but when i compiled kernels for gentoo, i used genkernel (i think thats its name)
2008-07-23T10:26:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	kev_	then all i had to do was update GRUB and i was good to go
2008-07-23T10:28:00.000Z	debian_akroyd	kev_	genkernel is not in the repo. you will have tod wonload it from the web
