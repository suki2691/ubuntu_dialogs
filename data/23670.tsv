2010-10-22T10:47:00.000Z	Dreshin		so i was dinking around in my config options for 10.10(maverick) and i made the mistake of setting my login to console mode. and now i cant find how to change it back
2010-10-22T10:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dreshin	if you edit /etc/default/grub ,do you see the boot option: text ,in the quotes next to: quiet splash ?
2010-10-22T11:31:00.000Z	Dreshin	ActionParsnip	i dont think its a grub issue (admittedly noob) i still get my gui with mouse just no movable windows or the ability to have more than one thing open at a time
