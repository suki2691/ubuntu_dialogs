2007-02-07T11:33:00.000Z	onefish		hundreds of screensavers but no way to change their individual settings :(
2007-02-07T11:34:00.000Z	Madpilot	onefish	known bug in the gnomescreensaver app - the developer of which is a bit strange
2007-02-07T11:52:00.000Z	onefish	Jordan_U	madpilot: well that makes screensavers pretty much useless then, I really like to be able to change RSS options
2007-02-07T11:52:00.000Z	Madpilot	onefish	I know - like I said, the developer of gnome-screensaver is... odd. Jordan_U quoted him accurately
