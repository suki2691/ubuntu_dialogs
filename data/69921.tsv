2009-01-08T03:05:00.000Z	Aison		hello, when I install some dev packets with sudo apt-get build-dep vlc
2009-01-08T03:05:00.000Z	Aison		why are they removed with apt-get autoremove?
2009-01-08T03:06:00.000Z	jim_p	Aison	because that is what autoremove does
2009-01-08T03:07:00.000Z	Aison	jim_p	well, but when I install packets with apt-get install, those arent autoremoved
