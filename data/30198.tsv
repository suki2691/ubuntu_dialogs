2010-08-05T05:18:00.000Z	ndxtg		Hi I found this command: s/smthing/smthing2/g does anyone know what the /g thing is?
2010-08-05T05:18:00.000Z	bastidrazor	ndxtg	that means to do it globally. it will do it above where you're at in the file too. not just below
2010-08-05T05:18:00.000Z	ndxtg	bastidrazor	is there any "man" page for this ?
2010-08-05T05:19:00.000Z	bastidrazor	ndxtg	you're doing regular expressions. no man page that i know of.
