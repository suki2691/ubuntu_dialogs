2008-01-30T00:18:00.000Z	unop_	papiculo	XFS the file system?
2008-01-30T00:19:00.000Z	unop_	papiculo	well, it's nice and fast but not reliable - twice after upgrading my kernel, xfs modules werent loaded too, meaning i was left with half a filesystem
2008-01-30T00:20:00.000Z	unop_	papiculo	again, that was my experience, it does not speak for everyone else
