2012-06-20T03:47:00.000Z	AwaitingMahdi		I'm thinking to install ubuntu for my dad because his pc is a bit slow for windows 7. How would I install the hp printer software and the software for the graphics card?
2012-06-20T03:48:00.000Z	AwaitingMahdi		And what about the graphics card? ati radeon x1650 pro
2012-06-20T03:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	AwaitingMahdi	I would recommend using the drivers which are installed by default unless you actually have issues with them. If you want to install ATI's proprietary drivers you would use the "Additional Drivers" tool though.
