2010-10-09T04:46:00.000Z	whoever_		I'm looking for a software, which should play videos, and while this, I should can push some keys, and the time (in relation to the video), when I pushed the key, should be recorded. Knows anybody a software for that? (like: key a pushed on 0:35 and 0:50, key b at 0:20 und 0:42))
