2011-10-30T17:30:00.000Z	rns		I have 8 gigs of RAM - do I need the 64-bit version of Ubuntu to take advantage of all 8 gigs?
2011-10-30T17:30:00.000Z	llutz_	rns	yes
2011-10-30T17:31:00.000Z	rns	llutz	are there any known problems or hassles with the 64-bit version vs the 32-bit version?
2011-10-30T17:31:00.000Z	llutz_	rns	afaik no
