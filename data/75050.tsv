2008-11-11T08:26:00.000Z	Taza		I fear I accidentally *removed my kernel*. Help?
2008-11-11T08:26:00.000Z	Taza		Because grub boot options only show the memtest. Not rebooted yet after that.
2008-11-11T08:27:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	Taza	make sure linux-generic is installed
2008-11-11T08:27:00.000Z	Taza	zsquareplusc	It was not, after the update. WHAT'S GOING ON?!?
