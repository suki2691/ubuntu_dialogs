2006-09-27T10:13:00.000Z	SeraVitae		hi there
2006-09-27T10:14:00.000Z	SeraVitae		Im trying to install dapper on a 433mhz celeron with 192mb of ram, the live cd boots fine, but it is EXTREMELY slow to do anything, harddrive and cdrom are going full blast but i just chose english language for install and it's taking about 20 minutes and it's still sitting there.
2006-09-27T10:14:00.000Z	SeraVitae		is this because the pc is slow or do i have a faulty cd or something?
