2010-06-12T12:37:00.000Z	kazadagu		Hey all. I'm having major problems after doing an upgrade from 9.10 to 10.04. I was getting all sorts of weird things happening and now I get a blank screen when I start my machine up. I really could do with some help.

2010-06-12T12:39:00.000Z	kazadagu	gpled	black screen nothing shown
2010-06-12T12:39:00.000Z	gpled	kazadagu	if you hit ctrl + alt + f1 do you get anything?
