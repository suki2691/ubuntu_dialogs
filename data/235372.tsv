2005-08-04T07:23:00.000Z	Nate		I tried the Kubuntu amd64 live CD, but the computer locked right after loading the KDE background, can anyone help?
2005-08-04T07:25:00.000Z	Nate		It also happened with the Ubuntu amd64 LiveCD, right after the Ubuntu splash screen
2005-08-04T07:25:00.000Z	Nate		locked right up
2005-08-04T07:26:00.000Z	Madpilot	Nate	first question: the AMD64 machine works with another OS?
