2008-01-22T04:34:00.000Z	un0p	creature	let me guess -- debian packages are starting to get outdated? :)
2008-01-22T04:35:00.000Z	creature	un0p	Two things, really. More updated software in Ubuntu, and having tried to get MythTV to work in Debian I decided that there had to be a better way, a way where not everything with the computer was a fight. I thought Ubuntu was that way.
2008-01-22T04:36:00.000Z	un0p	creature	pretty much the same reason why i switched too
