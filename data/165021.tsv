2006-10-11T06:40:00.000Z	stjepan		I want to keep my ubuntu system up to date. I used archlinux till now. With archlinux I can keep my system up to date by using the "current" branch. SUSE can also be updated. Why ubuntu can't? I want GNOME 2.16, I want GTK 2.10, I want xorg 7.1 in my ubuntu...... can I somehow make my ubuntu system up-to-date???
