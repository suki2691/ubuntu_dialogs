2006-01-09T06:03:00.000Z	IgorVovchanchin		Can someone help me with problem considering compiling sources?
2006-01-09T06:04:00.000Z	IgorVovchanchin		I've done as the manual suggested, and ran ./configure in order to configure the compile, and then simply inputting "make" (as manual suggests), but it keeps yelling me something about "No makefile found", or "No rule to make file" or something
2006-01-09T06:05:00.000Z	IgorVovchanchin		after running the configures, it says at the bottom of the check list, that c++ compiler cannot make executables, and I've already installed gcc
2006-01-09T06:05:00.000Z	crimsun	IgorVovchanchin	you need to install 'build-essential'
