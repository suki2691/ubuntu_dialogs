2007-09-14T10:31:00.000Z	dpml		ok - with 1173 people here - maybe someone knows how to configure ubuntu fiesty to play off the rack DVDs - I've tried everything in the readme files, I've gone though all of the ubuntu forums and installed X, Y and Z - but MoviePlayer still puts up the less than helpful dialog - "Totem cannot play this type of media (DVD) because you do not have the appropriate plugins to handle it.".  Is there anyone out there who can help?
