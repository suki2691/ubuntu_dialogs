2005-03-21T11:05:00.000Z	freewoody		I have not been able to browse my Windows LAN since I upgrade to Hoary from Warty
2005-03-21T11:06:00.000Z	freewoody		So does somebody have a clue to what this means:  smb://192.168.55.11 is not a valid location in Nautilus ?
2005-03-21T11:08:00.000Z	foszae	freewoody	where are you getting that address from?
