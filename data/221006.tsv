2006-11-08T13:00:00.000Z	kmaynard	j0nas`	good for servers, sucky for desktops unless you run OS X, IMO
2006-11-08T13:02:00.000Z	j0nas`	kmaynard	64 bit processors are completely unsuitable to desktop workstations... do you think its unethical of the manufacturers to market them that way?
2006-11-08T13:02:00.000Z	kmaynard	j0nas`	depends on what the user needs...i'll stay 32 bit till the apps catch up
