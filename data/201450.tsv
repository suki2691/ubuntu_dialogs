2006-03-12T10:18:00.000Z	Coag		would anyone here possibly be able to help me with XGL
2006-03-12T10:18:00.000Z	Coag		I know the channel for it, but it's permanently dead pretty much
2006-03-12T10:18:00.000Z	Coag		been in it for three days now
2006-03-12T10:18:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	Coag	You should get better help on that in #ubuntu+1 - IIRC, Xgl is Dapper-only.
