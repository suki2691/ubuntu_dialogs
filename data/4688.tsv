2012-08-09T09:51:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	newbchessplayer	What's your problem? There's a chance I can't help, depending on what it is?
2012-08-09T09:52:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	newbchessplayer	I assume it's because Flash (on Linux especially) sucks.
2012-08-09T09:53:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	newbchessplayer	I've never had a lot of luck with Flash. I avoid it on Linux
