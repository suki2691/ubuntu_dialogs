2008-07-09T08:59:00.000Z	notaguest		Is there any reason why torrents would be slower in ubuntu than in windows. Tried Deluge and Transmission ports are forwarded and check fine. but I seem to max out at 10kb per torrent and about 80kb overall.
2008-07-09T09:01:00.000Z	notaguest		yep same torrents... I use dattebayo ones to test as DHT etal isn't a factor and they only use one tracker. It will max out my connection in windows but still slow in ubuntu
2008-07-09T09:01:00.000Z	notaguest		no speed limit has been set in deluge which i'm using atm
2008-07-09T09:02:00.000Z	shujah	notaguest	so you have forwarded ports on router and the ip is not being blocked by firewall or anything
