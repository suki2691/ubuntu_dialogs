2007-08-08T15:22:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	champlooo	i would guess it would be downloaded to /
2007-08-08T15:23:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	champlooo	why don't you try it out? something like "pwd > current_working_directory" as a cronjob :)
2007-08-08T15:25:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	champlooo	hang on, it's easy. whoever is in charge of the chronjob, so probably root. the file will be saved to his $HOME :)
