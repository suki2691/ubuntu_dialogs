2008-04-30T00:37:00.000Z	dudus		When I create a samba share using nautilus extension where the configuration goes? I supposed it would go into /etc/samba/smb.conf but they're not there
2008-04-30T00:38:00.000Z	redbox	dudus	check ~/.nautilus
2008-04-30T00:40:00.000Z	dudus	redbox	there's only messy xml files under .nautilus/metafiles and l saved-session files
2008-04-30T00:40:00.000Z	dudus	redbox	many saved-session files
