2006-11-05T10:41:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	lupine_85	a PST is a file that contains all the mail in ms outlook.
2006-11-05T10:42:00.000Z	lupine_85	DJAdmiral	there's a command called "readpst" that will do what you want
2006-11-05T10:43:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	lupine_85	Already tried that, but it doesn't work with Outlook 2003.
