2007-02-11T13:48:00.000Z	L4J		I have been in this channel for the last couple days... I was wondering, I downloaded and installed this program called "Frostwire" but when I try to open it from the Internet Sub-Menu, it just will not open.

2007-02-11T13:50:00.000Z	kenthomson	L4J	does "frostwi", then <tab> complete it to "frostwire" in the terminal, what do you get when you press enter after "frostwire" in terminal?
