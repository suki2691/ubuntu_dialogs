2007-06-06T13:27:00.000Z	spasticteapot	lemmingsrule	Generic Ubuntu would be fine.
2007-06-06T13:27:00.000Z	spasticteapot	lemmingsrule	Depends on your processor. Are you using a C2D or A64?
2007-06-06T13:27:00.000Z	spasticteapot	lemmingsrule	Yeah, 32 bit. Unless you're messing around with SPARCs, 32 bit is the way to go.
