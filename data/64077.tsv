2010-05-28T22:53:00.000Z	xangua	Christos	a lot, ubuntu comes with rhythmbox as default, banshee is also good
2010-05-28T22:54:00.000Z	xangua	Christos	i believe you can even use skins of winamp with audacios
2010-05-28T22:57:00.000Z	xangua	Christos	like i said, rhythmbox is the default music player in ubuntu, you will need to install gstreamer codecs or fluendo for mp3 support
