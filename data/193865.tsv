2006-09-21T09:42:00.000Z	Emigre		Hello.  I'm seriously interested in making a switch over on my main computer to Ubuntu linux but could use your advice and help before making the plunge.  Is this the right channel to ask for beginner help?
2006-09-21T09:44:00.000Z	Emigre		My big concern is that there's an open-source equivilant to all the programs that I want to use except for three that I can think of.  Is there a freeware Virtual Machine or something, where I can have access to a Windows session inside of Linux, and if so, does it run at near-full-speed?
2006-09-21T09:44:00.000Z	Emigre		I'm going to join #VMware in a moment then.
