2008-05-30T03:36:00.000Z	dmsuperman_		Can anybody help me figure out why it is that VLC and MPlayer won't output any sound for videos yet Movie Player will?
2008-05-30T03:36:00.000Z	miko__	dmsuperman_	movie player probably has your audio in use still
2008-05-30T03:37:00.000Z	dmsuperman_	miko__	Movie Player is closed...how can I tell it to release it?
2008-05-30T03:37:00.000Z	dmsuperman_	miko__	and why would exaile still work if that were the case?
