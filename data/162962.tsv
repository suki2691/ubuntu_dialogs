I was reading a while ago on how a guy had his comp setup as an wireless acces point (achieved) and he made it so when guests connected to it, theycould connect to internet, but he was middleman and used a prog to flip all images vertically. anyone know what command I would use for that? and also maybe what i would need to setup elsewhere?
