2008-11-12T01:38:00.000Z	swaj	OddlotX4	open a terminal and just type it's name.. for example "/media/blah.run" -- or if there are no execute permissions on the file, you can usually do "sh /media/blah.run"

2008-11-12T01:42:00.000Z	swaj	OddlotX4	try doing a "chmod +x /media/blah.run" first, and then run it just by calling it by name
