2006-06-25T11:50:00.000Z	daaku		i'm having this strange problem that my laptop running dapper suffers from this odd lag (in pretty much everthing - including doing something as simple as typing in a shell)
2006-06-25T11:52:00.000Z	daaku		another odd thing is that top shows pretty high user CPU usage, even though the process list when sorted by CPU usage doesnt show anything that high

2006-06-25T11:54:00.000Z	daaku	nf4	my clean boot uses less than 150mb :)
