2010-07-15T07:09:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	realubot	Each progressive version of gdm is progressively less secure than the previous version. Eventually, there will be no security at all. (That's a joke, mate)

2010-07-15T08:08:00.000Z	realubot	YankDownUnder	I'm a litte bit worried that I conpromise the security using multiseat.
