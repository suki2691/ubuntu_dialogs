2010-10-11T07:29:00.000Z	Xase		Alright, considering nobody has an answer, and I'm pretty sure there's no one scrolling up to read my old questions... "HOW do I FIX my Audio CD issue? Is there a way to dpkg-reconfigure way to set it up all over again? is there some way to just delete my drive and reinstall it... I don't care if it's arduous if you have instructions or at least correct mount points... or anything, I am not reinstalling. I have no way to back anything up."
