2010-12-18T22:18:00.000Z	kcorcoran_		i am running "make -j 3" no a flightgear v2.0...its working, however its taking some time...i assume this has to do with my CPU speeds...but would think it would compile faster.  shouldn't a dual core system blow throw this?
2010-12-18T22:19:00.000Z	yeats	kcorcoran_	compiling can take a *lot* of processor time - esp. if you're doing other things
2010-12-18T22:19:00.000Z	kcorcoran_	yeats	that makes sense, but even with a dual core system?
2010-12-18T22:20:00.000Z	yeats	kcorcoran_	depends on what it is ;-)
