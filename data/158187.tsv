2007-01-19T16:42:00.000Z	Slart		Got a question. if I mount a filesystem using sshfs twice (same command line, same location etc). Will I get 2 sshfs processes? or does it check for existing connections first? or will it fail because there is already a volume mounted on that mountpoint?
2007-01-19T16:44:00.000Z	Slart		I used the live cd.. but X is always a bit of a problem =)
2007-01-19T16:45:00.000Z	GaiaX11	Slart	Did you fix it? I mean the X problems?
2007-01-19T16:45:00.000Z	Slart	GaiaX11	yes.. it was nothing big.. but there are lots of small annoyances.. nothing that kept it from running
