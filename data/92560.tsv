2008-05-02T15:42:00.000Z	anteaya	black_ubuntu	yes I will have to do that but I am wondering if an install overwrote the file, I don't want to have to keep editing .bashrc
2008-05-02T15:45:00.000Z	anteaya	black_ubuntu	yes, that is good advice, but I am wondering if new installs have a habit of over-writing .bashrc, editing .bashrc requires a re-boot which is a pain when i am working
2008-05-02T15:49:00.000Z	black_ubuntu	anteaya	type sudo bash
