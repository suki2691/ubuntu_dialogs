2008-07-12T22:36:00.000Z	timsandtoms		I just installed 7.10, and installed the 288 updates for it... Now, at GRUB, I have a kernel somethingsomething.14 and a somethingsomething.15. Why? And can I remove the old one?

2008-07-12T22:40:00.000Z	atlef	timsandtoms	search for linux-image in synaptic
2008-07-12T22:45:00.000Z	atlef	timsandtoms	good you sorted it out
