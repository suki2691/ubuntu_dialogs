2007-04-20T06:38:00.000Z	kalikiana|d		I am trying to login to my ubuntu live cd from winxp. But I can not enter a user and a password, meaning I set a smbpasswd and but it is rejected.
2007-04-20T06:39:00.000Z	shadou	kalikiana|d	is samba up and running?
2007-04-20T06:39:00.000Z	kalikiana|d	shadou	I think so, yes. Only I cannot login.
2007-04-20T06:41:00.000Z	kalikiana|d	shadou	Any idea how to fix this?
