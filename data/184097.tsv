2006-06-05T05:11:00.000Z	_tacoman_		people don't seem to be responding to my boot question.  Is there a better place to ask it?
2006-06-05T05:11:00.000Z	_tacoman_		boot (kernal init) is getting stuck at "[4294668.257000]   ..TIMER: vector=0x31 apic1=0 pin1=2 apic2=-1 pin2=-1"
2006-06-05T05:12:00.000Z	_tacoman_		i took off the "silent" option
2006-06-05T05:12:00.000Z	skippy81	_tacoman_	 cant you boot with "noapic nolapic acpi=off" and see if that helps
