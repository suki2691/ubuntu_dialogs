2008-04-18T14:07:00.000Z	powertool08		i've got a ? for you, i want to install to a usb drive, i have my image, but i don't want to waste a cd for one install, is there anyway to install from the image?

2008-04-18T14:09:00.000Z	KrimZon	powertool08	but that's quite a long winded way, and can be a bit tricky
2008-04-18T14:12:00.000Z	KrimZon	powertool08	that might too, i don't know if installing and then effectively changing the hardware would cause significant problems
