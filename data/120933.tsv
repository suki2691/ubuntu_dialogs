2008-01-14T07:32:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	bkar	I'm still having the initial issue I described, defragging and making sure it wasn't compressed did nothing
2008-01-14T07:33:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	bkar	Let me copy paste: I installed ubuntu 7.10 several weeks ago using Wubi, it has been working well, however today it crashed, and when I tried to reboot I got the error, this all occurs before I even see the ubuntu loading bar: find --set-root --ignore-floppies /ubuntu/install/boot/grub/menu.lst Error 17: File not found, it then offers a prompt with a list of files, commandline, halt,...
2008-01-14T07:35:00.000Z	Alex_Gaynor	bkar	I don't believe so no, I'm not real sure how it works, but I have it running the same as normal
