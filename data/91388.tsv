2009-10-19T17:51:00.000Z	Prune		having a heck of a time finding a suitable editor.  nano is installed but won't run for some reason.  other two aren't quite to my taste.   is emacs suitable for non-programmers to use?
2009-10-19T17:51:00.000Z	Prune		 I want something that's like BBedit is over on the mac
2009-10-19T17:52:00.000Z	Prune		pico, I'll check
