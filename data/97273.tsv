2008-03-16T07:13:00.000Z	ccharles`	deuryte	I just use VLC from the repos. Nothing else needed :-).
2008-03-16T07:13:00.000Z	deuryte	ccharles`	yes, but to play store bought dvd, it takes 3 certain scripts to enable it
2008-03-16T07:14:00.000Z	ccharles`	deuryte	really? I watch commercial (region 1) movies all the time. Maybe I did something that I can't remember...
