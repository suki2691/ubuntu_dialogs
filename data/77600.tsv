2009-09-24T05:17:00.000Z	losher	DryGrain	do you know it's device name?
2009-09-24T05:17:00.000Z	losher	DryGrain	ok, open a terminal and type sudo fdisk -l (that's a lowercase L) and pastebin the output....
2009-09-24T05:23:00.000Z	losher	DryGrain	you installed ubuntu after windows I assume. Usually that preserves the windows installation. Are you sure it's gone? Can I see your sudo fdisk -l output?
