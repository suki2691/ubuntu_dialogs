2006-03-21T08:40:00.000Z	Frogzoo	FrdPrefct	gnome is the stock wm - so it's to be expected gnome is more polished
2006-04-24T10:41:00.000Z	Frogzoo	FrdPrefct	best bet would be gimp - but as to auto straightening - that's a big ask
2006-04-24T10:42:00.000Z	FrdPrefct	Frogzoo	autostraighten isn't a big deal... bu ti mean, in windows, when i use the HP crap... it'll crop off the empty space
