2006-12-12T10:05:00.000Z	AzMoo		Can anybody recommend a good bittorrent client? I like utorrent on Windows, but I haven't been able to find anything similar for Linux.
2006-12-12T10:07:00.000Z	L0cKd0wN	AzMoo	use wine to run utorrent
2006-12-12T10:08:00.000Z	AzMoo	L0cKd0wN	good call.
2006-12-12T10:17:00.000Z	AzMoo	L0cKd0wN	I'm having a bit of trouble getting it to run. Did you use the ubuntu version, or get it from the winehq repositories?
