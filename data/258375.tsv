I just downloaded hoary CD to install.. burned it from windows at 52x, which was probably a bad idea because i got an error when it was copying stuff.. sooo, now i can't boot into windows to re-burn it because it wiped out my MBR.. so, the question is, can i set up grub or some bootloader so i can boot into windows and reburn the CD?

2005-05-10T16:39:00.000Z	mackid		how do i set up grub without installing ubuntu?
