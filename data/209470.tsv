2006-12-05T15:59:00.000Z	Cat2		is EasyUbuntu too buggy?
2006-12-05T16:01:00.000Z	Cat2		thanks, i have been using EasyUbuntu already with no problems but it seems like most people suggest Automatix instead
2006-12-05T16:02:00.000Z	Cat2		oh no
2006-12-05T16:03:00.000Z	LjL	Cat2	i suggest that you just use the documentation. if you really want automation, though, i'd try easyubuntu over automatix
