2012-05-22T13:12:00.000Z	llutz	scheuri	apt-cache search pattern      or what do you look for?
2012-05-22T13:13:00.000Z	scheuri	llutz	well, as I said...with aptitude serach XYZ I was able to search the package database for XYZ...apt-get didnt have that and you are right...apt-cache is the keyword :)
