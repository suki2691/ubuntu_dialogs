2011-12-21T23:38:00.000Z	lukasoft		can someone help me install an ATI graphics driver? I've done it before on a different computer, however when I type "lspci -nn | grep VGA" I only get "01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: ATI Technologies Inc Device [1002:6779]"
2011-12-21T23:39:00.000Z	lukasoft		or at least give me some guidance on how to figure out what card i have?
2011-12-21T23:41:00.000Z	lukasoft		because all i care about is getting a widescreen resolutoin
2011-12-21T23:41:00.000Z	bean	lukasoft	using xrandr, etc will probably work
