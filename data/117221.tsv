2007-10-16T09:19:00.000Z	Fat_Ferret		thanks again guys- i was playing about freebsd
2007-10-16T09:21:00.000Z	Fat_Ferret		honestly ubuntu has been the best distro by far that i've ever used, I love freebsd tho I was a user in the mid 90s and I have a pc dedicated to it at my feet so I am trying to relearn alot of things in a short time. Right now I have 2 ubuntu pcs and 2 freebsds
2007-10-16T09:21:00.000Z	Intrepd	Fat_Ferret	i agree completely
