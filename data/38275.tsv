2010-01-27T08:53:00.000Z	redwoodsound	nn-olpc	thanks   but hibernate doesnt work   unless it is supposed to actually shut the computer off because thats what it does
2010-01-27T08:55:00.000Z	nn-olpc	redwoodsound	Yes hibernate is suposed to shut down the system .. it dump all the ram into swap then shuts off .. on boot up it reloades the drivers thus keeping ati working .. and then just loades the memory back out of swap
