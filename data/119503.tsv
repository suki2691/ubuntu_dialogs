2010-01-23T21:57:00.000Z	armenb		Hi I've got a really dumb question: Can someone give me a URL of an ubuntu 9.10 desktop ISO?
2010-01-23T21:57:00.000Z	armenb		the ubuntu.com webpage sucks and uses some awful redirection mechanism, which makes it hard for me to get the URL to paste to curl or wget.
2010-01-23T21:58:00.000Z	armenb		I want the URL of the ISO, not the download webpage.
2010-01-23T21:58:00.000Z	bazhang	armenb	hang on a second
