2011-04-10T04:58:00.000Z	CorpSamich		Hey guys, I need some help figuring out how to install my Geforce Nvidia GT220 Drivers when I'm using my Onboard Graphics to install, Got the .run, and for some reason it says 'Error: Nvidia installer must be run as root' when I try to run it in the terminal. Help?
