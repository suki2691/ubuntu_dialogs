I read on slashdot that feisty wouldn't have the 3d accelerated drivers by default for nvidia / ati for beryl / AIGLX, does that mean that restricted-modules won't include the nvidia drivers anymore? or just that it won't be default?

2007-02-24T07:28:00.000Z	mjr	skel	(incidentally, "accelerated" != "proprietary"; many Radeons are accelerated with the free drivers already)
2007-02-24T07:28:00.000Z	skel	mjr	right, bad wording on my part.
