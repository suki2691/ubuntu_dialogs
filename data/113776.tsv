2007-12-29T04:25:00.000Z	k3ito		can anyone tell me of a media player that lets me browse my music by artwork for linux?
2007-12-29T04:26:00.000Z	Gnea	k3ito	i think amarok does it
2007-12-29T04:26:00.000Z	k3ito	Gnea	is there any way to have amarok store the artwork downlaoded by the cover manager in the relevant folder and not in it's own unique database backend!
2007-12-29T04:27:00.000Z	Gnea	k3ito	that's an amarok issue, ask them
