2008-01-09T02:16:00.000Z	Fingel		Hey guys, Im running ubuntu at my house at home, and I SSH to it with putty from my laptop at school, how can I launch GUI applications on the ubuntu computer at home on an xsession that I know is running?
2008-01-09T02:17:00.000Z	th0r	Fingel	you have several options...you can use vnc, do X forwarding through ssh, or use NX
