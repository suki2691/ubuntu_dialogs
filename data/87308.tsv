2008-07-19T04:48:00.000Z	__yy		Hi all, I installed flashplugin-nonfree in an attempt to make flash use less cpu. Now I get no sound with flash with or without flashplugin-nonfree installed. What have I done?????
2008-07-19T04:49:00.000Z	Baughn	__yy	The nonfree plugin does /not/ use less cpu, either
2008-07-19T04:50:00.000Z	__yy	Baughn	yes, I've noticed that
2008-07-19T04:50:00.000Z	Baughn	__yy	Oh, but you might try dpkg --purge flashplugin-nonfree
