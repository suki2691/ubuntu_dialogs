2006-06-08T09:12:00.000Z	KenSentMe	tempered	it should be in localhost/phpmyadmin i think
2006-06-08T09:14:00.000Z	tempered	KenSentMe	http://127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin isn't working ( or various casings of that too, phpMyAdmin, etc ).  But php is working and it's a LAMP install.  Where else could I check?
2006-06-08T09:16:00.000Z	KenSentMe	tempered	when you go to localhost, what do you see?
