2010-10-09T17:33:00.000Z	Moopz		Hey. I was wondering if anyone knew how to run .jar files? Ubuntu just opens it as if it was a compressed file.
2010-10-09T17:34:00.000Z	Moopz		Tried that already, doest't work
2010-10-09T17:34:00.000Z	pksadiq	Moopz	 or right click on file and open with Java runtime
2010-10-09T17:35:00.000Z	Moopz	pksadiq	doesn't work either. Tried with both Sun and OpenJDK
