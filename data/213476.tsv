2007-08-21T16:47:00.000Z	tjedi		i have a problem with preparing partitions for gutsy-installation. 80gb should be 10gb / 4gb /swap and the rest for /home. but the rest for the home-partition is shown as unusable - why???
2007-08-21T16:48:00.000Z	tjedi		<IndyGunFreak>: i read it would be a good idea - what can i do than ...?
