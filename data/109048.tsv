2008-07-08T06:02:00.000Z	joshual		is there anyway to remove something like eyeofgnome without removing ubuntu-desktop package?
2008-07-08T06:02:00.000Z	FAJALOU	joshual	 you should be able to just go sudo apt-get remove eyeofgnome
2008-07-08T06:04:00.000Z	joshual	FAJALOU	apt-get wants to remove ubuntu-desktop
2008-07-08T06:04:00.000Z	FAJALOU	joshual	 then go into synaptic, and see if it will let you remove it from there w/o that
