2005-12-17T17:43:00.000Z	Naxcon		all im trying to do is copy a file into the modules folder and i keep getting stupid permission denied errors. PLEASE someone tell me what to do... im pretty sure it has something to do with all this sudo crap but i cannot figure out how to get that to work???
2005-12-17T08:06:00.000Z	Naxcon		will someone give me the command to change the permissions on a file to allow everyone to do everything?
2005-12-17T08:06:00.000Z	intelikey	Naxcon	chmod 777 file
2005-12-17T08:07:00.000Z	intelikey	Naxcon	 man chmod
