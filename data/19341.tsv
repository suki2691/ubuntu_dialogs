2011-07-31T20:12:00.000Z	ThinkT510	timepilot	do you require any support?
2011-07-31T20:13:00.000Z	ThinkT510	timepilot	you could give xfce a try
2011-07-31T20:15:00.000Z	ThinkT510	timepilot	i don't use unity and rather wouldn't but this is a support channel, if you came to just complain take it to #ubuntu-offtopic
