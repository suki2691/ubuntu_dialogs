2007-12-16T23:52:00.000Z	ubuntu		Hey, I'm running from a livecd right now. I can't make my drive to eject. I'd like to insert another cd. Unmounting didn't help. Is it possible ?
2007-12-16T23:53:00.000Z	ubuntu		What if I booted ubuntu from USB (possible ?) ?
2007-12-16T23:55:00.000Z	ubuntu		I have annoying problem, on Asus P5K SE it doesn't recognize my dvd drive. Neither Debian nor Ubuntu boots from cd properly, except Kubuntu reacts to generic.all_generic_ide=1
