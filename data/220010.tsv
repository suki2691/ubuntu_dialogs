2008-01-11T16:00:00.000Z	Flannel	roky	Yeah, I misspoke.  Its not an issue, just a packaging issue (now that I actually read the website).  Should be fixed soon enough.
2008-01-11T16:02:00.000Z	Flannel	roky	Well, there is a fix, but its a manual one and can cause issues with future upgrades if done improperly
