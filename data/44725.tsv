2009-11-06T18:45:00.000Z	IHS_Volunteer		I have 4GB of RAM in my main desktop. I rarely touch the swap, unless I'm running a lot of browsers that have memory leaks(firefox..)
2009-11-06T18:45:00.000Z	eurythmia	IHS_Volunteer	heh ... firefox was the only thing that ever made my memory usage go over 512M ;)
2009-11-06T18:45:00.000Z	IHS_Volunteer	eurythmia	I had firefox using a little over 1GB of RAM the other day :D
2009-11-06T18:46:00.000Z	eurythmia	IHS_Volunteer	yeah ... that's the biggest problem about firefox ... it'd be nice if they could start fixing those bugs instead of adding new features.
