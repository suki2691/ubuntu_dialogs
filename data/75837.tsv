2009-09-27T21:35:00.000Z	Roasted		What happens in the background of Linux when you use two GUI's to edit the Samba config file at one time? I did that yesterday and it messed up my user account to the point that deleting and re-adding din't even help. I had to completely remove Samba from synaptic and re-install then re-import my smb.conf file to get it to work again. I can see what I did wrong - but I'm trying to understand what happened in the background. Any ideas?
