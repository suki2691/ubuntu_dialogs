2006-08-22T16:33:00.000Z	profoX`	lamego	i'm just discussing it, and if you don't like that, just /ignore
2006-08-22T16:33:00.000Z	lamego	profoX`	no really, this is a support related channel, and you are not supporting neither asking for support, so you are disturbing the channel, the same way the maintainter disturbed you with the upgrade
2006-08-22T16:35:00.000Z	profoX`	lamego	it's support if I warn people not to upgrade xserver-xorg-core from dapper-updates yet. It's sound advice.
