2010-01-18T04:01:00.000Z	chrisf1		I'm running an old version of the ubuntu server (8.04) and I would like to upgrade to latest. Running update-manager does not give me the option to do a dist-upgrade. What's the best way to get updated? Thanks!
2010-01-18T04:03:00.000Z	chrisf1		How do I do that? I want a clean way to upgrade version->version
2010-01-18T04:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	chrisf1	8.04 --> 8.10 --> 9.04 --> 9.10
2010-01-18T04:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	chrisf1	or wait until april and do 8.04 --> 10.04
