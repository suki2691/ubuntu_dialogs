2010-05-23T00:49:00.000Z	emorris		hi, I'm trying to put together a video using PiTiVi, however, a video clip is in an unsupported format. What's the best way to convert this to a usable one? I've tried vlc and mencoder but then just produce broken, unusable results. Thanks in advance
2010-05-23T00:50:00.000Z	Loshki	emorris	what format is the video clip in, then?
