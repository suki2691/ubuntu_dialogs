2011-10-28T22:49:00.000Z	escott	Cong	64bit vs 32bit processor types
2011-10-28T22:52:00.000Z	escott	Cong	if "cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep flags | grep lm" prints out lines that begin with "flags " then it is a 64bit processor, and you might want to download the 64bit install disk
2011-10-28T22:57:00.000Z	escott	Cong	yes. lm mode flag for the processors = 64bit
