2009-07-17T05:58:00.000Z	rfm		Is there something I can put in a gnome panel that displays the local host name?  I have two jaunty machines on a kvm switch and it's sometimes hard to tell where I am....

2009-07-17T06:03:00.000Z	rfm	jrib	trouble is I'm not on either of them enough to remember which theme is which; n2diy: trouble is I ssh between them often, and have the prompt wired to set the window title to the ssh'ed to.  I think what I'll do is just make wallpaper images consisting of the name repeated over and over again, like TV talking head backdrops
