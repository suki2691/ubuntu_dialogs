2011-10-16T07:25:00.000Z	bluMyst		I need some help. I just installed 11.10 and when I try to log in it either goes back to the login screen or freezes, forcing me to reboot depending on who I try to log in as. What's going on and how do I fix it?

2011-10-16T07:27:00.000Z	bluMyst	yeats	I'll try that, but I'm going to have to reboot this PC to do it since I'm live booting. I'll be back if it doesn't work. Thanks!
2011-10-16T07:27:00.000Z	yeats	bluMyst	sure
