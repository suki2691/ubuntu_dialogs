2012-03-21T12:04:00.000Z	roy_m		Hi, I am writing a intro how to lab for snort. I have installed everything nicely and it appears to be working as it is generating logs when I portscan using nmap. Can anyone suggest and simple apt-get install type utilities for ubuntu that will run random hacks. I really just want to generate a whole bunch of different alerts on my snort IDS. Thanks

2012-03-21T12:06:00.000Z	roy_m	collinjsimpson	Yeah, I know but it is a 2 hour lab tutorial and backtrack takes time to install on ubuntu...
2012-03-21T12:07:00.000Z	roy_m	collinjsimpson	maybe I will just use a backtrack live cd
