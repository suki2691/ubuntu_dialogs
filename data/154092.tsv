2007-04-10T08:51:00.000Z	kkerwin	Molli	I like kontact because I use KDE, and it has KDE integration.
2007-04-10T08:51:00.000Z	kkerwin	Molli	Others like evolution for its gnome integration.
2007-04-10T08:54:00.000Z	kkerwin	Molli	If you're looking to sync with a palm pilot, then try either evolution or kontact. I know that they have connectors for those.
