2007-11-18T05:22:00.000Z	felipe_	bucky1	I think that you could find some information there
2007-11-18T05:24:00.000Z	bucky1	felipe_	yes thanks, I know I could get it there but i was just using firefox as an example.  I would also like to know a way that works for apps that dont list it in the 'about'
2007-11-18T05:24:00.000Z	felipe_	bucky1	ok. sorry. :)
