2005-10-16T13:44:00.000Z	Jaivaz		I just rebooted after the upgrade to Breezy and I have a problem with my moniter. The screen loads completely except that it's at least one inch to the left.. so the far right is literally completely black.

2005-10-16T13:46:00.000Z	foXgamer	Jaivaz	I has the same problem yesterday!
