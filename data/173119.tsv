2007-10-03T14:24:00.000Z	sachac		I'm trying to upgrade dapper to feisty in preparation for moving to gutsy, but update-manager -c can't guess the meta-package and wants me to install ubuntu-desktop, edubuntu-desktop, or kubuntu-desktop. As I don't want to install a gazillion things, would it be kosher to make an equivalent package using equivs and trick my system?
