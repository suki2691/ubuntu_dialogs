2007-10-03T05:02:00.000Z	chrono13		I installed Ubuntu 7.10 on my Dell 700m laptop today. I performed a full update. My resolution is detected incorrectly, and xorg is using vesa instead of the Intel drivers. How do I change this (I eventually want to have the special effects turned on). I need to change from vesa to intel and correct the resolution (xorg doesn't seem to have any listed resolutions like it normally does).
