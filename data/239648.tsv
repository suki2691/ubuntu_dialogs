2007-02-01T17:24:00.000Z	TTT_Travis		can I take my hard drive with ubuntu on it and put it in another computer with different hardware?
2007-02-01T17:24:00.000Z	TTT_Travis		or will I get driver issues?
2007-02-01T17:26:00.000Z	TTT_Travis	TTT_Travis	good, since it's a server install anyway, no Xorg
2007-02-05T17:47:00.000Z	TTT_Travis	TTT_Travis	the different computer has no os, just the ubuntu server one off the hard drive I just put in it
