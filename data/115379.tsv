2008-04-26T09:40:00.000Z	Shpoo1		Ugh, talk about a bad upgrade experience. Update-manager closed suddenly mid-upgrade, now I've got 38 broken packages and it won't let me finish the update. Time for the torrents!
2008-04-26T09:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Shpoo1	what does `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade` give you?
2008-04-26T09:43:00.000Z	Shpoo1	Flannel	update just lists the repos, and dist-upgrade shows a list of broken packages and unmet dependencies
2008-04-26T09:45:00.000Z	Shpoo1	Flannel	I tried dist-upgrade -f, and it says libao2 is missing final newline. All seems related to open office.
