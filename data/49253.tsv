2009-11-04T15:45:00.000Z	Hagus		I have used sudo apt-get autoremove php5 but when I do php -v it shows up as PHP 5.3.2-dev (cli).  How do I get rid of php so that I can do a clean install of php5.x ?
2009-11-04T15:45:00.000Z	mr_mojo	Hagus	apt-get autoremove php5-cli should work
2009-11-04T15:46:00.000Z	Hagus	mr_mojo	You are a saint!
2009-11-04T15:49:00.000Z	mr_mojo	Hagus	so you removed php5-cli and that's still there? hmm...
