2009-11-19T23:00:00.000Z	brooksaar		Hey guys. Trying to get SSH port forwarding working via IPTables. Aka. ExternalIP:4852 forwards to 10.0.0.1:22. Current command: http://paste.ubuntu.com/322574/ where 10.1.1.2 is the gateway's IP on eth0, and 10.0.0.1 is the gateway's IP on eth1. Router is forwarding ALL ports to 10.1.1.2
