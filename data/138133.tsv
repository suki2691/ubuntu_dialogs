2009-02-27T10:42:00.000Z	plazia		in gnome nautilus allows me to mount my ntfs drive by clicking on it's icon (957 Gb) media or what not. I want to know the script/command nautilus executes so I can do it in XFCE? Can anyone help me with that?
2009-02-27T10:43:00.000Z	usser	plazia	mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sd[your partition name] /media/windows
