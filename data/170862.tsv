2007-02-13T08:10:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Bourne	I've felt the same thing over time. However, there are alternatives oO XFCE is good, and fluxbox is too. Running GTK apps under these does good (to my PC at least)
2007-02-13T08:10:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Bourne	It is - until you install stuff and stuff :P
2007-02-13T08:11:00.000Z	DARKGuy	Bourne	XFCE shall do good - it has a plugin to load some Gnome applets in case you miss osme of them :P
