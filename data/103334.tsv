2008-05-04T21:47:00.000Z	jim_beam	Bizzeh	I have have 3 sata drives each with an operating system setup as a a primary drive.  I started with xp as the only drive.  purchased 2 more 500gb satas.  I unplugged and installed vista on a clean primary drive.  I unplugged vista and installed ubuntu 7.10 as a clean primary drive.  It;s an od setup because my boot drive is XP and vista BCD looks works off a primary drive.  When all were plugged in is used bcdedit to add entries for ubuntu.
