2011-10-25T23:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	p1ruj3	why would you want to? It all goes to the same usb subsystem
2011-10-25T23:18:00.000Z	p1ruj3	ActionParsnip	usb to usb file transfer pulling 12 mbit, want to see if I can move one device to a seperate bus and have that transfer speed be more around 20-24
2011-10-25T23:20:00.000Z	p1ruj3	ActionParsnip	right? in theory it's sharing bandwidth between those devices on the same bus/hub
