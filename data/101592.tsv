2008-02-01T08:56:00.000Z	neald		Hey all, I'm trying to install xubuntu via a partion from another linux system.  I mounted the image, copied all the contents to a partition, set grup to boot to that drive, I get a boot, but I get an error (kernel panic) on the loading of scripts and it kills init.  Anyone know off hand what I did wrong?

2008-02-01T08:58:00.000Z	neald	cellofellow	yes, I copied the image, mounted it, then copied its contents to a ~750mb partition, then set grup to load that partition.
