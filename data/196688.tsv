2009-08-06T01:12:00.000Z	HarrisonF		I upgraded from 8.04 to 8.10 (in preparation to get to 9.04) and now my keyboard/mouse do not work at gdm, it does work to switch to a different console using ctrl+alt+f1 and then when i restart gdm, it works fine when I switch back, any ideas?

2009-08-06T01:13:00.000Z	HarrisonF	hackel	okay, this happens everytime i reboot, i need to restart gdm and then it works fine, i guess i could hold my breath and just upgrade to 9.04 and hope it starts working ;)
2009-08-06T01:15:00.000Z	HarrisonF	hackel	okay, guess i will do that, hope it works out =)
