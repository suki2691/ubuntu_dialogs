2009-04-07T17:42:00.000Z	Boohbah	QaDeS	well you need jackd, among other things, probably also want qjackctl
2009-04-07T17:44:00.000Z	Boohbah	QaDeS	see full requirements at http://qtractor.sourceforge.net/qtractor-index.html
2009-04-07T17:47:00.000Z	QaDeS	Boohbah	well, i technically got it running, but sometimes the midi input lags about 1-2 seconds and sometimes jack merely crashes
