2007-01-26T12:34:00.000Z	cablesm102	AmbientMstr	yes. Download the GParted LiveCD (google it). That's the easiest way. Back up first though.
2007-01-26T12:35:00.000Z	AmbientMstr	cablesm102	Of course I'd back up. I just think I made a mistake last night and need to make my Windows partition a lil bigger.
