2009-05-29T10:12:00.000Z	panzor	jamiejackson	that's how linux distros do it that I've been a part of. hda is ide, sda is sata
2009-05-29T10:13:00.000Z	panzor	jamiejackson	I don't see the point
2009-05-29T10:14:00.000Z	jamiejackson	panzor	the point of hd* becoming sd* for IDEs? i dunno, i didn't write it ;-)
