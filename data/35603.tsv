2010-09-05T10:10:00.000Z	Tobarja		can someone suggest where i can look to figure out why one of my user accounts has a different TERMINFO than another account? (one acts wierd in screen and the other works)
2010-09-05T10:11:00.000Z	matrixblue	Tobarja	~/.bash_profile
2010-09-05T10:14:00.000Z	Tobarja	matrixblue	the working user has no .bash_profile. I just rm'ed the other out of the way, relogged and they still are different
2010-09-05T10:15:00.000Z	matrixblue	Tobarja	look for a .profile or .bash_login
