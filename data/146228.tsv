2007-12-20T13:40:00.000Z	balleyne	newbie-ubu	Dapper is old, but it's still supported. What are you trying to do? Update the listings from the repositories, or add a new repository?
2007-12-20T13:45:00.000Z	balleyne	newbie-ubu	/etc/apt/sources.list - you can tell it to look at whatever repositories you want, is that what you're trying to do?
