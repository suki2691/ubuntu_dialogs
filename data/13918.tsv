2011-08-04T21:11:00.000Z	wols_	Hyperbyte	both, flgrx and the xorg ati driver support your card just fine
2011-08-04T21:16:00.000Z	wols_	Hyperbyte	possibly. grub video and kernel video have nothing to do with each other
2011-08-04T21:16:00.000Z	Hyperbyte	wols_	well, they both don't show text during boot.  If I press ctrl+alt+f2 after it's booted I get all my text fine.
