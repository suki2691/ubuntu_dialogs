2008-04-25T03:48:00.000Z	blbrown		I am getting can't update errors, should I wait or is something else going on.  Is anyone else able to easily upgrade?

2009-04-28T05:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	blbrown	well, the cd is probably faster, and you don't have to worry about what happens if for some reason your internet connection goes down
2009-04-28T05:41:00.000Z	blbrown	IndyGunFreak	well I did all three to the same machine.  After I did the CD, I did apt-get upgrade and it took a really long time.  I just did apt-get dist-upgrade and installed about 100MB of stuff
