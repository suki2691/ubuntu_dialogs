2005-11-16T06:02:00.000Z	aurora		i typed "chown -R username:username ~/.*" as root (where "username" is my regular account) and EVERYTHING broke, i would have thought it could at worst have made some hidden files in /root/ owned by the wrong account, but everything seemed to be playing up and the command seemed to run forever, which scared me enough to terminate it early
2005-11-16T06:03:00.000Z	aurora		have i completly stuffed my breezy installation?
