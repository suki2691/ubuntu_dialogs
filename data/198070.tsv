2006-02-23T13:10:00.000Z	TuxOtaku		so, can anyone help me with GNOME?
2006-02-23T13:10:00.000Z	iGad_bigdisk_	TuxOtaku	what's the prob?
2006-02-23T13:20:00.000Z	iGad_bigdisk_	TuxOtaku	I would try messing with NTFS on ubuntu or any other linux... it's all very 'testing / unstable'
2006-02-23T13:21:00.000Z	iGad_bigdisk_	TuxOtaku	try a windows-based resque disk instead
