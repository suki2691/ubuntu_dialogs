2007-12-30T20:03:00.000Z	cornell		Is there a way I can configure wine without running wincfg?
2007-12-30T20:04:00.000Z	Tilllinux	cornell	edit the .reg files in the .wine folder
2007-12-30T20:08:00.000Z	Tilllinux	cornell	but why would you want to edit it manually? if wine is not starting, remove it completely with synaptics and then remove the .wine folder and do a clean install
2007-12-30T20:08:00.000Z	Tilllinux	cornell	visit #winehq for more information :)
