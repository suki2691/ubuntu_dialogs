2010-05-07T03:35:00.000Z	JoshDreamland		can I check the ISO from a working Karmic with a hash?
2010-05-07T03:36:00.000Z	JoshDreamland		Let me rephrase, where do I get the hash to check it, and then how do I check it?
2010-05-07T03:38:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	JoshDreamland	 The linked page has all the hashes and links to instructions on how to check them
