2007-08-16T06:17:00.000Z	Hairulfr		Anyone had the problems with windows "locking" NTFS partitions that aren't shut down properly? I was cursing ubuntu to hell for not auto mounting until I tried myself and found that windows actually "made them" inaccessible. So now I gotta "Shut down" or "restart", no more resetting. Boring

2007-08-16T06:20:00.000Z	faileas	Hairulfr	there's a good reason for that ;p
