2006-09-19T07:37:00.000Z	der0b	mikbrent	ask and we'll answer if we can
2006-09-19T07:42:00.000Z	der0b	mikbrent	you are running that command with sudo right?  otherwise, I don't actually see anything wrong with it
2006-09-19T07:42:00.000Z	der0b	mikbrent	the only thing I would change is smbfs to cifs
