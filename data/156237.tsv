2007-02-05T09:52:00.000Z	The_Machine		I want to remove captive NTFS from my operating system.  I don't know how though.  Could someone *please* help me?  It's killing the performance of the OS.

2007-02-05T09:55:00.000Z	genii	The_Machine	Nevermind, just looked it up, read write NTFS package. If you installed it by deb package just do apt-get remove --purge <exact package name here>
2007-02-05T09:58:00.000Z	genii	The_Machine	:) cool. Like a name you have on the tip of your tongue then it comes to you
