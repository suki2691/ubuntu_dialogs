2010-06-03T15:29:00.000Z	ZachK_	FullFlannelJacke	delete Rhythmbox and re-install it
2010-06-03T15:30:00.000Z	FullFlannelJacke	ZachK_	Already did it..Didnt help..I even searched my /home directory for all rhythmbox files and deleted all of those too
2010-06-03T15:30:00.000Z	ZachK_	FullFlannelJacke	hmmm weird
