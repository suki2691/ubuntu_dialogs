2004-10-20T06:52:00.000Z	agraupe		I can't install the gnome-theme-extras package... even in the universal repository it doesn't seem to exist
2004-10-20T06:53:00.000Z	steveod	agraupe	is it gnome-themes-extras
2004-10-20T07:23:00.000Z	steveod	agraupe	libquicktime0 or something like that
2004-10-20T07:24:00.000Z	agraupe	steveod	is there a metapackage that would install a bunch of codecs?
