2010-04-12T03:53:00.000Z	bribroder	JenniferB	you won't have the option of OS X unless you get a mac, but you can install windows, ubuntu, whatever on the mac
2010-04-12T03:56:00.000Z	bribroder	JenniferB	it's a unix OS, so it uses the same structure, but you'll find some commands missing if you're used to ubuntu
