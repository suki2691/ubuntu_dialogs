2007-07-07T15:07:00.000Z	Max01		can anyone help me on this? in ubuntu ive mapped a share on a windows pc with my mp3s. the icon on the desktop is fine and i can browse the share and copy / paste files onto the desktop etc. I CANT however go into a program and find the share to say add the files into xmms or my ipod. (ive looked under /mnt and /media) can anyone help as i dont want to drag 100gig across my network so i can play mp3s
2007-07-07T15:08:00.000Z	Max01		it says it is mounted on the icon
2007-07-07T15:08:00.000Z	Max01		as it says unmount
