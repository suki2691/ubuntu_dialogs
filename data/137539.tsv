2007-04-21T05:26:00.000Z	robbie_crash		I am missing one hard drive from my fstab, it's listed, but apparently its uuid and dev/* have changed since upgrading so it will no longer mount. How can I determine what it is, when it doesn't show up in gparted, and I can't open hardware information  because it crashes as soon as I load it up. I have two questions: 1) how can I figure out what the drive is now, and 2) how can I fix the crashing with hardware information?
