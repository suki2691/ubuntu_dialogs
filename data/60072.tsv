2012-07-29T01:56:00.000Z	SockPants	bekks	yup, coming up, sorry. I copied a windows 7 ntfs partition from one drive to the next using gparted, and it was succesful, however it won't boot. First it stuck with a blinking cursor, so I used gparted to set the 'boot' flag. Now it says 'bootmgr is missing'. Is there a way to fix this problem using my ubuntu live usb drive? my pc doesn't have an optical drive so windows recovery is difficult.
