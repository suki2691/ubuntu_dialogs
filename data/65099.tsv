2010-07-25T07:41:00.000Z	slim	ZykoticK9	thx but it says to add this to fstab: `/dev/sdd1 /media/usbstick vfat user,umask=000,utf8,flush,noauto 0 0`, but can i make ntfs use umask=000 as default for all drives, not just the ones the explicitly specify?
2010-07-25T07:42:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	slim	i'm sorry i don't use FAT/NTFS for hardly anything sorry.  i really don't know.
