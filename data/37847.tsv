2010-02-07T15:19:00.000Z	q0k		hi! http://paste.ubuntu.com/370847/ is a practical Question. Could you please do it? (I'm not an Ubuntu user yet)
2010-02-07T15:19:00.000Z	rww	q0k	I'm pretty sure that if you delete a file in nautilus over the network, it pops up a warning saying that it can't move it to trash and will actually delete it.
2010-02-07T15:20:00.000Z	q0k	rww	is it from your experience?
2010-02-07T15:20:00.000Z	rww	q0k	that's from deleting files accessed through Nautilus's ssh support. I don't know if whatever protocol you're talking about does the same.
