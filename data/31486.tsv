2010-05-21T14:21:00.000Z	Lillymon		I've got a webcam with integrated microphone. VLC is asking me what the audio device name is. I have no idea. Does anyone else have any idea where ALSA has decided would be logical?

2010-05-21T14:22:00.000Z	Lillymon	mikeplus64	All that does is give me the model of the camera and 'USB Mixer', like everything else on my system.
2010-05-21T14:24:00.000Z	mikeplus64	Lillymon	I'm not sure then, though there is probably a way check. Trial and error in VLC maybe?
