2006-06-22T13:59:00.000Z	Steff_breezy		Hi, I ordered an AMD 64 3200 CPU and a new board, do I have to use the 64 Bit version of ubuntu, or can I install my normal breezy cd again?
2006-06-22T14:00:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Steff_breezy	Yes you can. You won't take advantage of the 64bits of your  architecture but that wont be much of a problem, considering that x86 is more stable than amd-64 ...
2006-06-22T14:01:00.000Z	Steff_breezy	Frogzoo	holycow_ , neutrinomass : ok, thats fine. but I guess I have to do a reinstall after the board change?
2006-06-22T14:01:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Steff_breezy	AFAIK no, it won't be necessary ...
