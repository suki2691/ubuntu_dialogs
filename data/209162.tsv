2005-11-01T11:05:00.000Z	themikester60		 I've got a question for everyone in here, for my business I've been provided the task of setting up some sort of managed password facilities that must be secure, I was thinking perhaps just using a very streamlined and hardened linux box to host the passwords but this seems like a threat in itself should the server be compromised, how does everyone in here keep track of their passwords securely?
2005-11-01T11:06:00.000Z	themikester60		hrdwrbob, yes I know this, but I need a means of collecting all of our passwords in one place because we have like 30+ between all the employees, and having it so that they can retreive their password if they forget or need access to a particular resource

2005-11-01T11:07:00.000Z	themikester60	dougsk	I'm not really sure on that, let me look those up real quick because I've never heard of either of those products
