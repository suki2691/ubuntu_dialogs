2011-02-10T05:26:00.000Z	ariaxu		Fullscreen flash video is really flickery under Compiz, but smooth as butter without it. Is there any solution to this?
2011-02-10T05:27:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ariaxu	no, compositing tends to mess up other rendering done by the gpu
2011-02-10T05:27:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ariaxu	until someone can find a workaround for compiz
2011-02-10T05:28:00.000Z	ariaxu	aeon-ltd	thanks, figured as much.
