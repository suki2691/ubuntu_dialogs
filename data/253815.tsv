2010-02-21T07:05:00.000Z	ryan_	sludge	Are you trying to change his login password...?
2010-02-21T07:08:00.000Z	sludge	ryan_	I do not want to change login password....I just want the keyring to be the same password.  However, I think my friend F'ed it up and can't remember what he put in there for keyring password because he gets caught in a loop where it asks for keyring, he enters login, but it keeps asking again and again
