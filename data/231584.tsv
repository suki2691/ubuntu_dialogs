2005-10-04T12:27:00.000Z	vladuz976	robitaille	already saw that. didn't work for me. kept getting errors. plus it doesn't use fetchmail the guide only shows how to have mutt directly use pop
2005-10-04T12:28:00.000Z	robitaille	vladuz976	 you use fetchmail?  Then you don't need to use pop in mutt since your mail will be in a local folder
2005-10-04T12:28:00.000Z	vladuz976	robitaille	i guess then i need a guide on fetchmail
