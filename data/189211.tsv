2006-04-27T14:29:00.000Z	|lostbyte|	amandah	then i think the source yourtrying to make does'nt have make. or you got to ./configure first.
2006-04-27T14:35:00.000Z	amandah	|lostbyte|	I'm new to linux, was reading the Ubuntu wiki and I'm confused about what./configure does.  But in any case I'm not compiling someone else's source: I'm trying to compile my code from a Makefile I wrote and the terminal complains that bash doesn't recognize "make" as a command
