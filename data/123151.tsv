2007-09-03T05:16:00.000Z	baubles	boyam	But Ubuntu just uses sudo. And that, with sudoers, is configurable. I just don't know how or if it's possible to do it the way I'm thinking of

2007-09-03T05:19:00.000Z	boyam	baubles	I can't think of a way to do it out side of creating your own security model with ubuntu or another distro.....at that point it may be hard to get support since you will  be the only one with that model....
