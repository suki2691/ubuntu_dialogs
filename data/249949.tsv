2008-11-17T06:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cjeans	 yes. it works very well.
2008-11-17T06:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cjeans	 you can even isntall the nvidia drivers and stuff to it.. but i had to tweak it a little to get them working with it.
2008-11-17T06:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cjeans	 i find it works better then netbootin.. makes the thumbdrive faster.. and does a persistant mode/feature.. :)
