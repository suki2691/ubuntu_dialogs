2012-01-19T12:55:00.000Z	tawm_	kilmickey	hrm well i know whenever I need to muck with my display settings I usually have to 1)make the conflicting file xorg.conf not exist anymore (usually i mv xorg.conf xorg.conf.bak) 2) tell the program to try and save the changes again and it usually works now that xorg.conf no longer exists
