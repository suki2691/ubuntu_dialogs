2012-08-21T15:29:00.000Z	Draconicus		I trashed my entire Precise apt system by adding an old Lucid repository in order to get an old, old version of gthumb I really like. I have removed the held/locked packages and removed the Lucid repository, but ANY package I try to install hits a random snag where "blah blah version" IS TO BE INSTALLED for seom dependencies
2012-08-21T15:30:00.000Z	Draconicus		I can't install anything now. It really seems like updates aren't showing up, and so it's expecting updated versions of dependencies that aren't available somehow

2012-08-21T15:30:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Draconicus	No expert, but I do belive you're looking a fresh install.
