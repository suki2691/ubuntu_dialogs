2010-01-01T09:48:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		I figure I'll politely ask this again... What Logs can tell me when files have been deleted/moved? <-- somewhat important since there's a lot of data missing :s
2010-01-01T09:48:00.000Z	ljamisonii	Gaming4JC	check this out...if you can't figure it out and the client knows the information they lost, this may be able to help...http://www.ehow.com/how_2064953_recover-deleted-files-linux.html
2010-01-01T09:49:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	ljamisonii	thanks.
2010-01-01T09:49:00.000Z	ljamisonii	Gaming4JC	not a problem ^_^ I'll keep looking to see if there's anything better, but that should at least give you a start
