2008-10-16T07:29:00.000Z	TheBeast		I'm planning to install an ubuntu system using the minimal iso (the one that's like 10 megs) and I'd like to enable the interpid (cutting edge) repos. do you think this would be possible?
2008-10-16T07:31:00.000Z	jrib	TheBeast	you don't "enable intrepid repos".  It's a different release.  You would need to upgrade from hardy to intrepid if you have the hardy minimal iso.  Instead you should get an actual intrepid iso. #ubuntu+1 is the channel for help with intrepid
2008-10-16T07:32:00.000Z	TheBeast	jrib	what I really want is to edit /etc/apt/sources.list or whatever and get interpid installed off the minimal ISO over the network(network install) is that possible?
2008-10-16T07:32:00.000Z	jrib	TheBeast	doesn't sound like a terribly great idea, no.  Ask #ubuntu+1 if there exists an intrepid minimal iso, that is what you want
