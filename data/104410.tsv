2010-12-18T04:01:00.000Z	sammy		*grumble* I'm guessing if someone greps their /etc/group for 500, it will come out blank. I'm not sure why some files on my system (that I've never touched , like /etc/network/interfaces) have group ownership of GUID 500...

2010-12-18T04:03:00.000Z	sammy	ActionParsnip	your /etc/network/interfaces? makes sense.
2010-12-18T04:03:00.000Z	sammy	ActionParsnip	I can't seem to figure out where this group 500 came from
