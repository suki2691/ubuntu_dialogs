2011-07-03T02:58:00.000Z	tigerplug292		I have purchased a new hard drive for my laptop and an external enclosure. Wondering the best way to transfer my current install onto this new drive via external enclosure before installing in laptop?

2011-07-03T02:58:00.000Z	tigerplug292	th0r	dd ?
2011-07-03T02:59:00.000Z	th0r	tigerplug292	assuming the internal is /dev/sda, and the external is /dev/sdb, I think it is simply 'dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb'. I hope someone else will chime in if that is wrong
