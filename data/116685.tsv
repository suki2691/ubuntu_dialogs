2007-10-25T05:18:00.000Z	mehevi		hello there.  I have a problem, nm-applet starts a total of three times when my xfce session begins, and I cannot figure out where it is getting called three times!  I've checked ~/.config and removed all entries to it but it still starts up three times.  When xfce starts it calls it before the autostart menu is parsed, that's all I know.  any advice on where to look?
