2010-07-28T02:15:00.000Z	Synthead		so any idea how to install ubuntu remotely?  I want to be able to install apt-get and dpkg on another distribution, create and mount a mount point, install the packages, touch it up, update grub, and reboot into it

2010-07-28T02:20:00.000Z	KE1HA	Synthead	the easiest way I know to "remote install" is to use a PXE Server. You cna also use it formultiple versions.
