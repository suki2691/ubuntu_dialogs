2008-07-25T01:17:00.000Z	Mecha25	DavidCanarias	Rhythmbox should do it, I think
2008-07-25T01:18:00.000Z	DavidCanarias	Mecha25	does this actually convert as I am having lots of problems
2008-07-25T01:19:00.000Z	Mecha25	DavidCanarias	Rhythmbox is roughly equivalent to iTunes, I think it should do it, if not then I think Audio CD Extractor is installed by default, under the Sound menu
