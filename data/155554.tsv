2007-03-04T15:11:00.000Z	oo7		so you want the story....
2007-03-04T15:12:00.000Z	oo7		i was downloading a torrent, which i thoguht was to a large partition, but the large partition wasn't mounted, so it was being downloaded to my / partition.  so overnight it filled up the HD.  so this morning i was wondering why the partition wasn't mounted, so i edited my fstab, while my HD was completly full.  when i saved my fstab, it was saved as an empty file and i lost the data within.  pretty shitty eh?
