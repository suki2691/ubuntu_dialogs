2009-08-27T03:55:00.000Z	andresmh		I'm trying to help my mom remotely about a, I think, resolution problem she has. Basically everything looks humongous. She sent me this screenshot: http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/285483/tmp/screen.png
2009-08-27T03:56:00.000Z	andresmh		Any ideas on how to debug this? I am afraid of getting her to mess with X.org and I also think it might be just themeing issues?
