This is messing with some cronjobs that are running out of my home directory. Moving them to a directory other than my home directory is not an option.

2009-03-31T03:21:00.000Z	hatter243	simon__	the mount command creates the error that says the directory is already mounted. Then the directory exists for an unknown amount of time before disappearing again. I'm hoping for a bit more reliability. Unless you know a good argument to pass to mount that I am not thinking of
2009-03-31T03:22:00.000Z	hatter243	simon__	maybe I'll just have the mount command run once an hour and pipe the error to /dev/null. hah
