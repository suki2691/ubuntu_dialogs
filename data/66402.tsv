2009-07-18T18:33:00.000Z	yellabs		so i have this themed gnome , but when i add an new user it defaults to the "normal" human theme, is there any way to set it that it uses my theme as system default?
2009-07-18T18:34:00.000Z	mzz	yellabs	it'd probably involve messing around in /etc/skel/
2009-07-18T18:34:00.000Z	mzz	yellabs	or possibly in /etc/gconf actually, although don't do that by hand
