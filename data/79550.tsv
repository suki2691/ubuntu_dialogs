When the server started it show a screen of kde with progress bar ... continusly circulating (although i was using gnome before the boot) ... after more then an hr i decided to reboot it. but no use ... I don't know how atleast i come back to commad line so that i could do any cleanup opration.

2012-05-21T17:12:00.000Z	DasEi	WaqarAzeem	left shift when grub starts, usually second entry
