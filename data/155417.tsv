2012-04-28T05:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	walterwoj	You should be able to install Backtrack as if to an internal drive, though you'd have to confirm that in their support channel. I already said that you can simply use Ubuntu's installer and install to the USB drive the same way you would an internal drive. After you do that it will be bootable.
