2012-11-04T23:18:00.000Z	blastedt		yeah... ubuntu crashes as soon as I load it up unfortunately, so I need to restore the space as the HDD is rather small and I allocated half to each OS
2012-11-04T23:19:00.000Z	gordonjcp	blastedt	why not try fixing the crashes?
2012-11-04T23:20:00.000Z	blastedt	gordonjcp	I spent six or so hours trying to, got to the point where it turned out the stock video drivers were causing horrible slowdown, and nvidia's cause the boot crash.  I'd keep trying but finals are coming up very soon and I just want the space at this point
