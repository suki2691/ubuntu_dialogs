2010-02-19T10:41:00.000Z	HeMan		Hi! I've installed Lucid (yes I know it isn't released yet), should I report bugs I find there?
2010-02-19T10:43:00.000Z	tucemiux	HeMan	please do, you can use launchpad to do that, you can also use #ubuntu+1 to discuss the bugs you find on lucid
2010-02-19T10:44:00.000Z	HeMan	tucemiux	I usually try to do bugreporting (and sometimes triageing) on bugs I find
2010-02-19T10:45:00.000Z	tucemiux	HeMan	sometimes you can get a lot more help on launchpad with bugs than in the support channel, if you continually test on your machine I suspect the official release will work without issues out of the box on the machine you tested
