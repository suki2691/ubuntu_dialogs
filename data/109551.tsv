2008-01-04T03:52:00.000Z	NotSoSuperMario		hey, anyone have a recommendation as to which IRC daemon I should use to start a server?
2008-01-04T03:53:00.000Z	NotSoSuperMario		it doesn't have to handle massive traffic, it's just for internal communications
2008-01-04T03:53:00.000Z	IdleOne	NotSoSuperMario	Unreal ircd is good. google for ircd see what you like
2008-01-04T03:54:00.000Z	NotSoSuperMario	IdleOne	Unreal it is. thanks!
