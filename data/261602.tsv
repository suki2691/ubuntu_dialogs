2005-08-29T15:50:00.000Z	Seveas	sponge008	there is no such thing as 'the ubuntu source code'. You can download sourcecode for packages with apt-get source
2005-08-29T15:56:00.000Z	Seveas	sponge008	you're not supposed to compile ndiswrapper
2005-08-29T15:56:00.000Z	Seveas	sponge008	there is no such thing as a perl exe
