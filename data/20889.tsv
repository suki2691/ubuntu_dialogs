2011-02-22T10:56:00.000Z	johnson81385		 I am trying to setup a Samba Domain controller with LDAP backend. The version of Ubuntu is 10.04 and openldap version is 2.4.21. And i followed the document from the URL  https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/samba-ldap.html. The problem with my setup is I am not able to Join windows machines to the domain.
