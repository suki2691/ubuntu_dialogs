2009-12-24T06:31:00.000Z	jeff1140		I cant select my desktop resolution in Ubuntu.  I cannot select 1366x768.  Any ideas?
2009-12-24T06:32:00.000Z	captivus	jeff1140	You try editing xorg.conf?
2009-12-24T06:35:00.000Z	captivus	jeff1140	I'd recommend Googling that one ... the file isn't difficult to understand but you'll need to read a bit.
2009-12-24T06:35:00.000Z	captivus	jeff1140	You're going to want to edit it and ensure that the resolution you're after is configured therein.
