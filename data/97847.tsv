2010-01-24T21:44:00.000Z	scunizi	catphish	do you mean that usb doesn't automount anymore?
2010-01-24T21:46:00.000Z	catphish	scunizi	sebsebseb: yes - usb mass storage and SD cards have both stopped automounting into gnome on all user accounts, i know f-spot isnt related, but it stopped working around the time i removed it, and when i removed it, a lot of dependant packages were also removed
