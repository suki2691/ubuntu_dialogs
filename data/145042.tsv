2007-03-03T15:24:00.000Z	ignas		i have a 1280x1024 resolution monitor but my laptop only can do 1024x768, i have set Virtual 1280x1024, and set the dual screen so it would show same thing as my main screen does, but my big monitor is still being used as a 1024x768 with scrolling :/
2007-03-03T15:24:00.000Z	ignas		is there any way to fix that ?
