I can play *sometimes* the same media url through vlc. And sometimes I can hear the test bleeps from the System -> Preferences -> Sound dialog. At the moment, I can hear the wind from sl, but no bleeps from the sound Dialog and no music, either from sl or from VLC. Looks like the mixing isn't happen
