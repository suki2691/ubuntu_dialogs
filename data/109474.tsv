2007-12-16T12:29:00.000Z	Gnea	nault	have you looked at any of the laptop pages for your model, or close to your model?
2007-12-16T12:32:00.000Z	nault	Gnea	I somehow removed an interface. I want to get it back. Nothing more, nothing less. The rest I can do on my own. Why do you think looking at a laptop guide would help me with the generic problem of creating an interface that was removed?
2007-12-16T12:33:00.000Z	Gnea	nault	just look at the page and see if it's there - maybe the problem's been solved already or maybe there's simply no solution at all.
