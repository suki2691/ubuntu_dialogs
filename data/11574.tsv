2011-07-27T19:46:00.000Z	fmauro	sanesto123	you mean redirect ssh input to tty?
2011-07-27T19:47:00.000Z	sanesto123	fmauro	yes i want to be able to see a picture using fbi via ssh, so i want to redirect the tty from the server to my laptop
2011-07-27T19:48:00.000Z	fmauro	sanesto123	I've never done that before, I would use screen to achieve the same effect.
