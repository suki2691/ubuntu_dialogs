2009-06-16T19:15:00.000Z	compilerwriter		I was under the impression that when I did a clen install to 9.04 my hard drive would be formatted and Kubuntu reinstalled was I incorrect?
2009-06-16T19:16:00.000Z	Slart	compilerwriter	yes.. afaik that is correct
2009-06-16T19:17:00.000Z	Slart	compilerwriter	then it sounds like you just installed over the old system.. ie not a clean install
2009-06-16T19:19:00.000Z	Slart	compilerwriter	I think you can do it in the installer.. where you select what hard drives to use and such..
