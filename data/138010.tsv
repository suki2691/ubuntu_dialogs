2007-04-20T13:35:00.000Z	FeistyAhoy		Hi. I installed Feisty using the Alternate ISO. Does it have the "Windows Migration Assistant"?
2007-04-20T13:36:00.000Z	magnetron	FeistyAhoy	Yes, it is run during installation
2007-04-20T13:36:00.000Z	FeistyAhoy	magnetron	It didn't run for me.
2007-04-20T13:37:00.000Z	magnetron	FeistyAhoy	Ok, it ran just after the disk setup for me, from the "desktop" cd
