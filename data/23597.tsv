2010-10-31T05:24:00.000Z	Andorin		Since Audacity now seems to have some sort of bug that renders it almost unusable, what is a simple audio editor I can use to split a single large rip into individual tracks?
2010-10-31T05:25:00.000Z	KimLaRoux	Andorin	can k3b do such a thing?
2010-10-31T05:25:00.000Z	Andorin	KimLaRoux	Would that be a KDE application by any chance?
2010-10-31T05:26:00.000Z	KimLaRoux	Andorin	yes
