2008-05-12T16:41:00.000Z	mtrierscheid		I've got some display lightness issues on my fujitsu-siemens notebook. There's a kernel module which can handle it: fujitsu-laptop. But when I set the brightness via console (echo 1 > /sys/class/backlight/fujitsu-laptop/brightness) the lightness doesn't change.

2008-05-12T16:43:00.000Z	mtrierscheid	hwilde	well, I hoped that I could somehow use the keys to control the brightness but if I have to reboot every time.. :(
