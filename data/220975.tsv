2005-10-02T11:11:00.000Z	puff		Now that's odd... ubuntu just froze up on me... still had a video image of the desktop, but absolutely nothing I could do got any reaction, including trying to shift to the f1/f2/f3 terminals, and ctrl-alt-delete.  Finally had to hold down the power button.
2005-10-02T11:11:00.000Z	Answer	puff	I think it's ctrl+alt+f1  on mine
2005-10-02T11:15:00.000Z	puff	Answer	Yeah, I tried ctrl-alt-f1, shift-ctrl-alt-f1, alt-shift-f1, etc.
2005-10-02T11:15:00.000Z	puff	Answer	I was pretty sure it was ctrl-alt-f1 when you're in X, but I tried the others just to be sure.  I *hate* rebooting.
