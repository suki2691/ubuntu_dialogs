2007-03-16T16:20:00.000Z	Phonica		hey all, i have burned a 6.10 cd and am having problems with the partitioning: Trying to shrink an NTFS partition, the error message i ultimately get is "Failed to check /dev/hda1 mount state: No such file or directory, Probably /etc/mtab missing. It's too risky to continue. You might try another Linux distro.
2007-03-16T16:20:00.000Z	Phonica		what should i do?
2007-03-16T16:20:00.000Z	Phonica		thinking i might retry with a dedicated gparted livcd
2007-03-16T16:20:00.000Z	PirateHead	Phonica	that's a really wierd error. You might want to try the gparted livecd, yeah.
