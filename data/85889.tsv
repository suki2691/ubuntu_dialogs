2011-02-01T14:29:00.000Z	Ascavasaion	insmod	Umm... not sure... on other linux distros (scaled down ones like Puppy) Xorg.0.log says that VGA arbiter not enabled and therefore dual cards not allowed.  In Ubuntu however I get this line now "Found 2 VGA devices: arbiter wrapping enabled" which I presume means that it is included in the kernel?
