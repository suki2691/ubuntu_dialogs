2012-07-04T14:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Oli_	 if your hardware supports 64bit - go 64bits
2012-07-04T14:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Oli_	 unless you got a lot of ram. You could just go 32bit.
2012-07-04T14:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Oli_	 i always go 64bit on hw that supportes it. because i do a lot of video encodeing. so even a 1% gain in speeds for encoding is worth it. ;)
