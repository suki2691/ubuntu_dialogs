2010-05-25T04:06:00.000Z	ElTimo		why can't empathy do file transfer?
2010-05-25T04:07:00.000Z	blue_anna	ElTimo	which netowkr are you connecting to? file transfers work on google talk
2010-05-25T04:09:00.000Z	ElTimo	blue_anna	i don't want to have to install pidgin, because empathy is the default and i don't feel like making it fit in like empathy does
2010-05-25T04:10:00.000Z	blue_anna	ElTimo	pdgin is a darn good alternative to have as a fallback though, if you find functionality lacking in empathy (like audio / video in msn, or apparently file transfers in aim)
