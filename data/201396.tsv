2006-01-08T11:46:00.000Z	nemik		hello, i'm having a problem. i shut down the computer normally, but it now won't come back into gnome. login page looks fine and i log in, but box that show nautilus and stuff loading never comes up. :(
2006-01-08T11:48:00.000Z	nemik		does anyone know how i can fix this? it is just a blank screen with the brown wallpaper and i can move the mouse, but nothing else happens
2006-01-08T11:50:00.000Z	madewokherd	nemik	did you try the "failsafe gnome" session?
2006-01-08T11:51:00.000Z	nemik	madewokherd	thanks i'll try the failsafe gnome now
