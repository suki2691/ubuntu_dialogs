2010-02-15T02:11:00.000Z	Guest62447		i have a question about installing ubuntu. i have an older computer have ubuntu installed 9.10. I went to the pkg manager and installed xfce4. my question is would there be a difference in computer performance by just installing xubuntu rather having gnome on the system?
2010-02-15T02:13:00.000Z	Guest62447		so i am defeating the purpose by doing what i did,

2010-02-15T02:15:00.000Z	becker_11	Guest62447	no prob
