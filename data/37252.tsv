2010-03-06T01:51:00.000Z	histo		I want to set up a webserver where php's mail function will work to send out emails from a contact page. Is there a howto somewhere?  I don't need a fullblown email server as I use google apps for mail.
2010-03-06T01:52:00.000Z	hellz_bellz	histo	sudo apt-get php apache
2010-03-06T01:52:00.000Z	hellz_bellz		then goto #php
