2007-05-30T13:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Griz	you'd have to boot into the livecd, chroot to the harddisk root partition, and sudo update-grub && sudo grub-install

2007-05-30T13:36:00.000Z	nickrud	Griz	there's a step by step thing on help.ubuntu.com/community, search for something like installing grub after installing windows; it's the same steps
