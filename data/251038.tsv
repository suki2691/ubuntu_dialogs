2005-06-07T12:09:00.000Z	levander	dle	lol, i'm not going to drag the iso itself, but I'll open a source CD with nautilus, and drag all the files on the CD to a nautilu window representing the blank CD

2005-06-07T12:15:00.000Z	levander	dle	looked into it more, won't work, won't make the CD bootable
