2008-05-11T05:40:00.000Z	Slyboots		Having a small issue with VLC and natulius, I keep most of my movie files hosted on another machine over SMB, but when I click on a file inside nautlius VLC cant read it (But totem) can
2008-05-11T05:41:00.000Z	Slyboots		I think its because its passing on the files location as smb://xxxxxxx and VLC does not understand that
2008-05-11T05:41:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Slyboots	I think that's a known bug. I've heard it before, in any case.
