2009-04-25T18:53:00.000Z	marquinos		Hi! I have a question, please :) Can I update from Ubuntu 7.04 to Ubuntu 9.04 with only one update? (Maybe with the alternate CD? :) Thanks!
2009-04-25T18:54:00.000Z	doleyb	marquinos	The instructions say that such a long upgrade isn't supported :(
2009-04-25T18:55:00.000Z	marquinos	doleyb	:) thanks, "long upgrade" is only 1 more version? What can I do?
