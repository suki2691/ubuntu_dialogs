2012-03-28T19:24:00.000Z	urist_	hylian	I have not tried XFCE yet, but have heard great things. I am a bit of a sucker for Unity I must say. But use Gnome on my laptop because it seems to run better
2012-03-28T19:25:00.000Z	hylian	urist_	i like unity too. the only thing i don't like, is the hiding bar gets in my way. if it could be teucked under like gnome 3's bar, then it would be perfect.
2012-03-28T19:26:00.000Z	urist_	hylian	I agree, very often I bring the bar out by mistake. Especially while browsing
