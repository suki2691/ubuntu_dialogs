2006-09-22T12:39:00.000Z	jrib	asidjazz	I mean, are you logging into gnome?
2006-09-22T12:45:00.000Z	jrib	asidjazz	if you are logging into gnome, then none of those files should be sourced.  ~/.gnomerc is sourced though.  And /etc/bash.bashrc as well as ~/.bashrc get sourced when you open a terminal
