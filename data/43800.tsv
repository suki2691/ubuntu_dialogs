2009-11-16T19:13:00.000Z	duergar		i need to reformat and dual boot with windows xp because a couple of programs i need to run use the .net 3.5 architecture and unfortunately wine and crossover don't work for this. Where do i find out exactly how big my linux installation is so i can create a partition large enough to hold just the operating system?

2009-11-16T19:19:00.000Z	Spixx	duergar	hmm, It will "work" <- notice the "" :P
2009-11-16T19:19:00.000Z	Spixx	duergar	np, it is simpler with virtualbox though :D
