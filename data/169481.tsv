2006-08-27T11:17:00.000Z	soundray		I have a machine here that only boots with acpi=off, but then it tends to overheat and shut down. Is it worth trying an edgy kernel?
2006-08-27T11:19:00.000Z	empty	soundray	apparently it is
2006-08-27T11:20:00.000Z	soundray	empty	is it sufficient to download the image and install it with dpkg, or does it depend on a slew of other edgy updates?
2006-08-27T11:20:00.000Z	empty	soundray	I have a similiar issue, apparently thats the only resolution. I wouldnt know, ask erUSUL
