2008-06-06T12:26:00.000Z	geolr		Hi folks, I do have this basic problem in understanding ubuntus concept: i like using f-spot. now there was a newer version released than installed in my 8.04. So does the new version enter only the next 8.10 ubuntu or do i have any option to upgrade earlier?
2008-06-06T12:28:00.000Z	Daisuke_Ido	geolr	that all depends on how important the new release is
2008-06-06T12:28:00.000Z	Daisuke_Ido	geolr	you can enable the backports repository to get newer releases
2008-06-06T12:29:00.000Z	geolr	Daisuke_Ido	thx, so I will have a closer look on the backports
