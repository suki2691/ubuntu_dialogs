2009-07-06T11:48:00.000Z	OttifantSir		Does anyone have an idea why my audio desyncs with the video when recording with gtk-recordmydesktop?
2009-07-06T11:49:00.000Z	skyl	OttifantSir	are you using JACK?
2009-07-06T11:50:00.000Z	OttifantSir	skyl	No. Tried installing it, and tweaking the settings trying to get it to work for two days, then gave up. My soundcard is HDA Intel, at least in Mixer control
2009-07-06T11:51:00.000Z	skyl	OttifantSir	I seemed to get get good sync but I would have to load Ardour and qjackctrl and then start gtk-RMD ... idk, it's tricky...
