2009-12-09T21:34:00.000Z	aaron11_		I want my tablet to work because I want my art to go up on the wiki and hope that someday it will be of use. I cant do that because my UC-Logic Technology Corp. Genius MousePen 5x4 Tablet does not work! I tried getting the wizard-pen driver but only the taps of my pen works, no motion capture. This is a big downfall because Fedora is having good tablet support...
