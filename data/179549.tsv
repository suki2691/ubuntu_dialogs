Ubuntu resoultion gui says its running at 50mhz, but the monitors menus states 60mhz.  Also the feisty live cd boots up with the moniter out of sync

2007-06-27T09:54:00.000Z	bobjones_	jrib	ok cool, checked nvidia display settings aswell, says 60 too.  do you think the live cd booting up with monitor out of sync is anything to worry about, i guess i could always grab the alternate install cd.  the fedore 7 live cd also dosent work, the monitor is in sync, but the screen is garbeled
