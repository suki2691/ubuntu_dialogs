2005-09-12T10:26:00.000Z	Bad_Magic		anyone have any suggestions for a gnome based C++ syntax highlighting text editor?
2005-09-12T10:27:00.000Z	Madpilot	Bad_Magic	I think Screem works with C++
2005-09-12T10:30:00.000Z	Madpilot	Bad_Magic	for Screem? isn't it included by default? (I don't program, just use Screem for XHTML/CSS/PHP...)
2005-09-12T10:31:00.000Z	Madpilot	Bad_Magic	just checked, you're right, there's no C++ tag tree for Screem by default. ask google?
