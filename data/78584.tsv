2008-09-23T03:32:00.000Z	brandan_		Hey does anyone know of a Application for Ubuntu that will display a icon that can blink on my desktop to show when my hard drive is reading/writing? I can't seem to hook up my hard drive light on my tower
2008-09-23T03:33:00.000Z	brandan_		my computer slows down at times, i'm trying to figure out if its my hard drive(s) lagging behind or not...
