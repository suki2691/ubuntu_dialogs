2009-05-27T21:50:00.000Z	hagus	Proteus^	I am trying to partition 125Mb of unallocated space to make it ready for ubuntu.  How should I do that?
2009-05-27T21:51:00.000Z	hagus		The sizes being reported by gparted are a little strange to me.
2009-05-27T21:51:00.000Z	Proteus^	hagus	i fyou only have 125mb of space, i would suggest not using ubuntu, check out puppylinux http://www.puppylinux.org/ you can install it to a flash drive as well and boot that way
