2006-01-08T17:39:00.000Z	sig		hey guys I'm having huge issues with my laptop, after a few minutes everything switches to read-only. I ran memtest and it didn't find anything wrong with my memory, is this because the HD is going bad?
2006-01-08T08:48:00.000Z	sig		why doesn't ubuntu at installation use the i686 kernel when it is a P4 2.8ghz ?
2006-01-08T08:48:00.000Z	sig		also at boot the ntp.ubuntulinux.org clock syncronize fails ?
