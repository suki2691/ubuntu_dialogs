2009-04-29T09:49:00.000Z	ChienNoir		I was about to perform a online upgrade of a running 8.10 desktop.
2009-04-29T09:49:00.000Z	ChienNoir		can I do-release-upgrade just like I did for 8.04 to 8.10 ?
2009-04-29T09:50:00.000Z	daftykins	ChienNoir	yes, if you're on Intrepid now you can upgrade via the same method as you used previously no doubt
