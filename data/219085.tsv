2007-11-26T12:57:00.000Z	xeer		how do i go about installing ubuntu through a terminal? i'm pretty much wanting to install ubuntu from ubuntu onto a different drive
2007-11-26T12:59:00.000Z	xeer		anyone? is there a simple method to install ubuntu onto a different disk, through ubuntu itself?
2007-11-26T12:59:00.000Z	xeer		not moving, creating a new one. this one is screwed up and i'd like to install it on a new disk
2007-11-26T13:00:00.000Z	Tidus	xeer	just simply pop the cd in and install it to the new disk...
