2008-03-03T08:07:00.000Z	smartface		Does anyone know how to fix error apache2: Could not determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.0.1 for ServerName
2008-03-03T08:08:00.000Z	Cpudan80	smartface	put the server's FQDN in the config file
2008-03-03T08:08:00.000Z	smartface	usser	and how do i do that?
2008-03-03T08:08:00.000Z	Cpudan80	smartface	You probably dont have an FQDN anyway --- so 127.0.0.
