2010-08-06T07:06:00.000Z	Livin4Jesus		My Ubuntu won't start. It just shows the "Try (0, 0)" sign. Then I have to restart my computer. I installed it using Wubi. Can someone help me?
2010-08-06T07:08:00.000Z	Livin4Jesus		Where can I find them?
2010-08-06T07:08:00.000Z	welinux	Livin4Jesus	can you see Grub on your monitor?
