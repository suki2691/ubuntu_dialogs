2007-03-03T09:57:00.000Z	edgymike		Hi, I think I figured out what happened to my sound.  I think I updated to the .11 kernel using the ubuntu installer.  The modules I need for the sound card... I see them in the .10 module directory, but they don't exist in the .11 directory
2007-03-03T09:57:00.000Z	bulmer	edgymike	then look for it in .10 ?
2007-03-03T09:58:00.000Z	edgymike	bulmer	I see it in .10, not in .11.  How do I get them in the .11 kernel? just run the alsa-source drivers?
2007-03-03T09:58:00.000Z	bulmer	edgymike	i supposed so, try it
