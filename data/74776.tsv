2011-10-17T07:49:00.000Z	Aikar		like why was the customization of themes removed in 11.10? now im stuck with radiance?
2011-10-17T07:50:00.000Z	robin0800	Aikar	install gnome-tweak-tools and gnome-standard-themes
2011-10-17T07:53:00.000Z	robin0800	Aikar	think most of this is caused by insisting it must all fit on a cd so as core gets bigger more gets dropped
