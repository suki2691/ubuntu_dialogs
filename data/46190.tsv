2009-10-06T01:10:00.000Z	Sala_	trijntje	i am aware of what wubi is. im looking for support here for a simple menu.lst missing problem.
2009-10-06T01:13:00.000Z	trijntje	Sala_	I understand that, I think the problem is that win7 is not supported
2009-10-06T01:13:00.000Z	Sala_	trijntje	i dont see any fundamental shifts from vista +  i ran it on vista compactability mode. cant i just copy menu.lst?
2009-10-06T01:14:00.000Z	trijntje	Sala_	I think that what wubi does has little to do with vista compatibilty mode
