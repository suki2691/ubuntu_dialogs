2010-03-05T02:21:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		Is it a bad idea to run sshd on a port outside the privileged range?
2010-03-05T02:22:00.000Z	Nitsuga	Mike_lifeguard	it is a GREAT idea.
2010-03-05T02:24:00.000Z	Nitsuga	Mike_lifeguard	you can choose any from the 65k+ ports
2010-03-05T02:24:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	Nitsuga	I did already, I'm just wondering if I should pick again from the unreserved ports <1024 (or whatever the number is... the ones only root can use)
