2012-11-30T09:41:00.000Z	k1lumin4t1		I'm having issues with network printing on Ubuntu 12.04. I can print through localhost without any problems to a printer, but cannot do it trough network share using neither the process of adding the remote printer on the client using the web interface nor using the client.conf file to specify the ServerName directive
2012-11-30T09:41:00.000Z	k1lumin4t1		It asks me for an authentication thing which never asked me before
2012-11-30T09:42:00.000Z	nardev	k1lumin4t1	is it a network printer?
2012-11-30T09:43:00.000Z	k1lumin4t1	nardev	nope, a local printer through usb
