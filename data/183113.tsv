2007-06-25T06:37:00.000Z	zkeeton		Hello:  I am having a heck of a time setting up printing.  I have followed various guides, as well as the Wiki. and for some reason I can not get my other Ubuntu computer to print.  I have just removed cups, and am re-installing it, and wondering if anyone can offer some advice?
2007-06-25T06:37:00.000Z	Pelo	zkeeton	what kind of printer ?
2007-06-25T06:38:00.000Z	Pelo	zkeeton	usb ? or parallel ?
2007-06-25T06:38:00.000Z	Pelo	zkeeton	there are some hp printing packages in synaptic,  see if they can help
