2010-04-28T20:25:00.000Z	hashed_	mickster04	here's something on that for 9.04:  http://www.ubuntugeek.com/install-gui-in-ubuntu-server.html

2010-04-28T20:27:00.000Z	hashed_	mickster04	 it depends on how you use it.  If you are planning to have a general-use desktop with a Lamp server, I would suggest using Desktop and adding the Lamp components in.
