2006-11-17T12:15:00.000Z	Flannel		believe the second link is where it's ended up
2006-11-17T12:17:00.000Z	v3rmap	Flannel	does that mean merely doing a right click in nautilus, choosing "Share Folder", selecting "SMB" is not going to do it?
2006-11-17T12:18:00.000Z	Flannel	v3rmap	No idea.  I don't use samba, I just know the 'mounting sans password' thing is addressed
