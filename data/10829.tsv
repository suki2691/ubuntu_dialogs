2011-09-30T09:47:00.000Z	rs2k		I've been using CentOS 5.X as a LAMP server for a few years now. I've been considering switching to Ubuntu 10.04 because it seems more packages that I use than CentOS does.
2011-09-30T09:49:00.000Z	rs2k		Is there a list somewhere that can show what difference there are between CentOS and Ubuntu?
2011-09-30T09:51:00.000Z	urlin2u	rs2k	not a comprehensive one no.
2011-09-30T09:53:00.000Z	urlin2u	rs2k	3 distros available with 4 standardd esktops in ubuntu knd of hard to have a list.
