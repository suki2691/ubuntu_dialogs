2011-08-07T12:15:00.000Z	bullgard4_	llutz_	The character '@'.
2011-08-07T12:16:00.000Z	llutz_	bullgard4_	does it work, if you  try US-layout,prssing shift-2? just as a workaround until you fix the real bug
2011-08-07T12:25:00.000Z	bullgard4_	llutz_	My Natty interprets the key combination Alt+2 as "Pos1" (= jump to the first position in a line). --  I have found out another workaround: I can log in as another user.
