2010-01-16T19:08:00.000Z	fmagno		Hi, I'm trying to remove some shortcuts that remain in   "Applications->Others", but when I press right-button on "Applications" and try to click on "Edit Menus" nothing happens (no menu appears)... How can I manually erase these files? Where are these files resident?
