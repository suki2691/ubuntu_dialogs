2011-09-19T22:28:00.000Z	majorzoheb		when installing ubuntu, is it possible to keep files that are already on the hardrive as part of a previous OS?
2011-09-19T22:29:00.000Z	m6locks	majorzoheb	yeah if you use some kind of software like partition magic to repartition the drive
2011-09-19T22:32:00.000Z	m6locks	majorzoheb	yes if you use virtual box of some sort, like vmware or parallels
