2004-11-04T16:16:00.000Z	travis		hey guys, I have 2 problems. First off, grub won't boot into my windows partition. I had the same problem with fedora, but not with gentoo. Second, DNS resolution takes forever in Ubuntu, but not Windows, Mac, or Gentoo.
2004-11-04T16:17:00.000Z	travis		I may have used that incorrectly, not sure
2004-11-04T16:18:00.000Z	travis		yep. And in X-chat, when it was connecting to freenode. Basically everything.
2004-11-04T16:19:00.000Z	merriam	travis	i've noticed that.  i hadn't connected it with ubuntu
