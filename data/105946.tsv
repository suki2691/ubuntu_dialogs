2009-07-19T17:23:00.000Z	Threetimes		I have two screens, but one is smaller than the other. Above the smaller screen there's an area where the mouse can get "lost": It's there but i can't see it. How can I keep the mous out there?

2009-07-19T17:25:00.000Z	Bodsda	Threetimes	ah, im not usre then sorry. With the nvidia-settings program you can resize the screen sizes in relation to eachother which eliminates the issue
