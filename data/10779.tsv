2011-10-22T08:34:00.000Z	mr-rich	html	you don't understand ... GNU/Linux is NOT a hobby for me ... It is my main OS that I use every day and I don't go around doing fresh installs every time a new version comes out ... Now, I chose to use (K)ubuntu because it is stable, well supported, relativley painless to upgrade and getting help is usually a good experience ... Now, if there is a way to fix this, I'd like to hear it ... :)
