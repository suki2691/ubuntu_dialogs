2009-03-06T11:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	daftykins	sata drives don't have that type of selection
2009-03-06T11:08:00.000Z	daftykins	Scunizi	yes they do
2009-03-06T11:09:00.000Z	Scunizi	daftykins	daftykins only if you have one of the newer drives.. and none of the sata drives have master/slave selection pins like a pata or ide drive
