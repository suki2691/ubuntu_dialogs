2006-03-27T17:24:00.000Z	th0rndike	Auckland_Pig	need temporary mounting or add to fstab?
2006-03-27T17:25:00.000Z	Auckland_Pig	th0rndike	first temporary.. if it works then i'll add to fstab
2006-03-27T17:25:00.000Z	Auckland_Pig		i did mount... but it tells me... that i'm trying to mount a partition
2006-03-27T17:25:00.000Z	th0rndike	Auckland_Pig	 it should work both ways :p
