2009-01-13T01:05:00.000Z	jarco		is it possible in ubuntu to limit the traffic going over a specific network port. Or to limit all the internet traffic at once?
2009-01-13T01:06:00.000Z	Jeruvy	jarco	your question is too vague, and not specific to ubuntu.  Are you seeking software?
2009-01-13T01:07:00.000Z	jarco	Jeruvy	i am looking for a program or a function in ubuntu/linux to limit the traffic going over my eth0 or over all internet connections.
