2008-06-14T02:27:00.000Z	Browserice		Hi, anyone know how to force 7.10 desktop to fully extend monitor screen ? I have screen borders not covered by desktop.
2008-06-14T02:28:00.000Z	Browserice		dont want to rezise monitor with its button, I use other O/S that will be impacted if I do this
2008-06-14T02:29:00.000Z	hydroponic	Browserice	have you tried that? With my monitor, resizing it with the button only seems to affect the current OS
