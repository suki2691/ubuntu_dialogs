2008-01-06T20:38:00.000Z	albacker	hairulfr	i have UBUNTU's CD. [older version compared to installed version]. and i remember this is how i did it las tiem. i got slow connection and i dont have empty CDs [that means i can't get that CD and burn it]. If you could help me ? what should i mount [root is /dev/sda4] but when i mount that, and see under /dev/ there are no sda or hda devices. Should i mount anything else ?

2008-01-06T20:42:00.000Z	albacker	hairulfr	already checked that guide, there should be some extra step for my case. mounting /dev/sda4 to a random directory, doesn't do the job,..
