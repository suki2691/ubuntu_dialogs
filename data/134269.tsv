2007-05-16T06:48:00.000Z	insomniac190		I am trying to set up a samba share on my feisty box so i can access it on my modded xbox, but i know nothing about samba.  Can anyone give me a hand?

2007-05-16T06:49:00.000Z	insomniac190	nibsa1242b	 you say good luck, is it hard?
2007-05-16T06:50:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	insomniac190	I've tried and failed to Samba in the past. I think it might be easier now, but as I no longer use any version of Windows I haven't tried.
