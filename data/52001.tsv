2012-06-09T12:19:00.000Z	back_homu		One question: if I download portable apps like Eclipse IDE, where is a good place to put these stuff?
2012-06-09T12:20:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	back_homu	why not just use the repository version?
2012-06-09T12:21:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	back_homu	it's not installed by default, but you can always install it from the repository
2012-06-09T12:24:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	back_homu	you can use as many apt managers as you like (apt-get, synaptic, aptitude, usc), just try not to have more than 1 *running* at the same time (they *should* lock each other out safely though)
