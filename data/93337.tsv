2008-11-12T02:42:00.000Z	pisse		are there any other terminal-based text editor than vim? I'm using ssh to my school and want to edit a file
2008-11-12T02:42:00.000Z	fryguy	pisse	nano, pico, emacs, sed/cat/awk for manual line editing
2008-11-12T02:43:00.000Z	fryguy		I just upgraded to 8.10 and my second monitor won't turn on anymore.  ATI Radeon graphics card, restored my existing xorg.conf that I backed up, with no effect.  I'm also stuck at 800x600 resolution.  What can I do?
2008-11-12T02:44:00.000Z	pisse	fryguy	emacs worked fine, thanks!
