2007-02-23T11:33:00.000Z	davidwinter		I've got an old Dell Latitude D266XT off of ebay for my Aunt to use, and want to install Ubuntu. The boot device is not set to CD-ROM first, and I can't change the options in the bios because of some admin password that I don't know :( any advice?
2007-02-23T11:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	davidwinter	 reset the bios.. unpluyg machine.. remove battery.. either find the jumper to reset.. or just let it sit over night... or a hr or 2
2007-02-23T11:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	davidwinter	 remove battery. UNPLUG from wall first... -  letit sit a while.. perhaps find some docs where a bios-reset jumper or 'short' point is at. and use a jumper or screwdriver to reset it.
