2010-04-19T10:22:00.000Z	proq		can someone point me to a list of what packages to remove to remove gnome? I don't have a server CD handy and I need to strip down my system for quick running on virtualbox
2010-04-19T10:23:00.000Z	boblemur	proq	do you still need X?
2010-04-19T10:24:00.000Z	boblemur	proq	because if you dont then you can just remove the X server and this will drop ubuntu back to cli, perhaps installing the server version or the mini iso's might also be a good idea if you want a lean ubuntu
2010-04-19T10:34:00.000Z	proq	boblemur	yes, thanks.  I need X and I will be running ratpoison
