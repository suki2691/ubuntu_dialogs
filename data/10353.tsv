2011-08-18T20:29:00.000Z	Dulak	HSarena	2.6.34 never got packaged for ubuntu from what I can tell, the closest is .32
2011-08-18T20:31:00.000Z	HSarena	Dulak	what about .37???
2011-08-18T20:31:00.000Z	Dulak	HSarena	nope, .32, .35, .38
2011-08-18T20:32:00.000Z	Dulak	HSarena	the ones missing you'd have to use a vanilla kernel to get, which means you'd be missing a ton of ubuntu/debian kernel patches.
