2006-12-01T13:44:00.000Z	cld2		on 6.10 what linux/kernel package do I need to install to get 686 and SMP support? I have linux-image-generic installed but Im not getting smp support. thanks.
2006-12-01T13:45:00.000Z	soundray	cld2	how have you determined that you have no SMP support?
2007-03-24T09:46:00.000Z	soundray	cld2	I've never seen one of those on a USB device -- only mini PCI.
2007-03-24T09:47:00.000Z	cld2	soundray	you are most likely right. ive only seen them in pcmci and mini pci
