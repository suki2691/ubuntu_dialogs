2006-06-02T12:39:00.000Z	rittyan	Agent_bob	nothing tells me... and /etc/init.d/mldonkey-server executing to the last line w\o any error... and there is nothing in logs...
2006-06-02T12:40:00.000Z	Agent_bob	rittyan	i've never played with that app but most have a debuggung switch.   man mldonkey   and look for debugging    maybe something like  -v   you could add to the startup command.
