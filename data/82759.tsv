2008-09-03T02:41:00.000Z	Bob_Dole		I've hit ctrl+F1, and Ctrl+F2 and my brain might not just be working right, but shouldn't any of the Function(besides F7) take me into console?
2008-09-03T02:42:00.000Z	Bob_Dole		Hmm. Ctrl+alt+various F*'s does noehting either
2008-09-03T02:43:00.000Z	guntbert	Bob_Dole	ACER notebook?
2008-09-03T02:44:00.000Z	guntbert	Bob_Dole	because on my last NB, just ctr+alt+f5 would work, nothing else
