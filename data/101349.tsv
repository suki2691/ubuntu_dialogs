2008-02-04T21:48:00.000Z	tomd		don't make the mistake of keeping windows ;)
2008-02-04T21:50:00.000Z	Plz	tomd	Ubuntu is nice and runs faster then WIndows, but windows still have some function I miss in Ubuntu, like better compability for games and windows programs and the weired sleep mode that fails.
2008-02-04T21:51:00.000Z	tomd	Plz	well, I don't care about games or software suspend, so I'm pretty happy without it. Besides, the more users who migrate to linux the more games that will be developed for it. and it's only a matter of time before the developers hammer out software suspend/hibernation
