2011-05-30T18:03:00.000Z	gabriel_1980		I Installed Ubuntu 11.04 on my Dell Latitude D800, it has a Nvidia 5200 go graphics card, the problem is that the drivers are activated but not in use, how can I fix this? I downloaded th drivers from the Nvidia website
2011-05-30T18:05:00.000Z	gabriel_1980		the drivers from the software center didnt worked, that is why I downloaded the drivers from the Nvidia website
