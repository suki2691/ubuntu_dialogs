2010-11-06T10:03:00.000Z	kiah		hello, I'm new to Ubuntu and ATI.. I just installed Xubuntu, and tried to emulate a nintendo64 ROM which didn't work because it was too laggy. Does that mean I have to switch to the proprietary ATI driver?

2010-11-06T10:05:00.000Z	kiah	ohspite	mind you, i JUST installed xubuntu and haven't played around with xorg or anything
2010-11-06T10:05:00.000Z	kiah	ohspite	i'm thinking it's related to my driver
