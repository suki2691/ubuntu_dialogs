2012-06-11T06:13:00.000Z	BuntZooZoo		How can I set a non-standard 1024x600 resolution?
2012-06-11T06:13:00.000Z	xubuntu5	BuntZooZoo	check out man xrandr
2012-06-11T06:19:00.000Z	BuntZooZoo	xubuntu5	thanks for the xrandr tip.  output from xrandr indicates that the mode I want (1024x600) is currently set...which it isn't.
