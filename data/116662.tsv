2008-01-27T08:06:00.000Z	Jupp2		is there anyway to start Ubuntu in some sort of "verbose" mode to see why my pcmcia card won't let it load?
2008-01-27T08:07:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Jupp2	Yes, remove the 'quiet' parameter from grub
2008-01-27T08:07:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Jupp2	Actually, remove quiet and 'splash'
2008-01-27T08:07:00.000Z	Jupp2	tonyyarusso	thanks!
