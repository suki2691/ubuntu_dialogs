2008-11-20T04:17:00.000Z	isaes		Umm.. I just installed 8.10. After that I installed ati restricted drivers. Got backups from xorg.conf and tried setting dual monitor support with no luck. Now I'd like to get the settings back as they were. Restored xorg.conf, reinstalled fglrx. No luck. Can't get past 1024x768. Is there some other config file that I should erase/modify?
2008-11-20T04:18:00.000Z	isaes		Now, the ubuntu loading bar is in correct resolution (1920x1080).. login screen in dual monitor, and when I log in I get cloned 1024x768. So there's something really odd going on.
