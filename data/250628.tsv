2005-08-23T07:40:00.000Z	azriel0184		ok, i just installed ubuntu, and in the installer i setup two sata drives. well, now when i boot it up it wont boot because it cant find them.
2005-08-23T07:40:00.000Z	azriel0184		any ideas on how to get my ubuntu to recognise my sata drives on boot? my /usr is on one of them, so no way i can boot unless that is mounted
2005-08-23T07:40:00.000Z	azriel0184		i added sata_via to /etc/modules... is there anything else i need to add?
2005-08-23T07:41:00.000Z	guillem	azriel0184	don't know, I have whole ubuntu in sata without trouble
