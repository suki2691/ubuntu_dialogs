I just installed ubuntustudio and I'm trying to get into System > Administration > Network to set up my wireless card, however Network isn't in my list under gnome.  I have the install dvd that I started with, however when I go into synaptic it wants me to connect to the internet.

2008-11-29T00:58:00.000Z	oskar-	Llanowyn	what do you want to do with the internet?
2008-11-29T01:02:00.000Z	oskar-	Llanowyn	it should have been installed. but i also had issues with it crashing in some circumstances. try alt+f2 and then "nm-applet". perhaps then you can use it again
