2007-01-19T10:23:00.000Z	ctkroeker		I cant login anymore with my default account. I tried deleting a bunch of the default gnome hidden files but than makes no diff. what do I do!?
2007-01-19T10:24:00.000Z	andi5	ctkroeker	what does "can't login" mean? ...
2007-01-19T10:26:00.000Z	andi5	ctkroeker	can you choose the "failsafe" session? (maybe the name is a bit different from "failsafe", you need to check that)
2007-01-19T10:26:00.000Z	andi5	ctkroeker	you should never delete files without backing them up, if you do not know for sure how to either resurrect, recreate them or that they are irrelevant
