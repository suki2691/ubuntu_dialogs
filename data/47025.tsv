2009-12-14T03:18:00.000Z	katycorp		I used to have something in my vimrc (or maybe bashrc) that allowed for better mouse integration, such as changing the window size during a split screen, does anyone know what his would have been?
2009-12-14T03:18:00.000Z	trism	katycorp	perhaps set mouse=a
2009-12-14T03:19:00.000Z	katycorp	trism	ah I think that's it, thanks
