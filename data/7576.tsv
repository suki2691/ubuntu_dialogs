2011-12-03T04:16:00.000Z	Exxon	Emiru	why do you have to hit shift..
2011-12-03T04:17:00.000Z	Emiru	Exxon	I dont. But when I did not have grub, after reinstalling Windows, I had to hit shift to choose an OS. But now that everything is ok, I dont hit anything, i get to the boot menu right away, and my question was, can I boot ubuntu without passing through the boot menu
