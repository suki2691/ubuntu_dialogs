2010-10-03T09:15:00.000Z	allen__		Does any one have a triple boot? I have ubuntu and Vista now, but want Fedora also. I'm not sure exactly how to go about it.
2010-10-03T09:17:00.000Z	izinucs	allen__	you can but if you're just checking it out run it in virtualbox

2010-10-03T09:19:00.000Z	allen__	izinucs	Thanks. Yup I've already done that, and like what I saw.
