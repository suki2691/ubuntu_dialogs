2006-12-13T09:10:00.000Z	robdeman		I have a question: a lot of my Ubuntu menu items disappeared. FOr example the add/remove software thing and a whole lot of system->Administration icons
2006-12-13T09:11:00.000Z	lewyjh	robdeman	run this command in the terminal, "killall gnome-panel" it'll restart it.
2006-12-13T09:18:00.000Z	robdeman	lewyjh	I did that but now my VNC viewe show only the Ubuntu backdrop picture. No new pnales are being restarted?
