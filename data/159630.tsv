2009-02-24T06:27:00.000Z	yuri_	Iceman_B^Ltop	type in transmission &. set up the web ui in the options first
2009-02-24T06:32:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	yuri_	how do I set up the web uit first through a cli ?
2009-02-24T06:34:00.000Z	yuri_	Iceman_B^Ltop	go to the transmission website and get their repos. there is a "transmissioncli" package. also, go to the transmission channel. also, see if you can manually edit the config file in transmission through a text editor
