2005-09-23T16:53:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		 i've found the pattern.  every time i update (or downgrade) my kernel, i have to poke around to get sound working again.
2005-09-23T16:53:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		there's no obvious method.  i just restart esd several times, try to switch xmms to use different devices, cause some stuff to crash, and eventually it works again permanently, until the next kernel change.
2005-09-23T05:05:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER		is there any way to "reset" alsa?
2005-09-23T05:06:00.000Z	keith-	BROKEN_LADDER	do you have non-stock drivers for your soundcard?
