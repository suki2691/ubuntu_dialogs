2007-12-02T01:45:00.000Z	Orakio		I'm trying to get the TNT2 to work with ubuntu, it works with X11 in that it works with the nvidia driver selected. I installed legacy. I have enabled it with the n-g-c e command but when trying to run something like critical mass it reports cannot find glx visual, anyone know why? anything special that needs to be done for glx to work?
2007-12-02T01:46:00.000Z	beerfa1	Orakio	TNT2 is super old and glx won't be supported
2007-12-02T01:48:00.000Z	beerfa1	Orakio	does it run those on windows? TNT2 doesn't support pixel shading used by modern games
2007-12-02T01:49:00.000Z	beerfa1	Orakio	no. Ubuntu is debian+
