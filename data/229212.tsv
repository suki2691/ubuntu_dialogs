2006-01-26T17:11:00.000Z	ufk		i installed ubuntu, and i have a geforce onboard gfx card that i don't use, and a pci s3virge card installed that i do use. when i start ubuntu, x detects the nvidia card and yells that it doesn't find the driver. how can i set so it will ignore that card? i don't see any disable option in the bios
