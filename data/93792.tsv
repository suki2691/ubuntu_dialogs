Surely new users would have no idea it was waiting for that, so this is a bug.  What package or config setting did I add that is making it do this?

I'll report this as new users could easily stumble into this if they click around installing insteresting looking packages.  I tend to prefer the command line but was trying out the Update Manager since it prompted me to upgrade.
