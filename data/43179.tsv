2009-11-09T05:09:00.000Z	davidkarr	IdleOne	I understand, but the choices are a little too complicated at this point. I'll live with the vanilla install for now.
2009-11-09T05:10:00.000Z	IdleOne	davidkarr	that is fine :) just wanted to inform you. I would recommend regular backups of your important files
2009-11-09T05:11:00.000Z	davidkarr	IdleOne	Yeah, I grok backups. I'm a long time Unix/Windows user.
