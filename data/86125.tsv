2010-01-18T03:53:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss		I attempted to upgrade Grub to Grub2. Since upgrading, whenever I boot my system Grub displays Error 15 and hangs. I can't boot into any OS, and at the moment I'm using a Live CD. Has anybody had this error, or can anybody help?

2010-01-18T03:55:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	Tartaros	I have tried browsing the internet for solutions. Since I'm a novice, none make any sense.
