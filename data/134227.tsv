2007-05-21T07:41:00.000Z	RivaeAerya	VSpike	oh... well, weird... my monitor hasn't altered either
2007-05-21T07:42:00.000Z	VSpike	RivaeAerya	have you tried powering down the monitor?  Also check the vga connector.  Then restart the server.  If all else fails, you can override the monitor detection and specify the data yourself
2007-05-21T07:44:00.000Z	RivaeAerya	VSpike	I powered down the monitor, and turned it back on. No difference. I did notice the monitor was off when i came back, but that could've been my mom
