2010-08-23T22:33:00.000Z	dot-slaSh		Hey guys, I'm interested in performing some network data transfer and speed tests, can anyone recommend some tools or ideas of how to obtain speed metrics to show management? I really only know of running '$ time {sftp|ftp|svn|git}' commands to show time of transfer downloads. Any thoughts/ideas?
