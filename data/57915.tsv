2009-09-05T21:41:00.000Z	clarezoe		hi, I got error "configure: error: curl-7.19.2 is required", can anyone tell me what is the package for it? I've already have libcurl-dev installed
2009-09-05T21:42:00.000Z	fccf	clarezoe	do you have curl installed .. you might have the dev's but you need the binary's too
2009-09-05T21:44:00.000Z	fccf	clarezoe	uh, apt-get install curl ... it isn't installed by default
2009-09-05T21:45:00.000Z	clarezoe	fccf	OK, now curl is installed, but stillt he same error "curl-7.19.2 is required"
