2012-09-30T13:12:00.000Z	nibbler	kostkon	its all resolved.... thanks for your comment anyway.... was just complaining about the out-of-the-box bugs of 12.04.x alternate installer
2012-09-30T13:13:00.000Z	kostkon	nibbler	no prob. althoug, i am not sure it was a bug. nevertheless, i hope you enjoy 12.04 :)
