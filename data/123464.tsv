2008-03-12T19:27:00.000Z	iDN		Anyway a moue problem this time. Something I've been looking for solution for a long, long time.
2008-03-12T19:29:00.000Z	iDN		Over a year ago I bought a laser mouse, Logitech MX400. From day one I've noticed that in games, such as ET, the mouse is erratic while moved fast. For example, while moving the mouse sharply left, it moves left a bit and then go wildly and erratically to other side. Anyone had this problem or somehow know how to solve it? Thank you.
