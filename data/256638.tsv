2012-06-27T12:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	StarryNight	 more of a filesystem limitation  and kernel limit. ;) not a ubuntu limit.
2012-06-27T12:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	StarryNight	 ext4 is like... huge. :) id have to refer to the wiki page on ext4 its most likely listed there.
2012-06-27T12:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	StarryNight	 ive had like  5+ 3TB external USB hds attatched to same ubuntu box. ;)
