2010-05-03T08:53:00.000Z	gavagai		So basically I need to install K3B to burn a flac audio cd, is that about right?
2010-05-03T08:54:00.000Z	acicula	gavagai	audio cd's are always in wav format
2010-05-03T08:54:00.000Z	acicula	gavagai	any like brasero or k3b will probably convert the files before burning them
2010-05-03T08:54:00.000Z	gavagai	acicula	brasero gives error, rhythmbox fails silently
