2008-07-08T02:22:00.000Z	idx		So I'm not using Ubuntu anymore. It worked fine until about two months ago, possibly after an update, after which it failed to recognise my Buffalo Wireless-G USB Adapter which had been working perfectly beforehand. Ideas, please?

2008-07-08T02:24:00.000Z	idx	beautifulsnow	Sadly, no
