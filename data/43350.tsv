2009-11-07T01:07:00.000Z	PITA1		Hi All, I've been trying to download b0146b3d658d2471c7d4e9e43d32f24431d5a9bf ubuntu-9.10-desktop-powerpc+ps3.iso torrent for 2 days now, and nothing happens. I've got the normal 9.10 32 and 64bit cd's to download via bittorrent, but the PS3 one does not want to budge, not one bit.
2009-11-07T01:08:00.000Z	lstarnes	PITA1	do you have any peers that are seeding it?
2009-11-07T01:08:00.000Z	PITA1		4 seeds 1 peer
2009-11-07T01:09:00.000Z	PITA1	lstarnes	 I have other torrents working fine with local and remote peers including the 32bit cd and the 64bit cd, so I have access to the torrents
