2008-11-18T21:42:00.000Z	roadfish		is it possible to make repositories that aren't signed without gpg keys? and does this cause the "packages cannot be authenticated!" message from apt-get?
2008-11-18T21:42:00.000Z	maek0	roadfish	yeah
2008-11-18T21:43:00.000Z	maek0	roadfish	theres a few popular un authenticated repos like the transmission one
2008-11-18T21:43:00.000Z	roadfish	maek0	ok, thanks ... so is unreasonable to eliminate all not-authenticated errors (assuming I want things from unsigned repos)
