2010-05-01T08:00:00.000Z	taroven	Raspe	TLDR version of what arand linked = You need admin access to write to things outside your home directory, in most cases. If you're coming from Windows Vista or 7, think of it like you're trying to change a file in your Program Files - It doesn't let you without a password.
