2008-08-22T06:41:00.000Z	ak-49		could someone maybe offer some insight as to why flash videos are very choppy on my system? divx and mpgs look fine.
2008-08-22T06:41:00.000Z	ak-49		also it seems to be inconsistent
2008-08-22T06:42:00.000Z	ak-49		i could reboot my system and it would probably go away for 3/4 of the day
2008-08-22T06:43:00.000Z	cskmax	ak-49	are you on the official flash plugin, the non-free one?
