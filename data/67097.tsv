2009-02-04T15:00:00.000Z	timahvo1	AdvoWork	can install nmap and try doing sudo nmap -sP <ip range> or something like that
2009-02-04T15:13:00.000Z	AdvoWork	timahvo1	tried that, just says the ip is up, thats it, any other ideas?
2009-02-04T15:15:00.000Z	timahvo1	AdvoWork	beats me, I would make sure I have /etc/network/interfaces right then restart networking and see what it tells you
2009-02-04T15:15:00.000Z	timahvo1	AdvoWork	ther than that can't be of more help
