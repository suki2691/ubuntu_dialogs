2008-05-21T08:54:00.000Z	AzMoo	The-Bleh-Bleh	No, but it does usually imply somebody's run over it with something.
2008-05-21T08:55:00.000Z	The-Bleh-Bleh	AzMoo	The thing is, it's brand new.  35 feet though.
2008-05-21T08:58:00.000Z	AzMoo	The-Bleh-Bleh	Nope, doesn't matter, although it's usually good to conform to the standard.
