2010-07-30T03:44:00.000Z	C-Otto		i am an administrator of an ubuntu mirror, providing files with up to 10 GBit/sec - I'd like to know if there is some geoip based (or something other) automated download distribution when you use 'apt-get install'?
2010-07-30T03:44:00.000Z	C-Otto		or, if not, do users have to pick their mirror by hand?
2010-07-30T03:45:00.000Z	linxeh	C-Otto	it does pick a source, but I dont know the algorithm - I guess based on the location you give for time settings, might be geoip though
