2006-06-23T13:32:00.000Z	Chousuke		I'm constantly tempted to try this open WLAN that reaches my room from somewhere.
2006-06-23T13:33:00.000Z	mngrif	Chousuke	 someone just got arrested for using someone else's open WLAN where I live, be careful!
2006-06-23T13:34:00.000Z	Chousuke	mngrif	I wonder how they could find out who I am :D
2006-06-23T13:34:00.000Z	mngrif	Chousuke	 in this case it was obvious, they were a registered sex offender so they knocked at his door first. got lucky. he wasn't doing anything illegal over the network though, the owner of the WLAN called it in to the police instead of bothering to block the MAC
