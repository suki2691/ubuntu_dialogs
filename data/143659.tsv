2009-11-02T18:32:00.000Z	rjonesx		Hi, I just upgraded to 9.10. Unfortunately, the Wi-Fi no longer works at all and the Video Card is performing below-par. In the past, I have been able to just turn on restricted drivers, but the new install doesn't seem to find any. Do I need to go somewhere and get the restricted nvidia, etc. drivers?
