2009-05-19T01:02:00.000Z	schambers		i have installed xubuntu 9.04 on my lenovo w500 laptop. i get audio controls, everything is unmuted, but no sound
2009-05-19T01:04:00.000Z	tommacco	schambers	are you using gnome?
2009-05-19T01:04:00.000Z	tommacco	schambers	i was having trouble with audio myself, specifically with alsa.  I switched over to OSS and everything works fine
2009-05-19T01:06:00.000Z	tommacco	schambers	okay, i'm not sure about a specific utility to switch from alsa to oss besides the gnome sound options, i've been removed from linux for far too many years
