2007-07-05T09:46:00.000Z	n3rrd		I've searched around to find opinions, but I figured I might ask here... what do people here use for their music?
2007-07-05T09:47:00.000Z	ssn	n3rrd	mpd & ncmpc
2007-07-05T09:56:00.000Z	n3rrd	ssn	are you using mpd currently?
2007-07-05T10:09:00.000Z	n3rrd	ssn	recommended mpd as a good option for audio playback, does anyone else have any experience with it?
