2007-09-24T14:42:00.000Z	LoneShadow		is there a default xorg.conf ?
2007-09-24T14:43:00.000Z	BigDaddy	LoneShadow	there will be a default for your system, but not a general default for everyone
2007-09-24T14:44:00.000Z	LoneShadow	BigDaddy	so If I dont have a good backup of xorg.conf, I will to fix to things manually ?
