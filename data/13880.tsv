2011-05-25T22:03:00.000Z	abax		has somebody figured out how it's possible to disable opening program menu by F10 in unity? or change it to <Ctrl>F10. i've looked from system settings -> keyboard shortcuts, but it wasn't there, and i've also gone to gconf-editor and changed all the places that have F10 to <Ctrl>F10, and i've restarted Xorg, but no effect.
