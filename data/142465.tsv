2007-03-20T10:21:00.000Z	khaoshizon		hi, im running beryl and when i ran gnome-settings-daemon &, there was an alert whether i should use X or gnome settings. i clicked dont warn me again but accidentally clicked gnome settings instead of X. can anyone tell me how I could edit it to use X?
2007-03-20T10:23:00.000Z	khaoshizon		or at least for it to show the error message again?
2007-03-20T10:24:00.000Z	locke	khaoshizon	could you reinstall it?
2007-03-20T10:25:00.000Z	khaoshizon	locke	i dont think that'll help since i screwed the option of gnome-settings-daemon, not beryl :/
