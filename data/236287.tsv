2005-09-06T06:04:00.000Z	koneng		i've been trying to get my ipod (windows formatted 4rth gen w/ USB 2.0) to work. I was able to detect/add an album using gtkpod. My only problem was successfully unmounting it (w/o "Do Not Disconnect.." message). I used 'sudo eject /dev/sda', which finally worked. Everything looks okay, except that my podcasts are gone:/ Any advice so this won't happen again?
