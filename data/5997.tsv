2012-02-02T05:39:00.000Z	Candlehawk		Hi, I have a slight issue. I am running xubuntu 11.10, and just realised I can not "su" as I wasn't able to set my root password on install. How do I find out what my root password is?
2012-02-02T05:39:00.000Z	flowerpot	Candlehawk	use sudo
2012-02-02T05:40:00.000Z	flowerpot	Candlehawk	if you really must set password for root then try using sudo passwd
2012-02-02T05:44:00.000Z	Candlehawk	flowerpot	I suppose in many situations that may be the case, I just like to have the option. Then again, I prefer aptitude over apt-get, so my opinion has strayed from Ubuntu before.
