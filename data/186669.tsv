It appears to not be a problem with ubuntu specifically, because it happens (i log in, but it redirects me to login again) on windows as well as other browsers. i've rebooted my router etc, but that hasnt helped.

2010-10-24T20:39:00.000Z	rigel	ikonia	they didnt sound like they were getting a lot of help requests, so i'm assuming the problem is on my segment of the network
2010-10-24T20:39:00.000Z	ikonia	rigel	give them a nudge then
