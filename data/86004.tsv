2008-12-05T07:11:00.000Z	hou5ton		I think i'll dual boot Ubuntu on this vista laptop .... how many GB does Ubuntu need to have plenty of room to work, applications, etc.?
2008-12-05T07:12:00.000Z	Akeru_Forsamee	hou5ton	Depends on how many apps you want. A usual  Ubuntu install takes less than 1gb, and I assume the rest would just depend on how much room you want to work with

2008-12-05T07:16:00.000Z	Akeru_Forsamee	hou5ton	Good luck :)
