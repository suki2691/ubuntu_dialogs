2008-07-27T09:18:00.000Z	soul_786	guren	will gparted do both a fat32 partition and a ext2? Or just the ext2 because its linux?
2008-07-27T09:20:00.000Z	soul_786	guren	and making those partition changes on gparted will work for the usb flash drive? I've only used gparted on partitioning an HD
2008-07-27T09:21:00.000Z	soul_786	guren	Alright I'll give it a try and finger's crossed it'll work! =) thanks
