2010-01-10T21:07:00.000Z	Armok		Hi, I'm installing a new harddrive in a few hours and I'm going to make it a Windows XP/Ubuntu duble booting system, but I have a few questions I havn't got an adequate answere for, so I thought I might have to go to an actual Ubunty chanel to get such, and here I am
2010-01-10T21:07:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	Armok	ask the question
2010-01-10T21:13:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	Armok	give me a minute, i can find a site that has open source alternatives to windows programs
2010-01-10T21:15:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	Armok	try GNOME and KDE first
