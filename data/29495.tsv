2010-07-04T03:34:00.000Z	darkas		I'm having a problem with my touchpad (netbook, ubuntu 10.4 netbook remix): it seems that synaptics doesn't like my touchpad: http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/64TE3nta (important part of /var/log/Xorg.0.log)
2010-07-04T03:35:00.000Z	megra	darkas	your touchpad works or not ? The logs seems fine till line 50
2010-07-04T03:36:00.000Z	darkas	megra	it works, but only like a mouse
2010-07-04T03:40:00.000Z	darkas	megra	the problem is that none of the configuration I do is applied to my touchpad
