2012-06-09T07:53:00.000Z	Jester86_Mobile	chu	that doesn't work does it?  I believe terminal only shows the desktop background when transparent - I don't believe it shows windows / applications that are open in the backdrop
2012-06-09T07:54:00.000Z	chu	Jester86_Mobile	I don't use transparency myself, so I couldn't tell you.
