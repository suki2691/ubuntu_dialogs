2008-11-29T06:58:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	cxo	not directly. you have to do a new install. but you may be able to keep your /home
2008-11-29T06:59:00.000Z	cxo	zsquareplusc	so how does that work? Does it keep all my settings?
2008-11-29T07:00:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	cxo	most applications you run have their settings in /home and are likely to work so, yes. system settings are in /etc but i wouldn't use that directly (backup for reference only)
