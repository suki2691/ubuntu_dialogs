2006-02-25T08:08:00.000Z	Nogimics		Can anyone tell me why when I use putty to connect to my 1 shell filetypes are distinguished by colour codes but not on my ubuntu box when i ssh in with putty?
2006-02-25T08:08:00.000Z	mister_roboto	Nogimics	different terminal type?
2006-02-25T08:09:00.000Z	Nogimics	mister_roboto	What do you mean by that pls? One is ubuntu one is Linux but just wondering how I can get PuTTy to recognise filetypes by colour on both
2006-02-25T08:12:00.000Z	mister_roboto	Nogimics	I thought you might be running a different terminal type in your configuration and that could be disallowing the colors (echo $TERM) when logged on. I have no idea, just guess
