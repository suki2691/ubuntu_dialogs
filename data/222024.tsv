2005-12-31T06:52:00.000Z	Bateau_		hey! i get this weird error doing apt-get update: "The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY E8DDB29170188C3B".
2005-12-31T06:53:00.000Z	Bateau_		how can i fix this?
2005-12-31T06:53:00.000Z	Stormx2	Bateau_	Its just a security thing. Recently added a repo?
2005-12-31T06:54:00.000Z	Stormx2	Bateau_	Odd. Well, personally I'd ignore it. All it is saying is it hasn't got the signiture for one of your repos, but if you know what repos you have, don't worry about it.
