2010-01-24T14:17:00.000Z	Noiano		guys I see the package "firefox-3.6" is present in repositories but it has no installation candidate...will it be fixed in your opinion? (ubuntu 9.10)
2010-01-24T14:18:00.000Z	Myrtti	Noiano	you've got something broken. ff 3.6 will not officially be in 9.10.
2010-01-24T14:19:00.000Z	Noiano	Myrtti	what a pity
