2009-07-27T08:46:00.000Z	darthanubis	macgyver_	noone can tell anyting from "what is up?"
2009-07-27T08:48:00.000Z	macgyver_	darthanubis	I did ask earlier, so I want just throwing a n00bie out there :)
2009-07-27T08:49:00.000Z	macgyver_	darthanubis	I think  might just run through the install again (no biggie) and see where it disappears
