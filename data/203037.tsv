2005-12-28T11:27:00.000Z	cafuego	robnyc`	I doubt most people who know what chroot is would elect to have anything to do with reiser4.
2005-12-28T11:28:00.000Z	robnyc`	cafuego	dont doubt that
2005-12-28T11:28:00.000Z	robnyc`	cafuego	would u know if reiser4 support is built-in the kernel or any ubuntu kernel ?
