2010-03-10T19:31:00.000Z	trijntje	sambagirlx	no, but you can upgrade from hardy ro the next version
2010-03-10T19:34:00.000Z	trijntje	sambagirlx	you have to wait untill april till the next version is released
2010-03-10T19:35:00.000Z	trijntje	sambagirlx	than you can just run the update without needing a cd
