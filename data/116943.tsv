2009-01-26T02:06:00.000Z	Mechdave	sdf	you need a smp kernel, you may have to compile your own, or upgrade to 8.10 which has a smp kernel standard
2009-01-26T02:07:00.000Z	sdf	Mechdave	: 6.06 donot support SMP on i368 system ?
2009-01-26T02:09:00.000Z	Mechdave	sdf	yes it does but I don't know if Ubuntu still do a pre rolled smp kernel
