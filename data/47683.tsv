2010-02-23T12:48:00.000Z	babbio		i have a problem....at office I'm behind a proxy server, so i need to setup all the program to authenticate via the proxy and when i come back to home I have to remove the proxy configuration and I have to do this every single days....so i would like to know if there is a configuration file in wich I could insert the proxy configuration so that i could make a script to do it automatically....is this possible?
