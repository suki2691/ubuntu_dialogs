2007-01-28T16:54:00.000Z	Tatster		I just wanted to say I installed my first Ubuntu box - had a bit of a nightmare getting it installed, but now it's running - I'm loving it!
2007-01-28T16:55:00.000Z	bimberi	Tatster	That's no good.  And great! ;-)
2007-01-28T16:56:00.000Z	Tatster	bimberi	- yep.  LiveCD wouldn't run, and eventually after finding an acpi=force option had to install in Text mode
2007-01-28T16:56:00.000Z	bimberi	Tatster	ah kk.  Well done on your persistence.
