2008-09-17T20:33:00.000Z	elexodus		Need help with Samba. My Vista Box can see my Ubuntu box, but Samba won't authenticate the login. I am using username "HappyTrees/elexodus" as my username (Server/Uname), and of course the password I set up using 'smbpasswd'. Any ideas?

2008-09-17T20:35:00.000Z	elexodus	bobertdos	what?
