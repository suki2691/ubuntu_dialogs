2010-09-04T23:37:00.000Z	Dj_Deutschi		does somewone knows if there is an API or service for searching .deb packages descriptions
2010-09-04T23:38:00.000Z	Dj_Deutschi		I use it for a irc bot, and till now the bot was using apt-cache since it was on Ubuntu machine, but now I moved it to opensuse server ... and there is no apt-cache
2010-09-04T23:39:00.000Z	BrianE	Dj_Deutschi	There likely aren't any APIs out there for doing it, no
