2007-02-23T12:23:00.000Z	Roscar		Hi, I'm replaceing my ati radeon with a nvidia geforce. I'm running the open ati driver. Is there anything I need to do before I powerdown and swap the hardware? Or will ubuntu detect the changed hardware and edit Xorg.conf for me?

2007-02-23T12:24:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Roscar	that's what ubuntu does to configure it first time
2007-02-23T12:24:00.000Z	Roscar	wolfeySI	ok, thanks. wish me luck!
