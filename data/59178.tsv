2010-02-09T22:18:00.000Z	brandonban6		so today, compiz just decided not to load... and I can't figure out where to even begin troubleshooting. I run compiz --replace and it it sort of wigs out for a second like it's trying to load, but then doesn't. Any thoughts on where to start?
2010-02-09T22:19:00.000Z	VCoolio	brandonban6	any useful output if you do compiz --replace in a terminal?
2010-02-09T22:21:00.000Z	brandonban6	VCoolio	I run that, it gives some errors such Xgl: not present, xset q doesn't reveal the location of the log file. Using fall back .. xorg... , checking for from pixmap: not present, aborting and using fall back, which is metacity
2010-02-09T22:24:00.000Z	VCoolio	brandonban6	can you open ccsm? what if you reset compiz to default?
