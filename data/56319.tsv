2009-12-16T12:31:00.000Z	aquarius	MikeChelen	try running the Tracker Search Tool
2009-12-16T12:34:00.000Z	MikeChelen	aquarius	does tracker support full text search of documents? gonna give it a try, thanks
2009-12-16T12:37:00.000Z	aquarius	MikeChelen	yep, it does support that. Applications > Accessories > Tracker Search Tool. You may need to turn on indexing if it's not already turned on (it is on by default, I believe): System > Preferences > Search and Indexing
