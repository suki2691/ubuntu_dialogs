2006-07-01T16:13:00.000Z	liquiem	goonies	try g-w-d :) or tell us your problem
2006-07-01T16:14:00.000Z	goonies	liquiem	im trying to use compiz and xgl, but everytime i run gnome-window-decorator it restarts x, i previously made it run b4 without a problem, now all the sudden it just keeps restarting my x when i try it
2006-07-01T16:15:00.000Z	liquiem	goonies	start g-w-d after compiz --replace gconf &. if that's not the problem, be sure you use compiz-gnome (dont recall the package name exactly)
