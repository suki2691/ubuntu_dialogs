2006-06-22T07:32:00.000Z	vanberge		is it normal for ubuntu to be slow at initializing network connectivity??  i.e. i cant start my browser for 1-3 minutes after i log into the system?
2006-06-22T07:33:00.000Z	DBO	vanberge	nope, thats not very normal at all
2006-06-22T07:33:00.000Z	vanberge	tritium	DBO, any ideas on what might cause that?
2006-06-22T07:34:00.000Z	DBO	vanberge	sounds like dhcp not playing nice
