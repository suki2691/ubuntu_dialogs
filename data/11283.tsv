2012-07-09T21:31:00.000Z	soulnafein		Hello, how can I upgrade right now to ubuntu kernel 3.2.0-27? I'm running 3.2.0-26
2012-07-09T21:32:00.000Z	auronandace	soulnafein	when was 27 released?
2012-07-09T21:32:00.000Z	soulnafein	auronandace	I'm not sure. Someone mentioned it in a bug report stating that the bug was fixed in that version.
2012-07-09T21:34:00.000Z	auronandace	soulnafein	the latest i can see is 26, so maybe you need to wait for the mirrors to update
