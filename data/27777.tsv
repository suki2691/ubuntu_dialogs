2011-01-17T13:14:00.000Z	Bluefever		My primary and only operating system right now is Ubuntu 10.10, a while back I wiped my hard disk and did a fresh install. However, now I want to play some games that only fair well on windows so I want to install Windows 7. What I want to know is how can I make a partition for Windows, say about 40GB, and also have Ubuntu as my Primary. Also, I'm somewhat of a novice.
