2007-11-08T00:14:00.000Z	Calin24	elliotjhug	very easy... just mv /home /home2, mkdir /home, mount the new drive as /home and cp -R /home2/* /home
2007-11-08T00:14:00.000Z	Calin24		I just did it this morning changing my /home from local to a raid 5 partition
2007-11-08T00:15:00.000Z	elliotjhug	Calin24	Thanks alot :) - I'll keep a note of that.
