2006-03-13T08:44:00.000Z	intelikey		yes well schnable purge the package first then install the unbroken
2006-03-13T08:45:00.000Z	schnable	intelikey	what do you mean install the unbroken?
2006-03-13T08:48:00.000Z	intelikey	schnable	just got here but was building on the "<pestilence> i3dmaster, but shouldn't  a dpkg -i install of the package re-do the configuration?"   <-- not unless you purge the old install....
