2009-02-26T11:31:00.000Z	Chaorain		I have a standard ubuntu install and I want to install software from my Ubuntu UE dvd. How can I do this?

2009-02-26T11:36:00.000Z	Chaorain	n8tuser	I found lots of .deb but I don't see everything. Would I be able to use Synaptic?
2009-02-26T11:37:00.000Z	n8tuser	Chaorain	-> dont know, maybe if the dvd is on the sources.list ? i never tried it myself
