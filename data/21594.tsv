2011-07-26T13:25:00.000Z	auscompgeek		Hey guys, I'm having a problem installing Natty.
2011-07-26T13:26:00.000Z	auscompgeek		It always gives me an error message saying "the installer has encountered an unrecoverable error"
2011-07-26T13:27:00.000Z	dc5ala	auscompgeek	that's not really a helpful error message. Have you checked for console output on one of the ttys?
2011-07-26T13:29:00.000Z	auscompgeek	dc5ala	can't see any error messages on the tty when I press ok
