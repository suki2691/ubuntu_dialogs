2007-10-29T20:13:00.000Z	vegananarchist		I really need help, i have less than an hour to get my paper out of the computer that it is currenlty in. I just updated to xubuntu 7.10 and now the cd drives nor the usb ports will mount and it will not connect to the internet. I need one of these three things to get working so i can get my paper off the computer.
