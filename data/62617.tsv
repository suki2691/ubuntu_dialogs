2010-04-13T22:52:00.000Z	jaysern-w		what is the upgrade path to go from Hardy Heron 8.04 LTS to the latest stable desktop Ubuntu (would that be Maverick Meerkat?)
2010-04-13T22:53:00.000Z	jaysern-w		i see. i can wait for the freshest version. so I can go straight from hardy heron to lucid lynx ?
2010-04-13T22:54:00.000Z	jaysern-w		someone mentioned i need to upgrade to an intermediate step before, but i wasn't sure why that was
2010-04-13T22:54:00.000Z	iceroot	jaysern-w	you can update directly on release day
