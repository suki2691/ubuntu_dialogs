2010-06-25T21:44:00.000Z	livingdaylight		I have a question about removing wine
2010-06-25T21:45:00.000Z	livingdaylight		although I completely removed wine using synaptic folders are still showing in menu. Also there seem to be confiuration files which synaptic doesn't remove, even though I have stipulated 'complete' purge
2010-06-25T21:45:00.000Z	livingdaylight		It would be nice to be able to remove an application without having to go all over the filesystem looking for folders, especially when one doesn't know which or where!
2010-06-25T21:46:00.000Z	durt	livingdaylight	removing the windows apps data automatically would be a bad thing.
