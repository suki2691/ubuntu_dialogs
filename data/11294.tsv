2012-10-06T11:53:00.000Z	jnm		Hello, why doesn't the installer's partition editor set /boot on a fat file system?
2012-10-06T11:53:00.000Z	jnm		It only shows /dos and /windows mountpoints.
2012-10-06T11:53:00.000Z	auronandace	jnm	boot should be on a linux filesystem
2012-10-06T11:55:00.000Z	auronandace	jnm	fat doesn't handle linux permissions
