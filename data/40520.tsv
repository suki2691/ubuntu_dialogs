2010-07-27T06:18:00.000Z	Jawalt		Is there a way to reinstall Ubuntu from an installation of Ubuntu? I am looking to have Ubuntu just like a fresh install.
2010-07-27T06:20:00.000Z	Jawalt		I just want a clean installation of Ubuntu. I'm not exactly sure what I've done to be honest. I've got a couple errors upon updates and such. Just want a clean slate.
2010-07-27T06:20:00.000Z	Jawalt		Problem is I don't have a USB drive, and my netbook doesn't read CDs.
2010-07-27T06:20:00.000Z	hiexpo	Jawalt	 than do a fresh install with cd
