2007-12-10T03:05:00.000Z	MasterShrek	chuck	what is available?
2007-12-10T03:06:00.000Z	chuck	MasterShrek	linux-generic, linux-image-generic, linux-image-2.6.22-14-generic, or none
2007-12-10T03:07:00.000Z	MasterShrek	chuck	i think you want to use linux-generic, that and linux-image-generic are both meta packages i think
