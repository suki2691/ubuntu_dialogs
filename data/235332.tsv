2005-05-28T16:01:00.000Z	Pupeno	HappyFool	that's a possible alternative, I want something more integrated on the system. I believe /usr/local/ exists for that purpose.
2005-05-28T16:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	Pupeno	yeah, but you never need to sudo / su anything. i feel that my system is fairly 'safe' if i work in my home dir
2005-05-28T16:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	Pupeno	obviously this is of no use if more than one user needs the stuff
