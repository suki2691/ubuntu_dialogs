2011-04-04T19:36:00.000Z	MoMo2		I have a large amount of .rar archives.  Is there a way to enumerate all their contents into a file so i can see everything that is archived, but not actually unpack anything?

2011-04-04T19:37:00.000Z	ayecee_	MoMo2	rar/unrar almost certainly has a "test" option that will show the contents and verify the package integrity, does that help?
2011-04-04T19:38:00.000Z	MoMo2	ayecee_	i might be able to make some magic from that -- thx
