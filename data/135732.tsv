2007-04-30T13:17:00.000Z	dondaielo222		Hey, I got some question. Although I installed nvidia drivers and set mode "1280x1024" in xorg.conf I can only get  1024x768...whats wrong?
2007-04-30T13:18:00.000Z	Pelo	dondaielo222	 you might need to edit xorg.conf to manualy add the extra resolutions you want
