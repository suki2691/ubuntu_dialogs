2012-04-19T23:21:00.000Z	mizifih		Hi there. I have this 1.2TB NTFS drive that Windows 7 can access but Ubuntu 12.04 can't. It's almost full. Gparted is listing the disk, but don't recognizes the partitions/filesystem. I have another one with the same manufacturer/model and it's working fine
2012-04-19T23:21:00.000Z	mizifih		oops, it's 2TB (1.8TB)
