2009-03-15T22:24:00.000Z	DasEi	|Kamen|	does the drive wind up ? does a earphone get sound ?
2009-03-15T22:25:00.000Z	|Kamen|	DasEi	wasnt my problem, I dunno. was just throwing out a thought on someone elses trouble
2009-03-15T22:26:00.000Z	DasEi	|Kamen|	so no sure answer is possible: if the ide-cable is attached, it depends on the config on that machine , if ubu 'blocks' manual access, else it should work, but why would you do that ?
