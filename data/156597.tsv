2007-02-01T15:25:00.000Z	kupesoft		I just attempted to install ubuntu by resizing an existing NTFS partition.  GParted crashed and when I rebooted to Windows it said it was repairing the drive.  Everything is fine, but Windows is reporting the the NTFS partition is the same size as it was before the resize but the amount of data stored on it is the amount it was *plus* the size of the would-be new partition.  What should I do?
