2009-08-23T10:58:00.000Z	ccb0x45		ok... so I have figured out every time I install nvidia-glx-180 its breaks X very badly... so how am I supposed to install nvidia drivers?
2009-08-23T10:59:00.000Z	ccb0x45		9400gt.... and I am not sure but I think it might be doing something cause there is an onboard nvidia card too on there..
2009-08-23T10:59:00.000Z	ccb0x45		ill try 173, I was thinking about that...
2009-08-23T11:00:00.000Z	shamm	ccb0x45	I use 173, it's stable so far.
