2010-04-11T01:11:00.000Z	mertle	brontosaurusrex	not too weird - it will be slow to start as the kdelibs will have to be loaded
2010-04-11T01:12:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	mertle	should be stable once going?
2010-04-11T01:12:00.000Z	mertle	brontosaurusrex	sure - the kdelibs should be installed as deps but it should be fine
