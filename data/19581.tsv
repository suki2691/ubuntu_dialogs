2011-06-28T14:28:00.000Z	MagePsycho		can anyone tell me how to delete all tables within a db
2011-06-28T14:28:00.000Z	MagePsycho		fyi, my db has 400 tables
2011-06-28T14:28:00.000Z	Starminn	MagePsycho	Maybe DROP * ?
2011-06-28T14:30:00.000Z	Starminn	MagePsycho	Only way wild card would make sense is DROP TABLE * I think but I don't know if that would work.
