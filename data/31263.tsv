2012-05-22T02:32:00.000Z	iLogical		I have this problem. I am using nvidia proprietary drivers but it doesn't show up in "Hardware Drives". When I turned to free ones I had one problem I don't remember but it rendered the system unusable. So, I get this black screen, and I go ctrl+f6, ctrl+f7 to get it back. This combination of steps are the only way I can get it back. The problem is that everytime I get it back it gets black again. And sometimes it goes away, sometimes not, then
