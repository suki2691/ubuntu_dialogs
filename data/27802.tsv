2010-08-07T03:41:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	kentr	client side or server side?
2010-08-07T03:44:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	kentr	Um....so you're trying to ping the server, but you get nothing back - just a hang?
2010-08-07T03:45:00.000Z	kentr	YankDownUnder	yes.  Ultimately, I'm trying to wget from an ftp server.  But ping, ftp, and wget all fail to reach the server from this particular machine.  Works fine from other machines.
