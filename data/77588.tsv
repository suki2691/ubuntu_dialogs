2009-08-14T09:22:00.000Z	HellMind		where I should specify the DISPLAY var for a single user?
2009-08-14T09:23:00.000Z	losher	HellMind	it's usually set automatically. What are you trying to do?
2009-08-14T09:25:00.000Z	losher	HellMind	it's just a shell variable. Set it in .bashrc or manually in the shell...
2009-08-14T09:27:00.000Z	losher	HellMind	how do you start your virtual xserver? Is it vnc or something else?
