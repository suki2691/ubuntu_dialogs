2006-04-19T10:24:00.000Z	Android_D		I am trying to compile a run a simple C program in ubuntu.  It is so simple that it contatins a main method and a printf line.  I can compile this code no problem in ubuntu (using "gcc -o test test.c"), however when I run the compiled code there is not output appearing.  Does anyone know why this is so?  Could it perhaps be because I am using the terminal window (I don't think this is the case).
