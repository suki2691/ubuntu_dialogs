2012-04-30T10:39:00.000Z	Danne_		Hi! I just upgraded to ubuntu 12.04, and when I boot into the desktop, it's completely broken. Mouse is not working, only some keys are working and graphics is messed up, lot's of icons are missing. I can't even access a terminal, so is there a way to boot into terminal rather than desktop?
