2007-08-21T11:04:00.000Z	Jim-Reaper		i'm trying to add repositories to ubuntu and I've followed the ubuntu support pages but they are out of date and not correct for latest version I think
2007-08-21T11:04:00.000Z	Jim-Reaper		anyone?
2007-08-21T11:05:00.000Z	finalbeta	Jim-Reaper	we need more proper information. what repo's, why, for what version?
2007-08-21T11:07:00.000Z	finalbeta	Jim-Reaper	repositories are for a specific ubuntu version. so you need to use the proper ones, I think skype has ubuntu packages in the site though, so check there site first.
