2007-11-05T13:16:00.000Z	zeroflag	juice_	do you have graphics drivers installed? some UI features only work (properly) on hardware.
2007-11-05T13:17:00.000Z	zeroflag	juice_	System -> Administration -> Restricted Drivers Manager
2007-11-05T13:18:00.000Z	zeroflag	juice_	also make sure you run a search for "nvidia" in synaptic and install anything that sounds remotely useful. including the drivers-new-something package...
