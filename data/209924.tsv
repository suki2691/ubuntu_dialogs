2007-02-04T17:28:00.000Z	xaos		i'm using dapper, and i broke my software index. when i run apt-get install -f , it tells me i have to remove 821 mb worth of packages. is there a way to remove the packages i installed (edgy libc6 libs, and others) without removing my entire system? or should i let it remove all teh files and run update manager to upgrade to edgy?

2007-02-04T17:31:00.000Z	LjL	xaos	yes
