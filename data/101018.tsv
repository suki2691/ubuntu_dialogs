2008-07-31T10:36:00.000Z	LogicalDash	itai-michaelson	Yeah, and that seems to be what they want people to use
2008-07-31T10:36:00.000Z	itai-michaelson	LogicalDash	don't you think its better he adds multiverse and installs wine from the repos>?
2008-07-31T10:37:00.000Z	LogicalDash	itai-michaelson	the WINE development versions present the same user interface and everything, they just have some experimental features that make (say) some installers work better
