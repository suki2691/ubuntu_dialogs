2007-06-09T16:39:00.000Z	andyw		I'm trying to run Google Earth in Ubuntu 7.04 in Parallels 3.0, but I can't get hardware support to work.  Google Earth will only run in software OpenGl mode.  Can anyone help?
2007-06-09T16:41:00.000Z	andyw		parallels 3.0 supports openGL though
2007-06-09T16:41:00.000Z	andyw		parallels is virtualization software for the mac
