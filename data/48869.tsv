2009-12-01T22:51:00.000Z	andyzammy1		i'm trying to find out how to open up my hp pavillion dv7 to clean it, it looks very dusty in the grill, does anybody know how to do this?

2009-12-01T22:53:00.000Z	andyzammy1	klown	thanks for the tip, but unfortunately i don't have any on me - i'm not even sure if its a good idea because the lappy isn't ventelated, i'd be spraying into the outlet, so wouldn't really get any of the dust out, just shifting it about
