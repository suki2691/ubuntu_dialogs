2009-04-24T05:55:00.000Z	meatwad		I'm new to Ubuntu (and Linux).  My laptop speakers and headphone jack aren't working.  Can anyone help?

2009-04-24T06:08:00.000Z	recon69	meatwad	did you look in preferances in volume control , there are about 40 different channels, one of them might work. worth a try. might be a driver problem.
