2008-12-07T04:11:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	eddieAW	there is nothing speacial in runlevel 3, why would you?
2008-12-07T04:14:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	eddieAW	where did you get that driver?
2008-12-07T04:15:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	eddieAW	huh. well maybe it means that you should stop the gui (gdm) and work in a console.
