2008-10-07T15:01:00.000Z	d_dyer-1		is the 8.10 Beta stable?
2008-10-07T15:01:00.000Z	d_dyer-1		i know that but is it stable enough for me to upgrade or should i wait until the 30th
2008-10-07T15:02:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	d_dyer-1	wait
2008-10-07T15:03:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	d_dyer-1	expected as it's a beta but 8.10 is very unstable on my testing machine. So unless you fancy testing it and don't mind re installs and bug reports gallore ... wait
