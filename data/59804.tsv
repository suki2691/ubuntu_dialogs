2009-04-22T09:39:00.000Z	michasb		Hi all! I'm trying to wrap my head around Jaunty's OpenLDAP configuration. I know they switched to cn=config but I don't think it's setup initially and there is no slapd.conf. Any help would be appreciated.
2009-04-22T09:41:00.000Z	michasb		Basically, I'm wondering how to change OpenLDAP's configuration if there isn't a slapd.conf and cn=config isn't setup (at least it's not showing in slapcat and I didn't get asked for a password).
