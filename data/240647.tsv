2005-10-22T10:49:00.000Z	Angel777		Hi, I have a problem with my hostname. I changed it and it seems that Ubuntu dopesnot like it. I cannot change it because as cannnot use the command sudo. Anyone have an idea how to fix that?
2005-10-22T10:50:00.000Z	Angel777		sudo is not working because it is telling me : sudo: unable to lookup ---== DURAN via gethostbyname()
2005-10-22T10:51:00.000Z	Angel777		I used Xterm mode I think but it doesnot want to let me do sudo. In recovery mode, will I be able to do a sudo command?
