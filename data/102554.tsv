2009-01-26T06:11:00.000Z	Gtwy		this guide shows someone how to setup vnc to run when the computer starts http://www.movingtofreedom.org/2007/02/16/howto-remote-desktop-with-vnc-in-ubuntu-edgy-gnu-linux/
2009-01-26T06:12:00.000Z	Gtwy		its awesome and it took me 5 minutes to do what took me 6 hours of research today
2009-01-26T06:13:00.000Z	rww	Gtwy	It'd probably be better to add the information or a link, to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH somewhere
