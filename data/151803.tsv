2007-05-08T12:06:00.000Z	therealnanotube	QuixoticJ	there are dvd copy programs in linux, too.
2007-05-08T12:06:00.000Z	therealnanotube	QuixoticJ	check out k9copy, and qdvdauthor
2007-05-08T12:08:00.000Z	therealnanotube	QuixoticJ	so, check out on winehq.org, if dvdcopy runs under wine. if it's listed, then you should be ok.
