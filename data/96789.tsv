2008-08-22T11:03:00.000Z	mojo	DistroJockey	 I know about apt-proxy, but i run AMD64 on the desktop and AthlonXP on the server.  Besides, that does not address my use
2008-08-22T11:03:00.000Z	DistroJockey	mojo	ok
2008-08-22T11:04:00.000Z	mojo	DistroJockey	 i don't want to just have a localized pkg database.  i want to manage the software on the server from the desktop with a gui or web front end as opposed to using aptitude on an ssh session.  i am just not grokking aptitude for some reason very well though i am well familiar with console apps
