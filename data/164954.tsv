2010-09-22T21:42:00.000Z	m_fulder		I need some help with mounting/umounting... I added a new HDD to my comp resently but how do I make ubuntu find/mount it?
2010-09-22T21:43:00.000Z	neil_d	m_fulder	have you partitioned and formated it?
2010-09-22T22:27:00.000Z	neil_d	m_fulder	they should be able... ftp is a protocol ... it doesn't care how the files are stored by the ftp server.
