2010-12-17T23:42:00.000Z	Asad2005		I am planning to switch from 32bit to 64bit because i bought an SSD. If i copy my home folder to the 64bit installation would it work?
2010-12-17T23:43:00.000Z	AbhiJit	Asad2005	anything other than program data will work
2010-12-17T23:44:00.000Z	Asad2005	AbhiJit	My main concern is email evolution messages and settings
2010-12-17T23:44:00.000Z	AbhiJit	Asad2005	you can do that.
