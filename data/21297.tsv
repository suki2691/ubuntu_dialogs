2011-01-03T14:12:00.000Z	lifestream		Umm... I've got a really really silly question... If I use SSH to copy files from my other computer (same house, same router)... umm.... Will it connect over the internet, or locally?  ... does this make sense?

2011-01-03T14:15:00.000Z	axp2	lifestream	i'd suggest you'd have trouble doing the ssh over two PCs via the internet unless you meant to, because you'd have to set up port forwarding and open the right ports etc. to do it
