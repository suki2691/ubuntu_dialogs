2008-01-01T21:55:00.000Z	hello_		Hello :) Is it possible to reinstall Nautilus without having to format everything?
2008-01-01T21:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	hello_	 why do you want to reinstall nautilus?
2008-01-01T21:56:00.000Z	hello_	Dr_willis	Nautilus seems to always be freezing up when I play music; I'm having to type "killall nautilus" in the terminal once every several minutes after I've listened to music for a while. My previous installation of Gutsy didn't do this, so I just want to see if reinstalling helps things
2008-01-01T21:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	hello_	 'reinstalling' is windows thinking.. try making a new user. see if it affects them also.. if it does not affect them. then its somthing to do with your gnome users settings.
