2008-02-17T18:00:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	nucco_	for me i have my nvidia settings manager and i change the video gamma settings from there...
2008-02-17T18:02:00.000Z	nucco_	speedhunt3r	i'm using an ATI card, and non-gstreamer apps are working fine. also totem-xine works fine, but it crashes if i'm not using xgl
2008-02-17T18:03:00.000Z	speedhunt3r	nucco_	sorry I had massive troubles with ATI I avoid handling issues concerning it.
