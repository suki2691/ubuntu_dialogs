2012-04-16T23:13:00.000Z	jola	Fyodorovna	no, I only had the info that the NTFS signature was missing
2012-04-16T23:13:00.000Z	jola		I don't know what else was overwritten by that driver
2012-04-16T23:14:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	jola	not really sure here but when I look that up it appears top be a broken partition table, may not really be fixable efficiently really.
