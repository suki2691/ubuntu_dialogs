2009-12-06T04:12:00.000Z	Richard_Simmons		Now that I know about zenity... how do I specify what display it appears on? right now, I'm getting the error "(zenity:4995): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display: "

2009-12-06T04:15:00.000Z	Richard_Simmons	losha	both using Ubuntu 9.04's built in SSH, so I have no idea. I'm trying "DISPLAY=:0 zenity --text updating your pc remotely " and getting the same error :/
2009-12-06T04:16:00.000Z	losha	Richard_Simmons	you need to configure both the server and the client to allow X11 forwarding to do what you're trying to do. Either that, or settle for using the 'write' command to send text messages to the user....
