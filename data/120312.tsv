2008-07-07T20:40:00.000Z	insomnia_		is it possible to reinstall ubuntu (clean format), leaving some space to install windows after?
2008-07-07T20:40:00.000Z	bazhang	insomnia_	best to install windows first
2008-07-07T20:41:00.000Z	insomnia_	bazhang	after installation i should defragment windows, then install ubuntu? or no need for defragment?
2008-07-07T20:42:00.000Z	bazhang	insomnia_	not sure about windows; linux needs none though :)
