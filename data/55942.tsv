2009-05-31T00:53:00.000Z	beatles		Can someone please help me? I can no longer access the internet in Ubuntu 9.04. It worked fine previously in Ubuntu 9.04. I am connecting wirelessly with a PCMCIA card. I can connect to my network but when I open firefox I get "server not found." I have tried more than one card but still have had no luck.
2009-05-31T00:53:00.000Z	geoaxis	beatles	could it be some proxy setting
2009-05-31T00:54:00.000Z	beatles	geoaxis	I don't use a proxy. In firefox I have always had it set to "No proxy"
2009-05-31T00:57:00.000Z	beatles	geoaxis	should I be using ndiswrapper or madwifi
