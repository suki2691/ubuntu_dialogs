2011-08-24T08:12:00.000Z	bc81		hello.  i preformed some hard drive tests using GSmartControl, and i'm not sure what to make of the results.  according to this log file, is my hard drive failing? > http://pastebin.com/6jkwXQJe
2011-08-24T08:13:00.000Z	KM0201	bc81	well "overall health assessment: passed" i'm guessing thats good
2011-08-24T08:14:00.000Z	KM0201	bc81	i didn't see any errors, but my guess is, if they were ritical, the drive would not have passed
2011-08-24T08:15:00.000Z	KM0201	bc81	neither of those errors look serious to me.. like i said, if it was serious, the drive wouldn't have passed
