2005-06-17T06:21:00.000Z	ablyss		hey guys I have a problem.. i set up iptables to do internet sharing and now on workstation ( IP 192.168.1.4 ) which points to my linux router IP 192.168.1.1 ... isn't handling FTP.. I can log in to a FTP site but can't run in commands
2005-06-17T06:23:00.000Z	ablyss		i presume the FTP server is reading router IP 192.168.1.1 and not my real IP 192.168.1.4
