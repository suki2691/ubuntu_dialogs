2008-08-25T03:36:00.000Z	Traveler232		Hello... what's the best java compiler I can use (is it javac?) ?
2008-08-25T03:36:00.000Z	rconan	Traveler232	javac is the command regardless of which one you use
2008-08-25T03:36:00.000Z	rconan	Traveler232	most people would argue that sun is the best
2008-08-25T03:39:00.000Z	rconan	Traveler232	or sun-java6-jdk for the most recent version
