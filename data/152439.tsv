2007-06-04T07:07:00.000Z	PanzerMKZ		could you do a dist upgrade from 6.06 to 7.04 straight
2007-06-04T07:07:00.000Z	PanzerMKZ		or do you have to upgrade to 6.10
2007-06-04T07:08:00.000Z	liquiddoom	PanzerMKZ	You have to go in order
2007-06-04T07:08:00.000Z	liquiddoom	PanzerMKZ	Best to reinstall. Dist-upgrades are pretty buggy
