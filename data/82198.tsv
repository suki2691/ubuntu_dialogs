2008-12-02T12:18:00.000Z	thomasite		Hello. I have a problem deleting permanently a folder that is inside the Trash Bin. Each time I hit the delete key, an error message appears saying that permission is denied. Does this mean that I have to delete the folder as a root? If so, how do I do that? Thanks a lot!
