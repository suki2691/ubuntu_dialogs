2007-02-20T09:48:00.000Z	jron_		hello, i'm not in a gui desktop but i'd like to launch the gui default ubuntu application update program, what is the name of it?
2007-02-20T09:50:00.000Z	jron_		thank you jrib, that was the app i was looking for. wanted to make sure my xfce backport changes would take effect
2007-02-20T09:52:00.000Z	jron_		one more question, i'm use to gentoo, so when i read ubuntu is on a 6 month release cycle does that mean after 6 months i'll have to reinstall ubuntu to use the new packages? assuming they don't backport every app
2007-02-20T09:54:00.000Z	Slart	jron_	I think there's some info on upgrading from dapper drake to edgy eft on the site first page or something.. seem to remember reading it
