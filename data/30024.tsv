2010-06-20T15:17:00.000Z	SlidingHorn	minver	you haven't stated any problems with the standard CD....so you'd have to do that before I can try to explain what causes it ;)
2010-06-20T15:20:00.000Z	minver	SlidingHorn	When I run the cd I see the text "Ubutnu, coprigth, Loading, initialize' stuff in a couple of seconds and then the screen goes black and nothing happens.. :s No error code
