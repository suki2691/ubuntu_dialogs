2009-04-12T03:04:00.000Z	megworld	jdwarta1	by admin i think you mean root you dont run as root as its unsafe but root in the terminal can be achived by sudo
2009-04-12T03:05:00.000Z	megworld	jdwarta1	thats not advisable you only need to be root for particular commands
2009-04-12T03:08:00.000Z	megworld	jdwarta1	there are some poeple around irc/forums and other places which seek to get you to run dangrous commands for this reason you only use root when you know what the command does
