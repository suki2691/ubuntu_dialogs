2005-10-08T10:19:00.000Z	MCJedi		hello, i'm having  a problem getting ncurses-devel to install, can someone give me a step by step on this?
2005-10-08T10:20:00.000Z	crimsun	MCJedi	sudo aptitude install libncurses5-dev
2005-10-08T10:20:00.000Z	crimsun	MCJedi	nurses-devel is the RPM fashion of naming
2005-10-08T10:21:00.000Z	crimsun	MCJedi	Debian uses libfoo-dev
