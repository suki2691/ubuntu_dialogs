2009-07-11T07:49:00.000Z	gambler		after installing nvidia binary driver my system no longer boots into X. no screens found - do I just cycle thru apt-get installing the other nvidia-glx packages?
2009-07-11T07:51:00.000Z	gambler		Is there any graphics card that supports multi mon (3 monitor) setup on linux well?
2009-07-11T07:51:00.000Z	gambler		eg. without any hassles
2009-07-11T07:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gambler	 nvidia may have some cards that do that now. the 8800 i got only handles 2 monitors  or a monitor +tv :(
