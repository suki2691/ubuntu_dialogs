2010-01-13T22:51:00.000Z	bob_the_hamster		Reading back in the buffer I realize my previous question about ping times when disconnected from the network could have been misinterpreted as a mean-spirited attempt to trick people into disconnecting themselves from IRC. It was not, and I appologise if anybody thought it was
2010-01-13T22:52:00.000Z	bob_the_hamster		I seriously am pulling my hair out trying to figure out why ping on some boxes fails instantly and other boxes it takes about 40 seconds to fail
2010-01-13T22:53:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	bob_the_hamster	have you tried monitoring these boxes with a tool called 'iptraf'? it might help
