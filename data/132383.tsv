2007-06-02T14:34:00.000Z	crimsun	yuiop	supports both cores of my Core Duo at least.
2007-06-02T14:35:00.000Z	yuiop	crimsun	thanks. ya know of any software we can test/monitor if the dual core is kicked into action?
2007-06-02T14:35:00.000Z	crimsun	yuiop	you can see it in the logs and in /proc/cpuinfo.
