2008-11-07T09:58:00.000Z	sysdoc	gaintsura	/home is about all you should need, unless you saved files elsewhere
2008-11-07T09:59:00.000Z	gaintsura	sysdoc	only a few, mainly installed stuff.. shouldn't /etc/ be included as well so that I don't have to spend weeks configuring things again?
2008-11-07T10:00:00.000Z	sysdoc	gaintsura	not really.. U upgrading??
