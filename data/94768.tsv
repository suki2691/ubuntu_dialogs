2009-02-19T10:43:00.000Z	Aleran		I just installed an internal hard drive to hold my media on. I was thinking about formating it with ext4. Does anyone know if this will work ok with ubuntu 8.10?
2009-02-19T10:44:00.000Z	Lounge	Aleran	ext4 if i read right should be shipped with the next build but atm ext4 is still in development
2009-02-19T10:45:00.000Z	Aleran	Lounge	but if they've already marked it for the next build then its gotta be stable right?
2009-02-19T10:46:00.000Z	Lounge	Aleran	not untill ext4 is officially decleared stable then it'll would be distribution worthy, i think
