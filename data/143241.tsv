2009-01-26T10:01:00.000Z	goblin		I am trying to unmount a partition in order to resize it. The command that i used is: umout /dev/sda1. The error message was: /: device is busy  (In some cases useful info about processes that use  the device is found by lsof(8) or fuser(1)). What do I do now? any help would be appreciated.
