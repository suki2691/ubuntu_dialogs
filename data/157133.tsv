2007-09-18T08:32:00.000Z	supaneko		I have Ubuntu and XP on two seperate hard drives but for some reason the system always boots to the second (XP) drive.
2007-09-18T08:33:00.000Z	supaneko		I have re-installed grub numerous times but to no avail. Anyone have any suggestions?
2007-09-18T08:33:00.000Z	supaneko		Well, I did. But it only gives me an option to boot "hard drives" second but not which one.
