2009-11-05T10:00:00.000Z	rymo		device list in Hardware tab of Sound Preferences is empty -- what do I do? works fine booting from LiveCD
2009-11-05T10:02:00.000Z	rymo		does Ubuntu have an equivalent to Windows' Device Manager?

2009-11-05T10:05:00.000Z	rymo	Brack101	IdleOne: those look like Task Manager, I'm looking for Device Manager (for hardware - to figure out why my sound works fine in LiveCD but not on 9.04 -> 9.10 upgrade)
