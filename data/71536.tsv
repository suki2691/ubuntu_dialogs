2009-07-11T01:42:00.000Z	anr78		I have insetalled Ubuntu on a Unibody MacBook Pro, and all is well, except that the keyboard layout isn't correct. For one thing I can't find curly/square brackets, and | and ' are swapped.
2009-07-11T01:43:00.000Z	sonink	anr78	you just need to use xmodmap.  fixing those things is really simple when it's just single keys or shifted keys
2009-07-11T01:46:00.000Z	anr78	sonink	so if mostly everything is correct, I should just fix one by one until I'm good?
2009-07-11T01:47:00.000Z	sonink	anr78	yeah I think that's your best bet.  Hopefully you don't have a lot of keys to remap but it's not hard to do.  You can just google xmodmap and find a few tutorials and examples of similar issues
