2010-10-13T16:46:00.000Z	graphiclunarkid		I have an odd problem with the new Ubuntu One sign-up wizard on Maverick Netbook edition: on an English (United Kingdom) keyboard layout with English (United Kingdom) as the system language, if I type '@' in the email address text-box it prints as Î©. Anyone else experienced this?
