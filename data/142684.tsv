2007-03-26T05:23:00.000Z	mozul	Jordan_U	it says No space left on device. would that be my boot partition?
2007-03-26T05:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mozul	That would be your root partition, which by default is also your boot partition
2007-03-26T05:24:00.000Z	mozul	Jordan_U	my boot partition is seperate from my root partition.  boot is set to 50mb on a raid 1 mirror where root is on a 400gig raid 5.
