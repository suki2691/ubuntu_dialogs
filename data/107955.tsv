2008-01-01T05:03:00.000Z	ryushe_		Hi there, I'm getting an API mismatch on the NVIDIA kernel module. nv driver also doesn't work, only the VESA driver works atm. Any suggestions?
2008-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	ryushe_		speak for yourself, it's still crappy old year here ;)
2008-01-01T05:04:00.000Z	Sam-laptop	ryushe_	Did you install from apt or did you use the nvidia installer?
2008-01-01T05:05:00.000Z	ryushe_	Sam-laptop	> apt one gives error as well, so I deinstalled, and installed latest NVIDIA driver from the nvidia site as it claims it now supports my card :/
