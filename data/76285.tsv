2008-11-08T06:32:00.000Z	Socapex_2K		hello. I am having trouble with my soundcard. I cannot hear sound in any audio apps! Could somebody help me please. I use an external usb sound card, an edirol ua-5. If I go to preferences>sound and I select my usb card and hit play, it works!

2008-11-08T06:33:00.000Z	Socapex_2K	Gnea	I'll try right now
2008-11-08T06:34:00.000Z	Socapex_2K	Gnea	I've change prefs for soundplayback and all to usb audio already
