2010-08-05T03:03:00.000Z	rww	zenix	correct. Ubuntu One stuff isn't shared with others unless you explicitly say it is (through the web interface and maybe somehow in the UI now, iono)
2010-08-05T03:03:00.000Z	rww	zenix	i.e., the default is for things not to be shared
2010-08-05T03:04:00.000Z	zenix	rww	thanks!
