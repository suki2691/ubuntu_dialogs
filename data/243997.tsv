2005-04-04T10:12:00.000Z	Brend		Hello. It appears that an IBM utility called "Verify Disk" has just wiped our entire system, without warning. "fdisk /dev/sda" and "fdisk /dev/sdb" report zero partitions. Is there any chance they could be wrong, and is there anything we can do find out?

2005-04-04T11:06:00.000Z	nis	Brend	when we get to to 'Microsoft Distribution' of Linux then I'm worried.  ;)
