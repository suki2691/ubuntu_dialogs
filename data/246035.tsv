2007-02-04T17:29:00.000Z	EdgEy		my sound is really quiet in ubuntu, i've tried alsamixer it's maxed out there
2007-02-04T17:29:00.000Z	EdgEy		i could just turn up the volume on my speakers but then windows would be loud
2007-02-04T17:29:00.000Z	Mez	EdgEy	er, in alsamixer, is the "PCM" mixer up ?
2007-02-04T17:30:00.000Z	Mez	EdgEy	turn that all the way up
