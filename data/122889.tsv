2007-09-08T12:19:00.000Z	DuClare	Sonic1	well, it's probably blocking the 360's connection, you need to find out what ports or stuff the 360 needs and open / allow those ports and stuff
2007-09-08T12:20:00.000Z	Sonic1	DuClare	It can't even gain a IP though
2007-09-08T12:20:00.000Z	DuClare	Sonic1	yes, I assume your firewall (which you start with firestarter) is simply blocking whatever the xbox needs to get an IP & connectivity. it's a matter of configuring your firewall properly..
