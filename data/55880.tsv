2009-06-02T04:36:00.000Z	InfectedWithDrew		Repeating myself again: I've tried formatting in Windows and I have managed to get my mp3 player to format there perfectly fine.  As far as Windows is concerned, the device is working fine.  But I can't format it in Ubuntu.  Gparted gives me this error: http://pastebin.com/d447f02f3  And I've already tried fdisk to erase the partition and make an new one and it didn't work.

2009-06-02T04:38:00.000Z	zortec		I installed the compiz settings manager, where would I find that?
