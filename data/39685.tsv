2010-03-13T06:44:00.000Z	sn[a]ke		so im on youtube trying to watch in 780p, and it is really glitchy (even with it completly buffered) is this due to a bad codec or something, normal quality works fine although thats not what i want.

2010-03-13T06:46:00.000Z	sn[a]ke	Some_Person	no, it is intel atom (N270)
2010-03-13T06:46:00.000Z	Some_Person	sn[a]ke	well, there are no external codecs used for any youtube videos
