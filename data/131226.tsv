2009-09-08T08:49:00.000Z	cambo		i have 16 servers.
2009-09-08T08:49:00.000Z	cambo		just want to use the fstab to automount at login for each user
2009-09-08T08:50:00.000Z	cambo		I guess that automount is my only option right?
2009-09-08T08:50:00.000Z	phix	cambo	use automount? or setup some pam module to mount it when they log in?
