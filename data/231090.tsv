2007-04-10T07:06:00.000Z	ian2		how would i set up a folder that was directly between users. Ie, the shared folder does not reside on either users space ????
2007-04-10T07:07:00.000Z	ian2		is it safe to delete the user that you origionally setup ubuntu with ? (i have made other users)
2007-04-10T07:08:00.000Z	ian2		so if i make sure the others are part of the admin group we are good to go ?
