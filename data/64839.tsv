2010-08-05T00:41:00.000Z	smerz		can someone help me to start booting from from a raid1 root("/") filesystem?
2010-08-05T00:42:00.000Z	smerz		are there any known bugs regarding this? (booting straigt from a raid1 in 10.4) ?
2010-08-05T00:43:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	smerz	not sure about "bugs", but I know many have had issues boot RAID with Ubuntu Desktop - sorry i don't use RAID myself, so have never paid much attention.  good luck.
