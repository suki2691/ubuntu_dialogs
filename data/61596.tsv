2010-05-15T18:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dad`	 weird. can you login on the console ?
2010-05-15T18:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dad`	 i noticed that also today. I thinki clicked on my login icon and it dident ask for password either
2010-05-15T18:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Dad`	 it would be a gdm setting not a xorg setting i imagine
2010-05-15T18:35:00.000Z	Dad`	Dr_Willis	but I'm stuck on gdm I can't login :-)
