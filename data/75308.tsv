2012-10-03T00:28:00.000Z	Coded1		hello all, I'm running 12.04 and I'm not sure when exactly this started but now when ever I try to install a package via APT or Software Centre I get messages similar to this "WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!"
2012-10-03T00:28:00.000Z	Coded1		I get that just trying to install pastebinit

2012-10-03T00:31:00.000Z	Coded1	genii-around	I just did a bit of googleing and found I apparently don't have debian-keyring even installed, don't know how I fat fingered that but I'm fixing as we speak
