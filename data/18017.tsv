2011-04-07T14:01:00.000Z	koltroll		Hey guys. Just booted up my ubuntu computer that's running 10.04. I'd like to update to 11.04. Is this possible through the update manager? I only get 10.10 as a option.

2011-04-07T14:03:00.000Z	koltroll	nunuyabiz	hm ok. Then I haft to make a decision what's faster. Downloading 11.4 make a clean install or make upgrades in steps... =) Thanks
