2008-04-30T10:53:00.000Z	zcat[1]	RedScare	well, it's not bad in one way.. a lot of ppl hate vista so much thel'y even consider Linux in preference to it :)
2008-04-30T10:56:00.000Z	zcat[1]	RedScare	yes and no.. Friday's client is already running OOo and Firefox and a few other OSS programs, there's very little she's using in Windows that isn't exactly the same in Linux. The biggest issue will be replacing Autocad with qcad.. which is why she wants dual-boot so she can still get to autocad if she needs it
