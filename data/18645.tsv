2012-10-25T15:17:00.000Z	GeorgeTorwell		When I install Ubuntu if I already have an existing account and home folder on a previous ubuntu installation, can I make the new Ubuntu use that home/account without creating a new one?
2012-10-25T15:18:00.000Z	GeorgeTorwell		I would like to reinstall so I can use the full disk encryption feature of 12.10
2012-10-25T15:18:00.000Z	GeorgeTorwell		I do have a separate /home
2012-10-25T15:20:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	GeorgeTorwell	 /home also contains config files -- two different ubuntu versions may not be compatible
