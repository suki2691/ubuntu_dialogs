2010-04-09T18:50:00.000Z	BinaryBob		you know how there are startup scripts in /etc/init.d for services?  What is that called?  I want to google for the right term so I can read about how to write my own scripts and add my own services correctly
2010-04-09T18:50:00.000Z	BinaryBob		is that called init?
