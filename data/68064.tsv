2009-12-22T15:01:00.000Z	imagodei		I have 9.04 Server, I manually configured DHCP on two interfaces. One is plugged to network, the other not. I get this message (reloading /etc/samba/smb.conf smbd only) every 5 minutes or so. Is there any way to stop smbd from reloading every time dhcp tries to get IP? Or at least decrease the interval? There was a discussion about this issue at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1140094 but
