2009-01-20T01:46:00.000Z	FeiRuoWa		my little sister decided ot sudo dd my computer, and i decided that while i have no operating system would be a good time to make the switch, BUT my computer won't start from the  (perfectly acceptable, i checked on another computer) ubuntu disk, even after i changed the bios settings. any suggestions?
2009-01-20T01:47:00.000Z	FeiRuoWa		i get  amessage on startup that says no operating system is detected.
