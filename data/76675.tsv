2008-10-23T08:23:00.000Z	aetherealize		Sound problem: I'm fairly new to ubuntu and can't get sound to play. The soundcard shows up with aplay -l and is not muted in alsamixer. Can someone help?
2008-10-23T08:25:00.000Z	aetherealize		It's really confusing because I get no errors when I try to play files, and nothing is muted. Yet, no sound. Any ideas?
