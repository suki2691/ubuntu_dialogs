2007-01-20T06:42:00.000Z	criticaL		Is there any GUI for Apache2? Web-based or not, doesn't matter. Anything but Webmin!
2007-01-20T06:42:00.000Z	hjmills	criticaL	gedit and the /etc/apache2/apache2.conf file?
2007-01-20T06:44:00.000Z	criticaL	hjmills	I've just started using Apache2 and I don't know exactly how to configure it yet, so I want a GUI for it. ;)
2007-01-20T06:45:00.000Z	hjmills	criticaL	I dont know of any specific gui but there is a guide for configuring it at http://help.ubuntu.com - i recommend learning to edit the config file as that will always work rather than relying on a program that may not always be available
