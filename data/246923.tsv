2009-11-04T21:01:00.000Z	MrSeraph		Hey guys - I'm returning to Ubuntu from about two years ago. I just got Karmic (9.10) and I noticed nothing is available for it yet (VirtualBox, Xchat, etc.) Should I go with the last distro?
2009-11-04T21:02:00.000Z	MrSeraph		I've attempted to install it and it's not working.
2009-11-04T21:02:00.000Z	MrSeraph		It keeps telling me... hang on... let me get the error
2009-11-04T21:04:00.000Z	tormod	MrSeraph	you might want xchat-gnome
