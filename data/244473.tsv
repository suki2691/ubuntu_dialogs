2006-10-26T07:40:00.000Z	mario__		I'm from Chile (southamerica) and I work in a local University, we want to create an official ubuntu mirror. We'd like to do some privates tests on it and after that open it to Internet
2006-10-26T07:40:00.000Z	mario__		the questions is: can I do that with rsync or another tool?
