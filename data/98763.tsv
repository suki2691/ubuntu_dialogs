2008-05-21T18:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Sinnerman	 the fuseiso tool I belve can mount/access those. Check its website. and the fuse website for info on using fuse. There may be a fuseiso wiki page in the ubuntu wiki pages also
2008-05-21T18:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Sinnerman	 i recall the fuseiso site saying it could handle .nrg  and other formats.. perhaps it cant do them all.  I dont mess with   mdf files much
2008-05-21T18:15:00.000Z	Sinnerman	Dr_willis	i wouldn't mess with them either, if i had a choice :D.
