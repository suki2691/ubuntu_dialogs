2010-03-19T13:37:00.000Z	Effit		sorry, a total terminal noob, would it be sudo apt-get [whatever]?
2010-03-19T13:37:00.000Z	theadmin	Effit	Technically yes. Most commonly used are "sudo apt-get install PACKAGE", "sudo apt-get remove PACKAGE" and "sudo apt-get update"
2010-03-19T13:39:00.000Z	theadmin	Effit	Use "apt-cache search SOMETHING" to search for packages, by the way.
