2009-08-08T05:06:00.000Z	grom358		neither Transmission or Deluge will work with UPnP and I have had it working under windows prior to switching to ubuntu

2009-08-08T05:07:00.000Z	grom358	Pricey	I haven't change my router settings.. its working under XP.. well it was until I installed ubuntu over my XP partition
