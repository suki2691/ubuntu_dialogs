2010-10-21T15:58:00.000Z	shatly_		Just wondering what music players people would recomend for 10.10 (my frend needs it to work with a *shivvers* ipod)
2010-10-21T15:59:00.000Z	lahwran	shatly_	I just started up amaroK
2010-10-21T16:00:00.000Z	lahwran	shatly_	I'd strongly recommend against both banshee and rhythmbox, both have crappy interfaces IMO. if you don't want amaroK, I'd recommend exaile
2010-10-21T16:00:00.000Z	lahwran	shatly_	ubuntu server?
