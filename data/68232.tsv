2011-01-01T17:41:00.000Z	Jaacs		which version should I install on my laptop the netbook version or the desktop version
2011-01-01T17:42:00.000Z	Jaacs		Willis can u please help me understand both versions
2011-01-01T17:42:00.000Z	CyL	Jaacs	They differ primarily on the appearance, but I'd also go with the desktop
2011-01-01T17:44:00.000Z	CyL	Jaacs	harware compatibility would not change.. the netbook version albeit being more tailored to small screen lappys is not so efficient as the desktop version, even with a small screen IMHO (maybe with a touch screen this is different...)
