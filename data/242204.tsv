2005-04-15T08:48:00.000Z	LordGrunt		my problem: both konqueror and kcontrol hangs up my system in very ugly way, they freeze display and keyboard. it seems that they run at very high priority cause at very beggining of app start i can hit CAPS_LOCK for example and it lights after ten or more seconds. but rest of system is unusable after that. help?
