2006-01-26T08:34:00.000Z	Scott_Help		I'm wondering, how do I connect to the internet via Ubuntu, via ethernet card?
2006-01-26T08:35:00.000Z	sethk	Scott_Help	exactly the same way you connect to the internet with an ethernet card and windows
2006-01-26T08:41:00.000Z	sethk	Scott_Help	you might try asking a question rather than insulting people.
