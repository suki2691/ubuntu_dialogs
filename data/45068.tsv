2009-10-25T13:31:00.000Z	mojo_o	cherva	because some features of the run command havn't been implimented yet so you entries are processed remotely by a team of highly trained circus monkeys whose respone is processed by an extremly complex algorithm hence the high cpu usage and delay.
2009-10-25T13:33:00.000Z	cherva	mojo_o	do you think that this is funny ?
