2006-11-07T11:11:00.000Z	RevFrSanctus		ok, i have the fglrx drivers installed.  They work.  Xgl and Beryl work.  Direct rending works.  But, ctrl-alt-function key doesn't (it gives a garbled screen).  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this?

2006-11-07T11:12:00.000Z	watchme	RevFrSanctus	I meant Ctrl-Alt-Del
2006-11-07T11:22:00.000Z	RevFrSanctus	watchme	I don't need ctlr-alt-del to work.  What doesn't work is getting to a console by means of ctrl-alt-function.  Everything else with the video works, but when I try to go to console, it doesn't.  Brightness keys don't work either (fn-up and down)
