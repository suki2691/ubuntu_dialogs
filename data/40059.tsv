2010-05-11T05:51:00.000Z	spat_hero		Need some help diagnosing a kernel panic. It just stops and I can't go anywhere from there. At least give me boot options to view more information.
2010-05-11T05:53:00.000Z	spat_hero		Init options for kernel panic? Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?
2010-05-11T05:53:00.000Z	HTT-Bird	spat_hero	hmmm...how early in the boot is it panic'ing?
2010-05-11T05:54:00.000Z	HTT-Bird	spat_hero	seems like kernel debugging's going to be the only thing that can save you
