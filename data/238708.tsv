2007-07-09T12:27:00.000Z	Anlar	nesssy	try ummm build-essential and anjuta :) that should get you started
2007-07-09T12:28:00.000Z	Anlar	nesssy	build-essential will pull in a HUGE pile of software, all that you will need.. and anjuta is IDE for developing in c++
2007-07-10T09:26:00.000Z	Anlar	nesssy	you got build-essential installed?
