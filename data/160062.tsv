2008-01-31T08:18:00.000Z	Jewfro-Macabbi	box_	get the gnome-art package
2008-01-31T08:23:00.000Z	Jewfro-Macabbi	box_	it's under system - preferences - art manager
2008-01-31T08:24:00.000Z	Jewfro-Macabbi	box_	gnome art just downloads/installs different themes/icons/windows borders for you - you can then use them via system - preferences - appearance
