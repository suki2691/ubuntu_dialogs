2012-02-16T22:30:00.000Z	meskarune	nils_	NO acronis is not able to boot linux
2012-02-16T22:31:00.000Z	nils_	meskarune	well then he'll need grub or lilo or syslinux anyways...
2012-02-16T22:31:00.000Z	meskarune	nils_	he wants to delete grub because its ugly. but since acronis doesn't boot linux, grub can't be deleted. :P
