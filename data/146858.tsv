2007-02-09T17:03:00.000Z	bayziders		Where can I get the package and where can I get dpkg
2007-02-09T17:04:00.000Z	cables	bayziders	go to packages.ubuntu.com for the package. There's a package installer that should open if you doubleclick on the .deb file
2007-05-26T16:53:00.000Z	cables	bayziders	yeah, I'm not having a problem with that.
