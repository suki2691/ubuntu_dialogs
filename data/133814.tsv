2007-05-18T11:21:00.000Z	pteron		Hi! How to enable write on a automaticly mounted NTFS-partition?
2007-05-18T11:21:00.000Z	Quintin	pteron	you'll need ntfs-3g or simialr.  If you want to share data between windows and linux, ext3 is a better solution
2007-05-18T11:23:00.000Z	pteron	Quintin	linux is installed on a ext3-partition, but all my stuff is on a large ntfs-partition. There is no simple way to enable write?
