2006-04-30T15:43:00.000Z	jamesthered	phenex	pretty sure there's a firefox plugin for that
2006-04-30T15:43:00.000Z	jamesthered		don't know if that helps, but I"m a complete newbie (sorry!) I do remember reading that there was somewhere tho
2006-04-30T15:44:00.000Z	phenex	jamesthered	a firefox plugin that will let me read pdf won't need an external pdf application?
