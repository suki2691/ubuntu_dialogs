2010-11-03T03:21:00.000Z	lucas__	blackshirt	yes. I used a customized live cd made by remastersys. IO seemed really SLOW on ext4 after time
2010-11-03T03:23:00.000Z	lucas__	blackshirt	squashfs was for the system already. Was thinking about the persistent partition. What about btrfs?
2010-11-03T03:27:00.000Z	lucas__	blackshirt	Thanks anyway! I will put it on the test to see how it does
