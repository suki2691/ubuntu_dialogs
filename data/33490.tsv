2010-05-09T18:40:00.000Z	GodricBrutus		im trying to remove kubuntu by putting the long command in, but as soon as the terminal finds out that one of the things listed is not installed, it stops the whole process. is there a way around that? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FromUbuntuToKubuntu

2010-05-09T18:42:00.000Z	GodricBrutus	scunizi	too many names to remove
2010-05-09T18:42:00.000Z	scunizi	GodricBrutus	then use that line to install all the packages.. then remove them.
