2008-02-20T06:29:00.000Z	endo		I want to hook my computer up to my LCD TV through VGA but when I do, the tv says unsupported mode, how can I fix this?!
2008-02-20T06:30:00.000Z	WarBird__	endo	the TV probably doesnt support the resolution, so try changing it
2008-02-20T06:30:00.000Z	endo	WarBird__	I tried that, did the lowest one and it doesn't work. The login screen comes up but as soon as I boot into gnome it goes unsupported mode
2008-02-20T06:32:00.000Z	WarBird__	endo	then I don't know, sorry. Maybe you could try using different video drivers
