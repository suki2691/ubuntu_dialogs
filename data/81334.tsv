2011-10-29T09:42:00.000Z	savid		Hi, I'm trying to custom-compile a kernel for ubuntu and am getting this error:  "The path '/usr/lib/python2.7' is not executable, *** Please set 'PYTHON' appropriately.  Stop".   Any ideas how to fix?
2011-10-29T09:42:00.000Z	mod	savid	it seems to tell you
2011-10-29T09:43:00.000Z	savid	mod	 "it says please set python appropriately".  I don't know what is "appropriate"
2011-10-29T09:43:00.000Z	mod	savid	set it to the python binary...
