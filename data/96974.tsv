2008-06-03T10:53:00.000Z	nickolaus		I am trying to extract a cairo clock theme but I can't copy/paste it to the folder. I cut/copy it and then right click on the folder and paste doesn't come up as an option. what do I do?
2008-06-03T10:53:00.000Z	nickolaus		Why wouldn't it let me know copy/paste?
2008-06-03T10:53:00.000Z	nickolaus		Is there some reason that when I try to paste a copied file to a folder it won't offer the option to paste? Do I need root access?
