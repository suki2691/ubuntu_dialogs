2008-10-10T12:41:00.000Z	genii	utnubudnai	Pretty much what it sounds like. It makes all the kernel modules you specified and then installs them
2008-10-10T12:42:00.000Z	utnubudnai	genii	should I run make modules_install or not after the kernel has been made?
2008-10-10T12:44:00.000Z	genii	utnubudnai	You should, yes
