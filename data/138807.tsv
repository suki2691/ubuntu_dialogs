2007-04-19T05:25:00.000Z	calliope		hey there, yesterday I installed ubuntu 6.10 from cd and it just finished running all the updates and the 2.6.17.11 kernel (but I havent rebooted yet) what is the best way to upgrade to Ubuntu 7 ??
2007-04-19T05:26:00.000Z	grayman	calliope	update-manager
2007-04-19T05:31:00.000Z	calliope	grayman	well i just ran all the updates from synaptic package manager and the update-manager just ends up loading synaptic again. so what am i missing here? perhaps there has been some user-guide or faq for upgrading to ubuntu 7
2007-04-19T05:32:00.000Z	grayman	calliope	hmm, well the upgrade is not officially available yet
