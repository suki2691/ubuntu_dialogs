2011-09-24T21:17:00.000Z	Headcase_Fargone		Attempting to create two 3TB extended partitions, but disk utility and even GParted GUI don't seem to want anything to do with a partition over 2TB.  Each throws different errors.
2011-09-24T21:17:00.000Z	Headcase_Fargone		So I came across a page describing a way to create them using the parted command from console.  Followed the instructions and I *appear* to have a partition but I'm unable to do anything at all with it
2011-09-24T21:17:00.000Z	Headcase_Fargone		Can't create files/directories, etc
2011-09-24T21:18:00.000Z	llua	Headcase_Fargone	permission problem?
