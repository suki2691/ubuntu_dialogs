2007-06-27T12:44:00.000Z	Spud__		Hello people.  I just installed Ubuntu 7.04 64bit on my machine, and everything is working great. However, I have two internal hard drives, and I want to format the second unused HDD and put a swap partition on it.  Can anyone tell me how I might go about that?

2007-06-27T12:46:00.000Z	Spud__	LyleM	Well, I have 2GB of RAM, but I do like playing modern games and stuff
2007-06-27T12:49:00.000Z	LyleM	Spud__	i would use gparted and make a new partition on that drive and make it partition
