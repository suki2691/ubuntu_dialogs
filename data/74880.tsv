2009-08-17T18:50:00.000Z	eraggo		i have little problem with my ubuntu. It does collect all memory. now 99% collected... (22% for programs and 77% for cache) how i can release some memory?
2009-08-17T18:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	eraggo	the system/kernel/os will release it when needed
2009-08-17T18:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	eraggo	no; no problem. Unused RAM == wasted ram
2009-08-17T18:52:00.000Z	eraggo	erUSUL	thanks for that information :)
