2011-01-05T08:57:00.000Z	GeekSquid	Steve973	php will do that with ease ... just look on google for a php based file upload script
2011-01-05T08:58:00.000Z	Steve973	GeekSquid	I say "deployable" because I don't want to use a library and develop the capability.
2011-01-05T09:03:00.000Z	GeekSquid	Steve973	you are running a webserver, HTTP POST FileUpload in apache is what does what you want, but really there isn't any development to do what you want, as it has already been done
