2008-12-02T13:01:00.000Z	turuburu	defrysk	i m used at ubuntu at home (desktops). at server i have debian. i m thinking if  i must switch to ubuntu, if it will be easier to administer, and updated
2008-12-02T13:01:00.000Z	turuburu	defrysk	i mean what is the next trustworthy server version. since you propose no 8.10, then 9.04? to prefer only LTS versions?
2008-12-02T13:02:00.000Z	turuburu	defrysk	what this means?
