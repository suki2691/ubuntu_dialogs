2009-01-06T13:18:00.000Z	rww	ndlovu	They don't have character sets associated with them. Text editors autodetect.
2009-01-06T13:19:00.000Z	rww	ndlovu	if you're seeing squares, either 1) your editor autodetected wrong, or 2) the font you're using doesn't support that character
2009-01-06T13:19:00.000Z	ndlovu	rww	any idea how to force a different character encoding?
