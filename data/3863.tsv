2012-04-24T01:31:00.000Z	MrKeuner		hello, how do I mount a private home directory for my user? That was automatically done when the hard drive it is on was in my computer. Now it's an external disk connected via USB cable...

I suggest not to do this. your account might become unusable if it doesn't find any files when the disk isn't connectted. instead, only put your private files it it.

2012-04-24T01:37:00.000Z	MirkoKa	MrKeuner	I have never tried an encryped home partition, so let me suggest another method: use encfs and its gui front-end cryptkeeper to encrypt only those (data) directories with your sensitive files
