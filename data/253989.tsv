2010-05-16T06:15:00.000Z	thisb		whats a good all around IDE?
2010-05-16T06:15:00.000Z	aperson	thisb	I like geany, but you can't really call that an ide
2010-05-16T06:16:00.000Z	aperson	thisb	so you're looking for a good editor, not a full on ide like eclipse?
2010-05-16T06:16:00.000Z	aperson	thisb	then I definitely recommend geany
