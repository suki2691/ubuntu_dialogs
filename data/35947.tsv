2010-07-13T03:26:00.000Z	T3CHKOMMIE	dugger5688	do you have any experince with the XBMC liveCD?
2010-07-13T03:28:00.000Z	dugger5688	T3CHKOMMIE	None whatsoever, but I think it's ubuntu based. I know alot of people have used it to install on very cheap atom boxes
2010-07-13T03:29:00.000Z	T3CHKOMMIE	dugger5688	ya, i have some old pc's i wanted to re-purpose as XBMC front ends, i have two old xboxes and i love having all my media in a central location, but i never had the live disk take off, i actually think its knoppix based, or atleast i remember alot of the tools i used for XBMC were knoppix based... you know, for dual-booting that old peice of hardware.
