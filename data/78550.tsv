2008-09-23T17:59:00.000Z	OoRal	ircmac	System -> Preferences -> Screen resolution
2008-09-23T18:01:00.000Z	ircmac	OoRal	yes fine, but when I boot with my monitor connected through a kvm the system will boot with only 800x600
2008-09-23T18:01:00.000Z	OoRal	ircmac	OK then, I dunno, having never been in that situation, I can't help. *laptop user*
