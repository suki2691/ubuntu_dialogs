2010-03-06T00:17:00.000Z	fourdfourm		I'm trying to set it up so users authenticate using radius. What's the typical way to do this, if any? radiusclient1? I have a Cisco ACS I want to authenticate against.

2010-03-06T00:20:00.000Z	ikonia	fourdfourm	you need to use something like the openradia client and going pam to use it
