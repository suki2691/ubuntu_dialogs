2006-04-03T12:26:00.000Z	NiklasH_work	Dempsy	just comment out the cd line in /etc/apt/sources.list. Then apt only uses the online repositories
2006-04-03T12:28:00.000Z	Dempsy	NiklasH_work	should i uncomment all the repositories? or just the supported ones?
2006-04-03T12:29:00.000Z	NiklasH_work	Dempsy	i have all repositories uncommented. works fine for me :)
