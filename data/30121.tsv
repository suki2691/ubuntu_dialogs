2010-06-19T14:21:00.000Z	Guest85294		I'm having difficulty partitioning. Can I just setup a new /dev/sdb and put Linux on that and leave windows on /dev/sda?

2010-06-19T14:22:00.000Z	Guest85294		My windows installation has a lot of partitions.. and thus when i try to install Linux it says " unusable
2010-06-19T14:23:00.000Z	vu1kan	Guest85294	i would suggest the 'guided partitioning' option when installing ubuntu from cd
