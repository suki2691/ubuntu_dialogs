2010-02-12T01:52:00.000Z	stianhj		Is there any reason why my gnome-panel is using 130Mb+ of memory?
2010-02-12T01:52:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	stianhj	do you have any applets on it that might use a bit of memory?
2010-02-12T01:53:00.000Z	stianhj	SpaceGhostC2C	just the standard applets + deluge.. i had the system-monitor applet as well, but just removed it
2010-02-12T01:57:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	stianhj	well come applets use a bit of memory, others quite a bit.
