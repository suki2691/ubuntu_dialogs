2008-01-18T11:57:00.000Z	MasterNix		how do I start ssh daemon?
2008-01-18T11:57:00.000Z	Rubin	MasterNix	install the package called 'ssh'
2008-01-18T11:58:00.000Z	Rubin	MasterNix	the ssh package installs the sshd (server)
2008-01-18T12:01:00.000Z	Rubin	MasterNix	it should start by itself.. but /etc/init.d/anything start|stop|restart etc is how you manage services
