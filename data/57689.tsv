2012-05-28T11:01:00.000Z	Ek|mu5		kannel-sqlbox is giving me errors with postgresql. the connection is defined properly and there is no MySQL section but sqlbox still asks for a MySQL connection definition
2012-05-28T11:03:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	bazhang	relevant error message:  SQLBOX: MySQL: connection settings for id 'sqlbox-db' are not specified!
