2010-12-18T22:32:00.000Z	dh003i		also, now for some reason, my USB stick isn't being auto-mounted by 10.10 when I stick it in
2010-12-18T22:33:00.000Z	dh003i		I think I'm gonna stick in my backup hard drive and back up everything on /, /boot, /home, /var, and /tmp ... if I do that, I should be able to install windows, repartition, then put everything back on the appropriate partitions, reinstall grub, hen boot again, right?
2010-12-18T22:34:00.000Z	izinucs	dh003i	yep.. although partimage/clonezilla might make it easier
2010-12-18T22:37:00.000Z	dh003i	izinucs	ok, but partitionimage/clonezilla would be duplicating my current partition layout, right? and my current partition layout (while it still works), ahs weird stuff happening...see http://pastebin.com/PJ81Mz9Z
