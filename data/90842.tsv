2009-09-04T09:40:00.000Z	anomoly		I'm trying to use gconftool-2 to change a panel launcher icon from the command line to no avail, anyone have experience w/ this?
2009-09-04T09:40:00.000Z	cwillu	anomoly	why not just edit the properties of the launcher by right clicking on it?
2009-09-04T09:41:00.000Z	anomoly	cwillu	I'd like to change the icon from a script
2009-09-04T09:41:00.000Z	anomoly	cwillu	the script opens/closes and ssh tunnel. I'd like the icon to change when the tunnel exists
