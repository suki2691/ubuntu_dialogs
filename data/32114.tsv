2010-05-11T19:08:00.000Z	sdk		I've been working on this for days.  I have a Radeon 4890 w/ a TV in my living room and my system an primary monitor in my bedroom. The radeon insists the primary monitor is the TV, so all menus are there.  This is w/ both catalyst and Ubuntu native drivers.  Does anyone know how to force the graphics card to set the VGA as primary monitor?

2010-05-11T19:09:00.000Z	remrot	sdk	last time I ised the catalyst, there has been an option for this...
2010-05-11T19:18:00.000Z	sdk	remrot	I've been through every menu in Catalyst.  I dont think it's catalyst thing.  Even with catalyst unintstlled, the Ubuntu 'display' sets the TV as primary.  Could it be xrandr?
