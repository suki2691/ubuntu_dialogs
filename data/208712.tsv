2007-03-31T13:55:00.000Z	AtlanticBoy		Hello. Is it possible to upgrade from edgy to feisty without having to uninstall the current release ?
2007-03-31T13:57:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	AtlanticBoy	nope, unless u get another partition for it
2007-03-31T13:57:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	AtlanticBoy	but then it will be a fresh install, and not upgrade
2007-03-31T13:58:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	AtlanticBoy	try /join #ubuntu+1 for more info on Feisty
