2011-09-29T17:59:00.000Z	Islam		I have a problem when I log on to ubuntu it shows an error and says, you need to load kernel first
2011-09-29T18:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	Islam	 you mean the grub loader says that?
2011-09-29T18:00:00.000Z	Islam	dr_willis	yes
2011-09-29T18:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	Islam	  make a bootable flash drive perhaps.
