2005-11-08T13:34:00.000Z	Shadikka		I have a little problem for once again ^^ *wirn*
2005-11-08T13:34:00.000Z	Shadikka		I reinstalled Windows and managed to overwrite my MBR.
2005-11-08T13:34:00.000Z	Shadikka		I can get to my filesystem through a sysrescue cd, so what should I run to reinstall grub?
