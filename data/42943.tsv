2010-06-28T20:28:00.000Z	Roasted_		So I'm in a weird situation. I'm on a Windows network with completely screwed up DNS tables and I'm trying to find the IP of another Ubuntu box on the network. Out of 2,000 clients, there's only 5 Linux boxes on the network. Is there any way I can "scoop" up the clients that are Linux based and not Windows based so I can probe each one to find which is the file server I need?
