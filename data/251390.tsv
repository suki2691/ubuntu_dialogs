2011-03-14T04:42:00.000Z	AlecUbuntuUser		Jasa, could you point me in the direction of something like.... a graphic equaliser for ubuntu 10.10 x64 please? alot of google results are out-datad; seems Alsa is new
2011-03-14T04:43:00.000Z	AlecUbuntuUser		this will provide some idea at least.
2011-03-14T04:44:00.000Z	josh_	AlecUbuntuUser	I know you said graphical.. for Alsa I use alsamixer :) I just saw that going by though and haven't been following the convo. Maybe helps?
