2008-08-01T16:38:00.000Z	eshat		Hi all, is there a way, that a file cannot be opened twice ? We are a root group and I want to prevend 2 persons editing the same config, because one will lose his changes if the other overwrites the file ?
2008-08-01T16:39:00.000Z	anirudh0	eshat	put it under svn :P
2008-08-01T16:41:00.000Z	anirudh0		it accepts
2008-08-01T16:41:00.000Z	eshat	anirudh0	I am talking about server configs, etc. So the file has to be on that server and not in a svn directory
