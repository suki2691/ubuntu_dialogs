2009-01-20T09:21:00.000Z	n2diy		Yesterday I up dated Hardy, rebooted etc... Today, my computer was running really slow, so I logged out, and when I logged back in, I had not tool bar or system tray!?  I created a desktop icon for Xterm, and did a shutdown -h, restarted, , logged in, and the bars are back! What happened?

2009-01-20T09:25:00.000Z	xorlim	n2diy	basically you want to find out the name of every process that does something to your desktop. if you know the name of the process, then you know the name of the binary or script used to start the process.
