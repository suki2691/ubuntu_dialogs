2012-06-08T13:03:00.000Z	Curt``		Hello. I'm currently using 12.04. I've been trying to find a way to map shift+capslock to toggle caps lock, unsuccessfully. I currently have caps lock as a backspace key.
2012-06-08T13:04:00.000Z	rileyp	Curt``	 maybe xmodmap
2012-06-08T13:23:00.000Z	Curt``	rileyp	this may be a silly question but.. how do i install xmodmap? apt-get install xmodmap says: "Package xmodmap is not available, but is referred to by another package." ... "However the following packages replace it:\  x11-xserver-utils:i386 x11-xserver-utils"
2012-06-08T13:24:00.000Z	rileyp	Curt``	 so how about apt get install x11-xserver-utils
