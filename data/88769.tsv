2008-07-19T03:16:00.000Z	kdavid		Can some one help me please?   I installed Cairo but I get this message in terminal: cairo-dock: error while loading shared libraries: libglitz-glx.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2008-07-19T03:16:00.000Z	PriceChild	kdavid	sudo apt-get install libglitz-glx1
2008-07-19T03:18:00.000Z	kdavid	PriceChild	I just tried to install it but it says I already have the newest version
2008-07-19T03:20:00.000Z	kdavid	PriceChild	Is there a possibility that something else is already running that is using that file I have Compix-fusion
