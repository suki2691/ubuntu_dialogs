2012-01-28T21:49:00.000Z	grungekid		Hey guys, Very quick question. I am using an ATI card with ubuntu 11.10 with proprietary drivers. The performance on unity is terrible(laggy window dragging etc) so I have had to switch to unity 2d. Is this a known issue and should I just assume that the ati drivers are shoddy and stick with unity 2d? Cheers for your help :)
