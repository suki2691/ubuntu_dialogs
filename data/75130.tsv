2009-11-20T02:24:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	donavan_	good question: does it crash  everywhere or on specific sites?
2009-11-20T02:26:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	donavan_	I have issues with certain sites, though complete crashes are rare....some sites, like cbc.ca/news refuse to even load the content
2009-11-20T02:27:00.000Z	ScabbyMadman	donavan_	that does happen  here once in awhile but rarely
