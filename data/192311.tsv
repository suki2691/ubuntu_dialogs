2006-05-01T10:27:00.000Z	harisund	holy_cow	looks like I will have to end up doing that only. Just wanted to make sure that nothing gets broken along the way.
2006-05-01T10:27:00.000Z	holy_cow	harisund	*nod* mostly its foolproof, but stuff does happen ... i've never had a debian / ubuntu system unfixeable doing an upgrade
2006-05-01T10:28:00.000Z	harisund	holy_cow	Yeah, I agree with that.I really do bow down to the power of apt in that regard.
