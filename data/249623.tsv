2009-07-09T19:02:00.000Z	Boohbah		i'm trying to setup en_US.UTF-8 locale on an ubuntu 8.04 OpenVZ container. i installed language-pack-en-base but running 'locale' shows everything set to POSIX. any ideas?
2009-07-09T19:03:00.000Z	Seveas	Boohbah	edit /etc/environment, make sure the locale is available in /var/lib/locale/supported.d
2009-07-09T19:11:00.000Z	Boohbah	Seveas	hmm, i have added LANG and LANGUAGE="en_US.utf8" to /etc/environment but I don't have a /var/lib/locale/supported.d ... do you know which package contains this or how i should create it?
2009-07-09T19:12:00.000Z	Seveas	Boohbah	/var/lib/locales/supported.d sorry :)
