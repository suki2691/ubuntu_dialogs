2008-08-31T03:54:00.000Z	lauren4667		can anyone help me? the machine will only start in failsafe low graphics mode now
2008-08-31T03:55:00.000Z	lmartin92	lauren4667	probably a X problem
2008-08-31T03:56:00.000Z	lauren4667	lmartin92	yeah, so it seems from looking at the forums.  seems i should restore xorg from back up, but i'm not sure i follow how to do that..
