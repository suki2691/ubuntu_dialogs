2006-05-27T05:50:00.000Z	eCokeNCod	Firezip	why not ? install windows first ... then install ubuntu, and grub pretty much takes care of everything
2006-05-27T05:50:00.000Z	eCokeNCod	Firezip	are you installing on separate hard drives ?
2006-05-27T05:52:00.000Z	eCokeNCod	Firezip	we're gonna need a bit more than that ot work with. Cold you be more specific
