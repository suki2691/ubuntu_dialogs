2008-08-03T00:13:00.000Z	viat0r		can i mount and copy files from another cdrom while running the live cd?
2008-08-03T00:13:00.000Z	soundray	viat0r	sure, if you have a second CD drive
2008-08-03T00:15:00.000Z	soundray	viat0r	probably /dev/cdrom1
2008-08-03T00:20:00.000Z	soundray	viat0r	you have to do something like 'sudo mount /dev/cdrom1 /mnt'
