2007-05-14T06:30:00.000Z	preaction	sp1d3r	what kind of processor do you have?
2007-05-14T06:30:00.000Z	sp1d3r	preaction	Athlon AMD
2007-05-14T06:31:00.000Z	preaction	sp1d3r	the athlon XP? you have to buy another Athlon XP. I believe they use "socket 7", but that doesn't matter. i have yet to see two different processors that use the same socket
