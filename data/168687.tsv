Your 64-bit guest will fail to detect a 64-bit CPU and will not be able to boot. Please ensure that you have enabled VT-x/AMD-V properly in the BIOS of your host computer."
2010-05-09T19:02:00.000Z	scunizi	linux_is_my_hero	have you looked in your bios for the VT-x/AMD-V switch to see if it's on?
2010-05-09T19:03:00.000Z	scunizi	linux_is_my_hero	sometimes you have to look for the word "virtual" or some iteration of it..
