2008-09-24T00:25:00.000Z	lch		hi, ubuntu doesn't correctly determine my native display resolution at plug&play, and it doesn't save my settings when I set it to "LCD 1024x768" in gtk-displayconfig, what can I do about that?
2008-09-24T00:26:00.000Z	SiDi	lch	if your card is a nvidia one, i would recommand you to install your drivers (see ubuntu doc for how to do it safely), and then use the nvidia-settings software for setting my screen res
2008-09-24T00:26:00.000Z	SiDi	lch	nvidia-settings recognises more screens and resolutions than ubuntu
2008-09-24T00:27:00.000Z	SiDi	lch	you can also google about "screen resolution xorg.conf" ;)
