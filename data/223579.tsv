2006-05-29T13:52:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	DJ__Danni	can you still boot by selecting the previous kernel in grub ?
2006-05-29T14:01:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	DJ__Danni	just after you turn her on, do you see the message "Loading GRUB.." before it crashes?
2006-05-29T14:03:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	DJ__Danni	just after that it will give you a list of boot options... press the down arrow twice to pick the older kernel, then press enter.
