2008-06-30T21:28:00.000Z	greenfishx3		how come some old general commands like "del" doesnt exsist in ubuntu?
2008-06-30T21:28:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	greenfishx3	because this isn't DOS
2008-06-30T21:48:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	greenfishx3	I suggest a different book. that one seems to have lots of bad info. maybe you should try "linux administration guide"
2008-06-30T21:49:00.000Z	greenfishx3	Seven_Six_Two	so this is yet another bad part from the author? creating a hard link and removing it will NEVER remove the source as well?
