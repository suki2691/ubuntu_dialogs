2007-10-08T15:14:00.000Z	koudelka_		will there be any major differences between the beta iso of 7.10 that is out now and the real release in 10 days?
2007-10-08T15:15:00.000Z	dgjones	koudelka_	probably, since the beta was released, there's been about 400+ updates that I've downloaded
2007-10-08T15:16:00.000Z	koudelka_	dgjones	but as long as i download those updates the system will be the same as the realease? i don't have to reinstall if i try the beta now?
2007-10-08T15:17:00.000Z	dgjones	koudelka_	i'm not certain, you're probably better asking in #ubuntu+1
