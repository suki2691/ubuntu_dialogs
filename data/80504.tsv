2008-09-25T02:28:00.000Z	EatShrooms	vallhalla82	torrents are better I think
2008-09-25T02:28:00.000Z	EatShrooms	vallhalla82	get on a private tracker
2008-09-25T02:29:00.000Z	EatShrooms	vallhalla82	google maybe. I was on a private tracker called what.cd, it's pretty much for only music though. Very quality tracker if you get in
