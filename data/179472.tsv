2011-01-28T18:40:00.000Z	jrib	Kronusdark	you don't want gdm to startup?
2011-01-28T18:41:00.000Z	jrib	Kronusdark	if you read /etc/init/gdm.conf it hints that you can add "text" to your kernel line in grub to have gdm not start
2011-01-28T18:42:00.000Z	jrib	Kronusdark	edit /etc/default/grub and modify GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT, run update-grub, update the existing entries in /boot/grub/grub.cfg too
