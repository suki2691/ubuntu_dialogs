2006-02-22T12:29:00.000Z	bozzu		i share my homedir with samba. it works, but i have two questions: is there something that notify connection attempts? and how can i hide/don't share the hidden file with samba?
2006-02-22T12:30:00.000Z	ablomen	bozzu	you can hide files by changing the permissions so only you can see them
2006-02-22T12:32:00.000Z	bozzu	ablomen	i know that, but i don't want to see the dot.files in my homedir when accessing that dir with a windows computer. i use user security so changing standard permission does not work i think
2006-02-22T12:33:00.000Z	ablomen	bozzu	yeah thats right, maybe you should try the #samba room or something
