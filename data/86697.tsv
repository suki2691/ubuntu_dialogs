2008-06-30T02:27:00.000Z	joe__		hey, I'm running with an onboard ati video chip, and thinking about enabling compiz, but without the proprietary drivers it says I can only do it with a resolution 1024x1024 or lower. Would installing the proprietary drivers let me run compiz in a higher resolution or should I not bother trying?

2008-06-30T02:30:00.000Z	joe__	snova	thanks for the help. I guess I'll try installing them. I'm just coming from a gentoo system and am now wary of changing lots of stuff. My ubuntu system seems all clean and new to me now =]
