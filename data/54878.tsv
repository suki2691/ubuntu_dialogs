2009-08-02T22:55:00.000Z	xathullu		heather: acer and aspire both had some serious issues with drivers, it sounds to me like you are having the same driver prob i did with ibex, try checking out your drivers in hard drive manager, also google wich drivers u should be using with your particular model. I need more info to help

2009-08-02T22:56:00.000Z	Heather	xathullu	Nope. Not an issue like that. I was using this very same driver with this very same hardware three hours ago before the reinstall and there were no issues.
2009-08-02T22:57:00.000Z	Heather	xathullu	Easy. My setup was EXACTLY the same as it is now, a fresh install from the ubuntu CD
