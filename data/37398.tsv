2010-02-13T06:17:00.000Z	seanamber		guys, i was running with bad memory for a while, and i have reason to believe that my packages got a bit messed up.  isnt there a way to go through my packages and my disk to fix the errors?
2010-02-13T06:18:00.000Z	JStoone	seanamber	have you tried to "sudo apt-get update"? and then use the Update-Manager?
2010-02-13T06:22:00.000Z	JStoone	seanamber	is there some specific apps that does not work correctly? If there are witch?
2010-02-13T06:25:00.000Z	JStoone	seanamber	well errors are some bitches but they are only dangerous when they slap you the second time (;
