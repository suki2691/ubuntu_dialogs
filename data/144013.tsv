2007-10-19T10:10:00.000Z	dimych		I have 6.06, and want to upgrade to 7.10. Is there a way to skip 6.10 and 7.04, or at least install them (from network) without downloading the full distros?

2007-10-19T10:12:00.000Z	dimych	IcemanV9	yes, I unrstand that I can not jump, but perhaps there is a way to install only kernel and main libs of 6.10 and 7.04?
