2006-10-07T14:32:00.000Z	gzevspero		Hi, I'm a new ubuntu user, and am trying to repartition amy ntfs drive so I can load ubuntu on the new partition... it won't let me partition it though, neither in the partitioning portion of the install cd nor using gparted in ubuntu live. Any suggestions?
2006-10-07T14:34:00.000Z	gzevspero		It creates a new partition but doesn't give it the volume I specified... I want to resize my existign ntfs to 40GB and leave 40GB for the new one, but after I hit apply it just gives me 5MB for the new partition and the rest to the existing one
2006-10-07T14:35:00.000Z	cherubiel	gzevspero	get the gparted live cd dude, non destruvtive on ntfs too... works like a charm
2006-10-07T14:47:00.000Z	cherubiel	gzevspero	yep
