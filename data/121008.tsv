2007-09-27T05:00:00.000Z	hou5ton		I have installed all the codecs and done things I found suggested in the forums, and still ... when I try to play a .mov file with Totem Movie Player, the application immediately shuts down
2007-09-27T05:01:00.000Z	murkyMurk	hou5ton	yeah, Titem can do that, Use mplayer or vlc
2007-09-27T05:03:00.000Z	hou5ton	murkyMurk	 do you have a suggestion as to which one would be the best for .mov files ... or the all around best choice?
2007-09-27T05:04:00.000Z	murkyMurk	hou5ton	I always swear by mplayer but vlc is actually slightlt better with video files so if you must choose go with vlc
