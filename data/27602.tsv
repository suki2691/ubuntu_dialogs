2010-08-13T00:12:00.000Z	elkclone	doc100	my install  connected auto the 2nd time I rebooted.
2010-08-13T00:12:00.000Z	elkclone		first time I had  to enter the wireless pass.
2010-08-13T00:13:00.000Z	doc100	elkclone	But did you have wireless instantly at login? My computer remember it's WiFi (its a desktop, so it never changes), and autojoins, but I have to wait like 30 seconds after my desktop loads for it to connect.
