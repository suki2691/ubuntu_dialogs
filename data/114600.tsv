2008-04-03T18:29:00.000Z	Gatestone		What do you use for IRC? I am starting to get sick to this Pidgin, but is there any better than going back to xchat-gnome?
2008-04-03T18:30:00.000Z	compwiz18	Gatestone	you can use xchat (but not the -gnome version), irssi, and konversation are some I can think of off the top of my heat
2008-04-03T18:31:00.000Z	Gatestone	compwiz18	what do you mean I can not use xchat Gnome version? I can, but I am thinking if there is anything better.
2008-04-03T18:32:00.000Z	compwiz18	Gatestone	there is an xchat, and an xchat-gnome -- I prefer xchat to xchat-gnome myself, check your package manager :)
