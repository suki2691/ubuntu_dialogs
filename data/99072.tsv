2009-05-27T12:29:00.000Z	ramontayag		need a bit of help. i installed vista first, then ubuntu. I get the grub dual boot menu. However, when I first choose vista, the next time I reboot it goes straight to vista. I have to go boot up the desktop with gparted and remove the "boot" flag from the vista partition. what should I do to keep the bootable partition the ubuntu one so grub shows up all the time?

2009-05-27T12:32:00.000Z	ramontayag	Jordan_U	- yes, however, both OSes are in 1 drive. the other is for storage.
