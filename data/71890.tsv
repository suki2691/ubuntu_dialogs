2008-12-07T02:32:00.000Z	blendroid		I just deleted Ubuntu from my system, but GRUB remains as the bootloader and keeps giving me Error 17 or 21.  I don't have a Windows installation cd as my computer has a builtin recovery drive (which I can't access because of GRUB).  Could anyone help?

2008-12-07T02:35:00.000Z	blendroid	M25	I'm unable to boot into my recovery drive because of GRUB (or rather, what remains of GRUB.  I would assume it would still let me boot into windows if it was all there.)
