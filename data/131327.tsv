2007-06-09T10:08:00.000Z	aamy		i'm a total linux newbie, downloaded the latest release of ubuntu and burned to a CD. I tried to run it from the CD and I got a bunch of errors which ended with 'X Server failed to start. Do you want to diagnose?' Any ideas?

2007-06-09T10:09:00.000Z	icanic		but I'm new too
