2012-04-27T23:36:00.000Z	benjamindaines		(fedora creates a separate partition for /home)
2012-04-27T23:37:00.000Z	violinappren	benjamindaines	why didn't you select manual partitioning in the installer?
2012-04-27T23:38:00.000Z	benjamindaines	violinappren	I did, but there was no option to keep the partition... would only let me choose "do not use"
