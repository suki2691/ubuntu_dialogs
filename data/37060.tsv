2010-02-19T11:03:00.000Z	abhi_nav	fixworx	u can install google earth by downloading setup file from their website
2010-02-19T11:04:00.000Z	abhi_nav	fixworx	i have installed it
2010-02-19T11:04:00.000Z	fixworx	abhi_nav	i'll give it a shot, thanks :) just wondering if someone maintains a repository for something like all the software that exists for ubuntu
