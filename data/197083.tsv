When i click on the folder it asks me for a username and password, but when I try to put in the username and password that I added they never work.

2007-04-25T07:43:00.000Z	noiesmo	LaserLine	sudo smbpasswd and then enter a password
2007-04-25T07:45:00.000Z	LaserLine	noiesmo	I did that, but when trying to access the folder it prompts me for a username and password and t still doesn't work
