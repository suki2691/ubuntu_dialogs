2011-03-17T11:36:00.000Z	arand	Device	ctrl+alt+F2 login and kill things, or if that doesn't work, reisub.
2011-03-17T11:37:00.000Z	Device	arand	i cant get any keyboard access at all, i tried that already. i even lost the mouse now too.
2011-03-17T11:38:00.000Z	Device	arand	i almost want to cry lol. the ever faithful ubuntu has crashed on me for the first time ever...
