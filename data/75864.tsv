2009-11-14T07:52:00.000Z	kbp		Does any one use wireless mouse on Ubuntu 9.04? When you right click on desktop sometimes it creates a new folder instead of show properties menu. Does anyone experience that?
2009-11-14T07:53:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	kbp	it is probably sending a double click on the right button. i had a mouse start doing this. it was just old though.
2009-11-14T07:53:00.000Z	kbp	bastid_raZor	is there any chance to fix it?
2009-11-14T07:54:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	kbp	my mouse was old. required the purchase of another. not saying that is your problem but it has similiar symptoms
