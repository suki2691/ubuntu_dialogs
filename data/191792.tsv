2006-05-05T12:55:00.000Z	black_hk		Hi guys some money matters : i have been using a lot of free/open source programs for my job and for business purpose. I didn't pay anything so far. But these programs are fantastic. For example : Ubuntu OS, Openoffice, XMMS, Bluefish... etc etc. Anyone knows who is paying for the development and other expenses? I was wondering !!!
