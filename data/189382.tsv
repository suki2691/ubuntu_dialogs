2010-12-31T09:46:00.000Z	econ		its for privoxy. I've never edited a config file before, so this might be a really newb question but i'm reading the documentation on how to set it up here   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Privoxy
2010-12-31T09:47:00.000Z	econ		and in the part where he says to jump to line 661 or whatever, I don't see any actual line numbers/don't know how to jump anywhere. all I see are the # comments talking about the config file
2010-12-31T09:47:00.000Z	coz_	econ	 is this opened in a text editor?
