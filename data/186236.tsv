2007-02-08T08:33:00.000Z	David2007		Basic question - I just downloaded 6.10 - what do I do know to install / upgrade?
2007-02-08T08:34:00.000Z	David2007		So I need to burn to CD?
2007-02-08T08:34:00.000Z	GaiaX11	David2007	put the cd in the drive and follow the steps to install
2007-02-08T08:39:00.000Z	GaiaX11	David2007	burn the .iso into a cd and them put the cd in the drive and install it. But first backup all your data :-) this is the better way
