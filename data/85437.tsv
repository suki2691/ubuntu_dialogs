2008-12-08T20:20:00.000Z	xfm		hello. I am on Ubuntu Intrepid. When I watch a video (vlc or streaming) the sound sometimes disapears during 20 seconds approximatively, then reappears. How can I fix this?
2008-12-08T20:21:00.000Z	mphill	xfm	is it like that in all players, totem, vlc, mplayer, etc?
2008-12-08T20:22:00.000Z	xfm	mphill	it seams so, cause I use mplayer for the streamings
2008-12-08T20:29:00.000Z	xfm	mphill	could it be pulseaudio who decides that another application needs the canal and shut mine?
