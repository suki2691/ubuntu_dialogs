2011-05-06T18:08:00.000Z	rargya		Hi I have a question. If I am using an outdated Live CD now, would it be possible for me to download an updated copy of Ubuntu and install it from this live session?
2011-05-06T18:09:00.000Z	rargya		4GB
2011-05-06T18:10:00.000Z	rargya		So what I'm to do here, is make a live CD on the USB drive, and install from there?
