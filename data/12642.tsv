2011-09-01T22:20:00.000Z	beniwtv	TehAndrewRyan	ALSA is already installed by default
2011-09-01T22:20:00.000Z	TehAndrewRyan	beniwtv	yes but i want to use it instead of PulseAudio since i'm getting sick latency in skype
2011-09-01T22:22:00.000Z	beniwtv	TehAndrewRyan	I'm not experiencing any lag here in Skype, so I'm not much of a help here.
