2006-07-06T13:13:00.000Z	snoops		I have to admit it does suck when you install dapper fresh and 90meg of updates shows up
2006-07-06T13:15:00.000Z	snoops		if I would use ubuntu on a network setup.. eg 10 or so computers running it, can I setup a central server to grab the updates off locally? That way only one machine needs to get the updates?
2006-07-06T13:16:00.000Z	Terminus	snoops	sure you can.
2006-07-06T13:17:00.000Z	Terminus	snoops	i can think of lots of ways to do it. rsync, your own repos, etc.
