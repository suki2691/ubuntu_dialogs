2006-01-15T16:47:00.000Z	jenda		Anyone know why my kernel won't upgrade to 2.6.12-10 and is stuck at -9?
2006-01-15T16:48:00.000Z	iKernel	jenda	:D I'm pretty sure 2.6.12 comes with ubuntu-breezy
2006-01-15T16:48:00.000Z	iKernel	jenda	2.6.12-10 sorry
2006-01-15T16:49:00.000Z	jenda	iKernel	well apt-get most definitely downgraded mine, then... it's at -9
