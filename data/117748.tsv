2011-04-12T11:05:00.000Z	white_magic		hey, when I mount ntfs volumes, they receive amazingly specific names like 'system reserved' or 'local disk' and get mounted on my desktop (or shortcuts with these names are created)
2011-04-12T11:05:00.000Z	white_magic		regardless of what my mount point is
2011-04-12T11:06:00.000Z	white_magic		can i change these involuntary shortcuts' names?
2011-04-12T11:06:00.000Z	randomness	white_magic	'system reserved' is win7's boot partition afaik
