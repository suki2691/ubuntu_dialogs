2008-04-10T05:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	forrest	 what filesystem are they?  tune2fs for ext2/3 - i boot to windows to label vfat/ntfs
2008-04-10T05:34:00.000Z	forrest	Dr_willis	they were formated in Windows and I am pretty sure they have labels
2008-04-10T05:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	forrest	 by default under windows they give the disks a blank label from what ive seen.
