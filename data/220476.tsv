2007-01-25T15:13:00.000Z	Flannel	Ki-Chi-Mi	why do you need to do that?
2007-01-25T15:14:00.000Z	Flannel	Ki-Chi-Mi	right, you have a ubuntu CD, right? (desktop? or alternate?)
2007-01-25T15:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Ki-Chi-Mi	alright, put it in, use apt-cdrom to add the cd to the repositories, then you can install build-essential from that repository
