2007-06-10T12:34:00.000Z	Veinor		I need help with azureus: my torrents keep going down to 0 kb/s
2007-06-10T12:35:00.000Z	sivik	Veinor	that doesn't sound like a software issue, just let it run, the 0 kb/s just has to do with there isn't any ppl that are letting upload currently

2007-06-10T12:36:00.000Z	sivik	Veinor	not sure, try using bittorrent
