2006-02-22T13:28:00.000Z	Belboz99	Cryptid	what I mean by that is if my old Dell could do 1152x864 @ 75hz, I need to set the max refresh to 85hz.  That is the highest refresh my monitor was capable of.
2006-02-22T13:30:00.000Z	Cryptid	Belboz99	how do i know my monitors max refresh rate?? under Windows my desktop resolution use to be 1024x768 at refresh ra te of 85Hz
