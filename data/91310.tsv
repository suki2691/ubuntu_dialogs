2008-05-09T22:09:00.000Z	soundray	jtsigma	you may find something underneath /proc/scsi
2008-05-09T22:09:00.000Z	jtsigma	soundray	ya, i tried that but since i have logical raid through md, it shows up all as logical disk
2008-05-09T22:10:00.000Z	soundray	jtsigma	have you looked with hal-device-manager? (Or gnome-device-manager if you're on hardy)
