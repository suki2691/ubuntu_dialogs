2007-12-06T11:26:00.000Z	thor	bulmer	is there an lppasswd in ubuntu? My ubuntu box is offline right now and I am looking at a suse install
2007-12-06T11:27:00.000Z	thor	bulmer	I don't recall doing anything like that...must have been done in the install
2007-12-06T11:27:00.000Z	thor	bulmer	might be a difference since suse defines 'root' in the install
