2008-07-13T22:38:00.000Z	RB2		Hey everyone. I'm having a strange issue. Someone in winehq yesterday had me change some stuff in the PulseAudio setup to try to get a mic to appear to a Windows App. Now, the headset is the default sound device. I'd like to change it back.

2008-07-13T22:39:00.000Z	RB2	DarkAudit	The strangest part was that I booted up my machine this morning and I just plugged in the USB headset. As soon as I did, the startup sound played because it had been sitting there queued for this device. :-P
