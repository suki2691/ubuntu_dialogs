2010-09-06T17:33:00.000Z	nettezzaumana		i have serious preoblem .... my friend just deleted by accident his ~/.evolution/addressbook/local/system/addressbook.db .. is there any way to restore it? something like internal safety trash or so ..
2010-09-06T17:33:00.000Z	magnetron	nettezzaumana	how did he delete it? by putting it in the trash can?
2010-09-06T17:35:00.000Z	nettezzaumana	magnetron	no, by pressing some <yes> button *in evolution* because he titillated it that evolution asked inane Q: "do you want to remove your addressbook" ?
