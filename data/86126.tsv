2009-08-10T00:36:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	Lunis	 I ran the command ls from the terminal in the desktop folder and it's not returning anything. It's saying my desktop has nothing on it, when I can see that it has! How strange. That would explain the drag and drop, Linux can't see anything there.
2009-08-10T00:37:00.000Z	Lunis	SealedWithAKiss	`ls -A'
2009-08-10T00:37:00.000Z	SealedWithAKiss	Lunis	that command returns nothing.
