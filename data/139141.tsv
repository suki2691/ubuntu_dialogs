2008-02-05T09:47:00.000Z	macabro22		Hello I tried to install ALSA from source and broke my audio ( I did because my microphone wouldn't work). Now I can't seem to undo what I did. Sudo make unistall wont do. If I use the live CD sound works. How can I fix that please? I ve been looking fo a fix all day. Can someone please help me out?
