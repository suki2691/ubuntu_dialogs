2006-09-25T16:40:00.000Z	ntoll		hi, how so I mount a networked windows share from a windowsXP machine onto my ubuntu box? Ubuntu guide doesn't have any advice and googling just brings back stuff about reading an XP hard-drive partition rather than a network share... Pointers???? TIA
2006-09-25T16:40:00.000Z	ntoll		yup... I got that far... :-) is there a howto?
