2010-05-11T18:50:00.000Z	blablab		Hi! I have installed recently Lucid on a desktop, its running smoothly, but I noticed that SOME files that I try to delete from Lucid are bypassing the trash. Trash bypassing (it actually tries to send the file to trash but it prints an error msg like: cant send to trash, permanently delete only) seems to apply to any file located on another partition than where Lucid is (in my system case...
2010-05-11T18:50:00.000Z	blablab		...it also means that the problematic files that were made from older ubuntu/mint distributions). Files which have been created under Lucid are normally going to trash, no pbs here. Any idea, how to fix it so that any file to be deleted would go  through the trash bin?

If you try to delete a file on another partition it would mean the file is going to be copied over to your home folder, which is undesirable most of the times, and thus you will only get the option to permanently delete. If you wish to move it to your trash can, you will have to move the file there by hand.
