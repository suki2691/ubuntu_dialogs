2011-07-22T22:05:00.000Z	RavenHursT		so... I'm attempting to follow this walk through here: http://askubuntu.com/questions/18903/how-to-enable-trim but everytime I attempt to run the hdparm command.. I get "reading sector 5805056: FAILED: Input/output error"  any ideas?
2011-07-22T22:06:00.000Z	ikonia	RavenHursT	sounds like that sector has a fault
2011-07-22T22:06:00.000Z	ikonia	RavenHursT	ahhh, ActionParsnip is more realistic
2011-07-22T22:07:00.000Z	RavenHursT	ikonia	 if it's a bad sector.. then how is it able to create the temp file there?
