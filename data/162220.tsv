2007-05-21T11:09:00.000Z	ghostparty		hey I believe I messed up my 'sudo' command, can someone help me
2007-05-21T11:10:00.000Z	ghostparty		this is for the latest Ubuntu Feisty
2007-05-21T11:10:00.000Z	soothsay	ghostparty	You should just go ahead and explain what is messed up about it
2007-05-21T11:14:00.000Z	soothsay	ghostparty	What happens when you try running sudo (error message?). I believe you can boot with the 'recovery' option to get root access
