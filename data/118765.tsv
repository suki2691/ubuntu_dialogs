2009-01-23T00:50:00.000Z	petafile		I installed intrepid to dual boot w/ vista, and I just noticed today that there's not a grub option for vista.  Is there a tool to detect this for me, or do I have to edit menu.lst myself?

2009-01-23T00:55:00.000Z	petafile	bazhang	none of those seem to answer my question.  I CAN boot to ubuntu, but not vista.  I mount my ntfs partition in ubuntu, so I know the partition is OK
