2009-12-17T05:50:00.000Z	Chaosfactor		I want to install Ubuntu 9.10 in a dual boot setup with Windows 7. Which OS gets installed first. I tried to install it after Windows 7 and I keep on getting a GPT partition error during setup.

2009-12-17T05:51:00.000Z	Chaosfactor		Yes
2009-12-17T05:52:00.000Z	jtaji	Chaosfactor	you've probably never tried with a system with an EFI bios
