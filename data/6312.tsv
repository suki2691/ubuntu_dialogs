2012-03-01T23:53:00.000Z	hydrozen		is the dvd installer like the alternate installer? or more like the normal installer? I need LVM support..
2012-03-01T23:54:00.000Z	zykotic10	hydrozen	dvd is just cd with more languages
2012-03-01T23:54:00.000Z	hydrozen	zykotic10	ok so I still need to get the alternate installer if I want to setup LVM during the install
2012-03-01T23:55:00.000Z	zykotic10	hydrozen	i believe so, but i don't use LVM (i think alt or mini actually).  good luck.
