2010-04-08T02:28:00.000Z	drd_		ok... i've never worked with minux really, so here's a silly question
2010-04-08T02:29:00.000Z	drd_		why don't the executables have a file extension?
2010-04-08T02:29:00.000Z	drd_		i'm trying to run a program i just compiled from console, but i can't seem to do it
2010-04-08T02:29:00.000Z	brummbaer	drd_	executable is a property set with permissions, not file extensions
