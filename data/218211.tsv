2005-09-22T06:08:00.000Z	dldd		Hi, I'm trying to build ndis wrappers, but I get a message saying that gcc-3.4 is not found.  Can anybody tell me how to get that?
2005-09-22T06:09:00.000Z	Vespoli	dldd	 do not use 3.4!!!!
2005-09-22T06:10:00.000Z	dldd	Vespoli	that's the error I get.  It looks like I have 4.0 installed already
2005-09-22T06:13:00.000Z	dldd	Vespoli	 Is there some way I can tell it to use 4.0?
