2011-06-21T00:03:00.000Z	maverikh		ive actually read all those, im a noob basically... i have a program that installs its own postgre database within its folder. when i first install the app it works fine. if the server reboots itself the program stops working
2011-06-21T00:03:00.000Z	maverikh		the only way to fix it is to re-install app
