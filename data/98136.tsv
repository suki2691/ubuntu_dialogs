2009-05-23T09:55:00.000Z	ghindo	donavan	There could be a lot of reasons.  Could you go into more detail please?
2009-05-23T09:58:00.000Z	donavan	ghindo	 ifconfig looks good and it says I am connected ... I am using a different machine on the same switch and its ok but when ever I try to ping anything the packets just seem to go nowhere ... I have even plugged in my usb wifi card thinking it might be an issue with my wired card but I get  no conection with it either
2009-05-23T09:59:00.000Z	donavan	ghindo	  thought it might be an issue with tor or privoxy so I removed them ... and nothing ... rebooted a bunch restarted the links but its like I have a firewall thats just saying no you cant send anything out
