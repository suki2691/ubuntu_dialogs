2012-08-29T03:20:00.000Z	Kevin1a		I'm having a problem where my sound stutters badly and occasionally cuts in and out.  It happens in both Windows and Ubuntu.  It happens with the onboard audio, with a soundcard, with an external soundcard, and with my wireless headset (although it's worst with the soundcard).  I don't even know what to check next!
2012-08-29T03:22:00.000Z	KM0201	Kevin1a	if it's happening with both windows and ubuntu, your motherboard sound and a sound card... i would look at some sort of outside interference (something sitting near the speakers that might be interferring, or the speakers themselves being bad)
2012-08-29T03:25:00.000Z	Kevin1a	min|dvir|us	The motherboard is a proprietary board that came out of an HP media PC.  Unfortunetly I can't seem to find an updated bios or anything for it.  Probably not looking in the right places.  Any other suggestions?   KM0201: I tried with headphones and a different cable last night and still had issues, so I don't think it's the speakers.
