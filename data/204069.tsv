2006-10-15T15:45:00.000Z	webben		I'd like it to have a easy key combination i can press to get curly quotes just like on the Mac in all gnome apps... has anyone got any idea (or even better know a howto) for how to do that?
2006-10-15T13:07:00.000Z	webben		how could i remove and reinstall gnome?
2006-10-15T13:07:00.000Z	fredl	webben	- try apt-get --reinstall
2006-10-15T13:08:00.000Z	fredl	webben	although it's tricky since GNOME consists of a lot of packages.
