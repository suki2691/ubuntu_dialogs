2011-12-08T10:54:00.000Z	ecotrump	Sid_injector	are you accessing the folder through a terminal cmd or through the GUI?
2011-12-08T10:58:00.000Z	ecotrump	Sid_injector	yeah I would bet you need to access the folder through the terminal to gain permissions... not exactly sure how it's done though. Ima n00b
