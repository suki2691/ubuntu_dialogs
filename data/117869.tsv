2008-01-01T00:27:00.000Z	Abyssal		got a question concerning the options of my screen refresh rate: i got 2 options here. 60 or 75 Mhz. can i damage something if i make a wrong decision or are the choices harmless?
2008-01-01T00:27:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Abyssal	how old a monitor is it?
2008-01-01T00:30:00.000Z	Abyssal	WorkingOnWise	it is about 2,5 years old.
2008-01-01T00:32:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Abyssal	if u cant find out for sure, 60 is a standard refresh for vga, so almost all monitors will at least tolerate it.
