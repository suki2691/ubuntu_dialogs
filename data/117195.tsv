2007-10-11T13:04:00.000Z	waffle		ok, i want to install a game(specifically ut2004) but i can't figure out how to install it from the .sh file. Any help would be very nice and appreciated..:)

2007-10-11T13:06:00.000Z	waffle	tonyyarusso	Yes i bought the game on cd
2007-10-11T13:08:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	waffle	Okay.  Then you will need to make the script executable ('chmod +x /path/to/file'), then run it '/path/to/file', or if in the current directory, './file')
