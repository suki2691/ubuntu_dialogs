2008-06-19T02:10:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Smokalotapotamus	once a package is installed, its files go to various places
2008-06-19T02:10:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Smokalotapotamus	the actual executable parts are usually in /usr/bin
2008-06-19T02:11:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Smokalotapotamus	other parts are often in /usr/lib or /usr/share or /etc
