2010-11-20T14:38:00.000Z	adac		I have installled ubuntu on a usb stick. Now on most of the pcs i can start the OS witouht problem, actually it works quite faboulous. Unfortunately on my notebook I have a big big problem. Wehn i logged into Gnome then certain keyboard keys are wrong (ie "l" shows "3" and so on) Any ideas how to solve this issue? I already tried to set the keyboard layout but no luck. it just stays the same.
