2007-04-03T06:17:00.000Z	Jim1804		Ubuto...here it comes....my Ubuntu internet isn't working yet, so I'm downloading debs on my windows laptop...I downloaded and installed the w32codecs deb, it says it installed correctly, but Rhythmbox still says that the plugins aren't available for mp3 or wma..any thoughts?
