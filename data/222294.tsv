2006-06-02T14:43:00.000Z	intelikey	rspoonz	you shouldn't
2006-06-02T14:45:00.000Z	intelikey	rspoonz	you should try not only fbsd and ub but also slack mdk suse fc  and any other *nix you run across that interests you.  then you can deside what you like.
2006-06-02T14:46:00.000Z	intelikey	rspoonz	after you have tried those and learn a little about linux try gentoo and debian (two of the older heavy hitters of the linux realm)
