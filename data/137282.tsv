2007-04-22T05:35:00.000Z	atlantia		ok i am getting miffed. Is there a "how to unscrew-up and remove nvidia-drivers-issues-caused by once previously recommended scripts (envy) and use the new method which may not work???
2007-04-22T05:35:00.000Z	atlantia		cause right now, i have been back and forth between envy and this new great rstricted modules interface, and neither works now
