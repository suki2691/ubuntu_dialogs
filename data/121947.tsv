2007-10-11T15:43:00.000Z	musashi		i recently installed ubuntu, but i dont have access to root stuff. i didnt assign a root pass though
2007-10-11T15:44:00.000Z	musashi		so what is the pass x.x
2007-10-11T15:44:00.000Z	heartsblood	musashi	use sudo -I if you want a root console, if you just want to login as su go to settings/accounts and set the root password.  Although I have a feeling i'm going to get flamed for recomending that.
