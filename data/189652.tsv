2009-12-08T12:13:00.000Z	BlueX12		I've noticed firefox and other apps are ugly and gray, how to help their appearance?
2009-12-08T12:14:00.000Z	Ademan	BlueX12	system->preferences->appearance
2009-12-08T12:14:00.000Z	Ademan	BlueX12	you need a theme engine to run certain themes, are they murrine? or aurora themes?
2009-12-08T12:17:00.000Z	Ademan	BlueX12	themes are only for one component of the GUI, you can change the background yourself (in system->preferences->appearance)
