2012-04-18T07:28:00.000Z	theseb	UbuntuBoy	what do you mean "free non open source"
2012-04-18T07:30:00.000Z	theseb	UbuntuBoy	it is hard to get anyone to care about your software...you're better off releasing source code and praying anyone cares enough to pay attention to it
2012-04-18T07:31:00.000Z	theseb	UbuntuBoy	the truth is the internet has a mountain of free open source stuff....why is your pet project going to make anyone take notice?
