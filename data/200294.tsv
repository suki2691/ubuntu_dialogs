2006-01-21T11:45:00.000Z	SpaceBass		I'm thinking about using a live CD and USB key as a means to having a more "personal" computer when I travel with my company laptop
2006-01-21T11:45:00.000Z	SpaceBass		do I need to change anything in the image before burning it to redirect my home dir to a usb key?
