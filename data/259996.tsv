2004-12-06T16:15:00.000Z	thully		Does anybody know what's wrong with flash in Ubuntu hoary?  I can't hear any sound in flash animations currently - while I hear system sounds just fine.
2004-12-06T16:15:00.000Z	Matt|	thully	flash in hoary is rather dodgy
2004-12-06T16:16:00.000Z	Matt|	thully	its not the flash deb i don't think. Although I haven't heard of the sound problem before.
2004-12-06T16:16:00.000Z	Matt|	thully	the problem is essentially that they can't debug it because it is closed source
