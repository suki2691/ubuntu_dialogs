Also I have a pci-e card (nvidia 7600 gs) I would pop in if it is better than integrated video that comes with pc.  I would like to spend under 400 dollars canadian......please check out local retailer and tell me what system catches your eye in my price range at http://www.canadacomputers.com/computers/
