2006-12-24T16:11:00.000Z	ailean		can anyone help me? I want to make a straight copy of a DVD which has copy protection on it. I own the copyright to this, so you are not helping me pirate something. my dad copied a VHS to a DVD for me and put protection on it by accident and I need to make copies as Christmas presents :(
