2006-04-28T10:14:00.000Z	Draconicus		Can't anyone help me with my nvidia driver problem?!
2006-04-28T10:16:00.000Z	Draconicus		I'm trying to use the nvidia-legacy drivers with my GeForce 2, and I'm getting "Failed to load the NVIDIA kernel module!" from X, even though lsmod shows that the NVidia module IS loaded. I have everything needed according to the wiki. What gives?
2006-04-28T10:16:00.000Z	Managu	Draconicus	I haven't seen this wiki entry; but the name "nvidia-legacy" sets off alarm bells with me
