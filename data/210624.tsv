2005-10-28T10:48:00.000Z	jason0_		Trying to get my wifi pcmcia card to work. Its a Hawking card (with texas instrumunts chipset). I followed the howto's using niswrapper and got the link light to turn on. I just can't get it to connect to the internet.

2005-10-28T10:49:00.000Z	durt	jason0_	now just use the gnome network administration tool and it should work
