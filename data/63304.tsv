2009-03-17T04:30:00.000Z	jrib1	Akkernight	subversion?
2009-03-17T04:31:00.000Z	jrib1	Akkernight	meh, I meant subversion itself in a shell.  There's rapidsvn.  Do « apt-cache search subversion »
2009-03-17T04:32:00.000Z	jrib1	Akkernight	there are also a collection of nautilus scripts for svn in the repositories
