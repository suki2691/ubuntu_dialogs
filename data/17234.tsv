2011-04-07T20:34:00.000Z	Psycho_Mario		is it possible to install gnome-panel on a commandline install system without nautilus and the whole rest of gnome?
2011-04-07T20:35:00.000Z	Polah	Psycho_Mario	I imagine you'd have to install Xorg and suchlike as well and the backend GNOME stuff for the panels as well

2011-04-07T20:36:00.000Z	Psycho_Mario	Polah	xorg is fine, and backend gnome stuff is fine too. but i dont want metacity/nautilus etc considering i dont want to use them
