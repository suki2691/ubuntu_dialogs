2012-11-16T12:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	DaemonicApathy	What filesystem does it use?
2012-11-16T12:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	DaemonicApathy	Then you can use "e4defrag", but note that 1: ext4 filesystems rarely fragment enough for defrag to be worth the time 2: Fragmentation matters much less on SSDs than on spinning disks (though it does still matter some, for different reasons)
2012-11-16T12:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	DaemonicApathy	You're welcome.
