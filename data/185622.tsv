2006-05-27T08:06:00.000Z	biovore	james_xxx	you probably not going to find any g cards that work nativly under linux because they all need a close source filmware to be loaded on the chipset to get them to work.
2006-05-27T08:08:00.000Z	james_xxx	biovore	do  you think that could ever change?
2006-05-27T08:09:00.000Z	james_xxx	biovore	or are linux users permanently stuck with slow wireless?
