2010-04-21T19:09:00.000Z	mgj		I was trying to help a friend over the phone the other day. He wanted to make a backup of his ntfs drive. He got it mounted, he could copy files from it - awesome. However, he got "permission denied" when trying to copy any files from the "Documents and Settings" folder. This seems very, very strange to me, anyone have any ideas? And btw, sudo did not solve it
