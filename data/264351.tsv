2004-11-28T14:36:00.000Z	rainydaymusic1		when i send an email locally from myself to myself it gets put in the proper place, but when i use fetchmail it puts it in the default folder rather than the onei have declared in the config files, any idea?
2004-11-28T14:37:00.000Z	topyli	rainydaymusic1	what's the "proper place"?
2004-11-28T14:40:00.000Z	topyli	rainydaymusic1	i'd say it's procmail's fault
