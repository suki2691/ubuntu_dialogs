2009-06-24T13:33:00.000Z	adib		Hello, I have a problem with pidgin. When trying to connect to my yahoo messenger account, I get the "Could not connect to server. Connection refused." message. I tried setting the direct ip instead of scs.msg.yahoo.com, but the same result. Any Ideas? Oh, and it worked fine last night.

2009-06-24T13:35:00.000Z	adib		still refuses, but if it;s a general problem, then i'll wait
2009-06-24T13:35:00.000Z	ziroday	adib	its a general yahoo issue, #pidgin might be able to help better
