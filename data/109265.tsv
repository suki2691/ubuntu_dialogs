2009-03-21T11:04:00.000Z	bullgard4	neptunepink	I believe that the message " Clocksource tsc unstable (delta = 507264222 ns)" is not a sufficient reason to state: " My computer loses 3 seconds every second". My advice: First find out the reason for the message: "Clocksource tsc unstable (delta = 507264222 ns)" My guess: the reason might be a wrong ACPI.
