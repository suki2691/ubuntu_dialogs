2007-10-30T04:47:00.000Z	Q_Continuum_		Any tips for getting Gutsy to work with dual monitors using the Free drivers, on an ATI Radeon 9600? (Attempting without Non-Free drivers, can use Non-Free if needed)
2007-10-30T04:47:00.000Z	unstable	Q_Continuum_	I'm having the same problem, with Radeon 9100
2007-10-30T04:48:00.000Z	unstable	Q_Continuum_	no idea, dual monitors isn't well supported under Gutsy
2007-10-30T04:48:00.000Z	Q_Continuum_	unstable	but the new GUI for video shows it as an option, and everything I'd read pre-release was that it was made "easy" with the new GUI.
