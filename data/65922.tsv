2009-12-11T16:53:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	amgarching	maybe its 0 instead of 1 ?
2009-12-11T16:54:00.000Z	amgarching	psycho_oreos	C-a 0 switches to window 0, i dont get waht you mean.
2009-12-11T16:55:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	amgarching	dunno I was guessing, on some program setups like irssi, Alt+0 I recall would switch to window 10
