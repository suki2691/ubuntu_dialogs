2010-10-17T01:43:00.000Z	jazzybee		I am getting rid of Windows and switching to Ubuntu on my Dell Vostro. It uses Broadcom drivers.
2010-10-17T01:44:00.000Z	jazzybee		When i boot from liveCD, it prompts me to install additional drivers..but the installed OS doesn not. The PC sees no networks :(
2010-10-17T01:45:00.000Z	jazzybee		I tried https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx but didn't work. Nothing appears in System->Admin->Hardware
