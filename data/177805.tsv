2008-01-10T22:52:00.000Z	FernandoLujan		can someone please help me? I have a problem with ubuntu. Whenever I try to download a new package from synaptic it gives me this error. Same when I use the update manager. sudo apt-get install -f
2008-01-10T22:52:00.000Z	FernandoLujan		that last part was meant to say "sudo apt-get install -f" didn't work
