2007-05-14T11:37:00.000Z	jrr		where can i easily see what port gnome VNC uses? netstat shows multiple connections.
2007-05-14T11:38:00.000Z	jrr		what game are you dealing with?
2007-05-14T11:38:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	jrr	VNC generally uses 5800 and 5900 (for HTTP) i think
2007-05-14T11:38:00.000Z	jrr	IntuitiveNipple	one of the connections is indeed 5900. thanks.
