2007-03-03T12:33:00.000Z	Mythmon		ive got a question, if i were to put a secondary harddrive in a windows box could i dual boot ubuntu, and have ubuntu on the second drive, without messing with the windows install?
2007-03-03T12:34:00.000Z	mackinac	Mythmon	  yes, thats what i do
2007-03-03T12:34:00.000Z	mackinac	Mythmon	  they can be on the same drive too
2007-03-03T12:36:00.000Z	mackinac	Mythmon	  anyhow, I prefer the 2nd drive option myself :)
