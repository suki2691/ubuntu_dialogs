2009-05-16T01:22:00.000Z	xiong		noob question -- still having trouble with this -- where do i put applications (that is, those that are not automatically installed by synaptic)? -- /lib? /bin?
2009-05-16T01:24:00.000Z	Guest59229	xiong	you can store the probram anywhere but make a link to it and name it the command you want to use to get to it then put it in the bin folder
2009-05-16T01:24:00.000Z	xiong		i downloaded the client for second life; it wound up on the desktop ('my' desktop?) which is messy and imo, stupid
2009-05-16T01:25:00.000Z	xiong	Guest59229	sorry but 'anywhere' is not, i think, a real good answer -- it seems to me that everything is 'supposed' to be somewhere -- i don't want to do anything too creative
