2008-01-22T09:53:00.000Z	dehspehl	Onyx	that gives you enough to build for instance a kernel, but you will probably need to get -dev packages if there are dependencies
2008-01-22T09:54:00.000Z	Onyx	dehspehl	Ahh okay -- I know I have that installed on my system, just didn't know what it was called (I come from OpenBSD and Slackware mindset...) -- I built my custom kernel immediately after install, heh.
2008-01-22T10:05:00.000Z	Onyx	dehspehl	Yeah, my thoughts as well.
