2012-11-21T21:54:00.000Z	JBzh		Hi. I would like to use the DSA key I generated with putty-keygen on Windows, but yet I can't.
2012-11-21T21:55:00.000Z	JBzh		I can use this key with putty in Ubuntu but not with just ssh in bash
2012-11-21T21:55:00.000Z	Pici	JBzh	If you open the key file with puttygen in windows, you can export it as a regular keyfile
2012-11-21T21:57:00.000Z	JBzh	Pici	yes, that's what I did, exported it to a "id_dsa" file, then back to Ubuntu copied it into ~/.ssh/
