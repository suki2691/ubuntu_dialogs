2010-03-03T16:27:00.000Z	m_anish	iceroot	Thanks!
2010-03-03T16:32:00.000Z	m_anish	iceroot	Sorry for bugging you again but, apparently there is an option to lauch gdm in debug mode where it can log information (http://library.gnome.org/admin/gdm/2.28/gdm.html#logging) ... Would that contain application history?
