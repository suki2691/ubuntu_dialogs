2007-07-08T16:02:00.000Z	Zasch		I have a situation. On a fresh Ubuntu install, the first account I create I can never log into: It hangs. First it'll hang because of the wireless card, but when I install the firmware for it, it hangs for no reason. A white box will appear in the top left corner. I can log into a second account created in the terminal, but it has no sound. What is going on?
