2008-02-03T20:28:00.000Z	LjL	sixstorm	not really, i've seen a few people here using 6.06. it's a pretty stable release - not bleeding edge but if it works well on one's hardware and one doesn't need bleeding edge...
2008-02-03T20:28:00.000Z	sixstorm	LjL	 true that.  i just figured most people would take advantage of the new features of some of the newer releases
