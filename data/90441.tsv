2008-05-16T02:04:00.000Z	dinosaur		I installed Xubuntu 7.10 on a friend's dinosaur laptop.... he accidently selected the 8.?? LTS distribution upgrade... now his computer is running drastically slower (he can't handle the newer version)... how can I DOWNGRADE back to 7.10 distribution?
2008-05-16T02:05:00.000Z	kitche	dinosaur	reinstall is the only real way
2008-05-16T02:06:00.000Z	dinosaur	kitche	: I was hoping you wouldn't say that... how positive are you on the inability to downgrade after a distribution upgrade?
2008-05-16T02:06:00.000Z	kitche	dinosaur	umm it's not recommended since it will break
