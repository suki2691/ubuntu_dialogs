2009-06-25T01:04:00.000Z	FoolishOwl		I'm thinking about getting another hard drive, with partitions for Fedora, freeBSD, and maybe Windows XP.

2009-06-25T01:06:00.000Z	Stanley_	FoolishOwl	I may be alone on this but I much rather have seperate hard drives for each OS and set which drive to boot to in the BIOS, that way you never have to mess with boot managers
