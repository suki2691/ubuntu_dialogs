2007-10-20T20:32:00.000Z	Puppy_		I have an old computer that has 7.04 on it. The people that are are using it would not care what version it has on it. I just want to know if I don't upgrade does that make me more at risk to viruses and stuff?
2007-10-20T20:32:00.000Z	astro76	Puppy_	no each version is supported for 18 months with security updates
2007-10-20T20:33:00.000Z	astro76	Puppy_	you won't be able to use the repo's any more eventually, no security updates
2007-10-20T20:33:00.000Z	astro76	Puppy_	if this is a real concern, the LTS releases are supported for 3 years (6.06 and 8.04 are LTS)
