2007-09-23T12:38:00.000Z	Xera		I have an ATI 9250, which driver do I need/how do I set it up if I plan on using compiz-fusion? I've been told to use the Restricted Drivers Manager but it tells me I don't need one..

2007-09-23T12:40:00.000Z	Xera	Jordan_U	Before fiddling with fglrx I had direct rendering but desktop effects didn't work
2007-09-23T12:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Xera	Try #ubuntu-effects
