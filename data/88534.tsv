2009-01-05T23:24:00.000Z	ASULutzy	omnydevi	remove just removes the program, purge removes the program and its config files I believe

2009-01-06T03:02:00.000Z	ASULutzy	omnydevi	Well, you didn't really give bad info... There isn't really a simple or normal way to create a RAID1 without destroying the partitions of both disks... This way works, but what you're basically doing is tricking mdadm into rebuilding a broken array
