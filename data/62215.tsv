2009-07-09T20:52:00.000Z	Flats		I can't seem to find the right combination of search terms to find how I can see my ubuntu disk from windows. I have a winXP box upstairs and an ubuntu downstairs. I want to be able to see files on ubuntu from my windows box
2009-07-09T20:52:00.000Z	Flats		Hope that made sense
2009-07-09T20:53:00.000Z	iceroot	Flats	use samba or sftp
2009-09-23T01:45:00.000Z	iceroot	Flats	sudo apt-get install openssh-server?
