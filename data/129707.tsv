2008-03-08T05:42:00.000Z	Echoside		Hello everyone. I'm having a bit of a problem with my xorg.conf. Every time I logout or reboot the computer the settings get messed up.
2008-03-08T05:44:00.000Z	bluefox83	Echoside	what are you using to edit the settings?
2008-03-08T05:59:00.000Z	Echoside	bluefox83	Sorry it took so long to respond. I'm just useing dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-03-08T06:01:00.000Z	Echoside	bluefox83	The system finds my card and everything just fine. And when i restart X, all the settings work. But I restart and I lose resolution sizes.
