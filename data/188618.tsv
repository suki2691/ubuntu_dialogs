2006-05-04T16:54:00.000Z	Rorviker		My ubuntu server needs to get internet via a windows machine, they are direct connected with a crossed tp. Windows have enabled internet sharing and I was told that the linux machine should automatically detect the internet and settings but it dont. What can I do to get the internet working ?
