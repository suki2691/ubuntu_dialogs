2011-04-29T13:24:00.000Z	Sik		So, I just updated to 11.04 through the updater, and was forced to go into safe mode since apparently Unity crashes on this hardware (video doesn't respond, sometimes system won't boot at all)... besides I don't like it anyways. Is there any way to set Ubuntu to always start with the old shell?
2011-04-29T13:26:00.000Z	ror	Sik	In Administration > Login Screen, there's a choice for "Default"
2011-04-29T13:39:00.000Z	ror	Sik	first time I had to boot to an older kernel, then dpkg --configure
2011-04-29T13:40:00.000Z	Sik	ror	OK, will do that, though later as right now I need to get something off internet >_>
