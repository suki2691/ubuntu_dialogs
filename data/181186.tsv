2006-12-30T11:53:00.000Z	bruenig	jorgp	there was some thread that showed how to do it if you had an already existing linux distro, it looked  pretty hard, it is on ubuntuforums.org
2006-12-30T11:54:00.000Z	jorgp	bruenig	I see this http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=316093, but it still requires a boot
2006-12-30T11:55:00.000Z	bruenig	jorgp	yeah that is the one I saw, I didn't really look into because burning a cd is nothing so yeah just did it
