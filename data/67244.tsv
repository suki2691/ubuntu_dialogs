2009-02-01T03:07:00.000Z	Jay2		I'm trying to install MPLAYER, get this message: This application conflicts with other installed software. To install 'mplayer' the conflicting software must be removed first. How do I figure out what the conflict is
2009-02-01T03:08:00.000Z	rakudave	Jay2	run synaptic in stead of add/remove
2009-02-01T03:11:00.000Z	Jay2	rakudave	what do I look for in the synaptic package manager? can't directly install mplayer from there
2009-02-01T03:13:00.000Z	rakudave	Jay2	try using the "search" function... otherwise you might add the medibuntu-repos (medibuntu.org)
