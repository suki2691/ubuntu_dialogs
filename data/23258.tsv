2012-04-11T11:58:00.000Z	Zenger		besiedes why bother use notepad++ when it's built on Scite engine and I could use native Scite
2012-04-11T11:58:00.000Z	scientes	Zenger	in general stick to native GNU/Linux apps
2012-04-11T12:00:00.000Z	Zenger	scientes	I think it's better to use native gnu/gpl software :)
