2008-09-25T01:07:00.000Z	TidusBlade		Sorry guys for the noob question, but how can I figure out what file is being accessed by other computers over LAN? Someone on my LAN has been downloading from me at 11MB/s for the past 20 minutes, no idea what's happening...
2008-09-25T01:08:00.000Z	nucco	TidusBlade	just use a firewall
2008-09-25T01:08:00.000Z	nucco	TidusBlade	sudo apt-get install firestarter
2008-09-25T01:09:00.000Z	nucco	TidusBlade	possibly they're accessing your shared folders... R_YoYo_R: wireshark for a newbie?!!!
