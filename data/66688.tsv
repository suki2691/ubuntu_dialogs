2009-03-02T03:25:00.000Z	silidan		Hi, here is my Problem:  the "1" key doesnt work (the one below esc), but shift+"1" does work, im 100% shure it is ubuntu thing, cause on other pc and on this pc on win it works normal, any ideas?
2009-03-02T03:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	silidan	 go to the console and see if it works there..
2009-03-02T03:27:00.000Z	silidan	Dr_willis	it works in console but not in terminal
2009-03-02T03:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	silidan	 could be your keymap/keyboard local is wrong..
