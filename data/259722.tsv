2005-05-14T09:23:00.000Z	zooko		Greetings, people of #ubuntu!  Is there a kernel 2.6.11 source newer/better than the one in hoary universe?
2005-05-14T09:24:00.000Z	zooko		I upgraded from 2.6.10 (from hoary main) to 2.6.11 (from hoary universe) and found that my new SATA drive broke, and noticed
2005-05-14T09:24:00.000Z	zooko		that 2.6.11 from universe has sata_via 1.0 where 2.6.10 from main has sata_via 1.1...
2005-05-14T09:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	zooko	don't even think about using 2.6.11 - it's broken
