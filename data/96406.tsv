2008-06-07T22:02:00.000Z	Shak-		is there a way to get gnome to auto align icons without having to do 'clean up by name' and messing up the existing order each time?
2008-06-07T22:03:00.000Z	MightyTweek	Shak-	just check the box on that menu that says "keep aligned"
2008-06-07T22:03:00.000Z	Shak-	MightyTweek	its checked, but if I delete an icon somewhere theres a gap between the adjacent icons
2008-06-07T22:04:00.000Z	MightyTweek	Shak-	ah sorry, I understand now... I don't think there's a way to do that
