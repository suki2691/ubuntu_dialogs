2007-03-03T12:09:00.000Z	Funcod		im asking it again
2007-03-03T12:09:00.000Z	Funcod		i have a question : why should i use ubuntu over pc-bsd?
2007-03-03T12:09:00.000Z	rbil	Funcod	because distros that start with a "u" sound nicer than ones that start with a "p"
2007-03-03T12:11:00.000Z	rbil	Funcod	people here run Ubuntu. I've never run pc-bsd, and you want a comparision?
