2009-07-20T18:57:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_		when booting up a new 9.04 server installation for the first time, one item in the boot sequence fails - setting up network hardware; and ifconfig returns nothing. what's going on?
2009-07-20T18:57:00.000Z	mazda01	StrangeCharm_	what chipset is your network card?
2009-07-20T18:58:00.000Z	StrangeCharm_	mazda01	that is a very good question to which i do not know the answer. howerver, 9.04  has worked on this rig before (with no hw changes)
2009-07-20T18:59:00.000Z	mazda01	StrangeCharm_	huh? then i am not sure if that same hardware has worked in the past. have you tried a live cd and see if you can access the internet?
