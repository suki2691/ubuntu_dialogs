2007-08-09T10:54:00.000Z	TheCreationist		How do I figure out if other people are currently logged in on my system and how do I log them out?
2007-08-09T10:55:00.000Z	MasterShrek	TheCreationist	type    who    will list users
2007-08-09T10:55:00.000Z	MasterShrek		jonathaN, add an entry to your /etc/fstab for it
2007-08-09T10:55:00.000Z	TheCreationist	MasterShrek	Hmm... that doesn't help.  I'm the only one listed, but my system is running very slowly (as if someone else were logged in too)
