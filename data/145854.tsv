2007-02-14T10:42:00.000Z	pumpkinhea1	tanascar	i'm working on this too. here's a page i'm looking at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkDevices
2007-02-14T10:44:00.000Z	tanascar	pumpkinhea1	My installation got messed up and I need to have ubuntu reinstall my card again.. I don't know where the config file is or how to set it up.
2007-02-14T10:45:00.000Z	pumpkinhea1	tanascar	this is the only thing that is working for me right now: running /etc/init.d/networking restart in a root terminal manually after startup. you can try it.
