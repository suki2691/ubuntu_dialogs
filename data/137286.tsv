2007-04-26T14:27:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	shrimants	what you don't be able to do of course is boot from the external drive (at least WIN XP won't... it protests and refuses to do so)
2007-04-26T14:30:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	shrimants	I wish I could be of more assistance, but I've not used any Windows myself for a while now and I'm so used to doing things the linux way such as with dd; does the documentation (if any) that comes with HDCopy tell you what it does?
