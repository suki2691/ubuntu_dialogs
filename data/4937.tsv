2012-05-19T22:01:00.000Z	lanceio		I just deleted unity and all of gnome, how do I get compiz? when I install compiz, it says its alredy the latest version
2012-05-19T22:02:00.000Z	lanceio		I did that too, but im on fluxbox now and how do I access compiz using gdm?
2012-05-19T22:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lanceio	compiz is a WM, as is fluxbox
2012-05-19T22:04:00.000Z	lanceio	ActionParsnip	exactly: which is why I wanna go into compiz to remove fluxbox
