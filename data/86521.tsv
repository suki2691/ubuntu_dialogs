2009-02-05T08:19:00.000Z	ZiRiS		Ahem. I've, ah, got a newbie question. I need to edit a text file, but don't have permissions. So how do I do that form a command line?
2009-02-05T08:19:00.000Z	ZiRiS		I know I can use sudo, but, what else do I need?
2009-02-05T08:19:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	ZiRiS	sudo nano -w <file_name>
2009-02-05T08:20:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	ZiRiS	the -w is my annoyance with nano, you don't have to particularly use it
