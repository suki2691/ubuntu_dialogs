2007-09-09T15:07:00.000Z	shock		hi .... has any one here tried installing Ubuntu on an raid 0 configured alienware ??
2007-09-09T15:07:00.000Z	Pelo	shock	 I thnk that's what you need
2007-09-09T15:09:00.000Z	Pelo	shock	 you can install on a second partiton,  if you select  manual partitioning when yo get to that step you can probably ( I've never done it in raid) specify new partitions for /home /swap /home
2007-09-09T15:10:00.000Z	Pelo	shock	except for the raid part (which I donT' know about) you can rezise the nfts partition to make a new partition to install ubuntu on
