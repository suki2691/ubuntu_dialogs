2006-12-04T12:51:00.000Z	Nutubuntu		I want to convert a .sit file. Have installed mactools but I can't find a way to start "unsit". I feel stupid asking something so simple, but I'm willing to feel stupid for a moment or two if it fixes the problem :)
2006-12-04T12:53:00.000Z	IdleOne	Nutubuntu	you should be able to right click and extract
2006-12-04T12:54:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	IdleOne	- fileroller tells me that the archive type ".sit" is not supported
2007-06-26T08:28:00.000Z	IdleOne	Nutubuntu	you need to register to be able to send priv msg
