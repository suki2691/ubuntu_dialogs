2010-11-12T05:19:00.000Z	detrix42		Hello everyone.  Is there a program for linux/ubuntu that is similar to printshop.  for like printing business cards using Avery's templates????
2010-11-12T05:19:00.000Z	jrib	detrix42	can't you just use openoffice?
2010-11-12T05:20:00.000Z	detrix42	jrib	perhaps but I don't like how open office does it.
2010-11-12T05:20:00.000Z	detrix42	jrib	I will double check though...
