2004-12-03T08:01:00.000Z	YokoZar		Ok, here's the deal: All my packages are latest hoary version, but when it boots into login menu I get a frozen keyboard and a grey screen.  The login screen sound plays, but then everything locks up.  Anyone have a clue?  Am I missing a package?  What should I try doing?

2004-12-03T08:03:00.000Z	YokoZar	JStrike	Safe way to downgrade?
2004-12-03T08:04:00.000Z	JStrike	YokoZar	: Not sure
