2006-10-09T12:22:00.000Z	echobinary		anyone have any ideas on running a headless Dapper box and VNC'ing in with a decent screen resolution? Booting remotely gives me 800x600 (or 640x480) - would like to get at least 1024x768 if not greater
2006-10-09T12:22:00.000Z	chuckyp	echobinary	well the screen resloution shouldn't be an issue
2006-10-09T12:23:00.000Z	chuckyp	echobinary	well change x's res to higher
