2012-01-13T21:02:00.000Z	UniTe		The python script i am trying to run is running really slow, if there command i can use to speed it up and use asmuch RAM or CPU as possible?
2012-01-13T21:03:00.000Z	auronandace	UniTe	perhaps #python would be a better place to ask
2012-01-13T21:04:00.000Z	UniTe	auronandace	nah i mean a command in ubuntu terminal to run the script itself
2012-01-13T21:04:00.000Z	auronandace	UniTe	sounds like a badly written script to me, hence i referred you to #python
