2010-05-05T02:14:00.000Z	joelwood		totally new to linux, need some help
2010-05-05T02:16:00.000Z	joelwood		is there a package like vhs to dvd software?
2010-05-05T02:17:00.000Z	GeekSquid	joelwood	it is called encoding... vhs is a tape, you'd need an encoder card to go from tape to a digital file, then output to dvd
