2010-03-20T13:44:00.000Z	Amadiro		Good evening. There is some package in the ubuntu repo, which seems slightly out-of-date, and a newer version of the software with security updates was released. Is there some way I can help/notify the downstream devs, for instance by flagging the package out-of-date?
2010-03-20T13:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	Amadiro	 theres teh backports and other  repositories that may have the updates.
2010-03-20T13:45:00.000Z	Amadiro	Dr_Willis_	thanks, I will look into it.
2010-03-20T13:49:00.000Z	Amadiro	Dr_Willis_	I did find one in the backports, which is newer than the version currently in the repository, but that one is still too old to have the security update.
