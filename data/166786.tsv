2008-01-26T15:54:00.000Z	Jakoo		Hello I need to know what's the command to remove a folder from usr
2008-01-26T15:55:00.000Z	compwiz18	Jakoo	be careful deleting stuff in /usr : sudo rm /usr/name-of-folder
2008-01-26T15:55:00.000Z	compwiz18	Jakoo	sorry, rm -r /usr/name-of-folder
2008-01-26T16:03:00.000Z	compwiz18	Jakoo	correct, and -r removes recursively
