2011-02-16T01:40:00.000Z	djoef		Hi, I want to learn how to make & manage my own repository for my projects at work using subversion, should I install the terminal version of svn and simply work with that, or do you recommend a GUI ? (and which one ?)
2011-02-16T01:40:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	djoef	whatever you prefer really
2011-02-16T01:41:00.000Z	djoef	aeon-ltd	If I would prefer a GUI, which one would you suggest ? (And is it better to work with terminal version first, to get the real idea of committing etc  ?)
2011-02-16T01:42:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	djoef	can't really reccommend a gui, but in general i prefer command line as its much more 'direct' plus it allows you to work in other environments where a gui is not available
