2008-01-05T08:51:00.000Z	jbw4		guys, I'm trying to decide between Ubuntu Gusty and Debian Etch for a server...which would be recommended?
2008-01-05T08:53:00.000Z	jbw4		so, I guess my real question...can you use debootstrap on Gutsy to create a Debian Etch file system?
2008-01-05T08:55:00.000Z	jbw4		does anyone know if I can create a Debian Etch image with debootstrap on Gutsy
