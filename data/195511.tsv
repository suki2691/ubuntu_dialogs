2009-03-04T08:38:00.000Z	MagicDuck		hi, I need to install the nvidia 173.14.16 from jaunty (it contains a fix that makes KDE4 work better from what I hear). How would I go about that. I am currently running interpid.
2009-03-04T08:39:00.000Z	kitche	MagicDuck	have to install the driver by hand use envy-ng if you must
2009-03-04T08:40:00.000Z	kitche	MagicDuck	then go to the nvidia site download the driver and compile with the kernel header sources
2009-03-04T08:41:00.000Z	kitche	MagicDuck	different kernel versions
