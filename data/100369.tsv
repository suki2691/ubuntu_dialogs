2008-02-19T09:21:00.000Z	norty		 I have a question that isn't ubuntu related but thought someone here might know, i want to define a function such as f(x) = x^2 and then find its derivative, how do i define functions in matlab, without using a .m file ?
2008-02-19T09:22:00.000Z	__Oz__	norty	try #matlab
2008-02-19T09:23:00.000Z	norty	__Oz__	I am in #matlab, just thought id ask here just in case someone might know
2008-02-19T09:23:00.000Z	__Oz__	norty	nah, we all hate that application in here.
