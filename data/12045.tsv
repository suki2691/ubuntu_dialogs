2011-12-20T09:30:00.000Z	imMute	e_t_	crap.  isn't the .deb package just a tarball/zipfile of some sort?  if I could just get the binaries out of them...
2011-12-20T09:32:00.000Z	e_t_	imMute	a DEB package is pretty much a tarball, except they use the AR format which has really poor compression. However it's also a matter of what libraries the software is linked against internally. Like I said though, you should be able to build and install the software you want to your user account, if the build tools are available.
2011-12-20T09:36:00.000Z	imMute	e_t_	the build tools are definitely available. I think it's just a really old ubuntu installation.  I'll have to try again tomorrow
