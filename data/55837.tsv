2009-06-14T15:02:00.000Z	znh		I've been running Jaunty for a few days now and the overall performance is terrible. I migrated to Xubuntu-desktop and experiencing barely difference. For example Firefox uses 100MB Memory when only downloading a file (other windows are closed). Is this a bug that Jaunty is this slow.. or?
