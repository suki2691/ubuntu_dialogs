I just setup a new computer running a RAID5 with 3 drives, BIOS knows it's a raid and "Intel Matrix Manager" says the 3 drives are all configured as part of the raid, but when I use the installer to begin partitioning the raid it's showing me sda sdb and sdc (all at 0,0,0). Is there something I'm doing wrong?
