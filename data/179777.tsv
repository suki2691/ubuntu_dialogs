2007-12-02T19:52:00.000Z	Brazilian		is there a way to boot ubuntu 7.10 in text mode?
2007-12-02T19:52:00.000Z	jrib	Brazilian	for what purpose?
2007-12-02T19:54:00.000Z	Brazilian	jrib	it's not starting here in my laptop. starts booting and then hangs before actually starting the x. i would like to fix that, or at least find out what the problem is
