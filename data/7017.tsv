2011-12-18T03:45:00.000Z	Douro		Hi, is vgaswitcheroo by default in Ubuntu or would I need to compile my own kernel?
2011-12-18T03:46:00.000Z	soreau	Douro	It should be available without having to build anything
2011-12-18T03:48:00.000Z	Douro	soreau	escott, can you run ls -l /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch for me? I need to be sure.
