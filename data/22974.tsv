2011-05-12T05:24:00.000Z	walter		i think if ubuntu gets software compatibility like those of a mac it will own pwn windows in no time
2011-05-12T05:26:00.000Z	walter		guys need some help here.. ubuntu tells me to upgrade bios or use forced something( i cant recall) what should i do?
2011-05-12T05:26:00.000Z	FreezingCold	walter	Force.  Flashing BIOSes is more risky
2011-05-12T05:27:00.000Z	walter	FreezingCold	how do i do that?
