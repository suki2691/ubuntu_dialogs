2007-11-14T20:16:00.000Z	gibobo		i have a newly bought athlon 64 x2 and i installed ubuntu 7.10 64 version but iti seems like it full of glitches and my video card (NVIDIA) didn't had any problem in my older computer to run compiz. Should i install the normal version of ubuntu
2007-11-14T20:18:00.000Z	mosibfu	gibobo	i can say, standard ubuntu works fine on amd x2, even with SLI, havent tried the 64 bit version here yet
2007-11-14T20:20:00.000Z	gibobo	mosibfu	So it would be better to install the normal one? great thx
