2010-04-12T20:20:00.000Z	psusi	LinuxPhreak	you mean a home entertainment type dvd player?  the kind that sits on top of your tv and has nothing to do with a computer?
2010-04-12T20:21:00.000Z	LinuxPhreak	psusi	yes the one that goes to a tv
2010-04-12T20:21:00.000Z	psusi	LinuxPhreak	no such thing... they are stand alone devices that have custom firmware they run, they do not boot an os from a disc
