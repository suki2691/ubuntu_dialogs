2008-09-13T20:03:00.000Z	SquishyDO		 Adding 2618552k swap on /dev/sda5.  Priority:-1
2008-09-13T20:03:00.000Z	SquishyDO		i read somewhere that -1 = error
2008-09-13T20:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	SquishyDO	 not for Priority I think.  YOu can have several swap partitions, ones with Higher Priority get used first  - i belive
2008-09-13T20:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	SquishyDO	 unless its not an error return code at all...
