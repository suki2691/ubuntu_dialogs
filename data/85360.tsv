2010-09-08T18:21:00.000Z	inflex	stewart_	that is the behaviour you were seeking - correct?
2010-09-08T18:25:00.000Z	inflex	stewart_	the other option might be (if you can) to invoke the process using "nohup"
2010-09-08T18:25:00.000Z	inflex	stewart_	"man nohup" should give you the details you want.
2010-09-08T18:39:00.000Z	stewart_	inflex	hey thanks again for the help. I tried both nohup and invoking bash however this issue remains. Might head back to google. Thanks again for your help :)
