2010-06-01T02:05:00.000Z	Ken8521	FlamingLinux	not to attack, but why would you want to?.. apt-get is more or less the same thing
2010-06-01T02:06:00.000Z	FlamingLinux	Ken8521	just because i want to try out yum
2010-06-01T02:06:00.000Z	Ken8521	FlamingLinux	then install a redhat distro, or boot a Fedora Live CD.. it's more or less the same as apt-get
