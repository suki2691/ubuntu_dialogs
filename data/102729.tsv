2009-12-19T09:34:00.000Z	poseidon		I'm going to be getting a 3rd gen ipod touch for my 18th birthday.  From what I've read the best way to sync it would be to set up a vm with windows running itunes.
2009-12-19T09:35:00.000Z	poseidon		I've never set up a vm before.  Is virtual box the best for me to use?
2009-12-19T09:35:00.000Z	poseidon		also can I use an oem disk for a vm?
2009-12-19T09:35:00.000Z	islington	poseidon	yes an oem disk will work.
