2012-08-28T14:34:00.000Z	VastGsm		Hello Everyone, Good Morning :-) ----> (I have just done a clean FRESH install of "Ubuntu 10.04 LTS" and I get a blank screen if I run kernel 2.6.32-42, I believe this is because no Xorg.conf is created, If I run kernel 2.6.31.14 I dont get a blank screen and I can login ok as I can see the screen. I have tried Googleing a LOT and not found the solution as of yet. I am using an "Fujitsu-Siemens LifeBook s6120" laptop with an "Intel 82852/855GM intergrated grap
2012-08-28T14:35:00.000Z	VastGsm		but I just get the blank screen. Any ideas or thoughts please. I am having trouble trying to create an "Xorg.conf" file due to it does NOT exist as of yet. The only file that exists is a "Xorg.conf.failsafe" ----> How can I use this same file but save in directory "/etc/x11" as "Xorg.conf" ----> I think it is a permissions issue, can anyone help please....?? thanks
