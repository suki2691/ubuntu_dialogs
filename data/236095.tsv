2006-03-25T07:56:00.000Z	JustinMP		K: your an idiot
2006-03-25T07:57:00.000Z	JustinMP		Does anyone know why a game thats made for linux and windows runs flawlessly in windows but crappy in linux on the same graphics card (Sapphire Radeon 9600XT 256mb) - even xscreensaver runs choppy. But in windows, games like counter-strike: source ran great. So, I don't know what gives and I was wondering if anyone in here could help me.
2006-03-25T07:58:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	JustinMP	did you install ati drivers?
