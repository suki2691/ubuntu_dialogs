2009-12-25T10:06:00.000Z	alankila		I'm screwed too because I have ATI X1250 on this laptop. After a year of very poor 3d, the open-source radeonhd is better, but the screen seems to jerk downwards randomly and has always done that.

2009-12-25T10:07:00.000Z	alankila		err... was good enough
2009-12-25T10:08:00.000Z	Jamed	alankila	i had the same problem with my X1600, they just dropped the support :(
