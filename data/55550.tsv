2009-11-23T20:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Binaridragon	 You still have to run the nvidia-settings tool to configure the thing..   and yes. i did say run nvidia-settings :)
2009-11-23T20:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Binaridragon	 i do think part of the issue may also be mixxing sections from the xorg.conf  but in the past i just run nvidia-settings and have it save to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.nvidia-generated   then copied that file to xorg.conf and it worked
