2007-12-29T02:16:00.000Z	carrierBag		Hi. I am on 6.06 LTS and its php installation doesnt has the bundled Version of the GD Graphics Library... so, whats the best thing I could do? Do I really have to recompile php --with-gd? Don't I mess up the system (synapsis, packages, ...) by that? Any advice would be much appreciated.
2007-12-29T02:16:00.000Z	Myrtti	carrierBag	you've installed the modules?
2007-12-29T02:17:00.000Z	carrierBag	Myrtti	yes with apt-get (php5-gd)
2007-12-29T02:17:00.000Z	carrierBag	Myrtti	but thats not the bundled gd version for which I have to recompile php from scratch I guess... :|
