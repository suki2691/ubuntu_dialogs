Otherwise us ubuntu users have to deal with a giant dependency mess, every godamn time we want to compile a newer version of a package from source.

2011-10-20T10:36:00.000Z	nac-godfather		If I wanna run my goddamn vlc player as root, that's my right!  I don't wanna have to recompile X11 from source in order to do so...
