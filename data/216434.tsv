2010-04-23T18:00:00.000Z	jad		hey, im on ubuntu 9.10, latest updates. I have 12 ubuntu boot menus. each 2 are normal and recovery mode with 6 different linux kernels.   When I installed it there was only one. But it seems that each time I get a kernel update, it create a new boot.
2010-04-23T18:00:00.000Z	jad		Is this a default behavior ?
