Uploading a single file to the vsftp server goes fast. But if I upload many small files the transfer rates drop to a few bytes per second and then eventually times out. Any ideas why this would be? I've replicated this on 3 servers so far.

2008-07-19T10:03:00.000Z	superfirelord42_	Shinpo	but it doesnt explain hte timout though...
2008-07-19T10:03:00.000Z	superfirelord42_	Shinpo	i think that could be a bug
