2011-10-17T20:25:00.000Z	enapupe_		Hi, i need some help installing ubuntu on an empty hd
2011-10-17T20:26:00.000Z	enapupe_		I want to split the HD onto 300gb system and 700gb data, what should I choose on 'mount point'? /root, / ?
2011-10-17T20:27:00.000Z	usr13	enapupe_	What are you going to do with the 700gb partition?
2011-10-17T20:28:00.000Z	usr13	enapupe_	Basically, I would have a partition for / and another for /home and another for swap.  That is all.
