2008-12-03T02:33:00.000Z	LifesaGarden		With my amd-64, what is the likelihood of pulling off a successful upgrade to 64bit-Ibex from a i386-Heron, or would I have to shut down and reboot and install from the interface?

2008-12-03T02:35:00.000Z	LifesaGarden	Jack_Sparrow	so you say my best option is to do the reboot option.
2008-12-03T02:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LifesaGarden	upgrade from 32 to 64 bit and upgrading to a new release..  bad idea
