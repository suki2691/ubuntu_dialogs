2011-07-01T05:24:00.000Z	Sheath		how do i run my packge(directory) full of class files from command line on linux? i get ClassNotFoundException. ive tried to set CLASSPATH, ive tried to copy all the class files to the same dir that the java bin is in, not sure what i'm doing wrong and google isnt helping me either
2011-07-01T05:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Sheath	Is this a java program you wrote?
2011-07-01T05:25:00.000Z	Sheath		yes
2011-07-01T05:26:00.000Z	Sheath	Jordan_U	i wrote all of my classes in separate files then they're all apart of the same package
