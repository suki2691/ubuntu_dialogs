2008-01-27T16:19:00.000Z	Al2O3		hi, I want to change from using the default 7.10 end user installation window manager (whatever it is, GNOME with some light rusty background), to using the WindowMaker window manager I installed with 'sudo apt-get menu gnustep wmaker'.  How do I change from the standard default winodw manager to the one I have installed?
