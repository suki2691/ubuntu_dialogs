2007-10-19T17:55:00.000Z	leroutier		I'd like to know if all registered launchpad/Ubuntu users could ask for a IRC cloak on freenode servers ?
2007-10-19T17:56:00.000Z	jrib	leroutier	ubuntu members can receive an ubuntu cloak but everyone may request an unaffiliated cloak
2007-10-19T17:56:00.000Z	leroutier	jrib	thanks
