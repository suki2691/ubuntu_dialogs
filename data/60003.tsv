I'm connected using the nx client (nomachine) and when I quit nx client I lose all aplications... likle, things shutdown with no reason. on windows using remote desktop connection when I disconnect, I can login again and stay with things exacly as I left... any clue for this?

2009-04-20T01:48:00.000Z	SlAiD	Slart	yep, probably. I think it does not. any way I can install vnc server on ubuntu 8.04? you have a guide or something?
2009-04-20T01:49:00.000Z	Slart	SlAiD	that's the one I was talking about.. it uses the already running session
