2005-10-24T16:56:00.000Z	concept10	Kovecses	try this.  Get the IP address of one of the servers in Streamtuner.  Goto terminal prompt and type "streamripper xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"  (whatever IP address is)
2005-10-24T16:56:00.000Z	concept10	Kovecses	probably because live365 needs login
2005-10-24T16:57:00.000Z	Kovecses	concept10	probably
