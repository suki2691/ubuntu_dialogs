2010-01-12T11:26:00.000Z	DrManhattan		my ubuntu install doesn't recognize my ide cdrom - intel g31 chipset with an sata HD - is there a solution for this yet?
2010-01-12T11:26:00.000Z	DrManhattan		its a dual boot with win7 and win7 has no issues with the cdrom
2010-01-12T11:27:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	DrManhattan	You got more than one CDROM?
2010-01-12T11:28:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	DrManhattan	Same thing for me. I wasn't able to install it using first drive but I could make do with second drive. Weird issue, I know.
