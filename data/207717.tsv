2005-12-05T17:41:00.000Z	anavim	Ofe	it's not dependency hell, it's a package conflict.  you can't have mplayer and xine installed at the same time
2005-12-05T17:42:00.000Z	Ofe	anavim	: oh, so it's mplayer? I don't think I ever installed that. unless it comes with breezy.
2005-12-05T17:42:00.000Z	anavim	Ofe	oh, different problem then  :(
