2012-02-12T11:57:00.000Z	sixple		why am i getting this error message: You don't have the right permissions to extract archives in the folder "file:///media/GAMES/DS%20Games"
2012-02-12T11:58:00.000Z	escott	sixple	because you dont have write permissions on /media/Games/DS Games
2012-02-12T11:59:00.000Z	escott	sixple	hard to say without more details. what kind of file system is /media/GAMES
2012-02-12T12:00:00.000Z	escott	sixple	does the microsd or its adapter have a read only toggle? (its a physical switch) and is it set to rw?
