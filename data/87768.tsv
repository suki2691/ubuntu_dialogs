2008-07-07T18:24:00.000Z	Xavura	simNIX	sorry to like butt in, but you mentioned /etc/fstab and I get an error regarding that when Ubuntu is loading
2008-07-07T18:24:00.000Z	simNIX	Xavura	what the error ?
2008-07-07T18:24:00.000Z	Xavura	simNIX	I can't remember exactly what it was, just one of the tests that run on start-up fails
2008-07-07T18:25:00.000Z	Xavura	simNIX	It says it can be fixed by adding something to /etc/fstab, I think it's something to do with my other HDD which won't mount anymore even someone helped me get it working
