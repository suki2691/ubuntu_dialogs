2008-02-08T22:16:00.000Z	Gnea	DareDevil_	to be the 'most secure' is up to you, they all come with default values that need to be configured and tightened down.  there is no out-of-the-box-encrypt-your-piss ircd.

2008-02-08T22:18:00.000Z	DareDevil_	Gnea	thanks. but some are secure by default or their machanism is secure. what do you think about hybrid. is it free and open source?
