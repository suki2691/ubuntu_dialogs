2009-02-13T01:55:00.000Z	Xintruder		which command shows me how much ram is consumed?
2009-02-13T01:56:00.000Z	z1pp3r	Xintruder	you can use htop
2009-02-13T01:57:00.000Z	z1pp3r	Xintruder	think "top" is installed by default, but it doesnt have pretty fancy colors like htop =P
2009-02-13T01:58:00.000Z	z1pp3r	Xintruder	as rakudave said, "free -m" is probably better for just seeing ram usage
