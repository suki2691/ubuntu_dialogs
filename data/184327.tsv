2006-05-27T14:35:00.000Z	dabaR	iron	just install ubuntu-desktop. To change an ubuntu/edubuntu/kubuntu install to any of the other ones (and the other flavors) just install the corresponding -desktop package.
2006-05-27T14:36:00.000Z	dabaR	iron	just install that, and then run a "sudo aptitude dist-upgrade", it will catch any errors.
