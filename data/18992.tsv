2012-06-29T00:21:00.000Z	maquis		I just installed ubuntu 12.04, and most of my X setup is working, but I want to make adjustments to the default Xorg setup. Unfortunately, there's no xorg.conf, and I'm afraid if I try to create one manually, I'm going to end up with a setup that doesn't work.  Is there any way to get the existing xorg.conf, both as a starting point, and as a backup?
