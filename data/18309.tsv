2011-02-09T07:35:00.000Z	sha1sum		This might be slightly off-topic, but nevertheless I'm sure there are more than enough people here that would know: I'm looking for a free SaaS solution that will do the simple job of reminding me of things on specific dates, and the ability to set recurring reminders. I don't need a calendar because the reminders have nothing to do with an appointment schedule. I simply want a hosted, email reminder solution.
