2010-01-16T14:59:00.000Z	Andorin	siggy	Yeah. The problem is this: LAN connections from the router will work fine, but with wireless, I can connect to the router but not the Internet. The router is set up in front of a modem/router device with DHCP disabled because the wireless on the modem/router is crap. And the wireless was working fine earlier today when I set it up, but then I wake up and can't connect.
