2005-04-21T12:39:00.000Z	stevenj		I know this sounds sad--but all I am trying to do is copy a custom gaim folder from my home to /user/share/pixmaps and I can't do it...can someone please tell me?

2005-04-21T12:41:00.000Z	stevenj	michael_	thank you...
2005-04-21T12:43:00.000Z	stevenj	michael_	however, I still have the problem that I do not have permission to modify /usr/share/pixmaps/gaim folder
