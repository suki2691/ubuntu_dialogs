2008-02-26T02:42:00.000Z	osfameron		gah.  this booting from disk thing isn't working very well at all :-(
2008-02-26T02:42:00.000Z	osfameron		I've tried making bootable with syslinux, and install-mbr, but it still whines "missing operating system"
2008-02-26T02:43:00.000Z	bluefox83	osfameron	did you install grub? looks like there's no bootloader
2008-02-26T02:43:00.000Z	osfameron	bluefox83	I was hoping the isostick/syslinux magic would all JustWork...
