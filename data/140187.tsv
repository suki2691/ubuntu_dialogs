2011-10-02T01:11:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	qwebirc9802	ask away!
2011-10-02T01:11:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	qwebirc9802	Did you install ubuntu first, then vista?
2011-10-02T01:13:00.000Z	Shirakawasuna	qwebirc9802	that's strange, then. Did you have to recover vista at some point? If ubuntu was installed second, it should have installed GRUB to the MBR of your disk, meaning it should show the grub screen at boot
