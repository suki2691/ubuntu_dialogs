2010-06-02T07:13:00.000Z	AudicaLive		Just out of curiosity, anyone using the KDE netbook interface? Giving it a try now, and I quite like it, the only exception is that I can't figure out how to see some kind of taskbar while using Pidgin or any other application. Any way to change that? Maybe a OSX like doc, or Win7 type pinnable taskbar that's always on the bottom.
