2009-08-12T21:39:00.000Z	Roland		I've got a question... At work i have a system with 7.04 it average load is ~0.02, but my laptop (9.04) averages 0.4. Why the huge difference?

2009-08-12T21:40:00.000Z	edbian	Roland	Load is a measure of how hard the system is working.  There are many many factors
2009-08-12T21:43:00.000Z	Roland	edbian	ok, that sounds reasonable
