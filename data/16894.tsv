2011-03-15T01:41:00.000Z	PastorEd	seme	hmm. Do you have a LiveCD handy? You could boot using that, and then fsck the unmounted drive.
2011-03-15T01:42:00.000Z	PastorEd	seme	no problem. Just make sure that the partition you want to fsck is not mounted, and you should be able to check it, no problem, using the LiveCD.
