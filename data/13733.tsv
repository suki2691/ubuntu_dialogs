2012-10-10T09:05:00.000Z	subb1		I'm using thunderbird 14.0 on ubuntu 11.10, Is there a lightning package for these versions as I'm unable to find one.
2012-10-10T09:06:00.000Z	Daekdroom	subb1	you mean xul-ext-lightning doesn't work?
2012-10-10T09:12:00.000Z	subb1	Daekdroom	your suggestion worked. Thanks
