2008-11-15T20:58:00.000Z	mooded	fus10nx	there is nothing like an "ubuntu" panel.
2008-11-15T20:58:00.000Z	mooded	fus10nx	i guess you mean the "gnome panel"
2008-11-15T20:59:00.000Z	mooded	fus10nx	i guess you could just remove the panel via right-click->delete this panel.. (but i dont know if thats a useful thing)
