2010-06-14T09:46:00.000Z	karmst		Does anyone know of a way to create a deduplication storage array / folder?

2010-06-14T09:48:00.000Z	majuk	karmst	Ah, I see. Uhhh, I believe tar can throw out duplicate files, so you could tell it to just output its file list that it would compress with those options enabled
