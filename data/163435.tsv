2006-11-05T16:30:00.000Z	pete		gksu "update-manager -c" gives me this error: It is impossible to install or remove any software. Please use the package manager "Synaptic" or run "sudo apt-get install -f" in a terminal to fix this issue at first. I've sudo apt-get install -f'd, but I still get the same error. Suggestions?

2006-11-05T16:33:00.000Z	pete	Music_Shuffle	I thought Synaptic was just a GUI front for apt-get? Either way, I'll try that now.
