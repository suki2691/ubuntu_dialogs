2011-03-15T00:49:00.000Z	rvn		i popped in a usb flash drive with live ubuntu 10.10 (from the installer iso) to install onto my main box, and it doesn't recognize my network card - i've got a p43-es3g by gigabyte.. typically i find ubuntu has the drivers for all common wired and wireless interfaces, but i also have a wmp54g linksys pci card and it doesn't even see that!
2011-03-15T00:49:00.000Z	rvn		any idea?
