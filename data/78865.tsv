2008-11-08T09:05:00.000Z	gavagai		I am trying to install the nvidia drivers through Administration/Hardware Drivers.  But it never activates.  it says it is downloading and that's it.  rebooting does nothing.  is it not downloading?
2008-11-08T09:06:00.000Z	csilk	gavagai	sudo apt-get update then try again
2008-11-08T09:06:00.000Z	csilk	gavagai	also it can take a minute or so to start
2008-11-08T09:08:00.000Z	csilk	gavagai	did it work?
