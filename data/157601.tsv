2009-10-10T22:59:00.000Z	shane2peru	xarel	you have to ask a question before we can help you.  You said you tried installing to a new partition, and?  What happened?  It didn't work?  it crashed?
2009-10-10T23:02:00.000Z	shane2peru	xarel	are you dual booting?  or is the computer dedicated to Linux?  Also how much disk space do you have?
