2007-12-20T21:33:00.000Z	Slart	piotruntu	your monitor is broken?.. does it stay the same with other os's?
2007-12-20T21:34:00.000Z	Slart	piotruntu	I thought that stuff was saved in some small piece of memory in the monitor itself.. I might be wrong though
2007-12-20T21:36:00.000Z	Slart	piotruntu	ok.. I still think it's your monitor that's the blame here.. but you can control certain monitor-things, like brightness and stuff, from ubuntu.. perhaps you can make it autoconfig when you log in or something
