2009-10-01T09:46:00.000Z	AkeJay02		Thanks for the link about the filetree with Ubuntu. It makes a bit more sense now, but it is definitely one thing I don't like as much as Windoze. Is there a reason for it's complexity?

2009-10-01T09:47:00.000Z	jjrev	AkeJay02	whoever wrote all the software decided that was the best way to organize things
