2009-03-07T10:44:00.000Z	frodubuntu		I have apparently messed up the dependencies for my openoffice
2009-03-07T10:44:00.000Z	frodubuntu		and I can't seem to install it
2009-03-07T10:44:00.000Z	frodubuntu		can someone help me identify which could be the program?
2009-03-07T10:45:00.000Z	rww	frodubuntu	can you post the command you're trying to use, and the entire output (including errors) from it to http://paste.ubuntu.com/, then link to the paste page it creates here, please?
