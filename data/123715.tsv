2008-08-09T19:43:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	eitreach	cause m$ brainwashed ppl into believing they are the best and lets not forget organisations dont want to wait experienced personnel to learn how to develop rapidily in linux but want them to be able to provide quick and efficient tools to for their needs "does thta even make sense" oh well watching film
