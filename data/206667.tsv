2006-08-20T14:13:00.000Z	witless		hi. is there a utility that will  a) rip a CD to a single lossless file with all the track timing etc maintained, and  b) rip individual tracks (with tag lookup) from that file?
2006-08-20T14:14:00.000Z	sethk	witless	tracks, yes.  I don't know of one that will rip the entire cd (talking an audio cd now)
2006-08-20T14:14:00.000Z	witless	sethk	i wrote a script that did it using jack but the track info lookup no longer works  :-(
2006-08-20T14:15:00.000Z	sethk	witless	yes, I don't know a way around that, and I doubt there is one.
