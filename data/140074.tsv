2007-10-04T15:57:00.000Z	n0va		Hi all, I've tried before to get my mate to install Ubuntu but he is an ATI (crossfire+mobo) user and has always had probs, has the ATI situation improved enough of late?
2007-10-04T15:57:00.000Z	nightz	n0va	new drivers are coming
2007-10-04T15:58:00.000Z	nightz	n0va	yeah
2007-10-04T15:58:00.000Z	nightz	n0va	in newer versions of ati/amd the situation should improve alot
