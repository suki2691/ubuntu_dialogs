2007-12-18T21:28:00.000Z	ikkinu		hi all, I have a router, with a desktop and a laptop connected. On the desktop I have an apache http server running. Here the problem: I can see my homepage inside the LAN, but anyone outside can't. I enabled Virtual server with correct port and ip on the router, and no firewalls on the desktop are running. Can anyone help me, please? :)
