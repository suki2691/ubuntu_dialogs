2008-04-25T06:43:00.000Z	Roscar		pelo: that doesn't work.
2008-04-25T06:44:00.000Z	Roscar		pelo: I was looking at the release notes. They give you a list of know problems and issues for upgrading but not a list of changes.
2008-04-25T06:44:00.000Z	sammy	Roscar	because a lot of your packages are out of date, and newer, tested, 'stable' versions are available that people have released. as long as you're already getting security updates, that's the only reason. it's been either 6 months or a year, so there's probably a good number of fixes and feature updates, probably hundreds? thousands?
