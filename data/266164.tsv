2005-10-25T12:38:00.000Z	jozephus		i'm running UBUNTU LIVE - cos that's the only way i can connect through my wireless
2005-10-25T12:39:00.000Z	jozephus		but i would like 2 run debian sarge - i just can't get it 2 pick my wireless card
2005-10-25T12:40:00.000Z	tritium	jozephus	why not run ubuntu instead then?
