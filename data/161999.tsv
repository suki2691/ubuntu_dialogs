2007-08-04T05:19:00.000Z	MaxPayne		hi, could someone help me? my onboard soundcard (nvidia nforce2) supports 6 channels (5.1) but i can only use 2; i tried several tutorials but found no solution
2007-08-04T05:21:00.000Z	Karti	MaxPayne	I have a similar problem. I have a SOundblaster that only shows 2 when I speaker test but when I put a movie in I get surround
2007-08-04T05:22:00.000Z	Karti		so I tend to leave it. Have you tried that?
