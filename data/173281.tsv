2009-04-24T06:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Mekhami	nothing
2009-04-24T06:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Mekhami	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras takes care of most propritary stuff anyway
2009-04-24T06:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Mekhami	libdvdcss2  so you can play commercial dvd's, but otherwise that repo   isn't anything special
