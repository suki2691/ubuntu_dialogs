2012-02-19T23:58:00.000Z	gsr		Hi all.  I'm trying to create a Debian USB install stick.  I've downloaded an iso (debian-6.0.4-amd64-netinst.iso).  Following the debian manual (Section 4.3), I'm trying to "cat debian-6.0.4-amd64-netinst.iso > /dev/sdc1"  I know that sdc1 is the correct drive, and it's not mounted.  I am using a rootshell.  But I'm still getting a "oermission denied" error.  Anyone know what else would cause this?
