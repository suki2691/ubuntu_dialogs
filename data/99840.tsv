2008-04-03T04:12:00.000Z	SliMM	icanhasadmin	you can :-) iso, nrg, maybe cue, but i'm not sure about that last one
2008-04-03T04:13:00.000Z	icanhasadmin	SliMM	well once again, something linux can do that flabergasts me. thank you :P
2008-04-03T04:14:00.000Z	SliMM	icanhasadmin	just, search google for a script to do that automatically, and add it to the scripts folder/context menu (via nautilus-actions)
