2005-12-28T13:33:00.000Z	lowman62	ubuntu	hrmm i think you are having the same proprietary issue i was having but if you ever figure it out let me know. I sure would like to know the fix for that one
2005-12-28T13:34:00.000Z	lowman62	ubuntu	I have since bought another computer and put windows xp back on that laptop and put ubuntu on the new computer.
