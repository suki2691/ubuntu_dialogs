2004-11-16T12:34:00.000Z	justdave		I just upgraded a Beige G3 from Sid to Hoary a few days ago...  and since upgrading, it no longer recognizes the USB keyboard (but the USB mouse works just fine).  Anyone have any ideas what to look for?

2004-11-16T12:35:00.000Z	justdave	Treenaks	yeah, hotplug is installed, checked that already.  I don't know if it needs special config or not though
