2010-02-21T20:11:00.000Z	tuna-fish		Hi, I have a strange problem with sshd. It doesn't autostart on startup -- even if boot-up manager says it should start (S16 on all runlevels except single-user)
2010-02-21T20:12:00.000Z	llutz	tuna-fish	does it start manually?
2010-02-21T20:13:00.000Z	tuna-fish	llutz	yes
2010-02-21T20:15:00.000Z	llutz	tuna-fish	checked logs? syslog/messages/daemon
