2007-04-01T15:17:00.000Z	therealnanotube	jhernandez	probably the 'system monitor"?
2007-04-01T15:17:00.000Z	jhernandez	therealnanotube	thank you. in System Monitor can i define my Own Custom Perfomance Counter?
2007-04-01T15:19:00.000Z	therealnanotube	jhernandez	hmm, doesn't look like it. looks like you might want to try some other package. try searching in synaptic for a performance monitor...
