2010-01-04T05:35:00.000Z	Scott1979		my question is why when i expecting my comuter to be at idle on the network it continues to recive around 60 bytes goes up to 119 bytes and i send around 166bytes but this is in ubuntu 9.10
2010-01-04T05:35:00.000Z	Scott1979		i expect it to actually idle not send recive
2010-01-04T05:36:00.000Z	Scott1979		is this a normal thing to see packets up and down when computer is at idle
