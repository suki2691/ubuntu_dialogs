2009-09-27T21:16:00.000Z	seth		I have two questions: 1) When in firefox, after I click to open or download a file, and I check the box "do this from now on for these types of files", the popup still always shows up when I download that type of file. 2) Is it possible to embed PDF files into firefox in ubuntu J?
2009-09-27T21:17:00.000Z	seth		Can anyone help me with either of my issues?
