2005-07-15T06:44:00.000Z	brunont		Need some help. I installed winXP on my second HD(hdd2), but it seems like the win loader was installed on my first HD(hdb2). Now I installed ubuntu(hdd1) and grub had a option to the win loader. The problem is that I formatted hdb, and cant load win anymore!
2005-07-15T06:45:00.000Z	brunont		Any idea?
2005-07-15T06:46:00.000Z	flankk	brunont	you formatted the partition with windows too? that was probably more of a blessing than mistake.
2005-07-15T06:47:00.000Z	brunont	flankk	no I can still access my win partition from ubuntu... its on hdd2
