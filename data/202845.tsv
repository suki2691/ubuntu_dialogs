2007-05-08T08:30:00.000Z	gu2		sound recorder doesnt show microphone as an option for input source, how may I fix this?
2007-05-08T08:31:00.000Z	synjet	gu2	did you try prefs-->sound-->sound capture test?
2007-05-08T08:34:00.000Z	synjet	gu2	after hitting the test, speak into it.. do you hear anything? (btw hope you ticked the mute option for mic in volume-manager)
2007-05-08T08:36:00.000Z	synjet	gu2	audacity doesnt record?
