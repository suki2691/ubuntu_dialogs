2010-05-30T06:14:00.000Z	k-rad		anyone know of a way to get crashplan installed and working under lucid ?   the command line input that was supposed to launch the GUI portion didn't do anything.  i'll try prefixing it with sudo
2010-05-30T06:16:00.000Z	k-rad		its a no go sudo sudo crashplan &  so if anyone has it working under lucid i'd like to hear about it.  the idea of unlimited family plans is very appealing
2010-05-30T06:17:00.000Z	pietro10	k-rad	use only one sudo
2010-05-30T06:18:00.000Z	k-rad	pietro10	i'll double check but i'm pretty sure i did i'm all blabberfingers everywhere i go :)
