2011-11-11T07:03:00.000Z	ygor		Hello Guys..im running Ubuntu 11.10 by a flash drive, and to do that i used the universal-usb-installer.well, it works fine but, how can i change the language from english to something else running a live-cd, or a live-flash-drive? Let me explain better, i cant log-off to change the language because im using a live-cd, and if i do so, its asks me user name and password, which i dont have.
