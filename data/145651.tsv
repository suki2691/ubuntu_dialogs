2008-01-19T03:13:00.000Z	c0ldfusi0n		Alright. Can someone just tell me how to tar a bunch of files into a tar.gz archive? Without having the stupid directory structure in the gzipped file, JUST the files.
2008-01-19T03:13:00.000Z	c0ldfusi0n		tar -czf doesn't cut it.

2008-01-19T03:14:00.000Z	Flare183	c0ldfusi0n	tried looking at the man pages for tar and at gzip
