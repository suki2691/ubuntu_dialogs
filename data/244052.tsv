2005-03-31T12:30:00.000Z	|Gunther|		I had a tough time installing Ubuntu,
2005-03-31T12:31:00.000Z	|Gunther|		I had to install it 5 times in 2 and a half hours
2005-03-31T12:32:00.000Z	|Gunther|		thing I HATED about Ubuntu installer was that it always tryed to installed its boot record to hda1, which was NOT where it was needed, so i eventually unhooked all my drives and installed it like that
