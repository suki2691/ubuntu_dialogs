2007-10-29T00:43:00.000Z	Frodo		virtuoussin: try removing the packages, and re-installing them
2007-10-29T00:44:00.000Z	virtuoussin13	Frodo	I've tried reinstalling them, would completely removing them first make that big a difference?
2007-10-29T00:45:00.000Z	virtuoussin13	Frodo	that also requires removing (what looks to be) almost every other package on my system
