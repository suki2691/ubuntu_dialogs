2011-04-11T22:59:00.000Z	NerwenGreen		Hi, I just installed ubuntu onto a computer that was running Windows XP in Korean. For that reason, ubuntu apparently assumed I wanted it to be in Korean too - but i don't. How do I get it back to English?

2011-04-11T23:02:00.000Z	NerwenGreen	erUSUL	okay, I didn't see "language support" in there but there was one entry entirely in Korean, so I clicked that. The window that popped open is entirely in Korean. Please tell me exactly what buttons to press. T.T
