2010-02-03T20:53:00.000Z	lunks		Hi, I have a linux server which is currently my firewall. I have a RDP server inside the network I want to get into. I'd like to do it through SSH port, redirect, but I'm not sure how to do this. How can I redirect 192.168.1.2:3389 to localhost:3389 on this server?

2010-02-03T20:56:00.000Z	lunks	freakynl	can I forward it to the ssh server instead of localhost?
2010-02-03T20:57:00.000Z	freakynl	lunks	i don't understand. to initiate a session traffic initialy has to go from client to server, not vice versa
