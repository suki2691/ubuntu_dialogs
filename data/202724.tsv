2006-01-07T15:22:00.000Z	ScootaDoota		I agree with mwe, to get a good grasp of Samba you need to understand the config file...SWAT glosses it over
2006-01-07T15:24:00.000Z	topyli	ScootaDoota	webmin leaves the file in a readable condition. i don't know why swat has to mess it up so completely
2006-01-07T15:27:00.000Z	ScootaDoota	topyli	 I gave up on SWAT...its okay for very simple configs, but once you start to get an advanced config SWAT is no use
