2008-01-21T21:35:00.000Z	phatnutz		siphor - I also have a 120 gb and 200 gb PATA ide drive in that system.  I'd like to keep one of them free fro a possble windoze dual boot down the road.  will I find my system slow if I only use one drive for the root. boot and swap volumes?
2008-01-21T21:35:00.000Z	phatnutz		since I was on 32 bit windoze before, I expect that 64 bit ubuntu should be fast even if it's on a 7200 rpm PATA drive..
