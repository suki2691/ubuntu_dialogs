2008-02-17T06:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	maybeway36	so what does that file do
2008-02-17T07:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	maybeway36	what does that do, download the new OS, install it over the old one?
2008-02-17T07:01:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	maybeway36	artti i doubt shippit would work, only becuase he would need the alt. install CD, and they don't ship that.
