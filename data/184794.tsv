2007-04-27T07:43:00.000Z	iratik		Ubuntu seems to not be able to recognize my monitor ... I don't blame it .. Its a 42 inch plasma from toshiba.. The problem is that in the "Screen Resolution" preferences .. it only lets me choose 640x480 ... This is an injustice.. and i looked inside my /etc/X11/xorg.conf and it appears that resolutions other than that are listed ... i'm running beryl as well - - and well... c'mon ... can anyone give me some tips?
