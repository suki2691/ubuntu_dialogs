2011-01-15T07:38:00.000Z	Tobei		I followed the step-by-step instructions given at ubuntu.com for both cd and dvd installation and both discs freeze when an option is chosen at the "try ubuntu, install ubuntu" menu (yes, I've tried them all on both the cd and dvd). I don't know how to proceed, I'd really like to install ubuntu on its own partition(s)...

2011-01-15T07:40:00.000Z	Sc00t3r	Tobei	What are your system specifications? Also, have you tried using the USB installation?
2011-01-15T07:42:00.000Z	Sc00t3r	Tobei	I say try using the USB install. If you don't have a USB disk, I suggest picking one up. It's an overall better method.
