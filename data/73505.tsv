2009-10-07T00:25:00.000Z	weebit		I know that the studio version of ubuntu has the video etc apps to work with.  But what else has ubuntu studio got?  Or is missing?
2009-10-07T00:27:00.000Z	mezquitale	weebit	ubuntu studio has everything you could every need minus all the drop down menus of normal ubuntu, ubuntustudio only has one drop down main menu like windows, ubuntustudio is awesome!
