2011-09-05T18:34:00.000Z	richthegeek		hi - I need to flatten a part of a filesystem (that is, copy all files from X to a folder Y, recursively) ... how can I do this?
2011-09-05T18:35:00.000Z	richthegeek		thoughts so far are 'find * -name '' | cp targetFolder' and something similar with "ls -R"
2011-09-05T18:35:00.000Z	richthegeek		DasEI: can you expand on that a little?
2011-09-05T18:35:00.000Z	grobda24	richthegeek	I think there are a few example scripts out there for this ... search for bash scripts
