2012-01-05T06:07:00.000Z	benbloom		I'm struggling with my fstab. can someone help me? I have an nfs that i want to mount at login, but it seems like the network might not be up yet when fstab runs and so it's not finding the nfs. is there a second fstab type operation that happens later? or is there something I'm doing wrong? when i 'mount /srv/nfs/hds' after login they mount up no problem

2012-01-05T06:12:00.000Z	Chipzzz	benbloom	lol... didn't read your original question very closely... now i really dunno
