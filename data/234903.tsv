2005-06-01T07:01:00.000Z	mathmatt		i need to create a partition for winxp.  I believe i need to resize /root first.  How do I do this and how do I make the new partition?
2005-06-01T07:02:00.000Z	mathmatt		yes i understand
2005-06-01T07:02:00.000Z	zubuntu	mathmatt	i used to do that with a windoz soft partitionmagic but it seems that there's a similar and really working soft under nix :)
2005-06-01T07:25:00.000Z	zubuntu	mathmatt	i guess you're a newbie so like seveas proposed use qtparted or if you're familiar with zindowz use partitionmagic and forget about it after ;)
