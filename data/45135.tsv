2009-10-25T10:46:00.000Z	MK13		i am trying to set up a static ip for my ubuntu machine, I have it set to the same ip range that the router gives out, but when using the static address i can't even ping to the router, any suggestions?
2009-10-25T10:47:00.000Z	carbm2	MK13	are you editing your /etc/network/interfaces file for your static or are you using Network Manager to configure it?
2009-10-25T10:55:00.000Z	carbm2	MK13	can you pastebin your interfaces file?
2009-10-25T10:57:00.000Z	carbm2	MK13	also pastebin "ifconfig"
