2009-08-19T01:27:00.000Z	DrDuck		Could someone explain to me how to compile programs in ubuntu? Particularly C, as I'm having issues. I'm really not used to the linux/ubuntu platform. I'm a formal windows user, but have moved on to linux because supposedly it's a more natural environment for programming! Thanks
