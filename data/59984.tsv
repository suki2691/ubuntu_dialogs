2009-04-20T06:45:00.000Z	jwzwa	troll	i think you will have to mount to a specific location for this to work. /media on some systems.

2009-04-20T07:28:00.000Z	troll	jwzwa	you are correct, all of my mounted media is i '/media' and it works but somewhere along the way i turned that feature off. now i just want it back . I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE EASY  to put my media drives on the desktop...guess i was wrong
