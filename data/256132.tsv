2011-07-26T05:30:00.000Z	carlos		hello, my processor can run at 32 and 64 bits, which is the difference between installing 64 or 32 bit linux?
2011-07-26T05:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	carlos	 ram it can access. for the most part.. a bit of a speed gain in some cases with 64bit
2011-07-26T05:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	carlos	 ive had very few if any issues with 64bit.
2011-07-26T05:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	carlos	 if you have less then 4gb of ram. you can safely use 32bit if you wanted to
