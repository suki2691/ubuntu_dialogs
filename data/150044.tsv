2007-10-26T23:00:00.000Z	Wulfie		can anyone here give me a hand with linspire 6.0?  I have the nvidia driver (according to dpkg) and it seems to be working but my direct rendering is set to NO
2007-10-26T23:00:00.000Z	Pici	Wulfie	This is Ubuntu support, try ##linux
2007-10-26T23:00:00.000Z	Wulfie	Pici	linspire 6.0 is fiesty based
2007-10-26T23:01:00.000Z	Pici	Wulfie	And Ubuntu is debian based, but we dont do debian support here and they dont do ubuntu support.
