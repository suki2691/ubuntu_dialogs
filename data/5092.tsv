2012-02-27T17:07:00.000Z	Anomie21		Is there a way to get folders to display size like files do?
2012-02-27T17:08:00.000Z	stephanb	Anomie21	do you use nautilus? or do you want to do that on a commandline?
2012-02-27T17:10:00.000Z	Anomie21	stephanb	Yeah on nautilus
2012-02-27T17:11:00.000Z	stephanb	Anomie21	this currently is not possible, the only way to get the folders size is via "propertys"
