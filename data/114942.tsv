2008-05-13T23:07:00.000Z	Slart	wobblywu	you can always put in at the end of your terminal command line.. wget bla bla bla bla ; echo Finished
2008-05-13T23:08:00.000Z	wobblywu	Slart	I was hoping to do it through wget, but I suppose that will suffice.. thanks :)
2008-05-13T23:09:00.000Z	Slart	wobblywu	well.. it's a workaround.. but I think it works.. there might be some wget voodoo you can do to make wget do it for you.. that program has so many switches and parameters it scares me =)
