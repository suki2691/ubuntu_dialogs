2006-07-12T10:16:00.000Z	yipe	bleaked	how is that possible when metacity controls the window features and doesn't allow borderless?
2006-07-12T10:17:00.000Z	bleaked	yipe	not sure, but it's possible.  have you tried the xfce Terminal?  it does it, regardless of what WM or DE you happen to be running.
