2007-12-21T22:10:00.000Z	badiane		sorry for the enter as punctuation thing.  The advantage of using LVM is that if you make a mistake in the size of a partition you can add to it or create more dynamically.  Let's say that for some reason you have a lot of programs and your logs or whatever it is, packages from not having updating the system in a long time start to take a lot of space the you are kind of screwed and have to do a lot of management stuff
