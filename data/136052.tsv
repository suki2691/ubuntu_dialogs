2009-05-23T06:52:00.000Z	Gnea	LinuxGold	there is no one-size-fits-all, but vmware and virtualbox have their merits.. you'll have to look at them and decide for yourself
2009-05-23T06:53:00.000Z	Gnea	LinuxGold	it can't be put in the startup folder?
2009-05-23T06:53:00.000Z	Gnea	LinuxGold	you should ask in #windows then... could be a service ;)
