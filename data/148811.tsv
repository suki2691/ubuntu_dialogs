2007-03-20T08:49:00.000Z	helpplz		I have a problem - started installing ubuntu on a computer that has win2k on it already.  Told the boot cd to resize partition and use freed space -  Step 5 of 6 but its sitting here forever with an animated cursor and no hard drive activity and no CD activity, with the CD spinning up and down randomly with no access light blinking
2007-03-20T08:50:00.000Z	ant_	helpplz	: windows doesnt like to be resized as i've heard
2007-03-20T08:51:00.000Z	ant_	helpplz	: did you defrag first?
2007-03-20T08:55:00.000Z	ant_	helpplz	: consider it a learning expirience then
