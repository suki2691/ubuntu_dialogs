2010-10-11T11:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	fishscene1	Why?
2010-10-11T11:45:00.000Z	fishscene1	Jordan_U	I'm getting denial of service and this typically only happens when my ISP throttles my traffic... however, I just went completely offline and I've been ransacking my network for the cause (TONS of traffic going to the internet, but no one could get online).
