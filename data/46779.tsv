2009-09-28T03:55:00.000Z	jrebeiro		hey there I'm having a weird hard disk problem. I am using lvm and one of the disks is throwing SMART errors. The drive is not detected in the BIOS but GRUB still loads from the MBR... seems odd to me.
2009-09-28T03:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jrebeiro	Are you sure that is the drive grub is installed to?
2009-09-28T03:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jrebeiro	And the *only* drive grub is installed to?
2009-09-28T03:57:00.000Z	jrebeiro	Jordan_U	yea.. it's the only disk in the system right now
