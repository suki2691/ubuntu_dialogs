2011-06-14T02:25:00.000Z	bluebaron	RA_drc	read the manual, come back if you have specific questions ... believe me that's a loaded question
2011-06-14T02:26:00.000Z	RA_drc	bluebaron	my specific question is that when i run sudo make install on a new kernel, is it supposed to produce a initrd image?  my impression was that yes, make install creates an initrd image, but i can't find it under /boot
2011-06-14T02:29:00.000Z	RA_drc	bluebaron	so my specific question is, does make install create an initrd image?
