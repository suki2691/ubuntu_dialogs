2011-09-28T05:16:00.000Z	g0rs		hello, i'm trying to install ubuntu OS , a full installation onto a 8 GB USB drive . It is not an installation disk but a complete working ubuntu OS which is bootable from the USB drive. Can anybody let me know if you did that already and  how to setup partitions and install it
