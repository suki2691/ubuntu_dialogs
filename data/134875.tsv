2008-05-26T22:01:00.000Z	alexi5		i have a AMD64 x2 with $GB of ram and  i trying to decide whether to install the 32 bit and waste 2GB of RAM or use the 64 bit and get to use the full amouunt of memeory
2008-05-26T22:01:00.000Z	simplexio	alexi5	or use 32bit with highmeme support
2008-05-26T22:02:00.000Z	simplexio	alexi5	if you are going to use it as desktop with java + flash it much easier to just use 32bit with higmem,  but i have no idea is higmem support enabled in default ubuntu kernel
