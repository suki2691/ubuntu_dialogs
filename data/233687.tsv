2005-06-09T05:14:00.000Z	newbbie		I need to install a program called "gtk" in order to install a driver... but I can't find the correspondent package in "packages.ubuntu.com"... the gtk.org website says that there is probably a binary (pre-compiled) package for my distribution, so that I don't have to go trough the work of compiling the source code... anyone here knows anything about this? :\
2005-06-09T05:15:00.000Z	kori[idiot] 	newbbie	sudo apt-get install libgtk
2005-06-09T05:17:00.000Z	kori[idiot] 	newbbie	libgtk should be included in the installation cd
2005-06-09T05:20:00.000Z	kori[idiot] 	newbbie	should be. and probably a lot of dependancies too, but they should be in the cd too
