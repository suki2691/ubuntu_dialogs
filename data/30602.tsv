2010-06-06T01:47:00.000Z	randomhelper	etherealite	you can use previous versions (which are less secure) for less memory footprints
2010-06-06T01:48:00.000Z	etherealite	randomhelper	what if i strip out app amor of the latest release? will that make any difference?
2010-06-06T01:48:00.000Z	randomhelper	etherealite	sorry, i only know limited information about apache+sql
