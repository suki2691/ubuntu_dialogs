2007-11-14T20:54:00.000Z	Devyll		what is the diffrence betweek setting fs block-size 1024 vs 4096 !?
2007-11-14T20:54:00.000Z	ScriptDevil	Devyll	the size of a file in the filesystem ( file as in minimum size used by a file)
2007-11-14T20:55:00.000Z	Devyll	ScriptDevil	 so it's better to set it at 1024 to use as much space as possible right ?
2007-11-14T20:56:00.000Z	ScriptDevil	Devyll	actually i am not too sure.. but stick to the default..
