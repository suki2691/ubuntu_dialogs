2010-10-22T19:36:00.000Z	Nece228		why menus when i have compiz enabled are unresponsive
2010-10-22T19:36:00.000Z	Nece228		i click on menu, but nothing appears until i move my mouse cursor
2010-10-22T19:38:00.000Z	slidinghorn	Nece228	 so is it like a delayed response, more than being "unresponsive" ?
2010-10-22T19:57:00.000Z	Nece228	slidinghorn	no its not, because menu doesnt show at all until i move my mouse, no matter how long i wait
