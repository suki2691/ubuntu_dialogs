2008-07-26T07:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Ryan_Delaney	Except, get rid of the "install kubuntu-desktop" at the end (and you'll still need to remove some X stuff)
2008-07-26T07:50:00.000Z	Ryan_Delaney	Flannel	Sorry, I dont want a KDE system, I just want a terminal.
2008-07-26T07:51:00.000Z	Flannel	Ryan_Delaney	yes, I mentioned you'dneed to remove the install of kubuntu-desktop at the end.
