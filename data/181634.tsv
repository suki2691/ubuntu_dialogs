2007-01-15T14:34:00.000Z	jpjacobs	Oni-Dracula	i guess if you poke aroun in xorg.conf, it is possible
2007-01-15T14:35:00.000Z	Oni-Dracula	jpjacobs	as far as I know, xorg.conf works with the number of the button as read from xev...when two distinctly different buttons on a mouse register as the same number it seems to me impossible to use xorg.conf to map the buttons
