2009-10-04T02:41:00.000Z	yofel	eisenhower	what do you mean 'where' (linux is different from windows there)
2009-10-04T02:42:00.000Z	yofel	eisenhower	just run xchat from the menu, and if you need the executable then it's in /usr/bin
2009-10-04T02:44:00.000Z	yofel	eisenhower	check 'preferred applications' in system settings
