2010-05-09T03:52:00.000Z	Appl6	GotSanity	My laptop hardly ever uses the fan when it runs Ubuntu.  It doesn't seem to produce excess heat though.
2010-05-09T03:52:00.000Z	Appl6	GotSanity	Ubuntu seems to wait till it gets very hot before turning on the fan.
2010-05-09T03:54:00.000Z	GotSanity	Appl6	well the issue I am running into is that ever since I did an upgrade (and a fresh install after) I am running into excessive heat coming from the palm rests on my laptop. the cpu is idle and on power save mode but im still kicking a lot of heat
