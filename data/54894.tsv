Why call the alias?  Just create the launcher with the full command instead.  Best of luck.

2009-06-08T00:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	freenode2	I'd try putting the launch to "xterm -e <THE COMMAND YOU'RE USING>" and see if it works then.
2009-06-08T00:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	freenode2	if you try running the command you are using in a terminal does it work?  Sorry man i gotta run - so hope you can figure it out.  good luck.
