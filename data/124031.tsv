2007-08-23T16:11:00.000Z	GoFcukYourself	kritzstapf	it would be much faster running fluxbox
2007-08-23T16:12:00.000Z	kritzstapf	GoFcukYourself	im not expecting my father to use fluxbox
2007-08-23T16:13:00.000Z	GoFcukYourself	kritzstapf	i don't know about him.. i'm just saying fluxbox would be blazing fast compared to xfce
