2010-05-16T05:29:00.000Z	mathieu	BentSpace	every NAS should be accessed remotely, otherwise it'd be just a simple stupid hard disk ;-)
2010-05-16T05:33:00.000Z	BentSpace	mathieu	I was looking into get the WD My Book World Edition NAS as it was highly rated, but apparent to access your files remotely you have to go through WD's website, but I read it could be hacked to access the drive directly via SSH or FTP?  Is this a good choice for a NAS is there sometime better for Linux users as it doesn't say it's Linux compatible on their website?
