2011-08-01T11:24:00.000Z	JayPro		1st time setting up raid.. i have two 1TB harddrives in a raid 1 set up. if i install ubuntu on one of the harddrives, is the data automatically copied to the other harddrive? or should both drives show up as one drive in the ubuntu installation?
2011-08-01T11:26:00.000Z	JayPro		ahh okay.. soo.. i must have set up the raid 1 incorrectly then..

2011-08-01T11:26:00.000Z	JayPro	fmauro	... your saying it should show up as ONE drive, right
