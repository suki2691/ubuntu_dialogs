2007-11-17T03:37:00.000Z	jsschmid1		how do I get the KERNEL MAKEFILE ... while trying to make I get the error "Kernel Makefile not found at '/lib/modules/2.6.22-14-generic/source/"
2007-11-17T03:37:00.000Z	nickrud	jsschmid1	have you installed linux-source ?
2007-11-17T03:44:00.000Z	jsschmid1	nickrud	I did the following: sudo apt-get build-dep linux-source-2.6.22                       apt-get source linux-source-2.6.22
2007-11-17T03:45:00.000Z	nickrud	jsschmid1	not sure then, I haven't done a kernel compile in a couple of years
