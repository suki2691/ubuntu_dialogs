2011-07-21T01:26:00.000Z	Testtube1	mandrake	on 11/23/2010 we created a image of /dev/sda1 that contains /boot we deployed it to 1200 ubuntu machines out in the field remotely. Once it came time for a forced fsck it shows data issues with a inode. The file that resides on the inode has a modfied date of 11/20/10 three days prior to when the image was deployed.
