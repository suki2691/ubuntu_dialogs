2005-11-29T06:18:00.000Z	Ayame		Hey, having an issue with a duplicate block on my hard drive. I know fsck will repair it, but I can't run fsck. Can anyone help?
2005-11-29T06:18:00.000Z	Ayame		Does ubuntu have a preset root password? I need it to repair my system, outside of the GUI. Otherwise I can't run fsck
2005-11-29T06:18:00.000Z	Seveas	Ayame	boot into recue mode - it does not need a password
2005-11-29T06:19:00.000Z	Seveas	Ayame	recue, recovery -- it's all the same :)
