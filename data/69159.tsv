2009-02-27T22:15:00.000Z	oCean_	Daft_Punk	I don't think it's "variable" though... it's all dependent on theme
2009-02-27T22:21:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	oCean_	that is what i am using now, i wanted something so that i can use a wallpaper that is both dark and light (gradient) but that method is only 1 solid color, either white or black or whatever, not shadowed or layered like in windows (if you know what i mean)
2009-02-27T22:23:00.000Z	oCean_	Daft_Punk	I understand. Saw you question pass here yesterday I think. It seems that with gnome it's always 1 color :(
