2012-10-18T21:46:00.000Z	domtron		hello, I'm looking for an editor that can give a realtime preview for text files like html, markdown, and latex and is/is like vim.
2012-10-18T21:48:00.000Z	olinux	domtron	i'm a vim fan for several years and lately using sublimetext exclusively
2012-10-18T21:49:00.000Z	domtron	olinux	thanks I'll check it out
2012-10-18T21:52:00.000Z	domtron	olinux	wow that's pricey, and I didn't see rendering as a feature
