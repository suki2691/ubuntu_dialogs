2007-06-04T08:46:00.000Z	lunixman		i have one physical drive with atleast 3 partitions. i'd like to know, if i detele one of my partitions and convert it into empty space, will it become free space for my linux partition?
2007-06-04T08:46:00.000Z	lunixman		i have a partition with atleast 80 gigs of space, if i convert it to empty space will it be relegated to my linux partition?
