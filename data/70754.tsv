2008-12-25T04:18:00.000Z	crow_		a friend of mine has ubuntu installed, but she can't get wireless internet on it. it says some drivers are missing. She can't get the drivers using Synaptic Package Manager cause wireless is the only way she can connect to internet. Can she download the drivers from another computer and transfer them to her ubuntu one and install them locally, and how? Thanks.
