2009-02-22T21:51:00.000Z	Spl0it_		I had a question about the 64 bit version of Ubuntu, is it only for the AMD platforms?
2009-02-22T21:51:00.000Z	Spl0it_		hmmm ok
2009-02-22T21:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	Spl0it_	supports both amd and intel (and the via nano i guess)
2009-02-22T21:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	Spl0it_	amd deserves the credit linux devs give for creating the architecture
