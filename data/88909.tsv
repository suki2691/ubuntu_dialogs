2008-06-01T01:10:00.000Z	Noxide		so im trying to get my broadcom wireless adapter working and im stuck. it says it recognizes it and according to the wiki it should be supported but it still wont connect.
2008-06-01T01:11:00.000Z	Noxide		does anyone know how to install BCM43xx-fwcutter (apt) ?
2008-06-01T01:13:00.000Z	Steve-Cal	Noxide	The last I read at the help.ubuntu.com website, the bcm43xx modules all ready come with Hardy. Are you using Hardy?
2008-06-01T01:14:00.000Z	Noxide	Steve-Cal	Yes im using hardy. And that is why I'm not sure why it wont work. I seem to have lost my network manager from my taskbar too.
