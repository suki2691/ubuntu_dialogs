2008-02-11T09:19:00.000Z	rkroetch		I just reinstalled Kubuntu 7.1 and fully upgraded. Now whenever I do anything but update with apt (or adept naturally) I get a segfault
2008-02-11T09:19:00.000Z	rkroetch		Anyone experience similar problems happening with apt?
2008-02-11T09:19:00.000Z	owen1	rkroetch	thanks.
