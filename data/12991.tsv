2011-06-22T02:28:00.000Z	Johnnee_		i was prompted to perform an automatic update and my ubuntu got corrupted and i can no longer boot into it... i get the list of OS to choose from, but the timer is gone and when i select any of the ubuntu entries it doesn't work.

2011-06-22T02:31:00.000Z	Johnnee_	sarit	i already tried that.. now i get a mssg: unspecified error
2011-06-22T02:32:00.000Z	sarit	Johnnee_	hm... kinda vague :)
