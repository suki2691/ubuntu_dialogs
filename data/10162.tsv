2011-09-09T02:26:00.000Z	alkafoo	Pooky1	the uppermost assemblage is called Unity, yes
2011-09-09T02:31:00.000Z	alkafoo	Pooky1	I can conceive of ordinary Unity being disabled if you don't have a suitabale graphics device
2011-09-09T02:33:00.000Z	Pooky1	alkafoo	there was crash and fatal error in ubuntu which include .ICEauthority...after some changes i was able to login in and install unity 2D which seems to be working fine, so i supouse i can reinstall unity too
