2007-11-21T01:56:00.000Z	DrakeJustice_	sledgehammer	you need to add the repo b4 you install the packages...
2007-11-21T01:56:00.000Z	sledgehammer	DrakeJustice_	someone who is good with ubuntu told me the wiki has direct downloads of some packages.
2007-11-21T01:57:00.000Z	DrakeJustice_	sledgehammer	may be... but without the repo it cannot auto-install dependencies and fix problems and so forth
