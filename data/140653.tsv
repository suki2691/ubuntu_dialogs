2007-04-23T07:08:00.000Z	nny		ok so rausb (the interface name for ralink wireless card) shows up in network manager, but it never connects or shows signal strength. We had to install drivers from source. there seems to be a disconnect between the two, as i can set manually using iwconfig and dhclient. Any Advice???
