2007-08-16T06:34:00.000Z	StarQuest		 running ubuntu 7.04.  at random times, the system will freeze for a second or two.  it just sort of "catches" momentarily, then goes back to working normally.  any idea?

2007-08-16T06:36:00.000Z	StarQuest	Pici	when i've got the system monitor open, it doesn't ever do it
2007-08-16T06:36:00.000Z	Pici	StarQuest	hmm.. thats very odd
