2011-03-15T17:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_TCL	cosmo_	 are you ever going to use the feature? if not then disable it.. i wouldent 'uninstall' it.
2011-03-15T17:05:00.000Z	cosmo_	Dr_Willis_TCL	 I just meant remove it from startup
2011-03-15T17:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_TCL	cosmo_	 try it and see.. shouldent hurt anything.
