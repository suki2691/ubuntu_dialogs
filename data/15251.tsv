2011-06-30T23:09:00.000Z	escott	Cameron__	then your problem is somewhere in the wpasupplicant stack/config... which I know next to nothing about. I would suggest reinstalling the wpa related programs and perhaps removing wpa related files in /etc prior to reinstall
2011-06-30T23:09:00.000Z	escott	Cameron__	maybe someone has a better idea how to debug this
