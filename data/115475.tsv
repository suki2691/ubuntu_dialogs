2007-10-26T10:14:00.000Z	NolanG		I updated my Feisty to Gutsy, and now I have problems with WoW/Wine with frame rates. I get 20% of my frame rates most of the time, with it "spiking" to "normal" frame rates.  The spike happens a lot when WoW gains focus.  So far I have tried different graphics card drivers, updating Wine to the latest version from winehq.org, and rebuilding my kernel to remove the "tickless kernel feature".  Any ideas what else I should try?
