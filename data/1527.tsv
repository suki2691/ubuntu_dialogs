2012-08-18T07:58:00.000Z	somsip	viralfrost	update-grub2 does find the images for -29, but I guess that update-grub was doing the same thing. I'll check on next boot

2012-08-18T08:02:00.000Z	somsip	viralfrost	thankd for the idea, but grub has always updated automatically so if that's stopped it sugegst something else is wrong. Another MBR having grub seems to make sense given what I found on the web before asking
