2011-01-17T00:48:00.000Z	gaugeinvariance		Hi. I have an nvidia card and was running the nouvaeu drivers. I decided to upgrade to the 'recommended' binary nvidia driver but when I restarted the system did not boot. It does not even boot to single/recovery mode. It prints a bunch of stuff (no obvious error) and then the screen goes blank as if it's suspended. I'd be grateful if soembody could help. Thanks.
