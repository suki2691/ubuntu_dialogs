2007-04-22T11:45:00.000Z	Kazol		What is the normal idle load average? I'm getting ~0.5 with all applets and widgets running on a 500Mhz. CPU.

2007-04-22T11:46:00.000Z	Kazol	taggie	thx, I was afraid 500Mhz is too slow.
2007-04-22T11:47:00.000Z	taggie	Kazol	if you have speed issues, and are running standard ubuntu, you may want to try xfce instead of gnome. you can install with: sudo apt-get install xubuntu and then you'll be able to switch back and forth between both. xfce tends to be nicer to slow procs.
