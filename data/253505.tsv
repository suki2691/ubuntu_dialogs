2008-07-18T03:05:00.000Z	umanerrr		Hello there. I am desperately trying to send emails through the command line using sendmail. It works in windows xp (virtual machine) fine, but it simply does not workin in ubuntu. I use the following syntax "sendmail -f SENDER@gmail.com -t RECIPIENT@gmail.com -u SUBJECTNAME -m MESSAGE BODY -s smtp.gmail.com:587 -xu GMAILUSERNAME -xp PASSWORD" (i do the same in windows but with "sendmail.exe"). When i type that command in terminal and then press enter, it
2008-07-18T03:05:00.000Z	umanerrr		is as if the command does not get executed, there is a small black rectangle that appears below and starts blinking but i cannot execute other commands, it is like it does not register, the "USERNAME@COMPUTERNAME:~$" does not appear. and i do not receive an error from sendmail, the message simply does not get sent. I hope someone can help. Thanks in advance
