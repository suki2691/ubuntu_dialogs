2008-06-07T01:59:00.000Z	RomanaMentalis		i have an ubuntu server and I'm not sure how many hard drives are in it or what their partitions look like - how can I get information about what is in my system?
2008-06-07T01:59:00.000Z	anirudh0	RomanaMentalis	df
2008-06-07T02:00:00.000Z	anirudh0	RomanaMentalis	thats a terminal command
2008-06-07T02:01:00.000Z	anirudh0	RomanaMentalis	the fdisk -l method is probably better..mtab and df will only show mounted partitions
