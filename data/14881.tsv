2011-07-15T07:12:00.000Z	tauntaun		Newbie question: Do email clients each have their own particular file formats, and if yes, how do I commit to one?
2011-07-15T07:13:00.000Z	tauntaun		Of course I've googled around...I'm really wondering if it's easy to convert between formats if I need to change clients.
