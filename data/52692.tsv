2009-07-13T00:39:00.000Z	thestarlion		I need a bit of help. I need to resize the main partition on my ubuntu computer, the active one, but I can't because it's mounted. I can't use a live cd because there's no cd drive, and the usb port is dead. is it possible to resize the active partition somehow
