2008-03-06T23:58:00.000Z	quarsaw	demonspork	are you running apache?
2008-03-06T23:58:00.000Z	demonspork	quarsaw	the web server is running IIS, but I would like to mount a folder from that server locally on my Ubuntu system
2008-03-07T00:00:00.000Z	quarsaw	demonspork	oh I see, I don' tknow how to do that, I've recently done the opposite, serving a folder with apache
