2011-03-18T21:38:00.000Z	kaehkoenen	ChrisGagnon_	thanks, I'm fairly sure I've messed something up in the xorg.conf.d directory
2011-03-18T21:39:00.000Z	kaehkoenen	ChrisGagnon_	segfault: most likely with the 50-synaptics.conf file
2011-03-18T21:45:00.000Z	kaehkoenen	ChrisGagnon_	Is there a place I would go to disable /dev/input/mouse0?
