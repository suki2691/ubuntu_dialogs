2011-01-01T22:10:00.000Z	rs0832	sda1986	:) it is called a child process and parent process.. you can run the program by pressing alt-f2 and running the command from there..
2011-01-01T22:11:00.000Z	sda1986	rs0832	but if the process you have to start is gnome-panel you cannot, so i start it from terminal with & at the end and then i do "disown"
2011-01-01T22:11:00.000Z	sda1986	rs0832	 so i can close the terminal without kill the son
