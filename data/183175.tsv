2007-06-15T06:17:00.000Z	Jared		Is there a way to set my taskbar where windows would be over it and not stop where it starts? I don't want to do autohide either.
2007-06-15T06:17:00.000Z	Pelo	Jared	 right click properties, check in there

2007-06-15T06:19:00.000Z	Pelo	Jared	 either that or play around with the stuff in  gconf-editor
