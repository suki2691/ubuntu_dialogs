2012-04-28T02:35:00.000Z	JessicaW	Lint	Ubuntu can TOTALLY mount shares on windows servers.
2012-04-28T02:36:00.000Z	Lint	JessicaW	not on 2003+/Vista+
2012-04-28T02:37:00.000Z	JessicaW	Lint	sure it will. I have two 2008 server shares, 2 windows7 shares, and 1 vista share. It's only the XP one I'm having a problem with.
