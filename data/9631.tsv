2011-09-11T00:46:00.000Z	Haumea		hey guys, I recently installed Ubuntu 11.04 and am a bit new to linux. I was wondering why, even though java usually runs faster on linux than windows why I get so much lag on things that used to run fine.
2011-09-11T00:47:00.000Z	mosty	Haumea	which jvm? gcj (yuck) or openjdk?
2011-09-11T00:48:00.000Z	Haumea	mosty	I tried openJDK and sun java but neither ran Minecraft well
2011-09-11T00:50:00.000Z	mosty	Haumea	if sun/oracle's jdk doesn't run a java app well, it's the java app's fault
