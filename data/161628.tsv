2006-10-31T10:57:00.000Z	Supremacygnu	cliffd	well, my update messed up my whole computer... still trying to make it work.
2006-10-31T10:58:00.000Z	cliffd	Supremacygnu	what about a fresh install? do you think the mess up was from updating config files?
2006-10-31T10:58:00.000Z	Supremacygnu	cliffd	well, A fresh install would probably work yes
