2008-09-16T07:31:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Scunizi	i'm using feisty, not hardy. so no fancy xrandr hardy stuff for me...
2008-09-16T07:40:00.000Z	Scunizi	therealnanotube	check out http://paste.ubuntu.com/47312/  it's from some old notes I made getting xinerama to work on Dapper and will probably work on Feisty.. it's been a while
2008-09-16T07:49:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Scunizi	yea, besides some nvidia-specific stuff, that's basically what mine looks like as well. the thing is, it basically works, just doesn't use the correct resolution on the external monitor... so i'm guessing i need to figure out what some of those warnings coming out of xorg.0.log mean...
