2008-08-08T14:36:00.000Z	chazco		Hi... how can I improve Ubuntus boot time? On the same hardware it takes Ubuntu 71 seconds (48 to GDM, 23 to desktop) when Windows XP takes just 47 (27 to login prompt, 20 to usable desktop)... ideas?
2008-08-08T14:37:00.000Z	chazco		Googled it quite a bit, no reliable advice it seems... lots of ideas, little success
2008-08-08T14:38:00.000Z	chazco		So its either stick with XP or try another distro?
