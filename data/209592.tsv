2006-03-10T09:41:00.000Z	cribbon		i have a really bothering problem, when i download something ( tar.gz ) archive manager opens. But i just want to save it, any ideas ? ( I have tried both epiphany and firefox )
2006-03-10T09:41:00.000Z	LjL	cribbon	right click, "save link as", or something similar, i guess

2006-03-10T09:42:00.000Z	cribbon	LjL	nah, it isnt that easy. It must be builtin somehow, that when it discoverers a tar.gz file it automatically executes archive manager. But i dont want that...
