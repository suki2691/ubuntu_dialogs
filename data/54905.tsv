2009-06-07T14:56:00.000Z	Morkeleb		whats the latest kernel currently, so i can check how up-to-date a distro is?
2009-06-07T14:57:00.000Z	Morkeleb		is there a guide how to use unetbootin - i'd thought of using an usb stick before instead of cd
2009-06-07T14:58:00.000Z	stevecam	Morkeleb	you might want to use the windows version the linux one doesnt work the best
2009-06-07T15:00:00.000Z	Morkeleb	stevecam	but with windows version you just mean the way to set up the bootable usb stick, right?
