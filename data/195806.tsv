2007-06-10T06:44:00.000Z	kitche	joebob777as7	do you mean copy a file over or on the same machine?
2008-09-26T04:10:00.000Z	kitche	joebob777as7	because it's how your xinerama is setup but think xinerama does that anyways
2008-09-26T04:11:00.000Z	kitche	joebob777as7	yep looks like xinerama does that actually you need to use something else I believe for what you want besides xinerama
