2006-11-11T08:15:00.000Z	X1F35QZH		hi, after editing xorg.conf and /etc/firefox/firefoxrc firefox still crashes  in edgy.
2006-11-11T08:15:00.000Z	X1F35QZH		I am quite desperate
2006-11-11T08:16:00.000Z	X1F35QZH		would anyone know how to help please?
2006-11-11T08:17:00.000Z	ifireball	X1F35QZH	did you try creating a new user and running FF as that user? many firefox-related problems are due to the config files in your home-dir
