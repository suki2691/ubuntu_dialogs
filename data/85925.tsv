2008-12-31T14:31:00.000Z	Squawk		Hey chaps, just done a fresh install on a maters puter, everything working fine except for xine. Xine is looking for /dev/dvd, but the device is at scd0. A symbolic link in /dev sorts the problem but does not persist after a restart (/dev created on the fly presumably, I'm new to ubuntu, not linux). Any help

2008-12-31T14:34:00.000Z	hateball	Squawk	Then again.. I'm sure it's configurable in Xine
2008-12-31T14:34:00.000Z	Squawk	hateball	actually I figure it has to be configurable in xine, just not figured it out yet and was kinda hoping someone might know off hand
