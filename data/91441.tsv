2008-05-07T18:55:00.000Z	W5CT	starcannon	 thanks, for safety's sake?
2008-05-07T18:56:00.000Z	starcannon	W5CT	yeah, most of the major issues I've seen here and on forums are coming from upgrade installs, clean cd install is the way to go, is how I did it and nothing went wrong here, FF3 is kinda clunky but thats bloat
