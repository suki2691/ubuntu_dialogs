2011-03-07T04:05:00.000Z	schoppenhauer		hello. I have a strange problem: in firefox, youtube-videos are shown in a purple color (e.g. the colors are messed up - maybe the green channel is missing or something). I cannot really find anything about this problem.
2011-03-07T04:05:00.000Z	schoppenhauer		this only happens in firefox. in chromium they are shown correctly.
