2011-10-06T06:40:00.000Z	wxl		i'll be honest.. i'm coming here trying to get help with lubuntu but figure there are enough similaries.. so i've got a powerbook g4 ppc i'm trying to fit ocelot on via the alternate cd (there's something borked about ubiquity on the desktop that i can't fix) and all is fine and well.. until it goes to detect the cdrom. i can't even find it in the device tree. seen some suggestion of using modprobe ide-scsi but this module doesn't exist. any ideas?
