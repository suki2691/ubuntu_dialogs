2007-04-02T05:13:00.000Z	darksoule		I have ubuntu on another computer. I cannot get many programs because it does not have KDE. I cannot get online yet but have been taking downloads over via usbdrive. I have Kubuntu. I want to get the KDE off of that. I tried to add cd rom to the reposatory but it unmounts the cd. what am I doing wrong? http://www.pastebin.ca/420201
