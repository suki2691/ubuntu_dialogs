2010-01-26T16:41:00.000Z	nigelcourtney		Question : Is there any advantage of migrating from a windows platform to Ubuntu in terms of a home media server, I use windows 2003 Ent edition at the moment and considering if Ubuntu might be a better platform for media sharing and movie playback. Had some issues in the past with poor flash performance on ubuntu
2010-01-26T16:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	nigelcourtney	if it is for the server why does the playback performance matter? you do the playback in the clients ...
2010-01-26T16:44:00.000Z	nigelcourtney	erUSUL	I use the main server for other jobs as well as a media server,  such as basic 2d cad work
2010-01-26T16:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	nigelcourtney	then i guess that the Cad work would be more limiting ... autocad does not run in linux ...
