2008-05-29T21:18:00.000Z	Webu		I have a SSH connection to my remote server and I need to make some changes to my router settings, but unfortunately lynx doesn't support form buttons properly so I can't save them, any ideas what to try? Is there a better CLI browser or any other ways to do this?

2008-05-29T21:18:00.000Z	Webu	Myrtti	okey thanks, I'll try if that helps.
