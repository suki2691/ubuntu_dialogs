2008-01-11T08:52:00.000Z	truna_	chris062689	do you have to use access? there are better databases like mysql
2008-01-11T08:53:00.000Z	truna_	chris062689	off course not, you can use mysql to store your data, and do your sql too
2008-01-11T08:54:00.000Z	truna_	chris062689	well this is not access support line :)
