2009-12-28T06:32:00.000Z	Xaero		I have a filesystem question, I'm trying to figure out which filesystem I would be best off using... I have a 2tb disk array which I'm hoping to get both a decent amount of performance and stability out of, but mainly I will be using it for video files, music and gaming, which filesystem would you use?
2009-12-28T06:33:00.000Z	Blue1	Xaero	I'd use a journaling file system like ext3/ext4 or reiserfs...
2009-12-28T06:34:00.000Z	Xaero	Blue1	nomnex: thanks for the insight, looks like ext4 it is
2009-12-28T06:34:00.000Z	Blue1	Xaero	as an aside -- I have used reiserfs without problems for 4 years -- I'd switch but I don't have enough room to back up the 1 t/b drive
