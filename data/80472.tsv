2010-04-12T22:07:00.000Z	aar		Hi, is it possible to create a script for lynx that will prompt me for a password so it can login to my webmail account, do a source code "-dump", and then exit? Feeding it the variable with the password is where I'm struggling.

2010-04-12T22:11:00.000Z	aar	Dmole	I suppose I could get the bash script to generate a lynx script (including the password fed to the bash script with read password) before running lynx.
2010-04-12T22:11:00.000Z	aar	Dmole	I'll try that
