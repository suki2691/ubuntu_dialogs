2006-04-02T14:22:00.000Z	snoopy_		i have a default installation of ubuntu 5.10 breezy and it does not put /home in a seperate partition (correct?) and i was wondering if i could change that now and put it on a separate partition so i dont lose anything when updating etc..

2006-04-02T14:23:00.000Z	doubletwist	snoopy_	Well maybe you can do that...
