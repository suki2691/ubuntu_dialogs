2010-06-11T02:21:00.000Z	darko3d		ever since i installed ubuntu(3 days), i downloaded around 2 gbs worth of packages, is there a way for me to backup the packages i downloaded for future use?
2010-06-11T02:22:00.000Z	Docteh	darko3d	look into apt-cacher
2010-06-11T02:22:00.000Z	Docteh	darko3d	i'm not sure if the apt package includes the importer script though
