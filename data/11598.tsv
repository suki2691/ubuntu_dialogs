2011-11-29T05:11:00.000Z	bombtrack01		Hey guys! I'm having problems with videos in Ubuntu. Everytime I try to open videos on Movie Player, it closes. If I try to play with VLC, the whole X restarts. When I try to open "OpenShot" (a video editor) X also restarts. Do you have any clue on what might be happening?
2011-11-29T05:13:00.000Z	TimStarling	bombtrack01	have you checked the syslog?
2011-11-29T05:14:00.000Z	bombtrack01	TimStarling	I've tried to read some files on var/log but didn't find anything. I guess I'm searching on the wrong place.
2011-11-29T05:15:00.000Z	bombtrack01	TimStarling	which file should I search for error outputs of this kind?
