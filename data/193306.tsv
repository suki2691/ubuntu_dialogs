2006-04-01T06:43:00.000Z	redguy	Hereford	what is the difference between firefox 1.0.7 and firefox 1.5 ?
2006-04-01T06:55:00.000Z	redguy	Hereford	you might have to configure it in .pinerc or something similar. I am not a pine user so I can't help you more...
2006-04-01T06:56:00.000Z	Hereford	redguy	 Thanks anyway.  I've been fumbling all night and thought I'd try here too.
