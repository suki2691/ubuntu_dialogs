2007-12-31T04:52:00.000Z	Bob_Dole		what do I have to do to install Ubuntu with the ReiserFS?
2007-12-31T04:52:00.000Z	Bob_Dole		I can format drives to it
2007-12-31T04:52:00.000Z	th0r	Bob_Dole	chose ReiserFS when you format the partitions at install
2009-07-19T01:51:00.000Z	Bob_Dole	th0r	I did that once.. filled the RAM with no swap on.. Acronis hosed the swap partition's UUID...didn't notice until it was too late
