2009-07-02T01:43:00.000Z	s1gmab3ta		im trying to delete all the folders in a certain folder under a certain size. unfortunately, nautilus only shows folder size in terms of file count, not in terms of total item size. how should i go about this?
2009-07-02T01:43:00.000Z	s1gmab3ta		is there a setting i can change in nautilus?
