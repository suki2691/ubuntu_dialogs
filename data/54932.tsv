2009-06-07T09:29:00.000Z	Wolf23	Solarswordsman	 VLC is unable to open the MRL 'mms://205.142.78.11/jazlive'. Check the log for details.
2009-06-07T09:30:00.000Z	Solarswordsman	Wolf23	Hmm.. well there are a considerable number of possibilities on this website, Ctrl+F and look for Al Jazeera, there's a lot of URLS: http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/872407/posts
2009-06-07T09:32:00.000Z	Solarswordsman	Wolf23	 Well you need to find the complete URL... otherwise VLC can't do anything :)
