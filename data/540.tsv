2012-10-31T23:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Terrabull	resarch the chipsets
2012-10-31T23:18:00.000Z	Terrabull	ikonia	im getting mixed results. cant find a straight answer from google OR the asus support site.
2012-10-31T23:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Terrabull	then you'll get mixed answers here, don't look at the asus site, find the chipsets on the board and resarch their compatability individuallyu
