2008-11-11T18:04:00.000Z	Frogging101		I am trying to make my ubuntu partiton bigger, using space from another partition. I can shrink the other partition no problem, but the ubuntu partiton is locked because it is mounted. When I try to unmount it there is an error message saying that it couldnt unmount the partition because there may be other partitions mounted on the same mountpoint. There are no other mounted partitions. I am using Gparted.\
