2008-05-30T21:07:00.000Z	TheOV		I'm having trouble with the 8.04 alternate CD. When it gets to the "Install the base system" step, it says "Can't download package libacl1 (and so on, through the whole list of packages)". It seems to not be reading the CD. This CD passed the integrity test.
2008-05-30T21:08:00.000Z	J-_	TheOV	Does the CD have the proper MD5 Checksum?
2008-05-30T21:09:00.000Z	TheOV	J-_	the CD passed the test (the one on the CD)
2008-05-30T21:18:00.000Z	J-_	TheOV	Did you check out the md5 factoid? do the checksums match up?
