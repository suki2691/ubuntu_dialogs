2007-12-01T23:27:00.000Z	bjames		I'm running Ubuntu 7.10 and find it really hard to actually grab window edges to resize windows - is there a way to increase the window bored grab region?
2007-12-01T23:28:00.000Z	skel	bjames	you can hit alt-f8 if the window has focus
2007-12-01T23:28:00.000Z	skel	bjames	and resize that way
2007-12-01T23:29:00.000Z	skel	bjames	no worries :)
