2009-03-08T04:20:00.000Z	ajehals	s3a	- could be a drive, or any other mechanical component (fan / cdrom etc..)
2009-03-08T04:21:00.000Z	s3a	ajehals	so its hd, cd or fan? it shouldnt be my less than 1 year old cpu?
2009-03-08T04:22:00.000Z	ajehals	s3a	- thats the list of culprits I would assume first.  you cpu isn't mechanical, so it really shouldn't make any noises.
