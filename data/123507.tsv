2008-05-19T10:06:00.000Z	branstrom		Why is ruby1.8 installed by default, but not the metapackage ruby, that depends on ruby1.8?
2008-05-19T10:06:00.000Z	branstrom		and the same for irb1.8 => irb, etc
2008-05-19T10:08:00.000Z	astro76	branstrom	actually neither ruby or ruby1.8 are installed by default
2008-05-19T10:09:00.000Z	branstrom	astro76	oh, maybe so
