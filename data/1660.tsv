2012-08-07T16:31:00.000Z	UKWolfy		Quick queston, is it possible to change the colour of the status icons in ubuntu 12.04? (I mean the icons along the top right, battery indicator, sound, time etc)

2012-08-07T16:35:00.000Z	UKWolfy	ActionParsnip	Ah I see, you wouldn't know if there are any themes that look the same as ambiance but with blue icons?
