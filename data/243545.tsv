Because if I manage to get sound working, and the steam games work decently with Wine.  I may end up shrinking the Vista partition, and enlarging this since this does more of what I want in a nicer fashion :>

2007-09-21T15:25:00.000Z	[nrx] 	Elda	be carefull with that... Vista doesn't like it when you mess with it's partition
