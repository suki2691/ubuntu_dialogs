The problem is this should be simple like it's in windows 7, in a way i can tell my mon on telephone how to setup if needed. This is a very basic stuff, but i couldn't make this works stright, and i'm googling more than 1 hour with no sucess
2012-11-15T08:53:00.000Z	NeedFreedom	krababbel	Yeah. Like I (tryed) to say, I used the network manager tab before trying the pppconf. I created the dsl connection. But it didn't startup it, neither I found anyplace (like the networkmanager menu to ask for dial up it).
2012-11-15T08:55:00.000Z	NeedFreedom	krababbel	As this installation is already f***ed up, I'll install xubuntu 12.10. But i suspect i'll have the same problem, because after this precise installation I tryied the quantal, but it was extremelly slow (like, 1 minute to open a window). And in the quantal I gotta the same issue
2012-11-15T08:59:00.000Z	NeedFreedom	krababbel	maybe. I think the expected behaviour is to give a option to dialup it . My ethernet (eth0) was down, so this can confused the network manager. But If it expect a dsl connection to be dialled up only on ethernet, it's wrong
