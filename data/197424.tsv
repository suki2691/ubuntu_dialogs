2006-03-10T06:01:00.000Z	d1zZy^		one question, i'm trying to install the libdvdcss2 packet, but i always get the message, that it isn't available
2006-03-10T06:02:00.000Z	Healot	d1zZy^	libdvdcss isn't legal... debian or any debian-based distro won't distribute it
2006-03-10T06:02:00.000Z	Healot	d1zZy^	you can get that package at vlc's website though
