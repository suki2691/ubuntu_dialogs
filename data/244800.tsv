2005-04-10T08:36:00.000Z	LordGrunt		hmm, about my question, pls?
2005-04-10T08:38:00.000Z	prego	LordGrunt	using gdm or kdm?
2005-04-10T08:38:00.000Z	prego	LordGrunt	because in gdm you can choose the languaje or the user session... I guess that in KDM you can do that also
2005-04-10T08:39:00.000Z	LordGrunt	prego	kde, but think i found reason, package was outdated
