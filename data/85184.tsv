2010-03-03T02:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	The-Kernel	install bleachbit and use all the options that arent said to be slow, close as many apps as you can to maximise effectiveness, also remove any old kernels you no longer use
2010-03-03T02:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	The-Kernel	use the same way as a desktop to upgrade: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade; sudo apt-get clean
2010-03-03T02:38:00.000Z	The-Kernel	ActionParsnip	it deleted 5 megs lol
