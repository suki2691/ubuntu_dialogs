2006-09-26T06:52:00.000Z	zkorpio		anyone knows if ubuntu has a lot of programs for 64bits?
2006-09-26T06:53:00.000Z	writingdesk	zkorpio	Yeah, but no flash, and no wine ( unless chroot in 32 bit)
2006-09-26T06:54:00.000Z	zkorpio	writingdesk	do you know if there is any distro with fully support 64 bits (non chroot32)
