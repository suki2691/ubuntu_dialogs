2012-02-19T14:25:00.000Z	ServerTech		Okay I start Ubuntu 11.10 with live cd on my laptop which has a HDD with bad sectors. Any free program available like DD_rescue to try to recover the data on the HDD before I change it? I can't get to install dd_rescue, could you tell me how to install it? Or any other program?
