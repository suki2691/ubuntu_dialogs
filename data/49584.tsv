2009-08-27T21:53:00.000Z	Darksaviour69		I have installed the latest ubuntu 9.04 (64 bit), Works grant, but when I go to shut down, the pc restarts instead.  Have Xp on the same pc and it shuts down fine.  I did a little googleing and could not find any similar problems, if someone could point me in the right direction that would be great, thanks
