2007-07-05T16:56:00.000Z	QwertMan		I installed Ubuntu on a Vista machine (dual boot). I want to uninstall it, but won't that uninstall GRUB leaving no bootloader? How do I do this safely?
2007-07-05T05:00:00.000Z	QwertMan		Thanks
2007-07-05T05:00:00.000Z	QwertMan		Does anybody know of any other UBUNTU chat rooms? This one is too busy for me.
