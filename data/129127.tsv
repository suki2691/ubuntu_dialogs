2008-06-23T21:29:00.000Z	boris		someone tell me, is it possible to tell grub to boot an image ? for example opensuse dvd iso or something like that ?
2008-06-23T21:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	boris	 ive seen it done in specific cases.. but  it still takes some work. and not always doable for just 'any' iso file
2008-06-23T21:30:00.000Z	boris	Dr_Willis_	any howtos or tutorials ? i really dont have any dvds, and besides my comp even cant burn dvds
2008-06-23T21:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	boris	 not really.  some live cd disrtos have that sort of feature. If you want to install ubuntu without a cd.. thats possible from a thumbdrive
