2004-11-11T06:33:00.000Z	[Phaedrus] 	|trey|	it wouldnt be worth the hazzle to try to plug in a ISA card, you know
2004-11-11T06:35:00.000Z	[Phaedrus] 	|trey|	I already found the drivers for his card and posted it to him in PM, but that's going to require recompiling the kernel
2004-11-11T06:38:00.000Z	[Phaedrus] 	|trey|	I am sure it is possible to make it work... and i would guide him through it, if it was his computer... when its a friend's computer, it can get hard to sit there and let the compilation run for a few hours
