2007-12-04T01:46:00.000Z	Sharpie		general question - what's the difference between the 64 and 32bit versions of ubuntu? i've been working on 32bit ubuntu for over a month and i'm just wondering. and also, is 64bit ubuntu a pain in the butt like 64 bit windows (as in, horrible incompatible with loads of stuff)?

2007-12-04T01:46:00.000Z	Sharpie	blahdeblah	meaning that i should stick to 32bit? (i have a 64bit AMD proc.)
2007-12-04T01:47:00.000Z	blahdeblah	Sharpie	I'm running 64-bit Debian, and it's pretty much smooth sailing except for Flash and getting a working version of Lightning calendar for Thunderbird.  I pretty much love not having to put up with Flash ads in my browsing.
