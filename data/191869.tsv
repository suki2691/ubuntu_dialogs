2006-04-05T07:26:00.000Z	liddan	_jason	It is my computer I decide if I want to remove that file even if it is needed for the os to start..
2006-04-05T07:26:00.000Z	_jason	liddan	no, I agree with you.  I am just saying that the easiest way to do things is let apt take care of installing and removing stuff and just sticking to $HOME.  There are of course exceptions, but I don't think it's that often that you would need a shortcut on your desktop :)
