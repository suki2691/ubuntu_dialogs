2005-09-20T15:10:00.000Z	Determinist	henk	i've seen very strong nvidia cards failing with that thing. it's still buggy.
2005-09-20T15:11:00.000Z	Determinist	henk	but since nvidia still offer better drivers than ATI i'd say you should be alright with anything 6XXX
2005-09-20T15:11:00.000Z	Determinist	henk	definately nvidia 6XXX then
