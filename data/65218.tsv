2009-03-01T03:49:00.000Z	Plugh		I finally figured out how to get Ubuntu 6.06 booting reliably with my new computer. The auto notification thing is telling me that 8.0.4.1 is available. How safe is it for me to jump from 6.06 to 8.04.1?
2009-03-01T03:49:00.000Z	Plugh		I can (and will) backup the 6.06 partition before attempting the update. Last time I tried it, it didn't go so well but I had to do part of it manually.
2009-03-01T03:49:00.000Z	sprinkmeier_	Plugh	a lot safer than staying at 6.06 :-) try a live CD first to make sure HW is supported
2009-03-01T03:50:00.000Z	Plugh	sprinkmeier_	I have a partition with 8.04 and it boots. Due to how I managed to do the update from 6.06 the GUI is very unstable. With 6.06 booting properly, I'm hoping things will go more smoothly this time.
