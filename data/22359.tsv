2010-11-24T05:06:00.000Z	Uggie		I'm trying to fix my sound. The thread in ubuntu forums re: doing that suggests to completely remove the alsa drivers then reinstall them. For some that means it takes the Gnome Desktop with it, and it has to be reinstalled. My question is: Will this take things such as my evolution email with it? How much will I have to restore from backups?
