2011-08-03T07:26:00.000Z	itrebal		I installed Debian server, but for various reasons I need to switch to Ubuntu server. I'm successfully booting off of a ubuntu-server USB key, but it seems to just drop me back into the Debian bootloader. Is this common behavior? or is it likely I've messed something else up along the line? Also, how would I go about booting to the live-"CD"

2011-08-03T07:28:00.000Z	itrebal	wols_	of course, the problem is that GRUB is listing the Debian and Debian - Recovery boot options, and nothing for an Ubuntu installer. I've successfully put the server installer onto the USB stick and am booting to it currently.
