2006-12-14T09:24:00.000Z	datil		is 6.10 release actually working with Core 2 Duo motherboards?
2006-12-14T09:25:00.000Z	datil		i heard that standard i386 had problems with JMicron controller and probably ICH8
2006-12-14T09:25:00.000Z	HymnToLife	datil	if you want 64 bits support, which has little to no use atm
