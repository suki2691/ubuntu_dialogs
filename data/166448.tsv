2008-05-16T12:04:00.000Z	Pegasos989		Heya. I'm going to buy a new desk computer in a few days (custom built naturally) and was just wondering if there are any Ubuntu/Linux related driver issues. Such as any specific brands to avoid or favor in graphics card, sound card, etc.
2008-05-16T12:05:00.000Z	wols_	Pegasos989	intel or amd?
2008-05-16T12:07:00.000Z	Pegasos989	wols_	haven't quite decided yet. I know little about hardware so I concidered to just walking into shop and telling them about what kind of a computer (price, use, etc.) I want and let them help with the details. As such, it would be useful to know beforehand of any major issues...
