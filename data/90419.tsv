2008-05-17T20:02:00.000Z	favro		I get a message during boot - "nvidia liscence has tainted kernel" - what are the repercussions from this apart from poor performance?
2008-05-17T20:04:00.000Z	attila	favro	nvidia driver taints the kernel since its closed source
2008-05-17T20:06:00.000Z	favro	attila	I've never seen that line during boot before - that is the concern
2008-05-17T20:07:00.000Z	attila	favro	its completely normal, probably the previous versions didnt show it during the booting but it was there :)
