2011-01-19T02:37:00.000Z	Somelauw		Hi, I installed google chrome, but I heard it doesn't automatically update. Will ubuntu automatically give me updates when bugs are fixed?
2011-01-19T02:38:00.000Z	Somelauw		I installed it using the software centre
2011-01-19T02:38:00.000Z	Somelauw		But it says: Canonical does not provide updates for Chromium Web Browser. Some updates may be provided by the Ubuntu community.
2011-01-19T02:40:00.000Z	brontoeee	Somelauw	that only means that canonical takes no part in that specific project, repo will still work
