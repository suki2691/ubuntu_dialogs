2011-08-09T19:21:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion		the great thing about ubuntu linux is no damn viruses what so ever
2011-08-09T19:21:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion		I never had a virus on Linux which caused me to reinstall Ubuntu Linux
2011-08-09T19:22:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion		Windows is a different story, seems like every year I end up reinstalling Windows Vista for some odd reason, something always gets corrupted
2011-08-09T19:22:00.000Z	auronandace	Quantum_Ion	do you have a support question?
