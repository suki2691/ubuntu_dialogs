2007-07-16T07:59:00.000Z	mrsno	puppy-user-06so1	it worked automatically in 'xebian' livecd distro, not sure how it works auto
2007-07-16T07:59:00.000Z	mrsno	puppy-user-06so1	maybe the "xpad" module
2007-07-16T08:00:00.000Z	mrsno	puppy-user-06so1	after loading the module and replugging the controller in, check /var/log/messages
