2008-03-19T23:07:00.000Z	soon		Hi folks - I've used 4 different CDs to burn an ubuntu installation .iso now - they all die during boot: BOOT FAILURE INSERT BOOT DISK AND PRESS ENTER
2008-03-19T23:07:00.000Z	soon		However - If I use an installation CD from a magazine - no problem
2008-03-19T23:07:00.000Z	soon		I've used K3B to burn the cd's - any suggestions what could be wrong ?
2008-03-19T23:08:00.000Z	nikrud	soon	did you burn the isos as images, or data disks?
