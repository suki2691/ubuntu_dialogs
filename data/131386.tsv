2007-10-15T06:58:00.000Z	moquist		I've got a user with a projector hooked up to an external display on his laptop, and everything works great except that DVDs that get played are visible only on his laptop. Any suggestions?

2007-10-15T07:01:00.000Z	moquist	linenoise	that doesn't send the DVD signal; just everything else.
2007-10-15T07:01:00.000Z	moquist	linenoise	I haven't messed with it enough to get the image ONLY displaying on the external display; I suspect/hope that may work. But surely there's a way to display all the video internally AND externally...
