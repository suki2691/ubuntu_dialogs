2010-12-28T20:59:00.000Z	jose	KayAteChef	yes thats what I use
2010-12-28T21:01:00.000Z	jose	KayAteChef	I've not had any trouble with it, occasional I've had to install the a 32bit program but for the most part its great
2010-12-28T21:03:00.000Z	jose	KayAteChef	yep if you install the 32bit libs then you have no issues with the AMD64.
