2006-12-04T13:47:00.000Z	timephoenix		just installed Mandriva to dual-boot with Breezy, but it took over my GRUB. I entered and identical entry into the new menu.lst, i can boot but the graphical login does not start by default.
2006-12-04T13:48:00.000Z	timephoenix		how do i get graphical login starting automatically again?
