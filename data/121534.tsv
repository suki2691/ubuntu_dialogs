2010-05-03T22:57:00.000Z	Shapeshifter		Uhm, guys. I'm feeling stupid. I don't see how I can shut down this thing from the GUI. sure reboot works as root but I only see this "log out user" applet in the bar and there I can only log out or switch users. but not shut down
2010-05-03T22:57:00.000Z	doleyb	Shapeshifter	can you get back to the main gdm login screen, and then click a shutdown icon in the corner?
2010-05-03T22:57:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	doleyb	I don't want to use gdm
2010-05-03T22:57:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	doleyb	or rather, I don't want to see it. I use autologin
