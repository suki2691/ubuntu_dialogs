2012-06-08T07:20:00.000Z	Darkenvy		I would be glad to announce I am now running ubuntu server 10.04. How can I now install mysql?
2012-06-08T07:21:00.000Z	Darkenvy		"apt-get install mysql mysql-server" returns packages not found
2012-06-08T07:22:00.000Z	Darkenvy		thanks
2012-06-08T07:22:00.000Z	Madpilot	Darkenvy	np, I haven't set up a server in several versions of Ubuntu but that page should still be pretty comprehensive
