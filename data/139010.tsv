2007-04-17T09:43:00.000Z	SnoopyTwo	graywhite	  I think that htpasswd will just creat the hash
2007-04-17T09:44:00.000Z	graywhite	SnoopyTwo	what do you mean?
2007-04-17T09:45:00.000Z	SnoopyTwo	graywhite	   I do not have htpasswd on my system but I think that it's typically used to creats a password hash.... (crypt)
