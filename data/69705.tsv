2012-02-28T12:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	cas	I just run a script when I want to be static http://paste.ubuntu.com/860195/  but I'm sure there are other better ways
2012-02-28T12:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	cas	for a permanent change maybe look at something like this http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-networking-3/static-ip-under-ubuntu-11-10-a-918165/
