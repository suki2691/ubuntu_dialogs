2008-10-27T03:42:00.000Z	TANATHOS	Zerothis	that why we like linux, there is now proper way there is only your way
2008-10-27T03:45:00.000Z	Zerothis	TANATHOS	Yes, that does have its appeal. But I like some of the things I configure to work for anyone else who wants to use it, without having to explain it. For instance, if someone adds a user to the church computer, that 30 people use, I want a "Public Documents" folder link to automatically be created on the desktop.
