2010-08-02T05:01:00.000Z	texastwister		Having trouble with an "alternate" install of Xubuntu 10.04 on a very old PC.  After going through the entire install, I get "error: unknown filesystem." and a grub rescue prompt.  Current partitioning is /dev/sda1 = 300 MB, bootable, ext3 (or 4) mounted at /boot, /dev/sda2 = 3G swap, /dev/sda3 = 70+GB ext4 mounted at /. Grub installed to /dev/sda.

2010-08-02T05:03:00.000Z	texastwister	YankDownUnder	CD was used to install flawlessly on another system yesterday.  Drive was fully repartitioned and reformated, is there something else you recommend?
2010-08-02T05:04:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	texastwister	The reader. The CDROM drive itself. More than a few times I've run into the same crap, only to find that the CDROM drive itself was cactus and needed cleaning...after cleaning, installation went heaps better...just a thought
