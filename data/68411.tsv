2009-01-21T23:06:00.000Z	jlaeret		hello, I have a problem with my thinkpad x61 tablet after I upgraded from hardy to intrepid. My wireless doesn't work anymore. There is no icon or anything. Does anyone know anything I can try?

2009-01-21T23:08:00.000Z	jlaeret	Silverwing	thank you, I tried it but no icon appeared. Nothing changed. :S
2009-01-21T23:08:00.000Z	Silverwing	jlaeret	I don't know how to fix it either then, sorry
