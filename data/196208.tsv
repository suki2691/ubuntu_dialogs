2010-02-04T02:46:00.000Z	goose		I have a program on my server that I want to automagically be restarted in the event that it ever crashes. I was told "watchdog" would be a good idea, but I can't find much documentation on it. Can anyone point me in the right direction?

Some people have also mentioned cron, but imo, that'd be bad on the processor to set a cron job for every minute to relaunch the PID
