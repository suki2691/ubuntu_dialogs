2010-05-04T02:06:00.000Z	StuckMojo	funkyHat	thanks
2010-05-04T02:09:00.000Z	StuckMojo	funkyHat	odd, it finds a slightly different list
2010-05-04T02:10:00.000Z	funkyHat	StuckMojo	it's possible it uses a different method. I'm quite lazy and don't really worry too much about having a few extra packages on my system so I haven't really investigated computer-janitor
