2007-06-10T07:20:00.000Z	tanlaan		Anyone know of a good Torrent downloader that I could go download and just continue to seed the torrents I just downloaded *very confused on how bittorrent works under linux*
2007-06-10T07:20:00.000Z	killercow	tanlaan	 opera? or ktorrent?
2007-06-10T07:20:00.000Z	killercow	tanlaan	just leave the current gnome torrent window open and it will keep seeding
2007-06-10T07:21:00.000Z	tanlaan	killercow	Wait, So it does continue to seed? Even though it continues to say "downloading" instead of uploading?
