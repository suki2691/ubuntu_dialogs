2007-11-28T19:16:00.000Z	Mouldy		in other news; hey all. Why does cd-ing to the right directory then doing "wine gta-sa.exe" works fine, but doing  wine "/media/E/Program Files/Games/San andreas/GTA San Andreas/gta_sa.exe" doesn't?
2007-11-28T19:16:00.000Z	jrib	Mouldy	what happens when you try?
2007-11-28T19:18:00.000Z	Mouldy	jrib	it looks like wine is trying to start it, but it crashes out because some sort of sound error. But it'll do it fine if I first cd to the dir and then run it with wine
