I am trying to get ubuntu 10.04 working with VMware i am running into the issue with the keyboard not working at login.  I read that i could "run: sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup" i am just not sure how to run it without being logged in.  Any suggestions   "sorry i know its probably a very stupid question"
