2008-08-08T06:13:00.000Z	Flynsarmy		Hi. in update manager i have an update called 'virtualbox-ose-modules-generic' that has a disabled checkbox. It never downloads and installs with other updates. Why?

2008-08-08T06:15:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	qr	Why does it appear in the list at all if the repository isn't enabled?
2008-08-08T06:16:00.000Z	qr	Flynsarmy	I have no idea
