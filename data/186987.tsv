2008-01-02T18:46:00.000Z	fkling		hi, I just bought a LCD monitor (LG Flatron 227) and I don't know how to get the "real" solution 1680*1050, I found some hints with setting the modeline manually but I don't know which modeline I need...
2008-01-02T18:48:00.000Z	fkling		some LCD monitor installation experts here? :)
2008-01-02T18:49:00.000Z	ikonia	fkling	if you just ask the question people will help if they can
2008-01-02T18:50:00.000Z	ikonia	fkling	I didn't see it, I can respond to a question if I know, but I can't repond to "any lcd experts"
