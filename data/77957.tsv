2009-06-13T11:03:00.000Z	theyeti		Okay so this one has me stumped.  I have firefox 3.0 and the firefox 3.5 beta both installed.   Flash works perfectly fine in the 3.5 beta but 3.0 doesn't recognize that I have the plugin installed.   Anyone have any idea why?

2009-06-13T11:05:00.000Z	RHorse	theyeti	have the default plugin folders changed?
