2008-05-11T22:11:00.000Z	Dougi2		Hi I'm trying to install gnome on ubuntu-server edition and its telling me a package gnome-keyring-manager isn't available or something
2008-05-11T22:12:00.000Z	heymr	Dougi2	why would you want xorg for server.....
2008-05-11T22:14:00.000Z	Dougi2	heymr	because for right now I'm just better with it. It's been a while since I used linux and I have to get used to it again and I don't use it on my desktop so I'm not super familiar with command line anymore
2008-05-11T22:14:00.000Z	heymr	Dougi2	oh ok :)
