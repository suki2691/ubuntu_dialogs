2012-06-29T06:34:00.000Z	c2tarun		I have a problem in understanding a line in PHP, can anyone please help me here or tell me about some PHP channel?
2012-06-29T06:35:00.000Z	c2tarun		$file=fopen("welcome.txt","r") or exit("Unable to open file!");   what does this line do? though it is self explanatory but technically how is or keyword used?
