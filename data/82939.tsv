2008-08-13T20:43:00.000Z	RainCT	chieffancypants	System -> Administration -> System Monitor
2008-08-13T20:44:00.000Z	chieffancypants	RainCT	Thanks.  It didn't show up in ps aux for some reason
2008-08-13T20:44:00.000Z	RainCT	chieffancypants	You're welcome. If the application is visible you can also do Alt + F2 -> "xkill" and then click on it
