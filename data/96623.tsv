2009-08-07T23:50:00.000Z	Strife89	bc_	No, not in 9.04 at least.
2009-08-07T23:51:00.000Z	Strife89	bc_	On the other hand, I've never run a virtual machine for more than about half an hour...
2009-08-07T23:54:00.000Z	bc_	Strife89	that's the problem. I don't run it continuously. About once every couple of weeks when I start a VM, the machine reboots.
