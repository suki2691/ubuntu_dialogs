2011-12-06T20:56:00.000Z	jason00	RaTTuS|BIG	ahhh! .img! That's what it was. I had forgotten what it was when I read about it a few weeks ago.
2011-12-06T21:01:00.000Z	jason00	RaTTuS|BIG	I don't really want speed or anything. I just want to ensure what I have in the .img is identical to the sd card contents. Would the standard if=/dev/sdb of=/home/user/disk.img do the job?
