2007-06-14T15:00:00.000Z	teamwork	OmegaCenti	i was telling iulian that creating a deb from source is easier to maintain than installing directly from source.  now iulian would like to know how to create a deb from source.
2007-06-14T15:01:00.000Z	OmegaCenti	teamwork	ah, why does he want to create anything from source in the first place, just curious (I knoe some things are not in repositories therefore need to be built)
2007-06-14T15:03:00.000Z	teamwork	OmegaCenti	the thing compiled was libmxml2.  there's a new version, so iulian wants to know how to make the new version's sources into a deb.
