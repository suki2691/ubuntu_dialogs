2009-11-21T11:27:00.000Z	DexterLB		so, I can't open the new PC to insert the HDD into it, warranty forbids doing any enhansmets etc. So I have to migrate the entire /home with all .dot files into the new computer via network. Which is the best way of transferring files through network THAT KEEPS SYMLINKS AS THEY ARE, DOESN'T FOLLOW NOR CHANGE THEM
