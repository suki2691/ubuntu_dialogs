2009-09-23T11:17:00.000Z	krejustin1979		on ubuntu?
2009-09-23T11:17:00.000Z	hajmola	krejustin1979	are you talking about creating a bootable USB or actually booting from a USB drive?
2009-09-23T11:19:00.000Z	hajmola	krejustin1979	that's not something "ubuntu" does. When you reboot your computer, there should be options upon startup that tell you to press a certain key for boot options
