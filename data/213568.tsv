2005-12-27T14:23:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	foxpaul	There's an extra package for WPA, but yes.
2005-12-27T14:23:00.000Z	foxpaul	tonyyarusso	do you know what the package is? and do you still use the gnome network gui to config it?
2005-12-27T14:24:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	foxpaul	cdubya's package, not sure about the configuration, but probably yes.
