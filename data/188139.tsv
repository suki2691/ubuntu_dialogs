2006-11-07T09:18:00.000Z	hastesaver		Great, I already have /home in a separate partition... thanks

2006-11-07T09:20:00.000Z	hastesaver	dcraven	let's hope so. Anyway, I'm already using a home directory that I keep rsynced across three computers, one of them Dapper and two of them different releases of Debian... no problems yet :-)
