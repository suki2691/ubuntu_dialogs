2009-01-30T23:59:00.000Z	thedark		I have moved to a foreign country from the US, and now I have a DVD collection composed of both Region 1 and Region 3 DVDs... is there a way around the 5 region change limit?

2009-01-31T00:02:00.000Z	ikonia	thedark	yes and no - but basiclly getting around region encoding is not really a topic for here
