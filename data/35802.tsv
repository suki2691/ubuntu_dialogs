2010-03-19T07:45:00.000Z	CoCo_Kid594		is there a better video card driver for ATI Rage.. that could fix the screen resolution?
2010-03-19T07:46:00.000Z	fr3nzy	CoCo_Kid594	what exactly is the problem, drivers or just setting a constant resolution?
2010-03-19T07:46:00.000Z	fr3nzy	CoCo_Kid594	you're using the default drivers or have you tried downloading the official ones? I'm no expert with ATI though.
