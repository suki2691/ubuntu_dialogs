2007-04-30T13:40:00.000Z	ibbuntu		hi, just tried to install swiftfox (32-bit) using automatix2. I am on Feisty and AMD64 and I think I've done something silly at some point as I get this error message: ./swiftfox-bin: error while loading shared libraries: libfreetype.so.6: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64
2007-04-30T13:41:00.000Z	ibbuntu		ok, I don't think my problem is related to automatix though
2007-04-30T13:41:00.000Z	sanityx	ibbuntu	Oh it most certainly is :-D
2007-04-30T13:42:00.000Z	sanityx	ibbuntu	Yeah Autmatix = poo
