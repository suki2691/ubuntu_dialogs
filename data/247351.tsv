2005-02-24T09:56:00.000Z	Gul3		hello, probably just another newbie question from me, but how do i execute "format c:" in linux?
2005-02-24T09:57:00.000Z	Dull404	Gul3	use fdisk... if there is fdisk.. dont know just installed myself ;)
2005-02-24T09:57:00.000Z	Gul3	Dull404	that will not format the partition
2005-02-24T09:58:00.000Z	Dull404	Gul3	delete the partition, and create it again ;)
