2011-11-12T15:06:00.000Z	llutz_	pneftali	if you want a newer version as in the repos, look for a ppa or build it yourself
2011-11-12T15:08:00.000Z	llutz_	pneftali	sudo apt-get update && apt-cache policy filezilla       shows you the versions available
2011-11-12T15:10:00.000Z	llutz_	pneftali	then you have to look for backports. the oneiric-one will hardly work on lucid (check the dpends)
