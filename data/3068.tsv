2012-05-15T08:23:00.000Z	iSplicer		Hey all, hope you're all doing great. Just a quick question: I'm running a server with lxde installed and it's all going great =]. However, I'd like to add a hard drive - can I just plug it in and have it detected by fdisk?
2012-05-15T08:23:00.000Z	iSplicer		or do I have to reboot?
2012-05-15T08:24:00.000Z	iSplicer		Thanks for your response, hp_neo. I'm using lubuntu, actually
2012-05-15T08:24:00.000Z	beefknuckle	iSplicer	maybe it's like plugging in a flash drive, just plug in and boom goes the dynamite
