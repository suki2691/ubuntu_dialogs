2006-11-04T10:36:00.000Z	mm2000		hello. I have just installed ubuntu 6.06 :) One thing though... I cannot install amsn, synaptics doesnt list that app... guess this has something to do with apt-sources.list?
2006-11-04T10:36:00.000Z	mm2000		ideas?
2006-11-04T10:37:00.000Z	Tompu	mm2000	try apt-get install amsn
