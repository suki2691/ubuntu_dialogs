2008-05-09T01:10:00.000Z	Zigara		hello, i'm wondering if theres a faster repo for the update manager.. the current one is only giving me 40kb/s
2008-05-09T01:10:00.000Z	Kohlrak	Zigara	everyone's complained about that lately, some servers even have horrible ping
2008-05-09T01:11:00.000Z	Zigara	Kohlrak	so basically we just gotta wait for the servers to get fixed?
2008-05-09T01:12:00.000Z	Kohlrak	Zigara	if they get fixed. Could be budget cuts. I really don't know what's going on.
