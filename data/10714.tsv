2011-08-10T01:50:00.000Z	vikingur	ObrienDave	in my experience the easiest way to boot ubuntu from a usb drive is to install grub to the mbr *of the usb drive*
2011-08-10T01:51:00.000Z	vikingur	ObrienDave	installing it to the mbr of your local disk would make booting from the usb drive a lot more difficult
2011-08-10T01:51:00.000Z	vikingur	ObrienDave	you don't need to overwrite the whole drive to install grub to its mbr
2011-08-10T01:53:00.000Z	ObrienDave	vikingur	that's what I thought. will try it again. tnx for the help
