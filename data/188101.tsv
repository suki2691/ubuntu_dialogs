2006-05-25T07:28:00.000Z	WarOfAttrition		I think fluxbox is smaller as far as guis go
2006-05-25T07:29:00.000Z	WarOfAttrition		I dont recommend xubuntu, it's better to get ubuntu or kubuntu and install xfce from scratch
2006-05-25T07:30:00.000Z	hastesaver	WarOfAttrition	that's the only way of doing it :)
