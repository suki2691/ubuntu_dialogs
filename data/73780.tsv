2010-02-18T22:46:00.000Z	hcook		hello. is there an op around here that could unban my (other) IP? at 17:38GMT you can see that I (yaaar) did a shebang-es piped to a user to inform them of the spanish ubuntu channel. then i was immediately banned for "spamming" ...so i had to go to another computer on a different ip and login with my other name. the banned ip is 74.118.8.219 (cisco-501.tranquility.net) and any help there...
2010-02-18T22:46:00.000Z	hcook		...would be much appreciated. i'm really not a spammer!
