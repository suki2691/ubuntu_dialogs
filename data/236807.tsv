2005-10-14T15:45:00.000Z	spider_		i'm looking to make an .iso image on my hard drive, but don't know where to start
2005-10-14T15:46:00.000Z	spider_		i don't want to have to re-d/l the file to do it, since i have a cd with it burned on it already
2005-10-14T15:47:00.000Z	spider_		anyone know how to turn a cd into an .iso on the hard drive?  a file?
