2009-03-07T00:44:00.000Z	tdn		I have some files with filenames in some strange encoding. Is there a program that can "guess" which encoding it is? I want to convmv them to utf8.
2009-03-07T00:46:00.000Z	vega	tdn	"file" might say something about it
2009-03-07T00:46:00.000Z	tdn	vega	nope. File only tells me about the *contents* of a file. I am talking about the file names.
2009-03-07T00:46:00.000Z	vega	tdn	ah
