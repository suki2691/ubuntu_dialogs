2008-02-29T05:05:00.000Z	Slart	fentontravers	it's usually open.. you have to have something listening on the other side though
2008-02-29T05:06:00.000Z	Slart	fentontravers	you might have to tell it specifically to listen on the external network interface.. you have to do that with ssh and apache for example
