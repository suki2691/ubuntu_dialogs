2006-06-03T10:29:00.000Z	ryuku		I installed Ubuntu 6.06 successfully last night, but the supplied 2.6.15-23-server SMP kernel will not boot...  tried to just drop in the installers kernel and that doesn't work.  Where can I get a kernel which will boot my VIA C3 piece of crap? I'm sitting in rescue mode right now...

2006-06-03T10:30:00.000Z	pmjdebruijn	ryuku	stick with 386
2006-06-03T10:30:00.000Z	ryuku	pmjdebruijn	i don't believe i had a choice.
