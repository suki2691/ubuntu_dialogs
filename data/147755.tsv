2008-11-29T21:00:00.000Z	nicolah		(I'm trying to understand why I can't hear no sound from my mic)
2008-11-29T21:01:00.000Z	Xyc0	nicolah	did you try alsamixer
2008-11-29T21:01:00.000Z	nicolah	Xyc0	sure, but alsamixer just controls pulse and I have problems with the mic of the usb plugged webcam. btw I'd like to understand why there's a mic volume slide in the playback section
