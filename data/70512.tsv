2009-02-11T20:22:00.000Z	beehemoth		mine issue is simple: 1) i need to unplug/plug my usb headphones, 2) i need to run asoundconf-gtk and select headphones and 3) everyone should solve mine problem as a priority. I mean, is that really to much to ask... :)
2009-02-11T20:23:00.000Z	beehemoth		Or do I need to join the queue of people who want their problem solved as a priority?
