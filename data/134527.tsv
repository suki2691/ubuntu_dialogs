2007-05-12T15:31:00.000Z	bayziders		I really don't know where to ask this question so I will ask here =/. Can you mount an hdd in  a 5.25" drive bay?
2007-05-12T15:32:00.000Z	knoeki	bayziders	well, you could, but it wouldn't fit well, as a HDD is much smaller...
2007-05-12T15:33:00.000Z	bayziders	knoeki	Yeah but my cases one 3.5 is full and I heard it was possible I just wanted to make sure.
2007-05-12T15:34:00.000Z	knoeki	bayziders	it is possible, you have special extentions that you put the HDD in and then you put that into the 5.25" bay..
