2010-09-28T22:12:00.000Z	istevenmon		hi guys, how is the best way to know if i have lost connectivity to the internet? i need something to monitor 24/7 or if the link has gone down
2010-09-28T22:14:00.000Z	jcrawford	istevenmon	yes as st__ said write a script that pings google every hour or so and logs when the connection is down
2010-09-28T22:15:00.000Z	istevenmon	jcrawford	well yes, i just want to know for my box because it will force to switch my isp since i have two connections but the 1 hour gap is too long
