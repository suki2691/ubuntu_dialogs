2010-01-06T12:37:00.000Z	BlackCow		so i updated from 9.04 to 9.10, it totally borked my install, when i try to boot it up it says something about a mountall errror terminated with status 127
2010-01-06T12:37:00.000Z	BlackCow		anyone else run into that problem? I searched forums and people just said to reformat
2010-01-06T12:38:00.000Z	uncmar	BlackCow	ouch, I would try to recover any data I could before a reformat.
2010-01-06T12:40:00.000Z	uncmar	BlackCow	oh, well, I never have.  I had too many problems with Windows upgrades in the past.
