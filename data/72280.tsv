2008-12-03T01:11:00.000Z	uberadm		I'm looking to install kubuntu on my 1.4ghz (celeron) with 256 mb of ram (I know its bad)... do you think it will be ok?
2008-12-03T01:13:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	uberadm	You wont get performance at 256 especially if you are sharing ram for the video card
2008-12-03T01:15:00.000Z	uberadm	Jack_Sparrow	Okay, is there a stripped down version of ubuntu available?
2008-12-03T01:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	uberadm	yes, several..
