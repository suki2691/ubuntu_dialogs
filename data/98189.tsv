2008-05-08T02:46:00.000Z	ChrisC35		I have a question about hwo Ubuntu works compared to Vista. I just got a new laptop with Vista - created a non admin user for my wife, but it prompts for admin password so much, its basically unusable (it wont even allow her to delete a desktop shortcut). How does Ubuntu do this kind of thing?
