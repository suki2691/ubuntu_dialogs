2009-11-12T06:11:00.000Z	SunlessHalo		please, any simple way how to convert flv or mp4 youtube-downloaded videos into MP3 with custom (possibly high) bitrate?
2009-11-12T06:13:00.000Z	SunlessHalo		i have tried elltube, which is actually sweet and hilarious, but it converts into 64KiB/s MP3s...
2009-11-12T06:13:00.000Z	SunlessHalo		and the most widespread videoDownloadHelper doesn't work for me
