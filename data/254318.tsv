2005-02-01T15:26:00.000Z	carsonc		Is there a program for Linux (preferably packaged for Ubuntu) that will let me rotate my desktop backgrounds automatically, the way I can do in OS X?  I've apt-cache search'd and googled, but I can't find anything relevant.  Am I just missing it, or does such a program not exist?
