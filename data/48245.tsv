2012-05-16T17:54:00.000Z	Cyonx		May be an odd question for this channel, but I honestly like unity, and I don't understand why it gets such a bad reputation. 12.04 is the first time I've used it however, was it really bad in 11.10? Have I just not run into it's problems yet? I'm honestly curious.

2012-05-16T17:59:00.000Z	OerHeks	Cyonx	unity runs under Gnome3
