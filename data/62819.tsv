2009-03-25T17:07:00.000Z	tomorama		last night i got my sound set up and working. just woke up, tried to play a track, and sound no longer works. volume is up, nothing's muted, settings are all the same. what could be wrong?
2009-03-25T17:07:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	tomorama	probably pulseaudio
2009-03-25T17:08:00.000Z	tomorama	remoteCTRL1	what do you mean? pulseaudio has changed some of my settings? i already rebooted.
2009-03-25T17:09:00.000Z	remoteCTRL1	tomorama	not pulseaudio then...
