2005-10-25T14:03:00.000Z	warreng		so i just installed ubuntu... so far, i love it... one thing that bugs me is it seems like the fonts aren't quite right... like web pages just don't look nearly as good as in windows (both using firefox).... any suggestions?

2005-10-25T14:05:00.000Z	mahangu	warreng	you need to get windows fonts
2005-10-25T14:06:00.000Z	mahangu	warreng	to me though pages look far better on linux than windows
