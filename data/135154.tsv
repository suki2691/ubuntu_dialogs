2007-11-17T20:25:00.000Z	sn0w		i need some help, i am getting "403 Forbidden" when trying to just do the system update
2007-11-17T20:25:00.000Z	sn0w		so now it just constantly says i need to update but the update fails everytime
2007-11-17T20:26:00.000Z	siloko	sn0w	thats a problem with a current samba package - just wait a while (maybe a day r two) before the package is properly made avauilable for update
2007-11-17T20:26:00.000Z	sn0w	siloko	ok thanks
