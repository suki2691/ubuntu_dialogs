2009-06-10T11:20:00.000Z	andruk	gangs20003	one of hte major ways linux is better for software development is that you can easily find and download the source code for nearly every piece of software you run on linux.

2009-06-10T11:21:00.000Z	andruk	gangs20003	but if you arent a programmer, it is still a viable alternative to windows if thats what youre looking for
