2009-09-28T21:44:00.000Z	fccf	ChrizC	you want an open rectangle frame ... select a rectangle, de-select a rectangle inside of it and fill
2009-09-28T21:47:00.000Z	ChrizC	fccf	and dbugger; I've figured it out, just select a rectangular area, then go to selection editor, then go to "paint along the selection outline" and then do that xD
2009-09-28T21:48:00.000Z	fccf	ChrizC	that's one way to do it
