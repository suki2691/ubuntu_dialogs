2010-04-20T11:40:00.000Z	SandGorgon		does anybody know if /etc/syslog.conf is even used ?
2010-04-20T11:42:00.000Z	blkperl	SandGorgon	the sysadmins at my school use /etc/syslog.conf
2010-04-20T11:45:00.000Z	SandGorgon	blkperl	looks like 9.10 onwards, it has been changed to rsyslog.d/*.conf
2010-04-20T11:45:00.000Z	blkperl	SandGorgon	well they havn't updated to 9.10 yet so that makes sense
