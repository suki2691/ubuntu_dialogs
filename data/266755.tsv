2009-11-13T21:54:00.000Z	carpunky_		I am doing a fresh install again...it asks  The Installer has detected that the following disks have partitions mounted....Do you want the intaller to try and unmount the partitions..Yes or No
2009-11-13T21:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	carpunky_	 you want to install to those partitions? if so unmount them
2009-11-13T21:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	carpunky_	 if the disks are empty.. then  go for it..
2009-11-13T21:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	carpunky_	 the installer wants them unmounted so it can do its work on them. Logical.
