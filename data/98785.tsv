2009-09-06T16:23:00.000Z	smn_		the error names a codepage... what is that?
2009-09-06T16:23:00.000Z	smn_		maybe i dont got some files i need?
2009-09-06T16:25:00.000Z	legend2440	smn_	in terminal type   file <nameofiso>.iso  it should return   ISO 9660 CD-ROM filesystem data  if it says  data or something else its probably corrupted
2009-09-06T16:27:00.000Z	legend2440	smn_	then something went wrong during conversion from nrg
