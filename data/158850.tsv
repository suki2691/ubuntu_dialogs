2008-01-12T08:34:00.000Z	jbinder		I'm trying to install Ubuntu on my Macbook pro with an nvidia geforce 8600M GT.. and it sits there all black for a few minutes and then goes into safe graphics mode, and then freezes.
2008-01-12T08:34:00.000Z	jbinder		What should I do?
2008-01-12T08:35:00.000Z	Kevin`	jbinder	i'd just use the alternate install. not worth messing with it just to make the livecd work
2008-01-12T08:36:00.000Z	jbinder	Kevin`	Does the alternate CD have a partition manager?
