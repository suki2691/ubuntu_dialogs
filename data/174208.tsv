2006-07-20T13:38:00.000Z	aqau_inter_fly	King	 Some distros do work with NTFS
2006-07-20T13:44:00.000Z	aqau_inter_fly	King	 are you trying to be able to read NTFS from linux or are you trying to write to it?
2006-07-20T13:46:00.000Z	aqau_inter_fly	King	 well never mind...mepis could only read ntfs, it couldn't write to it.
