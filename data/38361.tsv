2010-01-31T05:54:00.000Z	The-Compiler		Hey, I got a netbook, and since yesterday it suddenly turns off (like if you press the power buttons for several secs, or like if you'd take out the battery) and I hear the HDD spinning down (or so)... Any idea of a log I could search in?

2010-01-31T05:57:00.000Z	archboxman	The-Compiler	checks the hard drive status...
