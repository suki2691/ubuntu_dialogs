2008-10-16T08:06:00.000Z	kyrksaeterora_		is there anybody here who has like fifteen minutes of their time to help me out with getting my wireless card working under kubuntu 8.04?
2008-10-16T08:06:00.000Z	PMT	kyrksaeterora_	ask your question and the room will answer. :)
2008-10-16T08:07:00.000Z	PMT	kyrksaeterora_	ndisgtk is the GUI thing, I believe.
2008-10-16T08:08:00.000Z	PMT	kyrksaeterora_	yeah, ndisgtk. Install it and run it, and it'll walk you through everything but finding the Windows driver for your card. :)
