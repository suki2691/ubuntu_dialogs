2012-06-25T22:44:00.000Z	basz		hi how do i install https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/poco? I think I need to add a ppa ? but what ppa code would do that? "sudo add-apt-repository ppa:someppa/ppa"
2012-06-25T22:45:00.000Z	basz		what would I use for someppa/ppa if I want that poco library?
2012-06-25T22:45:00.000Z	basz		or where can I find it?
2012-06-25T22:47:00.000Z	glitsj16	basz	those are in the regular repositories, no need for a ppa
