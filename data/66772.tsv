2009-02-07T21:32:00.000Z	makito249		I have some questions about email setup. Right now I use evolution, but I want to set up a more unixy email setup. Most places recommend procmail, but I am not running a server?

2009-02-07T21:34:00.000Z	OldMonk	makito249	if you're on a pop3/imap account, fetchmail
2009-02-07T21:35:00.000Z	OldMonk	makito249	you need at least fetchmail
