2011-10-15T07:51:00.000Z	Hordeking	robin0800	It certainly doesn't give me the option to ignore it.
2011-10-15T07:52:00.000Z	robin0800	Hordeking	well what does it say?
2011-10-15T07:53:00.000Z	Hordeking	robin0800	Well, I'd have to try to run the installer again, but it said something to the effect of couldn't find, or run, some preconfig scripts somewhere. And gave me the option to quit. Not much of an option, since that's all I could do.
