2008-06-24T22:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	n00bs_r_ppl_too	 It isnt slow unless it is not configured correctly.. but slow is also relative.. slow compared to what
2008-06-24T22:50:00.000Z	n00bs_r_ppl_too	Jack_Sparrow	slow compared to windows xp :P
2008-06-24T22:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	n00bs_r_ppl_too	turn off compiz effects and see if that helps..
