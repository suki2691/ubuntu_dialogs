2006-07-01T05:38:00.000Z	howy424		Hi, I've just done my first ubuntu install, I did it on a brand new 80GB HD with two partitions, but it created it's own partition, which is only 3GB and too small by the looks of things
2006-07-01T05:40:00.000Z	howy424		no, the two partitions I created on the new drive were done in Win XP, one a 30GB FAT32 and another 50GB ntfs...
2006-07-01T05:40:00.000Z	howy424		it didn't seem to recognise the FAT 32 drive, so I told it just use all the NTFS partition
2006-07-01T05:40:00.000Z	ompaul	howy424	don't try to write to ntfs
