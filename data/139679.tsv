2009-08-14T20:22:00.000Z	m4t		hey, is there a preferred (recommended) way to get gcc 4.4.0 going in jaunty, for a 2.6.30 compile?
2009-08-14T20:23:00.000Z	m4t		just use the karmic package, or...?
2009-08-14T20:23:00.000Z	xlq	m4t	if you have a need for an unstable compiler then surely you can figure out how to compile it :)
2009-08-14T20:24:00.000Z	m4t	xlq	heh, my methods/means are not necessarily the preferred/correct route, hence my question
