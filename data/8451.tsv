With 11.10, it locks up when it tries to get into the livecd interface and present me with the rest of the GUI. It just sits at the purpleish desktop background as if its waiting to load. But then the CD goes quiet and nothing happens. I managed to install it earlier and it's doing the same thing when installed as it is on the livecd.
2011-10-22T04:34:00.000Z	lSEANl	Roasted	try the alternate installer
2011-10-22T04:34:00.000Z	Roasted	lSEANl	I installed it already, took 4 tries, but even the install does the same thing.
2011-10-22T04:35:00.000Z	Roasted	lSEANl	I just came back to the live CD to try. 10.04 works great, but 11.10 locks up like this. mouse can move, but nothing is there.
