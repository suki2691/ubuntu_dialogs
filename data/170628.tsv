2006-08-17T10:10:00.000Z	KroniX		Hey is it possible to not reformat the root filesystem when doing an install from the livecd?
2006-08-17T10:10:00.000Z	Warbo	KroniX	I think so (there is a box on the right of each partition "Format" "Do Not Format")
2006-08-17T10:11:00.000Z	KroniX	Warbo	Yeah but it forces me to do it
2006-08-17T10:11:00.000Z	KroniX	Warbo	it says it's required that the root filesystem be formatted, the only problem is the root filesystem has about 70 gigs of backup that can't be moved onto an external disk for another week
