2008-04-25T16:14:00.000Z	DracoZA	flithm	tried nvidia-settings in a terminal ?
2008-04-25T16:15:00.000Z	flithm	DracoZA	it's not installed :)  so what's the deal, the last ubuntu version automatically detected my nvidia card and gave me compiz and stuff, but not 8.04?
2008-04-25T16:15:00.000Z	DracoZA	flithm	I'm installing as we speak so I cant tell you yet :)
