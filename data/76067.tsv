2008-10-30T23:59:00.000Z	psusi	Thayle	I prefer 64 bit myself, but 32 bit will use 4 gb of ram just fine
2008-10-30T23:59:00.000Z	Thayle	psusi	Well my laptop has 4gb but apparently it can be upgraded to 8gb, so if I decide to do that it would be better to have 64-bit right?
2008-10-31T00:00:00.000Z	psusi	Thayle	not really... unless you want one process to be able to use more than 3gb, like if you are going to be editing 5 gig image files ;)
