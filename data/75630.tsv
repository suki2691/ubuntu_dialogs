2011-03-18T20:23:00.000Z	Chubbz		Question: I was using dd to copy a partition from one drive to another. What I didn't realize is that I should have made the partitions the exact same size. Now I have a 500 GB drive that thinks it only has a 250 gb partition on it and nothing else. Is there a way to fix this without recopying the data?

2011-03-18T20:24:00.000Z	Chubbz	ruan	Yeah, that's what I thought, just make it the same size as the original one with gparted?
