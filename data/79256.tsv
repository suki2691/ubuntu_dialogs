2008-09-15T17:30:00.000Z	zomak		I'm using latest stable version with KDE4.1 with it. the problem is xv is not working correctly with my radeon mobility 9600 driver. All i get is blue screen in video
2008-09-15T17:30:00.000Z	zomak		any idea how to solve it
2008-09-15T17:31:00.000Z	juan-intrepid	zomak	not sure if its alive but #kubuntu-kde4 is more likely to help if its a kde4 problem
2008-09-15T17:31:00.000Z	zomak	juan-intrepid	this seems to be more like generic ubuntu issue with xv and fglrx with it
