2009-10-05T08:26:00.000Z	enjo13		Hey.. I'm befuddled by something. I have a particular domain that I can't connect to. It doesn't matter what network I'm on.. it never works (hasn't for more than a week)
2009-10-05T08:26:00.000Z	enjo13		I can resolve it from my iPhone connected to the same Wifi network. Wget can't find it.. traceroute blows up on some part of the route. It ONLY affects my machine
2009-10-05T08:27:00.000Z	enjo13		any ideas/
2009-10-05T08:27:00.000Z	ssmy	enjo13	no idea. that's a weird one. maybe a hosts issue? but unlikely unless you messed with them.
