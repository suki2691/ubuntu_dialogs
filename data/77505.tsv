2008-11-26T16:04:00.000Z	baschtwork	bazhang	I'm facing this problem only under Ubuntu Server - it spits out "ata3" kernel-errors - but the disks are fine...
2008-11-26T16:06:00.000Z	bazhang	baschtwork	you could check launchpad or ubuntuforums to see if it is a software issue; though that does sound like hardware imo
