2012-06-28T19:41:00.000Z	bschott		I don't mean to be forward but there is customer data on a laptop with a linux installation that is giving me the unable to mount root error I listed above.   MY job could be on the line.  Any help is welcome.
2012-06-28T19:43:00.000Z	bschott		Perhaps it is an error that no-one knows how to fix?
2012-06-28T19:44:00.000Z	bschott		or it is a Linux bug
