2008-04-12T21:28:00.000Z	dmsuperman_	luisgmarine	so what you'd want to do is use your hdtv as a second monitor, and use that guide to set it up
2008-04-12T21:28:00.000Z	dmsuperman_	luisgmarine	there's also a guide, if you google "ubuntu dual monitor" on the ubuntu support forums is another thread that may also help
2008-04-12T21:31:00.000Z	dmsuperman_	luisgmarine	no, it's not a package. It's a setup, and requires you (usually) to edit your xorg.conf file to set up
