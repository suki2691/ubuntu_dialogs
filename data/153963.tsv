2006-12-20T16:47:00.000Z	trev_		ok, i just upgrade to edgy and i want to ditch totem and replace it with mplayer but synaptic won't let me without removing "ubuntu-desktop", am i doing something wrong?
2006-12-20T16:47:00.000Z	malikeye	trev_	you can remove that packages
2006-12-20T16:48:00.000Z	malikeye	trev_	it's just a meta package
2006-12-20T16:49:00.000Z	malikeye	trev_	it contains info about what ubuntu-desktop contains... kinda, I guess
