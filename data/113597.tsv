2007-12-08T19:41:00.000Z	Arelis		Hi all. I'm installing Ubuntu from the alternate disc, and it got far, but it has stopped saying "Please put the disk with label "Ubuntu_7.10_Gutsy_Gibbon_  - Release i386" in station "/dev/cdrom" and press enter". But... it's already in there, and i can't eject the disk to put it in another drive. Can anyone help me? And yes i've pressed enter, but then it just shows the same error again

2007-12-08T19:45:00.000Z	riotkittie	Arelis	do you have two drives, by any chance?
