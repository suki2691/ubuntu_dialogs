2012-09-14T01:53:00.000Z	mike__	ancient_	Sorry I should have asked my previous question better. Does the mountpoint and filesystem (shares/folders etc) have write permissions. P.s. I'm assuming we're talking about one of these? http://www.g-technology.com/products/g-raid.cfm
2012-09-14T01:58:00.000Z	mike__	ancient_	OK, I presume that's the directory that the device is mounted to (i.e. under /mnt or /media). What does the "mount" give you? Is option "rw" against the device.
2012-09-14T02:01:00.000Z	mike__	ancient_	sorry that was supposed to read ..."mount" command...
