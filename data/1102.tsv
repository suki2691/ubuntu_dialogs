2012-09-27T14:25:00.000Z	ooxii		hi i'm using ubuntu 12.04 and wondering how i can configure nautilus so that i can enter the path directly instead of having clickable buttons
2012-09-27T14:25:00.000Z	ooxii		in ubuntu 10.04 (or even before that) there was a pencil symbol
2012-09-27T14:25:00.000Z	ooxii		with that i could swap between the button path and the text path
2012-09-27T14:26:00.000Z	nsudo	ooxii	ctrl+L
