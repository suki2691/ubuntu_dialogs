2011-08-28T22:07:00.000Z	witeds_		hello i was wondering is there a way to say mount a file in the home directory
2011-08-28T22:08:00.000Z	zykotick9	witeds_	"mount a file" what are you trying to do?
2011-08-28T22:09:00.000Z	zykotick9	witeds_	it's quite possible to mount external devices into a directory in your home folder?!
2011-08-28T22:09:00.000Z	zykotick9	witeds_	ln isn't going to help, if the device is not mounted
