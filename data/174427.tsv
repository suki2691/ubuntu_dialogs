2007-05-08T09:09:00.000Z	Anguis		I've tried installing AMD64 Feisty a few times on my system - did the md5 check - and cannot get it to move past the first options screen - I can't even load the live cd. Any direction on getting it installed?
2007-05-08T09:10:00.000Z	redcard	Anguis	Hmm..move over to the alternate CD?
