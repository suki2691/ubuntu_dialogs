2010-08-20T23:42:00.000Z	RingZer0		I changed to ubuntu recently... one of the things I love about kde (vs gnome) was the built-in colorpicker.... is there a widget like that for ubuntu/gnome?
2010-08-20T23:42:00.000Z	nitrogoldfish	RingZer0	you could always use kubuntu (ubuntu with KDE)
2010-08-20T23:43:00.000Z	RingZer0		I stayed in the "tray" and remembered the last 30 colors you picked... each had a context and ability to copy the HTML color code, RGB color code, etc...
2010-08-20T23:43:00.000Z	RingZer0	nitrogoldfish	nah... i really prefer gnome (or LXDE)).
