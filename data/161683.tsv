2006-12-07T13:27:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder		should my dvd drive be mounted as /dev/hdc? is that normal or have I screwed something up?
2006-12-07T13:28:00.000Z	nothlit	CorpseFeeder	if its in the third slot then that is correct
2006-12-07T13:40:00.000Z	nothlit	CorpseFeeder	try putting a disc in and see if it automounts first
2006-12-07T13:57:00.000Z	nothlit	CorpseFeeder	either totem shouldn't be trying to mount it or it isnt using pmount properly
