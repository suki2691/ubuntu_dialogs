2005-12-20T10:57:00.000Z	newbc		i am looking for a all around great book for linux for christmas and recomended "The Linux Administration Handbook", would you guys agree or should i wait until the 2nd ed comes out, or maybe some other reference
2005-12-20T10:58:00.000Z	newbc		anyone?
2005-12-20T10:59:00.000Z	nickrud	newbc	I'd suggest the linux cookbook, it's not really a guide but it has a *lot* of great tidbits
2005-12-20T11:04:00.000Z	nickrud	newbc	have you cruised the orielly site? There's a kernel book they have, but I think it's a bit old
