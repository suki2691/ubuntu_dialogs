2008-04-22T08:17:00.000Z	kittykitty		how do i get apache / web browser to stop asking me to save the stupid .php output and just display it instead?
2008-04-22T08:19:00.000Z	undecim	kittykitty	that is just the problem joetheodd having at the moment
2008-04-22T08:22:00.000Z	undecim	kittykitty	If you just absolutely can't find the answer, I would try getting Live Http Headers  extension for firefox, then comparing the headers with the problematic server and a server that is working fine.
