2006-11-05T17:29:00.000Z	Bensin	sethk	I have a problem with upgrading Xubuntu 6.06 to 6.10 using the upgrade manager and need advice as to weather I should file a bug on this or not.
2006-11-05T17:29:00.000Z	sethk	Bensin	well, if it's a bug, why not?
2006-11-05T17:34:00.000Z	Bensin	sethk	Are you aware of others having problems upgrading from 6.06 to 6.10?
2006-11-05T17:35:00.000Z	sethk	Bensin	yes, but I don't know if the reason is the same
