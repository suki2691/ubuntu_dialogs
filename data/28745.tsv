2011-12-27T01:47:00.000Z	Ademan-remote		I've seen recommendations for and against different brands of cd-r for burning LiveCDs. but I'm not having much luck finding them right now. what cd-r brand should I buy to ensure a successful burn?
2011-12-27T01:48:00.000Z	iceroot	Ademan-remote	every cd-r should work
2011-12-27T01:48:00.000Z	iceroot	Ademan-remote	also a usb-drive is a good way
2011-12-27T01:49:00.000Z	Ademan-remote	iceroot	yes however if you go through ubuntuforums you'll see a lot of people saying "my cd wasn't working, tried a different brand at the same speed and now it's working"
