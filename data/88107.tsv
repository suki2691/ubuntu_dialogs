2008-06-15T16:11:00.000Z	icqnumber		hello, can some one please tell me how to edit (add/remove) items in places menu, items like drives(for example: floppy drive), for some reason my places menu in nautilus has one more item 'Filesystem'(points to /) in the second drive's section as the places menu in gnome-panel, is there a way to sync them? (btw. i do not want to know how to add custom folders ~/.gtk-bookmarks). there is nothing about it in the documentation(library.gnome... pages
2008-06-15T16:11:00.000Z	icqnumber		). are this settings available in gconf-editor?
