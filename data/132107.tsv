2009-10-23T07:03:00.000Z	K_Dallas		Hi guys! I have a GUI issue. How can I change Ubuntu9.10 default desktop, menu,task bars, ...into something like Windows 7/Vista (I hate having two bars on my screen, for one) or an Apple look? Also is there a theme which is neater than the default one (I have seen themes on the net but not sure hot to install them)? Thanks (many of the desktop-screencaptures I see from people, they are very nice but no guide how to get there)

2009-10-23T07:03:00.000Z	Billiard		you can move everything to one panel
