2005-12-16T08:18:00.000Z	rubem	thoreauputic	johndarkhorse, smo - hum. ok... but at least the apache+php info is correct
2005-12-16T08:18:00.000Z	rubem	thoreauputic	johndarkhorse, smo - why they keep that information?
2005-12-16T08:19:00.000Z	topyli	rubem	i don't even know who "they" are. it's certainly a ubuntu authorized page
