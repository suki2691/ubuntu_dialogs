2010-10-07T07:36:00.000Z	NameLess-js		Does anyone know how to remove the ubuntu boot loader entry?
2010-10-07T07:38:00.000Z	NameLess-js		so.. the boot loader is there but it is pointing at a non existed partition DualProxy
2010-10-07T07:38:00.000Z	mickster04	NameLess-js	run the one that does work then run update-grub and it will update the grub loader
