2010-11-24T20:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	NeoKipling	 take one of the other .conf files in there as an example perhaps.
2010-11-24T20:33:00.000Z	NeoKipling	Dr_Willis	I do tye this, the other work well ,but tor didn't work.
2010-11-24T20:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	NeoKipling	 you could just start from /etc/rc.local  I havent played with tor in ages. There used to be a wiki page on setting it up in ubuntu
