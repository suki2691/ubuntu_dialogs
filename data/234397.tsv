2005-06-01T10:25:00.000Z	danko2	crimsun	my Python has API version 1012, module MidiIn has version 1007. can I in any way downgrade to that version?
2005-06-01T10:30:00.000Z	danko2	crimsun	I got a midiIn with that program, you think I should install and replace with a newer version, it likely wont work...anyhow, a whole big deal about just one song, I wanna play a song, I should find better software that works.
2005-06-01T10:43:00.000Z	danko2	crimsun	do I want this package: xlib6g?
2005-06-01T10:58:00.000Z	danko2	crimsun	if I normally use esd, and I guess alsa, and now I have a program that wants to use OSS, what could I possibly do?
