2005-05-21T12:33:00.000Z	Florob	JairunCaloth	trust me you don't want to use wine, there is a linux equivalent for every windows app I know, you just will want your data, everything else is VERY unproductive. (there is a NTFS driver out there that ulitalizes the original windows drivers (and that for works nearly perfectly), but I've forgotten the name)
