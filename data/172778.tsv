2007-09-14T07:37:00.000Z	sysmin		Anyone have an idea what would cause my display running at 1280x800 to display GTK items large?
2007-09-14T07:37:00.000Z	erik__	sysmin	It has to do with the DPI setting, but I'm not sure where to configure that

2007-09-14T07:48:00.000Z	erik__	sysmin	Glad I could help with so little help ;)
