2007-06-08T11:49:00.000Z	PirateHead	Ott1	some Windows applications can be run in compatability mode, using Wine.
2007-06-08T11:49:00.000Z	PirateHead	Ott1	Not all applications are supported. Are you wondering about certain ones in particular?
2007-06-08T11:50:00.000Z	PirateHead	Ott1	You can download Wine directly from their debian repository. There are instructions on their website, winehq.com (.org? I forget)
