2007-11-30T10:11:00.000Z	command0-182		For some reason synaptic can't connect to the web, but I know I'm online
2007-11-30T10:12:00.000Z	command0-182		When I connect to the web, I can browse 'n stuff but when I go to update my repositories it says that the connection was refused
2007-11-30T10:13:00.000Z	command0-182		I can see the repository ftp in my browser, but why can't synaptic or update-manter see it
2007-11-30T10:13:00.000Z	spiffman	command0-182	did you try updating/upgrading synaptic?
