2009-05-30T19:44:00.000Z	necroforest		Are the packages mostly the same?
2009-05-30T19:45:00.000Z	Slart	necroforest	I would say the "target audience".. ubuntu is more about making a distro for everyday people.. debian feels more like a "teach people the right way"-distro =)
2009-05-30T19:45:00.000Z	Slart	necroforest	but I haven't been involved in the development of either.. so I wouldn't really know..
