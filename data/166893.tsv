2007-02-07T17:10:00.000Z	progek		can someone tell me where system links are stored when I use the ln command? I'm trying to erase an old link before creating a new one.

2007-02-07T17:11:00.000Z	BrianB04	progek	Well, there's more too it, but for all intents and purposes you delete the link, the link is gone
2007-02-07T17:12:00.000Z	progek	BrianB04	thanks, where would the link be so I can delete it?
