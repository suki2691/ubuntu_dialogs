2008-01-27T17:07:00.000Z	roddersg		can anyone tell me which cpu type of linux-restricted-module I should use for AMD processors running the 386-32-bit ubunut?
2008-01-27T17:08:00.000Z	roddersg		no I need the restricted modules because of nVidia, what I need to know is which one? 686/K7/K8
2008-01-27T17:08:00.000Z	roddersg		is there any command I can use to determine the best version?
