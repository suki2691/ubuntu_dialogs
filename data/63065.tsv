2009-08-13T05:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	brianguertin	 try making a folder in the Template directory? I recall there being such a dir.
2009-08-13T05:08:00.000Z	brianguertin	Dr_Willis	I tried, but then it just uses the folder as a submenu in the "Create" menu
2009-08-13T05:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	brianguertin	 i never use the feature - i even remove all templates.. i never use them. so  guess it cant then.
