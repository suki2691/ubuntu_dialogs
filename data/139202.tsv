2007-06-14T06:06:00.000Z	idefixx	Pwall	you can ie copy the content of /usr to another partition and mount it to /usr
2007-06-14T06:08:00.000Z	idefixx	Pwall	well sure you cann allways make new partition as long as you have the hd space for it
2007-06-14T06:09:00.000Z	idefixx	Pwall	actualy that is not 100% correct you must have space in your partition table.
