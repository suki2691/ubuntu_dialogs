2009-01-22T18:55:00.000Z	KemAWag	linux_newbie	you mean install windows onto a fresh partition from inside linux using virtualbox yeah that would probably work once i installed slackware that way to a partition from inside windows using vmware

2009-01-22T19:06:00.000Z	linux_newbie	KemAWag	sorry for the delay... but my linux only has 1gb left so is that possible to install windowsxp to another partition via vbox ?
