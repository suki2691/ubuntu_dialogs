2009-02-14T23:59:00.000Z	kejava		tomorrow i plan to setup an ubuntu pc at a client's site.  they've given me a proxy.pac file which i know works fine with firefox.  i want synaptic to work for them too.  can that same proxy.pac file be used in synaptic's network preferences?
2009-02-15T00:00:00.000Z	kejava		more ... i've read that adding export http_proxy="http://some_address.com/proxy.pac" to .bashrc may be the only way to get proxy support in synaptic

2009-02-15T00:02:00.000Z	kejava	bigbrovar	can one enter the proxy.pac file there?  or does it have to be an actual server address?
