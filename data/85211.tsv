2009-03-03T16:40:00.000Z	Dougal		Okays, i'm trying to undo the {windows-key}+R magnigier. I've just installed a 4Mb program called ccsm, and it doesn't do anything (hits an attribute error). Does anyone know a *quick* and simple way to fix this? just a button I can push. If there's no quick way i'll just restart the computer.

2009-03-03T16:46:00.000Z	Dougal	fosco_	Figured out the mistake. I ran ccsm in a text-only terminal, seemed easier to control than my crazy-desktop screen. I worked out that this  was the mistake. Still, for the record, i don't have a clue what 'compiz' is.
