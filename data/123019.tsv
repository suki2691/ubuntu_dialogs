2007-09-04T16:22:00.000Z	Nekow42		I'm getting a ton of messages like "Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/feisty-security/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz  400 Bad request" when I do a "sudo apt-get update"
2007-09-04T16:23:00.000Z	Nekow42		Is there something up with the servers, or is it on my side?
2007-09-04T16:24:00.000Z	Nekow42		Ehh, bad time to ask?
