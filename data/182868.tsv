2007-08-10T16:42:00.000Z	fromotion		I'm running xubuntu 7.04 and can't seem to get BitchX to display ANSI properly.  How do I fix this?
2007-08-10T06:15:00.000Z	fromotion		can anyone tell me how to fix the font encoding to display correctly in bitchx?
2007-08-10T06:16:00.000Z	Pelo	fromotion	 the ppl in #bitchx maybe ?
2007-08-10T06:17:00.000Z	Pelo	fromotion	 just a thought , but since they are bitchx users they might have encountered the problem and know how to solve it  even if it is not caused by bitchx
