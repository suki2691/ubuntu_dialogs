2006-04-22T10:20:00.000Z	fmonroe		hello, i have a newbie question is this the right place?
2006-04-22T10:21:00.000Z	fmonroe		i screwed up and did an "expert" install and now i have root instead of the usual "sudo" setup. my sudo doesn't do anything, i'd like to use sudo like a normal install
2006-04-22T10:21:00.000Z	fmonroe		i hope that makes sense
2006-04-22T10:22:00.000Z	digitalhav0c	fmonroe	if you do expert you get root yay!! lol i cant stand the sudo for everything deal
