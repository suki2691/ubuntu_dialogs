2008-05-16T04:24:00.000Z	corinth		I have a 64 bit processor. Is there any reason why I shouldn't use the 64 bit version of Hardy? For example, hardware compatibility or incompatible packages.

2008-05-16T04:26:00.000Z	soundray	corinth	other than that, 64bit support is quite good. Even skype, googleearth and acroread work (32bit versions of course)
