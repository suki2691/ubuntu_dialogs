2010-07-28T10:16:00.000Z	alphagas		I am having trouble installing ubuntu :-/  I get a soft-lockup during install.  I've tried about a dozen workarounds and none have produced any results.  I'm using a toshiba A355-S6935

2010-07-28T10:17:00.000Z	tucemiux	alphagas	i once had that problem, what i did is I removed the hard drive from the laptop and installed it on another laptop, installed xubuntu then put the hard drive to the original machine
