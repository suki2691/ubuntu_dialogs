2010-05-27T18:35:00.000Z	Psy-T		Hey, how do I set up a simple shortcut to start a Terminal with?
2010-05-27T18:35:00.000Z	Dale	Psy-T	have you seen gnome-do ?
2010-05-27T18:38:00.000Z	Dale	Psy-T	seriously checkout out gnome-do, a terminal for me is F1 + t
2010-05-27T18:38:00.000Z	Psy-T	Dale	I'll look into it if I ever need to set up keyboard shortcuts again, thanks.
