2011-01-20T08:40:00.000Z	schwinn434		I have tried to dual boot Ubuntu 10.10 with Windows xp (it works, as long as I don't install Ubuntu to a seperate HD)
2011-01-20T08:41:00.000Z	schwinn434		I have to install both OS onto the same HD to get the computer to dual boot, would like to install ubuntu 10.10 to its own hd
2011-01-20T08:41:00.000Z	rvn	schwinn434	you can do that, just have to set the ubuntu disk higher in the boot order in the bios
