2010-04-12T03:38:00.000Z	Xkcd		Guys, I'm having some troubles with the update-manager and i'm a very new (to Ubuntu at least) user, anyone able to help me?
2010-04-12T03:40:00.000Z	Xkcd		I'm using 9.10 (koala I think) and when I use the Update manager it always says "Not all updates can be installed" and prompts me to do a Partial Upgrade. So when I do it goes through "Preparing to upgrade" and then goes to "Error authenticating some packages" every time.
2010-04-12T03:41:00.000Z	Xkcd		It gives me a list of unauthenticated packages, but I have no idea what to do with them or how to fix it
2010-04-12T03:42:00.000Z	xangua	Xkcd	maybe those packages are still not ready, or did you add some extra repository recentlyÂ¿
