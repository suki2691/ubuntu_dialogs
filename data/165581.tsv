2006-10-02T14:01:00.000Z	Alex232		Is there only LiveCD for Ubuntu 5.10 (Breezy)? I've found only this one in the download directory on Ubuntu.com
2006-10-02T14:02:00.000Z	cafuego	Alex232	6.06 has a single CD which is both install+live.
2006-10-02T14:03:00.000Z	Alex232	cafuego	so, can I just insert my Desctop CD and load Ubuntu?
