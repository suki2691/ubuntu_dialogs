2008-01-28T14:06:00.000Z	Seveas	ochosi	it'll be useless but shouldn't hurt too much
2008-01-28T14:06:00.000Z	ochosi	Seveas	well, seems that my rsync script would like it a lot better (it's syncing to a fat32-usb drive)
2008-01-28T14:07:00.000Z	ochosi	Seveas	but anyways: is there even any possible after-effect?
