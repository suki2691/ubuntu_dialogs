2011-05-27T11:59:00.000Z	sparr		After mixing some natty packages with my maveric install I have serious problems. I can't get past "ubuntu" with 5 red dots on a normal boot. recovery boot works, but when I use failsafe X or startx as a user my mouse and keyboard stop working until I unplug and replug them. And I don't have my nvidia video driver for the new kernel.

2011-05-27T12:02:00.000Z	sparr	cirwin	do you know the package name for the current driver? I thought I had to use dkms or something (this breaks every time the kernel upgrades, but i only upgrade ever year or so, so i forget how to fix it)
2011-05-27T12:03:00.000Z	cirwin	sparr	I'm not certain, no
