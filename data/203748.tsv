2005-12-20T11:21:00.000Z	phosphoricx		hey guys, quick question, how can I setup LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be set on startup?
2005-12-20T11:21:00.000Z	polpak	phosphoricx	 why would you want to? (just curious)
2005-12-20T11:31:00.000Z	polpak	phosphoricx	when you log in.. But why did you want it set?
2005-12-20T11:33:00.000Z	phosphoricx	polpak	because I'm using amd64 and I need to pull some libs out of chroot to run it
