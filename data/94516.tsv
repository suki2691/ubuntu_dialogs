2008-04-17T15:30:00.000Z	lespat		I wanted to ask a really quick question about the coming upgrade - I'm a new Linux user and I've been using Gutsy since it arrived and I'm happy with it, but I want to know what happens in a week's time - what I mean is will aptitude automatically move me up to 8.04 or will it leave the choince to me, or will I have to do a fresh install? There may be a fourth option but if so it hasn't occured to me :)

2008-04-17T15:33:00.000Z	Lamego	lespat	you can disto upgrade at that time or keep the current version
2008-04-17T15:34:00.000Z	lespat	Lamego	that's good - I really like the way gutsy works and I would like to keep it that way on my main machine
