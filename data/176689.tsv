2006-06-25T08:53:00.000Z	basschimp		quick question: i connect to the internet through a router, and my gf's laptop also connects to the internet through this router, but by wireless. how much hassle should it be to see each other's computers on a LAN?

2006-06-25T08:54:00.000Z	basschimp	lamego	so i thought. i can see a Windows Network from this box, but no computers on it, and same goes for her
