2006-10-21T08:13:00.000Z	hastesaver_	Mad3Max3	are you sure whatever it is that you're compiling from source isn't in the repositories?
2006-10-21T08:13:00.000Z	hastesaver_	Mad3Max3	because the easiest thing is to never install from source and always use packages... I've never needed to compile from source. Adding and removing stuff is easy.
