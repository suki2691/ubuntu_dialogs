2009-11-09T22:41:00.000Z	doruk		hi there . I want to change the icons of running applications. Especially chromium-browser. I already changed the icon for the launcher but can't seem to change taskbar & alt-tab icons. (Tried changing the icons in /usr/share/pixmaps & /usr/share/icons/hicolor but didn't change anything...)
