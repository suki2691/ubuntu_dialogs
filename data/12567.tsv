2011-09-30T21:18:00.000Z	seanb		Is there somebody here who can answer a question for me? I'm thinking about moving to linux/ubuntu, but have one nagging issue. I do use a LOT of windows based programs, some of which do not have linux counterparts. Videos i've seen show linux using windows programs and games, but do not say how. Is it still just as easy as double clicking an EXE? Or is like in a mac environment, where i'm going to need to run an emulation suite?
