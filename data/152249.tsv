2008-07-10T11:21:00.000Z	co_Cool_abizzzz		hi shak, can you help me ? I have tried install 3ddesk but an error appears "gl/gl.h not installed". Do you have idea ?
2008-07-10T11:23:00.000Z	xtknight	co_Cool_abizzzz	install GL MESA libraries, or the development package for your video card
2008-07-10T11:23:00.000Z	xtknight	co_Cool_abizzzz	can you do a "locate gl/gl.h" and see where it is?
2008-07-10T11:26:00.000Z	xtknight	co_Cool_abizzzz	ok i am confused how are you compiling?
