2011-06-02T13:02:00.000Z	pfifo	petrolman	I think top only shows resources of one cpu at a time, refer to the manual and see if there are options to give more details
2011-06-02T13:03:00.000Z	petrolman	pfifo	I pressed 1 for all cpus in top, all cpus are lower than the cpu display in the system control
2011-06-02T13:05:00.000Z	pfifo	petrolman	im not sure what the issue is, could be several things
