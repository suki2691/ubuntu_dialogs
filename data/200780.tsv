2007-03-28T13:37:00.000Z	Last_Hero		is there someone here who I can question about Ubuntu in the context of thinking about switching to Ubuntu from XP?
2007-03-28T13:39:00.000Z	Last_Hero		I play games, less than I used to, but still a couple of hours a day, so, are games playable in Wine / Cedaga or is it similar to emulating a PS2?
2007-03-28T13:39:00.000Z	htedrom	Last_Hero	if you play games that much, i recommend you dual boot
2007-03-28T13:40:00.000Z	htedrom	Last_Hero	 wine and cedega really aren't competition for running the games natively
