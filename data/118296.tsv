2007-10-09T08:35:00.000Z	JosHate		Howdy-ho.  I've got a networking problem.  ra0 is the interface with Internet connectivity - I'm able to ping the router.  I'm connected to the machine through eth0 with a crossover cable.  I would like Ubuntu to connect via ra0 to the Internet, but it seems Hell-bent on using eth0 (which doesn't go to the Internet).  Can someone tell me how to prioritize network devices in Ubuntu?

2007-10-09T08:36:00.000Z	Pelo	JosHate	 did you try setting it in menu > sytem > admin > network ?
2007-10-09T08:36:00.000Z	JosHate	Pelo	- where in those settings do I set priority?
