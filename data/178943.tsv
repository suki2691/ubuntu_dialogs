2007-05-19T06:46:00.000Z	hmpedersen		I need to ask someone who's got experience with multiboot a question..

2007-05-19T06:49:00.000Z	hmpedersen	jrib	yeah.. It just took some time to type the question.. I had hoped I could copy paste and put the question right after the first line.. But I couldn't paste the question :(
