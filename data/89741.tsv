2008-05-24T21:27:00.000Z	Billenium		Whenever i boot from the LiveCD my machine stops at Running Local Boot Scripts... [OK]
2008-05-24T21:27:00.000Z	Billenium		How do i fix this?
2008-05-24T21:28:00.000Z	bijur	Billenium	try running the same boot cd in another comp to see if its a pblm with the cd, else try to get a more later version of the distro
2008-05-24T21:28:00.000Z	Billenium	bijur	i  was afraid of this, but im pretty sure it is the CD drive
