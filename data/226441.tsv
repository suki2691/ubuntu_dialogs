2008-11-11T04:08:00.000Z	gig		 I am trying to install mythbuntu....when it starts it goes to a screen that says busybox... initramfs buffer i/o error dev sr0.... and stops
2008-11-11T04:09:00.000Z	jmarsden	gig	That may be a bad hardware (bad RAM?  Bad CD?) issue?  CAn you boot and run memtest86+ for a while with no errors?
2008-11-11T04:10:00.000Z	gig	jmarsden	yep i can install an older version of mythbuntu 7.10
2008-11-11T04:10:00.000Z	jmarsden	gig	Does the cd test for the newly burned one say the CD is OK?
