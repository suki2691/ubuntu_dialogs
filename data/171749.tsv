2008-08-10T13:21:00.000Z	miyako	tcc_	what kind of video card and sound card do you have?
2008-08-10T13:23:00.000Z	miyako	tcc_	well, if it's a new computer like 'just bought it' the easiest way might be to look on the box or in the manual, otherwise you can use lsmod to see what kernel modules you have loaded and work backwards from there
2008-08-10T13:29:00.000Z	miyako	tcc_	can you run lspci and pastebin that as well
