2008-02-11T01:13:00.000Z	lintel		hi, I'd like to install Ubuntu on my Acer TM 2480. Anybody out here who can tell me if it goes well? (WLAN, sleep)
2008-02-11T01:14:00.000Z	MasterShrek	lintel	put the cd in your drive and boot of it and find out, sleep probably wont work all that well, never really does in linux
2008-02-11T01:15:00.000Z	lintel	MasterShrek	should it work already from live-CD?
2008-02-11T01:16:00.000Z	MasterShrek	lintel	the wifi might, its hard to say though, if you can pastebin the output of lspci -vv    i can give you some kind of an idea on how it will work
