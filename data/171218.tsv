2007-07-10T11:28:00.000Z	tapas	{-Billy-}	there is a way to put a linux fs into a directory of a fat32 partition. dunno if ubuntu offers that out of th box
2007-07-10T11:28:00.000Z	tapas	{-Billy-}	oh it's not available in ubuntu
2007-07-10T11:29:00.000Z	tapas	{-Billy-}	so you will need to have a partition for linux somewhere :)
