2009-08-18T07:15:00.000Z	MrMacPlus		need some advice, just got a thinkpad and I need to decide between jaunty or karmic
2009-08-18T07:16:00.000Z	MrMacPlus		also is there any difference between the minimal cd and installing server w/o any extra software?
2009-08-18T07:17:00.000Z	IdleOne	MrMacPlus	the server version has no GUI the minimal and LiveCD versions do
2009-08-18T07:19:00.000Z	IdleOne	MrMacPlus	any version you want will do fine but karmic is not ready :)
