2008-09-07T01:22:00.000Z	KnomeDE	carandraug	i was figuring that
2008-09-07T01:22:00.000Z	carandraug	KnomeDE	also, it seems it also works if you go to Applications > accessories > Character map
2008-09-07T01:24:00.000Z	carandraug	KnomeDE	you can take a look a this page as well https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Fonts It shows the folders where they usually are. You can list those folders yourself or write a script that lists them all for you if you plan on doing that a lot of times
