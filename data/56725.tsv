2009-05-21T17:06:00.000Z	mojo2214		I have the Acer EEE laptop but I prefer to run the desktop version of Ubuntu over the Notebook Remix, unforuantely I can't get the desktop ISO onto a USB stick correctly for installation but I can get the Notebook Remix disk .IMG file to install without issue, so I'm wondering if there is a disk IMG file of the Desktop ISO I can use. Or where I can find a program that will use the ISO file to be able to be installed via a USB Stick.
