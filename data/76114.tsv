2008-11-01T18:18:00.000Z	cousteau	ksbalaji	what I meant is that maybe I could use those kernels for doing something
2008-11-01T18:19:00.000Z	cousteau	ksbalaji	I always keep some old kernels; they may be useful (for example YouTube videos worked much better on 2.6.24-19 than on 2.6.24-21)
2008-11-01T18:20:00.000Z	ksbalaji	cousteau	usually a later kernel supports all oldies? Why then retain them?
