2009-01-31T23:57:00.000Z	holyguyver		My partition setup is set up so that I have two logical partitions & one extended partition with three partitions inside of it. I want to delete one of the partitions inside of my extended partition which  gparted will let me do, & then I want to shrink my extended partition which gparted will not let me do having the locked sign next to the extended partition. How can I shrink my extended partition?
