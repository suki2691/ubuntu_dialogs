2009-10-11T07:28:00.000Z	RegressLess		I have a partition set to automatically mount via Startup Applications. Can I add something to the command to keep it from putting an icon on my desktop?
2009-10-11T07:30:00.000Z	bastidrazor	RegressLess	mount it to some place other than /media ..or do like MenZa said and disable show_volume in gconf-editor
2009-10-11T07:32:00.000Z	RegressLess	MenZa	do you know where that is in gconf-editor?
2009-10-11T07:33:00.000Z	bastidrazor	RegressLess	notice that unchecking that option will keep sd cards from showing on the desktop too
