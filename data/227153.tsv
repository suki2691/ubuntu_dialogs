2006-04-16T08:34:00.000Z	UncleD		I'm using lynx on a page where the only way to submit is to click on a 'radio' button. I can toggle the radio button, but i cant seem to force the submission. Any ideas?
2006-04-16T08:35:00.000Z	UncleD		Are there any console based alternatives to lynx that are better?
