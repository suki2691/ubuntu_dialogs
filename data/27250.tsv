2010-08-18T18:56:00.000Z	Indy__		Hello, I bought a new computer with 2GB RAM and I will add another 2GB, for a total of 4GB RAM. I am going to install Ubuntu 10.04. How much swap space should I go for?
2010-08-18T18:56:00.000Z	Indy__		4GB?
2010-08-18T18:57:00.000Z	wastl	Indy__	there  is a directive that says swap should be at least 2x the size of physical ram
2010-08-18T18:57:00.000Z	Indy__	wastl	isn't 8GB of swap too much?
