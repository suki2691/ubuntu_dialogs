2008-06-29T10:57:00.000Z	bman		can someone point me to a howto on posting a kernel patch?
2008-06-29T10:58:00.000Z	bman		adding support for rockband guitar to the xpad driver in the kernel
2008-06-29T10:59:00.000Z	bman		i would think it would be better directly in the kernel than ubuntu specific
2008-06-29T10:59:00.000Z	minimaxe1	bman	isn't xpad a userspace driver?
