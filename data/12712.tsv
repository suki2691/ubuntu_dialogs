2011-07-08T09:43:00.000Z	abhijain	h1gh	which type of fonts
2011-07-08T09:45:00.000Z	h1gh	abhijain	got me ... maybe ask the person who wrote the doc?
2011-07-08T09:47:00.000Z	h1gh	abhijain	if you google "lwpuk" you will see many documents as funky as yours, all from India.  So perhaps some hindi or tamil character set or font?
