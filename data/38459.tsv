2010-01-24T03:09:00.000Z	microhaxo		I have a quick question, is it possible for me to make it so there can only be 1 browser window open at one time?
2010-01-24T03:11:00.000Z	microhaxo		I have this ubuntu setup for a person with special needs and he likes to open many browser windows, he doesn't understand the concept of tabs. How can i limit him to just 1 window open.
2010-01-24T03:12:00.000Z	microhaxo		Anyone? Is there any way to only allow 1 window run?
