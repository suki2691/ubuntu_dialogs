2011-01-04T14:48:00.000Z	WindowEd	bonjoyee	so lxde is the lightest... i thought xfce was :( installed the wrong one
2011-01-04T14:49:00.000Z	bonjoyee	WindowEd	"lightest" is a relative term!
2011-01-04T14:51:00.000Z	WindowEd		I tried to give ubuntu server a go but i felt like i was trying to work blindfolded with hands tied behind my back... is there a way to have an idea of its own surroundings from the terminal (for example listing the installed applications)?
2011-01-04T14:52:00.000Z	bonjoyee	WindowEd	so don't take my word as the last one.....see for yourself...lxde is just a few MB download away!
