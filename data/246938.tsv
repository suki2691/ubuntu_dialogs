2005-03-01T13:48:00.000Z	helio7		evening all; can anyone point me toward documentation that explains how to add alternate (non-gnome) desktop managers to the configuration file (don't know its name) so I may run a session in say, blackbox when I feel like it?  I realize it's googlable but I'm lacking good searching syntax
2005-03-01T13:49:00.000Z	helio7		I installed blackbox via synaptic, but am unsure of the simplest way to enable it
2005-03-01T13:51:00.000Z	Rattboi	helio7	where did you get blackbox?
