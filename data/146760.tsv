2007-04-03T11:13:00.000Z	maxxism		good evening all.  this may sound like a dumb question.  but in ubuntu is there a way to completely remove all added on packages that arent in the ubuntu-desktop meta repo?  sorta clean a whole system without a reinstall?
2007-04-03T11:14:00.000Z	maxxism		but what about all the dependancies that got added?
2007-04-03T11:15:00.000Z	cables	maxxism	there are a lot of essential packages that aren't part of ubuntu-desktop
2007-04-03T11:17:00.000Z	cables	maxxism	it's a beta. Wait till final.
