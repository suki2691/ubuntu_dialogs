2008-04-25T23:42:00.000Z	mudd`Hossam		hello, can i get my NVIDIA 680i onboard sound (High definition audio) to work over SPDIF?
2008-04-25T23:42:00.000Z	jackdaw	mudd`Hossam	there should be an option in alsa-mixer
2008-04-25T23:43:00.000Z	mudd`Hossam	jackdaw	i am able to listen over the analog connections just fine, just SPDIF was not detected i will look into those links though, thank you
2008-04-25T23:44:00.000Z	jackdaw	mudd`Hossam	yeaha you have to sort of turn on the right options in the alsa mixer, it's probably easier to use the gnome version but i found that the command line one had more controlls on it
