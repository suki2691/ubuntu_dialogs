2009-04-28T21:17:00.000Z	adelie42	minivitale	I'd recommend posting the question to ubuntu forums. someone can either gives the steps necessary or point to a guide, but what you are describing is more than a a click process
2009-04-28T21:19:00.000Z	minivitale	adelie42	thanks for the advice. I was hoping that 9.04 would potentially have this automatically done just as 8.10 did with dual monitors on a single graphics card. i guess that was wishful thinking. i will head over to the forums.
