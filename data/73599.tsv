2012-10-25T03:10:00.000Z	GeorgeTorwell		What is the difference between a ubuntu LTS and non-LTS release? Is it worth upgrading from 12.04 (LTS) to 12.10?
2012-10-25T03:11:00.000Z	GeorgeTorwell		So does that mean 12.10 wont be supported long term?
2012-10-25T03:12:00.000Z	GeorgeTorwell		But 12.10 will recieve updates and such, right?
2012-10-25T03:12:00.000Z	pepee	GeorgeTorwell	yes. for a couple years
