2011-05-04T02:11:00.000Z	ChR0n05	Stereocaulon	last 3 routers I've had have been .0.1
2011-05-04T02:13:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	ChR0n05	fair enough, I have configured about 12 different models, most of them aimed at home users did not use 192.168.0.1 as main address. May just be coincidence though, think nothing of it.
2011-05-04T02:13:00.000Z	ChR0n05	Stereocaulon	yeah, depends on model.
