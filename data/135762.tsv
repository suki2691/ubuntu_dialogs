2007-04-30T16:51:00.000Z	geirola		hey..where can I get help on getting tv-out to work? I use Debian 4.0 and I have a xfx Geforce 6800GS card..
2007-04-30T16:52:00.000Z	jrib	geirola	#debian for debian help
2007-04-30T16:54:00.000Z	geirola	jrib	i've tried there, but noone answers..and since it's probably the same for ubuntu i thought i'd ask here
2007-04-30T16:54:00.000Z	jrib	geirola	there are some instructions on wiki.ubuntu.com (search for nvidia tvout), it's easy to just use "nvidia-settings" too
