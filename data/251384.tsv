2005-04-11T14:22:00.000Z	neighborlee	fraggsta	yeah I just concern because you see on forums of ubuntu that it can cause data corruption on power outage for example but I  hear that reiser '4' is stable possibly and just wondered what version hoary RC had ;-)
2005-04-11T14:23:00.000Z	fraggsta	neighborlee	yes it *can* cause filesystem corruption but like most arguments brought up in filesystem debates that's extremely rare.  I think it's reiser4 that hoary has (and you really *shouldn't* use reiserfs >4)
