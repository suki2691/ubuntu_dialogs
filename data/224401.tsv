2006-04-19T06:07:00.000Z	shredder_		Concord Dawn are you using a P4 elite group motherboard?
2006-04-19T06:08:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	shredder_	no. It's an 8 year old motherboard.
2006-04-19T06:09:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	shredder_	yes. But it ran Hoary fine and I did a dist-upgarde to Breezy, so I don't see it why it doesn't love my Breezy install media.
