2011-01-19T09:47:00.000Z	Leif		GEdit has started telling me that every word is misspelled.  I'm thinking the dectionary may have gotten uninstalled, is there any way I can get it back?
2011-01-19T09:48:00.000Z	MTecknology	Leif	and the correct dictionary is selected?
2011-01-19T09:48:00.000Z	Leif	MTecknology	There is no options in the "set language" dialog in tools
2011-01-19T09:49:00.000Z	Leif	MTecknology	Mmm...it also looks like language-package-en is installed
