2005-07-02T15:07:00.000Z	budluva		can someone tell me why i can only transfer files over my lan via scp at 1500k/sec? with ftp i can get the full 10,000k/sec out of my network
2005-07-02T15:08:00.000Z	budluva		is that the way scp was designed or is something wrong with my setup?
2005-07-02T15:08:00.000Z	davidmccabe	budluva	bits vs. bytes?
2005-07-02T15:08:00.000Z	davidmccabe	budluva	or perhaps if you have a 386 doing the encryption.
