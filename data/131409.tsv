2007-09-03T10:52:00.000Z	kidbuntu	TyphoidHippo	i tried that but it won't. i still get the same segmentation fault then core dumped
2007-09-03T10:55:00.000Z	TyphoidHippo	kidbuntu	- if I were you, I'd do that since it only takes about twenty minutes or so....you can back up your home directory first, of course
2007-09-03T10:56:00.000Z	kidbuntu	TyphoidHippo	i'll just do it since i dont have something to backup anyway.
