2010-02-01T15:58:00.000Z	vianocturna85		front end
2010-02-01T15:59:00.000Z	vianocturna85		mysql is gonna be running, but there has been a request to create a program that connects to it for maintaining the info in MS Access, this seems illogical to me
2010-02-01T15:59:00.000Z	archboxman	vianocturna85	can use playonlinux in ubuntu and load ms access
