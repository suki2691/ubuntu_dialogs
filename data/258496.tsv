2005-05-27T06:37:00.000Z	DeFi		im not really for installing a program to fix whats wrong with another program, rather just fix the issue directly
2005-05-27T06:39:00.000Z	holycow	DeFi	thats really what most of the problems are caused by on windows, cluebies thinking they know what they are doing, when in reality they aren't fixing anything they are just installing YET ANOTHER piece of software
2005-05-27T06:40:00.000Z	holycow	DeFi	no one actually fixes shit on windows, they hope and pray they can find a fix to INSTALL on their machine
