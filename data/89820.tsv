2009-09-21T19:19:00.000Z	grobda24	n8tuser	I nned to create a ttyUSB node for my Qualcomm 3G device. I need to Telnet to it to turn off the internal flash memory which is blocking it being seen as a modem.
2009-09-21T19:23:00.000Z	grobda24	n8tuser	no, no dev entry that I can see (I've been told that it should look like ttyUSBx). I will try that, thanks.
2009-09-21T19:24:00.000Z	grobda24	n8tuser	do you want to see the output ?
