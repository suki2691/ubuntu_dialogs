I have been researching all evening on getting the filing permissions right but its getting a bit complex.  Basically I need to set the correct permissions in /etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf.. and what I want is to block all access to all folders except a folder called /var/www with all the contents withing www being unblocked ?
