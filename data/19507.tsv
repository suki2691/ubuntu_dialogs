2011-04-17T12:12:00.000Z	darkcore		hi, anyone here available for some help?
2011-04-17T12:14:00.000Z	darkcore		I installed Ubuntu 11.04b, with encrypted home folder, then I installed XFCE 4.8, but it apparantly doesn't decrypt the home folder when I log on with XFCE, as I can't access my home folder. Any ideas on how to fix this?
2011-04-17T12:14:00.000Z	darkcore		oh, right, my bad :)
