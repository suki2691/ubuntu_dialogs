2012-07-23T18:01:00.000Z	stephans_		Please help analyze problem: in KDE, Dolphin connects via sftp to my other machine, propts for user and pass. I enter the correct values, and it fails to log on. using ssh works fine. using nautilus works fine. using filezilla works fine. what could be wrong with dolphin?
2012-07-23T18:01:00.000Z	NewWorld	stephans_	 What error msg does it return?
2012-07-23T18:02:00.000Z	stephans_	NewWorld	it simply prompts me to try again.
2012-07-23T18:04:00.000Z	NewWorld	stephans_	 Maybe you'll get an informative error msg if you run dolphin from command line and try to login
