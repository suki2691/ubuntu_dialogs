2010-04-29T23:53:00.000Z	yellowroost924		so who would find using 64bit ubuntu a better option then?
2010-04-29T23:54:00.000Z	kbar	yellowroost924	only difference really is you can use more than 2GB of ram
2010-04-29T23:55:00.000Z	yellowroost924	kbar	i see. i have 1GB ram
2010-04-29T23:55:00.000Z	kbar	yellowroost924	then get the 32bit
