2008-04-08T08:26:00.000Z	Randocal		How tricky is the upgrade process for moving from one release to the next?
2008-04-08T08:27:00.000Z	bazhang	Randocal	not tricky at all
2008-04-08T08:28:00.000Z	bazhang	Randocal	he should run the gutsy livecd and see how well it picks up his wireless video etc
2008-04-08T08:32:00.000Z	bazhang	Randocal	good point; better to use the livecd until hardy or just install gutsy now and then really learn a lot in the process of upgrading
