2009-11-10T02:45:00.000Z	mbeierl	m1dlg	go to a terminal and run the command "top" and see what is using the CPU
2009-11-10T02:46:00.000Z	m1dlg	mbeierl	It's a sound issue, and the CPU bit is an incorrect diagnosis
2009-11-10T02:48:00.000Z	m1dlg	mbeierl	the problem seems to have resolved it's self, possibly because i stopped and then continued pulse audio
