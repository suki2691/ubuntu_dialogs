2012-10-29T15:36:00.000Z	apocalyptiq		hi! I spilled my keyboard with coffee, i've cleaned it, but "x" key doesnt work - how can I set in Ubuntu a shortcut for that letter? For example: "'c' + ALT = 'x'"?
2012-10-29T15:37:00.000Z	apocalyptiq		is there some configuration file in ubuntu, for custom keyboard shortcuts?
