2006-02-27T09:04:00.000Z	Silivrenion		I need to know, in the ubuntu /boot directory, should vmlinuz be named "vmlinuz" or "vmlinuz-2.6.12-9-386"
2006-02-27T09:05:00.000Z	bimberi	Silivrenion	and /vmlinuz is a symbolic link to it
2006-02-27T09:05:00.000Z	Silivrenion	bimberi	nickrud :: I'm getting errors from grub saying that vmlinuz doesnt exist
2006-02-27T09:07:00.000Z	bimberi	Silivrenion	if it helps, my (dapper) kernel line is "kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.15-15-386 root=/dev/hda4 ro quiet splash"
