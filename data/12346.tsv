2012-01-24T10:27:00.000Z	zykotick9	LastArms	do you have OB installed?  try running "startx" if you do.
2012-01-24T10:28:00.000Z	LastArms	zykotick9	I can't do startx since all the screen shows are the commands it runs and stops at "Started MySql server" and doesn't allow me to login
2012-01-24T10:28:00.000Z	zykotick9	LastArms	did you disable all your VTs somehow?  nothing on alt+f1 -> alt+f6?
