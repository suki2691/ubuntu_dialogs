2011-09-01T19:05:00.000Z	myka		asking again: I am trying to upgrade to Ubuntu 10.04 LTS from Qimo1/Xubuntu8. The installation stalls after about a minute with the caps lock and scroll lock lights flashing on the keyboard. What does this mean and how do I fix it so I can complete the installation?
2011-09-01T19:07:00.000Z	myka		sidewinder1, what does that mean -- it sounds bad.
2011-09-01T19:09:00.000Z	myka		sidewinder1, is there a way to overcome the kernel panic, or am I just stuck.
2011-09-01T19:10:00.000Z	chrisgu	myka	are you able to login ? if so you may just have a problem with your X config
