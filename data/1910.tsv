2012-07-18T21:03:00.000Z	TheWhiteHatter		My fans have stopped spinning.  Can anyone help?
2012-07-18T21:05:00.000Z	TheWhiteHatter		I attempted to install fancontrol, when i ran the pwmconfig, my fan refused to come back on.  I'm using 12.04 LTS, on a Toshiba Sattellie p20-s7469.  When I run pwmconfig it states that there are no pwm-capable sensor modules installed.
