2009-10-07T23:33:00.000Z	nh2		I accidentally changed a bunch of permissions in /var/log. How can I find out which permissions the directories should have?
2009-10-07T23:34:00.000Z	ikonia	nh2	look at the linux fhs file system, that should give you an idea, or get the infro from someone elses system
2009-10-07T23:36:00.000Z	nh2	ikonia	isn't that information somewhere in apt? because during installation, it makes the dirs usable by the equivalent users, eg. /var/log/news news:news
2009-10-07T23:36:00.000Z	ikonia	nh2	no, it's part of the package
