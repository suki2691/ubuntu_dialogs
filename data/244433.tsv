2005-07-11T09:22:00.000Z	steve-0		Men(and ladies ofcuz) I just wanted to tell you about this great res. http://www.ubuntuguide.org/ ... I'm newbie to UBUNTU, and this site helps me alot ! :)))
2005-07-11T09:23:00.000Z	jasoncohen	steve-0	the problem is that ubuntuguide tells you what to do but not why you are doing it- and some of their suggestions aren't that great
2005-07-11T09:24:00.000Z	jasoncohen	steve-0	it can be useful but as the wiki says it's merely a list of useful commands without any explanation of why you would want to use them
2005-07-11T09:24:00.000Z	jasoncohen	steve-0	for example it tells you how to enable the root account without explaining the reasons for doing this or the consequences
