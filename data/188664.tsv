2006-05-02T14:32:00.000Z	mjr	Bicster	yes; rather do a clean install, preserving only /home and perhaps something else you've done by hand
2006-05-02T14:33:00.000Z	Bicster	mjr	no way to do it using apt?
2006-05-02T14:33:00.000Z	mjr	Bicster	there is. Not supported. You might have to do black apt magic.
