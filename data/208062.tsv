2005-11-10T10:44:00.000Z	mlalkaka		i'm currently a debian user planning to switch to ubuntu. i wondering about this statement on ubuntu's website: "Each release is supported with free security updates and fixes for at least 18 months." does this mean after 18 months i have to get another ubuntu cd and upgrade my OS in order to get security updates; or can this upgrade of operating system be done over the internet as well?
