2008-07-19T04:31:00.000Z	Jetts	Jordan_U	I have a mix of IDE and sata drives, specifically 1 IDE (primary boot drive) and 4 sata drives (for storage), if I unplug the sata drives life is dandy to boot up, if I plug them in both lilo and grub freeze without any error messages
2008-07-19T04:32:00.000Z	Jetts	Jordan_U	nope, just stuck at Loading Grub, Please wait... (can't remember the exact message)
2008-07-19T04:49:00.000Z	Jetts	Jordan_U	far as I'm aware everything was working fine up until my IDE drive died
