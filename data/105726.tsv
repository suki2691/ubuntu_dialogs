So say I have an incomplete torrent download on my windows partition, can I run the same torrent and have it continue the download from within windows? I know I could do this, but do you guys think it'll be reliable?

2008-01-18T02:51:00.000Z	Blaenk	bod_	that's what I've been thinking, wondering if it'll be fine though
