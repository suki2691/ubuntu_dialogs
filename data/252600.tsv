2005-07-11T13:57:00.000Z	Blissex	HappyFool	no, ADSL modems are not really ''modems''.
2005-07-11T13:57:00.000Z	Blissex	HappyFool	in any case most ADSL modems are in effect winmodems, and they are very very dodgy to make to work with Linux.
2005-07-11T13:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	Blissex	ok. my point is tiredbones is going on about adsl ;)
