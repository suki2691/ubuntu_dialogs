2011-10-29T12:13:00.000Z	jasef	WanderingEnder	there is. I just didn't feel like using it.
2011-10-29T12:26:00.000Z	WanderingEnder	jasef	You asked if there were any other rules, there's the rules, if you find one you're breaking, then you know to stop it. If you aren't breaking any, then don't worry about it.
