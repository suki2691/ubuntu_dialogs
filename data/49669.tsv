There are three important effects. sparse files are larger than on-disk size.  small files can pad out to a minimum block size.  Hard linked files can appear twice in the filesystem but once on the disk.

2009-10-18T03:29:00.000Z	stroyan	m_law	 The "df" command is good about showing how much space on disk is used.
