2009-08-05T11:07:00.000Z	alucard		morning is there a way to install dupal via synaptic so it uses the xampp instead of the ordinary "lamp" features synaptics wants to install - for instance apache2
2009-08-05T11:09:00.000Z	alucard		i have xampp installed with help from a user here - but when i use synaptic to install drupal - it wants to install apache 2  - which is installed
