2009-04-19T13:22:00.000Z	jbee		hey...I have a problem with my ext3 filesystem,i have done many fscks and always seems to correct the problem but everytime same problems occur!Anyway,i want to ask if i can have a partition with no filesystem at all...Seems stupid but a friend told me it can happen and i think it'd be just perfect for backup!So can it happen or not?
2009-04-19T13:23:00.000Z	jbee		ok JECHO so what filesystem you suggest using for backup?i have some bad experiences with ext3 and reifers
2009-04-19T13:24:00.000Z	armornick	jbee	try ex2
2009-04-19T13:24:00.000Z	armornick	jbee	maybe there's a problem with the jounaling
