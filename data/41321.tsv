2010-10-06T00:15:00.000Z	shanepardue		I have a passwordless SSH session, but fstab won't automount it. It needs a password when using sudo mount -a
2010-10-06T00:16:00.000Z	mmaksimov	shanepardue	that's expected behaviour for sudo in an ssh session
2010-10-06T00:16:00.000Z	shanepardue	mmaksimov	How do you get an ssh session to automount with fstab then?
2010-10-06T00:17:00.000Z	mmaksimov	shanepardue	sorry, please disregard my post, I misunderstood you. Sorry again.
