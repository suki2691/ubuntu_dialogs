2006-07-10T09:46:00.000Z	devhen	finalbeta	all i know is that there is a setting in totem's preferences
2006-07-10T09:47:00.000Z	finalbeta	devhen	yes, found that one, keeps resetting? Is their not a way to force system wide 5.1? Like on windows :p
2006-07-10T09:48:00.000Z	devhen	finalbeta	not sure. never used 5.1 on linux. sorry. if you dont get response try the forums on ubuntu.com
