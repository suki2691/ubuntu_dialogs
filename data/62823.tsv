2011-02-20T03:57:00.000Z	sam555		i've recently uninstalled ubuntu 9.10 on a machiine that dual booted to win7 and ubuntu.  I removed the ubuntu 9.10 installation in win7.  However, when I reboot, it tries to use grub, which fails.  How do I remove the grub installation and let windows do the start up?
