2008-12-03T15:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lancao8	if its in virtualbox, boot the system then click machine -> install guest additions
2008-12-03T15:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lancao8	you also need sound configured in the virtual machine's config
2008-12-03T15:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lancao8	then you need it enabled in the vm and install the guest additions
