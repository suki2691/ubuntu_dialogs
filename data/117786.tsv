I've loaded Ubun Ult on a  etl3 partition on hd0 (winxp on dif partition on same drive), but I don't think that grub was installed correctly.  It def doesn't give me the opp to choose what os to boot from.  Any ideas?  I've been doing alot of research and tried installing multiple times.  I think it stems from my lack of knowledge of how ETL3, swap, and NTFS interact with the MBR.

2007-10-05T09:45:00.000Z	ubuntnoob	danielax	- thanks, but isn't it the same thing, especially the install?  Or are the versions that diff?
