2009-12-31T05:15:00.000Z	LordHawke13		My computer won't boot to USB.
2009-12-31T05:15:00.000Z	h00k	LordHawke13	it might not be supported by your BIOS
2009-12-31T05:16:00.000Z	LordHawke13	h00k	damian, NeT_DeMoN, Though it may not be supported from the BIOS menu, is there a way I can have the GRUB menu chainload a bootable USB device?
