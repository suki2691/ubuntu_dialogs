2012-01-27T05:34:00.000Z	balleyne		I just upgraded to 11.04, and can't log in to Ubuntu or Ubuntu Classic, but Ubuntu Classic (no effects) works. When I log in with effects, I just get a plain desktop background, no panels or Unity... help?

2012-01-27T05:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	balleyne	 you installed the fglrx/ati drivers from the 'addational drivers' tool?  jockey-gtk from the cli.
2012-01-27T05:38:00.000Z	balleyne	Dr_Willis	everyone was working before the upgrade, pretty sure I was using fglrx (was xserver-driver-fglrx a while back...)
