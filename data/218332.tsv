2008-09-01T02:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	scx	probably redistribution is not allowed
2008-09-01T02:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	scx	in case of ET and UT there are companies that hold rights for the artwork maps textures etc (now that the 3d engine is gpl)
2008-09-01T02:24:00.000Z	scx	erUSUL	but there are glest (3d models etc isnt free) and similar game
2008-09-01T02:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	scx	maybe glest developers *do* *allow* for their work to be redistribuible but ET and UT ones *do* *not*. it is not hard to understand
