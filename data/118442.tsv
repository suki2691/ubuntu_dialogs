2008-01-23T10:22:00.000Z	baconbits		I followed the pendrivelinux tutorial to install feisty to a usb drive (persistent), but when I go to boot from the drive, I get "Could not find kernel image: linux" followed by a "Boot:" prompt. I have started over with the tutorial twice now, thinking perhaps I missed a step or made a typo, but I get the same result each time. The CD I am using has been checked for errors several times and comes up clean. Any suggestions?

2008-01-23T10:25:00.000Z	bazhang	baconbits	the usb option might be for a usb external hard drive--not sure if that covers usb pen drives in all cases--I had an older computer that could boot from the former but not the latter
2008-01-23T10:28:00.000Z	bazhang	baconbits	then no worries on that front; I've had mixed luck with those tutorials on www.pendrivelinux.com ; just a tiny error will bork the whole deal--took me three tries to get it right the first time
