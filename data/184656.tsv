2006-07-03T07:03:00.000Z	zooy0rk	FunkyDiscoMan	was that for me?
2006-07-03T07:04:00.000Z	zooy0rk	FunkyDiscoMan	I already know that i2c-sensor.ko is not on my machine ... I was wondering if something was wrong personally with my machine or if the module is not included with dapper or if possibly it has been compiled into the kernel
2006-07-03T07:11:00.000Z	zooy0rk	FunkyDiscoMan	I have, I specfically need to insert the i2c-sensor module but it does not appear to be present. I was just curious if anyone knew if maybe it was compiled into the kernel.  oh well ... i will just build my own
