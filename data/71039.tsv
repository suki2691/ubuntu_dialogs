2010-08-13T23:37:00.000Z	arrrghhh	mooglenorph	are you running a headless server?
2010-08-13T23:37:00.000Z	mooglenorph	arrrghhh	no, a netbook. and I'm using UNR because I assume that the kernel for UNR is different?
2010-08-13T23:37:00.000Z	mooglenorph	arrrghhh	if that's not true, I'll just install server edition on my netbook and install X packages from there, and then the WM that I like
2010-08-13T23:38:00.000Z	arrrghhh	mooglenorph	i don't believe so, the kernels are the same.  same goes for server, unless you're running 64-bit.
