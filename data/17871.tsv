2012-01-16T07:52:00.000Z	Osmodivs		Hello. I restored my files from a backup, now, all folders are owned by root, but the files inside are owned by me. So, How do I change the owner of a folder but not the files inside it, because they are already the correct owner.

2012-01-16T07:55:00.000Z	Osmodivs	Diamondcite	How do chown will know what type of owner is going to change?
