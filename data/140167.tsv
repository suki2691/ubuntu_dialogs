2007-04-19T14:31:00.000Z	jhaig		I'm trying to upgrade from 6.10 to 7.04 using "Software Updates" but I don't get the "Upgrade" button.  Is there a step I need to do first?  I do have the latest version of update-manager.
2007-04-19T14:31:00.000Z	Linuxnewbie756	jhaig	try sudo apt-get distro-upgrade
2007-04-19T14:31:00.000Z	jhaig	Linuxnewbie756	Erm, I could try that, but I would rather use the 'official' route.
2007-04-19T14:33:00.000Z	jhaig	Linuxnewbie756	Anyway, that didn't do anything (0 upgrades)
