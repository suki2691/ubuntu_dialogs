2009-05-07T18:43:00.000Z	smr904		hello - I just installed envyng and then from hardware drivers - chose the nvidia 180 (recommended) driver and it doesn't activate
2009-05-07T18:44:00.000Z	smr904		does anyone know what's wrong with the drivers?
2009-05-07T18:44:00.000Z	ikonia	smr904	hardwaredrivers is nothing to do with envy
2009-05-07T18:44:00.000Z	ikonia	smr904	you need to setup the nvidia components via envy manually
