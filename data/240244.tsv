2007-12-29T06:28:00.000Z	nickrud	disasterpiece	I use none
2007-12-29T06:29:00.000Z	nickrud	disasterpiece	unless you're hosting mail or some such for windows machines, you don't really need anti-virus
2007-12-29T07:49:00.000Z	nickrud	disasterpiece	root in this context means the user that can do anything
