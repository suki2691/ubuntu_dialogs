2005-11-07T16:26:00.000Z	fr33mind		Is there a tool in opensource world, like Crystal Report, to make some report from postgres that I can access from my home-made app to print?
2005-11-07T16:28:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	fr33mind	IMO, applications like that are in flux and development. Have you checked Openoffice 2 base?
2005-11-07T16:30:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	fr33mind	there is an app called pgaccess for postgress, forms and reports.
2005-11-07T16:38:00.000Z	fr33mind	Nick_Hill	anto9us : No I don't checked openoffice 2 at all.  But I must be able to access my report FROM my home-made app in C (so there should be an API)
