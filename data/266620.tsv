2010-05-13T16:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	outybuntu	 it totally depends on the exact game you are using.
2010-05-13T16:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	outybuntu	 many games do work very well. and there is a port of steam to native linux in the works
2010-05-13T17:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	outybuntu	 you will have to alter the fstab to point to the new locations
