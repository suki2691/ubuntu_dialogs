2010-05-03T09:09:00.000Z	anabasis	dhruvasagar	nvidia-current and dependencies, right? no other packages needed ?
2010-05-03T09:09:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	anabasis	if you've already installed them, you should go to System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers
2010-05-03T09:10:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	anabasis	there you can enable the drivers, if you still have something yet to install usually it is able to install from there
