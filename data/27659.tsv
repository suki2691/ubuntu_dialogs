2010-08-11T04:45:00.000Z	thijss		I have 2 servers in a datacenter, however, i failed to configure one right, and i got no acces to it whatsoever. Is there any way to check on what port the ssh on the second machine is running?
2010-08-11T04:47:00.000Z	th0r	thijss	did you remember to open that port on the firewall?
2010-08-11T04:47:00.000Z	thijss	th0r	I dont believe i installed a firewall at all..
