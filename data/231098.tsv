2006-04-17T11:50:00.000Z	Dralid		Is there a queue before me, or did I just ask too tough a question?
2006-04-17T11:51:00.000Z	Dralid		Thank you, ubotu (I know its a bot) (I've never IRC'd before, I'm new)
2006-04-17T11:51:00.000Z	Dralid		I need to burn an image (ISO) from a NTFS File System.  I have K3b, I can mount the drive under System/Administration/Disks but that only gives root access, I need to either modify access to the disk to allow the K3b to access, or the sudo command to copy the files onto the desktop. I am using ubuntu live.
2006-04-17T11:52:00.000Z	LathropWells	Dralid	- would gksudo k3b work?
