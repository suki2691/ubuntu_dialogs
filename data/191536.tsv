2006-04-08T14:19:00.000Z	ChrisLTD		I'm having a hell of time getting Ubuntu to work on my nforce3 ati radeon 9800pro setup... it's really bad ATI doesn't have decent drivers for Linux
2006-04-08T14:19:00.000Z	Jeldert	ChrisLTD	I have nForce3 and ati 9800 pro, and no problems
2006-04-08T14:20:00.000Z	ChrisLTD	Jeldert	really?  Ubuntu keeps freezing on me at the GUI login
