2011-09-04T01:37:00.000Z	pr0zoid		Anyone know how i would take an image of a remote ubuntu server with approx. 2GB of data on (10GB total) drive?  I need to restore the "image" locally so i can have an exact copy of the production system
2011-09-04T01:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	pr0zoid	 dd command can make an image.
2011-09-04T01:39:00.000Z	pr0zoid	dr_willis	any guides you can recommend?
2011-09-04T01:53:00.000Z	pr0zoid	dr_willis	given that i only have 1 drive 10gb thats not full (75% free) would partitioning it had using the new partition as my drive be an option? or does dd work at the drive level?
