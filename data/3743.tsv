2012-04-25T22:49:00.000Z	steve-o_		I have a machine that won't boot...the system BIOS was complaining about "no boot device found" but if I manually selected the hard drive, it would boot. I did a boot-repair from a live cd and not when I celect the drive manually I get "missing operating system"--anybody have any ideas?  http://paste.ubuntu.com/946105/

2012-04-25T22:51:00.000Z	throwaway_rq	steve-o_	it's an IDE drive?
2012-04-25T22:54:00.000Z	steve-o_	throwaway_rq	It's an Intel with a G620 proc...series 6 chipset. Forget exactly what model but I wanna say DG61
