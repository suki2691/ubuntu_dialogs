2004-10-19T09:24:00.000Z	grue_		Hello, I have a real question this time
2004-10-19T09:25:00.000Z	grue_		Is there a way to change file/folder permissions from the Gnome fle browser?  Or can that only be done from a root terminal?
2004-10-19T09:26:00.000Z	grue_		nautilus is what I meant.  Is there a way for my normal user to get those permissions?
2004-10-19T09:27:00.000Z	AndyFitz	grue_	 alot of the time I load nautilus --browser as root from terminal and set permissions
