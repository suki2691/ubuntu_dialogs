2007-03-17T09:12:00.000Z	ramza3		everytime I veer from the ubuntu site, I get scared
2007-03-17T09:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	ramza3	there are some good 3rd party docs out there - the Gentoo wiki is generally good, for example.
2007-03-17T09:13:00.000Z	ramza3	Madpilot	gentoo is pretty cool, I went from gentoo to ubuntu a while back. ok, outside of gentoo and ubuntu info
