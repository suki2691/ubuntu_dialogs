2011-07-11T04:01:00.000Z	kisuke	pfifo	im doing a patch untill a natty version get released, the XBMC unstable is not dooing good things to my mental health.
2011-07-11T04:01:00.000Z	pfifo	kisuke	you should build from source instead of forcing a maverick package onto natty
2011-07-11T04:04:00.000Z	kisuke	pfifo	thers one im not looking forward to.
