2012-07-24T18:49:00.000Z	OrangeDragon		Hey! I have successfully installed a printer in ubuntu, but now I want to share that printer with a windows computer, but there is no drivers for the printer for that windows version (windows 7 64 bit)
2012-07-24T18:49:00.000Z	OrangeDragon		can I share the printer in a way that windows 7 64 bit can use without having special drivers?
