2010-10-27T08:32:00.000Z	yao_ziyuan	TeruFSX	i don't know why distros with fresh packages (e.g. ubuntu, fedora) all use pulseaudio by default. on my machine, pulseaudio can't mix sounds. i always have to manually disable it.
2010-10-27T08:33:00.000Z	TeruFSX	yao_ziyuan	I assume they have decided it is generally the best option.
2010-10-27T08:33:00.000Z	yao_ziyuan	TeruFSX	all right, so my machine which was bought in 2003 is outdated.
