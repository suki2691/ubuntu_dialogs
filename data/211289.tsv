2007-02-07T10:03:00.000Z	bluefox83	gpled	hey i had that issue..sept i was getting speeds of less than 1k
2007-02-07T10:11:00.000Z	gpled	bluefox83	where you able to find a way to speed up downloads?
2007-02-07T10:12:00.000Z	bluefox83	gpled	no...trying to get a faster mirror list..but it doesn't seem to be working in apt-spy, it's gathering the list from debian.org
