2008-06-05T01:26:00.000Z	waffe	crdlb	great! ill try that :) lol after 2 weeks of google and such, thats like the best answer ive had :)
2008-06-05T01:33:00.000Z	waffe	crdlb	well turning off compwiz gets google earth to "work", theres no flicker but the text is absolutely tiny. and now tux doesnt work anymore :) but if its a driver thing then thats that i suppose
