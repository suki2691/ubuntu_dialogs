2008-10-20T01:03:00.000Z	cwill747		why is  my GRUB not working? i got grub error 21 after taking out a hard drive from my comp, then tried to fix it, and now i get grub error 17
2008-10-20T01:05:00.000Z	cwill747		is there any way to get around grub and just boot from my drive?

2008-10-20T01:06:00.000Z	cwill747	Scunizi	yeah but i can't boot into a OS to change it
