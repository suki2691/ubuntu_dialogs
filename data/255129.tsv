2008-01-13T19:14:00.000Z	SBCU		At the moment I'm trying to install a WP1200 and I have found the driver for this wireless network device, the only problem is installing ndisgtk, I can't find it in the Synaptic Package Manager and I can't get on the internet with the specific computer without the WP1200
