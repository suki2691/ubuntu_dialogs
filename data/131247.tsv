2007-08-04T13:42:00.000Z	city-lights		hello, i'm pretty noob, but i have a question: i just installed ubuntu 6.10 (gonna upgrade to 7.04), and each time i issue a restart or shut down, grub refuses to start. I have to shut down the computer from the power button and it works after that
2007-08-04T13:42:00.000Z	city-lights		can you help me?
2007-08-04T13:43:00.000Z	city-lights		i am doing upgrade now....
2007-08-04T13:43:00.000Z	fstxx	city-lights	install 7.04? why waste time solving problems with an older version if you're going to upgrade anyway?
