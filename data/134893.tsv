2010-05-27T20:52:00.000Z	mcl0vin		does this looks ok to you '-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root   41292 2009-07-31 06:55 /usr/bin/passwd'
2010-05-27T20:52:00.000Z	mcl0vin		from what i read this could be a disaster ....any user can run 'passwd' and change the password right?
2010-05-27T20:54:00.000Z	simplexio	mcl0vin	you have correct permission in that file.. and isnt that idea of passwd. that everyone can have their own password
