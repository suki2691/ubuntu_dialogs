2010-07-29T21:12:00.000Z	detritux		hi, I'd like to do a recursive ls in a folder, but to stop at a given level (e.g. : do "ls -R", but stop at first recursive level)
2010-07-29T21:12:00.000Z	detritux		any idea?
2010-07-29T21:13:00.000Z	Docteh	detritux	that sounds like a job for "ls *"
2010-07-29T21:14:00.000Z	detritux	Docteh	I meant maxdepth 2
