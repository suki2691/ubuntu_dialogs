2009-02-13T00:51:00.000Z	Travis-42		is there a good, cheap way to backup files online with linux?  I have previously used mozy (unlimited $5/month) but they don't have a linux client.  Amazon S3 sounds like a nice option, but it'll cost more like $30-40/month.
2009-02-13T00:51:00.000Z	SiDi	Travis-42	did you try through Wine by chance ?
2009-02-13T00:52:00.000Z	Travis-42	SiDi	yea.  I can't get it to work.  It's also reported "garbage" in wine app db.
2009-02-13T00:54:00.000Z	SiDi	Travis-42	don't know then :( the appdb entries are not really looking like there's a chance to make it run :(
