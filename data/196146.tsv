2006-09-23T05:21:00.000Z	progek		I set up an irc server but I can only connect within my network. I am port forwarding in my router but cannot access outside. any ideas? would an ISP block 6667?
2006-09-23T05:21:00.000Z	Overand	progek	do other ports work, like 80?
2006-09-23T05:22:00.000Z	Overand	progek	yes-
2006-09-23T05:22:00.000Z	Overand	progek	make sure the ircD isn't set to only allow connections from your subnet though
