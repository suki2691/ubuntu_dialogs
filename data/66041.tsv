2009-11-15T00:49:00.000Z	cmwslw		any idea why my karmic install on a brand new dell laptop has grub 1.97~beta4 instead of grub2?
2009-11-15T00:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cmwslw	 that is the version for grub2 :)
2009-11-15T00:51:00.000Z	cmwslw	Dr_Willis	ah, i was confused since i didn't see any menu.lst  and only grub2 mod files
2009-11-15T00:51:00.000Z	cmwslw	Dr_Willis	do you know why my default and timeout changes aren't affecting anything then?
