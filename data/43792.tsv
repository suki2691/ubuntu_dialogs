2009-11-03T21:55:00.000Z	fiatlux	hylian	do you mean openal ?
2009-11-03T21:55:00.000Z	hylian		maybe. opengl programs are playing the sounds strange, like very static-y.
2009-11-03T21:56:00.000Z	hylian	fiatlux	most of my vid games that are opengl don't play the sounds right, and torcs didn't wither untill i choose the other option besides opengl
