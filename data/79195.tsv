Advanced Format Technology is being adopted by WD and other drive manufacture
2010-03-21T08:12:00.000Z	Platypus-Man		Your WD Advanced Format hard drive may require you to run the WD Align software utility after you install your operating system or partition and format the drive as a secondary drive. WD Align software aligns partitions on the Advanced Format drive to ensure it provides full performance for certain configurations. (Please see table for configuration details)"
2010-03-21T08:13:00.000Z	Platypus-Man		long quote, sorry... now my question is, though they are _optimized_ for Mac and Windows, will they work on GNU/Linux?
