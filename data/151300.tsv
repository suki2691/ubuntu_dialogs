2007-09-01T16:48:00.000Z	kauer	candyban	seems to be gone now. Oh well. I just wanted to tell hiim that all the character devices work nmore or less the same way, you can open, read write to them etc. Depending on what you want to test, that's often enough. and if you want to test twiddling control lines, well, you really need a real port for that...
