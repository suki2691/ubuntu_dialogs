2005-09-12T06:40:00.000Z	shadeofgrey		i installed k3b and k3blibs and cdrdao -- what else do i need?  kdebase?
2005-09-12T06:40:00.000Z	shadeofgrey		it'll run in a terminal as is, but it outputs tons of errolrs and woint place any icons for launching k3b from apps menu
2005-09-12T06:41:00.000Z	pauldaoust	shadeofgrey	k3b should install all of its dependencies properly and automatically... it looks like K3b doesn't have a menu entry on my computer either.
