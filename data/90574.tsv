2008-05-22T01:45:00.000Z	NW2190	Steve-cal	Ya, but it seems like it forwarding the correct ports and everything.  I can upload normal torrents, just not What.cd ones.
2008-05-22T01:46:00.000Z	Steve-cal	NW2190	I don't use what.cd so if the issue is specific to them I can't be of any help--sorry.
2008-05-22T01:46:00.000Z	NW2190	Steve-cal	ya, I was just wondering if anyone happened to know,
