2010-03-20T18:06:00.000Z	llml_		Anyone: I've got something weird. I could use the telnet command to connect to the wordpress.com on port 80, but got stuck when trying to wget wordpress.com? Will someone help me figure it out?
2010-03-20T18:07:00.000Z	matic	llml_	maybe wordpress servers reject wget as user agent?
2010-03-20T18:07:00.000Z	llml_	matic	not just for wordpress.com, it's just a example, i could not wget nothing:(
2010-03-20T18:09:00.000Z	matic	llml_	what if you try connecting to IP like: http://143.134.12.12/ ?
