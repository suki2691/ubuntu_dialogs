2008-05-03T08:11:00.000Z	hipitihop		I need to reconfigure my xorg.conf and automatically detect card and monitor, how can I do that ?
2008-05-03T08:12:00.000Z	Bodsda	hipitihop	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-05-03T08:13:00.000Z	hipitihop	Bodsda	I have tried that, but it does not seem to detect my card/monitor correctly and only gives me 1024 res instead of 1280x1024 ..... after upgrade to 8.04 it was fine but I tried to enable the legacy nvidia driver and it failed...just want to get back to where I was
