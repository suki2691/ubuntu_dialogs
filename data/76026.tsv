2010-10-10T01:56:00.000Z	jatt		I am using compiz how do I disable gnome-terminal's transparency?
2010-10-10T01:57:00.000Z	Lancelot	jatt	open up the terminal
2010-10-10T01:58:00.000Z	Lancelot	jatt	strange, I don't think compiz controls that
2010-10-10T01:58:00.000Z	Lancelot	jatt	might as well look in there though
