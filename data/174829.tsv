2006-07-15T13:32:00.000Z	billhead		I'm trying to compile MPlayer 1.0 pre8 from source, and for the life of me I can't get xv working. I installed libxv-dev, I've even used ./configure --enable-xv, and it says that xv is an enabled video output, but once I compile and install it, mplayer -vo help doesn't show xv listed.
