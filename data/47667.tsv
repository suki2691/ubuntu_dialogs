2010-02-13T12:37:00.000Z	theadmin	prizer	Yes
2010-02-13T12:37:00.000Z	theadmin	prizer	That is quite offtopic, this is a support channel
2010-02-13T12:39:00.000Z	theadmin	prizer	Well, often after it people start talking about how they are, instead of helping others out which floods the channel. You can chat in #ubuntu-offtopic channel
