2009-09-20T21:17:00.000Z	Mert		*install it
2009-09-20T21:19:00.000Z	geirha	Mert	If it's a tar.bz2 file, then it's a compressed archive. Unpack it and follow the instructions in the README/INSTALL files it continas
2009-09-20T21:20:00.000Z	geirha	Mert	Sure there's no package in the repositories, or a deb package for it? I strongly suggest searching for hat first
