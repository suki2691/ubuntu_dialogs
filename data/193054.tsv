2006-03-29T08:18:00.000Z	IamEthos	edoardo	are you new to linux/
2006-03-29T08:19:00.000Z	edoardo	IamEthos	i put lfs on my laptop four years ago and gentoo on my desktop two years ago : ) and am currently maintainin' a gentoo - freebsd network with a server and nine clients, in a law firm : )
2006-03-29T08:20:00.000Z	edoardo	IamEthos	like i typed, gentoo is the best choice to me, but it takes about two hours to set up. and i only have a weekend to set up seven clients i think. so i'm tempted to use ubuntu : )
