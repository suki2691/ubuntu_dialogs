2011-11-06T18:39:00.000Z	kirvesAxe		after my netbook with 10.04 on it ran out of battery power and shut down, NetworkManager has refused to find any kind of network connections and just says that network is not accessible. Any ideas on how to locate and/or solve the problem?

2011-11-06T18:42:00.000Z	kirvesAxe	Jonii	afaik there isn't a mechanical switch for that
2011-11-06T18:44:00.000Z	Jonii	kirvesAxe	oh, ok. Dunno how common that switch is
