2010-02-08T13:30:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy		Is it "safe" to check the integrity of an external hard drive using a bootable CD running inside a virtual machine?
2010-02-08T13:32:00.000Z	KurtKraut	TheMusicGuy	I wouldn't rely on it. There is an aditional and unexpected layer between the hard disk and the software doing the analysis. This may lead to false negatives.
2010-02-08T13:32:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	KurtKraut	oh, ok.
2010-02-08T13:32:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	KurtKraut	Is there a tool I can use to check the integrity directly?
