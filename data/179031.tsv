2010-09-11T19:10:00.000Z	Wi1d		Hello all. I did an offline install of 10.04.1 server 32-bit. I've now got the server on our network but I cannot install openssh-server. I get this: "The following packages have unmet dependencies" and "openssh-server: Depends: libwrap0 (>= 7.6-4~) but it is not installable". Can't really pastbin since I'm doing this through a KVM.
