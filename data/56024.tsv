2010-01-27T11:22:00.000Z	drunkenangel		I started reading on permission and how to use the ls command to view the permission of the files in a directory, So I know that I need the user www-data to be able to read the directory with the /www folders so I thought I could do su www-data to change to the user and then do chmod 755 folder
