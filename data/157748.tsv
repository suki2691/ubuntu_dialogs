2006-12-11T10:44:00.000Z	neutrinomass	EDinNY	Try #ubuntu+1... it's not beta, it's alpha stage
2006-12-11T10:45:00.000Z	EDinNY	neutrinomass	So, if ZNnet was going to do a FAIR story on ubuntu, you would recommend a different version?
2006-12-11T10:45:00.000Z	neutrinomass	EDinNY	definitely. feisty is 5 months away from release or so .... edgy would probably be the best choice
