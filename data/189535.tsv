2011-09-15T17:05:00.000Z	psyke		hello, sorry to bother you guys, I was just wondering what should I know before upgrading to 11.10 when the time comes. what I mean to say is that I've customized my classic gnome a lot. will it get overwritten by new settings in 11.10? apart from this is any thing else I should expect to fix?
