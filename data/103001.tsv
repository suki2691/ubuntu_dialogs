2009-04-29T12:56:00.000Z	generalsnus		Hi guys! i'm uploading about 15-20 videos each day for my students, they are posted on a webpage embedded + a dl link. It gets quite tendious to generate new entries/links as these: http://paste2.org/p/194279  the videos are named like this: (todays date/1-6/1-6) "290409_1_1.wmv" the only variables during a day are the 2 last numbers and video title(20 uniqe
2009-04-29T12:56:00.000Z	generalsnus		Is there a easier way to make/generate new links.. a way to almost automate this job?
