2006-09-10T08:04:00.000Z	donaldGuy		hello.. I'm having a strange dependency problem with package totem-xine.. my goal was to get video support in firefox.. I could describe the problem in words .. but its just as easy to show the problem .. so I have pastebin'd it here http://www.copypot.com/675
2006-09-10T08:05:00.000Z	donaldGuy		essientially the problem is that it wants to remove ubuntu-desktop .. which I'd assume would be bad
2006-09-10T08:05:00.000Z	donaldGuy		well it also wants to remove totem
