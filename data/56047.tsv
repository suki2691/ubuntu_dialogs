2011-02-04T21:57:00.000Z	gabeh		hello, I'm using Ubuntu 10.10.  It has erlang installed, I see it in /usr/lib/erlang.  I can use the command 'erl' everywhere leading me to believe it is in a path variable somewhere. Unfortunately I'm too noob to know where it could be other than $Path, which it isn't in of course.  Do you have any ideas how I can tell where the /usr/lib/erlang directory is referred to?
