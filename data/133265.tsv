2010-09-20T23:53:00.000Z	Penguinista		I was wondering, is this some-kind of Gnome drawback or something else, why I cannot install two applications at the same time?
2010-09-20T23:54:00.000Z	Flare183	Penguinista	Nope its a apt-get security thing
2010-09-20T23:55:00.000Z	Penguinista	Flare183	apt-get security thing? How?
2010-09-20T23:56:00.000Z	Flare183	Penguinista	Its a fail safe, to where no one can install two conflicting packages at the same time
