2008-04-16T03:38:00.000Z	Traveler8		Ok Let me re-ask my question another way.  How do I change the driver in ubuntu when it is   .exe
2008-04-16T03:39:00.000Z	Traveler8		bye the way obotu, thank you
2008-04-16T03:39:00.000Z	unop_	Traveler8	you need to get the drivers in the form of a .inf and .sys file -- perhaps you need to unpack that .exe - try unzip and/or cabextract
2008-04-16T03:41:00.000Z	unop_	Traveler8	well, look on driverguide.com -- see if you can find the drivers in an alternate package
