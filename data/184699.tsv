I want to know if you can mount network drives to folders my idea is to have a lamp server and share the folers for things such as /var/ftp /var/www  also i would like to know if the widescreen bug has been fixed if it has all 3 of my computers will be running ubuntu

2006-05-27T12:54:00.000Z	CharlesE	Frogzoo	I am already networked :) it was soo easy with ubuntu but I just want to know if you can mount the network folders to other folders
