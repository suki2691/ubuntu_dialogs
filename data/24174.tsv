2012-03-04T15:09:00.000Z	icehunter		I've googled now for around an hour... Can u please tell me, how do i copy MULTIPLE directories (with files) from one place to another directory, not touching plain files in the first place

2012-03-04T15:10:00.000Z	KM0201	icehunter	assuming these aren't directories protected by root... cp -r /path to/ /path/to/... nevermind, i see L3top beat me
2012-03-04T15:13:00.000Z	KM0201	icehunter	so you want to copy the folders, but not the data in them?
