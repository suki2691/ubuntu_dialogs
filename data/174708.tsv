2011-06-20T11:13:00.000Z	Mindspider		Can somebody help me please? I updated from 10.10 to 11.04 and now .avi files hosted on divx websites won't play in the browser, media player or VLC.
2011-06-20T11:14:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	Mindspider	did you re-install the ubuntu-restricted-extras?
2011-06-20T11:15:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	Mindspider	since they aren't part of the normal package Ubuntu will often times disable the extras stuff; install the stock stuff and leave it to you to update the restricted stuff ..
