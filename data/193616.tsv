2006-07-26T11:35:00.000Z	dandesousa		Urgent help needed!: My hdd which had ubuntu on it died, now when I boot up, grub gets an error, can I remove grub, and have it just boot windows normally?

2006-07-26T11:37:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	dandesousa	just boot with the windows install cd, get in rescue mode and type fixmbr -- should get you going.
