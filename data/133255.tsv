2007-09-29T06:17:00.000Z	Skiff		hello, I was wondering if its necessary to keep /boot on a seperate partition or not?
2007-09-29T06:17:00.000Z	AndrewB	Skiff	nope, can keep it on your main partition
2007-09-29T06:29:00.000Z	AndrewB	Skiff	It doesn't matter really.
2007-09-29T06:30:00.000Z	Skiff	AndrewB	and murkyMurk ok but swap should be in the end and / should be in the beginning correct all primaries as well
