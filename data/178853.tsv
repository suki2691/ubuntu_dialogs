2007-09-25T06:01:00.000Z	jrib	jim	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment is a pretty good summary.  Releases are made every 6 months (april for *.04 and october for *.10)
2007-09-25T06:02:00.000Z	jim	jrib	at the beginning of that period, what do you have and where do you get it? are you completely going from the standpoint of ubuntu old releases?
2007-09-25T06:02:00.000Z	jrib	jim	they sync up with debian unstable.  #ubuntu-motu might get you better answers
