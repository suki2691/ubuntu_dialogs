2005-12-07T11:22:00.000Z	afabian	lsuactiafner	yeah; it's "supported" even, since Windows XP offers to upgrade over Win2k without converting.  You haven't done something "totally bizarre" in some ways if you have to hit MSFT support.
2005-12-07T11:23:00.000Z	afabian	lsuactiafner	you just lose every advantage of NTFS.  They're significant.  Speed, security, better fault-tolerance... so, it works as well as any FAT32 system ever did. ;)
