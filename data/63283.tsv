2011-08-24T12:22:00.000Z	Duelisti		I have 10.04 netbook edition and I'm trying to figure out how to install namebar (0.5) for it. I'm only able to find tar.gz files and I don't know how to install them. Help?
2011-08-24T12:23:00.000Z	Lint	Duelisti	unpack, configure, compile, install
2011-08-24T12:26:00.000Z	Lint	Duelisti	no, just extract the folder looking like 'somename-1.2.3'
2011-08-24T12:28:00.000Z	Lint	Duelisti	then inspect it contents and see if 'configure' is present
