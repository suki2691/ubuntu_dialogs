2011-05-08T04:45:00.000Z	thomi_		Hi - I'm having some odd problems with Ubity - I cannot resize any Qt applications at all - I can maximise, minimise and restore them, but cannot resize them with the mouse. Any ideas?
2011-05-08T04:45:00.000Z	thomi_		this happens with big applications and is reproducable with a 5-line c++/Qt application.
