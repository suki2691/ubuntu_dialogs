2007-01-28T14:54:00.000Z	blanky		how come when I do "sudo apt-get remove libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dri" it tries to uninstall 656 mb of packages?
2007-01-28T14:56:00.000Z	blanky		I already have fglrx
2007-01-28T14:57:00.000Z	blanky		because before, I tried to remove the fglrx driver and installing the mesa stuff, then I installed fglrx back on and now I'm getting that error, I figured it was the mesa stuff I hadn't removed yet
