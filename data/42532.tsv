2010-08-13T23:39:00.000Z	mooglenorph	aeon-ltd	is there any changelog or diff or something that I could consult? to see what the differences actually are between UNR and normal ubuntu? because it would be way less hassle to not have to remove this stuff.

2010-08-13T23:40:00.000Z	mooglenorph	aeon-ltd	yeah, I've been looking at that... I was hoping for a centralized, summary type thing
