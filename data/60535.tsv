2009-05-04T19:46:00.000Z	wad		I folks. I'm running ubuntu on my laptop that has 4GB of RAM, but I think the OS is only seeing 3GB. What's a good way to check this?
2009-05-04T19:48:00.000Z	wad		Okay then, ubuntu is only seeing 3 GB of RAM, when I've got 4 in the machine. What's wrong?
2009-05-04T19:48:00.000Z	nztal	wad	i believe you are correct, in that it only seeing roughly about 3GB.  you'd need to enable PAE and i'm not sure what packages to apt-get to enable that in the desktop version to enable that, maybe someone else might
2009-05-04T19:49:00.000Z	wad	nztal	okay... so I need to do something special to get it to see the memory? That seems wrong somehow....
