2010-07-14T12:57:00.000Z	coz_	Terminal_Velocit	 not sure about ati since I mainly deal with nvidia however let me post what we have in #compiz....    Radeon 7000 (or M6). For 7000 to HD4xxx series cards, you can use the open source "radeon" driver. HD2xxx and later series cards are also supported by the proprietary "fglrx" driver.
