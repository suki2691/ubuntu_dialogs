2007-03-21T16:29:00.000Z	hans0lo		I'm on an Ubuntu Edgy AMD64 system. Trying to get Flash9 to work. I followed some instructions involving nspluginwrapper, and 32-bit libs, but firefox doesn't see the plugins listed at all under about:plugins. What is the recommended method of Flash on AMD64?
2007-03-21T16:30:00.000Z	variant	hans0lo	set up a 32bit chroot
2007-03-21T16:30:00.000Z	hans0lo	variant	and run firefox form a chroot?
2007-03-21T16:31:00.000Z	variant	hans0lo	no
