2009-01-06T21:19:00.000Z	_dennister		hey channel: need some help with totem on a new installation: it keeps crashing right away after I try to get it to play a commercial dvd...have libdvdcss2 installed and tons of plugins, and totem does work with a flash video i downloaded for testing,...anyone available to help me test/troubleshoot/fix?
2009-01-06T21:20:00.000Z	_dennister		oh, and i've also already tried purging and reinstalling totem...still keeps crashing
