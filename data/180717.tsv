2006-06-09T12:06:00.000Z	goibhniu		am i likely to get stuck if I upgrade from breezy to dapper using my ndiswrapper driven wireless card?
2006-06-09T12:08:00.000Z	goibhniu		does anyone know if dist-upgrade downloads everything it needs before starting to upgrade or upgrades and downloads at the same time?

2006-06-09T12:09:00.000Z	goibhniu	dixie	cheers, so I shouldn't have any trouble if it doesn't set up my wifi card during the upgrade I'll still have a working system
