2008-06-27T00:44:00.000Z	TiZ_		Hi. My PS2 gamepad is working flawlessly in Windows games run in Wine. But Linux native games are oblivious to it. How can I fix this?
2008-06-27T00:45:00.000Z	TiZ_		Can anyone help me with my gamepad dilemma? Half the time I come here I just get ignored. Please don't disappoint me again.
2008-06-27T00:47:00.000Z	TiZ_		Sorry. I've tried to be patient in the past, and I was disregarded completely. I just don't want it to happen agian.
