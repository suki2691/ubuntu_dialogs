2008-03-15T11:02:00.000Z	Aprilis		Hello, can someone please recommend me the best and most stable (as in, doesn't crash like, ever) and easiest to use and figure out (so not Cinerella) movie editor?
2008-03-15T11:03:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Aprilis	I use kino, but it's not 100% crashproof ..
2008-03-15T11:03:00.000Z	Aprilis	zcat[1]	  How often does it crash and would it pick up where I left off before crashing or would I have to start over?
2008-03-15T11:04:00.000Z	zcat[1]	Aprilis	no, just save fairly often so you don't lose too much. Not sure, it might be a lot better now. Been a while since I last did and editing
