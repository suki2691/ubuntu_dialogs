2007-10-28T05:19:00.000Z	razorbuzz2		Good evening. Is anybody aware of a way to perform a headless install?  I've found a few sites with information, but they all assume there is an existing install that is being replaced. I have a new HD in a headless machine (and no display availble) and need to perform an install. Thoughts? Ideas? Concepts?
2007-10-28T05:20:00.000Z	Pelo	razorbuzz2	 can you remove into the machine ? I thknk you can do that
