2005-08-23T12:52:00.000Z	titaniululz		if i just want to call "/etc/init.d/proftpd start" on boot, what would be the easiest way?
2005-08-23T12:52:00.000Z	vitriol	titaniululz	install rcconf :)
2005-08-23T12:53:00.000Z	vitriol	titaniululz	you can control what is started during bootup with rcconf...
2005-08-23T12:53:00.000Z	titaniululz	vitriol	i can do it manually just as easily i guess
