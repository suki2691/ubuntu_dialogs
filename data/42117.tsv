2009-11-30T02:57:00.000Z	jhaig		I'm looking to set up an extremely simple laptop for an elderly gentleman so that he can just write letters.  The machine is very low spec (700MHz and 384Mb memory).  Is XFCE still the most lightweight desktop?  Is there a very simple Ubuntu variant, for this sort of thing?
