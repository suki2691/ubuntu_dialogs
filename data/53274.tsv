2009-07-02T16:52:00.000Z	discorpia		isn't there anyone here who has used ubuntu long enough and can tell me how to turn of all the automatic bullsh*t it does when starting xorg? i want to use an old plain xorg.conf but everything seems to get overridden
2009-07-02T16:53:00.000Z	discorpia		my apologies
2009-07-02T16:53:00.000Z	ziroday	discorpia	and if you're xorg.conf is defined correctly it will be used
2009-07-02T16:54:00.000Z	discorpia	ziroday	and if it's not shouldn't it atleast tell me? i've used all EDID-disabling switches i've found, even tried some deprecated ones, but it still ignores all monitor modes etc and uses EDID to (wrongly) identify the monitor
