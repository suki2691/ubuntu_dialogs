2006-06-28T10:06:00.000Z	RaeDr		I have a little problem: Whenever I plug my iPod in, Rhythmbox starts up. How can I tell it to shoo?
2006-06-28T10:08:00.000Z	RaeDr		iPod is solved, thanks
2006-06-28T10:10:00.000Z	RaeDr		Is there a difference in the end system when installing with the Desktop or Alternate CD?
