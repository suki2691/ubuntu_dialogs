2012-04-29T04:09:00.000Z	Watcher|2		Trying to watch videos on Firefox on Kubuntu, some play, many do not. The videos that don't play on Firefox do play on Chrome. Can someone please tell me how to get all youtube videos to play on Firefox?

2012-04-29T04:10:00.000Z	Watcher|2	Jordan_U	Is there a wy to tell?
