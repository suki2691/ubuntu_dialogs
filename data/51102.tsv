2010-11-15T08:45:00.000Z	DrManhattan	nixnoob	meaning I want to be able to slide apps from one screen to another
2010-11-15T08:45:00.000Z	DrManhattan		this can't be THAT difficult, windows does this kind of stuff by default with nvidia cards
2010-11-15T08:46:00.000Z	nixnoob	DrManhattan	that cannot be done if you set them up as separate X servers, you'd have to open the app you want on the screen you want it on.
