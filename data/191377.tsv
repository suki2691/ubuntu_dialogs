2007-02-27T14:24:00.000Z	CoRnJuLiOx		i just turned on my PC after coming home from school to find out that my desktop has mysteriously resized itself to 640 x 480 and refuses to change to anything else
2007-02-27T14:24:00.000Z	CoRnJuLiOx		i recall that this could be a driver issue, but it was working fine before this and i don't remember how to check if my nvidia drivers are loaded

2007-02-27T14:25:00.000Z	AlexC_	CoRnJuLiOx	that's for ATI and nVidia, check it out
