2009-06-10T07:45:00.000Z	ultmate		Is there anything I could do? It seems to me that the FLASH Plugin isn't recognized by Mozilla no matter what I do...
2009-06-10T07:45:00.000Z	Blz	ultmate	 how are you trying to install the flash plugin?
2009-06-10T07:45:00.000Z	Blz	ultmate	 are you just using the browser?
2009-06-10T07:46:00.000Z	Blz	ultmate	 did you get that?
