2008-08-07T06:22:00.000Z	MrPickle		dozedonlinux, yes- and I added it to the modprobe successfully, but that blacklist for bcm43xx was not put in place until after ndiswrapper failed to be added
2008-08-07T06:23:00.000Z	MrPickle		kaiwan, just re-blacklisted bcm43xx and restarting, going to redo the packages for ndiswrapper
2008-08-07T06:25:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	MrPickle	best guide i've seen for bcm43xx and ndiswrapper, except i used my drivers from linksys instead of wht they said: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx/Feisty_No-Fluff
