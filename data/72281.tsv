2009-05-25T11:49:00.000Z	Finnish		The card shows up in lspci.
2009-05-25T11:52:00.000Z	Finnish	uberadm	I think I have now the madwifi-driver enabled, but previously my wlan worked just fine without it. It seems wlan has dropped for some reason
2009-05-25T11:52:00.000Z	uberadm	Finnish	I also had trouble with my atheros wireless card on first install, but the madwifi driver fixed that
