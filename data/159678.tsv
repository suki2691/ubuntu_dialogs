2010-03-14T08:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hipitihop	 enable the -src repos , update package list, and try again
2010-03-14T08:22:00.000Z	hipitihop	Dr_Willis	enabling the src repos did the trick, thanks.
2010-03-26T17:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hipitihop	 i saw an issue like that ages ago.. but not since betatesting.   It might be a compiz related issue.
