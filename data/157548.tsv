2007-05-13T08:41:00.000Z	ethereality		Hey, I got a quick question ...
2007-05-13T08:41:00.000Z	ethereality		Can there be multiple packages of the same name in different repositories?
2007-05-13T08:42:00.000Z	ethereality		or is this ntfs-3g package the right one because it's the only one?
2007-05-13T08:42:00.000Z	mjunx	ethereality	yeah, but that could break things if they're not the same actual package (and not just different versions of it)
