2010-02-27T00:33:00.000Z	guntbert	cellofellow	thats exactly what I wanted to say - didn't see your reply before - hence the apology
2010-02-27T00:34:00.000Z	cellofellow	guntbert	no worries
2010-02-27T00:35:00.000Z	guntbert	cellofellow	:-) (I prefer -i, *because* it sets the complete environment ...)
