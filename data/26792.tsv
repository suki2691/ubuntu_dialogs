2011-08-16T12:59:00.000Z	NicheOWAT		hey guys, I need some help with my dual booting. Earlier today I ran the Windows installer on my Drive E:, I decided to use the Live CD disk to overwrite the entire Drive E: and install Ubuntu that way instead. When I boot my comptuer now and have the option to boot Windows 7 or Ubuntu, when I select Ubuntu I now get an error
2011-08-16T13:00:00.000Z	NicheOWAT		I think it's still trying to boot the Windows installed partition even though I created a new one, how do I go about fixing this? I'm such a noob
2011-08-16T13:01:00.000Z	NicheOWAT		I'm in Windows 7 now fyi
