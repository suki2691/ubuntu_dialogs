2008-02-02T12:37:00.000Z	dessnr		ok what am i doing wrong, i hold ctrl-alt and left mouse.  an effect does work, but it is not a cube even though i have cube turned on in the prefs...  it's more like a page flip to the next desktop...  i can turn the desktop around as slow and as fast as i want with left mouse held, but there is no cube.
2008-02-02T12:39:00.000Z	dessnr		does anybody have knowledge on how to get the cube working please?

2008-02-02T12:41:00.000Z	Daisuke_Ido	dessnr	oh, it works
