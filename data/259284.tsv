2005-04-25T16:48:00.000Z	MistaED		ok i really need some help here: i have a dir with a control.tar.gz, a data.tar.gz and a debian-binary
2005-04-25T16:48:00.000Z	MistaED		how do i combine it into a deb?
2005-04-25T16:48:00.000Z	MistaED		can i simply make a tar of it all and rename it to deb or..?
2005-04-25T16:50:00.000Z	Burgundavia	MistaED	deb is far more complicated than that
