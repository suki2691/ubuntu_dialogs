2008-03-01T10:17:00.000Z	berlylabs		have tried tutorials for installing java and I think it's installed but still not working
2008-03-01T10:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	berlylabs	 depends on the game. Ive gotten many to work with wine.
2008-03-01T10:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	berlylabs	  if its a downloadeable/exexutable - it may work with wine. Other then that.. good luck. :) ive seen a lot that DONT work with wine also. since they are some how flash-based in a weird way
