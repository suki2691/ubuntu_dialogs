2008-10-26T18:39:00.000Z	velko	Cool-Nick	why worry if they don't come trough?
2008-10-26T18:41:00.000Z	Cool-Nick	velko	ï»¿I'm just asking if these hits are harmful or dangerous
2008-10-26T18:42:00.000Z	velko	Cool-Nick	no. the firewall blocked them. but you can lookup if the hits target any particular port. this may give you hints what happens if you dual boot any other operating system on this computer
