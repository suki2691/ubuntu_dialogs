2011-03-17T17:19:00.000Z	KramB		I am trying to make this .sh file executable I do "chmod +x file.sh" and when I try to execute it, it says cannot execute.  It is a compiler for java files, any help?
2011-03-17T17:19:00.000Z	coz_	KramB	  the easy way is to right click the file ...go to properties / permissions  and make it executeable
2011-03-17T17:23:00.000Z	coz_	KramB	 what is this file for?
