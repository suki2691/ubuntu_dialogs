2006-11-09T10:41:00.000Z	genon		I have the very common problem with nvidia and it only displaying 800x600, edited the xorg.conf, and 1600x1200 is in the front, tried to reconfigure xorg.conf and it still doesn't work
2006-11-09T10:42:00.000Z	cherubiel	genon	do you have the drivesr installed properly?
2006-11-09T10:42:00.000Z	genon	cherubiel	yeah, i have the nvidia setting in the system tool-bar
2006-11-09T10:43:00.000Z	genon	cherubiel	got the display up to 1600x1200, but after i restarted x trying to fix my Hz not synching right it went back to zero
