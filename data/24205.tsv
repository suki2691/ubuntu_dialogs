2011-07-04T05:13:00.000Z	newblet		Hi, I had a question and was wondering if someone could help
2011-07-04T05:14:00.000Z	newblet		alright, well I am running Ubuntu 10.10 on an HP DM1Z (Which has many problems out of the box with ubuntu) and I have this AMD unsupported Hardware wtaermark on the bottom right of my screen, that I was wondering how do I remove it
2011-07-04T05:15:00.000Z	newblet		it appeared here once I installed the additional drivers
2011-07-04T05:15:00.000Z	KM0201	newblet	never heard of that
