Whenever I come to the support channel I get douchebags telling me why I shouldn't be here more than I get people willing to answer a fucking question. I DIDN'T REALIZE THEY COULD BLOCK ME FROM DOWNLOADING TORRENT FILES ONLY. How the fuck was I supposed to know that they can make it so it says it's downloading, while remaining at 0Kb/s? This is what support is for, assholes. N
