2011-06-26T00:55:00.000Z	ckiraly		i'm trying to figure out where my cdrom is located in ubuntu so I can map it to WINE ( since its not auto detecting )
2011-06-26T00:56:00.000Z	ckiraly		missed that Blues - nothing in media shows my cdrom
2011-06-26T00:56:00.000Z	iridium	ckiraly	your cdrom must be mounted to be shown
2011-06-26T00:58:00.000Z	iridium	ckiraly	if it is cdaudio then isn't mounted
