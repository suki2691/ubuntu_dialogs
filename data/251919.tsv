2007-07-21T10:04:00.000Z	holycow	MajorPayne	as long as the chipset is supported
2007-07-21T10:05:00.000Z	holycow		if you have a super new motherboard with a brand new chipset that doesn't have drivers, then no
2007-07-21T10:05:00.000Z	MajorPayne	holycow	Same chip set as the old one (The old one busted) but still a different motherboard.
