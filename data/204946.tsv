2007-02-23T10:56:00.000Z	Hostis		need to ask something. What is the difference of 6.10 server and 6.06 LTS ?
2007-02-23T10:57:00.000Z	macd	Hostis	LTS is considered to be more stable, and is supported long term, also commercially by canonical.
2007-02-23T10:58:00.000Z	macd	Hostis	anytime you need something for use in a"production" enviornment 6.06.01LTS is the way to go.
