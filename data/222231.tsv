2006-01-05T07:57:00.000Z	TraceGreen		Hello, can ubuntu install on a pc whose memory just 64M?
2006-01-05T07:57:00.000Z	TraceGreen		xubuntu?
2006-01-05T07:58:00.000Z	intelikey	TraceGreen	you'd want to install server   the gui is a bit heavy for 64m  but it can run.
2006-01-05T08:00:00.000Z	intelikey	TraceGreen	you won't get any satisfaction out of running ubunut and gimp on a box with 64m ram   it can be done but it will be into swap all the time...... bad idea.
