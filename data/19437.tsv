2011-01-31T14:54:00.000Z	eshm		anyone in here use docky?
2011-01-31T14:55:00.000Z	eshm		not really an issue k4g6, do you use chrome as well?
2011-01-31T14:56:00.000Z	eshm		i'm wondering if there was a way to add those fancy "application shortcuts" to docky as a separate "instance" if you will to the docky separate from chromes existence if that makes any sense
