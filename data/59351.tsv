2009-10-27T17:31:00.000Z	kristjan		Hello, could someone help me please? I'm getting the "Video mode not supported" error at bootup. The solution should lie in the monitor HZ which I should be able to change through xorg.conf but there's nothing there.
2009-10-27T17:32:00.000Z	indus	kristjan	use recovery mode, then run a dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2009-10-27T17:33:00.000Z	kristjan	indus	that's ctrl+alt+f1, right?
2009-10-27T17:39:00.000Z	kristjan	indus	I went to the console (?) (ctrl+alt+f1) and typed "dpkg -reconfigure xserver -xorg" but nothing happened.
