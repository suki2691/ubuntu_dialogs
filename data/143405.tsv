2007-05-02T13:47:00.000Z	RichiH		is there a netinstall CD of ubuntu?
2007-05-02T13:48:00.000Z	RichiH		my problem is, that the pc i am trying to install kubuntu on seems not to cope well with _any_ cd i burn
2007-05-02T13:48:00.000Z	RichiH		i suspect that it is a kernel vs cdrom issue
2007-05-02T13:48:00.000Z	rohinton	RichiH	I have that same problem, :-( dell 260...
