2007-09-15T06:50:00.000Z	Robbster		 hi all. I'm running Ubuntu Feisty on my laptop. Earlier 2day, sound was fine, I suspended the machine and now I have no sound. I've rebooted, as well as restarting alsa. Any ideas?

2007-09-15T06:52:00.000Z	Robbster	savvas	tried that. I don't need to restart anything/log in between changing the device? anyway, there wa no change. all the volume levels are high.
2007-09-15T06:55:00.000Z	savvas	Robbster	that's the point of tribe releases, reporting bugs :)
