2011-05-20T18:54:00.000Z	quick-	anthony_dev	sudo -i
2011-05-20T18:55:00.000Z	quick-	anthony_dev	sudo -i will give you root acces in a terminal .type in a terminal
2011-05-20T19:11:00.000Z	anthony_dev	quick-	http://i.imgur.com/iBp2o.png not in terminal, but in a whole system. by pressing this "key" icon I can logout from this mode and become simple user. I see this key appears when I change network params and stuff like that. but I think it will be usefull to know how to do that by myself
