2009-06-30T18:08:00.000Z	djiezes		Anyone can tell me if we should expect the Firefox update (3.5) - which comes today - to appear in Jaunty's default repositories? If so, today? Later? Or will we have to wait for Ubuntu 9.10?
2009-06-30T18:09:00.000Z	sipior	djiezes	i believe it's slated for 9.10.
2009-06-30T18:10:00.000Z	djiezes	sipior	so the current FF 3.0.11 won't update itself to 3.5 in this Ubuntu release? Will they convert the current 3.5 beta package to final then?
2009-06-30T18:10:00.000Z	sipior	djiezes	i've no idea.
