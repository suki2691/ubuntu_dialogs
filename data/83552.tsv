2008-08-13T08:49:00.000Z	qr	fallore	why can't you edit xorg.conf from the ctrl+alt+f2 terminal?
2008-08-13T08:49:00.000Z	fallore	qr	it's not graphical to my knowledge, and i only know the terminal command to open it graphically.
2008-08-13T08:49:00.000Z	qr	fallore	ahh, use nano or pico or vim or emacs to edit it in a terminal
