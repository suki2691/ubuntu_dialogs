2006-09-04T15:37:00.000Z	iMeow		hi everyone, i've a bit of a question regarding swaping files between windows and linux
2006-09-04T15:38:00.000Z	iMeow		i have a usb memory stick that i use to lug my website around so i can work on it at work, and it works great :D but only problem is when i bring the files back home, they lose all file permissions they once had and only keep "owner" permissions.  so i have to manually set permissions again before my files will work in linux. my memory stick uses FAT32, any way around that?
2006-09-04T15:40:00.000Z	iMeow		will windows 2000 be able to read ext2 natively?
