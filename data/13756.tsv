2011-07-26T05:37:00.000Z	edbian	lapaga	what?
2011-07-26T05:39:00.000Z	lapaga	edbian	just mean that most apps that the average person uses will not really be helped by using 64 bit over 32 bit...but...as the world turns and things progress 64 bit will probably be the 32 bit of today
2011-07-26T05:39:00.000Z	edbian	lapaga	I agree
