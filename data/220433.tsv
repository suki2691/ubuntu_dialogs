2008-07-26T08:07:00.000Z	maynard		Would anyone be able to help me figure out why my Update Manager stopped working? I'm using 6.10 if that helps at all... Every time i try to update or upgrade it tells me "Could not download all repository indexes", and suggests i check my connection.. which is fine
2008-07-26T08:07:00.000Z	Flannel	maynard	Because 6.10 is no longer supported.
2008-07-26T08:07:00.000Z	Flannel	maynard	(and the repositories have gone down)
