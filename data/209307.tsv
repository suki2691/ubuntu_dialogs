2006-10-16T16:34:00.000Z	kralcymerej		can anyone help me get a .asx streaming audio file to stream? Im running streamtuner and it just dosn't seem to be cutting it?
2006-10-16T16:35:00.000Z	kralcymerej		also, as a complete newbie to linux what is the "best" media player to use (I'm using xmss and it seems ok but...)?
2006-10-16T16:36:00.000Z	LjL	kralcymerej	what's wrong with the included one?
2006-10-16T16:37:00.000Z	LjL	kralcymerej	you have Rhythmbox, for audio, and Totem, for audio/video, included. if they're there, it's probably because they're thought to be the easiest for newcomers
