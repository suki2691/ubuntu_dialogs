2009-06-04T03:59:00.000Z	twistedlndscapes		Hello. I'm a newb with a question if anyone has a second to assist :)
2009-06-04T04:00:00.000Z	twistedlndscapes		I installed apache on ubuntu 9.04 install I just did. It starts fine but not on boot. Most googling I did said to install the server of the OS as it's defaulted but I did the desktop version :(
2009-06-04T04:01:00.000Z	cabrey	twistedlndscapes	you need to add it to the boot up sequence
2009-06-04T04:01:00.000Z	cabrey	twistedlndscapes	look in System > Administration > Services
