2008-07-17T10:09:00.000Z	Blade_Wizard_Fal		i am looking for a way to have a music player ( i currently use Rhythmbox) on random/shuffle, but still allow for manually selecting the next song, or even creating a playlist, then going back to random when the playlist is empty...anyone know if this is possible, and how?
