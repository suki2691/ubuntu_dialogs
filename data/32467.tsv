2010-05-05T18:32:00.000Z	theadmin	`Panda	Yup yup, exactly. For instance vimeo is BLEH, does hardly run at all, while youtube is perfect.
2010-05-05T18:33:00.000Z	`Panda	theadmin	you managed to get it working or? have had to resort to chrome for the time being for some sites but would prefer it all to be on firefox!
2010-05-05T18:34:00.000Z	theadmin	`Panda	Meh, didn't really bother since I rarely use flash
