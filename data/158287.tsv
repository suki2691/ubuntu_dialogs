2008-12-26T15:13:00.000Z	Ash-Fox		Can somebody tell me where I can get the ext2 defrag tool is? I can't seem to find it in Ubuntu distros.

2008-12-26T15:15:00.000Z	Slart	Ash-Fox	I haven't seen anything new since that one.. just don't fill your ext3 volumes up and it will be fine
2008-12-26T15:15:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	Slart	I'm looking for the tool, not advice on how to use ext3.
