2008-06-06T08:27:00.000Z	Flannel	zm635	No.  you don't want to log in as root, and even if you did, there are better ways.
2008-06-06T08:43:00.000Z	Flannel	zm635	You can set autologin, even with a password
2008-06-06T08:44:00.000Z	Flannel	zm635	If everything was secure, yes.  But its best to keep people out just incase there's some bug.
