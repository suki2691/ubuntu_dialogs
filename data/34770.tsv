2010-03-31T23:45:00.000Z	iamnotaguest		I was looking at python, but is that really suitable?
2010-03-31T23:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	iamnotaguest	looked at mono implementation of ASP.NET ?
2010-03-31T23:47:00.000Z	iamnotaguest	erUSUL	I know there's mono, but I want something better supported accross servers.
