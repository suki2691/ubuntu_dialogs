2008-03-09T20:04:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo		hey guys, im trying to get on to apache from an outside network, but i think my isp blocks port 80 and/or 443, any idea what good ports to use are
2008-03-09T20:04:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo		ive tried different ones, but they still only seem to work in network
2008-03-09T20:05:00.000Z	kenny	ForzaPalermo	try 8080, its a common one
2008-03-09T20:05:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	kenny	leave the 443?
