2009-01-26T04:28:00.000Z	tweak66		i'm having an issue expaning my ext3 filesystem.. it's the one ubuntu is on. even if i goot with the gparted liveCD it won't let me extend it.. there's unallocated space right beside it.. can't format another partition, i already have 4.. doesn't allow me to make extended file system either
2009-01-26T04:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tweak66	are you running gparted with gksudo?
2009-01-26T04:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tweak66	make sure you run it with gksudo from a terminal
2009-01-26T04:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tweak66	gksudo gedit
