2011-02-10T05:47:00.000Z	Heroo	Nisstyre	so I gather. I'm a bit overwhelmed right now, but I'm trying to take things slow and really get to the core of it:)
2011-02-10T05:47:00.000Z	Nisstyre	Heroo	you're best finding instructions to specific problems you're having
2011-02-10T05:49:00.000Z	Heroo	Nisstyre	I'm not going to try and learn *everything*, but I read as much as I can so I can to get familiar with things. and, seeing the big picture, as you've said above:)
