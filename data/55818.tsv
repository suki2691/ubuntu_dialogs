2009-06-01T17:25:00.000Z	tiyowan	wraith0x2b	Could you please clarify your problem?
2009-06-01T17:28:00.000Z	wraith0x2b	tiyowan	I already had a linux installed, whit it's own grub and menu.lst. I installed ubuntu and grub reinstalled over my old one, so it gets it's files from my new ubuntu partition. if I decide to remove ubuntu I won't be able to boot again. so I want the old grub back. easy task?
