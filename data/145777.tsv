2007-12-28T19:11:00.000Z	fadey		Hi. I'm missing /dev/disk directory after the kernel update. Can't use new kernel. Does anyone know how I could fix that?
2007-12-28T19:12:00.000Z	|Z_E_R_O|	fadey	 maybe now that directory has another name
2007-12-28T19:14:00.000Z	fadey	|Z_E_R_O|	/dev/disk/by-UUID is on that path. Now kernel can't find my root partition
2007-12-28T19:14:00.000Z	|Z_E_R_O|	fadey	... i don't know sorry
