2008-09-12T18:43:00.000Z	jrib	ivo	this is #ubuntu.  Did you mean to ask in the channel for your programming language?
2008-09-12T18:44:00.000Z	ivo	jrib	no, but i programming in ubuntu
2008-09-12T18:45:00.000Z	jrib	ivo	well you didn't tell anyone what language you are programming in and gave no context, so it would be pretty hard to help you here.  If you do just have a programming question though, it's better to ask in the channel for the language you are programming in
