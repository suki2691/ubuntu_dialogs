2006-11-12T06:50:00.000Z	lullabud	bogdan_kg	 you could try using one mouse to move the cursor, and another mouse to click the buttons!
2006-11-12T06:51:00.000Z	lullabud	bogdan_kg	 just plug in another mouse!  it'll instantly be recognized, and it'll work for moving the cursor!
2006-11-12T06:51:00.000Z	lullabud	bogdan_kg	 you could hold one mouse with your left hand, then move the cursor with your right foot!
