2008-09-15T05:26:00.000Z	macd	JackCSG	the nvidia binary driver supports it
2008-09-15T05:27:00.000Z	macd	JackCSG	Im pretty sure hardware accel works I have a 8600GT
2008-09-15T05:29:00.000Z	JackCSG	macd	I read that the July Nvidia driver started to support the 8600gt for linux,  Would I have to wait on a similar update or should I look at a new graphics card?
