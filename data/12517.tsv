2011-10-30T06:58:00.000Z	russet		Hi, I'm trying to solve a GRUB booting issue and I'm having trouble finding a place to start.
2011-10-30T06:59:00.000Z	russet		I'd like to dual-boot XP and Linux, but my grub partition references are incorrect. I can boot Ubuntu, but not XP.
2011-10-30T07:00:00.000Z	zykotick9	russet	have you tried running "sudo update-grub" yet?
2011-10-30T07:01:00.000Z	zykotick9	russet	that's the hope
