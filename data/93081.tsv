2008-11-08T13:22:00.000Z	h4mx0r	wers	is it a laptop? try checking for laptop mode script and browsing through it for brightness options it probably uses the same method for when you pull the power cable
2008-11-08T13:22:00.000Z	wers	h4mx0r	where is that laptop mode script?
2008-11-08T13:23:00.000Z	h4mx0r	wers	its a service thing sort of, I think they still use it in 8.10 try googling for ubuntu laptop mode brightness and you should find the relevant commands to adjust your shortcut buttons
