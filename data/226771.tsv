2007-08-15T13:37:00.000Z	Ryan52		I have 2 ethernet cards and neither of them will connect. Ther're both plugged into my routers but the lights aren't on. I ran lspci and it listed both of my ethernet controllers. What can I do to fix this?

2007-08-15T13:39:00.000Z	joakim	Ryan52	so try with one at a time to see whether they actually are broken or not
