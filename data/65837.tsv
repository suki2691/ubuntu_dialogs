2009-02-22T19:47:00.000Z	BobPenguin		Hello guys. All of a sudden my my ubuntu 8.04 does niot recognize the numeric keypad of my keyboard. All other keys are ok but the numeric pad. I tried to change the keymap to no avail. Any hints on how to solve this?

2009-02-22T19:49:00.000Z	BobPenguin		I tried both with the numlock on and off magnetron
2009-02-22T19:49:00.000Z	mikewu	BobPenguin	does pressing the numberpad keys move the cursor or anything else?
