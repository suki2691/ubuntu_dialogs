2007-09-27T13:10:00.000Z	afd_		hi! I'm trying to upgrade from edgy to gutsy tribe 5, I have an iso image of gutsy, can I use that with update-manager? (or anything else) ?
2007-09-27T13:10:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	afd_	 the supported ways edgy -> feisty -> gutsy
2007-09-27T13:12:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	afd_	because you asked for a development release with -d
2007-09-27T13:12:00.000Z	afd_	WaltzingAlong	I've only ran it with -c switch, still offers 7.10 as update
