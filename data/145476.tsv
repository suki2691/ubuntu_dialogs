2007-12-22T20:47:00.000Z	phretor		what I love in ubuntu is that when a usb-drive is plugged in, its partitions are automatically recognized and mounted. I also have some debian systems which, for back-compatibility reasons, cannot be switched to ubuntu. However, I'd like to achieve the same behavior I described. Which packages/kernel-modules would I need?
