2010-02-22T16:03:00.000Z	Q_Continuum		Ugh, just realized the answer to my issue.  I forgot FF 3.6 is a 'new version' so we won't see it for 2 months :-/
2010-02-22T16:03:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Q_Continuum	you won't see it in Karmic probably ever -- add the PPA (FYI it's default in Lucid)
2010-02-22T16:04:00.000Z	Q_Continuum	ZykoticK9	hence the '2 months' with Lucid :-P
2010-02-22T16:05:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Q_Continuum	66 days infact ;)  (sorry didn't get your 2 months reference)
