2009-04-03T18:43:00.000Z	IHS_Intern		In the event I need larger disk space.. and can not afford a new server(current one that I will be using is a 2x 600mhz P3 Dell Poweredge 1300, PATA drives only, 256MB of PC133 SDRAM) is it better to get a bigger IDE drive, or a PCI SATA controller and larger, cheaper SATA drive with it?
