2006-06-16T13:36:00.000Z	xsquared		hello, i have a large question.. I have 2 networks. My computer is on both networks. I would like my computer to act as a gateway between both the networks (to create a big network). I would like it so that both sides can receive direct connections. 1 network is connected to the internet and their gateways are set to my internet router. How can i achieve this?
