2011-10-14T22:07:00.000Z	usertwo	fmauro	i have that problem with all folders, not just the home folder once it as opened. i even installed thunar as an alternative file manager and that was the same, so it makes me think i have some underlying file management issue.
2011-10-14T22:08:00.000Z	fmauro	usertwo	sounds like it, can't help though as my problem was nautilus-related
