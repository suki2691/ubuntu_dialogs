2009-05-23T23:50:00.000Z	Souvent22		wondering...there isn't a way for the server to only use SSLEnable on if the client browser is negotiating in SSL?
2009-05-23T23:51:00.000Z	Souvent22		example: I have port 5000 for ssl, but i want it to also handle non-ssl. e.g. http://site:8000 and https://site:5000.

2009-05-23T23:53:00.000Z	Souvent22	eseven73	ah, i'll hop over there. thx.
