2009-06-07T18:31:00.000Z	MIrrorIMage		I have a big problem. I dual boot my computer with Vista & Ubuntu. Yesterday, I upgraded from 8.10 to 9.04 which also changed the boot loader. Now I can no longer access files on Vista. How can I reverse these changes? Thx!

2009-06-07T18:50:00.000Z	MIrrorIMage	bkraptor	I no longer have the option to start Windows Vista when booting the computer
