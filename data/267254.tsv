2010-02-13T09:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phpmonk	 more common would be to use some common name for a process to hide it
2010-02-13T09:55:00.000Z	phpmonk	carbm1	hidden process, not just bg task
2010-02-13T09:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	phpmonk	 ive never heard of it being done. but ive not paid much attention to that stuff
