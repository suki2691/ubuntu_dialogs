2012-01-23T19:39:00.000Z	sipior	azariah4	why not simply use "cat f1 f2"?
2012-01-23T19:40:00.000Z	azariah4	sipior	I wanted 'read -n 1' to terminate as soon as one of the two files changed
2012-01-23T19:41:00.000Z	sipior	azariah4	use process substitution, with each file corresponding to a term like "<(cat file1 | read -n 1)"
