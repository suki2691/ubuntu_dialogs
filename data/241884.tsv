2008-05-19T07:05:00.000Z	auntieNeo		umm... how come freedoom is a dependancy for prboom? that makes no sense... I don't want to install freedoom, I don't have any hdd to spare
2008-05-19T07:06:00.000Z	auntieNeo		is it possible to install stuff with apt while ignoring dependancies?
2008-05-19T07:07:00.000Z	astro76	auntieNeo	looks like the dependency is freedoom | doom-wad-shareware, the second one is a lot smaller
2008-05-19T07:09:00.000Z	astro76	auntieNeo	sounds like just one package that has inappropriate dependencies perhaps... not apt
