2008-12-10T13:16:00.000Z	angry_squirrel		Hi friends -- new user here, I have a real easy question.  I have a linksys router, and 2 ubuntu boxes behind it.  I already have port 113 open for say box 1 at 192.168.1.100 , can I also open port 113 for box 2 on 192.168.1.101 ?
2008-12-10T13:18:00.000Z	Ximal	angry_squirrel	what are you trying to do by opening port 113 ?
2008-12-10T13:19:00.000Z	Ximal		because i installed tor ... ikonia ... i get the 501 error about proxy ... i installed tor and privoxy like the community page tells me
2008-12-10T13:19:00.000Z	angry_squirrel	Ximal	its the port that IRC sends ident requests; i want both boxes to respond
