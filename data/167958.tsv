2006-09-11T08:25:00.000Z	MadCowBoy		HI I have a question about installing compwiz, Just got a new laptop and want to add some flash...
2006-09-11T08:26:00.000Z	bruenig	MadCowBoy	first, do you mean compiz , second if you do mean compiz, flash doesn't have anything to do with it
2006-09-11T08:31:00.000Z	MadCowBoy	bruenig	I know, Bud, your right I meant compiz and not adding flash, i meant adding something flashy...
2006-09-11T08:32:00.000Z	bruenig	MadCowBoy	ok well head over to #ubuntu-xgl, that channel will be more helpfull for compiz and xgl and the like
