2009-09-15T08:47:00.000Z	shane2peru	coldboot|home	I had upgraded to the latest at that time, I since went back to what was in the repos
2009-09-15T08:47:00.000Z	shane2peru	coldboot|home	I worked through ubuntuzilla, you can look on the forums, it is documented there
2009-09-15T08:47:00.000Z	coldboot|home	shane2peru	I can't remember, but I do remember having 64-bit versions of Firefox a while ago. It could have been v2
