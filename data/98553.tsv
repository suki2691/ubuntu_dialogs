2010-09-24T21:54:00.000Z	Daniel1		Impy: What kind of microphone are you using?
2010-09-24T21:55:00.000Z	Impy^	Daniel1	It's just a cheapy one from poundland but it works. I've recoreded sound in the soundrecorder but i just want it to playback through speakers.
2010-09-24T21:56:00.000Z	Impy^	Daniel1	where would i tick a box for it to playback? I've looked and looked it use to be really easy to do but they changed everything :(
