2006-12-16T14:10:00.000Z	rrichar1		I just installed the latest fglrx (8.32.5) and now it seems that direct rendering is disabled in my XGL session, it appears to be working in my regular gnome session any ideas?

2006-12-16T14:11:00.000Z	rrichar1	mjr	beryl seems to be operating very slowly since uppgraded fglrx
