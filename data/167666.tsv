2006-10-06T05:39:00.000Z	THX-1138	SuperMiguel	Gparted (it's available on a live cd also)
2006-10-06T05:40:00.000Z	THX-1138	SuperMiguel	It is already installed in ubuntu
2006-10-06T05:45:00.000Z	THX-1138	SuperMiguel	- geeky but useful. testdisk. - likely just some confusion from gparted when it wrote to a fragmented ntfs partitio. - google for "SMART" and hard drive. - smart is drive monitoring.
