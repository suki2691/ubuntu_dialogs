2009-05-23T23:31:00.000Z	Dam0		i have this error when starting up my eggdrop: http://pastebin.com/m1be8d5fc   what would it be and what should i change?
2009-05-23T23:32:00.000Z	Slart	Dam0	hmm.. port 89999... that sounds awfully high. or?
2009-05-23T23:33:00.000Z	Slart	Dam0	as far as I know ports only go up to 65535
2009-05-24T18:30:00.000Z	Slart	Dam0	perhaps one of these channels would be more suitable for your questions http://www.eggheads.org/support/
