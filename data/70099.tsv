2009-10-04T06:09:00.000Z	smerz	hashbrowns	mark for complete removal also removes configuration files normally
2009-10-04T06:10:00.000Z	hashbrowns	smerz	so if i'm removing a linux-image should I do a mark for complete removal or just mark for removal?
2009-10-04T06:11:00.000Z	smerz	hashbrowns	i suppose either will be fine when removing kernels. i cannot think of any config files related to a kernel image
