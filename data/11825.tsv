2011-09-02T21:10:00.000Z	Merdam		what's the difference between ubuntu and debian?
2011-09-02T21:11:00.000Z	Merdam		They are both linux, right?  Same thing practically?
2011-09-02T21:11:00.000Z	Merdam		Why would I choose Ubuntu over Debian?
2011-09-02T21:11:00.000Z	Spikestuff	Merdam	Ubuntu is based on Debian, so I suppose it's just a matter of choice...
