2010-07-03T04:02:00.000Z	treble54		with ubuntu (8.10 specifically atm), how do I set up dual monitors with different resolutions, not mirrored? is there a guide people usually recommend ? I have an intel 945 (or 965, I'm not exactly sure, but it is one of the two) graphics chipset

2010-07-03T04:10:00.000Z	treble54	DasEi	even though I do not have an nvidia graphics chipset, can I still use the nvidia program to manage my dual monitor setup ?
2010-07-03T04:11:00.000Z	DasEi	treble54	no, bu there are ways to configure xorg for dualhead.. mm onboard chips might be a hassle
