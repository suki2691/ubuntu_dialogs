2010-07-17T15:18:00.000Z	DiRaOL		I've read on many sites that there is a problem with Ubuntu 10.04 and RAIDs, during the install process
2010-07-17T15:19:00.000Z	iceroot	DiRaOL	think about that grub is not running on the raid
2010-07-17T15:22:00.000Z	DiRaOL	iceroot	in theory my grub is installed on the first partition of the raid, in a ext2 partition.  but something went wrong
2010-07-17T15:23:00.000Z	iceroot	DiRaOL	its a bug
