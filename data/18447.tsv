2011-02-13T01:47:00.000Z	ubuntuser	RishavT	I dual boot and I am having Win7 already installed and going to install 10.10 on 2nd partition. So in case I have toinstall 7 later. I've seen it doesn't treat ubuntu good. So, shouldn't I go with the sda2 instead?

When I booted off LiveCD to repair grub I saw 10.10 partition was unallocated. Saw in forums that if I would have installed Grub on 10.10 partition then I wlould have had to loose my partition. I had to make a fresh system
