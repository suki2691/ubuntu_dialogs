2011-10-14T11:06:00.000Z	cousin_luigi		why does flashplugin-installer try to download nspluginwrapper and all that jazz even when it does exist a native 64 bit plugin?
2011-10-14T11:07:00.000Z	metellius	cousin_luigi	probably because the native one hasn't made it into ubuntu yet
2011-10-14T11:07:00.000Z	cousin_luigi	metellius	odd, it's been out for a while now
