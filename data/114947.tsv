2007-11-17T06:46:00.000Z	Eigenaar		if somebody could help me: I want to do a dual boot; Win XP and Ubuntu 7.10; so I just made some extra room on my C:; so I can make the new partition within the Ubuntu installation. But my question; when I resize my C: (in the Ubuntu installation proces); does it only throw away empty space? sorry if it's a real stupid question...
