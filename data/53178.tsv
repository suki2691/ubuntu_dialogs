2012-06-11T08:51:00.000Z	vnc	reisio	I believe it's realvnc, although its not named that in the repository
2012-06-11T08:52:00.000Z	vnc	reisio	realvnc is a much better server, works fine and I have lots of experience with it. I'm using tightvnc as the viewer in windows remotely
2012-06-11T08:52:00.000Z	reisio	vnc	isn't there a realvnc viewer for win32?
