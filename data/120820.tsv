2009-04-18T06:40:00.000Z	guest123456		help! I am trying to load ubuntu on my machine and the live cd seems to "start" to boot I get the ubuntu splash screen and then I get  "initramfs" and my cdrom stops responding
2009-04-18T06:41:00.000Z	guest123456		what does initramfs mean?
2009-04-18T06:42:00.000Z	noodlesgc	guest123456	have you try running the "Check CD for Defects" option?
2009-04-18T06:44:00.000Z	noodlesgc	guest123456	thats odd. You could try pressing F4 at the menu, and selecting "Safe graphics Mode"
