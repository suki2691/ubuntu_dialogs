2007-07-12T14:00:00.000Z	maximander	mhz`	that's a alot of downtime to cross the country, and expensive... it'd be cheaper to pay them to roll a crash cart over and do the install... but i don't trust them. and since it's in production and can't afford downtime of shipping, it's just gonna leave the ram empty
