2007-02-22T15:00:00.000Z	cables	Instabin	of course. But in truth I'd rather them just put submit driver patches to the kernel so any distro can use dell hardware
2007-02-22T15:01:00.000Z	Instabin	cables	Yea but being preloaded would get linux where it normaly wouldnt be
2007-02-22T15:01:00.000Z	cables	Instabin	good point
