2007-10-04T12:16:00.000Z	mEck0		thx Flannel
2007-10-04T12:17:00.000Z	user_	mEck0	Yeah, I have to restart firefox sometimes b/c it hoggs mem
2007-10-04T12:19:00.000Z	mEck0	user_	ok, I though if it might be some bugs in 7.10 or maybe it is firefox who eat so much (I have ff up with about 15 tabs right now...)
