2006-08-15T10:36:00.000Z	Al-Ashtar		I was using xchat 2.6.6 with the spell checking feature working ok, but yesterday I was forced to do a "fsck" upon boot up. after the reboot I lost the spell checking feature. so I tried re-compiling from source with --enable-spell=static just as the xchat FAQ said, but again it doesn't work. and google doesn't return anything useful.
