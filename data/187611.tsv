2008-06-18T12:36:00.000Z	BezNalogov		Hi people. I have ubuntu 8.04 and my firefox has just been updated. Only the print problem is still there in my firefox. Is this a known problem? Is there a way to fix it?

2008-06-18T12:37:00.000Z	ikonia	BezNalogov	can you print outside firefox ?
2008-06-18T12:37:00.000Z	ikonia	BezNalogov	Hmmm thats odd, as firefox should just use cups the same as every other
