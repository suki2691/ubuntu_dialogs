2006-11-24T12:04:00.000Z	RoC_MM	pradeepvglughyd	are you running a software firewall?
2006-11-24T12:04:00.000Z	RoC_MM	pradeepvglughyd	does it show NAT OK or NAT Error?
2006-11-24T12:06:00.000Z	RoC_MM	pradeepvglughyd	it's OK if your DHT is unreachable from the outside.  It would help you find peers if any of your torrent's trackers go down though.  It's not an Ubuntu-specific question though.
