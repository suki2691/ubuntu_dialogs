2004-10-27T15:56:00.000Z	Lathiat	sarcasm	im not sure but ask the debian installer guys how they handle their translations?
2004-10-27T15:58:00.000Z	sarcasm	Lathiat	well, that would be a start, but isn't ubuntu installer branched from the debian one?
2004-10-27T16:00:00.000Z	Lathiat	sarcasm	yes but i have no idea how translations are done, its probably gettext but i dunno so find out how theyre done then get the files out of the ubuntu installer and send file a bug for ubuntu with the translation?
