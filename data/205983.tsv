2007-12-09T11:54:00.000Z	nanbud1		i lost connection and hence i would repeat my question. My /home/myUsername/Documents folder contains another 'home' folder which again contains Documents folder(empty). What is this? has anyone else seen this happening?
2007-12-09T11:55:00.000Z	gadren	nanbud1	i haven't seen that exact thing happen, but i wonder if it's a result of you accidentally copying something, or ubuntu somehow importing old files incorrectly
2007-12-09T11:55:00.000Z	gadren	nanbud1	i would just try deleting a few items, and checking to make sure it didn't remove their clones
2007-12-09T11:56:00.000Z	gadren	nanbud1	and if the files aren't "linked" in some way, just go ahead and remove the extras
