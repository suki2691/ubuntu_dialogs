2011-08-05T04:18:00.000Z	Viking667		I can't play music with anything that uses mpd, but I've no idea what's wrong. mpd seems to be able to access the sound device fine, mplayer plays music fine.
2011-08-05T04:18:00.000Z	Viking667		I'm stuck, and I need some help
2011-08-05T04:19:00.000Z	szal	Viking667	what do you use as output in mpd?
2011-08-05T04:21:00.000Z	szal	Viking667	should work if you have the right device in there.. but Pulse output will work as well
