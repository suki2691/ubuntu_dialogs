2005-09-12T15:36:00.000Z	sharp		I'm considering installing x86 Ubuntu on my AMD64 box to avoid the trouble.  How much would the performance degrade?
2005-09-12T15:37:00.000Z	nalioth	sharp	not much (if any humanly noticeable) degradation
2005-09-12T15:37:00.000Z	nalioth	sharp	use the 686 kernel for best results (after the install, you can upgrade the kernel)
