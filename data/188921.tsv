2007-01-07T08:36:00.000Z	Lynoure	jakob	yes, there is difference. Ubuntu is based on Debian, but egdy is closer to Debian Unstable than Stable when it comes to the versions of things.
2007-01-07T08:38:00.000Z	Lynoure	jakob	kinda. except unstable is evermoving, everchanging, unlike the released Ubuntus
