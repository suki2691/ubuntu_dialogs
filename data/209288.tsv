2006-11-12T11:28:00.000Z	jtf0518		I've never taken an official release to automatically mean "stable" but then I've been dealing with Windows since version 3.0 :-)
2006-11-12T11:28:00.000Z	LjL	jtf0518	that's untrue. Dapper has longer support, but Edgy is not "meant to be experimental" by any stretch of imagination. it was released last month. it was experimental before that.
2006-11-12T11:31:00.000Z	LjL	jtf0518	it might not be very stable, it might have problems, and whatnot. but this is the official support channel, and Edgy wasn't released, and as such it's not experimental anymore, and saying otherwise is simply wrong. saying "it's unstable for some people" is different from saying "it's meant to be experimental"
