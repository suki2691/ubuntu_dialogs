2009-10-29T20:40:00.000Z	JonathanEllis		I am about to install Karmic. I understand that it will be faster to delete my partitions and start again with ext4. At the moment I have a separate home partition which is ext3. The reason I did this was to make backup easier and also so I could just hook up new distro versions to my existing home. Now, having a separate home partition is a bit limiting so can anyone suggest a better way to migrate my data across to karmic?
