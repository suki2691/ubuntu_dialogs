2006-12-21T11:02:00.000Z	jhaig	rojosacerdotes	I doubt it as ubuntu has 6 month release cycle, while debian has a "when it's ready" release cycle.
2006-12-21T11:02:00.000Z	rojosacerdotes	jhaig	so ubuntu has its own developers then - based on but separate from debian?
2006-12-21T11:03:00.000Z	jhaig	rojosacerdotes	I think ubuntu is based more on debian testing or unstable, which has more up to date packages
