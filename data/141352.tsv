2007-11-06T05:15:00.000Z	mycroftiv	nesl247	there are several issues with session management in compiz, apparently the developers need stuff that's only implemented in the upcoming xorg releases for user switching to work correctly
2007-11-06T05:16:00.000Z	nesl247	mycroftiv	Ah, thanks. Hadn't heard about that. But guess that's what I get for not staying up to date with the stuff.
