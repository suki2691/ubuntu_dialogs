2009-01-22T07:02:00.000Z	Funqhaus		Semidious yes I did.  Thats where the problem started.  I went tot he "drive" tab and tried to point it to a folder in my home directory I had created to use as the mount point.

2009-01-22T07:03:00.000Z	Semidios	Funqhaus	well thats your problem.  I did that to one of mine.  Never really did figure it out but I remembered that error.  I believe you have to reset the prefs of HAL somewhere.  nickrud i'm hoping you know more about this than I do.
