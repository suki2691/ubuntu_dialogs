2006-07-24T09:17:00.000Z	MikeTheC		got a question if anyone wants to tackle it (prolly real elementary, too)
2006-07-24T09:18:00.000Z	MikeTheC		I'm running Ubuntu 6.0.6/PPC and tried to set up Rhythmbox, but it doesn't seem to have access to the MP3 codecs I've already installed for XMMS, etc. Thoughts?
2006-07-24T09:19:00.000Z	dyn-afk	MikeTheC	use someting like easyubuntu/automatix to install all the media codecs (which comes down to all of the gstreamer-10 codecs)
2006-07-24T09:31:00.000Z	dyn-afk	MikeTheC	you need to enable the options "unsupported" and "commercial" software
