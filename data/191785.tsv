2006-11-14T12:07:00.000Z	Almindor		how do I reinstall something properly?
2006-11-14T12:07:00.000Z	Almindor		I tried "remove" and "install" but it didn't recreate the config files even if I removed them manualy in between
2006-11-14T12:08:00.000Z	roryy	Almindor	to remove config files, use 'remove --purge' to remove config files too.  Read 'man apt-get' for more
