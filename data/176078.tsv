2006-07-02T06:43:00.000Z	tach00		Hey, how do i resize my swap partition?
2006-07-02T06:43:00.000Z	proctor	tach00	I was gonna ask that some time later...incase i were to increase my ram
2006-07-02T06:43:00.000Z	proctor		would I go back into windows and use partiton magic/gparted?
2006-07-02T06:43:00.000Z	tach00	proctor	does the size of the swap relate to the amount of ram? or can you size it how you want
