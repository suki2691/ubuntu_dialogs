2005-11-29T15:26:00.000Z	CookedGryphon		hi, i'm running xfce (soooo much nicer than gnome or kde...apart from the rox file manager) and i ran nautilus instead of rox-filer, forgetting that it would take over the desktop if called as just nautilus, now xfdesktop won't start up anymore, can anyone give me any hints as to where i should look to re-enable it
