2011-09-02T15:52:00.000Z	jimi_		I downloaded the 11.04 installer, and about 80% through it popped up and said something like the package deforma is broken, and then it said i was done, but then it also said it didnt install a boot loader. Haas anyone else had this experience? Should I go to 10.04 and then upgrade to 11?
