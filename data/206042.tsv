2005-11-27T17:45:00.000Z	Pygi	Macka_ubu	maybe your cabel connected to light is...ergh..somethin' wrong or anythin' ? :/
2005-11-27T17:49:00.000Z	Macka_ubu	Pygi	nah the hdd light worked ok under winxp and still works ok during boot-up but at somepoint during boot it comes on hard and stays
2005-11-27T17:50:00.000Z	Macka_ubu	Pygi	so I think it is a software issue
