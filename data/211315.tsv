2007-06-05T14:38:00.000Z	bluefox83	narg	kubuntu just uses a different desktop environment than ubuntu, if it';s just going to be a headless server, ubuntu will be fine :)
2007-06-05T14:38:00.000Z	narg	bluefox83	it will be a desktop thing. I realize the difference between them ;)
2007-06-05T14:39:00.000Z	bluefox83	narg	then base it on which one you prefer to use, because kubuntu and ubuntu are basically the same thing
