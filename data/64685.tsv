2010-08-15T00:31:00.000Z	russ		hi, can anyone tell me where to find xorg.conf in lucid?
2010-08-15T00:32:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	russ	it's not there by default - you'd need to create one see http://sites.google.com/site/alucidfs/how-i-do/create-an-xorg-conf-file
2010-08-15T00:33:00.000Z	russ	ZykoticK9	that's new. I want to turn off response to taps on my laptop touchpad. Is there an easier way?
2010-08-15T00:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	russ	not that i'm personally aware of - it may exist though?  Good luck man.
