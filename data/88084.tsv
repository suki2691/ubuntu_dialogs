2009-06-08T03:06:00.000Z	PhotoJim	supercom32	no, using VNC is akin to Windows Remote Desktop.  that's probably what you want to use.

2009-06-08T03:09:00.000Z	PhotoJim	supercom32	correct.  might be ways around it but I don't know what they are.  if you need to run apps there and the owner of that machine (or user, if you're the owner) understand what might happen, just talk to that person and explain not to disrupt those apps.  or run a virtual machine on that machine, and VNC into it.
