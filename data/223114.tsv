2005-10-31T07:32:00.000Z	qiHEWSfi		would anyone be interested in a surround headphones and a terratec 5.1 card for 50 bucks? i am telling this because i now have a functional 5.1 system in ubuntu, and that hardware can be bought from stores for that price..if anyone has problems with alsa, i could help you out with a few pointers
2005-10-31T07:33:00.000Z	qiHEWSfi		i am not suggesting a trade with me, that is original hardware in a store
