2009-01-01T23:22:00.000Z	Locked_out		Good morning. My laptop was left on the other night. The battery ran down to the point that the clock even stopped. When I went to reboot after charging, I logged into Ubuntu and found my wireless not working. I clicked on network and got an error saying, "unable to load configuration files. You are not authorized". How do I fix this?
