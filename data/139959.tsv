2007-04-08T11:30:00.000Z	khuru		is there an ftp server for ubuntu that allows creating new user accounts just for the ftp server with configurable permissions etc - so that it doesn't have anything to do with real linux user accounts and is not tied to them in any way? so simply put: i'm looking for something like every ftp server for windows out there :)

2007-04-08T11:32:00.000Z	khuru	atoponce	are you sure? i thought it was exactly the opposite, being tied to linux user accounts. but i have to investigate it further then, thanks!
