2007-03-28T13:52:00.000Z	mittwochstheke		I cannot install ANYTHING. mozilla gives a bunch of dependency-errors which traverse through all other included dependencies. Why is that? What did I do wrong? I just installed from cd-rom (6.06)
2007-03-28T13:53:00.000Z	Flannel	mittwochstheke	pastebin the errors, and your sources.list please
