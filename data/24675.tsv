2010-12-24T16:08:00.000Z	rigved	ElPasmo	check online for a list of supported graphics cards (don't remember the link though - ask in #ubuntu+1)
2010-12-24T16:08:00.000Z	rigved	ElPasmo	you are welcome
2010-12-24T16:10:00.000Z	rigved	ElPasmo	also you need to remember that natty is currently not for production system (only developers and testers). wait the #ubuntu+1 channel is currently slow moving (not many people onlune)
