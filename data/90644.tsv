2012-06-14T21:58:00.000Z	multi_io		I have 10.04 and I DON'T see 12.04 as being available in the Update Manager. Why?
2012-06-14T21:59:00.000Z	multi_io		(I only see 10.10 if I switch in the settings to "show normal releases")
2012-06-14T21:59:00.000Z	multi_io		is 12.04 out yet?
2012-06-14T21:59:00.000Z	kypor	multi_io	- Yes
