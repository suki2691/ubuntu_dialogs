2012-03-06T19:23:00.000Z	hypershock	yt372	yes, i am actually. I use chrome all the time, but when I use firefox to test my website, often times it would complain despite the lastest adobe flash plugin being installed, but I just recently installed gnash again and it stopped complaining. however, i do have both installed.

2012-03-06T19:24:00.000Z	hypershock	yt372	i don't have a problem, i like my stew. :)
