2008-08-14T05:25:00.000Z	_2	moolcool	it's a kernel update     try booting an older kernel

2008-08-14T05:27:00.000Z	_2	moolcool	i would love to explain all the whyfor's and hithertoo's about it.  but there are lots of docs already writen on the web.    select an older kernel at boot time   in the grub menu.
