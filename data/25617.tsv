2010-09-24T00:18:00.000Z	billif_ze		Because of chromium and also chrome browsers has a feature to running of different processes i can not use with them AllTray application. Can someone give me a command to solve it temporary ?
2010-09-24T00:19:00.000Z	andycc	billif_ze	isn't there an extension for that? Kind of like AllTray for FF?
