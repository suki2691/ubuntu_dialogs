2009-08-05T03:19:00.000Z	Radtoo	Jimmio	its stopped by the unavailabilty of some libraries, usually... after half of your hdd's files are gone ;)
2009-08-05T03:19:00.000Z	Radtoo	Jimmio	oh and if you dont use sudo I guess it doesn't delete most things
2009-08-05T03:20:00.000Z	Radtoo	Jimmio	I mean, a regular user does pretty much not have the right to write to / remove any files other than his home directory and some temporary / shared directories
