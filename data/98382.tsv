2008-04-30T02:53:00.000Z	Cidan		I can't boot using the newest kernel, in 8.04, 2.6.24.16 generic; I get Error 18 from grub (Selected cylinder exceeds maximum supported by BIOS) and I can not figure this one out.  I have not reconfigured or changed my drives, and 2.6.24.15 still boots just fine (which is what I'm on now.)  Any ideas?
2008-04-30T02:53:00.000Z	Cidan		Because I'm really stuck here. :/
