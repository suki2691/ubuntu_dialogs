2007-12-19T16:58:00.000Z	Guillem		hello, I've just bought a small adaptor to convert PS2 to USB, so I can use an old PS2 keyboard in my laptop. However the keyboard does not work. Also if I use a ps2 mouse, the mouse gets light (optical mouse) but does not work either. The keyboard does not even show the lights of locks. What am I missing?
