2006-03-11T14:13:00.000Z	LjL	bockman	perhaps manpages-dev is what you want
2006-03-11T14:14:00.000Z	LjL	bockman	well it's not quite essential to building
2006-03-11T14:15:00.000Z	LjL	bockman	i think build-essential is mostly mean to let you compile source tarballs, rather than to let you start programming
