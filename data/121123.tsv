2007-09-23T10:56:00.000Z	IhateCLI		Hi guys, I'm sharing windows xp's files, but I can't access "program files". How do I enter the username/password
2007-09-23T10:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	IhateCLI	 XP has the programfiles directory some how very very very very blocked from getting shared. I cant even get to it from a nother xp box.
2007-09-23T10:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	IhateCLI	  there may be some xp setting to remove the lock on it. but ive never found it. - i have shared direcories INSIDE the 'program files' directory
2007-09-23T10:57:00.000Z	IhateCLI	Dr_willis	Ah... That'll do fine. Thanks!
