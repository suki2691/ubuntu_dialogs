2012-06-30T12:04:00.000Z	anon	suborbital	I have zipped up a large file and sent it to my buddy the other day. I used the GUI program in Ubuntu 12.04 and set a password. My buddy says he gets some "... PK error... ". I can not recall what exactly it was. The file hash is the same so the file that he received is not corrupted. What could be the reason that he can not unzip it? He is on Suse and I am on Ubuntu.
