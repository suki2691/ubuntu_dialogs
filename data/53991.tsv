2009-11-07T17:34:00.000Z	CptnAwesome		folks, im running ubuntu server install with lxde on top, my clock is wrong and i cant get it to stay at my local time (gmt+10)
2009-11-07T17:35:00.000Z	durt	CptnAwesome	is the timezone correct? how far is the clock off?
2009-11-07T17:37:00.000Z	CptnAwesome	durt	my current time is 0935 but my local time is 2335
2009-11-07T17:38:00.000Z	durt	CptnAwesome	sounds like the timezone is wrong, IIRC, you can change it with 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata'
