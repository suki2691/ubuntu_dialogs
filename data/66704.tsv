If have allowed 6000 through my firewall to test connecting and I can from the outside.  But I want to be more secure so Im trying to setup ssh
2009-05-06T19:50:00.000Z	secureneo		I am using a windows system to connect with using putty and have configured a tunnel but I can only successully ssh
2009-05-06T19:50:00.000Z	secureneo		I cant vnc through the tunnel
2009-05-06T19:51:00.000Z	ellar	secureneo	you need to set putty to tunnel the port, search for that. I did it but i don't remember exactly
