2008-06-08T17:19:00.000Z	duduman		can someone please help me I changed the boot sequence to make windows xp my default operating system but now its not working and I can't save the menu.lst as it needs permission but I don't know where to add the permission. The process of changing the boot is much harder on Ubuntu than on xp. Please Help!!!!
