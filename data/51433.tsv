2010-06-26T08:41:00.000Z	rocket16		Is there any central application for all Educational applications? I think if not, we should make one, something like a Central System, which will allow us to access Kalzium, Kig, Avogadro and everything all at once.

2010-06-26T08:43:00.000Z	rocket16	Tootoot222	Well, Software centre is for installation, I meant something like KOffice, which runs all of them, without having to open separately, :)
