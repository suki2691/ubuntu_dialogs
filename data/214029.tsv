2011-10-22T10:04:00.000Z	airtonix	oh586f	on a live or installed setup?
2011-10-22T10:04:00.000Z	airtonix	oh586f	and define "updating"
2011-10-22T10:05:00.000Z	airtonix	oh586f	ok i'm not sure how familiar you are with ubuntu, but there are usually two phases to updates, 1) update the list of packages, 2) update the actualy installed packages.
