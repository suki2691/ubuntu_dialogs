2009-07-13T03:24:00.000Z	Kamokow		I have Ubuntu 9.04 hooked up to a wireless network VIA a wireless bridge using a Cat. 5 cable. It works for awhile, then will randomly disconnect from the internet, it has a static IP different from the computer it is bridged with and it does work for awhile before disconnecting (then will sometimes reconnect awhile later), how can I make it always stay connected, because sometimes I get disconnected from pidgin conversations and such.
2009-07-13T03:25:00.000Z	Kamokow		so, blacklist ipv6?
2009-07-13T03:26:00.000Z	Kamokow		how do I do that in ubuntu? (Sorry, I havent ever done alot of network stuff with linux)
