2010-10-15T10:48:00.000Z	Thopter		I updated to Maverick back on the 9th, but just today it seems Gedit has gone and renamed itself to "Text Editor".  The About menu still says Gedit, it still displays "gedit" in the title bar, but I can no longer activate it by typing in "gedit" into gnome-do.  Any ideas why Gedit has been renamed, and how can I revert the change so that everything will work properly again?
