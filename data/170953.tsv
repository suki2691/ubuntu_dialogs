2007-10-15T14:45:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder		ok.. I have a Radeon R250 [Mobility FireGL 9000]  video card in this Toshiba Tecra notebook computer. I'm pretty sure the driver here http://ati.amd.com/support/drivers/linux/previous/linux-r-8-28-8.html is the one I need. Can anyone help me with getting that driver installed without killing my system?
