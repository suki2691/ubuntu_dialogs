2009-11-24T17:46:00.000Z	titchy		Hi All, I just upgraded to Ubuntu 9.10 from the previous version, it killed my display as the new nv driver was unable to drive the Nvidia ION in my system, though it seemed to work previously. I had no choice but to install the proprietary drivers to get a system that works, even then I had to add them to the xorg.conf to get them to load. Is this a good enough place to say this so it helps the code change so others are not struck by a flashing text l
