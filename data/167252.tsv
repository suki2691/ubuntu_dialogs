2006-09-19T07:34:00.000Z	harrisR		I just set up my own chat server and it works great however I cannot op myself? Sounds funny but I was wondering if anyone knows how I can go about this? I looked at my config files but don't see anything there and have been searching the internet much with no luck
2006-09-19T07:34:00.000Z	scrp	harrisR	depends on the ircd you have
2006-09-19T07:34:00.000Z	scrp	harrisR	for example you cant op yourself on IRCnet networks
2006-09-19T07:40:00.000Z	harrisR	scrp	I just checked. I have ircd-irc2 installed. I can connect to my computer on the standard port. Everything seems to work however it is like the server is not mine. Do you know of any documents I can read up on this? I basically would like to hide my ip when I am on my server and have op status.
