2008-10-05T00:55:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		is Flash 10 still in beta?
2008-10-05T00:55:00.000Z	bobertdos	Geoffrey2	RC2, actually
2008-10-05T00:57:00.000Z	bobertdos	Geoffrey2	That's somewhat true, although for most sites, that was actually an issue with how the beta was numbered. The latest RC is numbered so that doesn't happen anymore.
