2008-11-01T21:11:00.000Z	Azhi_Dahaka		hmm... can I mount a folder inside the partition?
2008-11-01T21:11:00.000Z	Azhi_Dahaka		So, one folder is installed as /home and the rest od the partition at /misc
2008-11-01T21:12:00.000Z	Azhi_Dahaka		nevermind... can /home be a link?
2008-11-01T21:13:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	Azhi_Dahaka	pretty sure it can, yes
