2007-07-08T10:05:00.000Z	JCFiala		I apologize if this is something in the commonQuestions, but I don't see it there.  My mousewheel isn't doing any scrolling in kbuntu - do I need to delve into xorg.conf, or is there a configuration screen I'm missing?
2007-07-08T10:06:00.000Z	jimmygoon	JCFiala	likely xorg.conf
2007-07-08T10:06:00.000Z	jimmygoon	JCFiala	is it a laptop or a usb/other mouse?
2007-07-08T10:06:00.000Z	jimmygoon	JCFiala	always try googling ubuntu + model_no of your mouse
