2008-06-07T20:21:00.000Z	twistedoblivion		I really need help here....I used to use Mirc when I was younger, and have forgotten all the commands.  Does anyone know of any references for XChat commands.
2008-06-07T20:21:00.000Z	twistedoblivion		I went to their site but it does not show me how to access files or anything of the sort
2008-06-07T20:22:00.000Z	dr_Willis	twistedoblivion	 the xchat.org site has docs..  what do you mean by access files?
2008-06-07T20:22:00.000Z	dr_Willis	twistedoblivion	 and most IRC clients have rather standard IRC commands..
