2012-02-29T04:42:00.000Z	zykotick9	emu	alternative to roller paste, try shift+insert
2012-02-29T04:44:00.000Z	emu	zykotick9	I'm trying to pipe stdout straight to my clipboard to be retrieve with control-c. xclip stores it so I can retrieve it with mbutton, but not control-c. I could write stdout to a file and copy it with an editor, but that seems roundabout.
