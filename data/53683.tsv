2009-11-26T01:37:00.000Z	FoolishOwl		I'm planning to install Windows XP and Windows 7 on a second hard drive. One problem is, my system clock is set to UTC. Has the bug with Windows failing to understand UTC been fixed, or must I change the system clock to local time?
2009-11-26T01:37:00.000Z	FoolishOwl		Is there a #windows?
2009-11-26T01:37:00.000Z	Slart	FoolishOwl	I think windows still is weird about the clock.. I've set my clock to autoupdate in both windows and ubuntu.. that usually takes care of it
2009-11-26T01:41:00.000Z	FoolishOwl	Slart	I'm leaning towards telling Windows to treat UTC as local time, if I can. Linux is the primary operating system on this machine.
