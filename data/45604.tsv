2009-10-16T12:49:00.000Z	thermal_		hey I recently switched back to linux after running osx for a few years where I fell in love with quicksilver. I'm currently looking for a linux equivalent that handles context switching
2009-10-16T12:49:00.000Z	thermal_		I've played around with gnome-do, but you can switch back to previous applications which for me was the best feature of quicksilver, it allowed me to use muscle memory to switch between applications rather than having to look at the alt-tab windows
2009-10-16T12:50:00.000Z	C0nn0R	thermal_	tryed with "apt-cache search quicksilver" ib terminal to find an alt ?
2009-10-16T13:34:00.000Z	thermal_	C0nn0R	heh.. I might have found a potential solution for linux quicksilver
