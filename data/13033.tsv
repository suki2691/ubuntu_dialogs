2011-06-22T06:15:00.000Z	Chilaquiles	devral	have you tried reinstalling the app?
2011-06-22T06:24:00.000Z	devral	Chilaquiles	yes, i did an apt-get install --reinstall screen but it did not help
2011-06-22T06:26:00.000Z	Chilaquiles	devral	Have you tried after you restart your ubuntu? Thay problem has to do with accessing an area of memory that doesn't exist or its only for system use.
