2010-03-10T19:02:00.000Z	IRA_36		hi i wanted to ask whats the best way to make backup on 9.10?
2010-03-10T19:02:00.000Z	dabaR	IRA_36	backup of what/how much data?
2010-03-10T19:06:00.000Z	dabaR	IRA_36	you should start by googling for "backup ubuntu"
2010-03-10T19:07:00.000Z	dabaR	IRA_36	actually, the top two for "ubuntu backup" seem like the way to go.
