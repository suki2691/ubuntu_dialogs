2006-11-02T07:03:00.000Z	darwin_		I upgraded to edgy now my gnome seems to logoff when I don't use it for a while is that a new feature?
2006-11-02T07:04:00.000Z	abovett	darwin_	is you screensaver kicking in?
2006-11-02T07:07:00.000Z	abovett	darwin_	there's an option to tell the screensaver not to lock the screen: can't remember where exactly but I can look if you like.
