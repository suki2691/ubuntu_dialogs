2008-12-31T11:20:00.000Z	box_man	gmathews	2's fine.. if you can upgrade why not just go to 4 with 2 new sticks?
2008-12-31T11:20:00.000Z	gmathews	sexcopter	i already have 1 GB now, but a 2GB bundle seems cheaper than buying another 1 GB
2008-12-31T11:20:00.000Z	box_man	gmathews	and its usually not a good idea to miss match sticks.
