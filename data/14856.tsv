2011-04-30T12:33:00.000Z	keithtoo	thousands	do apt-get install libglib2.0-0 and see if that helps
2011-04-30T12:37:00.000Z	keithtoo	thousands	did that also pull up libglib2.0-bin? Might need that too
2011-04-30T12:43:00.000Z	keithtoo	thousands	check in your lib directory for that lib - on my system it's  /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libglib-2.0.so.0
2011-04-30T12:49:00.000Z	keithtoo	thousands	I'm stumped there... seems that if the links are there, the prog should roll
