2009-04-29T10:43:00.000Z	Flannel	superwad	Well, unless it's got a http interface, and you're pointing at a deb file.  You can't add svn (which you intend to check out and build, etc) to apt.
2009-04-29T10:58:00.000Z	superwad	Flannel	thanks for the info.  i'll just have to check it out and build manually
