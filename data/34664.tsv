2010-04-03T07:50:00.000Z	Semitones		Ok, hey, here's what I did. I used to have two IDE hard drives, one crappy one, and one new one that was the "slave." It was starting to make noises and signs it was failing, so I opened up the case and unplugged the powerchord, without changing the Data ribbon. Now grub has an error because it can't find the first hard disk. I'm booted into the live cd now. Can I install grub2 on the "slave" hard drive from the live cd? Or do I have to open the
