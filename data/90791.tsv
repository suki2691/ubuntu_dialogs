2009-02-03T03:51:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny		I'm trying to get Sambe to share for an XPPro box, I've installed swat. It doesn't allow you to change anything... Where's the real gui samba setup?

2009-02-03T03:53:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	fprimex	Oh. I tried that before, on my drive. The option only comes up for folders.
2009-02-03T03:53:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	fprimex	Thanks.
