2011-02-09T21:32:00.000Z	birrbert		I recently had to reinstall Ubuntu 10.04.1 LTS Server on my home server, but before that I loaded setup defaults in BIOS. By doing this the hard drive controller setting was made IDE. So I reinstalled the operating system in IDE mode and I was wondering if switching to AHCI would affect it? I know that Windows doesn't like if you do that and it will not boot. How would Ubuntu react? How would
