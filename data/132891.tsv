2012-01-17T21:09:00.000Z	elijah	geoffmcc	Yes, that was my original question so that is exactly what I wanted! The guide at http://www.computerhope.com/unix/urm.htm is either wrong or for a different version of rm. Not sure but it says rm -f will remove all files in a directory, I couldn't get it to work.
