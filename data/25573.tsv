2010-11-17T05:35:00.000Z	acal		I need help... I'm trying to install Ubuntu 10.10 for my 64BIT AMD system and when I install it works, but after the reboot it gives me this error: "Disk Boot Failure, Insert Boot Disk and Press Enter"
2010-11-17T05:36:00.000Z	acal		I can boot into the live ubuntu (test it out before you install) which is what I'm on right now.
2010-11-17T05:36:00.000Z	ElPasmo	acal	have you any usb pendrive or external disk connected during boot?
2010-11-17T05:37:00.000Z	ElPasmo	acal	I had the same problem once, and it was when I had a external usb HDD connected...
