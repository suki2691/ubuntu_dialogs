2008-08-08T08:35:00.000Z	RequinB41		I have an image that shows on  my desktop when i disable my desktop in nautilus.  (To the best of my knowledge) I have no other file manager programs running.  I would like that image to go away, help please?

2008-08-08T08:37:00.000Z	marco	RequinB41	fair enough.  To be honest, I haven't tried pidgin IRC in a very long time, it may have improved
