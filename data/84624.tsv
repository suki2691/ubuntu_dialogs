2008-07-25T06:45:00.000Z	tmajibon	regeya	the problem is, my system is lagging and crashing because of it when I do some memory heavy stuff, even though I have enough memory to put all of it there
2008-07-25T06:45:00.000Z	tmajibon		yes
2008-07-25T06:45:00.000Z	regeya	tmajibon	if your system is crashing when you do memory-intensive stuff, I'd worry less about swap and more about your memory.
