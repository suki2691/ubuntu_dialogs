2006-11-28T12:53:00.000Z	CzarAlex		i appear to have some missing disk space on my drive. according to df, its 98% full but I dont have anything on it (that I put there) to fill it anywhere near that. What steps should I take to track this down? My log files all seem smal (nothing over 300K). Do I need to forcefully empty my trash? If so, how? What else do you suggest?
