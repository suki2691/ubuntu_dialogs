2009-01-08T05:48:00.000Z	lusepuster	opera	do you mean you want to convert a Microsoft Word file to PDF?
2009-01-08T05:50:00.000Z	opera	lusepuster	i mean i need a tool can translate some word english-to-chinese, in pdf
2009-01-08T05:51:00.000Z	lusepuster	opera	you will probably have to copy-paste the text from the pdf to pure text and then see what tools are on the net - maybe google translate...?
