2008-01-26T19:13:00.000Z	Genius314		I messed up a setting in System>Admin>Screens and Graphics, and now I can't see what I'm doing to change it back...
2008-01-26T19:14:00.000Z	Seveas	Genius314	the screens and graphics thing saves backups in /etc/X11/
2008-01-26T19:15:00.000Z	Genius314	Seveas	Where in /etc/X11?
2008-01-26T19:15:00.000Z	Genius314	Seveas	Is it a specific file or something?
