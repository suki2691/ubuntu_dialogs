2009-07-10T10:12:00.000Z	rainwalker	MrWizeGuy1983	ubuntu only updates for security fixes, not feature releases like 3.5
2009-07-10T10:14:00.000Z	rainwalker	MrWizeGuy1983	could you explain what you did? I just noticed I have icedtea installed and would rather use sun's java
2009-07-10T10:15:00.000Z	MrWizeGuy1983	rainwalker	you can do it two ways
