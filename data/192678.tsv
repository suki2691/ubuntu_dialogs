2007-11-01T02:48:00.000Z	ASTX813	Psi-Jack	do you know a better calendar app that syncs with google calendar?  I'm trying to have a global calendar from home, work, and eventually cell.
2007-11-01T02:57:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	ASTX813	I use a Firefox plugin that works with it. Google's GData access API is very nice, that you, with programming skills, could even make a better tool for the gnome-panel's itself, directly, if you truely tried. ;)
