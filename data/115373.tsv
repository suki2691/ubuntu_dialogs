2007-10-26T02:25:00.000Z	fryfrog		So the *new* propriatary ati drivers support composite, so I am playing around with enabling it in my Gutsy install.  Is there some docs on what does this?
2007-10-26T02:25:00.000Z	fryfrog		it doesn't appear to be compiz or xgl anymore :/
2007-10-26T02:27:00.000Z	fryfrog		So what does Gutsy use for the pretties, not compiz or beryl?
