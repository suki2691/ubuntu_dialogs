2011-03-27T19:37:00.000Z	sauce_		I has a question/problem.
2011-03-27T19:38:00.000Z	sauce_		I run a minecraft server on an old dell. I have it set not to fall asleep. But at night it like freezes up, and in the morning the screen is lit but black and i get no response out of it. I have to unplug it to restart the server because the server goes down when it does this. I am running ubuntu 10.04 with desktop.
