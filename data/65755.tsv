2009-11-21T22:44:00.000Z	sshc	pieces	see warning in https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2 ; you need to use supergrub (not a live session) to boot into your normal installation and purge grub-pc with "apt-get purge grub-pc" (or purge grub2 if that's what you installed) and then "apt-get install grub2", even if you previously installed grub2.  Don't run any upgrade-grub commands after the reinstallation.
