2010-05-02T23:32:00.000Z	Izinucs	Guest28194	way longer than anything you'd like to use.. also it's good practice to use filenames with no spaces.. if you feel a need for a space put an underscore in its place
2010-05-02T23:34:00.000Z	Guest28194	Izinucs	ok. But flac refuses to convert a file because its name was to long or contains "...."
2010-05-02T23:35:00.000Z	Izinucs	Guest28194	ok.. that may be a flac thing not a system thing.. also if you have unusual characters that might also be a flac thing..
