2010-07-18T08:23:00.000Z	matelot		I'm building a program from source, downloaded and extracted the tgz: question, where should I put the extracted dir ?
2010-07-18T08:24:00.000Z	thune3	matelot	somewhere in your home directory, it is up to you exactly where.
2010-07-18T08:25:00.000Z	matelot	thune3	after I "make", this dir can or can not be deleted ?
