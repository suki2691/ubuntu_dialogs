2005-09-19T15:50:00.000Z	delire	Omarkj	you will get a default config yes..
2005-09-19T15:59:00.000Z	delire	Omarkj	you also should file a bug in http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com. perhaps first ask 'crimsun' if he has the time to help you. he's the resident expert in sound related matters.
2005-09-19T15:59:00.000Z	Omarkj	delire	Will do. I expect it's a kernel problem actually.
