2010-01-30T14:51:00.000Z	politas		Can anyone help me with Treo/visor/usbserial issues, or should I just start tearing out my hair in exasperation?
2010-01-30T14:52:00.000Z	nexus_	politas	Yea but I really like the fact that ubuntu increases it's boot speed every release and that is one of the main reasons why I would like to reformat ever year
2010-01-30T14:52:00.000Z	politas	nexus_	it does that with upgrades, too. No need to reformat.
