2008-04-15T03:27:00.000Z	daire		i am trying to enable the multiverse repository but the guide on your webiste is for ubuntu 6.10 and talks about system > admin > software properties
2008-04-15T03:28:00.000Z	BarryToeman	daire	now it is sys -> admin -> software sources
2008-04-15T03:29:00.000Z	daire	BarryToeman	i tried that already and it does resemble the guide for enabling multiverse
