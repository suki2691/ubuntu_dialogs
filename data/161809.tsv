2006-10-31T12:02:00.000Z	landexem		I'm running Edgy Eft on a laptop, closed the screen (auto-locked) then came back and now my mouse cursor isn't showing up.
2006-10-31T12:02:00.000Z	landexem		I know it's there, I mean I can move it around a click on stuff, but I can't *see* the cursor
2006-10-31T12:03:00.000Z	landexem		I even tried changing the cursor theme
2006-10-31T12:03:00.000Z	anette_	landexem	try a restart maybe?
