2008-12-17T16:36:00.000Z	Bacta		Hi ReiserFS ate all my files. Can I get them back or would they be too badly mangled to be of any use? I had pictures of my wife in there too :(
2008-12-17T16:38:00.000Z	Bacta		Can we get Reiser out? He's good at finding dead things
2008-12-17T16:38:00.000Z	tiyowan	Bacta	Um, could you please explain what exactly happened?
2008-12-17T16:40:00.000Z	tiyowan	Bacta	Now I don't have any experience with this type of recovery, but, maybe this could help? http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/Hardware/ReiserFS_Data_Recovery_Tips
