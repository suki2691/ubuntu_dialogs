2005-04-02T16:06:00.000Z	kkathman	ubuntu	is debian-based I believe
2005-04-09T11:24:00.000Z	kkathman	ubuntu	is the most effortless install I've ever seen :)
2006-04-27T14:29:00.000Z	kkathman	ubuntu	is far more stable and has fewer bugs than kubuntu does right now
2007-10-31T08:16:00.000Z	kkathman	ubuntu	really sucks with samba :(
