2010-06-02T08:39:00.000Z	GuyCanada		hey guys so i saw a build for a machine using mythbuntu, it had 2 tv tuner cards and im trying to figure out what possible purpose that could serve
2010-06-02T08:39:00.000Z	GuyCanada		anyone have any ideas?
2010-06-02T08:39:00.000Z	Izinucs	GuyCanada	recording 2 different channels at the same time
2010-06-02T08:41:00.000Z	Izinucs	GuyCanada	one input but 2 tuners.. perhaps 2 cards provided 4 tuners
