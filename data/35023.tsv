2011-11-25T10:59:00.000Z	the_holstar		okay
2011-11-25T11:00:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	the_holstar	yes, but you might want to have a look at the different wine packages, some of the update more regularly, sometimes that causes regression with your windows programs
2011-11-25T11:00:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	the_holstar	also might want to install winetricks (very useful)
