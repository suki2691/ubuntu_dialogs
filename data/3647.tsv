2012-04-30T04:44:00.000Z	mk	varactor	is that the easiest way to do it? I was hoping for something simpler, like a tool that I'd have to use, and then reboot, and wait
2012-04-30T04:45:00.000Z	varactor	mk	i'd be easiest and safest to just use a live cd
2012-04-30T04:47:00.000Z	mk	varactor	ok - so I take it there's no such tool. I take it that a 7.1 boot disk will work fine? Will it mess up my boot?
