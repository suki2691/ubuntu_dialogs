2005-06-19T16:01:00.000Z	bob2	gmc	they're fine, us.archive is the only one which seems to have problems
2005-06-19T16:02:00.000Z	bob2	gmc	no
2005-06-19T16:03:00.000Z	bob2	gmc	(it's not run by ubuntu/canonical, the most anyone here could do is change the dns entry to point us.archive.ubuntu.com at archive.ubuntu.com)
