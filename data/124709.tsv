2007-08-14T14:21:00.000Z	Jminckoft		I restarted my ubuntu desktop (gutsy) and when it had finished loading, it didnt recognized my monitor (emachines TFT1560PS) but it did come up because i heard the sound on the logon screen. Is there a way i can fix this? (sorry about that incident earlier, fat finger then i got dced)

2007-08-14T14:22:00.000Z	Jminckoft	riotkittie	Nope, but there was an update for xorg that i downloaded shortly before i restarted
