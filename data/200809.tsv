2006-01-16T15:17:00.000Z	gimmulf		why is Wine 20050725 latest version in synaptic?
2006-01-16T15:19:00.000Z	arrinmurr	gimmulf	because packages in ubuntu aren't usually updated. only security fixes are applied. you can get the latest version from http://www.winehq.com/site/download-deb though
2006-01-16T15:31:00.000Z	arrinmurr	gimmulf	just try again, and again, and again. and if it still doesn't work, try again later.
