2011-12-04T07:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	dragomir	The most current available in the main repositories or the most current release of Firefox period? They will not always be the same.
2011-12-04T07:34:00.000Z	dragomir	Jordan_U	I am on 10.04 not sure what version of FF came on it. I Just know that I need to update it because my wordpress control panel says so. Whatever version you recommend I guess.
