2009-04-25T16:30:00.000Z	danbhfive	maxb	well, you might think its crazy, but its certainly not unusual.  That how everything happens in linux.  Its just not feature complete
2009-04-25T16:32:00.000Z	maxb	danbhfive	Sure, but when you're replacing one implementation with another, it makes sense to me to achieve feature-parity before changing over the default
2009-04-25T16:34:00.000Z	danbhfive	maxb	thats not how ubuntu works.  That would be called a "rolling release" type schedule.  Debian has that.  Ubuntu releases every 6 months, with the goal that the features that _are_ there won't be buggy.
