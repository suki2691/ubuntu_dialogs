2008-11-04T00:13:00.000Z	goruka		Hi! QUESTION! How can I force the refresh rate in ubuntu? it's stuck at 1024x768 - 60hz when obviously my 17" LG CRT can do up to 80

2008-11-04T00:14:00.000Z	goruka	someguy2008	nope, nothing in there
2008-11-04T00:15:00.000Z	goruka	someguy2008	all empty thanks to ubuntu failed autodetection
