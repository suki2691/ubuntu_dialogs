2008-12-22T10:58:00.000Z	magikfingerz	darkwatersyntax	ok, and you're sure that is the partition you want to use to install ubuntu...? :) sorry about the question hehe is routine :)
2008-12-22T10:59:00.000Z	darkwatersyntax	magikfingerz	I'm not really sure, its not showing the names, you still want me at the prepare disk space and not where  its prepare partitions correct?
2008-12-22T11:01:00.000Z	magikfingerz	darkwatersyntax	no problem at all... can you see the size of the partition and confirm if the size is the same as the partition you define to install ubuntu...? :)
