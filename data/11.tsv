2005-01-24T08:22:00.000Z	lifeless	paul_	put grandr on your panel somewhere.
2005-01-24T08:24:00.000Z	lifeless	paul_	do you want to change it temporarily, or permanently ? what I suggested is for temporary changes,
2005-01-24T08:24:00.000Z	lifeless	paul_	for permanent, I'm not sure, editing the config file stops it being regenerated... daniels/fabbione what is the right thing ?
