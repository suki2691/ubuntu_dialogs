2004-10-28T12:30:00.000Z	Dethread		anyone know where to get the "old" login theme? I don't really like the new one (after doing apt-get upgradew) with the "naked" people, but I can't get rid of it
2004-10-28T12:31:00.000Z	baHam	Dethread	just go to GDM configuration and change it
2004-10-28T12:31:00.000Z	baHam	Dethread	do ya mean the splash screen or the gdm ?
