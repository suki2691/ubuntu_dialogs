2010-08-12T21:39:00.000Z	sacarlson		dpkg -l  now who knows how to use that list to create a new system with the same packages?
2010-08-12T21:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	ramk	that is correct
2010-08-12T21:41:00.000Z	ramk	sacarlson	this may not help.. but what i do is save all my apt-get install app1 app2 in google docs.. so when i do a fresh install next time is easy
