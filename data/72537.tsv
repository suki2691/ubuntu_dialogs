2008-12-19T02:51:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Trijntje	try  tail -f /var/log/messages
2008-12-19T02:55:00.000Z	Trijntje	onetinsoldier	thnx, i looked in /var/log/messages, i think its a problem with pulseaudio "too many inputs per sink"
2008-12-19T02:56:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Trijntje	oh, i see. all i can say to that is good luck! at least it looks like i pointed you in the right direction to get started. you're welcome. :-)
