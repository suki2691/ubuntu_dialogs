2008-04-25T21:23:00.000Z	Mimi	Mapp	 we can get a better one working for you so go to sofware sources,.... then on that window look on the center,  click where it says Download From... then "Other" then "select the best server" let it do its thing, then click Choose server, close, and youre good to go :)
2008-04-25T21:41:00.000Z	Mimi	Mapp	I just tried what I told you (because I had the same error as yours when i tried to go to Add Remove earlier) and it worked this time :D
