2008-01-05T01:38:00.000Z	Onyx		I'm having no luck getting Amarok to use ALSA.  When I select "ALSA" in its config menu, it greys out the boxes where I would normally put the module... anyone been able to sort this out?
2008-01-05T01:39:00.000Z	TSK	Onyx	I've always used the Xine engine with Amarok and set the Xine engine to use Alsa as it's output.
2008-01-05T01:39:00.000Z	Onyx	TSK	How can I do that?
2008-01-05T01:40:00.000Z	TSK	Onyx	You'd just have to install the Xine engine (if it's not already installed) in your Adept or whatever package manager you use and then select it in Amarok as your preferred engine and then you should get a bunch of config options in there, one of which lets you select which audio output (Alsa) you want to use.  :)
