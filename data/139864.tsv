2007-04-09T08:53:00.000Z	dafart__		hi there, a quick question, when I install a beta version of feisty, will it be a tough nut to crack to update to final release once it has been official 15 april ?
2007-04-09T08:54:00.000Z	Toma-	dafart__	nope.
2007-04-09T08:55:00.000Z	dafart__	Toma-	foutrelis so it's just an apt-get update ?
2007-04-09T08:55:00.000Z	Toma-	dafart__	no, dist-upgrade most likely
