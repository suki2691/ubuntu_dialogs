2007-04-02T09:41:00.000Z	aabrahao		Hi, Ive installed ubuntu 6.10 server, and kubuntu-desktop, but in serverx I did not found webserver applications like apache, mysql, email, etc. Any tip?
2007-04-02T09:41:00.000Z	aabrahao		I imagine the ubunru server is with all applications, dont? If dont what is the real difference between kubuntu and ubuntu?

2007-04-02T09:44:00.000Z	craigbass1976	aabrahao	 sudo apt-get install apache (there's more to apache, but it starts with apache.  I think you hit tab twice and a list will pop up)
