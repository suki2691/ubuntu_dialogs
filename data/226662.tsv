2005-10-13T06:49:00.000Z	drew		another Q?  when I installed, i setup one user (me) with a password, but what's the root password as it never asked me for one?  Is it just my password?
2005-10-13T06:49:00.000Z	lllmanulll	drew	Ubuntu's philosophy is to not allow the root user by default
2005-10-13T06:49:00.000Z	lllmanulll	drew	You can do everything root can do by just using sudo, and your own password
2005-10-13T06:50:00.000Z	lllmanulll	drew	But if you really want to enable root, just sudo passwd
