2008-01-08T00:37:00.000Z	anipy	VSpike	tried to drag and drop the tab from one firefox window to another? :)
2008-01-08T00:38:00.000Z	VSpike	anipy	yes that kinda works, in that it opens the url like a copy/paste would but you lose the history for the tab
2008-01-08T00:39:00.000Z	anipy	VSpike	yep, extensions then
