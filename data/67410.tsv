2009-03-07T02:03:00.000Z	_VIM_	FrozenFire[work]	what do you mean by "well-supported"?
2009-03-07T02:03:00.000Z	FrozenFire[work]	_VIM_	Simple to do, requiring very little tinkering. I've considered X forwarding, but that can be troublesome, iirc.
2009-03-07T02:04:00.000Z	_VIM_	FrozenFire[work]	maybe tunneling VNC then
