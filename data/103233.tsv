2008-01-21T06:30:00.000Z	Airbender	tritium	thanks for the answer, but I had troubles autodetecting more than one display with the distribution packages of nvidia drivers(nvidia-glx-new)
2008-01-21T06:31:00.000Z	Airbender	tritium	by the way, is the package updated with the latest version?
2008-01-21T06:31:00.000Z	tritium	Airbender	no, typically not the very latest.  Once a stable release is made, only major bugs and security fixes are released until the next Ubuntu release (which occurs every six months)
