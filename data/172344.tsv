2007-03-20T15:37:00.000Z	soundray	skule	try installing linux-generic
2007-03-20T15:42:00.000Z	skule	soundray	linux-generic, what is the deal about that, new kernel ?
2007-03-20T15:43:00.000Z	soundray	skule	no, it's a metapackage that ensures you always have the latest -image- and -restricted-modules-
