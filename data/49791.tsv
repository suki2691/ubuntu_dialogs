2009-08-24T22:38:00.000Z	apparle	James147	But I think they realease the Specs for the cards when they are declared legacy
2009-08-24T22:38:00.000Z	James147	apparle	which means never for the newer better cards
2009-08-24T22:40:00.000Z	apparle	James147	yes.............but mine is quite old so I am waiting :)
