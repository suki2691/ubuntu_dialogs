2010-08-04T11:08:00.000Z	iammisc		okay so I'm trying to install ubuntu from the alternate cd (need lvm) and I get the error saying please insert disk .... I tried taking the disk out and putting it back in but nothing happens. Can I just edit /etc/apt/sources.list to install from online?
2010-08-04T11:10:00.000Z	iammisc		Do the netboot images support lvm??
2010-08-04T11:12:00.000Z	iammisc		Are the netboot images basically the alternate installer?
