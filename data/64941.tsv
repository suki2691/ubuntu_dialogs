2011-04-21T19:35:00.000Z	MC8		Well, whatever I have now isn't showing any text in half of the pdf's I'm opening
2011-04-21T19:37:00.000Z	MC8		Well, https://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/publications/statistics-and-data/hmps/noms-annual-rept-0910-addendum.pdf is showing blank pages with a few random lines and a couple of graphs
