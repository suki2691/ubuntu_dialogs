2006-09-28T08:07:00.000Z	eracc	snarf	there is if one uses the server install disc. It is one of the choices on the install menu.
2006-09-28T08:08:00.000Z	snarf	eracc	whurley, oh, cool.. but i'd just like all those goodies installed on my existing ubuntu desktop system. do i need to install the individual packages for that?
2006-09-28T08:09:00.000Z	eracc	snarf	probably. I don't think there is such a metapackage for desktop systems.
