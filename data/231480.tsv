2005-06-20T13:51:00.000Z	protocolX		Hi, I downloaded the latest version of ubuntu iso image and tried to install it from CD. The CD boots ok then it ask me to choose language, keyboard, locatin etc. After that It tried to get read package from CD and it fails. It gives me error that it can not read the CD device. Anybody knows what's wrong in here.

2005-06-20T13:52:00.000Z	protocolX		I can always boot the CD and goes little further with language,keyboard selection ect. But always fails when reading package info. from CD.
