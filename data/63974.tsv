2010-11-08T05:48:00.000Z	Megabyte		I am running vmware 7.1 with unity and it is very slow (guest: windows 7). Is it possible to speed it up?

2010-11-08T05:49:00.000Z	Megabyte	xangua	Oh, you are confusing things. Unity (in this case) is Vmware's seamless mode
2010-11-08T05:50:00.000Z	Megabyte	xangua	it integrates applications from the virtual machine into the host os as if they were running from there
