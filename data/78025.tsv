2012-06-10T00:36:00.000Z	mikkelb		At my homedir backup script at https://gist.github.com/2897952 - how do I skip the creation of the tarball if none of the folder's content has changed? And then move all old tarballs (which the script will then have made newer versions of) to folder "_purged" (create if doesn't exist).
