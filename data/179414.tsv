2010-08-31T00:20:00.000Z	whitepheasant		Trying to make a double click "instant start up" desktop thing. Usually, I make a file, type in "terminal commands inside", then save it and mark the file with permission to execute. (Those type of things will not need to run as root, but now I have this apache server that always bugs me to put in a password after I run a terminal command like this:       sudo  /opt/lampp/lampp startapache
2010-08-31T00:21:00.000Z	whitepheasant		SO i just want to "double click and forget".          This would be "same machine", I'm not doing anything over the network.
