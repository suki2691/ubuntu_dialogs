2010-06-01T03:16:00.000Z	Slart	Jimmymaniac	preferences, startup applications? or? I'm not actually sure what the service manager did?
2010-06-01T03:16:00.000Z	Jimmymaniac	Slart	No, actual services, the "daemons" to use the correct term, stuff like Apache, MySQL and the like
2010-06-01T03:17:00.000Z	Slart	Jimmymaniac	ahh.. yes.. now I remember.. nope.. haven't seen anything like that in lucid
