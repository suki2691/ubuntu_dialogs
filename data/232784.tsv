2010-05-12T03:46:00.000Z	Ryann_		Hey guys, again. I was wondering, if I removed the partition which contained my Kubuntu install, i'm currently running windows 7, would it mess up my windows 7 boot?
2010-05-12T03:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	Ryann_	you will have to reinstall the windows bootloader
2010-05-12T03:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	Ryann_	ask in ##windows how to do that
2010-05-12T03:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	Ryann_	it involves booting into recovery mode with an intaller disk and running « fixmbr » there
