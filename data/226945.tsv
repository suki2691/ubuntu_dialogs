2006-11-08T13:13:00.000Z	robertj_		I read recently on a bluetooth headset that using hte microphone with a PC was not a supported configuration. Is that globally true or particular to that particular model?
2006-11-08T13:13:00.000Z	variant	robertj_	that model only
2006-11-08T13:13:00.000Z	robertj_	variant	what standards does it need to work?
2006-11-08T13:14:00.000Z	robertj_	variant	does ubuntu support bluetooth mics?
