2009-12-08T11:33:00.000Z	Malvulio		I have a weird bug that I am wondering if anyone has heard of, running ubuntu 9.04 on a laptop.  When I am typing, mostly in pidgin, but also here and elsewhere, the curser will move by itself to a place back in the typed text while Im typing, and sometimes it even switches program windows entirely.  any ideas?  thanks!
