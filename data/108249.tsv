2008-05-18T01:16:00.000Z	simotempler		Hi anyone who can help me - a collegue and I recently moved on to ubuntu and we would like to share one of our folders on each of our PCs in 2 different cities so we can work on a project together - is this possible?

2008-05-18T01:20:00.000Z	javialquim	simotempler	you can donwload ultravnc server and client and get folders from each other but be warned it is very insecure
