2012-09-15T07:12:00.000Z	Nullzero-laptop_		found it lspcmcia
2012-09-15T07:12:00.000Z	Nullzero-laptop_		no output
2012-09-15T07:14:00.000Z	Nullzero-laptop_		so that's basically where I am at.  If i had anything in lspci i'm pretty sure I would have had this working, but since its not in there at all I'm out of ideas
2012-09-15T07:15:00.000Z	bkc_	Nullzero-laptop_	tried lsusb?
