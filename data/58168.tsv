2009-05-06T03:04:00.000Z	rapha		I'm just upgrading Ubuntu from 8.10 to 9.04 on a friend's PC and it wants to install LILO?!? Why would it replace GRUB with LILO?!?!
2009-05-06T03:04:00.000Z	DumDUm	rapha	ubuntu may not work with lilo
2009-05-06T03:05:00.000Z	rapha	DumDUm	i know and i dont want lilo but update-manager installed it - why, and can I safely remove it again?
