2006-07-24T08:08:00.000Z	JimD	Student	just what part of that is confusing you?  It's saying that it needs at least 1.8GiB and they recommend 4GiB (of free disk space) and 256MiB (of swap)
2006-07-24T08:10:00.000Z	Student	JimD	ok so there are 2 partitions OS root and swap and root should be more than 4GB and swap more than 256, right? Is there a recommended swap size too?
2006-07-24T08:14:00.000Z	JimD	Student	the widespread historical convention was to have 2.5 * RAM for swap
