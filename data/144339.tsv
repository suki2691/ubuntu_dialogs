2007-02-28T15:35:00.000Z	Lynoure	jnotaro	I probably cannot help right now, but out of curiousity is that on 5.1 sound system?
2007-02-28T15:36:00.000Z	jnotaro		No no, its a normal one
2007-02-28T15:36:00.000Z	jnotaro	Lynoure	It started alone, at first it doesn't work then I have installed some drives with automatix
