2012-10-11T08:16:00.000Z	J11		after changing partitions, how can I make sure the MBR of sda points to the grub /boot of sdc2?
2012-10-11T08:18:00.000Z	J11		yes from a livecd
2012-10-11T08:18:00.000Z	J11		but would that install the MBR in the sdc disk or the sda disk?
2012-10-11T08:19:00.000Z	yekoms	J11	depends, what harddrive is selected to boot when PC power is turned on?
