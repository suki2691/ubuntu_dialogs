2011-06-05T04:48:00.000Z	c2tarun	rww	Flannel : then I guess man page is incomplete :(
2011-06-05T04:48:00.000Z	c2tarun	rww	but why do they need two commands useradd and adduser for same purpose?
2011-06-05T04:48:00.000Z	rww	c2tarun	the /first line/ of the manpage is "adduser, addgroup - add a user or group to the system"
