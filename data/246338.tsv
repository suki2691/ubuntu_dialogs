2008-05-28T21:52:00.000Z	JonathanEllis		I am running Ubuntu 8.04. Some files I was working on a day or two ago have either reverted back to a previous state - including the filenames have changed or they have disappeared and the old files have reappeared. This has happened a couple of times in the last few days. I know I saved the new versions - and then I renamed them as well. One brand new file has also disappeared. I am beginning to think I am going mad - this is not just ordinary user
