2008-10-12T14:12:00.000Z	Bert_2		Hi, I'm trying to change my primairy DNS or add a secundairy but nm-applet isn't saving anything at all and editing /etc/resolv.conf doesn't work either, how am I supposed to set it then ?
2008-10-12T14:12:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Bert_2	resolv.conf is it
2008-10-12T14:13:00.000Z	Bert_2	Frogzoo	if I edit /etc/resolv.conf then nm-applet changes it again when I reconnect
2008-10-12T14:13:00.000Z	Bert_2	Frogzoo	and also there has to be a GUI way to do that, knowing ubuntu
