2007-11-24T04:08:00.000Z	Alucard85		Hey, I was wondering if anyone could help me out with a friend who is trying to install Ubuntu on his HP DV9000 with an AMD. When he boots from the CD he burnt and clicks "install/ Run from Disk" it does a coding search then the screen goes black and the disk revs down and stops. He checked the disc he burnt for error and there were none.
2007-11-24T04:09:00.000Z	Alucard85		The disc worked just fine on his desktop.
2007-11-24T04:09:00.000Z	acu	Alucard85	-did he downloaded the RIGHT version for AMD64 ?
