2011-07-12T02:10:00.000Z	Dj_Deutschi		I have a strange problem (using Ubuntu 10.04 with GNOME) when trying to run Gnome Run dialog with Alt+F2, it's starting the TTY2 then switching back to TTY7 (Alt+F7) the Run dialog is started, but it's creapy since Alt+F<num> is starting TTY and not Ctrl+Alt+F<num>

2011-07-12T02:12:00.000Z	Dj_Deutschi	qin	I have checked that but as far I'm able to see the Keys-configurations there is no problem
