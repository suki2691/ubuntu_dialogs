2010-07-29T05:42:00.000Z	lucenut		So I have my ubuntu machine on the local network. I can ping it's IP from the other machines. But I can't access the shared drive on the ubuntu from windows machines.
2010-07-29T05:42:00.000Z	lucenut		I went into sharing options on a folder on ubuntu. And it told me it had to install some windows pack...
2010-07-29T05:43:00.000Z	lucenut		So I did that, then it let me check "Share this folder"
2010-07-29T05:43:00.000Z	arrrghhh	lucenut	samba?
