2011-09-26T08:08:00.000Z	tomvolek		HI ,  I have a dual boot system, I have a data parition which is writeable by both windows and ubuntu.  This parition'sowner is plugdev.  Why is that ?

2011-09-26T08:09:00.000Z	escott	tomvolek	because linux and windows permissions are different so it uses plugdev to control access to windows format drives
