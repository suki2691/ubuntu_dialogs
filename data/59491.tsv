2010-04-09T17:03:00.000Z	kmpm	DNil	.so files are not ment to be executed directly
2010-04-09T17:04:00.000Z	kmpm	DNil	they are like .dll files in W
2010-04-09T17:05:00.000Z	kmpm	DNil	it's a flash player plugin for firefox I guess.... Just put it in the right folder and FF will pick it up.... but as chao06 said, there are better ways
