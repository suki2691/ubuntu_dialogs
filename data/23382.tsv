2010-10-29T02:25:00.000Z	Milosz	Daani	just install the compiler needed, it should take everything needed with it
2010-10-29T02:26:00.000Z	Daani	Milosz	hmm he told me to install cross-compilation toolchain and then later on Eclipse IDE
2010-10-29T02:26:00.000Z	Milosz	Daani	i'm pretty sure you don't need Eclipse
