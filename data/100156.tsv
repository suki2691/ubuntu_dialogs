2008-03-12T06:33:00.000Z	juank_prada	Flannel	brandonc503, then whats needed is to configure the routing or set dreamweaver to look for the static ip from the lamp server or domain if any

LAMP does nothing but serve content, Dreamweaver wants to upload to the server, usually done via FTP (although, if DW supports SCP, I'd definately go with that, you should look into it.  It's much easier to configure as well)
