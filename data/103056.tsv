2008-09-05T04:45:00.000Z	rconan	histo	well as i have now learnt those files are ones which have been deleted but are still in use by a program. apparently fuse doesn't hide these from the user. lsof to find out which program then closing and restarting it has fixed the issue
2008-09-05T04:46:00.000Z	histo	rconan	that would make sense then.
2008-09-05T04:46:00.000Z	rconan	histo	it seems the deluge web interface has a bug where it didn't close the file
