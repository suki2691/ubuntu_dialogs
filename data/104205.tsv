2009-10-14T11:52:00.000Z	jcarter		I just updated Ubuntu in the 9.04 release. I now find that none of my applications have the ability to resize or move the window. There is no border around the window. Some windows are actually positioned over the menu bar at the top making it impossible to select another application or whatever.
2009-10-14T11:52:00.000Z	jcarter		Anyone else have this problem? Or is there a preference that I need to set to get the application frame back?
