2008-07-07T06:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	will03	 there proberly some fuse ftp tools that can make the remote ftp server appear as a local directory. Might be other ways as well.

2008-07-07T06:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	will03	 This might do the trick -> curlftpfs - filesystem to access FTP hosts based on FUSE and cURL
