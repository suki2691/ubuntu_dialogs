2012-05-05T01:15:00.000Z	markburberry32		Good evening all. I wonder if someone could help me for one moment - I'm looking for some decent 3D software to use in Ubuntu or Kubuntu (preferably something universal if available) - is one available for these distros?

2012-05-05T01:19:00.000Z	markburberry32	MirkoKa	ok, I'll take a look at that, if it's relatively easy to use I'll give it a try. This is a guest machine for me, not my normal distribution, but I now have permission to install other stuff on it, so thanks :)
