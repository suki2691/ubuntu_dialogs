2006-07-04T06:16:00.000Z	cwillu		anybody know of any way to take the output of a program that thinks its talking to, say, an epson, or an hp4, and convert that to an arbitrary printer (via pdf, or whatever)?
2006-07-04T06:17:00.000Z	Nameeater	cwillu	you can get a pdf printer and make the program use that
2006-07-04T06:17:00.000Z	cwillu	Nameeater	that's the problem
2006-07-04T06:18:00.000Z	cwillu	Nameeater	I need something that can either take epson output, or pcl output, and turn it into anything else
