2007-01-24T09:24:00.000Z	gu014		My video card has has DVI-D which only straight DVI connection to the monitor is required and can not use any DVI to D-Sub adapter. Is there any adapter out there that would allow me to use the dvi output of this card to a vga lcd flat panel?

2007-01-24T09:25:00.000Z	blind		hey guys, any clue why my gnome-screensaver is hung up and I can't log into my system? i switched over to tty, and tried kill -9'ing gnome-screensaver, but i still have just a black screen :|
2007-01-24T09:28:00.000Z	gu014	blind	yes, i have tried two of the same exact card with the same result. i then emailed msi and received: "The card has has DVI-D which only straight DVI connection to the monitor is required and can not use any DVI to D-Sub adapter."
