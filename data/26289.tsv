2010-09-12T22:46:00.000Z	Talon_	coolrootbox	do you have the 3d/2d accelerations enabled for your virtual machine?
2010-09-12T22:47:00.000Z	coolrootbox	Talon_	i got a dual OS and in my main ubuntu 9.10 it works..but here in my win7 i tried running vbox and installed ubuntu...i set compiz manager but i can't make a 3D desktop on it....if in my main ubuntu 9.10 works fine...i bet also here in vbox right?
