2009-09-19T19:29:00.000Z	trijntje	diogo_79	system->administration->system monitor
2009-09-19T19:30:00.000Z	trijntje	diogo_79	or you can look into conky if you want it permanent
2009-09-19T19:35:00.000Z	trijntje	diogo_79	this is because manufactorers think 8*10^9 is 8gb, but linux thinks 8*2^30 is 8gGib
