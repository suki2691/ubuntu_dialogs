2007-04-04T11:45:00.000Z	gortba		Hello. I was wondering if someone would help. I'm currently using the knoppix 5.1.1 live DVD. I currently have Fedora Core 6 installed on my hdd. I would like to install Knoppix on my hdd over fc6. I'm not quite sure how to do this with the installer. I think I need to partition the hdd, but I'm not quite sure how to do this. The installer lets you manual partition as an option, but I've never done it before. Can someone help?
