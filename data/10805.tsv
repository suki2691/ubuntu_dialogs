2011-08-23T23:28:00.000Z	pticochon		last time I installed Ubuntu GRUB overwrote my neosmart boot menu, do you think it'll happen again this time? if yes what can I do to prevent it from happening?
2011-08-23T23:29:00.000Z	urlin2u	pticochon	put grub in the ubuntu partition.
2011-08-23T23:30:00.000Z	urlin2u	pticochon	use the something else option at where you want it and point grub to the Ubuntu partition, this is a custom install, and needs a bit more work there.
