2009-06-04T11:11:00.000Z	kazagista1	kukman	what kind of connection are you using... I assume /etc/ppp/resolv.conf is only for ppp DNS resolution
2009-06-04T11:14:00.000Z	kukman	kazagista1	nat connection via gateway
2009-06-04T11:15:00.000Z	kukman	kazagista1	Can I use resolv.conf somewhere else (I have /etc/ on read only fs). Is it possible?
2009-06-04T11:17:00.000Z	kazagista1	kukman	not that I know of, not without using unionfs
