2007-06-11T14:26:00.000Z	shedman		thanks, I wrote a new xorg.conf but it wouldn't work
2007-06-11T14:26:00.000Z	nickrud	shedman	man xorg.conf. There's also a bunch of man pages referenced at the bottom of that one, for vid cards, input devices, etc
2007-06-11T14:27:00.000Z	nickrud	shedman	do the dpkg-reconfigure thing and then edit to taste, it's much less painful
