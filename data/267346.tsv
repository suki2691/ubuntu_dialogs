2004-10-26T16:11:00.000Z	stratos		i hope the fashion fad called gentoo will go away soon. realy what's the point in waiting 5 hours of something to compile just to make it less stable and/or just a tiny bit faster.
2004-10-26T16:12:00.000Z	stratos		the world in general but that's not realy the point here :)  nah, i just have too many gentoo fan boys spamming a tech forum i go to often with pro-gentoo crap.
2004-10-26T16:12:00.000Z	neighborlee	stratos	I agree on that point definitey ( which is why I used { when I tried gentoo that is} stage3GRP <G>) but portage is another reason gentoo advocates boast about it....although i've seen alot of problems with it that or the maintaners use of it maybe dunno...
