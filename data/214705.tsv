2005-10-26T15:44:00.000Z	SigmaX		Breezy has been fairly good to me so far.  wonderful after coming from SuSE... SuSE was torture to a Debian-lover like me, though it took me 4 months to figure that out.

2005-10-26T15:46:00.000Z	SigmaX	nicks68	That very well could have been the problem.  I didn't try to SSH in, though I thought of it.  I'm pretty sure it happened at least once from the screensaver
