When I put a PerlModule directive in apache2.conf to load Apache::Registry, the apache failed to start up because it couldn't find registry.pm. When I try to install registry via a cpan shell, it doesn't see my mod_perl. Is there a way to get it to see the existing mod_perl so that it will properly install Apache::Registry?
