2007-05-09T14:47:00.000Z	mzanfardino		can anyone recommend a suitable appointment/calendar management tool?  I've a friend on Windows who uses Outlook and he's interested in converting to Linux.  One of the main applications he uses all the time is Outlook, and if I can't think of an alternative, he can't commit to the change...

2007-05-09T14:55:00.000Z	mzanfardino	gejr	I've just installed Lightning for Thunderbird 1.5 and I'm finding it works for what I think I need.  I've tested an invite from Outlook and it appears to work just fine.  I already use Thunderbird, so it's a no brainer.  Since my friend uses Outlook, I want to be sure I recommend something I can help support, so I think it will end up being TB
