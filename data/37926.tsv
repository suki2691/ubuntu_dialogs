2010-02-05T22:21:00.000Z	shadowshell		hello all...anyone have any suggestions on the best or most used mirroring app or script to mirror the entire archive.ubuntu.com
2010-02-05T22:21:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	shadowshell	best and most used likely are not the same.  Personally, I've had a good experience using ubumirror for full archive mirrors - https://launchpad.net/ubumirror
