2009-08-23T10:05:00.000Z	yellowrooster	Nautilus	ok. don't understand still.
2009-08-23T10:05:00.000Z	Nautilus	yellowrooster	say you have sata hd. It has a platter with tracks on it. Pick #123 for example
2009-08-23T10:06:00.000Z	Nautilus	yellowrooster	it is probably a double-sided platter so you have track 123 on both sides, that's the cylcinder. if there's 2 platters, theres 4 tracks in the cylinder
