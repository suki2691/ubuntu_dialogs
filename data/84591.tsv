2009-03-17T03:00:00.000Z	kc8pxy	BS2	 that is a insane way to run a *nix box. you only need root permissions for a few things, and otherwise, you should leave it well alone. having people assume they should administrator rights to a machine, to run day to day things, is one of the biggest doors windows has for malware/virii to screw your system.  ubuntu seperates this power intentionally. in part as a "fire break" for an intruder.
