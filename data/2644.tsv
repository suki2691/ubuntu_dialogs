2012-06-30T00:56:00.000Z	tdjones		Hello. I need help with Ubuntu 11.04. I have two folders on my desktop which are locked. How do I unlock them? Is it changing permissions? But I'm the administrator.
2012-06-30T00:58:00.000Z	tdjones		I mean that the folder has a lock symbol on it.
2012-06-30T00:58:00.000Z	tdjones		pancakes without removing the lock from it, I can't move it or delete it.
