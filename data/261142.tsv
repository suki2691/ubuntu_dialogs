2006-07-05T15:10:00.000Z	Crowe		Hey, can anyone help me? I have a problem with my video settings.
2006-07-05T15:12:00.000Z	Crowe		The actual problem is that my video runs slowly under 1680x1050 but normally under a smaller resolution.
2006-07-05T15:12:00.000Z	Ng	Crowe	what kind of graphics card do you have?
2006-07-05T15:13:00.000Z	Ng	Crowe	ah, I was going to suggest using the binary drivers, but if you already are then I'm not sure what else to suggest, I'm no ATi expert
