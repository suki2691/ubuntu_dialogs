2007-09-29T09:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	vishalrao	 given how gutsy is being  cleaned up. its a bit late for that. :) perhaps for the next release.
2007-09-29T09:26:00.000Z	vishalrao	Dr_willis	its minor stuff, like suggesting grub have a default splashimage, and include a torrent client and disc burner program in the default install too?
2007-09-29T09:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	vishalrao	 i imagine they got reasons for not doing that stuff. :)
