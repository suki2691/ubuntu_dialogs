2006-08-30T12:02:00.000Z	mompe		why do I have to recompile NVIDIA driver each time I boot? It works after compiling but when I reboot it doesn't work until I compile it again :(
2006-08-30T12:02:00.000Z	Rug	mompe	are you upgrading the kernel between boots?
2006-08-30T12:03:00.000Z	mompe	Rug	nope, just installed last version and uninstalled ubuntu's nvidia-glx
