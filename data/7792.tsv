2011-11-13T10:43:00.000Z	brjannc	pnorman	duplicity is the rsync on steroids one, right?
2011-11-13T10:44:00.000Z	pnorman	brjannc	haven't done enough reading on it. what I really need is the appropriate scripts. rsync meets all my needs, but I don't have the ability to write the scripts to call it to do the backups/restores and keep track of everything
