2008-10-14T11:39:00.000Z	Technoviking		I got a dapper server that is hanging after starting kernel log
2008-10-14T11:39:00.000Z	Technoviking		any ideas what would cause that
2008-10-14T11:41:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Technoviking	look in the startup scripts and see what's next ...    ls /etc/rcS.d /etc/rc2.d       is it hanging on klogd or after ?
