2009-10-21T19:45:00.000Z	Neremor		hello! Could anybody tell me which architectore intel dual core processors have, please?
2009-10-21T19:46:00.000Z	G_A_C	Neremor	how do you mean? there's dual core Pentium 4s, and dual core Core (and Core 2)
2009-10-21T19:49:00.000Z	G_A_C	Neremor	I think that's the Core 2 architecture
2009-10-21T19:50:00.000Z	G_A_C	Neremor	you can run either. If you have 4+ gigs of RAM then the 64 bit version, otherwise either will be fine
