2007-09-18T14:44:00.000Z	Discerer		if I have a disk of 1 partition with xp in it, is it possible to just chop off a few pieces and create swap and etx3 on that without ruining my xp installation?
2007-09-18T14:45:00.000Z	Pelo	Discerer	yes it is , you can use gparted from the live cd and the installer itself will give you the oportunity when the time comes
