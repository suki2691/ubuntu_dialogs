2007-05-21T11:26:00.000Z	livingtm		I upgraded to Fiesty from Edgy, and really like it so far. However, i use VMWARE quite a bit, which has trouble with the 2.6.20 kernel. Is it possible to downgrade the kernel?

2007-05-21T11:28:00.000Z	livingtm	dyrne	so it might mess things up pretty good eh?
2007-05-21T11:29:00.000Z	livingtm	dyrne	i wonder if i pick the kernel froma package if it will handle all the dependencies properly...
