2007-02-22T09:32:00.000Z	Stu_2		anyone have any luck with usb or pcmcia serial adapters for laptops and ubuntu?  I don't have one I'm trying to get to work, I'm in the market to get one that hopefully will work without too much of a struggle...
2007-02-22T09:32:00.000Z	`Matir	Stu_2	like a RS-232 serial port?
2007-02-22T09:33:00.000Z	`Matir	Stu_2	I have one based on a prolific pl-2303 chipset that works fine, plug and play
2007-02-22T09:33:00.000Z	`Matir	Stu_2	no prob
