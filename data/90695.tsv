2009-11-01T02:47:00.000Z	matthew1		saji...such as it won't update from 9.04
2009-11-01T02:48:00.000Z	saji	matthew1	Ya update is a problem... But on fresh install i have no problems at all..
2009-11-01T02:52:00.000Z	saji	matthew1	well I would still suggest a fresh install, as most of your PPA which you would have added will be deactivated during Upgrade..
