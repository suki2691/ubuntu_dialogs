2006-04-19T11:46:00.000Z	stickystyle		Does anyone know what the chances of having a package in universe being re-synced with debian-unstable?  I filed a bug https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/libpam-krb5/+bug/39582 for a problem, and want to know if i should wait or just go about patching the source myself.

2006-04-19T11:47:00.000Z	stickystyle	kbrooks	what does UVF stand for?
