2007-02-22T16:43:00.000Z	royel	slipstream3d	let me rephrase that then, I love the setup of emerge, I hate compiling for days .. I'm not a very patient guy!
2007-02-22T16:44:00.000Z	slipstream3d	royel	ahh, well, i wish they'd add portage to Ubuntu - it does support binary distributions (precompiled), there just aren't many available due to the nature of Gentoo
2007-02-22T16:44:00.000Z	royel	slipstream3d	for teh amount of optimization you gain for time invested.. I'd rather just load a binary :)
