2011-10-21T06:28:00.000Z	ssn767	shawnboy	Solution may also depend on the client your using to SSH.  I.e. where and how the keys are stored.  Also, if your using the same IP's can you use the same hostnames?
2011-10-21T07:34:00.000Z	shawnboy	ssn767	sorry I was absent. supper. About ssh and same ip & hostnames... I use same LAN IP for this machine, but I use ubuntu-jaunty for one hostname and ubuntu-lucid for the other.
