2011-10-25T06:15:00.000Z	Newbeeans		How do I update to 10.10? Updater is not showing the upgrades.
2011-10-25T06:15:00.000Z	zykotick9_	Newbeeans	by default LTS will only update to another LTS release (there is a way to change it, but I've never done it)
2011-11-13T21:24:00.000Z	zykotick9_	Newbeeans	everything in that paste suggests you're running gedit as root (with sudo/gksu perhaps?)
2011-11-13T21:25:00.000Z	zykotick9_	Newbeeans	DON'T use "sudo" for gui apps!
