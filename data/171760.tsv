2006-08-07T05:33:00.000Z	evilghost	Slaj	 I can, what type of wireless controller do you have?  Post the output of "lspci"
2006-08-07T05:34:00.000Z	Slaj	evilghost	 I'm booted into Windows right now.  I'll have to log out and back in again.  Back in a few?
2006-08-07T05:34:00.000Z	evilghost	Slaj	 Works for me.
