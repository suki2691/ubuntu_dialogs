2010-09-29T22:18:00.000Z	NilsH		Hi there, i created a folder with sudo, but i want to be accessible as normal user now, how can i do thath ?
2010-09-29T22:18:00.000Z	Tekk_	NilsH	chown [user] [dir] iirc
2010-09-29T22:18:00.000Z	Tekk_	NilsH	may be the other way around
2010-09-29T22:20:00.000Z	NilsH	Tekk_	greppy : Thx guys, chown worked fine. Tried chmod before, but i failed to do it with that. Thx alot!
