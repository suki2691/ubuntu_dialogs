2008-07-17T07:10:00.000Z	Candale		can someone explain the generic version vers the non-generic version of the kernel to me?
2008-07-17T07:11:00.000Z	sammyF	Candale	the -generic version takes advantage of multiple core, the -386 version doesn't
2008-07-17T07:11:00.000Z	Candale	sammyF	 thanks
2008-07-17T07:12:00.000Z	sammyF	Candale	np. Had to find out the hard way myself, as I was running the 386 and my brand new quadcore was awfully slow ;)
