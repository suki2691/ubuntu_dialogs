2012-03-10T01:19:00.000Z	Ebron		New install question. The partition manager has something called "EFI boot partition", however I was sure that the last time I installed ubuntu I just went for ext4 mounted on /boot - what am I missing here? Is EFI actually what I typically mount in /boot, or is it something else entirely?

2012-03-10T01:21:00.000Z	Ebron	CFHowlett	So what is this EFI good for?
2012-03-10T01:22:00.000Z	CFHowlett	Ebron	  IDK.  I've got it by I installed ubuntu with ext4 anyway.  Pretty sure efi is related to boot partition/configuration.
