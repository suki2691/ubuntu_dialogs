2011-05-25T23:36:00.000Z	peterhil		Hi! I installed Windows 7 on a machine with two drives and detached the Ubuntu drive when installing
2011-05-25T23:36:00.000Z	peterhil		Now I've got some problem about Windows not loading when Ubuntu is set to boot first at BIOS
2011-05-25T23:37:00.000Z	peterhil		And Windows boot loader tells me to "fix the system by inserting the Windows install DVD" and select repair system. Does this fuck up the Linux GRUB or something?
