2010-08-30T08:31:00.000Z	mbrigdan		Can someone help, Firefox removed all of my addons, which would normally only be a few minutes to fix, except that this is the 3rd time its happen, which is getting rather annoying. Anyone know what I can do?
2010-08-30T08:32:00.000Z	Coded1	mbrigdan	did you install firefox from synaptic / repo or off the site?
2010-08-30T08:33:00.000Z	mbrigdan	Coded1	Synaptic, but I've also tried the site (and the ppa) in an attempt to get it to work
