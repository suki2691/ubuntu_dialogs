2006-11-10T12:12:00.000Z	Fulcrum		can ubuntu read and write to mac journaled, and FAT32 windows hard drives with long file names?  anyone mix HDs?
2006-11-10T12:13:00.000Z	Fulcrum	dorto	i haven't tried it so not sure, and i think cranky is correct that its like linux firefox, but possibly quicker because its optimized for AMD and Intel chips
2006-11-10T12:16:00.000Z	dorto	Fulcrum	yeah, they have a separate version for my Athlon-XP processor. Will install it first in vmware and will try it out
