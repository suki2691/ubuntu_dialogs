2007-04-27T11:55:00.000Z	fredsa		hi guys, I'm going through the installer and I've come up against a dead end. I want to install ubuntu over my existing partitions, but the installer seems to want me to reformat my hard disc. It's step 4 of 7 where I get stuck.
2007-04-27T11:56:00.000Z	fredsa		How can I just leave the partitions as they are and select hdd1 as the root partition?
