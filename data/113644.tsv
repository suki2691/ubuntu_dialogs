2007-11-27T14:16:00.000Z	ere4si		I'm trying to make a pent2 400mhz with 64mb ram into a nfs server - is there a linux distro that will work on this?
2007-11-27T14:17:00.000Z	soundray	ere4si	try DSL or Puppy Linux
2007-11-27T14:17:00.000Z	ere4si	soundray	puppy doesn't do nfs yet - will explore dsl
2007-11-27T14:22:00.000Z	ere4si	soundray	dsl only has the nfs client... - thnx anyway - must be a solution
