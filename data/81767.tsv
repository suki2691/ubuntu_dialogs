2008-08-22T02:14:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Trader_T	they have been tryin to be more and more compatible.  depending on your hardware it shouldn't be an issue but i've had some older mobos that did not agree with any KDE app whether it was running in gnome or kde.
2008-08-22T02:14:00.000Z	Trader_T	arrrghhh	oh, then can;t work out why system keeps hanging for like 15 seconds
