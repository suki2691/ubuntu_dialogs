2009-09-06T13:31:00.000Z	[domon]		hi guys, i've setup an sshkey pair between my computer and my server...i'm able to successfully authenticate to my server with the ssh key for one user, but not for a second. my ssh pub key is in the /home/<user>/.ssh dir for both users, but only works with one (it prompts for a password with the other). any ideas on how to fix this?

2009-09-06T13:33:00.000Z	[domon]	grawity	nope, will check now .. thanks :)
