2008-09-21T23:24:00.000Z	{PseudoNymX}		Upgrading to 7.10: pros/cons?
2008-09-21T23:25:00.000Z	td123	{PseudoNymX}	7.10 has newer software / more support for hardware + newer kernel
2008-09-21T23:26:00.000Z	td123	{PseudoNymX}	although you should consider 8.04 since a lot of the bugs that were in the release have been resolved
2008-09-21T23:28:00.000Z	{PseudoNymX}	td123	If I upgrade to 8.X, what will be lost?
