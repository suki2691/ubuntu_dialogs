2008-03-03T02:19:00.000Z	PeP`		I'd like to install a server on a veeery old machine... (1997, amd K6 / 200 something..) is there an ubuntu server edition with a syslinux kernel? (for old configs.. :)
2008-03-03T02:20:00.000Z	Squawk	PeP`	I have installed debian on a machine not too far from that in the past (though was an intel something or other I think). Might be an idea to look at devian over ubuntu
