2012-11-14T10:33:00.000Z	harovali		hi, I'm trying to help a user who is typing some (unkown) keyboard shortcut, that has the effect of making all buttons in the bar AND all icons in the desktop to disappear. I've browsed thru a shortcuts webpage looking for a candidate that would be the cause of this, but I couln't find it. Which shotcut(s) could have this effect?

2012-11-14T10:36:00.000Z	harovali	almoxarife	yes, in fact I told her to be overly attentious to what she types. It happens only to her among many users, and in two different equally configured computers
