2008-09-06T23:50:00.000Z	Jockeo		How do I run a shell script? I've downloaded the file veetle-0.9.6-linux-install.sh that I want to run. I try by typing "sudo ./veetle-0.9.6-linux-install.sh" and it sais "sudo: ./veetle-0.9.6-linux-install.sh: command not found"
2008-09-06T23:50:00.000Z	Jockeo		I have navigated to the folder.
2008-09-06T23:51:00.000Z	Cycom	Jockeo	try sudo sh veetle- etc
2008-09-06T23:53:00.000Z	Jockeo	Cycom	It worked when I typed sudo sh, thanks!
