2012-08-15T21:29:00.000Z	StZ		Ubuntu 12.04, is it possible to force a window (in this case pidgin IM's) to open in a certain workspace?

2012-08-15T21:30:00.000Z	meshelton	StZ	im pretty sure you'll want to check the gnome shell documentation though
2012-08-15T21:30:00.000Z	meshelton	StZ	I could be completley wrong, I've looked for something similiar to that for cinnamon but couldn't really find anything
