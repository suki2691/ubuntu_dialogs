2009-02-28T06:27:00.000Z	bcurtiswx		Anyone, i installed an ubuntu mail server through the ubuntu guide.  Using dovecot, I seem to get the messages (as they are sitting in /var/mail/<my username>) but i can't retrieve them using a GUI (like squirrelmail or evolution).. can anyone help me find out why (i've searched the internet with no help, and logs don't show any errors).  im using mbox
