2007-04-25T06:20:00.000Z	BrokenLinux		This is more of an annoyance than anything...When ever  I open a new window (be it nautilus/new email in thunderbird, or w/e) It always opens in the top left of the screen...Is there a way to get gnome to remember window locations?
2007-04-25T06:21:00.000Z	BrokenLinux		Does anyone have that same problem?
2007-04-25T06:22:00.000Z	orbin	BrokenLinux	well nautilus opens where i closed it...
2007-04-25T06:22:00.000Z	BrokenLinux	orbin	I guess it's just me then :/
