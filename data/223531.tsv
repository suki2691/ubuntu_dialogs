2007-04-25T15:21:00.000Z	Parmenion		i would suggest downloading the fiesty version of edubuntu and installing on your daughter's computer
2007-04-25T15:23:00.000Z	Parmenion		OR you could try redownloading the cd you have jock_
2007-04-25T15:23:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Parmenion	I find "wget -c" works nicely.. usually the download just didn't quite finish and there's no need to fetch the entire thing again..
