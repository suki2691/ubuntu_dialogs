2011-10-23T05:32:00.000Z	chalcedony		i have a compaq armada 1700 (ancient laptop) that we put ubuntu on ages ago, and i can't find my note with the password, it's not wanting to boot to CDs of 8.04 or 8.10 .. ideas?
2011-10-23T05:32:00.000Z	chalcedony		it insists on booting to the existing ubuntu
2011-10-23T05:33:00.000Z	klync	chalcedony	set the boot device priority in the bios; try a different cd, eg knoppix or grml
2011-10-23T05:34:00.000Z	klync	chalcedony	sometimes that's a pain - keep rebooting while mashing del-f1-f2-f10-f11 ... that's my strategy
