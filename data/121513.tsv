2008-07-05T08:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jamiejackson	  You could manually unmount it . then remount it.
2009-02-19T21:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jamiejackson	 i recall having to set  which monitor was primary, and which was secondary.. but that was in the nvidia config tool. Not sure how else to do it.. OR drag the panel over to the other monitor. :)
2009-02-19T21:59:00.000Z	jamiejackson	Dr_willis	that might just work. i've got the bottom panel over, now for the top
