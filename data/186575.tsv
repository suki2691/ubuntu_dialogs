2010-04-12T01:26:00.000Z	HeavyJ409		 Before Ubuntu I had Windows Vista and I was able to put videos and music on my Sandisk Cruzer (flash drive) and plug it in my PS3 and be able to watch them, but now that I have Ubuntu when I put videos on my flash drive and try to watch them on my PS3 it say's there are no videos on the flash drive, I've always used videos in .avi format so I know the PS3 should be playing them, and I'm using FAT32, so I know the flash is formatted righ
2010-04-12T01:27:00.000Z	HeavyJ409		I know it's not the flash drive, does anyone else have any suggestions
