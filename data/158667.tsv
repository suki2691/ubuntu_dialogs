2008-12-17T20:56:00.000Z	SuwerRat		need a good firewall - work with a bunch of non trusting windows people and want to keep them off my laptop while jacked into the system
2008-12-17T20:58:00.000Z	SuwerRat		right now running firestarter  and not sure if thats all the protection I need
2008-12-17T20:58:00.000Z	Slart	SuwerRat	firestarter isn't a firewall
