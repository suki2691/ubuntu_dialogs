2006-05-18T12:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Karhuton	it does, but you have to use expert install to install it.
2006-05-18T12:49:00.000Z	Karhuton	Flannel	I'm running the normal install and interupted the Grub installation. How can I install lilo instead, without re-running the whole installation?
2006-05-18T12:57:00.000Z	Karhuton	Flannel	can I boot the system on the hard drive via the installation cd, with something like boot: linux /dev/sda2 (if the default image is 'linux') ?
