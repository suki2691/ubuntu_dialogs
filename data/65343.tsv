2009-02-27T11:15:00.000Z	Pontif_La_Rouge		I'm using this guide (http://mirosol.kapsi.fi/tx2020/tx2000howto.htm) to help get all my stuff working properly, and I'm on the stop to get my rotation screen working but when I input the command gksudo gedit /etcXll/xorg.conf a new window comes up but nothing is in it, and I'm also not sure how to add "option RandRRotation" etc etc
2009-02-27T11:16:00.000Z	storbeck	Pontif_La_Rouge	you typed it wrong, it should be /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-02-27T11:23:00.000Z	Pontif_La_Rouge	storbeck	what about the next step getting the screen to rotate using those commands
2009-02-27T11:24:00.000Z	storbeck	Pontif_La_Rouge	i dont know what you're talking about
