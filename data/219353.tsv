2007-01-03T16:22:00.000Z	NoEvidenZ		I've been using this computer for Windows XP for a few months now, and I've just installed Ubuntu on another drive. I'm wondering how to set up a dual boot for the two systems. Do I have to use GRUB?
2007-01-03T16:23:00.000Z	Flannel	NoEvidenZ	No, there are other alternatives.  Yes, grub is the preferred method.
2007-01-03T16:25:00.000Z	Flannel	NoEvidenZ	grub is installable from the ubuntu CD, and unless you opted out of it, was already installed, anyway...
2007-02-07T15:23:00.000Z	Flannel	NoEvidenZ	did he burn at 4x or so?  does the CD integrity check?
