2009-02-10T03:36:00.000Z	Deamos		Ok, Trying to connect Using Nautilis to a network share via the Network Browser, It shows the workgroups but when I try to connect to the workgroup, it reports Unable to Mount Share.  I can connect by manually entering the IP address in the Network Browser Windows. Any ideas how I can fix this?
