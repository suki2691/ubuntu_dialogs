2011-05-12T10:30:00.000Z	sraw		Hi I upgraded to Natty and it looks like I lost hardware acceleration for the UI... like for example I my terminal windows can no longer have true transparently, menus don't fade in and out and so on. Also I don't have an "Effects" tab in System > Preferences anymore. Could anyone help out?
