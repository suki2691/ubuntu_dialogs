2010-10-14T13:48:00.000Z	Gnea	rapha	I'm pretty sure they can help you in there with that
2010-10-14T13:48:00.000Z	Gnea	rapha	good luck

Just wanted to give word about #ubuntu-arabic that that's basically a dead channel, so it might be necessary to check if there's somebody there before sending people over to it. The one name you see in there looks like a bot.
