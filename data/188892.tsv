2006-10-04T05:10:00.000Z	Knifa		hi, i've just managed to get ubuntu installed on my core 2 duo system (to an IDE drive from an IDE cd-rom) using the latest beta, the install went perfectly and there was no errors while it was installing, but now when I boot it won't detect the drive again, or atleast it won't mount it, so I can't get in :(
2006-10-04T05:10:00.000Z	Knifa		anyone know what i can do to fix it?
2006-10-04T05:11:00.000Z	Knifa		yeah the hard drive is IDE
2006-10-04T05:11:00.000Z	blind	Knifa	can you mount the drive manually?
