2006-07-27T05:24:00.000Z	SuperCouilles		Anyone to help? I only need to "autostart" a program (run as service) and I have no clue... Anyone?
2006-07-27T05:25:00.000Z	micahcowan	SuperCouilles	as a service, when the computer starts up? Or when a user's desktop session starts?

2006-07-27T05:29:00.000Z	micahcowan	SuperCouilles	unfortunately, i'm not actually running Ubuntu right this minute; rather, KDE on debian, so I don't think I can investigate :(
