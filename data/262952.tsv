2010-11-11T09:50:00.000Z	Talon_		I'm running Ubuntu 10.04 and gnome 2.30.2, I have two monitors and they're configured as seperate X sessions. How do i change the background on one or the other? if i right click the desktop and chose change background image, the same image is applied to both screens. I want a different background on each monitor
2010-11-11T09:52:00.000Z	Talon_		i got two seperate X sessions right now just fine, i know they're seperate cause I got the gnome panels all different n what not.. I like having them seperate but i just want a different bg for each screen.
