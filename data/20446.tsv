2011-05-01T22:25:00.000Z	MrTolkinghorn		hey, anyone had problems with instability with a kernel? Whenever I have my stable overclocks on (4.2 ghz on a core i7) my computer crashes despite windows working just fine with hours of prime95...
2011-05-01T22:26:00.000Z	MrTolkinghorn		2.6.32-28 was the only truly stable kernel, any of the new ones crash
2011-05-01T22:27:00.000Z	MrTolkinghorn		which log should I look under for that?
2011-05-01T22:28:00.000Z	Chipzzz	MrTolkinghorn	I'm running 2.6.32-31 on two machines & they're both very stable
