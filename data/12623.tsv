2011-07-17T19:35:00.000Z	ia		Hello. I have a small question about hardware support - maybe anyone knows, does ubuntu(lucid)+nvidia fx5200(official proprietary driver)+monitor 1600x900 will be working well together? Maybe anyone have try/use something similar? I will be very appreciate for any feedback of using such bunch of sw/hw.
