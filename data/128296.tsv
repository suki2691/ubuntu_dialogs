2007-07-11T15:37:00.000Z	SkorpKing	Harbl	i use a loopback encrypted filesystem and it works great.
2007-07-11T15:39:00.000Z	Harbl	SkorpKing	What encrypting program did you use to set that up?
2007-07-11T15:41:00.000Z	SkorpKing	Harbl	just the tools available on the default install. google a bit to get an idea on which way will be the best for you.
