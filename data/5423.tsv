2012-02-21T12:43:00.000Z	Guest80881		hi guys, I just install 11.10 on a machine that already had Fedora16 on an LVM. Ubuntu overwrote my previous grub settings and I don't know how to boot into my Fedora now. Any help?
2012-02-21T12:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Guest80881	run:  sudo update-grub     do you see fedora listed?
2012-02-21T12:45:00.000Z	Guest80881		oh I see...let me look that up
2012-02-21T12:45:00.000Z	Guest80881	ActionParsnip	I do not. I'm thinking that's because in a separate LVM
