2011-02-02T02:01:00.000Z	nemetos		Hey all. I have just installed Ubuntu for the first time. I have two monitors connected to my computer and I have enabled dual screen. However, my "primary" screen is to the right and the other to the left.. makint it all backwards - how do i change which screen should be the primary one?
