2008-02-06T04:21:00.000Z	porcho		anyone can help me in dealing with a stuck installation? should I abort it or there's a less traumatic alternative?
2008-02-06T04:22:00.000Z	damien_	porcho	aborting and restarting shouldn't cause a problem?
2008-02-06T04:23:00.000Z	porcho	damien_	I think that the installation hung up by the time it tried to contact with the repositories...if I start the installation disconnected, will I be able to download the latest packages later?
