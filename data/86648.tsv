2008-06-30T08:10:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	princeOfCode	the nvidia drivers are better in linux, but that has nothing to do with the quality of the cards.
2008-06-30T08:10:00.000Z	princeOfCode	Seven_Six_Two	im lookin at some midrange cards for a dual boot desktop
2008-06-30T08:11:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	princeOfCode	look on the nvidia site under linux drivers to see what the closed source binary drivers support.
