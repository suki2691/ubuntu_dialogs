2010-03-10T05:12:00.000Z	dinosaurvskitten		I have a pdf with incredibly terrible, grainy fonts, yet when I select text in evince, I can see decent fonts (example: http://imagebin.org/88261). Is there a way to make evince simply render the whole thing in decent fonts instead of having to manually select the text? (or is there maybe a better pdf reader out there?)
