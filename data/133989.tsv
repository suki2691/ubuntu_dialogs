2010-06-05T21:18:00.000Z	banker247		hey guys, rather new to ubuntu been using it for awhile now pretty familiar with it.. i'm still dual booting it since i have windows vista installed first.. i'm ready to make the full switch. is there any benefit to wiping out windows completely and just boot ubuntu?
2010-06-05T21:18:00.000Z	banker247		will it make it run more efficiently?

2010-06-05T21:18:00.000Z	phlak_user	banker247	unless you installed it using wubi
