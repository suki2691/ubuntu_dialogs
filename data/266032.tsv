2006-08-01T09:33:00.000Z	philhinz		I recently updated Dapper and now my sound is broken.  It loops the first bit of any file it tries to play.  I have a VIA 8237 integrated sound.  Anybody else have this problem?

2006-08-01T09:37:00.000Z	philhinz		Stupid question.  Does changing the xorg.conf file affect sound?  I changed this on my machine before the sound died.
