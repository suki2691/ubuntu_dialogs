2008-02-12T10:44:00.000Z	riznarf	travisat	what do i need to do?
2008-02-12T10:45:00.000Z	travisat	riznarf	I don't know but I think you have to log into wordpress from your browser to set it up
2008-02-12T10:48:00.000Z	travisat	riznarf	I suggest you google for how to set up a blog with wordpress, if you plan on running a blog off of your computer you need to set up apache, mysql, and php and set them up, you cant just run a program called wordpress and get instant blog, it takes a little effort
