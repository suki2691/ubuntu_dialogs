2010-11-17T07:20:00.000Z	jsec		Hi all. For some reason my laptop (10.04) keeps locking up once every day or two. I can't change tty levels, restart X, nothing. There's no mouse or keyboard input working, and the only option is to hard reboot. Anyone have any ideas what could be causing this? I've had this setup since 10.04 came out, but this just started about a month ago.

2010-11-17T07:24:00.000Z	nits	jsec	oh... it happens sometimes for me as well but not every 2 days... maybe once a month or something like that... that's a bug in 10.04
