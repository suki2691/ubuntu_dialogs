2009-08-26T10:43:00.000Z	simula_		i just installed git manually, but when i do a "git --version", bash tells me that the program is not installed and to sudo apt-get it.
2009-08-26T10:43:00.000Z	simula_		i can run git by jumping into /home/user/bin and running ./git
2009-08-26T10:44:00.000Z	simula_		how to i get bash to be quiet about apt-getting a program i have manually built and installed?
