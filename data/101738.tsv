2008-03-01T23:11:00.000Z	Piddy		Hi. Is there a way for me to use both Windows XP and Kubuntu at a same time?
2008-03-01T23:12:00.000Z	K_Nine	Piddy	Try using VMware server.
2008-03-01T23:13:00.000Z	Piddy	K_Nine	Will I be able to choose OS when I start the PC or something?
2008-03-01T23:13:00.000Z	K_Nine	Piddy	You can have both open and choose. VMware server is now free.
