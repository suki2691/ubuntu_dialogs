2007-03-21T09:00:00.000Z	horde		Hi all.  The only thing that's keeping me from switching from Windoze completely is that dling from Usenet (with hellanzb and Klibido) is much, much slower than in Windoze.  But running a speed test in firefox gives same reading regardless of OS.

2007-03-21T09:06:00.000Z	horde	Pici	my hardware is quite new and IPv6 is enabled in Windows with no speed reduction and my web browsing isn't slow.  Only usenet binaries downloading.
2007-03-21T09:07:00.000Z	Pici	horde	Sorry. I don't use usenet and don't really know what could be causing that issue then.
