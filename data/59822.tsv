2010-03-06T22:57:00.000Z	DanDare		Hello. I booted Ubuntu8 Live CD; installed smbfs; mounted a Samba share located in another machine on LAN. Im getting permission errors while trying to copy files to the Samba mount point, why? I mounted it with the Samba user and password accordingly. The shared directories have the right permissions for the Samba user. What's going on? P.S. Im able to copy files to the share when using windowz without problem.
