2006-06-06T08:05:00.000Z	ndazza	makko	this is the recommended way to do it, as it doesn't open any security holes
2006-06-06T08:14:00.000Z	makko	ndazza	when i run "sudo konsole", i cannot open any x11 app from that konsole; but, when i run "sudo xterm", i can run any x11 app. how do you explain that? it doesn't look like a permissions issue to me.
