2006-09-08T14:44:00.000Z	enyc	Neo8750	hrrm well... for already installed packagess.. you can use dlocate
2006-09-08T14:44:00.000Z	enyc	Neo8750	install 'dlocate' and you well see what I mean
2006-09-08T14:44:00.000Z	enyc	Neo8750	i think you can do that for ubuntu official package repositories  via the  http://packages.ubuntu.com/ interface
