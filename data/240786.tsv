2008-07-18T11:26:00.000Z	paolo	Seven_Six_Two	ok... i give you a simple example. I need unison versoin 2.27 (otherwise I can't use it). Does that mean that I need to make the machine unstable?
2008-07-18T11:27:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	paolo	it might be. I don't know about that program's dependencies or what it does.
2008-07-18T11:28:00.000Z	paolo	Seven_Six_Two	it doesn't really matter what it does. My question is, how can I have that particular versoin, without having to download the .deb by hand
