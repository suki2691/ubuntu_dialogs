2010-06-06T16:33:00.000Z	bumpa_		Anyone knows why VLC is consuming 20% CPU usage when I play .avi/.mpg/.wmv/.flv files?
2010-06-06T16:33:00.000Z	ikonia	bumpa_	it needs to decode them, so uses cpu
2010-06-06T16:33:00.000Z	bumpa_	ikonia	but in windows it only uses 1% CPU
2010-06-06T16:34:00.000Z	ikonia	bumpa_	depends on the codec
