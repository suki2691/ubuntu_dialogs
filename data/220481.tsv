2008-09-01T09:38:00.000Z	lawrence		should i first install lvm before ubuntu or the other way round?
2008-09-01T09:39:00.000Z	Flannel	lawrence	Do you have the alternate CD?
2008-09-01T09:40:00.000Z	Flannel	lawrence	Ah.  You really should do LVM before (well, during) installation.  But you can add it afterwards, yes.
