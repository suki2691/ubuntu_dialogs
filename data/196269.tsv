2006-10-06T16:52:00.000Z	Zarephath		Interesting my M$ installed laptop still sees MSHOME as the smb server...I guess when I installed it defaulted to MSHOME opposed to Workgroup...anyone know how to make the windows machine refresh so it will see my ubuntu shares in WORKGROUP?
2006-10-06T16:52:00.000Z	Zarephath		I have verfied when I set my shares smb.conf changed to WORKGROUP
