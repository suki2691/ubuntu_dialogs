2007-12-18T08:12:00.000Z	LinuxEzGer8		Okay, so here we go again.  I put the 7.10 64-bit ISO I downloaded from the website on a brand new CD-R I bought tonight.   Reset the computer and let it run from the disc.  Choose "Run Ubuntu from Safe Graphic Mode" from the list.  It gets to 100% of loading kernal and then my monitor says "No Signal" and that's all she wrote.  Help if possible.

2007-12-18T08:13:00.000Z	FluxD	LinuxEzGer8	it seems to be some frequesncy error wait like 10-20 seconds
