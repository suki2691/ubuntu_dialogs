2007-04-28T15:49:00.000Z	cattellar		ok this sound noobish....  but I can't help from noticing a lot of users that put like apps in their desktop.... how are they called... widgets or what? where can I get them?
2007-04-28T15:51:00.000Z	predaeus	cattellar	there is e.g. gdesklets for gnome, superkaramba for kde, and also others, like e.g. cairo-clock for compiz/beryl  etc.
