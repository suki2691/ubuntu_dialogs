2009-10-19T17:12:00.000Z	marcriera	icarus-c	virtualization is not an option. We play with CUDA and GPU , with virtualization we loose lot's of MIPS and this makes a great difference
2009-10-19T17:14:00.000Z	marcriera	icarus-c	by unatended I mean a kind of PXE deployment, something that I can prepare and then I use it as many times as I need. I know I can do some anaconda scripts for Redhat based distros , but we play with debian and ubuntu, so I don't know if there is something like redhat-network or redhat-satelite on debian based distros
