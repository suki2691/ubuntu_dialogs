2006-01-11T10:31:00.000Z	hostcord		when i was trying to take off the button loader(thing that shows progress when you start up) it messed me in that now whenever i start ubuntu it gives me just the black terminal, like a command prompt, is there any way to set it back?
2006-01-11T10:32:00.000Z	hostcord		how do i change ubuntu from the command promp to the visual way?
