2006-07-31T10:44:00.000Z	dragonfyre13		I have a question about my nvidia drivers that is bugging me. I'm using nv now because my nvidia drivers fail due to a "mismatch" between the xorg driver and the installed one. xorg driver 7xxx and nvidia driver 86xx
2006-07-31T10:45:00.000Z	dragonfyre13		anywhere I can find a log file for xorg errors?
