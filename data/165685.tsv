2012-03-06T00:29:00.000Z	craigbass1976		I've got a router acting as a wireless point.  I've got an ubuntu box acting as a dhcp server.  I've forgotten the ip of the router and don't want to reset it.  Can I somehow figure it out externally?  I already did a traceroute 192.168.2.70 (where 70 if the ip of my android phone that's on the network) but it's only showing me one hop.
