2006-11-10T10:15:00.000Z	bretzel		btw, I have the same results using Beryl + XGL ( lag @every ~0.25sec ) same as in aiglx... might be the NVidia driver or misconfig in xorg.conf ...?
2006-11-10T10:15:00.000Z	lmosher	bretzel	isn't it possible to use beryl w/out xgl anf aiglx using the newest X?
2006-11-10T10:16:00.000Z	bretzel	lmosher	how to get the last X ? ( 7.1.1 ? )
2006-11-10T10:18:00.000Z	lmosher	bretzel	I'm not sure of the details as I haven't tried. Watch the Beryl forms they post some useful information and how-tos there
