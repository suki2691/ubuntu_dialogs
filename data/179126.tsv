2009-10-25T16:03:00.000Z	keegangrayson		hey, I have a question... I'm running the latest ubuntu beta, once the official 9.10 release is out, will I get all the features just from the upgrades being pushed out?

2009-10-25T16:13:00.000Z	jrib	keegangrayson	you didn't upgrade to 9.10 using apt-get upgrade/dist-upgrade did you?
2009-10-25T16:15:00.000Z	jrib	keegangrayson	man apt-get  explains the difference
