2008-01-07T11:29:00.000Z	elad`		Hello. I have one of those small ThinkPads, the 12". It has no optical drive. I want to install Ubuntu on it. Is there a way to do that with a disk on key?
2008-01-07T11:31:00.000Z	elad`		Anyone here knows how I can also install WinXP on that notebook? I have an original CD, but there's no optical drive. I have a DOK. Help?

2008-01-07T11:40:00.000Z	elad`	astro76	USB stick. Sorry, I was afk. I'm reading something about doing it right now, but if you've got other ideas, I'd like to hear them.
