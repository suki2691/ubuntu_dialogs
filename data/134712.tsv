2007-05-10T09:56:00.000Z	AdamPal		What ubuntu sources in apt.sources should I be using for a dist-upgrade from debian etch (unstable) to ubuntu (stable) ?
2007-05-10T09:57:00.000Z	rvilera	AdamPal	I agree, a direct cross update from debian to ubuntu is not the best idea on my mind
2007-05-10T09:58:00.000Z	rvilera	AdamPal	worse yet, migrating cross-os from a heavily customized os is like changing lanes in a turbo charged bus onto an oncomming train
2007-05-10T09:58:00.000Z	AdamPal	rvilera	I've done that before... it was fun... I'm still alive :D
