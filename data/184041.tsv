2008-03-10T04:36:00.000Z	ryanakca		Can someone help me figure out why (K)Ubuntu doesn't recognize my CD/DVD drive? see output of cdrecord -scanbus  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/58993/ . IDE CD/DVD drive. Running the two commands suggested in the pastebin produce similar results. Output of 'cdrecord dev=ATA -scanbus' here: http://pastebin.ca/935926
2008-03-10T04:38:00.000Z	EchoBinary	ryanakca	did you md5 check the iso? perhaps a bad burn?
2008-03-10T04:38:00.000Z	ryanakca	EchoBinary	I've had this install for the past year and a half.... it only stopped working 4 weeks ago.
2008-03-10T04:39:00.000Z	EchoBinary	ryanakca	perhaps a cable is unseated?
