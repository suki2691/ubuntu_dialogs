I wonder, how can I ensure I take all of the software with me that I'll potentially want to install? the installer CDs are only a subset and are built around the concept of on demand downloading

2009-12-16T23:55:00.000Z	kaie	DopeGhoti	thank you very much for pointing me to apt-mirror
2009-12-16T23:55:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	kaie	my pleasure
