2008-12-19T04:56:00.000Z	lordapex2		I've just installed 4gigs of ram but 'free -m' only shows 3292,  Is there something else that needs to be configured to use the rest of my RAM?
2008-12-19T04:58:00.000Z	Ltl	lordapex2	are you running 32 bit, only x86_64 will see 4gb iirc
2008-12-19T04:59:00.000Z	lordapex2	Ltl	yeah 32bit but i was under the impression you could load a 32bit with more then 4gigs if you use a different kernel?
2008-12-19T05:02:00.000Z	Ltl	lordapex2	32 bit has a limit, that subject is beyond me. google has a ton of info though.
