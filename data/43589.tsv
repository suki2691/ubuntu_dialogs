2009-12-09T20:52:00.000Z	Spoom		i am attempting to burn a dvd iso to a dvd+r in karmic, have tried with both brasero and dvdrecord, and both have failed, brasero with an unknown error, dvdrecord with "dvdrecord: Input/output error. reserve track: scsi sendcmd: no error", any ideas for getting it to burn successfully?
2009-12-09T20:53:00.000Z	Snossages	Spoom	have you tried other media?
2009-12-09T20:53:00.000Z	Spoom	Snossages	not yet, but this media has worked for me before on a windows machine
2009-12-09T20:54:00.000Z	Snossages	Spoom	can't assume that it'll behave the same with different drivers doing the work.  (though it is pretty uncommon, so we'll look at other possibilities)
