2009-03-18T01:25:00.000Z	confrey	n8tuserf	I don't think so, in kde network-manager works
2009-03-18T01:26:00.000Z	n8tuserf	confrey	-> well if you found kde nm to be working why not use it?
2009-03-18T01:27:00.000Z	confrey	n8tuserf	because I'm using gnome now, and I don't want to return to kde desktop
