2010-03-12T08:18:00.000Z	valley76		is it possibable to blow the read/write head on a cdrw/dvd+rw?

2010-03-12T08:21:00.000Z	Losha	valley76	do you have a known good disk you can try in it? Also, power-cycle it to see if that helps...
2010-03-12T08:24:00.000Z	Losha	valley76	sounds like it's crocked then, sorry....
