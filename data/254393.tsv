2009-01-14T23:05:00.000Z	stormblue		 I am having an issue with drapper server.  When the computer boots up if I let GRUB auto pick where I'm booting from the screen goes blank and I don't even get a prompt.  If I pick the recovery console, I then get a prompt, however, I don't think the recovery console loads everything on startup.  Any ideas on what would cause this? TTilus, Is there a better place to ask this question?
