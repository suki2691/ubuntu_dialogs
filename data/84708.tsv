But with wubi, ubuntu uses a swapfile I think, which is 256MB in size. I have 4GB RAM. Will hibernation work by itself or do I need to tweak some settings?

2009-08-13T09:01:00.000Z	the9a3eedi	jtaji	I see. that sucks. I only used wubi because I have limited space and I wanted ubuntu to be easily "transferrable" to another hard disk when I needed more space. oh well
