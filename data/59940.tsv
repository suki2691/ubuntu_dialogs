2011-07-29T13:07:00.000Z	slinzex		Hi there!
2011-07-29T13:07:00.000Z	slinzex		I was upgrading my ubuntu maverick, and get this error "Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-wine/ppa/ubuntu/pool/main/w/wine1.3/ttf-symbol-replacement-wine1.3_1.3.24-0ubuntu1~ppa1~maverick1_all.deb 404  Not Found"
2011-07-29T13:07:00.000Z	slinzex		What can I do? because upgrade is aborted
2011-07-29T13:09:00.000Z	nmvictor	slinzex	how about you remove the wine package temporarily to proceed with the upgrade then sort it later
