2011-01-28T22:53:00.000Z	Taravel		Hi, I should update the kernel of ubuntu 10.10 to a newer version. Can I use the packages for natty in this page? http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/
2011-01-28T22:54:00.000Z	Seveas	Taravel	why do you want to update?
2011-01-28T22:58:00.000Z	Seveas	Taravel	ok, then using that ppa is reasonable. Make sure you keep a maverick kernel around though so you have something to fall back on
2011-01-28T23:05:00.000Z	Taravel	Seveas	Is v2.6.37-rc2-maverick/ the newest kernel that can I install?
