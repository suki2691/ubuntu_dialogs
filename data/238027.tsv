2006-09-27T09:49:00.000Z	EvanIsaac		any answer to why the screen has been blank for such a long time?
2006-09-27T09:51:00.000Z	EvanIsaac		if i unplug m y laptop from the ac charger, move it upstairs and plug it back in will it screw up my upgrade
2006-09-27T09:51:00.000Z	EvanIsaac		in the middle of th eupgrading process
2006-09-27T09:53:00.000Z	IcemanV9	EvanIsaac	maybe .. logical thought would be wait until it finishes upgrading first before move it to upstairs
