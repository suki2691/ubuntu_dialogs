2012-11-01T03:19:00.000Z	aquethys		Hi again. So I hit F12 to boot from CD on my Hp Pavilion dv6-7043cl and when I hit select advanced boot options I only get the following: Repair, the Safe modes, enable boot logging, low resolution video, last known good config, directory services restore mode, debug mode, disable auto restart and disable driver signature enforcement. None of these are boot from CD. What am I doing wrong? :|
