2007-04-23T15:21:00.000Z	Niall		Anyone?  any ideas where to even look for solutions?   i've booted to the liveCD, loaded up the partition editor for my sata drive (sdc) and it will let me delete the old ext3 partition on there, but when i try to create a new partition of ANY type, Ubuntu will somehow automount the ext3 partition to my places menu, and the partitioning fails because the disk is in use!
