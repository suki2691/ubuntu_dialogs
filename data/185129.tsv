2007-03-10T16:34:00.000Z	duneatreides		i downloaded the source code for abiword, I untared in to a directory [ /home/(USER)/downloads ] , I cd'ed into the abiword directory, and I try ./configure and i get the error  " ./configure: No such file or directory"
2007-03-10T16:35:00.000Z	Flannel	duneatreides	why are you compiling Abiword?
2007-03-10T16:36:00.000Z	duneatreides	Flannel	jjust as an exercise, to increase my linux profiency, and I just want to run ./configure --help, I do not intend to actually compile abiword
2007-03-10T16:36:00.000Z	Flannel	duneatreides	that might be a nice reference.
