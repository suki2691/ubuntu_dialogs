2008-11-04T11:01:00.000Z	lovinglinux		Hi. I want to delete my windows partition to keep only Ubuntu. Can I delete a partition flagged as boot?
2008-11-04T11:01:00.000Z	profxavier	lovinglinux	if its setup properly, it will use the windows boot
2008-11-04T11:02:00.000Z	profxavier	lovinglinux	so possibly editing that will cause a boot just into linux
2008-11-04T11:03:00.000Z	lovinglinux	profxavier	so, there is no possibility to mess with grub?
