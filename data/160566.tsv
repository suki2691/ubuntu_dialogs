2007-06-30T10:41:00.000Z	Wyzard	Jordan_U	On a box with a fresh install of feisty, I see that "roaming" checkbox in network-admin and it's unchecked, but on the upgraded box, that checkbox is labeled "enable this connection", not "enable roaming", and it's checked
2007-06-30T10:42:00.000Z	Wyzard	Jordan_U	It's the same version of gnome-system-tools (2.18.1-0ubuntu1) on both systems, so why would that checkbox be different between the two?
