2008-04-21T07:32:00.000Z	Poe		Have a question... when I select ubuntu from my bootload after a fresh install it goes to a black screen... and the only way I can get it going is a safe boot and launch gdm through the command
2008-04-21T07:33:00.000Z	Poe		anyone have an idea where I should go?
2008-04-21T07:33:00.000Z	Poe		I mean where I should start
2008-04-21T07:33:00.000Z	Daisuke_Ido	Poe	at this point, no one wants me telling them where to go, trust me.
