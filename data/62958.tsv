2011-02-11T00:09:00.000Z	benovic		I experience connectivity issues throughout browsers since 2 Days (Form submission doesn't work). Even in Firefox Safe Mode or freshly installed Opera I cannot submit some forms. The only thing that works is to start the Internet Explorer through windows (virtualbox). I hate IE from the bottom of my heart. Where do i start fixing this? I have tried different browsers and proxies w/out luck

2011-02-11T00:12:00.000Z	kim_bruning	benovic	okay, well that eliminates the most obvious possible cause. :-/  I'm kinda busy with JesperSW atm, maybe someone else can give you a hand?
