2009-05-10T13:43:00.000Z	lflashlnzl		i have a windows 7 partition and i cant seem to resize it under gparted 9.04ubuntu
2009-05-10T13:43:00.000Z	roadmap	lflashlnzl	I'd say try the gparted boot disk.
2009-05-10T13:44:00.000Z	lflashlnzl	roadmap	should i just use the live CD? thats how i resize it the first time
2009-05-10T13:44:00.000Z	roadmap	lflashlnzl	There is a bootable gparted CD i prefer for doing partition editing work. I've yet to have a problem with it.
