2008-04-24T23:58:00.000Z	maco	excitatory	i dont get it.  pay extra for ati and nvidia cards which are pain in the rear or just use onboard intel which work like a charm....how is this a hard decision?
2008-04-25T00:02:00.000Z	excitatory	maco	well sometimes one just ends up with these cards.. i'm rather poor, and a friend gave me his old computer for my birthday, which has a ati card.. eventually when i get caught up on bills and such, i can afford to change the card, but until then i'm stuck.. so it's not fair to assume everyone can just choose what hardware they're using.
2008-04-25T00:04:00.000Z	maco	excitatory	i wouldnt even bother changing the card.  discrete graphics are just plain annoying on linux.  but if theres an ati card...well, those are always cards, they dont make onboard graphics.  there should be some onboard graphics in the motherboard
