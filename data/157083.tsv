2007-02-05T10:01:00.000Z	bill57785		I need a hex editor for kubuntu
2007-02-05T10:02:00.000Z	frogzoo	bill57785	apt-cache search editor | grep -i hex
2007-02-05T10:03:00.000Z	frogzoo	bill57785	you might also try emacs's hex editor mode
2007-02-05T10:05:00.000Z	bill57785	frogzoo	I type that in, but it just gave me a new command line
