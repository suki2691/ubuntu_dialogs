2004-10-16T06:35:00.000Z	allybally	RuffianSoldier	not an emulator, but a virtual machine, VMWare allows you to run windows within Linux
2004-10-16T06:36:00.000Z	RuffianSoldier	allybally	- Can i apt-get VMWare?
2004-10-16T06:37:00.000Z	allybally	RuffianSoldier	I don't think so, its a commerical piece of software - www.vmware.com
