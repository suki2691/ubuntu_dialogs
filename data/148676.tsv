2009-10-25T02:23:00.000Z	{Nathan}		I'm already a linux user, but I'm going to put a dual-boot install on my friend's computer. He has XP, do I need to use gparted seperately to resize the partition or will Ubuntu do it automatically?
2009-10-25T02:24:00.000Z	maco	{Nathan}	ubuntu has a partitioner built into the installer
2009-10-25T02:25:00.000Z	{Nathan}	maco	but will it erase all of the XP partition?
2009-10-25T02:25:00.000Z	maco	{Nathan}	no it can resize
