2006-10-27T06:30:00.000Z	kevin1		is there a newer kernel for edgy than 2.6.17-10-generic?
2006-10-27T06:31:00.000Z	Daviey	kevin1	why use the generic kernal and not one specific for your family processor?
2006-10-27T06:31:00.000Z	kevin1	Daviey	 can you get that via apt-get?
2006-10-27T06:32:00.000Z	Daviey	kevin1	yes
