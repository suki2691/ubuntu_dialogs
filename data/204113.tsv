2005-12-17T09:21:00.000Z	wildman		looks like someone had the same pb from perl when trying to configure postgresql (according to pastebin)
2005-12-17T09:22:00.000Z	bcl	wildman	I got those same errors when doing a dist-upgrade from hoary to breezy. Had to rerun it 4 times to get it to finish and never solved it.
2005-12-17T09:23:00.000Z	wildman	bcl	under Mandriva I haven't seen this pb at all... if I switch to it and run the same script, it doesn't bark about locale support
2005-12-17T09:24:00.000Z	wildman	bcl	so, I wanted to know if there's some pkg specific with perl locale support...
