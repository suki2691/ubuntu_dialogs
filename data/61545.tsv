2009-03-28T21:18:00.000Z	ChotaZ_		Hey, I'm having some problems getting teamspeak to work, I installed the teamspeak client for linux, but it made other applications that used the same output device get muted or crash, so I decided installed the windows client and running it through Wine, but now micro wont work. Any suggestions?

2009-03-28T21:26:00.000Z	ChotaZ_	erUSUL	any other suggestion?
