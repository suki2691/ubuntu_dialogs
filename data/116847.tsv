2008-03-04T09:49:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja		How do you define a Key1+Key2 shortcut in the keyboard shortcut editor? Pressin Win and L (for Lock Screen) puts in "Super L" which allows it to be triggered just by pressing the Win key
2008-03-04T09:51:00.000Z	Frogzoo	LSD|Ninja	try 'alt a' for instance
2008-03-04T09:51:00.000Z	Frogzoo	LSD|Ninja	Ctrl+Alt+A etc.
2008-03-04T09:52:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Frogzoo	I kinda want Win+L because that's how it's done in Windows
