2008-03-03T18:50:00.000Z	osfameron	Kate_mins	I think that's more an issue with the underlying filesystem
2008-03-03T18:51:00.000Z	Kate_mins	osfameron	sorry i didnt understand .. i am new to Ubuntu, does it possible to create 300,000 folders in same location ?
2008-03-03T18:51:00.000Z	osfameron	Kate_mins	I think it might be a bad idea due to a) being slow to browse, which may or may not be an issue, and b) inode limits
