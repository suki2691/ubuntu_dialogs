2009-12-13T22:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Meteora	 just uncompress it. cd into the dir it makes.. and run the new version from there. you dont really 'install' it.

2009-12-13T22:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Meteora	 i wouldent bother with trying to upgrade firefox then.  Just stick to whats included and learn the OS some more
