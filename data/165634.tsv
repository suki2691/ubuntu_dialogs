2008-11-13T00:44:00.000Z	piquadrat		Hi! I'm looking for an easy to use incremental backup solution for my desktop. Unfortunately, most of the programs I found are either quite complicated (rsnaphost) or dead (flyback, keep). What do you guys use for your backups?
2008-11-13T00:44:00.000Z	Winkie	piquadrat	i have a couple of TB rsnapshot install, works well

2008-11-13T00:52:00.000Z	piquadrat	Winkie	OK, I'll look into rsnapshot
