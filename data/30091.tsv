2010-07-04T21:44:00.000Z	Thopter		Is there an alarm clock program for linux that instead of using sound, changes the brightness of the computer screen?  I'm looking for something that I can activate when I go to bed, it will slowly reduce the screen brightness all the way to off, and then slowly increase brightness at a specified time

2010-07-04T21:45:00.000Z	Thopter	ghoti	yes, and it scrolled up, and new people have come in since then, so I'm reposting, thanks
