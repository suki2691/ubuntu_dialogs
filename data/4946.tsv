2012-05-01T23:05:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	deebee396	you installed ubuntu from windows right?
2012-05-01T23:08:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	deebee396	do you have multiple windows installs?
2012-05-01T23:25:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	deebee396	this is 3 methods to load grub to the mbr the chroot the 3rd is probably your best bet.  Make sure you have a windows recovery or install disc to reload the windows bootloader if needed.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Reinstalling_GRUB2
