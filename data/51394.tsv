2010-01-18T05:48:00.000Z	trism	atealtha	in 9.10 they are switching from SCIM to ibus, I couldn't actually get scim working correctly, but you can configure ibus by installing the input methods for your language in System/Administration/Language Support; selecting ibus as the input method and configuring ibus in System/Preferences/Ibus Preferences; then rebooting; you can start ibus with ctrl+space
