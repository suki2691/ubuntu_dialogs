2008-04-15T04:02:00.000Z	ShdwShinobi	dmsuperman	full disk backup as in the whole filesystem or just the hardy partition?
2008-04-15T04:03:00.000Z	dmsuperman	ShdwShinobi	the whole filesystem, minutes any extra drives mounted
2008-04-15T04:03:00.000Z	dmsuperman	ShdwShinobi	so yeah, just the gutsy partition :P
