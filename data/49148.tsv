2009-09-05T09:08:00.000Z	bmoloney		hello, I just recently upgraded to 9.04 and now I have 100% CPU show in the system monitor widget. But when I go to the system monitor (or use top) nothing is using that much CPU
2009-09-05T09:09:00.000Z	bmoloney		but things are definately running slow
2009-09-05T09:10:00.000Z	The_Bridge	bmoloney	: widget may have different detection method from native monitor
2009-09-05T09:12:00.000Z	bmoloney	The_Bridge	is there another way to find the offending process?
