2009-07-25T17:42:00.000Z	SirErugor	RanyAlbeg	you give your user's passwrod
2009-07-25T17:42:00.000Z	RanyAlbeg	ubottu	but if im going to run programs with superuser privileges why do i provide the user's password?
2009-07-25T17:43:00.000Z	SirErugor	RanyAlbeg	because sudo is configured this way.. so that you won't need the root password for everything
