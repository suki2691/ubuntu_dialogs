2010-03-06T20:15:00.000Z	{Mikey}		I have Windows 7 installed on a partition, and the remainder of the drive is 40GB, meant for Ubuntu 9.10. I installed Ubuntu and rebooted, but there is no grub menu, just jumps right to Windows 7. I've reinstalled Ubuntu, formatted the partition and reinstalled... anything I could think of. but nothing has helped.
2010-03-06T20:17:00.000Z	{Mikey}		I have two hard drives. But the second one was never touched during install.
2010-03-06T20:18:00.000Z	{Mikey}		And it would be highly unlikely that grub "failed to install" 3 times
