2008-05-17T23:44:00.000Z	Pincus		Is Ubuntu COMPLETELY free? or does it have non-free compoments?
2008-05-17T23:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Pincus	It has some proprietary drivers included as options by default.  If you're looking for "completely, 100%" Free (as in Speech), you should check out Gobuntu, Ubuntu's 100% Free flavor
2008-05-17T23:46:00.000Z	Pincus	Flannel	What does mean "proprietary drivers". Will I have to pay for them?
2008-05-17T23:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Pincus	no, if we're just talking free (as in beer) then yes, Ubuntu is 100% cost-free.  The drivers are closed-source, like video card stuff that nvidia puts out for their graphics cards.
