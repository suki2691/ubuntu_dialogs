2010-07-19T05:14:00.000Z	antonio_		My girlfriend just got a new phone (samsung sunburst).  I want to transfer a video that I recorded from the phone to my computer but I don't have a microSD chip.  Is there anyway to access the phone via the computer without a data cable/microSD...like can I connect to it with bluetooth?
