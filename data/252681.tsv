2005-06-19T11:48:00.000Z	Web-Designer		I have some questions regarding installation and versions.  Can Ubuntu and Debian be used in the enterprise area?  Or do I need to stay with something like Suse or Red Hat?
2005-06-19T11:49:00.000Z	HappyFool	Web-Designer	what do you mean by 'enterprise area' ?
2005-06-19T11:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	Web-Designer	you can easily install apache and samba, amongst many others
2005-06-19T12:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	Web-Designer	there's no such thing as the 'enterpise edition' ;)
