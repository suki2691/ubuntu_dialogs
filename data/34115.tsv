2010-04-12T23:17:00.000Z	ravi__	bramming9x	oh, couple of days ago, in this channel, I asked how to upgrade my commandline server from ubuntu 8.04 to new, and ppl said - wait, and directly upgrade to 10.04.. uhh,
2010-04-12T23:18:00.000Z	bramming9x	ravi__	you can upgrade from 8.04 since its LTS, but 9.04 isn't so you cant that way
