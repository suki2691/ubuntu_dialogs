2009-07-15T02:24:00.000Z	Xubuntnoob		does that even make sense?
2009-07-15T02:26:00.000Z	syslq78	Xubuntnoob	you want to rename files by appending them sequence number?
2009-07-15T02:27:00.000Z	Xubuntnoob	syslq78	- yea ( i think)  ---> ls -sequence  yields file1=1 file2=2 etc... so then i could type mv (sequence#1) /home/user/short.file.name
