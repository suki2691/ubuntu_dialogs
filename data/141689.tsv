2007-11-20T09:54:00.000Z	Owlin		I have an old DELL with Windows2000 on it and I want to add Ubuntu.  But it is so old that it doesn't boot from a CD.  Before I drag it out of the closet, is this doable?
2007-11-20T09:55:00.000Z	Ashfire908	Owlin	uh did you check if the boot order was correct so that it was configured to boot the cd?
