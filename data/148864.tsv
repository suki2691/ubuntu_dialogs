2007-02-09T10:30:00.000Z	unop	brombomb	can you give us an example of a "system app" ?
2007-02-09T10:34:00.000Z	unop	brombomb	 "system apps" are placed in quite a few places .. the libraries should be placed in /usr/lib/.., configuration files (if any) in /etc/.. and the executables somewhere in the $PATH .. usually /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin
