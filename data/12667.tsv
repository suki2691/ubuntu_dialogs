2011-07-06T19:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ozik	in redhat I've done raid 10 in hardware
2011-07-06T19:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Ozik	I didn't setup the array or the initial OS but I set some of it up. As far as I know its a bootable card but I'm not 100% sure
2011-07-06T20:01:00.000Z	Ozik	ActionParsnip	As I know GRUB2 should be installed on normal disk, like in Raid1, and raid 0 is stripped, it stops after 50% of installation and tell me that I need to do it manual
