2011-07-05T16:37:00.000Z	Osmodivs		Hello. I have a DualBoot, I have Ubuntu 11-04 64bits, I installed nVidia's propietary driver 270.41.19 in Ubuntu, and I want to install the most recent nVidia's driver to Windows XP 32Bits since I can't find the same one as Linux. Is it possible that the  2 different  divers work in the same system
