2010-07-02T09:07:00.000Z	synth		Is it possible to configure a WPA2 wireless interface in /etc/network/interfaces? Network Manager refuses to reconnect to my wireless. It did the first time.. ever since then it wont reconnect. even if I delete the entry and readd it.. so I want to go around networkmanager unless there's a fix. anyone?
2010-07-02T09:08:00.000Z	synth		or does someone know a fix for networkmanager.. cause I cant find jack on google
