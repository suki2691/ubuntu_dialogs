2011-01-30T05:46:00.000Z	a3ther_	LifeEscalade	 are you trying to connect from a remote machine to a vncserver on your current machine? if you are you can use the command 'sudo tcpdump -i wlan0 'port(5900) and port(3389)'' to check that you are recieving packets on those ports when you use the port tester.
2011-01-30T05:48:00.000Z	LifeEscalade	a3ther_	im trying to use the machine im on right now to access the desktop I have at my house. When im connected to the network I have set up at my house, rd works just fine. once I leave the network, nothing happens and the prompts I get are equivalent to "serverim.tryingto.connectto has closed the connection" or "could not connect to server.imtrying.toaccess"
2011-01-30T05:52:00.000Z	a3ther_	LifeEscalade	 check that the ports are forwarded correctly on your router. run tcpdump on the server to check that it is recieving packets from the outside on the specific port. if it is then it might be a firewall restriction of the network you are connecting from... check that you can connect to someone else who has the required service set up.
