2006-01-10T13:10:00.000Z	femtoguy		I have a quick question about grub and kernel upgrades
2006-01-10T13:11:00.000Z	femtoguy		I did a kernel upgrade, and it replaced my windowsxp line in my menu.lst file with the new ubuntu kernel.  I re-edited the file, and put the windows xp line back in, but it seems bad that ubuntu would wreck a set-up like that.
