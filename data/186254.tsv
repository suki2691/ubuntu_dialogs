It was pretty basic and only allowed one program to access the soundcard (/dev/dsp), which is why sound servers like Arts were made (Arts is the only program accessing the soundcard, and everything else accesses Arts). ALSA uses many devices and in a more sophisticated way. ALSA also emulates OSS
2006-07-14T11:32:00.000Z	squidgy	Warbo	 I see...thanks.  So given that this is linux, is there a possiblity that I can go poking around somewhere in /dev or /proc to access the volume at a more low level?  (I can't really use the system if it has no sound, and I really don't want to switch back to XP)
2006-07-14T11:36:00.000Z	Warbo	squidgy	Sorry, I was reading something. I don't think OSS is enabled in Ubuntu's kernels, so anything would be ALSA. It really seems like a driver thing to me, rather than a settings problem
2006-07-14T11:41:00.000Z	squidgy	Warbo	 it appears that I'm running a driver called "snd_hda_intel", which I imagine has been tested right into the ground since it's probably on every intel mobo made in the last few years.  Is there something I can do to attack this?  I'm a competent programmer but I'm new to linux and hence just don't know where to start.
