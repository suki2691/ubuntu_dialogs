2012-09-01T20:56:00.000Z	matthieu_		I encounter a strange issue with my web (wireless) connection on my laptop (Ubuntu 11.10) I'm able to have 540kbps (down) on all computers in my house (including laptop at the same distance from the box) except me. When i do a speed connection test, i can have this optimal speed immediately after booting. As i surf on the net, watching videos, download things, etc... it becomes slower progressively until 100-110 kbps and the
