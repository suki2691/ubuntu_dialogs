We also have the repositories download from a centralized location. So we update the main machine, and then the other machines update from the local network.
2008-11-14T14:07:00.000Z	fen`	ghostknife	why samba instead of http?
2008-11-14T14:09:00.000Z	ghostknife	fen`	so the machines don't have to store them locally
2008-11-14T14:10:00.000Z	ghostknife	fen`	ok. will check it out. thanks
