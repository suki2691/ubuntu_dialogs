2007-05-03T16:36:00.000Z	Markeda		Anybody here spare me a few minutes to figure out how to get something to install in Kubuntu? I've been ignored in #Kubuntu for three days now :p
2007-05-03T16:36:00.000Z	Markeda		At least I got a response this time :p
2007-05-03T16:37:00.000Z	Markeda		I've been through the documentation and done some research on Google, but I can't get anything to install on Kubuntu with Adept, tar.gz files or apt-get. Is there anything special you need to be able to install something?
