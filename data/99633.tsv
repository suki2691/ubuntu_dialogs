2008-10-03T21:00:00.000Z	bobertdos	jim_p	You mean mounting upon being plugged in?
2008-10-03T21:01:00.000Z	jim_p	bobertdos	yes. i want that disabled!
2008-10-03T21:05:00.000Z	bobertdos	jim_p	I don't know how to disable that, exactly. There might be some sort of option under System->Preferences->Removalble Media or Edit->Preferences->Media under Nautilus, but i"m not sure
