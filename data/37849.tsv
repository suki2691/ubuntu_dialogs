I'm looking at the page https://help.ubuntu.com/9.10/installation-guide/i386/index.html  it says This document contains installation instructions for the Ubuntu 9.04 system (codename “‘Jaunty Jackalope’”), for the Intel x86 (“i386”) architecture. Why does it say 9.04 when it actually is about 9.10 ? Don't you see "9.10" in the URL?
