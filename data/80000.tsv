Long story short, My setuid bit got screwed up and turned off on all the files in my system. So I tried to undo it, now I have some files that require a setuid, and some that are saying I shouldnt have it.

2012-07-16T01:59:00.000Z	bekks	NictraSavios	That screwed up your system. Hopefully you have a backup handy.
2012-07-16T02:00:00.000Z	bekks	NictraSavios	WE do not have a backup of YOUR system :)
