2009-07-11T00:25:00.000Z	vitovt		<KureIX> I don`t know really. I use KDE. I have no problems with amarok. There are a lot of bugs in kubuntu, but amarok works well. (Now playing :) )
2009-07-11T00:26:00.000Z	vitovt		DOES ANYBODY KNOWS HOW TO MAKE CUSTOM KERNEL WITH VERY CLOSE TO ORIGINAL CONFIGURATION ?! I tryed new kernel 2.6.29 for jaunty (from http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/) but there is no restricted extras. Where I can get config for restricted extra modules to build it by miself ?
2009-07-11T00:27:00.000Z	vitovt		<ubottu>: ok. Maybe there is better channel to ask about kernel compiling issues in ubuntu ? Give me an advice pls.
