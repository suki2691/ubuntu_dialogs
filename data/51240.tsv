2009-11-11T23:42:00.000Z	akiva		So, I switched from Amarok, since 1.4 is buggy as hell with ALSA and I cannot stand v2. I am still deciding between Exaile and Banshee. However, I am still looking for a good Tagging app. I like mass tagging ... EasyTag? I don't know how to use it ... Suggestions?

2009-11-11T23:44:00.000Z	akiva	trism	how does Picard get the tag info?
