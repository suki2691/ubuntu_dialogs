2008-07-31T22:40:00.000Z	Scorp_		hey, how do i use metacity instead of emerald ?? i've removed it from sessions menu so that it doesnt startup automatically, but that doesnt help still..
2008-07-31T22:41:00.000Z	geirha	Scorp_	uninstall emerald
2008-07-31T22:41:00.000Z	Scorp_	geirha	If i do that, then compiz wont work i guess....
2008-07-31T22:42:00.000Z	geirha	Scorp_	when compiz starts up, it looks for emerald, and uses it if it finds it. If it doesn't find it, it will use the gtk-themer instead
