2010-11-02T07:54:00.000Z	vzee-labs	blackshirt	I installed ubuntu on a 30GB drive but home folder is running out of space showing only 100MB left
2010-11-02T07:55:00.000Z	blackshirt		you have placed home directory on separated partitions ??
2010-11-02T07:56:00.000Z	vzee-labs	blackshirt	no on the same directory however df -h shows only 4GB usage out of the 30GB where has all the other space gone?
