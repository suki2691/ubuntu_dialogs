2010-05-16T01:39:00.000Z	Mrokii	hello	After the latest restart, my Ubuntu 10.04 didn't start up, but I was put into some kind of console with a "grub"-prompt. Can anybody explain why this happens?
2010-10-11T00:59:00.000Z	Mrokii	hello	I've had problems with crashing Ubuntu lately. And after one of the last crashes the left mousebutton stopped working. Does anybody have a clue what could be broken (apart from the mouse, which I doubt somehow).
2011-08-19T02:02:00.000Z	Mrokii	hello	Does somebody know of a problem that sometimes Bash-windows don't get keyboard-focues despite being the active window? I sometimes have the problem that the typing goes to another, inactive bash-window instead of the one that is selected. And I think I didn't have that problem before 11.04.
