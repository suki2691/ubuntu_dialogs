2008-08-01T03:07:00.000Z	derrich		I installed alsa-oss earlier today (for WoW + wine), and now I'm having trouble using the sound card in regular applications (running 'aoss <application>' doesn't work either).
2008-08-01T03:07:00.000Z	derrich		I can use the sound test app in System -> Preferences -> Sound
2008-08-01T03:07:00.000Z	derrich		When I click 'test', I hear the output - but no other applications give me sound :(
2008-08-01T03:08:00.000Z	moreau	derrich	tell other apps to use ALSA and see what happens
