2005-10-07T05:51:00.000Z	rusty-		I have installed Kpackage and the programs included are impressive. But I can not log in. When I try to it tells me root authentication failed.
2005-10-07T05:51:00.000Z	rusty-		am using ubuntu 5.04. Synaptic, the default package management program does not have some programs that are in Kpackage which I want to install and I am not experienced enough to install a ".tar.gz download.
