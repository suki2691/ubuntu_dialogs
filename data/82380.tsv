2009-10-06T02:17:00.000Z	PMantis	guntbert	update-rc only allow me to tell the scripts what number to S and K at. I want the script I used a few months ago that reads all the init scripts and re-orders and adjusts the symlinks for me to account for dependencies that I create.
2009-10-06T02:18:00.000Z	guntbert	PMantis	now I know what you mean - but my brain fails too - sorry
2009-10-06T02:19:00.000Z	PMantis	guntbert	Yeah, it ticks me off. I used it to build a client system, and I can't remember what I did. I had to search like crazy to find it back then, too. I even ssh'd in and looked at history on my customer's machine - too long ago. gone. :(
