2008-01-29T10:32:00.000Z	jc	adelie42	but when I install it that way there I don't get the menu option for wine installed
2008-01-29T10:32:00.000Z	adelie42	jc	menu option?
2008-01-29T10:34:00.000Z	jc	adelie42	this is the second time I've installed, the first time (I don't remember how I installed it) I ended up with a wine section under the applications menu which had a nice Programs subsection with my installed programs in it
