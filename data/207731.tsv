2005-11-21T15:41:00.000Z	onkarshinde	dirkson	And why do you think so?
2005-11-21T15:47:00.000Z	onkarshinde	dirkson	I would say otherwise. Using root account is live risk. I mean I am online in root, my system gets hacked and everything is open to external source. In sudo case attacker will at least need access to shell to do any 'sudo destroy'
2005-11-21T15:50:00.000Z	dirkson	onkarshinde	Yes, this is true. But when I'm online as root, I can feel free to take quite a few more precautions than I would be comfortable with as an everyday user.
