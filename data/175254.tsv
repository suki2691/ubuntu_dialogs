2008-07-19T21:32:00.000Z	Nutubuntu		I'm having a lot of trouble with Firefox freezing or crashing in Hardy on an AMD X2 box. Is this a known issue?
2008-07-19T21:34:00.000Z	tore_	Nutubuntu	works fine here
2008-07-19T21:38:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	tore_	_oOMOo_ - FF3 on a stock Ubuntu install originally, now FF3 on a stock Kubuntu install ... it's a long-standing issue for me, that has persisted over multiple releases of *buntu and on multiple boxen ; I don't believe it's a hardware issue
2008-07-19T21:41:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	tore_	_oOMOo_ - when it's possible to see the running processes, consistently FF has gone zombie. Sometimes X crashes or freezes and I can't check. strace has been unhelpful as well ... _oOMOo_ I used to have the same prob w/ FF2 but have not tested  FF2 recently
