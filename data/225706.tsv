2005-08-03T11:11:00.000Z	Hawkeye		but bsd is such a niche for the desktop. There's no compelling reason whatsoever to run *bsd over a linux based distro the way I see it
2005-08-03T11:11:00.000Z	Hawkeye		mostly due to the lack of updated drivers for hardware
2005-08-03T11:11:00.000Z	windex	Hawkeye	freebsd supported using my fasttrak100 as a hardware raid device out of the box. no linux distro i've used does.
