2011-11-10T02:58:00.000Z	thorn__		Ubuntu just paid for itself today: I edited an important pdf document and created a new template for letterhead for our non-profit org. My computer literacy program might just get off the ground. I need to come up with a schematic for our floor usage, can anyone recommend a architecture style cad program for Ubuntu that has a shallow learning curve?
