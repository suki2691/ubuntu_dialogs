2008-11-10T05:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	scott_	yes, you can't downgrade, you'd have to do a clean install of hardy
2008-11-10T05:19:00.000Z	scott_	jrib	IndyGunFreak: am i correct in thinking that the only way to get compiz working in ibex with an ati card is to...not use ibex, but downgrade to hardy?
2008-11-10T05:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	scott_	i don't see why you couldn't get compiz to wrk w/ Ibex, but I don't use ATI...
