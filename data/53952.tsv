2009-10-31T21:14:00.000Z	julianoliver	Tesssa	sure the password is the same?
2009-10-31T21:16:00.000Z	julianoliver	Tesssa	alternatively, i would check #xubuntu - ask in there. i'd say there's a file that needed to be deleted/altered in the upgrade that wasn't.
2009-10-31T21:17:00.000Z	julianoliver	Tesssa	definitely try the #xubuntu channel.
