2009-12-26T13:27:00.000Z	rww	mobi-sheep	mmm, there's totally a bug report for the amd64 one
2009-12-26T13:29:00.000Z	rww	mobi-sheep	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/zsnes/+bug/184255 is why amd64 isn't happening. There are complicated differences I don't understand between the list ubottu uses and reality that exist for some reason I also don't understand, iirc.
