2008-09-02T05:05:00.000Z	sloof3		I seem to have run into my second lockup after 1 week of uptime.  I can ping my remote server but I can't SSH to it. My only recourse is a power cycle.  How might I find out what caused the lockup after I have rebooted my server?
2008-09-02T05:06:00.000Z	arturo_on_rails	sloof3	are you sure is locked?
2008-09-02T05:06:00.000Z	arturo_on_rails	sloof3	ping replies would tell me that the server is up and running
2008-09-02T05:08:00.000Z	sloof3	arturo_on_rails	I'm getting an IP KVM attached within the hour.  It looks exactly like what happened last time.  1 week of uptime then locked..It's only happened after I went from 6.10 to 8.04
