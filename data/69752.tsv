2009-01-14T09:51:00.000Z	marabout_		can I run "fsck" at anytime to check on a possible problem or will this cause issues in Ubuntu?
2009-01-14T09:53:00.000Z	Gnea	marabout_	only when the partition is not mounted
2009-01-14T09:55:00.000Z	marabout_	Gnea	 it will cause issues when the partition is not mounted or I can/should only run "fsck" when the partition is not mounted...
2009-01-14T10:02:00.000Z	marabout_	Gnea	 I wasn't clear on your response regarding the use of "fsck"...
