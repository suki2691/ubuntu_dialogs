2012-03-18T02:17:00.000Z	mechanist		I have a new hard disk, and when I try to install ubuntu, the installer doesn't see the partitions in it, how can I do?
2012-03-18T02:18:00.000Z	velko_	mechanist	maybe there aren't any partitions if this is a new hard disk?
2012-03-18T02:19:00.000Z	mechanist	velko_	the hard disk contains data in it, and it's already partitioned
2012-03-18T02:20:00.000Z	velko_	mechanist	are you trying to install to this drive? or you are intending to mount it later and use it as a data store?
