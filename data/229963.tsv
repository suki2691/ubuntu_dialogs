Am i correct in believing that ubuntu follows the unix way, in that it stores all user settings in their home directory?  if so - would it be sufficient to tar up the couple of home directories I have, save on some removable media and then do a fresh xubuntu install, and finish off by untarring these home directorie

2006-06-07T10:10:00.000Z	captain_copyrigh		i'm pretty confident everything will be okay, but I don't need my girlfriend benig inconvenienced, shes in the middle of exams and has a french desktop with some nice settings to help her with her work and I don't want to degrade the usability at all for her...
