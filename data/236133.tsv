2005-12-20T06:20:00.000Z	Toma-		my gnome session isnt starting right. gets past the splash then starts making error sounds at me with no dialogs. i try loading xfce and i get no panels either. havent tried kde, but im in centericq now thru irc :( is there anyway to get some feedback from the gnome startup????
