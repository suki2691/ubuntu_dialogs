2007-04-01T08:50:00.000Z	vox754	kiat	the updates are there on my panel, but I haven't installed... I don't even use Office so I really have no experience, but it's good to know your experiences
2007-04-01T08:52:00.000Z	vox754	kiat	I guess reinstalling Open office might solve it. Have you rebooted? Give it a try.
