2007-10-12T07:59:00.000Z	markvds		hello, i am getting a bios error at startup and i think it may have something to do with the nvidia driver not working. it is something like "powernow-k8 error no psb or acpi_pss found"
2007-10-12T08:01:00.000Z	markvds		thank you i'll have a look
2007-10-12T08:02:00.000Z	markvds		but pike_ i don't even have a laptop and don't want to save energy by scaling my processors frequency, is that only about that?
