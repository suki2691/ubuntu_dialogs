2009-01-08T06:56:00.000Z	_dennister	dman	from my very limited knowledge of compiz, yes
2009-01-08T07:03:00.000Z	_dennister	dman	do you have any backups of your xorg.conf file? you probably do
2009-01-08T07:04:00.000Z	_dennister	dman	of course, if you really want to reinstall the whole thing, go ahead...i'm just suggesting there are probably backups of the xorg.conf file in your system so you don't have to reinstall the whole bloody thing
