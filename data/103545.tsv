2012-02-24T07:47:00.000Z	aboxorg		I run win7 inside ubuntu and I have access to everything I've tried. I can run wow, grab youtube vid's and convert them. Not happy with performance?
2012-02-24T07:49:00.000Z	aboxorg		Not really sure. What does WoW use? I tried that before. It's kinda why I did it at first.
