2011-07-06T21:18:00.000Z	Middle		I am having issues trying to restore my graphics basically. If i boot up in Ubuntu (or safe Ubuntu) i get a black screen, and i have booted up a live USB and chrooted into the linux partition, but no matter what configuration of drivers and removals i do i can't seem to get any life out of it! I have a couple of ideas as to why it might not work, but i woudl really appreciate a second opinion! Thanks : )
