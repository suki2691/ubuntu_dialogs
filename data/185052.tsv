2006-07-08T16:03:00.000Z	SonicChao	Pupeno	why?
2006-07-08T16:04:00.000Z	Pupeno	SonicChao	because I don't want to go thru 1000 little options trying to guess the best ones to get this beast to work. I've chosen Ubuntu over Gentoo and that was one of the main reasons.
2006-07-08T16:04:00.000Z	Pupeno	SonicChao	also, I do trust that the good Ubuntu developers, aside of options, have chosen a nice set of patches for me.
