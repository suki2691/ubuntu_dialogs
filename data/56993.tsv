2012-07-19T01:13:00.000Z	aethelrick	jollynips	I must say, I've been trying out gnome3 and unity for a while now and I'm sad to report that regular gnome3 is not as stable
2012-07-19T01:13:00.000Z	aethelrick	jollynips	and I'm not a unity fan :S
2012-07-19T01:14:00.000Z	jollynips	MonkeyDust	im just starting to learn the CLI in linux but i dont really know what what you said means, and aethelrick. thats a bummer, i think ill just leave it then
2012-07-19T01:16:00.000Z	aethelrick	jollynips	MonkeyDust, yup unity is a shell running on gnome3, my point was that installing gnome shell instead of unity resulted in flakyness and crashyness for me on 12.04 LTS so I've gone back to unity and it is way more stable
