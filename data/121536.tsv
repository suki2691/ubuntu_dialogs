2007-11-07T06:04:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	|neon|	Yes it is, it displays all drives (IDEs, too) as Sata connections. but I fixed it already. It's still weird, now I get an initramfs thing again, but whatever, I'll fix it again ;) weird stuff. I think there are a few open bugs about this behaviour
2007-11-07T06:05:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	|neon|	no I don't need a boot partition. I think renaming all the partitions in /etc/fstab from the UUIDs to the sdabcd things will work.
2007-11-07T06:08:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	|neon|	yeah, mine is too. I never had problems with it btw in feisty.
