2011-05-04T21:20:00.000Z	insanity99		i wasn't liking it at first, then i discovered the keyboard shortcuts, there great, especially if your a vim/emacs user :D
2011-05-04T21:20:00.000Z	nemo	insanity99	that's not the issue for me.  is more about what it prevents one from doing
2011-05-04T21:20:00.000Z	nemo	insanity99	I went on a bit about it in the unity sucks bug, so no point in rehashing here
