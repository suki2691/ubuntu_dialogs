2011-08-23T20:29:00.000Z	SMJ		Kontact is a good organization tool, but I need a cross-platform alternative, maybe web-based, maybe collaborative too. Any recommendations?
2011-08-23T20:30:00.000Z	SMJ		maybe
2011-08-23T20:30:00.000Z	schnuffle	SMJ	I'm running citadel, sogo, scalix and would recommend sogo or citadel. Citadels web frontend is old fashioend sogos clean and nice with some ajax
2011-08-23T20:33:00.000Z	schnuffle	SMJ	I mention both because they are open source. alternatives are kolab2 ( the original KDE PIM server, GPL), zafara, shandler, ogo ( python implementation of openegroupware)
