2011-03-02T05:07:00.000Z	Pici	starztorm	Yes.
2011-03-02T05:08:00.000Z	Pici	starztorm	Well, as long as those new versions are uploaded to the Ubuntu repositories of course.
2011-03-02T05:09:00.000Z	starztorm	Pici	aha. Does the repositories concern other games than those listed in the software center?
