2010-02-13T10:30:00.000Z	knoppies	rothsdad	yes. Install tightVNC server on your windows.
2010-02-13T10:30:00.000Z	knoppies	rothsdad	you could use realVNC instead, but I prefer tightVNC
2010-02-13T10:31:00.000Z	rothsdad	knoppies	yes, i use the tightvnc. but it doesn't work. I use realvnc on my windows.
