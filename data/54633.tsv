2010-05-04T06:31:00.000Z	hoglahoo-Lee		I just upgraded to the Lucid LTS and the sound sucks.  it seems like the volume is about 10% of what it should be when it is turned all the way up for both speakers and headphones.  Sound worked fine in 9.04 :(  Any ideas?  I've looked through some bug reports but none are describing exactly this issue

2010-05-04T06:32:00.000Z	hoglahoo-Lee		yes
2010-05-04T06:32:00.000Z	hoglahoo-Lee	goddard	I turned everything up to 100% for good measure
