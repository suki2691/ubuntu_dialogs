2009-02-28T14:40:00.000Z	laststraw1		As a new Linux (ubuntu) user I was experimenting with Dolphin and in the process I have set all folders to open with Dolphin. I cannot find a way to undo this so now when I click on Home or any other folder it opens with Dolphin and I get this message: "The file or folder /home/xxxx/'file:/home/xxxx/Pictures' does not exist." Can anyone help me undo this please?

2009-02-28T14:43:00.000Z	laststraw1	b1n42y	thanks.  Would you have a link to the page? Or is it easier to re-install?
