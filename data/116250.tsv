2007-10-19T09:44:00.000Z	gameforge		Hello, Kubuntu user here... in Adept Manager, when I click Manager Repo.'s -> Download From -> Other... -> Find Best Server, it just closes the "Software Sources" dialog and chooses the main US server (which is hammered right now).  It doesn't seem like it's doing anything.  What should I do?
