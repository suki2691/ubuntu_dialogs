2009-01-01T11:04:00.000Z	crimsun	Ghostindark	you likely need to touch /etc/inittab
2009-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	crimsun	Ghostindark	hint: daemontools doesn't quite fit in with upstart, so you'll need to find a hackaround for the inittab functionality
2009-01-01T11:05:00.000Z	crimsun	Ghostindark	you could write an upstart job
