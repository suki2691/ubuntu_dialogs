2008-01-22T00:56:00.000Z	n1bble		hi guys. kind of a weird situation. was upgrading from 7.04 to 7.1, and the power went out at about 80% install.  it boots to a blank background and mouse, but nothing after that, can also get to the other shells. any way to resume safely, or am i better off restarting?

2008-01-22T01:01:00.000Z	n1bble	DRebellion	- is there an "unsafe way" to resume?
2008-01-22T01:02:00.000Z	DRebellion	n1bble	i would recommend just starting again - format the disk when it asks you to
