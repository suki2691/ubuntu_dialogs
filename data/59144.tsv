2010-03-14T00:53:00.000Z	VCoolio	rabbit1	gtk2 themes will work on any ubuntu version; search gnome-look.org and use the rating system to find good themes; it's hard to poll here
2010-03-14T00:56:00.000Z	rabbit1	VCoolio	thx for help, but i have seen that, lots are there, not liking most. when even i install it from appearances, it goes to custom, it doesn't save as new install file, i will need to save it,,, why is it?
