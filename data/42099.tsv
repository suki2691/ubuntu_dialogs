2010-01-17T10:02:00.000Z	e_losier		I'm trying to install server ubuntu 9.10.  But it always either fail while partitioning or when installing base system (a perl deb corrupted).  I burned the CD twice, second time at 1X.  both verifies OK.  Any idea?
2010-01-17T10:02:00.000Z	sync3times	e_losier	is this the first linux install for this machine?
2010-01-17T10:03:00.000Z	sync3times	e_losier	what processor?
2010-01-17T10:05:00.000Z	sync3times	e_losier	  hmm,  is there an AMD server version?  are you installing that one?
