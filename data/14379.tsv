2011-05-12T05:16:00.000Z	MattEdward		I was considering using photoshop through wine, but I have a feeling it'll be slow on my laptop, so instead of a dual boot--where I'd have to go back and forth between nix and win--Im thinking wubi would be the best way to go, dunno
2011-05-12T05:17:00.000Z	escott	MattEdward	you may also consider gimp (heresy I know) or !VirtualBox
2011-05-12T05:28:00.000Z	MattEdward	escott	edbian thx, will look into virtualbox
2011-05-12T05:38:00.000Z	MattEdward	escott	I just realized I had used virtualbox on my laptop before to run nix and it seemed really slow
