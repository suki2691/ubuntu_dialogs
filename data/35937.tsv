2010-07-09T04:20:00.000Z	clayg		I'm using a netbook and trying to install a few games through wine/playonlinux.       I'm having some problems that I think might be because wine/pol is looking for an actual cd-rom drive instead of the images im mounting with gmount.  Is there anyway to "fool" ubuntu into thinking a directory is the cdrom drive?
2010-07-09T04:20:00.000Z	clayg		Like on diablo it's telling me it doesn't have the play cd in drive, while the play cd is mounted - installation works, playing does not, same with WOW
2010-07-09T04:20:00.000Z	clayg		well playcd image is mounted
