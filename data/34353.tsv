2010-09-20T17:35:00.000Z	Shwaiil		Q: I was trying to find a irc client and found XChat, downloaded it from the official website has a RPM but I couldnt install in ubuntu. I find a tip on how to insall it trough command line, worked just fine. My question is (has a linux newbie), what type of files are compatible with ubuntu ? Thanks

2010-09-20T17:40:00.000Z	Shwaiil	fruitwerks	thanks for the .deb tip. so, .deb is a executable ? I'm seeing that is easier to do stuff trough the terminal :X
2010-09-20T17:44:00.000Z	Shwaiil	fruitwerks	I'm trying to stick with linux only apps, otherwise I would stick with win7 :X
