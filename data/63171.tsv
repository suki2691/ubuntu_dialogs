2009-04-26T01:20:00.000Z	templaedhel		Ok, so I upgraded to 9.04, but ati and ubuntu screwed my system, so I need to go back to 8.10 until the next ati driver realese. I have separate home main partitons, all I need to do is install 8.10 on the main partiton and all my data will be left alone right?

2009-04-26T01:23:00.000Z	Squarc	templaedhel	just wait a few days I guess ?
2009-04-26T01:24:00.000Z	templaedhel	Squarc	no, because fglrx no longer supports my 2 year old card, so I need to use open source drivers,which have no 3d support,which is what I do
