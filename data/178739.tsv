2006-07-08T11:53:00.000Z	CalJohn		is LTS the same as Dapper?
2006-07-08T11:53:00.000Z	MrBrizzio	CalJohn	LTS just means that this version gets long term support
2006-07-08T11:54:00.000Z	MrBrizzio		iirc either Hoary or Warty was also an LTS
2006-07-08T11:54:00.000Z	CalJohn	MrBrizzio	oh, I remember the whole extended support thing...heh
