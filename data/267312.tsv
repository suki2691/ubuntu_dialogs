2004-10-28T10:15:00.000Z	tvon_		IMO, Helix player isnt really worth installing as it supports less than just about any player out there, RealPlayer supports Real at least
2004-10-28T10:17:00.000Z	SmokingFire	tvon_	thought helix supported real
2004-10-28T10:18:00.000Z	tvon_	SmokingFire	helix does not support real, only real supports real
