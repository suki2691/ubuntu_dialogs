2009-08-24T09:39:00.000Z	z987k		I'm getting this error at startup: ata4: link is slow to respond, please be patient (ready=0)  a while bunch of times but then it boots normally. does this mean the drive is starting to fail?  Or can I backup and format or write 0's to get rid of the error?
2009-08-24T09:40:00.000Z	the-erm	z987k	I'd backup.
2009-08-24T09:40:00.000Z	z987k	the-erm	what does it mean?
