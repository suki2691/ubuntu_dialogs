2012-08-14T03:12:00.000Z	DarkSim		Ubuntu 12.04, Is there any way to stream what I do to sites like Justin.TV. Windows have Xsplit, Livestream.com etc. etc. etc. but I haven't seen a single application about streaming in Linux, anyone have any idea?

2012-08-14T03:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	DarkSim	 I belive vlc  can somehow stream the desktop, or ffmpeg or mencoder.. not sure about other tools.. for 'real time' streaming. Theres also the webcamstudio that may be able to do it. (its not in the repos)
