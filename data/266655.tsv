2010-06-04T17:59:00.000Z	home		g'day guys & gals. Newbie here. I got a panasonic camera which has software that apparently can only be installed in windows or mac systems.  If i read it right, I need to install WINE so that it can install properly - right?
2010-06-04T18:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	home	 software to do what exactly? Most Digital camers can work as a usb storage drive/device and dont really need extra software
