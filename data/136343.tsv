2012-01-19T20:10:00.000Z	JesusChrist		Guys I keep getting the message "Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/ferramroberto/extra/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found" can I remove that repo?
2012-01-19T20:11:00.000Z	LjL	JesusChrist	yes, it'll be either in /etc/apt/sources.list or in one of the files at /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
2012-01-19T20:11:00.000Z	JesusChrist	LjL	out of curiosity. What is that repo?
