2009-06-11T01:04:00.000Z	Korogiannos	fccf	In what directory are the hidden files? I've looked in ~/Desktop
2009-06-11T01:07:00.000Z	fccf	Korogiannos	the actual link on Desktop is a text file which can be read by going to terminal and cd'ing into Desktop... find the file that says progname.desktop and typing sudo nano progname.desktop
