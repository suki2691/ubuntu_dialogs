2012-01-23T04:52:00.000Z	krozzi	Ben64	I know I can mount it but I have about 7TB's of images I would like to be able to script something to convert 1 ISO at a time and dump it into a new dir.
2012-01-23T04:53:00.000Z	Ben64	krozzi	you can't convert isos because it is an image, not a format for media
2012-01-23T04:54:00.000Z	krozzi	Ben64	I figured as much as well. Just going to be alot of work to re-rip everything and convert it manually
2012-01-23T04:55:00.000Z	krozzi	Ben64	I appreciate the help, I have to run for now. Have a good one
