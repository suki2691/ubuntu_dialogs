2008-07-04T05:18:00.000Z	wobblywu		was 8.04.1 delayed, or am I just impatient? the release date is today according to the hardy schedule
2008-07-04T05:19:00.000Z	crimsun	wobblywu	a bit late, eh?  http://releases.ubuntu.com/hardy/
2008-07-04T05:19:00.000Z	wobblywu	crimsun	lol I take it all back
2008-07-04T05:20:00.000Z	wobblywu	crimsun	didn't see it there a few hours back, didn't see an announcement on main just then, 1+1 equaled "delayed" to me -- nevermind :)
