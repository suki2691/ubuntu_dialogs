2009-06-10T22:07:00.000Z	unitxt		Anyone know if the issue with the fglrx display driver has been fixed in 9.04? I have a 'ATI Technologies Inc RC410 [Radeon Xpress 200M]' video apapter and last time I tried installed 9.04 gave me problems. 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fglrx' is the only place I know to go to learn about bug fixes atm.
