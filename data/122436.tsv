2007-09-19T11:48:00.000Z	stefg	console_jockey	that's a per-user setting, which is defined in the user control applet. But it will affect console logins too
2007-09-19T11:51:00.000Z	console_jockey	stefg	maybe I'm in the wrong channel.  I'm running kubuntu feisty.  I'm looking at the system settings screen but not finding anything save for default applications that might have anything to do with shell settings... am I missing something?
2007-09-19T11:52:00.000Z	stefg	console_jockey	user settings .... wherever kde has that. along all the group and home-dir dfinitions there's also a setting for the default shell
