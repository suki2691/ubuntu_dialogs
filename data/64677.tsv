2010-02-05T06:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cyberjunk502	xchm is in the repo (but i would NOT call it good)
2010-02-07T05:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cyberjunk502	perhaps a good question for #networking
2010-02-21T04:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	cyberjunk502	I entirely agree with what actionParsnip has just explained - you don't "need" another program BUT putty is in the default repository (v0.60) so to install "sudo apt-get install putty" would work, you should try to avoid "compiling" things whenever possible (makes life MUCH easier)
