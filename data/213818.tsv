2006-02-21T17:39:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	aio	I don't know, but I am curious, why are you trying to run Excel?
2006-02-21T17:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	aio	Maybe OOBase?  Don't know what mdb is.
2006-02-21T17:46:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	aio	Isn't Access the database program, so you should be trying with Base rather than Calc?
