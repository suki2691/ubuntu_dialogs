2010-03-21T03:00:00.000Z	lantizia		the cheapest new one on ebay is Â£1.99 lol... claims it works with linux... no idea of how to be sure it will however
2010-03-21T03:01:00.000Z	lantizia		Also I need to buy a new USB flatbed scanner... and I was hoping for a nice basic scanner recommendation... looked at the SANE supported list... but I was hoping someone may have a personal recommendation
2010-03-21T03:03:00.000Z	losher	lantizia	whenever I need ubuntu compatible hardware, I check newegg and/or ebay and look for something which reviewers say works well with ubuntu. This will save you no end of heartache at the end of the day...
