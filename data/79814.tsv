2010-06-19T00:17:00.000Z	Joshua_Roberts		what does the command sh do in the following command  sudo sh VMware*.bundle  ?
2010-06-19T00:17:00.000Z	Joshua_Roberts		does that just open the .bundle in a shell?
2010-06-19T00:17:00.000Z	Nitsuga	Joshua_Roberts	runs anything that starts with VMware and ends with .bundle
2010-06-19T00:19:00.000Z	Nitsuga	Joshua_Roberts	yes, in fact i don't know why use sh. sudo VMware*.bundle is enough (and in some cases maybe better)
