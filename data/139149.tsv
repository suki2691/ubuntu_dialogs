2010-10-27T03:58:00.000Z	eTiger13		i upgraded 10.04 server to 10.10 and now the welcome message that appears when I ssh in is doubled. it shows the welcome for 10.10 and 10.04. how can i edit it so it only shows the 10.10 message?
2010-10-27T03:59:00.000Z	lee	eTiger13	check out /etc/motd* ?
2010-10-27T04:00:00.000Z	eTiger13	lee	 if i manually edit that, will it screw anything up? and how does it generate the dynamic info like memory usage and other things?
2010-10-27T04:00:00.000Z	lee	eTiger13	don't know tbh, I have never cared enough to look into it =)
