2012-04-06T21:50:00.000Z	Amaya|2		I'm not sure if I could get used t ocommands, because not only must I remember then, but if I don't know them then I must search for them, whereas GUI's seem to require common sense

2012-04-06T21:55:00.000Z	Amaya|2	Dr_willis	I suppose that makes sense, but then i'm relying on other people to answer my problems and not Google, where I interpret what I see
