2011-05-01T23:48:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	Calif	rm yourfile.swp
2011-05-01T23:48:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	Calif	That means that you aborted vi withoug closing the file.  Just remove the .swp and edit again.  Any changes not saved will be lost.
2011-05-01T23:48:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	Calif	vi should also give you the option to (R)ecover the file.
