2004-11-13T10:17:00.000Z	imnes		I'm having a weird problem in ubuntu, keyboard dies.  On a toshiba laptop, I think it's a 2.6 kernel issue, anyone know where I should report the bug?
2004-11-13T10:18:00.000Z	imnes		I've tried disabling ACPI / APM and it still happens so I'm not sure what else to try to resolve it.
