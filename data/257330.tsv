2005-02-09T17:53:00.000Z	geppy	fhobia	 There are quite a few.  There's no do-all "msconfig". if that's what you're looking for.
2005-02-09T17:53:00.000Z	fhobia	geppy	well, my friend wants to startup vncserver...we're wondering where to put it
2005-02-09T17:55:00.000Z	geppy	fhobia	 Hmm... If you run it once, does it not set itself to run auto-magically on boot? Most of my services-related experience was on RedHat, so I'm at a loss for the actual configs.  =/
