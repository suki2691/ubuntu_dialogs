2012-03-11T02:26:00.000Z	luisr		i got a question how can i run ubuntu 11.10 as smooth as possible on acer aspire one windows 7 starter
2012-03-11T02:28:00.000Z	pfifo	luisr	by using the desktop livecd, its impossible to break, except maybe physically stepping on it
2012-03-11T02:30:00.000Z	pfifo	luisr	you can use grub2's iso boot feature to boot it from the disk drive, thats a big speed up, if you have 2+GB of ram you can also use the 'toram' option to copy the iso to a ramdisk (this runs extremly fast)
2012-03-11T02:34:00.000Z	pfifo	luisr	your on a livecd, so installing xfce most likely will not work, if you want to try it, get the xubuntu livecd
