2005-05-09T11:28:00.000Z	undre6k		I was browsin synaptic and I see          linux-686   Complete Linux kernel on PPro/Celeron/PII/PIII/PIV.  it is in the Base System (restricted).  If I installed this would it help me or hurt me? I have a p4 system

2005-05-09T11:29:00.000Z	indigirl1	undre6k	you won't notice a difference on a normal system, but probably has some compiler enhancements
2005-05-09T11:29:00.000Z	undre6k	indigirl1	yeah but what does restricted mean?
