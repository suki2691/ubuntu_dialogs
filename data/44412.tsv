2010-08-12T00:43:00.000Z	arrrghhh	tehowe	not that i know of...the config files vary greatly depending on what you're doing.  they all go in /etc for the most part if that helps.

2010-08-12T00:46:00.000Z	arrrghhh	tehowe	like i said, it really depends on what you're doing.  not like windows has a listing of ALL the ways to configure every piece of software.  sure there's the registry, but that's just a kludge.
