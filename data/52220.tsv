2010-05-04T22:27:00.000Z	OttifantSir1		Is there a faster way of finding and correcting invalid coding (using Scandinavian letters in filenames) than going through 15000+ MP3s and see which ones are marked?

2010-05-04T22:28:00.000Z	OttifantSir1	Pici	Is that in the repos?
2010-05-04T22:28:00.000Z	Pici	OttifantSir1	Yes, it is.
