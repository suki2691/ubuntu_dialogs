2009-10-06T12:20:00.000Z	snuxoll	Guest2298	does X start or is compiz that just fails?
2009-10-06T12:20:00.000Z	snuxoll	Guest2298	if it's just compiz then could you try metacity's compositor?
2009-10-06T12:24:00.000Z	Guest2298	snuxoll	yes i'm using two 1280x1024 lcds in horizontal dual head display, nothing really exotic
