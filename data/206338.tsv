2006-06-30T13:32:00.000Z	Madpilot	raddy	if you've got web access, you're far better off using apt-get to download packages
2006-06-30T13:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	raddy	that's not quite a URL - seriously, let apt-get deal with packages, it's far easier than trying to download stuff manually
2006-06-30T13:38:00.000Z	raddy	Madpilot	i have not yet configured the source in apt, but can't i get into that using browser? how do apt reads a path when contain spaces?
