2007-12-05T07:02:00.000Z	MrStonedOne		What is the command to make a "snapshot", or a list of the installed packages with apt-get, to be re-installed later with a similar command??
2007-12-05T07:03:00.000Z	kelsin	MrStonedOne	"dpkg --get-selections" you can pipe that to a file to save it
2007-12-05T07:04:00.000Z	MrStonedOne	kelsin	and how can i reinstall
2007-12-05T07:05:00.000Z	kelsin	MrStonedOne	dpkg --set-selections is the first step, after that there is a command to install them, if you google with get and set you'll find it quick
