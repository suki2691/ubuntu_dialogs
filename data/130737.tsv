2007-06-26T14:44:00.000Z	Master_Z		hello everyone, I have a problem and need help. My Sigmatel STAC9200 is detected by feisty, and I can even increase and decrease the volume, but there is no sound. Any way to fix this ?

2007-06-26T14:44:00.000Z	Master_Z	rohan	I dont think its muted, I have went into alsamixer and I see nothing muted.
2007-06-26T14:45:00.000Z	rohan	Master_Z	ok .. no idea then,  sorry
