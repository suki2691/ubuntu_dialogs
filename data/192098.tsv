2010-02-12T09:16:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	tetsuo_	I imagine because mpeg is encumbered by patents and the developers don't want to force you to violate the law if you don't want to
2010-02-12T09:17:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	tetsuo_	you could probably find that kind of functionality in restricted, though
2010-02-12T09:25:00.000Z	Sir_Fawnpug	tetsuo_	so your original method of dealing with it was to use the file browser to copy the files over?
