2011-05-30T23:51:00.000Z	oCean	Trfsrfr	the software not running on wine is not an ubuntu issue. Stop by in #winehq and try there
2011-05-30T23:53:00.000Z	oCean	Trfsrfr	the command Caboose885 is suggesting will install a third party repository. Please be aware that such software is NOT supported
2011-05-30T23:57:00.000Z	Trfsrfr	oCean	Caboose885 so what am I installing ?
2011-05-30T23:59:00.000Z	oCean	Trfsrfr	Caboose885:  but, once more, the fact that software does not run on wine, is a topic for #winehq, not here
