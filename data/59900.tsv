2009-05-16T01:53:00.000Z	xiong		we do everything in mac os with a gui and we do all sysadmin tasks that way and if you screw it up, you are screwed, so you learn never to screw up sysadmin tasks
2009-05-16T01:53:00.000Z	xiong		the notion of all this root vs user login stuff just seems silly to me
2009-05-16T01:54:00.000Z	rtk126	xiong	That is completly incorrect
