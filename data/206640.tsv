2005-11-28T09:37:00.000Z	sethk	ganoosh	it really should be primary, but the installer seems to like to make it logical
2005-11-28T09:37:00.000Z	sethk	ganoosh	it makes the installer program logic less complicated, but it's not the optimal solution
2005-11-28T09:38:00.000Z	sethk	ganoosh	although the difference is probably minute
