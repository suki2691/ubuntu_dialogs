2010-03-14T15:48:00.000Z	Brodz987		i have just installed the banshee media player. the first time i used the program it worked fine. now when i try to start it up, it crashed before it opens. i have tried unitstalling and re-installing with no better results
2010-03-14T15:48:00.000Z	Brodz987		what can i do in the terminal to check what errors it has?
