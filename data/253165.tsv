2005-01-26T09:27:00.000Z	mz2		does anybody know a utility i could use for converting oggs to mp3s?
2005-01-26T09:28:00.000Z	njs12345	mz2	oggdec and lame from the command line
2005-01-26T09:28:00.000Z	mz2		i've found plenty that do it from mp3s and others to oggs. i've already done it with a bash script but i'm not happy with my solution as I don't get the id3 tags to the newly created mp3s
2005-01-26T09:29:00.000Z	mz2	njs12345	naibed, been there, done that. i'm really looking for something more refined than that :)
