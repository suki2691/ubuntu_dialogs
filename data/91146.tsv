2010-01-27T03:32:00.000Z	spriizha		hello. I have a question - my gf have ubuntu now, but she is behind router ( which is not accessable for port forwarding ) - is there any possibility to have remote access to that computer if im using winxp?
2010-01-27T03:32:00.000Z	Izinucs	spriizha	not without port forwarding
2010-01-27T03:33:00.000Z	spriizha	Izinucs	but isn't there any chance to have something like p2p stuff?
2010-01-27T03:34:00.000Z	Izinucs	spriizha	maybe with P2P but you'd have to use someone else's server.. unless she connects directly to you.. you won't be able to connect to her directly without her initiating it.
