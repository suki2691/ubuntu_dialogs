2010-09-10T00:03:00.000Z	OpenSourcedNick		how do I reverse that ALT+TAB (so I go backwards)? ALT+SHIFT+TAB doesn't work (metacity) ...
2010-09-10T00:05:00.000Z	OpenSourcedNick		not for me, how do I set it back or what-not ?
2010-09-10T00:06:00.000Z	OpenSourcedNick		tried it, no option for reverse task switch
