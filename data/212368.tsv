2007-09-16T09:41:00.000Z	KurtKraut	moonknight	my card works out of the box.
2007-09-16T09:49:00.000Z	KurtKraut	moonknight	you can do an experiment... burn a livecd of Gutsy, the Ubuntu's next release that still alpha too boot up and check if it supports your card, if it is a too recent released soundcard.
