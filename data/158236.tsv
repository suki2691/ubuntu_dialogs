2008-01-10T02:37:00.000Z	Studiosus		Can I mount ext3 fs with specified iocharset? I have ext2 partition used under debian with koi8-r encoding, and I'd like to read it under utf ubuntu.
2008-01-10T02:38:00.000Z	Slart	Studiosus	check the man page for mount.. I think it has iocharset options
2008-01-10T02:39:00.000Z	Studiosus	Slart	unfortunately, common mount has no iocharset for ext2/ext3 fs =( I'd like to know if anyone knows some kind of workaround
2008-01-10T02:39:00.000Z	Slart	Studiosus	ah.. ok.. didn't know that
