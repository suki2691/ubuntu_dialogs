2008-04-26T22:06:00.000Z	jroes		hi, I just upgraded to Hardy from Gutsy and my graphics settings are messed up.  a dialog shows up on startup that says I'm running in low graphics mode, and when I change any of the settings to the proper resolution and such and click "Test", it always fails.  I have an NVidia Geforce 7900GT, and I had the restricted drivers installed in Gutsy.  Any ideas?
