2011-05-11T10:08:00.000Z	PyjamaSpank	celthunder	I am using UUID in fstab. I was about to format the drive when I noticed it was now sda. Conky is still using the old drive as /dev/sda, would conky use UUID as well?
2011-05-11T10:12:00.000Z	celthunder	PyjamaSpank	i don't use conky look at conky docs
2011-05-11T10:12:00.000Z	PyjamaSpank	celthunder	many thanks for that information, it's pointed me in the right direction and helped me understand UUID better
