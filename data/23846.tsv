2010-11-05T02:51:00.000Z	tphive	ActionParsnip	Staying away from 10.10 is only one thing, the reason I want an alternate install is because the normal disk doesn't seem to have any way to run an OEM installation, no F6 or "Advanced Options". I'm preparing this for a client, and want to retain the 'Out of the box experience'. (OOBE)
