2009-02-10T08:29:00.000Z	radec		ok i have a simple question but i can't figure it out. i'm trying to restore a mysql database via ssh. my password has an ! character in it. this seems to make the command line freak out and add a long command, something i typed a while ago, in the middle of my password (where the !) is. any suggestions short of changing the password?
