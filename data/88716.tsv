2008-06-14T05:28:00.000Z	kat_aq	Anacranom	most pcs that come with bluetooth also have some kind of indicator, like a light or a button that you can press with the Fn button to activate it
2008-06-14T05:29:00.000Z	Anacranom	kat_aq	it has to turned on in the pc before it would boroadcast that its there, thats the prob, its supposed to have the hardware, but i cant find it in lshw
