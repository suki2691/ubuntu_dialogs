2012-04-19T20:35:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha		Here is the background: I Installed launchy 2.5 for linux 64-bit from the website, and tried to set it up. Alt+space was taken so I disabled that shorcut in the settings, and then binded it to launchy. It worked fine until I rebooted and then complained about alt+space being used. So I switched to meta+space .. again it complains, then alt+control+space... same thing.

Tried to bind it to alt+space and meta+space ... failure. Rebooted twice, failure. Ran it from the command line... the shortcuts are taken? double checked the settings, they're not.
2012-04-19T20:35:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha		Summary: I was to know what is binded to alt+space and meta+space so I can unbind them, but I've went through the settings app and there dosen't seem to be anything binded to them. Any assitance would be greatly appreacted and I can supply any details needed.
