2010-02-24T11:01:00.000Z	Longjohns_75659		Hello! Could someone please tell me how to get rid of the animation for minimising windows in Gnome?
2010-02-24T11:03:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Longjohns_75659	if you want to disable all Compiz stuff System / Preferences / Appearance - Visual Effect tab, set to none.  If you only want to get rid of the minimizing, you might need to use ccsm (perhaps simple-ccsm as well, i've never played with it though)
2010-02-24T11:04:00.000Z	Longjohns_75659	ZykoticK9	I have the effects set to none, but still get an annoying, black rectangle shrinking towards the bottom left corner
2010-02-24T11:04:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Longjohns_75659	oh that's "just" gnome then, don't know how to make any affect on that, sorry
