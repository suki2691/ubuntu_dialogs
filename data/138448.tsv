2007-07-01T14:45:00.000Z	geck1		would someone be able to help me with my clock?  I have ntp and ntpdate installed, and I have servers selected, and it's set to synchronize with internet servers...but I can't click the "synchronize now" button (it's greyed out), and it's definitely not displaying the right time, even after I've restarted. Any ideas?

2007-07-01T14:46:00.000Z	magnetron	geck1	set it to manual and hit the button!
2007-07-01T14:47:00.000Z	magnetron	geck1	also, ntp is unable to adjust for large time differences. try setting to something more correct
