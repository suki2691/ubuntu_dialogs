2005-01-10T17:00:00.000Z	siretart		can someone help me to understand the evolution crash? I just updated evolution-data-center, and now evolution crashes immediatly at startup :(
2005-01-10T06:13:00.000Z	siretart		is evolution/hoary installable ATM?
2005-01-10T06:15:00.000Z	phosphorgreen	siretart	i upgraded to hoary on a devel box last week, seemed fine, didnt do much with it though
2005-01-10T06:15:00.000Z	siretart	phosphorgreen	I'm missing libegroupwise1.2-0, evolution is depending on that lib, but it's not available
