2010-09-13T20:00:00.000Z	bruzer		Hey was just here, what was the command for deleting folders?
2010-09-13T20:01:00.000Z	bastidrazor	bruzer	rm -r  or rmdir
2010-09-13T20:02:00.000Z	bastidrazor	bruzer	no, that would be a bad idea to run
2010-09-13T20:07:00.000Z	bastidrazor	bruzer	rm -r /usr/lib/w   with sudo. your previous statement left out the last / which would have been very bad
