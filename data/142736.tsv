2007-05-04T13:26:00.000Z	no-use		Hi, I changed from gentoo to ubuntu and kept my /home folder completly. Now when I want to run for example wine from a terminal I get everytime: No such file or folder. (It's installed for sure) I got the feeling this is some PATH or other configuration leftover from my gentoo, but I can't seem to find it. Any ideas?
