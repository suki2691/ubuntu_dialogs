2012-07-19T20:35:00.000Z	UICTamale		Hey everyone - As of a recent apt-get update && upgrade, I'm suddenly noticing really bad delays in using google Chrome - selecting text, scrolling, changing tabs - all these operations can take a few seconds now when they used to be instant.  Can anyone help? This is killing my productivity today.
