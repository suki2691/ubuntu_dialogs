2007-01-08T06:33:00.000Z	eitan		I have a repeat error while trying to install Ubuntu 7.10 Fiesty Herd 1 Desktop from a live CD.  The error occurs after the "Ubuntu" start up screen (with the orange bar on the bottom) is complete.  The error is as follows: "Busyboy v1.1.3 (Debian 1:1.1.3-3ubuntu2) Built in shell (ash).  bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off" And I am kicked to some terminal as (initramfs).  Should I file this in bug reports?

2007-01-08T06:34:00.000Z	un_operateur	eitan	did you get an error before being sent to the busybox prompt?
2007-01-08T06:35:00.000Z	eitan	un_operateur	before, and it tries to repair something (i don't remember the exact output, I can repeat the error and save it and come back), and then i'm kicked to that shell
