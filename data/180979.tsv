2006-07-07T08:51:00.000Z	pm2		second question:  I need to have at least a 2.6.18 kernel for some driver support.  Is there an easy way to upgrade via a binary package, or will I have to compile on my own.  Is there are "ubuntu-way" for kernel config and compiling?
2006-07-07T08:52:00.000Z	chip42	pm2	you can use the debian way to compile the kernel, since ubuntu is debian based.
2006-07-07T08:54:00.000Z	chip42	pm2	google will have something for sure. its very convenient. in the end you have a binary kernel package you can add / remove through package management
2006-07-07T08:54:00.000Z	pm2	chip42	yeah, I remember doing it a while ago... definately easy, I just don't remember the exact procedure off hand.  I'll google.
