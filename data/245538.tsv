2006-08-04T08:03:00.000Z	root		does ubuntu have different repositories like debian has sarge, sid etc?
2006-08-04T08:04:00.000Z	sproingie	root	those aren't different repos, they're different versions.  ubuntu has a new one roughly every 6 months
2006-08-04T08:07:00.000Z	root	sproingie	and it uses apt tho right?  So as apps and security updates are added I can stay current?
