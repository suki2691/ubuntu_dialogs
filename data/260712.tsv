2004-12-14T09:46:00.000Z	Kitoji		k, obviously it isn't possible :(
2004-12-14T09:46:00.000Z	TheMuso	Kitoji	It probably is possible, but none of us here know how to do it.
2004-12-14T09:47:00.000Z	TheMuso	Kitoji	I suggest you read the XF86Config-4 man page as it might have something in there about it.
