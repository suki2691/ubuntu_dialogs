2012-05-07T01:58:00.000Z	Hieberr		is a good alternative to Thunderbird?
2012-05-07T01:59:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Hieberr	That depends. What don't you like about Thunderbird?
2012-05-07T02:00:00.000Z	Hieberr	dj_segfault	I don't like that I have to keep thunderbird open at all times to get notifications. That and it looks too cluttered to me.
