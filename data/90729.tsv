2010-05-16T06:41:00.000Z	GSF1200S		why is it that I get tearing in all my videos on Ubuntu, but not on arch, compiz or not?
2010-05-16T06:41:00.000Z	GSF1200S		weird..
2010-05-16T06:42:00.000Z	SwedeMike	GSF1200S	vsync setting?
2010-05-16T06:43:00.000Z	GSF1200S	SwedeMike	Yeah, it seems like it has to be, but Ive tried sync to vblank and everything else (indirect rendering, etc) and nothing helps. Arch doesnt tear even WITH compiz enabled, which is weird..
