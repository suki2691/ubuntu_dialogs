2006-09-13T10:26:00.000Z	IcemanV9	ANTDx1	yeah, it may requires flash 8 (which is not available for linux)
2006-09-13T10:27:00.000Z	IcemanV9	ANTDx1	you're not alone with this issue - flash 8 is not available for linux.
2006-09-13T10:28:00.000Z	IcemanV9	ANTDx1	well, my wife wants to see some sites (using flash8), i just installed win32 Firefox with wine. it works.
