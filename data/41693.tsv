2010-06-07T23:24:00.000Z	jozefk	BluesKaj	pulseaudio is distributing stereo sound to 5+1 speakers for me and that's nice feature
2010-06-07T23:29:00.000Z	BluesKaj	jozefk	pulseaudio works best with pci sndcards , altho the newer pcs' with onboard surround seem to benefit more then older pc onboards
2010-06-07T23:30:00.000Z	jozefk	BluesKaj	I have 5.1 PCI soundcard and pulse works fine for me. I tried to have the same effect with ALSA only but without success
2010-06-07T23:30:00.000Z	BluesKaj	jozefk	right , thanks for the info.
