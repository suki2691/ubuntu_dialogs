2007-01-26T08:36:00.000Z	vlt		Hello (again). How to switch from -k7 to amd64 kernel? I can't find images in apt.
2007-01-26T08:36:00.000Z	pike_	vlt	complete reinstall
2007-01-26T08:39:00.000Z	pike_	vlt	there are still issues running 64. no reason not to free up a partition and try it but id hold off on deleting the current install unless youre sure
2007-01-26T08:41:00.000Z	pike_	vlt	you can run k7 kernel just like you can i386 umm.. it depends what you want from system.  some things are going to actually be a little more ineffecient under 64bit but on the whole the speed increase is real.
