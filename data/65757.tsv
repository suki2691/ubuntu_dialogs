2009-11-29T01:40:00.000Z	klenwell		Hello.  My sister has asked me to install ubuntu on her old laptop.  It's a Dell Inspiron 5150, ~512k RAM, probably 5+ years old.  Which version do you recommend?  I have disks for 5.10, 7.10, or could dl the latest. Thx.
2009-11-29T01:42:00.000Z	klenwell		Thx for suggestions.  I suggest 5.10 because I had some issue when I tried to install the latest on an old laptop of mine last year and ended up installing 5.10 and upgrading from that.  (Yes, 512MB!)
2009-11-29T01:44:00.000Z	klenwell		ok, i'm going to dl 8.04 LTS and give it a try.  Will probably return with some questions later.  Thanks!
