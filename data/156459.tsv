2007-07-25T09:21:00.000Z	Douglas52392		im trying to use a ubuntu livecd to get my computer to work, i installed debian linux yesterday, and i dont think the installer wrote the mbr right because i cant boot my computer (it goest right to the intel network boot app). how can i reinstall grub with a ubuntu livecd?
