2007-01-12T07:42:00.000Z	Li`lEndian	DesertEagle	yeah, i still get a warning - saying that it could cause severe damage to run fsck on a mounted fs.
2007-01-12T07:42:00.000Z	Li`lEndian	DesertEagle	don't think it'd be wise to try that. problem is,  cannot umount the /home parition
2007-01-12T07:44:00.000Z	Li`lEndian	DesertEagle	well, yeah, my mistake explaining it- problem simply is, i cant unmount it
