2009-10-30T03:03:00.000Z	Alan		To create a USB startup disk for a distro, do i need an installation of that distro to do it from?
2009-10-30T03:03:00.000Z	Alan		i.e. can i create a Karmic USB installer from within Jaunty?
2009-10-30T03:04:00.000Z	yofel	Alan	sure, just use usb-creator with the karmic iso
2009-10-30T03:04:00.000Z	Alan	yofel	hmm, it breaks all over the damn place in a virtual machine... maybe i'll have to try it on the metal :(
