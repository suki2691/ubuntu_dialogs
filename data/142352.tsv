2011-10-14T21:29:00.000Z	pagan0ne	wildc4rd	its different, if you dont like change dont click yes
2011-10-14T21:30:00.000Z	pagan0ne	wildc4rd	it will reinstall unity and uninstall gnome when you upgrade
2011-10-14T21:30:00.000Z	pagan0ne	wildc4rd	and the new gnome you can reinstall in 11.10 is way different than the old gnome, nautilus is different and things just dont work as expected for me
