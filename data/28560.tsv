2010-09-03T05:11:00.000Z	jjohnson		how much space we talking about im using a 8gb SSD drive
2010-09-03T05:12:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jjohnson	you probably could install ubuntu-desktop (or gnome-desktop-environment)
2010-09-03T05:13:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	jjohnson	a smaller/minimal gnome desktop package is gnome-core
