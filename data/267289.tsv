2011-04-08T21:52:00.000Z	_Twystd350_		Hey guys, anyone have any clue why video chat would not be working in firefox under 10.10 maverick? Cheese will show my cam up fine but things like Omegle, Tinychat, Chatroulette just don't work
2011-04-08T21:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_Twystd350_	 if you mean in 'flash' in firefox. thers known issues with flash accessing webcams. (ive never tried it)
2011-04-08T21:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_Twystd350_	 thers a program called 'webcamstudio' that can help some of those flash-based things (and other apps) make use of your webcvam. Its like a virtual webcam. that sort of works as a front end/tweaking tool.
2011-04-08T21:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_Twystd350_	 yep. Its a java app.  ive not tried it in some time.
