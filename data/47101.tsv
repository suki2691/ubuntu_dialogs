2011-08-10T11:29:00.000Z	subone		Can someone help me with a mounting issue? I'm munting an NTFS external drive with umask=777 and user options, but Nautilus reports that the folder contents could not be displayed because i do not have permission.
2011-08-10T11:29:00.000Z	llutz_	subone	umask=000   if you want permission 777
2011-08-10T11:44:00.000Z	llutz_	subone	no idea, i don't deal with ntfs
2011-08-10T11:52:00.000Z	llutz_	subone	really? i always thought the order of options doesn't matter...
