2007-12-01T20:38:00.000Z	Nilbus		I'm not quite sure how to download the ubuntu livecd.  There's a checkbox that reads, "Check here if you need the alternate desktop CD. This CD does not include the Live CD, instead it uses a text-based installer."  But I don't understand what this means.
2007-12-01T20:38:00.000Z	Nilbus		could anyone clarify?
