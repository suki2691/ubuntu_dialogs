2005-12-29T11:39:00.000Z	cyphos		is there a startup guide yet for 5.10?
2005-12-29T11:40:00.000Z	cyphos		does the 5.04 directly apply to 5.10?
2005-12-29T11:41:00.000Z	bob832	cyphos	 i use the 5.04 guide and everything works fine
2005-12-29T11:41:00.000Z	bob832	cyphos	to answer your other question, i'm not sure about an updated one for 5.10
