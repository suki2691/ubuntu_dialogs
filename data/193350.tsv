2006-10-06T14:59:00.000Z	rlared		does it make sense to run the 686 kernel if i have an athlon xp and the k7 one is buggy?
2006-10-06T15:00:00.000Z	bsdfox	rlared	sure
2006-10-06T15:01:00.000Z	rlared	bsdfox	will there be performance gains from using 686 instead of 386?  is it more likely to be less stable?
2006-10-06T15:02:00.000Z	bsdfox	rlared	minor performance gains, no instability increase
