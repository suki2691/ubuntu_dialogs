2009-05-08T19:12:00.000Z	jlaroche		i have a strange issue. I'm running ubuntu 9.04 64bit. Last night I was playing music and watching movies with no issues.... my system's sound (and the rest of the system in general) has been working great. Strangely, this morning my sound strangely does not work anymore. I have a Sound Blaster Audigy 4
