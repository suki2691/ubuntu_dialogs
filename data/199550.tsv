2006-02-18T13:05:00.000Z	mack_		Can anyone help me out a bit with automatically mounting Windows partitions to be accessable through a non-root user?  My fstab currently reads '/dev/hda5 /mnt/stuff ntfs rw,suid,dev,exec,auto,user,async 00'

2006-02-18T13:07:00.000Z	iBalo	mack_	and scratch the rw
2006-02-18T13:11:00.000Z	mack_	iBalo	Was just going with an altered version of 'defaults' and forgot to take out the 'rw'.  Thanks.
