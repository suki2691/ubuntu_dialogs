2008-09-19T09:37:00.000Z	l337ingDisorder		Quick question guys - how do you use Ubuntu? (har har) actually here's my question: in Nautilus, is there any way to filter the file list? On my Windows box I use a file manager called Directory Opus, which features an address bar like in nautilus, but if the directory I'm in is, say, /home/ and I only want to show JPG files, I'd be able to just append *.jpg to the address bar and hit enter,...
2008-09-19T09:37:00.000Z	l337ingDisorder		...then the right pane of the file manager displays all the JPG files in the given directory (ie, /home/*.jpg)
2008-09-19T09:39:00.000Z	l337ingDisorder		does Nautilus have a similar function?
