2005-11-29T15:52:00.000Z	arnducky		I've got a dual layer burner now, but media is still too expensive for me and I only have doze32 apps for making spansets and compressed image files -- which I'm trying to wean myself off of (though I'm tempted to buyt Partition Magic 8.0 since it has better Ext3 support and even supports 'end-lusers' who want to dual/multi-boot with Linux)
2005-11-29T15:53:00.000Z	RQ	arnducky	what is the question? :D

2005-11-29T15:54:00.000Z	arnducky	RQ	no question.  Does therehave to be one?  I was just quacking at robotgeek.
