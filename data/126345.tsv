2008-01-11T01:34:00.000Z	bottiger		how does rsync work? how does it know if a file has changed?
2008-01-11T01:35:00.000Z	IdleOne	bottiger	last date modified, file size, reads it?
2008-01-11T01:35:00.000Z	bottiger	IdleOne	you tell me
2008-01-11T01:36:00.000Z	IdleOne	bottiger	I would guess wildly that it checks last date and time modified
