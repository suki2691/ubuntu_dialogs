2010-12-15T08:14:00.000Z	arox		hello?
2010-12-15T08:15:00.000Z	arox		Should I wait my turn or just state my problem?
2010-12-15T08:16:00.000Z	arox		I bought a netbook today and immediately installed Xubuntu on it at the advice of a friend through the USB boot method. Now I'm deciding I want to go with Ubuntu Netbook and it's giving me an error message when I try to use my USB drive.
