2012-02-16T03:46:00.000Z	kostasz		I installed xubuntu 11.10 on one drive divided into 3 partitions: one for windows7, one for data and one for linux. However, I couldn't set my data partition to be NTFS so it could be seen by both systems. After installing Xubuntu I changed it using GParted to NTFS and after that it is no a problem while Xubuntu is booting
