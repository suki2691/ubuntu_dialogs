2012-06-20T02:56:00.000Z	ichbinder		hello. Please, please, please help! I have two external hard drives, one dropped the other day and I wanted to be on the safe side and backup everything on it. So I connected it to Ubuntu and used rsync to copy all its content to my other external 3GB hard drive. Took about 12 hours. Rsync finished without errors and all looked fine. Now, a few hours later, I wanted to access the large, second hard drive in my file manager. Ubuntu

The next boot process didn't process so I restarted and disconnected all external hard drives. Ubuntu came up. But now, the large hard drive doesn't work anymore and all I get from dmesg is " [sdf] Spinning up disk..." while I can't hear the hard drive spinning. However, it's not making clicks or noise that sounds like a head is broken... what can I
