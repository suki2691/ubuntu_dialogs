2005-08-05T05:45:00.000Z	anatole_	thoreauputic	thanks but that lists files as well :)
2005-08-05T05:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	anatole_	it should only list entries beginning with d  - did you include the pipe?  | grep ^d
2005-08-05T05:49:00.000Z	anatole_	thoreauputic	it works now... it lists in some strange way tho :)
