2005-11-28T10:42:00.000Z	tritium	Gerrath	don't.  use the ubuntu packages
2005-11-28T10:43:00.000Z	Gerrath	tritium	I don't believe the Ubuntu ones are the latest though.
2005-11-28T10:44:00.000Z	tritium	Gerrath	the ones in breezy should be fairly recent, and they have the advantage of being under package management
