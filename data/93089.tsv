If I have two active windows open, say xchat and firefox.. if Firefox is the active window, if I click anywhere in xchat's window.. it doesn't bring up xchat as the active window, it'll keep firefox up.  If I click on xchat in the SYSTEM TRAY, it comes right up... any ideas??  or if I clikc on the title bar, it'll actually switch.. does anyone have any ideas?  it's kind of annoying

2008-05-27T08:41:00.000Z	tom540	mnk0	I can't even switch desktops atm.. I don't know what's going on to be honest.  I can't even use the cube, even though it's activated in Compiz.
