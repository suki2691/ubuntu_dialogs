2005-06-05T11:53:00.000Z	Stalagna		hey? every time I try and run openoffice, it locks up
2005-06-05T11:53:00.000Z	Stalagna		it opens up with the first screen with the loading bar, and once the bar reaches 100% it stops, and freezes?
2005-06-05T11:54:00.000Z	Stalagna		i don't have any files to open yet
2005-06-05T11:54:00.000Z	Madpilot	Stalagna	OpenOffice will open MS formats (.doc, etc) if you've got one of them around...
