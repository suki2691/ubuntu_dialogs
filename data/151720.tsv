2007-01-04T15:00:00.000Z	Reliant		Quick question. When I do a recovery boot, and go into maintenence after a ctrl+alt+del, how can I remount my drive as writable? It's mounted as read-only by default
2007-01-04T15:00:00.000Z	MitchM	Reliant	try mount +rw
2007-01-04T15:01:00.000Z	Reliant	MitchM	Do I pass any other parameters?
2007-01-04T15:01:00.000Z	MitchM	Reliant	Sure.
