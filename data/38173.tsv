2010-04-05T22:37:00.000Z	andruk		which ralink driver should i use?  the rt2800usb or the rt2870sta?
2010-04-05T22:38:00.000Z	winr4r	andruk	depends on what card you have
2010-04-05T22:40:00.000Z	andruk	winr4r	a ralink 2870n usb wireless dongle
2010-04-05T22:41:00.000Z	winr4r	andruk	i'd hazard a guess and stay rt2800usb
