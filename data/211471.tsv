2006-08-31T13:35:00.000Z	azathoth	Redrose	sudo apt-get install gnome-desktop
2006-08-31T13:36:00.000Z	Redrose	azathoth	Just cause I'm wanting to use KDE only, and I don't have a lot of space for GNOME
2006-08-31T13:37:00.000Z	azathoth	Redrose	i hate to say it, but your best bet might be a re-install with kubuntu... as a default ubuntu install has an awful lot of gnome stuff layered in
