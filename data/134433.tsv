2008-06-07T00:17:00.000Z	BZWingZero	StevenX	When does it not load? When you try mounting it under Ubuntu, or in a dual boot configuration?
2008-06-07T00:19:00.000Z	StevenX	BZWingZero	I mean when I go into ubuntu, I don't have access to my NTFS partition anymore. I can boot into it, but I don't see it under ubuntu. I went into terminal and was able to load it manually using the ntfs-3g and the -o force. Hopefully I won't have to do this everytime I boot.
