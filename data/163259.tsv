2007-07-21T14:55:00.000Z	mustang97		Having a problem installing jdk-1_5_0_12-linux-i586.rpm.bin   Anyone know if theres a bug or extra stuff I need to install to get this installed?
2007-07-21T14:55:00.000Z	mustang97		Which would be?  I've been trying to find any commands to get it running.
2007-07-21T14:57:00.000Z	mustang97		I figured out the rpm .. got that installed
