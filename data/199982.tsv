2006-12-01T08:14:00.000Z	errorlevel		I'm thinking about using this method ( https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromKnoppix ) to install Ubuntu on another partition while I'm using Gentoo.  Is there any meta-package that I can install after the base-system to get the same packages I would if I had installed from a CD?
