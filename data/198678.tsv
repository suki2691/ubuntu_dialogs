2006-03-02T09:10:00.000Z	Draconicus		I need to configure keybindings for VBA, and for this I need to have the four-digit hex values for certain keyboard keys. These include right shift (or just shift) and such. Where can I find these values?
2006-03-02T09:11:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Draconicus	possibly with xev
2006-03-02T09:14:00.000Z	Draconicus	hatake_kakashi	No... this is the wrong kind of hex value...
2006-03-02T09:14:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Draconicus	hmm, well I'm not too sure then, you may want to check #linux
