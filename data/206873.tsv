2006-10-30T14:53:00.000Z	MuPp3t		My new laptop should be arriving tomorrow, I want to dual boot XP and Ubuntu on it, thing is I've never partitioned a hard drive before, could anyone tell me if it is best to format and then create the partitions or just create another without formatting (XP will come preinstalled)?

2006-10-30T14:54:00.000Z	ClayG	MuPp3t	be carefuly, i flattened and when i went ot rebuilt i used xp pro instead , it has been a btch to get the drivers
