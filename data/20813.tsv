2012-01-20T00:00:00.000Z	BarkingFish	level09	which kill signal are you using?
2012-01-20T00:01:00.000Z	BarkingFish	level09	you could try using a kill that will force it to quit, try sudo kill -11 followed by the process ID's you want to nail
2012-01-20T00:02:00.000Z	level09	BarkingFish	is that the effect of "respawn" ? seems like upstart is trying to keep it alive
