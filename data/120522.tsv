Why is it that so many people on the forum have such a fundamental problem but there are barely any posts suggesting fixes? I just want to be able to turn my computer off without 'sudo halt' or just cutting the power.

2007-10-24T19:15:00.000Z	Mountaingod	Alp`	Clean install. I used feisty before that without issue
