2008-10-18T07:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	klaxian	 pretty miuch it should.. but i ofte have ti install the nvidia or ati drivers for it to get the proper res..
2008-10-18T07:00:00.000Z	klaxian	dr_willis	it's an intel card
2008-10-18T07:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	klaxian	 ive also noticed it gettting it wrong with VGA monitors at times.. DVI is much smarter about it.
