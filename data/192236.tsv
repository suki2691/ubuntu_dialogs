2006-04-10T05:41:00.000Z	gabbah_		i'm on dapper.. i have ticked all the boxes in repositories list in synaptic. That should gimme access to everything, but it still doesn't find "flashplayer-mozilla" or "java-package"..?
2006-04-10T05:42:00.000Z	mwe	gabbah_	I think it's flashplugin-nonfree
2006-04-10T05:43:00.000Z	mwe	gabbah_	java-package shows up here. did you update afterwards?
2006-04-10T05:44:00.000Z	gabbah_	mwe	i used synaptic.. and pressed reload yes
