2010-08-12T06:18:00.000Z	bofh80	Zvezda	click on Places > Network. you should be able to find them in the windows network
2010-08-12T06:21:00.000Z	bofh80	Zvezda	System > Administration > Package Manager - search for smbclient   see if it's installed
2010-08-12T06:24:00.000Z	bofh80	Zvezda	the other way is type into the address bar in nautilus smb:///servername/share   i think that's the right syntax
