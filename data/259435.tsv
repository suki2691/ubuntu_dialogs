2007-08-10T11:06:00.000Z	CheeseGardener		I typed in sudo time fsck -p -f /dev/sdb1, but for some reason the terminal seems to be doing things, but isn't displaying any text or a time left.  Why is this???
2007-08-10T11:07:00.000Z	CheeseGardener		Does anyone know what is happening?  is it checking my drive?
2007-08-10T11:07:00.000Z	CheeseGardener		Or why perhaps it isn't displaying a time?
2007-08-10T11:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CheeseGardener	as far as I know "time" only displays a time when the command finishes
