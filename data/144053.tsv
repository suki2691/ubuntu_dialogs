2007-03-07T13:40:00.000Z	Daemonik	mbac	Does decoding require a license too?
2007-03-07T13:41:00.000Z	mbac	Daemonik	it can at any moment in the future if they say so. i think right now they don't require it.

We don't really have to worry about getting into any trouble selling the machines with the Gstreamer ugly packages installed by default do we? We want MP3 playing and things like that to work out of the box.
