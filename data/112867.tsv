Apparently only a select few people have managed to not only get it to boot but also install it. BUT they had to sacrifice a lot of things to manage this. My confusion is, after such a big sale of them at CircuitCity, why hasn't such a compatibility error been patched/fixed in an update of Gutsy?

2007-12-26T23:37:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	tanlaan	and that is probably an upstream kernel problem anyway
