2011-12-27T01:31:00.000Z	magnus__		hey people! just started out with Linux(ubuntu). Is it  possible to use pwd for path completion when writing  commands. For example: svn co file://{PWD}/myproject?

2011-12-27T01:35:00.000Z	magnus__	iceroot	thanks. Is there a way to convert it to the absolute path? file///./myproject does not do the trick
