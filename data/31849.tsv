2010-05-16T17:04:00.000Z	MACscr_lappy		is it important that i install these ati/amd fglrx drivesr that ubuntu is recommending versus getting ones directly from ati?
2010-05-16T17:05:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	MACscr_lappy	the ones that Ubuntu is recommending probably ARE the ones by ATI. Are they marked as "proprietary", "non-free", etc.?
2010-05-16T17:06:00.000Z	MACscr_lappy	TheMusicGuy	proprietary
2010-05-16T17:06:00.000Z	TheMusicGuy	MACscr_lappy	 yeah, I'm betting its the official ATI driver.
