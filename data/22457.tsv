2010-11-21T07:35:00.000Z	Benkinooby	alg3r	WilliamHerry yes. okular is too big. but to me it is the best pdf viewer when i comes to functionality
2010-11-21T07:36:00.000Z	alg3r		so, it means okular still being supported? I can get it from sources?
2010-11-21T07:36:00.000Z	Benkinooby	alg3r	for sure. it's in the repository
