2009-08-11T19:24:00.000Z	homy		Hi! Which easy to set-up remote backup solution would you recommend? I mean, something like rsnapshot or rdiff-backup that backups to a local server.
2009-08-11T19:25:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	homy	i use sbackup.. works great for my purposes. supports remote servers
2009-08-11T19:27:00.000Z	homy	b3rz3rk3r	it seems sbackup is not mantained anymore?
2009-08-11T19:28:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	homy	i dont know if thats the case or not, didnt really look into it too much, i was told it was good and simple.. and for me that just the case. It even backups to my FreeBSD server. If you want it simple and automated, thats what id suggest
