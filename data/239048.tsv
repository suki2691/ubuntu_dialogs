2007-04-17T16:54:00.000Z	Stig		hi, for some reason when I try to move or delete files in my /home folder, it says "Cannot move "/home/My D..._Large.jpg" to the Deleted Items folder because you do not have permissions to change it or its parent folder." I have tried logging into root and it doesn't make any difference... not quite sure what I have done.. help!
