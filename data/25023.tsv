2010-11-07T21:51:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	^Mike	minimum requirements pages, but you can force linux to run on almost anything that can handle i386,x64,ppc/ibm
2010-11-07T21:51:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	^Mike	what processor? what ram? what hdd?
2010-11-07T21:52:00.000Z	^Mike	aeon-ltd	yes, but I'm more concerned about touchpad support, wireless, power management etc, which are typically problematic in laptops. I know it will /run/, but I want to check that it'll run /well/
