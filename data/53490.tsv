2009-07-07T07:15:00.000Z	alan_		Can't connect to 64bit WEP network. Am able to connect when I turn off encryption. using a WG311v3 via ndiswrapper, but I believe the problem is that Network Connections GUI menu doesn't offer a 64bit WEP option. Is there a work around or an alternative that I can use?
