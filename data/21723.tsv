2011-01-23T22:04:00.000Z	Virtus		How do I change my startup-sound? The beating of the drums. I'd like it to play a song from my library. A lil' something to complete the epic entry i've made for my Ubuntu computer.
2011-01-23T22:04:00.000Z	Virtus		I checked Preferences > sound -- But, couldn't find an option.
2011-01-23T22:06:00.000Z	Virtus		No one has any ideas?
