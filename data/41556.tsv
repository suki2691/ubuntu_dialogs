2012-01-20T01:17:00.000Z	hh		does anyone know if there is a way to initiate a full web install from a current disk? the disk is corrupt, but still boots... Thanks in advance!
2012-01-20T01:19:00.000Z	ssta	hh	umm, you could, but you'd have to bypass the standard installer, go advanced, and spend much of the time in the console between steps.  Be MUCH easier to just use a CD
