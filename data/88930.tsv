2008-05-31T23:06:00.000Z	JonDeere		I need help editing my xorg.conf file to add the option, Option "UseEDID" "FALSE", so that I can set to video modes above 640X480 in my Nvidia driver?
2008-05-31T23:07:00.000Z	selven_	JonDeere	doesn't the nvidia.run driver do that automatically for you?
2008-05-31T23:11:00.000Z	selven_	JonDeere	then edit it and see if it works
2008-05-31T23:20:00.000Z	selven_	JonDeere	have you checked what driver you are using in the xorg.conf?? is it the restricted one or the normal one?
