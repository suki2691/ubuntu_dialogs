2007-12-02T10:18:00.000Z	NKD-		Got my interface fixed.. now.. one more question. On bootup I am getting FATAL Errors that it could not find the modules.dep file in my kernel lib directory
2007-12-02T10:19:00.000Z	NKD-		screen gets briefly spammed with em, then it boots fine
2007-12-02T10:19:00.000Z	NKD-		not sure if its causing any problems, but i dont like to see FATAL on bootup
2007-12-02T10:20:00.000Z	n2diy	NKD-	If you had fatal errors with your kernel, you wouldn't be booting, what else does it tell you?
