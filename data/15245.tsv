2012-05-01T23:12:00.000Z	kathy		I have a small acer laptop with 10.4.4 LTS installed and am wondering why the update manager is not offering 12.04   Shouldn't it?
2012-05-01T23:14:00.000Z	escott	kathy	given the substantial nature of the changes i would recommend trying a livecd first and then if you do decide to upgrade you might elect to reinstall

2012-05-01T23:19:00.000Z	kathy	escott	I suppose that is possible.
