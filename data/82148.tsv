2008-08-26T08:12:00.000Z	Tarranon		I'm trying to get Mplayer to work.  It says,"Error Opening/Initializing the selected video_out (-vo) device.  So I go to the FAQ and it tells me how to bring up a list of VO devices I have.  Then it tells me to pick the 'correct' one.  It doesn't tell me how to determine what the correct one is.  Help?
