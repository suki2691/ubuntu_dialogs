2008-06-11T20:36:00.000Z	Casper1001		really struggling on removing ubuntu from my laptop...any1 got ideas?
2008-06-11T20:36:00.000Z	KOJV	Casper1001	install another system, such as Windows.
2008-06-11T20:37:00.000Z	Casper1001	KOJV	tried that...but my acer laptop is stupid and comes with these recovery cds..so its not a proper install
2008-06-11T20:37:00.000Z	KOJV	Casper1001	then do a recovery.
