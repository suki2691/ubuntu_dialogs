2009-02-15T05:28:00.000Z	rip_		i'm having some issues with installing 8.10, i think i have a bad image file.  I do have a working copy of 8.04.  if i install 8.04 is it able to upgrade itself to 8.10 from within ubuntu?

2009-02-15T05:30:00.000Z	NFischer	rip_	 but be careful.. i cant install ibex to. i tried both updating and fresh install both led to kernel panic
2009-02-15T05:31:00.000Z	rip_	NFischer	yea, all the files are backed up, i have a feeling this is going to be an ugly install.  its on a laptop that seems to have hard drive issues (unsupported hdd controller?) doing some really bizzare things. gonna give 8.04 a shot
