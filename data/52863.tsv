2009-07-12T11:41:00.000Z	josh_93		Hi. I have a horribly noob question to ask. How do i use terminal to send a file via ftp? I want to transfer it to my /public_html/ DIR, but it keeps transferring it to the "/" home directory.
2009-07-12T11:41:00.000Z	losher	josh_93	there is a cd command in ftp to change the remote directory...
2009-07-12T11:42:00.000Z	josh_93	losher	like i said.. horrible noob question, its 3AM here and im sleepy.. i have no idea why i did not think to use the CD command.. i kept trying to use the DIR one.. thanks though lol >_<
2009-07-12T11:43:00.000Z	losher	josh_93	no problem...
