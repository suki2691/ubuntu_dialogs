2011-04-02T21:17:00.000Z	ginosal		hi everybody. please, I would like to know why my kernel is always 2.6.32-27-generic and the update manager doesn't propose me newer ones!
2011-04-02T21:18:00.000Z	szymon_g	ginosal	maybe there is no newer versions in repo?
2011-04-02T21:19:00.000Z	szymon_g		!sru
2011-04-02T21:20:00.000Z	ginosal	szymon_g	no, there are newer versions...
