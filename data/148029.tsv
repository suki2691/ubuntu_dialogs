2007-03-06T17:24:00.000Z	Landon		Hey all, I have a quick question. How do I connect to a windows server using Samba?
2007-03-06T17:24:00.000Z	kelsin	Landon	the quick and easy way is to select "Network" from the Places menu in gnome (if you are running normal ubuntu), you should be able to browse the windows network like you could in windows
2007-03-06T17:26:00.000Z	Landon	kelsin	It doesn't work because for some reason, it's not specified, it won't let me access the windows network
2007-03-06T17:26:00.000Z	kelsin	Landon	if you install the right packages you can also use the smbmount commant to mount windows shares, I don't know the packages or the syntax atm :-(
