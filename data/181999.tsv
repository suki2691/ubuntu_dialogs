2006-06-04T05:08:00.000Z	Fujitsu	jeska	are they on an NTFS partition?
2006-06-04T05:09:00.000Z	jeska	Fujitsu	I recently took this hard drive out of another machine (Windows) and placed it in this one, and I used the disk manager to enable the ahrd drive, which has two storage partitions
2006-06-04T05:09:00.000Z	Fujitsu	jeska	sounds like NTFS.
