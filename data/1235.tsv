2012-11-25T06:14:00.000Z	jrib	mjuszczak	12.10 is the latest stable release
2012-11-25T06:15:00.000Z	mjuszczak	jrib	I remember there were some major issues with some people installing it and they were sticking  with 12.04.  Have those been resolved?  I assume I'm being a bit vague here :) So I'll try it out
