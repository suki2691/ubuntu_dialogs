2007-10-15T15:53:00.000Z	notgod		hello. I am trying to install ubuntu server onto a maching with a nvidia quadro video card. install went fine, but when the machine boots, it's got a garbled screen. This is the server edition, so it should be in text mode.

2007-10-15T15:54:00.000Z	dwxreaper		i mean reset
