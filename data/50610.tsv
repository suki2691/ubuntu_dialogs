2009-10-10T15:50:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	vavar	thought Konq was core to KDE
2009-10-10T15:50:00.000Z	vavar	NineTeen67Comet	i hope so. the latest screenshots dont show it usually. they just show off the great similarity to vista.. *sigh*
2009-10-10T15:52:00.000Z	vavar	NineTeen67Comet	well, its still there. i just had to say that i wouldnt like it being exchanged by dolphin or whatever.
