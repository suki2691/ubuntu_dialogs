2008-08-21T23:58:00.000Z	xintron		I'm running fluxbox as wm and it's great, except one thing :/ My iPod won't load in rhythmbox. When I switch to my gnome-session it works fine but not using fluxbox (it connects without problem, but not listed in rhythmbox). How do I solve this? Or is there another good music manager that I can use with iPod support (playing from the iPod) and last.fm scrobble?

2008-08-21T23:59:00.000Z	xintron	lazyPower	is it lightweight? I used moc and it works, but after playing a few songs moc hangs and looses contact with the iPod and I have to kill moc (works when playing files on the computer)
