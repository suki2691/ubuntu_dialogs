2005-10-15T11:13:00.000Z	Jerich		I just have a small question, I did a custom Ubuntu install, but i don't know what i need to install to have xorg working with XFCE4
2005-10-15T11:13:00.000Z	gilligan_	Jerich	apt-get install xfce
2005-10-15T11:14:00.000Z	gilligan_	Jerich	or actually "apt-get install xfce4"
2005-10-15T11:14:00.000Z	gilligan_	Jerich	heh? just boot up and choose 'xfce4' in session type menu
