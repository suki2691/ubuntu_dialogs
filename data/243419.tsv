2005-04-13T05:15:00.000Z	blueyed		I've got it installed now (grub put hd2 into its config, but it was in fact hd2!). But the install is kind of broken.. how can I burn the hoary-install-amd64.iso? Firefox does not start anymore, so I cannot google.. :/
2005-04-13T05:15:00.000Z	blueyed		..was hd3..
2005-04-13T05:17:00.000Z	n4cht	blueyed	why not just use lynx, or some other CLI browser?   google works fine through those.
2005-04-13T05:17:00.000Z	blueyed	n4cht	but lynx isn't installed (synaptic also does not start)..
