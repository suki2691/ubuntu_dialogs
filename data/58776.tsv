2009-04-30T03:09:00.000Z	Adyeths		so I've been having this problem with ubuntu locking up on me without giving me any error messages. first started with 8.10 but seems to have continued with 9.04. Is there anywhere here who knows anything about fixing these sorts of issues?
2009-04-30T03:10:00.000Z	Adyeths		nope. nothing from dmesg.
2009-04-30T03:10:00.000Z	david0	Adyeths	you can reinstall it
