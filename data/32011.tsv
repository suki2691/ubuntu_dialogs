2010-05-22T20:10:00.000Z	Evolution		has anyone running 10.04 seen terminal sessions randomly die? I leave an ssh session open to other systems, and with ubuntu it will randomly die, where other systems do not
2010-05-22T20:11:00.000Z	Evolution		I don't see anything that would lead me to identify something specific in my logs
2010-05-22T20:12:00.000Z	vlt	Evolution	Does the whole terminal process die or just the ssh session?
2010-05-22T20:12:00.000Z	Evolution	vlt	the whole terminal process.
