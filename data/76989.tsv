2009-03-08T07:57:00.000Z	shawn-p		hello.  I am doing "sudo apt-get install build-essential",  Ubuntu is prompting me to insert the Ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon CD. I don't have the CD handy.  Can it somehow just download what it needs?

2009-03-08T07:59:00.000Z	bruce89		that's a more interesting way to do it
