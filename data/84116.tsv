2008-11-07T23:52:00.000Z	Voltaplein		Quick question,: running 8.10 on a desktop with no wireless, yet wpa-supplicant is running.  What is the best way to tell ubuntu that I don't want wireless networking enabled?
2008-11-07T23:53:00.000Z	joaopinto	Voltaplein	try: dpkg -S wpa-supplicant
2008-11-07T23:53:00.000Z	joaopinto		and remove the package containing it
