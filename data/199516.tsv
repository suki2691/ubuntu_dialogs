2007-02-06T11:42:00.000Z	eidolon		it specifically says "sudo nvidia-glx-config enable" - which I do, and I get "Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver!  be sure to have installed the nvidia driver for your running kernel."
2007-02-06T11:42:00.000Z	eidolon		nowhere in the installer does it say waht that is.
2007-02-06T11:42:00.000Z	dyrne	eidolon	sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx  does that show the package already installed?
