2008-03-12T21:21:00.000Z	ghfreak51		i'm trying to install ubuntu on this crappy hp, no more than 512MB RAM and 1GHz processor, and this message keeps popping up: Buffer I/O error on device Fd0, logical block 0 - is it not finding my hard drive?

2008-03-12T21:21:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	ghfreak51	I had to disable my floppy in BIOS to get ubuntu to install, then enable it to get ubuntu to boot
2008-03-12T21:22:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	ghfreak51	yea, it's pretty odd.
