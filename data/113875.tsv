2010-05-10T15:40:00.000Z	dupondje		I got an extremely annoying sound comming from my speakers. When I kill pulseaudio, it stops, when I start it again, it continues :(
2010-05-10T15:41:00.000Z	dupondje		any idea what could be causing it ?
2010-05-10T15:42:00.000Z	waan	dupondje	I think I had some problems with pulseaudio and had to use alsa instead. Can't remember how I fixed it
2010-05-10T15:42:00.000Z	waan	dupondje	I think I had problems with sound lag
