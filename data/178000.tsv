2007-12-31T22:36:00.000Z	blueskiesokie		yea .. i run a script fromcron every ten minutes. somtimes it gets stuck and doesn't die like its suppossed to . it access the serial port, so every time after that the new instances will go zombie too
2007-12-31T22:37:00.000Z	blueskiesokie		and i looses all the data i am collecting, cause my process won't run correctly
