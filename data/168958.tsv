2007-01-24T09:44:00.000Z	apollo2011		I used to use the normal nvidia driver but it quit working and I tried installing it from the .bin and it insisted that my graphics card was only supported by the legacy driver so I installed that one and now I have it enabled and X11 works, but when I run Unreal Tournament 2004, it claims that GLX support is missing.

2007-01-24T09:51:00.000Z	apollo2011	bitmvnch	I rebooted about a week ago and then X wouldn't load, I believe the last update before the reboot included a kernel upgrade, however I was using the Ubuntu package for nvidia. I still don't understand how my graphics card could simply become unsupported by the nvidia driver. Their website still shows that my card is supported by the normal driver.
