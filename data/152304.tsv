2007-02-16T06:52:00.000Z	Spo8		Okay so I got beryl installed this time, but now whenever I actually launch it with beryl-manager, it goes to a black screen, then the flashing cursor at the top, then it restarts my session and puts me at the logon screen.
2007-02-16T06:54:00.000Z	Spo8		can anyone tell me how to update to the latest nvidia driver, please?

2007-02-16T06:56:00.000Z	kenthomson	Spo8	if you want to install the very latest nvidia drivers there's a more comlicated method let me see, i too would like to do it
