2008-04-06T03:38:00.000Z	Devrethman		is there a gnome xterm that supports tabs?
2008-04-06T03:38:00.000Z	Devrethman		it doesn't have tabs AFAIK
2008-04-06T03:38:00.000Z	Devrethman		if it does, I'd like to know how to use them
2008-04-06T03:39:00.000Z	i_r_leenucks_man	Devrethman	use the file -> new tab
