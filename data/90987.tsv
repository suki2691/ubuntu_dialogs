2008-05-11T15:48:00.000Z	J0K0		Hi... I want to upgrade my Feisty installation to Gutsy and then to Hardy. I am behind a proxy. If I try to start the upgrade progress, I get the following message:
2008-05-11T15:48:00.000Z	J0K0		Authenticating the upgrade failed. There may be a problem with the network or with the server. Can anyone help me?

2008-05-11T15:50:00.000Z	J0K0	rutgermasi	already tried. I have run gpg, try to modify my apt.conf, still nothing. That is why I ask here... :D
