2009-02-28T07:39:00.000Z	xun911		hello, very often that i couldn't select which window to type using mouse(keyboad focus got stuck on the previous window), does anyone else experience this problem?
2009-02-28T07:40:00.000Z	Scunizi	xun911	nope.. but maybe compiz is interfearing  turn it off and test
2009-02-28T07:41:00.000Z	xun911	Scunizi	the only way i could fix it is to restart xorg, but let me try reload compiz now
2009-02-28T07:42:00.000Z	xun911	Scunizi	that does not seem to fix the problem. i think it's xorg, but I hate to having to restart all my apps because of this. it happens so often
