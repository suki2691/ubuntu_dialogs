2008-01-07T00:51:00.000Z	Doonz		hey people i need some guidance
2008-01-07T00:52:00.000Z	Doonz		right now i have a file set up with 7 hdds on a win2k3 box that are using dynamic disk. so they appear as one large hadd. I also have a das box that uses the SIL 3124 chipset with port multiplier
2008-01-07T00:53:00.000Z	Doonz		if i break up my 7hdds into just basica disk formated as ntfx will i be able to read the under ubuntu and is it possible to use port multiplier under unbuntu?
2008-01-07T00:53:00.000Z	haymaker	Doonz	yes you can use the ntfs-3g driver to read ntfs disk, dunno bout port multiplier
