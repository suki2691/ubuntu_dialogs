2009-02-10T01:31:00.000Z	Oni		With Windows 7, niggers will no longer be able to steal your personal information. As part of this new technology Windows 7 now includes a reading test in order to be able to use the computer. Niggers can't read, of course, and they will fail the test and not be able to login keeping your data secure.
