2010-06-25T20:06:00.000Z	duffydack		I think I have found a bug in Lucid (netbook if it matters) and SSH.  I know what I`m doing and used it plenty in the past but it keeps asking for my password when loggin, altho the server has my key and pubkeyauth is enabled.. I removed everything ssh and re-did it all and it was ok but for no reason its started again..

2010-06-25T20:08:00.000Z	duffydack	pozic	Ive been using it since feisty, with pubkeyauth, been fine..   nothing is changing on this server, its mine.. it worked without asking, now its asking, again.
