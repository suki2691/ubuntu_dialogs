2006-02-28T07:41:00.000Z	dooglus		I'm trying to download dapper flight 4 using azureus.  I'm getting about 4 bytes per second.  What could be wrong?
2006-02-28T07:42:00.000Z	Xappe	dooglus	dooglus do you have a firewall? if so, you have to open ports 6881-6889
2006-02-28T07:43:00.000Z	dooglus	Xappe	I'm forwarding port 2709, which is the port that azureus is using.  It's also open on the firewall.
2006-02-28T07:43:00.000Z	Xappe	dooglus	i just downloaded flight4 with the bittorent client that comes with breezy at 1030 kB/s
