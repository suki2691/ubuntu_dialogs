2011-06-23T23:44:00.000Z	zleslie		I am having trouble getting my natty vm to boot after a fresh install.  I am using the same pxe procedure that I used on maverick, but for some reason I never see a grub prompt or anything, just a blinking cursor and a failure to boot
2011-06-23T23:45:00.000Z	zleslie		Anyone know what might be going wrong
