2011-01-12T02:35:00.000Z	Chilaquiles		what's the directory?
2011-01-12T02:36:00.000Z	thiefy_	Chilaquiles	i think it defaults to /home/yourusername/Downloads
2011-01-12T02:38:00.000Z	thiefy_	Chilaquiles	there are some books on linux (ubuntu) that would explain those very well. the only one i can remember is called ubuntu unleashed. but i bet there are newer ones that woudl be more up to date.
