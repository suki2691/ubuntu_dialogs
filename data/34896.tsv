2010-05-08T10:56:00.000Z	aioobe		I have a (CD-less) laptop and a 512 MB usb-stick... how do I go about to install? (The usb-creator program does not seem to accept the mini.iso.)

2010-05-08T10:59:00.000Z	aioobe	red2kic	but that's on 700 meg!
2010-05-08T11:01:00.000Z	red2kic	aioobe	700 MB, yes. Why can't you download it? mini.iso retrieve packages from network (which can be just about same as 700 MB).
