2008-07-29T20:27:00.000Z	kippy		Guys is there a resource I can use to learn Linux/Ubuntu troubleshooting? I want to know about some of the important configuration files and what they do and stuff
2008-07-29T20:28:00.000Z	morbyte	kippy	what about google? just ask for the filename
2008-07-29T20:29:00.000Z	kippy	morbyte	yeah that is good option, but its not that something is wrong with the system. It just interests me to play around, just need a bit starting up guidance
