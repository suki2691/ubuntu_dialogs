2008-05-03T20:24:00.000Z	chazco		Hi... i'm having trouble with Ubuntu for student use... its not possible to edit documents as you can on Windows systems (OpenOffice, Softmaker Office both display documents wrong). I have the ms fonts installed. I recently purchased Office 07 ultimate and have it installed in virtualbox, but it takes ages to load and uses battery (starts XP as well). Is there a better way to do this?

2008-05-03T20:26:00.000Z	chazco	SilverStreak	- They look different
2008-05-03T20:27:00.000Z	SilverStreak	chazco	is converting to .rtf an option at all?
