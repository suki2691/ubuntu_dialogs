2008-09-02T07:50:00.000Z	John0Neil		Hello. I am trying to get my microphone working under ubuntu 8.04. I can't record anything in Audacity. I have enable everything in Alsamixer/Capture. Is it possible to get it to work?

2008-09-02T07:51:00.000Z	John0Neil	dmwit	I have enabled mic boost in audio pref too. I hit him pretty hard, I don't think it is only quiet. Have you ever suceed to record with a mic in ubuntu?
