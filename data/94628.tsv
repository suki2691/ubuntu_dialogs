2009-11-13T23:09:00.000Z	{g}		Hey People! Even though I have set a root password in ubuntu and i have "PermitRootLogin" set to yes in my vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config I cannot "ssh root@mymachine". ssh asks me for the password and doesnt log in. It works for user@mymachine. Any ideas?
2009-11-13T23:10:00.000Z	velko	{g}	are you able to log in as root on the console?
2009-11-13T23:10:00.000Z	{g}	velko	yes
2009-11-13T23:11:00.000Z	velko	{g}	have you checked the messages in /var/log/messages and /var/log/syslog for errors from sshd
