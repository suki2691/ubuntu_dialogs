2011-09-26T00:52:00.000Z	a4		id be happy with gnome shell if it would just give me a bottom panel to minimize programs to and to add panel apps to
2011-09-26T00:52:00.000Z	a4		its stupid to either have to alt tab or open a menu to bring programs back up.. right now i have to keep every thing unmaximized so i can click back and forth
2011-09-26T00:53:00.000Z	alkafoo	a4	can't you just add another panel?
2011-09-26T00:54:00.000Z	alkafoo	a4	there must be a way
