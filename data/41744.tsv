2009-11-28T00:43:00.000Z	pbunbun		Hey, I'm using Kubuntu and basically networking isn't started until I log into KDE and KNetworkManager connects, so if I go into a different XSession or virtual terminal it won't connect to the network
2009-11-28T00:43:00.000Z	pbunbun		Is there any program I can get, or settings I can set to have network-manager auto-connect at boot?

2009-11-28T00:45:00.000Z	pbunbun	ActionParsnip	Thanks, might do that, if it's not too hard to get WPA working
