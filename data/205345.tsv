2006-01-21T14:29:00.000Z	Abecedarian	johndarkhorse	 Okay, hadn't realized...  The Guide seemed official enough.
2006-01-21T14:32:00.000Z	johndarkhorse	Abecedarian	the script that ubotu mentions or that robotgeek sent has a script to mount all those things
2006-01-21T14:34:00.000Z	Abecedarian	johndarkhorse	 Okay, was just trying to help.  I'm very new to this as well, and figured that the least I could do was point out to others paths that have worked for me in the past.  I probably should figure out the full list of ubotu commands first though, I guess.
