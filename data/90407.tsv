2008-11-02T01:55:00.000Z	unr3a1		could I be having problems with x-server because I did an upgrade instead of a clean install?
2008-11-02T01:56:00.000Z	unr3a1		looks like I am gonna try a clean install....
2008-11-02T01:56:00.000Z	unr3a1		is there a command I can do to make a list of all the installed applications I have added?
2008-11-02T01:57:00.000Z	favro	unr3a1	dpkg-l should do that
