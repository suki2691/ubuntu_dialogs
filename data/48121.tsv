2009-09-27T14:52:00.000Z	Dhuski		What's more effective aptitude or apt-get??
2009-09-27T14:53:00.000Z	Nitrodist	Dhuski	aren't they the same thing?
2009-09-27T14:53:00.000Z	Dhuski	Nitrodist	they seem to have a different output while both do the same job...
2009-09-27T14:54:00.000Z	Nitrodist	Dhuski	I know that sometimes they will conflict with each other.  apt-get wouldn't let me reinstall kdm or any packages associated with kdm until I used aptitude.
