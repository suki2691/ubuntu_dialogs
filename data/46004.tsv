2009-10-09T10:48:00.000Z	Bonesy		Is there some arcane magic I have to work to get flash 10 running, or is it just apt-get install flashplayer?
2009-10-09T10:48:00.000Z	lstarnes	Bonesy	which version of ubuntu are you using?
2009-10-09T10:48:00.000Z	Bonesy	lstarnes	9.04
2009-10-09T10:48:00.000Z	lstarnes	Bonesy	I think flashplugin-nonfree in 9.04 is flash 10
