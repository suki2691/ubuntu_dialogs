2008-03-25T04:35:00.000Z	kestir		Hi, my system clock keeps slowing down.  Doesn't matter if I set it to manual or to sync with net servers.  Could it just be my CMOS battery?
2008-03-25T04:36:00.000Z	rbil	kestir	yes it could be
2008-03-25T04:37:00.000Z	kestir	rbil	is there anything else I could check before cracking open the case?
2008-03-25T04:37:00.000Z	rbil	kestir	nothing I can think of. maybe someone else has other suggestions
