2008-08-05T16:14:00.000Z	Slart	pepe_swash	there are many.. I don't know if there is one that compares to irfanview though
2008-08-05T16:15:00.000Z	Slart	pepe_swash	you'll have to check in synaptic.. here's a few to get you started, f-spot, eye of gnome, imageview
2008-08-05T16:16:00.000Z	Slart	pepe_swash	and of course.. pornview (which isn't as dirty as one would expect from the name)
