2008-12-29T17:56:00.000Z	bobbob1016	biberao	Yes, but not enough to really help with anything.  And it's not a really good idea just to message a random person you see helping someone, better just to ask your question, and ask the channel, not one person.
2008-12-29T18:01:00.000Z	biberao	bobbob1016	why didnt you just say you didnt want to help? :)
2008-12-29T18:02:00.000Z	bobbob1016	biberao	Because I was helping, letting you know that isn't a good idea for the future.  I didn't mean it badly.
