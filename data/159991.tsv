2006-11-08T09:47:00.000Z	kalikiana	cellofellow	as long as you have the codec, it should work
2006-11-08T09:48:00.000Z	cellofellow	kalikiana	it plays, and pause works, but FF and RW not working.
2006-11-08T09:49:00.000Z	kalikiana	cellofellow	may it be the sound server? i believe firefox uses oss by default
