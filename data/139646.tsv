2007-04-30T09:29:00.000Z	Alumin	aoirthoir	probably means it says it to the channels you're in
2007-04-30T09:29:00.000Z	Alumin	aoirthoir	in general you want to avoid doing that
2007-04-30T09:31:00.000Z	aoirthoir	Alumin	I wouldnt know how to do that then all i do is type /away sleeping or whatever and my nick turns grey..heck if I know how to make it public.
