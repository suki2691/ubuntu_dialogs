2010-02-10T17:15:00.000Z	n00p		guys, my system hibernated while I was watching a flash video and now I've lost my sound... I could reboot and it'd probably come back, but does anyone know a more convenient way to recover my sound?
2010-02-10T17:17:00.000Z	MoPi	n00p	does "/etc/init.d/pulseaudio restart" help?
2010-02-10T17:17:00.000Z	MoPi		propably need to put sudo in front of that
2010-02-10T17:18:00.000Z	n00p	MoPi	trying now
