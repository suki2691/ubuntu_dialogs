2006-11-11T11:29:00.000Z	jrib	Dev05	some themes use particular gtk engines, so yes depending on the theme
2006-11-11T11:30:00.000Z	Dev05	jrib	this one for example: http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=34779 It won't work, however I do have Clearlooks installed.
2006-11-11T11:30:00.000Z	jrib	Dev05	that one should probably work because, like you said, it is using clearlooks.  What exactly happens?
