2011-03-19T00:13:00.000Z	neohashi		hello.. question: is it possible to copy a a file which is currently being downloaded? say downloading an iso to my ubuntu box and then relay the file as it comes in over my lan/ftp to another box?

2011-03-19T00:16:00.000Z	neohashi	Gartral	ok so as long as my local ftp dosen't get to the end of the file I am good? or did I misunderstand
2011-03-19T00:16:00.000Z	Gartral	neohashi	you got it
