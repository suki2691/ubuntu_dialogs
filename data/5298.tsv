2012-07-09T13:15:00.000Z	L3top	geirha	<__Hayes__> ?: invalid HTTP proxy (http://localhost:4001 ): bad URI      <L3top>__Hayes__: can you please type env | grep -i proxy           and tell me if there is an htttp proxy there? <__Hayes__>  http_proxy=http://localhost:4001
2012-07-09T13:18:00.000Z	L3top	geirha	ok __Hayes__: unset http_proxy       so I would expect it to be gone now...
