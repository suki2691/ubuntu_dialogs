2007-01-21T16:18:00.000Z	vray	bimberi	thank you - i noticed at http://ez-ipupdate.com/userdoc.php that this program has no way of detecting a new IP if it's not on the gateway machine, which would be my situation. unfortunately, this site seems quite old and the rest of the commentary on this topic is unavailable. do you have any insight on this issue?
