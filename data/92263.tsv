2011-12-11T05:51:00.000Z	FrozenFire		Somehow, somewhere, a module got compiled in that just won't go away, and it needs to.

2011-12-11T05:53:00.000Z	FrozenFire	Jordan_U	I'm pretty sure that when I was running xorg-edgers packages, it compiled the binary nvidia kernel in somehow. Right now, it's stuck as a "permanent" module.
