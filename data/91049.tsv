2008-05-13T00:38:00.000Z	L0stm4n		I am installing onto a raid 1 array but the drive detection shows 2 disks in the partition tool. Is this correct?

2008-05-13T00:39:00.000Z	L0stm4n	mgolisch	yes it is
2008-05-13T00:39:00.000Z	mgolisch	L0stm4n	mostlikely some fake raid that does the raid stuff in the device driver
