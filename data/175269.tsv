2007-08-06T09:04:00.000Z	MrChicken		Hello
2007-08-06T09:04:00.000Z	MrChicken		I need to prevent non-admin users from shutting down the system
2007-08-06T09:04:00.000Z	MrChicken		I am running Xubuntu
2007-08-06T09:06:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	MrChicken	I would think creating a group to add regular users to, and making that group NOT be a member of sudoers, would do it. Somebody check me on that?
