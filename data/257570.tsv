2004-11-18T10:03:00.000Z	gif85		i have some troubles with K3B and Warty... K3B doesn't detect my DVD-R burner. It seems that the problem comes with the 2.6.8 kernel... Does someone know a patch ? a solution ?
2004-11-18T10:04:00.000Z	bwlang	gif85	it's also present in 2.6.9... i cannot find a solution - other than to run k3b as root... (not ideal)
2004-11-18T10:09:00.000Z	gif85	bwlang	thanks for information. Yep, it's a problem :( I don't like to run K3B as root. I'm going to compile an older 2.6.6 kernel instead. it's a solution... Not the best... But a solution :(
