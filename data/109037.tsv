2007-12-22T10:42:00.000Z	james_027		i am seeing some blogs, articles that says ubuntu 7.10 is killing a laptop hard drive, is this true?
2007-12-22T10:44:00.000Z	macogw	james_027	the hdd manufacturers put bad settings in their hdd's firmware (faster the hdd dies, the faster they get money for a new one, right?).  some systems override the manufacturer's settings.  ubuntu doesn't by default, but you can change the settings
2007-12-22T10:45:00.000Z	james_027	macogw	is there a article that teaches how to do that?
2007-12-22T10:46:00.000Z	macogw	james_027	i think there's a page on the wiki about how to use hdparm
