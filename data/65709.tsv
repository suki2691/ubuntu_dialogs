2009-04-08T02:36:00.000Z	Nytrix	Goldfisch	what if i install everything on my internal HD then i use the "Creat a usb start up disk" option? will that work? will this move my /boot and bootloader to usb?
2009-04-08T02:37:00.000Z	Goldfisch	Nytrix	Hmm...haven't used the option myself. However, I usually test new installations a few times using vmware, to shake out the procedure. I wonder how to tie that into using a usb boot loading partition.
