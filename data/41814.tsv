2010-01-20T16:35:00.000Z	MDGrey_-		update-rc.d: /etc/init.d/squid: file does not exist   how can i fix this
2010-01-20T16:37:00.000Z	MDGrey_-		i created a file using touch /etc/init.d/squid seems to have worked
2010-01-20T16:37:00.000Z	rob_p_	MDGrey_-	maybe squid3
2010-01-20T16:38:00.000Z	rob_p_	MDGrey_-	creating an empty init file for squid won't do anything useful as far as getting it to run...
