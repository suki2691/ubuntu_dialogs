2010-05-21T05:57:00.000Z	Smeh		so.. anyone able to assist with an xwindows / gnome issue in 10.04. I have an integrated intel 4 series graphics controller (revision 03) and startx just pops straight to a blank screen and the machine *seems* to(but may not actually) freeze completely. nothing in Xorg logs or syslog...
2010-05-21T05:59:00.000Z	Smeh		Greezmunkey : no, but i can get it there in no time at all..
2010-05-21T06:00:00.000Z	Smeh		what is "recovery" mode? i'm already in a text based login. I don't even know if this is normal, however, i'm using the "alternate" iso, and it doesn't start with an Xorg gui.. it boots to a text login
