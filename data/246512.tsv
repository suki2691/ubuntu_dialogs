2012-08-14T23:07:00.000Z	armenb_		I want to install a local deb file, but I want it to automatically fetch dependencies too.
2012-08-14T23:08:00.000Z	armenb_		"dpkg -i" lets me install local packages, but no dependencies; "apt-get install" takes care of dependencies but doesn't seem to have a local package option. am i just screwed and have to do this manually?
