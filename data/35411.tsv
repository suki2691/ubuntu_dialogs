2010-03-25T02:45:00.000Z	P-NuT		Hi guys, is anybody using anjal? The netbook frontend for evolution? It seems like it's needs something else installed as you can only see about an inch of your email. Does anyone else have this issue?
2010-03-25T02:46:00.000Z	iustinian	P-NuT	is there a special evolution frontend for netboos ?
2010-03-25T02:47:00.000Z	P-NuT	iustinian	Yes there is, it's called anjal
2010-03-25T02:48:00.000Z	iustinian	P-NuT	if the problem doesnt appear on regular evolution frontend maybe u need to address the bug to anjal developers
