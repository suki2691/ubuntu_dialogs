2008-08-12T12:26:00.000Z	debCarlos	pvh_sa|wrk	NoooooO!!! Why???..... oh, you're right.... mine doesn't have it....
2008-08-12T12:28:00.000Z	debCarlos	pvh_sa|wrk	Maybe with dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ?
2008-08-12T12:29:00.000Z	pvh_sa|wrk	debCarlos	good idea about that reconfigure... hehe, i've been using unix for... 16 years... so when i got dumped into nano on my new ubuntu installation i was really confused :D
