2007-03-26T14:59:00.000Z	_Mr_Denix_	dyrne	i have succesfully used ssh server on linux with a putty from an windows os . still FTP sounds more human :)
2007-03-26T15:00:00.000Z	dyrne	_Mr_Denix_	winscp is actually a very nice gui interface (drag drop)
2007-03-26T15:01:00.000Z	_Mr_Denix_	dyrne	checking it out thank you :) will bug later with questions if i won't make it :P
