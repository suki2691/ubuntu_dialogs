2009-10-20T01:28:00.000Z	trism	Blood	yes, there is, 2.6.31 is the latest one released though
2009-10-20T01:30:00.000Z	trism	Blood	no, there is no kernel package for 2.6.30 out (for jaunty anyway)
2009-10-20T01:31:00.000Z	trism	Blood	yes, I said a few lines ago, ubuntu karmic has a package from 2.6.31
