2010-03-14T04:23:00.000Z	hugo		I am having a problem with GRUB2, when using update-grub it fails to find windows boot files located in media/windows/Windows/boot .. Does anyone have an idea ?
2010-03-14T04:23:00.000Z	acicula	hugo	can you access the windows drive?
2010-03-14T04:23:00.000Z	acicula	hugo	ie is it mountable
2010-03-14T04:24:00.000Z	acicula	hugo	hmm dunno then, dont think wheter it is mounted or not makes any difference
