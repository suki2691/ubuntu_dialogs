2005-05-05T10:05:00.000Z	NigelS	lc	if you press the close button for the app (this is in gnome) gnome will notice the app won't close and offer to kill it.  Alternatively you can load the system monitor and kill the process from there or from the command line type kill -9 <pid> or pkill -9 process name or killall -9 process name (not to be used on a bsd system) :)
