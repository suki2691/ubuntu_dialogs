2010-02-23T15:12:00.000Z	feisar		Hi, I need to run 'apt-get dist-upgrade' in the early hours of the morning. I have entered 'apt-get -y dist-upgrade' in root's crontab and using 'top' I can tell it runs. But it does not update. Can someone explain why that might be?

2010-02-23T15:13:00.000Z	feisar	erUSUL	I have manually run apt-get update
2010-02-23T15:13:00.000Z	feisar	erUSUL	do I need to run it in the crontab also?
