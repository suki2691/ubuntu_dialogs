A few days ago I created a folder and a couple days later i saw the folder in nautilus had a lock on the icon so i looked at the permisions (right click permissions) and i saw that the user was 999 or user999. What could have happened? has my system been compromised? My username is not 999. thanks

2010-07-27T04:14:00.000Z	allrighty	cmpsalvestrini	that very well may be the case.. but im pretty sure ive done that before and i dont remember the user 999 thing..
