2009-12-12T11:10:00.000Z	ruediix		Repeating my question since the last reply I got was obviously wrong, I'm just checking something.  How do I update the kernel on a Ubuntu Live USB image?
2009-12-12T11:11:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	ruediix	I take it you cannot do updates?
2009-12-12T11:14:00.000Z	ruediix	ubuntuisloved	I'm not sure if they will work
2009-12-12T11:15:00.000Z	ruediix	ubuntuisloved	well I'll see if it reboots.  If not I'll use the custom spin utility to spin in all the updates to date.
