2006-11-14T09:56:00.000Z	Flannel	Daylighter	yep
2006-11-14T09:56:00.000Z	Flannel	Daylighter	install kubuntu-desktop, then you'll change via "session" at GDM/KDM (at login)
2006-11-14T09:57:00.000Z	Flannel	Daylighter	yeah, that'll install the Kubuntu desktop package (with kde, much like ubuntu-desktop installs the gnome flavor)
