2011-10-22T16:29:00.000Z	eXtr33m	scarleo	that doesn't work AFAIK, because eg. aptitude still hapilly upgrades the package when it can
2011-10-22T16:30:00.000Z	scarleo	eXtr33m	have you tried it?
2011-10-22T16:32:00.000Z	eXtr33m	scarleo	yeah i just read it, they are independent, apt and aptitude... silly but it is like that
