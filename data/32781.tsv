2010-05-18T06:47:00.000Z	Geekthras		friend's computer borked when updating and won't boot linux
2010-05-18T06:47:00.000Z	Geekthras		don't know where to look for the files that were on the ubuntu partition
2010-05-18T06:49:00.000Z	acerimmer	Geekthras	i gave up on wubi and set up a side by side dual boot because grub crashed wubi in 9.10.  Also given windows' inherent file registry issues, it was a lot less trouble to just dual it up.  My $0.02
