2012-09-09T22:30:00.000Z	Chris123	pth	I was trying to install Ubuntu but it didn?t work until I changed the "OS Installer" (or something like this) option in the BIOS to "Others" instead of "Windows". After Ubuntu was installed alongside Win7 I tried booting Win7 again but I got stuck at a black screen. Setting the Option back to "Windows" didn?t solve the problem so I formatted my hard drive. Is there another way to somehow install Ubuntu alongside Win7?
