2007-10-20T07:39:00.000Z	Akaishi		my issue is that my CD drive has a questionable IDE cable that causes data errors when I try to install from it. It's good enough to run the liveCD but I need to install to hard drive via network and I don't have another machine

It usually improves the electrical connections and solves the issues when the cable has been strained for whatever reason
