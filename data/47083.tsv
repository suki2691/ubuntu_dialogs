2010-05-24T06:29:00.000Z	CyL		Hi, I have plans on installing ubuntu on a laptop... what are the advantages and disadvantages of the 64 bit version?
2010-05-24T06:30:00.000Z	brax	CyL	the 64 bit will work faster on computers that support it, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't work with 32-bit computers.

2010-05-24T06:30:00.000Z	CyL	brax	how about binary compatibility with older software?
