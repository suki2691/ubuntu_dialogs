2008-05-20T23:05:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	hischild_	what hardware are you running and have you checked it out in the supported hardware list
2008-05-20T23:07:00.000Z	hischild_	Jack_Sparrow	i have not. Let me check that.
2008-05-20T23:16:00.000Z	hischild_	Jack_Sparrow	the laptop i'm trying to install it on is not in that list (Asus A7U) however the surrounding laptops appear to be supported. The alt installer has trouble detecting the HD, yet the BIOS has no options to change anything.
