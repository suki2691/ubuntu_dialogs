2010-02-11T03:34:00.000Z	kevin009		hey i"m on 9.04 and i don't have the "safely remove device" option when i right click drives. how can I add this so that my usb disks spin down when I unmount them?
2010-02-11T03:35:00.000Z	kevin009		this option is present in 9.10
2010-02-11T03:35:00.000Z	kevin009		the disk doesn't spin down when unmounted though, so I can't turn the power off on the drive
2010-02-11T03:36:00.000Z	Some_Person	kevin009	upgrade to 9.10
