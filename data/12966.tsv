2011-06-23T07:32:00.000Z	Isosceles		hi - I'm trying to set up an Ubuntu ufw firewall for just simple web browsing (desktop). I've allowed 53/udp & 80/tcp, but firefox won't see google if I use ufw default deny?
2011-06-23T07:32:00.000Z	Isosceles		can anyone help?
2011-06-23T07:33:00.000Z	icode	Isosceles	perhaps you have filtered the output traffic?
2011-06-23T07:34:00.000Z	Isosceles	icode	: for web browsing, should I be filtering outgoing or incoming? Do I need both?
