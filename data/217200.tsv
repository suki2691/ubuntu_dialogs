2005-12-13T16:22:00.000Z	dookie		can anyone help me out, i'm having trouble getting ubuntu to boot up
2005-12-13T16:24:00.000Z	dookie		cool thanks a lot, whenever i try to start ubuntu it hangs on "starting hotplug subsystems" and when i try under recover mode it gives me errors like kernel panic not syncing fatal exception in interrupt or attempted to kill init
2005-12-13T16:26:00.000Z	dookie		i can mess around in my bios to turn off my pci video card and it skips "starting hotplug subsystems" but i'd much rather use my video card than integrated video
