2011-06-29T07:53:00.000Z	blowson		yes, ok, here's the thing...my lucid has grown to about 15gb, with all unnecessary files removed. I do bare metal backups on an external drive, but i'd really like to make an installable liveusb or something. 15gb is too big for an iso, so...
2011-06-29T07:54:00.000Z	blowson		how do i make a bootable .img file from my system
2011-06-29T07:54:00.000Z	blowson		the .iso standard allows 8gb
2011-06-29T07:55:00.000Z	GNUdog	blowson	.iso with blu-ray could extend to 50GB
