2008-12-02T18:55:00.000Z	KDB9000		I am having some trouble playing a youtube flv file using vlc. I know this isn't an IRC for vlc but it is better then nothing. It comes up with an error saying it does not support undf. I am not sure what is wrong as it worked with the flv format before and just stopped all of a sudden. Even the videos that did work won't. What is wrong?

2008-12-02T18:56:00.000Z	KDB9000	lfaraone	there is an VLC IRC?
2008-12-02T18:57:00.000Z	lfaraone	KDB9000	yes.
