2009-06-23T10:18:00.000Z	drmrhorse_		i broke my jackalope. after i updated compiz and a few other things today, my desktop fails to load. i get to the login screen, login, and the screen disappears and comes back.  tried restarting x, rebooting, recovery mode with xfix. starting a console session then doing startx gets me a desktop with no sound. any ideas?

2009-06-23T10:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	drmrhorse_	 not that i am aware of.
2009-06-23T10:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	drmrhorse_	 it might be included in that (the restricted-extras is a meta-packages)
