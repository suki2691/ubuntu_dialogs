2008-10-16T18:26:00.000Z	Frijolie	Fzang	I believe wubi is just to install a dual-boot Windoze/Ubuntu
2008-10-16T18:27:00.000Z	Frijolie	Fzang	it just automates everything and makes it easier to uninstall after you're done with it in the Control Manager
2008-10-16T18:29:00.000Z	Frijolie	Fzang	I'm not sure to be honest, I've never used it. I haven't ran Windoze for over 2 years
