2005-10-15T05:36:00.000Z	Dreamglider	brownie17	one does not need to run on full power, lower the CPU usage and screen lighting and allso avoid using CD/DVD that will extend the battery life, mine had about 3 maybe 4 hours when it was new
2005-10-15T05:37:00.000Z	brownie17	Dreamglider	but is it worth underclocking and sacrficing visibility just so you can have a lighter computer? where do you go apart from trains and things where you need battery power anyway?
