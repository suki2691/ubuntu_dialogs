2011-12-11T02:03:00.000Z	SilverFox		So, I've installed Oneiric on my MBP 5,3 and I've noticed a couple of 'issues'.  Is it good/beneficial for me to file bugs for these (external monitor not working, magicmouse not working) ?
2011-12-11T02:05:00.000Z	SilverFox		I don't see oneiric specific bugs on these issues on launchpad, but on the macbook wiki it says the external display worked fine in Lucid according to the mactel wiki.

2011-12-11T02:07:00.000Z	SilverFox	urlin2u	I have looked, but haven't found anything suggesting that others have trouble with this, nor is there any similar bugs on launchpad.
