2007-10-20T03:24:00.000Z	kitche	silliness	sudo <file> it should ask you where you want to install it
2007-10-20T03:25:00.000Z	silliness	kitche	thats what I thought cause when running the installer I always get cannot install to /usr/bin
2007-10-20T03:26:00.000Z	silliness	kitche	may I start private chat with you cause it is nuts in here?
