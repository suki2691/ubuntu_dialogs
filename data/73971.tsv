2008-11-19T00:31:00.000Z	chanibal	j3frea	file perhaps?
2008-11-19T00:34:00.000Z	chanibal	j3frea	ok, file doens't work, but mplayer did write that stuff - and you can pass commands to it, like so it'll quit right away leaving the info
2008-11-19T00:35:00.000Z	j3frea	chanibal	thanks - looking into "mp3info"
