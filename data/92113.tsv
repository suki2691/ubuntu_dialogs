2008-05-04T22:40:00.000Z	Flannel	kFj_	You will have to remove ubuntu-desktop, that won't remove gnome.
2008-05-04T22:42:00.000Z	kFj_	Flannel	what does ubuntu-desktop include?
2008-05-04T22:43:00.000Z	Flannel	kFj_	ubuntu-desktop doesn't actually include anything.  It's just a metapackage that depends on (and therefore requires) other packages
