2009-02-02T06:11:00.000Z	mic_lovin		i believe in letting ubuntu do critical updates and such ..BUT.. i want my laptop to be lean and mean ... i don't need cups, bind9, etc, etc, etc ... is there some way to limit the automatic updaes to just those that are in the critical category?
2009-02-02T06:13:00.000Z	mic_lovin		are arch and gentoo laptop distros?
