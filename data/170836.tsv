2006-08-15T06:56:00.000Z	Orasis1		Last time I remember Gnome it was pretty harsh on the resources, but not as bad as KDE, KDE is a resource hog./
2006-08-15T06:57:00.000Z	prower	Orasis1	Yes, KDE is pretty heavy...on the other hand it also does quite a lot, so I guess there's a tradeoff :>
2006-08-15T06:57:00.000Z	Orasis1	prower	Yeah, but I enjoy building my own system up :) KDE robs all that fun away from me :))
