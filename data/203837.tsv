2005-12-21T08:46:00.000Z	secureboot		i'm trying to debootstrap an ubuntu system on my debian box - is there a debootstrap source for ubuntu i can build and run?
2005-12-21T08:46:00.000Z	secureboot		i tried to grab one, and it only had debian targets

2005-12-21T08:48:00.000Z	M_Cheevy	secureboot	or "debootstrap breezy <target partition> <ubuntu repository>"
