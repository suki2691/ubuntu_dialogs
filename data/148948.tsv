2007-02-06T17:09:00.000Z	CheshireViking	unop	very true, i read a lot before i installed anything, when i started installing i was reading up all the time & trying things out
2007-02-06T17:11:00.000Z	unop	CheshireViking	 yea, we find that people asking questions in the room don't read enough -- and when asked to complain that it takes too long to achieve anything .. dont understand why they dont stick with windows then :)
2007-02-06T17:14:00.000Z	CheshireViking	unop	I had to read, i (maybe insanely) installed Slackware as my first introduction to Linux & ran that for 3 months gettinig used to terminal commands to do things before I tried ubuntu, in a way, i'm glad i did that though
