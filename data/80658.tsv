2008-10-28T11:54:00.000Z	Brian88		Hi, I want to install the latest KDE version (4.1) to some PCs (I have 2 PCs and 1 Laptop) but I don't have much bandwith (and I will not do apt-get install kubuntu-desktop on 3 PCs). Can I have the *.deb file so a single download can install to 3 PCs?
2008-10-28T11:55:00.000Z	rski	Brian88	you can setup a local mirror and apt-get from that one
2008-10-28T11:58:00.000Z	Brian88	rski	How can I do that?
2008-10-28T11:59:00.000Z	Brian88	rski	How can I start the local mirror??
