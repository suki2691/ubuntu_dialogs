2012-07-21T05:26:00.000Z	naryfa		Hello, can anybody tell me how do I uninstall gnome-shell but leave some of its applications like evolution, transmission ?
2012-07-21T05:26:00.000Z	naryfa		how would I add an option to omit those

2012-07-21T05:29:00.000Z	L3top	naryfa	typically remove, removes the application but leaves the config behind... which is really the majority of the rationalle behind remove --purge
