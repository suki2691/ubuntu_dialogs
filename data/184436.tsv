2006-06-06T08:10:00.000Z	Varanger		... in dapper
2006-06-06T08:11:00.000Z	kermitX_	Varanger	you can get it to read and playback dvd's but i don't believe that dvd menus are supported in the new gstreamer 0.10 -- recommend replacing your totem-gstreamer with totem-xine  -- see wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats for more info.
2006-06-06T08:11:00.000Z	Varanger	kermitX_	it's ok about not having menus but I still want to use dapper gstreamer... what plugin should I use???
