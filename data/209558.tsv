2007-05-01T14:24:00.000Z	jsmidt		Which packages do are the the OpenGL Python bindings and the GtkGLExt Python bindings
2007-05-01T14:25:00.000Z	LjL	jsmidt	does typing  apt-cache search opengl python  not do the trick?
2007-05-01T14:34:00.000Z	jsmidt	LjL	your advice works for opengl bindings but what package is the GtkGLExt Python bindings?
2007-05-01T14:38:00.000Z	LjL	jsmidt	i can't find it, to be honest. but http://www.k-3d.org/gtkglext/Main_Page says there's an Ubuntu package available from third parties
