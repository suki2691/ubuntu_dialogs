2008-03-07T01:17:00.000Z	Downsay		could someone answer some very basic questions for me with Linux, please?
2008-03-07T01:18:00.000Z	Downsay		I'm interested in getting Linux, Mint...is it a good OS and how do I boot from a CD?
2008-03-07T01:18:00.000Z	Downsay		I realize this is for Ubuntu, which I am currently using, but I have no idea where to turn for some guidance
2008-03-07T01:18:00.000Z	NinjaPlimsoles	Downsay	i would recommend joining Linux Mint's IRC room for those kinds of questions :)
