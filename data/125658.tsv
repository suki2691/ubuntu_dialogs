2007-12-06T19:05:00.000Z	dgjones	BrianB04	there was somebody asking about Sansa yesterday, i think they had to change a setting on the player for the USB mode, can't remember the details, give me a minute & find what was said
2007-12-06T19:09:00.000Z	dgjones	BrianB04	there was something said about changing the USB mode from either MSC to MTP mode do that Ubuntu would see it as a removable drive (it could be the other way round from MTP to MSC depending on whats its set as to start with)
