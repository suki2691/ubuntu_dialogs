2008-02-20T20:13:00.000Z	Jouva		I have a system I'm trying to install Ubuntu onto, and there's been a LOT of reading from the CD once the CD started to try to load X. Is this sometimes common?

2008-02-20T20:15:00.000Z	Jouva	sdsheeks	It's been atleast... 20 minutes and it still hasn't gotten to the desktop yet to run the installer.
2008-02-20T20:16:00.000Z	sdsheeks	Jouva	that is not normal.  Is it scratched?
