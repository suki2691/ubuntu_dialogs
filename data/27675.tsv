2010-08-10T06:50:00.000Z	nimbiotics		Hi all. I Think I've got a serious problem: I cannot see the login dialog window. Sometimes Its like the system just stops before showing it without freezing, and sometimes I can can navigate using the arrows keys, select my username by pressing enter, type my pwd and voila! all this without seeing any response on the screen untill I'm loged in. What can I do? TIA!
