2005-09-13T06:45:00.000Z	chombee		Hey - Breezy: the current release has GNOME 2.12 but still has Eye of Gnome and apparently no PDF reader installed by default? Is the final release going to get rid of eog too and add Evince to the default? Is it still going to use Gthumb or move to f-spot?
2005-09-13T06:45:00.000Z	onkarshinde	chombee	And why do you want eog to be removed?
2005-09-13T06:46:00.000Z	chombee	onkarshinde	- I just thought that GNOME 2.12 replaced eog and PDF viewers with Evince
2005-09-13T06:47:00.000Z	onkarshinde	chombee	AFAIK, Evince just replaces Ghostview and gpdf
