2007-04-22T13:19:00.000Z	Meshezabeel		I find it strange that the system requirements aren't posted anywhere on the ubuntu website
2007-04-22T13:19:00.000Z	Meshezabeel		I can also get a PIII 550, 256Mb RAM, 8Mb ATI video for $25CDN
2007-04-22T13:19:00.000Z	Meshezabeel		I will get that one for sure, and maybe the other one too
2007-04-22T13:20:00.000Z	Pelo	Meshezabeel	  they are on the site their just not called system requirements ,  I don'T remember what they are called tho
