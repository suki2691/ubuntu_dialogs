2008-09-20T10:37:00.000Z	Flannel	Dap1	what makes you think its still there?
2008-09-20T10:38:00.000Z	Flannel	Dap1	Ah.  That may read the users available when you log in and cache that information or something.
2008-09-20T10:40:00.000Z	Flannel	Dap1	I'd imagine it would.  I'm not really sure how fast user switcher works.  But yes, it should.
