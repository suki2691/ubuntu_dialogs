2007-11-19T21:36:00.000Z	DosKey		I had to install my wireless dongle manually and i blacklisted the standard ubuntu wireless modules. When i boot linux up it automatically loads the standard modules up. If i unplug my dongle and wait for ubuntu to load, then insert it. It works... Please help !?!?!?
