2008-02-24T00:52:00.000Z	releod		Is there a service I can install to share music with other computers on my local network? I used to use RhythmBox, but am trying to avoid having a user automatically login, would prefer a service to share a folder at boot. Ubuntu 7.10

2008-02-24T00:53:00.000Z	releod	rukuartic	I have AFP (netatalk) setup, I would also like to have the library on the ubuntu server showing up as a shared library in iTunes on the other comps  as well..
