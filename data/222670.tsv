2011-04-04T20:17:00.000Z	mneptok	frank_	you're trying to connect a computer to the cable modem that is not usually connected?
2011-04-04T20:18:00.000Z	frank_	mneptok	I typically don't use a router. I go straight from the modem to the comptuer. I never had a problem, but today the desktop wouldn't recognize the wired connection. So I set up the linksys so I could wire in my laptop and get online
