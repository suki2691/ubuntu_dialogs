2005-06-28T09:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Danar	there is a utility called "defrag" - but what its capabilities are I don't know, as I've never needed it...
2005-06-28T09:30:00.000Z	Danar	thoreauputic	it defrags ext2, IIRC
2005-06-28T09:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Danar	ah - you may be right - as I say I've never needed to defrag so...
