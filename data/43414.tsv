2009-11-22T07:46:00.000Z	Thermoelectric		ANy idea on how to upgrade Ubuntu 9.04 to 9.10 using a normal installer (iso) (not the alternate installer, like http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading says I should use)?
2009-11-22T07:46:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Thermoelectric	you would have to just reinstall.  You cant upgrade
2009-11-22T07:47:00.000Z	Thermoelectric	ChogyDan	So I would lose the system preferences and all that stuff if I reinstall?
2009-11-22T07:47:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Thermoelectric	not necessarily
