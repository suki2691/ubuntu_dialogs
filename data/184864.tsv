2006-05-27T16:43:00.000Z	njan	Manika	that's not really a useful question without more information on what you did and what sort of phone it is..
2006-05-27T16:44:00.000Z	Manika	njan	I pasted the elephants dream movie in '3gp' format inside it.. nothing more.. it's a sony w600i
2006-05-27T16:46:00.000Z	Manika	njan	the file has 58 MB and the phone had more than 200 MB free.. so it's not a memory problem
