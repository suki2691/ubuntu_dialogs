2011-04-06T18:03:00.000Z	carlos_guerrilha		im trying to install ubuntu on a preety old compaq notebook, its a p4 with 40gb and 256ram, ubuntu 10.10 gave some errors on booting. Do you recommend for me a lighter distro or something?
2011-04-06T18:04:00.000Z	carlos_guerrilha		will ubuntu work at all in this confs?
2011-04-06T18:04:00.000Z	ikonia	carlos_guerrilha	you may have an easier time with Xubuntu
2011-04-06T18:04:00.000Z	ikonia	carlos_guerrilha	still a little light on ram though
