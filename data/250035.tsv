2007-12-05T22:33:00.000Z	Squirrely_Wrath		So I guess I can't be helped.
2007-12-05T22:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Squirrely_Wrath	 ati drivers can have bugs.. sadly..
2007-12-05T22:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Squirrely_Wrath	 i would say check the ati/linux forums and see if anyoht else has had simielr issues
2007-12-05T22:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Squirrely_Wrath	 i would say hit google first.
