2006-08-09T06:44:00.000Z	jjordan		will ubuntu 6.06 install on a sata drive?
2006-08-09T06:46:00.000Z	jjordan		if the live cd works fine (except for install hardware drivers) but install hangs at 15% "detecting file systems"...anyone have a suggestion on what might be causing this?
2006-08-09T06:46:00.000Z	jjordan		no
2006-08-09T06:47:00.000Z	glen_	jjordan	try the alternate cd. there's bugs in the graphical/live installer
