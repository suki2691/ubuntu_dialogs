2012-04-17T18:19:00.000Z	naftilos76		hi everyone, i am migrating from KDE kmail2 to evolution or thunderbird because kmail2 is a total failure after kmail->kmail2. Bugs, bugs, bugs and more bugs...Can anybody please give me his/her feedback regarding the use of evolution or thunderbird operation? I will use IMAP to sync with my server. Have you had any problems with it?
