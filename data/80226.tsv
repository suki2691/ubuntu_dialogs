2008-09-12T13:16:00.000Z	nkei0	Flannel	I don't know what TTY is but, I started ubuntu in recovery mode, and I was in the root command line.
2008-09-12T13:17:00.000Z	Flannel	nkei0	Alright, that'd be why.  gedit only works when you have a GUI.  You'll want to use nano instead.
2008-09-12T13:17:00.000Z	nkei0	Flannel	Awesome, that's good news to hear.  I thought something else was broken!  Hah.  I will return then, I'm going to try this noacpi fix i've seen posted around
