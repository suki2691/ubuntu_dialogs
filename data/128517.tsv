2007-07-09T16:48:00.000Z	fisherhome		so i'd like to build a server for my new place and am considering using ubuntu but the lack of gui is a bit spooky.. can ubuntu server 7.04 i386 handle gnome?
2007-07-09T16:49:00.000Z	fisherhome		i'm not, i love CLI i just don't know it solidly enough yet to manage a server
2007-07-09T16:50:00.000Z	fisherhome		i figured if gnome was there as a backup, i'd have no problems learning it

The GUI wouldn't do you much good even if you had it. That said, Ubuntu desktop can to all the server tasks anyways. If this is for a home application, just do what you want on Desktop, then you have your GUI.
