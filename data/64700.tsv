2010-02-17T05:17:00.000Z	marsje		anyone has VirtualBox working with WinXP guest and shared folders? I tend to get a blue screen of death when accessing my ubuntu folders...
2010-02-17T05:18:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	marsje	as a work-around you could use Samba on your Ubuntu to share to you WinXP guest
2010-02-17T05:19:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	marsje	if you really need shared folders try asking in #vbox
2010-02-17T05:21:00.000Z	marsje	ZykoticK9	already asked in #vbox, but everyone is asleep there... I might try samba/ssh... but still it would be nice if shared folders worked. it should...
