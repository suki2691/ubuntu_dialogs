2006-11-08T10:37:00.000Z	fluxinator		I recently installed edgy from live cd, and I wanted to know whether or not the root account is supposed to be enabled
2006-11-08T10:38:00.000Z	|rt|	fluxinator	ubuntu doesn't really come with root enabled out of the box...administration is intended to be done using sudo
2006-11-08T10:40:00.000Z	fluxinator	|rt|	I know but I am looking through the users and groups and I see root there
2006-11-08T10:41:00.000Z	fluxinator	|rt|	 there is root and fluxinator listed as accounts
