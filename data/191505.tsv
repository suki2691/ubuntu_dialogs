2009-08-16T07:18:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss		how can I repair this error?  "E: daemontools-run: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 1"
2009-08-16T07:18:00.000Z	ectospasm	jeeves_Moss	I don't know daemontools, but that's not a very descriptive error
2009-08-16T07:31:00.000Z	ectospasm	jeeves_Moss	if you know the name of the file (and it's on your system) you can use dpkg-query /path/to/file
2009-08-16T07:32:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	ectospasm	that's the problem.  I don't think it's installed.  I got a script from someone that needs urllib and urllib2, and I can't find them for Ubuntu
