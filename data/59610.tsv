2009-04-25T02:31:00.000Z	triciens		I have a file sitting on my Desktop. Lets pretend the file is called 'i_am_file.run'. My question is, how to I run the file? I tried 'sudo i_am_file.run' in the terminal but it didn't work.
2009-04-25T02:31:00.000Z	histo	triciens	sh file.run
2009-04-25T02:31:00.000Z	triciens	histo	ty
2009-04-25T02:31:00.000Z	histo	triciens	the file also has to be executable.
