2012-04-28T13:45:00.000Z	Starminn		Would a removal/reinstallation of Compiz && CCSM be detrimental to my system, or would it revert back to "stock"?
2012-04-28T13:45:00.000Z	Starminn		(via command-line, that is)
2012-04-28T13:46:00.000Z	std0s	Starminn	it wouldnt go back to stock - unless thats the only change you made
2012-04-28T13:48:00.000Z	Starminn	std0s	I just mean as far as Compiz settings goes. If I "sudo apt-get purge compiz && ccsm", then "sudo apt-get install compiz" would all compiz settings go back to 'stock' settings? (I *may* have borked something in CCSM to where windows and pop-up menus refuse to reveal themselves to me)
