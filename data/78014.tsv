2008-10-03T04:16:00.000Z	khanfused	heirenton	-- the default xorg.conf doesn't seem to HAVE any defined video modes (resolutions) ... which is the first time I've seen that conf without them.

2008-10-03T04:18:00.000Z	heirenton	khanfused	same issue. I bluntantly copied a old xorg.conf  backup over it with changing the resolutions but i don't know exactly why this happens...
