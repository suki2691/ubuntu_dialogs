2007-12-18T11:47:00.000Z	docgnome	Zenerek	Yeah. Upgrades always end up breaking something or other for me. Usually X, but sometimes it's other things.
2007-12-18T11:47:00.000Z	docgnome	Zenerek	then again I haven't tried one from feisty or whatever the previous distro was.
2007-12-18T11:49:00.000Z	Zenerek	docgnome	heh never done one myself, though i know how to do it, truth my main machine here is still running dapper, watint for the next lts hardy before upgrading
