2007-08-20T13:47:00.000Z	mattwalston	jim12	works just fine, in fact it is the only way for me to use a scanner in linux
2007-08-20T13:50:00.000Z	jim12	mattwalston	how would it work with a usb controller for say a n64 emulator
2007-08-20T13:50:00.000Z	mattwalston	jim12	it should work with an usb device so long as the kernel drivers are not using it
