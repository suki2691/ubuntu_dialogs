2009-05-20T17:15:00.000Z	x4d		Hello, I've been using vim for a couple of weeks, I'm trying to use it mainly for php/html/css and having used textmate before, vim seems to be a good replacement once I get a hang of all the shortcuts. I was wondering if emacs would be more useful for php and web development in general?
