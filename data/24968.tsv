2012-06-13T03:11:00.000Z	onryo	Jordan_U	was just some old junk I tossed up. But yeah your right. Its would have to be LGPL due to the fact that ppl might link all sorts of blobs and stuff to it. Since its just interpreted bash and awk though I am not even sure I can put a license on it. Anybody can do what they want with it. Lets just give it a BSD license then =)
2012-06-13T03:14:00.000Z	onryo	Jordan_U	there is an awesome # here on freenode for bash. Now I only code POSIX. That script is a awful mess but works darn good =)
