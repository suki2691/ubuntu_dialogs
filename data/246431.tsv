2005-03-08T14:05:00.000Z	spinifex		hey ubuntu guys.  An update a while ago made it so I can't use synaptic or the network manager anymore.  I launch them, and it shows the "starting .." thing on the taskbar, but then it just disappears
2005-03-08T14:06:00.000Z	spinifex		any advice as to why this would happen?  I'm using hoary
2005-03-08T14:07:00.000Z	spinifex		I can still use apt-get, of course, but how can I enable my wireless connection without the network configurator?
