2012-06-07T12:11:00.000Z	daze		I set my default video player to GNOME Mplayer in Ubuntu 12.04 All Settings -> Details -> Default Applications.  Nothing happens. Mplayer is still the default :/
2012-06-07T12:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daze	gnome-mplayer is just a GUI for mplayer, it achieves the same thing surely.
2012-06-07T14:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daze	no need for journalized file systems
2012-06-07T14:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	daze	or do you mean defrag FAT32 etc?
