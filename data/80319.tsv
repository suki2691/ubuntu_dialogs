2008-09-07T01:03:00.000Z	NickR78		Hello. Anyone running the 2.6.26 kernel from intrepid on hardy ? im just trying it now to see if it fixes a big machine lock up problem.
2008-09-07T01:04:00.000Z	kunim	NickR78	i run the interpid kernel on hardy. i fail to install ati hd3200 drivers - otherwise it seems to work :/
2008-09-07T01:05:00.000Z	NickR78	kunim	great, stable ? my longest uptime is 3 hours with 2.24 kernel...
2008-09-07T01:05:00.000Z	kunim	NickR78	well to put it this way: better than the hardy kernel.
