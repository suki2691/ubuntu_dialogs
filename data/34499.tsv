2010-05-02T19:45:00.000Z	Jaymac		for some reason my gdm background has been changed
2010-05-02T19:46:00.000Z	Jaymac		i think it happened after i installed the community-themes package - the background is now one of the images in my wallpapers folder - any way to easily change it back?
2010-05-02T19:46:00.000Z	SuNk8	Jaymac	Did u try changing the wallpaper manually?
