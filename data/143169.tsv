2007-09-04T15:20:00.000Z	Frosteh		Is there anyone here who can help me setup Ubuntu 7.04 through a bridged SDSL router?  Simply entering settings through the GUI like would be done in WinXP doesn't work...
2007-09-04T15:20:00.000Z	gerro	Frosteh	what is your problem with installing it?
2007-09-04T15:22:00.000Z	gerro	Frosteh	so ubuntu 7.04 is installed and you have no ethernet working?
2007-09-04T15:23:00.000Z	gerro	Frosteh	you can ping the gateway router though right?
