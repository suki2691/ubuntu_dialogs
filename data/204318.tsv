2006-11-09T10:05:00.000Z	rc55		I was wondering - is there any sort of server management front end for ubuntu?
2006-11-09T10:06:00.000Z	Subhuman	rc55	admin for what?
2006-11-09T10:06:00.000Z	Subhuman		i mean, if you need a server, you should know how to admin one on the CLI - phpmyadmin is a ncie web based mysql admin app.
2006-11-09T10:06:00.000Z	rc55	Subhuman	something like the windows server administration console, a central location for managing users, computers, shares, printers etc
