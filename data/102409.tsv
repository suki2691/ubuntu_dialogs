2009-01-21T15:42:00.000Z	s0undt3ch		can anyone tell me why the hell installing libapache2-mod-wsgi requires libmysqlclient15off and mysql-common?
2009-01-21T15:44:00.000Z	rww	s0undt3ch	Which version of Ubuntu are you using?
2009-01-21T15:47:00.000Z	rww	s0undt3ch	because as far as I can see, neither libapache2-mod-wsgi nor any of the packages it depends on depend on mysql-common or libmysqlclient15off
