2007-07-24T13:40:00.000Z	TTilus	dissection	chmod 0710 .fetchmailrc
2007-07-24T13:41:00.000Z	TTilus	dissection	no, you own that file and owner is given all access (the '7' on the hex and 'rwx' part on the symbolic notation)
2007-07-24T13:42:00.000Z	TTilus	dissection	(given that you really own the file  :)
