2007-11-16T00:03:00.000Z	Tilllinux		hi there...
2007-11-16T00:05:00.000Z	Tilllinux		why does the update-manager (or apt-get update/upgrade) request the gutsy-cd if it could use the internet instead? I'm asking, because, when answering "cancel" to the "please insert the cd XYZ" dialog the update just stops and doesn't even try to download the packages from the internet... You'll have to delete the cd-sources from the sources-list...
2007-11-16T00:05:00.000Z	Tilllinux		wouldn't it be easier to be asked wether to use the cd or not?
2007-11-16T00:06:00.000Z	desertc	Tilllinux	Sure.  But, Do you have a problem?
