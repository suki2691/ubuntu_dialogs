2008-08-14T01:41:00.000Z	MadsRH		Hi - where do I go to get help with my OpenPGP key?
2008-08-14T01:41:00.000Z	Slart	MadsRH	you can try asking here... or check if there is a pgp channel out there somewhere.. perhaps #pgp
2008-08-14T01:45:00.000Z	Slart	MadsRH	put all the info into one question.. what you are trying to do, what error messages you get.. if you're following a howto somewhere... etc.. put it all into one question and then ask that
2008-08-14T01:45:00.000Z	Slart	MadsRH	I don't know much about pgp.. but perhaps someone else does
