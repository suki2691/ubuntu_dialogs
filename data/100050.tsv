2008-04-15T21:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	aeleon	no iptables rule is loaded by deault on ubuntu
2008-04-15T21:25:00.000Z	aeleon	erUSUL	basically, i've got ports forwarded just fine on the router my ubuntu server is attached to. and my vpn works beautifully, so much so that i can enter my router from my client. But the ports listed as forwarded on my router don't look open from my client.
