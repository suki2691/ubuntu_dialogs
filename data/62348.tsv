2012-11-02T20:56:00.000Z	Juggie		Hi All... I am running 10.04.4LTS... if I do a dist-upgrade w/ LTS is that going to upgrade me to 12.04.1LTS or 12.10?
2012-11-02T20:57:00.000Z	iceroot	Juggie	dist-upgrade will NOT upgrade your ubuntu version
2012-11-02T20:58:00.000Z	iceroot	Juggie	but the normal upgrade process when you want to upgrade the ubuntu version will bring you to 12.04
2012-11-02T20:59:00.000Z	Juggie	iceroot	oh I was under the impression it would my mistake.
