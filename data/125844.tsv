2008-08-03T04:21:00.000Z	RequinB4	Maeva	X is a Window System, compiz is ubuntu's default window manager
2008-08-03T04:23:00.000Z	RequinB4	Maeva	Not really, but why would you want to?
2008-08-03T04:24:00.000Z	RequinB4	Maeva	you can control every way your windows etc look without changing the manager itself
