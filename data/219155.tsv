2006-10-07T15:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	SkramX	right click on it and choose burn
2006-10-07T15:14:00.000Z	SkramX	erUSUL	it has said initializing and the progress hasnt moved in a while..
2006-10-07T15:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	SkramX	do not know what may be wrong. does the burner work with other progrmas like gnomebaker? or k3b?
