2005-07-31T15:18:00.000Z	Aron_Figaro		hey guys, I'm trying to set up a MIDI server at the moment and I need A) a good soundfont or B) a means of opening this self-extrating exe soundfont that says it can't execute.
2005-07-31T15:20:00.000Z	Aron_Figaro		Anyone have anything to help me with my self-extrating EXE problem?
2005-07-31T15:21:00.000Z	mcphail	Aron_Figaro	you could try a simple unzip. It often works.
2005-07-31T15:24:00.000Z	mcphail	Aron_Figaro	can you run it under WINE?
