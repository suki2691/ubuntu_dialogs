2007-09-03T12:48:00.000Z	tom314		Does anyone know why my 7.04 ubunutu system will show a blank screen when booting into X normally, but if I chose recovery mode and "startx" it works fine?
2007-09-03T12:48:00.000Z	VSpike	tom314	what card?
2007-09-03T12:50:00.000Z	VSpike	tom314	I had a similar problem with an X800 card, which was because the open ATI driver did not support it.  Only options were to use Vesa driver (i.e. recovery mode, I think) or to install the binary ATI driver
2007-09-03T12:51:00.000Z	VSpike	tom314	OK, not the same problem as I had then
