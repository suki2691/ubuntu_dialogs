2010-10-26T12:14:00.000Z	_Shade_		I just installed unity to check out how it works, and now when I removed it - i've lost my gnome panel, desktop icons, everything
2010-10-26T12:15:00.000Z	_Shade_		what can I do to bring it back?
2010-10-26T12:16:00.000Z	coz_	_Shade_	  try logging out  then log in but before you hit enter  look at the sessions and make sure you go into gnome session
