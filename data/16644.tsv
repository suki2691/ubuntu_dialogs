2011-03-23T15:03:00.000Z	critical_max	Us3r_Unfriendly	it actually had its strong points to me (easy installation and did not destabilize Windows at all) but this particular pain point of not being able to resize its partition (wth) really hurt me too
2011-03-23T15:04:00.000Z	critical_max	Us3r_Unfriendly	All the virtual machine controllers can do it, and my impression was they were doing loopback too. I could be wrong on that...
2011-03-23T15:04:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	critical_max	yeah, I haven't used wubi in years and years, couldn't tell you...I just always used gparted and installed on the freespace that was created
