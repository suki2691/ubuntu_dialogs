2011-10-20T00:19:00.000Z	kristina		Hey, I really need some help. I  had a document open in openoffice writer and the power went out. I restarted my computer and tried to recover the document, but it says "recovery failed". is there any possible way I can recover it?

2011-10-20T00:32:00.000Z	cajunmlle	kristina	were you saving the file just as the power went out?
2011-10-20T00:33:00.000Z	kristina	cajunmlle	No, but it autosaves sometimes, so I'm thinking maybe that's what happened.
