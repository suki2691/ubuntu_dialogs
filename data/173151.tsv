2006-08-04T10:14:00.000Z	GTX		Hello, I have setup a Counter Strike Source Server on Ubuntu, It's only getting 50 FPS and cannot go over, I know this is down to the kernel its using, does anyone know which one doesn't have such a limit?
2006-08-04T10:14:00.000Z	GTX		Think its something to do with kernel clock or somehting
2006-08-04T10:14:00.000Z	medfly	GTX	you said youre running the server, not the client.. ?
2006-08-04T10:14:00.000Z	GTX	medfly	I am running server, Its the tickrate not FPS sorry
