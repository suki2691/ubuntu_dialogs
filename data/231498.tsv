2008-10-09T04:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Sl4y31	 i install the nvidia drivers, and the nvidia-settings tool and enable twinview, and either clone, or streatch my desktop to include the tv out. on my Nvidia systems.. Note that after enabling the 2nd monitor with 'sudo nvidia-settings' you MUST restart X to get all apps to notice the change. otherwise some apps may act a little weird.
2008-10-09T04:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Sl4y31	 that sums it all up on what i do. :) im cooking supper.. so i gotta go check the cornbread.
