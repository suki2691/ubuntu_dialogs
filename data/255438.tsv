2010-07-04T23:53:00.000Z	josephnexus		I'm trying to add a PPA, the repo adds nicely, but for some reason i can't get any keys from the keyserver.ubuntu.com server
2010-07-04T23:53:00.000Z	josephnexus		any ideas on what could be causing that?
2010-07-04T23:55:00.000Z	josephnexus		i run the apt-key command, it sites there for a while, then it says "gpg: keyserver timed out" followed by "gpg: keyserver receive failed: keyserver error"
