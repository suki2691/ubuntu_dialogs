2009-06-08T23:31:00.000Z	kazagistar	davidh38	it is slightly better configured at the start... nice color scheme, smaller interface, comes with gnome-do and some codecs.... but that is like 10 min to fix in ubuntu, if it comes to that

2009-06-08T23:34:00.000Z	kazagistar	davidh38	bad news... it takes a nasty hack to free firefox from the ugly "custom" mint search results page that gives them money per hit
