2005-06-11T05:50:00.000Z	imaek		Back.... When trying to install the Nvidia accelerated graphics driver, it told me to get the kernel source, and I got the package `nvidia-kernel-source', but now it still says it can't find the kernel tree, and it tells me I can specify a location.  What location should I specify?
2005-06-11T05:51:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	imaek	: my advice, download the drivers from nvidia and the kernel source from kernel.org  and install em manually
2005-06-11T05:55:00.000Z	imaek	lsuactiafner	what was that site you gave me?
2005-06-11T05:55:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	imaek	: kernel.org but if you dont know how to extract a kernel and do a menu config i suggest to trust in apt-get
