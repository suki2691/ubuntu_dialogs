2012-02-04T15:42:00.000Z	Gabi		everytime i try to do something in terminal like : ./install or anything else it says : bash: ./install: command not found
2012-02-04T15:42:00.000Z	Gabi		how can i fix it
2012-02-04T15:42:00.000Z	theadmin	Gabi	Is "install" marked executable? Is it really not a typo?
2012-02-04T15:46:00.000Z	theadmin	Gabi	I would like to point out that "install", "Install", "InStAlL" and "INSTALL" are all *different* names. Linux is case-sensetive. You understand that?
