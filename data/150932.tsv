2007-01-13T13:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_Laptop	whileimhere	 not that i know of.. it may depend on the encryption
2007-01-13T13:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_Laptop	whileimhere	 all the encrpted wmv's ive seen are the kind you err... 'dont' want to let others know you are watching.
2007-01-13T13:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_Laptop	whileimhere	 ive seen a huge # of malware/crudware riding alongside encrypted wmv's you can download.. i avoide all wmvs now a days.
