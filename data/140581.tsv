2008-10-05T00:23:00.000Z	electronbender		has anyone seen this before: i rebooted my pc to find the hdd has been restored to a state from 3 months before... i'm talking logs, files, document, everything
2008-10-05T00:24:00.000Z	electronbender		i think ext3
2008-10-05T00:24:00.000Z	electronbender		how do i restore to previous state?\
2008-10-05T00:24:00.000Z	Ali_ix	electronbender	there is no such function (like rollback) in ext3
