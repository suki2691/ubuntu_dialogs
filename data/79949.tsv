2008-09-25T06:04:00.000Z	caio		I need to access a computer with Remote Desktop, but the computer is on other network, without a physical ip address, how can I do this?
2008-09-25T06:06:00.000Z	pedro-orange	caio	Phsyical IP? What do you mean by this? IP is a logical address. A MAC address is a physical address.
2008-09-25T06:09:00.000Z	caio	pedro-orange	sorry, I cant access because the only IP that I have is 192.168.. an internal IP, and not the machine that I want.
2008-09-25T06:09:00.000Z	pedro-orange	caio	Are you in the same subnet? What is the network setup?
