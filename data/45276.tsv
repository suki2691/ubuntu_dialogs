2010-01-19T22:38:00.000Z	fcuk112		i want to dual boot win7/karmic, i am planning to resize my win7 partition and install karmic on the free space.  do i still need to allocate swap if i have 8GB of RAM?
2010-01-19T22:39:00.000Z	llutz	fcuk112	you alwys can add swap-files later, if really needed
2010-01-19T22:40:00.000Z	fcuk112	llutz	does karmic automatically use a swap file?  or do you have to do some config?
2010-01-19T22:40:00.000Z	llutz	fcuk112	idk, i guess you have to do it manually
