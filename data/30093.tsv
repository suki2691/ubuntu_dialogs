2010-06-19T07:02:00.000Z	Joshua_Roberts		I am having an issue with flash in ubuntu 9.10 x64.  When I go to sites like armorgames.com to play online flash games, all I can see are the flash ads, I can't see the main panel which has the game selection
2010-06-19T07:04:00.000Z	Joshua_Roberts		figured out the flash problem.  I had flashblock addon installed in firefox.  I think I installed it at the same time I installed adblockplus
