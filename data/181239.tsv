2007-10-11T16:16:00.000Z	specialKevin		I was wondering if anybody knew how I could backport php5.2 from feisty to dapper
2007-10-11T16:17:00.000Z	specialKevin		currently dapper only has php5.1
2007-10-11T05:02:00.000Z	specialKevin		does anybody know where you can go to view the contents of actual .deb files, I want to see what flags are uses in creating the binary package of php for ubuntu
2007-10-11T05:02:00.000Z	bruenig	specialKevin	the deb is already binary so that is of no use, you would need the source and build script
