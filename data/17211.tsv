2011-09-23T01:03:00.000Z	Polah	ih20i	Here for Ubuntu, or #httpd, #php, #mysql for each part.
2011-09-23T01:05:00.000Z	Polah	ih20i	phpmyadmin you mean? Should be accessible through http://localhost/phpmyadmin if it's running
2011-09-23T01:05:00.000Z	Polah	ih20i	/var/www/phpmyadmin doesn't exist, but it should be there if you go through a browser
