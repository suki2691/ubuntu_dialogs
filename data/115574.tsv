2007-10-26T01:36:00.000Z	lhoerste		I have sun-java6-jdk installed but "javacc" is the only binary that i seem to have that starts with "java*"
2007-10-26T01:36:00.000Z	lhoerste		anyone know why this is?
2007-10-26T01:38:00.000Z	lhoerste		correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't sun-java6-jdk contain the "java" and "javac" binaries?
2007-10-26T01:39:00.000Z	Bonster	lhoerste	sun is all about java
