2008-06-09T17:32:00.000Z	dsmith1974		Hi all, I've been trying to install the Sun JRE onto Ubuntu 8.04 (tried through Synaptics package manager, and also from the Sun website), seems no matter what I try I cannot get a Java applet to display inside FF - any thoughts?  Thanks...
2008-06-09T17:34:00.000Z	dsmith1974		Does Ubuntu have a JRE enabled as default?
