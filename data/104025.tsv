2011-01-04T09:49:00.000Z	Amtrask		So I don't know if anyone cares, but for the past several versions of ubuntu here's been a glitch with the desktop-switching dealy (windows key + e). The panels persist to all the "virtual" desktops, even the active applications which should only be shown on one
2011-01-04T09:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Amtrask	is there a bug logged?
2011-01-04T09:52:00.000Z	Amtrask	ActionParsnip	Don't know, I don't even know which package that would concern
2011-01-04T09:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Amtrask	gnome-panel  if it's the panel which is at fault. You could also log a bug yourself and it may get marked as a dulpicate
