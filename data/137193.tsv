2007-12-01T01:57:00.000Z	Brucevdk		I just bought a new hard disk for my laptop, it's a Seagate Momentus (ATA) and after a few hours of house it's already up to 160 load cycles. I can hear the hard disk make a grinding noise once every minute and this increases the load cycle count. My previous disk only seemed to increase load cycles when restarting (or similliar). What could be the problem?
2007-12-01T01:59:00.000Z	Brucevdk		Think I might have found a new bug discussing this issue, jeez this is a scary problem. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/acpi-support/+bug/59695
