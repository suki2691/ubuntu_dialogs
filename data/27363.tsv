2010-10-14T16:12:00.000Z	sniperjo	jrib	ok, but its not exactly a widly known topic
2010-10-14T16:13:00.000Z	jrib	sniperjo	do you just care that people know something about it or are you going to ask the person that says "yes" a new question?  If you just ask your question to begin with, everyone wins
