2008-07-28T00:39:00.000Z	Entropy51423		I know that, but what can be determined from its output?
2008-07-28T00:39:00.000Z	Entropy51423		Okay, I have a wireless router in my room but the actual tower is in the office
2008-07-28T00:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Entropy51423	so what is the problem?... you can't get on the router w/ your laptop?
