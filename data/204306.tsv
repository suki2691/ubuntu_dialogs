2005-12-22T10:24:00.000Z	Subhuman		hi, this isnt really specific ubuntu, but its only happened to me in ubuntu, I'm using mplayer-plugin to watch videos in firefox, they work fine, BUT i cant seem to go fullscreen, it just keeps it 1:1 and adds a big black border, same thing in mplayer standalone, any ideas??

2005-12-22T10:28:00.000Z	Subhuman	_jason	thanks man, that fixed it in the standalone, still no joy with mplayer-plugin, but this is much better :D
