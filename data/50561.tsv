2009-08-12T22:13:00.000Z	harcoal	[manas]	open firefox and choose edit>preferences>advanced>network>setttings, then choose manual proxy, socks4 with the server set as localhost with port 9999
2009-08-12T22:15:00.000Z	[manas]	harcoal	ssh -D 446 zion@192.168.1.64 i did 446 what for i need to use 9999
2009-08-12T22:15:00.000Z	harcoal	[manas]	it's probably best to use a high port number like 9999 to be sure
