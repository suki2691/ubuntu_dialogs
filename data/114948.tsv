2008-04-28T06:28:00.000Z	joshhunt		I am having a small problem... I just installed 8.04 using wubi and everything appeared to go fine, except i cant figure out how to 'use' the nividia graphics driver. In the restricted drivers thing, it says the driver is loaded, but it isnt in use. When i go to enable compiz fusion via the appearance tool, it just tells methat it couldnt be loaded. How can i get this to all work?,
