2007-09-20T07:35:00.000Z	jrib	Jaggz-	what do you mean?
2007-09-20T07:37:00.000Z	jrib	Jaggz-	it's LTS (Long Term Support).  The next LTS will be 8.04 and you should be able to upgrade from 6.06 to 8.04.  But 6.06 is a bit old so if you need recent software, you should probably go with 7.04 and then upgrade each release
2007-09-20T07:38:00.000Z	jrib	Jaggz-	7.10 is due out in 2007 october, 8.04 in 2008 April (see the pattern :))
