2009-05-16T03:56:00.000Z	Whitor		Hi, anyone know of a program to let me see my ubuntu desktop from another location? like vnc, but what's on my local display ... ?
2009-05-16T03:56:00.000Z	Whitor		like how VNC works for windows
2009-05-16T03:57:00.000Z	Whitor		vnc acts differently in ubuntu ... it gives me a logon screen and a different desktop ...
