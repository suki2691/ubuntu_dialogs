2011-11-13T16:12:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	linda	for now it does, but in the future, it will be replaced by wayland
2011-11-13T16:13:00.000Z	linda	MonkeyDust	Yes I am looking forward to wayland. I love X but the fact that you do not have to monkey around in userland to talk to the kernel should give a huge speed increase.
