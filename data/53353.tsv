2009-07-01T00:17:00.000Z	alan205		i want to be able to use ctrl alt backspace but it is disabled according to the community documentation for 9.04. why would they do that and is there a way to enable it?
2009-07-01T00:18:00.000Z	jeffwheeler	alan205	it was probably disabled because it's such an easy way to accidentally lose lots of work
2009-07-01T00:19:00.000Z	alan205	jeffwheeler	youre likely right but it sure comes in handy
2009-07-01T00:19:00.000Z	jeffwheeler	alan205	I know, and I've had to use it before; but, personally, I hit it much more frequently by accident
