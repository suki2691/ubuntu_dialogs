2010-04-14T01:09:00.000Z	coventry		How can I diagnose a problem with slow screen refresh (like, it takes about 1s for firefox to repaint my screen on each movement in scrolling a page?)
2010-04-14T01:09:00.000Z	coventry		I don't like the default ubuntu desktop, so in the past I tended to start up a simple sawfish session in my ~/.xsession.  However, that required gdm-2.20 rather than the standard login manager; later versions don't run ~/.xsession.  I was making do with just going over to a virtual terminal, logging in, and running "startx -- :2", but now when I do that, I'm getting the slow screen refresh I just mentioned.
2010-04-14T01:10:00.000Z	maginot	coventry	why not just install the desktop and on gdm choose the one you want as default???
2010-04-14T01:11:00.000Z	coventry	maginot	I like to run sawfish.  I have been using it almost a decade and depend on it pretty heavily.  But it seems to be broken when I use it under the default ubuntu login.
