2011-01-27T08:52:00.000Z	Snakkah		Hi. My wireless connection is working fine, but my wired connection is not. "eth0" isn't even listed when I type ifconfig into the Terminal. Why did this happen and how do I get it to detect wired connections again?

2011-01-27T08:56:00.000Z	Snakkah	DaGeek247	did that. The Network Manager just won't detect wired connections at all.
