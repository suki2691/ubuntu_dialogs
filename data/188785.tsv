2006-06-17T07:05:00.000Z	khaladan		Hi, I have a bunch of files named blah-%.png where % is a number, and I'd like to list them in numerical order, so that blah-2 comes before blah-10 for example.  how can I do that?

2006-06-17T07:07:00.000Z	khaladan	Madpilot	i'd like to do it from the command line
