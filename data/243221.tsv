2005-04-08T11:02:00.000Z	folta		can someone help me out with this kernel configuration thing: i'm usimng menuconfig, and apparently as i'm using sata hard drives it's vital that the drivers for them are compiled into the kernel rather than loaded as modules: where do i check that?
2005-04-08T11:04:00.000Z	OrangeRoot1000	folta	it has been a while for me configuring a kernel... but the key in the graphical was the M switch
2005-04-08T11:04:00.000Z	OrangeRoot1000	folta	u dont want M in that case...
2005-04-08T11:04:00.000Z	folta	OrangeRoot1000	yup, i can see that, i'm just trying to find the right entry to set as * rather than M
