2010-10-19T16:54:00.000Z	slidinghorn	reqem	 how are you trying to open it, and what happens when you try?
2010-10-19T16:54:00.000Z	reqem	slidinghorn	i've tried both the keyboard shortcut and the application menu.
2010-10-19T16:56:00.000Z	reqem	slidinghorn	oh and it just opens for a millisecond and then appears to crash.
