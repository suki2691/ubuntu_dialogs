2009-05-28T22:01:00.000Z	CooPs89		My nvidia FX5200 give a black and white TV-Out output. How do I fix this? Please help. Been going at this for weeks. Using ubuntu 9.02
2009-05-28T22:03:00.000Z	joker_	CooPs89	I had that problem a few times. Once, it turned out to be a defective cable and an other time I had to set it (in the config) to use s-video out instead of rca (or whatever is the other option), even if it was in fact that option...

2009-05-28T22:04:00.000Z	joker_	CooPs89	I also read that a cable of an outstanding lenght OR lots of noise (read interference) could also cause that kind of problem.
