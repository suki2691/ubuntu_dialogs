2007-06-10T08:06:00.000Z	Brakkvatn		Hello. I am on feisty now. Is it safe for me to install the gutsy version 0.6 of libguichan0?
2007-06-10T08:08:00.000Z	Frogzoo_	Brakkvatn	nope, I wouldn't
2007-06-10T08:08:00.000Z	Brakkvatn	Frogzoo_	So what would be the best way to use a newer version of the library? To install it locally on my user instead?
2007-06-10T08:09:00.000Z	Frogzoo_	Brakkvatn	sure, and set LD_LIBRARY_PATH would work
