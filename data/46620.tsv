2009-10-01T12:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	baoji	you can use special tools to put the live CD direct onto a US disk so I dont see why not, you will need to do a lot of the stuff the installer does manually
2009-10-01T12:36:00.000Z	baoji	ActionParsnip1	thank you. Yes, I imagine so. Obviously I'll need to create a user, for example. But the idea is workable in practice?
