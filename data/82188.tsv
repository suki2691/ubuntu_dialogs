2008-08-15T23:00:00.000Z	jorggg	bytor4232	My LCD backlight starts at minimum when i boot up. I cant change it before I have loged into gnome. The backlight also turns low when I play a movie in mplayer for instance.
2008-08-15T23:01:00.000Z	jorggg	bytor4232	So Im wondering if there have been any changes to backlight in hardy, cause it worked fine in gutsy
