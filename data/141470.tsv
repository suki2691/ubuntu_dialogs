2007-04-10T10:20:00.000Z	hans0lo		I just created a DVD Video with dvdauthor. How do I burn that to DVD? Just drag the folder over to a blank? Or do I need some DVD burning app to write it properly?

2007-04-10T10:21:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	hans0lo	there might be gnome-based CD burning tools that'll do it too, but personally I like k3b.
2007-04-10T10:21:00.000Z	hans0lo	SlimeyPete	Ok, thanks. I'd rather not have KDE libs taking up space for just one app if I don't have to.
