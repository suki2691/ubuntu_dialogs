2011-02-06T04:51:00.000Z	UberNewbie		Can anyone tell me how to make a dual boot configuration without trashing my host OS?  I want to install ubuntu in another partition or a USB device
2011-02-06T04:52:00.000Z	psusi	UberNewbie	then chose the side by side option when installing
2011-02-06T04:54:00.000Z	UberNewbie	psusi	 and Jordan_U:  I didn't see that option when I was installing it in a VB
2011-02-06T04:54:00.000Z	psusi	UberNewbie	probably because you didn't have anything to install beside.
