2007-01-03T11:05:00.000Z	xtknight		this is really pushing me over the edge.
2007-01-03T11:05:00.000Z	xtknight		accompanied by random freezes, any ideas?  [ 7372.794222]  hdf: cdrom_pc_intr: The drive appears confused (ireason = 0x01). Trying to recover by ending request.
2007-01-03T11:07:00.000Z	xtknight		how do i permanently remove a module from the kernel? ide_cd keeps coming back and my jmicron controller is giving me hell so im trying to remove it for now to avoid freezes.  i put it in blacklist_pata, worked first time but now its coming back again.
2007-01-03T11:08:00.000Z	[shroom] 	xtknight	delete the module. :)
