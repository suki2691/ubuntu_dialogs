2009-09-11T18:47:00.000Z	SixtyFold		Does it let you change between windows and Ubuntu in windows or is it like a dual boot?
2009-09-11T18:48:00.000Z	IdleOne	SixtyFold	it's like a dual boot
2009-09-11T18:58:00.000Z	IdleOne	SixtyFold	as I understand it wubi uses the windows boot loader and it should give you the choice on boot
