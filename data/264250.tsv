2005-11-06T08:36:00.000Z	Welly		hey all.. going to uninstall evolution. when i select it for complete removal, it lists ubuntu-desktop as a package that will be removed too
2005-11-06T08:36:00.000Z	Welly		is this wise?
2005-11-06T08:37:00.000Z	topyli	Welly	ubuntu-desktop is just a virtual package. no worries
2005-11-06T08:39:00.000Z	topyli	Welly	it contains no files, it just depends on other packages. it just helps to install a default set of desktop applications
