2007-08-31T10:55:00.000Z	cn	Pici	those documents are useless to me. If i've setup a RAID array in the intel bootable configurators... then when I get to the partition part of ubuntu installation, shouldnt it show 1 disk rather than 2? (there are 2 physicals)
2007-08-31T10:56:00.000Z	Pici	cn	I'm sorry. Unfortunately, the only experience I have with raid is saying !raid.  If I knew more I'd be more than happy to help you.
