2006-11-07T07:01:00.000Z	secretum		just stating
2006-11-07T07:03:00.000Z	secretum		I am testing the live cd right now, both edgy and dapper, but I have a problem.  Edgy will not let me switch to my normal resolution, 1280x1024, where dapper lets me.  I was wondering if I installed Edgy, would it make me use 1024x768, or is there a fix?
2006-11-07T07:04:00.000Z	Toma-	secretum	the live cd is fairly limited with resolutions.
