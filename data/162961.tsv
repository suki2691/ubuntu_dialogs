2011-07-06T09:23:00.000Z	mrdeb		only if they are ignorant

2011-07-06T09:25:00.000Z	vexati0n	mrdeb	i'm all for overcoming that ignorance, but the FOSS community should face the fact that they have lost the battle over the word Linux. none of the successfull linux-based products out there say "Linux" anywhere but in very tiny print at the back of a technical manual nobody will ever read.
