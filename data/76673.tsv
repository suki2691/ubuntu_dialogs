2008-10-23T02:33:00.000Z	Slart	pedrobroet	I think there's a utility in gnome for joysticks.. gnome-jstick or something like that
2008-10-23T02:34:00.000Z	Slart	pedrobroet	hmm.. I didn't find it when I searched in synaptic.. but there are lots of other joystick utils available
2008-10-23T02:34:00.000Z	pedrobroet	Slart	thanks, I'll check it
