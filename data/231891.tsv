2008-03-01T21:48:00.000Z	fbc		HI guys, I'm helping integrate ubuntu into a school here in Mexico. All of their students projects are written in php4 and I cannot find a lamp installation in synaptics for php4. any ideas?
2008-03-01T21:48:00.000Z	ffm	fbc	just install apache, mysql, and php4, and ubuntu autoconfigures it.
2008-03-01T21:48:00.000Z	ffm	fbc	or just have them use php5.
