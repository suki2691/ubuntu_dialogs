2009-01-12T23:00:00.000Z	ezerhoden_	recon69	1st guess would be to see if they are muted. alsamixer maybe
2009-01-12T23:02:00.000Z	ezerhoden_	recon69	ok. so, is it muted ?
2009-01-12T23:04:00.000Z	recon69	ezerhoden_	I got Master(100%) PCM(100%) Front(100%) Front (0% muted) Line-in(0% muted) cd(80%) PC Speaker(0%)
