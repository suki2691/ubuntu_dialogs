2008-08-01T17:46:00.000Z	Leefmc		Question: How do i find compiz shortcuts? I believe Super+V and Super+C are being used by compiz, but i want it to be used by Amarok. The problem is i dont know _which_ compiz feature is using it

2008-08-01T17:56:00.000Z	Leefmc	dns53	Can you suggest any compiz features that would cause these two? Super+V seems to make the window full size (not maximized.. just resized to full), and Super+C centers my mouse. Super+V is not controlled by the "Resize" feature in compiz.. or so it seems, i dont see anything bound to Super+V
