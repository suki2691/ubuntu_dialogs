2010-05-16T06:31:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad		is it possible to add GRUB2 to my GRUB menu, so i can optionally use one or the other? <-- saying again, because it got pushed up to the area of no reading
2010-05-16T06:33:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad		i want to add an option to boot GRUB2 as a secondary bootloader, to possibly boot a loopback for my ISO of ubuntu 10.04
