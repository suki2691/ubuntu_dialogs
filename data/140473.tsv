2007-04-22T14:20:00.000Z	Amon-san		hi, i had a dual boot system WinXP and Ubuntu 6.10 running. when i upgraded t 7.04 it ruined my grub entries so that i had to rewrite my MBR to be able to boot up my system. is that a known issue?
2007-04-22T14:20:00.000Z	Amon-san		as part of the MBR rewriting my system no longer sees grub
