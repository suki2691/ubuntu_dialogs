2006-08-14T10:55:00.000Z	LazyAngel		i need to reinstall windows on my dual boot. I know its going to break ubuntu. But how much? Can i start from a livecd and setup grub again?
2006-08-14T10:56:00.000Z	scrappy_	LazyAngel	what partition is ubuntu on?
2006-08-14T10:57:00.000Z	LazyAngel	scrappy_	ubuntu is on a separate disk. /boot is on /hda1 (And thats where the boot flag is) Windows will go on /hda2
