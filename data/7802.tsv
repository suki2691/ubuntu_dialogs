2011-11-21T04:53:00.000Z	anadon		I'm having trouble getting minecraft to run.  Ideas?  It looks as if firefox can't run java, but it is installed.
2011-11-21T04:54:00.000Z	brjannc	anadon	can you run it from the command line?
2011-11-21T04:56:00.000Z	anadon	brjannc	I'm trying the classic trial on their website; its not available for command line use without some hacks.
2011-11-21T04:57:00.000Z	brjannc	anadon	Ah, I understand; can't help you then, I'm no good with the java + browser mess
