2008-11-07T18:50:00.000Z	chadeldridge	SOURdiesel	do you have the vnc viewer installed for the remote desktop viewer or is the option grayed out ?
2008-11-07T18:52:00.000Z	chadeldridge	SOURdiesel	sudo apt-get install xvncviewer
2008-11-07T18:53:00.000Z	SOURdiesel	chadeldridge	i'm on hardy now.  remote viewer tries to connect but tells me host not accepting.  terminal server client connects.
