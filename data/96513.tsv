2008-03-28T05:48:00.000Z	jetscreamer	ChameleonDave	it's bad to tell you to do sudo su then change pw.. so i won't tell you
2008-03-28T05:50:00.000Z	ChameleonDave	jetscreamer	Are you sure that works?  I already have a root password, but that doesn make Ubuntu allow an actual login into a desktop environment
2008-03-28T05:59:00.000Z	jetscreamer	ChameleonDave	that's different, edit gdm.conf or use the login manager config in the login screen (if it's there in ubuntu)
