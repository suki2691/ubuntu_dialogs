2004-10-16T09:47:00.000Z	FX|Laptop		Anyone give me a hand again. :) I know that kde isn't really supported, but I'm trying to burn an iso with k3b and the setup won't take my root password. Any ideas?
2004-10-16T09:47:00.000Z	FX|Laptop		Yea I set root's password, but I'll try that running k3b as sudo once and see what happens.
2004-10-16T09:47:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	FX|Laptop	using sudo is recommended
