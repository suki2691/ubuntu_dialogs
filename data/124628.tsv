2007-09-19T11:43:00.000Z	rothchild		Hi what's the effect in Gnome called where the windows slide around each other when selected (rather than snapping forwards / back) I've turned it off somehow and don't know if it was a compiz or metacity thing?
2007-09-19T11:45:00.000Z	rothchild		compiz with metacity decoration - I've just come over from Kubuntu so I'm still finding my way around a bit
2007-09-19T11:46:00.000Z	rothchild		so it's a compiz thing then I take it, ok thanks
