2011-03-25T04:48:00.000Z	Rodolfo		Im not having a good experience with ati radeon hd 4200 series using the open driver
2011-03-25T04:48:00.000Z	Rodolfo		is it from the comm or amd?
2011-03-25T04:48:00.000Z	critical_max	Rodolfo	you should try the ATI official driver
2011-03-25T04:48:00.000Z	critical_max	Rodolfo	System > Administration > Hardware Drivers and choose the restricted/official driver
