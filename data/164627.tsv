2007-07-07T08:44:00.000Z	K`zan		Can anyone find vmware-server in adept?  I just had to reinstall from scratch and the repository manager is completely different now and I can't find that.  TIA!
2007-07-07T08:44:00.000Z	Vuen	K`zan	doesn't vmware-server cost money? i don't think it's in the repositories...
2007-07-07T08:44:00.000Z	K`zan	Vuen	There is a freebie version now.  Until something got screwed up and I had to do a wipe/reinstall I found it.
