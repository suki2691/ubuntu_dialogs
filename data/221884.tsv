2008-12-01T14:28:00.000Z	bthornton		I'm running Ubuntu Hardy and just downloaded the alternate Intrepid CD image (same arch) with the intention of upgrading Hardy to Intrepid from the CD. Is that possible?
2008-12-01T14:29:00.000Z	aftertaf	bthornton	yes... use 'sudo apt-cdrom add'
2008-12-01T14:29:00.000Z	aftertaf	bthornton	or in synaptic, add the cd rom to list
2008-12-01T14:29:00.000Z	bthornton	aftertaf	and then do a dist-upgrade?
