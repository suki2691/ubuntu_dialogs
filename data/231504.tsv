2007-11-05T00:29:00.000Z	johnation33		this is what I mean by full permissions on a mounted volume: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2107144#post2107144 Only except, the mounted volume is not FAT32 but Ext3
2007-11-05T00:29:00.000Z	johnation33		so how would I do it for Ext3?

2007-11-05T00:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	johnation33	 ive seen this asked befor.. If theres a way to 'override' them - ive never seen anyone mention it. I normally make a single dir on the volume and let the user i want  have full permission./ownership of that dir.
