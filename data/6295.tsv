2012-05-04T12:07:00.000Z	pvh_sa		hey there, there seems to be a problem between winff and ffmpeg on 12.04. the presets in winff don'twork with the supplied version of ffmpeg. anyone else having this?
2012-05-04T12:07:00.000Z	zykotic10	pvh_sa	all presets or presets for MP4?
2012-05-04T12:08:00.000Z	pvh_sa	zykotic10	the presents for DVD are off (use a -mv0 argument that doesn't work)
2012-05-04T12:09:00.000Z	zykotic10	pvh_sa	sorry was just asking about MP4 specifically.  Don't know about other issues with ffmpeg, good luck.
