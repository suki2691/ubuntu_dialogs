2008-11-16T10:35:00.000Z	fryguy	almostdvs	what is in the configuration options is what is available for the plugin, there's no hidden features.  The answer to your question is yes, it's right in the configuration
2008-11-16T10:37:00.000Z	almostdvs	fryguy	then maybe the terminology is what is tripping me up, what is that option?
2008-11-16T10:37:00.000Z	fryguy	almostdvs	no idea, and i don't have a compiz install in front of me to check
