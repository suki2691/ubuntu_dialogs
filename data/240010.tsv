2006-05-01T05:51:00.000Z	christianpiper		Hello-- Does anybody know if it is possible to install libcario1 on dapper? I am trying to get Dr Queue installed...
2006-05-01T05:53:00.000Z	christianpiper		On DAPPER? Really? Cause the .Deb installer said it couldn't fix the dependency- and apt-get install libcario1 didn't find the package....
2006-05-01T05:54:00.000Z	nickrud	christianpiper	try libcairo2
2006-05-01T05:55:00.000Z	nickrud	christianpiper	but dapper questions should be in #ubuntu+1
