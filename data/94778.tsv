2008-04-13T14:13:00.000Z	bazhang	parthibls	there is a reason that there is a seperate channel for Hardy; and it is not because the admins are big meanies--it is a different system and answers you get here may likely bork your system there
2008-04-13T14:21:00.000Z	parthibls	bazhang	k tnx........sorry
2008-04-13T14:21:00.000Z	bazhang	parthibls	no one wants the two channels to merge more than me--only 13 days to go ;]
