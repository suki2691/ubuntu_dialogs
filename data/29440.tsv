2010-08-26T05:47:00.000Z	razz1	TiK	uses the existing one, for a virtualX session most recommended one is NX, but the freenx package is broken when i tried it last time. You can also use vncserver to create one. look at this http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Remote_Access_to_the_Ubuntu_Linux_Desktop, at the bottom
