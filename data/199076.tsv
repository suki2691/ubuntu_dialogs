2007-09-05T08:10:00.000Z	Frogzoo	yigal	gnuplot is extensively documented
2007-09-05T08:10:00.000Z	yigal	Frogzoo	yes, but trying to real time rotate a multiplot is not, and is rather challenging
2007-09-05T08:11:00.000Z	yigal	Frogzoo	it, only rotates the last graph, and forces, reishuing the gnuplot commands to redraw the total plot, I would prefer not to have to do this
