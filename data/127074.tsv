2008-09-14T08:56:00.000Z	vocx	buono	don't know exactly, but the log may list them somewhere around /var/log/apt
2008-09-14T09:01:00.000Z	vocx	buono	I think the packages that are installed by default can be browsed from the Ubuntu CD.
2008-09-14T09:03:00.000Z	vocx	buono	well, you would use something like a shell script to list and compare files, I don't know.
