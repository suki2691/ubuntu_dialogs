2006-06-12T15:41:00.000Z	fr77be		I have changed my resolution. It worked perfect!!, but I want to do it also in Ubuntu 64 bit, can I have the terminal command again.
2006-06-12T15:42:00.000Z	fr77be		does anyone know the comment for changing the resolution manually
2006-06-12T15:42:00.000Z	fr77be		xserver or so?
2006-06-12T15:43:00.000Z	afabian	fr77be	I never knew of any command to manually change the resolution of a running X server.  cntrl-alt-+ and cntrl-alt-minus cycle through pre-configured resolutions in the xorg.conf, though
