2009-02-11T23:56:00.000Z	MassterJedi		My First question is: I have a Multi-core Machine. Namely an Intel Dual core. More Specifically an Intel 630. Will the Ubuntu Installer recognize the dual Core? Or Do I have to recompile it for the use of Multi-Cores?

2009-02-11T23:57:00.000Z	xaos11	MassterJedi	NO you don't need to recompile
