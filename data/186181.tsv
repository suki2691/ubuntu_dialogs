2006-05-14T07:45:00.000Z	miRaGe		I am using an Ubuntu live-cd in order to retrieve files off of an NTFS hard drive so that it can be transferred to an OSX based PC.  What is the easiest and most efficient method to do this??

2006-05-14T07:47:00.000Z	miRaGe	Warbo	I tried that, it only shows a small section of the files on the OSX machine (100/350mb)
