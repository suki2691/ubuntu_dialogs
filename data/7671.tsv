2012-02-28T15:26:00.000Z	theadmin	georgieee	nautilus --no-default-window
2012-02-28T15:28:00.000Z	georgieee	theadmin	thanks!
2012-02-28T15:29:00.000Z	theadmin	georgieee	np. The opposite of this command is "nautilus --no-desktop" by the way (start the filemanager, but don't attempt to manage the desktop)
