2010-03-27T09:30:00.000Z	EPAstor		Having an odd issue in Lucid beta - mouse & keyboard are unable to change window in focus, including to the GNOME menus. Problem is new - started after updating packages today. Any thoughts?
2010-03-27T09:30:00.000Z	EPAstor		More details are posted in a thread on the Lucid forums, but I was wondering if anyone here was interested.
