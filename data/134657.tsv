2009-11-14T10:24:00.000Z	usser_	lstarnes	i personally found virtualbox to be just as enterprise ready as vmware server
2009-11-14T10:25:00.000Z	lstarnes	ironsight	which edition of virtualbox?
2009-11-14T10:25:00.000Z	usser_	lstarnes	the command line tools to control VMs in virtualbox are awesome. couple that with a small distro and ssh server and you almost got yourself a hypervisor :)
