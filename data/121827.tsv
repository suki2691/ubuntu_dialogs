2008-11-02T12:51:00.000Z	Dibblah		Hi. Silly question re RAID. I have RAID arrays, configured during installation. At 1:00 this morning, something appears to have launched a "check" against the arrays. Is this something Ubuntu is doing?
2008-11-02T12:53:00.000Z	Dibblah		Okay. That's a 'yes', then.  cron.d/mdadm -- schedules periodic redundancy checks of MD devices
