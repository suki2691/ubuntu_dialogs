2009-05-08T05:25:00.000Z	SHELDOMINGO		Hi, my dell with intel graphics using ubuntu 9.04 is lags terribly and also the compiz does not work either, everything was so smooth in 8.04 is the intel chips black listed again?
2009-05-08T05:27:00.000Z	usser	SHELDOMINGO	some chips are blacklisted yes, my gma965 is, but gm915 is not
2009-05-08T05:28:00.000Z	SHELDOMINGO	usser	would this problem be fixed in the near future? or should I just go back to 8.04
2009-05-08T05:29:00.000Z	usser	SHELDOMINGO	i doubt it, there wont be any major updates once released, and intel problem is major one, they practically rewrote the entire driver, you may want to check backports repository to see if theres anything there
