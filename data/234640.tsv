2007-04-05T12:55:00.000Z	jiphex		how come my feisty system pauses on boot up every time to fsck one of the discs?
2007-04-05T12:56:00.000Z	dooglus	jiphex	because it never powers down cleanly maybe?
2007-04-05T12:56:00.000Z	dooglus	jiphex	I remember when dapper was in beta it would always power off before umounting the root partition
2007-04-05T12:56:00.000Z	dooglus	jiphex	I reported a bug, but the ubuntu devs can be a little slow at times fixing things
