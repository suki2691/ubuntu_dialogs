2011-03-04T05:38:00.000Z	manoot-home		I'm interested in moving to a fully linux environment for Rails 3 coding, and was wondering which Ubuntu flavor i should go with? 10.04 or 10.10?
2011-03-04T05:38:00.000Z	manoot-home		should i stick with LTS until the next LTS comes out for coding purposes?
2011-03-04T05:39:00.000Z	manoot-home		thanks crimson figured as much just don't have much experience with debian/ubuntu. mostly CentOS
2011-03-04T05:40:00.000Z	Aikar	manoot-home	as a dev id prolly suggest 10.10, isnt LTS locked to only security updates? 10.10 will give you more up to date apps
