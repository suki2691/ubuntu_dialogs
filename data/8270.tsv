2011-11-02T01:57:00.000Z	B0g4r7		I ran Update Manager on my one Lucid vm that hasn't been updated in a while, and it downloaded like 280 updated packages, but 9 of the downloads failed with 404 errors.
2011-11-02T01:57:00.000Z	B0g4r7		Is it OK to let it "continue" or will those missing packages cause a problem?

2011-11-02T02:00:00.000Z	riffautae	B0g4r7	I dont know that its a good idea to do that, you might try again later or change which mirror you are using
