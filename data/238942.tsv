2005-12-03T10:26:00.000Z	boa-chan		i installed sshd, i just don't know how to run it. can annyone lend me a hand.
2005-12-03T10:27:00.000Z	indigirl1	boa-chan	there must be a tutorial for that. also look in /usr/share/doc/sshd for help.
2005-12-03T10:28:00.000Z	indigirl1	boa-chan	and maybe there is a sshd-doc package for more documentation
2005-12-03T10:29:00.000Z	indigirl1	boa-chan	apt-get install sshd-doc     if that package exists
