2010-04-27T21:38:00.000Z	Prathmesh		I have a decision to make and quick. Someone plz give me some good advise. Should I wait and try to solve problem with Kubuntu 9.10 or should I format and Install Ubuntu 8.04 LTS ?
2010-04-27T21:39:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Prathmesh	what is your major concern?
2010-04-27T21:39:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Prathmesh	if you created a mistake and you want to re-install, I don't blame you.
