2005-11-27T17:32:00.000Z	Anon|Away	Absenth	Plays it for me. I just use "Open Location"
2005-11-27T17:32:00.000Z	Anon|Away		It won't open it by clicking on the URL, but if you copy the URL and paste it in the "Open Location" dialogue in the gui, it works for me
2005-11-27T17:32:00.000Z	Absenth	Anon|Away	 I'm attempting to listen to a local radio station via the web.  I'm not sure I know what the address I need to connect to is.
