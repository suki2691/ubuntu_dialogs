2007-06-28T06:52:00.000Z	Beau		Hey guys. I installed Pidgin from a .deb but it won't let me connect to MSN. Any ideas?
2007-06-28T06:52:00.000Z	kitche	Beau	probably MSN messing around with their servers but pidgin has a bug about it I believe at least they did a few weeks ago
2007-06-28T06:53:00.000Z	kitche	Beau	yep it's still up there about MSN
2007-06-28T06:53:00.000Z	kitche	Beau	it's MSN server playing with protcols and such it happens all the time
