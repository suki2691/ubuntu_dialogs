2009-03-19T19:38:00.000Z	noobuntu	killindillin	thanks. i've been working through the forums, tried various solutions but for the life of me i can't get my usb wireless adapter to work.
2009-03-19T19:41:00.000Z	noobuntu	killindillin	great. the install went fine. however i have no internet access and i can't transfer files using a usb stick, so have wasted numerous cd's trying to get my wifi to work.
