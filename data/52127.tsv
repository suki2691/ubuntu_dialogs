2009-07-23T00:40:00.000Z	VisitorQ	bot10	hmm.. I got it running on a GF4 Ti 4200 (legacy driver) with the settings so that I got one big desktop stretching over VGA monitor and the TV... Not a separate X screen
2009-07-23T00:47:00.000Z	VisitorQ	bot10	I dont know how to fix... in my experience it just takes half an hour or so of trying some different settings.
