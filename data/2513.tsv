2012-08-08T23:15:00.000Z	Supermicro		Hello! Just installed Ubuntu and linux in general for the first time. Followed every tutorial and guide to set the fresh install and everything runs perfectly except fan keeps spinning on and off every 5-8 sec and both cpu and hdd run much much hotter. I've been reading and searching for problem whole afternoon..:( tried also mint 13 and xubuntu 12.04... but same problems occured. someone please help or point in right direction
