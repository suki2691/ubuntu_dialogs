2011-08-13T19:29:00.000Z	ElTimo		I keep running into a problem with wubi. Whenever I try to run it from a CD, it feels the need to redownload the iso.
2011-08-13T19:30:00.000Z	ElTimo		I have limited bandwidth, so this simply isn't an option for me.

2011-08-13T19:32:00.000Z	ElTimo	BluesKaj	I figured since it's included on the LiveCD it would use the local files though.
