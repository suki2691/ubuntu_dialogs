2007-02-12T14:17:00.000Z	modisch		Hey folks.  Since the recent update, i haven't been able to get Beryl and Xgl to work.  I looked around and found how to revert beryl, but i'm still unable to get direct rendering to work under Xgl
2007-02-12T14:18:00.000Z	modisch		Direct rendering is fine under the normal xorg gnome session... but under Xgl, i get an error with XFree86-DRI missing on the display
