2008-03-04T03:33:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32		I have a tricky network question: I have a small web site, but don't want to pay for a commercial internet connection.
2008-03-04T03:34:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32		my ISP won't give me a static ip for my residential connection
2008-03-04T03:35:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32		the public dhcp lease I get from the ISP says it doesnt expire until 2036, but I've seen it expire about every few days.
