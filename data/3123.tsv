2012-05-15T05:09:00.000Z	GSF1200S_		Whats up with all these spammers? Has this become the norm on this channel?

2012-05-15T05:10:00.000Z	GSF1200S_	Luceo	yeah, I suppose- it was popular before though and I dont remember seeing such types of spam here
2012-05-15T05:11:00.000Z	Luceo	GSF1200S_	idk, I never see it in other Linux channels, leads me to believe its just because Ubuntu is popular (and thus, near the top of the list)
