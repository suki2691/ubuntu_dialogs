2004-11-18T12:30:00.000Z	Kabalk		would you suggest ubuntu over debian?
2004-11-18T12:30:00.000Z	lt_kije	Kabalk	it depends on what you want to do.
2004-11-18T12:30:00.000Z	lt_kije	Kabalk	ubuntu is really great for desktop use -- it's incredibly well designed and easy to use
2004-11-18T12:31:00.000Z	lt_kije	Kabalk	i've used debian for about 3 years and I liked it alot, but ubuntu is a more...complete desktop solution
