2007-07-03T11:05:00.000Z	hjmills	natbet	the official adobe pdf reader for something heavier than evince, or g/k/xpdf?
2007-07-03T11:06:00.000Z	natbet	hjmills	evince uses up too much of my processor, I just want something simple to view pdfs
2007-07-03T11:06:00.000Z	hjmills	natbet	try gpdf or xpdf on gnome then maybe
