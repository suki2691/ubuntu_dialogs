2010-06-27T03:15:00.000Z	forge_		so I just burned my self a lubuntu live CD and am tring it out but I tried the disk check and it said it had one defect but it still is running fine so far in the live CD what do you guys think
2010-06-27T03:15:00.000Z	forge_		Do you think I should just try to install with the disk or make a new one
2010-06-27T03:16:00.000Z	SlidingHorn	forge_	in *my* humble opinion, you should probably make a new disk with no defects...i think it'd be asking for trouble otherwise
2010-06-27T03:16:00.000Z	forge_	SlidingHorn	yeah your right why mess something up from the start
