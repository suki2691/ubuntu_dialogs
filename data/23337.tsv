2010-10-30T10:57:00.000Z	Loshki	BlackJamMan	then my advice is to live with it till your sysadmin shows up....
2010-10-30T10:58:00.000Z	BlackJamMan	Loshki	the email I was looking for didn't show up though, so the other people's mail must be junk.
2010-10-30T11:00:00.000Z	Loshki	BlackJamMan	emails do sometimes get lost. And I wouldn't assume anything about the state of other people's mail files....
