2008-07-08T21:34:00.000Z	elmer		Let's say I have a folder full of FLACs and MP3s. Is there a way to copy them into folders named "Artist - Album" based on their tags?

2008-07-08T21:35:00.000Z	hlfshell		As well as play them.
2008-07-08T21:35:00.000Z	elmer	hlfshell	cool. Now all I have to do is re-get amarok.
