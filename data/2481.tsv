2012-06-13T23:23:00.000Z	Limpalot	SkippersBoss	I don't know, will that hold across reboots and different monitors?
2012-06-13T23:25:00.000Z	SkippersBoss	Limpalot	you could always drop the command line somewhere. I have it on a launcher for en/disabling and positioning a monitor
2012-06-13T23:50:00.000Z	Limpalot	SkippersBoss	xrandr in a script works like a charm, thank you very much!
