2009-09-20T12:20:00.000Z	gac1		Hi does anyone one know how safe it is to download security updates from Update Manager that are not "authenticated"
2009-09-20T12:21:00.000Z	gac1		I get a message about unauthenticated software
2009-09-20T12:22:00.000Z	lstarnes	gac1	it depends on which repository it comes from
2009-09-20T12:23:00.000Z	lstarnes	gac1	if they're from official ubuntu repositories on official ubuntu mirrors, they are generally safe
