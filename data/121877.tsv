2007-09-13T15:04:00.000Z	enoj		How can I access "Network places" I have added in open/save-dialogs etc?
2007-09-13T15:04:00.000Z	xtknight	enoj	click them on left side, bottom of list ?
2007-09-13T15:08:00.000Z	enoj	xtknight	what about dialogs for KDE apps (doesn't have the network tab) .. I'm using quanta+ for development, because i cant find a good IDE for python/php/html
2007-09-13T15:08:00.000Z	xtknight	enoj	ah i have no idea bout kde.  i doubt if it detects gnome 'places'.  but kompozer (upcoming? maybe already here?) might  be good for html/web design
