2008-03-14T00:44:00.000Z	largos		I need some pointers on debugging an audio problem in Ubuntu Gutsy -- it acts just as if the speakers were not plugged in.  aplay -l and some /dev stats are up here: http://pastebin.com/d55e03307
2008-03-14T00:44:00.000Z	largos		I've checked the alsamixer settings, and nothing input-related is muted, or set very low
