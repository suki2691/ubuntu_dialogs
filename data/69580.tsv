2012-03-02T17:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	samba35	it works on my small eeepc but I think it's too big and bloated to be used on something like a phone like adroid
2012-03-02T17:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	samba35	eeepc is just a small notebook computer
2012-03-02T17:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	samba35	but android is linux and much like debian/ubuntu
