2008-05-29T18:56:00.000Z	QUILz		Why can't I use networkmanager to change the channel/frequency on my wireless card? :/
2008-05-29T18:57:00.000Z	danbhfive	QUILz	I think the channel is set by the hub, not the card
2008-05-29T18:58:00.000Z	QUILz	danbhfive	I'm aware, but if I change the channel on the hub, my card won't find it. And I need to change the channel because there are about 4 APs around here...
