2008-04-24T21:19:00.000Z	jtravnick		somebody asked a while ago this question and i havnt seen an answer Will a fresh install and an upgrade produce the same hardy or will there be diferences?
2008-04-24T21:20:00.000Z	eternal_p	jtravnick	personally, I don not like upgraded OSs, that is just me, but apparently people have been upgrading ubuntu since 5 and have been happy, so ymmv
2008-04-24T21:20:00.000Z	eternal_p	jtravnick	that is why I always recommend doing a seperate /home partition, easy upgrades
2008-04-24T21:22:00.000Z	jtravnick	eternal_p	comeing from fedora world i also usaly do fresh installs but figured id try an upgrade on the laptop just to see how it went
