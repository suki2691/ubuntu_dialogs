2005-10-17T16:50:00.000Z	graeme		I deleted the index.html in a directory so that index.php would take over... and now apache is sending me index.html still, but with the mimetype "application/x-trash"
2005-10-17T16:50:00.000Z	graeme		does rm move things to the trash now?
2005-10-17T16:51:00.000Z	nalioth	graeme	nope, rm removes forever
2005-10-17T16:52:00.000Z	nalioth	graeme	gnome and kde maintain their own trash files/directories
