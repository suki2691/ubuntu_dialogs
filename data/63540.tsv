2010-08-11T12:46:00.000Z	pinPoint		my ubuntu desktop has hang. All I see is the mouse but my terminals continue to function
2010-08-11T12:46:00.000Z	pinPoint		what could be wrong?
2010-08-11T12:48:00.000Z	pinPoint		is there a way to restart gnome other than Ctrl+Alt+backspace??
2010-08-11T12:49:00.000Z	swoody	pinPoint	switch to tty1 (Ctrl+Alt+F1) and run: sudo service gdm restart (or stop or start)
