2010-03-30T08:48:00.000Z	mortici	SwimmingRat	so you have a VIA KM400 series video card
2010-03-30T08:56:00.000Z	mortici	SwimmingRat	hold on lemme check what the command was to keep a active view of dmesg, so you can see when the system locks if your getting a kernel panic error.
2010-03-30T08:56:00.000Z	mortici	SwimmingRat	when it locks do you get all three flashing lights (cap lock, num lock, scroll lock) or you tap cap lock and the light doesn't turn on or off?
