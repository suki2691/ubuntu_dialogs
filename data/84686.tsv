2008-09-03T02:16:00.000Z	gonzojive_	lifewithryan	That command succeeded but it looks like the client is still frozen
2008-09-03T02:19:00.000Z	lifewithryan	gonzojive_	you can always do an "init 6" from the ssh shell to restart the box, but again, you'll be logged out of ssh that way
2008-09-03T02:20:00.000Z	gonzojive_	lifewithryan	yes, I'm just trying to avoid restarting because it's a live server
