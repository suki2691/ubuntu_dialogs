2009-08-15T09:55:00.000Z	MrAlexandro		i might have gotten this wrong, but can i install ubuntu on a SD card 4 to 8 gb of size and expect a fast stable performance?
2009-08-15T09:56:00.000Z	firecrotch	MrAlexandro	performance will largely depend on your SD card reader
2009-08-15T09:57:00.000Z	MrAlexandro	firecrotch	aha:D thought so!
2009-08-15T10:01:00.000Z	MrAlexandro	firecrotch	but will i be able to launch that sd on most new computers? lets say i make the installation and create two parittion on the sd card, will that be a pocket installation? cause drivers are already well integrated in the ubuntu release. do you understand my quesiton?
