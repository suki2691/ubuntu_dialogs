Alpha/beta versions; I just wonder whether my Nokia cellphone running SYMBIAN O.S. 9.4 will be compatible or if there is an earlier version of it already available so I can give it a try. Anyone knows something about this?

2011-11-23T03:14:00.000Z	celthunder	_Rod2k	did you check xda for your phone ? usually if your phone has any following someone has a port of it
2011-11-23T03:28:00.000Z	_Rod2k	celthunder	Do you have any other website?
