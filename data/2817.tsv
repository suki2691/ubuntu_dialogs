2012-09-07T07:15:00.000Z	Dougie187		Hi all, can anyone tell me if it's possible to get what is essentially an "ls" for a website?
2012-09-07T07:15:00.000Z	Dougie187		basically, I want to mirror files on a website
2012-09-07T07:16:00.000Z	Phiscribe	Dougie187	get a spider or crawler or do something clever with wget
2012-09-07T07:16:00.000Z	Dougie187	Phiscribe	ok, so what if I know all of the files end in a specific extension, and I only want to download new ones?
