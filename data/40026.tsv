2010-01-18T05:19:00.000Z	apipkin		i know this isn't support for adobe air, but when i sudo sh ./AdobeAIRInstaller.bin i get a Syntax error: "(" unexpected. not sure if i'm trying to install it incorrectly or if it's a problem with the software

2010-01-18T05:21:00.000Z	apipkin	erUSUL	didn't seem to do anything
2010-01-18T05:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	apipkin	no problem
