2011-08-02T15:29:00.000Z	Incarus6	livingdaylight	try to start Ubuntu Classic before playing around with testdisk
2011-08-02T15:30:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Incarus6	tried that already. Same issue, although less flickering of Desktop than Unity and icons on Desktop are stable, Otherwise all is the same in respect to being able to access files or applications
2011-08-02T15:31:00.000Z	Incarus6	livingdaylight	can you access files the non-graphical way (ctrl+alt+F1)?
