2009-01-18T17:50:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Zta	 ive seen such a tool.. but i forget what it was called. 'xdialog' or similer perhaps
2009-01-18T17:51:00.000Z	Zta	dr_Willis	xmessage can't browse files.
2009-01-18T17:52:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Zta	 it may have optiosn.. or there may be a enhanced variant that can.. i recall using one likd 5+ yrs ago :)
