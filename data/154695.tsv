2007-08-24T11:54:00.000Z	MrMist		Anyhow... I need to start up programs in a specific order when Gnome is loading. Beryl manager should load first, then this dock application. Is there any way to set the sequence the session programs are being loaded ?

2007-08-24T11:55:00.000Z	MrMist	n2diy	It's the session startup i'm into, not the boot of the actual machine..
2007-08-24T11:56:00.000Z	n2diy	MrMist	ok, then look it the files beneath init?
