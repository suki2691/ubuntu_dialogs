2011-12-18T14:08:00.000Z	theos	ljuspunkt	oh ok i will try. cant i download the particular driver for this cam? instead of upgrading everything? i like LTS :) thanks

If this is the case you may find the information you need in some README file or something like that. Good luck ;-)
2011-12-18T14:14:00.000Z	theos	ljuspunkt	yeah thats what i wanted to say. i need the right drivers i think :) unfortunately, this cam is said to be "plug n play" according to the manufacturer :( thanks anyways. should of worked in ubuntu though.
