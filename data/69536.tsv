2009-01-07T00:01:00.000Z	SiDi	lonumirus	you can install the "unrar" package
2009-01-07T00:01:00.000Z	lonumirus	SiDi	: thanks, will install and let you know
2009-01-07T00:02:00.000Z	SiDi	lonumirus	then it should work with file-roller like for any tgz file, but i recommand you to tell your friends to send you zip instead ;P
