2010-04-30T01:28:00.000Z	elnur	joneskoo	i have 4 GB of RAM, and my 32-bit ubuntu sees all of it because of -pae kernel. does 64 bit supports even more?
2010-04-30T01:30:00.000Z	joneskoo	elnur	if you see all your memory, that's not a gain anyways. there might be some minor performance difference but which way, depends on the applications I guess. I'm not aware of significant differences either way.
