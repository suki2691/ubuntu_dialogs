2008-01-28T02:27:00.000Z	ThipThip	phenom	 I don't use a desktop picture, just a transparent cube.  Thanks for the eventual answer.  :-)  Do you know of an alternative file browser?  It's a bit dizzying trying to google this.
2008-01-28T02:29:00.000Z	phenom	ThipThip	I wouldn't dare use another browser personally, I have quite a few nautilus scripts tied up in to it already. As far as I know Nautilus is the most customizable file browser on linux. /i may be wrong, but I haven't used many other to be able to suggest another.
2008-01-28T02:29:00.000Z	ThipThip	phenom	 Oh I absolutely wouldn't use anything in place of nautilus; I meant in addition.
