2010-07-22T13:44:00.000Z	nikolam	devalientes	it is installed from repo, normally. I can.
2010-07-22T13:50:00.000Z	nikolam	devalientes	it is inside Lucid/LTS 10.04, 64bit it is openoffice 3.2.0.10 Debian 1:3.2.0-7ubuntu4.1
2010-07-22T13:52:00.000Z	nikolam	devalientes	ok, I was thinkin you asked for openoffice verion in Lts that is just dying every time.
