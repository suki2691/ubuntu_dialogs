2009-11-13T07:49:00.000Z	UbuntuGrubIssue		BILLIARD, (btw, if its easier feel free to IM me) The problem is that I can't even choose an OS, it gets to the part where it says GRUB IS LOADING then resets. the menu doesn't even show up to pick linux or windows
2009-11-13T07:50:00.000Z	UbuntuGrubIssue		I had windows first. I did the setup the same way I've always done ubuntu and dual booting. Partition hard drive, install windows, then install ubuntu, because if you install ubuntu last, windows overwrites GRUB and you can't get to your linux partition
2009-11-13T07:51:00.000Z	UbuntuGrubIssue		it worked for like 3 days with linux, no grub problem
2009-11-13T07:52:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	UbuntuGrubIssue	i've seen others with the same symptons. check the forums for possible help. not trying to run you off; just don't know the fix either.
