2010-02-16T04:55:00.000Z	JonathanEllis		I would be grateful for help with VLC. I am trying to extract audio from a DVD and having problems. Cant generate a playable file. I have tried various settings and formats. Dont want to flood the channel with all the details

2010-02-16T04:57:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Craig_Dem	I was using the transcode options in the Stream/Save bit of VLC. Guess I will try handbrake then
2010-02-16T05:02:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	Craig_Dem	Unfortunately handbrake is not available on Hardy
