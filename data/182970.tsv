2011-10-27T22:41:00.000Z	mdgeorge		I've noticed a bunch of regressions since I upgraded to oneiric
2011-10-27T22:42:00.000Z	mdgeorge		in particular, skype has stopped working and gnome-shell isn't rendering the overview properly
2011-10-27T22:43:00.000Z	Pelo	mdgeorge	most of them might have to do with gnome3 instead of gnome 2.X
