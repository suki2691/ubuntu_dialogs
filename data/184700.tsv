2006-05-27T07:38:00.000Z	CharlesE		I am leaning towards fedora core 5 instead of ubuntu I am currently waiting to finish downloading 64bit version of fedora core 5 If it was not for fedora I would be putting ubuntu on it. So my question is can anyone think of any reasons why i should choose ubuntu over fedora?
2006-05-27T07:40:00.000Z	asdx	CharlesE	apt-get, synaptic, community, free cd shipping, etc.
2006-05-27T07:41:00.000Z	CharlesE	asdx	Yeah, I am used to apt-get it will be weird to not use it. I will try fedora but I am not decided on if ill keep it that depends on if i can get dual monitors working
