2008-04-26T17:15:00.000Z	daniel_hh		Hello, yesterday I upgraded ubuntu 7.10 -> 8.04, but Firefox3 can't work with the old extension and ruined my profile so I can't go back to FF2. I removed the FF3 package and reinstalled FF2, but when I click on links on the desktop .. opera appears (which was installed, but didn't started as default). .. Setting the alternative for x-www-browser didn't worked, setting System>settings>prefered applications>browser to firefox didn't worked
2008-04-26T17:15:00.000Z	daniel_hh		... what can I do?
