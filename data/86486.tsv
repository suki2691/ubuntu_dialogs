2010-10-28T10:11:00.000Z	doc|home		I've set up a user cron using crontab -e. It doesn't seem to be getting run. Anyone got any suggestions why? No .allow or .deny files are used :/
2010-10-28T10:12:00.000Z	OEP	doc|home	do other jobs run ok?
2010-10-28T10:13:00.000Z	doc|home	OEP	hmmm, ok, it seems they are running... I hadn't checked an hour and the test one seems to be running, doh. Thanks
2010-10-28T10:14:00.000Z	OEP	doc|home	haha ok, cheers
