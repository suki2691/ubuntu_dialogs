2009-06-02T16:04:00.000Z	Niels_		Hi Folks!Has anyone ever shrinked a 5TB ext3 Partition down to the half?If so, how long did it take to finish?
2009-06-02T16:04:00.000Z	ozzmosis	Niels_	eek .. I'd probably use XFS or something instead :)
2009-06-02T16:05:00.000Z	Niels_	ziroday	extremely long? 1hr?2hrs? or even more?
2009-06-02T16:05:00.000Z	ozzmosis	Niels_	at least, from my understanding of ext3, it's not really suitable for such large partitions...
