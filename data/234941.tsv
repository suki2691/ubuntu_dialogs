2010-11-16T18:40:00.000Z	CarlFK	lucas_	I used apt-mirror and apt-cach and have just started using http://packages.ubuntu.com/maverick/squid-deb-proxy  way less issues.
2010-11-16T18:42:00.000Z	lucas_	CarlFK	Since I already have the files on my HDD could I just use squid-deb-proxy and point it to my mirrored folder?
2010-11-16T18:45:00.000Z	CarlFK	lucas_	 I am sure there is a way, but I gave up looking when I switched.  ask in #squid
