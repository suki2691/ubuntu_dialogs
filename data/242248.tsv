2005-08-10T10:40:00.000Z	liraz		Does anyone know of a program similar to kalarm for gnome(since trying to download kalarm forces me to basically download all kde libs). I want it mainly for the timed reminders...

2005-08-10T10:42:00.000Z	liraz	Kamping_Kaiser	does it have timed reminders which pop up on my screen without running the whole e-mail client?
2005-08-10T10:43:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	liraz	i believe so, but i don't use it
