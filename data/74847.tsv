2009-11-12T00:07:00.000Z	cordor	Rautamiekka	in gnome, mouse works(i can move the cursor around), just doesn't response mouse click(can't switch application, click buttons....) keyboard is ok. It happened after i did a normal upgrade this morning. It might be the kernel, since i had the same problem last time(2.6.31.11), I have been ignoring the problem by using old kernel(2.6.28.x) now the old kernel is gone.
