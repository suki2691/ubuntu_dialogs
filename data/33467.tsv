2010-04-29T08:01:00.000Z	Luyza		^QUESTION^  Hi, I love nautilus Spacial view, in particular, the little drop down menu in the statusbar, with the folder tree, BUT I hate that it opens a new window everytime you click a folder. Is it possible to keep the view like that, but prevent it from opening windows?
2010-04-29T08:03:00.000Z	ArtVandalae	Luyza	you can change it to non-spacial view, but I don't know if that's what you want. In Nautilus: Edit -> Preferences -> Behaviour -> "Always open in browser windows"
2010-04-29T08:03:00.000Z	ArtVandalae	Luyza	actually that may not be it, two seconds
2010-04-29T08:04:00.000Z	Luyza	ArtVandalae	 yeah, then it's so clunky and fat, :P the spacial view is very "streamlined". Oh well. apt--get install Thunar
