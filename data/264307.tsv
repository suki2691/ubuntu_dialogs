2005-10-27T05:24:00.000Z	Bonzodog		hrm..ok, have asked in the forums, no-ones out of bed yet, so:
2005-10-27T05:24:00.000Z	Bonzodog		Is it possible to create a 'shutdown splash' for ubuntu?
2005-10-27T05:25:00.000Z	topyli	Bonzodog	should be, many distros have one :)
2005-10-27T05:25:00.000Z	topyli	Bonzodog	OTOH, other distros don't use usplash afaik
