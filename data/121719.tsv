2009-09-27T06:50:00.000Z	zebastian		i just downloaded swiftweasel from here http://sourceforge.net/projects/swiftweasel/ and then installed it, it is in usr/local/swiftweasel3 but the problem is i can't set a launcher on the avant dock for some reason
2009-09-27T06:51:00.000Z	zebastian		if i go to the menu and then internet and then swiftweasel it loads no problem
2009-09-27T06:51:00.000Z	zebastian		is there a way to find a path to the apps on the menu
