2010-10-17T07:55:00.000Z	geez		Hello ubuntu users, I have a MSI netbook with 9.10 Karmic running. I want to install 10.10 on a Toshiba satellite but on the ubuntu site all I see is desktop, netbook and server. Does ubuntu install on a regular laptop?

2010-10-17T07:56:00.000Z	chu_	geez	I don't think there are any issues.
2010-10-17T07:56:00.000Z	chu_	geez	Yeah that's all I did.
