2006-12-06T07:52:00.000Z	zainka		ok Im back, no compilation done yet.  How do i install make utility, its not installed as far as I can see. Install build-essential only asks for destination file opperand using -T, tried one but source is not found
2006-12-06T07:53:00.000Z	jrib	zainka	sudo apt-get install build-essential    should just install a package.  Can you be more specific about what asked you for a destination?  Pastebin the output please
2006-12-06T07:54:00.000Z	jrib	zainka	by the way, what program are you compiling?
2006-12-06T07:58:00.000Z	zainka	jrib	sorry for delay in answering, I am (trying) to compile KDE Kontrollerlab, an IDE for avr-gcc and AVR microcontroller debugging. It can be found on sourceforge http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=177228
