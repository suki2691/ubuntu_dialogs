2012-04-12T18:34:00.000Z	tutysra	MonkeyDust	- as per the community page - there were issues with EFI boot and they have given instructions to purge grub-efi and instead install grub-pc. I had did the workaround and installed grub-pc and still it doesn't boot into ubuntu, It saya 'No Operating System Found'
