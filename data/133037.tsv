2010-04-11T09:51:00.000Z	luis_		for god sake please I need help I am tired of this problem already: Suddenly 3 days ago my firefox markers and history stoped working because it says a "security program is using the places.sqlite file than contains the markers and history". Thanks to this I need to type every page I wanna enter again and I cannot go backwards and forward in any page. cannot believe no one can help me here :/  (I am firefox owner, I am ubuntu sudo too)
