2010-09-30T21:51:00.000Z	deeztek		Having some real weird issues with a Ubutnu 10.04 server shutting down (turning off) with no explanation why it's happenning. The only thing I have is the logs simply stop and then they start when the system gets powered on. I thought maybe it's the automatic updates.
2010-09-30T21:53:00.000Z	deeztek		Sorry newbie here. Do I just type my issue here?
