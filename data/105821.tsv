2008-01-14T08:41:00.000Z	john47	NumBeast_sal	Thanks, ok, I need to be more specific.  I have Windows OS on another partition - How to I do the re-install such that I don't kill all those files?

2008-01-14T08:43:00.000Z	NumBeast_sal	john47	but I think you can choose what partition to install to from the graphical installer
