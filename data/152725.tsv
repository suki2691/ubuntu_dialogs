2011-04-25T23:24:00.000Z	Shaba1		is there and actual forum for wubi anywhere on the net.
2011-04-25T23:24:00.000Z	Shaba1		All the googleing I did turned up forums and blogs for ubuntu but not wubi specific ones
2011-04-25T23:26:00.000Z	arand	Shaba1	I think the normal ubuntu forums would be the place... along with launchpad for bugtracking..
