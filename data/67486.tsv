2009-01-29T02:43:00.000Z	sm		hi, where can I get a postgresql 8.2 package for intrepid ?
2009-01-29T02:44:00.000Z	schnitz	sm	you could look up the deb archive found through debian.org
2009-01-29T02:45:00.000Z	sm	schnitz	I have been searching the ubuntu packages on launchpad and packages.ubuntu.com, they are confusing and all seem to end up at hardy packages. Might those work ?
2009-01-29T02:55:00.000Z	sm	schnitz	macd: looks like I got lucky, two hardy pg debs downloaded from launchpad work fine on intrepid. Thanks for the help
