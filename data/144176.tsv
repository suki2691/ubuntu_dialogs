2007-03-03T17:20:00.000Z	nowhere		Hi, question... I tried to switch to ubuntu, have to say I like it a lot. One important problem though, could't get connected to my wireless network (WPA). I found it's possible to filter MAC addresses for the network via my router, does this provide enough security? Or is it only secure using signal encription?

2007-03-03T17:22:00.000Z	nowhere		That sucks :<
