2011-09-25T01:02:00.000Z	macuser_		I am a simple end user trying to find data files on a Windows partition under Ubuntu BASH terminal.  Where does Windows keep data files?
2011-09-25T01:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	macuser_	 you could ask in #windows    it would depend on the file
2011-09-25T01:05:00.000Z	macuser_	Boom_Farmer	yes, I want to destroy this user's data.  I am looking for the My Documents folder
2011-09-25T01:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	macuser_	 should be in the users directory. depends on the windows version.
