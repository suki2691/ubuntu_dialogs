2009-07-20T20:02:00.000Z	LogicFan	Threetimes	when ripping a disc?
2009-07-20T20:02:00.000Z	LogicFan		if you don't want to accurately reproduce the CD without any errors, you must not be ripping a CD
2009-07-20T20:03:00.000Z	Threetimes	LogicFan	I can't hear the difference anyway, but user-friendlyness and system intergration are alse important to me. You may have another opinion, but not everybody has.
