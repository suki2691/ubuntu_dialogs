2012-04-24T09:28:00.000Z	undeclaredx		I setup ZFS using the zfs-stable PPA / ubuntu-zfs package.  It's EXTREMELY EXTREMELY slow.  Would anyone know how I could potentially benchmark the disk performance and/or find the issue?

2012-04-24T09:29:00.000Z	undeclaredx	KM0201	aka it's normal to be this slow?
2012-04-24T09:29:00.000Z	KM0201	undeclaredx	how much ram do you have vs how much hard drive space?
