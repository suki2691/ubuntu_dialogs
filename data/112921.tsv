2007-11-23T03:20:00.000Z	Toxygen		hey guys. i have a problem. my computer is really slow, it's a compaq so i'd expected it to be slow, but right now i'm thinking of installing ubuntu on it. the only problem is it doesn't recognize cd's and i tried to boot the cd at startup but it doesn't work. is there any other way i can install ubuntu on it without using a cd or a usb flash drive? because i don't have a big enough flash drive anywhere.

2007-11-23T03:21:00.000Z	Toxygen	krimx	i already did that. i made it first, but it still doesn't work.
