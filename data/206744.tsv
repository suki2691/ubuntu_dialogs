2007-03-19T16:42:00.000Z	sethk	voltagex	prompt is a built in, I think, can't be missing.
2007-03-19T16:42:00.000Z	voltagex	jrib	err, I was told it was external, but how do I autoload it?
2007-03-19T16:42:00.000Z	sethk	voltagex	actually, I don't find prompt on any of my boxes, including the ones where I installed zsh from source.
