2007-10-29T18:22:00.000Z	coldboot		VMWare is telling me that the kernel headers I have are not for SMP...
2007-10-29T18:22:00.000Z	crimsun_	coldboot	only in older Ubuntu releases  (most newer releases are SMP by default unless -386 is installed)
2007-10-29T18:23:00.000Z	coldboot	crimsun_	Ah okay, so VMware is just stupid.
