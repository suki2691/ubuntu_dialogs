2005-05-02T06:57:00.000Z	xfSx		hey guys, just noticed that samba file sharing doesn't seem to work.. if i /etc/init.d/samba restart i get a restart [fail] , i've looked at smb.conf.. how come the default doesn't work?
2005-05-02T06:59:00.000Z	SeamusLP	xfSx	 Have you tried /etc/init.d/samba start ?
2005-05-02T07:00:00.000Z	SeamusLP	xfSx	 I don't know what's going on.  I'm running hoary and the default samba is fine.
2005-05-02T07:03:00.000Z	SeamusLP	xfSx	 I wish I could help, don't really know much about samba though
