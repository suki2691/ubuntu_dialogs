2010-05-24T23:15:00.000Z	siks		any ideas why 10.04 startup would stay in the "four dots" mode at startup? i think it's at "checking battery state". top shows nothing interesting (or i don't see it), ps xaf's not very helpful..
2010-05-24T23:16:00.000Z	siks		i left the distribution upgrade thing running and my laptop was in a hibernate mode of some sort when i got back. i had to reboot it and now it's stuck in that four dots screen
2010-05-24T23:16:00.000Z	siks		i also tried booting an earlier kernel
2010-05-24T23:17:00.000Z	Docteh	siks	i had a problem like that, but i reinstalled instead of working the problem :-/
