2005-06-02T05:51:00.000Z	florian_		sorry for this, but Im now a rather experienced user and every distro I've installed up to now came with emacs, so whats the standard ubuntu editor for programming?
2005-06-02T05:52:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	florian_	I think emacs is installed by default on ubuntu too
2005-06-02T05:53:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	florian_	well anyway, installing it is just one command line away :-)
