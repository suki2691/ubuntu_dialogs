2011-01-11T05:08:00.000Z	yugnoswam		Sorry. I am currently installing ubuntu onto my main computer via memory stick, I am on the desktop and have clicked the "Install Ubuntu 10.10", I have followed everything through and I am up to the "Who are you" section. I have filled out all of my details and at the bottom it says "Ready when you are" I am ready but I cannot click on the "Forward" button as it partially faded out.
