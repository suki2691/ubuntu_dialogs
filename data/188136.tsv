2006-10-20T06:27:00.000Z	hastesaver	sonics	yes
2006-10-20T06:28:00.000Z	hastesaver	sonics	it means there is no newer version in the repositories. You could get out of the system and compile it yourself (or add different repos) or something
2006-10-20T06:30:00.000Z	hastesaver	sonics	there you go. When you upgrade to edgy, you'll have the version 2.0.0+beta3.1-1ubuntu9 (edgy)
