2010-05-13T11:25:00.000Z	BentSpace	ActionParsnip	TY, it says "samba: unrecognized service" when I try that command.
2010-05-13T11:32:00.000Z	BentSpace	ActionParsnip	 It says, "samba is already the newest version."  I had previous installed it from Synaptic.  Should I uninstall it and try to install from terminal?
2010-05-13T11:40:00.000Z	BentSpace	ActionParsnip	blue102, Uninstall via Synaptic reinstalled with sudo apt-get install samba.  Still can't find the service tough.  What did you mean by tab completing service name?
