2009-01-15T11:06:00.000Z	Light-	Brack101	are you using wine from the wine repos or wine from the ubuntu repos?
2009-01-15T11:07:00.000Z	Brack101	Light-	wine repos
2009-01-15T11:07:00.000Z	Light-	Brack101	ohk, thats what you should be using. Your error doesnt really help us much, best talk to the wine people
