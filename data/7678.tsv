2011-12-03T02:16:00.000Z	esben		I have high power usage on my thinkpad t420 -- I have tried a couple different thinks, pcie_aspm=force at boot, some kernel that was supposed to have the acpi fix, installing tp_smapi_dkms but still have +20 W power usage...
2011-12-03T02:17:00.000Z	esben		Any ideas? Its a core i5
