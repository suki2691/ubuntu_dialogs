2007-05-22T15:06:00.000Z	Frogzoo	rowland	you mean you can see the desktop? try opening a terminal
2007-05-22T15:07:00.000Z	rowland	Frogzoo	 I think it's just when I am using applications like firefox
2007-05-22T15:07:00.000Z	rowland	Frogzoo	 I open something and noi text, reduce it, maximise it again and hey presto it's there!
