2010-01-05T05:25:00.000Z	Spo8		successfully boots to the disc, but fails the second anything is chosen.  installed ubuntu countless times, but never had this happen and I can't figure it out.

2010-01-05T05:27:00.000Z	Spo8	Shazam	I haven't, but I'd be surprised as this machine has been working flawlessly.  Choosing mem-check from the ubuntu disc makes it hang as well, so I'm not sure what to do.
