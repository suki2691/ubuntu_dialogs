2006-04-19T06:27:00.000Z	Mathman	eobanb__	seems like he tried that.  but it complained about not finding foo.cfg or whatever.  course I suggested he change into his call of duty directory first then.  course I don't think he listened at all...
2006-04-19T06:32:00.000Z	eobanb__	Mathman	i dont think it should make a difference
2006-04-19T06:32:00.000Z	Mathman	eobanb__	well again, when he tried wine before he was talking abouut it not finding some config file.
