2010-05-21T03:25:00.000Z	AbuMaia		I have used system>administration>usb startup disk creator to copy the 10.04 iso to my usb drive.  Is there a way to edit it to include other programs like antivirus?  I had to use the usb drive to recover my mother's windows computer from a virus, but there was no antivirus included in the livecd.

2010-05-21T03:27:00.000Z	acerimmer	AbuMaia	not sure i understand.  I added wifi drivers to my live usb and it retained them...
