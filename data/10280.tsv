2011-08-22T22:44:00.000Z	Polah	sausagefish	Sure, let me just get out my psychic powers to find out what you've recently done that could break it and what sound system, inputs and outputs you're using.
2011-08-22T22:45:00.000Z	sausagefish	Polah	it was working fine all I change frequently is the output for my speakers and the hdmi output
2011-08-22T22:48:00.000Z	Polah	sausagefish	and what sound system are you using? pulse?
