2005-10-08T07:38:00.000Z	ScatterBrain	transgress	I can't remember for sure.  But I know it's *much* less than glx-gears is.
2005-10-08T07:38:00.000Z	transgress	ScatterBrain	yeah there is a reason for that though... it's supposed to be less.
2005-10-08T07:38:00.000Z	ScatterBrain	transgress	Right.  I'm thinking is like 500 fps or something.
