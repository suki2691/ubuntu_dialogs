2006-06-13T13:42:00.000Z	DevZer0		My Ubuntu 6.06 instalation get stuck at 64% all the time, i checked out the known instalation issues on the website but i dont belive neither of thsoe apply to me. I am using the live-cd, would it help to get the alternative-cd ?

2006-06-13T13:43:00.000Z	DevZer0	neutrinomass	i did the cd check, i found 1 file that was /casper/something.fs was currupted could that also be the issue, if thats the case then should i re-download the image ?
2006-06-13T13:45:00.000Z	DevZer0	neutrinomass	i will do a md5 check off the checksum file on the image and see.
