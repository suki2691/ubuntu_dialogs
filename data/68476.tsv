2009-01-18T18:23:00.000Z	jxander		i use ati big desktop with 1280x800 and 1280x1024... could i restrict the gnome desktop to use only 800 height instead of the 1024 virtual desktop resolution? this is a region on the laptop panel (the first one) which i cannot see, but icons are placed there.
2009-01-18T18:25:00.000Z	jxander		anyone? or is there a possibility to restrict the use of a part of the gnome desktop?

2009-01-18T18:27:00.000Z	jxander	alkjflsakjf	i don't even see it :P, but icons are placed there... it's the big desktop with different resolutions dead zone... bug gnome puts icons there... :(... any other idea?
