2006-09-08T07:36:00.000Z	harisund	der0b	do fuser /dev/dsp
2006-09-08T07:37:00.000Z	der0b	harisund	didn't seem to help
2006-09-08T07:38:00.000Z	harisund	der0b	I hope you are using fuser the right way.... I'm not sure, but the last time I wanted to know what was taking over my /dev/dsp somebody said fuser and that worked fine for me :)
