2008-01-07T03:29:00.000Z	Jeah	toni_	Error during an install from a Xubuntu Gutsy alt install disc image is "[!!] Install the base system - Debootstrap Error: Failed to determine the codename for the release."  It's kind of a long story, but I'm installing from a partion on the hard drive to which I dd'd the iso.  I think that's probably related to the error, but I don't know what to do about it.
2008-01-07T03:30:00.000Z	Jeah	toni_	any idea what would be causing that / how to get around it?
