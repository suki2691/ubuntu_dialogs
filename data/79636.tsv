2012-08-12T15:58:00.000Z	Maxwell		I´m having a big problem right now: yesterday I used gparted to expand my linux partition. for doing that it had to copy my partition to the front on my hard drive. At the point about a half was copied my computer turned suddenly off without error message. Same as trying to do a diskcheck after crashing and also crashed. Ubuntu can´t boot right now of course but it only copied my data which means it still is somewhere on my harddriv
2012-08-12T15:59:00.000Z	Maxwell		 Is there any option to rescue that data?
2012-08-12T15:59:00.000Z	Golfgeo	Maxwell	low level tool can be a help, but only if you know where the start and end of the data is... exactly I mean...
2012-08-12T16:02:00.000Z	Golfgeo	Maxwell	to be honest, best bet is to start over with the disk, install a fresh copy of everything and safe on a ton of mental pain and shrinks...
