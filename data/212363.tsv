2006-03-10T10:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	KurtKraut	to edit id3 tags, try EasyTag or Cowbell (I prefer EasyTag myself)
2006-03-10T10:38:00.000Z	Madpilot	KurtKraut	EasyTag is a very good app - rolling it into a play doesn't strike me as useful...
2006-03-10T10:39:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Madpilot	yes it is useful. Rhythymbox arranges music fully based on ID3 tags. So if you notice something wrong, you cant fix it thru Rh, so this is boring
