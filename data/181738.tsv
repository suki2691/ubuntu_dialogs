2006-06-07T16:26:00.000Z	maddy_	clement_lefebvre	thanx m8 im busy upgrading and wuz wondering whether postfix is relevant
2006-06-07T16:27:00.000Z	clement_lefebvre	maddy_	depends. My ISP doesn't provide any SMTP server so I use postfix... but if you have an SMTP server available for you on the net, then you probably don't need postfix.
2006-06-07T16:28:00.000Z	maddy_	clement_lefebvre	my smtp block traffic on port 25 outgoing most isps do in Holland :)
