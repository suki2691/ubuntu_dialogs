2008-12-09T15:55:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	luddite	right click the directory you are looking to share and select share
2008-12-09T15:56:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	luddite	"sharing options" rather
2008-12-09T15:57:00.000Z	luddite	Paddy_EIRE	- thanks - i did that- it says "'net usershare' returned error 255: net usershare add: cannot convert name "Everyone" to a SID. The connection was refused. Maybe smbd is not running."
