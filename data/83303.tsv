2008-09-25T23:40:00.000Z	rw__		I have hundreds of files on my external hdd. The file names are jibberish and properties tells me it's an applicatation/octet-stream. I tried to delete them but I can't. Even when I start nautilus as root, it says I don't have permission. Any help?

2008-09-25T23:42:00.000Z	rw__	sysdoc	not sure
2008-09-25T23:47:00.000Z	sysdoc	rw__	did you follow that?
