2009-07-09T09:37:00.000Z	LeChacal	ctmjr	that is just fonts i have that installed but that isnt acroread, i just reinstalled janunty and i had it installed before i reloaded my system
2009-07-09T09:38:00.000Z	LeChacal	ctmjr	and apt wont let you just install acroread-fonts because it has acroread as a dependency
