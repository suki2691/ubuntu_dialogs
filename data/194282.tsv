2007-06-09T12:18:00.000Z	Jack_		Hey everyone, i've been having a major problem with my toshiba laptop in ubuntu, the problem is this: If the computer has been on for more than an hour it will most likely hang and show major graphic artifacts and require a hard reboot, if i run any ram/cpu intensive program (games, firefox, compile something, etc) it hangs in the same way as before. I thought it was bad ram and replaced both ram modules but this still happens,
2007-06-09T12:18:00.000Z	Jack_		i thought it was overheating, but the temperature (70C) was well below the safe maximum, I have no idea what could be causing it now and any help would be greatly appreciated.
