2008-04-17T04:37:00.000Z	s2		im trying to get ubuntu to boot from the live cd onto my laptop but it doesnt seem to be working. Ive gone into the BIOS and told the computer to boot from the cd, but it insists on starting up in windows. Ive read on the help forums that the way around this is to get smartbootmanager on a floppy but my laptop can only have a cd drive OR a floppy drive in it at one time, does anyone know a way around this?

2008-04-17T04:39:00.000Z	smithey93	s2	download the alternate disk, its a hell of a lot easyer
2008-04-17T04:40:00.000Z	smithey93	s2	go for it:), if not, tell it not to boot from the harddrive an only from the cd if its possible on your bios
