2008-11-22T14:01:00.000Z	fenerli7	srx2002	yes
2008-11-22T14:01:00.000Z	fenerli7	srx2002	you need something, i forgot what though, the packages nonfree-codecs and ubuntu-restricted-extras i think
2008-11-22T14:05:00.000Z	fenerli7	srx2002	yes, ubuntu hide the non-free(dom) stuff that is usually needed :(
