2005-07-03T10:34:00.000Z	Octane		is it safe to use packages built for debian, not specifically for ubuntu
2005-07-03T10:35:00.000Z	IceDC571	Octane	as long as its not important packages
2005-07-03T10:35:00.000Z	Octane	Strife	IceDC571: something like amarok for example
2005-07-03T10:36:00.000Z	IceDC571	Octane	amarok is okay, its a deb package at least.. you can remove it if it causes problems
