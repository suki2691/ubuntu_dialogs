2008-03-04T21:47:00.000Z	replicant		how can i know what is using /dev/sda3 when, after mkfs.ext3 I get: /dev/sda3 is apparently in use by the system; will not make a filesystem here!
2008-03-04T21:47:00.000Z	replicant		it is not mounted
2008-03-04T21:48:00.000Z	zossso	replicant	try the command `df` to display what you have mounted
2008-03-04T21:48:00.000Z	zossso	replicant	scratch previous post then..  do you sudo the command?
