2011-06-16T07:23:00.000Z	Belxjander		Who can explain to me why registering "Belxjander@gmail.com" which is my perfectly functional Email Account for Ubuntu One, and now attempting to recover the password for reconnecting my UbuntuOne Account(newly created) to the same Email address fails to provide any kind of recovery code stalling any recovery at all ?
2011-06-16T07:25:00.000Z	Belxjander		Is the UbuntuOne system force-case-dropping the initial capitalized B on my Email address? as this will be the *first* system I have met in 10+ years to actually force a complete lowercase username for an Email address (my username is first-letter capitalized on ALL the systems I use)
2011-06-16T07:26:00.000Z	wonderworld	Belxjander	i guess this would help most -> https://one.ubuntu.com/support/contact/
2011-06-16T07:26:00.000Z	Belxjander	wonderworld	I'll have to leave that open as I need to head away again...
