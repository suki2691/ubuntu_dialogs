2007-04-25T08:18:00.000Z	J^son		just installed ubuntu on one of my computers.... the other runs windows... i have a network set-up between the two through a router... I am trying to set-up access to the printer hooked up to the ubuntu box from windows.. I have followed the instructions in the ubuntu documentation and while windows does see the printer, it can't access it to print... can someone help me?

2007-04-25T09:47:00.000Z	Pelo	J^son	 stupid question here but can you print from the ubuntu computer ?
2007-10-05T07:20:00.000Z	Pelo	J^son	 make sure the printer is on and online with paper in it and that the pinter manager is not paused
