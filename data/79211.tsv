2012-04-26T21:49:00.000Z	ghabit		one more question - is there some difference between ubuntu updated to 12.04 and fresh install of 12.04?
2012-04-26T21:49:00.000Z	Monotoko	ghabit	not at the core... it's a bit of an open ended question
2012-04-26T21:51:00.000Z	ghabit	Monotoko	sorry, cannot understand it.
2012-04-26T21:52:00.000Z	Monotoko	ghabit	the only differences between upgrading and installing anew is that when you upgrade, everything including your packages is preserved... but it can go wrong because of packages colliding
