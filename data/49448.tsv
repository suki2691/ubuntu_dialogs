2009-08-31T19:56:00.000Z	RHorse	richm4n	have you studied the man page for mount already?
2009-08-31T20:06:00.000Z	richm4n	RHorse	Thanks again. I've mounted rw and deleted all the files  but what I really want is rw access by default for normal users - not just root. Any ideas?
2009-08-31T20:07:00.000Z	RHorse	richm4n	try umask=0 option
2009-08-31T20:11:00.000Z	richm4n	RHorse	Where would I use that?
