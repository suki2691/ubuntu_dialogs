2005-04-30T16:14:00.000Z	Quinn_Storm	snowblink	heh, I don't have much need for it, I personally just rdesktop into a windows box in the corner if I need windows
2005-04-30T16:16:00.000Z	snowblink	Quinn_Storm	I'm waiting for my laptop to arrive which I'll install Ubuntu on. In the meantime, I have to VMware it on someone's spare windows box...
2005-04-30T16:16:00.000Z	Quinn_Storm	snowblink	ah, I see.  the windows box I'm talking about is only a windows box b/c it has to be (only way I can use the wireless card I own), its a not-a-laptop (dead screen&battery) that sits in the corner silently bridging the network
