2008-02-02T17:04:00.000Z	suweid		Maybe not a strictly ubuntuesque question, but suppose I installed Apache and it worked fine, untill I sudormrf:ed some configuation files away. I don't need nothing fancy schmansy configuration, i just want the default files to magically reappear. I've tried reinstalling apache, but that doesn't help. What to do?
