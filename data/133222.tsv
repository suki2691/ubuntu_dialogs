2007-05-25T06:42:00.000Z	MarkIsHere		I have a question I am hoping someone can answer - I have downloaded & install 7.04 64bit and the nvidia drivers don't work correctly - Is there a simple way to get them running AND if there isn't will loading the 32bit version fix the problem ?
2007-05-25T06:44:00.000Z	Pelo	MarkIsHere	first  try and use the restricted driver feature in  menu > system > admin > restricted drivers ,  if that doesn'T work come back for further help
2007-05-25T06:45:00.000Z	MarkIsHere	Pelo	- The restricted driver feature is what got me into trouble
