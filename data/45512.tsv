2009-10-18T03:25:00.000Z	m_law		got a stupid question: when i look at how much space I have used on a hard drive it shows up as 248 Gb but all the files on the Hard Drive only add up to 228 GB can anyone tell me why ?
2009-10-18T03:27:00.000Z	zaoul1	m_law	I believe some space is 'wasted' for the partitioning information .. 'inodes' ?
2009-10-18T03:27:00.000Z	m_law	zaoul1	I have a 20gb diffrence
2009-10-18T03:29:00.000Z	zaoul1	m_law	you are looking at df -h ?
