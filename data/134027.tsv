2011-11-08T08:15:00.000Z	erpo		Hi. I don't know if this is an appropriate question for this channel, but I would appreciate some help. I'm attempting to learn japanese with the help of a Japanese person online. His family name is Takahashi, but he spells it with the kanji 髙 instead of the more typical kanji 高. I'm using anthy on Ubuntu 11.10. Is there a way I can type the correct kanji without having to copy and paste it each time?

2011-11-08T08:17:00.000Z	erpo	phlak_user	I can use anthy without a problem. I just don't think anthy knows about that variant of the kanji.
2011-11-08T08:17:00.000Z	phlak_user	erpo	oh ok
