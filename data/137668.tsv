2010-10-08T18:23:00.000Z	llutz	snikkerz	it hat, at least the better depends-handling
2010-10-08T18:23:00.000Z	llutz	snikkerz	and of course, the ncourses frontend for those who like
2010-10-08T18:24:00.000Z	llutz	snikkerz	don't get me wrong, i don't say apt-get is bad. i'm using debian since 15 yrs but i don't see anything apt-get could do better than aptitude
