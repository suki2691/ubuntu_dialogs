2008-05-24T10:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	arab-boy	 i suggest  if you use those tools to 'unmount/disable' the linux drives  when done with them under windows.. if Windows crashes - it CAN mess up the linux  files.   Plus any files you copy TO the linux drives will be owned by root. which can cause issues.
