2010-01-21T19:07:00.000Z	MrNaz		are there any issues running amd64 ubuntu on intel atom systems ?
2010-01-21T19:08:00.000Z	MrNaz		hmm
2010-01-21T19:08:00.000Z	MrNaz		perhaps it'd be safer to just use i386
2010-01-21T19:08:00.000Z	MidnighToker	MrNaz	if you want 64bit then amd64 is the way to go for intel/amd/other
