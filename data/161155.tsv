2006-12-16T17:17:00.000Z	s4ltydog		Has anyone had an issue where when you install ubuntu, the monitor turns a greenish hue (I've made sure it is not the monitor)
2006-12-16T17:17:00.000Z	Arwen	s4ltydog	yes... this is usually caused by an xorg error
2006-12-16T17:18:00.000Z	Arwen	s4ltydog	oh wait.. greenish hue, sorry, nvm - never seen it before
