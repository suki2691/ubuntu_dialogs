2009-08-05T16:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	stevem	 Hmm.. I think it worked here that way for me last week  when i tried it
2009-08-05T16:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	stevem	 i dont recall the 2nd monitor being disabled...
2009-08-05T16:36:00.000Z	stevem	Dr_Willis	well see this is a virtual ubuntu that I'm xdcmp'ing to ... it's only really got 1 'virtual' monitor - will I have to make a fake one
2009-08-05T16:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	stevem	 no idea on that. I used xdmcp to connect to my pc thats behind me.. and im pretty sure both monitors worked here.. I would expect it to work thta way.. sice X is running 'locally' using twinview and the nvidia drivers.. just the apps are running remotely
