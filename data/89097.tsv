2009-07-17T09:54:00.000Z	Gemmie78		Hello. I've been having issues with my pidgin instant messenger recently being unable to sign in to both my MSN accounts and my Yahoo account. Has anyone experienced a problem recently
2009-07-17T09:55:00.000Z	Gemmie78		I can explain what version I am currently running but after researching google and forums haven't found much help on my exact issue
2009-07-17T09:57:00.000Z	glitsj16	Gemmie78	what version pidgin are you running? there was some yahoo trouble with 2.5.7 that has been fixed in 2.5.8 recently
2009-07-17T09:59:00.000Z	glitsj16	Gemmie78	yep, each time msn or yahoo (or any of the other supported networks) changes their service, pidgin needs to adapt to it, might be worth to upgrade pidgin, i'd check getdeb.net for a supported version
