2007-06-20T10:10:00.000Z	Sparc42		Hello,  I'm running FF over EE and its pretty messed up. I want to a clean reinstall of FF from the liveCD.  Got all the backups done.  So from the liveCD I get to the partitioning and then I'm lost. I have a winxp partition that I don't want to lose.  anyone here can walk me through it?
