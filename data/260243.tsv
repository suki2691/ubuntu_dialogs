2008-01-02T05:31:00.000Z	l3oddah		i'm looking for some help with a vpn connection, can anyone help with that?
2008-01-02T05:32:00.000Z	l3oddah		ok, so i created a vpn connection to my work, and i get connected to it just fine, but when i try to view my desktop at work, i get an error of no route to host (113) with vncviewer
2008-01-02T05:34:00.000Z	l3oddah		well just a quick question though, my home network is class C, and my work network is class C, after connecting to vpn /etc/resolv.conf is rewritten and adds my home default gw as a nameserver, is that supposed to do that?
