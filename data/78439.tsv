2010-07-17T02:19:00.000Z	tophyr	oddtod	when i was a kid my dad called me 'tofer' (chris-topher), and he set me up with an email acct when i was like 8 and into aliens and such. i thought "tophyr" looked cool
2010-07-17T02:36:00.000Z	oddtod	tophyr	there is a char on Doll House named topher figured it might be  reference to that \
