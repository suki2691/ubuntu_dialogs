2012-03-18T03:59:00.000Z	pfifo	velko_	it can be named anything, /home/old is not required
2012-03-18T04:00:00.000Z	velko_	pfifo	yep. but she does not understand the command. so she cannot modify it approprieately. besides all of the command require sudo and are dangerous if are mistyped or misunderstood
2012-03-18T04:00:00.000Z	pfifo	velko_	thats why you dont run commands that you dont understand
