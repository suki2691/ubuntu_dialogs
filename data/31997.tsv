2010-05-14T06:40:00.000Z	red2kic	cruejones	Try asking that question in #ubuntu-server
2010-05-14T06:41:00.000Z	cruejones	red2kic	will try - but hoping the answer will hold for desktop as well via the alternate cd
2010-05-14T06:42:00.000Z	red2kic	cruejones	It is strange. Unable to install Ubuntu on the laptop. (Honestly). Could be one of the borked updated packages such as grub-pc or grub*. I can't really be sure (for my issue).
