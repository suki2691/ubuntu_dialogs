2009-07-10T01:44:00.000Z	Milligan		I just installed Ubuntu 9.04 on a new machine that has an Nvidia ION card in it. However, ubuntu didn't list the nvidia driver as a possible propri driver. Any ideas why ?

2009-07-10T01:47:00.000Z	Milligan	moymoy	that means I have to install from nvidia drivers, and not ubuntu supported ones ?
2009-07-10T01:47:00.000Z	moymoy	Milligan	there's no difference, the drivers offered by jockey-gtk or through the repos are the same drivers on the nvidia page, no modifications whatsoever.. the NVIDIA drivers are closed source, so they can't be modified
