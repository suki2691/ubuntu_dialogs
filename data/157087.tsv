2007-11-08T01:03:00.000Z	Makedonas		hey guys, quick question...During my install I wasnt connected to the internet. Consequently ubuntu didnt take something from http://security.ubuntu.com Now I find that I cant access any of the programs from the add programs database. I guess these things are connected, any clues on what I should do?
