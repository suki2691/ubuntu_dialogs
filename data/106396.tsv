2008-11-20T02:31:00.000Z	kimec		hi all, I have question about TV-out on geforce 4
2008-11-20T02:31:00.000Z	kimec		I'm running X.org 7.3 on ubuntu 8.04.
2008-11-20T02:31:00.000Z	kimec		When I type xrandr -q in terminal I can see only Screen 0: modelines but no information regarding S-VIDEO output. Is this the normal behavior, or am I missing something? According to this page http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=927&num=2 all the available outputs should be displayed. Any kind of hint would be appreciated
