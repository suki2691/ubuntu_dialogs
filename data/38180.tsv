2010-01-29T01:00:00.000Z	dskippy		I am having a problem upgrading an old machine that was on gutsy gibbon. I ran "sudo do-release-upgrade" it upgraded to hardy heron fine. I tried running that command after the upgrade and now it does not find a new version. I want to get to karmic-koala.
2010-01-29T01:01:00.000Z	hajmola	dskippy	best idea is to do a clean install
2010-01-29T01:01:00.000Z	dskippy		I tried to copy a karmic koala sources.list and run apt-get dist-upgrade but that gives lots of errors.
2010-01-29T01:01:00.000Z	dskippy	hajmola	Problem there is I am not physically at the machine.
