2008-02-11T21:40:00.000Z	dru		hello, would someone like to tell me why my firefox freezes after every flash video
2008-02-11T21:40:00.000Z	DRebellion	dru	how did you install flash?
2008-02-11T21:40:00.000Z	DRebellion	dru	did you install gnash or adobe flash?
2008-02-11T21:41:00.000Z	DRebellion	dru	so the flash doesn't work at all, or is slow/buggy?
