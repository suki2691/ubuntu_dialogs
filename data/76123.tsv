2010-01-13T03:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lakota	 it may be easier to track down a live  cd with the lates clamav/updates feature.
2010-01-13T03:39:00.000Z	lakota	Dr_Willis	 I was going to try 9.10 like the wubi installer so they can have both ubuntu and windows and see if ubuntu can clean up windows virus
2010-01-13T03:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	lakota	 if you want to clean up windows - its be faster to use a live cd with clamav - I cant stand wubi. Good luck
2010-01-13T03:41:00.000Z	lakota	Dr_Willis	ok thanks. ill do live cd then
