2004-12-01T13:15:00.000Z	imnes	daniels	yeah
2004-12-01T13:17:00.000Z	imnes	daniels	Once example, if I start up synaptic and search for "media player" all I get is the program 'beep'.  But if I search the click+run for it I get all this stuff http://www.linspire.com/lindows_products_search.php?q=media%20player that I can look through until I find something I want to try.
