2010-10-22T05:14:00.000Z	dufflebunk		I just upgraded to 10.10 a few days ago and now my computer locks up about once a day. /var/log/messages suggests the radeon kernel module is the culprit. Has anyone seen this before?

2010-10-22T05:16:00.000Z	dufflebunk	rambo2_981	yeah, especially binary drivers. I'm not surprised, I'm just hoping someone know a way to fix it.
