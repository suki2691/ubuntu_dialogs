2009-09-17T02:19:00.000Z	xmnt	JNSamuel	that's why I keep my /home elsewhere
2009-09-17T02:21:00.000Z	xmnt	JNSamuel	that the exact reason why i do it
2009-09-17T02:23:00.000Z	xmnt	JNSamuel	this is how I keep things ... special apps installed in /opt  ... /home dir contains config and app data and is stored on a different parition and backed up to a seperate hd
