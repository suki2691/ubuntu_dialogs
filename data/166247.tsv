2007-12-31T02:48:00.000Z	wols	nicholas	did you install freepascal, if so how?
2007-12-31T02:51:00.000Z	wols	nicholas	you maybe could install its source. but first find out where lazarus looks for freepascal
2007-12-31T03:23:00.000Z	wols	nicholas	never used lazarus, sorry. check /usr/share/doc/<packagename> possibly
