2008-11-20T16:20:00.000Z	Frogzoo	nite_johnboy	man shutdown
2008-11-20T16:20:00.000Z	nite_johnboy	Frogzoo	will look it up - thx
2008-11-20T16:26:00.000Z	nite_johnboy	Frogzoo	Looks like my script would be " sudo shutdown -h " and at the end I would have " hh:mm " for hours and minutes I want it to wait - This look about right ?
