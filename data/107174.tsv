2008-02-14T01:40:00.000Z	Starnestommy	yaro	do you have the necessary restricted drivers?
2008-02-14T01:40:00.000Z	yaro		Yes. That's part of my tragic tale.
2008-02-14T01:41:00.000Z	yaro	Starnestommy	I made the mistake of "upgrading from those drivers to the nVidia provided ones from their website, and it broke verything. After getting my restricted drivers back in and putting in my backed up xorg.conf, I can't start compiz, and I kinda need it.
