2007-05-20T07:47:00.000Z	tritium	Broccoly_	I that you meant ubuntu's 5.10 release
2007-05-20T07:48:00.000Z	tritium	Broccoly_	might it be flash, rather than the browser?
2007-05-20T07:49:00.000Z	Broccoly_	tritium	nope, i dont even have flash heh, its the same in opera and firefox, it must be some rendering subsystem
