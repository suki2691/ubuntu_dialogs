2009-06-03T04:35:00.000Z	Azalyn		will ubuntu's partitioner still add windows to my grub boot menu if i chose to manually partition
2009-06-03T04:35:00.000Z	Azalyn		or is that just an option that is available with "install them side by side" ?
2009-06-03T04:36:00.000Z	Azalyn		because with the slider partitioning method i can't seem to move the slider to the far left. i had already made an ext3 partition for it. but it seems to assume i want to keep it, instead of assuming i want it to *use* it.
2009-06-03T04:37:00.000Z	fccf	Azalyn	go back and make an unpartitioned space for ubuntu to use
