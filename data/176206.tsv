2006-06-29T13:27:00.000Z	iuwngda		can anyone elaborate on the best way to share files between XP and ubuntu on a dual boot setup?  Is having a fat32 partition my best option?
2006-06-29T13:28:00.000Z	snoops	iuwngda	you can access ntfs on the ubuntu install.. and I believe you can get an ext3 driver for windows
2006-06-29T13:29:00.000Z	snoops	iuwngda	should have mentioned 'access' but not write to
2006-06-29T13:30:00.000Z	iuwngda	snoops	ya id like to be able to read/write from both windows and linux if possible
