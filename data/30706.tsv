2010-06-04T20:51:00.000Z	Sirecat		Can someone explain how to save the terminal window size after it has been resized? I have looked in the edit preferences for this option, and right clicked on the term window itself. Don't see a option for this?

2010-06-04T20:53:00.000Z	Sirecat	Dr_Willis	Hmmm ok thanks...I have seen other distros that allowed this option rather than the default term size it opens to. Thank you!
