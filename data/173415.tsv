2010-05-02T01:30:00.000Z	essial		Is there a way in Ubuntu 10.04/gnome to have something close to xfce's iconbox?
2010-05-02T01:31:00.000Z	essial		without actually using Xfce's iconbox itself
2010-05-02T01:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	essial	maybe that's a question for #xubuntu
2010-05-02T01:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	essial	yes, but probably not that many people in here know much about XFCE
