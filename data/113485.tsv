2007-11-18T05:33:00.000Z	ridge-meister		why is Ubuntu not installing packages from my dvd?  i fired up Add/Remove Programs, and turned off all the repository options, put the dvd in and it's *still* asking to me to connect to the internet.

2007-11-18T05:35:00.000Z	ridge-meister	pgan	i thought that if the source options were turned off in Add/Remove, that it would automatically comment out those lines in sources.list.  checking the file
2007-11-18T05:38:00.000Z	ridge-meister	pgan	all the lines are commented out except for the dvd line......
