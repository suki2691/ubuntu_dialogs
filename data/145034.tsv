2007-07-06T14:56:00.000Z	stefg	psygrass	 sudo apt-get build-dep kwin-style-dekorator (btw #kubuntu is for KDE related stuff)
2007-07-06T15:00:00.000Z	psygrass	stefg	thanx.. but what if i wanted to build anything from source.. what libraries do i need to have? i couldn't find that on the net.. if someone knows a good guide, that would be great.
2007-07-06T15:01:00.000Z	stefg	psygrass	apt-get build-dep is exatly installinf all dependencies needed to *build* a package...
