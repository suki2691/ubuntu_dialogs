2005-07-02T10:45:00.000Z	chris_		I have a Toshiba Satellite 1735 laptop with a new Ubuntu install. It works fairly well with two issues so far: Sound and video. Sound I can work on later and have gotten working in the past with linux, but video always seems to be limited to 800x600, although windows does 1024x768 without a problem. Any suggestions?
