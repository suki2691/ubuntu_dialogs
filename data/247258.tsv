2005-03-04T14:08:00.000Z	pagefault	geppy	go into the sound options in gnome and uncheck load sound server at startup
2005-03-04T14:08:00.000Z	geppy	pagefault	 Done... but I'm trying to uninstall ESD, not just not use it.
2005-03-04T14:09:00.000Z	pagefault	geppy	hrm, not sure, maybe just delete it manually
