2011-03-25T23:39:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	Vilkku	i'd remove it from that machine and add it as 2nd drive to some working xp pc and then delete some stuff frome there...
2011-03-25T23:40:00.000Z	Vilkku	brontosaurusrex	good idea, but the issue is not that it is full but that it is compressed and won't boot
2011-03-25T23:40:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	Vilkku	right, i'd try #windows for further inctructions
