2009-04-09T02:46:00.000Z	nickbuntu		okay. thanks
2009-04-09T02:48:00.000Z	nickbuntu		one last question; when I ping www.google.com from ubunti i get back messages saying "from (ipaddress) icmp_seq=1++ Packet Filtered". What does the packet filtered part mean?
2009-04-09T02:49:00.000Z	blackdemon	nickbuntu	that you send a packet but get nothing back, normaly of the hosts dousn't exists you receive an RST package ...
