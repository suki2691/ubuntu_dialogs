2007-02-26T07:02:00.000Z	CP-M		Serious question for the group: Toshi Satellite P100; I can't play any audio, but it seems that the sound device is properly detected and the keyboard hotkeys even trigger muting like they should.  Any suggestions?

2007-02-26T07:03:00.000Z	CP-M	ikonia	to clarify... hotkeys work but no audio...  are you sure I need a hotkeys pack to fix it (and if so... google or Toshi site?)
