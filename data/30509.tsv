2011-12-14T00:08:00.000Z	nvz		Could anyone tell my how to disable the composite extension in ubuntu? there is no xorg.conf so Idk if making one will even be read or not
2011-12-14T00:09:00.000Z	ntr0py	nvz	maybe you could choose "without effects" session on login?
2011-12-14T00:09:00.000Z	nvz	ntr0py	no thanks you're missing my point entirely, that has absolutely nothing to do with what I am trying to do
2011-12-14T00:10:00.000Z	nvz	ntr0py	I'm using gnome and sawfish, this has nothing to do with compiz or unity.. I'm talking about an X11 extension of the Xorg server not being loaded at all
