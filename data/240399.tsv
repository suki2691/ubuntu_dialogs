2008-04-15T03:06:00.000Z	moj0rising		Hi! has anyone else had trouble getting the kernel headers from the repositories in hardy?
2008-04-15T03:07:00.000Z	moj0rising		When I try "sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r`"...
2008-04-15T03:07:00.000Z	moj0rising		...I get the error: E: Couldn't find package linux-headers-2.6.24-15-generic
2008-04-15T03:07:00.000Z	nickrud	moj0rising	that's hardy, ask about it in #ubuntu+1
