2006-06-08T12:11:00.000Z	Crembo		I have a problem with my ATI card, if I try to change resolution, nothing happens. gnome doesn't even give an error, it just asks me if I want to keep the new settings - which it hadn't changed
2006-06-08T12:11:00.000Z	Crembo		how can I even begin to diagnose this?
2006-06-08T12:12:00.000Z	__mikem	Crembo	if you want to use an ati card follow these instructions. step 1, mount card securely on wood post. Step 2, take 30 paces backward, step 3, turn, step 4 load shotgun, step 5 fire at will, step 6, buy an nvidia card
