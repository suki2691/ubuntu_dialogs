2006-06-16T15:56:00.000Z	opllpo		how can i use the hwclock instead of ntpdate ? i have seen the script hwclockfirst.sh in /etc/init.d/ is that what i want ?
2006-06-16T15:57:00.000Z	opllpo		because right now, if i have no network access my date is set to some date in 1904 and this causes all kinds of strange problems
