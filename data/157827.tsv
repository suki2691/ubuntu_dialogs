2008-10-01T01:25:00.000Z	elzoog		Hello everyone.  I was wondering if someone could help me with getting Ubuntu to see my ethernet card.
2008-10-01T01:27:00.000Z	comicinker	elzoog	so you have a network symbol in your panel?
2008-10-01T01:31:00.000Z	comicinker	elzoog	and does the network card work?
2008-10-01T01:36:00.000Z	comicinker	elzoog	sorry, I cannot help you in this case
