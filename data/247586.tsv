2005-02-26T06:57:00.000Z	mjg59	IamJacksUsername	Correct
2005-02-26T06:57:00.000Z	IamJacksUsername	mjg59	I thought I had to mount my suse harddrive because I read in a Ubuntu live article that the reviewer had to, but I think he mounted a harddisk with Windows. I'll look what the cat command says. Many many thanks
