2008-12-01T01:27:00.000Z	diffred		will upgrade from 8.04 to 8.10 in my macbook santa rosa mess up my system? (was very hard for me getting triple booting in a macbook)
2008-12-01T01:28:00.000Z	oskar-	diffred	 make a backup of the parts, that were difficult... then you may want to try it
2008-12-01T01:29:00.000Z	diffred	oskar-	the parts that were difficult were to set up correct disk partitions in order not to mess up the bootloader, can't make a backup of that heh
2008-12-01T01:31:00.000Z	oskar-	diffred	 a upgrade to 8.10 should not change anything in the partition table, but only inside the used filesystems and maybe the boot sector or mbr (like it does, when upgrading only grub, for example)
