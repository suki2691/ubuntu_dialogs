2009-06-10T14:40:00.000Z	Gustavo	cankoy	thank you. I edited the xorg.conf, and now my mouse doesn't appear to work. All I changed was the "Screen" section
2009-06-10T14:45:00.000Z	cankoy	Gustavo	then restore your old xorg.conf. I don't fathom how merely editing Screen section affects Input Devices.
