2010-08-30T02:16:00.000Z	jMyles		Is there a web-based iptables configuration solution similar to what one finds on commercial routers like the WRT54GL?  I want friends to be able to easily add port forwarding without having to figure out iptables.
2010-08-30T02:16:00.000Z	aquatsr	jMyles	what do you mean web-based?
2010-08-30T02:17:00.000Z	jMyles	aquatsr	I'd love, for example, to be able to modify port forwarding in precisely the same way that one can with an off-the-shelf router (going to http://router-address:8000)
2010-08-30T02:17:00.000Z	aquatsr	jMyles	oh I see what you mean
