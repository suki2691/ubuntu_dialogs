2010-11-12T11:01:00.000Z	MACscr_lappy		im getting the dreaded blinking cursor when trying to install ubuntu on my new mobo/ram. Happens before i can even enter anything. It boots the cd and even shows the first splash screen  (the simple purple one with two graphics at the bottom), but after that it goes to the eternal blinking cursor. Any ideas?
2010-11-12T11:01:00.000Z	denysonique	MACscr_lappy	try the alternative install cd
2010-11-12T11:01:00.000Z	denysonique	MACscr_lappy	or burn another one
2010-11-12T11:02:00.000Z	MACscr_lappy	denysonique	ive tried an install cd for ubuntu 10.4 that i have used before and another 10.10 one. both had the exact same results =/
