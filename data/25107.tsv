2010-11-04T15:22:00.000Z	mne		Hi. I have a custom apparmor rule in /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.firefox. However, each time a firefox upgrade is installed, the file gets replaced and my custom rule is overwritten. Is there a _persistent_ way to include a custom apparmor firefox rule ? I don't want to be forced to manually edit the firefox apparmor profile each time I there is a firefox upgrade

2010-11-04T15:28:00.000Z	mne	jink	I was thinking that maybe I can create my own rule that uses a generic firefox path (e.g. "/usr/lib/firefox-3.*/firefox-*bin") and then write my custom rule in there. Yet after this there would be two apparmor policy files for firefox. I'm not sure if thats ok
