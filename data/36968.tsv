2012-10-23T21:10:00.000Z	ksbalaji		Im on a livecd. HDD damaged. 1gb RAM memory only. Hence Ive removed compiz, oo and some other apps to save memory. I also wish to remove metacity and run something like jwm. Please suggest method. I cannot obviously restart the PC now running 10.4 livecd.
2012-10-23T21:11:00.000Z	ksbalaji		Ive also installed atop, smem to see mem usage. Any suggestions here please?
2012-10-23T21:11:00.000Z	NewWorld	ksbalaji	 you want to make a customised livecd?
2012-10-23T21:12:00.000Z	ksbalaji	NewWorld	nope. Just buying time till I get my HDD back.
