Ping works, ifconfig shows up but many system apps like update/firefox/etc cannot connect.  I've checked and the computer is not even trying to get out (tcpdump on firewall)  this only happens on ubuntu
2007-01-19T14:44:00.000Z	Judicata	Linuxkrn|wrk	what distro works?
2007-01-19T14:45:00.000Z	Linuxkrn|wrk	Judicata	gentoo, centos, and suse all worked fine
