2010-06-03T15:33:00.000Z	Laggie		Hi! I am trying to get my automatic activation mails from my website to Not be treated as Spam by the receivers. Is it a good way to use authenticated SMTP for this?
2010-06-03T15:33:00.000Z	ZachK_	Laggie	I'd think so
2010-06-03T15:38:00.000Z	ZachK_	Laggie	what exactly are you attempting to do?
2010-06-03T15:39:00.000Z	ZachK_	Laggie	ok
