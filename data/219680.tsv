2008-11-02T12:24:00.000Z	eazel7		does anyone knows where can I find a mono-intrepid ibex repository?
2008-11-02T12:25:00.000Z	Flannel	eazel7	mono for intrepid?
2008-11-02T12:26:00.000Z	eazel7	Flannel	right, I'd like to test some things in the 2.0 version and I don't want to mess up anything (I'm not a .deb maker, no idea on that)
2008-11-02T12:26:00.000Z	Flannel	eazel7	mono is in the regular Intrepid repos.  both 1.0 and 2.0
