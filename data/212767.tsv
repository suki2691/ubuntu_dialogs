2008-05-22T12:17:00.000Z	Helios		I want to use both Ubuntu and Kubuntu.. can anyone tell me whether it's better to install them separately or install the kubuntu-desktop directly on the ubuntu?
2008-05-22T12:17:00.000Z	Helios		ok thanks you... :)
2008-05-22T12:18:00.000Z	Helios		it will not cause any conflict?
