2011-06-06T03:30:00.000Z	Juest	Sanctusorium	you have to log in using recovery console, is a terminal, closing it ends the session
2011-06-06T03:31:00.000Z	Sanctusorium	Juest	How should I go about that?
2011-06-06T03:31:00.000Z	Juest	Sanctusorium	yes, as long you can ssh and run it, and better not removing it, maybe vnc fails if no X is there
