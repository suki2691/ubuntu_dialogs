2010-02-19T10:03:00.000Z	ankush		i am using ubuntu 9.04. i have a partition in ext3 format. If i reinstall ubuntu , will it recognise the partittion?
2010-02-19T10:04:00.000Z	Losha	ankush	yes, all versions recognize ext3. It's ext4 that's a problem....
2010-02-19T10:08:00.000Z	Losha	ankush	I'm not sure exactly what you're worried aboutasking. Can you rephrase it?
