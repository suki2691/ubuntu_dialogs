2008-04-25T11:35:00.000Z	kakalto		okay, that's all. Just wanted to verify the insanity o_o
2008-04-25T11:37:00.000Z	kakalto		is there a canonical channel? I'm awful confused as to why they've included beta5 (even labelled so, advertising beta-quality program) in their long-term ubuntu release, and yet fail to support any kubuntu as long-term.
