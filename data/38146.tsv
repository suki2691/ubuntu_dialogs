2010-01-29T21:27:00.000Z	GregUK		Hi all. I'm after some advice on deciding between Ubuntu and Debian for a server. Why would I choose Ubuntu over Debian? (I'm asking the same in #debian)
2010-01-29T21:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	GregUK	That would actually be a better question for #ubuntu-offtopic - could you take it there instead please?
2010-01-29T21:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		(since it's not strictly support-related)
2010-01-29T21:29:00.000Z	GregUK	tonyyarusso	Sorry, I didn't realise this channel was only for support. Thanks.
