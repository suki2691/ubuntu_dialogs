2008-06-04T22:09:00.000Z	YoG		hi, how do I revert to the previous kernel after update installed a newer build?
2008-06-04T22:09:00.000Z	Calibre	YoG	you should be able to boot an earlier kernel at the grub launcher menu
2008-06-04T22:10:00.000Z	YoG	Calibre	I know, thats how I found out the the previous one is better... I'd like to make that permanent...
