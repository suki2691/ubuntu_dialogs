2007-03-02T08:23:00.000Z	WannabeNewbie		Can anyone tell me how to get Kphoto through my konsole? I am new to Ubuntu and have no idea what I am doing or where to look. I am a long time user of another distro.

2007-03-02T08:25:00.000Z	WannabeNewbie	IdleOne	Thank you for the help. Also, My screen seems a bit choppy as far as windows scrolling or moving them across the screen. Is this normal in Ubuntu/Kubuntu? Or am I missing something. It never did this in my other distro.
