2007-10-20T16:27:00.000Z	Ubuntu-newb	IdleOne	what does that command do ?
2007-10-20T16:28:00.000Z	IdleOne	Ubuntu-newb	lets you choose new splash screen and such
2007-10-20T16:29:00.000Z	Ubuntu-newb	IdleOne	this is what I get when I enter the command:   There is only 1 program which provides usplash-artwork.so
