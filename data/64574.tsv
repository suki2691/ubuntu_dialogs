2010-03-29T22:24:00.000Z	lun4tic		if yes, how
2010-03-29T22:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	lun4tic	i don't think so

Hard way is you can edit your Xorg and create a NULL output for a certain resolution that will auto-disable one monitor when a particular resolution is requested (nvidia-settings doesn't really seem to like you doing this, and starts complaining when you load it up)
