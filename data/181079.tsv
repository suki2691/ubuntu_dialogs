2007-06-09T06:33:00.000Z	wulfy814		one more question for the night I've been using Dell SC430's but the NIC is no longer automatically recognized with the newer SC440's
2007-06-09T06:33:00.000Z	wulfy814		so I followed directions from the www.ubuntuforums.org , but I have to follow them again after upgrading the kernel
2007-06-09T06:34:00.000Z	wulfy814		is there any way to automate that?
