2009-05-29T22:02:00.000Z	BiosElement		Quick question, I'd like to make a desktop shortcut to tintin++ which runs via console. How can I make it bring up the console and run tt++?
2009-05-29T22:03:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	BiosElement	there is a "run in console" option
2009-05-29T22:04:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	BiosElement	actually perhaps that isn't an option anymore :(  you could use something like "xterm -e <command>" type thing
