2006-08-23T07:24:00.000Z	kq		the other day i received an auto-update of xorg-server, and when i rebooted, gdm couldn't start because of this error "ee: no device detected - fatal error: no screens found"... i tried to restore my backup of xorg.conf, but nothing... and i already tried to reconfigure xorg-server (although i don't know if i did it right; the first time i did it with aticonfig) but it doesn't work... any idea of what i should do?
