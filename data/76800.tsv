2008-10-22T00:55:00.000Z	Caleb_		Hey, I need some help.
2008-10-22T00:55:00.000Z	Caleb_		Could someone please help me?  I'm installing Ubuntu from windows desktop, so I can dual boot, because every other method I have tried has not worked.
2008-10-22T00:56:00.000Z	Caleb_		Here is my question:  Is it possible to, once I get into Ubuntu, reformat my computer and have just Ubuntu installed?
