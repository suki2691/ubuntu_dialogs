2008-10-01T02:25:00.000Z	dekushrub		i'm at college and me and my roommate have only one ethernet port. Tech Services said we couldn't use a router but hinted that we could convert our router into an ethernet splitter but then refused to tell us. Anyone know how to convert a router into ethernet splitter?
