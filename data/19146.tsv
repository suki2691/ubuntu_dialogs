2012-10-20T18:26:00.000Z	bernard__		Hello, I am not sure if this is the right place but still I'll ask. So I started to use ubuntu (Pinguy) week ago and I love it!! I am a trader and I always wanted a stable system to work with however I am using TradeInterceptor (http://tradeinterceptor.com) so it is available on ubuntu however it is based on java and Java is NOT working. I spent like 10h already googling and trying to find a way but it just won't work
