2011-04-30T03:16:00.000Z	Mac_Weber		I want to switch from apache2 to apache2-mpm-worker. If I do 'apt-get remove apache2' then install apache2-mpm-worker will it keep the old configuration? (such as vhosts)

2011-04-30T03:17:00.000Z	Mac_Weber	aj00200	what folders shall I copy?
2011-04-30T03:18:00.000Z	aj00200	Mac_Weber	I don't know. I figured you knew which files you needed to save.
