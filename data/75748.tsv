2008-11-02T09:00:00.000Z	ffej2ffej		Why is my UBUNTU server giving me a "Permission denied" message?  I am the administrator of the machine, I put most everything on there, and all of a sudden, everything I try to send returns that error message!

2008-11-02T09:01:00.000Z	ffej2ffej		BTW, I'm trying to send stuff via FTP.  I'm using the ftp client on my Macbook and vsftpd on the UBUNTU server.
