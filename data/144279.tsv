2007-11-26T07:39:00.000Z	mojo	degreseven	right-click on the workspace switcher and go to preferences
2007-11-26T07:39:00.000Z	degreseven	mojo	the only options are for number of columns and rows
2007-11-26T07:40:00.000Z	degreseven	mojo	I thought that was where it was too, but there is no option for it
