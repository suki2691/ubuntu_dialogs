2008-01-19T00:16:00.000Z	spanther	azlon	nvidia drivers sometimes have issues but thats hardly fixable through linux itself cause nobody can look inside driver code but you can be glad to have nvidia and not ati :)
2008-01-19T00:18:00.000Z	azlon	spanther	if i should be happy to have these issues compared to ati, im never going to buy an ati!
2008-01-19T00:19:00.000Z	spanther	azlon	lol xD for real i do have ATI X850XT at my tower and its just the hell :> on windows okay they work most the time (not everytime sometimes pc crashes randomly and reboots) but at linux the ATI closed source drivers are sooo damn crappy ^^
