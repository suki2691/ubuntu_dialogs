2006-06-01T13:20:00.000Z	ktogias		I see that qemu at dapper's repositories is version 0.8.0, while at qemu site vesions qemu 0.8.1 and kqemu-1.3.0pre7 are the most recent. Is the version in the repos accelerated? Should I use the dapper version, or download, compile and install the newest version from the site?
