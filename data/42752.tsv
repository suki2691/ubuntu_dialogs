2009-11-18T06:55:00.000Z	Snausages		Hi, I can't print.  Printer is an old HP postscript laser, connected to a mac os x machine acting as printserver.  Any takers?

2009-11-18T06:56:00.000Z	Snausages	mdaum	I get error writing spool: NT_status_file_lock_conflict
2009-11-18T06:57:00.000Z	Snausages	mdaum	I turned on windows sharing on the mac, seemed like the easiest way to get printing access to the linux machine
