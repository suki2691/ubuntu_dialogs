2010-09-09T23:47:00.000Z	sammy	erdnase	right click? edit menu? wine should add itself, along with anything you install

2010-09-09T23:48:00.000Z	sammy	erdnase	yeah, my experience is that wine automagically adds itself to the menu upon installation, and installing programs should add them to the wine section of the applications menu.
