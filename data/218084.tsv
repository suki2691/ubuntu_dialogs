2006-07-01T05:05:00.000Z	RememberPOL		Is there any package differences between the "Desktop/Server/Alternative" install CD ISOs available here: http://mirror.cs.umn.edu/ubuntu-releases/6.06/  (What _exactly_ is the main difference between the D/S/A derivatives?)

2006-07-01T05:10:00.000Z	RememberPOL	eobanb	Yes this will be used on a SDK/IDE laptop so I definitely want X installed but I was confused by the wording under Server intall CD..."install Ubuntu permanently on a computer" .. (as if you can't uinstall a system without X... or you can't permanently keep a system with X....) I think the server description should be in more detail, seeing as how the people who really need what it offers will actually understand
