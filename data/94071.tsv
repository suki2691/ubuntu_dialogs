2010-10-01T01:00:00.000Z	iAmTheDave		stupid question - trying to change the bash prompt for user. PS1 in ~/.bash_profile works great, but /root/.bashrc doesn't seem to run when i do "sudo -s" - am i missing something?
2010-10-01T01:01:00.000Z	iAmTheDave		i can manually "source /root/.bashrc" and i get my settings set
