2008-06-22T07:51:00.000Z	Matthew		how do I use the zoom function on a laptop
2008-06-22T07:52:00.000Z	doubled_	Matthew	windowskey + scroll
2008-06-22T07:53:00.000Z	doubled_	Matthew	connect a normal mouse, at least for me i think laptop touchpads are irritating. nevertheless, you can change keybindings for every function in compiz via the advanced settings
2008-06-22T07:55:00.000Z	Matthew	doubled_	I have a mouse, but it's not with me at this time. I'm currently changing the settings in compiz. Thank you.
