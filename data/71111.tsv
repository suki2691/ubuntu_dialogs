2009-08-24T18:27:00.000Z	g8tor		hello all I'm trying to follow http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/UserManual.html#ovf to export my winxp virtual machine but I don't see the "Export Appliance" option in the file menu. How can I export my vm to another pc? I'm using VirtualBox OSE if that matters

2009-08-24T18:30:00.000Z	g8tor	Stormx2`	do you know how I can move my vm to the closed version? or to a second ubuntu machine easily?
2009-08-24T18:30:00.000Z	Stormx2`	g8tor	I'm 99% sure you can just install the non-OSE version and it'll be fine.
