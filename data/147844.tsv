2010-08-01T01:25:00.000Z	nikitis		I'm seriously gonna cry.  I've been on this problem for 6 hours.  Can someone work with me to figure out how to get a VNC Server to load on boot and allow me to connect to it without first logging into gnome?

2010-08-01T01:27:00.000Z	jimbo_	nikitis	I've had good success with xtightvncserver in the past.
2010-08-01T01:35:00.000Z	nikitis	jimbo_	you still here?
