2005-04-20T07:17:00.000Z	apokryphos	Arc-	either. If you like GNOME stuff then gdm, if KDE -- KDM.
2005-04-20T07:19:00.000Z	apokryphos	Arc-	Yes. You can easily install GNOME from Kubuntu and KDE from Ubuntu respectively.
2005-04-20T07:20:00.000Z	apokryphos	Arc-	whoops -- sorry, didn't see you mention LiveCD. No, if you install the LiveCD you can only try out one of the desktop environments
