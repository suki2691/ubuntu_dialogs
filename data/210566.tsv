2006-10-20T09:50:00.000Z	Backu		I have an interesting dilemma.. Currently I run Ubuntu Dapper Drake on half my hard drive. The other half is empty (until this download finishes) in which I plan to install Windows XP Pro x64.. problem is, I know that when I install XP it's going to overwrite GRUB on MBR... unless there is a way to prevent that.. Any Ideas?
