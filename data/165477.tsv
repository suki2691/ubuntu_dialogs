2006-10-03T14:11:00.000Z	Benni	Jowi	sure, I've already been thinking of changing the default kernel in grub ... though I'm curious about the origin of the problem
2006-10-03T14:12:00.000Z	Jowi	Benni	got some issues with some specific kernel versions on my hardware as well. I install one, see if it is stable, switch if it is or remove it if it is not :)
2006-10-03T14:12:00.000Z	Benni	Jowi	thanks, guess I'll stick with that ...
