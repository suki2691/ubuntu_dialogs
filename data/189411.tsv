2011-05-27T03:31:00.000Z	ubuser		i was wondering if anyone could help me with my computer i am currently on ubuntu 8.04, i have tried installing every iso that is on ubuntu, but i got a 6.10 to work, and i updated to this one, i tried to update to 10.04 and it had video problems, right now all i want is my sound working
2011-05-27T03:32:00.000Z	ubuser		i got 4 gigs on ubuntu 8.04 with pae and my video settings are good, i just cant figure out the sound
2011-05-27T03:32:00.000Z	coz_	ubuser	  open up a terminal   type    alsamixer  and see if the audio card is recognized,, it should be shown at the upper left
2011-05-27T03:34:00.000Z	coz_	ubuser	 ok so it is recognized,, all I can say is check the sliders there in alsamixer,, be sure they are u p and not muted,, if muted  hit the 'm' keyboard key and use the arrows to scroll through them
