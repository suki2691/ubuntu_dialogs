2011-06-07T10:14:00.000Z	jtannenbaum		I tried to install Ubuntu on a 40gb interal HDD in my PC.. I succeeded, but now my PC can't boot without the HDD in
2011-06-07T10:14:00.000Z	jtannenbaum		a grub issue I think
2011-06-07T10:15:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	jtannenbaum	i'd say grub issue as well
2011-06-07T10:16:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	jtannenbaum	most likely grub in installed on your main HD, but the grub files are on you 40GB...  thus the problem if that drive isn't plugged in...
