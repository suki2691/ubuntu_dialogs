2006-06-19T08:54:00.000Z	meandi		this is frustrating, after following the steps here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI I need to reboot. But I have booted from CD and where are my changes stored? If I reboot from CD will the changes be lost then?
2006-06-19T08:56:00.000Z	meandi		I cannot install since the install window has buttons I have to click outside the screen. 640*480 is too small!
2006-06-19T08:57:00.000Z	meandi		so is alternate install better than desktop then?
