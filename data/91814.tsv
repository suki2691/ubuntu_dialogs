2008-05-06T21:18:00.000Z	legend2440	reduser7	 did you try this? in terminal type gconf-editor then go to /apps/gnome-screensaver   uncheck idle_activation_enabled
2008-05-06T21:26:00.000Z	reduser7	legend2440	i'm not certain it is the gnome screenserver, because on a different machine (which already had the idle_activation disabled through the normal gui), it still showed the idle-activation enabled in gconf-editor
2008-05-06T21:28:00.000Z	legend2440	reduser7	maybe something here will help. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=278693
