2005-04-03T09:39:00.000Z	shadowplay	hams2	config file should be in /boot
2005-04-03T09:39:00.000Z	hams2	shadowplay	do get the kernel source and copy over that config file and i'm good to go?
2005-04-03T09:43:00.000Z	shadowplay	hams2	: copy the config file to <sourcdir>/.config  then run make oldconfig.  If its the same kernel version you may not need to make oldconfig.
