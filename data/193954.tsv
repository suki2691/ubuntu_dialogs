2006-05-02T05:06:00.000Z	Cattack		Question about an install issue.  I want to have 3 Linux distros on the same box.   Can they share the same /boot so that Grub can load them?

2006-05-02T05:09:00.000Z	Cattack		I am planning to run FC5, SuSe, and Ubuntu on the same box but I dont want to need bootdisks for each one.
