2010-11-23T01:55:00.000Z	itissid		Hey I posted a question earlier I am in some serious trouble with GRUB on ubuntu 10.10. Could someone point me in the right direction atleast here...
2010-11-23T01:55:00.000Z	itissid		 I installed  Ubuntu 64 bit on an empty partition, windows was already there, after updates ran on ubuntu i rebooted it said "unknown commnd export_symbol" and then dropped me into a grub shell. Now to fix grub what do i do?
