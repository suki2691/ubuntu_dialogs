2010-08-26T03:45:00.000Z	ShinyDarkness_		Hello, all. Which spreadsheet is better, OpenOffice.org Calc or Gnumeric, if I want to use macros and possibly interface with third-party software, like, lpsolve?
2010-08-26T03:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ShinyDarkness_	not sure what Ipsolve is, but
2010-08-26T03:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ShinyDarkness_	OpenOffice clac is probably the better out of the two, but I haven't used either properly, and Gnumeric does seem good as well, and  theres also KOffice by the way
