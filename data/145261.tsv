2007-06-24T11:36:00.000Z	colbert		I have just formatted a drive into 3 partitions, 2 are intended as / and /home for a Feisty install i'm about to do, but I'd like to mount the drives on my Edgy right now. Can someone help?
2007-06-24T11:37:00.000Z	ryanakca	colbert	umm... why mount them? then you'd have to reformat them just in case something nasty got on them
2007-06-24T11:37:00.000Z	ryanakca	colbert	but, df, and then add the entries to /etc/fstab
2007-06-24T11:38:00.000Z	colbert	ryanakca	What do you mean by that? They're formatted, just partitioned, empty.. ready for feisty to be installed on them..
