2005-05-26T16:21:00.000Z	upro		I'm a SysAdmin at a school, and I was wondering if there's an automated way to exactly clone one instalation to other computers?
2005-05-26T16:21:00.000Z	kestas	upro	depends if the systems are fairly similar
2005-05-26T16:21:00.000Z	upro	kestas	the systems are absolutely identical
