2008-12-19T21:38:00.000Z	fde	karn`	actually, ibex would, as there will be more bugs and stuff fixed
2008-12-19T21:39:00.000Z	karn`	fde	so it would be better to get xubuntu ibex?
2008-12-19T21:39:00.000Z	fde	karn`	so less mem leaks and the like... and more work on bringing down gnomes resources
2008-12-19T21:40:00.000Z	fde	karn`	XFce doesn't have as many people - if anyone - working on the little things that make it less resource intensive... you're probably better off with Gnome if those are your choices
