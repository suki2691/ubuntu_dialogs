2012-11-12T11:33:00.000Z	Flyzoola		lotuspsychej, like I said, I doubt my computer could handle a newer version of Ubuntu. My old rig was newer by a couple of years and I still had some problems with it because it was older.
2012-11-12T11:34:00.000Z	Flyzoola		Like I said, I'm using 8.10 and when I stopped using it years back, it worked fine, as it does now. Just all my software is outdated
