2012-02-26T15:07:00.000Z	Kebabsvarvare		Hello, I've encountered a silly issue with my newly installed server. I was powering it down, giving a 5 minute warning when the power went and now I can't access it anymore... It just says "The system is going down for maintenance in 4 minutes" no matter what I do. Any suggestions?
