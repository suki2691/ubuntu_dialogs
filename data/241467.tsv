2005-07-05T15:18:00.000Z	jago25_98	budluva1	apt-get install gnump3d` does all that for you I believe
2005-07-05T15:21:00.000Z	jago25_98	budluva1	edit `/etc/gnump3d/gnump3d.conf` and you'll be read to roll. Personally I disabled .password protection in that file, and changed /var/music to /mnt/fileserver/mp3
