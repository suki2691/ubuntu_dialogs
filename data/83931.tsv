2009-08-08T12:24:00.000Z	ReubenY		Hi, could someone explain to me what this command does "mv .* .. " does it move all files in the current directory to a directory one step above?
2009-08-08T12:24:00.000Z	ReubenY		And how is this different than "mv * .. "
2009-08-08T12:24:00.000Z	lstarnes	ReubenY	it moves all files in the current directory starting with . to the parent directory
2009-08-08T12:26:00.000Z	lstarnes	ReubenY	correct
