2006-11-19T16:09:00.000Z	Ayabara		well now that I'm rid of kde I need to choose a torrent client. azureus, utorrent under wine, or transmission are the ones I'm thinking about. any advice?
2006-11-19T16:09:00.000Z	umops	Ayabara	try torrentflux.
2006-11-19T16:11:00.000Z	Ayabara	umops	I need to set up a webserver for it? what I like about utorrent and transmission(?) is that they're so lightweight
2006-11-19T16:12:00.000Z	umops	Ayabara	yes you would need to.  I guess it depends what features you want
