2007-12-09T02:22:00.000Z	ava		hello i just installed Edubuntu and there are not any close/maximize/minimize buttons in the window manager.  I have nvidia drivers installed.

2007-12-09T02:24:00.000Z	sethk	ava	generally that's a configurable parameter that can be changed in the window manager configuration.
2007-12-09T02:24:00.000Z	sethk	ava	it certainly  has nothing to do with the nvidia driver
