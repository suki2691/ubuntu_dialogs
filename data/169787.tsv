2009-07-27T23:27:00.000Z	NewProggie		Anyone knows how to get proxy settings working with firefox? Seems something is still missing :-/
2009-07-27T23:29:00.000Z	NewProggie		but I still can't connect to web, it says that there's a connection but maybe wrong proxy settings
2009-07-27T23:29:00.000Z	LordLandon	NewProggie	so set the proxy settings manually.
