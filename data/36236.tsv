2010-08-24T07:10:00.000Z	dj_segfault		Still can't get metacity to load on startup.  I rename .gconf and .gconfd, so it's not a configuration file thing.  Does anyone know what's SUPPOSED to start up metacity?

2010-08-24T07:12:00.000Z	dj_segfault	psilo2	Thanks.  I miss the days when everything launched from /etc/init.d and symlinks
