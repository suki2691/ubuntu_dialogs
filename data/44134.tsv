I installed it from the manual repository entry I had to add to sources.list, but now I'd like to remove anything that was installed from that repository.  Would I have to reinstall?
2009-11-01T00:07:00.000Z	manlymatt83		(since I don't know what was and wasn't from that repository?)
2009-11-01T00:07:00.000Z	manlymatt83		or does ubuntu keep track of where an existing installed package came from?
2009-11-01T00:09:00.000Z	hackbench	manlymatt83	i thought you can see anything you installed from synaptic, but not sure
