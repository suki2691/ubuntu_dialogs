2007-12-04T00:13:00.000Z	Sam1337		I don't use ubuntu because it's easy I use it because it supports my fairly new hardware. Does anybody else only use Ubuntu for its great hardware support?
2007-12-04T00:13:00.000Z	Sam1337		I personally think all the easy guis are noob overkill
2007-12-04T00:14:00.000Z	rbil	Sam1337	I use Ubuntu for 2 main reasons ... it uses apt, not rpm and it is bleeding edge
2007-12-04T00:15:00.000Z	Sam1337	rbil	Yeah I had problems with rpm distributions and apt is so much easier and hasslefree.
