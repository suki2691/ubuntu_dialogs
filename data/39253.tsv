2010-01-10T03:52:00.000Z	JottBe		Hi all. Can anybody help me? I can't install ubuntu on my hard drive. The dialog directly following the keyboard layout/language dialogs which should normally list partitions and hard drives is empty. Even if I start the install tool from the live cd. Pleas help. During a previous install of ubuntu on a usb stick the bootloader on this harddrive was replaced so I cant use my machine anymore!
