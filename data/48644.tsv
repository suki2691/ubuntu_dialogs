2012-05-08T03:27:00.000Z	PhotoJim		I'm not being offered an upgrade to precise (12.04LTS) from lucid (10.04LTS).  if I tell Update Manager to show all upgrade versions, it wants to upgrade to 10.10 but I'd rather do an LTS-to-LTS upgrade.  am I missing something.

2012-05-08T03:29:00.000Z	PhotoJim	Daekdroom	it's not critical.  it's a netbook and the data stick I use when I travel to the US (on T-Mobile US) isn't supported.  but I can still do EDGE and it's not bad.  I can be patient if there are issues.
