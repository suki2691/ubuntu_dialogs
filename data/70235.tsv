2009-01-04T08:39:00.000Z	the_squircle	zigzag71	you can store them anywhere.. just drag the .tar.gz to the Appearance window
2009-01-04T08:40:00.000Z	zigzag71	the_squircle	they are in a zip can I still do the same thing?
2009-01-04T08:40:00.000Z	the_squircle	zigzag71	i'm not sure. if it doesn't work, put them in a gunzipped tarball (.tar.gz)
