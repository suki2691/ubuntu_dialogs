2005-06-29T13:02:00.000Z	Mauve		Hi, I'm having trouble booting from the Hoary Install CD, I keep getting GRUB Error 15 all the time and it will not boot; I have only seen this error when my 250GB disk has been connected... Does anybody have a clue?

2005-06-29T13:05:00.000Z	Mauve	rpj911	I had the same problem when my BIOS still only detected the disk as 137GB
