2006-07-05T14:52:00.000Z	jstern		I am trying my hardest to connect to a ubuntu 6.06 machine with FreeNX installed and working, using NX Client, but says session failes after authentication and brings up this error NX> 1004 Error: nxagent failed to start with: NXAGENT: Fatal IO error on display  - Any ideas? thanks :)
2006-07-05T14:53:00.000Z	Barkley	jstern	what versions?
2006-07-05T14:54:00.000Z	Barkley	jstern	i don't have a quick answer other than just wanting to make sure you weren't using 2.0 client
