2011-05-25T03:44:00.000Z	maco	IIAir_LeoII	Glade is for GTK applications. Qt4 is different toolkit and has its own designer
2011-05-25T03:45:00.000Z	maco	IIAir_LeoII	if you're a programmer looking to pick up a new toolkit,   GTK is usually used with C, and Qt is usually used with C++, both can be used with Python, and there are Ruby bindings for GTK (but i find applications written with them can be a bit unstable, especially if threaded)
