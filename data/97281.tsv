2008-06-01T20:27:00.000Z	ImDude		there is one a little annoying thing that I can't find the settings for it since I am here for a quick stop I may s well as for it: when I have multiple windows open the windows behind the main windows becomes transparent a little, how can I remove that transparency /opacity ??
2008-06-01T20:27:00.000Z	mDemocritus	ImDude	are you using compiz?
2008-06-01T20:28:00.000Z	mDemocritus	ImDude	should be in the compiz settings.... i think there's a transparency option
2008-06-01T20:29:00.000Z	mDemocritus	ImDude	well i know it's a setting in there... i'm just not sure where... try general settings
