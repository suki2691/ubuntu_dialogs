2008-06-11T17:29:00.000Z	rampageoberon	koshari	sorry? i'm a bit confused by that, please explain
2008-06-11T17:30:00.000Z	koshari	rampageoberon	the ubuntu live cd has gpated installed by default. so if one has that they dont need the grapted live cd to use gparted
2008-06-11T17:31:00.000Z	rampageoberon	koshari	ah i see, i usually tend to use the gparted live cd, but this info will be useful. thanks :)
