2010-05-01T06:28:00.000Z	detrix		Hi.  I am trying to set up a second monitor, on a second video card.  I am working on the xorg.conf file.  I am using Jaunty, do I use Xinerama or randr?

2010-05-01T06:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	detrix	but still available
2010-05-01T06:29:00.000Z	detrix	Scunizi	I have choosen to stick with Jaunty.  karmic had too many issues with my hardware.
