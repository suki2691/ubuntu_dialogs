2009-12-13T19:03:00.000Z	Raj7681		Thanks Ubottu. My problem with Wubi Ubuntu is that I am not able to find shutdown option. I had to use shutdown now command from terminal. Is it correct method?

2009-12-13T19:07:00.000Z	Raj7681	Dr_Willis	am not getting logout option too and what is GDM? I am new to Linux world.
