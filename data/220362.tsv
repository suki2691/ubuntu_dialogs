2006-09-21T12:24:00.000Z	Flannel	wept	it's at 1.5 in breezy?  is there a backports version?
2006-09-21T12:25:00.000Z	Flannel	wept	heh, well, I... thought, it was 1.0.X in breezy, (like firefox), you'd get 1.5 upgrading to dapper.
2006-09-21T12:26:00.000Z	Flannel	wept	right, the security issues (if it's from the repository) have been rolled in
