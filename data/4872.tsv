2012-03-04T07:40:00.000Z	Cyndar	arand	tried that. i stopped X, ran sudo Xorg -configure but it said configuration failed. it still created the config file so i tried putting it in /etc/X11 and rebooting but it was still in 24bpp. did i miss a step?

2012-03-04T07:42:00.000Z	Cyndar	arand	thanks for trying. been at this for hours now.
