2005-11-26T11:01:00.000Z	CRS2117		Hello, I'm trying to install audacity, and clicking on various links I came across a Ubuntu specific install package, with a .deb extension. Archive manager says it can't open it. What am I doing wrong?

2005-11-26T11:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CRS2117	don't do that - use the package manager
2005-11-26T11:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CRS2117	if you enable the repository yes
