2010-04-21T23:42:00.000Z	luismmontielg	guntbert	no I dont think so, its not my hard drive, a friend installed /home in another partition then reinstalled dont know why and put / and /home in the same partition.. he tried to mount the /home partition from ubuntu prev install but its encripted
2010-04-21T23:42:00.000Z	luismmontielg	guntbert	we know there's the data because of the free space
2010-04-21T23:43:00.000Z	guntbert	luismmontielg	yes, but without the passphrase the data is definitely inaccessible - if it is encrypted
