2009-11-10T18:21:00.000Z	gcola	angelus	Ctrl+shift+up does nothing for me.  I can manage to change the keybindings.  I'm just trying to find the right window picker to bind to.

2009-11-10T18:24:00.000Z	angelus	gcola	huh .... well its the "Initiate windows Picker" on Keyboard shortcuts menu..... change keybinding to something viable and check it out ....
