2008-11-04T23:18:00.000Z	htnguyen		I am having problems with my bluetooth mouse. I am able to pair it properly to my laptop, and it works for that session, but as soon as I reboot the computer or turn off the mouse and turn it back on, the computer will not reconnect to the mouse. The mouse is still on the bluetooth-applet list, so it's not that the computer forgot about the mouse, it just will not connect and I have to repair it every time I want to use the mouse. Does

2008-11-04T23:18:00.000Z	`TonY	htnguyen	there is a small button at the back of the mouse called connect, try it after turning it off
