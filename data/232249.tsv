2010-03-09T01:04:00.000Z	skierKyle		Hi, I accidently lost a NTFS partition, that was at the end of my harddisk, Right now there is just 200gb of blank space where it was. What would be the best way to attempt to restore it?
2010-03-09T01:05:00.000Z	skierKyle		Can I have diskutility create a new ntfs partition where it was without formating it?
