2010-05-26T20:31:00.000Z	Kentrel		How do I see the standard output? I want to be able to see the error messages from some programs, without having to always start them from the console
2010-05-26T20:32:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Kentrel	its in ctrl-alt-f1 isn't it?
2010-05-26T20:32:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Kentrel	whatever vt you logged into has the errors log
2010-05-26T20:34:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	Kentrel	then you can just use the files in /var/log
