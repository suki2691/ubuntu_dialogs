2012-06-07T14:59:00.000Z	roshambles		I try to right click on the text to copy and paste it but I don't even have a copy command anymore. My desktop is more broken than before. I think I might just reinstall ubuntu at this rate and work around it's new interface that I don't like, compiz just worked then.
2012-06-07T15:00:00.000Z	roshambles		although the zoom does work now I've lost things like minimise/maximise/close, can't move windows and can't alt+tab and I do not see those options in the CCSM
2012-06-07T15:02:00.000Z	roshambles		If I uninstall compiz, will I get basic functionality back, like being able to move and resize windows, plus alt+tab?
