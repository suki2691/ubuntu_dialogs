2009-06-24T16:13:00.000Z	blind|melon|chit		hello again :> there's a couple of packages from karmic that i'd like to install in jaunty, what would be the best way of doing that without upgrading to karmic completely?
2009-06-24T16:13:00.000Z	bazhang	blind|melon|chit	a very bad idea
2009-06-24T16:14:00.000Z	blind|melon|chit	bazhang	I figured it probably would be :/ Unfortunately the patched version of tovid that fixes the error I'm experiencing is only available in karmic
2009-06-24T16:17:00.000Z	blind|melon|chit	bazhang	So what would be the best course of action there? Todisc in jaunty is broken at the moment, and since we're using it to transfer tapes to DVD at work we kind of need it up and running ;>
