2010-09-23T04:29:00.000Z	dibblego		how do I start an application on a specific workspace?
2010-09-23T04:30:00.000Z	edbian	dibblego	Go to that work space.  Start the app.
2010-09-23T04:30:00.000Z	dibblego	edbian	I don't want to have to manually go to that workspace
2010-09-23T04:30:00.000Z	edbian	dibblego	I am not aware of any other way.  I would be very interested if you find one :)
