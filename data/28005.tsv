2010-08-07T00:49:00.000Z	bazhang	kreme191	the grub2 wiki is quite informative
2010-08-07T00:53:00.000Z	kreme191	bazhang	i am using a live cd, but when i try to update it, like the wiki page says it says "cannot find a device for / (is /dev mounted?)." and i have my partition with linux already mounted
2010-08-07T00:54:00.000Z	kreme191	bazhang	the same thing happens when i run sudo grub-mkconfig in the folder it's contained
