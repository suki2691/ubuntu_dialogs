2012-04-19T09:00:00.000Z	Melium		Ubuntu 10.11, Oneiric, Gnome3, Display controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV535 [Radeon X1650 Series] (rev 9e). I'm having issues with my video drivers (Proprietary ones aren't supported and Open Source don't work)
2012-04-19T09:01:00.000Z	Melium		I'm hoping someone could help me find out what video card would be best for me to purchase that's within my budget and that will work with Ubuntu.
