2012-05-30T21:21:00.000Z	Eagleman		I'm having an issue with windows supporting characters in file names, i currently have this script and since windows isnt supporting : and linux isnt allowing me to replace the : with ; OUTPUTFILE="/media/usbbackupdisk/configbackups/configbackup_$(date +%m-%d-%Y_%I:%M).tar.gz"
2012-05-30T21:22:00.000Z	Eagleman		the : in _%I:%M
2012-05-30T21:23:00.000Z	Eagleman		(date +%m-%d-%Y_%I/;%M) doesnt work
2012-05-30T21:23:00.000Z	blackcatnekonegr	Eagleman	tried massive renaming the files in windows? or if you want to rename files in linux, "Purrr" while old, works well.
