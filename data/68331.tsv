2009-01-18T11:26:00.000Z	monokrome		Hi. I just got a new laptop... a Dell Studio 1735... For some reason, Ubuntu's live CD wont boot on it. It continually throws buffer errors on sr0, and after a while it goes to a shell displaying "BusyBox". If I <CTRL>+D out of the shell, the system reboots.

2009-01-18T11:28:00.000Z	strick9	monokrome	have you used this ubuntu cd before?
2009-01-18T11:28:00.000Z	monokrome	strick9	Nope. I'm going to check it for defects...
