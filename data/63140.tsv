2009-03-18T10:39:00.000Z	nefrin	halpmai	trying doing just find /grub/stage1
2009-03-18T10:40:00.000Z	halpmai	nefrin	Same error.
2009-03-18T10:42:00.000Z	nefrin	halpmai	I had that error awhile ago, meant that my grub files had be reconfigured and moved too far down the HDD to be read by the bios and I needed to reinstall and setup proper partitions. Beyond doing that, I'm at a loss
