I'm trying to set up a programming environment to learn C++, and to cut a long story short I have to install a .rpm file. the Terminal says that this is for Red Hat, and as a debian user I should use alien -Anyone care to explain?
2009-01-02T17:59:00.000Z	Seveas	Jianaran	try to find a .deb file instead...

2009-01-02T18:00:00.000Z	Seveas	Jianaran	get rid of the rpm file
