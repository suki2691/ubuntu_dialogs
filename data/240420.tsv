2006-04-30T14:58:00.000Z	PaoloC		nonix4, I mean git-core
2006-04-30T14:58:00.000Z	PaoloC		well but the shipped version has more then 2 months
2006-04-30T14:59:00.000Z	nickrud	PaoloC	freeze was about then. The advantage/disadvantage of the ubuntu distro model is stable, unchanging software except for security fixes
