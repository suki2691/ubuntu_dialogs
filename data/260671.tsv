2005-05-07T11:42:00.000Z	abarbaccia		im saying right now that the sound is not unified - you don't have a "master volume" that you can control and then apps get amplified by that...like in M$ how you have volume control that actually does something
2005-05-07T11:43:00.000Z	abarbaccia		i can mute my volume in my volume control, but amarok and xine and the rest will all go ahead and play at THEIR volumes
2005-05-07T11:43:00.000Z	yfir	abarbaccia	that shouldn't happen
