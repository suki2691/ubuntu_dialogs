2008-08-07T05:51:00.000Z	qr	kane	you should be able to get it off an install cd if you still have that
2008-08-07T05:53:00.000Z	qr	kane	since you obviously have an internet connection somewhere (ie you're on irc) you could figure out the correct version of the package you need and download it manually from the ubuntu repos on another machine and transfer it via some non-internet means... but that's a pretty roundabout way of doing things, an internet connection would be much simpler.
