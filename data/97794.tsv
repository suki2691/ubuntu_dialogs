2008-03-18T15:30:00.000Z	cool^tom		Hi.  My Right arrow key does not work.  I think it is a problem with ubuntu.  The Reason I'm so sure is because the right arrow key also is the birghten key and I can use the brighten function but I cannot move the cursor right.

2008-03-18T15:33:00.000Z	cool^tom	ActionParsnip	I do not think so.  F4 is also the suspend key.  So if function key is pressed pressing f4 should suspend the computer but that is not happening.
