2009-01-21T06:02:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash		How can I make all cron jobs sleep for 24 hours?
2009-01-21T06:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Robbie_Crash	 you could just stop the cron service  manually for a day :) and restart it later
2009-01-21T06:03:00.000Z	Robbie_Crash	Dr_willis	I'll forget :( and I can't set up a cron job to restart it... Woe is me... I guess that's the best option
2009-01-21T06:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Robbie_Crash	 write a little script that will restart it in 24 hrs. :)
