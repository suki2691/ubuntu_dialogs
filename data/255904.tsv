Can someone offer some insight on what could be the issue? Seems it doesn't respond to wlan0 (but works great with eth0)
2009-02-04T03:44:00.000Z	corey__		My AP is a little far away and I'm connected at 1Mb/s. This is causing dns resolving to be painfully slow. What are my options?

2009-02-04T03:48:00.000Z	rdw200169	corey__	yeah, but do you know if there are any packet errors over the wireless link?
