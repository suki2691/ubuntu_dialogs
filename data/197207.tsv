2010-12-23T09:13:00.000Z	Felix00		can i do something?
2010-12-23T09:14:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Felix00	have you tried asking this question in lm-sensors support channel/forum?
2010-12-23T09:15:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Felix00	I'd give them a try first, they would be more knowledgeable than trying in here first
