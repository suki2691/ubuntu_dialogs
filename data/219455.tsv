2006-08-31T16:48:00.000Z	episteme73		I've been unable to find the freevo package - added the repository, but nothing matching 'freevo' on search. your thoughts?
2006-08-31T16:49:00.000Z	Flannel	episteme73	which repository?
2006-08-31T16:50:00.000Z	Flannel	episteme73	Alright.  Well, it won't be supported, but have you updated your apt-cache? (sudo apt-get update)
2006-08-31T16:52:00.000Z	Flannel	episteme73	you'll need to ask the freevo people, since it must be a problem with their repository, or under a different name, or whatnot.
