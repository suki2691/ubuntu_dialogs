2008-03-26T11:03:00.000Z	Ayabara		I need to copy some 8GB from a samba network drive. What's the fastest way to do this? Right now I'm trying out gnomevfs-copy.

2008-03-26T11:04:00.000Z	Ayabara	brent113	I tried with nautilus yesterday. On the second file it said "failed, invalid argument", and that was it :-/
2008-03-26T11:04:00.000Z	Ayabara	brent113	I'll try mounting it
