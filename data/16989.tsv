The sort of people who replace executables are well versed in the art of blending in.  There are automated tools to generate an executable with filesize X.  (Just use a small exectuable and padding!)  SO, check the md5sum.
2012-10-30T18:10:00.000Z	_cronus_	Sebboh	no, not worried about that.
2012-10-30T18:12:00.000Z	Sebboh	_cronus_	I see.  Carry on. :)
