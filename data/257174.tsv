2005-04-02T11:14:00.000Z	BrettMeister		I would appreciate some help....
2005-04-02T11:15:00.000Z	BrettMeister		I just fouled up my root login and now I can't figure out what I typed in.  Can't get to root.
2005-04-02T11:15:00.000Z	BrettMeister		Anything short of another install?
2005-04-02T11:15:00.000Z	farruinn	BrettMeister	were you setting the root password or the user password?
