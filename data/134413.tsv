2010-03-15T03:20:00.000Z	u-foka		Doh, my bad... I have accidently created a new empty msdos patition table on my system disk with gparted :S any ideas how to restore it?
2010-03-15T03:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	u-foka	use testdisk or gpart
2010-03-15T03:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	u-foka	i weould use a specialized tool like testdisk or gpart instead of doing the calculations myself
2010-03-15T03:33:00.000Z	u-foka	erUSUL	but some of the partitions are lusk encrypted so testdisk can't found them
