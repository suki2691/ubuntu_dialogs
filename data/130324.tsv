2007-08-04T12:34:00.000Z	orbstra		hey I am running a SAMBA file server, and I am blocking all the ports with IPTABLES... but I was wondering waht I should keep open as INPUT to teh server so SAMBA should work propery
2007-08-04T12:35:00.000Z	bobsomebody	orbstra	you should check the port lists
2007-08-04T12:35:00.000Z	bobsomebody	orbstra	google "port list" and skim it
2007-08-04T12:35:00.000Z	bobsomebody	orbstra	you can also do a debug  log in IPTABLES
