2007-12-25T20:48:00.000Z	k9000		hi folks, i'm having a hard time trying to mount and browse audio cds, though they work fine with sound juicer, any hints?
2007-12-25T20:48:00.000Z	hume	k9000	audio cd's are not to be mounted
2007-12-25T20:48:00.000Z	k9000	hume	but can i still do that?
2007-12-25T20:49:00.000Z	hume	k9000	guess so, but you'll have to specify file system, mount -t isoxxx whatever it is..
