2008-10-05T00:50:00.000Z	jordon1980		NEWBIE QUESTION: when i run GPARTED, "ntfs" does not show up as a partition.  does this mean that windows is not installed on my computer?  (i thought when i installed ubuntu i partitioned rather than deleted windows, but i could be wrong.)  in other words, how can i confirm that windows is or isn't installed on my computer?  thanks!
