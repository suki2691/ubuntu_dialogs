2006-12-21T16:03:00.000Z	MystaMax		Hello, I'm looking at a shell script and it has date +%m%d%Y in it, and I was wondering if this is a system variable? and what other variables are there??
2006-12-21T16:03:00.000Z	reverseblade	MystaMax	echo $MY_VARIABLE
2006-12-21T16:04:00.000Z	MystaMax	reverseblade	I tried that and it just returned to the CLI, with no output
2006-12-21T16:05:00.000Z	reverseblade	MystaMax	then that is not a pre-defined env-var
