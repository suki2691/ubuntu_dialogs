2012-01-12T23:34:00.000Z	iceroot		how to find out why "dist-upgrade" wants to remove a package?
2012-01-12T23:35:00.000Z	sdferfx	iceroot	usually because the package has been renamed/replaced or the dependency are no longer in the distribution
2012-01-12T23:35:00.000Z	sdferfx		try searching for the package name on ubuntu packages to find out specifically?
2012-01-12T23:35:00.000Z	iceroot	sdferfx	no, i am searching for the package which is causing it
