2008-03-29T07:15:00.000Z	Nith	Nasra	you're interested in wine. I dont have any experience w/ it though
2008-03-29T07:16:00.000Z	Nasra	Nith	could it be wine...don't know since I am new to Ubuntu..
2008-03-29T07:16:00.000Z	Nith	Nasra	its definately wine, but I've never used it. Generally you can find a linux equivalent
2008-03-29T07:17:00.000Z	Nasra	Nith	you seem to understand what I want ....that is correct...
