2004-11-09T09:27:00.000Z	Mooper		I'm not big into Gnome either, but man, ubuntu + Gnome 2.8 is not all bad
2004-11-09T09:28:00.000Z	Mooper		Sarge is gonna have to be hell good to drag me back to standard debian
2004-11-09T09:29:00.000Z	cah	Mooper	it will never happen. ubuntu is so much better+easier than debian it would take a massive change in sarge to move anyone.
