2010-05-27T00:19:00.000Z	Ziber		Why would apache complain that an address was already in use when nothing's running on that port?
2010-05-27T00:21:00.000Z	jXP3	Ziber	maybe you have two different addresses, for example 0.0.0.0 and 192.168.0.1?
2010-05-27T00:22:00.000Z	Ziber	jXP3	I'm trying to get it to listen on IPv6, an address which NOTHING else is listening on...
2010-05-27T00:24:00.000Z	jXP3	Ziber	maybe this would help: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=451986
