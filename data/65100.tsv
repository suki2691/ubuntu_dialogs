2011-01-08T00:55:00.000Z	aLemmer		Hey, my controller (Logitech F310) stopped working. I test that it is working by pressing the mode button to see if the mode LED light turns on, which it no longer does. Input isn't recognized by any application, either.
2011-01-08T00:55:00.000Z	aLemmer		It used to work.
2011-01-08T00:55:00.000Z	aLemmer		Just fine.
2011-01-08T00:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	aLemmer	is this a joystick?  check /dev/input as see if there is a js0 listed.
