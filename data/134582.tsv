2008-11-12T23:08:00.000Z	hwilde	m0u5e	you just have to add it to /etc/fstab
2008-11-12T23:08:00.000Z	m0u5e	hwilde	i want to retain permissions on the drive though... so that only I can mount it :x
2008-11-12T23:09:00.000Z	m0u5e	hwilde	i like the new authorizations system... and I want to use it, i just want to be able to automount under my username
