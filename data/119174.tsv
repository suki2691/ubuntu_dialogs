2008-07-27T15:05:00.000Z	theclaw		My fonts in ubuntu 8.04 are too much "blurry", I made a screenshot here: http://img66.imageshack.us/img66/8955/20080727115925614x111scvt9.png . Hinting already is set to "strong"
2008-07-27T15:05:00.000Z	theclaw		What to do about it?
2008-07-27T15:05:00.000Z	bazhang	theclaw	looks fine here
2008-07-27T15:06:00.000Z	theclaw	bazhang	Angel-SL: i want it more "sharpened", as far as I can remember it was a lot sharper as I used debian
