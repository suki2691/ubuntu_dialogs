2009-12-11T15:04:00.000Z	nibbler	Zsoci	i dont understand you. you want to install "from source"?
2009-12-11T15:06:00.000Z	nibbler	Zsoci	so you want to install a program, that is *not* in the repository of ubuntu, but you can access the sourcecode of it?
2009-12-11T15:08:00.000Z	nibbler	Zsoci	ok, that means you want to build an apt-package, which is not trivial. maybe try searching ppa for this program - possibly someone else did the work already (but this would involve trusting this random person)
