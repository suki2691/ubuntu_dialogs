2009-01-11T01:13:00.000Z	Bax	Gnea	it's the only route I can go according to previous advice I've received.  No one can explain to me how to redirect my upgrade manager to the old.ubuntu files
2009-01-11T01:13:00.000Z	Gnea	Bax	see what nickrud told you, that should work... might take a bit of work tho
