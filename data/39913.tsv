2010-09-13T11:37:00.000Z	NewDroidOrder		alright cool, I just installd ubuntu for the first time. and when i try to download anything, like say: IRC, or any other application, i get notified that there is no more space left. I have about 200 gigs out of my 500gig HDD used so im unsure why im getting this. as of right now i am back on my win7 for now just so i can try to get some help.
