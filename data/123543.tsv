2007-10-28T01:08:00.000Z	RDP		I have a problem with partitioning my HDD
2007-10-28T01:10:00.000Z	RDP		Could someone please help me with this? I am trying to switch to ubuntu form Windows but when I started to install I accidentally had the installer use my whole HDD so it deleted the partition with all my data in it (I had an ubuntu, swap, and data partiton) Can I get this partition back?
