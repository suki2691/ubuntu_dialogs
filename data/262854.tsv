2006-05-01T06:13:00.000Z	Bog_		does anyone know the minimal install to get VMWare server to run?
2006-05-01T06:15:00.000Z	Bog_		what is the remote desktop in system preferences?  VNC?
2006-05-01T06:15:00.000Z	bwlang	Bog_	uh... you just install it using their install.sh  should be fine.  ( i couldn't get it running on 64 bit though)
