2012-04-10T00:41:00.000Z	chris_mh		I'm looking at ubuntu core, but I'm unsure whether that will have much, if any, of the usual commandline utilities
2012-04-10T00:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chris_mh	there is a minimal ISO (12Mb), it's not the best but it's one way
2012-04-10T00:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	chris_mh	minimal install kernel+drivers+boot loader+some CLI tools. That's it
