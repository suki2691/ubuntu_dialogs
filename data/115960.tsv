2007-10-20T07:48:00.000Z	Pakl		When I try to install Ubuntu Server 7.10 under Parallels (build 3188) I get "Your installation CD-ROM couldn't be mounted."  Any way around this problem?
2007-10-20T07:49:00.000Z	Pakl		(Clearly the CD-ROM was originally mounted because it loaded the installation program... so why can't it "mount" it?)
2007-10-20T07:50:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Pakl	That sounds like something that used to occur with the Alternate CD install.. check this bug #143958
2007-10-20T07:51:00.000Z	Pakl	IntuitiveNipple	 Thank you I will check it.
