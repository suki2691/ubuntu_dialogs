2010-07-17T01:03:00.000Z	oCean_	portuguese	./configure is often used when compiling software from source.
2010-07-17T01:12:00.000Z	oCean_	portuguese	like: cd /opt/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.x.x
2010-07-17T01:21:00.000Z	oCean_	portuguese	I had a look at the URL you showed, you actually have to download 2 things: besides the arms-toolchains, you also have to download qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.x.x.tar.gz from qt.nokia, not sure if you read that. But anyway, we're really getting offtopic here.
