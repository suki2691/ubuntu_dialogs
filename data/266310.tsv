2012-06-17T10:27:00.000Z	ProtekNickz		got a slight prob, if anyone can help, i installed Gnome to to see what it was like, which went fine, but when i uninstalled it "sudo apt-get remove gnome-shell" then rebooted, the login screen still has gnome and gnome classic on their, how do i remove them? im using ubuntu 12.04
2012-06-17T10:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ProtekNickz	 install the 'ubuntu-desktop' package should pull in all needed stuff.
2012-06-17T10:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ProtekNickz	 the packatge manager tools have a purge option to clean out all system configs.
2012-06-17T10:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ProtekNickz	 i use both at times..  i keep them both installed because of the way themes and so forth work
