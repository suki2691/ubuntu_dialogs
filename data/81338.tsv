2009-07-08T19:39:00.000Z	savid		I received a hack complaint from someone originating on my server.  Apparently it was a bunch of brute-force ssh login attempts.   I've done a rootkit check using rkhunter and chkrootkit, and nothing's turned up yet.   Any suggestions as to how I can figure out how my ubuntu server was comprimised?
