2009-01-19T02:58:00.000Z	CyberGabber	Pierre_N	Did you right-click on nm-aplet, and mark 'enable wireless' ?
2009-01-19T02:59:00.000Z	Pierre_N	CyberGabber	yep, I can see a zillion access points, just not my own for some reason. Trying to connect to it via Connect to Hidden Network isn't working either
