2009-10-12T01:22:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	Drop_tables	look under packages.ubuntu.com
2009-10-12T01:23:00.000Z	Drop_tables	GodfatherofEire	Ok but there is a post install firmware download that fails without a net connection
2009-10-12T01:23:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	Drop_tables	make sure you download all the dependencies when you download that package (From a computer that actually has a connection obviously)
