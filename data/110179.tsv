2008-01-26T15:59:00.000Z	compwiz18	soroush	Ubuntu doesn't have a firewall that blocks pings by default
2008-01-26T16:00:00.000Z	soroush	compwiz18	thanks and sorry but others in my network can't ping me
2008-01-26T16:01:00.000Z	compwiz18	soroush	you have all the network settings such as netmask, ip, etc correct?
