2011-12-01T02:40:00.000Z	nelson777br		let me tell you what I really want: my system is reporting different free disk space in baobab, df and gdmap. I have a 300gb disk and df reports 0 bytes of free disk space. Baobab reports that I'm only using 57gb of disk space, even when I used with sudo baobab. So I think there is a possibility of some user with system credential can be hidding some files from me. So I want to login as system to see if the results are different
2011-12-01T02:40:00.000Z	nelson777br		also baobab and gdmap are reporting 15 gb free
