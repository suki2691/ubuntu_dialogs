2007-04-20T07:28:00.000Z	MaximusBrood		I'm trying to forward a port for uTorrent. This is TCP 38806. I already tried a few times using iptables, but it never worked. Could someone please guide me through it or redirect me to a good guide? The connection is set up like this: DSL (ppp0) -> Xubuntu Server -> Other computer

2007-04-20T07:29:00.000Z	zaggynl	MaximusBrood	and if it isn't installed, install firestarter first :P
2007-04-20T07:29:00.000Z	MaximusBrood	zaggynl	That sounded too easy to be true, trying now :)
