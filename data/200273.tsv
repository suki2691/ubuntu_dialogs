2006-01-22T07:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Stewart4071	shipit has been shipping Breezy CDs since October last year :)
2006-01-22T07:34:00.000Z	Stewart4071	thoreauputic	- oh ok... I will have to check my shipit account details to make sure I get some CD's - isn't Ubuntu on a six month schedule though? So by the time I'd probably get the CD's they'll be on the next release.
2006-01-22T07:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Stewart4071	not sure when Dapper will ship - presumably in late April after release
