2009-11-04T16:00:00.000Z	danisahne		why is there an update-grub and a update-grub2 ?
2009-11-04T16:01:00.000Z	danisahne		which on is the right or is it the same
2009-11-04T16:02:00.000Z	danisahne		but why is update-grub given ? kubuntu 9.10 just uses grub2 from the start
2009-11-04T16:02:00.000Z	Slart	danisahne	perhaps it's just there for compatability
