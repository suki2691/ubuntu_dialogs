2010-04-28T19:32:00.000Z	Glowball		Hi. I'm on an old pc with Intrepid... Just wondering what would happen if I delete these repositories and add Karmic's/Lucid's instead
2010-04-28T19:33:00.000Z	coz_	Glowball	 well you may run into issues you were not expecting.... I would suggest just a clean install of lucid after it's release
2010-04-28T19:34:00.000Z	Glowball	coz_	was already planning to do that :) So actually, I can try it, since it needs a reinstall anyway
2010-04-28T19:34:00.000Z	coz_	Glowball	 there you go   I think you will be much happier with aclean install :)
