2006-07-27T14:42:00.000Z	gdb	Gr3gNobl3	Is the issue that it only sees one cpu?
2006-07-27T14:43:00.000Z	Gr3gNobl3	gdb	no, i fixed that :) my problem is that it is not clocking down... its like at a constant 1.83ghz and my laptops getting extremely hot! it doesnt overheat its just that there has to be a way to get it to clock down like in windows, right?
2006-07-27T14:43:00.000Z	gdb	Gr3gNobl3	Ah, that I can't answer.  Sorry!
