2012-02-13T01:10:00.000Z	its_falling		Hi, I'm an Ubuntu newbie - could you let me know why 32 bit ubuntu is listed as recommended, but 64 bit ubuntu is not?
2012-02-13T01:11:00.000Z	auronandace	its_falling	because the 32bit one works on both
2012-02-13T01:12:00.000Z	auronandace	its_falling	yes, works great here
2012-02-13T01:13:00.000Z	auronandace	its_falling	its meant to be more of a preview
