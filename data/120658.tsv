2008-02-21T18:29:00.000Z	Blastur		hi.. is there anyway i can select which packages i want to be installed for my ubuntu install? it seems to install a lot of apps which i never use. In debian, I used to be able to pick packages manually, and let it download/install only those.. is this possible in ubuntu?

2008-02-21T18:33:00.000Z	Blastur		okay.. and what does the basics include?
