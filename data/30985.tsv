2011-05-03T09:32:00.000Z	Snakkah		I decided to switch back to 10.04 as I'm not too pleased with the new Unity interface and for stability reasons, but I was wondering if there would be any harm in upgrading to the latest 2.6.38 kernel on my 10.04 install. What do you all think?
2011-05-03T09:34:00.000Z	marenostrum	Snakkah	Why don't you plainly use "Ubuntu Classic" interface instead of downgrading?
2011-05-03T09:37:00.000Z	Snakkah	marenostrum	I did that at first, but even there I noticed some annoying Compiz bugs even in the "Classic" interface in the new release. Along with that, multiple burns of the Live CD would not boot into the live environment at all. As far as I'm concerned, Canonical still needs to work out some bugs before I consider 11.04 again.
2011-05-03T09:38:00.000Z	marenostrum	Snakkah	I see; I don't know the answer of your original question.
