2008-06-30T13:36:00.000Z	Zaronn		I am thinking about changing my office from xp to unbuntu, but am scared of using the server.  How touch will it be to set it up? Mostly as a firewall/proxy and cache
2008-06-30T13:37:00.000Z	Zaronn		touch = tough
2008-06-30T13:37:00.000Z	eftex	Zaronn	why not use the normal desktop distribution?
