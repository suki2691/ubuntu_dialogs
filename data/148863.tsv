2007-02-05T06:00:00.000Z	unop	GigaClon	 well, the mount manpage has an option named "owner" that allows the owner of a device to mount it .. which effectively gives you what you want
2007-02-05T06:01:00.000Z	unop	GigaClon	 you can edit /etc/fstab in your editor -- sudo gedit /etc/fstab
2007-02-05T06:03:00.000Z	unop	GigaClon	 you can use either or .. device names or UUIDs
