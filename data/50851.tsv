2009-10-01T10:57:00.000Z	Wiseman		Help!  I was transferring files to my external hard drive and it froze!  Am I gonna corrupt everything on there if I pull it out?  I can't unmount it or anything.
2009-10-01T10:59:00.000Z	Wiseman		wait wait wat mnaines, are you saying the latest technology may not be as stable as older technology initially?
2009-10-01T10:59:00.000Z	Wiseman		so can anyone help?  I don't want to corrupt my external HDD
2009-10-01T11:00:00.000Z	mnaines	Wiseman	That's always the way it is...Newer technology is still buggy and less stable compared to older, proven technology...SSDs are still only about as fast as standard hard drives, they still use as much power as standard hard drives, and you have to zero them out periodically
