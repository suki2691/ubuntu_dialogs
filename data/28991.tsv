2010-07-24T23:05:00.000Z	froschi		whoah. now i got a very different prblem. i have a keyboard with a broken 'return' key... <enter> on the numpad is fine... this works ok in regular use, shell, editing, etc... only in 'less' in the shell when searching with '/', i cannot 'enter' the query.... what can i change (except for the keyboard?) (it gives /ESCOM there, when i 'enter' following '/', which is strange since the hardware vendor 'escom' doesn't exist for 10++ years here in germany)
