2010-02-15T13:42:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	opensanta	that's probably the biggest advantage VirtualBox has over KVM right now - Bridge networking is just a click away in VBox -- and a big pain under KVM.  I did it a couple years ago - don't remember the steps at all sorry

2010-02-15T13:46:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	opensanta	as i said it's been years i really don't remember (haven't had KVM or Qemu installed since VBox took me over)
