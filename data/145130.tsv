2007-03-17T10:21:00.000Z	Hobbsee	Alonea	probably a fault of the binary drivers, then.  might need to remove them.
2007-03-17T10:22:00.000Z	Alonea	Hobbsee	umm, no, I NEED my 3d acceleration. I have apps and screensavers that wont work without it. I saw other people had this too, but the acpi=off noacpi thing doesn't work for me
2007-03-17T10:23:00.000Z	Hobbsee	Alonea	right.  unfortunately, ubuntu cant fix the binary drivers, so you're kind of stuck, if it's a bug in the binary driver
