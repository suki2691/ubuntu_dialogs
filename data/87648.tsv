2008-06-19T00:57:00.000Z	Luig1		In GRUB, I can now choose between three kernels: 2.6.24-16,-18 and -19. Will any of these ever be deleted? I ask because I seem to have some troubles with -18, and don't want -16 to be deleted.

2008-06-19T00:58:00.000Z	Luig1	jameslr	Ok, thanks!
2008-06-19T00:58:00.000Z	jameslr	Luig1	there is an option in the menu.lst file to only show a certain number of the installed kernels
