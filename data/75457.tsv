2008-11-04T08:22:00.000Z	sar4j		I (and a few others) have found an issue where there is a slow login in INTREPID Ibex. Ibex solved a lot of issues. This however is a little annoying. I have put everything in one blog post, can some one help. http://blog.sarathonline.com/2008/11/slow-login-intrepid-ibex-x-is-problem.html
