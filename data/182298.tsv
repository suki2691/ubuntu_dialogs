2008-03-30T21:06:00.000Z	Kaapman		Hi all - I am installing the 7.10 ubntu - the second screen came up about 2 1/5 hours after the fiirst screen - ie the 1st where you choose to install and the second the desktop screen with the two icons of examples and install - is this normal to take so long?

2008-03-30T21:29:00.000Z	stefg	Kaapman	ubuntu/kubuntu have a minimal 256 MB requirement, and i would say you need at leat 384... so xubunt is the only thing making sense... and make sure to use the alternate install CD, not the Desktop
