2008-01-15T01:12:00.000Z	fatih_		Hello I have a problem with linuxdc++. When i am downloading with high speed > 1 mbps, disk is overloading and every process is getting slower included downloading. Some ideas??
2008-01-15T01:14:00.000Z	ompaul	fatih_	run vmstat 10 and do man vmstat - it should tell you the bottle neck and you can give it more disk / ram / cpu as your pocket figures out
