2006-05-27T09:17:00.000Z	neoncode		I was trying to plug a usb cable into the back of my computer and I pushed on the front of the computer for support. My hand sliped and I hit the power button. I didnt want it to turn off so I held it down while I was thinking and i forgot that holding down the power button cuts the power. I guess I knocked the monitor cable
