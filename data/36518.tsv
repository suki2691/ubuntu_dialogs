2010-03-04T04:56:00.000Z	GeekSquid	Elrox	you're incorrect, compiz after Jaunty does not support ATI ... I have a very low end ATI graphics card, yet compiz runs beautifully on my computer running Jaunty
2010-03-04T04:58:00.000Z	Elrox	GeekSquid	you are incorrect, i work directly with Novell, AMD, ATI, devs, and they do NOT officially support compiz at this time, i asked them again last week when this will come and got the same answer and last month, last quarter, last year... "soon"
2010-03-04T05:05:00.000Z	GeekSquid	Elrox	Officially, it may not be supported, however, it runs beautifully here... Perhaps because the manufacturer of this particular laptop did some extra stuff that makes it possible... Either way, I believe it is Compiz that should be supporting the hardware, not the other way around, AMD, ATI, Novell (which is SUSE i.e. redhat) are not in the market of supporting software companies, while they provide SDK's and API's to communicate with their softw
2010-03-04T05:07:00.000Z	Elrox	GeekSquid	ATI dev is the one i was referring to, the others are independent from them
