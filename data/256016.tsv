2004-12-09T15:42:00.000Z	jelte		Hi all... just installed ubuntu and it looks good. Just a quick question. I'd like to install muine the music player, but synaptic doesn't list it. Should i add something to my sources.list?  i'm a little worried that that will screw things up with regards to using the 'smart upgrade' of synaptic.. since it might make different decisions if i have more repositories than just the ubuntu ones?

2004-12-09T15:43:00.000Z	jelte	Hikaru79	well that was my second option... just wondering if its not easier/better to just use synaptic/apt .. its what its designed for i s'pose ;-)
