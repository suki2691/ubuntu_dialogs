2006-06-21T06:22:00.000Z	Ng	pcfan	commands? most programs don't execute other commands, they call library functions
2006-06-21T06:24:00.000Z	Ng	pcfan	it might be easier if you tell us what you're actually trying to do
2006-06-21T06:26:00.000Z	Ng	pcfan	there should be - I installed it with sudo, but I can run it fine as my user
