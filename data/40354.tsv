2011-01-01T11:19:00.000Z	usaguy987		alright- but they can all be installed? I ask this because I am reading "teach yourself unix in a week" by dave taylor, and I need a good distro with all the commands he talks about. I have Puppy linux now, and most of the commands he uses in the book do not work on it....

2011-01-01T11:24:00.000Z	dnivra	usaguy987	any distro with a CLI. since he says telnet, you choose any distro. read his command, run it, get an error find out what's wrong and try fixing it. google will help a lot here. the tools as rww should be there and installable. you'll have slight hiccups only mostly but you'll get along fine.
