2008-04-29T01:09:00.000Z	Mimi		QUESTION: |   I just installed Ubuntu 8.04, but I can't boot, it says "Unable to Boot - Use a kernel appropriate for this CPU". I get the same message if I try recovery mode. What can I do?
2008-04-29T01:09:00.000Z	Amaranth	Mimi	Did you install the amd64 version on an x86?
2008-04-29T01:09:00.000Z	Mimi	Amaranth	 I did not, I have a intel :P so I use x86
2008-04-29T01:10:00.000Z	Mimi	Amaranth	 I still have the ISO on my desktop and it says it's i386
