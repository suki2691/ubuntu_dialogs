2010-03-08T21:27:00.000Z	cellofellow	demonspork_	probably could pull that off with pam, /etc/securlty/limits.conf
2010-03-08T21:34:00.000Z	demonspork_	cellofellow	thank you for the input, but unfortunately, that does everything but what I need :(
2010-03-08T21:34:00.000Z	cellofellow	demonspork_	ah, too bad.
