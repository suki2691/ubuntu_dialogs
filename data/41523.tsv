2009-12-01T05:34:00.000Z	Bolvadur2	higuy2071	I updated 2 computers from 8.04 to 9.10 and it took hours and in the end both systems rendered a bit more sluggish than they should be compared to a fresh install
2009-12-01T05:35:00.000Z	Bolvadur2	higuy2071	download and burn the 9.10 cd and install it from scratch
