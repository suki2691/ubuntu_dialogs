2011-02-20T16:45:00.000Z	mats		I have 2 computers at home. I made an ssh connection from one to another but I don't know how to open some gui application from terminal which will work after i close my ssh connection. Can someone help me? I tried "screen" and it kinda works but then i get a application window on client computer, not server computer
