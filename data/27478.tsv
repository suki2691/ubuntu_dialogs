2010-10-22T16:02:00.000Z	ynk		how do i install a package from a tar.gz file? tried googling, but all i could come up with was using "pkg_add" or "./" ?

2010-10-22T16:05:00.000Z	ynk	Diamondcite	i am trying to install Eclipse Helios. i noticed the one in synaptic isn't "bleeding edge". I want the latest version.
