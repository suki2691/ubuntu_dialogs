2009-01-20T16:04:00.000Z	rdw200169	Gotu	developers basically integrated all the windows dll files (re-engineered) for the linux kernel backend, among other things.  this way, windows apps *think* they're running in windows when in actuality they were always running in linux
2009-01-20T16:05:00.000Z	rdw200169	Gotu	on a side point, the wine devs have worked long and hard to dispel the notion that wine is an 'emulator'.  it's not.  and, they deserve a whole heck of a lot of credit for what they've accomplished
