2011-05-02T22:08:00.000Z	Lxndr		Dear Ubuntu: How can I make the launcher work like older editions? I'm frustrated that I need to alt-tab to get to my various windows, and would like to actually see tabs for my various windows on the bottom, as I used to do. Is there a setting that allows this, or am I stuck alt-tabbing forever?

2011-05-02T22:09:00.000Z	Lxndr	LjL	Sounds good. How do I get to that? Will I need to log out and back in?
2011-05-02T22:09:00.000Z	LjL	Lxndr	yes
