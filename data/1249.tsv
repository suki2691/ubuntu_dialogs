2012-09-06T02:26:00.000Z	sporkbox		Is it true that Ubuntu is not adopting systemd? I'm looking for distros that aren't switching (or forcing users to switch to it).

2012-09-06T02:27:00.000Z	sporkbox	dr_willis	Alright, cool. Do you know any other distros that aren't switching? Gentoo's sticking with OpenRC for now and there's a lot of opposition to systemd there (good news for me)
2012-09-06T02:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	sporkbox	 i belive they are eventually  switching. perhaps in the next lts.. hard to tell
