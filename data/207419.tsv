2006-06-27T09:52:00.000Z	lightstar	varsendagger	edit /etc/apt/sources.list and change all reference from breezy to dapper; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y
2006-06-27T09:53:00.000Z	varsendagger	lightstar	would the DShepherd method work too ?
2006-06-27T09:53:00.000Z	lightstar	varsendagger	sorry not familiar with that
