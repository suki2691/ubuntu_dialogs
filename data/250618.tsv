2006-12-16T06:11:00.000Z	ValMarko		I dont understan. Firefox doesnt recognize flash plugin but mozilla can. In other words, I can watch videos from youtube using but nothing happens when I use Firefox. What the solution?
2006-12-16T06:13:00.000Z	kudzubane	ValMarko	download the flash plugin manually, and install manually, this worked for me
2006-12-16T06:14:00.000Z	kudzubane	ValMarko	plugin package didn't work for me either under firefox
2006-12-16T06:19:00.000Z	kudzubane	ValMarko	go to the flash page (http://www.flash.com) and click on any of the get flash player buttons
