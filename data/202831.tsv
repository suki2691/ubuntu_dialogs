2012-07-23T12:34:00.000Z	timfrost	HungryMan	what is the issue with the interaction between the process and apparmor?
2012-07-23T12:38:00.000Z	timfrost	HungryMan	 what is the issue that you hav?

Symlinks in /etc/init.d won't have the same effect.  /etc/init.d is where a traditional script would be installed, with symlinks named Sxx... or Kxx.... to start (Sxx) or stop (Kxx) the job in given run levels (the x in RCx.d)
