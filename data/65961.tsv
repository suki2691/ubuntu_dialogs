2011-10-01T00:01:00.000Z	illio		I'm having trouble with my Ubuntu install. When the machine starts up the desktop doesn't respond and I have to do "dbus-launch nautilus" to launch a file manager. Also Thunderbird has stopped displaying my mail boxes, even though the settings show they still exist (and I can send email through them).. Both errors happended at the exact same time, just after an update about 1 month ago.
