2011-11-17T03:08:00.000Z	GatorAlli		Hello, I am running Ubuntu 11.04 x64 on a Mac Pro. Almost everything is working fine, except for the wireless connectivity. The Internet connection always stops for a couple minutes then goes for a couple minutes in a random cycle. I tried several USB wireless adapters, but the problem still persisted. How do I fix this problem?
