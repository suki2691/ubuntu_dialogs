2006-12-26T13:42:00.000Z	madd_matt		:( I'm trying to convince a computer i've got here to boot my kubuntu edgy install DVD -- It doesn't want to.  I can boot damn small linux from the adjacent CDrom drive fine, but it doesn't want to boot the DVD.

2006-12-26T13:44:00.000Z	madd_matt	gaten	My BIOS is set.  I've also tried smart boot manager, but it won't boot the DVD either.  Do boot floppies exist for (k)ubuntu?
