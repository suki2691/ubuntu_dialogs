2010-11-13T08:27:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Maahes	in gnome-terminal copy/paste is done with CTRL+SHIFT+C/V :D and F10 should access the menus... sorry for interruption :D
2010-11-13T08:28:00.000Z	Maahes	MeanEYE	I know that. but alt+h brings up help, even though I have "access menus from keys" turned off. This means I can't use alt+h in insert mode in vim
2010-11-13T08:29:00.000Z	MeanEYE	Maahes	ooh, sorry... I just saw few messages and tried to help on a hunch :D...
