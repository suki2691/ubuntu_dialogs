2006-07-07T16:08:00.000Z	avis		i've often wondered if i could connect to my router both wirelessly and wired.

2006-07-07T16:11:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	avis	?? didn't understand the question. Once you have an AP and channel, the rest works like any other network interface, you have an IP and stuff.. you can dhcp it or set it statically.
2006-07-07T16:13:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	avis	it'll scan them all until it finds an AP
