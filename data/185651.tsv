2006-11-21T16:10:00.000Z	digitalmouse		sorry to spam IRC- just looking for a bit of direction for a little problem:  I'm searching through the ubuntu forums and starting to branch out through other distros for a quick answer for this:  any easy way to enable remote desktop for all users at boot-up?  at the moment I have an internet accessible computer in a 'troubled childrens home' and the staff want to be able to see what the kids are surfing from the comfort of their office
