2007-04-22T13:43:00.000Z	bullgard4		http://en.linuxreviews.org/Bitlbee advises: "/connect im.bitlbee.org; /j #bitlbee." I have executed this. It continues advising: "help commands." This only lists the well-known irssi commands. It continues advising: "help quickstart," but irssi replies: "No help for quickstart." How to get rid of that message?

2007-04-22T13:45:00.000Z	bullgard4	mjc	I will give it a try.
2007-04-22T13:47:00.000Z	bullgard4	mjc	It works without the / in front. Thank you.
