2008-05-26T05:21:00.000Z	Weng		I'm running 8.04 on a laptop that previously ran 7.10 flawlessly. However, under 8.04, my memory usage sitting at the desktop, doing nothing, straight out of the box, is over 300mb
2008-05-26T05:21:00.000Z	Weng		On a laptop with only 512mb of RAM and a small swap partition, this is a huge problem.

2008-05-26T05:22:00.000Z	martyn_	Weng	- yeah. I have reverted to ff2. Wasn't keen on the beta.
