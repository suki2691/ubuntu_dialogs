2009-05-24T18:59:00.000Z	b0hne		erusul is it in the testdisk package?
2009-05-24T19:00:00.000Z	giovani	b0hne	scalpel is a fine tool ... doubtful anything else will do better
2009-05-24T19:01:00.000Z	b0hne	giovani	seems that  i dont know how to use it. im looking especially for a file without extension. like id_rsa :P
