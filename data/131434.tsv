2007-06-08T05:53:00.000Z	waterloo		ok so very quickly.....the extended partition is a 20gig fat32 with a logical drive of the same sie in it......and there's 20gigs of free space....where i can't create more than two partitions....deleting the extended partition is not an option cuz i have data i need there
2007-06-08T05:54:00.000Z	luke-jr_	waterloo	deleting the partition doesn't delete the data
2007-06-08T05:54:00.000Z	luke-jr_	waterloo	just be careful to put the new partition in the same place
2007-06-08T05:55:00.000Z	luke-jr_	waterloo	delete it and remake it :)
