2011-08-09T06:03:00.000Z	Anom01y		I have the sunyeah I've installed  sun-java6-plugin jun-java6-jre and sun-java6-bin, I've manually instaled it as well and tried making a symlink to the .so file in ~/.mozilla/firefox/plugins like java says to do, but nothing is working. I also followd info on the link provided by typing !java, but firefox still doesn't show anything in its "plugins" section in add-ons.  any ideas ?
