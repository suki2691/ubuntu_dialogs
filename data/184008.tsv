2010-11-18T00:41:00.000Z	puddles		thepub: so different wndow manager => different key bindings
2010-11-18T00:42:00.000Z	ThePub	puddles	that isn't indicated at all!  so how do I get these shortcuts to work again?
2010-11-18T00:44:00.000Z	ThePub	puddles	if all I'm after is some window shadows could enabling compositing window manager for metacity be sufficient?
