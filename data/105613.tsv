2009-03-08T22:27:00.000Z	Masamune		Is recompiling easy?
2009-03-08T22:29:00.000Z	wassy121	Masamune	 Recompiling software properly is not easy :(  You have to hope someone else has it properly set up/compiled/packaged for your distro already.
2009-03-08T22:34:00.000Z	wassy121	Masamune	Yeah, the differences between distributions like RedHat versus Ubuntu are large.  However, ubuntu and kubuntu are both built on the "ubuntu base", thus making them and their packages nearly exactly the same.  kubuntu just puts a different face on the GUI.
