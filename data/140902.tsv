2009-05-24T19:17:00.000Z	Slart	giovani	possible.. I have no idea.. but the original poster asked about sendmail
2009-05-24T19:17:00.000Z	giovani	Slart	they are standard smtp and submission ports -- sendmail uses them, so does every other smtp server on the planet
2009-05-24T19:19:00.000Z	Slart	giovani	ok ok, I believe you =)
