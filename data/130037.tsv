2009-02-17T02:03:00.000Z	_b_r_a_d_		is there a linux equivalent of scandisk to check the hard disk for errors and correct them?
2009-02-17T02:03:00.000Z	_b_r_a_d_		thanks dayo
2009-02-17T02:04:00.000Z	korny	_b_r_a_d_	 do you want to check the hardware or the filesystem?
2009-02-17T02:06:00.000Z	korny	_b_r_a_d_	 for a hardwarecheck i recommend the tools of your harddiskmanufactor and maybe badblocks (make a backup first!)
