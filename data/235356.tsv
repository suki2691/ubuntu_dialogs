2006-07-27T05:36:00.000Z	Ubuntu_Mac		Hey all. I'm trying to install Dapper Drake on a G4 PowerPC and am having some difficulty. Anybody want to help walk me through it?
2006-07-27T05:37:00.000Z	Ubuntu_Mac		It loads up properly.
2006-07-27T05:37:00.000Z	Ubuntu_Mac		It's just that whenever I try to boot live, or live-powerpc, or anything, I get a white screen and nothing happens.
2006-07-27T05:38:00.000Z	Madpilot	Ubuntu_Mac	do  you get to the initial menu screen?
