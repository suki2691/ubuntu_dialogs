2012-03-11T00:57:00.000Z	imrobert		hey, I ran out of room on my Ubuntu partition and gpart won't let me increase the size, I'm fairly new to Linux but I'm starting to consider reinstalling on the whole drive (replacing Win7) is this advisable?

2012-03-11T00:59:00.000Z	imrobert	vexati0n	well I only installed yesterday so it's not like I have much on there, also, I installed 32bit (cd I burned a while ago) but I'd like to install 64 this time
2012-03-11T01:00:00.000Z	vexati0n	imrobert	then i'd reinstall from scratch and kill off win7
