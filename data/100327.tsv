2008-10-30T22:11:00.000Z	jpt9		The nifty Flash animation on ubuntu.com mentions 8.10 being able to run off USB keys, but it doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere else on the site.
2008-10-30T22:12:00.000Z	jpt9		How do you do that?
2008-10-30T22:12:00.000Z	teamcobra	jpt9	install ubuntu, the tool is under administration
