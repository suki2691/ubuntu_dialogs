2010-06-11T06:24:00.000Z	mssever		I usually start gdm thus: sudo service gdm start
2010-06-11T06:24:00.000Z	jimisrvrox	mssever	do you think my wireless driver is borked? I dont see how it could be considering iwlist scan sees my network but yet I cant ping the damn router even with a static IP
2010-06-11T06:25:00.000Z	mssever	jimisrvrox	I don't know too much about wireless troubleshooting. Sorry.
