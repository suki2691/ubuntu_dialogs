2007-04-15T05:42:00.000Z	Adyeths		so... the other day my scanner suddenly stopped working in Ubuntu (edgy)... its detected by sane-find-scanner but not detected by scanimage -L now. anyone know why this might have happened and how to fix it?
2007-04-15T05:42:00.000Z	Owner	Adyeths	did you modify any settings on the scanner itself?
2007-04-15T05:44:00.000Z	Owner	Adyeths	did you change any system settings or installed new software?
2007-04-15T05:45:00.000Z	Owner	Adyeths	did you update before it stopped working?
