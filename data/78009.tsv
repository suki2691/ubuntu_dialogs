2008-10-04T14:38:00.000Z	alkaliv2		I updated my Bios and now bios will not boot.  Am I as bad off as I think I am?
2008-10-04T14:39:00.000Z	davidryder	alkaliv2	do you have a removable eprom on your mobo?
2008-10-04T14:39:00.000Z	alkaliv2	davidryder	I don't believe so
2008-10-04T14:40:00.000Z	davidryder	alkaliv2	i did the same thing and asus sent me a replacement eprom, it was just replacing a chip. if your bios chip is removeable you will have to get a new mobo
