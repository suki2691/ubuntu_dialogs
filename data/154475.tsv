2006-12-14T15:01:00.000Z	intrepidus		Quick question: how do I determine, if I don't remember, which drive grub is installed on? I know it's my primary drive...but I don't know what that is in grub-speak; hd(0,0), etc.?
2006-12-14T15:01:00.000Z	nothlit	intrepidus	grub just starts counting from 0
2006-12-14T15:03:00.000Z	intrepidus	nothlit	so my drive will be hd(0,0) if it's the primary sata master?
2006-12-14T15:03:00.000Z	nothlit	intrepidus	for first drive, first partition
