2008-04-14T02:09:00.000Z	lovehandles		Hello there, I've got a fresh Gutsy install here, and I've just added a second HD (/dev/hdb) to my system. I have partitioned and formatted it ext3 and i've added it to my fstab. When it's mounted it puts a "new volume" icon on the desktop. Is there a way to have it mounted and not showing on my desktop?
