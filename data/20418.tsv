2011-01-13T12:18:00.000Z	thiefy	sirscrubsalot	i would do 7 gigs for / and one gig for swap and the rest as your /home

2011-01-13T12:22:00.000Z	sirscrubsalot	thiefy	- yeah thanks for the input - i was reading though if you plan on using the laptop for hibernation, that swap needs to be doubled, then again - i've seen most suggestions from google search saying 1gb should be sufficient / mainly using this rig for firefox and openoffice and some vlc digital playback
