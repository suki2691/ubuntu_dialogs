2005-10-13T05:23:00.000Z	mwright1night		ok so it sounds like I can safely go RC1 and i'll have the release version by the time the apt repos gets updated for the release snapshot
2005-10-13T05:24:00.000Z	mwright1night		just by doing my normal updates
2005-10-13T05:24:00.000Z	Hobbsee	mwright1night	yes, that's right
