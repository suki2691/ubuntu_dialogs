2012-05-23T20:19:00.000Z	mkohler	huppensuhn	why would you want to do that? what is causing the shutdown?
2012-05-23T20:21:00.000Z	huppensuhn	mkohler	I'm causing the shutdown, when I'm not thinking of the backup still running
2012-05-23T20:22:00.000Z	mkohler	huppensuhn	I'm sure you could change the shutdown script and set a variable to indicate a backup is running.. but honestly I have no idea how :)
