2007-08-26T10:20:00.000Z	suupaabaka		What are some good organizer applications for Ubuntu that _aren't_ Evolution? I'm mainly looking for a calendar that would sit on my desktop, and allow me to highlight/make entries for individual days.
2007-08-26T05:44:00.000Z	suupaabaka		I'm looking for some advice: I just installed Ubuntu a couple of weeks ago, and I'm loving it. I now want to learn more about Linux, and I've also heard that other distributions allow one to tailor the OS to one's hardware. Being a Linux newbie, should I even bother with Gentoo?
2007-08-26T05:46:00.000Z	suupaabaka		I've heard Gentoo is quite difficult to get up and running, but I'd really like to have a distribution that I can tailor specifically to my system. Are there any other options that are more newbie friendly?
