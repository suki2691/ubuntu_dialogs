2009-01-09T05:18:00.000Z	sudobash		so i just did a apt-get upgrade and it set my resolution back down to 800x600... Why does this happen all the time?
2009-01-09T05:20:00.000Z	sudobash		i shouldnt have to backup before doing a sudo apt-get upgrade but I mean I understand backing it up if you are going to edit it in any way but apt should back it up automatically
2009-01-09T05:20:00.000Z	sudobash		this is obviously not from today...  xorg.conf.dist-upgrade-200811091020
2009-01-09T05:20:00.000Z	nsadmin	sudobash	you're right... whether you back up or not first is up to you
