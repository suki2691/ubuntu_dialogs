2009-01-02T01:57:00.000Z	anng		I'm looking for help getting the Broadcom wireless interface working on a used Dell Latitude D600 I bought from ebay.  I just installed ubuntu 8.10 on it last night.  There's no ethernet card, so we've got to get the wireless working.  It was running PCLinuxOS and the wireless connection did work under that.
