2011-08-30T06:08:00.000Z	blahblah		I recently bought a $250 Acer Aspire One laptop which came with Windows 7 Starter ALREADY installed on it.  I am trying to make a dual OS with Fedora and Windows.  This computer has no CD drive, so I had to make Fedora bootable from a USB flash drive.  The problem I have is that even after partitioning my hard drive with some software in Windows (resized the 250 GB HDD to 150 GB with the rest unallocated) I cannot install Fedora.
2011-08-30T06:09:00.000Z	blahblah		The Fedora graphical installer doesn't even list partitions, only the Hard drive and USB as hardware.  Keep in mind, I cannot just let it format the hard drive, because then I will lose the Windows which came with the laptop (no Windows install CD came with it because it has no CD drive).

2011-08-30T06:09:00.000Z	IdleOne	blahblah	that doesn't change the fact that fedora is not supported in here.
