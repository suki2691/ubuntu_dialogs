2008-04-23T06:48:00.000Z	GamingX		I was setting up LAMP server on Ubuntu Desktop and I got this message "apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName"
2008-04-23T06:49:00.000Z	Starnestommy	GamingX	add a ServerName directive to /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
2008-04-23T06:50:00.000Z	GamingX	Starnestommy	But I don't have a server.
2008-04-23T06:51:00.000Z	Starnestommy	GamingX	just put somehitng in like ServerName localhost
