2005-10-08T13:03:00.000Z	GDorn		I'm a little vague on windowmanagers...  if I switch to a different one, say, fluxbox, does it mean I'm going to have to manually build menus again?
2005-10-08T13:05:00.000Z	GDorn		I tend to use apt-get for packages I know the names of, and synapse only when I need to search for something that I can't recall
2005-10-08T13:06:00.000Z	shedi	GDorn	you can use apt-cache search package
