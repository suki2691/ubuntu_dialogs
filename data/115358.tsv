2008-02-02T23:29:00.000Z	sidelil		excuse me, due to a problem I have with skype, my webcam should be on /dev/video1 instead of /dev/video0. Because every time I reboot it comes back on /dev/video0, is there a way to forse it to stay on /dev/video1? Thanks a lot.

2008-02-02T23:31:00.000Z	sidelil	Pelo	it's not a problem with skype any more, I fixed my problem with skype. The only thing I need now is forcing the webcam to be on /dev/video1 instead of /dev/video0 when I boot the computer. Is there a way to do it?
2008-02-02T23:32:00.000Z	Pelo	sidelil	my point was that other skype user might have encounterd this problem and know how to solve it
