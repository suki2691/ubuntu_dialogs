2004-10-16T13:08:00.000Z	AfC		Is http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/warty/preview/live-i386.iso the LiveCD? If so, is that the one to download, or is there a newer one, etc? Sorry if it's FAQ, but the FAQ doesn't link to a download...
2004-10-16T13:08:00.000Z	|trey|	AfC	I would guess so...
2004-10-16T13:09:00.000Z	|trey|	AfC	I would ask mdz if I was you, he is working on it... he said there was a new one going out today I think... not sure if thats it...
2004-10-16T13:18:00.000Z	AfC	|trey|	any idea where/when I might find mdz?
