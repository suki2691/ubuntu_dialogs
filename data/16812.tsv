2011-04-13T11:13:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lasha	do they give you an option to print?
2011-04-13T11:14:00.000Z	lasha	Seven_Six_Two	yes but you need to do the same procedure, you need subscription to print
2011-04-13T11:15:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lasha	sorry, can't help then. I've had access where i could print but not download (flashpaper) and I used cups-pdf
