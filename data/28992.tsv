2010-08-04T04:11:00.000Z	r15		hi, on a ubuntu server SWAP=2xPhysical RAM, is it correct?
2010-08-04T04:12:00.000Z	masen	r15	that's generally the rule
2010-08-04T04:12:00.000Z	masen	r15	what are you serving/how much physical ram is going to be in it
2010-08-04T04:12:00.000Z	r15	masen	actually one server is going on high load, and i checked, physical ram is 2gb and allocated swap is around 500mb
