I have bought a usb pc link cable for my mobile phone (samsung e700 or e710) and i need to get my photos out of the phone. When i connect i get a message in dmesg that PL-2303 converter is loaded and now attached to ttyUSB0. I dont know what to do now, i have seen some instructions that is to link ttyUSB0 to /dev/modem and then use a PPP software to connect but i have tried and failed, ca
