2011-02-09T14:06:00.000Z	species|work	JenniferB2	you dont use su with sudo, they are different
2011-02-09T14:06:00.000Z	species|work	JenniferB2	to permanantly auth, use "sudo -s" or do to it temporarily, "sudo <original commands> <original params>"
2011-02-09T14:08:00.000Z	JenniferB2	species|work	what do I do then ?
