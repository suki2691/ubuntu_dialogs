2011-07-13T11:21:00.000Z	Trasp		hm... how do I tell xterm (or some other terminal under x) to start and run a specific command? (I want to run a program on boot, and still be able to see it's output) I do NOT want to use "screen"
2011-07-13T11:22:00.000Z	dc5ala	Trasp	redirect the commands output to a file?
2011-07-13T11:24:00.000Z	Trasp	dc5ala	well... that's not an option
2011-07-13T11:26:00.000Z	dc5ala	Trasp	ah okay, i misunderstood, with "boot" i have something else in mind ;)
