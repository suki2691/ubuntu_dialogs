2011-10-17T23:48:00.000Z	newjoe		I installed gnome-shell from the app store, and restarted selecting gnome from the gear menu. Gnome 3.2 does not appear to be properly installed. How do I fix it?

2011-10-17T23:50:00.000Z	h00k	newjoe	What do you mean, Gnome3.2 doesn't appear to be installed? Are you seeing breakage somehow?
2011-10-17T23:50:00.000Z	h00k	newjoe	okay...like what?
