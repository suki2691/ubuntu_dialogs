2007-12-11T03:45:00.000Z	RazzoRz		I am looking for a Good Dj Mixing program,.. can anyone give me some ideas?
2007-12-11T03:46:00.000Z	LjL	RazzoRz	"apt-cache search dj mix" shows a few.
2007-12-11T03:48:00.000Z	LjL	RazzoRz	"apt-cache search" really helps, and so does Synaptic if you prefer a graphical interface. but there is http://packages.ubuntu.com as well.
