2006-05-10T12:21:00.000Z	Maniqui		a newbie question: when I use a command like "gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst_backup", the terminal keeps "locked" and I cant execute any other command until I close  (or ctrl + c) the actual gedit process
2006-05-10T12:22:00.000Z	Maniqui		is that ok? do i need to open another terminal to execute other commands?
2006-05-10T12:22:00.000Z	mustard5	Maniqui	yes
2006-05-10T12:22:00.000Z	mustard5	Maniqui	that first terminal is running the gedit application, so it will be tied up
