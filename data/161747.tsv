2006-10-31T08:57:00.000Z	vbgunz		how do I trouble shoot a process or service that always has the zombie status?
2006-10-31T08:57:00.000Z	Uberriffi1	vbgunz	 is it vmare?
2006-10-31T08:58:00.000Z	vbgunz	Uberriffi1	maybe vmware is causing it?
2006-10-31T08:59:00.000Z	Uberriffi1	vbgunz	probably not, usually vmware just defuncts itself
