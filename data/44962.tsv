2011-02-10T02:44:00.000Z	almoxarife	markskilbeck	not if you use 'wubi' install
2011-02-13T11:21:00.000Z	almoxarife	markskilbeck	I just opened about:blank in chromium, I will assume if that was my home page I would have one big blank
2011-02-13T11:27:00.000Z	markskilbeck	almoxarife	tell me about it.
