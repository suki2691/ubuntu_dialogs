2009-01-23T20:11:00.000Z	Greyhound-		would hardy or intrepid 64 be better suited for a core i7 system with a nvidia gtx 260 gfx card and 6GB ddr3?
2009-01-23T20:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	Greyhound-	you need 64 bits to access all the memory
2009-01-23T20:15:00.000Z	Greyhound-	erUSUL	I'm aware of that :P maybe I didn't make myself clear.. the decission was between hardy and intrepid, both 64 bit
2009-01-23T20:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	Greyhound-	as onetinsoldier said it is pretty new hardware so intrepid may be a better fit
