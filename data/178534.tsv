2011-03-23T18:47:00.000Z	trelayne		Hey all, let's say that I  want to install a PPA version of something to get security patches as they come out but that I want to revert to the non PPA version, is there a site that would explain how I can do that?
2011-03-23T18:48:00.000Z	trelayne		I mean I want to revert when the non-PPA is patched..
2011-03-23T18:49:00.000Z	trelayne		dagni,  s3r3n1t7  thanks.. but how do I know when a security patch for the non-PPA is out if I am using the PPA version ? Won't I only get notices for the PPA version?
