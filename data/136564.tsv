2008-01-07T22:44:00.000Z	dravine		so, to restate the problem I am having: Gutsy Gibbon, usb devices auto mount, but only root has permissions to access them, chmod / chown do not have any effect, nor does the use of them result in any errors
2008-01-07T22:45:00.000Z	neverblue	dravine	maybe post your fstab on pastebin ?
2008-01-07T22:45:00.000Z	dravine	neverblue	it's not a problem with the fstab, I don't want an entry for every USB device I might use
