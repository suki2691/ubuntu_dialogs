2007-02-10T07:38:00.000Z	Erb		Is is possible to set an application to always "On Top" by default? Is this an X setting?
2007-02-10T07:39:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Erb	you can set it "on top" just not sure if by default
2007-02-10T07:39:00.000Z	Erb	SurfnKid	I am aware of "On Top" but I need it to be enabled when certain applications are launched.
2007-02-10T07:40:00.000Z	SurfnKid	Erb	hmm that would be nice actually to find out
