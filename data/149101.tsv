2009-08-27T19:14:00.000Z	Snake23		is there a difference between "sudo su" and "sudo -i"
2009-08-27T19:15:00.000Z	unop	Snake23	sudo su -- makes su redundant as sudo already elevates you to the superuser, it makes it read as make me superuser to make me superuser again.
2009-08-27T19:15:00.000Z	Snake23	sipior	and unop :  ok thanks ;)
2009-08-27T19:16:00.000Z	unop	Snake23	 and plus, sudo -i   does the job of  su ...
