2009-05-08T07:07:00.000Z	Luria	Jack_Sparrow	- from before: ok, so im trying to install windows on a machine. it repeatedly crashes on install. I suspect a sata controller driver issue. I have 9.04 already installed. lspci tells me that i have an nvidia "mcp55" controller, which, afiak is just a southbridge chipset. can i get more detailed info anywhere in a vanilla install or with a package from the repos?
