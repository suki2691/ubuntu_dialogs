2010-02-07T01:35:00.000Z	ivansmo		please help, I want to setup my xubuntu 8.04 with windows shared folders. I google some and I see that I need start samba service. How to start that service?
2010-02-07T01:36:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ivansmo	sudo apt-get install samba
2010-02-07T01:36:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ivansmo	it will start the service and also will start onboot too
2010-02-07T01:38:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ivansmo	install samba, you can then use nautilus to share folders
