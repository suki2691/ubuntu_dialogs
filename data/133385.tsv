2008-03-28T00:46:00.000Z	homerj		I have a Logitech MOMO Racing wheel. It's detected fine, but I don't have any FF in games, and pedals are detected as a combined axis. Is there any special setup I have to do? Maybe muck around with X's joystick module?

2008-03-28T00:49:00.000Z	saschahl	homerj	what would you like to do with the pedal-axes? you could map it to buttons with X's joystick driver, if that helps
