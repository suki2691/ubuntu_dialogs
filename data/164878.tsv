2007-04-17T07:30:00.000Z	Visti		Well, I figured that Gnomebaker wasn't gonna cut it with menus or .srts, unless I make it in another program first or something - I'll try k3b, though
2007-04-17T07:32:00.000Z	Visti		Well, I'm gonna shop around a bit, I just thought some recommendations would be good to start off.
