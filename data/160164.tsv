2007-09-24T05:35:00.000Z	aleka		I installed Awn per instruction on (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=385981) and nothing happens when I try to launch it from System>Preferences>Awn.. I don't know what the binary is so I can't try to start it from terminal to figure out what is going on.. ideas?
