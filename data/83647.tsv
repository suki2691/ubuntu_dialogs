2008-08-17T05:17:00.000Z	nosmelc		I was able to access the share on my Windows machine, but I couldn't use the computer name.  I had to use the IP address.  Why is that?
2008-08-17T05:18:00.000Z	linxeh	nosmelc	some WINS issue maybe ?
2008-08-17T05:19:00.000Z	nosmelc	linxeh	don't know.  I thought name resolution was done by broadcasts when both machines are on the same subnet
