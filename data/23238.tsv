2010-11-08T10:42:00.000Z	Sabri		Can I create a custom LiveDVD of Ubuntu 10.10 that maps /home to a CF installed on my IDE channel?
2010-11-08T10:43:00.000Z	Sabri		I don't want to install it.  I want to boot from the LiveDVD without installing, and make it customized with the packages I want.

2010-11-08T10:46:00.000Z	Sabri	Jordan_U	the CF isn't large enough for my install.  That's why I want to create a custom LiveDVD.  I just want /home mapped to the CF.
