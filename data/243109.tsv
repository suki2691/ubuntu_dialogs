2005-12-05T06:15:00.000Z	LinuxN00bie		ok while waiting for the installation to go on, i hv a question, i used windows 98SE, and everytime i didn't shutdown properly, then the "bluescreen" scandisk appeared, I skipped it, and if i always do this to my windows 98SE, now I want to install ubuntu hoary on that same comp, get rid of windows, is it related to the problem i mentioned just now, fail to partition my hard disk?
