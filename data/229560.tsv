2006-03-29T07:45:00.000Z	elg		installing breezy right now and it occurs to me what I really want on this box is edubuntu. can I migrate after the install with an apt command?
2006-03-29T07:45:00.000Z	elg		do I need to add a source, or just find a package?
2006-03-29T07:46:00.000Z	elg		cool. thanks
2006-03-29T07:48:00.000Z	bimberi	elg	install the edubuntu-desktop metapackage (same sources)
