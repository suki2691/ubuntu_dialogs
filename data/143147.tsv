2007-04-24T14:36:00.000Z	topgun553		Hey can someone help me!!!! : I have a presentation to give and I want to use the open office version of powerpoint (since I only run linux on my computer) and I was wondering what I am going to need to do to have it be able to be on the projection screen... This is for my TechComm class of U of M
