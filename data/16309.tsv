2011-04-01T10:59:00.000Z	ashray		I have ubuntu 11.04 . whenever I try installing some packages using, "sudo apt-get install" I am getting the error "Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?" . How can this issue be solved?
2011-04-01T11:00:00.000Z	DaPenguin	ashray	i'm assuming you've tried the suggested fixes in that msg, correct?
2011-04-01T11:03:00.000Z	ashray	DaPenguin	ya i tried running apt-get update which was given in that message. Still it is not working.
2011-04-01T11:03:00.000Z	DaPenguin	ashray	so it's an issue with broken repos.
