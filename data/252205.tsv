2005-10-11T14:24:00.000Z	LokeDK		I've just upgraded to breezy, but I can't compile the nvidia driver.. first of all it complains about that I have a different gcc version than the one the kernel was compiled with - 2nd, if i ignore that, it builds and after that it complains about something with wrong kernel-headers.. and nvidia.ko
2005-10-11T14:25:00.000Z	linuxboy	LokeDK	you installed the nvidia package?
2005-10-11T14:25:00.000Z	linuxboy	LokeDK	there is an ubuntu package for the drivers
2005-10-11T14:26:00.000Z	linuxboy	LokeDK	search the forums
