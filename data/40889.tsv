2010-07-17T21:46:00.000Z	stanley_robertso	oCean_	cool.. which flavour you used ? i tried with Oracle Enterprise lInux 5... but failed.. since i tried with laptop having only 4 GB RAM
2010-07-17T21:47:00.000Z	oCean_	stanley_robertso	centos would be good choice. Also RAC/centos tutorials available @oracle. Also visit #oracle channel for more help, since this is really offtopic for this channel
2010-07-17T21:48:00.000Z	stanley_robertso	oCean_	cool.. i will try that.. but will 4GB ram is sufficient .. any idea.. i mean.. how much RAM.. you tried ?:
