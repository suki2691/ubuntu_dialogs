2008-06-10T05:11:00.000Z	battleroyale		I have a macbook and I'm using this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBook, but it says "Note that Boot Camp will cause problems if you make more than two partitions in total.". Do I not need to create a swap partition then?

2008-06-10T05:12:00.000Z	battleroyale	BCM43	I don't have to create one, it's included?
2008-06-10T05:12:00.000Z	BCM43	battleroyale	yes
