2004-12-13T10:32:00.000Z	zekktheon		i have the old, warty ubuntu disc, from your first release, it was beta at the time. i am running it on one of my servers (know you shouldnt do that with beta, but i loved it) i was wondering wether or not i should get the new one and reload it or do the updates take care of the new kernel and everything?

2004-12-13T10:35:00.000Z	deFrysk	zekktheon	mind the 'afaIk'
2004-12-13T10:38:00.000Z	deFrysk	zekktheon	even updating to hoary is seemless
