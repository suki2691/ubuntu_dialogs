2009-10-28T07:45:00.000Z	AntiStrange		can someone help me with how I would dual boot ubuntu with windows 7? I already have windows 7 (only) installed on this box. Link?

2009-10-28T07:47:00.000Z	AntiStrange	Scunizi	so there won't be any problems? I've heard that sometimes windows won't recognize the new install and will just go straight to windows.
2009-10-28T07:48:00.000Z	Scunizi	AntiStrange	not typically. I've never had an issue in the last 4 years.
