2008-11-21T01:52:00.000Z	thebaggage	magnetron	Cheers for the idea. I assume the APN is the "telstra.internet" part(?) It's what I currently have entered, and it works fine through XP. Is it possible a locked modem could interfere with APN?
2008-11-21T01:59:00.000Z	thebaggage	magnetron	Cheers. Sadly, apn is correct (telstra.internet works fine in XP). Card (might be) locked, but to the network I'm connecting to to. Thanks for trying anyhow. :-)
2008-11-21T02:02:00.000Z	thebaggage	magnetron	Ahh - interesting. The Intrepid Mobile Connection installer suggests telstra.datapack, which works in neither XP nor Linux...I'll keep digging. Cheers.
