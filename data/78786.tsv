2008-09-28T04:05:00.000Z	John_Valdez	matreya6	i am really new about this linux deal how would i go about getting them to work... i have tried google and i am just way more confused.... between moding the kernel or something to that pont, for the marvell. The huge problem is that i have no internet connection on that laptop at all...
