2008-04-20T19:47:00.000Z	sdakak		 Installation is not a problem. I have got all three installed correctly. So one uses a db and others not is not in question. My wiki is going to gather articles for a newsletter. peer-editing is not a very great requirement. But admins being informed when there is a new submission is. The wiki needs to be organized well, so that it is easy to categorize the articles. I should also able to tag them - to make search easier. What say?
