2004-12-30T09:08:00.000Z	viktor_	daniels	is X supposed to work now? cause I just ran update and dist-upgrade and still got the bitmap and pcidata errors...
2004-12-30T09:11:00.000Z	daniels	viktor_	only when you get 6.8.1-1ubuntu8 in a dist-upgrade
2004-12-30T09:12:00.000Z	viktor_	daniels	ok. thanks. I guess I can revert to xfree or a cached version of xorg right?
2004-12-30T09:24:00.000Z	daniels	viktor_	yeah, xorg 6.8.1-1ubuntu6 is fine
