2008-06-30T16:57:00.000Z	jeriath		anyone know if there are any generic pci to ide drivers for ubuntu....ive been looking for a while now and cant find any
2008-06-30T16:57:00.000Z	jeriath		there are no specific ones for my adapter either
2008-06-30T16:57:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jeriath	 you are refering to a pci, ide controller card?
2008-06-30T16:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jeriath	 the 3 i have tried in the past have always had the drivers allready in the kernel.
