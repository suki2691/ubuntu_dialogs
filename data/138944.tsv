2007-09-05T14:28:00.000Z	Xyhthyx	arch_	you can just drag them from the places menu to your desktop
2007-09-05T14:29:00.000Z	Xyhthyx	arch_	delete them as you would any other file
2007-09-05T14:30:00.000Z	Xyhthyx	arch_	If you added them from gconf, load up gconf "gconf-editor" in terminal, and travel to app->nautilus->desktop and turn each on/off
