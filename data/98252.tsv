2008-07-10T03:08:00.000Z	VelcroMan		Can i "fake" a floppy/cd drive somehow? I'm deving a simple OS and i want to use a virtual floppy or cd instead of a real if its possible
2008-07-10T03:08:00.000Z	Slart	VelcroMan	I don't think there is any difference between a folder, cd, floppy in linux.. I could be wrong though
2008-07-10T03:09:00.000Z	VelcroMan	Slart	I need to be able to boot it in Bochs :P
2008-07-10T03:09:00.000Z	Slart	VelcroMan	ah.. can't bochs boot from an iso or something?
