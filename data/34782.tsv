2010-04-02T00:10:00.000Z	Berzerker		I like workspaces, but is there a way to stick an application to a certain workspace? or if there are any other equivalents for it?
2010-04-02T00:11:00.000Z	AJW256	Berzerker	try right clicking a window, I think it's in the dropdown menu somewhere
2010-04-02T00:11:00.000Z	Berzerker	AJW256	it doesn't work correctly, if I alt+tab to it, it moves it to my current space
2010-04-02T00:12:00.000Z	AJW256	Berzerker	ahh, sorry can't help more than that
