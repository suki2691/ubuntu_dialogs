2008-08-11T05:37:00.000Z	Reformer81	frances	What do you mean by window shading?
2008-08-11T05:38:00.000Z	Reformer81	frances	Oh... shading.  That isn't a Compiz option (unfortunately).  It's a feature of the Emerald Theme system.
2008-08-11T05:40:00.000Z	Reformer81	frances	Nope.  I've been waiting as well.
