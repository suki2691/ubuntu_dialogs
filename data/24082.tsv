2010-10-14T21:35:00.000Z	ThomasBerends2		Hi, anybody here with experience with Wubi ?
2010-10-14T21:36:00.000Z	ThomasBerends2		I installed Ubuntu using the Wubi installer, but when I boot Ubuntu, I get a session like the live-cd, I even have an install button :S (I don't have the CD in my pc, so that isn't the problem)
