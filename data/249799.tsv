2007-03-14T09:02:00.000Z	Shane-S		I need help I have  celron 400 w/64MB ram, and I downloaded xbuntu because of its low specs, it starts to load with the bouncing bar and logo, then goes to a black screen with a blinking "_" in the top left and sits there, doing nothing
2007-03-14T09:03:00.000Z	Shane-S		I also tried graphics safe mode, same sympton
2007-03-14T09:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Shane-S	 thats a VERY low memory system.. You may want to try out some of the very minimal linux disrtos like "DSL" or "PuppyLinux"
2007-03-14T09:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Shane-S	 but your poblem, sounds more like the systems not reading the cd right, or badly burnt cd
