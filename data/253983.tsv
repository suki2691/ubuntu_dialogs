2009-11-06T08:11:00.000Z	NoMS_		I recently updated from jaunty to karmic.  Now my computer is displaying a floppy drive.  I don't have one installed.  Is there a way to get rid of this?

2009-11-06T08:12:00.000Z	aperson	NoMS_	there was something about the cdrom being listed, grr, I know I had to fix that once
2009-11-06T08:13:00.000Z	aperson	NoMS_	let me know if you get it, I'm curious now too :)
