2008-12-23T08:06:00.000Z	ryoung786		Hi all, I have a pretty generic question: where should I put apps I've compiled from source?
2008-12-23T08:06:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ryoung786	as in where should you unpack them? or...?
2008-12-23T08:07:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ryoung786	yeah, what they all said... /usr/local area
2008-12-23T08:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	ryoung786	/usr/local/bin is in what's call your PATH   echo "$PATH"
