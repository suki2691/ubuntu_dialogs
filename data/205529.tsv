2006-01-28T12:27:00.000Z	mitrovarr	whyameye	 I don't think so, AMDs 64 bit processors were designed to run 32 bit emulation very well
2006-01-28T12:29:00.000Z	mitrovarr	whyameye	 It should be fine.  Are you sure it's a 64 bit athlon, to begin with?  Not all are.
2006-01-28T12:29:00.000Z	whyameye	mitrovarr	yep.
