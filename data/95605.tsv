2010-10-04T18:44:00.000Z	odb|fidel	jazzfish	the system administration menu is not always showing all points
2010-10-04T18:45:00.000Z	odb|fidel	jazzfish	there is a special app to edit the menu - there again you can enable if all categories should displayed in the administration menu
2010-10-04T18:46:00.000Z	odb|fidel	jazzfish	so run 'Main Menu' and see if that answers that question
