2010-02-15T17:07:00.000Z	vinik		I've just installed Ubuntu 9.10, and in the Ubuntu Software Center I'm unable to find Java JDK, just the JRE. Why is that?
2010-02-15T17:08:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vinik	the Software Center doesn't always list everything  - you might want to try "apt-cache search sun-java" and see what it spits out
2010-02-15T17:09:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vinik	in that case open Synaptic instead
2010-02-15T17:10:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vinik	it's not an "issue" it's a feature
