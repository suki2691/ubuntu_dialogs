2007-07-19T09:56:00.000Z	GamingX2005		I have a Nvidia Geforce FX 5200, what are the best drivers, I used the nvidia-glx drivers and was not able to startup, and now I rolled back the changes, so what are the best drivers for it?
2007-07-19T09:57:00.000Z	ptn107	GamingX2005	try the     nvidia-glx-new   package
2007-07-19T09:58:00.000Z	ptn107	GamingX2005	just dont forget to run a    sudo nvidia-glx-config enable      afterwards
