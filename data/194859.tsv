2006-03-29T07:18:00.000Z	raindog		I'm trying to edit a file and Ubuntu won't let me.  How can I make the edit?

2006-03-29T07:18:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick		or rather raindog  as root/with sudo
2006-03-29T07:19:00.000Z	raindog	FliesLikeABrick	 I have tried sudo gedit to open the file.  I'll try again.
