2009-02-27T02:02:00.000Z	hanasaki		my CPU runs at 2.5Ghz   I overclocked it in bios to faster however the gnome cpu applet never shows over 2.5 even under load.   at boot dmesg does show the faster clock speed.   whats going on?  why doesnt it go ver 2.5 in gnome?
2009-02-27T02:04:00.000Z	hanasaki		what is a good tool to tell what the cpu is running at?
