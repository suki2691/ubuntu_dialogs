2008-10-13T20:34:00.000Z	dtech		I need help with 'rescue mode' ... it's asking me to 'execute a shell' in ...  (this is beyond me)
2008-10-13T20:34:00.000Z	kitche	dtech	type /bin/bash there and it will load bash correctly
2008-10-13T20:41:00.000Z	kitche	dtech	it's up to you to select what shell you want to use either use the one on your hard drive or the one from the install environment
2008-10-13T20:44:00.000Z	kitche	dtech	well then you shouldn't be using the rescue mode then but just pick one and it will load the shell so you can get into rescue mode(myself I'd rather use a livecd instead of the built in rescue mode)
