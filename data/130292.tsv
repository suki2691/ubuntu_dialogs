2007-06-19T13:10:00.000Z	wols	logan-koester	that is impossible. 10000 packages all with new versions. can you imagine what kind of changelog that is?
2007-06-19T13:12:00.000Z	logan-koester	wols	true. What are the odds of upgrading via apt going smoothly on a headless server?
2007-06-19T13:12:00.000Z	wols	logan-koester	fairly good
