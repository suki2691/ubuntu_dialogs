2008-12-19T07:39:00.000Z	bshak1		I need help port forwarding with Apache on Ubuntu.  Right now, when I enter my domain name, it takes me to the router page.  I can enter the computer's IP Address and it will show me the website.  I know I need to forward the ports.  How do I do that?

2008-12-19T07:40:00.000Z	bshak1		ok... but what do i do on the admin page?
