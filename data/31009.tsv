2010-06-22T08:57:00.000Z	somethinginteres	codebrainz	Yes, thanks I am reading that faac support was taken out of Lucid due to GPL conflicts FAAD seems to be a different kettle of fish that doesn't violate GPL but my problem is how do I go about adding the ability to encode using FAAD2 into mencoder?
2010-06-22T08:59:00.000Z	somethinginteres	codebrainz	ah, I think FAAD2 is only a decoder I'll just have to use faac but I am not sure how to get mplayer or mencoder to regonise it. Would I need to uninstall mplayer etc and re-install from source or can I add it in without a re-install?
