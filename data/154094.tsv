2008-08-21T04:59:00.000Z	kkerwin		Hi. I have a Windows partition at /dev/hda1, a swap partition at /dev/hda2, and my root partition at /dev/hda3. I want to reformat my root partition and split it into a root and /home partition, which would be located at /dev/hda4. The data on /dev/hda3 will of course be destroyed, but can I edit the partition table without destroying the data on /dev/hda1, even though I don't touch that physical section of the disk?
