2008-04-02T03:09:00.000Z	billy		im having issues with my display, its' really hard to explain, but like the text is repeating above itself..
2008-04-02T03:10:00.000Z	billy		i can barely see what everyone is writing, it looks like a really dirty inkjet printer, can anyone help?
2008-04-02T03:11:00.000Z	Jowi	billy	does a reboot solve it?
2008-04-02T03:12:00.000Z	Jowi	billy	sounds like the video ram is wacky. shutting the PC off *totally* and then start it up again. if that does not help.. umm..
