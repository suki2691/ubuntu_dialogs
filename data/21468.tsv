2011-01-07T11:08:00.000Z	Arachon		I've got a quick question before heading off to work, I'm using the 10.4 Ubuntu Netbook Remix (or more specifically, EasyPeasy), and the Ubuntu Software Center does not seem to be the same version as found in 10.10, is there a way to update it?
2011-01-07T11:10:00.000Z	Arachon		Anyone?
2011-01-07T11:10:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Arachon	EasyPeasy isn't supported here.  But I don't know of a way to update it no.
2011-01-07T11:11:00.000Z	Arachon	ZykoticK9	Ok, I thought since EasyPeasy is essentially just a remix of 10.4 UNR, this place would be just as good as any to ask, but I'll look around a bit more then
