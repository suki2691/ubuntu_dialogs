I have the livecd here, and I can boot up with that. I'm wondering if there would be a way to restore the kernel from the livecd boot, I don't want to lose everything with a reformat :(

2006-06-10T12:16:00.000Z	andymac	Sivik	: I don't think so, it worked fine for awhile, then one time I rebooted and it hasen't worked since. I only have 1 partition, using all the hdd space.
