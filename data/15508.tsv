2011-09-25T06:30:00.000Z	alazyworkaholic		Has anyone tried running LGP's game Cold War on ubuntu recently? I can't get sound. I got a message that suggests /dev/sound/dsp doesn't exist & it should.
2011-09-25T06:32:00.000Z	alazyworkaholic		If a program is looking for /dev/dsp & can't find it because sound systems have evolved, is there a way to reroute the program?

2011-09-25T06:33:00.000Z	alazyworkaholic	escott	I suspected as much, but the message is this: /usr/lib32/libtdb.so.1.2.9open /dev/[sound/]dsp: No such file or directory
