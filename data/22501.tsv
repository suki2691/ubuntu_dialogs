2011-01-18T23:17:00.000Z	robbit10	bencahill	About !patience: When you have asked a question and about 10 minutes have passed, is it okay to ask again?
2011-01-18T23:18:00.000Z	bencahill	robbit10	not an op, but I would say if it's been 10 minutes, rephrase your question and you can ask again. don't ask more than two or three times in an hour, come back at a later time, or figure it out yourself. again, just my opinion though, don't know what the ops think :)
