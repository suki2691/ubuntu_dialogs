2009-07-29T01:56:00.000Z	BigMao		Hi, I'm a longtime Ubuntu user.  My workstation has 4 monitors (2 graphics cards), and when one of them blew out, I upgraded to dual NVidia 9550GT (I had dual NVidia 7300 before).  Now I can't use anything but the VESA driver - hrelp?
2009-07-29T01:58:00.000Z	BigMao		I've already tried installing the restricted drivers, and using Envy, and building kernel modules with the newest NVidia driver.  I tried both the latest Ubuntu driver (180) and the legacy (173).  Nothing works
2009-07-29T01:58:00.000Z	pepperjack	BigMao	anything similar showing up in the forums?
2009-07-29T01:59:00.000Z	BigMao	pepperjack	the solutions I've found in the forums all point to "Envy", I've tried it and it doesn't seem to help.
