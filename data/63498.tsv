2011-01-13T05:10:00.000Z	m1ke		i'm trying to figure out why the NTFS hard drive (label = New Volume) isn't showing up on df -h .. http://dpaste.com/311297/  .. i see it when i do sudo blkid -g && sudo blkid
2011-01-13T05:11:00.000Z	acicula	m1ke	is it mounted?
2011-01-13T05:11:00.000Z	acicula	m1ke	indeed its not mounted, so df does not report it
2011-01-13T05:12:00.000Z	acicula	m1ke	if you read the man page it says that without arguments given it will show mounted disks only
