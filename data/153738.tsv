2007-05-21T05:28:00.000Z	bimberi	vox754	i've used it successfully with binary files
2007-05-21T05:30:00.000Z	bimberi	vox754	_very_ useful when you have a file that's just a bit big for a floppy disk
2007-05-21T05:31:00.000Z	vox754	bimberi	and I assume such utility has been around since the 70's... and now I finally know.
