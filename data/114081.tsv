2007-11-17T03:58:00.000Z	sutabi		Anyone know of any graphics cards that just work well on ubuntu? Right now I have a radeon 9600 but there is no 3d acceleration, plus its getting outdated so I want to buy a new one anyways

2007-11-17T03:59:00.000Z	friedrich	sutabi	even Radeon 9600 with propietary drivers will be excelent card
2007-11-17T04:01:00.000Z	sutabi	friedrich	I am running ati's propietary driver the most recent and right now it just throws me to the config to detect my card and display
