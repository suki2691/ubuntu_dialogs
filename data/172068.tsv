2006-08-25T12:15:00.000Z	prower		Hello everybody :> Just a quick question...if I were installing Ubuntu on a system with an Intel Core 2 Duo processor (the ones with EM64T), would it be better to use the 32-bit x86 install or the AMD64 one?

2006-08-25T12:16:00.000Z	prower	Rookie-	I don't now, though I was planning on upgrading...as long as both the cores are supported I'd be happy with 32 bit
2006-08-25T12:16:00.000Z	Rookie-	prower	- well, if you dont have atleast 4 GB of RAM - keep/stay at 32
