2006-06-01T12:56:00.000Z	eugman	T-CAN	I think the update manager. It should give you the option to upgrade some time today. It's simple, easy to follow and gui based.
2006-06-01T13:31:00.000Z	eugman	T-CAN	At some point a button should appear today on the manager offering to upgrade to 6.06
2006-06-01T13:32:00.000Z	eugman	T-CAN	You can do it early by typing sudo update-manager -d into the terminal.
