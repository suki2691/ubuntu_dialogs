2009-08-27T16:06:00.000Z	zebuduflea		i just installed ubuntu on vmware, i have fedora already and i was wondering if unbuntu has the equivalent of "yum" in fedora ?
2009-08-27T16:06:00.000Z	onexused	zebuduflea	apt-get
2009-08-27T16:16:00.000Z	onexused	zebuduflea	Does vmware have a "shared clipboard" or similar option?  I'm not familiar with it.
