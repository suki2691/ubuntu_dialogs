2011-05-29T04:53:00.000Z	mrpatg		I have a question about the tray/system notifications in ubuntu 11 (gnome desktop)
2011-05-29T04:54:00.000Z	mrpatg		Whenever i mouseover them, they disappear and reappear when i move my mouse away. Is that supposed to happen, or am i supposed to be able to click and make them disappear?
2011-05-29T04:54:00.000Z	mrpatg		everything else works fine. Is there any way to manage how the notifications behave, or some other kind of notification manager?
