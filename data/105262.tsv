2009-02-09T04:04:00.000Z	balor		Why does libglib2.0-0 link against libpcre?  Other distros like Debian and Fedora don't link against it.
2009-02-09T04:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	balor	debian and fedora are different distros so will act differently
2009-02-09T04:06:00.000Z	balor	ActionParsnip	I'm wondering, though, what the specific Ubuntu reason is for linking against it.  As I think it's causing an issue on my system.
