2005-07-18T16:54:00.000Z	ex-parrot		seeing as gnomedesktop is down, does anyone have the latest starterbar version (0.31.3 or higher) handy?
2005-07-18T16:55:00.000Z	ex-parrot		the currently available release doesn't run due to python-xdg incompatability
2005-07-18T16:56:00.000Z	ex-parrot		I'm talking about gdesklets here
2005-07-18T16:56:00.000Z	Nermal	ex-parrot	tried #gdesklets on irc.gnome.org ? :)
