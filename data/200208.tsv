2006-07-02T05:36:00.000Z	Jessehk		I am going to be using the instructions here: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/separatehome.html to make a /home partition. How much space should I leave for / ?
2006-07-02T05:37:00.000Z	Amaranth	Jessehk	i usually do 10GB
2006-07-02T05:37:00.000Z	Amaranth	Jessehk	that's probably way too much but better safe than sorry
2006-07-02T05:37:00.000Z	Jessehk	Amaranth	Thanks. I have plenty of space :)
