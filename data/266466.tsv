2010-02-23T19:21:00.000Z	adifire		I want to set a PC as a server. on the PC running Ubuntu 9.10 and samba. I want to set up samba, that smb.conf file so that if I have 2 Windows users accessing the data to be stored on this server one of them to have access both to his files and on the other, and the other only his own, without access to files belonging to the first. I want to make data access only with password. What should contain smb.c
