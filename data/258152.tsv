2007-01-30T06:05:00.000Z	drx		i issued a copy command on a large file (3GB) and now GNOME has locked up, I'm afraid to stop it because the file I'm moving is important & took hours to make.
2007-01-30T06:07:00.000Z	Xenguy	drx	maybe run 'top' to see whether the 'cp' is still in process  ?
2007-01-30T06:12:00.000Z	Xenguy	drx	how's it look?
