2006-09-08T08:45:00.000Z	A-L-P-H-A		Is there a way to upgrade firefox to 1.5.0.6?  I found where it is /usb/lib/firefox... but there's symbolic links, which I don't how or if I should maintain them.

2006-09-08T08:48:00.000Z	A-L-P-H-A	knox_	I've downloaded it... I have it extracted, but I just wanted to replace my old one.  I guess I could just wait till ubuntu's repositories get updated.
2006-09-08T08:51:00.000Z	knox_	A-L-P-H-A	ok. Sorry I dont know how, but search the forum, maybe theres a guide there?
