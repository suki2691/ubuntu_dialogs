2012-09-05T00:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Newtoubuntu	Have you checked for error messages in /var/log/Xorg.0.log or from "dmesg"?
2012-09-05T00:21:00.000Z	Newtoubuntu	Jordan_U	no i have not. i am still learning. what is that exactly
2012-09-05T00:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Newtoubuntu	/var/log/Xorg.0.log is a log file specific to X.org, which is the base of your GUI. "dmesg" prints messages from the kernel.
