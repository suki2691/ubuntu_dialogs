2008-02-21T22:38:00.000Z	patrick_		halp! installed steam via wine. steam is working fine, but after i launched a game e.g. tf2, it will show that startup vid, then just close it and return to desktop. somebody already told me to use the restriceted ati drivers, but i had to deactivate them again since it screwed up my resolution completely, my whole screen was streched vertically... so what can i do?

2008-02-21T22:48:00.000Z	patrick_	squarebracket	no i couldnt change it
