2008-04-25T01:32:00.000Z	fliegenderfrosch	john47	how do you mean "on hardy"?
2008-04-25T01:33:00.000Z	john47	fliegenderfrosch	I mean has anyone used the hardy disk to install Ubuntu 8.04 within windows and dualbooted using the wubi install method...Flying frog - cool name!
2008-04-25T01:34:00.000Z	fliegenderfrosch	john47	i thought you meant installing ubuntu within ubuntu with wubi (maybe thats possible with wine? :) )
