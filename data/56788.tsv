2009-07-08T23:48:00.000Z	ltgg		 recently bought a removable hard drive, formatted it but cannot write to it as owner is 'root' ... how do I change this to logged-in user?  running 9.04
2009-07-08T23:49:00.000Z	nlko	ltgg	chown user /mnt/hardrive
2009-07-08T23:50:00.000Z	ltgg	nlko	thanks ... will try that
2009-07-08T23:50:00.000Z	nlko	ltgg	no worries
