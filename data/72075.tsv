2009-11-23T04:05:00.000Z	unkmar	Chun	yes.  that is very doable.
2009-11-23T04:07:00.000Z	Chun	unkmar	cool - any tips on where to start? Can I just run the installer from some location, if I mount the iso?
2009-11-23T04:09:00.000Z	unkmar	Chun	ask ActionParsnip. He appears to know more about that than I.
