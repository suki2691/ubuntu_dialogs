2008-06-15T04:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Wolphie_	look in system/admin/restricted drivers, adn see if the nvidia driver is still enabled
2008-06-15T04:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Wolphie_	go to nvidia-settings and adjust your resolutions..
2008-06-15T04:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Wolphie_	do you have nvidia-settings open?
