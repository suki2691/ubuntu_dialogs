2007-06-11T08:55:00.000Z	pajamian		hey everyone, I just installed Feisty, and am having problems with sound.  Basically I have an nvidia 6 channel chipset and am gettign sound out of the rear speakers only.  I fear that my hardware (chipset) is messed up, but can anyone here help me to find out if that really is the problem or if it's something else?
