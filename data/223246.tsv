2006-01-07T15:53:00.000Z	damnhil		I am using ubuntu5.04hoary. If I install openoffice2.0, will the old openoffice1.1 be removed?
2006-01-07T15:54:00.000Z	Seveas	damnhil	yes, but OO.o2 from hoary is a really old beta
2006-01-07T15:54:00.000Z	Seveas	damnhil	you'd better upgrade to breezy
2006-01-07T15:54:00.000Z	damnhil	Seveas	how can I upgrade from hoary to breezy? is that possible?
