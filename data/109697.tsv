2008-02-21T20:34:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	orgy_	use a burning program like gnomebaker, k3b or brasero to make it for you
2008-02-21T20:34:00.000Z	orgy_	erUSUL	so an iso is nothing more as a direct copy of the source?
2008-02-21T20:34:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	orgy_	or follow erUSUL console command which is faster
