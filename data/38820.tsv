2010-01-19T22:42:00.000Z	d1g1t4l_nrg		I wanted to find out how difficult other persons might have found in installing the ubuntu server.
2010-01-19T22:42:00.000Z	brad[werk]	d1g1t4l_nrg	I didn't find it difficult at all, I did a remote install using root on LVM on top of MD RAID1 and it's now a VM server
2010-01-19T22:43:00.000Z	brad[werk]	d1g1t4l_nrg	All steps were performed using the installation manager
