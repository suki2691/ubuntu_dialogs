2012-08-25T00:16:00.000Z	bakarat		i'm running 12.04 and after 31 days of uptime my computer had slowed downed noticeably it has 6 gig ram of which 2 was allocated to firefox (a lot but not that unusual after 30 days of many tabs) but more importantly, gnome-shell took up 3.3 gig! is there a known memory leak?

2012-08-25T00:17:00.000Z	bakarat	bekks	ye but firefox is not the issue, 2 gig is a lot but doable. the 3.3 gig of gnome-shell seems highly abnormal though?
