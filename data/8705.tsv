2011-10-15T21:41:00.000Z	Gargoylle		Hi all. I updated to 11.10 today. it screwed my system. I had gnome all setup. Now I only have unity. I hate it with a passion. sudo apt-get install gnome gave me a partially working gnome session. how can I fix it and remove unity from my system. an upgrade is not supposed to discard all previous settings like this.
2011-10-15T21:42:00.000Z	Gargoylle		Does anyone know how to cleanly remove unity and get a proper gnome session? otherwise I'll need to format and reinstall. while at it, I may try mint.
