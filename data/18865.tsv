2012-02-29T19:02:00.000Z	Husel		Hey, I've just installed Ubuntu, and I'm wondering where is the normal place to install programs, like C:\ or C:\Program Files on Windows? Is it File System?

2012-02-29T19:04:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Husel	 pragrams are installed in /usr/bin/ -- some config files may be stored in /home/your_user or in /hom/your_usr/.config
