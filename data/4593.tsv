2012-03-16T07:18:00.000Z	Dulak	Redjack1964	you want to add a path that is searched when you try to execute commands?
2012-03-16T07:18:00.000Z	Redjack1964	Dulak	not a command, but a include/ repertory.
2012-03-16T07:19:00.000Z	Dulak	Redjack1964	I am not sure what you need there, what exactly are you wanting to do?
