2010-09-08T13:23:00.000Z	DIFTOW		Hey, I have a quick question. I have 8 GB of system ram. How much HDD partition space for Swap drive?
2010-09-08T13:24:00.000Z	DIFTOW		Desktop, and yes.

2010-09-08T13:25:00.000Z	rww	DIFTOW	assuming you're not tight on hard-disk space, I'd throw a little bit extra on there, just to avoid the partition creator rounding down and messing things up
