2007-12-24T00:27:00.000Z	B0GDAN		There's one thing I need to ask and is not related to Ubuntu at all. I need to ask some US guy. The question is: where can I find a simple chat IRC server? Chat off-topic, not related to anything, just chat?
2007-12-24T00:28:00.000Z	ompaul	B0GDAN	chat in #ubuntu-offtopic  or freenode's #defocus
