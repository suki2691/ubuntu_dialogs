2011-05-03T01:52:00.000Z	profundo		I have just upgraded to 11.04 and on unity there are no toolbars anywhere, I just see a desktop. Moving the mouse to the edges of the screen doesn't do anything. I am using an nvidia 8600M GT. Is this a known problem?
2011-05-03T01:53:00.000Z	profundo		oh right, I have rebooted quite a few times, but still not seeing it
2011-05-03T01:55:00.000Z	Braiam	profundo	try changing to gnome classic
2011-05-03T01:55:00.000Z	profundo	Braiam	I am on ubuntu classic now and that works fine. But it would be nice to be able to use unity
