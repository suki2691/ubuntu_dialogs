2007-05-09T06:26:00.000Z	ub12		I get segmentation faults on programs like firefox. But if I reboot the seg faults go away. The seg fault will be something like cannot find a variable name. What is happenning?

2007-05-09T06:28:00.000Z	rukuartic	ub12	Thats rather odd. I'd say try a memtest... but thats really odd.
