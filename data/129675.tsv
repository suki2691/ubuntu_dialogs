2007-08-27T15:06:00.000Z	Cuzz		Hi, i have a HDD with two partitions. On the first partition (sda1) i installed Ubuntu 7.04 with all the updates. I didn't want to install the Nvidia XFX 8600GT drivers manually because i was afraid that it might not work. I decided to install Ubuntu 7.04 on the second partition (sda3). GRUB is however unable to find the first Ubuntu installation. Any ideas? Please , Thanks!
