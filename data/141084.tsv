2009-04-08T11:30:00.000Z	raylu	jurism	mount shows all mount points, sudo fdisk -l shows all disks (and patitions), and df -h may help you
2009-04-08T11:45:00.000Z	raylu	jurism	um, he probably should be installing from repos
2009-04-08T11:45:00.000Z	raylu	jurism	what do you mean you cannot 'see' it? fdisk -l?
