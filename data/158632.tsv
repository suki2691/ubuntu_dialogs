2008-05-27T01:13:00.000Z	ariqz		ok, I know a file exists, but when I goto places -> search for files. Select file system as folder, it doesn't find the file. WHY?
2008-05-27T01:13:00.000Z	ariqz		is the search not recursive? because that's just dumb
2008-05-27T01:14:00.000Z	Slart	ariqz	case sensitivity? the tracker hasn't updated the index yet and the file new? the search doesn't work the way you think it does
2008-05-27T01:15:00.000Z	Slart	ariqz	what is the name of the file you're looking for?... I don't speak windows.. sorry
