I got a message saying "The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required: libcompizconfig0 linux-headers-generic libdecoration0 libcompizconfig-backend-gconf compiz-plugins linux-headers-2.6.22-14-generic linux-headers-2.6.22-14 compiz-fusion-plugins-extra compiz compiz-core compiz-fusion-plugins-main compiz-gnome"

2007-10-22T04:50:00.000Z	murkyMurk	levander	i didn't check but i do know that if apt-get says they are no longer being used then they are redundant on your system
