2010-01-10T23:21:00.000Z	Misha		Hi folks. My old fileserver is running Hardy, now I'd like to move over to Karmic. What happens if I do a fresh install from the CD, without formatting my old drives and partitions? I presume old settings and installations will be lost? Should I go a step at a time, Karmic-Intrepid-Jaunty?
