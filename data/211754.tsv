2005-10-19T13:03:00.000Z	calamari		my hoary crashed yet again, now when I boot I have no desktop icons (or wallpaper, just brown).. ~/Desktop does have all my stuff.  Also, right clicking on the desktop has no effect.  What could be doing this?

2005-10-19T13:03:00.000Z	calamari	cjhcjhcjh	I will, but I want to fix this first
