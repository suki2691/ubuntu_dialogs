2009-02-12T08:24:00.000Z	jaxx2kde		hey i had a quick question.. suppose i have a tarball lying on my desktop.. and i go and install the drivers after extracting it and all.. can i delete the folder?
2009-02-12T08:24:00.000Z	mzz	jaxx2kde	probably, but don't install stuff by hand, use proper packages
2009-02-12T09:04:00.000Z	mzz	jaxx2kde	that sounds like you missed a ./configure (so there's no Makefile yet)
2009-02-12T09:08:00.000Z	jaxx2kde	mzz	redvamp128: i am trying to install the b43 drivers for my broadcom so that i can patch them in order to use aircrack
