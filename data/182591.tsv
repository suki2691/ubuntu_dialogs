2008-09-04T04:59:00.000Z	avis	bastid_raZor	no errors using dmesg | tail, however it doesn't automount
2008-09-04T05:00:00.000Z	avis	bastid_raZor	it claims that its attached, write protect being "off" (says that twice) some info about the sectors, and attached scsi generic
2008-09-04T05:02:00.000Z	avis	bastid_raZor	hmm. ok.  didn't know that.  for some reason my last one automounted just fine.  since this is for ubuntu backups i might try a supported linux fs, that will automount.  can you recommend any ?  resier4 looked interesting.  i'm not sure if its adoptable at this point
