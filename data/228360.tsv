2005-07-24T11:26:00.000Z	The_Vox	Gatton	a week to get usable speeds, 3 weeks to be as fast as I was on qwerty, a month and a half and I was 20WPM faster than on qwerty
2005-07-24T11:27:00.000Z	Gatton	The_Vox	good to know. I have been wanting to switch over but am not looking forward to the transition period :)
2005-07-24T11:27:00.000Z	The_Vox	Gatton	one recommendation: DO NOT SWITCH THE KEY CAPS OF YOUR KEYBOARD until you've learned dvorak...print the kboard layout and tape it somewhere you can see it with your head up...otherwise, you'll get in the habit of looking at the kboard while typing and that'll slow you dow
