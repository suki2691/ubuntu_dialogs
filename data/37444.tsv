2010-02-16T08:46:00.000Z	zeleftikam		hi all :) brand new ubuntu user here, installed 9.10 Server on brand new hardware, can't get networking going. it is physically linked by ethernet to my router, the light on the mobo is green, the cable check in the BIOS runs successfully. any idea where to start?
