2008-03-18T07:05:00.000Z	Netham45		is there any reason I can't access an incoming port 27015 on a new install of Ubuntu Desktop?
2008-03-18T07:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	Netham45	from outside your lan?
2008-03-18T07:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	Netham45	that's unusual if you have a program that's already opened that port. what are you running on that port?
2008-04-11T05:48:00.000Z	Scunizi	Netham45	plug it in and "lspci" in a terminal.. might work
