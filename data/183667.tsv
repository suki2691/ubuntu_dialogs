2007-09-08T10:22:00.000Z	Thurin1		I installed Ubuntu but was stuck with a refresh rate of 60hz no matter what, I know my monitor can do up to 85hz in high-res in windows... however I cannot find my V/H Syncs which Xorg asks for... does anyone know if there is a way to find this information in windows? - And would the same h/v sync values be reliable in Linux?
2007-09-08T10:23:00.000Z	Thurin1		Because I love Ubuntu... but I cannot stand 60hz :(
