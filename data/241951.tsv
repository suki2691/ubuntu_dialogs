2007-12-08T20:59:00.000Z	D[iph3rM		On a dual boot system with Vista installed first, how can I remove grub and return to just using windows (deleting the partition later) ?? Maybe rewrite the MBR in windows?
2007-12-08T21:00:00.000Z	astro76	D[iph3rM	boot with windows cd recovery mode, and use fixmbr
2007-12-08T21:00:00.000Z	astro76	D[iph3rM	but you might want to ask in #windows about vista, haven't used it
2007-12-08T21:01:00.000Z	astro76	D[iph3rM	I imagine it's still the same, no prob
