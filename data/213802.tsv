I would like to put a Linux LIVE CD on it so whenever I plug the drive into a computer I can have it boot from the USB drive and since its a live cd it would automagicly detect the hardware and just work on pretty much any computer.  So instead of carrying a live cd and my external drive. Is there a way I can put the CD on the Drive?
