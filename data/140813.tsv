2007-07-05T14:31:00.000Z	dboy		Can anyone lead me in the right direction on mounting an external hard drive?  Shows up when doing fdisk -l yet not listed under fstab, very lost while trying to search through google
2007-07-05T14:32:00.000Z	dboy		Do I need to add it to etc/fstab for the external hard drive to mount?
2007-07-05T14:32:00.000Z	cBau	dboy	is it ntfs/vfat/unformatted?
2007-07-05T14:34:00.000Z	cBau	dboy	I am really not experienced that area... my externals generally work, my only prob was with a phone, and I said screw it
