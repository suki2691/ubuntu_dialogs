2010-06-07T00:54:00.000Z	Slart	webroasters	sure there wasn't a 'f' in that somewhere?
2010-06-07T00:56:00.000Z	Slart	webroasters	I weren't here.. I just logged on.. but this channel (and it's participants) are pretty picky about the language.. bad words, even in abbreviations aren't allowed.. omfg would be considered bad.. omg shouldn't be a problem if you ask me
2010-06-07T00:57:00.000Z	Slart	webroasters	no worries
