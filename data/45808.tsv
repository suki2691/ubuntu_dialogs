2009-10-13T05:36:00.000Z	InitHello		ok, my girlfriend's computer (Jaunty, nVidia 7300 SE, nvidia-glx-180 installed) is having something that looks suspiciously like a kernel panic after running for a little while. Is it possible that I messed something up by installing a 32-bit flash plugin on her amd64 system, or should I me looking for something hardware-related?
