2007-09-07T11:06:00.000Z	sllik		I just installed the ubuntu server, and for some reason it can't read the data from the cdrom... any ideas?
2007-09-07T11:06:00.000Z	sllik		if I ls /media/cdrom there is nothing there
2007-09-07T11:07:00.000Z	Vlet	sllik	sudo mount /dev/cdrom perhaps
2007-09-07T11:10:00.000Z	sllik	Vlet	there is no cdrom in dev
