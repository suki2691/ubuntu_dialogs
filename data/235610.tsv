2006-04-25T08:06:00.000Z	CNAP		how long has dapper drake been out for?
2006-04-25T08:07:00.000Z	CNAP		ok, if not officially out then why is there already another upgrade for that out???
2006-04-25T08:08:00.000Z	CNAP		but wait, dapper drake is in beta too... i'm thinking the development versioning methodology is kind of whack at ubuntu...
2006-04-25T08:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	CNAP	the post-Dapper version hasn't been released yet, just announced (Edgy Eft, apparently)
