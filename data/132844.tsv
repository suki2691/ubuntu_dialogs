2010-11-05T17:22:00.000Z	Sembiance		My computer was not powered off correctly (power loss). Now when booting I'm just starting at the Ubuntu logo. Is there a Key Combination I can press to view a console log of what it is doing right now?
2010-11-05T17:22:00.000Z	Sembiance		I'd like to see the boot process. My guess is it's doing a disk check or something
2010-11-05T17:22:00.000Z	jamesstanley	Sembiance	i would try f2, ctrl-alt-f1, ctrl-alt-f2 in that order
2010-11-05T17:24:00.000Z	Sembiance	jamesstanley	tried those, none of them worked
