2008-08-26T03:04:00.000Z	Lapsus		I've accidentally removed the default network panel icon from the top bar, and now I can't select what wireless network to connect to. How can I get it back? I'm on ubuntu 8.04
2008-08-26T03:04:00.000Z	Siegfried	Lapsus	right click on the bar, add to panel
2008-08-26T03:05:00.000Z	Siegfried		then network monitor i guess
2008-08-26T03:05:00.000Z	Lapsus	Siegfried	I've done that, but I can't find the same network thinger that was there before :/
