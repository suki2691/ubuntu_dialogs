2006-06-04T11:02:00.000Z	TimothyP		Hi, I just installed ubuntu 6.06. My console is getting flooded with the following message:  [somenumber]  hda: error code: 0x70 sense_key: 0x02 asc: 0x06 ascq: 0x00
2006-06-04T11:02:00.000Z	TimothyP		and it doesn't stop
2006-06-04T11:04:00.000Z	Lingo	TimothyP	HDA means hard disk, but that's all I know. It's some error with the hard disk.
2006-06-04T11:05:00.000Z	Lingo	TimothyP	Then I have no idea how HDA got there. Try that page.
