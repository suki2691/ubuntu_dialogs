2011-12-10T05:31:00.000Z	frotzed	excelsior	what version?
2011-12-10T05:33:00.000Z	frotzed	excelsior	maybe gedit ~/.local/share/applications/name.desktop
2011-12-10T05:41:00.000Z	excelsior	frotzed	thanks, but no cigar. I'm using 10.10, any other thoughts about where to find a way to edit the Applications menu? Someone has managed to mess it up, and I can't get the Office menu back where it belongs.
