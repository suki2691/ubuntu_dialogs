2008-01-04T20:07:00.000Z	pike_	sylverfox	what file system?
2008-01-04T20:08:00.000Z	pike_	sylverfox	defaults  should be only thing in fstab id think.. now remember that the ext3 file system supports perm so if you need access to a dir or fileyou need to chown or chmod it like you would a dir in /
2008-01-04T20:09:00.000Z	pike_	sylverfox	you can though test by sudo mount -o remount,rw /mountpoint i guess
