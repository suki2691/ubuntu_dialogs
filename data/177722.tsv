2008-01-24T01:00:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Boglizk	I have never seen it crash...  Have you recenty installed things from outside official repos or upgrades?
2008-01-24T01:01:00.000Z	Boglizk	Jack_Sparrow	Uhm.. not really only some command line stuffs
2008-01-24T01:02:00.000Z	Boglizk	Jack_Sparrow	I found the bugreport. I'll be looking in to it.
