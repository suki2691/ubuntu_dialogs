2008-04-30T05:37:00.000Z	damaltor_	andreskru	yes. linux uses ram in another way then windows. having it filled is normal state.
2008-04-30T05:38:00.000Z	andreskru	damaltor_	 i used gutsy 32 bit and never take more than 300 mb
2008-04-30T05:39:00.000Z	damaltor_	andreskru	hmm maybe then the 32bit version needs just less ram... but i dont think thats a problem. work with it a time and see if it is slower.
