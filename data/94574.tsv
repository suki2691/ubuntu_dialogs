2008-04-17T16:45:00.000Z	grom358		I've seen servers with eth0:0 and eth0:1 at work. Any pointers on how you can setup such a thing?
2008-04-17T16:47:00.000Z	grom358		also.. can you use a machine that already has ubuntu updates to update another ubuntu machine?
2008-04-17T16:48:00.000Z	arvind_k	grom358	that would be difficult
