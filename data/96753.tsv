2008-05-06T15:59:00.000Z	lukassi		Hi there - I just wanted to check something quickly. Is Firefox 2 still in the Hardy repository? I want to upgrade, but a few sites don't run Java properly with 3.0. I will report this to the Moz team and the sites but in the meantime I need to know I won't be stuck!
2008-05-06T16:00:00.000Z	lukassi		That's what I read!
2008-05-06T16:01:00.000Z	lukassi		That's great - thanks to all of you I will now upgrade - bye
