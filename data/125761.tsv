2007-08-06T07:58:00.000Z	ubnuu2		Ubuntu Dapper 6.06 LTS server vs Ubuntu Feisty 7.04 server? Which one recommended?
2007-08-06T07:58:00.000Z	IdleOne	ubnuu2	6.06 has 5 years worth of support
2007-08-06T07:59:00.000Z	IdleOne	ubnuu2	yes
2007-08-06T08:00:00.000Z	ubnuu2	IdleOne	OK, good to hear. Think I would prefer feisty then for newer packages
