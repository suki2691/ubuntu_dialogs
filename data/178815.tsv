2010-05-12T17:41:00.000Z	noric		I have some exciting news.  There is a package named cvoicecontrol, written in 2000, that allows you to map speech phrases to unix commands.  As far as I can tell, no one has got it working for 5 years or so, and more or less left it for dead.  I managed to get it up and running last night : - ).  "play music"  awesome!
