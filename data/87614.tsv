2008-06-15T23:50:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	herteljt	What kind of motherboard issue? Check out my system spec here if you have the time, currently nothing is working on my computer except for the CDROM drives. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=826011&page=2

The strange thing is I can install Ubuntu on the drive but it won't boot, my old drive was a SATA as well but it worked just fine... :-/
