2010-08-21T17:39:00.000Z	teliti		Hello. I do have a netbook with a bcm4315 chipset. normally the hardware-driver-installer shows me two drivers: b24 and sta. But this install I only see the sta driver. How do I get the b24 driver? In synaptic I only could find the fwcutter for the b24 driver ...?
2010-08-21T17:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	teliti	 does the sta driver not work?
2010-08-21T17:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	teliti	 i had an odd laptop. that used the sta driver.. but the silly sta module wouldent autoload.. not sure why that was
2010-08-21T17:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	teliti	 yea. I had similer issues.. but that laptop is now gone. :)
