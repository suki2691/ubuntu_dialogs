2010-05-16T14:25:00.000Z	fcoo_21		I use Ubuntu 10.04. I had SunJava and worked fine with eclipse and Jdownloader. But now i installed OpenJDK to try it. Now Jdownloader opening automatically with "Java -jar /Jdownloader.jar" command. But i want as default the SunJava. And Eclipse now does not have SunJava as compiler but OpenJDK. Can someone help me to change them please?
