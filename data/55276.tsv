2011-06-13T05:37:00.000Z	Zulaika		I'm new to Linux and I'm interested in installing Ubuntu. I read that people are not happy with the latest release of Ubuntu. Which version should I install?

2011-06-13T05:39:00.000Z	edbian	Zulaika	The latest (supposedly unpopular) version is 11.04.  You can run unity (the unpopular interface) or you can run gnome 2.x (which is the old interface).
2011-06-13T05:40:00.000Z	edbian	Zulaika	Yes.  Use the liveCD to try Ubuntu (and either interface) without installing
