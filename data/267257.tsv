2010-07-15T04:17:00.000Z	Nimphious		Is there any way to access a network share on the desktop through SSH?
2010-07-15T04:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Nimphious	 for linux to linux. you can access a ssh machine  with  sshfs or the gnome connect to server. feature as if it was a local dir
2010-07-15T04:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Nimphious	 thats because its a 'special' thing. not a real directory on teh desktop
2010-07-15T04:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Nimphious	 it may be in ~/.gvfs
