2011-06-24T18:06:00.000Z	bazhang	rns	firefox?
2011-06-24T18:06:00.000Z	bazhang	rns	firefox is a security update in this case
2011-06-24T18:08:00.000Z	bazhang	rns	if you are on 11.04 simply sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade will leave you with firefox 5
2011-06-24T18:10:00.000Z	rns	bazhang	so if I had django running on my system and I did sudo apt-get update it would only give me security updates?
