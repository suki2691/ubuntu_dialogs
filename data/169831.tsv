2006-09-08T06:24:00.000Z	ColonelPanic001		Ubuntu, for the second time in about 2 or 3 days, just randomly restarted. Anything recent happen with updates or something by chance?
2006-09-08T06:24:00.000Z	ColonelPanic001		I wasn't doing anything crazy. Just playing Amarok and downloading a PDF in firefox. :\
2006-09-08T06:26:00.000Z	ColonelPanic001		Any ideas on my thing, by chance? Just seems odd that seemingly for no reason at all, ubuntu rebotoed. Hard reboot, like I hit the power switch
2006-09-08T06:27:00.000Z	atroWork	ColonelPanic001	sorry, I use amarok constantly and download pdfs from time to time, I've experience no problems lately
