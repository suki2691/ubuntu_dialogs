2012-03-12T06:02:00.000Z	CacheMoney	`Korvin	do you have to cross your mouse over to the next screen vertically or horizontally?
2012-03-12T06:03:00.000Z	CacheMoney	`Korvin	for example, only when I place the screens on top of one another in the System Settings > Hardware > Displays  can I get into 'separate mode'
2012-03-12T06:04:00.000Z	CacheMoney	`Korvin	where is the screen resize menu?
