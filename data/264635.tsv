2004-10-08T10:52:00.000Z	loopback1		First time user of an IRC so I am not certain what to do or the house rules. Please bear with me. I've just installed Ubuntu and am excited about it. I'd like to start off adding Java and Flash. But I'm not sure how to go about it. Can anybody point me in the right direction? Thanks.
