2008-03-16T13:11:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	Kirrika	what versin of azureus
2008-03-16T13:15:00.000Z	TrustNoOne	Kirrika	for that versin of azureus i just make sure i have latest java and icedtea and then i download vuze tarball, extract to usr/share and run the script to start it up, i made shortcuts to that script for start menu
