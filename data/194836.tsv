2006-03-20T16:37:00.000Z	GutterPunk		Hi, is anyone in here using k3b? I am wondering why I don't get any FIFO or Device buffer info when I'm burning dvd images.
2006-03-20T16:37:00.000Z	GutterPunk		It's also burning very slowly
2006-03-20T16:38:00.000Z	GutterPunk		it constantly stops working
2006-03-20T16:38:00.000Z	fluxt	GutterPunk	also check the burn speed in the config
