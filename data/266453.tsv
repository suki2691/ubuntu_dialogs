2009-05-14T01:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_freddy_	 the live desktpp cd has a 'install' menu item you canuse also
2009-05-14T01:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_freddy_	 they might not have the same options.. check the menu and see..
2009-05-14T06:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	_freddy_	 they have also changed some otther things.. I would stick to normal ubuntu if you can
