2008-11-16T17:13:00.000Z	Customer		Hello everyone.  I have a question about the new Ultimate Edition 2.0 Gamers release and Wubi. How do I install a distro that is not part of the Wubi (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu) installer using Wubi? I want to install the Ultimate Edition Gamers 2.0... http://ultimateedition.info/ultimate-edition-20/

2008-11-16T17:14:00.000Z	Customer		So, there's no channel for ultimate support?
