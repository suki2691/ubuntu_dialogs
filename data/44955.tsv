2012-02-03T07:21:00.000Z	felipe_Brz		I run ubuntu 11.04. Can I make my apt-get install command point to the repositories of the newer Ubuntu versions so I can get newer software?

2012-02-03T07:23:00.000Z	felipe_Brz	flowerpot	hmm...so if I want to say, download a newer version of php than what's available in my repo, then I have to add a 3rd party PPA?
