2007-08-27T15:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	randoman	what exactly are you trying to do?
2007-08-27T15:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	randoman	by default you haven't got any ports open
2007-08-27T15:03:00.000Z	gordonjcp	randoman	a firewall isn't going to improve matters from there, and in fact is just going to be one more thing to fall off and break
