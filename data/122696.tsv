2007-09-04T09:17:00.000Z	ryushe_		greetings, quick question, I got an older laptop here (3 year old Toshiba Sattelite) and I'm trying to install Ubuntu via the 'Install' link from the live cd, is it normal that this takes a very very long time to even show the window borders of the app? Is there a text based way to install Ubuntu?
