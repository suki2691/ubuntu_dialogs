And I can do an ldapsearch from a remote machine and pull the info from the ldap server. But none of the info is showing up in apple addressbook, outlook, or outlook express.

2008-02-06T01:23:00.000Z	isleshocky77	pike_	Yeah. the manuals don't really help that much. I had a lot of going back and forth between root user setup in config in phpldapadmin to finally being able to login to it using a user.
