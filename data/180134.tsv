2006-07-10T13:21:00.000Z	farchord		hey guys, I have a major problem. I currently am on the live CD of ubuntu. But I want to install it, but for some reason, it detects my AGP card as PCI (!?) and I am stuck on a 680x480 resolution, which prevents me from installing, because the install window is too big.
2006-07-10T13:21:00.000Z	farchord		What can I do!?
2006-07-10T13:22:00.000Z	farchord		Anyone know? :S
