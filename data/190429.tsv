2006-06-01T15:42:00.000Z	scifi		ive just rebooted after upgrading to dapper and my xserver failed, can anyone help ?
2006-06-01T15:42:00.000Z	scifi		would it be safe to replace current xserver.conf with my saved conf from breezy install ?

2006-06-01T15:44:00.000Z	scifi	delire	if i do that the backup might replace the backup that i want to use lol
