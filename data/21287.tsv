However, my problem began when I decided to check for "Additional Drivers". Surely an Nvidia driver was available and it was recommended so I installed it, however, it appears that it broke my fancy graphics and now would occasionally throw me to the terminal, no GUI only text, whenever I restart.  Anyone knows what I should do to fix this?
