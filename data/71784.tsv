2009-10-23T02:30:00.000Z	mikebeecham1		Hi guys...I've noticed that Ubuntu has updated Firefox to Shiretoko 3.5.  However, my online bank does not support this browser....can I revert back in any way?

2009-10-23T02:34:00.000Z	mikebeecham1	erUSUL	thanks very much...just installed it and it works.  I find it amusing that the switcher extension does not offer Firefox as an option :D
