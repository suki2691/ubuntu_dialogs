2011-04-09T07:20:00.000Z	Jasen_		I have an issue. I was messing with the setting for compiz and I disabled opengl which caused unity to crash, and even when i re-enabled everything and restarted ubuntu, unity is still broken. Anybody know why unity wont start? Compiz returns with "Couldn't open display"
