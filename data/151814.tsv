2008-08-27T08:56:00.000Z	therealnanotube	knoppix	probably in "/usr/share/fonts"
2008-08-27T08:57:00.000Z	knoppix	therealnanotube	you are right, do you know if i need "true type" or "type1" (i want to copy to a windows box)
2008-08-27T08:57:00.000Z	therealnanotube	knoppix	well, truetype will definitely work on windows. don't know whether type1 will. why not copy both and try? :)
