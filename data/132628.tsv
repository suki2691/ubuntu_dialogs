It boots to a graphical login screen, I enter my credentials and the normal KDE loading thing appears. Next, the screen fades to black and a KDE wallet authorization thing displays. I enter my password to unlock the wallet for this session. The wallet screen goes away and I'm left with a black screen and a mouse cursor. That's it. I can Alt+F2 to run commands and such
2009-12-19T16:56:00.000Z	cweagans		I'd really like my desktop back. How do I fix this?

2009-12-19T16:58:00.000Z	cweagans	ardchoille	thanks :)
