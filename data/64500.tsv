2009-03-23T23:01:00.000Z	josh-l		okay another question, can i set a different browser (no konqueror) as default for all other programs ? or do i need to set it per program kind of thing?

2009-03-23T23:03:00.000Z	josh-l	sebsebseb	right but I want to change it from konqueror to firefox... kubuntu
2009-03-23T23:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	josh-l	ok so in the Firefox settings,  set it as the default browser
