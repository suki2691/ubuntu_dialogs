2011-01-27T04:48:00.000Z	charas		VPS problem: I created a new user on my Ubuntu VPS. Now when I enter "who" it only shows "root" user. What happened to my newly created user?

2011-01-27T04:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	charas	ouch jrib already told you as much ... ;P
2011-01-27T04:50:00.000Z	charas	erUSUL	Yeah I guess. I should login from the new user to make it "active"
