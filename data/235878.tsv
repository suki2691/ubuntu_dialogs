2011-05-24T05:46:00.000Z	pj		Hey, I'm having trouble re-installing a package.  Apparently it wants to run a post-removal script that errors out because it has already removed a file required by the script.  I need to tell dpkg to go ahead and forcibly remove the package anyways so I can turn around and install it again.  How do I do that?

2011-05-24T05:49:00.000Z	pj	maco	no --force-remove, but I may just try --force-all, heh
