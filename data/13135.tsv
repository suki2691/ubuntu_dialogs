2011-07-02T05:17:00.000Z	Monotoko		having a little bit of an issue...when I shut down, my mouse light stays on...how can I completely shut off power to it?

2011-07-02T05:19:00.000Z	Monotoko	astraljava	yeah I thought that...the light bugs me while I sleep so I have to unplug it, was just wondering if there was a way to just shut off the power to it ^_^
2011-07-02T05:20:00.000Z	astraljava	Monotoko	No idea what to do there, on mine the light shuts off when it goes idle. Sorry I can't be of assistance with that.
