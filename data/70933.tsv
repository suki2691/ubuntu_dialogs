2010-09-06T08:37:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Steve132	if you need 3D from fglrx, support for some cards has been discontinued. The open source 'radeon' works pretty well, depending on your needs.
2010-09-06T08:38:00.000Z	Steve132	prince_jammys	Yeah, I need the proprietary driver support, because I need OpenGL4 for my job
2010-09-06T08:38:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Steve132	check if your card is supported.
