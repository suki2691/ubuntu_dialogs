2006-04-01T17:33:00.000Z	TheFaction20	Madpilot	oh, i figured that out in like 5 minutes of messing around with it. I thought there were like things you could modify that made certain things run differently i guess
2006-04-01T17:34:00.000Z	Madpilot	TheFaction20	you can, it just depends on which things you want to modify...
