2010-10-06T05:26:00.000Z	neil_d		I think there is something screwy here "service gdm reload" get me an error "reload: Unknown instance:".... what can I do about it?
2010-10-06T05:26:00.000Z	bastidrazor	neil_d	instead of reload use restart.
2010-10-06T05:27:00.000Z	neil_d	bastidrazor	same error.
2010-10-06T05:28:00.000Z	neil_d	bastidrazor	a 'stop' then a 'start' seemed to work.
