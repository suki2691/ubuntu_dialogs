2008-04-15T16:11:00.000Z	g[r]eek	pajamian	Yup. mjbrooks pointed out that although this does seem to do work on the pc before turning it off, it's not the same a normal shut down
2008-04-15T16:11:00.000Z	pajamian	g[r]eek	correct, you should not shut down the computer that way except as a last resort.
