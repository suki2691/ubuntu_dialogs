2008-09-19T09:20:00.000Z	harriseldon	Ninjara	use lsof
2008-09-19T09:22:00.000Z	Ninjara	harriseldon	So.. 'lsof |grep /dev/cdrom' or something?
2008-09-19T09:23:00.000Z	harriseldon	Ninjara	that would check if a process is accessing the raw cdrom device. If it is accessing a file that is mounted, you can use mount first to list mounted filesystems and replace /dev/cdrom with the mount point
