2009-03-07T16:53:00.000Z	emil		I have a problem that NX Free won't work on any port other than 22 :|
2009-03-07T16:53:00.000Z	emil		why's that?
2009-03-07T16:55:00.000Z	oCean_	emil	because that's were sshd runs by default. See here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeNX#Configuring%20SSH%20port howto change that port
