2007-12-05T01:02:00.000Z	kelsin	sanguisdex	make sure apache writes them group writable (maybe change umask to 002) then add yourselve to the www-data group
2007-12-05T01:02:00.000Z	kelsin	sanguisdex	obviously there are security things to consider here if you need to
2007-12-05T01:06:00.000Z	kelsin	sanguisdex	you need to get read permissions (and probably write) on the files, so either add yourself to the group or look in apache configs at having it output the files and chown them to a new user
