2006-09-16T13:07:00.000Z	pilsun		installing ubuntu on a system with no CD/Disk drive, I switched the harddrive out into a system with CD drive, installed, worked fine, but when replacing the HD to its orig system X won't start
2006-09-16T13:08:00.000Z	pilsun		the vid card is different, is there a way to get ubuntu to auto-detect the new card?
