2011-06-30T04:16:00.000Z	RickZilla		I'd like to run an application directly from a folder. What is the correct way to do this?
2011-06-30T04:18:00.000Z	RickZilla		How do I do that from terminal?  I'm not real clear with terminal commands
2011-06-30T04:19:00.000Z	xangua	RickZilla	how about just open the directory, and double clic on the thunderbird file to run it
2011-06-30T04:19:00.000Z	RickZilla	xangua	It asks to open in terminal, I say yes, then it disappears
