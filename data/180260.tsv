2012-10-26T03:13:00.000Z	Divzro		Hello - I trying to setup a Ubuntu server on a Dell mini 1012 (1gb Ram, 1tb drive) - Is 12.4 my best bet? any recommendations?
2012-10-26T03:13:00.000Z	jrib	Divzro	I'd recommend latest LTS (supported for 5 years after release), which is 12.04 :)
2012-10-26T03:14:00.000Z	jrib	Divzro	if more recent packaging is more important than long term support, then you could go with 12.10 (supported for 18 months after release)
2012-10-26T03:15:00.000Z	jrib	Divzro	should me plenty
