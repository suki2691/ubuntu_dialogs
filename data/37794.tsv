2010-08-21T04:22:00.000Z	rww	segaloco	plymouth is new, mountall was in karmic (but didn't depend plymouth there)
2010-08-21T04:32:00.000Z	rww	segaloco	remove whichever plymouth-theme-* packages you have installed
2010-08-21T04:33:00.000Z	segaloco	rww	i just have plymouth, plymouth-x11, and libplymouth
