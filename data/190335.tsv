2008-01-05T15:30:00.000Z	gourdin		is there a way back when installing kde4rc2 on gusty ?
2008-01-05T15:30:00.000Z	khermans	gourdin	purge it?
2008-01-05T15:31:00.000Z	gourdin	khermans	some new 3.5.8 package are installed, so I don't know if just purging kde4 is a way back
2008-01-05T15:32:00.000Z	khermans	gourdin	try removing and reinstalling the old version
