2012-10-26T03:34:00.000Z	Nerp		do you guys know of any good utilities for examining memory usage other than free and vmstat?
2012-10-26T03:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Nerp	conky can do it
2012-10-26T03:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Nerp	could try:  top    too
2012-10-26T03:35:00.000Z	Nerp	ActionParsnip	I mean in a more granular sense, comparing the output of free/vmstat and top/htop shows some strange discrepancies.
