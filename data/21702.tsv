2011-05-08T23:45:00.000Z	mongy		is there a way to format an ext filesystem and have it use 777 permissions on whatever box yo use it on ?  its root:root and 755 otherwise.
2011-05-08T23:46:00.000Z	tensorpudding	mongy	permissions are not set by the filesystem
2011-05-08T23:47:00.000Z	tensorpudding	mongy	the only way to do that would be from userspace
2011-05-08T23:47:00.000Z	mongy	tensorpudding	figured..  ok thx
