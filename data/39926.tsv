2010-01-08T19:22:00.000Z	_cb		Installed Ubuntu 9.10 no sound on my USB headphones. Booted to XP Sound on headphones so headphones are ok. Clicked Volume Icon on the right of the screen and turned to max. Still no sound. How do I fix?

2010-01-08T19:24:00.000Z	_cb	DocPlatypus	is that on preferences-->Sound-->Hardware and changing output?
2010-01-08T19:30:00.000Z	DocPlatypus	_cb	that could also be your problem, not set to output through the headphones
