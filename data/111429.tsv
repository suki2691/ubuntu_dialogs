2011-06-05T06:24:00.000Z	xio3		i was hoping someone could help me figure out what i'm doing wrong. I would like to generate a bunch of private/pub keys on a server and then package them in a .deb (one key per .deb file) so that a script could connect with ssh and do some port forwarding using passwordess logins. I had no problem generating a public/private key pair on the client and then uploading it and adding it to a authorized_keys2 file.  problem comes in when i try
