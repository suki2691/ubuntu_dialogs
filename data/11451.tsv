2011-08-06T15:32:00.000Z	ThePub	auronandace	readers are just that, readers.  they don't offer any sort of annotation.
2011-08-06T15:33:00.000Z	ThePub	auronandace	ever use full acrobat on Windows or Mac that has annotation support?  It's pretty nifty, lets you markup a PDF with notes, etc then print those off.
2011-08-06T15:34:00.000Z	auronandace	ThePub	sorry, never needed them and i can't stand adobe software (you could try using it in wine or a windows vm)
