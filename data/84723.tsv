2009-03-02T09:59:00.000Z	^paradox^		ok i have another quick question
2009-03-02T10:01:00.000Z	^paradox^		every time i tried to cd into the folder NES roms it kept saying no such file or directory until finally added an underscore between NES and roms
2009-03-02T10:01:00.000Z	^paradox^		how do i cd into other such folders that have no underscores?
2009-03-02T10:01:00.000Z	jtaji	^paradox^	 cd like\ this or cd "like this"
