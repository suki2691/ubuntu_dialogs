2011-09-26T14:35:00.000Z	pamwe_chete		shotwell is rubbish because it doesn't convert (eg jpg to png) and doesn't resize photos
2011-09-26T14:36:00.000Z	KIAaze	pamwe_chete	then what is better? :)
2011-09-26T14:37:00.000Z	pamwe_chete	KIAaze	i guess i'm hoping the devs improve shotwell, as it's a default app
