2007-05-30T13:06:00.000Z	deviantintegral		I need some help with a kernel panic I'm having with the 7.04 amd64 rescue CD. I'm copying a few hundred gigs of data off of an LVM/raid5 volume to a regular HD, and it kernel panics at some point through the copy. Unfortunately, the panic msg scrolls off the screen so I only have the end... any suggestions?

2007-05-30T13:09:00.000Z	deviantintegral	deviantintegral	symlink /var/log to the thumbdrive?
