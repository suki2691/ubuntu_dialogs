2011-03-21T07:43:00.000Z	lament		hello, i'm trying to install ubuntu 10.10 from a cd on a macbook4,1 following the instructions on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBook4-1/Maverick . The instructions say that to enable AirPort I need to enable an additional driver for BCM4328. But I don't have any additional drivers.
2011-03-21T07:44:00.000Z	lament		When i went to System -> Administration -> Additional Drivers, it actually tried to access the network to search for them.
2011-03-21T07:44:00.000Z	lament		do i have to connect wired first to get the drivers?
