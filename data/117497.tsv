2007-10-11T15:47:00.000Z	digitalspaghetti		I'm trying to connect to a VPN, but it seems my VPNC client has stopped, but when i try to reconnect I get vpnc: binding to 0.0.0.0:4500: Address already in use
2007-10-11T15:47:00.000Z	digitalspaghetti		does anyone know a way I can unbind it so I can start it again?
2007-10-11T15:48:00.000Z	digitalspaghetti		the pid has stopped
2007-10-11T15:48:00.000Z	ruz322	digitalspaghetti	you should be able to stop and restart the service, let me look, i've never used it
