2008-06-07T18:40:00.000Z	PeterP24		Hi; How can I add the hardy repositories in gutsy?
2008-06-07T18:41:00.000Z	legend2440	PeterP24	you want to replace gutsy repos with hardy? or add hardy to gutsy repos and have both?
2008-06-07T18:44:00.000Z	legend2440	PeterP24	wouldn't that seriously mess things up?
2008-06-07T18:51:00.000Z	legend2440	PeterP24	gutsy and hardy have differences. using hardy repos on gutsy could break something i would think. never tried it myself though
