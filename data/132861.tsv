2007-11-01T09:08:00.000Z	cwgannon		what's the best way to stop a process that is using 100% of the CPU?  if, say, the gnome system monitor won't even respond
2007-11-01T09:09:00.000Z	pirate	cwgannon	I have no real idea what I'm doing, but in an emergency like that I'd just ctrl+alt+backspace
2007-11-01T09:10:00.000Z	cwgannon	pirate	yeah, that's what i've been forced to do.  amarok can be a real ass about looping through songs when it can't make the audio device its own
