2005-09-13T07:20:00.000Z	bole		Hi! I have just installed ubuntu 5.04 but obviously I have missed to set root password. Can anybody help me what do I have to do? Is there any default root password if I have missed to put it?

2005-09-13T07:20:00.000Z	BlueEagle	bole	That also got me the 1st time I installed :)
2005-09-13T07:21:00.000Z	BlueEagle	bole	however the sudo scheme makes me stay logged in as root much more seldom and is actually "a good idea"(tm)
