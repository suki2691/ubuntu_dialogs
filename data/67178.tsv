2009-10-24T21:32:00.000Z	Halitech	peterkirn	in theory no
2009-10-24T21:33:00.000Z	Halitech	peterkirn	but you may not want to try upgrading on thursday, the servers will be nuts with people downloading, might want to wait a few days for the traffic to calm down
2009-10-24T21:34:00.000Z	peterkirn	Halitech	yeah, agreed :) I won't be in that much of a rush, particularly if I do get RC working!
