2006-12-19T08:40:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	mattfletcher	yes it would. file a bugreport :)
2006-12-19T08:42:00.000Z	mattfletcher	nolimitsoya	i have very vague recollections of such a conversation. don't recall where it was held though. i think it could have been launchpad
2006-12-19T08:42:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	mattfletcher	then a search might be in order before filing the bug. anyhow, if you come up with a good idea like this, a bug should be filed
