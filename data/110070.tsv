2010-06-16T13:59:00.000Z	Anarhist		is it possible to upgrade from 9.10 to 10.4 from the net, but to change from normal install to netbook, or do i have to reinstall?
2010-06-16T14:00:00.000Z	Anarhist		ok, thanks
2010-06-16T14:00:00.000Z	soreau	Anarhist	I would always recommend a clean install to avoid potential upgrade caveats
2010-06-16T14:01:00.000Z	Anarhist	soreau	i've had couple of experiences with ubuntu when upgrading actually produced a better system than a clean install
