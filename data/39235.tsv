2011-11-19T09:43:00.000Z	_6i	bullgard4	what settings do you mean? -- i already tried to set the mic input to capture, also turned on the separate "capture" button/column/input/field maxed out rec volume (all in the recording section (after F4)), and nothing changed, just like when i tried playing with the comboboxes and sliders in the sound settings window
2011-11-19T09:46:00.000Z	bullgard4	_6i	I mean the settings that alsamixer allows. They are a finite set. This set depends on the hardware of your computer. --  If you did do all that then there exists another misconfiguration of your audio beyond alsamixer. This sometimes happens and is often difficult to find.
2011-11-19T09:50:00.000Z	_6i	bullgard4	also, sound settings and alsamixer does not have a mic boost option, but amixer does -- however it is not needed to record (simply turning up mic vol does the trick with amixer); also, mic and alsa work well from a live boot, and they worked well before, but recently i played with using jack for a couple of apps at the same time, and probably my actions misconfigured something unintentionally; i already checked the the help links excep
