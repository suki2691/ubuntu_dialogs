2008-06-04T12:59:00.000Z	CrypTom		I don't get a desktop after login (ubuntu hardy), only the background image is shown. Any ideas?
2008-06-04T13:00:00.000Z	FreezeHeat	CrypTom	did you resize your screen?
2008-06-04T13:01:00.000Z	CrypTom	FreezeHeat	no, I can start gnome-panel from the console with: gnome-panel --display=:0 and it shows up
2008-06-04T13:02:00.000Z	CrypTom	FreezeHeat	seems like the login process is not entirely finished
