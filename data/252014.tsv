2005-10-18T10:40:00.000Z	bretzel		archive.ubuntu.com is overloaded! I need software but I cannot download anything -- just not able to start connection ---
2005-10-18T10:40:00.000Z	bretzel		In fact this is funny and good news -- Ubuntu is getting greatly popular! :-)
2005-10-18T10:41:00.000Z	eyequeue	bretzel	 notmally, id suggest you use ca.archive.ubuntu.com, but that's loaded down too, but do try another mirror (Or wait a day or three)
