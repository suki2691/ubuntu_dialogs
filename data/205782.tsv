2005-12-02T08:44:00.000Z	ricky_ds		I've installed beagle but it doesn't start the daemon on boot, even though I told him to do so. What's the problem?
2005-12-02T08:45:00.000Z	topyli	ricky_ds	it's supposed to only run when you log in, not at boot. add it to your session startup
2005-12-02T08:49:00.000Z	ricky_ds	topyli	how would I do that?
2005-12-02T08:50:00.000Z	topyli	ricky_ds	system -> preferences -> sessions -> startup programs
