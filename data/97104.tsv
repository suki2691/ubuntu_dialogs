2008-04-16T17:14:00.000Z	Lainy		Hello, my MPD display on conky displays a Japanese song title as boxes. I have the following relevant lines in my config: 'override_utf8_locale yes' and 'xftfont Terminus:size=8', the same font I use in my console (which is able to view the Japanese song title perfectly). What do I need to do to view the song title correctly? Thanks for any help.
