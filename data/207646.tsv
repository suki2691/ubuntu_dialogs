2005-11-16T10:21:00.000Z	b1n0ry	thomasamoht	i'm not installing ATI drivers, i'm just trying to get the LiveCD to boot. i don't have an ATI card.
2005-11-16T10:22:00.000Z	b1n0ry	thomasamoht	i don't know what it doesn't work with. it starts going fine then gives me a red screen that says that it failed "Entering Preinstalled Session"
2005-11-16T10:29:00.000Z	b1n0ry	thomasamoht	i dunno, i first loaded it up in a virtual pc and it worked ok (except for x doesn't work real well with vpc) so i booted up the whole system. that's when it had the problem. i did the media validation and compared hashes.
