2009-12-23T01:03:00.000Z	inclement		Ubuntu has very nicely setup my dual monitors for me, but I'm not sure what it's actually using for it. How do I find out whether it's using xinerama or something specific to my graphics card/driver (or is it just always xinerama?) ?

2009-12-23T01:03:00.000Z	maco	inclement	the xrandr command can do that
