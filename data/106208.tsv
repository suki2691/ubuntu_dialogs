2008-04-04T18:05:00.000Z	Professor_K		I have a small question: I have a Samsung Q45, and it's a pain to install any unix based system on it because it's not fully compatible (acpi problems mainly), will the new version of ubuntu work better on it?

2008-04-04T18:07:00.000Z	Professor_K	ItchyHoBo	I tried a lot (too much?) with gutsy and it is really a pain, I hope problems will be solved in hardy (but I doubt :S)
