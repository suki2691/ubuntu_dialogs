2010-03-08T22:12:00.000Z	Hellhound666		Hi all, I have a little question here...
2010-03-08T22:12:00.000Z	Hellhound666		for some reason I can't connect to the wireless networks in this area, however when I boot into windows 7 they connect.  What's the prob?
2010-03-08T22:13:00.000Z	Hellhound666		It seems some of them I can connect to but there are problems at times.
