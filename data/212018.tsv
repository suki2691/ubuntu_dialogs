2006-06-22T12:15:00.000Z	eps	KenSentMe	then that probably isn't a ascii char...but you can still copy it using the copy button and then just paste into open office
2006-06-22T12:16:00.000Z	KenSentMe	eps	same goes for letter d , U+0064
2006-06-22T12:17:00.000Z	KenSentMe	eps	ah, i see how it works, you can use U+00F1
