2009-03-06T05:10:00.000Z	sprinkmeier_	hacker_kid	just about anything that will display it (eog, ff, gimp, ....) should be able to print it.
2009-03-06T05:11:00.000Z	hacker_kid	sprinkmeier_	thats not what im saying, if i hit print in an application i can choose "Print to File" to save as a pdf or postscript. i need to save as a jpeg
2009-03-06T05:12:00.000Z	sprinkmeier_	hacker_kid	ok... misunderstood question. Save as  PDF, then chain pdftoppm and ppmtojpeg together
