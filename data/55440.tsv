2009-08-08T03:59:00.000Z	Pulsewidth		Any idea why memtest86+ error count is increasing (currently 3), but only 1 failed test is listed?
2009-08-08T03:59:00.000Z	edbian	Pulsewidth	It will run every time to see if the other tests are also failed
2009-08-08T04:00:00.000Z	Pulsewidth	edbian	It's looped to pass 7 so far, but only the first error detected (on pass 2) showed an address and test type
2009-08-08T04:00:00.000Z	Pulsewidth	edbian	But the "Errors" count is now 3
