2010-01-19T21:37:00.000Z	BlasterMouse	shadowwulf	did you try "ubuntu"? :D
2010-01-19T21:37:00.000Z	shadowwulf	BlasterMouse	as username and password ?
2010-01-19T21:37:00.000Z	BlasterMouse		I'd guess only as user with an empty password. Maybe ask Google?
2010-01-19T21:40:00.000Z	shadowwulf	BlasterMouse	is that for username and password ?
