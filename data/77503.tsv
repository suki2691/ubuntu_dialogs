2008-10-09T15:30:00.000Z	gnufied		I have a weird problem. I login to remote machines using ssh keys, but sometimes, inspite of keys being set, ssh asks for password. often on logging out and logging back in fixes this.
2008-10-09T15:30:00.000Z	gnufied		any idea?
2008-10-09T15:31:00.000Z	l0calh0s2	gnufied	try make new ssf keys, and remove all not using
2008-10-09T15:32:00.000Z	gnufied	l0calh0s2	i can't remove those keys, they are for logging into my company's amazon EC2 instances
