2008-11-01T01:17:00.000Z	thinksInCode		Apologize for repeating myself... but does anyone know why the fonts in the downloaded thunderbird are bigger than the fonts in the ubuntu packaged thunderbird?
2008-11-01T01:18:00.000Z	snova	thinksInCode	probably because ubuntu packagers change the defaults to blend in with the rest of gnome.
2008-11-01T01:19:00.000Z	thinksInCode	snova	do you know where those things get set? lightning 0.9 won't work with the packaged version of thunderbird, but it does in the downloaded version
2008-11-01T01:19:00.000Z	snova	thinksInCode	no.
