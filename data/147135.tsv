2007-05-29T05:15:00.000Z	ferret_0567		I have another Linux distro on the first partition of the first drive (sda1), and I am making room for Ubuntu, and the only choice I have is for the Ubuntu partition to be on sda2. Can Ubuntu boot from sda2 when the first partition has the "boot" flag?

2007-07-15T08:04:00.000Z	bruenig	ferret_0567	ok so then my tip is to install the 32 bit programs and then launch them
