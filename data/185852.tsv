2007-01-23T10:13:00.000Z	Tonren		I'm trying to download a torrent and it's just sitting there, stalled.  isohunt.com reports it as having 355 seeders, 610 leechers.  My ports are forwarded.  Encryption is on, but unencrypted connections are allowed.  Absolutely nothing is happening - no peers, no downloads, no uploads.  Nothing.  Can anyone give me a hint?!
