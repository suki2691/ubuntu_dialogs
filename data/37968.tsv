2010-02-25T00:57:00.000Z	ellmoe2000		i have a question, what is the difference between ubuntu, debian & fedora?
2010-02-25T00:59:00.000Z	fatum77	ellmoe2000	Ubuntu is based off of Debian so not much difference there. Fedora uses a different package system than debian or ubuntu and some files are located in different areas but they are all linux.
2010-02-25T01:00:00.000Z	fatum77	ellmoe2000	I use Ubuntu on my machines but have played with debian and fedora in the past. I like Ubuntu because it feels more polished and I don't use Fedora mainly because I am use to apt-get
