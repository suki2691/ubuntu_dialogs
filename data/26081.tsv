2010-09-29T04:18:00.000Z	RockerBoy402		on my broadcom card i keep having to do rmmod b43 and modprobe b43 in order to get my wireless to start. When the computer boots up it works fine, but if I ever have the screen saver come on, or the computer goes idle, i have to do that to re-enable my wireless card.  this gets annoying because i can't let stuff download on my pc unattended!
2010-09-29T04:18:00.000Z	RockerBoy402		any ideas?
2010-09-29T04:19:00.000Z	blakkheim	RockerBoy402	turn the screensaver off?
2010-09-29T04:22:00.000Z	RockerBoy402	blakkheim	had it off.  problem is is when the computer goes idle.  and i don't mean hibernate or sleep (because the damn computer never does that, sadly), but just idle
