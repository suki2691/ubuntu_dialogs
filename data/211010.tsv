2006-04-09T13:45:00.000Z	MenZa		Hmm... my Dapper install can't connect to the internet for some reason. All my network cables are in place; running broadband - any ideas why it isn't? Sorry for repeating, but it's bugging me that I have to run Windows for simple tasks.
2006-04-09T13:47:00.000Z	HedgeMage	MenZa	I keep thinking about moving to Dapper... having fun with it so far?
2006-04-09T13:47:00.000Z	MenZa	HedgeMage	I only installed it yesterday, and I'm not exactly a linux pro.
2006-04-09T13:48:00.000Z	HedgeMage	MenZa	Good to hear.  I'm debating whether to wait for it to be officially finally released or not
