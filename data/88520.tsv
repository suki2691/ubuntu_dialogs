2008-12-24T01:00:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Sanctusorium	Yea, there's a button that says install Ubuntu, and then you pick the option "Use entire disk"

2008-12-24T01:03:00.000Z	Sanctusorium	ASULutzy	yeah, problem is windows wont even boot ;)  Plus, hes not going to like Linux.  xD  Even ubuntu is kinda technical for him
