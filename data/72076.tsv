2008-12-15T19:52:00.000Z	L0neWolf	jim_p	I opened in a text editor, works just as well if it isn't a huge e-mail and you just want information from text body
2008-12-15T19:52:00.000Z	jim_p	L0neWolf	it contains a pps!
2008-12-15T19:53:00.000Z	L0neWolf	jim_p	ah, then that won't work.  I'm sure someone else will be able to help though!
