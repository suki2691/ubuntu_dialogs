2008-04-22T05:50:00.000Z	Lectrick		my USB external (60 gig fat32) keeps telling me it's read-only, off and on. How can I fix?
2008-04-22T05:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lectrick	SOunds like a windows format that was not correctly shutdown
2008-04-22T05:52:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lectrick	Is it ntfs / fat 32 format?
