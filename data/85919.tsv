2009-05-07T23:14:00.000Z	hateball	blueeyez	Quite a few I'd imagine, me included
2009-05-07T23:14:00.000Z	hateball	blueeyez	I'd rather not. Keeping it in channel lets other learn from whatever questions you might have :)
2009-05-07T23:18:00.000Z	hateball	blueeyez	That does sound odd, I've not had that problem myself. Have you tried connecting to the network after you've added them, before closing the client, and verified it's working?
