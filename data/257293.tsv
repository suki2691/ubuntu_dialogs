2005-02-22T14:06:00.000Z	aquarius	Welly	do you want to delete it or hide it?
2005-02-22T14:07:00.000Z	aquarius	Welly	right click and say Properties to hide it.
2005-02-22T14:08:00.000Z	aquarius	Welly	yep. Right-click on the top panel and Add To Panel... all the stuff that you want on there. Then right-click the bottom one and Delete Panel.
