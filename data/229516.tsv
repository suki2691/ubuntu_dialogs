2006-01-16T08:44:00.000Z	Pavix		I might have broken apt-get. I get this message
2006-01-16T08:44:00.000Z	Pavix		Package mplayer-386 is not available, but is referred to by another package.

2006-04-11T12:09:00.000Z	bimberi	Pavix	System -> Administration -> Login Screen Setup,  I think it's the Security tab and there is a setting to allow root login (if you must :) )
