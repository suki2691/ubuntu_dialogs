2009-01-03T01:13:00.000Z	southafrikanse		My friend has a problem. He's unable to copy a large file from a pen drive to ubuntu. It says "No space left in hard drive", however he does has space. Any thoughts about that?
2009-01-03T01:14:00.000Z	southafrikanse		vieuxmike, will that help? I don't think that would be the issue :|
