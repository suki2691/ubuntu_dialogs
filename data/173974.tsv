2007-06-28T12:21:00.000Z	Dev05		I have just recompiled Nautilus to try something out. Now, I'd like to go back to the original Nautilus because the stock one works in Spatial mode. I have uninstalled Nautilus, rebooted my PC, reinstalled it and restarted again. However, Nautilus still works in Spatial mode and there's no sidebar. Plus, none of the plugins work. How could I fix this? Thanks!
