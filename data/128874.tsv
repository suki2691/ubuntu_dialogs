2008-08-27T10:09:00.000Z	leo_rockw	eTiger13	i was going to suggest something else, but just saying "gimp sucks" made me lost my interest in helping you
2008-08-27T10:11:00.000Z	eTiger13	leo_rockw	sorry if you are a dev on gimp. i have just had negative experiences using it. i have given it plenty of chances and it just doesnt do it for me. Paint.Net is the best alternative to Photoshop i have found, but just doesnt run easily on *nix
2008-08-27T10:12:00.000Z	leo_rockw	eTiger13	then just say "it doesn't work for me" please do not say "it sucks". try krita
