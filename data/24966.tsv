2010-10-03T11:55:00.000Z	gaelfx	romond	as I recall, the best way is to download the latest from adobe's website and throw it in the plugins folder for firefox
2010-10-03T11:56:00.000Z	romond	gaelfx	will that not destabilise a system which only uses approved packages?
2010-10-03T11:57:00.000Z	romond	gaelfx	how about flashplugin-nonfree?
