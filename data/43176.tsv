2009-11-11T05:16:00.000Z	sanubuntu		hey guys, i've used the same 9.10 disk on two different laptops .. the first went off without a hitch .. but on this one (an old toshiba satellite) i don't get a desktop image, even tho i've selected one of the ubuntu studio ones.  what could be the case?  when i go to shut down, the image does appear briefly, but is not rendered in session.
2009-11-11T05:16:00.000Z	sanubuntu		i just save a photo to the desktop to see if it shows up, it doesn't show up on 'the desktop' area, but it IS in the desktop file  ...
