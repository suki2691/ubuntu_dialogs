2007-10-22T09:57:00.000Z	freakabcd	dstadulis	i'm going to do a fresh install. my box has been updated for many times since breezy
2007-10-22T09:58:00.000Z	dstadulis	freakabcd	That's what I was thinking before right now I have some hickups whenever I boot ubuntu
2007-10-22T10:07:00.000Z	freakabcd	dstadulis	i have done breezy->edgy->feisty and soon the next step. which *will* be a fresh install. i'm sick of fixing the stuff that is broken after upgrade
