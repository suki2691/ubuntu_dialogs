2009-04-28T19:10:00.000Z	diego_		Hi! I'm writing a bash script and I need to copy some text from one file to another, but there's a catch, the part I need to copy are all the lines in between two words, lets say "$start" and "$end". I thought of using sed for this but I wasn't able to find the wright way. I already serched the intertubes. Any suggestions? Thank you in advance
2009-04-28T19:11:00.000Z	alleykat	diego_	uhmm regular expressions?
2009-04-28T19:12:00.000Z	alleykat		or maybe some kinda macro in some Vi(m) (just idle suggestions, not sure how I'd do it)
2009-04-28T19:12:00.000Z	diego_	alleykat	Yes, I think so, but I'm not sure what regular expressions are. I'm just begining with this
