Nowdays we have 10 to 100 Mbit/s connections but when we need to download packages from a mirror we just have about 100 to 300kb/s due to upload restrictions in the servers. So, is it possible to use multiple mirrors at the same to download the packages needed to a system upgrade ? It could save a lot of hours, and this really makes difference, I think, without "hacking" server's policies.
