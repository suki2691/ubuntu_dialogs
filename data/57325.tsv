2012-03-18T18:24:00.000Z	ackbahr		I've got this horrible feeling like my computer is ignoring my settings : startup-manager can't set Windows as default OS in Grub2 (for my wife);another hint is that  I installed gnome3 and it won't remember I want that rather than Unity. Could someone help?

2012-03-18T18:25:00.000Z	ackbahr	Mikey^	I'll try that.
