2009-06-27T18:39:00.000Z	Clopin		Would it be possible to hack the way Ubuntu "reads" the Sixaxis (PS3) controller, so it can be used in games? So like when press cross (X) it reads it as SPACE
2009-06-27T18:40:00.000Z	Boohbah	Clopin	most games have keybinding configuration menus
2009-06-27T18:41:00.000Z	Clopin	Boohbah	Yes, but if you take WoW for an example, it doesn't work, it's like it cant read the input.
