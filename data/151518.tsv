2012-04-30T22:33:00.000Z	thechef		I messed up my shortcuts. I want to delete some, but I can't figure out how.
2012-04-30T22:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	thechef	 i think its ctrl-rightclick or alt-rightclick..
2012-04-30T22:35:00.000Z	thechef	Dr_willis	doesn't help - with Alt it does nothing, with Ctrl it does the same as normal right click which is "Starten" und "Eigenschaften"
