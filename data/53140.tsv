2009-07-15T17:28:00.000Z	tumii66		I'm installing ubuntu, should I install 32-bit or 64 ( i have used it for some time)?
2009-07-15T17:30:00.000Z	MaT-dg	tumii66	there are no downsides on 64bit you now
2009-07-15T17:30:00.000Z	tumii66	MaT-dg	does 64-bit run 32-bit software (ex. after compiling)?
2009-07-15T17:31:00.000Z	MaT-dg	tumii66	yes, I've yet have to see the first program that doesn't run here
