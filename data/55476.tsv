2010-03-19T05:28:00.000Z	edbian	HowardtheDuck	Depends on the program.  Look at "man <programName>"
2010-03-19T05:29:00.000Z	edbian	HowardtheDuck	Read the man page!  "man apt-get"  -y means "assume yes to any questions asked"
2010-03-19T05:30:00.000Z	edbian	HowardtheDuck	yes, "man"  as in "man apt-get" shows a manual for apt-get
