2009-07-17T02:31:00.000Z	Bodsda	Mba7eth	youd have to check out the wine appdb or cedega
2009-07-17T02:32:00.000Z	Mba7eth	Bodsda	I don't want to play it in ubuntu .... just ran it as a server to access it from outside
2009-07-17T02:33:00.000Z	Bodsda	Mba7eth	yes, but it is a game service, and ubuntu does not support it.
