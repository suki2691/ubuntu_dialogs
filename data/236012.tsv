2005-05-24T12:41:00.000Z	rgould		I have a dual-head video card with two LCD monitors hooked up. How do I tell x/gnome/whatever to extend my desktop across them, rather than clone? Any tutorials on this somewhere?
2005-05-24T12:41:00.000Z	zenrox	rgould	 is it nvidia
2005-05-24T12:41:00.000Z	rgould	zenrox	I do believe so
2005-05-24T12:41:00.000Z	zenrox	rgould	 if so ask for help in #nvidia and read the topic
