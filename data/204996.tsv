2007-07-31T06:32:00.000Z	bolingo	ShackJack	what I'm saying is very simple in the same computer, I can have dual boot with WinXP Pro and Ubuntu 7.04 with no problems in none of the OS's, but when I try dual booting Vista with Ubuntu 7.04, I got problems in Ubuntu such as no sound, no wireless, etc..what's not to understand? :s
2007-07-31T06:33:00.000Z	macd	bolingo	so could you please pastebin the output of 'lspci' 'iwconfig' 'ifconfig' to pastebin.
