2005-10-21T10:41:00.000Z	Maikeru	rybarnes	more than enough
2005-10-21T10:44:00.000Z	rybarnes	Maikeru	I know, I have a restore disk for XP that dosn't allow dual boot, so I have to install that first, then install Ubuntu, so I have to format the HD first.
2005-10-21T10:44:00.000Z	rybarnes	Maikeru	I have used Ubuntu for about 3 days, not to much on it.
