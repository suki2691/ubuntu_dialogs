2007-03-06T06:33:00.000Z	flyinghippo		I have been trying to remove a directory with command line, and have used "sudo rm -d folder/", and it has failed to work, I am still told that it is a directory.
2007-03-06T06:33:00.000Z	Xenguy	flyinghippo	rm -rf will delete the directory and all its contents (careful)
