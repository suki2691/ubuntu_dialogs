2010-10-10T20:19:00.000Z	cupis	GlenP	you can upgrade over the internet
2010-10-10T20:20:00.000Z	cupis	GlenP	if you want to upgrade, run the Update Manager and change the setting to "normal" instead of "long term support"
2010-10-10T20:20:00.000Z	cupis	GlenP	then run Alt-F2 "update-manager -c" to actually upgrade
