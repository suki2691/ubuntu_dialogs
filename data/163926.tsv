2006-10-17T07:00:00.000Z	AWOSDev	Eddieduce	yes and it works fine.
2006-10-17T07:04:00.000Z	Eddieduce	AWOSDev	 I thought it only required running the Windows executable, but it gave me the message "Couldn't display "/home/tech/Desktop/Firefox Setup 1.5.0.7.exe""
2006-10-17T07:04:00.000Z	AWOSDev	Eddieduce	just cd to Desktop and type                 wine Firefox\ Setup\ 1.5.0.7.exe
