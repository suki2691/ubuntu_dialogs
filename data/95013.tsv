2008-12-07T09:30:00.000Z	Decepticon_	jtaji	which ssh-keygen command am i supposed to use, everyone keeps saying different things, some say ssh-keygen -d, some say ssh-keygen -t rsa, some say ssh-keygen -t dsa... which one is the one i need and why
2008-12-07T09:34:00.000Z	Decepticon_	jtaji	it doesnt matter, ive tried ssh-kegen -t rsa and dsa and ssh-keygen -d and plain ssh-keygen, if i do the same commands on both machines, still only B can log onto A without being assked for a password, whereas A is asked for a password when trying to get onto B, whats the use of keys if i have to type a password
