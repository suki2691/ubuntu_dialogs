2011-05-22T04:13:00.000Z	omac		my mouse scroll wheel died and I'm trying learn blender and it sucks without a scroll wheel.  The blender ui can't function without a scroll wheel.  if the blender ui had scroll bars everywhere it wouldn't be an issue, but that is not the case with the version that I want to use.
2011-05-22T04:13:00.000Z	omac		as a result, I would like to ask the ubuntu community something.
2011-05-22T04:15:00.000Z	omac		How can I map the multimedia keyboard's scroll wheel to not only map to volume up and down, but also emulate mouse scroll up/down if I press the shift key at the same time?
