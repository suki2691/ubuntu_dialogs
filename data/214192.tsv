2005-10-28T12:30:00.000Z	Bergcube		Please allow me to repeat myself:  I've installed 5.10 on a desktop, and I notice it uses the i386 kernel.  In Synaptic I see the package "linux-386" is installed.  If I want to change to the 686 kernel, am I right in guessing I should simply install the "linux-686" package and remove the "linux-386" one?  Can I do both in one go or should I first add 686 then reboot and remove 386?  (And is there any good reason NOT to do this???)
