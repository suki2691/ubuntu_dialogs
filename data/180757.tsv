2006-10-06T10:03:00.000Z	Knifa		Everytime I try to uninstall GAIM it tries to uninstall ubuntu-desktop (which in turn decides to try to uninstall everything)
2006-10-06T10:03:00.000Z	Knifa		is there anyway around that?
2006-10-06T10:04:00.000Z	xe||	Knifa	afaik, ubuntu-desktop is just a metapackage, so i heard that it's safe to uninstall?
2006-10-06T10:05:00.000Z	Knifa	xe||	ah yeah, anytime i install something using the apt-get command it comes up "use autoremove to uninstall <every base package>" though
