2010-07-19T20:40:00.000Z	masterslakk		hey, i'm trying to compile/configure apache httpd. I've downloaded the unix source from http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi#apache22 Why isn't it compiling right? I still don't have make
2010-07-19T20:41:00.000Z	_2	masterslakk	why compile ?   ubuntu is not the best distro for building from source...    at any rate.   sudo apt-get install build-essential
2010-07-19T20:42:00.000Z	masterslakk	_2	i'm following a guide. I just want to do it their way because I want to learn how to compile/ make/ make install source files etc. for future
2010-07-19T20:42:00.000Z	_2	masterslakk	see the end of my post   ^
