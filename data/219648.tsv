2009-05-03T10:59:00.000Z	x64isfaster222		i want to get the x64 copy of ubuntu, but when I select x64 it shoots me a mirror for x64AMD, but i have x64Intel
2009-05-03T10:59:00.000Z	x64isfaster222		does it matter?
2009-05-03T11:00:00.000Z	x64isfaster222		they ought to remove "amd64" and change it to just "x64"
