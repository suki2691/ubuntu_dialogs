2012-01-28T02:05:00.000Z	sneakster		I got a dumb question, this unity interface is pretty awful
2012-01-28T02:05:00.000Z	sneakster		Is  unity an unavoidable part of ubuntu
2012-01-28T02:06:00.000Z	sneakster		I was lookin at alternatives such as gnome 3 and kde and such, is that the equivalent of a seperate distribution from ubuntu
