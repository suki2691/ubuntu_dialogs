2008-11-11T23:58:00.000Z	ville__		Hello guys! I have to laptop one running ubuntu 8.10 and the other one running windows xp... The machine that's running ubuntu has 11mbs wlan card and the xp machine head 54mbs card. I have an 8mb/s internet connection and I have noticed that the Ubuntu computer only gets 2817.61kbit/s and The xp machine gets 5049 kbit/s. does this have to do with the speed difference between the do WLAN cards?
