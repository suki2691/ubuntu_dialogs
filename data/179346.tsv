2007-05-31T15:07:00.000Z	zpidaz		Thanks for all the advice, everyone. I'm going to reboot and try some of it :o) I am doing this from a new install, but would really like to go back to my old one because I spent a lot of time tweaking it...
2007-05-31T15:08:00.000Z	zpidaz		BTW, how come root can't login from the login screen? Even if you give root a password?
2007-05-31T15:08:00.000Z	jrib	zpidaz	because it's a bad idea
2007-05-31T15:09:00.000Z	jrib	zpidaz	you never need to log in as root in the gui to do anything, I can't think of a single good reason
