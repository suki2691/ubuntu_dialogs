2009-01-08T22:43:00.000Z	Sanketsu		I've got a fresh install of Intrepid on a laptop and when I just let all the updates go, my internet connectivity breaks completely, no wireless, no wired.  I went through the updates list last night and deselected 12 packages that seemed relevant to the issue, let the rest upgrade and restarted.  Internet worked fine.  What from this list  http://paste.ubuntu.com/102226/  might cause that issue?
2009-01-08T22:43:00.000Z	OriWB	Sanketsu	is that for me?
2009-01-08T22:44:00.000Z	Sanketsu	OriWB	Nope, my own seperate issue.
