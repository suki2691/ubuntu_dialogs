2011-07-31T23:31:00.000Z	JoseP		I need help with an Ubuntu server
2011-07-31T23:32:00.000Z	JoseP		I have the GUI on it because I need it running a VM... I upgraded the server to Ubuntu 11.04 and had some issues. Those issues were fixed last night. The only problem I'm still facing is, the server is extremely slow
2011-07-31T23:32:00.000Z	JoseP		anyone have any idea?
2011-07-31T23:32:00.000Z	tyler_d	JoseP	sorry, problem?
