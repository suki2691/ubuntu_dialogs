2008-10-13T00:45:00.000Z	daveXX	ompaul	I actually know the tool I want to use......I just dont want to have to set the server up to DHCP say 192.168.x.x , then push it to my firewall on say 10.x.x.x - I'd like to retain access to my m0n0wall box from any workstation rather than having to VNC the server to get to the firewall
