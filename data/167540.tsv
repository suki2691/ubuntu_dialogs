2010-04-11T13:23:00.000Z	banshee_		Howcome I cannot browse the wine C file, I click it it doesnt come up and I try to search it and i cant find it
2010-04-11T13:25:00.000Z	inglor	banshee_	wine has its own support IRC and I'm sure there's more help there,
2010-04-11T13:26:00.000Z	inglor	banshee_	anyway go nautilus (the window browser) and type in the address bar /home/YOURNAME/.wine/dosdevices/c: replace YOURNAME with your user name
