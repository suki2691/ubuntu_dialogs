2005-10-08T07:49:00.000Z	SanderD		Hi! Would it be a bad idea to try WineCVS? Can I easily undo it to install a .deb version later?
2005-10-08T07:50:00.000Z	apokryphos	SanderD	I presume it's a simple compile from source, in which case the answer is: yes, most probably.
2005-10-08T07:50:00.000Z	apokryphos	SanderD	after you make install just make sure you keep the source, and then you can do a make uninstall when you wanna remove it
2005-10-08T07:51:00.000Z	SanderD	apokryphos	Okay, then I'll try that.
