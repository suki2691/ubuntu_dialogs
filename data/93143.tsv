2012-11-03T11:46:00.000Z	rigo		is there something between the "netinst" and the "full with ubuntu desktop" iso? so i would need a minimalist install but dont want to download all the packages every time i install ubuntu.

2012-11-03T11:47:00.000Z	Phase	rigo	Honestly, I would download the desktop release once and hang onto it incase you need to reinstall
