2008-07-10T04:31:00.000Z	Simulous		to share bandwith evenly :o) my router doesnt go as far as throttling bandwidth
2008-07-10T04:32:00.000Z	Simulous		its a shared connection on a GB switch, attached to that a router > cable modem. 3 ppl share the connection and one of those doesnt seem to be able to stop hammering my connection so i want to divide it evenly
