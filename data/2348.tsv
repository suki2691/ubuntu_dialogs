2012-06-20T22:41:00.000Z	laict		I have made a smb share using the interface in ubuntu, but I cannot connect to it through OS X, It asks for a password and username, but when I put what I think is the correct details in, it says connection failed.
2012-06-20T22:44:00.000Z	laict	ki4ro	Any ideas why it's not working?
2012-06-20T22:45:00.000Z	ki4ro	laict	Not me, but there may be others here that can help
