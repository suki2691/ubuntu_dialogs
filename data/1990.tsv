2012-08-23T23:08:00.000Z	Frostbyte		I've got blurry screen / noise / grain after changing to a new monitor, tried to re-install drivers (doesn't fix the issue), tried to install post-release update drivers (jockey ends up with errors), tried to dpkg-reconfigure fglrx.. nothing works.. using Ubuntu 12.04LTS x64 with an ATI card.. Any clue how can I solve this?
2012-08-23T23:09:00.000Z	Frostbyte		anyone?
