2008-12-06T03:43:00.000Z	tripzero		I have an interesting problem.... I need to take a package list (via gpkg -l) from a very slimmed down version of feisty, diff it against intrepids default packages, and remove the packages that aren't in the feisty version...
2008-12-06T03:43:00.000Z	tripzero		can anyone help me with that ?
2008-12-06T03:43:00.000Z	CaShMoNey	tripzero	I think ubuntu will only update what it has on it's system already
2008-12-06T03:58:00.000Z	tripzero	CaShMoNey	i've tried doing an update from feisty to gutsy to hardy to interpid, but I ended up with no sound :(.  not to mention, I was to remix intrepid in a more slimmed and niche specific way like I was able to do with feisty...
