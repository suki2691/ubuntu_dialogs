2008-03-29T22:52:00.000Z	Rayen		Hello, Is it possible to install Ubuntu + my TV card driver, Hauppauge WinTV-PVR 350 + TV software (MythTV, etc.) automatically without having to install my TV card driver manually?

2008-03-29T22:55:00.000Z	Rayen	Svenstaro	I had some problems with getting my TV-card to work on Ubuntu 7.10. I heard MythBuntu could do this out-of-the-box, but I guess I will lose all the standard Ubuntu features and settings (like the software packages, look & feel, sounds, themes, etc) if I use this specific version, am I right?
