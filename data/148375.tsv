2007-01-22T15:08:00.000Z	Skrit		hey there... I would need some advice about setting the virtual terminal's resolution, I tried editing grub kernel line to add vga = 791 but that dosen't help. I get: unsupported parameter at boot time and when prompted scan for the available configs, the highest thing I can get is 800 x 600. Any toughts on how I could get something better?

2007-01-22T15:10:00.000Z	Skrit	IntuitiveNipple	that's a start, I'll search a little about it thanks.
