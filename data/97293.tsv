2008-04-05T10:19:00.000Z	Xerxes		Is ubuntu java compatible?  I'm a stock trader and would love to use a more secure system but I'm not sure if the software is compatible.
2008-04-05T10:19:00.000Z	smehmood	Xerxes	yes, it can run Java.
2008-04-05T10:23:00.000Z	smehmood	Xerxes	honestly, I would just go ahead and try to install it. In theory Java is totally cross platform. in practice it isn't, but its still worth a shot.
2008-04-05T10:24:00.000Z	Xerxes	smehmood	I'll give it a shot.  Probably not too immediately.  Next week maybe.
