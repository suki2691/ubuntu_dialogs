2012-04-04T12:24:00.000Z	Rabenklaue		Hi, I'm curious about the new things in Qt5.0 especially QtQuick2.0 and therefore added ppa:forumnokia/fn-ppa (via apt-add-repository) to my kubuntu packaging system. But I'm unable to find any qt5-* packages.
2012-04-04T12:24:00.000Z	Rabenklaue		I ran "apt-get update" but "apt-cache search qt5" does not give any results (except libmgl-qt5 - which is not relevant for me).
2012-04-04T12:24:00.000Z	Rabenklaue		Btw, I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 / Precise
