2009-07-23T02:44:00.000Z	Titan8990_	Zlow	typically the only issues are with wireless cards and off things such as printers and bluetooth
2009-07-23T02:44:00.000Z	Titan8990_	Zlow	google... and linux compatible = ubuntu compatibile
2009-07-23T02:44:00.000Z	Titan8990_	Zlow	if it works in one distro, it will work in another
