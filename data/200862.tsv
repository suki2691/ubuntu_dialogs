2006-01-20T07:16:00.000Z	SgtGemini		Hello everyone.
2006-01-20T07:17:00.000Z	SgtGemini		I seem to be having trouble getting Ubuntu to boot. When I restart my PC and select "Boot from CD" it just boots windows anyhow. Any ideas? :(
2006-01-20T07:17:00.000Z	SgtGemini		I pushed F10 for boot options and selected "CD"
2006-01-20T07:18:00.000Z	nbound	SgtGemini	try changing the boot order in ur bios some bioses dont care what u press in that menu
