2009-09-19T11:11:00.000Z	mezquitale	maxagaz	why would you want to use ftp???  scp is more secure than ftp, why would you want to go back to ftp?
2009-09-19T11:12:00.000Z	maxagaz	mezquitale	i need to use a ftp server which is not mine
2009-09-19T11:12:00.000Z	mezquitale	maxagaz	i see, sorry but I only use scp LoL
