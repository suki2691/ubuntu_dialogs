2007-04-20T12:09:00.000Z	Clement_Guislain		I just downloaded ubuntu desktop i386 7.04 ISO and burnt it, I want to try and use it as a liveCD, but I have a acer aspire 3020, and I heard about a bug on the ATI X-series mobility GPUs (I have X700 mobility), and it is not working at all (blank screen, PC idle). Can anyone help me, or give me a good link? cheers
