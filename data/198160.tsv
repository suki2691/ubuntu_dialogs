2006-02-23T17:28:00.000Z	colm	coolbeing	- just update your apt sources.list, change breezy to dapper then apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-02-23T17:28:00.000Z	coolbeing	colm	I cant ! I cannot isntall Ubuntu due to the harware issue and I was told to get Dapper instead.. but apperently there is no Dapper on its own?
2006-02-23T17:29:00.000Z	colm	coolbeing	dapper isn't released yet as an iso
