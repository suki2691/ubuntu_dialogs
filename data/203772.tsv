2006-09-27T10:14:00.000Z	Phoenix1701	mister_roboto	Oh, I'm aware of what it's *designed* to do...  but it assumes you're running Ubuntu with Gnome, and if you're not, it'll install everything it needs to get all its Gnomy bits working, which turns out to be a large portion of Gnome.
2006-09-27T10:15:00.000Z	mister_roboto	Phoenix1701	ahh, ok. i didn't feel like going through all the manual steps and used it on this kubuntu machine to get all the video codecs.
2006-09-27T10:15:00.000Z	Phoenix1701	mister_roboto	Indeed.  Me neither...  I don't really have the need for it, honestly.
