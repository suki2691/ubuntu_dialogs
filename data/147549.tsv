2007-01-27T16:05:00.000Z	yanickd		Hi, i downloaded the Dapper Drake Alternate iso-File and mountet it (in Breezy), and now i wanted to upgrade my System. apt-get dist-upgrade says that i should enter the Cd-Rom to /cdrom/, but i dont -have any cd-rom device. Do someone know how to Upgrade the System only with the iso-file????
