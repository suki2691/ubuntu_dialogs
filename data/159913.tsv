2006-11-15T12:13:00.000Z	Limulf		I want Ubuntu (6.10) to start without opening any windows from its previous use, so I have changed my session configuration, unchecking the save session changes automatically option. My problem is that i don't know how to prevent from appearing two windows: the session manager and a Nautilus window showing my home directory. I have tried to remove the gnome-session-properties from the current session tab in the session manager
2006-11-15T12:13:00.000Z	Limulf		window,  but after closing and opening again the session manager, the gnome-session-properties program is again there. This is hardly an annoyance, but I would like to know the solution anyway. Thanks for your time and work.
2006-11-15T12:15:00.000Z	dooglus	Limulf	isn't there an option to ask whether to save the session when you log out?
2006-11-15T12:16:00.000Z	Limulf	dooglus	I don't see that option when I logout. Anyway i'm going to try nolimitsoya's advice. Thx
