2006-06-22T10:41:00.000Z	ScurveyFrog		is it normal to have IO Wait always reaching ~100% when I open any program?
2006-06-22T10:43:00.000Z	ScurveyFrog		my system is opening programs very slowly, and the gnome system monitor shows IO Wait using about 90% while the process only gets about 10% of the CPU
2006-06-22T10:43:00.000Z	ScurveyFrog		please help!
2006-06-22T10:43:00.000Z	_Spire_	ScurveyFrog	ask the question, and someone probably will
