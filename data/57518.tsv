2009-05-12T14:47:00.000Z	AlleyKat		I think I can send messages to win machines in my LAN via "smbclient -M <netbiosname>", but is the opposite also possible somehow?
2009-05-12T14:49:00.000Z	I_Hate_Freedom	AlleyKat	Hmm... I can't get it to work on my network.
2009-05-12T14:52:00.000Z	AlleyKat	I_Hate_Freedom	ok.. am trying to establish some way to communicate with my neighbor w/o having to run in there for every little message.. I'll test it out better later, see if I can come up with something at least one-way and get it working
2009-05-12T14:53:00.000Z	I_Hate_Freedom	AlleyKat	Cool! Let me know when you figure it out.
