2011-12-17T10:05:00.000Z	Android1435		I am having issue with certain keys on my keyboard under certain situations. Under Putty, the control key does not work. In other programs, the control key does not function properly. under firefox, control key does function correctly, and on the desktop.
2011-12-17T10:06:00.000Z	Android1435		Is anybody else having issue with control key working properly under PUTTY and certain other programs?
