The webcam works with Cheese, Skype. But the videorecording in Cheese is speedy. So I wanted to try camorama, but it says: Could not connect to /dev/video0. What should I do?

2008-08-16T06:46:00.000Z	odinsbane	minus198	do you have another program using it now?
2008-08-16T06:47:00.000Z	odinsbane	minus198	I dont' know then...
