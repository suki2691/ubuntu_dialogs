2006-10-25T15:29:00.000Z	Lam_	bdragonmsl	they're free. try both and see which you like
2006-10-25T15:29:00.000Z	bdragonmsl		I'm just having a hard time deciding.  I have used ubuntu, but can't get compiz to run, on suse I can, but ubuntu has a ton more apps available
2006-10-25T15:30:00.000Z	bdragonmsl	Lam_	I've done that and can't really decide.  So I'm looking for other reasons to decide
