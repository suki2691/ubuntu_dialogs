2010-06-15T09:12:00.000Z	hypatia		i'm trying to upgrade an 8.04 desktop to 10.04, and do-release-upgrade is saying no new release found.  i've gone into software sources and changed "never" to "LTS" - is there anything else i'm missing?
2010-06-15T09:13:00.000Z	Zelozelos	hypatia	dont upgrade, do a new install, ive heard lots of bad stuff bout upgrading
