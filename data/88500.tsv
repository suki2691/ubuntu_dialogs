2008-06-10T02:11:00.000Z	Rampage	ASULutzy	the ncurses interface for rtorrent makes it rather easy to use don't you think?
2008-06-10T02:12:00.000Z	ASULutzy	Rampage	Oh, I've never used a front end for rTorrent. I only use it so like I said, while I'm at work like I am now, I can ssh to my desktop at home and tell it to start downloading stuff so it'll be there waiting for me when I get back
2008-06-10T02:12:00.000Z	Rampage	ASULutzy	thats how i use it too, it has no graphical frontend
