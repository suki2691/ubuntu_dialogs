2010-01-06T23:23:00.000Z	ikonia	teddymills	it depends on the package dependencies
2010-01-06T23:23:00.000Z	ikonia	teddymills	what are you trying to build ?
2010-01-06T23:25:00.000Z	ikonia	teddymills	so each one will have different dependencies, however if you look in ubuntu's package manager you'll find most of them are already build to for you to use
