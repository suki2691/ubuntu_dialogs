2005-03-29T17:52:00.000Z	UglyP		Hello ladies and gents. I have a quick question here, regarding apt-get and the synaptic package manager. I have glib 2.4.7 installed, and currently there is no update available in the repository. When ever i run the config it finishes, but it dosen't update my glib, as its still recognised as 2.4.7. Does anyone know anything about this and how I can get around? Any help would be appreciated! :D
