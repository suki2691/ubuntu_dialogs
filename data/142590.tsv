2008-10-02T19:05:00.000Z	mm2000		Hi there. I have installed ffmpeg from medibuntu on my laptop and on a server. I can now create flash-moves properly with sounds and video on my laptop but I get no sound on the server. Ideas what the problem can be? laptop is ubuntu 8.04 desktop and server is ubuntu 8.04 server.
2008-10-02T19:07:00.000Z	mm2000		anyone?
2008-10-02T19:09:00.000Z	Whitor	mm2000	its probably related to a component of the desktop vs of 8.04 ... a codec or something of the like that would not normally be included in a 'server' distro
