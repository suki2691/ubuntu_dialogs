2010-07-26T09:27:00.000Z	ubuntu456		Hi I'm trying to share my file and folders in ubuntu 10.04 but it says "this feature cannot be enabled because the required packages are not installed on your system"
2010-07-26T09:27:00.000Z	ubuntu456		what package should I install ?
2010-07-26T09:28:00.000Z	ubuntu456		I installed samba via synaptic but still the same message , maybe I should restart first ?
2010-07-26T09:30:00.000Z	bullgard4	ubuntu456	It does not help to restart.
