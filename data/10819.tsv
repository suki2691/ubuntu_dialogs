2011-08-29T05:06:00.000Z	awakecoding		Hi, I have ubuntu 11.04 with a faulty driver that crashes X on boot. how can I boot ubuntu in a fail safe mode that won't attempt starting X?
2011-08-29T05:06:00.000Z	urlin2u	awakecoding	use the recovery at the grub menu and choose failsafe at the next gui
2011-08-29T05:07:00.000Z	urlin2u	awakecoding	it will start x but in low graphics
2011-08-29T05:08:00.000Z	awakecoding	urlin2u	even that seems to crash, I get  a black screen. isn't there a way to simply avoid launching X completely?
