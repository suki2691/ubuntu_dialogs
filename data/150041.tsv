2009-10-20T18:39:00.000Z	Prune		I'd like to install Pico, but its not in my Adaptic Manager and not sure how to download or install
2009-10-20T18:39:00.000Z	Pici	Prune	pico pretty much doesnt exist anymore, use nano instead.
2009-10-20T18:40:00.000Z	Pici	Prune	In fact, pico is a symlink to nano with nano installed.
2009-10-20T18:42:00.000Z	Pici	Prune	nano should be installed by default. sudo apt-get install nano should reinstall it if you've removed it.
