2007-02-17T15:08:00.000Z	royel		hey, what can I do to enable syntax highlighting in a console editor? Which editors are best suited for this?
2007-02-17T15:09:00.000Z	piedoggie	royel	emacs and vi
2007-02-17T15:11:00.000Z	piedoggie	royel	 most editors have tutorials.  I know Emacs and vim do
2007-02-17T15:12:00.000Z	royel	piedoggie	I'm most used to nano/pico, but I'm not afraid of the others. I will admit I'm sure I will need a reference for a while though
