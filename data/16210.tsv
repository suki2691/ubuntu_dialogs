2011-04-05T23:13:00.000Z	BajK		is there a *simple* way of mounting iso images? I am not talking about console mount command
2011-04-05T23:13:00.000Z	BajK		and for kde? :)
2011-04-05T23:14:00.000Z	BajK		yes, ark can but I cannot just mount them like a regular drive using the context menu for example
2011-04-05T23:14:00.000Z	Malina	BajK	yesh, you can but would need to write an automount script and add it to your file manager
