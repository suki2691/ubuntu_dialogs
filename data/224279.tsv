2006-03-10T14:00:00.000Z	akaihola		I'm going to install Breezy from the CD on a computer with no interenet access. I need python-wxgtk2.6 but how do I determine what other dependencies I have to download and take with me?
2006-03-10T14:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	akaihola	look the package up on packages.ubuntu.com and it should tell you the depends
2006-03-10T14:02:00.000Z	akaihola	Madpilot	But no quick way to find out dependencies recursively and exclude those already present on the cd?
2006-03-10T14:03:00.000Z	Madpilot	akaihola	not as far as I know - not thru that website, anyway
