2008-11-02T18:21:00.000Z	gavagai		Oh one last question.  is "double your ram" still correct for swap?  i have 2 gigs, and  4 gig swap seems very wasteful
2008-11-02T18:22:00.000Z	gavagai		yeah i was thinking 1 gig max
2008-11-02T18:22:00.000Z	jrib	gavagai	equal to your ram if you want to suspend to disk
