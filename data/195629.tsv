2007-12-01T11:00:00.000Z	mofo		ok so if there is no way to get my external monitor with gutsy, I'm going to have to downgrade.  I looked for a tutorial - can someone point me to a definitive guide for downgrading from gutsy to feisty?  I'm losing work hours here and just don't have time to sort thruogh this x nonsense
