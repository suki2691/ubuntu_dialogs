2007-05-03T09:32:00.000Z	__ew__		Hey everyone.
2007-05-03T09:33:00.000Z	__ew__		I just got a spanking over a hackish fix I posted to a Feisty bug report:  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python2.5/+bug/107525
2007-05-03T09:35:00.000Z	__ew__		In it, Matthias suggests that I use 'feisty-proposed' - I'd never heard of it before and didn't see it in my searching for a solution to the problem (or didn't recognize that feisty-proposed was a package source)
2007-05-03T09:36:00.000Z	kitche	__ew__	*-propsed is usually bug fixes and other packages
