2008-08-22T19:22:00.000Z	cjohnson		I'm trying to run ubuntu 8.04. I tried the livecd, it doesn't start. I just installed with the wubi installer in windows, and now when I boot it also doesn't start. I get this error: clocksource tsc unstable
2008-08-22T19:22:00.000Z	cjohnson		How can I fix this?
2008-08-22T19:22:00.000Z	Cyberia	cjohnson	weren't you able to change the boot order to boot from CD first?
2008-08-22T19:23:00.000Z	cjohnson	Cyberia	it does boot from the cd, that's how I can see the error...
