2007-12-31T17:11:00.000Z	jokoon		Hello, I have a nokia cellphone who has bluetooth and a bluetooth "dongle", I just installed ubuntu 7.10, it automatically has a bluetooth icon, it reads my phone's name, but when I click connect it says "obex://[00:15:de:28:55:92]" is not a valid location.

2007-12-31T17:12:00.000Z	scguy318	jokoon	sudo apt-get install gnome-vfs-obexftp
