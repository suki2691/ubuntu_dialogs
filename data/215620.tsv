2007-03-09T13:24:00.000Z	danny		very quick question -- my gf is installing ubuntu on her second hard drive, with windows on her first drive
2007-03-09T13:25:00.000Z	danny		will that just work, or will there need to be some hacking to get grub to install on the first drive?
2007-03-09T13:25:00.000Z	soundray	danny	it should just work
