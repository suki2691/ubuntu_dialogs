2009-01-24T14:55:00.000Z	debianisdabest	lorenzosu	write a script that uses the command line tools, and runs at boot
2009-01-24T14:56:00.000Z	lorenzosu	debianisdabest	any hint?
2009-01-24T14:57:00.000Z	debianisdabest	lorenzosu	yes, I think the tool is wireless-tools i haven't used any wireless tools in awhile, but wireless-tools has some command like {command} -sid {sid name} -wpa{password} wlan0
