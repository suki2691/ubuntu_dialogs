2012-02-14T21:33:00.000Z	xtreamer		i've got a question, I installed ubuntu amongside windows, and I wanted to install it on a certain partition, but on the install i didn't selected custom install and it installed without asking anything.Now the problem is I don't know where does ubuntu was installed, i mean on what partition.The partition I wanted ubuntu to be installed was in fact unpartitionned.
