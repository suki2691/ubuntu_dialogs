2008-03-30T07:47:00.000Z	transience		i want to replace macOSX 10.4 with ubuntu. I have an intel iMac. Can this be done?
2008-03-30T07:49:00.000Z	transience		ok, is there a special way to install, or can i just use the graphical install?
2008-03-30T07:50:00.000Z	transience		only ubuntu, i'm fed up with OSX
2008-03-30T07:50:00.000Z	Stroganoff	transience	i'd use the alternate the but live cd should work as well
