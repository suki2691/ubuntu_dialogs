2006-11-03T16:12:00.000Z	kalikiana	fignew	i only tried xubuntu becuase i that's what i use most of the time; so could it be just the kernel?
2006-11-03T16:13:00.000Z	fignew	kalikiana	I would try something like knoppix and see if it works under that
2006-11-03T16:15:00.000Z	kalikiana	fignew	yes, maybe it should do that, good idea :)
