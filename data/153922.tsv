2010-09-15T18:10:00.000Z	sipior	NevroPus	no, i don't believe there is.
2010-09-15T18:11:00.000Z	NevroPus	sipior	Damn. That really sucks. How often do the ubuntu kernel have an update? Every few weeks?
2010-09-15T18:12:00.000Z	sipior	NevroPus	depends. price you pay for using drivers outside the purview of the distribution.
