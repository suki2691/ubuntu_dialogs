2005-07-12T11:12:00.000Z	bimberi	Tsunamii	<ctrl>C (if the program is running in a terminal)
2005-07-12T11:14:00.000Z	bimberi	Tsunamii	Yes, an annoyance,  there is a workaround.  I'll see if I can find it
2005-07-12T11:20:00.000Z	bimberi	Tsunamii	OK, the workaround is "gnome-clipboard-daemon".  It's not in any repositories though.
