2010-06-18T04:42:00.000Z	jpds	profxavier	They can run as any user.
2010-06-18T04:43:00.000Z	profxavier	jpds	if I am user, and I use crontab, that just creates a cron for that user
2010-06-18T04:43:00.000Z	profxavier	jpds	if that user doesn't have access to a command, then the cron will not run correctly ?
