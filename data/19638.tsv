2011-06-20T23:46:00.000Z	Spodey	RusAlex	Have you tried simply plugging in an SD card reader or something and copying the file to your desktop - try it on all 3 ports and see which give syou the fastest speed?
2011-06-20T23:46:00.000Z	RusAlex	Spodey	thanks, but i want to do it without checking read and write speed
2011-06-20T23:47:00.000Z	Spodey	RusAlex	Well, that would be the quickest way of doing it. Unless you are doing this for academic reasons?
