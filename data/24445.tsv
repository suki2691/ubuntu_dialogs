2010-10-12T04:39:00.000Z	alzie	usboot	it is an ubuntu utility for ubuntu, try unet bootin for other os
2010-10-12T04:39:00.000Z	usboot	alzie	what does the ubuntu utility flag, the md5 or the filename to block all non-ubuntu isos?
2010-10-12T04:40:00.000Z	alzie	usboot	I don't know, it appears to be a fork for ubuntu use
