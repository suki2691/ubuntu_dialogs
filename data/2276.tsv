2012-06-25T07:31:00.000Z	ironhoof		I am installing ubuntu on a friends machine, and he has a USB camera mic, I loaded pulse audio volume control, and selected the mic but it gives a timed out error and it hangs for a moment.
2012-06-25T07:32:00.000Z	ironhoof		it works sometimes, but its lost on restart
2012-06-25T07:33:00.000Z	ironhoof		 kernel: [  494.217647] 3:3:3: usb_set_interface failed
2012-06-25T07:34:00.000Z	wifiman	ironhoof	does unplugging and re-plugging the camera do anything?
