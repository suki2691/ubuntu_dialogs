2007-05-12T10:15:00.000Z	bruenig	pyrohotdog	you could write one
2007-05-12T10:15:00.000Z	bruenig	pyrohotdog	just have it move different pngs into the one that the background is looking for and have it run in cron
2007-05-12T10:15:00.000Z	pyrohotdog	bruenig	thought of that, don't think I know quite enough.
