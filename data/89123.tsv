2008-08-05T03:11:00.000Z	glitsj16	adilson	have you tried http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=766683 yet to get pulseaudio started ?
2008-08-05T03:13:00.000Z	adilson	glitsj16	its originally not a pulseaudio problem ts a whole sound problem in all the sound card is picked up, alsa mixer shows channels but sound options are empty, the drop down list are all empty and no modules are there thats what is confusing
2008-08-05T03:13:00.000Z	glitsj16	adilson	sounds like that yes, not really any clue on how to start debugging that
