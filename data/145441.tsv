2007-04-26T06:14:00.000Z	MidNightSunRay	erider	apt-get remove --purge
2007-04-26T06:15:00.000Z	erider	MidNightSunRay	thanks and bianconeri that does not remove it completely
2007-04-26T06:16:00.000Z	MidNightSunRay	erider	to be completely sure, you should also remove the hidden directory in your home associated to the program, if there's one..
