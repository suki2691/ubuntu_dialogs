2010-04-25T12:05:00.000Z	joebike		i've seen it done both ways and was just wondering what best practices are for an ubuntu/apache dev environment
2010-04-25T12:06:00.000Z	Ryan1	joebike	I have everything in my home directory... makes it easier to edit
2010-04-25T12:07:00.000Z	joebike	Ryan1	do you put projects in your user folder?
