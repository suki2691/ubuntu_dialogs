2008-06-07T12:33:00.000Z	Chrysalis		so ive only had ubuntu installed for a week and i already have 3 versions of kernels at the log in lol, i think by the 3rd week there will be no more room at the grub log in screen
2008-06-07T12:35:00.000Z	Jalathan	Chrysalis	i believe that grub scrolls down when the screen is full.  you can remove unneeded entry's, but i wouldn't recommend it right at this point
2008-06-07T12:36:00.000Z	Chrysalis	Jalathan	the point is that the kernel doesnt get upgraded and updates just add new versions and clutter
2008-06-07T12:38:00.000Z	Jalathan	Chrysalis	the old entry's allows you to use older versions of the kernel in case the current one doesn't work correctly
