2009-04-02T01:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	imachine	 most of 2003 worked  ages in older wine versions.  and someone runs office 2007 in wine.   as for versions, alwasy get latest wine from http://www.winehq.org and add the Ubuntu repo so always get latest wine.  however  use  stuff such as Open Office, Abiword,  Gnumeric, and KOffice, before doing Microsoft Office under Wine
