2009-05-26T21:36:00.000Z	aboSamoor		Hi, I am using VirtualBox with ubuntu 9.04 as host and XP as guest . Printing using XP is very slow. I am using network printer, It is not slow when I am using normal XP, any ideas ?

However regarding your issue I don't think many people that come here  print from an XP Ubuntu guest in Virtualbox,  as a result give #vbox a try and good luck
