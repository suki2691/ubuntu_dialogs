2007-04-14T07:07:00.000Z	XfceRules		I have a very sad question to ask: How can I install windows XP on another disc without screwing up grub?
2007-04-14T07:09:00.000Z	XfceRules		peeps I already have 10 different systems installed via VM, but VirtualBox doesn't support hardware accellerated 3d graphics. I really want to try out LOTR online beta
2007-04-14T07:11:00.000Z	XfceRules		Does VMWare (versus VirtualBox) support hardware accellerated 3d for things like graphic intense games?
2007-04-14T07:12:00.000Z	Linuxnewbie756	XfceRules	not used vmware, but vitrual box was slow for me, but maybe if i had better hardware it would habe been a better experience, but yet, it did work.
