2007-05-17T12:47:00.000Z	Pentalive		Hi, I can't remember what to apt-get for "time.h, stdio.h, time.h...." how can I find out?
2007-05-17T12:48:00.000Z	Flannel	Pentalive	build-essential
2007-05-17T12:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Pentalive	Do you really want that? or do you want to search?
2007-05-17T12:50:00.000Z	Flannel	Pentalive	try apt-cache search [stuff] , that'll be more fruitful than a list.
