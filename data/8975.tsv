2012-09-11T07:35:00.000Z	ClientAlive	aeon-ltd	If by outside you mean ssh or something, then no. I'm physically on this coputer. I fig that one out too though (about why I had to use sudo). Seems to me there is something funny going on with using my system though. I'd swear that after using chown and chmod to set a directory to my user then reboot it sets it back to root and whatever perms they were before.
