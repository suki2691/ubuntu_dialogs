2008-09-25T22:10:00.000Z	zigzags		anyone know how I remote connect to a computer that is behind a router? i know the internal 192.168.0.* IP of the computer, and also the external IP that the router gives it.  my guess is that its somethin like connecting to '49.211.223.(hidden)//192.168.0.102'
2008-09-25T22:12:00.000Z	zigzags		do you think maybe i connect to a certain port, and have the router forward that port to the internal IP

2008-09-25T22:14:00.000Z	zigzags	IntuitiveNipple	ok thanks I willbe able to do it once I get home im pretty sure i can figure out the port forwarding stuff ive had to do somethin similar to get torrent programs and /ctcp to work
