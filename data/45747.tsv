2009-10-14T00:33:00.000Z	mtnbkr	vox	by release do you mean the 9.01 release that is "coming soon" ??   This is a new email server at my clients school. and I'd prefer to not go through a full system "upgrade" - not just yet anyway.
2009-10-14T00:35:00.000Z	vox	mtnbkr	9.10, yes. well, failing that you can get the source and compile it yourself i guess
2009-10-14T00:36:00.000Z	mtnbkr	vox	yeah, while i am quite capable of that (been doing this morethan 12 years, I am trying as best as I can to adhere to this distro's way of doing things where possible. :)
