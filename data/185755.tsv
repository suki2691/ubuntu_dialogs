2007-03-05T14:46:00.000Z	AzraelM		Can anyone walk me through how to copy folders using the terminal? I'm having a little trouble with it
2007-03-05T14:47:00.000Z	sivik	AzraelM	its cp -R /file/location /where/yourmovingitto
2007-03-05T14:47:00.000Z	sivik	AzraelM	all you need is the -R option to cp or mv folders
