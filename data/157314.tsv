2010-06-02T14:06:00.000Z	bgsmith		greetings channel, when I boot my ubuntu 9.10 box, it waits for about 5 mins with a console screen showing udev-work: rename(/dev//.udev-tmp,/dev//) failed. invalid cross-device link ... then after a long time it shows the ubuntu icon in white in the middle of the screen and then drops me to a busybox prompt ... could someone help me with recovering this box ?

2010-06-02T14:08:00.000Z	Vigo	bgsmith	Have you ran the Recovery option?
2010-06-02T14:09:00.000Z	Vigo	bgsmith	I think it Esc at boot, but let me check the docs.
