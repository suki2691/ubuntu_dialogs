2009-09-07T02:36:00.000Z	kopolee11		Hello. I have a very weird sound problem. I looked through the forms and the docs, but didn't see anything for what I had.
2009-09-07T02:36:00.000Z	kopolee11		I have sound. However, if I listen to a flash file online (Youtube, Hulu, etc) then I can't listen to anything local. (Music, Videos, etc) And the same is true in reverse. This is the case until I restart the computer, but even then I'm still limited to listening to one thing. (Either flash or local) Is anyone familiar with this? Any ideas? Thanks!
