2004-09-29T06:44:00.000Z	zack		ubuntu doesn't work on my SATA system... which kinda lame as debian does :\
2004-09-29T06:45:00.000Z	zack		i looks like someone modified ubuntu's d-i in a way that broke it for this particular system
2004-09-29T06:46:00.000Z	mdz	zack	more likely it was fixed in debian and hasn't yet been fixed in ubuntu
2004-09-29T06:46:00.000Z	zack	mdz	it works in d-i RC1, i hope you're not that far behind ;)
