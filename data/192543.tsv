2006-04-12T13:54:00.000Z	mlaci		i've just noticed that the dapper drake install cd is compiled for i386. is there an i686 version, guys?
2006-04-12T13:54:00.000Z	FlannelKing	mlaci	386 is 686, you'll just have to update the kernel if you want.
2006-04-12T13:55:00.000Z	mlaci	FlannelKing	compiling the kernel for i686 doesn't provide optimal performance if all the other stuff is i386 compiled. or what do you mean by that?
2006-04-12T13:57:00.000Z	FlannelKing	mlaci	you get to take advantage of the newer assembly stuff, right.  Install as 386 then install the kernel for 686, the programs are the same.
