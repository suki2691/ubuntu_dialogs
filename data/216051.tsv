2006-01-06T17:25:00.000Z	CptS		hi, i'd like to set up ubntu as a web server on an old machine (p2-266 192mb 6gb hdd) will it work ok?
2006-01-06T17:25:00.000Z	Kensey	CptS	try and see.  Use the "server" install option.

2006-01-06T17:27:00.000Z	Kensey	CptS	there's no reason I can think of that it wouldn't run on that caliber of system in general, but your system may or may not have issues with particular hardware.
