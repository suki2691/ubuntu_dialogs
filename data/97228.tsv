2008-03-19T23:11:00.000Z	Toznoshio		Query: I am looking for PC-based dictionary software for Ubuntu, does anyone have any recommendations?
2008-03-19T23:11:00.000Z	soon	Toznoshio	aspell, ispell etc?
2008-03-19T23:12:00.000Z	Toznoshio	soon	I'll look into those - I've been using Lingoes on Windows XP
2008-03-19T23:16:00.000Z	Toznoshio	soon	aspell is a spell checker, not a cross-language dictionary
