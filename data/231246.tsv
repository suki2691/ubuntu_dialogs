2009-08-11T10:03:00.000Z	ghostdad		I want to setup ubuntu to use multiple partitions. I want to create a small / partition with a large /home partition. What is a reasonable size for the / partition? I don't want to run out of space on that, but I don't want there to be a ton of unused space on it either.
