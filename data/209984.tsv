2012-03-25T22:58:00.000Z	BlackWeb		Just curious, as far as "RAR" & "TAR" Archives does one or the other have a advantage over the other, Or are they pretty similar
2012-03-25T22:58:00.000Z	BlackWeb		is one faster then the other at archiving
2012-03-25T22:58:00.000Z	LjL	BlackWeb	they're different things. RAR is a compression format, tar is not
2012-03-25T22:59:00.000Z	LjL	BlackWeb	yes. usually, tar archives are compressed using gzip or bzip2
