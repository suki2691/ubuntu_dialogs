2009-04-25T11:52:00.000Z	bobbyyu	ripps	You do know that I'm using 9.04, right?
2009-04-25T11:52:00.000Z	ripps	bobbyyu	yes, you might want to file a bug report, because I'm not seeing anything similar
2009-04-25T11:54:00.000Z	ripps	bobbyyu	in the help menu in nautilus there should be an option that says 'Report a Problem', click that and follow the directions to file a bug report.
