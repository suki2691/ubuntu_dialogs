Why is it that Blacberry, Visto, Smartner, Roadsync and bunch of other 3rd party tools to access Exchange from a phone does exist, but no real exchange client fot Linux? (OWA does not cut it, because out company OWA is behind a non-standard portal, restricted and useless).

2008-04-03T16:33:00.000Z	eth01	Gatestone	i'm not debating it in here :)
