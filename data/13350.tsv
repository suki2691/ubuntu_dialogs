2011-06-13T22:21:00.000Z	chair_		im having issue mounting a dvd on a laptop, Im 100% sure ive set the correct line in /etc/fstab but it still keeps repeating "mount: no medium found on /dev/sr0" Ive browsed UbuntuForums and have not gotten very far with my issue (ver 10.10)
2011-06-13T22:22:00.000Z	beli	chair_	 maybe copy protection
2011-06-13T22:23:00.000Z	chair_		Woudnt the packages like libreaddvd4 work for that copy protection?
2011-06-13T22:38:00.000Z	chair_	beli	you mentioned copy protection, is there no way to mount a DVD in ubuntu 10.10? I know it'll take a data disc, just refuses to see any storebought DVDs
