2009-10-10T14:36:00.000Z	mnaines	icesmurf	Yeah, but another drive says 7.4GB are in use
2009-10-10T14:38:00.000Z	mnaines	icesmurf	But why would it store that stuff on the external backup drives...One drive is 150GB and is only reading 132GB available on an ext4 fs and the other is a 500GB drive reading 458GB available on ext4
