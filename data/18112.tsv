2012-01-07T06:41:00.000Z	Jonii_		Hey, is there a way to stop Ubuntu 11.10 recording everything I do?
2012-01-07T06:42:00.000Z	Jonii_		I have no idea
2012-01-07T06:43:00.000Z	Jonii_		I mean, i just want it to stop. If I knew all the places that data goes, it would be really easy to stop it, but I don't
