As far as how I've set up the e-mail server, I have a suspicion that I'm doing it "wrong"; I have getmail dumping mail into a user's maildir directory that is then made accesible via IMAP with dovecot; users log in via IMAP using the same user name and password on the server

2011-02-26T09:00:00.000Z	nsd	g_0_0	will do
