2006-06-12T08:51:00.000Z	bcl	danfg	fried with a little tobasco is good :)
2006-06-12T08:52:00.000Z	bcl	danfg	I use a blackholes.us RBL list, header checks, spamassassin and pyzor. Thunderbird with baeysian filtering on the client side. And it still doesn't stop it all.
2006-06-12T08:54:00.000Z	danfg	bcl	when you say rbl and header checks, how are these checks performed (which program?)
