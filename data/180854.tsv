2006-06-22T11:34:00.000Z	billybennett	trappist	do I have to remount the samba everytime I come back to my network?
2006-06-22T11:35:00.000Z	trappist	billybennett	I've never used samba in an environment where I get disconnected a lot, so I'm not sure.  but if you need to remount, that's one way to do it.
