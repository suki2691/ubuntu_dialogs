2006-06-08T10:46:00.000Z	A-L-P-H-A		Is there an easy way to get xorg 7.1 install on 6.06?  I'm hoping it will fix my ATI driver issue here... http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=189651

2006-06-08T10:48:00.000Z	A-L-P-H-A	farous	ATI 9200, and ATI9200se... it works... but only for one card at a time... I can't get three heads running, as X crashes.
