2007-06-09T08:43:00.000Z	Siridivi		Hello folks. My PHP doesn't work. Apache ignores the code.
2007-06-09T08:44:00.000Z	Siridivi		Worked when I first installed id, but when I do test pages, no go.
2007-06-09T08:45:00.000Z	Siridivi		Where it points to the php.ini? Yes did that.
2007-06-09T08:46:00.000Z	yo2k	Siridivi	maybe on apache.conf / httpd.conf, not in php.ini i think
