When I start Ubuntu again, however, it makes me log in. But I don't know the password for the root account! Will I have to re-burn my CD?
2007-04-12T12:22:00.000Z	Lazyguy		Or is there a default password for root?
2007-04-12T12:23:00.000Z	Lazyguy		Does sudo have the same priveliges as root?
2007-04-12T12:24:00.000Z	Organizm	Lazyguy	it depends who the user is
