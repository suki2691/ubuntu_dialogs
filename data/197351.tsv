2006-04-16T11:45:00.000Z	carthik	AngryElf	perhaps .etc.modules is what you are looking for
2006-04-16T12:01:00.000Z	AngryElf	carthik	i dont think /etc/modules is what i'm looking for, in fedora /etc/modprobe.conf contains aliases etc, and i believe it gets checked everytime modprobe is run....../etc/modules says that it contains modules that should be loaded at boot
