2005-09-13T09:30:00.000Z	DarkEagle		How do I get root permissions to my main user, because I would like to do things with graphics? I know that I should know it already but I'm going crazy with files "(read only)" :I

2005-09-13T09:31:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	DarkEagle	that would be insane
2005-09-13T09:32:00.000Z	WhiteRabbit	DarkEagle	just right click the files & check write access for that file for you current user
