2008-08-03T09:27:00.000Z	Ubuntong		I installed Firefox 3.0 in Gutsy now I can't see flash content online. What do I need to do to get flash to work?
2008-08-03T09:29:00.000Z	Maeva	Ubuntong	you need the flashplugin-nonfree to install
2008-08-03T09:30:00.000Z	Ubuntong	Maeva	I have that installed.  I tried reinstalling it also.
2008-08-03T09:31:00.000Z	Maeva	Ubuntong	in firefox there is an add-on called NoScript who can disable it
