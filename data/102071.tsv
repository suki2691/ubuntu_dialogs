2008-01-27T12:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	stanger	 Huh? the live cd works with my video cards with DVI out.
2008-01-27T12:03:00.000Z	stanger	Dr_willis	you had no problems with it?
2008-01-27T12:04:00.000Z	Dr_willis	stanger	 Nope. None at all.. If you have a video card with 2 video outs. Ive seen where some times it defaults to the other output.
