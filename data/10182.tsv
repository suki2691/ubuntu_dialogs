2011-08-23T22:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jamesans1ow	i'd imagine so, most use broadcom things afair, which work with the driver installer
2011-08-23T22:17:00.000Z	jamesans1ow	ActionParsnip	do you know of any free wireless drivers for broadcom? i know traditionally their firmware is closed
2011-08-23T22:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jamesans1ow	the firmware is proprietary so until broadcom make a move it will be the same
