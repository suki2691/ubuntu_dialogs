2010-08-09T21:13:00.000Z	oCean_	n-iCe	a combination of installing linux-backports-modules-wireless and updating my router firmware helped me fix such a problem

2010-08-09T21:17:00.000Z	oCean_	n-iCe	the package name has kernel-name extension. Try like this: linux-backports-modules-wireless-`uname -r`  I'm not sure if it has modules for your wireless adapter..
