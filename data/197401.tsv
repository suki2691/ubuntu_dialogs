2006-10-19T09:39:00.000Z	wimpies		Hi all, I have trouble getting my nvidia card to go to 1280x1024
2006-10-19T09:39:00.000Z	wimpies		xinit says : no modes or something
2006-10-19T09:40:00.000Z	wimpies		I have copied over what I had for my ATI but that did not work
2006-10-19T09:40:00.000Z	kuja	wimpies	Are you using the nvidia module?
