2011-11-13T07:57:00.000Z	ArNezT		any one can help me please: E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1) on install nagios3
2011-11-13T07:58:00.000Z	ArNezT		ps aux | grep dpkg show grep: show: No such file or directory
2011-11-13T07:59:00.000Z	apwbdjp	ArNezT	the show was in the question, the command is: ps aux | grep dpkg
2011-11-13T08:02:00.000Z	apwbdjp	ArNezT	by your command, he means the apt-get you used to install (if that's what you used)
