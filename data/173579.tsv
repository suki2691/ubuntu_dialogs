2009-06-08T19:54:00.000Z	Grimwold		hey, i could seriously need some help with installing ubuntu on an pretty old machine (600 mhz, 512 MB RAM), before starting with preparing the installation, it gives something like noacpi, force acpi or stuff. It continues but at some point (most likely when the loading bar is full) the whole machine just does nothing at all anymore
2009-06-08T19:54:00.000Z	Grimwold		any idea?
2009-06-08T19:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Grimwold	not exactly, but   you might have to edit grub menu.list and put something in there  when it comes to  noacpi  stuff
2009-06-08T19:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Grimwold	or one day the install may not even boot up properly anymore
