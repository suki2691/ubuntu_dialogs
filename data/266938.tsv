2012-08-21T03:47:00.000Z	Kuifje		I have a setup that consist of ubuntu 9.04, but from what I've read the repositories have been shut down. is it safe to edit the sources.list so that the respositories of a newer version is used so I can update the system?
2012-08-21T03:49:00.000Z	Kuifje		ok, thanks
