2007-10-20T07:06:00.000Z	aebrahim		is that going to be a problem?
2007-10-20T07:06:00.000Z	paradizelost	aebrahim	yah, there's a problem with that. the mirrors are getting hit hard, but if you keep trying, you should get it
2007-10-20T07:06:00.000Z	aebrahim	paradizelost	so basically try again later is your advice?
