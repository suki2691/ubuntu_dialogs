2009-02-09T01:25:00.000Z	WIGGMPk		My openoffice does not have "Icons" on the toolbars, it just has the words identifying the actions. Why is this? and how can I get the icons like i see in other screenshots?

2009-02-09T01:27:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Scunizi	i like my theme.. have you tried installing the hi contrast package to see if it will fix?
