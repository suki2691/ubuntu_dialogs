2007-07-13T10:38:00.000Z	MajorPayne	Newbie_Dude	KDE sucks.
2007-07-13T10:39:00.000Z	MajorPayne	Newbie_Dude	But choose what you want.  That's why I don't use Kubunut.
2007-07-13T10:50:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	MajorPayne	: I actually made the switch to Ubuntu after I found out about "Cedega" and being able to (supposedly) play some of my games -- haven't tried it yet though.
