2010-10-22T17:35:00.000Z	everyrainyday		i try to add @reboot in the beginnig of my cron job but it doesn't work what's wrong?
2010-10-22T17:36:00.000Z	everyrainyday		@reboot export DISPLAY=:0 && zenity --warning --text "hello"
2010-10-22T17:36:00.000Z	everyrainyday		shouldn't it work?
2010-10-22T17:37:00.000Z	cast	everyrainyday	seems unlikely.
