2010-04-25T04:41:00.000Z	stoiss	respire	 the networkmanager in ubuntu for most parts really is.. well.. bad..
2010-04-25T04:42:00.000Z	stoiss		ive always had to use wicd in order to get any wifi working
2010-04-25T04:42:00.000Z	respire	stoiss	i think i could make it work like magic, better than the ones you get with the windows mobile broadband programs
