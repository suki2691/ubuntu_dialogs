2012-04-14T19:53:00.000Z	bergelmir	sacarlson	haven't used wubi yet but he said he cannot choose between ubuntu and windows and that sounds like grub
2012-04-14T19:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	bergelmir	I could be mistaken so ask them
2012-04-14T19:54:00.000Z	sacarlson	bergelmir	you could be right then maybe Helo_ upgraded to something other than wubi and didn't know it?
