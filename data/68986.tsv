2009-02-27T00:38:00.000Z	JW		I have a fit-PC that came with Ubuntu preloaded. It does not have any virtual consoles enabled - only F7 (where X11 lives) - is that normal for Ubuntu?
2009-02-27T00:38:00.000Z	Titan8990	JW	no
2009-02-27T00:52:00.000Z	JW	Titan8990	_dbd_l12 Do you know what it is that might need to be reconfigured to get the other virtual console renabled
2009-02-27T00:53:00.000Z	Titan8990	JW	honestly, if you just got the laptop I would contact the manufacturer to see if they altered something to get that behavior
