2010-01-26T16:44:00.000Z	student	ekontsevoy	please try to explain
2010-01-26T16:46:00.000Z	ekontsevoy	student	this is actually not vim-specific: how do I configure any Ubuntu/GTK program to launch *in a given directory* when I press a keyboard shortcut? Gnome just asks for a command name but there is no option about which directory that command shoudl run in.
