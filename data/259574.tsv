2005-04-16T06:17:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber		why are RTF documents opening in gedit when /etc/mailcap specifies openoffice?
2005-04-16T06:18:00.000Z	Ex-Cyber		does gnome have its own association system that overrides mailcap?
2005-04-16T06:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Ex-Cyber	yeah, try right clicking the rtf file in nautilus and changing the app in properties
2005-04-16T06:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Ex-Cyber	strange default if so, I agree
