2009-02-05T07:04:00.000Z	ruediix	linux_guy	depends on your configuration.  I've run Linux variants with under 64MB of RAM, if I use a lightweight desktop environment instead of GNOME or KDE.
2009-02-05T07:09:00.000Z	ruediix	linux_guy	I'd recommend against the default install, that will take forever on an archaic machine.
2009-02-05T07:12:00.000Z	ruediix	linux_guy	is it a laptop?  If so grab an external CDROM, if it's a desktop, just grab a spare.  (I keep hundreds of spare CDROMS drives around, mainly because I never know when I'll need crappy parts for some project.)
