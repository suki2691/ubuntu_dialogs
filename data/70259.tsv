2008-12-31T20:11:00.000Z	DaveIngram		I have two monitors but they are both displaying the same thing.. how can I get the second one to extend my desktop?
2008-12-31T20:11:00.000Z	Seveas	DaveIngram	system->prefs->resolution. Untick 'mirror screens'
2008-12-31T20:12:00.000Z	DaveIngram	Seveas	It shows my two screens on top of each other... the clone screen box is unchecked, but I can't move the two around
2008-12-31T20:13:00.000Z	DaveIngram	Seveas	It also has a box that says Unknown.. as if it's see a third monitor /:
