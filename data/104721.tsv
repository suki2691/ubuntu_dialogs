2011-08-16T03:55:00.000Z	dequeued		even with no drives or network connection plugged in, when UEFI is enabled, "ubuntu" appears as an option
2011-08-16T03:55:00.000Z	dequeued		is it possible that ubutunu added itself to my motherboard somehow?
2011-08-16T03:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dequeued	no, thats not possible. There are some Linuxy things you can use to put Linux in the BIOS, but it's not default in Ubuntu
