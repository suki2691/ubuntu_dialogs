2012-03-07T04:33:00.000Z	l_r		what is the gcc version in ubuntu beta 12 04?
2012-03-07T04:33:00.000Z	l_r		are there any plans to use gcc 4.7?
2012-03-07T04:35:00.000Z	pfifo	l_r	sure, things always are getting upgraded, if you cant wait I heard there is a few PPA's that have gcc4.7 with c++11 support
