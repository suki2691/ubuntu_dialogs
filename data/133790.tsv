2008-07-31T22:32:00.000Z	shadowimmage		hello everyone! I have a question about gdebi package installer. I opened a package, and got an error about a dependency not being "satisfiable" what does that mean??
2008-07-31T22:33:00.000Z	Pici	shadowimmage	It means that the package requires something that it cannot find.
2008-07-31T22:34:00.000Z	shadowimmage	Pici	I looked for the package that it wants in synaptic, and couldn't find it, what do I do then?
2008-07-31T22:34:00.000Z	Pici	shadowimmage	What are you trying to install and what is it looking for?
