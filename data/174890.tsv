2006-07-14T14:01:00.000Z	Usul		hey I tried rebooting my laptop without the eth0 conf'd but instead of solving the problem it sorta made it worst. I can't boot into my laptop anymore. I guess I could ssh into it. So is there a way to reconfigure the eth0 throught the terminal?
2006-07-14T14:03:00.000Z	Usul		anyone know how to configure the eth0 through terminal command?
2006-07-14T14:04:00.000Z	Banach	Usul	using ifconfig?
2006-07-14T14:05:00.000Z	Usul	Banach	i dont know. i mean to have it preconfigured. My real problem is that i cant boot into ubuntu when disconnected from the web, even using a liveCD6.06 and so i tried turning off eth0 and rebooting and now i cant even boot into it at all
