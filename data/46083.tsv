2009-12-11T22:50:00.000Z	Hajex		hi ..I upgrade my system from 8.04 to 8.10 and finally 9.04 but unfortunatly I lose bluetooth , camera , m2 reader , video adaper how can I retrieve them ?
2009-12-11T22:51:00.000Z	DaZ	Hajex	upgrade to 9.10 :f
2009-12-11T22:52:00.000Z	Hajex	DaZ	each time they tell my upgrade will solve problem .. let me try .. thanks
2009-12-11T22:52:00.000Z	DaZ	Hajex	it probably won't but fixing something just to let it break during the upgrade isn't the way
