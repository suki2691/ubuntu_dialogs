2008-11-04T19:48:00.000Z	Pici	RUMMY	'Support' refers to security updates and community tech support.
2008-11-04T19:49:00.000Z	Pici	RUMMY	8.04 will always have 2.6.24, 8.10 has 2.6.27
2008-11-04T19:58:00.000Z	Pici	RUMMY	Use whichever you want.  Check out the 8.10 release notes to see if there are any incompatibilities.  One of the most oft reported issues is with graphics cards, but its mentioned in the release notes.
