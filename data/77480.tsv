2009-02-27T00:38:00.000Z	JW		I have a fit-PC that came with Ubuntu preloaded. It does not have any virtual consoles enabled - only F7 (where X11 lives) - is that normal for Ubuntu?
2009-02-27T00:38:00.000Z	_dbd_l12	JW	that's not standard behaviour, no
2009-02-27T00:57:00.000Z	_dbd_l12	JW	what does "sudo chvt n" give  (with n=5 for example)
2009-02-27T00:58:00.000Z	_dbd_l12	JW	i'd read here for some suggestions (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg/+bug/24073)
