2006-11-28T10:26:00.000Z	sanityx	keeganX	sounds like an alacarte bug or something. try apt-get update and then apt-get install alacarte to make sure its the newest version
2006-11-28T10:30:00.000Z	sanityx	keeganX	Yeah. Its called vi
2006-11-28T10:30:00.000Z	sanityx	keeganX	I have no idea. That was kind of a joke. But Amaranth knows im sure.
