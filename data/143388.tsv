2007-04-25T06:47:00.000Z	kaktuskatta		Hi! I'm having trouble with my ATi card after upgrading to 6.10. I'm unable to use the correct driver, because X server hangs every time I try. I followed the guide at http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Installation_Guide with no luck. Can someone help me out?
