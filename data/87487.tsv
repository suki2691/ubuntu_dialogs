2008-11-07T22:36:00.000Z	Reformer81	erUSUL	Well, seeing how the forums are filled with complaints about my problems without any solutions, I'd say it isn't a "gross" generalization.
2008-11-07T22:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	Reformer81	you lnow people for wht things just work do not post in forums looking for help so if you are trying to do stadistics you should choose a different sample than people on forums... i've been here for 4 years and the only thing i see here is people with problems with ubuntu that fact have not make me think ubuntu is buggy (becouse it works for me)
