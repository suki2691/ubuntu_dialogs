2010-07-02T13:48:00.000Z	linux		Would anyone in here be able to tell me if this PC (I am buying it) would be compatible with Ubuntu? http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=350371341736&refid=store#ht_17272wt_934

2010-07-02T13:54:00.000Z	mrwizeguy1983	linux	the processor is supported VERY well
2010-07-02T13:56:00.000Z	mrwizeguy1983	linux	i'm far from the most knowledgeable on here, a second opinion is a good idea.  i think you could make it work, but i'd bet money it will take a good bit of work to do
