2006-05-16T11:02:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		eobanb: the info from !sound has my sound running now, but the mixer is cryptic
2006-05-16T11:02:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		is there any way to re-label the mixer controls?
2006-05-16T11:04:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		is !sound the only info on sound setup available here?
2006-05-16T11:04:00.000Z	eobanb_	ToHellWithGA	i dont know of a way to re-label the mixer controls without recompiling that part of gnome, sorry
