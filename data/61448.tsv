2009-03-29T11:51:00.000Z	billywayne		i'm looking to get an ssh account with the server running ubuntu.  I see shellweb.net has ubuntu.  is this a reputable service?

2009-03-29T11:53:00.000Z	billywayne	kindofabuzz	no hardware at the moment.  just a couple of laptops.  and I'm not sure how/if I'm going to use the service.  I have a use case for it, but don't have the hardware and don't want to fool with complications.
