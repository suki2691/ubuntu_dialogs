2005-07-09T10:47:00.000Z	blueyed		what's better? sharing a fat32 partition between winXP and Ubuntu or an ext3 (I have a driver for XP that can read/write ext3)?
2005-07-09T10:47:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	blueyed	 where is that driver, and ext3 is better
2005-07-09T10:48:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	blueyed	 if the driver works
2005-07-09T10:50:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	blueyed	 where'd you get the driver from
