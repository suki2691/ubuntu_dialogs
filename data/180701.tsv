2008-04-14T07:53:00.000Z	aleka		I am using the current Firefox[2.0.0.13] package from the ubuntu Repos on Gutsy... Firefox has been terribly slow and eats up a lot of CPU if I have 2 or more tabs open (can't even switch tabs while the new tab is loading). I do not have compiz enabled... is there a know issue with this? What can I do to improve FF performance?
2008-04-14T07:54:00.000Z	travisat	aleka	do you have any plugins for firefox installed?

2008-04-14T07:57:00.000Z	travisat	aleka	oh well, that doesn't have any problem at least for me,  The only problems with cpu I have ever had came from plugins
