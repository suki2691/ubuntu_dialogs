2010-06-07T22:53:00.000Z	malchias	greezmunkey	that's really a cool solution for other things, but I am hosting a few websites on one server and need their scripts to be able to send email.  What is a good solution for this?   They don't process email (no incoming mail), only send it for notifications, password recovery and the like
