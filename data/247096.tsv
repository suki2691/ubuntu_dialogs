2005-03-27T15:46:00.000Z	pauldaoust	bwlang	or is that only if you haven't uninstalled the ubuntu-desktop stub package like I have? ^_^
2005-03-27T15:46:00.000Z	bwlang	pauldaoust	you're probaly right... the set of packages might be slightly different... but a quick round of apt-get should solve it.
2005-03-27T15:47:00.000Z	pauldaoust	bwlang	that's interesting; I didn't know it was that easy.
