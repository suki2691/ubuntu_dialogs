2010-04-05T01:22:00.000Z	Tobbi		Hey. Apparently, I can't join any WPA2 wifi network..Unencrypted works fine. Any ideas on this?
2010-04-05T01:24:00.000Z	knoppies	Tobbi	I have the same problem. I havnt had time to address the issue
2010-04-05T01:25:00.000Z	Tobbi	knoppies	Very weird...
2010-04-05T01:26:00.000Z	knoppies	Tobbi	I know. I assume its either a setting somewhere or a driver isnt doing what its supposed to.
