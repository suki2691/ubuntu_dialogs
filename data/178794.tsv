2012-10-07T14:42:00.000Z	Elvano-		I'm looking to backup my thunderbird mails but there isn't any .thunderbird file in my home directory (yes I'm showing hidden files) Has it been moved in Ubuntu 12.04?
2012-10-07T14:43:00.000Z	jrib	Elvano-	maybe ~/.config/ .  If not, use find to search for it
2012-10-07T14:43:00.000Z	jrib	Elvano-	or ~/.mozilla/
2012-10-07T14:45:00.000Z	jrib	Elvano-	I'm just making guesses for you.  I don't actually have thunderbird installed
