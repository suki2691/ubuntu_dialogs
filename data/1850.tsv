2012-07-24T14:20:00.000Z	reGative		Hello, guys! I use xmonad and xmobar and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. And I have this configuration for xmobar - https://github.com/daGrevis/Dotfiles/blob/master/.xmobarrc . But when I run xmobar &, they says - "xmobar: /home/edgars/.xmobarrc: configuration file contains errors!". Where is the error?
2012-07-24T14:21:00.000Z	chu	reGative	It'd be an error in .xmobarrc
2012-07-24T14:25:00.000Z	reGative	chu	But where is the error? Maybe my ubuntu doesn't support any feature from .xmobarrc file?
2012-07-24T14:25:00.000Z	chu	reGative	I don't know anything about xmonad.
