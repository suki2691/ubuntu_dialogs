2009-04-20T05:41:00.000Z	AussieGuy		ive got a 1Tb hard drive arriving tomorrow, cos im running out of space. Whats a convenient way to clone my linux system from one hard drive to a new one?
2009-04-20T05:41:00.000Z	jdu	AussieGuy	could use gparted
2009-04-20T05:41:00.000Z	jdu	AussieGuy	put it can also copy from one hard drive to another
2009-04-20T05:43:00.000Z	jdu	AussieGuy	sure, I would suggest that you are more likely to run into problems with dd and gparted will allow you to add additional partitions etc easily.
