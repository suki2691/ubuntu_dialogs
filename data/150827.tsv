2007-01-21T08:10:00.000Z	phiqtion		i just installed kubuntu-desktop, when logging in it says something about a file not being found. Before i installed kubuntu, i selected GDM as default. Did i did something wrong? any help will be highly appreciated

2007-01-21T08:11:00.000Z	phiqtion	goodgerster	will do
2007-01-21T08:12:00.000Z	goodgerster	phiqtion	KDM != KDE
