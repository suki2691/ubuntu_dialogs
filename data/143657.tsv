2008-04-28T06:17:00.000Z	rjonesx	Jordan_U	I cant get Miro to start, but it doesnt cause any kind of error on the command line - i would like to see if a crash is occuring that is just not showing up
2008-04-28T06:18:00.000Z	rjonesx	Jordan_U	Also, I dont have the desktop settings manager included for some reason, do you happen to know the name of that program? ie: used to control beryl settings...
