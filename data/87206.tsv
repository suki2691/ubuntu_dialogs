2009-04-29T07:01:00.000Z	xubean		i have a general question about ubuntu, is there a way to make an upgrade a bit more fresh?
2009-04-29T07:01:00.000Z	xubean		what i mean is, I think my computer is not as fast as it should be as a fresh install... when i create a new user, everything runs much faster.. but i don't want to go through the hassle of creating a new user and setting up everything like i have for my current user all over again.. thanks for any help!
2009-04-29T07:02:00.000Z	xubean		can someone at least tell me if you guys r seeing my msgs? i don't know if anyone's even seeing my msgs?!
