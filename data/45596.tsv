2011-07-08T09:59:00.000Z	adamkex	NickNakz	xchat if you want a graphical one
2011-07-08T10:01:00.000Z	adamkex	NickNakz	it doesn't really matter what you use, if you want to use an irc in the terminal use irssi or weechat
2011-07-08T10:01:00.000Z	adamkex	NickNakz	i think xchat is easier to configure if you want to use tor, why do you want to use tor anyways, it is banned from many irc networks
