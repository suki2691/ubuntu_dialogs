2007-12-10T05:45:00.000Z	Pelo	soundray_	30 mb/s means I should be filling up my 2 gig flash in 68 secs ? is is 30mB or 30mb /s ?
2007-12-10T05:46:00.000Z	soundray_	Pelo	(ikonia): 30 megabytes per second is what I meant. Your arithmetic isn't quite right.
2007-12-10T05:47:00.000Z	Pelo	soundray_	 30 mB ? ok my arithmetic is   2 gig x 1024 meg / 30 meg/s  = 68 sec
2007-12-10T05:50:00.000Z	soundray_	Pelo	I take it all back. You are right. If you do get 30MB written to the disk in a second (which is possible on USB2.0 with recent disks), then you will indeed fill up your 2GB in 68 seconds
