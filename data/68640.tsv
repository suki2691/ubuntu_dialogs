2009-04-26T22:55:00.000Z	chazco		Hi... how can I play .ogm with Totem-streamer on 9.04 (currently using totem-xine, but not ideal)? Currently with gstreamer only the sound plays...
2009-04-26T22:56:00.000Z	chazco		Also, how can I change the GDM theme from the command line (and is it possible to get the old Ubuntu login screen back)?
2009-04-26T22:57:00.000Z	MK13	chazco	for the loging screen go to System-> Administration -> Login Windows-> local tab
2009-04-26T22:57:00.000Z	chazco	MK13	- Need to change it via the command line (shell script)
