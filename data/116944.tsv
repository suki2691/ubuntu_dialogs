2012-11-22T17:00:00.000Z	Mechdave	ms_	where did you install rar from?
2012-11-22T17:00:00.000Z	ms_	Mechdave	iceroot, sudo apt-get install unrar-free
2012-11-22T17:02:00.000Z	Mechdave	ms_	may be better to purge the unrar you have and install the one from the Ubuntu repository. sudo apt-get install unrar
