2008-04-05T06:11:00.000Z	c0Ld		Would it be possible to allow Ubuntu to install to all of my free space and then re-size its partition again after installation to allow more space for my other partitions again?
2008-04-05T06:11:00.000Z	nikrud	c0Ld	look for the manual partitioning, you can set it up as you like
2008-04-05T06:21:00.000Z	nikrud	c0Ld	is that free space on the ntfs partition, or free space outside the ntfs partition?
2008-04-05T06:22:00.000Z	nikrud	c0Ld	then you need to resize the ntfs first. If you are using vista, use the disk management tool in vista to do that
