2011-01-16T04:25:00.000Z	matlock		I don't get why installing amarok doesn't prompt for mp3 support
2011-01-16T04:25:00.000Z	matlock		and why you have to manually figure out why amarok won't play mp3's
2011-01-16T04:26:00.000Z	matlock		KM0201; yea, considering i can play mp3's with every other program than amarok
2011-01-16T04:27:00.000Z	WeThePeople	matlock	have you tried reinstalling
