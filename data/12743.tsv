2011-07-02T21:11:00.000Z	rakshasa73		i'm searching for a way to hide my ubuntu host from windows network resources over my lan. Can someone help me?
2011-07-02T21:11:00.000Z	edbian	rakshasa73	Did you set Ubuntu up as a file server or web server or ssh server or something?
2011-07-02T21:17:00.000Z	rakshasa73	edbian	no i didn't anything, i had installed mint, in network shares i see my host name. So i think it 's visible to other hosts of my lan. Waht i want is  still see windows shares or host names without show my hostname,.
