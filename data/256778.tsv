2004-11-29T15:50:00.000Z	skeff		Wow..FireFox is so much faster here on this Live CD at least than it was compiled for my Gentoo system, what gives?

2004-11-29T15:53:00.000Z	skeff	GotD0t	I am positive. But maybe there was a problem with my gentoo system. Anything from the kernel, GTK+ or so on could cause it I guess
