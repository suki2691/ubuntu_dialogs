2010-02-08T08:13:00.000Z	fosser_josh		I have a laptop lenovo y500 and I installed ubuntu 9.10 but now problem is that sound is not proper, there is a sound but its like a noisy sound no clear sound from laptop speakers

2010-02-08T08:16:00.000Z	fosser_josh	tp43	nah in external speakers sounds work fine but for internal speakers its giving problem
2010-02-08T08:16:00.000Z	tp43	fosser_josh	oh, so I was right, your speakers are blown.  You bought it used?
