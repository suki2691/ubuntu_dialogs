2011-02-23T08:34:00.000Z	magpiie		good morning folks, any chance anyone could help me with soundcard drivers for an asus laptop running ubuntu 10.10 maverick?
2011-02-23T08:36:00.000Z	magpiie		at least, i think its a driver issue, basically the sound works fine, but when i plug earphones in, i get sound both through the laptop speakers as well as the earphones, i have fiddled with sound preferences and nothing seems to resolve it
