2010-08-19T02:06:00.000Z	raiffa		is it safe to remove lucid-updates? I have server that I configured for a single purpose and don't ever want to change it
2010-08-19T02:06:00.000Z	maco	raiffa	updates, yes
2010-08-19T02:07:00.000Z	maco	raiffa	disabling -security is a bad idea though
2010-08-19T02:07:00.000Z	raiffa	maco	rww: okay. yeah, I figured -security was necessary
