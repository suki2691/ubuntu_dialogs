2010-06-08T20:25:00.000Z	lucenut		I am interested in a way to run Ubuntu at the same time as my windows.
2010-06-08T20:25:00.000Z	lucenut		I have development environments running on my windows that I can't turn off. But I tried running Ubuntu in a VM using Virtualbox and it would only go to like 1024 pixels.
2010-06-08T20:26:00.000Z	lucenut		Are other virtual environments better? I was hoping to just run it fullscreen and be able to almost forget about the windows running.
