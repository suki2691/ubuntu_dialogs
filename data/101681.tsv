2009-01-30T11:36:00.000Z	freyyr		hi, i just got gutsy (finally) running on a g3 imac.  I'm trying to install gnash because adobe doesn't have a PPC binary.  whenever I go into mozilla  I get a gray box.  any suggestions?
2009-01-30T11:37:00.000Z	foxwoods	freyyr	did gnash install correctly?
2009-01-30T11:38:00.000Z	freyyr	foxwoods	to my knowledge, yes.  I installed with "apt-get install gnash gnash-plugin-mozilla" and apt returned and installed without error
