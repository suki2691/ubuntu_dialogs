2005-05-04T05:10:00.000Z	runedude		I use debian 3.1 or something, (sid) and I want to upgrade to ubuntu, is it possible to just do a sources.list and use the ubuntu ones and just apt-get update, upgrade? or do I have to get the CDs?
2005-05-04T05:11:00.000Z	runedude		and that would upgrade everything to the ubuntu version?
2005-05-04T05:11:00.000Z	randabis	runedude	yes, it should do so
