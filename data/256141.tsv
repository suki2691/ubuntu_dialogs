2008-12-23T15:13:00.000Z	narcarsiss		apt-get install deluge-torrent also installs deluge-torrent-common rite but when you download .deb file off official website and try to install it. it conflicts with deluge-torrent-common and wont install and wont uninstall deluge-torrent-common automaticl
2008-12-23T15:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	narcarsiss	 what 'official' web site?
2008-12-23T15:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	narcarsiss	 its normally a bad idea to mix and match debs that way.  So its not really a 'bug'  in the ubuntu packages.   If you wan tto use  non-ubuntu packages.. then i would suggest manyually removing the  ubuntu ones
