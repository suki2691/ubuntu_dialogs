2008-05-31T00:39:00.000Z	Dr_Link		I have asked several times, can anyone answer my sound-related question for Ubuntu?
2008-05-31T00:40:00.000Z	Dr_Link		In the Sound manager, I have set up to Ensoniq AudioPCI (which is the ONLY PCI one listed, I have integrated sound disabled and the speakers plugged into the sound card
2008-05-31T00:40:00.000Z	Dr_Link		when I play a test sound, I hear a "beeeeeeeeep" from the speakers. When I play any other sound, such as that from a .avi file or from .mp3 files that I know work, because I previously could use sound... I hear silence.
2008-05-31T00:40:00.000Z	Kl4m	Dr_Link	ask the question (again...) , don't ask if someone can answer
