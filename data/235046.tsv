2007-07-15T06:03:00.000Z	DWRZ		anyone? i've scanned forums and manuals and not much is very relevant... just want a sense of direction
2007-07-15T06:04:00.000Z	dug	DWRZ	are you trying to use ndiswrapper?
2007-07-15T06:11:00.000Z	dug	DWRZ	you might post the problem you had and details about your system on the thread you mentioned, and/or here.  The instructions I used to get my bcm4310 (not 4318) card working are here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=297092
2007-07-15T06:21:00.000Z	dug	DWRZ	sorry I can't help, the instructions I used required downloading some stuff using apt-get, but your ethernet card is broken
