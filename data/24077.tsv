2010-10-15T01:39:00.000Z	DrGrov		Is it a good time now to update to 10.10 from 10.04?
2010-10-15T01:39:00.000Z	DrGrov		Or should I still wait some time for 10.10 to become stable?
2010-10-15T01:40:00.000Z	Chaser	DrGrov	looking at known issues  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MaverickMeerkat/ReleaseNotes doesnt hurt :)
2010-10-15T01:41:00.000Z	DrGrov	Chaser	Thanks, pretty sure though 10.10 can not be more troublesome than 10.04 lol
