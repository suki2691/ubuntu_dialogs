2010-02-07T01:07:00.000Z	raversfantasy		Hi all, ive installed Ubuntu 9.10 a while ago and after ive installed "E17-Enlightenment" my "Gnome Network Manager Applet" was replaced by another one, which isnt compatible to ndiswrapper
2010-02-07T01:07:00.000Z	raversfantasy		Is there a possibilty to reinstall the Network-Manager-Applet over the Installation-CD ?
2010-02-07T01:08:00.000Z	raversfantasy		ok, would you be so nice to tell me exactly what i got to do :)
2010-02-07T01:09:00.000Z	hoonteke	raversfantasy	you're looking for the network-manager-gnome package, I believe.  you can do that through the System->Administration->Synaptics program
