2007-10-06T08:55:00.000Z	devious`		i got a problem: cant boot my kubuntu partition :S
2007-10-06T08:56:00.000Z	pastyhermit	devious`	what happened? did you install something over it, or muddle with your partition table?
2007-10-06T08:56:00.000Z	devious`	pastyhermit	i didnt do anythin, i just restarted and it wont boot anymore. Im a newb to linux so i didnt mess with anything. From windows, that partition appears as RAW!!
