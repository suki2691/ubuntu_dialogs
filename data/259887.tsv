2004-11-11T10:50:00.000Z	Hikaru79		How come certain packages, like evolution or some of the games, that came with Ubuntu, wante to delete 'ubuntu-desktop' in Synaptic if I try to uninstall them. Does this mean I CAN'T remove these packages?

2004-11-11T10:53:00.000Z	Hikaru79	mvo_	so is it safe to remove it? O_O
2004-11-11T10:55:00.000Z	mvo_	Hikaru79	yes
