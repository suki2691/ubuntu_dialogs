2006-06-02T15:03:00.000Z	claes	pedrocr	Try sudo dpkg --configure -a
2006-06-02T15:05:00.000Z	pedrocr	claes	nothing was installed yet, I think it was still downloading
2006-06-02T15:06:00.000Z	claes	pedrocr	Then sudo aptitude update ; sudo aptitude upgrade ; sudo aptitude dist-upgrade ; sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop
