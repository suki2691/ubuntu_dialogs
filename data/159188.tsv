2008-08-27T03:31:00.000Z	nks_		Hello, I had a quick question to ask- I'm a newbie - Which is better, Kde4 or ubuntu 8.04 ? I'm planning on installing one or the other....
2008-08-27T03:32:00.000Z	DjViper	nks_	kde4 is a 'beta'
2008-08-27T03:33:00.000Z	DjViper	nks_	you can have both installed at the same time
2008-08-27T03:34:00.000Z	DjViper	nks_	kde4 is fancy, but not stable, gnome is simple and userfriendly
