2006-12-22T15:59:00.000Z	un_operateur	tomh-	as many as the harddisk will contain? :)
2006-12-22T16:02:00.000Z	un_operateur	tomh-	its a variable amount
2006-12-22T16:03:00.000Z	un_operateur	tomh-	it depends on how the data structure for the file table is implemented on disk and how much space it occupies
