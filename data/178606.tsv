2009-05-19T22:01:00.000Z	Bob_Dole		OK, so something is playing audio.... but I don't know what...
2009-05-19T22:03:00.000Z	Bob_Dole		It's a song I have on my fileserver... I was trying to get rhythmbox to play it, but it was just throwing errors. I closed rhytmbox, and music is still playing. The errors were "can not import file" and was something about gstreamer, and rhythmbox.
