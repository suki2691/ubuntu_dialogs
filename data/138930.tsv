2007-07-08T15:39:00.000Z	n3rrd		i'm having trouble getting ubuntu to boot consistently on this laptop that I am using and I've read that it's because it has an issue with my mini-pci card.  any idea how I can manually tell it what the device is?
2007-07-08T15:40:00.000Z	n3rrd		[selfsearcher] : I did not.  I told him how to manually edit xorg.conf, I didn't have him run anything
