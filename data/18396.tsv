2011-06-29T19:58:00.000Z	De|ta		hi all, just done apt-get dist-upgrade on my 10.04 LTS Server box and it's stopped on "Setting up grub-pc (1.98-1ubuntu12) ..." any ideas?
2011-06-29T19:58:00.000Z	De|ta		oh, I tell a lie - it's just gone to Installation finished. No error reported.
2011-06-29T19:59:00.000Z	De|ta		but I don't have the prompt back
2011-06-29T20:00:00.000Z	Incarus6	De|ta	have you rebooted since then?
