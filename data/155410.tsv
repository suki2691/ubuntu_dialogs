2012-07-06T12:34:00.000Z	d1gital		My console resolution looked fine with the nouveau drivers, but now that I'm running nvidia, the resolution's too low (except when running X).  How can I configure the resolution used outside of X?

2012-07-06T12:37:00.000Z	d1gital	dr_willis	how do I get at the framebuffer settings?
2012-07-06T12:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	d1gital	i tend to just turn framebuffers off totally. ;) not used them in ages
