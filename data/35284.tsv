2010-08-21T01:23:00.000Z	darth_tux71		ok I have a slight annoyance I installed KDE but I cannot select it from the login screen
2010-08-21T01:24:00.000Z	darth_tux71		I used to be able to switch desktops on the fly from the login now there is no way to do it unless I am totally blind
2010-08-21T01:25:00.000Z	Oer	darth_tux71	did you reboot, after install KDE or logout ?
2010-08-21T01:27:00.000Z	Oer	darth_tux71	i'm not sure , logging out should be my first choice too.
