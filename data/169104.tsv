2009-12-30T09:13:00.000Z	curtmack		I just tried to upgrade to Ubuntu 9.10. At some point in the process the computer crashed at the kernel level (REISUB did not work). So I power cycled it, and it booted up fine. Is there anything I should do before trying to upgrade again?
2009-12-30T09:15:00.000Z	curtmack		okay, different question: At this point, would you say it's simpler to download an Ubuntu 9.10 ISO, install a fresh copy, and then manually install all my programs?
2009-12-30T09:15:00.000Z	curtmack		I have /home on a different partition
2009-12-30T09:16:00.000Z	mkquist	curtmack	i find that its faster to just do a fresh install, upgrades always take me forever
