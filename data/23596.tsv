2010-10-24T06:45:00.000Z	Condorito		(?) Help please. ufw problems. Still can't open a port in ufw for incoming traffic for Transmission torrent. Any ideas?
2010-10-24T06:47:00.000Z	Condorito		Did this earlier,  sudo ufw allow 51413
2010-10-24T06:48:00.000Z	justupgraded	Condorito	similar, but that only allows one port - dont torrents use a range of ports?
2010-10-24T06:48:00.000Z	Condorito	justupgraded	ah! (facepalm)
