2012-05-01T03:54:00.000Z	MirkoKa	elky	 copy them to your ~/.fonts directory, done
2012-05-01T03:57:00.000Z	elky	MirkoKa	no system-wide option?
2012-05-01T03:59:00.000Z	MirkoKa	elky	copy them to a fitting (or own) directory in /usr/share/fonts if i√Ñm not mistaken, they will be picked up from there too (inotify is really cool^^)
