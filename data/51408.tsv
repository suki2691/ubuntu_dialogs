2009-08-12T10:58:00.000Z	mlissner	HighLordObsi	haha. what the heck did I do to make Ubuntu behave this way?
2009-08-12T11:00:00.000Z	HighLordObsi	mlissner	no clue.... its annoying in windows...and it just started a couple of weeks ago...for some reason i think i drag and dropped something somewhere and for some reason it set that as a setting
2009-08-12T11:04:00.000Z	mlissner	HighLordObsi	Yeah, that was what I thought I did too, but I figured it would self-correct eventually...apparently not.
