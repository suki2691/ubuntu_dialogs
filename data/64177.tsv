2010-04-05T21:15:00.000Z	tuntis		I have a Windows 7 install on my first hard disk and an Ubuntu 9.10 install on my second hard disk (this disk also has one NTFS partition). For one reason or another, I need to keep Windows's bootloader - how can I boot into Ubuntu from that?

2010-04-05T21:16:00.000Z	xangua		you need grub
2010-04-05T21:16:00.000Z	tuntis	xangua	Is it possible to install grub on the Ubuntu partition or something and chain that from Windows's bootloader?
