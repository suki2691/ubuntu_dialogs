2006-11-16T09:46:00.000Z	Jimbo		I just formated my second hard drive to ext3 using gparted, and now it has a folder in it named Lost+found, which is unreadable and unwriteable, and the entire drive is also apparently unwritable, as I cannot right click and make a folder. What do I need to do to correct this?
