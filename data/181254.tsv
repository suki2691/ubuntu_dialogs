2007-07-02T13:02:00.000Z	jlund	bruenig	Is that new? It didn't back in the Breezy days when I first started getting in the habit of typing 'aptitude' instead :).
2007-07-02T13:02:00.000Z	bruenig	jlund	well yeah new since 20 months ago
2007-07-02T13:03:00.000Z	bruenig	jlund	difference is with apt-get is an option, need to do apt-get autoremove to do it, whereas aptitude forces it which generally is cool but on occasion might be against what you want
