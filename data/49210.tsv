2009-09-03T17:06:00.000Z	jiohdi		 I have three programs that appear on start up, how do I keep that from happening?
2009-09-03T17:07:00.000Z	phux	jiohdi	if you are using ubuntu, there is some startup config in the settings menu
2009-09-03T17:07:00.000Z	jiohdi	phux	I am using Xfce on ubuntu
2009-09-03T17:13:00.000Z	jiohdi	phux	rc.local has nothing useful in it
