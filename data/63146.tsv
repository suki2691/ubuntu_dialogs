2009-05-01T05:58:00.000Z	BCS-Satori		I am trying to install UB 9.04 on my nVidia Raid 5.  I have installed dmraid in the live disk and done a dmraid -r and it sees my drives and says its a supported raid type; however I dont think they are "joined" when I go into gparted it claims my raid 5 is 250GB when in reality I have 4x250GB.  Any ideas?

2009-05-01T06:00:00.000Z	BCS-Satori	centHOGG	nope just on the Desktop-x64 right now
2009-05-01T06:00:00.000Z	centHOGG	BCS-Satori	experiment with that install... more control
