2009-03-02T04:06:00.000Z	cdenny		im using vista right now on a custom built computer.  I hate vista.  I want to use ubuntu, but have questions.  I am a student of multimedia design so I have all adobe apps as well as 3ds max; which I understand are not available in ubuntu.
2009-03-02T04:06:00.000Z	cdenny		why should I use ubuntu?
2009-03-02T04:06:00.000Z	cdenny		vista is just wrong sometimes.
