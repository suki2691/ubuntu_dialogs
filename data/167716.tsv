2006-09-13T13:11:00.000Z	davin	jiff	yes but you need to install the MBR on your first hard disk if you still want to use Windows (if I am correct)
2006-09-13T13:12:00.000Z	davin	jiff	also you will need a bios that supports booting from a usb hard disk of course (or choosing where to boot from, my compaq presario sr desktop has a boot menu when you hit Esc at bootup)
