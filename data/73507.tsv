2009-09-25T07:58:00.000Z	harisund		 I have Windows XP on a 160GB hard disk. It is not partitioned, all 160GB is entirely C:\. However, I am using only around 40GB. Is there anyway I can partition the hard disk while still keeping Windows? I think I start with a defragment, and after that what next?
