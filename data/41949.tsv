2009-11-24T17:36:00.000Z	exxxo45		hello everybody. I installed Ubuntu 9.10 on Windows Vista system, now I can't boot Vista-restarts on blue screen. Any suggestions? Help would be greatly appreciated

2009-11-24T17:40:00.000Z	exxxo45	SpaceGhost	is there any solution how to dual boot? I tried to search for it, but couldn't get an answer
