2008-08-08T14:39:00.000Z	Jaef		Hi, I just booted from a Live CD for the first time due to some delightful dll malfunctions in Vista causing explorer not to start, I'm trying to get into my hard drives to restore some files but it doesn't want to mount them since the log file indicates an improper shutdown. Any tips?
2008-08-08T14:41:00.000Z	Jaef		You think a hard button shutdown from the login screen would work? I can't even log in to Vista
2008-08-08T14:41:00.000Z	Jaef		And there's no shutdown option from the login screen IIRC
