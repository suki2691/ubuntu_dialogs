2008-11-08T00:36:00.000Z	ConstantineXVI	Zoem	i believe NM gives you a fair amount of manual control, r-click, edit connections
2008-11-08T00:37:00.000Z	Zoem	ConstantineXVI	NM now has the nm-connection-editor as its connection editor, which throws an error whenever I try to edit a connection
2008-11-08T00:38:00.000Z	Zoem	ConstantineXVI	"Updating connection failed: nm-ifupdown-connection.c.82 - connection update not supported (read-only).." is the error it gives me
