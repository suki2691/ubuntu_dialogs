2009-01-11T22:43:00.000Z	og01		just installed latest ubuntu, and performed all updates, I need 2.8.24 for a wireless driver, whats the best method to update to this kernel - is it in any repo?
2009-01-11T22:45:00.000Z	jtaji	og01	there is no 2.8 kernel, you probably mean 2.6.24 in which case you already have 2.6.27 wiht intrepid
2009-01-11T22:46:00.000Z	og01	jtaji	sorry yes - typo
2009-01-11T22:47:00.000Z	og01	jtaji	Jack_Sparrow: what will happen when new kernel is released to ubuntu mainsteam?
