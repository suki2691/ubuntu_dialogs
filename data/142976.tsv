2007-04-20T05:50:00.000Z	yellow_chicken		i have 6.10 and applied all the updates, now i have 2 kernel versions, 2.6.17-10 and 2.6.17-11.  should i use -11 to upgrade to ubuntu 7.04?
2007-04-20T05:50:00.000Z	spikeb	yellow_chicken	yeah probably
2007-04-20T05:50:00.000Z	spikeb	yellow_chicken	i dont think it will matter what you're actually running as long as both are installed.
2007-04-20T05:53:00.000Z	yellow_chicken	spikeb	 i did a fresh install of 6.10, and have to update 165 packages, took like 30 to 40 minutes
