2007-04-09T09:47:00.000Z	KDan		what's the easiest way to create an open samba share that doesn't ask for a password, from ubuntu? I tried using "Shared Folders" under Applications>System but it asks for a password when logging in from the windows box and doesn't provide an option to set the password...
