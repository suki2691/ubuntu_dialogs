2010-11-08T07:09:00.000Z	miststlkr		I am trying to get sounds working in Empathy.  Added the PPA, refreshed and updated.  Several packages were updated, but the sound wasn't fixed and now I have the Empathy icon in the notification applet  and not the messaging applet.   Is there an easy way to fix this?
2010-11-08T07:11:00.000Z	yagoo	miststlkr	try getting alsa utils to play out samples.. if that works then the might be empathy.. sound should be heard at least with aplay
