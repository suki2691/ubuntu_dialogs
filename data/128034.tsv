2007-07-14T07:42:00.000Z	atru1		I just installed Feisty and did all the updates and every time I open Open Office, when I move the mouse over any of the buttons it crashes. Where do I start to fix this?

2007-07-14T07:46:00.000Z	atru1	ShackJack	"sudo aptitude -f install"  didn't fix it and I used synaptic to mark openoffice for reinstallation, no luck :(
