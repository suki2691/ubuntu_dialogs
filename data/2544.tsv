2012-10-04T01:17:00.000Z	morbo3000		i have a problem with flash on my ubuntu computer. i just did a clean install of 12. my son is using it for online school which requires flash. it doesn't work in either chromium or firefox. i've done all the terminal gymnastics i found online and can't make it work. including flash-fix or whatever it is called. when it goes to a page that needs flash, it just shows white where it should be. not the missing plug puzzle piece. or black.
2012-10-04T01:17:00.000Z	morbo3000		just blank. any ideas what's going on and how to fix?
