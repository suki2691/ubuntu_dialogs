2011-04-04T07:17:00.000Z	LarsN	DARKGuy	I have a 13" MacBook Pro 5.5 that work gave me.  It currently runs Ubuntu 10.10 with DWM...  so... Dubuntu?  :)
2011-04-04T07:17:00.000Z	LarsN	DARKGuy	sorry...
2011-04-04T07:18:00.000Z	DARKGuy	LarsN	Lol, yay for your mac. No worries :P
2011-04-04T07:18:00.000Z	LarsN	DARKGuy	when Kris Moore fixes PC-Sysinstall.  It'll likely run PC-BSD rather than Ubuntu.  (again with DWM)
