2009-11-14T14:46:00.000Z	ian_w		i am looking  for a web design interface, anyone knows a good one?
2009-11-14T14:47:00.000Z	Slart	ian_w	web design interface? not an application?
2009-11-14T14:48:00.000Z	Slart	ian_w	you can always try running "aplay /dev/urandom" to get some noise going.. Please check the volume first... it can be quite loud
2009-11-14T14:49:00.000Z	Slart	ian_w	you're welcome.. there are several plain html editors in the repos.. not sure which one is recommended by the people who use them (I don't do much web developing myself).. but try bluefish
