2009-08-06T15:52:00.000Z	c4pt		because i am also using xen dom0 kernel

2009-08-06T15:54:00.000Z	gartral	c4pt	umm.. I havn't messed with Xen in a very long time, but if the functionality hasn't changed any: you can't assign more because xen is designer for _SERVERS_ not PCs.. and it's impossible too use a GFX card's accelleration feature while running under Xen
