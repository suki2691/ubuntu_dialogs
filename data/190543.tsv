2006-11-16T16:05:00.000Z	livingdaylight	kud0s	huh? cntr +v pastes though
2006-11-16T16:07:00.000Z	livingdaylight	kud0s	i see so clippboard always remains invisible and crtl+v pastes it anywhere i put it
2006-11-16T16:08:00.000Z	livingdaylight	kud0s	why call it clippboard even? it more like a simple copy and paste then... i still need an application in which i can paste it
