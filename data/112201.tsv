2008-06-03T03:09:00.000Z	^root^	ArthurArchnix	who wants to do that? I am running LTS8.04, and very happy
2008-06-03T03:10:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	^root^	Ok... well, Ubuntu feels so strongly that you shouldn't enable root they actually have a policy that says whoever tells you how to enable root, needs to be available 24/7 to handle any support requests you have... because strange things can happen. Etc.. so, you can certainly find out. People have done it. But I don't think anyone will violate the CoC to tell you how.
