2012-11-28T13:32:00.000Z	RJ45-Q		I need to downgrade samba-common Ubuntu3.8 to samba-common Ubuntu3 in order to install Samba (Ubuntu 10.04), according to Synaptic it requires the removal of ubuntu-desktop, is that safe?
2012-11-28T13:33:00.000Z	RJ45-Q		would it actually remove the desktop and leave me with a command-line?, or is the package name 'ubuntu-desktop' just mis-leading?
2012-11-28T13:34:00.000Z	RJ45-Q		what is a meta package?
2012-11-28T13:35:00.000Z	somsip	RJ45-Q	a package that just contains information relating to other packages. It contains no code as such
