2007-03-24T05:58:00.000Z	seikai		Hmm.. I have the hurd 5, can I update to the BETA or is it wise just to download the beta?
2007-03-24T05:58:00.000Z	seikai		Are a lot of patches included in the beta that aren't included in hurd 5
2007-03-24T05:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	seikai	a normal upgrade should have upgraded to the beta already
2007-03-24T05:59:00.000Z	seikai	erUSUL	Hmm..
