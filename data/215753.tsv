2008-04-01T19:23:00.000Z	mjanisz		hi! id' like to install ubuntu in a few days, however with upcoming release of 8.04 i'd like to ask if it's better to install 7.10 and dist-updgrade or do the same bur with 8.04b ?
2008-04-01T19:24:00.000Z	mjanisz		so you say it's better to install 7.10 and later on dist-upgrade?
2008-04-01T19:25:00.000Z	soundray	mjanisz	is this the first time you will be installing ubuntu?
2008-04-01T19:27:00.000Z	soundray	mjanisz	it's probably best to install gutsy or beta and do a fresh install when hardy is released
