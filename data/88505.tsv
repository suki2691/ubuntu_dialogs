2008-06-27T19:56:00.000Z	samue	ASULutzy	I heard about ntfs-3g but I did't know it was "ready" ... Is it included into Ubuntu hardy already ?
2008-06-27T19:58:00.000Z	ASULutzy	samue	I don't remember if I had to apt-get it or if it just came installed... I do know that I write to NTFS drives fairly often, and haven't really had any issues in doing so
2008-06-27T20:00:00.000Z	samue	ASULutzy	ok, thanks ... does it keeps files attributes (users, rights, ...) ?
