2008-02-21T09:47:00.000Z	nrossin		Okay, for some reason everything in Ubuntu is crashing all of a sudden.  No sound, XChat crashes, Firefox crashes, Amarok and Exaile both crash...  Even restarting X hasn't solved anything.  I haven't installed anything... was just watching videos online and suddenly lost sound... Anyone know how I can fix this without rebooting?
