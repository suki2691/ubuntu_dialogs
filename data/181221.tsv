2007-02-21T08:36:00.000Z	bruenig	hellcattrav	you have the latest version that has been packaged for ubuntu
2007-02-21T08:37:00.000Z	bruenig	hellcattrav	it hasn't been packaged. oo releases in rpms, ubuntu uses debs. It takes time to repackage rpms, is there anything from the new version that you need
2007-02-21T08:38:00.000Z	bruenig	hellcattrav	you can compile the tar.gz
