2005-05-02T16:00:00.000Z	Marko01		Hi guys sorry to bug. Kind of new and really don't want to use the Word Microsoft in this chat but here it goes. Is there a way to have Identities setup in Evolution much the same as Outlook Express, where email from two seperate accounts does not go in the same Inbox.

2005-05-02T16:03:00.000Z	whnp	Marko01	, nope ... just go to tools -> filter editor inside evolution
