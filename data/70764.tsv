2009-02-23T13:38:00.000Z	glitsj16	Amendment	great, one less thing :)
2009-02-23T13:38:00.000Z	Amendment	glitsj16	true, thanks for your help. Is there any cons for running without xorg.conf?
2009-02-23T13:39:00.000Z	glitsj16	Amendment	not really no, the new Xorg uses a lot less config settings to be able to 'hotplug' any chnages in your hardware setup
