2008-05-12T12:19:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Zaiden	Why do you want to do that?
2008-05-12T12:21:00.000Z	Zaiden	RyanPrior	I was told that disabling Pulse would make voice chat work in second life.
2008-05-12T12:23:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Zaiden	I think a better question would be, how do you get Second Life to use PulseAudio?
