2010-05-08T00:11:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man		Hello all.  Could someone give me some advice on a wireless card that is likely to be Ubuntu friendly?
2010-05-08T00:12:00.000Z	thesnark	Cajun_Lan_Man	almost all of them
2010-05-08T00:12:00.000Z	thesnark	Cajun_Lan_Man	any mainstream popular card should be fine
2010-05-08T00:13:00.000Z	Cajun_Lan_Man	thesnark	Thanks guys.  I'll just grab a USB Linksys card and hope for the best.
