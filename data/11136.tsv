2011-08-03T07:03:00.000Z	somsip_	Docfxit	could you sudo rm -rf /var/log/*.gz ? If there's nothing critical likely to be in there
2011-08-03T07:13:00.000Z	somsip_	Docfxit	previous days old logs
2011-08-03T07:13:00.000Z	somsip_	Docfxit	if you know what services you're running you could be selective and just rm, say, mysql*.gz
2011-08-03T07:14:00.000Z	Docfxit	somsip_	Thanks.  I don't see why I would need any logs.  Especially old ones.
