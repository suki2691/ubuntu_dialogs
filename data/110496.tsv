2008-02-06T11:43:00.000Z	squarebracket	DrBeaverhausen	have you checked the wine database to see if there's any notes about it working/not working?
2008-02-06T11:45:00.000Z	squarebracket	DrBeaverhausen	when you say you tried clicking the icon, do you mean you tried launching it from the applications menu?
2008-02-06T11:47:00.000Z	squarebracket	DrBeaverhausen	installing fine does not mean it'll run fine, unfortunately :(
