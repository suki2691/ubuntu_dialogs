2010-04-17T09:34:00.000Z	Dr_D		ok, here's a more simple question... i need -LX11, how do i know what to apt-get with sudo based on that lib name?
2010-04-17T09:34:00.000Z	Dr_D		is there some simple thing i didn't get here?
2010-04-17T09:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Dr_D	What are you trying to compile?
2010-04-17T09:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Dr_D	A graphical hello world? Plain old hello world shouldn't require anything that doesn't come with the compiler, especially not X11.
