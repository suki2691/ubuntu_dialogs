2005-05-26T14:13:00.000Z	digip1mp		I am really liking Ubuntu
2005-05-26T14:15:00.000Z	digip1mp		I've tried gentoo, suse, fc1, fc2, fc3, debian-sarge, centos, rhel, and freebsd, and the ease of install and use on Ubuntu has been incredible.  Of course, I am trying Ubuntu last, so that may have made things a bit easier, but I'm pretty impressed.
