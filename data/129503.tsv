2007-12-31T07:21:00.000Z	B-rabbit		Is there a way to delete all the content of a file without actually going into it. For example i want to delete the content of the file "/home/B-rabbit/helloworld" but not the file itself. my way of deleting the stuff would be "pico helloworld" then press "Ctrl + k" until it all rubs off...is there any other way of doing this through the command lin?
