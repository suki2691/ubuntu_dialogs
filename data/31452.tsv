2010-05-22T07:10:00.000Z	Izinucs	goanu	go to http;//localhost:631 and use cups interface directly to see if it's installed correctly with the right driver.
2010-05-22T07:12:00.000Z	goanu	Izinucs	http;//localhost:631 takes me to the Wikipedia page for HTTP!
2010-05-22T07:19:00.000Z	goanu	Izinucs	ok, you have a ';' instead of a ':' after the 'http'.
