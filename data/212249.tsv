2008-10-04T16:06:00.000Z	ph		i'd need some help, i just did a little mistake
2008-10-04T16:07:00.000Z	ph		i wanted to test sshfs, i didn't work cause i wasn't in the groupe fuse, i tried those commands : sudo usermod -G fuse ph, sudo adduser $USER fuse, i unlogged and relogged and now i only am in the group fuse
2008-10-04T16:08:00.000Z	afief	ph	wouldn't it be easier to edit that from the users & groups interface?
