2011-02-14T08:29:00.000Z	Bendyr		Hey guys- I have a question about creating a bootable USB flash drive with the ubuntu 10.04 image from my mac.  I want to create the image on my mac, but boot my dell mini 9 with that usb drive.  I've tried following the directions on the ubuntu site at: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/netbook/get-ubuntu/download, but no matter what, it doesn't seem to be able to boot off the usb drive
