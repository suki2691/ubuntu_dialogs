2007-12-02T09:04:00.000Z	K_Dallas		Good evening! One of my major problems running exclusively ubuntu on the laptop is office2007 files.  I know crossover is capable of installing office2003 and f I am not mistaken MS offers something to make office2003 to open office2007 or something of this sort.  My Q: Would it be possble to install office2003 thru crossover office and then install that tool of MS? Thanks
