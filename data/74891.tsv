2011-03-08T22:15:00.000Z	becker_11		Hi I'm hoping someone here can point me in the direction of an article that explains how multiple commands now run side by side at boot time I can't for the life of me find it via Google
2011-03-08T22:16:00.000Z	rwat	becker_11	what are you trying to do?
2011-03-08T22:16:00.000Z	becker_11	rwat	I'm trying to explain the new faster boot system of Ubuntu to a mate who's complaining about windows
2011-03-08T22:17:00.000Z	becker_11	rwat	but I want the article to show him instead of just having my word to go on
