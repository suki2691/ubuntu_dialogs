2008-11-01T11:26:00.000Z	groceryheist		hello friendly helpers!  I just upgraded from hardy LTS to intrepid and my sound does not work.  I followed the advice given in this thread. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=205449, i purged and reinstalled everything he said to in that thread, my ubuntu desktop and gda were uninstalled as part of that but i reinstalled them and that works fine now.  Someone please help me figure out what to try next?

2008-11-01T11:26:00.000Z	groceryheist	KenzoIX	i doubt that is possible
2008-11-01T11:27:00.000Z	outbri	groceryheist	and I myself don't know the answer, mine didn't work but I have two sound sources, so I just use the one that works.
