2006-01-03T15:27:00.000Z	DonVinzk		Hi, I will buy a new PC, and so I have a few questions about ubuntu. First of all: if I buy an amd_64, I will download the required distribution. But will I find all the packages available for my architecture ? Or the most important is to have the kernel compiled for the 64 and then the package themselves can be taken compiled for x86 ?
