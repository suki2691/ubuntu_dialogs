2009-01-03T02:31:00.000Z	a1fa		Hey, I have a PIII 500Mhz with 256mb ram (non-upgradable) -- DELL Latitude LS; is there anything else I can do to improve performance? Maybe SSD hard-drive?
2009-01-03T02:32:00.000Z	jim_p	a1fa	install xubuntu, or go for a minimal install of ubuntu + lxde, or try a less bloated approach like debian
2009-01-03T02:33:00.000Z	a1fa	jim_p	i am running xubuntu
2009-01-03T02:34:00.000Z	jim_p	a1fa	then dont buy an ssd. try a debian minimal + lxde. it boots on my vbox with 512 of ram in 30-40 seconds
