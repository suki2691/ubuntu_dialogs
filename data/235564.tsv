2006-08-08T12:26:00.000Z	khughes		how do I search for other channels on this server through xchat?
2006-08-08T12:26:00.000Z	Madpilot	khughes	real XChat or xchat-gnome
2006-08-08T12:28:00.000Z	Madpilot	khughes	the interfaces for the two are quite different - in real XChat, channel list is at Window->Channel List. I've no idea where that abortion known as xchat-gnome hides it
