2005-09-14T08:42:00.000Z	Artxe		I have installed LimeWire and it needs Java so I downloaded the latest version of Java and unpacked it and I now have the j2sdk1.4.2_09 file. Well LimeWire looks for Java in the /usr folder so I put j2sdk1.4.2_09 in there and when I "sh ./runeLime.sh" it says it can't find Java.
