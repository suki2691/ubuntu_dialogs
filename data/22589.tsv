2012-01-19T04:39:00.000Z	oldIT781	Myrtti	Thanks! I just switched from a nvidia card to an ATI card. I used to add a line that inverted my screen.

2012-01-20T01:53:00.000Z	oldIT781	Myrtti	its not working. I am running inverted. but in some of the games instead of actually running inverted like they should they are running correct side up.
