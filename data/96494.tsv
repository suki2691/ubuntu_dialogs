2008-12-08T04:16:00.000Z	talexb		Hmm .. checking http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=386385 but it seems the Novell download for DOCX doesn't exist on the Novell site any more.
2008-12-08T04:17:00.000Z	talexb		Anyone suggest an alternative? I have a DOCX file that I want to be a DOC file.
2008-12-08T04:18:00.000Z	bobbyd	talexb	OpenOffice can open DOCx and save DOC
2008-12-08T04:19:00.000Z	talexb	bobbyd	Oh .. I have 2.4 .. will that do?
