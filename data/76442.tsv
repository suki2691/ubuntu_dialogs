2010-09-12T21:15:00.000Z	adnc	DJones	i use motion for detecting movement, thank you very much for the tipp. motion is great. but i would like to have a simple standalone application that i can move to a corner of my display, like gmotionlive, unfortunately this is a bad application it crashes all the time
2010-09-12T21:15:00.000Z	DJones	adnc	Ok, no worries, I've only ever used motion, so can't suggest anything else
