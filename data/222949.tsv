2005-09-03T08:32:00.000Z	Rayen		Hi, I was wondering, which release I need for Ubuntu on my P4 2.6GHz for desktop/gaming use?
2005-09-03T08:33:00.000Z	DjKritical	Rayen	You always download the newest relase (they come out every few months).... it's supported for 18 months or something... The most recent is Hoary Hedgehog (Ubuntu version 5.04)
2005-09-03T08:34:00.000Z	Rayen	DjKritical	hmm, how old is Hoary 5.04 ?
2005-09-03T08:35:00.000Z	DjKritical	Rayen	well.. a new version is coming out in October.. and I think a new one comes out every 6 months... so 4 months old
