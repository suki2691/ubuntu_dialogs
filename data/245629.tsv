2006-09-01T11:38:00.000Z	swuboo		I have a question about which kernel I should be using as available on synaptic.
2006-09-01T11:39:00.000Z	cwillu	swuboo	what type of cpu?
2006-09-01T11:41:00.000Z	cwillu	swuboo	there's not really a huge performance difference by using a slightly wrong kernel (assuming it works).  Using the 686 kernel will make your life easier if you need to use proprietary stuff
