2007-05-25T16:10:00.000Z	logixoul		Hello. I installed the Typo3 CMS from debs. It has several folders in /usr/share now. One of them is the testsite one. I wanna run (view) it. It's in PHP. Should I move this testsite to Apache's dir and view it through http://localhost/?

2007-05-25T16:11:00.000Z	logixoul	TimGroe	ok, thanks :) . Seemed a little weird for me to do, as most normal packages seem to end up where they do for a reason, and not just for me to move around randomly. :)
