2009-03-20T18:21:00.000Z	mustangg1		hello. How might I check to see which version of an app is present in the repos?
2009-03-20T18:22:00.000Z	sipior	mustangg1	apt-cache policy <package>
2009-03-20T18:26:00.000Z	mustangg1	sipior	Thanks. btw- aren't packages which I can get using apt _supposed_ to show up in the gui add/remove ?
2009-03-20T18:27:00.000Z	sipior	mustangg1	i don't think add/remove has a complete listing of packages
