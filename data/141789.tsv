2012-01-04T08:55:00.000Z	Ford_P		Hello need assistance. My sound all of a sudden stopped working.
2012-01-04T08:55:00.000Z	Safe_	Ford_P	I recently had some problems with my audio, what is your specific problem?
2012-01-04T08:56:00.000Z	Safe_	Ford_P	have you checked the simple things, as in alsamixer etc?
2012-01-04T08:57:00.000Z	Safe_	Ford_P	My problem was embarrasingly simple, it had switched to hdmi, went into alsamixer, muted hdmi, changed soundcard and muted s/pdif and then it worked.
