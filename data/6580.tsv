2012-01-07T01:11:00.000Z	guest009		why doesn't ubuntu ship with gnash? is there any reason?
2012-01-07T01:11:00.000Z	zipace	guest009	because it's very unstable and doesn't support actionscript3 (which became defacto standard)
2012-01-07T01:14:00.000Z	zipace	guest009	well, video streaming is pretty basic, so it's not surprising that gnash supports it
2012-01-07T01:32:00.000Z	zipace	guest009	you're not making much sense
