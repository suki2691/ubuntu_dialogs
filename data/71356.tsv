2009-01-04T04:23:00.000Z	kestutis		I got a problem. I am trying to install Lithuanian-English dictionary, which is made for Windows. When i use Wine, and try to install, i need to enter a licence key. When i do in on Windows, it's ok, but on ubuntu it's shows the key is invalid
2009-01-04T04:24:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	kestutis	did you have to register the application to get the key? it may be machine dependent and wine is probably looking different than a native windoze
2009-01-04T04:25:00.000Z	kestutis	zsquareplusc	I just have to enter the key while installing the application.
2009-01-04T04:29:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	kestutis	the key is not made specific for you? maybe the wine install isn't looking "good enough" to that application. an other option would be installing the application in a virtual PC like virtualbox (but you need a windoze lincense). alternatively see if there's a linux version a compatible application
