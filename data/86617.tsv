2008-07-18T11:32:00.000Z	sniff	pbp	apt-get first downloads all and _then_ installs
2008-07-18T11:33:00.000Z	pbp	sniff	but i want to know all the dependencies so tha it can be downloaded separately and installed
2008-07-18T11:34:00.000Z	sniff	pbp	ah yes now i see. but doesn't dpkg command list the dependencies when you try to install a package file?
