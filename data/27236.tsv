2010-08-19T17:49:00.000Z	_F-117	psycho	where does packet captures come into play
2010-08-19T17:52:00.000Z	psycho	_F-117	I used packet capturing to see if the computer was able to hear the xbox 360.  When the xbox tries to test the network connection, it sends these packets: DHCP, "who has 169.254.251.80?", ARP Requests/Reply, NOTIFY HTTP/1.1....all being totally useless because the computer does not respond to the xbox.
