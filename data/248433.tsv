2008-02-20T07:40:00.000Z	steven__		hi, i'd like ubuntu and vista and xp on the same disk. I've set my disks to use ext3 and I can not get them working with ntfs or fat32 again. I tried gparted in ubuntu and from a live cd but that didn't work. Any ideas?
2008-02-20T07:41:00.000Z	bascule	steven__	delete and recreate them in xp disc thingy
2008-02-20T07:46:00.000Z	steven__	bascule	shall I delete the partitions in gparted and recreate them in xp disc thingy. Because when I try deleting/recreating in xp disc thingy it won't let me.
