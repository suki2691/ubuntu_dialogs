2009-05-08T09:22:00.000Z	luddite		hi in 9.04 when i do modprobe acerhdf (or any modprobe) i get a series of errors like "WARNING: All config files need .conf: /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist, it will be ignored in a future release." AND "FATAL: Error inserting acerhdf (/lib/modules/2.6.28-11-generic/kernel/drivers/misc/acerhdf.ko): Operation not permitted" why?
2009-05-08T09:22:00.000Z	h00k	luddite	try running that as root (put a sudo in front of it)
2009-05-08T09:23:00.000Z	luddite	h00k	: i tried that same fatal error.
