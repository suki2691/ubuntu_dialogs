2008-06-04T15:54:00.000Z	Mets	koshari	I think so yes, right now the virtual machine shares with the host
2008-06-04T15:55:00.000Z	koshari	Mets	yes that would be correct , i would assume the ethernet port is bridged to both the host and client
2008-06-04T15:56:00.000Z	Mets	koshari	right, how do I change it so that the VM has its own IP?
