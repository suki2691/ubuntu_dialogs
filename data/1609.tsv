2012-09-27T20:37:00.000Z	jrib	VlanX	you should just ask your question; and I'd suggest also including why you are using expect (i.e. what you actually want to accomplish)
2012-09-27T20:38:00.000Z	VlanX	jrib	i've made a script with expect to retrieve the content of a router's configuration via SSH, but now i'd like to store the output on a file
