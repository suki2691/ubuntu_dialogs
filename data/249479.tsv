2005-02-13T17:54:00.000Z	rellik		is there a printcommand like "lpr" that will put a header (page number/date/etc) on the printout?  I've tried 'lpr -p' but lpr seems to be just ignoring the '-p' flag :
2005-02-13T13:51:00.000Z	rellik		heh guys this is an *ubuntu* chat room...  ppl that wanna recompile their kernel for every change instead of just using modules should just use debian
2005-02-13T13:52:00.000Z	troll_god	rellik	wow that comment made no sense at all!!! debian has such advantages for those that want to recompile their kernel for every change that little kids like yourself should suggest it over ubuntu in favor of the huge differences in relation to kernel-compiling!!!
2005-02-13T13:53:00.000Z	troll_god	rellik	After all ubuntu does't have all of those tools that make debian so usefull for kernel compiling! right?
