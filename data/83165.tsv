2008-08-08T16:01:00.000Z	Hellixir		Hi, i'm writting something in crontab and i dont know why dont start, my line is  : 49 8-19/1 * * * /home/seb/./script.sh
2008-08-08T16:01:00.000Z	Hellixir		, it's correct ?
2008-08-08T16:03:00.000Z	TiredWolf	Hellixir	i don't understand why you put that /./ there, but yeah, it looks like it would work in theory... is the script executable?
2008-08-08T16:04:00.000Z	Hellixir	TiredWolf	yes my script is executable, i write /./ to execute my script, no?
