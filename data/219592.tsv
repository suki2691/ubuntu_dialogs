I can't write to a FAT32 partition that I mounted - I edited my /etc/fstab file (after backing it up) following some Ubuntu directions (somewhere near the top of the google search results..) I got it mounted successfully - Under "Filesystems" its listed as "Windows", but it errors out with "Error 'Read-only file system' creating new folder" when I try to make a new folder to store some dwnloaded drivers
