2006-03-18T13:57:00.000Z	kditty		i have a question here, pretty important, i did a few things, changed some settings to enable wireless WEP, then i updated linux with the recommended updates, well when i restarted my comp i cant connect to my wireless network at all
2006-03-18T13:58:00.000Z	kditty		im wondering if i use the breezy install cd, can i set it back to normal default, without losing my programs, and without doing a full install?
