2009-03-12T17:41:00.000Z	cornell_w		I've installed Ibex.  It is common for various processes, daemons, whatever to send notification emails as necessary.  Are there configurations that I have to do to sendmail (exim) for the email to get out, or is there an operable configuration already setup?

2009-03-12T17:44:00.000Z	Slart	cornell_w	something like that.. but probably by editing some obscure text file somewhere.. I don't know the specifics but I think it's the same stuff you have to do if you just want to run your own mail server
