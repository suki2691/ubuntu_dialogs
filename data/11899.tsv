2011-12-02T04:53:00.000Z	yaaase		Hey #ubuntu.  I am running ubuntu 11.04 with Xmonad on a new HP Pavilion g4 laptop.  I was previously running the identical setup on an old Acer laptop (both AMD 64 procs; the current one is dual-core)... old box never crashed the whole time I had it.  This one will lock up (screen goes black, only responds to hard reboot) randomly.  CPU/RAM load is never high.
2011-12-02T04:54:00.000Z	yaaase		Just wondering if anyone had thoughts on 1) how I can trace the problem and 2) if anyone else experienced similar things on HP laptops

2011-12-02T04:55:00.000Z	yaaase	reisio	no, but I fresh installed ubuntu 11.04 from the same disk, and installed xmonad identically
