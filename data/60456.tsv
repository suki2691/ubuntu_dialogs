2009-10-31T08:42:00.000Z	holstein		got on issue with zynaddsubfx... 'zombified - calling shutdown handler' when changeing patches.. outputs disappear from JACK

2009-10-31T08:46:00.000Z	holstein		give it a try though justfil.. image it with clonezilla or something.. cant hurt anything, just dont depend on it to be your backup
2009-10-31T08:46:00.000Z	justfil	holstein	what I meant is to be able to use it and make changes that will stay in the actual install
