2012-07-09T07:05:00.000Z	zykotick9	Ctm54	if you're getting "not managed" it's because the device has settings in /etc/network/interfaces (remove that and reboot or ifdown/ifup)
2012-07-09T07:05:00.000Z	Ctm54	zykotick9	no it's managed now it just can't connect and now nothing is coming up in my routing table
2012-07-09T07:06:00.000Z	zykotick9	Ctm54	ok sorry (my bad).  i have no suggestions...
