2011-01-20T04:25:00.000Z	MC8		Howdy; I'm trying to run 10.10 64-bit from a CD onto my Inspiron 1525 laptop; I'm getting a crash to command line after that purple screen, with the error: "(initramfs) mount: mounting /dev/loop0 on //filesystem.squashfs failed: No such device
2011-01-20T04:25:00.000Z	MC8		Can not mount /dev/loop0 (/cdrom/casper/filesystem.squashfs) on //filesystem.squashfs"
2011-01-20T04:25:00.000Z	jrib	MC8	first thing to do is run "check the cd for defects"
2011-01-20T04:26:00.000Z	jrib	MC8	not necessarily...
