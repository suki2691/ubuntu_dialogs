2007-10-16T09:29:00.000Z	MasterShrek	kyleBAKED	where would you like to back it up to?
2007-10-16T09:41:00.000Z	MasterShrek	kyleBAKED	usermod --help
2007-10-16T09:42:00.000Z	MasterShrek	kyleBAKED	yes, but if you just mount it as /home/user that would probably work easier, you jsut have to make sure the permissions are correct
