2005-06-22T13:49:00.000Z	Veinor		It says it's 'Testing Network repository...' and has been doing so for the past 10 minutes or so
2005-06-22T13:49:00.000Z	HappyFool	Veinor	how are you doing the install? From CD?
2005-06-22T13:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	Veinor	try unplugging your network connection, and rebooting?
