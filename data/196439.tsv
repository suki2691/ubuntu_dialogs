2009-01-18T05:24:00.000Z	dr_Willis	donavan_	  the alt- key here moves the windows.. not ctrl.
2009-01-18T05:25:00.000Z	donavan_	Dr_willis	that may be so  but on my system the ctrl key is doing it
2009-01-18T05:27:00.000Z	dr_Willis	donavan_	  i would guess off hand that if you are using compiz, its some how reversed the keys. or something else has reversed the ctrl and alt keys.
