2009-02-11T16:26:00.000Z	Jonathan_L		I still haven't gotten any response about linux-indipendent APT client. I just want something that can download packages with all their dependencies so that I don't have to browse a bunch of Web 0.0.0.1 pages that lists files
2009-02-11T16:26:00.000Z	rww	Jonathan_L	I don't know of a client that does that. Last time I needed to download Ubuntu packages in Windows I ended up getting them from http://packages.ubuntu.com/
2009-02-11T16:27:00.000Z	Jonathan_L	rww	Do'h! Can't somebody try to create a windows client for APT? :'(
2009-02-11T16:27:00.000Z	rww	Jonathan_L	You're welcome to take a shot :)
