2012-02-13T22:54:00.000Z	cipher__		One other question.. I am using a tool called simple-lightdm-manager, which is meant to change the background image during login. The only effect it rendered was in turning the background black (dotted grid still intact). Anyway I was wondering if anyone knows how to change the background image manually?
