2010-10-06T14:40:00.000Z	Babbla		I have two identical machines. One is running ubuntu-server and the other is running ubuntu-desktop.  I am copying files from one location on the server to another on the server.  Likewise I am copying files from one location on the desktop to another location on the desktop.  The desktop is being drastically outperformed.  What might be causing the desktop to copy so much slower?
2010-10-06T14:41:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Babbla	do you copy to different partitions?
2010-10-06T14:42:00.000Z	Babbla	Benkinooby	good point... the server is copying form one drive to another whereas the desktop is copying to the same drive
2010-10-06T14:42:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Babbla	this sound allready like a good explaination. don't you think?
