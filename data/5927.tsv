2012-08-14T14:54:00.000Z	IronMan2		hey guys, I had problems w/ ATI proprietary drivers a while back (radeon 5850, dual monitors). The drivers completely screwed up everything (disabled one monitor, called the  other one "laptop"). I re-installed Ubuntu, should I just not install any drivers?...

2012-08-14T14:56:00.000Z	cfhowlett	IronMan2	graphic drivers or what?
2012-08-14T14:57:00.000Z	cfhowlett	IronMan2	if you've got graphics without props I'd say skip 'em.  IMO + YMMV
