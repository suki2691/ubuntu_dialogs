2008-02-08T06:34:00.000Z	desertc	Sunman	why can you not boot from a liveCD ?
2008-02-08T06:34:00.000Z	Sunman	desertc	I have no idea. it loads for a while and then just gives me a blinking cursor
2008-02-08T06:35:00.000Z	desertc	Sunman	then it is most likely a hardware issue, since the liveCD does not touch your hard drive installation
