2006-12-20T11:26:00.000Z	magic_ninja	Geoffrey2	its nowhere near as fast though
2006-12-20T11:31:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	magic_ninja	my biggest problem is that my wireless doesn't like to play nice with Ubuntu...if I decided to run Ubuntu under Windows, I could, I believe, use the native windows drivers for the wireless, which I would hope would take care of the problem
2006-12-20T11:31:00.000Z	magic_ninja	Geoffrey2	i'm going to set up a wireless network for my laptop but i don't have $$$ for parts
