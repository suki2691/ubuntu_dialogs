2006-06-09T09:38:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		I'm trying to copy the mboxes over from the Windows version of Thunderbird to the Ubuntu version, but I can't remember which mbox goes with which email account...I was wondering if there was any file in the profile that would tell me that....I realize it's not exactly an Ubuntu question, but the folks on Mozilla.org are largely lurking and saying nothing

2006-06-09T09:41:00.000Z	hyphenated	Geoffrey2	well, the alternative is to try and interpret the "prefs.js" file yourself ;-)
