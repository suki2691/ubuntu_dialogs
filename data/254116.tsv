2005-04-30T08:14:00.000Z	aracataca		hi to everybodey, I need the command for updating openoffice to the 2.0-version. maybe you could name it briefly. many thanks.
2005-04-30T08:14:00.000Z	scizzo	aracataca	2.0 is still in development from what I know
2005-04-30T08:15:00.000Z	aracataca	scizzo	thats corrects, but still worth trying, i was told
2005-04-30T08:17:00.000Z	aracataca	scizzo	but openoffice being beta, that means that i can't get it through apt-get yet, through the universe?
