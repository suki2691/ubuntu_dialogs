2012-03-20T13:19:00.000Z	ahaha		Hello again. How to unistall Xubuntu 10.04.2 64bit, I'm dual booting my linux with windows. I can't find xubuntu folder in partition where it's installed (browsing from windows), it's taking space, but even formatting that partition still keeps the linux in there.
2012-03-20T13:21:00.000Z	ahaha		anyway, how am I supposed to unistall that distro?
2012-03-20T13:22:00.000Z	worm	ahaha	Can you find Linux partition by right click on "Computer" and click on System Management and use the "Disk management section?"
2012-03-20T13:25:00.000Z	worm	ahaha	If you can find the partition there, then you can delete those partitions or format them. But to do so you need to uninstall grub first.
