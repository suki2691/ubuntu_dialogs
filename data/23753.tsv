2011-02-05T05:42:00.000Z	knoppies		I used to use compiz to draw my desktop wallpapers, I am using 10.10 64bit and it seems as though if I turn nautilus draw desktop off, nothing draws the desktop wallpaper. Does anybody know how to have a different wallpaper for each virtual desktop (in the compiz wall)?
