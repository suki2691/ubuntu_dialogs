2009-05-31T17:27:00.000Z	Zappza		Does anybody here have any experience or knowledge about driver compiling?
2009-05-31T17:27:00.000Z	Kalmi	Zappza	why do you need to compile drivers?
2009-05-31T17:34:00.000Z	Zappza	Kalmi	- Because I need to use a wireless usb stick, and the drivers (rt2870) aren't supported.
