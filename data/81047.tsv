2010-12-16T16:46:00.000Z	NetGrunt		I would like to ask you a question, it's not specific to any Ubuntu version, but rather to Ubuntu itself : I have a hard disk drive in one server, and I want to know if it is connected straight to one of the SATA ports on the motherboard, or to a RAID PCI board that it also has. How could I do it ?
