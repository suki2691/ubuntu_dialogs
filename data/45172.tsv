2010-09-03T10:09:00.000Z	mouse	thune3	Yeah on most of the newer bios it's the esc key.  I tried that first and when it looks like it's about to go into the bios it just reboots the computer and you're back at the bios again.

2010-09-03T10:11:00.000Z	thune3	mouse	i can't think of any other way, if you know model and/or motherboard maybe you could find that another key gives boot menu. sry or ^^^
