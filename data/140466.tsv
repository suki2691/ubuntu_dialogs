2007-05-16T14:25:00.000Z	Nubbie	Ayabara	none of them are officially recommended, as they aren't in main repositories.
2007-05-16T14:26:00.000Z	Ayabara	Nubbie	ok. I wondered why they had disappeared from ubuntuguide.org. any other clients to use besides torrenting?
2007-05-16T14:27:00.000Z	Nubbie	Ayabara	you can use them, they just aren't recommended by ubuntu.
