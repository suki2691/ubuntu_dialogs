2007-06-30T06:28:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey		pelo, do you know of any other way to fix the xorg issues I'm having with my comp?
2007-06-30T06:30:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey		Thanks for that, but I was searching google and I saw something about someone who has the same comp being able to install with the alternate CD, but wasn't able to run it
2007-06-30T06:30:00.000Z	ponicg	d4rkmonkey	what system?
