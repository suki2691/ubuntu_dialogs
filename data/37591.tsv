2010-02-09T00:02:00.000Z	asdff		I can no longer hear sound in Ubuntu Karmic, and my gnome-volume-control applet is no longer appearing. Any suggestions?
2010-02-09T00:03:00.000Z	Skuld_kid	asdff	 is there a blank space in your 'taskbar' where the speaker icon should be?
2010-02-09T00:03:00.000Z	asdff	Skuld_kid	nah it is completely gone :(
2010-02-09T00:04:00.000Z	asdff	Skuld_kid	moreover I cannot re-add the volume controll applet
