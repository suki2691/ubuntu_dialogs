2006-08-06T13:05:00.000Z	gnomefreak	andresmujica	not at all but that would depend on sys. specs and what version of ubuntu and what desktop env. anong other things
2006-08-06T13:08:00.000Z	andresmujica	gnomefreak	well, i feel it slow, and i`m using it at several places... have followed some tips to improve it speed (prelink, swappines, preload -at least the one on apt- and some other i cannot remember right now, but it feels somekind slugish. Anyone has done serious benchmarks between SuSE and Ubuntu? or Anyone knows how can i do them?
