2010-05-05T07:16:00.000Z	kerog1		Hey, I'm in the process of installing Lucid Lynx, I booted into the CD and tried to resize an NTFS partition, I hit apply, and now it says 'resizing partition...' with progress bar at 0% for about 10 minutes now. Ideas?
2010-05-05T07:17:00.000Z	mezquitale	kerog1	did you back up your files ?
