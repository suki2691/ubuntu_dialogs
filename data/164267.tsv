2008-06-30T00:09:00.000Z	Eegah1		I can't seem to get DNS under Hardy, and network-admin doesn't work.  Any settings I put in just disappear as soon as I close it.  /etc/resolv.conf exists, but it's a directory.  I'm not entirely sure what to do.
2008-06-30T00:10:00.000Z	Eegah1		Is there any command that will automagically generate a new resolv.conf, perhaps?
2008-06-30T00:11:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Eegah1	start/stopping dhcp will do that
2008-06-30T00:15:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Eegah1	you said /etc/resolv.conf was a directly, is there anything in the directory?
