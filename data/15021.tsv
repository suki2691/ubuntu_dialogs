2011-05-03T14:28:00.000Z	kaie		I have an internal disk, and an external backup disk (cloned with dd). I must restore one lvm logical volume. When having both disks connected, lvm says, it detects a duplicate, only allows one of them to be active. Is there a trick to rename one of them, so I can have both volume groups / logical volumes active at the same time?
