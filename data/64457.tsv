2009-03-05T02:16:00.000Z	mehuman		I just built a digital photo frame running ubuntu and am looking for a way to display pictures, weather, and news. Any suggestions?
2009-03-05T02:16:00.000Z	nigtv	mehuman	maybe use an rss feed? if you can build one that should work...
2009-03-05T02:18:00.000Z	mehuman	nigtv	I was looking at using screenlets but would like it full screen. I was seeing if there was already a script that did it. Maybe using gd?
2009-03-05T02:18:00.000Z	nigtv	mehuman	no clue, never done something like that, i use snownews, but im only in console not x, so im not sure
