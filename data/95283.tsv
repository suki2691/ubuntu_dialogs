2008-04-07T04:28:00.000Z	mariobro		when I try to run Envy, I get the message "Error:  Dependency is not satisfiable: debhelper"  What does this mean?
2008-04-07T04:29:00.000Z	pschorf2	mariobro	have you tried to apt-get debhelper?
2008-04-07T04:29:00.000Z	pschorf2	mariobro	run sudo apt-get install debhelper
2008-04-07T04:35:00.000Z	pschorf2	mariobro	try running sudo apt-get update
