2007-07-26T08:50:00.000Z	ubuntu1098765432		To anyone whom knows- I'm a new ubuntu user, my system has crashed twice b/c of faulty docs, sites, and suggestions- HERE is my challenge to any    moderator/someone who is extremely comp. literate.  ALL I want is to get a better resolution LIKE the one I had on windows-which was above 1240X768?  Below are my specs....

2007-07-26T08:54:00.000Z	ubuntu1098765432		I have a laptop, wider screen, radeon 9600, administration>restricted drivers> ATI accelerated driver::: Did not enable b/c when I did previously I still can't get above 1240X768:: Here is what crashed my system... Editing again the xorg.config and replacing the resolution ALL to 19200, etc down the line with depth of 24
