2009-02-17T12:29:00.000Z	cloud-nist		I am using 8.10 and it seems like every two or 3 days if I leave music playing my audio makes this horrible noise that does not go away until I reboot. Does anyone know a fix?
2009-02-17T12:31:00.000Z	sumpygump	cloud-nist	is it audio streaming over the network, or local files?
2009-02-17T12:31:00.000Z	cloud-nist	sumpygump	Local mp3 files....
2009-02-17T12:32:00.000Z	cloud-nist	sumpygump	the noise it makes is like my audio gets STUCK and stays that way till I reboot the machine.
