2009-06-17T08:23:00.000Z	frenzy42	n00dle	yea, i'v cleaned the list out, where should i look though
2009-06-17T08:24:00.000Z	n00dle	frenzy42	the places I'd check are the "Edit wireless networks..." dialog on the network manager (right-click)
2009-06-17T08:25:00.000Z	n00dle	frenzy42	I'd also look in gconf-editor to see if there's stuff hanging out there, but I don't have 9.04, and things move around a lot between versions.
