2006-05-27T15:49:00.000Z	biovore	Mortal`	you can try a dpkg-reconfigure apache
2006-05-27T15:49:00.000Z	Mortal`	biovore	nope, that doesn't change the .conf's
2006-05-27T15:54:00.000Z	biovore	Mortal`	I think you just screwed.. This is why you always make backups of your configuration files ;-P  (lesson learn the hardway I guess)
