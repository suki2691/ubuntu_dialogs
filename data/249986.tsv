2012-05-08T21:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bakkerthehacker	 from what ive seen in here.. lots of bad experiences with it.
2012-05-08T21:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bakkerthehacker	 the only thing i know about bumble/optimus - is that i plan on making sure my next laptop does NOT use it..
2012-05-08T21:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bakkerthehacker	 no idea. I just see a dozen people in here weekly (or more) with issues with it.
