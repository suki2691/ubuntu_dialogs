2007-02-02T07:30:00.000Z	digitize		For some odd reason amarok completely broke after crashing, I can no longer run it. So naturally I proceded to reinstalling it, only to find a problem. In order to reinstall it, I have to remove kubuntu desktop as well, something I do not want to do just to fix amarok. Any suggestions as to fixing this are greatly appreciated.

2007-02-02T07:31:00.000Z	cablesm102	digitize	delete the config files from wherever they are
