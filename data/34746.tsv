2010-05-12T15:20:00.000Z	six6six		if i have an existing installation of open office.. and decided to install and compile the more updated source from open office.,. would it replace my old copy of open office ?
2010-05-12T15:20:00.000Z	six6six		or would it be better for me to uninstall open office then install from source
