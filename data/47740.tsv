2010-04-07T11:05:00.000Z	bane-o		have a quick question, new to the ubuntu scene, using 10.04. just installed xchat using "sudo apt-get install xchat". how do I get xchat to connect to the following server: irc://irc.irchighway.net/lurk     ?
2010-04-07T11:05:00.000Z	theadmin	bane-o	Well, lucid support in #ubuntu+1, but basically, add a server "irc.irchighway.net" to the list and join channel #lurk
