2010-09-19T21:50:00.000Z	aknagi		Hi guys. I'm installing my OS, and I have two 320GB disks, but gparted shows them as 298.09 GiB
2010-09-19T21:50:00.000Z	aknagi		anyone know why?
2010-09-19T21:50:00.000Z	sriramoman	aknagi	thats coz of GB to GiB units conversion
2010-09-19T21:54:00.000Z	sriramoman	aknagi	i can give u the calculation how u get 298. its pure mathematics and not any sector reservation/crap
