2011-05-29T07:29:00.000Z	improveupon		hello my gui keeps crashing when i return from suspend if a flash video was playing in firefox. you have to go to a vt and reboot. sound keeps coming through (and cannot be stopped). the mouse pointer moves but nothing else.
2011-05-29T07:30:00.000Z	improveupon		is it xorg that has crashed? what else could i try from vt1?

2011-05-29T07:32:00.000Z	smw	improveupon	if you ever fix it. let me know ;-)
