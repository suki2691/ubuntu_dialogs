2006-08-05T16:04:00.000Z	m4rk		how do I get gnome network manager to manage my wifi connection?
2006-08-05T16:05:00.000Z	m4rk		it just says "No network connection", meanwhile I have eth1 going through some other network manager
2006-08-05T10:08:00.000Z	m4rk		is there any way to hide windows from appearing in the gnome window list
