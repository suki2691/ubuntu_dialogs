2005-05-28T15:42:00.000Z	jrhodes		now I feel a bit idiotic asking this, but let's assume I have a few different window managers already installed on the system. how would I add them to the GDM menu? /etc/X11/Sessions doesn't exist and that's how it would be done on a normal system so I'm at a bit of a loss
2005-05-28T15:43:00.000Z	justin	jrhodes	what did you do to make them not already in the menu?
2005-05-28T15:44:00.000Z	justin	jrhodes	why not look at what files another window manager installs and see how it gets added to the menu?
