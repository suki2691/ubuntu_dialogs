2010-07-16T10:45:00.000Z	sprung		Hi, I want to fix the notorious problem where when using Archive Mounter to mount an iso file, all files have a ";1" following the last character of the filename, rendering the volume unusable. Very annoying. I see there are lots of THREADS on ubuntu support forums, but not all that many possible solutions, and a lot of frustration from the posters. Any help getting the correct resolution for this problem?
