2011-09-06T19:46:00.000Z	wynn		I have seen a lot of network traffic across my wifi interface in the last week and think my 10.10 install might have been infected/compromised. Is there a way to check this?
2011-09-06T19:47:00.000Z	wynn		I know, but I can't account for why the spike in network traffic across my wifi interface... any ideas?
