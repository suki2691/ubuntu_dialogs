2007-04-26T11:57:00.000Z	ben__	zerokill88	to view the full record for a package use `apt-cache show <package-name>`. Is that what you're looking for?
2007-04-26T12:00:00.000Z	ben__	zerokill88	grep through `apt-cache dump` then? It depends on what you're looking for. :-)
2007-04-26T12:06:00.000Z	ben__	zerokill88	I'm not aware of a more comprehensive view that what `apt-cache dump` gives you, I'm afraid.
