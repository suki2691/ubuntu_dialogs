2010-08-28T18:22:00.000Z	fruitbag`		My RAID configuration is recognised and everything, but when trying to access it, I am told that it cannot be mounted. Why?
2010-08-28T18:22:00.000Z	cast	fruitbag`	so mount /dev/md0 /mnt/tmp/ fails with what error?
2010-08-28T18:23:00.000Z	fruitbag`	cast	the RAID shows up
