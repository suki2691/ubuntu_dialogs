2009-08-19T08:51:00.000Z	david_		Help. I am trying to format my computer with DBAN and start fresh.  GRUB loads up before the bootdisk is noticed.  What can I do to format entirely?

2009-08-19T08:52:00.000Z	gwildor	david_	but if you are just 'starting fresh' you dont need dban, and installer cd will do what you need
2009-08-19T08:53:00.000Z	gwildor	david_	esc, f1, f2, f11, f12... try them all, just run your finger across the whole top row
