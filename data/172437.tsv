2006-08-07T13:30:00.000Z	cowmilk		i'm going to be installing a CD-RW drive and a DVD drive into my box. Aside from checking out the jumper setting for Master or Slave, is there anything else I have to do to install?
2006-08-07T13:30:00.000Z	cowmilk		Do I have to some setting up in Ubuntu? Or will they automatically work?
