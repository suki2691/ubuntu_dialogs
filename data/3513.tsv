2012-05-03T15:41:00.000Z	afd	blurp	really? it's not like the data / apps being accessed when keyrings are used is encrypted or something? you aren't deleting encryption keys...?

They may leave a few undeleted text files behind somewhere that were saved, but I'd bet that removing something that stores info locally would remove the info it stored, too, in most cases.
