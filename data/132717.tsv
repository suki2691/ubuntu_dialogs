2009-06-08T03:06:00.000Z	click		Afternoon - I'm poking around with trying to get paravirtualization (with kvm/qemu) working on Ubuntu 9.04 on an amd64 arch, installed from a standard live cd, however it does not seem to allow it. I've added the users to the libvirtd group as to allow them to manage virtualized machines, but there's no ability to select paravirtualized when using virt-manager - any ideas what this may be due to?
