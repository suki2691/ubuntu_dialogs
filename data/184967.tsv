2007-01-14T10:42:00.000Z	kitche	linux_newbie2	make sure that gdm is not started on boot
2007-01-14T10:42:00.000Z	linux_newbie2	kitche	how do I change what is started on boot?
2007-01-14T10:43:00.000Z	kitche	linux_newbie2	I do stuff by hand but update-rc.d is probably easier for you think that's the name of the tool
