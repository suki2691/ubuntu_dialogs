2009-04-22T02:40:00.000Z	phoenixz		I need a new server for a project of mine in the company here and we're on the brink of either buying a new one or try to use a freed SUN T2000 server.. Since this is a completely different platform, well, could anybody tell me if Ubuntu would run on that without too much problems? Could I install ALL basic ubuntu packages?

2009-04-22T02:41:00.000Z	phoenixz	cizra	pepperjack: yeah, its a sparc machine
2009-04-22T02:41:00.000Z	cizra	phoenixz	Then it's somewhat dubious. See the supported arch page.
