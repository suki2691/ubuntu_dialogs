2011-10-12T20:57:00.000Z	Polah	panfist	/etc/apt/sources.list.d contains files for each installed/enabled PPA, there may be a command with apt to list them though
2011-10-12T20:58:00.000Z	Polah	panfist	Of course, if you added them manually they'll be in /etc/apt/sources.list
2011-10-12T20:58:00.000Z	Polah	panfist	You can use ppa-purge to remove/revert packages installed from PPAs
