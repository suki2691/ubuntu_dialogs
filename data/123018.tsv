2007-09-02T05:49:00.000Z	dug_	rummik	yeah there is a program to force network traffic through something, i'm trying to remember the name
2007-09-02T05:53:00.000Z	dug_	rummik	drawing a blank, but i did find this, maybe search for 'transparent proxy': http://schools.coe.ru.ac.za/wiki/Configuring_transparent_proxy
