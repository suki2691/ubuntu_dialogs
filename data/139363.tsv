2007-05-29T05:35:00.000Z	Tom47	aa^way	thats an interesting way of asking that question ... apt-get is simply a means of retreiving and installing applications from repositories .... do you mean is there an IDE supported in ubuntu?
2007-05-29T05:35:00.000Z	aa^way	Tom47	im not sure, i am using default receivnig servers, can i get some IDE with apt-get? I know there is a IDES in ubuntu but i really love the apt-get installing system
