2011-10-16T22:01:00.000Z	frxstrem		what should I do if my partition table isn't recognized by Gparted?
2011-10-16T22:02:00.000Z	urlin2u	frxstrem	is it a gpt?
2011-10-16T22:03:00.000Z	frxstrem	urlin2u	I don't know what it is (I updated it using testdisk because I lost a partition), but it's working in Ubuntu itself (but not in GParted, so I cannot make any modifications to it)
2011-10-16T22:05:00.000Z	urlin2u	frxstrem	the table is problem having a problem, others here will know always include the details and add more if there are more. :D
