2010-07-05T01:40:00.000Z	slidinghorn	osmario	you can try asking in #python
2010-07-12T03:10:00.000Z	slidinghorn	osmario	you have to extract the archive before doing the ./configure make make install part
2010-07-12T03:13:00.000Z	osmario	slidinghorn	and others: I unpack the files, make a folder with the files, access them by command line and tried to install
