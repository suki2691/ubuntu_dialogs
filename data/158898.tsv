2006-11-19T14:31:00.000Z	SilentDis		quick question:  I'm running ubuntu, but would like to have the kde environment available to me.  can Gnome and KDE be run in 'paralell', what package do I need to select, and how do you 'switch' between the 2?
2006-11-19T14:32:00.000Z	rioghal	SilentDis	gnome apps can easily run in kde and vice versa  youll need to install  kubuntu-desktop to get kde and youll have to log out and back in (choosing the desktop you want to use) in order to use the one you want
2006-11-19T14:32:00.000Z	SilentDis	rioghal	 thanks!  off to work with me, and the 'puter has some downloading to do :)
