2007-01-16T17:24:00.000Z	gnoodles		Hi everyone... I'm trying to get Ubuntu 6.1 installed, but it keeps crashing as soon as X launches. It sometimes makes it as far as the desktop showing up, but usually crashes shortly after the tan screen shows up. I've tried using text install, from the alternate CD which worked fine, but then the insatlled version crashes on startup. Kubuntu has the same problem. Any thoughts?
