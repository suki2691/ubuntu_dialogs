2005-10-10T08:25:00.000Z	MalachiCrunch		Hi? Anyone here wants to help me with ubuntu installation? My problem is:
2005-10-10T08:25:00.000Z	MalachiCrunch		While I am installing 'ubunto base system' (during normal installation) i get an error on something related to 'initrd', it says the file is corrupt or something else, i burned my cd from .iso file a few days ago and the burning process returned OK. Is my CD really corrupted? I tryed 'Check CD-ROM Integrity' and it returned an error on one of the samba files !?!?!
2005-10-10T08:25:00.000Z	MalachiCrunch		the fact is, should I try reburn my CD or there is another way this error to happen...
