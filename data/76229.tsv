2010-04-17T17:13:00.000Z	tarelerulz		I got an android phone and it records video in mpeg 4 ,but the audio is in arm and nothing seems to play it . I got the lib for that ,but I have no idea what media player use that
2010-04-17T17:13:00.000Z	bloopletech	tarelerulz	perhaps try mplayer
2010-04-17T17:13:00.000Z	bloopletech	tarelerulz	it may include support for that codec
2010-04-17T17:17:00.000Z	bloopletech	tarelerulz	how did you install mplayer?
