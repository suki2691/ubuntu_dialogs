2009-01-03T10:52:00.000Z	brEz		Hi, I'm using Ubuntu 8.10 and I have open-shh server running - I was wondering if there was a way to view what another user is doing while in my box?

2009-01-03T10:53:00.000Z	brEz	WebcamWonder	can I physically view what they're typing etc through a terminal?
2009-01-03T10:54:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	brEz	I am not sure with that
