2010-09-12T03:54:00.000Z	bobo123	seidos	it whould be nice though if ubuntu helped the users to painlessly become hackers :-)
2010-09-12T03:58:00.000Z	bobo123	seidos	I would love to be able to rightclick on the titlebar on any application and select "Change this program" and ubuntu should automaticly download the source and load it in an userfriendly integrated development editor. (and in the IDE's the run-menu have a "put my changed program back into /usr/bin/whatever)
