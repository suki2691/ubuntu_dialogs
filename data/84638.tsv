2012-07-24T10:41:00.000Z	LinuxVertigo		My computer screen has started flashing using Ubuntu, is this heard of?
2012-07-24T10:42:00.000Z	fidel_	LinuxVertigo	does it flash only with ubuntu? can you by chance connect another os/computer to test the display
2012-07-24T10:43:00.000Z	fidel_	LinuxVertigo	guess checking this first should help checking if its an hard or software issue
2012-07-24T10:44:00.000Z	fidel_	LinuxVertigo	connect by chance another device
