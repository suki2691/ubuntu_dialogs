2007-06-18T13:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	siimo	Movie Player ( totem )
2007-08-29T14:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	siimo	I don't know about that model but all ATI cards should be supported ( if you can call it that ) by ATI's closed source drivers
2007-08-29T14:21:00.000Z	siimo	Jordan_U	are you shure?   the driver doesn't list this model or any 2xxx models in the support cards
