2009-11-06T19:34:00.000Z	rizzuh		I'm trying to install 9.10 on VBox 3.0.10 on W7 but I can't select "Try Ubuntu" or "Install Ubuntu" options at all - hiting enter does nothing. What could be wrong?
2009-11-06T19:34:00.000Z	rizzuh		Actually nothing but "Boot from first HDD" works.
2009-11-06T19:34:00.000Z	mr-dedup	rizzuh	try going to full screen
2009-11-06T19:35:00.000Z	rizzuh	mr-dedup	nothing different.
