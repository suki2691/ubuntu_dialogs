2008-09-04T07:11:00.000Z	odla		i have a question about the wubi-installer ... i am using a university computer and i convinced my IT guy to install ubuntu via the wubi-installer on it (it works great btw).  but i am curious if it's an expanding image or if he set some predetermined size?

2008-09-04T07:13:00.000Z	odla	Chetyre	ok
