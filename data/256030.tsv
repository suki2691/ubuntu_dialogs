2004-12-04T06:06:00.000Z	ajmitch_	OrngeTide	surprised at that? :)
2004-12-04T06:09:00.000Z	OrngeTide	ajmitch_	well i never heard of it until like 5 seconds ago. i was running gentoo on my ibook, but it took a big dump on me. so i tried out crux, and it had issues that i didn't feel like resolving.
2004-12-04T06:09:00.000Z	OrngeTide	ajmitch_	just surprised to see this many people in the channel. so i'm downloading the iso now
