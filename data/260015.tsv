2006-03-02T12:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chris	 vlc has some very HUGE # of command line options.. and a lot of docs on its homepage..
2006-03-02T12:29:00.000Z	Chris	Dr_Willis	im looking at the docs and dont see a way to start it wihtout it trying to load a gui, though i know its possible.
2006-03-02T12:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Chris	 i seem to recall some --nogui or somthing option.
