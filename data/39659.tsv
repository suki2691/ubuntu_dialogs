2010-01-03T14:43:00.000Z	tb45t		Hello. I can't delete a file from an external drive. I get an error message: "Error removing file: No such file or directory". I have tried running from root.
2010-01-03T14:43:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	tb45t	Are you sure the file or directory exists?
2010-01-03T14:44:00.000Z	tb45t	kinja-sheep	There is an icon for the file.
2010-01-03T14:45:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	tb45t	What path? There must be a typo in your commands.
