2008-09-05T18:15:00.000Z	ndlovu		I should have firefox 2.0.19 (ubuntu package) and 3.0.1 (mozilla download) installed. Any idea how I would specify to run the old version?
2008-09-05T18:16:00.000Z	jlong	ndlovu	- run 'firefox-2'
2008-09-05T18:16:00.000Z	ndlovu	jlong	firefox-2: command not found
2008-09-05T18:17:00.000Z	jlong	ndlovu	- you sure it's installed?
