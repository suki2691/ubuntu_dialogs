2012-07-12T15:21:00.000Z	mogaj	ikonia	what should i do now to rectify it?
2012-07-12T15:22:00.000Z	ikonia		you'll probably have to do a force remove as that package's remove group doesn't seem to like the "admin" group
2012-07-12T15:22:00.000Z	ikonia	mogaj	I'd look at where that package came from also
