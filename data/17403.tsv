2011-03-03T00:21:00.000Z	brisker	bastidrazor	 I mean the apps that come with Ubuntu.  To start em from commnd line.
2011-03-03T00:26:00.000Z	bastidrazor	brisker	i don't know of one.. you could right click Applications > Edit Menus > then look at the properties of the items listed. that will show you the command it calls to run the program.  you can also cheat a little and use gnome-open filename.extension   ;that will open the appropriate application
