2006-07-21T11:41:00.000Z	sysrpl		i'd really like to be able to watch videos from youtubes with sound

2006-07-21T11:44:00.000Z	lampshade	sysrpl	hmmmm  I dunno.  the only thing that has helped me on the no sound on youtube, and type stuff was to install alsaoss.  that seemed to work but I honestly don't really know why that works or anything like that
