2006-08-15T07:50:00.000Z	Jimbo_	Flannel	i have universe and multiverse setup and there is not one main package that i can see for wxwidgets. only the gtk individual libs. :(
2006-08-15T07:51:00.000Z	Flannel	Jimbo_	wx-common
2006-08-15T07:53:00.000Z	Jimbo_	Flannel	i manually installed that but i'm still getting loads of wxwidget errors. hmm, i think this source code must be problematic :(
