2008-03-31T12:06:00.000Z	xaxxon		I have a 4-core system but when I run folding at home, it only wants to use about 2.5-3 cores.  It runs 4 processes, but they never take up 100% CPU each
2008-03-31T12:06:00.000Z	xaxxon		they're all around 50-60%
2008-03-31T12:07:00.000Z	hischild_	xaxxon	can you set the amount of processes higher? like to 5 or 6?
2008-03-31T12:08:00.000Z	hischild_	xaxxon	i've seen that before and the only solution i could find was to manually increase the amount of spawned processes.
