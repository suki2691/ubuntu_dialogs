2011-07-01T15:56:00.000Z	blargg		I installed 10.04 and have kept it up-to-date. Does this mean it should now be at 10.04.2, or do I have to download the 10.04.2 CD and run that?
2011-07-01T15:57:00.000Z	blargg		I don't know how to verify that it's 10.04.2

2011-07-01T15:59:00.000Z	blargg	devral	I take it the release doesn't show the .2? I get: Description: Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS, Release: 10.04
