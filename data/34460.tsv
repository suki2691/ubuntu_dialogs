2011-06-07T01:26:00.000Z	Kutemclose		anyone here know of a good alternative program to Devede?
2011-06-07T01:26:00.000Z	DasEi	Kutemclose	not an alternative, but nice for converting: handbrake
2011-06-07T01:27:00.000Z	Kutemclose	DasEi	so I can use it for avi's to put on a DVD?
2011-06-07T01:28:00.000Z	DasEi	Kutemclose	will have to be installed from source or foreign deb, not in repos, yess converts, also could try brasero or nero for linux, if you got a license
