2010-10-08T20:28:00.000Z	cx42net		I don't understand what's going on : I have ubuntu 10.10 installed on a ssd and today after reboot, everything went crazy : I didn't had the menu bar (with time, icons, notifications, etc), firefox crashes after 5 seconds, apt-get gives me a segmentation fault about a depot with a wrong signature (an ubuntu original depot)
2010-10-08T20:28:00.000Z	cx42net		what's going on ?
