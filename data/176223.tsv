2007-08-29T07:05:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	Actionman	It's pretty stable
2007-08-29T07:07:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	Actionman	Might have some problems with fonts... but that depends on the screen.... and when booting from the live-cd chances are you won't see the booting screen if you have intel video card... but once it's installed or virtualized it runs fine
