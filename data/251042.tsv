2005-08-08T14:50:00.000Z	samu		can somebody recommend a nice editor for working with ruby?
2005-08-08T14:51:00.000Z	levander	samu	check if blueflish does that
2005-08-08T14:53:00.000Z	levander	samu	that's a religious debate
2005-08-08T14:54:00.000Z	levander	samu	really though, vi and emacs are kind of advanced to program in.  I'd look and see if bluefish has ruby support.
