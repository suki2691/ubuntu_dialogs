2010-04-14T15:09:00.000Z	nibbler	eni23	yes it is, but make a backup of the backup before!
2010-04-14T15:10:00.000Z	eni23	nibbler	allready done. i have the table filesa, but how to tell mysql to use the old ones?
2010-04-14T15:11:00.000Z	nibbler	eni23	hmm define datadir to the old files? overwrite the new files with the old ones? use your old mysql config?
