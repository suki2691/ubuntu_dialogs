2012-06-04T10:46:00.000Z	slobknob		actually my question is, does wubi support kubuntu as well?
2012-06-04T10:47:00.000Z	fidel	slobknob	may i ask why you want to use kubi in the first place?
2012-06-04T10:49:00.000Z	fidel	slobknob	afaik it should work with kubuntu as well as it does with ubuntu. i was asking as i do have the impression that using wubi isnt the best idea in the first place - but i might be wrong here as well
