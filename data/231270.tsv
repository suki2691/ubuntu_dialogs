2006-01-08T17:55:00.000Z	cary		 psusi, this may be an obvious thing, but its telling me there are three kernels. does it matter which i use? linux-386, linux-image-386, linux-image-2.6.12-9386
2006-01-08T17:56:00.000Z	cmatheson	cary	linux-image-386 is just a package that installs linux-image-2.6.12-9-386 (the newest kernel)
2006-01-08T17:56:00.000Z	cary	cmatheson	so should i select the last one? its asking me to pick on
