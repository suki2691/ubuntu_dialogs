2006-01-08T11:37:00.000Z	noddaba		I'm looking for an editor that can 1.) fold functions, and 2.) print the file with these folds in.  I've found plenty of editors that can do 1.) but none far that can do 2.).  What I'm trying to do is get an "index" or "table of contents" of functions in a class, to make code reviews go smoother.
2006-01-08T11:37:00.000Z	noddaba		anyone have any suggestions?  I've tried Bluefish, Anjuta, Eclipse, and a few others
2006-01-08T11:38:00.000Z	gnomefreak	noddaba	try vim or emacs?
