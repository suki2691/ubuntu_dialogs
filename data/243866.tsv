2008-02-19T02:56:00.000Z	kmosatwork		i've got a small question: how long should the livecd take before it launches ubuntu? took me 30 minutes, then I gave up.. :(
2008-02-19T02:57:00.000Z	dave_	kmosatwork	what kind of hardware are you working with
2008-02-19T02:57:00.000Z	dave_	kmosatwork	intel architecture?
2008-02-19T02:58:00.000Z	dave_	kmosatwork	if its a fairly new laptop, no longer than 5 minutes really. i had a 133mhz boot the live cd in 10 minutes. so perhaps you should try a different version of ubuntu maybe go back a version.
