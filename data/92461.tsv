2008-10-29T01:31:00.000Z	ikonia	lobo235	re-install
2008-10-29T01:32:00.000Z	lobo235	ikonia	in this case, I did an "apt-get remove lamp-server^" and it ended up removing packages that it shouldn't have and now I can't even get gnome running
2008-10-29T01:32:00.000Z	ikonia	lobo235	lamp-server won't touch gnome
