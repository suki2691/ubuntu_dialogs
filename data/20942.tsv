I am having issues launching an instance from my custom AMI. In an attempt to track down the issue, I launched an instance from the original AMI and immediatly created a new AMI by running euca-bundle-vol follwed by euca-upload-bundle on the instance and registering the new AMI through the console. However, when I launch an instance from my new AMI,
