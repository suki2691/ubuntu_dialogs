2011-05-10T04:35:00.000Z	I-are-		can anyone help me determine why a fresh install of ubuntu 9.10 on an old compaq laptop is very slow. eth0 is only pulling about 30 B/s average, 176 B/s is the max I have gotten.  It seemed to work fine when running windows.
2011-05-10T04:35:00.000Z	xangua	I-are-	9.10 is no longer supported
2011-05-10T04:36:00.000Z	I-are-	xangua	I know it is not supported, but why would the network crap out? I tried installing 11.4 but it froze.
