2012-02-29T16:50:00.000Z	Starn		hey the new installer for ubuntu/xubuntu is way different than the last time i used.. i have two hard drives.. both 500gb used windows partition manager to make 240gb partition for ubuntu/xubuntu  will ubuntu installer automatically detect the smallest partition so to speak and install on that?
2012-02-29T16:51:00.000Z	Starn		so don't used install alongside them?
2012-02-29T16:52:00.000Z	Starn		if not in manual is suggest swap size for 4gb or ram 4gb swap?
2012-02-29T16:54:00.000Z	babilen	Starn	8192 and 4gb would be 4096
