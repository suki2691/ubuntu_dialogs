2006-11-21T11:17:00.000Z	ochosi		hi, i'm using mail-notification 2.0 in edgy and i can't use the "mail-reader" feature because it tries to open evolution (although i don't have it installed). any ideas how to change that to thunderbird? (btw in my preferred apps there's of course thunderbird for email)
2006-11-21T11:17:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	ochosi	did you manually remove evolution?
2006-11-21T11:18:00.000Z	ochosi	fyrestrtr	nope, i know that this is for ubuntu and not xubuntu, but in the xubuntu irc there was no one who could help me. in xubuntu thunderbird is standard mail app.
