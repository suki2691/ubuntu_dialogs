2006-03-28T10:15:00.000Z	porky_scratching		I got a .dat file that contains all my passwords, they have been encrypted by a program, I know the password to unlock the file but it only opens up in the application and there is no way to copy them over so I can delete the application and use my passwords elsewhere does anyone know of a application I can use on the .dat file to make a plain txt copy , is this even possible? I assmue it is...
