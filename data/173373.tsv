2009-11-03T18:05:00.000Z	greenfuji		since updating to 9.10 one of my applications doesn't work. Running in terminal the error is "error while loading shared libraries: libcrypto++.so.7: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" I enabled pre-released updates and searched in synaptic and found libcrypto++8. Application still wont run. Any ideas?
2009-11-03T18:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	greenfuji	Which app?
2009-11-03T18:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	greenfuji	 try and only get stuff from the Ubuntu repos,  if you get from else where problems can happen,  what you want to download with it by the way?
2009-11-03T18:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	greenfuji	install it,  from the repo if it's there?   or  from source maybe
