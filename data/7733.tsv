2011-11-16T04:08:00.000Z	SnoStorm		Can someone help me? I am a ubuntu noob. I'm trying to set up my ubuntu netbook and usb external as  media server-esque for my ps3 and notebook
2011-11-16T04:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SnoStorm	could use samba, assuming PS3 can access samba shares
2011-11-16T04:13:00.000Z	SnoStorm	ActionParsnip	Would MediaTomb work?
2011-11-16T04:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SnoStorm	sure, or xbmc
