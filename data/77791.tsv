2009-03-29T16:26:00.000Z	madsj		can anyone help me figure out why installing sun-java6-jdk does not enable the javac-command ?
2009-03-29T16:26:00.000Z	pronoy	madsj	you need to set the environment variable
2009-03-29T16:26:00.000Z	pronoy	madsj	i think you might be getting this...javac can be found in the following packages
2009-03-29T16:27:00.000Z	madsj	pronoy	I thought that would happen by default; I set the PATH variable to a jvm-directory, but had hoped it wouldn't be necessay; and yes, I did get that "might be found in " message
