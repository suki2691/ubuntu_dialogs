2010-06-13T00:22:00.000Z	Vooloo		is there a way to filter a directory? if I am in a dir and want to search for a file, it should only show those that match my query
2010-06-13T00:24:00.000Z	unop	Vooloo	 find dir -name "*whatever*"
2010-06-13T00:25:00.000Z	Vooloo	unop	not in nautilus?
2010-06-13T00:25:00.000Z	unop	Vooloo	in that case, i don't have any idea - i don't use nautilus.  Doesn't it have a search applet?
