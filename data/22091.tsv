2010-12-24T10:33:00.000Z	F3RR1S		hey... i am going to create individual partitions for ubuntu (/, /boot, /home, /var, /usr, /tmp, and swap) what sizes should these be? I have a 200GB drive
2010-12-24T10:34:00.000Z	F3RR1S		I haven't really thought about it before but now I am planning to keep ubuntu on this system... I will have 3 users

2010-12-24T10:38:00.000Z	F3RR1S	rdw200169	yeah... i ran into some issues when I installed a lot of packages and ended up reinstalling on my laptop... should have used gparted... which is why I want to make sure I have plenty of space
