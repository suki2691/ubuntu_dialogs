2008-01-21T12:33:00.000Z	misc--		ok so I have the ubuntu ISO, but I need to install from a usb stick seeing I have no cdrom. I've read that you have to create the partitions on the usb stick manually then copy files from CD etc. Then I read on the ubuntu docs: Copy ISO image to any partition or flash drive which you have. Then change kernel params. So is it possible to simply copy the ISO to the usb stick with dd or somethign?
