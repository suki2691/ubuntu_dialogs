2008-08-28T18:51:00.000Z	harry1989		can someone help me with my problems please? 1: pressing any number on numpad restarts XServer, 2: when restarting i get "The greeter application appears to be crashing."
2008-08-28T18:53:00.000Z	Jafet	harry1989	1: might be a borked keyboard config linking all your numpad keys to the restart X function 2: variety of poorly-understood and poorly-addressed causes; see if reinstall gdm works
2008-08-28T18:53:00.000Z	Jafet	harry1989	you are using Gnome, I presume.
2008-08-28T18:56:00.000Z	Jafet	harry1989	probably a question for the forums.
