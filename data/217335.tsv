2005-10-28T06:54:00.000Z	jmont		Hello, I have made an Skype's deb package that does not require the libqt3c102-mt, but the libqt3-mt (avaliable in the Ubuntu repositorys). Where could I upload it to the multiverse official repository?

2005-10-28T06:55:00.000Z	crimsun	jmont	the best route is to tell Skype to post the version on their Web site.
