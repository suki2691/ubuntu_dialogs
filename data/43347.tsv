2010-03-01T04:58:00.000Z	trism	bonez2046	there are a variety of ways to upgrade to the latest firefox listed here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxNewVersion
2010-03-01T04:58:00.000Z	bonez2046	trism	I realize I can get the latest tarball, but I want to make sure I don't break my system too..
2010-03-01T04:59:00.000Z	trism	bonez2046	tarball is one way, but there are several other ways (easiest is probably with the firefox-stable channel ppa)
