2007-06-12T13:50:00.000Z	The_entropy		i have installed ubuntu 7.04 today and a very weird thing is happening that didn't use to occur with 6.04, my computer will randomly just freeze(mouse and keyb don't work anymore)
2007-06-12T13:50:00.000Z	The_entropy		it acts just like a hardware overheat but i'm sure it is not one(ubuntu 6.04 runs just fine and just for safety i have increased the fan power)
