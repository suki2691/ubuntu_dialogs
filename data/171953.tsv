2006-08-05T07:57:00.000Z	Tommck_		hello all.. This may seem like a newb question, but I was wondering what I could do to stop apt-get from asking me for the installation CD when I try to install new software.  Do I have to copy the whole CD to disk?
2006-08-05T07:58:00.000Z	Tommck_		I've been searching for an answer to this, but I guess I'm not phrasing the search terms well
