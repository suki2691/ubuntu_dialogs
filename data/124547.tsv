2007-08-27T06:05:00.000Z	gvsa123	blix	sorry. if you're behind an ISP that uses the NAT thing, you might have a difficult, if not impossible time setting up remote access. i never got mine fiesty desktop to be accessible from the outside world due to this.
2007-08-27T06:07:00.000Z	gvsa123	blix	spent three whole days trying to figure that out. i think it really is impossible, as far as i know
