2008-09-15T01:30:00.000Z	amenado		fo_x86-> lack of headers, install them
2008-09-15T01:30:00.000Z	fo_x86	amenado	do I apt-cache search for headers?
2008-09-15T01:31:00.000Z	fo_x86	amenado	it gives me tons of packages, which one is the right one?
2008-09-15T01:32:00.000Z	fo_x86	amenado	but how do I find out if the headers is the standard lib headers for C? (I just want the very standard libs)
