2007-05-15T06:23:00.000Z	jpsamara		Can anyone help with azureus. I'm behind a fast pipe, how many connections should be optimal to put on "maximum simultaneus outbond..." it has a default of 8 connections but I found that increasing this number to 32 is much faster... should I  max it to 100?

2007-05-15T06:25:00.000Z	Maczimus		so i would set it to like 30
2007-05-15T06:30:00.000Z	jpsamara	Maczimus	how much do you put?
