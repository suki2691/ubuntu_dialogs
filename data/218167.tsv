2005-10-04T15:31:00.000Z	Travis|H		I am trying to use Calc (Excel program of OpenOffice) for conditional formatting to "band" colors (every other line is a certain color) ....... I'm trying to use "=MOD(ROW(),2)=1" as "Formula Is" ....... but it isn't working
2005-10-04T15:31:00.000Z	Travis|H		does Calc use a different method to achieve this?

2005-10-04T15:34:00.000Z	[LethAL] 	Travis|H	ah...
