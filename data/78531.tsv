2008-09-30T15:02:00.000Z	DJones	leslieviljoen	Probably the two most common ones are Xchat or Irssi, Xchat is graphical client like MIRC, irssi is command line
2008-09-30T15:03:00.000Z	leslieviljoen	DJones	I need something that highlights each different person's output in a different colour
2008-09-30T15:04:00.000Z	DJones	leslieviljoen	That I don't know, I only use irssi now
