2007-08-15T10:15:00.000Z	Sensae		I have a Trendnet TEG-PCITXR gigabit ethernet adapter. I've installed it and it's running on r8169 drivers, however it only operates at 10base-T
2007-08-15T10:16:00.000Z	Sensae		Has anyone gotten a Trendnet gigabit PCI adapter working in ubuntu?
2007-08-15T10:17:00.000Z	RudyValencia	Sensae	what model?
2007-08-15T10:19:00.000Z	RudyValencia	Sensae	I think there may be a driver on the manufacturer's site
