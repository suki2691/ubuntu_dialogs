2010-04-05T08:33:00.000Z	switch10_	brodymcd	you are trying to access your work PC via SSH?
2010-04-05T08:36:00.000Z	switch10_	brodymcd	use a proxy server?  like your students do :)
2010-04-05T08:38:00.000Z	switch10_	brodymcd	like http://www.youhide.com/ for example.  there are literal thousands of others, so chances are your firewall will let a few through..
