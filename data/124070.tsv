2008-01-14T03:00:00.000Z	josiah		is there no easy way to share a folder with samba?
2008-01-14T03:00:00.000Z	Seveas	josiah	system -> admin -> shared folders
2008-01-14T03:02:00.000Z	josiah	Seveas	Ok. I have everything set up correctly in here (from what I can tell) but I am still not seeing the share on my windows machine.
2008-01-14T03:06:00.000Z	josiah	Seveas	ok it just took a while. I now see my computer in windows... but it is asking for a user/pass... and not accepting. Cant I just make the share available to anybody on the network rw?
