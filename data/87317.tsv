2008-07-20T01:59:00.000Z	fwaokda		my ram is running at 96% and I dont know why :( how can I stop it?
2008-07-20T02:00:00.000Z	__yy	fwaokda	use top to figure out what program is eating all your ram and kill it
2008-07-20T02:00:00.000Z	__yy	fwaokda	open a terminal and type top
2008-07-20T02:01:00.000Z	__yy	fwaokda	then once top is open type F n <enter>, that will sort running programs by the percentage of memory they are using (case is important here)
