2009-03-04T02:04:00.000Z	seeurchinz		if i want about 10 to 15 computers to connect to a single server computer to do something like a remote desktop, how might i go about that?
2009-03-04T02:05:00.000Z	seeurchinz		i want that remote desktop session to be a replacement for an os on those connecting computers if that makes sense
