2007-09-20T15:27:00.000Z	genii	idiot	Squid doesn't have a valid login shell by default
2007-09-20T15:28:00.000Z	idiot	genii	i mean squid password for users, used to axx internet
2007-09-20T15:30:00.000Z	genii	idiot	If you don't have already the password it means you are likely not allowed to use it. If you are, ask whoever administers the squid proxy server you need the password to. I cannot help you more than this.
