2011-10-27T02:18:00.000Z	zykotick9	mamece2	complete removal = purge, so it remove any config files (not the ones in home directory however)
2011-10-27T02:19:00.000Z	mamece2	zykotick9	so i can complete remove an old kernel, right?
2011-10-27T02:19:00.000Z	zykotick9	mamece2	sure, i don't think it'll make much difference for linux-image*, but maybe.
