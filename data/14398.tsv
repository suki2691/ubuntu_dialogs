2011-05-13T05:41:00.000Z	boxbeatsy		hi, i screwed up my ubuntu 10.04 system so that whenever i install or uninstall pacakges i get a whole lot of dependency errors (https://gist.github.com/6845cdb6116391b180ff).  does anyone know how i can fix this?  is there a way to completely remove and reinstall sun-java6-bin and sun-java6-plugins?  When I try, I get the gist'd errors.

2011-05-13T05:42:00.000Z	Dr_Heckle		I couldn't
2011-05-13T05:43:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	Dr_Heckle	i think i just used apt-get install
