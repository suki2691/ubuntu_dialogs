2008-07-22T08:17:00.000Z	joustin		So let me ask this, how hard would it be to go to ubuntu full time? I use my pc for office 2007 and gaming, can wine accomplish all of this for me?
2008-07-22T08:17:00.000Z	joustin		wow and some steam games
2008-07-22T08:17:00.000Z	joustin		yes
2008-07-22T08:18:00.000Z	s3a	joustin	use openoffice.org instead of office 2007 cuz it can also see .doc files and wine can almost always accomplush gaming just chek on site to c which games work and how well
