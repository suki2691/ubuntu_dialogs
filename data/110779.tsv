2008-02-28T11:51:00.000Z	yaro		Hello, it is me again. I am actually representing a friend of mine with a support problem.
2008-02-28T11:52:00.000Z	yaro		My friend just installed Ubuntu 7.10. Not just ten minutes ago, and though Ubuntu loads up, he is reporting that its not loading anything beyond the Ubuntu 'wait' icon, and I am assuming, the orange screen. Any ideas what his problem could be?

2008-02-28T11:59:00.000Z	yaro	Frogzoo	Strange thing. My friend can't seem to get into the GRUB menu when hitting ESC during the countdown.
