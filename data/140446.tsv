2007-04-15T15:56:00.000Z	rahbertlee111		i just ran this command "chmod -R 777 "/dev"/hda3 "/home  and now i cannot log in as user anymore
2007-04-15T15:56:00.000Z	Nubbie	rahbertlee111	because /home is supposed to be 644.
2007-04-15T16:01:00.000Z	Nubbie	rahbertlee111	you MUST have ~./.dmrc chmodded to 644.
2007-04-15T16:03:00.000Z	Nubbie	rahbertlee111	i don't understand why you changed it in the first place?
