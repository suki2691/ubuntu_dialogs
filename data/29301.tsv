2010-07-09T01:11:00.000Z	racethesun	seren	sudo shutdown -h now       will force a shutdown if thats what your asking
2010-07-09T01:17:00.000Z	racethesun	seren	i can show you how to make a button on the panel like that
2010-07-09T01:17:00.000Z	racethesun	seren	it would ask for a sudo password though
