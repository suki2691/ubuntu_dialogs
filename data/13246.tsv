2011-06-24T13:07:00.000Z	gry	dr0id	using that in here, what's happening?
2011-06-24T13:08:00.000Z	gry	dr0id	not the case for me, did you try to sudo apt-get update @@ sudo apt-get upgrade ?
2011-06-24T13:09:00.000Z	gry	dr0id	sounds good, can you create a new user and check if that's the case for that user as well?
