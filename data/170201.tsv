2006-10-17T05:59:00.000Z	dbglt		hey all... I just changed all instances of dapper to edgy in my sources.list then ran an update, then a dist-upgrade... I downloaded about 660mb of stuff, and now there are a few packages it can't find and it won't let me continue with the install
2006-10-17T05:59:00.000Z	dbglt		no idea how apt works, so any help would be good... (I'm getting 404 not found)
2006-10-17T06:00:00.000Z	AWOSDev	dbglt	that method of upgrading really isn't supported...is it?
2006-10-17T06:01:00.000Z	dbglt	AWOSDev	I have no clue whatsoever, was pointed to it on a link from this channel, and just followed it
