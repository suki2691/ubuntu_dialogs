2010-06-05T00:45:00.000Z	Vexc		I recently had some "dark space" between my screens in my dual monitor setup. Which means that the cursor didn't instantly jumped between the both screens. This happend automaticaly when I setup my screens in "nVidia X server settings". Now This does not happen anymore and I want i back, anyone knows how to fix this?
