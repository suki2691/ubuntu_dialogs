2007-10-24T05:58:00.000Z	fujin		Hi, I'm following this guide: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuMagazine/HowTo/LocalRepositoriesHowto to set up a local apt mirror. I've done this, and now I'd like to add newer versions of packages to my mirror. I understand this probably needs some package signing, but haven't been able to find any docs on this process
2007-10-24T05:58:00.000Z	fujin		anyone have any ideas?
