2010-05-28T00:15:00.000Z	FoolishOwl		I'm thinking of trying to study Python over the summer. I notice that Python 2.5 is installed by default, but Python 3.1 is available in the repository. Is there any reason not to install Python 3.1?

2010-05-28T00:17:00.000Z	FoolishOwl	Pici	great. Would I be executing it with 'python3' instead of 'python' and that sort of thing?
2010-05-28T00:18:00.000Z	Pici	FoolishOwl	Correct.
