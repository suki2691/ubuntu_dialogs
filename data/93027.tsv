2008-04-28T08:48:00.000Z	Kaseas		hi, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using a 64bit copy vs a 32bit copy?
2008-04-28T08:49:00.000Z	Pelo	Kaseas	64 bit will handle ram of more then 1 gig,  on the other hand it is missing some hardware drivers for stuff like nvidia and ati video card ans some wifi , and no fiash
2008-04-28T08:49:00.000Z	Kaseas	Pelo	will the 32bit version not handle 2gb of RAM?
2008-04-28T08:51:00.000Z	Pelo	Kaseas	I'm not quite clear on what the limit is , it's either 1 gig or 2 , I dont have that issue my self, i only have 1 gig of ram,  you'd have to look it up in the forum probably
