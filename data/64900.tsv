2009-12-10T01:37:00.000Z	Arsanerit		Hi. SSH X11 forwarding has stopped working, and I am not sure what I have changed. Running "ssh -X localhost evince /home/gerrit/documenten/CV.pdf" gives "Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 key" and then "cannot open display". I tried "xhost +" but this gives '''No protocol specified // xhost:  unable to open display ":0"'''. Any ideas?
