2007-01-02T09:40:00.000Z	pr0gress0r		Hi all, Happy New Year, Im installing ubunto after a failed fedora 6 system. Quick question. Can I get the latest software for kde, firefox etc etc from certain apt repos or am i going to need to install from each site?
2007-01-02T09:41:00.000Z	pr0gress0r		well ive done the dist-upgrade and its only at kde 3.5.2 ( i wanted 3.5.5 ) and firefox 1.5
2007-01-02T09:41:00.000Z	pr0gress0r		maybe i dont have all the apt repos configured
2007-01-02T09:41:00.000Z	kitche	pr0gress0r	ubuntu edgy has firefox 2.0
