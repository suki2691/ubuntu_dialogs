2010-01-04T05:03:00.000Z	mkanyicy	kwtm	sudo apt-get update
2010-01-04T05:03:00.000Z	kwtm	mkanyicy	Really?  I had the impression that apt-cache and apt-get used different indices, for some reason.  Has that changed?  If I use apt-get to update, then apt-cache will also update?
2010-01-04T05:04:00.000Z	mkanyicy	kwtm	oh? not sure, you may be right, I'ven't use apt-cache that much
