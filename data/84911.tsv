2008-07-23T05:29:00.000Z	votan		incase my problem got scrolled away earlier :) --> somehow my Sound-Control stopped working recently after an update. I still hear the sound just fine, but I can't control the volume and (I use a laptop) the internal speakers don't get muted after I plug in external Speakers. Does anyone have an idea what's broken ?
