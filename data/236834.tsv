2005-06-11T11:37:00.000Z	sean_		Who would like to recommend a WM for a slooow machine to me? I have looked at the following - xfce, seems the best choice, not super fast. icewm, super fast but too old school for my users. Fluxbox, didn't work. WindowMaker - way too confusing for my users. Any others worth a try?
