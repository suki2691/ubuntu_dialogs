2010-08-12T22:12:00.000Z	Pici	randomman	That would remove .svn-base from all files that have that extension.
2010-08-12T22:17:00.000Z	randomman	Pici	yes, you understood my question and that works. out of curiosity could it be done in sed?
2010-08-12T22:18:00.000Z	Pici	randomman	sed doesn't know anything about filenames, you would need a multi-line bash script to use sed to do that.
