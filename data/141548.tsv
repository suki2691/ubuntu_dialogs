2008-01-16T18:38:00.000Z	IdleOne	mikebeecham	all except the one you want to play probably. #cedega can help you with that
2008-01-16T18:38:00.000Z	mikebeecham	IdleOne	: that is probably the case :D
2008-01-16T18:43:00.000Z	IdleOne	mikebeecham	check out cedega's website for supported games. they also have a forum and a irc channel. they are better suited to answer questions about this
