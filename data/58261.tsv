2011-07-07T02:06:00.000Z	nicofs	robin0800_	ok, now it works and i have both computers using the same account... but the folders don't synchronize...
2011-07-07T02:10:00.000Z	robin0800_	nicofs	and both computers are in devices? also make sure folders you want to synchronize are selected under cloud folders
2011-07-07T02:10:00.000Z	nicofs	robin0800_	rebooting did the trick...
