2005-06-23T10:27:00.000Z	PhantomFreak		I've been trying to share files on my Ubuntu laptop to my XP PC, but it keeps coming up with password protection, I didn't tell it to put a password on it and it wont accept any passwords/usernames I type in... Does anyone know how to get this to work?
2005-06-23T10:28:00.000Z	PhantomFreak		I already have... But when I try to log in on my XP machine it says it's password protected! But it isn't!
