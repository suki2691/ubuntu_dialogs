2009-04-18T16:30:00.000Z	sliverchair		I already got two reasons to switch back to xp, I need to use the new J2ME SDK 3.0 and to transfer mp3's to my GoGear..

2009-04-18T16:33:00.000Z	sliverchair	mneptok	yeah, I can see devices today losing their robustness, mp3's on PSP easily corrupts, and it doesn't support multi-subdirectories of mp3's!
