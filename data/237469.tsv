2005-12-05T13:09:00.000Z	isaac_		Hey all, if I were to install Ubuntu for '64, will I be able to pull 32-bit packages out of the repository without too much of a hassle?
2005-12-05T13:09:00.000Z	cafuego	isaac_	Not really. Best bet for the moment is to install the i386 branch.
2005-12-05T13:10:00.000Z	isaac_	cafuego	Thanks, I'll prolly end up doing that.
2005-12-05T13:11:00.000Z	cafuego	isaac_	I'm still running the 64bit version here, but once I finish moving house, I'm cross-downgrading to i386.
