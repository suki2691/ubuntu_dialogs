2010-06-29T23:38:00.000Z	SailorReality		actually i guess my question is: How do i setup a extended partition ...is it just the first primary one
2010-06-29T23:38:00.000Z	SailorReality		or is there an option
2010-06-29T23:40:00.000Z	SailorReality		do all primary partitions have to be used first before i can make a logical partition?
2010-06-29T23:40:00.000Z	psimyn|away	SailorReality	you can setup extended partition wherever you would like. it will behave like a logical partition
