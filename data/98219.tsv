2010-02-03T06:28:00.000Z	jahc		I put unr 9.04 on my eee701 many moons ago. I'm trying to upgrade to 9.10 unr now. I downloaded the iso from the ubuntu site, and used a Mac to put it onto a usb drive. The structure of the files looks fine on the usb drive... but it says its not a valid boot drive or similar when I try to boot from it on the netbook. the usb drive is showing up under the BIOS, and I've disabled booting from the hard drive..
