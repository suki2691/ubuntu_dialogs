2008-12-17T01:20:00.000Z	never2far		using ls
2008-12-17T01:21:00.000Z	never2far		it lists also directories
2008-12-17T01:21:00.000Z	ompaul	never2far	ls -a well that lists all the hidden and normal ones you would need to be fairly smart about what it is do hidden only both of those versions are wrong
