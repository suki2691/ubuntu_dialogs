2006-11-04T07:53:00.000Z	Daverocks	IUbuntu	you mean boot into bash instead of X?
2006-11-04T07:55:00.000Z	IUbuntu	Daverocks	when I luch a LiveCD and I select anything other than VGA mode, everything seems to be fine except the mose pointer, but after the install of Ubuntu, it will by default login into VGA mode and if it does, all I can see is white-yellow stripes (cannot see anything). And I do not want to be in "Text Mode".
