2008-02-29T21:58:00.000Z	mroc		quick sftp or scp question - i'd like to transfer files from my computer to computer2, which connects to the internet through computer1.  all the info i've read for sftp/scp describes how to go from one computer to a second computer.  how do i send files from my computer to computer2 in this case?

2008-02-29T22:03:00.000Z	mroc	Squawk	i can connect to the router (dd-wrt w/ ssh enabled, not port forwarding) then ssh from the router to the computer i'm interested in.   the router is exposed to the internet.  what i was calling computer 2 is behind it.  i don't know what the syntax would have to be to scp files to that computer though.
