2009-01-18T23:35:00.000Z	Baba_B00ie	LorgonJortle	the problem with that is it's my laptop not a desktop.. so installing a 3d card might be a little difficult don't you think lol ?
2009-01-18T23:36:00.000Z	LorgonJortle	Baba_B00ie	Yeah, it would. So difficult it wouldn't be worth it. I'm on a laptop too, but I have a good graphics card.... Are you able to enable desktop effects?
