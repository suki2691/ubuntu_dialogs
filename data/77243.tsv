2009-02-02T20:46:00.000Z	dr_Willis	GaMbi_DK	 i normally make a directrory, copy ALL the files from both disks to that directrory. then use wine to run the installer in that directory. - no disks needed then by wine. and it will intstall much faster
2009-02-02T20:47:00.000Z	GaMbi_DK	dr_Willis	yea.. I see now that I might have to do that.. but since Iw came this fare.. can I change the DVD? or do I have to redo and copy all data to disc?
2009-02-02T20:48:00.000Z	dr_Willis	GaMbi_DK	 the problem is that using  'wine /path/to/cd/whatever.exe'  locks the cd - in many cases  - I dont recall any good fix's - i think cedega some how worked around it.
