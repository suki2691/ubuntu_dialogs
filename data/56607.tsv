2009-11-16T08:16:00.000Z	Nautilus		Can anyone help me remember what I used to install (L)AMP?  It was a command something like: "pkg-list install lamp-server"
2009-11-16T08:16:00.000Z	Nautilus		but i dont think it was pkg-list
2009-11-16T08:17:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Nautilus	apt-get install possibly?
2009-11-16T08:17:00.000Z	Nautilus	linuxguy2009	no, i dont think so, it wass a pkg list thing
