2009-07-08T06:34:00.000Z	L3dPlatedLinux		was wondering whats the difference between ufw and firestarter and if any which is better to use?
2009-07-08T06:35:00.000Z	rdw200169	L3dPlatedLinux	ufw and firestarter, essentially, perform the same task
2009-07-08T06:35:00.000Z	rdw200169	L3dPlatedLinux	they both work with iptables, the commandline driven interface to the firewall code integrated into the Linux Kernel
2009-07-08T06:36:00.000Z	rdw200169	L3dPlatedLinux	regardless, from my personal experience, I prefer firestarter, because its really easy, and the firewall configuration it uses is excellent for most client related matters (not suitable for complex networking environments etc...)
