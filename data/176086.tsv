2006-07-12T07:58:00.000Z	yipe		here's a weird hypothetical I'm-not-really-gonna-even-try-but-I'm-curious kinda question:
2006-07-12T07:59:00.000Z	yipe		is it possible to run Ubuntu off the FreeBSD kernel? Basically just swap in the FreeBSD kernel in place of the linux one, make the appropriate grub entry, and reboot?
2006-07-12T07:59:00.000Z	yipe		I'd call it freebuntu
2006-07-12T08:00:00.000Z	kaot	yipe	I think not.  at all.
