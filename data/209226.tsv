2007-12-19T07:50:00.000Z	Sonja		i'm considering making the switch from winxp to ubuntu, but i need programs for these tasks: convert an avi or other video file to a normal video dvd (like Nero), also need a good equivalent for Dreamweaver with a good code view, and also an equivalent of Winamp and mIrc
2007-12-19T07:50:00.000Z	Sonja		so basically what's the best linux equivalent of Nero, Dreamweaver, winamp and mIrc?
2007-12-19T07:51:00.000Z	LjL	Sonja	Nero, gnomebaker or something is what's installed by default, i believe. dreamweaver, check out kompozer. winamp, well there are many players, ask ubotu about !players. mirc... aren't you on it right now? ;) x-chat is pretty full featured
2008-01-16T19:32:00.000Z	LjL	Sonja	ask in #ubuntu+1, and see the !hardy factoid (it has a link with the current differences)
