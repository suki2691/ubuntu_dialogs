2006-09-15T12:25:00.000Z	cdubya		I keep getting this weird stuff happening with openoffice.org.....everytime I try to open this particular doc (it's an excel file), oo.org acts like it's trying to open it with Writer/Web......but I want it to open with Calc.....this is frustrating me to no end and I'd really like to completely remove oo.org and all the config files and EVERYTHING and reinstall it fresh so that maybe that will resolve the issue.....any suggestio
2006-09-15T12:26:00.000Z	ketsugi	cdubya	sudo dpkg-reconfigure openoffice
2006-09-15T12:26:00.000Z	ketsugi		maybe that will work?
2006-09-15T12:26:00.000Z	cdubya	ketsugi	if that will work, I'll jump for joy....but I'm a pessimist when it comes to these things....I'll try it though.
