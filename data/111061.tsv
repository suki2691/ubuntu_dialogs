2007-12-03T20:52:00.000Z	nik_		hello, on my desktop are some partitions shown; ...they are called "data" and "sda1"...how to rename them?
2007-12-03T20:53:00.000Z	jrib	nik_	you may use "e2label" if they are ext2/3
2007-12-03T20:55:00.000Z	nik_	jrib	thanks...and for FAT?
2007-12-03T20:56:00.000Z	jrib	nik_	that one requires some extra steps, try googling "label fat ubuntu"
