2008-09-12T05:06:00.000Z	soundray	amenado2	most such difficulties arise from modifications of the gutsy install. A freshly installed gutsy will upgrade cleanly
2008-09-12T05:06:00.000Z	amenado2		aTypical-> just an fyi, a debootstrap installs the base, then installing the packages to complete it
2008-09-12T05:07:00.000Z	amenado2	soundray	oh okay cool..i guess off the bat people tend to do an update that modifies and then do an upgrade..
