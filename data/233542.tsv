2005-06-10T08:11:00.000Z	tchmnky	Fab_	doesn't mplayer understand srt subtitles? I never use them myself. VLC might (it's like mplayer: http://www.videolan.org)
2005-06-10T08:12:00.000Z	Fab_	tchmnky	i dont know, but mplayer is borked atm on this system so i cant try, thats why i asked :)
2005-06-10T08:13:00.000Z	tchmnky	Fab_	if your mplayer is b0rked, best to get vlc. :) I use it over mplayer now all the time. Just remember to get the gtk package for wxvlc, or it'll look very... 'Redmonish'. ;)
