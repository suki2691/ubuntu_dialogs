2007-03-12T10:31:00.000Z	dromer		hi all, atm I'm trying to have dual-screen on my htpc with the composite-out of my Geforce2/MX. I used this guide: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=98456&highlight=  and it works quite well, but is there another way to have the 2nd screen as an actual extension of the desktop? so I can move programs and maximise them etc?  this would be quit helpfull since I can hardly read any text and stuff on my tv
