2008-04-12T16:23:00.000Z	FreakyFred		Hey, do you guys think you could help me with an installation problem? I am trying to install 7.10, but it always just goes directly to the terminal. I have tried a startx, but that just gives me a No screens found error. i am using an 8800gt with 2 connected monitors, bot with a DVI to VGA converter.

2008-04-12T16:33:00.000Z	neogojira	FreakyFred	sorry i meant xorgcfg / xorgconfig
