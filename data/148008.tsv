2007-12-03T07:25:00.000Z	kelsin	tds5016	if you can copy from a windows drive
2007-12-03T07:27:00.000Z	kelsin	tds5016	the past couple times I've installed it, the process has been copy the program files folder from a windows install, install wine from ubuntu repos, then run wine wow.exe with no issues, when you go searching for help check dates cause wine has improved a lot since the first wow on linux tutorials
