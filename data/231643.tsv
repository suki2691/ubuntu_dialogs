2005-07-27T16:27:00.000Z	wdh	Rugmonster	true.. but ubuntu just takes those security patches and includes them in the 1.0.2 version..
2005-07-27T16:27:00.000Z	Rugmonster	wdh	ah
2005-07-27T16:28:00.000Z	wdh	Rugmonster	actually firefox is just one of a kind.. its a protection of the stability of ubuntu actually.. usually new software comes with new features.. and therefore new bugs..
