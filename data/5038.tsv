2012-03-01T21:43:00.000Z	vicium_		So i've got a .jar file (minecraft.jar) to be exact. I made a .sh script. And to run the game I have #!/bin/sh         screen java -Xincgc -Xmx3072m -jar minecraft.jar
2012-03-01T21:44:00.000Z	vicium_		The parameters I use feel incorrect
2012-03-01T21:44:00.000Z	_Marcus	vicium_	Are they the parameters that they tell you to use on Minecraft's website?
2012-03-01T21:45:00.000Z	vicium_	_Marcus	No, its actually for the server script I have, I copied them. Because I know it allows for more memory usage
