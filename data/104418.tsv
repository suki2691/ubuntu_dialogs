2011-12-19T23:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MrPopinjay	the rightclick menu in nautilus will once you install rar and unrar
2011-12-19T23:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MrPopinjay	if you install unp you can use unp on nearly any archive and it will be handed rather than remembering the switches to extract the different filetypes
2011-12-19T23:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MrPopinjay	unp is a terminal command. I also recommend you install p7zip-full and p7zip-rar
