2011-06-28T09:16:00.000Z	ttiicc		Im a java developer who's been using debian for 2 years. Im switching to a new company right now and they are using ubuntu! I know that ubuntu is based on debian, but wonder how big the differences are? what would look new for me?
2011-06-28T09:18:00.000Z	ttiicc		could anyone please answer my question
