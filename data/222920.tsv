2005-11-19T06:27:00.000Z	crube		Hey I was wondering if anyone knows a good HowTo that could tell me how to get KDE and Gnome installed at the same time and not showing each other's programs.

2005-11-19T06:30:00.000Z	crube	nalioth	well this is actually a little bit of both. I'm using ubuntu but I want to test kde as well without having to mess anything up.
2005-11-19T06:31:00.000Z	nalioth	crube	kde has a built in menu editor, ask in #kubuntu
