2012-08-02T02:45:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	r3dLunchb0x	I know it gets annoying with all those munin-* processes firing!
2012-08-02T02:46:00.000Z	r3dLunchb0x	IntuitiveNipple	I just need it to send multiple emails about the same alert and quote the hostname correctly in the email.
2012-08-02T02:49:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	r3dLunchb0x	Fortunately it's not something I've had to dig into yet, but I'd have thought that was possible... if not, send to one email address which is a mailing-list or sends out copies on receipt (maybe using .procmailrc rules)
