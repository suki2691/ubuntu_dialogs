2009-04-17T19:07:00.000Z	antineko		Hey everyone - I'm running a script in etc/init.d/ at boot, which powers on a Ventrilo server, and I've added it to Sessions. Now, it's working, but it runs the script before my desktop has loaded (x/gnome etc.) and I don't want that. I want it to run after I've logged in
