2006-10-01T12:54:00.000Z	Mercutio78		With Rhythym box (which i am using in Ubuntu ;-)), i have to wait aaaaages each time i start it whilst it re-finds my extensive mp3 library.. why does it not store this info and only look for new ones?
2006-10-01T12:54:00.000Z	Mercutio78		am i doing something wrong?
2006-10-01T12:55:00.000Z	Mercutio78		okay.. so wrt RhythymBox "thats just the way it is"?
