2005-09-06T05:38:00.000Z	Zeaposs		I'm having little problem with ubuntu installation. Is there a way to install ubuntu on PC with only 32 MB of RAM ? When installation proceeds, it stops on loading additional components (it retrieves nic-firmware package, then tries to unpack it and goes into loop retrieve-unpack)
