2007-06-25T09:37:00.000Z	ether		hello
2007-06-25T09:39:00.000Z	ether		would there be any major problem with installing ubuntu on a hard drive of one computer, taking that hard drive out, and sticking it in another computer?
2007-06-25T09:39:00.000Z	Pelo	ether	 if they are the same hardware it will work, if not ... your guess is as good as mine
2007-06-25T09:40:00.000Z	Pelo	ether	why not just move the cd drive ...
