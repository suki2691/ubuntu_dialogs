2007-08-23T12:01:00.000Z	bulmer	Ben_Cs	you mean during boot? you can see it via ctrl+alt+f1  while booting
2007-08-23T12:02:00.000Z	Ben_Cs	bulmer	ctrl-alt-f1 shows login screen
2007-08-23T12:03:00.000Z	bulmer	Ben_Cs	yes, but during boot, everything that is happening is piped to that console, including at the time gnome is loaded
