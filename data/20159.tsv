2011-01-23T06:11:00.000Z	jags		hey I'm trying to setup my ubuntu machines to print onto my windows shared printer.  I set it all up.  I watch it send a 127k file when I'm printing a test page, on the windows machine that 127k file stops at 64k and the file size keeps increasing.  It was 64k/50MB by the time I purged the queue.  Any Ideas, it won't print from ubuntu?
