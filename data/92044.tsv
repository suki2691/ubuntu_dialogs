2012-05-16T22:34:00.000Z	pgib	L3top	kkrauss, the closest I could get is using TwinView on two monitors, and another monitor as a standalone X screen. This was _tolerable_ however - all the window managers treat the "twinviewed" monitors as a single screen - so things like window maximization and positioning just plain don't work.
