2012-06-07T23:27:00.000Z	halfmt	truepurple	there should be a list of ppas under "Other Software" when you look at the "Software Sources" dialog.  Also I think delac is referring to your screenshot, where the VLC DailyDev PPA is selected in the left pane.  He's suggesting select the top level in those choices, I think...
