2012-01-05T07:05:00.000Z	r000t_mlt		Hello. I left the house thinking I could SSH into my public facing box, then SSH into the studio box next to it. I can SSH into my public box, but I can't SSH into the studio, as SSHd isn't installed. Is there ANY other way to get into it or install SSHd remotely?
