2009-03-23T13:45:00.000Z	santiago		excuse me for my poor english management, i need to compile the binary of the new Battle of Wesnoth 1.6
2009-03-23T13:45:00.000Z	binarymutant	santiago	is that the brand new update?
2009-03-23T13:47:00.000Z	binarymutant	santiago	I'm not sure since I haven't seen the new release but it should just be `./configure` `make` `sudo make install`
