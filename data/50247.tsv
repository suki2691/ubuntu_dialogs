2009-08-24T03:56:00.000Z	linxeh	ryan122	being completely biased, at the moment, no
2009-08-24T03:57:00.000Z	ryan122	linxeh	what would be a good cert or if not any cert, then what would be a good starting place? mind you i am finishing my MBA...but i really want to work with linux
2009-08-24T03:58:00.000Z	linxeh	ryan122	I'm biased because every shop seems to be using redhat, or at least centos atm. at some point ubuntu will probably dent that if it hasn't already. I guess lots of it depends on where you want to work though. this is really fodder for #ubuntu-offtopic though :-)
