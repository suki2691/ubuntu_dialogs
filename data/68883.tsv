I've just installed Ubuntu, but asked the install not to install grub, as ubuntu is on my second HD, and I have Windows on my first HD with grub installed there. Pb is that my previous linux install was fedora not Ubuntu, so now when i boot, I have "grub error 22". is there a rescue mode to allow me to reinstall the grub loader on my windows hd ?
