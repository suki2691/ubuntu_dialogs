I had it set up so that if the hard drive was plugged in, it would be higher in the boot order than my regular drive, and so would give me my regular GRUB boot menu.  If it wasn't plugged in, it would boot straight to Vista.  This worked for a while, but for some reason, on my last reboot, Vista was gone from the boot options in
