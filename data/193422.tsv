2006-05-19T11:59:00.000Z	iNiku		guys, quick question: if you want to dual boot XP and ubuntu, is there any reason not to install grub in the MBR?
2006-05-19T11:59:00.000Z	iNiku		a friend is worried XP will break somehow if grub is installed in the MBR. works fine for me, so is there any basis for his fear?
2006-05-19T12:01:00.000Z	Kennie	iNiku	: if it failes use the install cd and press r (repair) and type fixmbr
