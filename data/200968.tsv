2006-07-30T12:52:00.000Z	rbond		Question: I am really having a strange problem with Mplayer. The problem is that when I use XV acceleration the video will play slowly. The video does not appear to be choppy. I have verified that I have updated my ATI drivers to 3D acceleration via fglrxinfo. Also xvinfo shows my adapter being listed. The machine has been restarted as well. Can anyone please tell me what is going on?
