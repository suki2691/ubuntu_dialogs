2010-07-21T04:15:00.000Z	A-Non		Okay it's been a bit so I'll review the issue I've been trying to solve: Trying to install ubuntu I get an error "(intramfs) Unable to find a medium containing a live file system" before the CD menu. Checksum on the ISO checks out, the image verifies in IMGBurn (burning on an XP machine), so I'd say the disk is fine. Wubi doesn't work, gives me an error that loops "There is no disk in the drive. Please insert a disk into drive \Device\Harddisk1\DR2."

If you use the netinstall CD then the installer should at least not complain, though it may not be able to see your hard drive (you don't actually need to netboot, just booting the netboot CD will work).
