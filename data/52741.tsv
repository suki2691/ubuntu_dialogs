2009-07-11T23:05:00.000Z	minimec	darlykaiser	you mean if you could use firefox 3.0 and firefox 3.5 in paralell with you same properties? Yes. Even if I don't use 3.5 permanently, all my configuration was present, like in 3.0.
2009-07-11T23:18:00.000Z	darlykaiser	minimec	also can Xubuntu 9.04 can use firefox3.5?
2009-07-11T23:20:00.000Z	minimec	darlykaiser	Why not? The difference between Xubuntu and Ubuntu is basically the WIndowsEnvironment used. Xfce for Xubuntu; Gnome for Ubuntu --> KDE for Kubuntu.
