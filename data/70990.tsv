2008-12-21T00:37:00.000Z	Dulichion		Having a bit of a newb problem here, it seems my Gnome only has 2 available desktops instead of 4, how can I make it 4?
2008-12-21T00:38:00.000Z	skinner	Dulichion	right click on the panels at the bottom and set it for 4
2008-12-21T00:38:00.000Z	Dulichion	skinner	 deleted that bar, using AWN instead
2008-12-21T00:41:00.000Z	Dulichion	skinner	 thank you, where is it then curiously
