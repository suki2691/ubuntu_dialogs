2004-11-25T07:18:00.000Z	Matt|	JDahl	i get around 400 with my crappy ati card with dri enabled
2004-11-25T07:19:00.000Z	JDahl	Matt|	how would a Radeon Mobility 9000 stack up against your card? I would expect more than 280fps
2004-11-25T07:20:00.000Z	Matt|	JDahl	yeah i'm thinking better, but I really don't know
