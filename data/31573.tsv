2010-05-20T09:01:00.000Z	SamuelPeterson	ekkimargni	Yeah, I installed it and SSH was added to the "Connect to Server" gui
2010-05-20T09:02:00.000Z	ekkimargni	SamuelPeterson	Although, if you're using a GUI, nautilus will talk sftp to the server, and gedit can edit through that
2010-05-20T09:03:00.000Z	SamuelPeterson	ekkimargni	yeah, that's what I started doing. I enjoy mounting remote file systems for programming work.
