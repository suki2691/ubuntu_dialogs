2006-08-12T12:10:00.000Z	Mitrovarr		hey, I'm trying to rip cds to mp3s with sound-juicer, and for some reason the files it produces are horribly mangled (10x larger than they should be, don't work).  Anyone do it successfully?
2006-08-12T12:10:00.000Z	chaddy	Mitrovarr	10x bigger, are they .wav files?
2006-08-12T12:13:00.000Z	Mitrovarr	chaddy	 They don't play in anything, not even when renamed to .wav, so I don't think so.
