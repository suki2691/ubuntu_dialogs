2008-12-22T05:28:00.000Z	iratik		Can someone please give me a hand ?  I need someone to check their /etc/auth-client-config/profile.d directory for an "example_local" profile within one of the files.. I need that entry to restore the authentication system back to its "pre ldap/nss" glory
2008-12-22T05:29:00.000Z	iratik		Just anyone please... "cd /etc/auth-client-config/profile.d; grep -R example_local . " ?

2008-12-22T05:29:00.000Z	iratik	ASULutzy	you may not ... but thanks for looking?
