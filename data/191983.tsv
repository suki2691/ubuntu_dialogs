2006-06-01T15:24:00.000Z	mind		hello, sorry for the huge copy paste earlier Seveas, it won't happen again
2006-06-01T15:25:00.000Z	mind		so i've followed the instructions i've received from the link about installing the nvidia drivers, everything went ok, i logged off and rebooted the PC (just to make sure).
2006-06-01T15:26:00.000Z	mind		just before the login screen the nvidia logo splash screen appeared, and everything went a-ok. but now, i cannot find the nvidia settings and i still can't modify the refresh rates. can anyone help ? thanks
