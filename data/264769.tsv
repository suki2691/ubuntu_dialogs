I *think* it happens more often when I load pages with java, but then am not really sure it's ffox.  Would like to know how to find the culprit with some tool, like htop or some such.
2007-12-06T23:29:00.000Z	mojo	MasterShrek	okay, I can do that.  What am I looking for to help figure out the cause of the load?
2007-12-06T23:30:00.000Z	mojo	MasterShrek	what should I sort TOP on?
2007-12-06T23:33:00.000Z	mojo	MasterShrek	I think it's CPU%... yeah, CPU%
