2009-10-04T02:39:00.000Z	tpw_rules		i've installed kdevelop on my system and i can't get it to build executables. I start with the 'simple c++ hello world' example, hit compile and after a lot of crunching it says 'Configure: error: c++ compiler cannot create executables'. do i have to install anything else?
