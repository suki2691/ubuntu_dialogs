2009-09-11T05:26:00.000Z	djanatyn_		leaf-green: I currently have WinXP and xubuntu dual booting using GRUB. Will simply deleting the xubuntu partition using the live CD cause WinXP to boot on default?

2009-09-11T05:29:00.000Z	Flannel	djanatyn_	You need to replace the windows bootloader (ideally).  You should ask in ##windows if there's any easy way to do that.  If there isn't, there's some more options we have (we can always use GRUB by itself, without a full linux install, that just requires some manual things)
