2007-12-20T12:16:00.000Z	theTrav		hello.  I got a free iPod shuffle from work today.  Anyone know if there's a iTunes alternative that I can use on ubuntu?
2007-12-20T12:16:00.000Z	theTrav		that will be able to connect to the ipod I should say
2007-12-20T12:17:00.000Z	plattypus1	theTrav	I'll tell you if you tell me what kind of office gives out free iPods. :)
