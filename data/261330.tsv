2006-05-27T16:01:00.000Z	t35t0r		I'm trying to install themes from gnome-look.org and after downloading the theme and going to -> system -> theme manager and trying to install the tar.gz file it always says the file format is invalid. I can however tar tvfz the file and see the contents ..does this work for anyone else? how else are these themes supposed to be installed?

2006-05-27T16:03:00.000Z	t35t0r	tim_	ok i'll try it that way
