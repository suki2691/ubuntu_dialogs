2008-08-29T15:32:00.000Z	eitri	pajamian	honestly, I have no clue to that.. But worked for me :)
2008-08-29T15:33:00.000Z	pajamian	eitri	when I tried it in feisty, I had to install a seperate copy of 32 bit FF just to get flash and java to work properly.  the 32 bit plugin wrapper didn't work for me.
