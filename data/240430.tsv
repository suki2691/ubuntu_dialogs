2009-02-21T00:40:00.000Z	bryguy_		all I see is /etc/network/interfaces, which lists eth0 as the primary connection; the only network interface I have right now is eth1 (wireless card)
2009-02-21T00:41:00.000Z	bryguy_		I'm thinking maybe there's a disconnect where it's expecting eth0 and ignoring eth1 when it doesn't find eth0 (which was a pcmcia card I've since removed)
