2007-12-25T01:45:00.000Z	vxworks		did anyone have problems with hidden APs and wpa_supplicant? I got a intel 3945 card. I installed iwlwifi driver, Im running wpa_supplicant, but it cannot connect to hidden APs! Please help me!
2007-12-25T01:46:00.000Z	crimsun	vxworks	using wpa_supplicant directly (and not network-manager)?
2007-12-25T01:47:00.000Z	vxworks	crimsun	wpa_supplicant directly
2007-12-25T01:50:00.000Z	crimsun	vxworks	did you configure /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf correctly?
