2010-02-22T04:33:00.000Z	FourierSeries		Greetings! Question: v 9.10. Auto login - works fine from boot. However if I log off I expect it auto login again. It does not - I just get a login screen. Is it possible to force it to auto login always?

2010-02-22T04:39:00.000Z	hunt	FourierSeries	I used to have this configuration, I just cant remember how I got there
