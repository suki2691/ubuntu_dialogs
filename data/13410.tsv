2011-10-18T06:23:00.000Z	ejv	JokesOnYou77	it's bytes, although you can specify sizes using M or G
2011-10-18T06:27:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	ejv	I'm more concerned with this begin indicative of some larger problem, or misunderstanding on my part. And MB vs MiB was my original question
2011-10-18T06:27:00.000Z	ejv	JokesOnYou77	i would just proceed and not worry abou tit
