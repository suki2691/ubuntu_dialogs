2007-05-25T07:02:00.000Z	LjL	JABJabJAB	equivs is easy to use, basically you just edit a little file to list all the dependencies you want included, then fire up equivs-build (or whatever it's called), and there you have the .deb
2007-05-25T07:04:00.000Z	LjL	JABJabJAB	specifically, the procedure is 1) run  equivs-control <filename> , where filename is a name of your choice  2)  nano <filename> , and change as needed   3)  equivs-build <filename>   4)  sudo dpkg -i <packagename.deb>
