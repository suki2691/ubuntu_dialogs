2009-10-18T11:22:00.000Z	alokito	mimiloon	why would u need that? I think ubuntu has most of the apps current version where debian stable has the older versions
2009-10-18T11:23:00.000Z	mimiloon	alokito	because some of the software that i need are available in debian repositories; (or can you help me locate all the repositories list on one page plz?)
