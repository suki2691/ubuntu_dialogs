2010-10-26T02:34:00.000Z	Acer_		I was tampering with user permissions on /usr ... now the system doesn't boot. I don't know if that's the cause of problems or something else... I gave access to that folder only to root user, and for 'everyone else' I gave them None
2010-10-26T02:35:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Acer_	what did you type with permissions?
2010-10-26T02:47:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Acer_	not format it, just set up while installing again to /home
2010-10-26T02:48:00.000Z	zaxonspox	Acer_	mount it again, do NOT format
