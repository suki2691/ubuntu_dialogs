2007-08-16T07:47:00.000Z	lmosher		I'm on the Ubuntu liveCD and GParted is driving me -crazy-. I'm doing some operations on my primary disk (resizing/moving/copying partitions) and the stupid thing keeps MOUNTING the drive as soon as an operation finishes, which means GParted can't finish cleanly (it would normally check to make sure it went OK).
2007-08-16T07:47:00.000Z	lmosher		Is there any way to make it -stop- automounting my drive so gparted can finish what it's doing?
