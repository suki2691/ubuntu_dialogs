2011-04-01T02:53:00.000Z	jmwpc	zertyui	what is the question, exactly? Are you asking what that does?
2011-04-01T02:56:00.000Z	jmwpc	zertyui	it should insert a row into a database table called 'domain'... that's about it.
2011-04-01T03:01:00.000Z	jmwpc	zertyui	that does the same thing as the other command, just in a different table. You would probably have better luck with these types of questions in the #mysql channel
