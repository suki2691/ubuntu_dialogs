2006-05-27T14:35:00.000Z	dabaR	wizzlefish	aptitude works too, and better in some respects
2006-05-27T14:36:00.000Z	wizzlefish	dabaR	I'm just removing GNOME and KDE (and then reinstalling them) - should I use aptitude or apt-get?
2006-05-27T14:36:00.000Z	dabaR	wizzlefish	aptitude is my answer most of the time, unless you really know what you are doing.
