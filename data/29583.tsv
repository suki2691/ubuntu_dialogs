2010-07-01T05:27:00.000Z	reedsw	Firefishe	as far as I knew it removed everything. I swapped out till i ran into xfce and havent gone any further
2010-07-01T05:27:00.000Z	reedsw	Firefishe	and if I was questionable on it I ran sudo apt-get autoremove and then say that it would remove the libs that went with it
2010-07-01T05:28:00.000Z	Firefishe	reedsw	Thank you.  I ran into this problem the last time I installed the distro.  This helps for future reference.
