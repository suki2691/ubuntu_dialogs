2010-07-07T00:58:00.000Z	Proz		Hello, I jsut finished installing tux racer.
2010-07-07T00:58:00.000Z	Proz		However, when I click it from the games menu, it wont start
2010-07-07T00:58:00.000Z	Proz		No error message, no response what so ever. Would anyone know what might cause that
2010-07-07T00:59:00.000Z	leagris	Proz	you may get more error output by launching tuxracer within a shell window
