2007-05-19T08:25:00.000Z	boxrocks		can anybody tell me why my client hangs after a while, only when at higher resolutions? (1280x1024=crash, 1024x768=fine)
2007-05-19T08:27:00.000Z	boxrocks		hummmm, it's a new LCD, running on a ~high-end DevonIT thin-client
2007-05-19T08:28:00.000Z	stefg	boxrocks	not enough shared vmem assigned to the video?
2007-05-19T08:30:00.000Z	stefg	boxrocks	network saturation might be an issue if it's thin client... not enough bandwidth to push 1280 rekiably over the network
