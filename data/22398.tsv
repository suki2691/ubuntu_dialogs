2010-11-23T10:43:00.000Z	jascal_		I am back with the problem with my RAT3 Mouse: I did the update and the problem still presists. I have the xorg.conf modified, as well as the Xmodmap file. Whenever I want to chage programs or windows I have to right click on something that was inuse before hand... ANY Ideas?
