2008-12-16T01:00:00.000Z	david_	DasEI	yes but supposedly unebootin doesnt save the changes?
2008-12-16T01:02:00.000Z	DasEI	david_	which changes ? if you just shrink the system-iso-parti to lets say 1 gig, don't touch mbr, add a new parti ~ 95 g , fine ?! Ward1983
2008-12-16T01:03:00.000Z	david_	DasEI	the website says it alters grub or lilo or whatever bootloader your using but not permanently
