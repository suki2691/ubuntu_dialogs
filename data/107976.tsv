2008-01-06T21:38:00.000Z	chazco		Can anyone tell me if the Gusty install CD has been updated since its release? The current one downloads approx 150 updates totally over 200MB each install, which is a problem...
2008-01-06T21:39:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	chazco	Why is it a problem? (HughesNet, probably, because their limit is 200mb)
2008-01-06T21:40:00.000Z	chazco	syntaxerror55	- Because in the UK almost all ISP's have FUP... these mean that if you download too much you get your speed cut / disconnected... 200MB of updates on several machines can eaisly hit this limit
2008-01-06T21:40:00.000Z	syntaxerror55	chazco	ok.
