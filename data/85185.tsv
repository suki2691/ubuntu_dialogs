2011-01-09T03:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	The-Kernel	 ages ago i saw an artical by  the 'linux journal' or 'linux gazette' magazine that covered that topic. tey even showed how to do it with a 'server' that had no actual ip (some how) so the hackers couldent even see/access the 'syslog server' :)  but that was a few years back i read that.
2011-01-09T03:39:00.000Z	The-Kernel	Dr_Willis	well 10.10 uses rsyslog now, and I can't find anything on that
2011-01-09T03:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	The-Kernel	 yep. that may be totally differnt.
