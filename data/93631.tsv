2008-04-25T10:13:00.000Z	bcgrown		I am using the nvidia-glx-new driver with a Geforce fx 5500 and on my tv-out it only shows the top left corner of my screen (1024x768,  tv is supposed to be at 640x480).  how do i show the whole screen on my TV?  I have overscan set to zero

2008-04-25T10:14:00.000Z	bcgrown	jtmonz	i've been there, there's nothing to adjust that makes it work
2008-04-25T10:14:00.000Z	jtmonz	bcgrown	hmm, sorry... ati here :(
