2009-05-01T21:03:00.000Z	remu	pepperjack	how can i add the resolution to that file?
2009-05-01T21:05:00.000Z	pepperjack	remu	bear in mind that this is kinda the manual solution. there may be a better graphical tool solution.  so you would open then file using a text editor but you need admin rights to move it to /etc/X11/ and then edit it so like sudo mv /home/remu/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf   then sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf  and near the bottom should be a Section 'Screen'  with resolutions listed
