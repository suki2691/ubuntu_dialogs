2009-12-12T19:01:00.000Z	misterB	dns53	It's on an NTFS formatted external drive.
2009-12-12T19:06:00.000Z	dns53	misterB	it seems like there is something wrong with the drive, connect it to windows and do a checkdisk or unmount it in linux and use fsck.ntfs to check it
2009-12-12T19:06:00.000Z	misterB	dns53	will try that, but it might be worth mentioning that the problem is only with one folder
