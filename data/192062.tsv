2006-04-04T12:30:00.000Z	Vspirit		uhmm.. I've found ubuntuguide.org, and I issue a 'sudo apt-get install sun-j2rel-5' but it simply complains with 'E: Couldn't find package sun-j2rel.5' what are my options ?
2006-04-04T12:30:00.000Z	frank23	Vspirit	don't use ubuntuguide. It's old and unsafe
2006-04-04T12:30:00.000Z	frank23		!tell Vspirit about java
