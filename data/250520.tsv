2005-08-23T14:22:00.000Z	rowanjl		Hey guys, I'm trying to solve a bug that keeps happening with new Linux distros (Fedora Core 4, 4.10 and now 5.4). I've filed the bug report for Fedora (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=165192) but so far the problem is unsolved. Anyone want to take a look and see if they can reproduce it? Any information would be useful
2005-08-23T14:23:00.000Z	rowanjl		If anyone can think of a way to reproduce the bug, after the system is set up, let me know :)
2005-08-23T14:24:00.000Z	rowanjl		I have a feeling it might be something to do with newer kernels, as FC3 didn't do it. I can't say for Ubuntu versions before 4.10
2005-08-23T14:24:00.000Z	Dreamer31	rowanjl	what?
