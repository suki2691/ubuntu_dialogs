2006-12-28T11:42:00.000Z	Maheanuu		I have been wondering if I should try the latest distro even tho it's a beta....  I would want the 64 bit version for AMD tho, and am not sure if it would work any better than the Dapper one

2006-12-28T11:43:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	Maheanuu	try Edgy 64 then.  I have it running right now :D
