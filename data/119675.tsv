2008-04-22T03:13:00.000Z	bent_		Hey, for the third and final time #ubuntu, does anyone know of a usb wireless card that works out of the box? (I'm running 8.04, by the way... if that changes stuff.)
2008-04-22T03:14:00.000Z	bent_		I'm seriously going out and buying a card.
2008-04-22T03:14:00.000Z	bazhang	bent_	for the next couple of days best ask in hardy channel
2008-04-22T03:15:00.000Z	bent_	bazhang	Eh. I'd hope that no one truely wrecked the connection stuff between 7.10 and 8.04... and nothing happened really when I asked there.
