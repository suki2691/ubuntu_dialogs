2010-01-22T03:58:00.000Z	NoobUser		Will Ubuntu warn me before my HDD dies so that I can buy a new one and transfer the data over?
2010-01-22T03:59:00.000Z	zleap	NoobUser	not sure but it does run fsck every x number of reboots, i would advise you to let this run rather than pressing esc to quite (would people agree)
2010-01-22T04:00:00.000Z	NoobUser	zleap	I always let it run. I'm talking about HDD failue, not filesystem failure.
2010-01-22T04:00:00.000Z	zleap	NoobUser	i guess if a hdd makes lots of horrible creaking noises that could be a start
