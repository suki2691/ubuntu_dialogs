2005-12-23T15:22:00.000Z	nomin		has anyone had sound problems with ubuntu breezy?  I installed ubuntu for the first time a couple days and sound worked fine from the start.  I had to reinstall ubuntu today because I have triple boot and it messed up.  Now I get sound effects but no music.  I don't understand why.
