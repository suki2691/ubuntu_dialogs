2009-10-30T04:17:00.000Z	foxray		hi having an issue with karmic UNR on my dell mini 9, I installed it, but no ethernet shows up
2009-10-30T04:18:00.000Z	michaelpalone	foxray	You have no connections at all? have you tried wired?
2009-10-30T04:18:00.000Z	foxray	michaelpalone	its like it doesn't even see the wireless at all
2009-10-30T04:19:00.000Z	foxray	michaelpalone	the wireless controller is supposed to show up as a proprietary driver, karmic doesn't even recognize it
