2010-03-27T19:49:00.000Z	Nexeh		I had Compiz working great on Ubuntu 9.10. I had the full desktop effect, Desktop Cube, and all the fancy fun stuff. I was working on something completely unrelated and my desk top ended up freezing. I was still able to get to the terminal through ctrl-alt-F2 which i eventually rebooted the machine through. When the machine came back up it was in no effects mode and would not enable any desktop effects now.
2010-03-27T19:49:00.000Z	Nexeh		I have since tried many thing found in forums and feel that i'm worst off now than i was before. I started by following a guide for installing the proprietary ATI drivers for my Videocard. When i downloaded ati-driver-installer-9-3-x86.x86_64.run and went to package it for 9.10 it only supported up to 9.04. So being deperate i went for it.
2010-03-27T19:49:00.000Z	Nexeh		It didn't work :P. So i followed a guide for removing the driver and everything went exactly as the guide said but now when i restart the computer i get a ubuntu popup box that says "failed to load fglrx module" This must mean there is some remnace of the setting to use the driver.I have tried so manything to fix this and can't. Heres some more misc information
