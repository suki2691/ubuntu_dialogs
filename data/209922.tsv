2008-11-18T18:28:00.000Z	LjL	tuesday_flounder	"cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep flags", see if there is the "lm" flag

2008-11-18T18:54:00.000Z	LjL	tuesday_flounder	one thing is saying that you're *running* the 32-bit version of Ubuntu, another thing is saying that you *have* a 64-bit processor. you asked about the latter.
