2011-04-05T20:23:00.000Z	elarson_		hi all, I had two questions about running 10.10 or 11.04 on a new macbook pro (8,2). 1) I've read a couple forum posts on wireless being an issue, so would 11.04 be a better bet than 10.10 b/c of the newer hardware? 2) Does anyone have any experience with the macbook pro freezes and does that happen in linux as well?
