2008-04-04T00:52:00.000Z	fxfitz		I'm using Ubuntu on a laptop, and whenever my laptop is idle for ten minutes (like when I'm watching a movie), the screen turns blank. I have turned off all my screensavers, but the problem persists. Can anyone help?

2008-04-04T00:54:00.000Z	sculework		disable screen blanking or such
2008-04-04T00:54:00.000Z	fxfitz	sculework	But it's not JUST movies. Like even if I leave my laptop idle (not doing anything), the screen turns blank, and I do not want that to happen
