2009-01-08T03:41:00.000Z	Logomachist		But Grub still doesn't take over at boot.
2009-01-08T03:41:00.000Z	Ward1983	Logomachist	windows xp or vista?
2009-01-08T03:42:00.000Z	Ward1983	Logomachist	sorry dunno for xp, but for vista you can add grub in its bootloader and that works fine, i had to do that once
