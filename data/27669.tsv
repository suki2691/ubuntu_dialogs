I've been running Ubuntu on my first generation macbook pro for years without problems, (often with less ventalation than I should :) and have had no problems. But it's supposedly newer macs that are more affected.
2010-09-27T07:07:00.000Z	Avo	Jordan_U	Mhmm. The whole thing makes no sense to me on a technical level. Since when does the software OS manage the processor voltage anyhow..
