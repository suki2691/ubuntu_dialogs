2007-06-25T14:34:00.000Z	kaktuskatta		Hi I need some help with my webcam. It's a Logitech Quickcam Messenger, but I'm unable to get it to work
2007-06-25T14:35:00.000Z	kaktuskatta		And now I accidently overwrote the settings on /dev/video0, so my TV-tuner doesn't work anymore !
2007-06-25T14:36:00.000Z	kaktuskatta		anyone with webcam experience here?
