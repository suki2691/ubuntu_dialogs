2009-04-26T17:06:00.000Z	walen	vinoman	compiz-fusion-icon maybe, there you can alter the settings
2009-04-26T17:07:00.000Z	walen	vinoman	or just system->prefeferences-> compizconfig manager
2009-04-26T17:08:00.000Z	walen	vinoman	yes, it should be available by sudo apt-get install compiz-fusion-icon
