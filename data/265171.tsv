2004-09-28T15:59:00.000Z	azeem	punkass_	somebody from canonical was working on it AFAIK, dunno if it's getting integrated
2004-09-29T16:00:00.000Z	punkass_	azeem	i am trying to build it right now but it keeps saying it cant find the kernel sources
2004-09-29T16:01:00.000Z	punkass_	azeem	it told me to link build to /usr/src/linux-x.x.x and i did that..but still the same error
