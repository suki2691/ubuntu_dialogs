2006-02-24T13:06:00.000Z	intelikey	RichART1	are you planing on using the partition/s or making new ones ?
2006-02-24T13:08:00.000Z	intelikey	RichART1	if you are going to use the linux partition/s simple wat is mkfs.ext3 the partition.  else  c/fdisk  is the answer.     but be advised that if you use grub you may not be able to boot after such actions.
