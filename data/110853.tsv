2012-06-14T20:06:00.000Z	Dshoe_		hey guys, just wondering if this partition set up sounds good
2012-06-14T20:06:00.000Z	Dshoe_		swap/system reserved/win7/ubuntu
2012-06-14T20:06:00.000Z	Dshoe_		I want to play with the partition sizes between win7 and ubuntu
2012-06-14T20:07:00.000Z	h00k	Dshoe_	that looks good as far as layout, as long as your sizes are appropriate
