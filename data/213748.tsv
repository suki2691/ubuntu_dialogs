2006-11-04T13:14:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vivabenfica	Very little.  I have 250 MB, but that's for the possibility of a bunch of kernels and splash images.  100 MB is plenty.
2006-11-04T13:17:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vivabenfica	swap definitely can; boot I'm not sure about
2006-11-04T13:21:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	vivabenfica	I also would suspect that it can, I just haven't tried it
