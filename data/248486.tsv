2006-07-06T07:13:00.000Z	Intelligi		I am having a huge problem with crashing. I think my computer is on its last leg. It has to either be the CPU or the hard drive. Right before it crashes, I can hear the hard drive make some noise, like it is either slowing down or trying to start spinning again. It was doing this under Windows too.
