2012-08-12T18:35:00.000Z	pip__		has anyone had any success in running gnome shell off a base xubuntu install?  It's a long story....
2012-08-12T18:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pip__	 you should be able to install it..
2012-08-12T18:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	pip__	 you could have a dozen de's installed if you wanted. but you can get a lot of extra apps that way. but they should all work
2012-08-12T18:43:00.000Z	pip__	Dr_Willis	okay, thanks.  I've ended up with an odd situation allowing me to run a more graphically intensive DE & I like Gnome shell
