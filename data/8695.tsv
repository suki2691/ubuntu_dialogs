2011-10-17T22:46:00.000Z	JoshMnem		I've been using Ubuntu since Warty Warthog, but I'm completely lost in 11.10. I tried add gnome-panel back, but I can't right click on anything to put quickstart icons on the menu bar. Also, all the options are gone to change the theme, e.g., move the close buttons back to the top right corner of the windows. Anyone know if there is a way to fix those things?
