2011-04-19T18:01:00.000Z	boomboorum	ThinkT510	 Yes,  I need update to 11.04 but that computer has no connection to internet. I need to to it from another computer and then just pass the packages to the computer without internet. I know that with keryx I can update and install programs but just was wanring if I could do a distro upgrade.
