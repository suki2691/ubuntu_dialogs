2006-04-15T08:16:00.000Z	Hedos		Hey guys. I've got this ACPI problem with Ubuntu. My laptop won't boot unless I set acpi=off.. but my network connection doesn't work, most likely because of that. Any idea what should I do?
2006-04-15T08:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Hedos	 i got a bios update that fixed all my laptop problems. :P
2006-04-15T08:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Hedos	 this was for my Compaq V2311
2006-04-15T08:19:00.000Z	Hedos	Dr_Willis	ok, I got an acer laptop, but that seems like a good idea, I'll try upgrading my BIOS, thanks.
