2012-08-07T13:13:00.000Z	Wicla		Hello.. Are it possible to disable GPG checking for a specific APT repository?
2012-08-07T13:13:00.000Z	bazhang	Wicla	why would you ever need to do that
2012-08-07T13:15:00.000Z	Wicla	bazhang	it's for a custom repository in enterprise environment. But that's unimportant isn't it. Was that a statement that it's not possible?
2012-08-07T13:15:00.000Z	bazhang	Wicla	3rd party repo? PPA? what is it
