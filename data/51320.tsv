2012-10-23T01:18:00.000Z	alos22		hello i am looking for an ubuntu version with gnome 3.6 and gnome shell
2012-10-23T01:18:00.000Z	trism	alos22	12.10 has gnome 3.6.1 and gnome-shell
2012-10-23T01:19:00.000Z	trism	alos22	not by default of course, unless you get the remix iso
2012-10-23T01:21:00.000Z	trism	alos22	this is the remix https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGNOME/ReleaseNotes/12.10 (it's in universe so as official as xubuntu I suppose)
