2009-05-08T22:45:00.000Z	quaal		i just installed 9.04 and now whenever i go to places/one of the directories listed, it opens rhythymbox instead of opening the place i just clicked. how the hell did this happen
2009-05-08T22:45:00.000Z	quaal		rhythymbox is garbage
2009-05-08T22:46:00.000Z	quaal		why is it even installed by default
