2010-10-13T22:56:00.000Z	bxf4		Hello, just installed 10.10 on MacBookPro1,1 and lost F11 and F12 as button 2 and button 3.  Anyone fixed this already?
2010-10-13T22:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bxf4	is there a bug logged for it?
2010-10-13T22:58:00.000Z	bxf4	ActionParsnip	Not sure, thought it might have just moved.
2010-10-13T22:58:00.000Z	bxf4	ActionParsnip	 I think I know how to check.
