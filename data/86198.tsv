2008-07-07T20:20:00.000Z	efdeeWRK_		i'm on an EEE with a relatively small swap partition
2008-07-07T20:21:00.000Z	bazhang	efdeeWRK_	dont need swap for that see www.eeeuser.com wiki and #eeepc
2008-07-07T20:21:00.000Z	efdeeWRK_	bazhang	i'll check it out. it was telling me i couldn't hibernate cause of too small swap so i figured :)
