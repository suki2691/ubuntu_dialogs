2007-01-06T13:36:00.000Z	dstaudt	whyameye	yes, but if it's present in your user plugins folder too, it will over-ride
2007-01-06T13:37:00.000Z	whyameye	dstaudt	but I am getting no flash at all, so what is overriding?
2007-01-06T13:40:00.000Z	whyameye	dstaudt	newbieme: if I put libflashplayer.so in ~/.mozilla/plugins, then it works. If I put it in /usr/lib/firefox/plugins it doesn't work. I don't really understand why...
