2009-05-07T08:00:00.000Z	Mushuukyou		Question: My computer is currently partitioned with 40gigs on C:, and the rest (200 gigs) on D:.  How much drive space should I allocate towards Ubuntu, if I will be using VMware to run Windows to play games?  Is 40 gigs good enough on that one partition, or should I format the whole thing and redo the partitions to allow more for Ubuntu?
