2010-09-29T18:59:00.000Z	ost2life		a question about sleeping. I can get my computer to sleep from the keyboard or remote no problems at all, however I can't get the box to wake up without actually pressing the power button on it, there's no response to keyboard, mouse or remote control input
2010-09-29T18:59:00.000Z	ost2life		..so is there anyway to fix that?
