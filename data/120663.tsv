2008-06-20T08:59:00.000Z	jc__		I've got a spare HD I want to install windows on and make this computer a dual boot, is it easier to install windows with all the drives already installed and then reinstall grub, or remove my ubuntu drives, install windows and then tell grub where to find windows?
2008-06-20T09:00:00.000Z	danbhfive	jc__	imho, the first option
2008-06-20T09:01:00.000Z	jc__	danbhfive	is that because windows will complain to much if it do it the second way?
2008-06-20T09:02:00.000Z	danbhfive	jc__	no, grub will complain
