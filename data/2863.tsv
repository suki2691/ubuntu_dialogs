2012-05-26T04:35:00.000Z	EliahKagan	lcc	yes it's still supported, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFIBooting
2012-05-26T04:38:00.000Z	lcc	EliahKagan	so if I get a laptop with uefi firmware I can boot an ubuntu cd and install it, or is it a more complicated process? I'm reading the docs...
2012-05-26T04:39:00.000Z	EliahKagan	lcc	i don't think you should have any problems
