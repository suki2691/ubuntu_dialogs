2010-04-07T02:40:00.000Z	kwtm		Hi.  I'm used to Hardy 8.04.  I'm looking at, uhh,... (how do I know what version of Ubuntu I'm running?) Jaunty 9.04, I think.  How come the /etc/udev/rules.d directory is almost empty?  Is it supposed to be that way?  Is that info somewhere else now?  THere are about 30 files in my 8.04 installation,.

2010-04-07T02:47:00.000Z	kwtm	brontosaurusrex	Thank you.  Confirmed that I am running 9.04.  Where did the /etc/udev files go?
