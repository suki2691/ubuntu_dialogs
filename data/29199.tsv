2010-10-26T12:23:00.000Z	Spandi		Hello I wonder if anybody could help me. I had installed Ubuntu Karmic Kaola version on Windows Vista. It ran very well for some days and all of a sudden it just wouldn't boot. It shows up some few commands to choose from and thats all. I cant get into UBUNTU. Has anyone faced this problem before ?
