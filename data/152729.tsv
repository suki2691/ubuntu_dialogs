2009-08-27T21:02:00.000Z	sim_		is there anyway of automatically cleaning all the .config folders for the things i have uninstalled...they seem to remain there
2009-08-27T21:03:00.000Z	arand	sim_	I don't think so unfortunately.
2009-08-27T21:05:00.000Z	sim_	arand	is that like a bug...cos its really silly
2009-08-27T21:07:00.000Z	arand	sim_	by default no user-specific data is removed in the uninstallation process, that's just a rule in *nix I think, and very unlikely to change, suggestions are to add options to either apt or another program to abe able to do this, but they are only suggestions afaik.
