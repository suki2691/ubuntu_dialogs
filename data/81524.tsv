2009-11-09T17:21:00.000Z	doruk		How can I change Icons of running programs ? (On alt-tab menu and taskbar not the launchers) . I managed to do so for firefox but chromium's icon just doesn't change (I also changed /usr/icons/hicolor)  . Also is there a way to make default icon theme something other than hi-color.?
