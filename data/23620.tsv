2010-11-05T06:17:00.000Z	sofaking88		It has a brodcom wireless adapter, or something like that
2010-11-05T06:18:00.000Z	octopus	sofaking88	did you try installing the driver from "menu>preferences>additional drivers"?
2010-11-05T06:21:00.000Z	sofaking88	octopus	I think so. I connected to the ethernet cord, and went through an update. I had something pop up asking me to activate the wireless driver, so I did, but it didn't do anything.
