2008-03-14T22:32:00.000Z	bthornton		hmm... I have 4GB of RAM in my Pentium D system but Linux is only seeing 3.2GB of it. Is that a limitation of my OS or a limitation of my hardware?
2008-03-14T22:33:00.000Z	skarface	bthornton	is some of it set aside for graphics?
2008-03-14T22:34:00.000Z	bthornton	skarface	I'm not sure--but when I only had 2GB, none was set aside because the OS saw the full 2GB.
