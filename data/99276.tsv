2008-04-01T13:15:00.000Z	jimmy_		when i run 'wine AutoRun.exe' in NFS most wanted i get this error: err:service:service_get_status service protocol error - failed to read pipe r = 0  count = 0!  Could this be the reason that it can't see that directx is installed?

2008-04-01T13:21:00.000Z	jimmy_	hischild	why did u suggest to run a comment?
2008-04-01T13:21:00.000Z	hischild	jimmy_	i did not. I suggested you would try the channel of wine which i mistook for #wine instead of #winehq
