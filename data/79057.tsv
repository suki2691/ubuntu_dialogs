2008-12-06T16:19:00.000Z	Ohkie		my ubuntu seems to be stuck in a useless loop of logging in. i put in my username and password, the screen goes blank and i get returned to the username password screen. i went to the console (ctrl alt f1 or whatever it is) and tried logging in there and the same thing happens. what can i do to try and fix this?
