2007-02-03T17:48:00.000Z	AMAG		Speaking of fresh installs of 6.10, I have a brand new computer here with a 3ware 9650SX card that I could use some knowledgable help with!  :-)
2007-02-03T17:50:00.000Z	AMAG		I hear there is a Live CD; which is that?  I believe I could solve my problem by getting the live-from-CD system up and running, building a 3ware driver that loads into this kernel, copying it someplace, then loading it into the installer after a reboot.

2007-02-03T17:51:00.000Z	AMAG	Gunrun	I had some trouble booting the desktop CDs, but I can get the text installer going using the alternate CDs.  Any hints?
