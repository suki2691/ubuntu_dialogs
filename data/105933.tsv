2012-02-10T02:49:00.000Z	RedWar		Hey all, just a quick question.  Can I use in CLI grep just to show me the contents of directories and how would I structure the command?
2012-02-10T02:49:00.000Z	Bodsda	RedWar	you would use ls to show directory contents
2012-02-10T02:51:00.000Z	Bodsda	RedWar	yep    ls /var/log   for example
2012-02-10T02:51:00.000Z	Bodsda	RedWar	your welcome
