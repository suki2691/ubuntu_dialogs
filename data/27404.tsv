2010-08-14T22:39:00.000Z	bbadbill2		Anybody out there have any helpful ideas on how I can resolve my issue. winstonw suggested I run memtest and so far it has not found any errors after one full pass... I have been trying to install ubuntu from scratch on an old p4 shuttle but my fresh install is constantly getting stuck on configuring APT source at 71%

2010-08-14T22:42:00.000Z	bbadbill2	Rabbitbunny	how do i do that
2010-08-14T22:42:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	bbadbill2	I don't know. it's been about four years since I did that.
