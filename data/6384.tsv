2012-07-10T23:03:00.000Z	ses1984		ok, so i'm having trouble booting after upgrading to 12.04, it seems some grub stuff got messed up. previous versions of ubuntu were booting with the root=UUID=foo instead of root=/dev/sda1. apparently my drive is not coming up as /dev/sda1. but if i replace /dev/sda1 with UUID=foo, it still won't boot

2012-07-10T23:08:00.000Z	ses1984	escott	i'm not sure how to get a shell on initrd i only get as far as grub, or i can get farther with older versions of ubuntu. the uuid i tried to add to my new grub config is definitely there
