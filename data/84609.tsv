2008-07-29T06:42:00.000Z	lastnode		hi, i was just wondering whether the alternate-cd will let me encrypt my partitions during install?
2008-07-29T06:42:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer8	lastnode	that would take substantially longer to install, and really dont see a need for such
2008-07-29T06:44:00.000Z	lastnode	ManualOverDozer8	i see a need. i was just asking if it's possible?
2008-07-29T06:44:00.000Z	lastnode	ManualOverDozer8	i can setup crypto, and then use LVM to create partitions inside the crypto space?
