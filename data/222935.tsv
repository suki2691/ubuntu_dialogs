2007-05-01T08:26:00.000Z	GameCat		I am using Kubuntu and trying to compile a GTK+ app - which packages do I need for GTK+ compiling?
2007-05-01T08:27:00.000Z	GameCat		I get the error "checking for GTK+ - version >= 2.4.0... no" can anyone tell me what I'm missing?
2007-05-01T08:27:00.000Z	crimsun	GameCat	libgtk2.0-dev.
2007-05-01T08:28:00.000Z	GameCat	crimsun	terrific, thanks
