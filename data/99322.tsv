2008-02-24T22:48:00.000Z	hischild	acalbaza	there's a button more, please tell the error that comes along with it
2008-02-24T22:49:00.000Z	acalbaza	hischild	: there is no other button, but i do see another dialog that says "invalid mount option"
2008-02-24T22:50:00.000Z	hischild	acalbaza	is there any other info that can give us a hint to why it refuses to mount?
