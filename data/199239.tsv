2007-12-02T00:59:00.000Z	Hoxzer		How can I setup default interface. I have two intefaces in my computer setup and a bridge between them. How can I tell programs to use br0 instead of eth0 or etho 1
2007-12-02T01:00:00.000Z	thor	Hoxzer	I'm curious..where do you plug in the bridge on your computer?
2007-12-02T01:01:00.000Z	Hoxzer	thor	I have two interfaces in my mobo by default so I put my laptop's connection through my PC. That way if there is wireless connection available I can have wired connection for both laptop and desktop
2007-12-02T01:03:00.000Z	thor	Hoxzer	then on the laptop you will still use the ethx of the laptop...the desktop computer doesn't do any work ... it is just an ethernet bridge right?
