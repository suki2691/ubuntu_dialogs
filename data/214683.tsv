2005-10-23T09:33:00.000Z	paca		I just installed Breezy to another computer...  It told me that several packages were broken, so I tried to reinstall them with synaptic and it just failed with a bunch of errors.  What typically causes that?
2005-10-23T09:34:00.000Z	nalioth	paca	the repos are in a state of chaos atm
2005-10-23T09:34:00.000Z	paca	nalioth	I know, but it wasn't gpg errors it gave me.
2005-10-23T09:34:00.000Z	paca	nalioth	something about buffers and whatnot.
