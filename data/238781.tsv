2005-10-17T06:07:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32		I've installed ubuntu on a pc without network access... how do I keep it from taking 4 years to boot up?
2005-10-17T06:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	FlyingSquirrel32	 could try setting a static ip for it.
2005-10-17T06:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	FlyingSquirrel32	 it may be waiting on the dhcp server
2005-10-17T06:09:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	Dr_Willis	good idea.. I was thinking ofd disabling, but that may work.
