2011-12-06T14:44:00.000Z	mazda01	auronandace	that's sort of incorrect thing to say IMO
2011-12-06T14:45:00.000Z	auronandace	mazda01	howso? wubi is meant to be a demo or preview for those only comfortable with windows systems. (linux was never meant to be installed through windows)
2011-12-06T14:46:00.000Z	mazda01	auronandace	because something was "never meant" for something, that means it can become so? Was man meant to fly? was man meant to go into out space?
2011-12-06T14:47:00.000Z	mazda01	auronandace	wubi is meant for the lowly windows users who wants to try out ubuntu, and the ubuntu install from wubi can NOW be moved if so desired to it's own dual boot setup.
