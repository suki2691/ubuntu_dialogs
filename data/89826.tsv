2008-06-27T01:13:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		I got another strange question, is there any way to setup a server on Ubuntu 8.04 normal edition (not server)?... I need to setup a simple server on port 21 to transfer files to and from my guest os (Windows XP) from qemu.
2008-06-27T01:14:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		Are there any easy-to-setup FTP server apps?
