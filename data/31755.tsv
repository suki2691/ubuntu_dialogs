2012-10-01T17:00:00.000Z	TJ-	scatterp	I sent you several messages earlier about that device but you didn't respond
2012-10-01T17:01:00.000Z	TJ-	scatterp	It would be helpful if you could tell us the USB Vendor:Product ID of the device. If you've plugged it in on Ubuntu "lsusb" will show it. I'm looking at the Windows driver .inf file and there are 5 different IDs used in that product
