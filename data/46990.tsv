2010-03-04T01:15:00.000Z	unkmar		I downloaded 8.04 server iso, how can I confirm that I have the complete file without wasting a CD?
2010-03-04T01:16:00.000Z	Two4	unkmar	check the MD5sum of the .iso image against the website
2010-03-04T01:16:00.000Z	Two4	unkmar	are you running windows?
2010-03-04T01:21:00.000Z	unkmar	Two4	Official download via http from site. I didn't see any torrents listed, probably because I'm blocking google-analytics javascript code. Which is probably Google API stuff.
