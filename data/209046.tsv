2005-11-07T16:22:00.000Z	andi5	Nick_Hill	what about disabling sound? does that solve the issue reliably?
2005-11-07T16:24:00.000Z	Nick_Hill	andi5	NoUse I agree it is very important to isolate bugs and make good bug reports. But before I do that, I wanted to make sure it wasn't a general problem which has been unravelled.
