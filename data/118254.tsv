2008-01-02T07:25:00.000Z	Zoqaeski		I figured this would be the best place to ask a quick question on some networking issues I’ve been having with a fresh install of Gutsy
2008-01-02T07:26:00.000Z	Zoqaeski		For some reason, the network connection doesn’t work on Gutsy, yet it worked fine on 7.04
2008-01-02T07:27:00.000Z	crush_groove	Zoqaeski	 specifics are a good thing
