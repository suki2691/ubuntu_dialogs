2009-10-30T07:19:00.000Z	RPG_Master		If I want to replace an apps Icon, where should I put my icon I made?
2009-10-30T07:19:00.000Z	Marfi	RPG_Master	Anywhere. It defaults to /usr/share/Icons though
2009-10-30T07:20:00.000Z	RPG_Master	Marfi	But what do I name the file, so that it will replace the default icon everywhere?
2009-10-30T07:20:00.000Z	Marfi	RPG_Master	You should be able to click the launcher in the menu and edit it from there, and that should change it everywhere. You may need to go into appearence, though
