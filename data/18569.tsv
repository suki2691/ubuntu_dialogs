2011-02-02T12:11:00.000Z	SCooper		My VM is showing the haddrive I allocated it as hdb, but it doesn't seem to have liked the optical drive, even though it's loaded the iso.  How can I find out what the cd-rom is mounted as?

2011-02-02T12:14:00.000Z	SCooper	ActionParsnip	There are about a million things mounted anyway I can make that list line by line?
