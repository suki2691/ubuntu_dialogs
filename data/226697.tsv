2006-05-22T14:21:00.000Z	GeistDerZeit		Hey guy, i'm have a doubt about an error message from the following command: sudo cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc driveropts=burnfree -v -speed=2 -data /media/hda6/Downloads/Books.iso
2006-05-22T14:22:00.000Z	redguy	GeistDerZeit	will you share the error you get with us, or should we guess whaat the error is?
2006-05-22T14:23:00.000Z	redguy	GeistDerZeit	if it's more than 1 line don't paste in here?
2006-05-22T14:25:00.000Z	redguy	GeistDerZeit	maybe the cd disk's lowest record speed you are trying to write to is higher that the highest record speed of your cd writer, but this is just a wild guess
