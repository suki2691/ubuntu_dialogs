2011-11-02T02:40:00.000Z	Grundoko		Hey, I have a bit of a predicament here. I just ran sudo rm /*/*/*, and deleted everything 3 directories down from root. I was hoping I could get to the Trash and restore the files, but since I just deleted gnome-terminal and xterm, I can't use those. And I used Ctrl+Alt+F1 to enter the fallback terminal, but it turns out /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/sudo are gone, so I can't perform any commands. My computer is currently only useful
