2011-10-04T10:05:00.000Z	AlexLibman		I wasn't able to fix the problem I caused with `usermod -G wheel username` by running `usermod -G username username` - still says username not in sudoers.  All I did to /etc/sudoers is uncomment the wheel line.  What am I supposed to do exactly?
2011-10-04T10:07:00.000Z	AlexLibman		Also...  I got myself banned from the official Ubuntu forums for ranting (on appropriate threads) about Copyfree licenses being superior to Copyleft.  Now I have no place to get support for my system76 laptop...  Any suggestions for getting myself unbanned?
2011-10-04T10:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AlexLibman	i'd ask in #ubuntuforums maybe
