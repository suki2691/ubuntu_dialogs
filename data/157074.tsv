2006-11-27T08:10:00.000Z	DevC		hmm can't seem to uprade from 5.10 to 6.06 for some reason. cat /etc/issue says breezy badger5.10  but when I follow the directions for going to 6.06 I do the updates and still end up with 5.10 when I'm done :-/
2006-11-27T08:11:00.000Z	sod75	DevC	did you do a dist-upgrade ?
2006-11-27T08:15:00.000Z	DevC	sod75	I've been following the Upgrades site that they have up on ubuntu and I did the Breezy 5.10 upgrade now I'm tryin to do the 6.06 so I can go to the new 6.10
