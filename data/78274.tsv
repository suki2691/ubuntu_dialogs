2008-10-29T09:18:00.000Z	Bullen		i have a question about debian-specific apache that i got from apt-get, i want to edit my vhosts.conf file (as is common) but instead in debian, i have two different config files, one in sites-available and sites-enabled, what is the purpose of this and what should i think about while adding domains to these config files?
2008-10-29T09:19:00.000Z	rww	Bullen	are you running Ubuntu or Debian? If Debian, you should probably head over to #debian on irc.debian.org
2008-10-29T09:21:00.000Z	Bullen	rww	i'm running ubuntu on my home machine, debian on my vps, both have the same config.
