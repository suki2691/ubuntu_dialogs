2007-07-05T15:59:00.000Z	legalsized		Hi room. I'm installing Ubutu 6.10. I can ping out and get a response but all other internet connections won't work. Any suggestions?

2007-07-05T15:59:00.000Z	legalsized		does that answer your question?
2007-07-05T16:00:00.000Z	jo3nix	legalsized	are you in ubuntu, or are you on the live cd?
