2007-05-21T09:00:00.000Z	TeeO		hello all, i'm having difficulties getting tvtime to launch properly and i'm looking for some help...has anyone worked with this prog before?
2007-05-21T09:00:00.000Z	TeeO		when I go to launch it, it opens then immediately crashes
2007-05-21T09:01:00.000Z	ablyss	TeeO	open a Terminal and run it from there and see what the error is
2007-05-21T09:08:00.000Z	ablyss	TeeO	seems that tv chip set is problematic.. i searched google on your error.. i recommend you do the same
