2008-10-23T07:32:00.000Z	_786soul		Anyone here help me with this problem? I got ubuntu booting from an SD card along with backtrack 3 from grub. Everything boots correct but ubuntu won't get to the desktop, rather giving me a blank screen with a mouse. This is AFTER i log in with user and pass in the respective boxes. Any help?
