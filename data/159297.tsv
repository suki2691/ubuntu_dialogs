2006-11-30T09:19:00.000Z	Shaezsche		i just installed ubuntu on reiserfs, was that a bad idea?
2006-11-30T09:20:00.000Z	Shaezsche		jordan_U i heard it is unstable, why does ubuntu choose ext3 as default?
2006-11-30T09:21:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	Shaezsche	Theres reiserfs and resier4fs, 4 is the less stable one
2006-11-30T09:23:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	Shaezsche	I had reiser4 corrupt 2 different systems, but quite a few people use it, im not sure about reiser3 although Slackware used it by default for a while so its probally not too bad
