2012-09-10T05:52:00.000Z	NicolasCage		is it a good idea to use an external hard drive for a linux long-term linux (kubuntu) installation?
2012-09-10T05:53:00.000Z	NicolasCage		I have no internal hdd now, its an old IDE connection and cant buy any in the shops. jeep: for my main OS.
2012-09-10T05:55:00.000Z	NicolasCage		Hmm, well I know what you mean wilee-nilee, I am running this installation off a USB disk now, but I want  a more permanent solution. It s quite slow as it is alright. usb 2.0
2012-09-10T05:55:00.000Z	Iron	NicolasCage	in my opinion. It is NOT a bad idea. Just keep in mind that it will technically be a bit slower than sata 2 or 3 internal decent hdd.
