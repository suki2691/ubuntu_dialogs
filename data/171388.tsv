2009-04-27T15:00:00.000Z	slytherin	abstortedminds	why do you want to install on /boot partition?
2009-04-27T15:02:00.000Z	slytherin	abstortedminds	in any case boot loader needs to go to boot sector of driver, so hd0 is correct
2009-04-27T15:02:00.000Z	slytherin	abstortedminds	and I am not sure multiple installations can use same /boot.
