2007-02-18T13:28:00.000Z	mlalkaka		when i installed kubuntu-desktop (and all its dependencies), i was prompted with a dialog box that asked to specify which display manager (gdm or kdm) i wanted to use. is there any way to get that dialog box again so i can change the display manager again?
2007-02-18T13:28:00.000Z	jrib	mlalkaka	just do 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm'  or kdm if you want
2007-02-18T13:29:00.000Z	mlalkaka	jrib	arrenlex, colutti: so if i want gdm, i do sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm; and if i want kdm, i do sudo dpkg-reconfigure kdm?
2007-02-18T13:30:00.000Z	jrib	mlalkaka	right, that should work
