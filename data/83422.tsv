2008-08-05T10:55:00.000Z	dexikiix	sorin-mihai	yes, i shows every other file in that folder, but not that one
2008-08-05T10:58:00.000Z	sorin-mihai	dexikiix	you looked on a folder using a file browser, and saw the file, but did you looked on the same folder using the terminal? duble check that...
2008-08-05T10:58:00.000Z	dexikiix	sorin-mihai	i am absolutely positive the terminal and file browser are in the same place
