2012-11-21T08:52:00.000Z	RamchandraApte		"Ubuntu applications are all free and open source — so you can share them with anyone you like, as often as you like." but non-free apps are there in the repos
2012-11-21T08:53:00.000Z	xangua	RamchandraApte	in the nonfree repository, do you have an ubuntu support question¿
2012-11-21T08:54:00.000Z	RamchandraApte	xangua	I asked on #ubuntu-offtopic and they said ask on #ubuntu
