2008-12-10T12:26:00.000Z	StevenX		Where can I find the sources file that tells Ubuntu what repositories to use?
2008-12-10T12:26:00.000Z	rww	StevenX	/etc/apt/sources.list
2008-12-27T09:37:00.000Z	rww	StevenX	edgy is unsupported, and its packages aren't on *.archive.ubuntu.com. You'll need to edit your sources.list to point to a new server whose URL i'm trying to find...
2008-12-27T09:38:00.000Z	StevenX	rww	thank you for your help. I thought I had upgraded to 8.10. At least that is what Ubuntu tells me when I go to System --> About Ubuntu
