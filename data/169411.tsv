2007-02-07T06:20:00.000Z	lucio		I compiled a 2.6.20 kernel on a ubuntu dapper and I got this error at boot: udevplug make-queue unable to create /dev/.udev/queue :-(
2007-02-07T06:21:00.000Z	frogzoo	lucio	dunno if you'll get 2.6.20 to work with dapper
2007-02-07T06:24:00.000Z	lucio	frogzoo	... you mean that is a coimmon problem in ubuntu dapper?
2007-02-07T06:25:00.000Z	frogzoo	lucio	udev is going through major rework between versions atm, & tracks new kernels, so I'm not that surprised it hasn't worked
