2010-01-06T05:14:00.000Z	Tayl		But I'm in the folder I downloaded it to.
2010-01-06T05:15:00.000Z	Tayl		I type: chmod +x et-linux-2.55.x86.run and get no feedback but a new terminal line to type in so I assume that worked fine?
2010-01-06T05:16:00.000Z	LJR	Tayl	run ls in the working directory to ensure the file is now executable. (green)
2010-01-06T05:17:00.000Z	Tayl	LJR	acicula: Thank you both for the help!
