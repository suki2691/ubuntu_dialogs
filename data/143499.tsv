2007-03-09T07:36:00.000Z	tbuss		very new to linux, was wondering how to stream movies from a windows comp to ubuntu. I'm able to share files between the two, just not movies
2007-03-09T07:36:00.000Z	mjunx	tbuss	are you sharing the files via samba/smb/cifs?
2007-03-09T07:37:00.000Z	mjunx	tbuss	then you can just play the videos via that
