2011-07-20T23:39:00.000Z	rannmann		Is there a way, without root/sudo, to change the default editor (for the user, not the system)?
2011-07-20T23:40:00.000Z	ikonia	rannmann	EDITOR=/usr/bin/vim for example
2011-07-20T23:41:00.000Z	rannmann	ikonia	In .bashrc?  Because I tried that both with alias and export and it doesn't seem to be working.
