2005-11-09T09:09:00.000Z	Sinphaltimus		Sorry, I was under the impression I could get support here. Didn't know it was a developers IRC.
2005-11-09T09:10:00.000Z	ompaul	Sinphaltimus	this is support
2005-11-09T09:10:00.000Z	ompaul	Sinphaltimus	what I said was: Wo|f, tell them in #ubuntu-devel - Note it is not a support channel at all :-)
2005-11-09T09:11:00.000Z	ompaul	Sinphaltimus	it is not referred to #ubuntu-devel
