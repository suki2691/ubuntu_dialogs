2007-11-06T20:00:00.000Z	alanh		Hey all, I'm trying to record a DVD ISO to work.  When I try to open the ISO in CD/DVD writer, it says "There was an error writing to the disc"
2007-11-06T20:01:00.000Z	ptn107	alanh	did you check the md5 sums for the iso
2007-11-06T20:01:00.000Z	alanh		wodim says "wodim: Cannot init drive"
2007-11-06T20:05:00.000Z	alanh	ptn107	 md5sums match.
