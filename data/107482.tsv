2008-02-27T08:43:00.000Z	wease|		you can try and roast it as two separate files and commingle them afterwards
2008-02-27T08:45:00.000Z	wease|		darkmystere: i have never heard of anybody splitting (that isnt exaclty splitting) an ISO into so many pieces. i know it is possible to turn an ISO into a couple a files and rejoining them but not to the extent you wish to perform
2008-02-27T08:46:00.000Z	Darkmystere	wease|	Err, then what sizes should i do..a friend needs this iso but his internet sucks so he asked me to put it on my server so he could get it
