2010-07-03T19:49:00.000Z	Hans_Henrik		i edited the DNS configs with network-manager some months ago to use OpenDNS and it worked perfectly, some days ago (or maybe about 1-2 weeks ago, its a server i rarely check up on)  it stopped working. (i cannot goto any website by domain name, i need to do it manually by IP), i have tried re-configuring the dns settings and restarting the whole pc, and its still not working. help please

2010-07-03T19:54:00.000Z	Hans_Henrik	scunizi	im not sure what its supposed to say, but it seems right, "# Generated by NetworkManager(newline)nameserver 208.67.222.222(newline)nameserver 208.67.220.220(newline)"
2010-07-03T19:55:00.000Z	scunizi	Hans_Henrik	looks right to me too.. when mine changes it adds other name servers provided by my isp..
