2009-02-01T11:14:00.000Z	GMWeezel		I'm installing linux on an old system that is single core. Would linux image 486 be better than 686 since  it's single core with no hyper threading?
2009-02-01T11:14:00.000Z	dmsuperman	GMWeezel	They're the same iirc
2009-02-01T11:15:00.000Z	dmsuperman	GMWeezel	But I think they're both 686 if you want to get technical
2009-02-01T11:15:00.000Z	GMWeezel	dmsuperman	alright, thanks
