2010-09-20T23:53:00.000Z	Penguinista		I was wondering, is this some-kind of Gnome drawback or something else, why I cannot install two applications at the same time?
2010-09-20T23:55:00.000Z	trism	Penguinista	Synaptic can do that as well...the Software Center could if they added some sort of install queue but they want to keep it simple
2010-09-20T23:56:00.000Z	trism	Penguinista	may be a nice feature suggestion for the future though
2010-09-20T23:57:00.000Z	Penguinista	trism	yeah. I guess, It could save some time.
