2006-06-29T14:45:00.000Z	andyjeffries	ardchoille	achandra, Adium: OK, thanks for your help.  Found out what it was (I was using myfile.avi a shorter filename to use on here).  The file didn't have a .avi file ending and for some wierd reason I can now only mplayer {tab} on files ending with valid file endings.  This may seem strange to you guys (wanting to do that), but I often check on the process during download (when the filename ends in .part or .prz0)
