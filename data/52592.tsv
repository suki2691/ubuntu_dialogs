2010-07-06T07:50:00.000Z	mac9416_	Spyzer	you're trying to boot non-Ubuntu ISOs from USB?
2010-07-06T07:51:00.000Z	mac9416_	Spyzer	haha, I didn't mean it that way. I was just going to say that you might find some tutorials for non-Linux ISOs at the pendrivelinux website.
2010-07-06T07:54:00.000Z	mac9416_	Spyzer	I don't really know. But like I say, pendrivelinux might be helpful.
