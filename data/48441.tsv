2009-09-16T23:59:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		wow ssh is refusing connection from my other box which is weird since I didnt add any new block rules in ufw, anyone care to tell me how I go about finding whats has caused this?
2009-09-17T00:00:00.000Z	Krudd	Pirate_Hunter	 have you tried with no firewall?
2009-09-17T00:02:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Krudd	no I havent I am guessing it will accept but wont help as I need the firewall
2009-09-17T00:02:00.000Z	Krudd	Pirate_Hunter	 well, as long as port 22 (assuming you are using the standard port) is allowed it's not the firewall
