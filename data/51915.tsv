2009-11-18T19:09:00.000Z	wesley_	magg	the volume control is part of gnome-applets package
2009-11-18T19:10:00.000Z	magg	wesley_	ok i'll install that package
2009-11-18T19:10:00.000Z	wesley_	magg	so apt-get install gnome-applets but I would listen to cwillu as the applets are probably already installed
