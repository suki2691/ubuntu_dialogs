2008-11-13T17:14:00.000Z	Tyrath		I keep getting this error /boot/grub/stage1 not read correctly :(
2008-11-13T17:14:00.000Z	Tyrath		- what does that mean?
2008-11-13T17:15:00.000Z	Tyrath		all I'm trying is move ubuntu to a new partition
2008-11-13T17:15:00.000Z	[mbm]	Tyrath	grub stores part of the bootup on the disk .. that's saying it can't find that data on the disk
