2010-05-11T23:09:00.000Z	Nitsuga	isaac_	when there is no free ram, the kernel kills the process with most private ram use, or one of its childs, unless it is niced (high priority) or active,

2010-05-11T23:12:00.000Z	Nitsuga	isaac_	if you run out of ram and don't want to wait for the kernel to kill a processs, you can force it to do that with Alt-Print screen-F (F from Full). If your system hangs, you can try that first to unfreeze it.
