2009-01-30T21:51:00.000Z	mmm4m5m		question: how to make /dev/sdc5 read-only? (change permisions, does not help)
2009-01-30T21:51:00.000Z	chi_	mmm4m5m	 maybe use fstab for this
2009-01-30T21:53:00.000Z	mmm4m5m	Patrickzilla	chi_: to mount it as read only... but still wondering why permissions of /dev/sdc5 does not work.
2009-01-30T21:55:00.000Z	chi_	mmm4m5m	 fstab  <= ro     => read-only ~ tried it?
