2010-01-30T20:43:00.000Z	menashe		In Gnome I have a problem that if I choose to have a display only on the external monitor and not on the laptop, it fails. If I use the same settings but allow also the laptop, the external monitor is working fine. Under KDE, I can see only the lower part of the screen, both in the laptop and in the external screen, no matter which display settings I choose. Also in xterm mode. I cannot even lower the windows and reach their menus.
