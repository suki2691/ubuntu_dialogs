2007-02-22T10:16:00.000Z	jmworx	Frogzoo	Many bugs are not upstream. Or if they are (e.g. I'm maintaining Speex), the update won't ever make it despite the patch being submitted *before* the release of Dapper!
2007-02-22T10:22:00.000Z	Frogzoo	jmworx	you did read the mention of #ubuntu-offtopic ?
2007-02-22T10:23:00.000Z	jmworx	Frogzoo	Yes, but I believe fixing bugs should be considered "on topic". Or did I miss something?
