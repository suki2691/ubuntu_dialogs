2008-11-02T17:16:00.000Z	inter4ever		this page https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI is not updated for itnrepid and says nothing about the 4870
2008-11-02T17:16:00.000Z	inter4ever	legend2440	do the open source drivers support the 4870?
2008-11-02T17:17:00.000Z	legend2440	inter4ever	yes i believe so
