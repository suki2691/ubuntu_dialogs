2006-10-02T05:33:00.000Z	malice		When the Final version comes out for Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft)  will I just get a icon that pops up and telling me that there are upgrades for the system or will I have to do all this manually?

2006-10-02T05:36:00.000Z	edgy	malice	ah you want to upgrade between different versions, do windows do such a thing? ;)
2006-10-02T05:36:00.000Z	edgy	malice	no
