2007-03-19T07:58:00.000Z	greig_		hi all, can i a ask, is there a default root password? i upgraded from 5.10 to 6.6? and i had a few error which i thinks now fixed but when i run updates now it asks for a pass and the pass i did set nolonger works?

2007-03-19T08:01:00.000Z	greig_	dyrne	: ok, also since ive updated i have no terminal i get a error saying gnome terminal no such file or directort. i think it has majorly messed up
