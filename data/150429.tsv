2009-10-06T19:37:00.000Z	shortlord		but I connected with Xchat to "Ubuntu Servers", which is irc.ubuntu.com/8001. That works. But connecting to irc.freenode.net/8001 does not work
2009-10-06T19:37:00.000Z	Pici	shortlord	irc.ubuntu.com is a cname for irc.freenode.net
2009-10-06T19:39:00.000Z	Pici	shortlord	?
