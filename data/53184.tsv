2010-04-20T18:24:00.000Z	queso		Last night a co-worker updated DNS for one of our domains from an old IP to a new IP. One of my servers, though, has not updated to using this new IP address.  How can I get it to use the new IP address?
2010-04-20T18:25:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	queso	the server is a dns client?
2010-04-20T18:25:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	queso	did you perhaps modify /etc/hosts?
2010-04-20T18:26:00.000Z	queso	MasterOfDisaster	oooh, I see.  No, I didn't modify /etc/hosts.  It's resolving correctly.  My co-worker must have missed something on the new server because it's pointing there.  Nevermind, thanks for your time.
