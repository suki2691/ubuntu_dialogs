2011-10-13T06:29:00.000Z	hegemon	zromayn	That file is generated by network manager
2011-10-13T06:31:00.000Z	hegemon	zromayn	You either need to set it in the network manager app or /etc/network/interfaces
2011-10-13T06:33:00.000Z	zromayn	hegemon	that's another issue i have with ubuntu desktop 11.04, if i attempt modifying the /etc/network/interfaces file, i lose network connectivity. I only get to configure the network by the gnome "edit connections..."
