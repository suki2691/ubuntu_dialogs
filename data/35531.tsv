2010-03-21T07:20:00.000Z	Brenda_McLinux		I am using Xubuntu 9.10 and want to re-enable the ctrl-alt-backspace restart X ability. I have to make the command manually in Xubuntu, does anyone know what the command is for restart X?
2010-03-21T07:22:00.000Z	EastDallas	Brenda_McLinux	take a look at this http://maketecheasier.com/restore-ctrl-alt-backspace-in-ubuntu-jaunty/2009/05/17

2010-03-21T07:25:00.000Z	Brenda_McLinux	EastDallas	That guide you sent is using an old dontzap command that isn't needed anymore in Ubuntu. Ubuntu has the ability to re-enable the command via the keyboard layout settings. What I need to know is the restart X command, the one I could type in a terminal.
