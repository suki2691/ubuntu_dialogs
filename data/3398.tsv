2012-10-20T21:32:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	gigia	sudo apt-get install gnome-shell
2012-10-20T21:33:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	gigia	You actually have gnome 3 already but thta will install the shell to use it.
2012-10-20T21:34:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	gigia	unity is a plugin in compiz which is the window manager runiing on top of gnome 3 I would leave unity alone myself.
