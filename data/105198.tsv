2012-01-25T21:55:00.000Z	nc_		I was just wondering, if I were to ssh to a machine in my network from a machine outside my network (i have a static ip adress) would i then "ssh user@my.static.ip.adress"? I mean if I check my ip adress online all the computers have the same one :o (Sorry for being a noob)
