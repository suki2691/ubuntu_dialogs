2011-02-26T14:31:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	llutz	yes but everytime its newly mounted i cant write to the root of the device. (where my user tries to create the trash dir)
2011-02-26T14:33:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	llutz	telefone 5 min plz
2011-02-26T14:37:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	llutz	since it is the automount feature, it dinamically creates a folder with the volume name in media, which i can chmod. but when you eject the drive those folders get deleted
2011-02-26T14:40:00.000Z	WinstonSmith	llutz	sure i know. but its not the whole FS, just the root folder of it, which is mounted in a dinamically created folder which is chmod/chown - able, but is deleted everytime you eject the disk
