2009-01-04T22:08:00.000Z	the_squircle	x1250	If there is more swap space being used, more disk reads and writes need to be used, and normal (root) filesystem access will be slowed
2009-01-04T22:08:00.000Z	x1250	the_squircle	yeah, but thats not what you said. You related the swap size with speed, and there is no relation in that.
2009-01-04T22:09:00.000Z	the_squircle	x1250	I related swap size with disk access speed.... rightfully so.
