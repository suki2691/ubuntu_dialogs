2010-02-28T23:32:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	ehnde	probably better to grab it from hardware drivers
2010-02-28T23:33:00.000Z	ehnde	psycho_oreos	i don't understand. do you mean get the nvidia 64 bit driver from nvidia?
2010-02-28T23:34:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	ehnde	no I mean to go through gnome into hardware drivers, it'll save you mucking around with the one from nvidia's site
