2006-06-01T06:19:00.000Z	Krank		Using the Flight 5 LiveCD I was never able to get to the desktop. I always got a series of these: hdc: ide_intr: huh? expected NULL handler on exit
2006-06-01T06:19:00.000Z	Krank		Buffer I/O error on device hdc, logical block 314976. Any idea what this means?
2006-06-01T06:20:00.000Z	Krank		Ah. Just make sure the MD5's match on the burn
