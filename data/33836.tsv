2010-04-19T00:39:00.000Z	kai235	erUSUL	My Trackpoint falls back to default speed and sensitivity every time it wakes up from suspend, so I want to execute a little script after waking up
2010-04-19T00:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	kai235	maybe there is some mechanism to do that in /etc/acpi/
2010-04-19T00:41:00.000Z	kai235	erUSUL	checked that already:-(
