2008-06-28T20:45:00.000Z	zoiks		I cannot get samba working. When I try and access a file hosted on hardy from another hardy or xp machine it says it cant access it
2008-06-28T20:45:00.000Z	sudobash	zoiks	who owns the file?
2008-06-28T20:46:00.000Z	zoiks	sudobash	its not even individual files. I click on the shared folder, it asks for password, but then says cannot mount the shared folder
