2005-05-24T13:11:00.000Z	Razor-X	rixth	does it have an X Window?
2005-06-17T06:59:00.000Z	Razor-X	rixth	i've used it a few times, so, shoot
2005-06-17T07:00:00.000Z	rixth	Razor-X	when I goto login, "cvs -d :ext:asubstitute@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/blogwrite import -m "Initial Upload" BlogWrite asubstitute start" is that correct? It asks me for my password, I put it in and get "cvs [import aborted] : reading .viminfo: Permission denied" I'm the only member/admin on the project
