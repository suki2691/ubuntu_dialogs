2008-04-13T03:23:00.000Z	globe	techbrit	right.  Thanks.  How about for a script being run from cron?  Can I put the redirect in the crontab?
2008-04-13T03:25:00.000Z	globe	techbrit	I thought so too, but it didnt seem to work.  Is there a command to redirect all stdout to a file, which could then be undone at the end of the script?
