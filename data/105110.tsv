2012-10-26T01:58:00.000Z	razorbuzz		Upgrade to 12.10 failed from 12.04 - grub can't find a kernel. Upgrade removed all 3.2's and installed a 3.5, but initramfs failed (and apparently update-grub did, too?). Tried searching - no results. Any thoughts/help?
2012-10-26T01:59:00.000Z	razorbuzz		No GRUB menu at all. Just a command prompt appears on after 12.10 upgrade
