2007-05-25T05:01:00.000Z	usea		I'm trying ubuntu, and it boots fine from the live cd. but when I try to install it to the hard disk, after it's done and it reboots, it immediately gives an error. "GRUB loading, please wait... Error 18" and fails to proceed. any ideas?
2007-05-25T05:03:00.000Z	usea		thanks pelo
2007-05-25T05:03:00.000Z	usea		maybe the cd is burned poorly? I've reinstalled 3 times with the same result each time
