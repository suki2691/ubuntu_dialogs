2011-07-09T17:13:00.000Z	bnana		i was wondering if ther's a way to decompress files archived in that awfult RAR format, with a free program
2011-07-09T17:13:00.000Z	gartral	bnana	yes there is, there is unrar and unrar-nonfree
2011-07-09T17:14:00.000Z	gartral	bnana	once either is installed, the archive manager in ubuntu will be able too extract most RAR files
