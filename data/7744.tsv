2012-01-03T02:31:00.000Z	n2diy		I just upgraded an Xubuntu 10.10 box to Ubuntu 11.10, and now the box won't boot. The keyboard LEDs blink at turn on, but that's it. ‎I can't even get into CMOS!?
2012-01-03T02:31:00.000Z	hubx	n2diy	thats a kernel panic
2012-01-03T02:33:00.000Z	n2diy	hubx	I think it's worse than that, ‎I can't boot from the CD either, something strange has happened.
2012-01-03T02:44:00.000Z	n2diy	hubx	reseated the mother board power connector, and now ‫I'm booting again, whew!
