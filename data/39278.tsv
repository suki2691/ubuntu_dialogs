2010-01-31T06:54:00.000Z	NotTooSmart	onetinsoldier	i hope you know all those firewall programs only manage iptables via a gui
2010-01-31T06:55:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	NotTooSmart	yes. i know that. however, ubuntu does not have a firewall turned on by default. i got the idea that you were telling Justin_` that he has a firewall running by default
