2006-10-28T15:44:00.000Z	prower		Is Eft considered a "stable" release, or in transition to a stable one?
2006-10-28T15:45:00.000Z	levander	prower	it's a stable release, although probably in some marginal ways not as stable, since long term support hasn't been applied to it
2006-10-28T15:45:00.000Z	levander	prower	i think it contains some applications that are fairly new, stuff like that that made them not give it LTS (long term support)
2006-10-28T15:45:00.000Z	prower	levander	Yeah, that makes sense...so far I haven't had any problems save for the screensavers not working
