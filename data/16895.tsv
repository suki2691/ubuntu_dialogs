2012-04-25T17:03:00.000Z	kaiowas		I live in sweden, and thought that i could get a cheap laptop for linux..  And i just had this thing in the back of my head that some had gotten a refund if they didn't want windows on it. The seller i spoke with earlier today had absolutely no idea :).

2012-04-25T17:04:00.000Z	kaiowas	chiliblue	maybe not cheaper, but a refund is a refund.. :).
2012-04-25T17:05:00.000Z	chiliblue	kaiowas	I fully support the principle just in reality it will be a lot of hassle
