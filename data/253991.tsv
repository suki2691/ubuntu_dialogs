2010-04-20T06:44:00.000Z	Wingless		Hello again. I have another question. I've installed Adobe Reader 9 by downloading the file AdbeRdr9.3.2-1_i386linux_enu.deb from Adobe and installing it using the GDebi Package Installer. Now I want to uninstall it. It seems to me that GDebi doesn't uninstall stuff, so how do I go about uninstalling this .deb package?

2010-04-20T07:06:00.000Z	aperson	Wingless	more or less, files can be marked as executable
