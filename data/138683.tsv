2008-04-24T15:29:00.000Z	TB`		No seriously is it like $180 - how does it compare to Vista?
2008-04-24T15:29:00.000Z	TB`		And doesn't it come with free beer?
2008-04-24T15:30:00.000Z	virdiq	TB`	$999 with a free online $999 rebate (this is worked out before purchase so the actual purchase price is $0)
