2005-12-16T07:51:00.000Z	SCMark		how do I make HP printing not start at boot?
2005-12-16T07:52:00.000Z	SCMark		also where is a log of everything that scrolls by when I boot?
2005-12-16T07:53:00.000Z	sm	SCMark	dmesg
2005-12-16T07:54:00.000Z	SCMark	sm	dmesg is a bit too detailed.  I just want to be able to hit pageup and scroll up to see what just started
