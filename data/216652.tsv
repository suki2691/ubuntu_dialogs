2010-02-23T15:41:00.000Z	ardchoille	Tommy89	iirc, you need to upgrade one version at a time unless you're going from one LTS to another
2010-02-23T15:42:00.000Z	ardchoille	Tommy89	10.10 (the next LTS release) is due out in two months
2010-02-23T15:42:00.000Z	ardchoille	Tommy89	sorry, 10.04 (the next LTS release) is due out in two months
