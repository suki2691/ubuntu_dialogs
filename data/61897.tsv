2009-07-23T23:56:00.000Z	grawity	xTheGoat121x	More like months?
2009-07-23T23:57:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	philpem	alright. So I'm probably better off using ext2 on my netbook?
2009-07-23T23:58:00.000Z	grawity	xTheGoat121x	I'd say ext3. Flash drives are more reliable today than they were; and netbooks even more so.
