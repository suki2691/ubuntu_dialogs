2009-01-31T01:29:00.000Z	exmachina		i tried using sed 's/\n//g' file to remove new lines but to no avail, anyone?
2009-01-31T01:31:00.000Z	n8tuserf	exmachina	-> something perhaps like  sed 's/\\n$//g'
2009-01-31T01:31:00.000Z	exmachina	n8tuserf	no dice
2009-01-31T01:32:00.000Z	n8tuserf	exmachina	-> visit #bash for further assistance
