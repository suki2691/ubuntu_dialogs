2007-11-18T10:55:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	someone2005	your $PATH is the list of directories bash searches executables for
2007-11-18T10:56:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	someone2005	so, that would be /bin, /usr/bin, and /usr/local/bin by default
2007-11-18T10:56:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	someone2005	'bin' meaning 'binaries'
