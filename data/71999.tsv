2011-06-22T06:03:00.000Z	Stingray88		I just formatted a usb drive ext4 and now I can't write to it, what's up with that?
2011-06-22T06:04:00.000Z	Stingray88		can anyone help me figure out why I can't write to my USB drive? The drive works perfectly fine with FAT32, HFS or NTFS, but when I format it ext4 with gparted, I can't write to it at all
