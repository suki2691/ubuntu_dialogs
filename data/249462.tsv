2005-04-21T11:19:00.000Z	mackid		hey all.. can anyone tell me how I might resize my root partition (ext3)?  I know GParted can do it, but not while booted from it :-P any ideas, folks?
2005-04-21T11:20:00.000Z	mackid		is it possible to do it with a hoary *install* CD?
2005-04-21T11:20:00.000Z	mackid		rather than a liveCD..
2005-04-21T11:21:00.000Z	michael_	mackid	nope, no other way
