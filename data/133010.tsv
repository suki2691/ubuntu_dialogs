2007-06-07T05:33:00.000Z	Spliffster		which IRC channel would you suggest about network-manager issues ?
2007-06-07T05:35:00.000Z	ipx	Spliffster	and 7.04 is not long time support?
2007-06-07T05:36:00.000Z	Spliffster	ipx	AFAIK not, dapper is called "6.06 LTS" lts for long time support. then there is 6.10 and 7.04. so i guess only dapper haslong time support
2007-06-07T05:36:00.000Z	ipx	Spliffster	ok :)
