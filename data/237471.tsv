2010-04-19T07:54:00.000Z	Fikcio		Hello. I need help.
2010-04-19T07:55:00.000Z	isaac_	Fikcio	what's the problem?
2010-04-19T07:56:00.000Z	isaac_	Fikcio	boot from the Ubuntu live cd and fix grub from it.
2010-04-19T07:56:00.000Z	isaac_	Fikcio	alternatively, use a partition editor (like the one on that live CD), delete all Ubuntu and reinstall it.  It would also fix GRUB en route.
