2011-07-17T23:40:00.000Z	ayush_		Why should a dual-booter do a "proper" ubuntu installation instead of through wubi? In other words, how is a "proper" installation better (for both, the user and ubuntu community/canonical)? Please help.

2011-07-17T23:55:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	ayush_	is this the source?
2011-07-17T23:55:00.000Z	ayush_	aeon-ltd	no. the compiled binary.
