2008-11-29T00:09:00.000Z	g33k		is there any graphical guide how to set static IP on kubuntu 8.10 graphical way?
2008-11-29T00:11:00.000Z	whoop	g33k	I have been messing around for a long time getting static ip to work under ubuntu 8.10, I use gnome btw.
2008-11-29T00:11:00.000Z	whoop	g33k	maybe this guide will help you anyway: http://linhost.info/2008/11/how-to-set-a-static-ip-on-ubuntu-810/
2008-11-29T00:12:00.000Z	whoop	g33k	the second method worked for me. but as an extra note be sure to add dns server entries. Cause it did not work for me without this.
