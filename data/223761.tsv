2009-08-10T03:22:00.000Z	al_x		can someone tell me where to set default runlevel on ubuntu 9.10
2009-08-10T03:22:00.000Z	th0r	al_x	there is only runlevel 2 and single user, it isn't like suse or fedora
2009-08-10T03:23:00.000Z	th0r	al_x	the only option is single user mode
2009-08-10T03:23:00.000Z	th0r	al_x	once in single user, you could disable X from starting
