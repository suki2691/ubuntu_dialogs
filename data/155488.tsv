2007-02-24T14:01:00.000Z	Elrik		Hi, can anybody help me setting up my connection?
2007-02-24T14:02:00.000Z	Elrik		Yeah I was going to post more info,, I use a Wireless network card [Asus 802.11] , and with it I want to connect to the router in our home network, I have no idea how to set it up really.
2007-02-24T14:03:00.000Z	Elrik		I tried working with the terminal, when I type anything in the terminal, it asks for a password, but then I can't type anything??
