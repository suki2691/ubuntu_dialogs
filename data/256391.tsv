2007-05-30T11:09:00.000Z	demonspork		do you think it would be faster to make ISO files of DVDs and then mount the ISO in order to rip the video from the DVDs?
2007-05-30T11:10:00.000Z	demonspork		because I can rip as many dvds at a time as I want but I only have 2 drives, would I be able to copy and mount ISOs fast enough to keep up with 3 or 4 continuous DVD rps?
