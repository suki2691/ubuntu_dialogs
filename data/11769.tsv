2011-11-19T20:51:00.000Z	ppcblaster		where can I get help getting a Hauppauge PVR 350 working to watch tv in us from analog cable?
2011-11-19T20:53:00.000Z	zykotick9_	ppcblaster	do you have some digital2analog adapter?  There is no analog cable in the US/Canada anymore.
2011-11-19T20:55:00.000Z	zykotick9_	ppcblaster	and is that "none" right now?
2011-11-19T20:56:00.000Z	zykotick9_	ppcblaster	does your 350 get any channels?  I'd be amazed if it did, it shouldn't.
