2009-08-09T08:08:00.000Z	phajas		I have a Gigabyte T1028 with an Atheros ar928x. It originally recognized the interface, but did not work properly (was unable to show available networks or even connect with a manually entered SSID). Then, I followed some instructions that involved downloading a driver, unpacking it, running a shell script and then running "sudo dpkg --install compat*deb" (I found this on the forum.) Unfortunately, now the interface doesn't come up at all. D

2009-08-09T08:11:00.000Z	phajas	mazda01	So I am stumped as to how to enable the module. Are you sure that ath9k is the right one?
