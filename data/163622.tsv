2006-11-25T17:43:00.000Z	azcazandco	Daviey	 I have tried to install on one sata drive that just wouldn't take it at all so I put that to a bad hd, I then installed on my ide0 and it kept freezing so I installed on ide1 and it still freezes, not just on one version of ubuntu though, edgy, dapper & dapper 64 all freeze, my oldest install and first is good but I broke it a little and want to start from scratch
