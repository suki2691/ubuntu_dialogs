2007-09-27T16:06:00.000Z	Ademan_		is there a maximum number of files that can be contained in a directory on ext3? (however high it might be)
2007-09-27T16:07:00.000Z	macd	Ademan_	its limited to the number of inodes on the disk.
2007-09-27T16:07:00.000Z	Ademan_	macd	so really that would be total files not how many files are in a given directory right?
2007-09-27T16:08:00.000Z	macd	Ademan_	well yeah I guess I could have said number of inodes - used ones ;P
