2006-05-22T10:50:00.000Z	Draconicus		Hmm... Let's ask a question the idiotic way: Where are my screensavers?
2006-05-22T10:52:00.000Z	Mahmoud_	Draconicus	System > Screensaver
2006-05-22T10:52:00.000Z	Mahmoud_	Draconicus	System > Preferences* > Screensaver
2006-05-22T10:53:00.000Z	Draconicus	Mahmoud_	Okay. Now to put it the intelligent way to get the correct answer. I've installed xscreensaver in Dapper. Before you so kindly and carelessly redirect me, I'd like you to at least attempt to help me. The xscreensaver package on its own has installed very few default screensavers. I can't seem to find the proper package to get the rest. Do you have any useful input regarding this?
