2004-11-13T14:27:00.000Z	morgs		I have a question about the warty security updates. I get the ubuntu-security-announce list, but when I reload in synaptic, there are no updated packages.
2004-11-13T14:27:00.000Z	morgs		Does it take a while before they are available?
2004-11-13T14:27:00.000Z	Treenaks	morgs	maybe you don't have them installed?
