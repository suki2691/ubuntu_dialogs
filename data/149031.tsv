2008-04-01T03:06:00.000Z	Mark_		What is the difference between installing hardy heron and a fully updated gutsy gibbon (through updates) won't they be the same? Or are the differences more complex
2008-04-01T03:06:00.000Z	unop	Mark_	they are different versions, hardy would have newer versions to most packages
2008-04-01T03:08:00.000Z	Mark_	unop	so gutsy won't ever have the most recent versions?
2008-04-01T03:09:00.000Z	unop	Mark_	some packages won't be bleeding edge in a fully updated gutsy - this might be because of some odd dependencies that only the setup in hardy can get around
