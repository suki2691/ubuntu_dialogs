2010-08-17T08:25:00.000Z	keith1		Got a ? I was testing to see if an older Dell Inspiron 1501 would accept Edubuntu (I want it for a laptop for my son) and I selected try before install. I did notice while it tried to boot that there was a wireless firmware error. It suggested I got to a website to upgrade drivers. Is this something I should prepare for upon installing it fully?
