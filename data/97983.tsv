2009-08-24T16:15:00.000Z	Anarhist		i am having problems with anything which accesses PGP keys (that is the plugin for thunderbird, seahorse, and even 'gpg' terminal command), things just sit there and wait for some lock to be released. i was thinking of nuking my configuration files and then re-importing all the keys, but i don't know where all this stuff is stored. Can somebody please help with that?
