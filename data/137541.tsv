2008-02-04T00:43:00.000Z	DiceyDays		What is the difference between the kde 4 version in the repositories, and the kde 4 version that you get through kubuntu?
2008-02-04T00:44:00.000Z	nickrud	DiceyDays	kubuntu uses the standard repos
2008-02-04T00:45:00.000Z	DiceyDays	nickrud	So adding "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/kubuntu-members-kde4/ubuntu gutsy main" really makes no difference? Because kde 4 core is already in my repository.
2008-02-04T00:45:00.000Z	nickrud	DiceyDays	if that's the one that the page PriceChild gave you, I'd use that one. Or ask for more info from the #kubuntu-kde4 channel
