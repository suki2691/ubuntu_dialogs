2005-10-22T14:05:00.000Z	dooglus	Sonderblade	you need to install it.  install "build-essential" to get a bunch of build tools, or just install 'gcc' if that's all you need
2005-10-24T14:23:00.000Z	dooglus	Sonderblade	be careful.  you can cause people to lose files if you give them bad 'tar' commands
2005-10-24T14:24:00.000Z	Sonderblade	dooglus	THEY should be careful :)
