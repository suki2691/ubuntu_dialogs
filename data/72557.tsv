2008-12-13T12:14:00.000Z	chx		I am running Hardy and would like have the 27 kernel. i am wondering whether it'd be possible to add the intrepid repos to my sources list and somehow convince apt-get to use those repos for the necessary kernel packages. I presume this is possible, is there some docs I could read on this ? someone would please guide me?

2008-12-13T12:17:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	chx	i bet i can name a package right off the top of my head that's kernel package dep.. module-init-tools... that's just one example, of many i'm sure
