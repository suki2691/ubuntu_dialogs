2009-02-17T09:15:00.000Z	alife		quick question, is there any easy way to check the compile time options used in the official php package?
2009-02-17T09:15:00.000Z	alife		they aren't shown in the phpinfo page like other distro's i've used in the past

2009-02-17T09:20:00.000Z	alife	InCrypto_work	do you have a specific apt-cache command to look at? im not seeing compile time options :/
