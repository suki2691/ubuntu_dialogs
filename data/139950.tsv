2007-05-27T16:08:00.000Z	zaggynl	internetrr	Preferences, Interfaces->Text box-> check 'Enable time stamps'
2007-05-27T16:08:00.000Z	zaggynl		also, try to explore the interface by yourself next time
2007-05-27T16:09:00.000Z	internetrr	zaggynl	I am a standard retarded user, I also don't know how to use google.
