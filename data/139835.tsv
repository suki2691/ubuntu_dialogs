2007-04-10T16:30:00.000Z	wiseelben	Soccrmastr20	yes, it does not store anything on your HD
2007-04-10T16:31:00.000Z	Soccrmastr20	wiseelben	I figured, because I dont have a HDD attached even. Lol whole reason Im on the livecd ;)
2007-04-10T16:32:00.000Z	wiseelben	Soccrmastr20	yep, that's the beauty of it all. It actually stores the stuff you're using in memory so it's a bit faster
