2009-01-19T06:34:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb		Here is a question.  I'm running 8.10.  When 9.04 gets released, will I have to do a fresh install or will I be able to update?
2009-01-19T06:34:00.000Z	hansel	TheFunkbomb	you can just update.
2009-01-19T06:34:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	hansel	does it update like all of the other updates with the little red down arrow?
2009-01-19T06:35:00.000Z	hansel	TheFunkbomb	- I think by default it only gets long term support releases...
