2009-07-17T19:04:00.000Z	richardcavell		Can anyone tell me - what is the practical advantage of an LTS release?  Is it really more secure or more bug-free than the current release?
2009-07-17T19:05:00.000Z	magnetron	richardcavell	it will be updated during a longer time, more support
2009-07-17T19:06:00.000Z	richardcavell	Slart	You mean because the bugs have been ironed out already?  Doesn't that apply to any old stable release? And is there any lack of support for Jaunty?
2009-07-17T19:06:00.000Z	magnetron	richardcavell	other releases doesn't get more than 18 months old, LTS releases are supported longer than that
