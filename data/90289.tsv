2008-05-18T21:50:00.000Z	ubuntuskinny		quick question (i've posted to the forums but not yet had a reply): if i cancel a distribution upgrade midway through fetching the packages (and don't shutdown the computer) will it be ok and if i restart the upgrade later today it should be fine? yes?
2008-05-18T21:52:00.000Z	_sammy_	ubuntuskinny	yes. You will be fine. If you do not wish to do the upgrade and need to recover the drive space: $ sudo rm *.deb /var/cache/apt/archives
2008-05-18T21:53:00.000Z	_sammy_	ubuntuskinny	no problem
