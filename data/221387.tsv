2005-09-10T06:46:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	u_int32_t	you don't build your own kernel dude. just install one
2005-09-10T06:47:00.000Z	u_int32_t	BROKEN_LADDER	but i need one with himem support
2005-09-10T06:48:00.000Z	BROKEN_LADDER	u_int32_t	you can install modules if you can find that one.  you install it with package management generally.  i think compiling it would be risky.
