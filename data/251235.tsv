2007-02-09T14:06:00.000Z	AlpineGuy		Well, facts are facts.  I have a Linky router and lsys has been extremely slow to release new firmware.  and most new firmware has been buggy at best, either introducing new bugs or breaking things that once worked.
2007-02-09T14:06:00.000Z	AlpineGuy		ohh no doubt, lsys makes it easy
2007-02-09T14:07:00.000Z	duckdown	AlpineGuy	you should try running tomato firmware
