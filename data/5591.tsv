2012-02-15T08:45:00.000Z	clone1018		(one more time sorry) so I have ubuntu running awesome with my ATI Radeon 6850, but there's one problem, the main monitor, for some reason it wont let me change it to monitor #1 (in the center), it instead puts it on #3 (far left), (3 monitor setup)
2012-02-15T08:47:00.000Z	clone1018		move the actual monitors?
2012-02-15T08:47:00.000Z	clone1018		I have this monitor the center monitor for a reason
2012-02-15T08:47:00.000Z	N3ffa	clone1018	Wish I could help. The only thing I can think of is either move the monitors or find the config file (usually in /etc) and do some digging.
