2006-05-12T06:15:00.000Z	dooglus	Marsmensch	you could use a cron job to download the image and put it on the desktop
2006-05-12T06:15:00.000Z	Marsmensch	dooglus	have you done somethink like this?
2006-05-12T06:16:00.000Z	dooglus	Marsmensch	I've not, no.  I don't know where the nasa pics are, and I'm not sure how to set the wallpaper from a script, but it shouldn't be too hard
