2012-10-24T08:13:00.000Z	MestreLion	[_-S1L3NC3-_]	search for identd in software center... there're a few packages.. but, imho, if that's only for IRC, I wouldn't bother about it
2012-10-24T08:14:00.000Z	MestreLion	[_-S1L3NC3-_]	and, personally, any irc server that requires identd is not worth using, seriously
2012-10-24T08:15:00.000Z	MestreLion	[_-S1L3NC3-_]	check wikipedia's article on ident to know why it's a fundamentally flawed "security" method... and why no decent irc server requires it
