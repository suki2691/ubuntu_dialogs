2009-01-31T12:00:00.000Z	Berserkur	simon_r	I think the simplest solution to your problem would be to type alt+F8 first but if that doesn't show anything then do a alt+F7 and then type ctrl+alt+backspace
2009-01-31T12:05:00.000Z	Berserkur	simon_r	Sorry, i should have said: Alt+ctrl+f8, but I think the other guys more up to the task to helping you than me.
