2008-05-13T18:39:00.000Z	LOWER_CASE		Hi, ever since I installed Gutsy about 6 weeks ago, I've never had so much trouble with my disk partitions. (1) after the initial install, the disks were all changed from /dev/hdAN to /dev/sdAN, but after any boot-up, they can be *anywhere*. (2) But what is upsetting me hourly, is that USB memory-stick mounts are totally inconsistent: various wrong permissions, various wrong mount points, or just not mounting.  What changed? Why is
