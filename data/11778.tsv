2011-09-17T01:16:00.000Z	TuRnc04tZ		i have a quick question. I installed xfce on ubuntu 11.04 and i wanted to know if its possible to use KDM instead of the XFCE login manager
2011-09-17T01:16:00.000Z	TuRnc04tZ		im googling around but i cant find anything that is relevant for this new system
2011-09-17T01:17:00.000Z	zykotick9_	TuRnc04tZ	i imagine KDM would require all the KDE libraries which could be fairly large
