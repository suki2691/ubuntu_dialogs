2006-08-08T11:34:00.000Z	DocTomoe		I have a major dpkg issue ... Something got stuck during an apt-get dist-upgrade, and I do not seem to either install, reinstall, remove or purge libapache-mod-tsunami, which was selected as a dependency of something other. Keeps telling me apache is not installed (which is correct as I use apache2). dpkg -r libapache-mod-tsunami won't work, too. Ignoring is not an option, as this jams every activity with the package manager.  Any helpful i
