2009-01-13T02:47:00.000Z	xanxor		hi, I wonder if someone could help me with an iso problem?
2009-01-13T02:47:00.000Z	xanxor		I'm trying to make an iso image of a cd I have and I can't get it to work.
2009-01-13T02:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xanxor	dd if=/dev/cdrom of=~/image.iso
2009-01-13T02:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xanxor	try dd_rescue, sounds like the cd is dirty or scratched
