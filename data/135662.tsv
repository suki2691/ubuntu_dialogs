2007-05-05T16:51:00.000Z	sethk	Raptor45	there is a grub command line utility, called grub.  there is also grub-install
2007-05-05T16:52:00.000Z	Raptor45	sethk	and if I am unable to boot? can I run that via the live cd?
2007-05-05T16:57:00.000Z	sethk	Raptor45	yes, you can get to both grub and grub-install on the cd
