2007-07-15T09:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	Sam_jones	 wireless access is not the 'defacto' standard. :) - wireless in general is such a crapshoot. its scary.
2007-07-15T09:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	Sam_jones	 figure out what they are doing.  do same thing in ubuntu.. i guess.. or check the many ubuntu wireless docs/guides.  Different cards have different 'tricks' often. W=hich is the core of the problem.
