2009-01-25T06:31:00.000Z	n8tuser	kerlo	-> trust the command line results
2009-01-25T06:31:00.000Z	kerlo	n8tuser	trusting the command line won't help if I want to use Network Tools to configure stuff.
2009-01-25T06:32:00.000Z	n8tuser	kerlo	-> if you learned the command line to configure such, it would greatly help
