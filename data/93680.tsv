2008-04-24T23:27:00.000Z	lch_	Interflop	did you have to build some kernel module yourself the last time?
2008-04-24T23:28:00.000Z	lch_	Interflop	USB or PCI?
2008-04-24T23:28:00.000Z	lch_	Interflop	is it still listed when you write "lspci" and do you see some messages about the card when you look at the message of "dmsg|less"?
