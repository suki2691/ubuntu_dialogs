2007-01-28T16:32:00.000Z	riotkittie	kritzstapf	try gnome-splashscreen-manager if you dont have ti installed
2007-01-28T16:37:00.000Z	kritzstapf	riotkittie	gnome-splashscreen-manager doesnt show any installed splashes
2007-01-28T17:08:00.000Z	kritzstapf	riotkittie	the directories you mentioned are not existing (.splash or .gnome-splash)
