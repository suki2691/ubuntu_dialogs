2009-09-23T22:45:00.000Z	jwormy		after rebuilding a machine, i'm trying to ssh into it and getting 'host key verification failed.' -- 'Offending key in /home/jeremy/.ssh/known_hosts:3'   --  does the 3 part mean it's the 3rd key listed in the known hosts file?  afaik there is no way to identify the host in the known host file other than guessing..
