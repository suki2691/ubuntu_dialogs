2007-01-08T06:39:00.000Z	alex_		i am trying to format my usb hard disk to ext3, but i cant seem to get it working with gparted.  I unmount the disk, and select format to ext3, but i get the error message "The following operation could not be applied to disk: Format /dev/sdc1 as ext3 See the details for more information ".  (The disk also mounts itself during this operation. ) Any ideas?
