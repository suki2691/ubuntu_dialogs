2011-04-23T20:32:00.000Z	TheEvilPhoenix		is there a way to install GDM login window themes in 10.04 and later, so that you can have a customized login window, rather than the standard background, one-panel, white-login-box login window?
2011-04-23T20:32:00.000Z	TheEvilPhoenix		i know such a feature existed pre-9.10, is such a feature able to be put into 10.04 or later?
2011-04-23T20:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TheEvilPhoenix	 you can change the wallpaper for gdm2 -  and a few other tweaks.
2011-04-23T20:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TheEvilPhoenix	 but ive not seen many gdm2 full 'themes'
