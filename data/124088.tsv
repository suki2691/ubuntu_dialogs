2007-08-22T07:13:00.000Z	luite_		I want to buy a new notebook, and the models I like either have the integrated intel x3100 chip, or a geforce 8400m/8600m. which one would you recommend for ubuntu with beryl desktop effects?
2007-08-22T07:13:00.000Z	daj0ker	luite_	not the integrated one
2007-08-22T07:14:00.000Z	luite_	daj0ker	too slow?
2007-08-22T07:15:00.000Z	daj0ker	luite_	what everyone said so far holds true, and I am also biased towards nvidia myself
