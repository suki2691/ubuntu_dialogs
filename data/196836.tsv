2006-05-14T16:57:00.000Z	delmar		So what I have done so far is... i have blown away about 800gigs of my favorite shows and movies... and taken the plunge.. converting my main box almost entirely to linux. i still have a winXP bootup .. just in case... but i have converted about 800gig of disk to an LVM.. and am preparing to settle in and start using Linux apps, where i would have used a windows one to do whatever.. and holey crap there is heaps of stuff out there.
2006-05-14T16:58:00.000Z	delmar		So, what can someone recommend for an ftp client? I used Filezilla on windows, and there is a beta of it for Linux but its VERY beta and not very good.... anyone have any suggestions?
