2008-12-25T12:15:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Lillaka	anyway, if there was anything there, it's gone now... the l.games directory is gone now
2008-12-25T12:15:00.000Z	Lillaka	onetinsoldier	i dont want output (better for me because it's to strange for me hihi)
2008-12-25T12:15:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Lillaka	hehe, roger
