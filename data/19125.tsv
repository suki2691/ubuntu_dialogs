2011-09-18T02:40:00.000Z	hanz0		Seems like it crashed on me. All windows have "File Edit Blah-blah-blah" menu immediately after their upper border. Like... Now I can't see "XChat - somewhat" on top of my XChat window and no "%tabname% - Mozilla Firefox" on top of my FF.
2011-09-18T02:40:00.000Z	hanz0		Can I do something with that?

2011-09-18T02:44:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	hanz0	it's a bug
