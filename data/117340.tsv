2007-10-20T07:10:00.000Z	Smegzor		Can I upgrade 7.04 to 7.10 using the 7.10 cd?  How do I do it?
2007-10-20T07:11:00.000Z	geirha	Smegzor	you can add the cd as a repository, but most of the packages will still be downloaded from the net afaik
2007-10-20T07:12:00.000Z	geirha	Smegzor	at least that was my experience going from 6.10 to 7.04
