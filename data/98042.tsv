2008-10-20T08:55:00.000Z	izinucs	pajamian	why would users list my username 3 times?
2008-10-20T08:56:00.000Z	pajamian	izinucs	because the system sees you as logged in 3 times
2008-10-20T08:56:00.000Z	izinucs	pajamian	does that mean something is amiss?  I've only logged in once for the machine.
2008-10-20T08:57:00.000Z	pajamian	izinucs	nope, don't worry about it, it displays my username 10 times
