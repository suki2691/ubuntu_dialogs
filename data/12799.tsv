2011-07-23T15:12:00.000Z	venol		hello, I have little problem with mailgraph, I have mail server Postfix 2.7 on ubuntu 10.04 with amavisd-new, spamassassin, and clamav to filter bad email. I Start my server for 3 hours and make some email to send to another domain, and then I'm use mailgraph to monitoring my postfix server. But for 3 hours, Why I see graph on mailgraph for last week is more than last day? sent Item for last day I see is 193 message, But for last week is 218...
