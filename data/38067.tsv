2010-01-31T18:35:00.000Z	will_195	Kamokow	thanks, and yeah, i am a post-pidgin user trying to adapt. thanks again :)
2010-01-31T18:35:00.000Z	Kamokow	will_195	Yup, no problem, good luck with adapting :)
2010-01-31T18:37:00.000Z	will_195	Kamokow	it's cleaner (and more basic) than pidgin, but the desktop integration looks good - i can right click a file in nautilus and click "send to" and then select empathy, then select a contact... only the contact list is greyed out. so that doesn't work, but it'd be definitely cool if it did :P)
