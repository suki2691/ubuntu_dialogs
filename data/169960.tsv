2007-08-09T08:12:00.000Z	lattera		in order to boot the install cd, I need to load the piix driver at boot-time (in the grub menu) because ubuntu doesn't do it for me
2007-08-09T08:12:00.000Z	lattera		how do I do that?
2007-08-09T08:12:00.000Z	macogw	lattera	there's a boot options thing on the cd's splash screen
2007-08-09T08:14:00.000Z	macogw	lattera	oh...um...idk. it might not be a boot option or it might be.  if its able to boot without it, you can add it to init
