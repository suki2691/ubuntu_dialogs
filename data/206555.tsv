2006-09-23T11:05:00.000Z	jsilva	sethk	maybe the kernel doesnt have full support with this motherboard :(
2006-09-23T11:05:00.000Z	sethk	jsilva	yes, or there are kernel build options set incorrectly.
2006-09-23T11:07:00.000Z	jsilva	sethk	maybe, but I get lost changing the kernel options and recompiling it :(
