2008-07-02T02:03:00.000Z	witriew		I'm needing help configuring isolinux + gfxboot and I can't seem to find any good documentation on doing so, does anyone know how to do it or can point me in the right direction?
2008-07-02T02:05:00.000Z	witriew		:( no one knows anything about (iso/sys)linux + gfxboot? (more of I'm needing to create my own bootlogo for gfxboot and I can't find any good docs on doing so)
