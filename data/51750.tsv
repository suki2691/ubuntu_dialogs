2010-04-16T08:33:00.000Z	simm		ok guys, thanks with my sims 2 problem, it looks like it is compatible but it is just taking forever, i opened details and it just has a lot of files to load, i got one more question though
2010-04-16T08:34:00.000Z	simm		right now i am dual booting because my xp is bad and i cannot find a repair disk, i think i am almost out of memory that i set aside for ubuntu, is there a way for me to increase its capacity?
2010-04-16T08:36:00.000Z	simm		because i know in windows you can increase the partition size but i dont know how to do it from ubuntu side
