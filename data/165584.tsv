2007-07-26T11:00:00.000Z	fuffal0		this isn't an ubuntu question really...but i thought i would ask as someone might know ... i shut off my computer last night, and when i go to boot it now it just sits at the inital bios screen (shows the date/time and my cpu, but doesn't move on to RAM/HD detection) - I can't hit DEL to get into setup (my keyboard doesnt look like its been turned on yet) - any ideas?
