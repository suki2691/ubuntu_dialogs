2010-06-07T13:08:00.000Z	celeritas	jMCg	im not sure but splashy changes its resolution based on the vga
2010-06-07T13:11:00.000Z	jMCg	celeritas	I'm not exactly sure how this might be related as my experience with KMS is rather non-existent. (Or my experience with desktop computers, for that matter) -- The major problem here is that the two monitors have different resolutions (and different ratios!), So I'm not sure how setting it from GRUB might affect it, since GRUBs settings are rather... simple.
