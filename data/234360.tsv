2005-10-18T11:59:00.000Z	mustafu		Just a quick question....my monitor does a lot of flickering at high resolutions (1280 x 1024, namely)...is this a sign that the monitor is possibly going bad?
2005-10-18T12:00:00.000Z	hajiki	mustafu	you probably need to fix the refresh rate by putting in the correct values in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-10-18T12:00:00.000Z	hajiki	mustafu	or also like twysted said, you are probably using too high of a resolution
2005-10-18T12:02:00.000Z	hajiki	mustafu	google your monitor and make sure those values are correct, and then make sure they are correct in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
