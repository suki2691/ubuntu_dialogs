2005-09-15T14:28:00.000Z	Garyu		guys, my Ubuntu HDD went bad (SMART Bad status), so now I want to transfer it to a new HDD. What is the easiest way to do that?
2005-09-15T14:29:00.000Z	popey	Garyu	boot to a live cd and dd from one to the other?
2005-09-15T14:29:00.000Z	Garyu	popey	doh, the live cd.. what a solution :)
2005-09-15T14:31:00.000Z	Garyu	popey	I guess I also have to copy the swap partitition to the new drive, but do the sizes of these drives have to be the same, or does it not really matter?
