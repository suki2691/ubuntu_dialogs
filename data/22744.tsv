2010-11-15T21:06:00.000Z	Kartagis		I want to install phpmyadmin but it's trying to retrieve the newer version of php, which I don't want. how can I prevent this?
2010-11-15T21:07:00.000Z	duckk	Kartagis	just download and install one of the old versions of phpmyadmin from the website
2010-11-15T21:08:00.000Z	Kartagis	duckk	I did that, but I want the repo version now
2010-11-15T21:08:00.000Z	duckk	Kartagis	latest phpmyadmin requires php 5.2+ IIRC
