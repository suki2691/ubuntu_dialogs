2012-06-24T00:07:00.000Z	Spectacle_K		Is there a way to install multiple fonts at once? I backed up some of my old fonts from my last computer and wanted to install some of them (in mass) there's about 153 fonts. I know how to install them individually (i.e. double click-->click 'install') but how to do it all at once? Like in Microsoft Windows you just right click on all the selected fonts and choose 'install fonts'.

2012-06-24T00:08:00.000Z	Spectacle_K	escott	and that will install them?
2012-06-24T00:08:00.000Z	escott	Spectacle_K	i believe so
