2007-12-03T09:55:00.000Z	mwilliam13	tarelerulz	 no.  if you have a broadcom wifi card, the bcm43xx-fwcutter will do it... you must have a dell laptop.
2007-12-03T09:57:00.000Z	mwilliam13	tarelerulz	 ah.  dell brands a broadcomm card as their own "true mobile" but still utilize the broadcom drivers... it should still work out for you though.
