2007-10-27T14:28:00.000Z	Nallep		Is there any backup/restore solution for ubuntu that can restore a system with all it's applications/configuration settings?  I'm looking for something for desktops/laptops that doesn't require disk imaging.  Any have any luck with anything in the past?

I suspect there isn't anything that'll guess which onesyouw ant to be system specific and which ones not!
