2011-07-01T19:47:00.000Z	brainwave92	minimec	they both start at startup already....so they must be called in that order during boot
2011-07-01T19:47:00.000Z	brainwave92		exactly...which is why he/she needs to modify that order
2011-07-01T19:48:00.000Z	minimec	brainwave92	morth: Well then I would add some 'sleep command' between the startup commands.
