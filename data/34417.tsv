2010-04-29T10:18:00.000Z	Albi_	frankie_	when you install a 64bit version all applications that are installed must be 64bit to run, unless you are into heavy video editing there is really no point

2010-04-29T10:23:00.000Z	Albi_	frankie_	64bit hasnt picked up yet, most hardware nowadays supports 64bit, yet people still use 32bit, if you are an advance user you can go 64bit, but if you are not you will have many troubles
