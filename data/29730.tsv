2010-08-08T23:15:00.000Z	slidinghorn	some1	 there have been some success stories via wine...give it a shot
2010-08-08T23:16:00.000Z	slidinghorn	some1	 deca-prime POL is like a front end for wine :)
2010-08-08T23:16:00.000Z	slidinghorn	some1	 then you need to go to a different site ;)  if it's netflix -- there is no linux support at this time -- send a letter to them :)
