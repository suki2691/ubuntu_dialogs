2010-04-27T10:55:00.000Z	bullgard4	bastid_raZor	Yes, they may be ssh keys. How can I differentiate beween ssh key and a GPG key?
2010-04-27T10:56:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	bullgard4	you can double click the key and see its properties which tells what type of key it is.. where it is located on your drive. ~/.ssh/ being a good hint at ssh
2010-06-20T08:47:00.000Z	bullgard4	bastid_raZor	I have read ubottu's text. I find it difficult to understand the sentence: "Canonical's partner repositories provide packages a location for software vendors to publish applications." because the grammar seems not right to me. Could you please say this sentence in other words so that I will understand it?
