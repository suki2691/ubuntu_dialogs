2009-12-23T23:33:00.000Z	tarzeau		how can i theme gdm? is there a tutorial/manual?
2009-12-23T23:33:00.000Z	tarzeau		is sabayon fine, or is there a better way to pre-configure gnome desktops? what if i want to pre-configure kde? with our own software menu?

2009-12-23T23:35:00.000Z	tarzeau	maco	oh! now that's a nice idea! i'll test that, thanks
