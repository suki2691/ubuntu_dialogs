2005-08-10T11:24:00.000Z	tjbonzo		I'm trying out ubuntu - mainly because I got tired of Debian lagging (i.e. Xorg, ...), but now I'm trying to install "gcompris", but ubuntu lags Debian unstable - is there a "unstable" repository?
2005-08-10T11:25:00.000Z	Brunellus	tjbonzo	 you could try adding the debian repos
2005-08-10T11:28:00.000Z	Brunellus	tjbonzo	 apt-pinning works the same as apt-pinning in Debian, I think
2005-08-10T11:29:00.000Z	tjbonzo	Brunellus	so does "-t unstable" pull it from breezy or do I do "-t breezy" ?
