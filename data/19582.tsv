2011-03-02T00:21:00.000Z	Starminn	VesaS	I'm using Pidgin right now and I do IM and IRC in the same window, different tabs.
2011-03-02T00:23:00.000Z	VesaS	Dr_Willis	 Ok. I will consider installing  separate program for irc. Just weird that in 2011 you still need to do it, with all clouds, web and all that shit ;)
2011-03-02T00:24:00.000Z	VesaS		Anoter meta question about irc: Is there anyway to disable the "XXX has joined", or "Reaad error" or other "==" messages...
2011-03-02T00:25:00.000Z	Starminn	VesaS	I also read yesterday somebody suggesting something like "/ignore join part leave" (though I may be a little off on the command)
