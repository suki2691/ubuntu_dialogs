2006-10-02T16:31:00.000Z	hastesaver	LookTJ	what blinking? for what? when?
2006-10-02T16:32:00.000Z	hastesaver	LookTJ	oh, you can set that -- whether you want it to blink only for messages to you, or for all messages
2006-10-02T16:33:00.000Z	hastesaver	LookTJ	yeah, anyway, it doesn't really matter :-)
