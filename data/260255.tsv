2005-11-05T11:23:00.000Z	LeeColleton		my HP PSC 1210 is printing black text with GREEN ink.  WTFOMGBBQ
2005-11-05T11:24:00.000Z	MarcN	LeeColleton	are you out of black ink?
2005-11-05T11:37:00.000Z	LeeColleton	MarcN	Nope, I changed my black ink cartridge.  HPIJS driver is foobar.
2005-11-05T11:39:00.000Z	MarcN	LeeColleton	I was just guessing.  I don't have any linux-attached printers.  All networked.
