2005-11-05T15:22:00.000Z	Zeus		I need some help. My ubuntu box runs fine until i make a new gnome user session from my gnome session. The image gets corrupted. If i return to the first session all gets fine again. Anyone knows how to resolve this problem?

2005-11-05T15:24:00.000Z	Zeus	anto9us	no, i created a new session for another user while mine was open
2005-11-05T15:25:00.000Z	anto9us	Zeus	that account maybe is corrupted, try again with a new user of a different name
