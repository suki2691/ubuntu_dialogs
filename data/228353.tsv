2005-07-27T10:33:00.000Z	Daemonic		what scripting language would I want to write a simple script to communicate with a serial port?
2005-07-27T10:33:00.000Z	Daemonic		I need to send a few simple strings of text to the serial port and receive a few in response...
2005-07-27T10:34:00.000Z	Daemonic		could I do that with a bash script?
2005-07-27T10:35:00.000Z	The_Vox	Daemonic	shell scripting...sh if you need portability, bash if you don't care about portability
