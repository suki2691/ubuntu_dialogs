2009-08-31T01:24:00.000Z	Slart	burntresistor	wine really has to have gcc 4.4?? that sounds very strange
2009-08-31T01:28:00.000Z	Slart	burntresistor	hmm.. it does indeed say that gcc 4.4 is needed on their site.. well.. I would wait until karmic koala and see what version of gcc it ships with.. or just use the binary packages from their repository
2009-08-31T01:28:00.000Z	Slart	burntresistor	you could of course compile gcc yourself.. but then we're into dangerous lands.. where there be dragons.. I won't go with you there =)
