2009-04-18T06:06:00.000Z	DanishJordan		Can anyone help me find the drivers I need for a dual boot for windows XP?
2009-04-18T06:08:00.000Z	RealUlli	DanishJordan	what are you trying to do?
2009-04-18T06:09:00.000Z	RealUlli	DanishJordan	the dual boot itself doesn't need drivers, windows however might, just to drive the HW... ;-)
2009-04-18T06:12:00.000Z	RealUlli	DanishJordan	did you do a dmesg |less and read the output?
