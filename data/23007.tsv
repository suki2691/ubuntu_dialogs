2010-11-07T02:43:00.000Z	JayD3e		I am really stumped, I have tried everything to connect to this wireless network on Ubuntu Server Edition 10.10 and I can't.  I can see all of the networks when I do a iwlist ra0 scan, but I can't connect to them.  IT keeps saying No DHCPOFFERS received when I do a dhclient ra0.  I'm using the rt2860sta
2010-11-07T02:44:00.000Z	magicianlord	JayD3e	did you sudo dhclient?
