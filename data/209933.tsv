2007-04-18T15:23:00.000Z	stoft		is there a verbose option for dpkg? I can't seem to find one
2007-04-18T15:25:00.000Z	LjL	stoft	--force-remove-reinstreq is quite verbose, for instance
2007-04-18T15:25:00.000Z	stoft	robdeman	there's a version option to apt-get (can't remember it right now though :( ) that allows you to install the version you want, you have to set it explicitly though
2007-04-18T15:26:00.000Z	LjL	stoft	but seriously, "man dpkg", hit /, and type "debug" and enter
