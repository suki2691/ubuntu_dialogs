I'm having a problem with authenticating via console login and sudo commands after upgrading to 9.04.  the console login times out, and running sudo commands take about 2 minutes to complete. the same delay exists when logging in through gnome - after entering my password the desktop doesn't come up for a few minutes.

2009-05-13T23:44:00.000Z	groverblue	mhall119|work	thanks for the tip.  I'll check that out.  Would you know off hand what I should look for?
