2007-04-14T08:57:00.000Z	cyberkun		My  Ubuntu grubs hate Vista... it will not run even though I am sure I am pointing to the right hard drive partition
2007-04-14T08:58:00.000Z	cyberkun		my mind is also starting to shut down from trying and failing for a while so the question is does anyone know about Ubuntus grub and Vista not working?
