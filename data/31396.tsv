2010-05-23T04:29:00.000Z	pfifo	allterspace	i think if you set the keyring password as blank it will skip it
2010-05-23T04:29:00.000Z	allterspace	pfifo	i dont know how to get there to do it can you help?\
2010-05-23T04:31:00.000Z	pfifo	allterspace	i havent used 10.04 yet so i cant be too specific, but in the preferences for the keyring you should find options relatedc to what your looking todo
