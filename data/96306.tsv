2012-11-07T03:52:00.000Z	Guest42		Hello everyone.  I have been googling for 2 days now.  Time to ask for assistance.  I am having an issue with libc being "in an unexpected directory".  I cannot repalce it.  But apt-get -f install is broken becasue of it.  Is this repairable?
2012-11-07T03:53:00.000Z	Guest42		dpkg --configure -a  doesnt help.
