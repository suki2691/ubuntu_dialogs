2010-04-06T02:57:00.000Z	vieira		Since gnome-power-manager moved from hal to upower it shows Unknown Remaining Time... :( any idea?
2010-04-06T02:58:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	vieira	are you on Lucid?
2010-04-06T03:01:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	vieira	AFAIK the gnome-power-manager race condition was patched for Lucid.
2010-04-06T03:04:00.000Z	Ek|mu5	vieira	it had to do with g-p-m not syncing correctly and brought about that systray pop-up that read something like: session active, not inhibited, screen idle.
