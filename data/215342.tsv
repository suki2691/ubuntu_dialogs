2007-11-18T01:14:00.000Z	Anacrusis		Anybody know why the install icon on the 7.10 Live CD would do nothing. No messages, errors or anything. Is there another way to install Ubuntu?
2007-11-18T01:15:00.000Z	soundray	Anacrusis	open a terminal and try 'gksudo ubiquity'. Any errors then?
2007-11-18T01:17:00.000Z	soundray	Anacrusis	how about 'sudo ubiquity --debug' (or maybe one dash is enough)
2007-11-18T01:21:00.000Z	soundray	Anacrusis	I think you should check the CD -- there is an option for it in the boot menu
