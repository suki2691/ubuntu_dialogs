2010-05-31T00:17:00.000Z	yurist	onetinsoldier	it shows dvd drive only
2010-05-31T00:18:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	yurist	ok, that's a problem. make sure you let people know that when you're trying to install, that the 'lshw' command doesn't show any hard drives on your system
2010-05-31T00:19:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	yurist	just include that in you problem description
