2009-01-06T19:26:00.000Z	Rex	ActionParsnip	What md5sum file, I got no special file from what I done... :(
2009-01-06T19:27:00.000Z	Rex	ActionParsnip	I just got the file I want to check and the correct checksum (5af4ab68401aae34432a0b488505be88)
2009-01-06T19:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Rex	where you then you need to run: md5 <filename> then manually compare
