2008-01-16T12:00:00.000Z	sethk	nimnrod	ok, that's generally easy to do.  "info grub" has an example
2008-01-16T12:00:00.000Z	nimnrod	sethk	ok, let me check that... if not i'll let you know
2008-01-16T12:06:00.000Z	nimnrod	sethk	i can't understand how can i apply the info i got with "grub info" (im trying to add windows into the grub menu but its in another hard drive)
