2011-07-10T21:22:00.000Z	hume		hi.... is there a way to adjust colors when printing? i use an epson stylus photo printer, and would need to make fine adjustments to get photos to print nicely, but the printing settings in gnome/ubuntu gives no such options

2011-07-10T21:24:00.000Z	hume	Ampelbein	find nothing there..?
2011-07-10T21:28:00.000Z	hume	Ampelbein	yes, cups. standard system. but i guess i need to allow acces to administering it through the browser...?
