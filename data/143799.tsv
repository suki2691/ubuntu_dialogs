2007-03-06T11:55:00.000Z	feta		hello. while trying to open a specific pdf file, the evince document reader complains: 'Unable to open document - Unhandled MIME type'. what are MIME types and how to solve the problem?
2007-03-06T11:56:00.000Z	carlosqueso	feta	evince just doesn't read every pdf.  You'll need to install the acroread package for some
2007-03-06T11:57:00.000Z	feta	carlosqueso	so the acroread package is most comprehensive and reads whatever pdf file?
2007-03-06T11:58:00.000Z	carlosqueso	feta	acroread is the adobe reader (official) package, so yes....although it isn't free software
