2011-04-30T13:12:00.000Z	Robert__		I have a virtualbox question can any one help?
2011-04-30T13:13:00.000Z	stefg_natty	Robert__	there's #vbox ... if it's ubuntu-host related it might fit in here
2011-04-30T13:21:00.000Z	stefg_natty	Robert__	i run vbox 4.0.6 PUEL on lucid (with maverick-backport kernel) without issues... does booting from a iso-image (not the physical host drive) not work either?
2011-04-30T13:24:00.000Z	stefg_natty	Robert__	so need to explain a little further what doesn't work. You can't get anything to boot inside virtualbox?
