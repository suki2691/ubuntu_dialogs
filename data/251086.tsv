2005-03-20T10:10:00.000Z	cuga		Got a question about dvd support in hoary, i just got a new dvd burner, put her in and its recognised in /media/cdrecorder, i can read cds fine but apps like mplayer freeze up when trying to play dvds, just get black screens, something else im supposed to do? using stock kernel
