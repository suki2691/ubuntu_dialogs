2011-01-19T08:33:00.000Z	psusi	triking	define "can't partition it"
2011-01-19T08:33:00.000Z	triking	psusi	it's unable to create a partition table, specifically. The disk utility says it does not support Smart data.. which I know is not true
2011-01-19T08:34:00.000Z	triking	psusi	I'm think I may have messed up its factory formatting or something :O
