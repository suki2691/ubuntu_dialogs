2010-03-19T06:05:00.000Z	orb01		maybe you need to enter the phone number NonHomogenized? that's what I had to do to get DSL over PPPoE working years ago
2010-03-19T06:05:00.000Z	NonHomogenized	orb01	enter it where?
2010-03-19T06:06:00.000Z	orb01	NonHomogenized	let me check, probably phone/modem settings
2010-03-19T06:07:00.000Z	orb01	NonHomogenized	don't worry abotu what I said, doesn't seem there is an option to enter phone numbers
