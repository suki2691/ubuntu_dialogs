2012-11-29T20:04:00.000Z	mohamed_amine		is it possible to install software rendering in ubuntu 12.04 to run unity instead of unity2d ?
2012-11-29T20:04:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	mohamed_amine	 i guess unity 3d is the default
2012-11-29T20:07:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	mohamed_amine	 that is correct
2012-11-29T20:09:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	mohamed_amine	 12.04 should have both 2d and 3d, in 12.10 there is no distinction
