2006-05-10T14:22:00.000Z	FurryNemesis		does anyone know of a terminal command that'll clean up unnecessary files? (like disc cleanup in WinXP) ?
2006-05-10T14:22:00.000Z	gnomefreak	FurryNemesis	sudo apt-get autoclean
2006-05-10T14:23:00.000Z	gnomefreak	FurryNemesis	the files that scroll by are being deleted
