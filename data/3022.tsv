2012-10-07T00:52:00.000Z	gordonjcp	LordOfTime	it's not really opinion, sorry if you don't agree
2012-10-07T00:53:00.000Z	gordonjcp	LordOfTime	not to enter a beard-length-war but once you've written an X server you can criticise me ;-)
2012-10-07T00:54:00.000Z	LordOfTime	gordonjcp	 which is what guntbert has been saying all along, you're a tad late to the convo :/
