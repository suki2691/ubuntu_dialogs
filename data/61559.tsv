2010-11-06T23:05:00.000Z	jetienne	Dr_Willis	i got a package avaiilable in 2 repositories, one official, one in a ppa, how do i force it to get it from the second repository ?
2010-11-06T23:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jetienne	 the ppa version should be higher so it uses that.. ive never had a ppa version be a lower version.  You could use teh package manager tool (synaptic) and show the ppa repo packages and select them
