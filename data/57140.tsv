2009-05-25T06:24:00.000Z	filthynoob		what would be the easiest way to do this?
2009-05-25T06:24:00.000Z	filthynoob		copying and pasting the folder in both directories won't work because the folder is huge
2009-05-25T06:24:00.000Z	ozzmosis	filthynoob	right-click on the folder in Nautlius .. use Sharing
