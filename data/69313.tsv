I have my main desktop that I use, and I have an older box that just sits in my closet.  Currently on my XP machine, I have a dual monitor setup.  I am wondering if it would be easy to setup Ubuntu to work on my dual screen box, and then have a "headless" windows box with my older desktop that is currently not in use?
