2008-05-01T22:37:00.000Z	[Lowkey]		Can someone help me? Everytime I try to unrar a rar file it gives me this error: The filename "LstS02E07_GrY.part1.rar" indicates that this file is of type "RAR archive".  I have unrar installed and yesterday it worked fine. When I click the actual Icon it turns white and is recognized as an HTML file.. Please help.
