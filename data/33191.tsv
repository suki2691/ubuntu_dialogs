2011-04-07T03:18:00.000Z	ivanberia		does anyone know how to lock out an ip that fails to connect to ssh 5 times in a minute for 10 minutes?
2011-04-07T03:18:00.000Z	ivanberia		it was suggested i should use iptables
2011-04-07T03:19:00.000Z	ivanberia		but the only way i can think of is to have a script parsing the ssh log files looking for failed attempts and modifying iptables
