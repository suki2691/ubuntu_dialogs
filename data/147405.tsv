2007-01-29T16:50:00.000Z	shatrat	jkillaz	System -> Preferences -> fonts
2007-01-29T16:51:00.000Z	jkillaz	shatrat	so just like I thought it is the subpixel smoothing (LCD)?
2007-01-29T16:52:00.000Z	shatrat	jkillaz	the subpixel smoothing doesnt actually look as good as some of the other settings on my LCD.  Im on a 20.1 inch at 1680x1050 though, it might look best on your laptop.  Just choose whichever one has a better looking Preview
