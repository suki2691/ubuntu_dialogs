2008-11-09T00:25:00.000Z	RainCT		My webcam works fine with cheese but if I try to use it with VLC it has framerate 0.00 (in the advanced options) and I can't change it. Any idea?
2008-11-09T00:27:00.000Z	mcphail	RainCT	does "LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libv4l/v4l1compat.so vlc" help?
2008-11-09T00:30:00.000Z	RainCT	mcphail	nope :(
