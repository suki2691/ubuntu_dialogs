2006-09-21T16:49:00.000Z	philipsmith		I'm trying to use remote desktop to access an XP machine on my network. The XP machine is set up properly and the firewall allows remote access. When I use Remote Desktop and put the computer name, username, and password in, I get an error box: unresolved host. What am I doing wrong?
