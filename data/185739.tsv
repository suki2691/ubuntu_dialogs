2007-10-19T04:01:00.000Z	skyrocker67		I am going to reinstall 7.04 and do the update instead
2007-10-19T04:02:00.000Z	sivik	skyrocker67	why not just skip the install of 7.04 and install 7.10 if thats what you want
2007-10-19T04:02:00.000Z	sivik	skyrocker67	its kinda a extra step not needed
2007-10-19T04:03:00.000Z	sivik	skyrocker67	what kind of problem is it?
