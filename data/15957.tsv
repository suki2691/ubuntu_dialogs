2011-05-02T20:23:00.000Z	nick87720z		Just tried update-initramfs -u -k all, and got line: "grep: /boot/config-2.6.32-26-generic: No such file or directory". Usually i remove old kernels, for now i have 2.6.32-31 for generic and preempt. Of course, initramfs file is created. I removed item in /lib/modules, but it is helpless. I have nothing installed with version 2.6.32-26*
