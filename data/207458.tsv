2006-03-20T14:21:00.000Z	pvd2006		Alright, I got APache web server 2.0 running. I am confused as to where to put the html, cgi, pl files. I mean since its hosted on my own IP and im just using it to test cgi scripts I dont need to ftp anything. There should be some directory on Ubuntu where I can load those files and they will show up when I goto my local site, right?
