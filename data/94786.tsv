2008-04-19T20:21:00.000Z	Stev1		Can anyone help me fixing my user account..
2008-04-19T20:21:00.000Z	noob13	Stev1	whats wrong with it?
2008-04-19T20:22:00.000Z	noob13	Stev1	maybe u've been removed from the sudoers list. or is this not the case?
2008-04-19T20:23:00.000Z	noob13	Stev1	the error suggests u ARE root. just something else is failing. or is the problem that you really can't sudo anything?
