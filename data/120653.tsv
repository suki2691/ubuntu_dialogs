2009-07-07T00:02:00.000Z	ronj		I'm looking for a way to know in which package an installed binary comes from, and can't get Google to answer me. anybody?
2009-07-07T00:03:00.000Z	danbhfive	ronj	there is a dpkg command, something like dpkg -S
2009-07-07T00:06:00.000Z	ronj	danbhfive	that's exactly what I needed. thanks!
