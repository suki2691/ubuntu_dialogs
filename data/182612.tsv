2006-06-14T05:46:00.000Z	anzio_		Trying to update to Breezy but I get this error Failed to fetch http://theli.free.fr/packages/breezy/./Packages.gz 404 Not Found
2006-06-14T05:47:00.000Z	anzio_		I get that error actually on three accounts but I figured 1 would suffice
2006-06-14T05:47:00.000Z	stevekl	anzio_	remove that entry from sources.list
2006-06-14T05:48:00.000Z	stevekl	anzio_	It's in /etc/apt/
