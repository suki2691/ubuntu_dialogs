2012-01-12T03:40:00.000Z	sskalnik	BladeMcCool	 Do you have reason to believe your provider would try to mess with your box?
2012-01-12T03:44:00.000Z	BladeMcCool	sskalnik	its probably going to be hosting some forex related stuff for people in iran to use -- major target for governmental weiner types to think about trying to mess with i think :(
