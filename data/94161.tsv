2008-04-24T18:08:00.000Z	Y0Gi		hey. can anybody tell me which way http://packages.ubuntu.com/ uses to determine the default release in the select menu? is there any? I use hardy since many weeks, but not it's released and still "gutsy" is selected by default :(
2008-04-24T18:09:00.000Z	jrib	Y0Gi	there's just a default that should be updated relatively soon
2008-04-24T18:09:00.000Z	Y0Gi		I already sniffed the HTTP dialogue, but didn't find anything that looks like some identifier. and the user-agent shouldn't be it.
2008-04-24T18:09:00.000Z	Y0Gi	jrib	Pelo, Pici: I see, thank you very much.
