2005-04-15T10:52:00.000Z	Pete051		I've just got ubuntu 4.10 up and running but for some reason evolution refuses to talk to my pop server, any ideas anyone?
2005-04-15T10:52:00.000Z	FR500	Pete051	maybe server doesnt run on a standard port
2005-04-15T10:53:00.000Z	FR500	Pete051	never worked or just stoped working
