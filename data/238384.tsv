2006-05-19T16:46:00.000Z	Mum		Hi all..   quick question.. how does one recover a forgotten password?
2006-05-19T16:46:00.000Z	Determinist	Mum	you're talking about the sudo password for your machine?
2006-05-19T16:47:00.000Z	Determinist	Mum	what Rondom asked... if you cant log into the machine you're kinda nailed lol
2006-05-19T16:49:00.000Z	Determinist	Mum	well, you can do this: either reinstall the system if you have 40 spare mins or look online for a tutorial on how to recover passwords
