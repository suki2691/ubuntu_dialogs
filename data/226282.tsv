2010-09-02T01:49:00.000Z	ShadarLogoth		anyone recommend a file system on ubuntu for partitions over 16TB?
2010-09-02T01:49:00.000Z	Muelli	ShadarLogoth	probably anything except FAT or NTFS :>
2010-09-02T01:52:00.000Z	Muelli	ShadarLogoth	how do you know "it doesn't work">
2010-09-02T02:28:00.000Z	Muelli	ShadarLogoth	well. then ext4 might not support >16TB just yet.
