2010-10-11T18:34:00.000Z	DeadmanIncJS		just upgraded to 10.10 and for some reason when i view a youtube video in full screen, the screen image freezes
2010-10-11T18:34:00.000Z	DeadmanIncJS		any reason why?
2010-10-11T18:34:00.000Z	CajunLANMan	DeadmanIncJS	I'm having the same issue.
2010-10-11T18:36:00.000Z	CajunLANMan	DeadmanIncJS	I'm not sure if it's flash specific, or not. I didn't have the issue in 10.04 either.
