2006-12-18T07:31:00.000Z	ski-worklap	torpor	yea, you should be able to just remove the kde packages and install gnome
2006-12-18T07:31:00.000Z	torpor	ski-worklap	is there a simple apt-get for that?
2006-12-18T07:32:00.000Z	ski-worklap	torpor	probably. ubuntuforums is your friend, i'm sure someone has documented the process there
