2006-10-13T09:21:00.000Z	rasputnik	jmspeex	bogomips are just made up
2006-10-13T09:22:00.000Z	jmspeex	rasputnik	I know they're made up, but I'd thought that two CPUs on the same die should behave the same.
2006-10-13T09:23:00.000Z	rasputnik	jmspeex	me too :) but that's why they tell you it's made up, I suppose
