2008-02-16T23:00:00.000Z	cens0red	LukeLM	yeah, it's supposed to be a floppy. Only I don't have a floppy! I also commented out the entry for /dev/fd0 in fstab, then restarted, but I still have the same problem.
2008-02-16T23:01:00.000Z	cens0red	LukeLM	I'm trying to reformat a partition, but gparted just hangs, spits out the above error in the command line, and does nothing.
