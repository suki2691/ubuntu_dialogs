2008-07-30T19:26:00.000Z	socketbind	yugo	sometimes i get 100% cpu, mem and swap. can it be caused by a known bug?
2008-07-30T19:29:00.000Z	yugo	socketbind	i heard  it caused by something related with xorg
2008-07-30T19:29:00.000Z	socketbind	yugo	i really hope it gets shorted out. it is so bad that the system gets into extreme swapping and dies.
