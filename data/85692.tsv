2012-07-04T14:54:00.000Z	gaelfx	Oli_	if you have a 64-bit processor, I would choose 64-bit, if you're not sure, 32-bit should work no matter what your processor is
2012-07-04T14:56:00.000Z	gaelfx	Oli_	as a person who has used a fair number of netbooks, I strongly advise 32-bit
2012-07-04T14:57:00.000Z	gaelfx	Oli_	not exactly, but that's the main advantage
