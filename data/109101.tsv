2007-12-21T20:53:00.000Z	Torren2	brobostigon	It's not there.. that's what I'm saying.. It was working before but now it's not there when I boot.. I never changed anything in my fstab
2007-12-21T20:57:00.000Z	Torren2	brobostigon	I installed uswsusp to try to get my hibernate to work... And then I did s2disk -resume_device /dev/sda4 .. that's when the swap started disappearing after boot
