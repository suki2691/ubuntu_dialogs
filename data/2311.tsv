2012-08-30T03:47:00.000Z	Spectacle_K	blackshirt	I mean I just want to be able to do a clean install, run a script or whatever and it starts installing all the apps and programmes I had on Ubuntu before the reinstall. That way I don't have to manually click install in the software centre for each programme.
