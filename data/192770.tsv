2006-03-28T16:28:00.000Z	Jemt		Greets. Firefox crashed... again.. I'm tired of restarting the computer because Firefox locks my profile. Is there some sort of work around? I have tried 'killall firefox' - but my profile is still locked and I get this error when I try to start it again: Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system

2006-03-28T16:29:00.000Z	Jemt	mYoric	I know. But I'm not going to remove my profile directory each time Firefox crashes (which is more often then IE :-S)
