2011-05-26T23:52:00.000Z	jxshxx		I'm setting up a dual boot of XP Home and 10.04LTS.  Any reason I should create a partion for XP when I put it on?  Or, should I just let it do it's thing and wait to partition when I add Ubuntu?

2011-05-26T23:56:00.000Z	jxshxx	BorgTK2001	I suppose I only need about 10% of the drive.  Is it better to start with a partition for XP, knowing that?
2011-05-26T23:58:00.000Z	jxshxx	BorgTK2001	I get it.  Thanks!
