2009-07-28T19:05:00.000Z	syr64		Just received new hardware.  Quad core machine with more drive space.  Looking move our LAMP server to it for internet company website.  Which version of server should I use?
2009-07-28T19:05:00.000Z	Halitech	syr64	8.04 server
2009-07-28T19:06:00.000Z	Halitech	syr64	if its a production server, I'd stick with 8.04
