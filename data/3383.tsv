2012-10-19T23:08:00.000Z	Aleksander		Hello :) Is there an option to prevent ubuntu desktop installer from installing GRUB?
2012-10-19T23:09:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Aleksander	You can install grub to the install partition rather then the mbr.
2012-10-19T23:10:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Aleksander	Arch neds to be mounted when you have been installed to be seen by the os-prober
2012-10-19T23:11:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Aleksander	Fedora 17 has the same issues with needing a mount to be seen.
