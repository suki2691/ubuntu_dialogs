2007-02-12T17:19:00.000Z	Raging_Hog		Can I install Ubuntu on a 96mb RAM machine? I intend to switch to fluxbox immediately
2007-02-12T17:20:00.000Z	Ian-C	Raging_Hog	- You could try Puppy Linux - it is very small and would run on that size of machine
2007-02-12T17:21:00.000Z	Raging_Hog	Ian-C	it's going to a person who does't know practically anything about computers. I trust ubuntu to be the safest choice
2007-02-12T17:24:00.000Z	Raging_Hog	Ian-C	I've played around a bit with puppy. I'd rather give her something that atleast I know well
