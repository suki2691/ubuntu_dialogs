2009-02-12T20:55:00.000Z	Aiot		I'm having a problem getting the Nvidia drivers working on a Dell xps m1340 with a Nvidia 9500m card.  If I install any of the restricted drivers and reboot I get a black screen that says "No Screens" and I cant start X.  Any help would be awsome

2009-02-12T20:56:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Aiot	what version Nvidia drivers did you install?
