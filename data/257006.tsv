2006-12-06T14:03:00.000Z	phoenix87ta		having difficulty burning CD-R under Ubuntu Edgy.  After selecting files to be burned, I'm asked to insert a blank CD-R.  I've got one in, and it recognizes it as a blank insofar as Ubuntu is concerned, but the burning process fails to recognize it.  anyone seen anything like this, and know a fix for it?
