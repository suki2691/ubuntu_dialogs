2005-09-18T16:07:00.000Z	Kilter		I want to put a wiki up on my ubuntu box, is there a good package with reasonable information to use?
2005-09-18T16:08:00.000Z	bob2	Kilter	moin is pretty good and has a reasonable security record
2005-09-18T16:14:00.000Z	bob2	Kilter	you'll want the moin package
2005-09-18T16:16:00.000Z	Kilter	bob2	the moin package was depreciated.
