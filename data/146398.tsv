2007-02-07T11:09:00.000Z	onefish		I'd like to be able to change screensaver settings.  But the screensaver dialog doesn't have that option, you only get the default screensaver. :(  Is there a workaround?

2007-02-07T11:25:00.000Z	onefish	cables	what screensaver manager are you using?
2007-02-07T11:25:00.000Z	cables	onefish	whatever's in gnome...
