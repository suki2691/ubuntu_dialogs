2007-03-03T14:20:00.000Z	vox754	ardchoille	what do you use, and why?
2007-03-03T14:21:00.000Z	ardchoille	vox754	I use irssi because it allows me to log in and out of different window managers without quitting irc.. and I can use it in tty 1-6
2007-03-03T14:22:00.000Z	ardchoille	vox754	There are days when I don't even have X running. screen sessions + irssi + elinks allows me to chat and websurf in tty1 ;)
