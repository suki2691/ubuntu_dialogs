2010-09-08T06:43:00.000Z	acc_		Hello, #Ubuntu.  A few years ago, I set up a Dell machine for my father-in-law.  At the time, it was pre-installed with LTS (Hardy).  I switched the machine over to Intrepid to get a few bleeding edge software upgrades installed.  I want to bring the machine up-to-date now.  Should I start making my way towards Lucid or Maverick?  Thanks.
