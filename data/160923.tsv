2010-07-21T13:48:00.000Z	ayush27		I need to run linux on my desktop for academic reasons. I'm an IT engineering student. the problem is that my PC is a 700 MHz pentium 3 with 384 MB RAM. which version of ubuntu shall I use?
2010-07-21T13:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ayush27	I'd go with lubuntu.
2010-07-21T13:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ayush27	I disagree with st__, I think that lubuntu will run fine on that hardware.
