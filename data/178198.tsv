2008-05-07T00:14:00.000Z	Martiini		How do I duplicate a linux system? Can I just TAR a system and unpack to another partition? partimage needs a same-size partition to restore to, right? ... or .. should I install base system and use dpkg --get-selections .. or ...  .. and How about Mondo, bubackup, sbackup and such ?

2008-05-07T00:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Martiini	look into dd    as in man dd from a terminal
