2007-01-08T11:39:00.000Z	crav		i have a broadcom 4318 wireless that is an absolute bitch to install. Is it worth my $17 to get a new wireless card?
2007-01-08T11:40:00.000Z	James__	crav	have you gotten it working?
2007-01-08T11:42:00.000Z	James__	crav	i've got a 1390 and it works sporadically for me... but i would say for 17 bucks, it's worthingetting something else
2007-01-08T11:45:00.000Z	James__	crav	not heard anything about the airnet card... check out this thread.. they discuss several cards that worked out of the box: http://www.seungpyo.com/stacksandpiles/2006/07/02/broadcom-wireless-in-ubuntu-dapper-606/
