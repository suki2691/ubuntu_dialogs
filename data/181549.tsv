2006-06-11T09:06:00.000Z	weedar	gavagai	actually I already have partitioned correctly, the problem is that the drive in question (hdb) has an ext3 partion, a swap one and a vfat partition - If I choose automatic partition the installer wants to erase the vfat partition :/
2006-06-11T09:06:00.000Z	gavagai	weedar	oh i see.
