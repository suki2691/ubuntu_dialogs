2009-12-08T09:31:00.000Z	Chr|s		Hi there, just recently installed the wrong version of ubuntu. I wanted 64bit but installed 32bit instead. First time installing Ubuntu on this machine. Unable to get the 64bit disc to load up on start up to install
2009-12-08T09:32:00.000Z	Chr|s		yes it does
2009-12-08T09:32:00.000Z	jonz	Chr|s	is it a cd you got from ubuntu? or did you burn it yourself?
2009-12-08T09:33:00.000Z	jonz	Chr|s	if not - do it now on the iso (if you stil have it)
