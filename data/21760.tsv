2011-01-06T09:01:00.000Z	Nach0z	r00t4rd3d	: it still refuses to install. Nanoha : i can't run dpkg --configure on a package that isn't installed :/
2011-01-06T09:03:00.000Z	r00t4rd3d	Nach0z	run synaptic package manager , goto Edit , Fix broken packages , try that
2011-01-06T09:05:00.000Z	Nach0z	r00t4rd3d	it's a server. it doesn't have a GUI :/ unless there's a terminal version of synaptic that I don't know about?
