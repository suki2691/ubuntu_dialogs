2012-05-28T10:15:00.000Z	Lym		Does anyone know how to clear the current apt queue? I accidentally selected too many packages for download. I want to clear the current queue for packages that will be installed by apt-get -f install

2012-05-28T10:18:00.000Z	Lym	wilee-nilee	the only partial install is crossover office which I was about to get the dependencies for when I discovered I had accidentally selected over 200 packages for install
2012-05-28T10:19:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Lym	not sure here really, best of luck, if it was me I would let it all install then clean out correctly with purges of what you did not want.
