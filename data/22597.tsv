2011-08-28T00:49:00.000Z	ArseneRei	yeats	Volume works fine. I'm just trying to reduce gnome dependencies.
2011-08-28T00:50:00.000Z	yeats	ArseneRei	alsa and pulseaudio are independent of GNOME, fwiw
2011-08-28T00:51:00.000Z	ArseneRei	yeats	I have been using alsamixer, but I was looking for an applet, or a least a way to control volume with my media keys.
