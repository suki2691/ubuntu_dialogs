2008-02-17T03:42:00.000Z	th0ger_ifa		I have serious problems with the firefox/gnash plugin, mozilla-plugin-gnash 0.8.1-0ubuntu3. It just shows some scrambled images (no video/sound). Right click menu works. Its on gutsy, ibookG4 powerpc. And mostly it takes 100% cpu! Youtube works, but nowhere else... Non-plugin gnash seems to work fine. Known bug? Where do i find gnash logs? Any hints appreciated!
