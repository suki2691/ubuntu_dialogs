2009-04-30T07:15:00.000Z	rantic		Hi everyone, I just downloaded the installer for Regnum online and am having troubles installing/compiling?
2009-04-30T07:17:00.000Z	rantic		Could anyone help me? I'm trying to install a .bin file
2009-04-30T07:17:00.000Z	raylu	rantic	this wouldn't happen to be a video driver, would it?
2009-04-30T07:18:00.000Z	rantic	raylu	It's an mmorpg I found for linux, the file is a .bin and despite trying to follow this guide http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/linux-tutorials-howtos-reference-material/64958-how-install-software-linux.html#post344062 it didn't work
