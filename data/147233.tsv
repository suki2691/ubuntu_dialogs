2007-02-09T06:47:00.000Z	HP_Vue		Hey, I am wanting to start up my own server, but I have extremely valuable files on my computer and other computers on my network, is ubuntu the right distro to be using for this job?
2007-02-09T06:47:00.000Z	LiENUS	HP_Vue	 if you keep track of security then yes
2007-02-09T06:49:00.000Z	HP_Vue	LiENUS	Is there a 0 percent chance of my computer or other computers on my network being compromised?
2007-02-09T06:51:00.000Z	LiENUS	HP_Vue	no, but theres never 0 percent change of your computer being compromised unless it is disconnected from all devices, from all networks, and powered off and disconected from the power
