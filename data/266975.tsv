2009-12-19T00:43:00.000Z	weq		Hi I'm having some issues with grub, dual boot windows xp and ubuntu.
2009-12-19T00:44:00.000Z	weq		5 sata hdd and 1 ide hdd.
2009-12-19T00:44:00.000Z	weq		and windows is on one sata and linux is on another sata but hd1,0 ain't the correct windows drive anymore
2009-12-19T00:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	weq	 ive noticed on some of my machines. if you use teh bios menus to select what hd to 'boot' it becomes the sda (or hd1 in grub2 terms)
