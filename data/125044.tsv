2007-10-15T09:10:00.000Z	rolandd		I am member of the group www-data, how come I cannot edit files with permission 644?
2007-10-15T09:10:00.000Z	scguy318	rolandd	do those files belong to you or your group?
2007-10-15T09:11:00.000Z	scguy318	rolandd	and if its 644, then wouldn't your group be ro?
2007-10-15T09:12:00.000Z	scguy318	rolandd	since the permissions are 644, then your group only has read-only permission I believe
