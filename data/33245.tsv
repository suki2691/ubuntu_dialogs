2010-07-16T10:42:00.000Z	Loshki	gwern	welcome to grub2, a complete rewrite of grub, and a bit of a mess...
2010-07-16T10:44:00.000Z	Loshki	gwern	um, try editing GRUB_TIMEOUT in /etc/default/grub
2010-07-16T10:47:00.000Z	Loshki	gwern	it's worse than that. Grub2 is now configured in multiple different files in different places...
