2007-05-30T16:09:00.000Z	anAngel		Hello Could anybody suggest me a good and with a lots of features monitoring tool for a router? I am searching for easy to setup out of the box monitoring tool with lots of features. I want to know what traffic comes in and out of the router what is being stopped etc. Or at least with lots of modules ready for install.
