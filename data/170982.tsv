2006-08-14T10:36:00.000Z	debuntu		man, swat, webmin etc only make samba more confusing
2006-08-14T10:37:00.000Z	Flannel	debuntu	nah.  If you're comfortable with vi, more power to you.  We usually recommend nano though, as it's easier than explaining to dozensof people how to use vi ;)
2006-08-14T10:38:00.000Z	debuntu	Flannel	yeah wasn't advocating vi (never!), more saying that for most people's samba, the options in smb.conf are very simple
