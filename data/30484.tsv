I have a dual booted machine, grub loads fine, when I select ubuntu it freezes at the loading screen. But in recovery mode I can browse all my files I just can't start X.

2011-11-22T00:08:00.000Z	tyler_d	m1ck3y	did you check your grub settings for hd 0,0 etc?
2011-11-22T00:09:00.000Z	m1ck3y	tyler_d	I don't know how to do that
