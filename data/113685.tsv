2008-12-01T08:42:00.000Z	RivitingOne		I need some help finding a ATI video driver that will work with wine to play world of warcraft.  The card is a Powercolor X800 GTO. I have read about using the open source, and proprietary drivers as well as using EnvyNG (which I just tried) Can someone please suggest a driver source and the reason for choosing that driver please?

2008-12-01T08:47:00.000Z	nottha_k	RivitingOne	my honest recommendations are 1) just use windows to play games. 2) if you insist on using linux, use an nvidia card. 3) If you insist on using linux and on usixng ati Don't play games anymore :). I chose number 3 for myself.
