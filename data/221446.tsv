2010-02-08T13:26:00.000Z	almark1		I'm trying to get a version of Ubuntu called 64 studio to allow me to use xorg.conf, but when I config it my mouse is gone. And so I have to delete the xorg again to get mouse function, what can I do to get it work?
2010-02-08T13:26:00.000Z	almark1		I know Ubuntu doesn't allow xorg so where is the config files to manually fix in Ubuntu?
