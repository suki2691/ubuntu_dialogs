2008-05-20T06:42:00.000Z	Steve-cal		Is there anyone here who uses Pulseaudio as their audio driver? I would just like some people's ideas of how well it works, and how well it works as a replacement for ALSA?
2008-05-20T06:43:00.000Z	soldats	Steve-cal	ive heard from some friends that pulseaudio cant or wasnt able to run on multiple apps at the same time
2008-05-20T06:45:00.000Z	Steve-cal	soldats	Interesting, I was looking at its description in Synaptic and it claims to be able to mix multiple audio streams together. But your friends had problems with it? Did they figure it out or just give it up?
