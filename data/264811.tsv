2005-09-14T05:41:00.000Z	communico		hi, I'm trying to install some harddrives in my new ubuntu setup. I'm unsure which howto doc I should be following. can anyone tell me the difference between a hardware raid and a software raid?

2005-09-14T05:47:00.000Z	bur[n] er	communico	you sure you want to be setting up a raid?  it's not for extra storage?
