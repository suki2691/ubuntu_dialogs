2008-12-07T03:46:00.000Z	makito249		I am running intrepid ibex and I can't find an ffmpeg-dev package. Can anyone help me?
2008-12-07T03:48:00.000Z	Slart	makito249	hmm.. there doesn't seem to be one..
2008-12-07T03:52:00.000Z	Slart	makito249	I don't really know.. I'm googling atm.. there are many people asking the same question.. but no answers so far
