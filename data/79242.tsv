2011-06-09T23:16:00.000Z	tvanover		I am trying to boot from a usb stick I created with ubuntu-11.04-alternate-i386.iso.  But when it tries to Run ubuntu from this USB or Install Ubuntu on a Hard Disk the menu goes away for a second then is back.  I can choose test memory boot from first hard disk advanced options and help successfully.  just not run or install
2011-06-09T23:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tvanover	did you MD5 test the iSO?
2011-06-09T23:19:00.000Z	tvanover	ActionParsnip	I am not seeing the checksum in the page to check it.
2011-06-09T23:22:00.000Z	tvanover	ActionParsnip	I can md5 the iso and I get a checksum.  However I cannot find the checksum to compare it to.
