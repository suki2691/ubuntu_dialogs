2005-05-28T12:12:00.000Z	Burgundavia	ferchO	is OpenOffice not good enough?
2005-05-28T12:16:00.000Z	ferchO	Burgundavia	i read on their page that crossover wont run office 2003
2005-05-28T12:17:00.000Z	Burgundavia	ferchO	Try openoffice, and if that doesn't work, then try office 2003 under crossover. I remember reading something about it too
