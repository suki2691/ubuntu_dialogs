2007-11-24T23:59:00.000Z	dahitokiri	n08l3J	, sudo make uninstall in the source directory
2007-11-25T00:03:00.000Z	dahitokiri	n08l3J	by hand then. or to do a make -n install keep track of the files that are put in the directories, and remove em yourself
2007-11-25T00:03:00.000Z	dahitokiri	n08l3J	its a bitch, but it's probably the only option left
