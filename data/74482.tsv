2009-12-30T02:09:00.000Z	invisime		on my ubuntu 9.10 server I have symbolic links in ~ folder to an external hard drive mounted at /mnt/vault. I am running vsftpd and one of the other computers on my network (running xubuntu 9.10) has access to the external via filezilla. my eeepc on windows 7 running filezilla, however, does not display any of the contents of /mnt/vault. any guesses as to cause?
2009-12-30T02:11:00.000Z	mister_roboto	invisime	did you add the link after win 7 was already connected? try reconnecting?
2009-12-30T02:13:00.000Z	invisime	mister_roboto	huh. I could've sworn I already tried that, but it worked this time. *shrugs* thanks for your help. :)
2009-12-30T02:14:00.000Z	mister_roboto	invisime	glad it was something easy ;)
