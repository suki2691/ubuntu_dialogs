2011-04-29T02:13:00.000Z	lucas		hi! Installed natty beta2 a week ago. Now that the official release is out, do I have to reinstall again?
2011-04-29T02:13:00.000Z	kdubois	lucas	do an apt-get upgrade, should be all up to par
2011-04-29T02:14:00.000Z	lucas	kdubois	no dist-upgrade necessary?
2011-04-29T02:15:00.000Z	kdubois	lucas	you already did the dist-upgrade, if you do a regular apt-get upgrade, you'll just sync up the packages that were finalized between when you installed the alpha, and now, the official release
