2008-02-28T23:25:00.000Z	SpudDogg		Hello all.  No matter how many linux distros I try out, I always come back to Ubuntu.  Nice to be here :)
2008-02-28T23:27:00.000Z	SpudDogg		Does anyone know how Ubuntu will react if I try to recompile my kernel?  There seems to be a lot of modules I do not need, so I'm sure there's plenty of things built in I don't need.
