2009-08-09T17:05:00.000Z	EgyptianMan		i'm using windows xp , and i'm thinking to install ubuntu and use it instead, but i have a questions , about the applecations that can be running on  ubuntu and linux generally , because many people says that there is very few applcations including Programs, games, etc that can run on linux bases OS
