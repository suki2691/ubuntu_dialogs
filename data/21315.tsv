2010-12-27T04:13:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	gela	why not?
2010-12-27T04:13:00.000Z	gela	ilovefairuz	the card is not auto mounting.. I used dd to copy a bootable image to it for one reason, and I'd like to make the card usable for storage now
2010-12-27T04:16:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	gela	did you try mkdosfs on the card?
