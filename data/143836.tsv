2007-03-22T06:45:00.000Z	ali1234		i doubt it is a routing problem since all i did was plug all the machines into a switch, then plug that into an ipcop box. and that's all worked fine for two years...
2007-03-22T06:45:00.000Z	ali1234		and yeah... i have tried a different switch, and different cables :/
