2006-11-09T17:40:00.000Z	dooglus	webben	I doubt it.  they're in ubuntu universe...
2006-11-09T17:41:00.000Z	webben		yeah ... in that case I'd tend to prefer the latest xpi
2006-11-09T17:43:00.000Z	dooglus	webben	for instance, the first one I checked, image zoom is 0.2.5 in the repository and 0.2.7 on https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/139/ .  0.2.7 was released Sep 26, 2006, about 2 weeks ago.
