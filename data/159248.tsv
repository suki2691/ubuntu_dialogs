2006-11-14T15:13:00.000Z	blue_guy		I notice a lot of people joining this room with usernames like n=user  ... I'm wondering what IRC client(s) do that
2006-11-14T15:14:00.000Z	mhz	blue_guy	I do not know. I am using GAIM now, instead of Xchat (prefer the latter)
2006-11-14T15:14:00.000Z	blue_guy	mhz	yeah, that's what I'm using (XChat)
