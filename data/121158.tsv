2007-11-19T02:59:00.000Z	cornell		I'm having trouble ejecting an external drive.  When I look at File Browser/Computer, I see it in the places list and name list.  Trying to eject by name, it says it's writing do it, do not remove it.  But when I right-click on it in the places list, mount is the only option offered.  Does this mean it's not mounted and I can, in fact, remove it?
