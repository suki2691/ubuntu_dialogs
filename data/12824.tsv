2011-08-13T17:17:00.000Z	damno		can I ask a ffmpeg related Q here?  their official channel seems to be mute
2011-08-13T17:18:00.000Z	damno		is there a param I should use if I dont want to record audio or should I just omit -acodec?
2011-08-13T17:20:00.000Z	dr-willis	damno	 i think i saw that in their faq on spliting audio/video once.
2011-08-13T17:22:00.000Z	damno	dr-willis	I dont know why my vdo recording is stopping mid ways..  may be because the audio input device specified isn't right...   but I dont really need audio
