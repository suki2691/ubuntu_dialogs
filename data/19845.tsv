2011-07-22T22:53:00.000Z	ciss		our ubuntu server 10.04 (virtualbox guest) freezes on boot, immediately after "Running /scripts/init-bottom ... Done."
2011-07-22T22:54:00.000Z	ciss		i've seen in another paste that the next step in the boot process would be to mount /dev - is this correct?
2011-07-22T22:55:00.000Z	aetas	ciss	I believe so
2011-07-22T22:56:00.000Z	ciss	aetas	then what could possibly prevent /dev from being mounted, without giving any errors?
