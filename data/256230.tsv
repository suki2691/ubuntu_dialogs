2008-11-03T17:48:00.000Z	oohelp		Hi! I'm using some ajax web-based irc, because I don't have an irc client installed atm on my windows machine. I have a question: How can you delete recent files/documents history in Open Office? I can't find the feature so I think I'll switch to AbiWord and Gnumerics. Any ideas? Could the Ubuntu team suggest that feature to Open Office. I tried, but no reply.
2008-11-03T17:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	oohelp	 i would check the Openoffice channel and website/docs - i imagine theres a way to do it.
2008-11-03T17:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	oohelp	 from a quick google at  http://www.oooforum.org/forum/viewtopic.phtml?t=65992   - there seems tobe some macros made that do just that.. or you can manually delete some cache type file.
2008-11-03T17:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	oohelp	 some of the later comments mentiont hat the macro does work.. but  Im not using OOo so i cant test it. Good luck. and id say ask in  the Openoffice channel.  could be its going to be in OOO3
