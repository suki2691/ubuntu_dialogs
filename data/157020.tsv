2006-11-30T17:58:00.000Z	tuna-fish-		Dumb scripting question: I want to have the name of every file in current dir and it's subdirs fed into the stdin, is there an easy way?
2006-11-30T17:58:00.000Z	tuna-fish-		not possible with find, I think.
2006-11-30T17:59:00.000Z	tuna-fish-		dumb me.  I meant every file but a file whose name does NOT match the regulart expression. perhaps i should go to sleep
