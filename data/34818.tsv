2010-05-20T10:49:00.000Z	optical		Hello all, quick question if there are any SSH experts.  I have my home machine that I need someone to SSH into but don't want to give him my public IP address.  I also have an external monthly VPS that I have root on.  Can I make some kind of port forward on my VPS to point to my home IP, but let the person connect through VPS address instead?  Sounds confusing but basically like a bounce ?
