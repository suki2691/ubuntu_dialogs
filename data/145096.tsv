2008-09-09T03:03:00.000Z	c01100011		I am looking for a minimal panel (pypanel,bmpanel etc..) that works with compiz's multiple desktops.
2008-09-09T03:04:00.000Z	c01100011		every panel that i've tried treats compiz's multiple desktops all as one
2008-09-09T03:06:00.000Z	reportingsjr	c01100011	ubuntu isn't really the developers platform. :p
2008-09-09T03:06:00.000Z	reportingsjr	c01100011	too much of a pain to deal with packages and such.
