2007-06-02T05:58:00.000Z	Volsy		Hi, I'm having some trouble installing Ubuntu. Could someone find a minute to help me?
2007-06-02T05:58:00.000Z	lancer	Volsy	- what's happening?
2007-06-02T05:59:00.000Z	lancer	Volsy	isn't there an option on the intaller to "use rest of disk"?
2007-06-02T06:00:00.000Z	lancer	Volsy	in that case, use Defrag windows or whatever you have there ant then use Partition Magic (recommended) or similar to downsize that partition to make room
