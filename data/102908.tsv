2012-09-02T06:30:00.000Z	alberto		My flashplugin doesn't work in firefox 15.0 in ubuntu 11.10 (oneiric). Anyone knows how to solve this issue?
2012-09-02T06:30:00.000Z	histo	alberto	how'd you install the plugin and have you tried going to about:plugins   in your browser url to see what version it sees?
2012-09-02T06:36:00.000Z	alberto	histo	from about:plugins appears Shockwave Flash ( libflashplayer.so, Shockwave Flash 11.2 r202); this version is correct?
2012-09-02T06:39:00.000Z	histo	alberto	yes
