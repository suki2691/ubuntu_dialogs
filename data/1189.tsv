2012-09-10T08:45:00.000Z	nerdbromancer	crimsonmane	mate has been super buggy for me, i have used it in ubuntu and mate
2012-09-10T08:54:00.000Z	nerdbromancer	crimsonmane	from what i've seen it has a debian edition with debian repos not the installer. also what i am really just upset that my sound fn keys dont work with xfce in 12.04
2012-09-10T08:55:00.000Z	crimsonmane	nerdbromancer	you're not very informed about mint then. i'll join you in #ubuntu-offtopic if you'd like to chat about it. i think we're making the ops nervous here.
