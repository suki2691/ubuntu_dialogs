2007-01-18T17:28:00.000Z	morpheus74		 I typed apt-cache search unix2dos and the result is tofrodos.  I tried typing todos foo, and this command is not found.  Is this package standard with 6.06?
2007-01-18T17:29:00.000Z	LjL	morpheus74	just type unix2dos after installing tofrodos
2007-01-18T17:29:00.000Z	morpheus74	LjL	So i have to install tofordos, it's not standard with the 6.06 packages?
2007-01-18T17:30:00.000Z	LjL	morpheus74	i don't know if it's standard. i guess not, if you don't have unix2dos working
