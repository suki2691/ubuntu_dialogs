2006-05-13T16:57:00.000Z	iNiku	arrick1	what syntax?
2006-05-13T16:59:00.000Z	iNiku	arrick1	it wasn't a command, it was a paste from the mount output showing the mount options for the filesystem
2006-05-13T05:00:00.000Z	iNiku	arrick1	the command line would be mount -t vfat /dev/hde3 /win2 -o rw,gid=200,umask=007,quiet
