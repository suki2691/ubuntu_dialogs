2012-09-09T01:52:00.000Z	NEone		Hi. I wanted to try the LiveDVD of 12.10 Beta 1. But I can't even boot it. After the first splashscreen (black, with the keyboard icon and the "man in the circle" icon, graphics gets messed up. I don't see a boot-options menu or anything, just scrambled graphical artifacts. Already had the same effect with the 10.04 LiveDVD. What to do?

2012-09-09T01:54:00.000Z	NEone	dr_willis	Thanks, didn't know. Will try right now (it's on the other computer). brb
2012-09-09T02:15:00.000Z	NEone	dr_willis	Ok, the "nomodeset" actually worked for me. Thanks so much.
