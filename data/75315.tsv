2009-09-21T08:15:00.000Z	monostone		I have correctly installed and configured dnscache + tinydns. I have tested dnscache via a tail -f logfile, and it is correctly cacheing content. Now, I am setting up a development/test environment, so I am using internal IP's, but i can NOT manage, to get tinydns to resolve the domains on my local network (commands dnsq a host IP and dig @IP host return correct responses, but dnsqr host, dig host and dig @IP -x IP all fail). My resolv.
