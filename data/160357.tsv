2009-11-20T10:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	BableOn	Ubuntu is never supposed to delete configuration files that have been edited by the user, so it should either still be there or you should be able to generate an identical config file by re-installing lilo ( But I'm still curious why you would do such a thing :)
