2008-01-25T05:04:00.000Z	nickrud	jo1	you installed only gcc?  you should install build-essential, it brings in the generic headers
2008-01-25T05:05:00.000Z	jo1	nickrud	when you do that it asks for the ubuntu cd which i don't have any more
2008-01-25T05:05:00.000Z	nickrud	jo1	system->admin->software sources , enable the first four and disable the cdrom. You can get it from the net
