2008-03-24T08:44:00.000Z	anlek		I'm trying to setup a Linux server running in VMWare Server. And I want that linux server to have an external IP, (host machine is windows 2003 Server). Can anyone point me to where I can learn how to do this?
2008-03-24T08:45:00.000Z	mssever	anlek	it's in /etc/network/interfaces
2008-03-24T08:45:00.000Z	mssever	anlek	I believe that man interfaces will give you docs
2008-03-24T08:45:00.000Z	anlek	mssever	thanks I'll give that a try
