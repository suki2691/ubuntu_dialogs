2010-04-30T10:45:00.000Z	Teknical		ive asked this question in #kubunto as im running kubuntu 10.04 but no response and this may not be related to kubuntu alone so,..... im feelin stupid (probably so) but I have kubuntu 10.04 installed on my raid .. all is good there. I also have a 120 gig IDE in the mix somewhere that I use for storage and virtualbox's.. however at the moment I have no permission to create or do anything on the drive really? is there a proper way or a guide
2010-04-30T10:45:00.000Z	Teknical		 to show me how to set this up? I didnt have this problem in 9.10 it seemed to just work
