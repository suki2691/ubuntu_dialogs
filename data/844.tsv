2012-10-09T14:51:00.000Z	farrioth		I am making a dummy package for libfreetype6 (I have installed a patched version).  Currently I get the error:
2012-10-09T14:51:00.000Z	farrioth		 libfreetype6:amd64 2.4.9-infinality (Multi-Arch: no) is not co-installable with libfreetype6:i386 2.4.8-1ubuntu2 (Multi-Arch: same) which is currently installed
2012-10-09T14:51:00.000Z	farrioth		Is there a way to replace only the amd64 package?
