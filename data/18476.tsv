2011-03-26T04:42:00.000Z	scott__		I was looking for a distro to install alongside ubuntu, just to try.  I'm kind of a n00b.  Does anybody have any suggestions?
2011-03-26T04:44:00.000Z	scott__		thanks Dr_Willis...I've been reading about several distros, and I've even tried openSuse.  Is Knoppix too advanced for a newcomer?  Or does it (and other distros) just require some tinkering to learn?
2011-03-26T04:45:00.000Z	scott__		agreed abstrakt, I figured I should try to stretch myself by trying harder distros.  I didn't know if there was an "intermediate" distro
