2006-12-11T16:43:00.000Z	faLUCE		Hi, I can't find the conf file where it's set the default window manager...any idea?
2006-12-11T16:43:00.000Z	cafuego_	faLUCE	it's not in a config file (muaha)
2006-12-11T16:43:00.000Z	cafuego_	faLUCE	sudo update-alternatives --config x-window-manager
2006-12-11T16:44:00.000Z	cafuego_	faLUCE	It's managed via symbolic links in /etc/alternatives
