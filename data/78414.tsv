2009-01-05T04:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lacita	It's wubi, grub is being chainloaded from ntldr
2009-01-05T04:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	lacita	I don't think he will get stuck, I think he will just immediately go back to grub where he can choose to boot Ubuntu
2009-01-05T04:50:00.000Z	lacita	Jordan_U	just in case.
