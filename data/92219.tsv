2008-08-31T04:39:00.000Z	BigKahuna		thats..its my first time here so sorry if my etiquette isn't great :)  But I'm building a computer from ground up and I'd like to install Ubuntu on it...should I just download the installer file from the website then burn it to a CD?  Or is there a better and/or correct way?
