2007-07-03T06:39:00.000Z	CVirus		I just installed ubuntu intel_x86 on an AMD64 machine ... what might happen ?
2007-07-03T06:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	CVirus	It wont run as well as the amd version
2007-07-03T06:40:00.000Z	CVirus	Wolfwalker	in case crap might happen .. then I guess i'll install the correct version ... it is still installing actually .. not done yet
2007-07-03T06:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	CVirus	I did that by mistake once.  Didnt run bad, did it the other way amd on intel and wouldnt run
