2007-07-07T15:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	sebas_	automatix is best avoided. :)
2007-07-07T15:19:00.000Z	sebas_	dr_willis	I knew that someone would come up with that, but that is not what i'm saying
2007-07-07T15:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	sebas_	 its not sumnulating.. its ust launching a script with the gksu, or whatever commands. any other app COULD do so.
