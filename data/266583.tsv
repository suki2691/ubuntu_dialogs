2010-02-06T11:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gtr	 they should allready be able to run  the xchat program if its installed by default
2010-02-06T11:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gtr	 No idea what you did.. or why you would bother.
2010-02-06T11:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	gtr	 You could remove/purge/reinstall xchat i guess as a quick way to get it back to the defaults
