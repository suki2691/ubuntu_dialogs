2006-12-08T06:24:00.000Z	shwag		so I installed a kernel image and now I regret it. How do I put grub back to the old kernel ?
2006-12-08T06:25:00.000Z	anuragJ	shwag	whch kernel version do you use ?
2006-12-08T06:25:00.000Z	shwag	anuragJ	i just want to be on  linux-image-server ... but i mistakenly installed  linux-686-smp  which i want to get rid of.
2006-12-08T06:28:00.000Z	anuragJ	shwag	well, the second option is /boot/grub/menu.lst
