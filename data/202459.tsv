2010-07-24T22:59:00.000Z	Enox		Can someone help me install the sun-java6-jre  ?  I'm really screwed because I installed a open source version and ubuntu packages keep referencing the sun one, now nothing new will install without it.
2010-07-24T23:00:00.000Z	Enox		I'm using 10.04, universe repository is enabled.. And it can't find the package.
2010-07-24T23:01:00.000Z	Enox		Package sun-java6-jre is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2010-07-24T23:02:00.000Z	IdleOne	Enox	enable the partner repos in Software Sources then the sun packages will be available
