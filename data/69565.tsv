2010-09-02T09:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	turt1e	don't know never checked,  I'll take a look
2010-09-02T09:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	turt1e	i'm not sure how to check when it's running in full screen but even when not in full screen it seems to us 100% of one cpu full system shows as much as 60% cpu use
2010-09-02T09:48:00.000Z	turt1e	sacarlson	 yeah mine will usually peg one cpu to 60% to 80%.  I swear adobe flash player is a bloated mess
