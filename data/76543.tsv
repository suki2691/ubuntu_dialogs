2008-11-18T06:56:00.000Z	damijit		I want to get rid of my windows partition, and make everything ubuntu. I have just one fear: Will ubuntu music players be able to 1. Play DRM-locked music (such as music bought from iTunes store) and 2. Sync with my iPod?

2008-11-18T06:58:00.000Z	KillerOrca	damijit	since you're not changing anything on the iPod it will stay the same
