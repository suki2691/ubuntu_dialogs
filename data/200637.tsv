2007-02-24T16:34:00.000Z	pianoboy3333	pppoe_dude	I'm not trying to record something, I have no problems recording, but my friend is able to check input as output in gnome-volume-control, and he can like speak into his microphone, or plug his guitar in, and hear it through his speakers. No, he does not plug his guitar right into his speakers.
