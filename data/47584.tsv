2012-05-19T00:10:00.000Z	BLeg		Ive installed Ubuntu server with Gnome which starts by default. My system runs the UI extremely slowly, is it possible to revert back to commandline only until I can upgrade my hardware?
2012-05-19T00:11:00.000Z	BLeg		It's for an internal test server at my workplace
2012-05-19T00:11:00.000Z	BLeg		I needed a LAMP install
