2009-07-24T21:16:00.000Z	nduthoit	Mike_lifeguard	(using tar, look at the documentation, there's a command line argument to make it incremental)
2009-07-24T21:16:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		thanks
2009-07-24T21:17:00.000Z	nduthoit	Mike_lifeguard	it's the -u option (update: only append files that are newer than copy in archive)
