2011-10-25T21:54:00.000Z	jacobfogg		I was trying to tweak Unity and started following these instructions: http://askubuntu.com/questions/29553/how-can-i-configure-unity/62903#62903 ..... After opening the CompizConfig Setting Manager, which didn't look like the first image shown, I chose a tab on the left,  my screen blinked, and I lost all of the navigational stuff... the unity bar on the left, the menu stuff that lives at the top, etc... I logged out and back in and all I get is a desktop.
