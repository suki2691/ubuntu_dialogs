2010-06-30T03:59:00.000Z	Cyrusthebeast		How do you use a .deb? I'm on Ubuntu
2010-06-30T03:59:00.000Z	Cyrusthebeast		And from what I saw, .deb is for Debian
2010-06-30T04:00:00.000Z	\u03b5	Cyrusthebeast	first you must check if ubuntu provides what you seek to install already
2010-06-30T04:03:00.000Z	\u03b5	Cyrusthebeast	also full/absolute path is the correct term
