2008-12-01T03:55:00.000Z	malcom2073		I believe that would be it heh, thanks
2008-12-01T03:57:00.000Z	malcom2073		Hm, nope that's not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for a way to install commonly used build tools (libtool, autoconf, gcc, etc) as a group, or do I have to manually install each I need?
