2005-12-06T13:33:00.000Z	barongas		I want to copy the entire content of a drive to another, I've heard that it's better to mirror than to just cp, what command would I use to mirror it?
2005-12-06T13:33:00.000Z	Enyo	barongas	you mean, like Raid?
2005-12-06T13:33:00.000Z	Enyo	barongas	whats wrong with just tarring the filesystem and copying it over?
2005-12-06T13:34:00.000Z	barongas	Enyo	they're both in the same computer, I just want to transfer all the data from one drive to the other, locally.
