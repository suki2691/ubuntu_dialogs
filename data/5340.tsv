2012-10-31T13:02:00.000Z	TomyLobo		how do i check when a package was last updated and from which version to which?
2012-10-31T13:04:00.000Z	L3top	TomyLobo	I am not sure that there is an easy way to gather that info...
2012-10-31T13:11:00.000Z	L3top	TomyLobo	might look for details in /var/lib/dpkg/status and status.old too... will require some clever grepping
