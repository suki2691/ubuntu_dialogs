2007-03-04T09:46:00.000Z	ubuntu_no_worky		anyone know how to automatically install and mount extra sata hardrives?
2007-03-04T09:47:00.000Z	eck	ubuntu_no_worky	gnome should do that
2007-03-04T09:47:00.000Z	eck	ubuntu_no_worky	can you do it manually?
2007-03-04T09:48:00.000Z	eck	ubuntu_no_worky	check that the kernel can see the device (with dmesg) and then use the mount command
