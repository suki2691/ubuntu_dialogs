2006-06-26T06:53:00.000Z	ddrj		guys, i have a laptop and a computer, the ubuntu live cd runs really well on the laptop, but on the computer it runs painfully slow, opening up the install icon on the desktop literally takes 4 minutes and 51 seconds. it's not the cd, because the cd runs really fast on the laptop. i enabled DMA with sudo hdparm -d1 /dev/cdrom on the computer, but it still runs slow. anyone had a problem with live cd running this slow?
