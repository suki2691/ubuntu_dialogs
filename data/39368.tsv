2011-10-14T21:16:00.000Z	taisa		hi there, does anybody know how to install bibus in ubuntu 11.10? Python dependencies are not met, because of following error: bibus: Depends: python (>= 2.7.1-0ubuntu2) but 2.7.2-7ubuntu2 is installed.
2011-10-14T21:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	taisa	is there a bug reported?
2011-10-14T21:17:00.000Z	taisa	ActionParsnip	yes, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bibus/+bug/849174
2011-10-14T21:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	taisa	then when the bug is closed, it will be installable
