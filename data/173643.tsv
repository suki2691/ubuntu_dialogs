2010-05-14T03:48:00.000Z	davidov009		Hey. I am having trouble installing Ubuntu 10.04 on a Windows 7 operating system. I have downloaded the i384 or w/e for intel processors. I installed the ISO to a disk, and every time I try run it, it tries to download the AMD64 iso file. I know my cpu is Intel core 2 duo T8300, so why is it trying to download amd file?
