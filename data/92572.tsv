2008-05-02T17:33:00.000Z	Slart		I had some problems on my laptop with using sudo after upgrading to hardy.. something about not being able to resolv the hostname.. I never got around to fixing that..
2008-05-02T17:34:00.000Z	Slart		isn't envyng now included in hardy?
2008-05-02T17:34:00.000Z	Wobe	Slart	it's in the repo's but not installed by default
2008-05-02T17:35:00.000Z	Slart	Wobe	ah.. well.. at least that makes it a little bit accepted =)
