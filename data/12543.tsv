2011-11-01T07:28:00.000Z	osubuck_		hmm, guess i'll install virtualbox and put it in VM and test it myself
2011-11-01T07:30:00.000Z	osubuck_		just curious to try it, ubuntu has still seemed to keep its popularity, whether it be marketing or just a good product
2011-11-01T07:31:00.000Z	zykotick9	osubuck_	i doubt unity/gnome3 is going to work "very" well in VBox - it'll work (assuming 3d support) but not well
