2009-07-29T11:10:00.000Z	andrewubuntu		hi guys, how do i a do a fix for my notebook : Ubuntu 9.04 has the same sound problem as 8.10 and it can be fixed by creating a new file /etc/modprobe.d/options.conf containing the line " options snd-hda-intel model=mobile "
2009-07-29T11:10:00.000Z	andrewubuntu		can anyone help me walk through this? I've just reinstalled ubuntu on my notebook

2009-07-29T11:12:00.000Z	andrewubuntu	Wiseman	thank you, but the sound is the only thing that is not working for my notebook, i think i'll stick it out with ubuntu ;-) can anyone help me walk through the steps for the fix?
