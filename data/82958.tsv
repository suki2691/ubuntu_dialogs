2010-01-18T19:39:00.000Z	ubuntu		I'm trying to scp from one live-cd ubuntu to another, but I don't know the password. Help?
2010-01-18T19:40:00.000Z	ubuntu		It's a live-cd
2010-01-18T19:40:00.000Z	ubuntu		Doesn't it have a default password or something?
2010-01-18T19:40:00.000Z	screen-x	ubuntu	why don't you set the password to something you know?
