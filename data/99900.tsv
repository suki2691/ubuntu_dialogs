2008-04-23T21:19:00.000Z	mikefizz		alright, I have a dell laptop with 3 partitions, the main one with xp on it, a dell restore partition, and a dell utility partition. Since i can only hvae 4 partitions max and also want to dual boot with ubuntu, is it safe to delete the dell restore and dell utility partitions
