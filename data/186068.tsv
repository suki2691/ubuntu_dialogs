2006-06-14T11:38:00.000Z	Snellgrove	Drake_	searching the forums helped me a lot today :) I learnt a few commands, like i"p route" and "ip addr" which are good at telling you if you even have an IP Address!
2006-06-14T11:39:00.000Z	Snellgrove		Yeah, Dewbie if you do sudo apt-get install tft-screen-cleaner   lol ;)
