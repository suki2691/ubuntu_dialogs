2007-05-17T09:10:00.000Z	Felarin	networkparadox	That happens at my gf's place. I put Feisty in but DHCP just dosen't work. I suppose it's NM too. I use static there, with the DHCP lease binded to her MAC add.

2007-05-17T09:10:00.000Z	Felarin	networkparadox	DHCP works fine for me at home though, it's able to obtain from my buffalo. The router at my gf's place is a belkin.
