2010-09-17T18:37:00.000Z	b0ot	FernandoBasso	Is there a way to attach something to a process when you call it... I have multiple instances of vlc going and when I call one I want to either know that specific process id so i can kill it later, or attach some sort of handle to it so I can kill it later
