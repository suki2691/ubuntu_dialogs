2009-11-25T15:50:00.000Z	iKernel		I just compiled and installed (I made sure to do a make uninstall first to get rid of previous pulseaudio stuff), I start pulseaudio, but when I try to open System->Prefrences->Sound it just sits on "Waiting for sound server to respond" with a cancel button. I haven't ran pulseaudio with any arguments. I've tried running as root and as kernel. I haven't tried rebooting. One evil looking thing I saw when running pulseaudio was:
2009-11-25T15:50:00.000Z	iKernel		 E: module.c: Failed to load  module "module-alsa-sink" (argument: "device_id=0"): initialization failed. What do I need to do to make pulseaudio work?
