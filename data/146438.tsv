2012-07-12T00:43:00.000Z	theguy		hi there, i need to access the grub menu on my 8.04 hardy server, but pressing esc when prompted during boot does nothing, what am i doing wrong?
2012-07-12T00:43:00.000Z	theguy		should i hold esc down, press is once, or tap it repeatedly
2012-07-12T00:44:00.000Z	BluesKaj	theguy	hold the left shift key down after the bios scrn , until grub appears
2012-07-12T00:45:00.000Z	theguy	BluesKaj	I'm running 8.04 which uses grub, not grub2, the key is esc not shift, I've already tried shift too
