2009-07-16T08:43:00.000Z	Pluxii		just curious, did anyone else have the problem of deleting the partition that ubuntu is on and then having a grub error when you try to boot causing you not to be able to load your other os?
2009-07-16T08:44:00.000Z	DrLame	Pluxii	yes, just now I had that problem, had to reinstall ubuntu
2009-07-16T08:45:00.000Z	Pluxii	DrLame	same here, i just noticed it when i did that to make a bigger part. for ubuntu, kinda caught me off guard
2009-07-16T08:46:00.000Z	DrLame	Pluxii	all I did was load the windows restore partition with the grub (on accident), exited right away, and found out my ubuntu partition was formatted somehow...
