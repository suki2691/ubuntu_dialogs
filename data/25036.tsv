2010-10-01T07:03:00.000Z	jjgalvez__	dlorag	nope, I've been trying to figure out what he has been doing to try to install this driver
2010-10-01T07:05:00.000Z	dlorag	jjgalvez__	I know it sounds quite amazing hopefully he will write a post on his epic journey and all but seriously if we just new what wireless card he was using its probably already there in the system somewhere
