2008-10-19T19:28:00.000Z	LinuS		Hello, a windows vista (ntfs formatted) os failed on a friend's laptop, i'm trying to recover his data. I've tried running BartPE but couldn't get to see the hd partitions, i tried running Knoppix but altought i could see hd partitions i wasn't able (due to my noobishness probably) to mount the lan interface or to write to the usb drive (ntfs formatted aswell, with some data i can't delete so i can't reformat it in FAT) i wanted to backu
