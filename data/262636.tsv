2008-12-16T06:36:00.000Z	bobbyd	MrCollins	what is your problem exactly? are you doing it accidentally?
2008-12-16T06:37:00.000Z	bobbyd	MrCollins	did you just reduce the number of desktops to 1 in the desktop switcher in the bottom right?
2008-12-16T06:37:00.000Z	bobbyd	MrCollins	try right-clicking it and setting it to >1
