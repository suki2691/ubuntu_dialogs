2011-05-05T23:24:00.000Z	filosofixit		Is there anyone who knows how to revert from the nvidia OSS driver to the Nvidia binary driver through SSH? A friend of mine uninstalled the Nvidia binary driver but got a black screen after restart, but I am able to SSH in to his box..
2011-05-05T23:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	filosofixit	 you mean install the nvidia-current package to reinstall the nvidia driver?  :)
2011-05-05T23:35:00.000Z	filosofixit	Dr_Willis	: I've tried that, does not work
2011-05-05T23:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	filosofixit	 Hmm. thats all ive ever had to install on my problem machines.
