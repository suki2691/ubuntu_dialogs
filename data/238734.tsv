Other programs then connect to ESD, which multiplexes the sources.  Some programs don't know about ESD and try to talk to the sound card directly, hence they don't play sound (because ESD is already using the sound card).

2005-05-03T07:01:00.000Z	trentbuck	Amaranth	I stand corrected.  My $18 cards dont :-)
