2008-11-07T19:35:00.000Z	russell__		I have a big question: If I completely wipe my notebook hard drive -thereby totally removing vista. will ubuntu be able to use the hardware in my notebook?
2008-11-07T19:35:00.000Z	LjL	russell__	uh... not anymore than if you had vista installed - what makes you think otherwise?
2008-11-07T19:36:00.000Z	russell__	LjL	I don't understand your response
