2007-10-19T23:44:00.000Z	crazy6		so it is possible to get the quake 3 demo install? I get all sort of odd errors about unknown mime-types
2007-10-19T23:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	crazy6	 you downloaded it, then ran it?   or what are you trying to do exactly with it?
2007-10-19T23:45:00.000Z	crazy6	Dr_willis	install it... but it fails to do so in both X and console
2007-10-19T23:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	crazy6	 its insgtaller might be a bit old also. You may want to check the forums/ubuntu games forum. Its possible you are just doing somthing basic wrong.
