2012-06-24T21:01:00.000Z	BetaArk		Hi! I'm trying to get the ubuntu overlay-scrollbars on Archlinux... is this the right channel to ask?
2012-06-24T21:01:00.000Z	IdleOne	BetaArk	no, #arch perhaps
2012-06-24T21:02:00.000Z	BetaArk	IdleOne	I need to ask how they patch gtk3....
2012-06-24T21:02:00.000Z	IdleOne	BetaArk	maybe #ubuntu-devel
