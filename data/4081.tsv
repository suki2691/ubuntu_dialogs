2012-04-09T23:50:00.000Z	pentagonpie	puneetgoyal	you want a Time machine back up like in Mac OS?
2012-04-09T23:51:00.000Z	puneetgoyal	pentagonpie	I dont know about the time machine backup, I used the back in time software for backup, but now I can't get it working, so I guess I have to install it all again and I need the installed files back...so can I use that backup again?
