2012-01-03T09:18:00.000Z	xrandr		Hi, I am running ubuntu 11.10 and samba. I'm trying to access a share on my ubuntu box that i created with the file manager (nautilus) from a windows 7 box and cannot. I can see the share but when i double click it to open the folder windows says it can't find the share.
2012-01-03T09:19:00.000Z	xrandr		any ideas on how i can fix this?
2012-01-03T09:21:00.000Z	Bunie	xrandr	Ive never shared on ubuntu. have you tried going to "//PCNAME" on windows?
2012-01-03T09:21:00.000Z	xrandr	Bunie	yes, and it shows the share, but when i double click the share it says it can't find it
