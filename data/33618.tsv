2010-07-16T23:07:00.000Z	kbinghii		I have a question regarding mounting a droid in Ubuntu 10.04
2010-07-16T23:08:00.000Z	kbinghii		It originally was working, however, when I connected to the internet, it is now telling me it is not authorized and I can't seem to find the solution
2010-07-16T23:09:00.000Z	helo_	kbinghii	sounds like a question for #android
2010-07-16T23:10:00.000Z	helo_	kbinghii	so ubuntu is telling you you aren't authorized?
