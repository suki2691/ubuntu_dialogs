2009-06-20T09:30:00.000Z	linuxguymarshall		How can I execute a file with a '(' in it? A file like "foo (bar).bin"
2009-06-20T09:30:00.000Z	diffra	linuxguymarshall	preface the special character with a backslash, '\'
2009-06-20T09:31:00.000Z	linuxguymarshall	diffra	I shall try that now
2009-06-20T09:32:00.000Z	linuxguymarshall	diffra	I still get the error. I ran ' wine /media/scraft/Installer\ \(Windows).exe '
