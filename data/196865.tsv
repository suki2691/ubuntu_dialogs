2008-06-27T00:16:00.000Z	z1pp3r	AcBush	means that you are trying to manually install the drivers. Not needed anymore
2008-06-27T00:17:00.000Z	z1pp3r	AcBush	you should use the drivers from the repos instead, unless you experience problems
2008-06-27T00:18:00.000Z	z1pp3r	AcBush	wierd, the default 'nv' driver detected my monitors resolution fine but meh, guess you cant always be that lucky =). In any case, if you just installed, you should get a popup or an icon near the clock, about using restricted drivers
