2010-03-26T07:59:00.000Z	nathanbdot		Okay so I have linux server installed and it's running a VERY LONG download via apt-get.  Is there a way I can run some other commands while I wait for this?

2010-03-26T08:04:00.000Z	nathanbdot	greezmunkey	would you mind detailing exactly what each of your suggestions would do? I don't want to try something that I don't know what it does
