2011-03-10T09:09:00.000Z	bc81		hi.  can someone please explain to me what in the world this VLC developer is talking about when he says, "Kill the Ubuntu Volume Control"?  thread here: http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=86524&p=291875
2011-03-10T09:09:00.000Z	Improv	bc81	I would guess "killall gnome-volume-control" ?
2011-03-10T09:10:00.000Z	bc81	Improv	gnome-volume-control: no process found   (do you have this process running by default?)
2011-03-10T09:10:00.000Z	Improv	bc81	Ahh, not sure then
