2010-10-11T05:40:00.000Z	kellnola		anyone done an in place dist-upgrade to 10.10 in here? How'd it go?
2010-10-11T05:40:00.000Z	amagee	kellnola	mostly worked, unless you have an nvidia card and multiple monitors, in which case, don't even think about it.
2010-10-11T05:41:00.000Z	kellnola	amagee	well, yeah nvidia, but I don't generally upgrade until about a month has passed
2010-10-11T05:42:00.000Z	amagee	kellnola	yeah, sensible policy.
