2006-12-02T17:09:00.000Z	woro2006		hi, if my broadcast address is 192.168.1.255, and my router's broadcast address is 255.255.255.255. How can I change it to match my router's?
2006-12-02T17:10:00.000Z	graft	woro2006	shouldn't your broadcast be restricted to your subnet?
2006-12-02T17:10:00.000Z	woro2006	graft	the router is set to broadcast in 255.255.255.255
2006-12-02T17:11:00.000Z	graft	woro2006	that's almost certainly wrong...
