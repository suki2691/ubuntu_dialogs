2010-10-09T06:23:00.000Z	foul_owl		I'm trying to send an encrypted file to a mac user, i'm using ubuntu of course. what would you use?
2010-10-09T06:23:00.000Z	blakkheim	foul_owl	gnupg or truecrypt
2010-10-09T06:23:00.000Z	blakkheim	foul_owl	gpg and truecrypt both have mac versions
2010-10-09T06:24:00.000Z	blakkheim	foul_owl	but sending your key/password in cleartext.. kind of defeats the purpose
