2012-06-19T04:48:00.000Z	ianliu		My Ubuntu mic volume keeps raising! Why is this happening? When it reaches 40% or higher, there are serious noise glitches, so I have to pull it down to 25~30%
2012-06-19T04:48:00.000Z	ianliu		but after a while it raises again
2012-06-19T04:49:00.000Z	iiulian	ianliu	I experienced the same problem in 11.10 but it got fixed when I upgraded to 12.04
2012-06-19T04:50:00.000Z	ianliu	iiulian	I'm having the opposite case :(
