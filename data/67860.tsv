2009-03-23T03:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mustangg	yes I read about that, but  I think that's  nearly fixed now
2009-03-23T03:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mustangg	find out more about Ext4  and Jaunty in  #ubuntu+1   ,because to much of that here, would be off topic
2009-03-23T03:42:00.000Z	mustangg	sebsebseb	think I will :)
