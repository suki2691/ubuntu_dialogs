2008-03-30T06:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	CrimsoniteX	use an IRC client..lol
2008-03-30T06:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	CrimsoniteX	you'll find most use either Xchat or irssi.. but Irssi probably isn't fo a newb
2008-03-30T06:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	CrimsoniteX	never personally used lostirc, so i'll just suggest xchat
