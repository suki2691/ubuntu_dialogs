2006-09-28T12:55:00.000Z	whurley		reacc: they're actually great at support, there was no need to yell and they're trying to help but I'm caught in the middle and it's only Ubuntu Dapper that seems to have the issue
2006-09-28T12:55:00.000Z	eracc	whurley	I was joking, actually. I know PC has good support. :-)
2006-09-28T12:56:00.000Z	whurley	eracc	sorry this is the first time I've used them and they gave us the boxes lol, so I have little experience with them
