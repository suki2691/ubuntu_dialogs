2010-10-21T16:07:00.000Z	DoubleDrat		Hello - I had an Ubuntu 10.4 update crash earlier today and now my Ubuntu won't load - it just repeatedly displays the nvidia splash screen - can anyone help me repair it?
2010-10-21T16:07:00.000Z	lahwran	DoubleDrat	are you using the proprietary nvidia drivers?
2010-10-21T16:10:00.000Z	lahwran	DoubleDrat	why can't you access your filesystem?
2010-10-21T16:10:00.000Z	lahwran	DoubleDrat	do you know?
