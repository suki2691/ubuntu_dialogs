2007-04-18T09:55:00.000Z	kILLu		im new to ubuntu, whats the difference between the multiverse and universe in synaptic and why is there no vlc media player
2007-04-18T09:55:00.000Z	eck	kILLu	multiverse is nonfree software
2007-04-18T09:57:00.000Z	eck	kILLu	i think vlc has some binary wrapper layer around the windows drivers so it is not "free", which is why it is only in multiverse
