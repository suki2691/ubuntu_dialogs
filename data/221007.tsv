2005-09-29T14:15:00.000Z	BaconTastesGood		I'mm running 5.1a and Network Properties doesn't show up.  I click System | Adminisrtation | Network, it idles for a bit...then nothing happens.  No dialog or anything.
2005-09-29T14:16:00.000Z	BaconTastesGood		Any idea what might be causing that?
2005-09-29T14:16:00.000Z	BaconTastesGood		also, I don't recall setting up a root user...is that an Ubuntu thing?
