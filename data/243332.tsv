2008-01-27T13:27:00.000Z	voltagex	Jewsus	at the moment all I can point you to is man irssi, there's a config somewhere that allows you to make it automatically enter commands on connect
2008-01-27T13:28:00.000Z	voltagex	Jewsus	sorry, you're using xchat :P I just installed irssi :D
2008-01-27T13:28:00.000Z	voltagex	Jewsus	I'm going to have to be mean and suggest google.
