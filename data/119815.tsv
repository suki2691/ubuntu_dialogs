2012-03-13T05:27:00.000Z	haux		For some reason this server isn't letting me speak in #httpd. I was wondering if anyone could help me configure Apache in Ubuntu. I have set ServerName to my ip address. Is there anything else I really need to do? In any case, it's not working. When *I* go to my ip address, it brings up my DSL modem configuration. And obviously it doesn't work for anybody else. Going to 127.0.0.1 shows the Apache test page.
