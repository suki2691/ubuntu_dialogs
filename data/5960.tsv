2012-02-04T14:18:00.000Z	ryankey		Maybe that helps?

2012-02-04T14:22:00.000Z	ntr0py	ryankey	Thanks, i also tried --enable-system-cairo, but unfortunately FF seems to be the only app which would not respect the gnome systemwide settings for font smoothing, so its unusable for me atm and i am forced to use chrome...
