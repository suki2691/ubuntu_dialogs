2010-06-22T04:45:00.000Z	daniel__		hello, I would like to know if there is any app out there for a master computer to control other computers in a network for a cybercafe. The main computer will use ubuntu, and the rest will use windows. Any suggestions?

2010-06-22T04:47:00.000Z	daniel__	Cynthia	ok, what if I install ubuntu on all computers? how can I get control over the network. Lets say, enable/disable a computer, restart, block, etc???
