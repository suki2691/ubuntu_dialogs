2006-10-27T08:28:00.000Z	factorx		Hi. Does Ubuntu work with my Apple wireless keyboard out-of-the-box?
2006-10-27T08:29:00.000Z	sproingie	factorx	the regular keys should work.  not sure about the apple keys
2006-10-27T08:30:00.000Z	sproingie	factorx	i suspect that since ppc is supported, that the apple keyboard will just work.  try the livecd tho
2006-10-27T08:30:00.000Z	factorx	sproingie	it's a bluetooth keyboard, that's the point.
