2007-01-14T09:50:00.000Z	Amadeo		I don't know what I'm doing wrong...no matter what I do, I can't get the right refresh rates to show up for my monitor...I've tried editing the xorg.conf as well as dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg...
2007-01-14T09:51:00.000Z	SilentDis	Amadeo	did you try dropping them directly into your xorg.conf file?
2007-01-14T09:52:00.000Z	Amadeo	SilentDis	Yes, under the monitor section I changed the horizontal/vertical numbers
2007-01-14T09:52:00.000Z	SilentDis	Amadeo	and what happens?  error message?
