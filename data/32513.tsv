2010-05-05T02:35:00.000Z	loquitus1		Is there a way for me to tile the windows on my Ubuntu gnome desktop?
2010-05-05T02:35:00.000Z	uncmar	loquitus1	yes.
2010-05-05T02:36:00.000Z	uncmar	loquitus1	but I don't recall how to do that.  Something simple like setting an environment variable such as TITLE I think.
