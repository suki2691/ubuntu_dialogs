2009-10-01T18:02:00.000Z	grouse		Hey guys, having trouble changing permissions for a load of files (from cli). I ran the command chmod -R 775, but this doesn't seem to have propogated to all my files (I do own all of them)
2009-10-01T18:02:00.000Z	grouse		have I missed something out?
2009-10-01T18:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	grouse	you need to specify the target folder
2009-10-01T18:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	grouse	do you really want 5 in the everybody group?
