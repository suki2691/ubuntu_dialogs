2006-09-20T05:29:00.000Z	jivebunny		wanted to know about nvidia drivers installation --> is it just downloading the linux drivers from nvidia site?! or do i need some more complex instructions as it's required on debian? also mp3 / dvd support.. does it come bundled? or libdvdcss gotta be installed separately?
