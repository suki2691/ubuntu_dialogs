2005-04-16T11:02:00.000Z	keats_		any ideas ?
2005-04-16T11:02:00.000Z	thor|coffeebreak	keats_	check the volumes/mute switches in alsamixer
2005-04-16T11:03:00.000Z	keats_	thor|coffeebreak	it's not that i can't hear the mp3 cause i can head other sounds linke gnome sounds, but i just can't listen to mp3s
