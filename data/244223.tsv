2005-11-03T14:09:00.000Z	mannyman		I'm getting "cp: cannot create regular file `/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XnView': No such file or directory" even though I'm logged in terminal as root
2005-11-03T14:09:00.000Z	mannyman		this is while trying to run "install"
2005-11-03T14:10:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	mannyman	does '/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults' exist?
2005-11-03T15:21:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	mannyman	install Open Office from apt-get. Use Synaptic, it's a nice, easy to use, GUI
