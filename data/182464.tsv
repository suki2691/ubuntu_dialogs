2006-07-10T15:25:00.000Z	Ries		does on ubuntu 6 server XFS comes compiled in the kernel and/or modules? I just did setup RAID1 with LVM and XFS fs... but boot did fail...
2006-07-10T15:26:00.000Z	stefg	Ries	XFS is done as a module... i guess you'll have to build a custom initrd to make it work
2006-07-10T15:27:00.000Z	Ries	stefg	Ok..... I will boot using ext3 then... no problem
2006-07-10T15:39:00.000Z	Ries	stefg	heaving my boot disk as ext3 did the trick.....
