2010-10-15T00:42:00.000Z	jahdae		hello, i have a disgustingly low resolution after installing the nvidia drivers in ubuntu.  any ideas on how to fix this? I already tried editing the xorg manually but that did not work
2010-10-15T00:42:00.000Z	tensorpudding	jahdae	try installing nvidia-xsettings
2010-10-15T00:43:00.000Z	jahdae	tensorpudding	done that. does not give me any higher resolutions
2010-10-15T00:43:00.000Z	jahdae	tensorpudding	i'm in 640x400 right now
