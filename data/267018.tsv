2010-12-19T01:03:00.000Z	Zacol		Some try Ubuntu based distro for netbook- Jolicloud? I have some questions.
2010-12-19T01:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Zacol	 Jolicloud has its own support areas. its not 'ubuntu' and personally. i found its support areas VERY VERY lacking.
2010-12-19T01:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Zacol	 theres the #jolicloud cjhannel.
2010-12-19T01:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Zacol	 you tried #jolicloud channel?
