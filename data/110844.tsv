2012-02-21T01:36:00.000Z	nikkubhai		Hi! Can anyone please explain me the difference between openssh and openvpn
2012-02-21T01:36:00.000Z	h00k	nikkubhai	ssh is secure shell host, and vpn is virtual private network
2012-02-21T01:38:00.000Z	h00k	nikkubhai	perhaps. SSH uses an application-layer protocol, and VPN is an IP layer solution
2012-02-21T01:39:00.000Z	h00k	nikkubhai	if you want to extend your entire network to those machines, you could set up a VPN connection betwe n them and you
