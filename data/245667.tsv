2008-11-26T19:54:00.000Z	notkoosh		i upgraded to 8.10 in a hurry and installed an x64 bit OS.  my computer is not x64. i suspect that this has been the reason my video has been flickering and sound cuts out.
2008-11-26T19:54:00.000Z	notkoosh		work around for switching to x32?
2008-11-26T19:54:00.000Z	cwillu	notkoosh	you must have a 64bit cpu if it works at all
2008-11-26T19:54:00.000Z	cwillu	notkoosh	open a terminal (apps | accessories | terminal) and type uname -a
