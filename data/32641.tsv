2010-07-22T23:58:00.000Z	_jesse_		hi all, my netbook completely powers off randomly (as if the cpu was overheating or something but the temp is well within reason).  It always seems to happen when I'm in the middle of typing, is there any place I can start investigating?
2010-07-22T23:58:00.000Z	_jesse_		I can't find anything in the logs either
2010-07-22T23:59:00.000Z	DasEi	_jesse_	/var/log/syslog and messages
2010-07-22T23:59:00.000Z	_jesse_	DasEi	checked both places, nothing unusual
