2009-06-22T22:53:00.000Z	dva5912		Im trying to fix someones laptop here. Its a Compaq presario 1650. When it starts it says it has no os on it. Im trying to isntall ubuntu to it. But when i boot it up with the cd in the drive it doesnt see it or something and goes back to that message. It sees the DVD rom drive because its got it listed as one in the BIOS. the bios also has the cd drive as a bot device. second below the FDD drive. the HDD is last. Any idea as to why it
