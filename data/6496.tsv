2012-01-12T19:02:00.000Z	hansi		Hello. I am trying to import cliparts from ocal in an inkscape document. After installing gnomevfs2-extra I got all cliparts listed, but the preview  results ( and importing too) i the error "could not find the file in Open Clip Art Library). I am using natty, any ideas or hints?

The preferences have an "open clip art library server name" field set to openclipart.org. I don't more details of the mechanics behind, but I think the gnome-vfs2 offers this (at least, they  are listed).
