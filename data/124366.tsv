2007-08-18T10:21:00.000Z	Brion1		greetings!  I've got a fresh Feisty install that won't acknowledge the CD-ROM on /dev/hda.   I get a "hda: no response (status = 0x80), resetting drive" in dmesg and /var/log/messages.  Any ideas?

2007-08-18T10:22:00.000Z	Brion1	bruenig	/dev/hda is where it's physically located.  /cdrom is the name of the mount point
