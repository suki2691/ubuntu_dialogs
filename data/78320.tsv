2009-11-05T02:32:00.000Z	Bert_2		Hi, I have an HFS+ partition that I want to use on both Mac OS X and Linux, now when I mount it on my ubuntu installation, it's owned by user 501, how can I make it writeable for me now without changing the priviliges for OS X (I guess some mount option might help) ??
