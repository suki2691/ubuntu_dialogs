2007-01-24T12:57:00.000Z	sycho		I'm looking to format and reinstall feisty. I have a 120 gig HD and want to partition it to keep my home directory separate. Any ideas on how much space I should give to Feisty?

2007-01-24T13:00:00.000Z	sycho	Lunar_Lamp	I'm not really sure how many packages. Maybe I'll just go with the 10 gigs to be safe. I'm still new to ubuntu and linux
2007-01-24T13:01:00.000Z	sycho	Lunar_Lamp	Would there be even a better way to partition my HD for better optimization?
