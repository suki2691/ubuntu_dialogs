2007-04-05T05:16:00.000Z	rjg_		hey guys
2007-04-05T05:16:00.000Z	rjg_		I have more questions about the merge
2007-04-05T05:16:00.000Z	rjg_		Are we going to need to change our GIT repositorys and or add one? When will we be told what repositorys we will need? Is the beryl one going to be abandoned? Finally, will Trevino's snapshots repository still work?
2007-04-05T05:18:00.000Z	finalbeta	rjg_	ehm, ask in a beryl/compiz related channel... And the merger is not happening yet.
