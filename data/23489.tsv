2011-02-03T15:56:00.000Z	minimec	anirudhr	The application would be phpmyadmin. You might have to install it.
2011-02-03T15:57:00.000Z	anirudhr	minimec	I was just told I could do "mysql --host" to connect.
2011-02-03T15:58:00.000Z	minimec	anirudhr	You can connect to your mysql host via terminal and commandline. phpMyadmin is a Web.based admin software. YOu would probably access it with www. yourhost.com/phpMyadmin or so.
