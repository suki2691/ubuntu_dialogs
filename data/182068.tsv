2006-06-05T05:42:00.000Z	cy_		i have a question, i'm a former debian unstable user but i am not satisfied with the release circle of debian, i'm looking for something more bleeding edge.... where the community is more alive and where packages are even more up to date.... is ubuntu the right thing for me ?
