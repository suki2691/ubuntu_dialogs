2012-04-29T00:03:00.000Z	geck00		Hi.  12.10 64bit fresh install.  I have an nvidia GeForce 7950GT that won't work properly with 12.10 64bit.  It works in 32bit though.  No matter if I use recommended or latest nvndia drivers.  The symptoms are lo-res colour(like 16bit) and a larger desktop than the montior allows..I checked overscan properties and it is greyed out under nvidia settings...any help appreciated

2012-04-29T00:05:00.000Z	geck00	ismarc_netbook	ok.  ill have to check the forums to see if others have this issue
