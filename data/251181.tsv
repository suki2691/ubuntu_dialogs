2010-10-18T07:52:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	jinchuuriki	there is almost never a "best".  the app that suits *you* best is the best for you.  :)
2010-10-18T07:53:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	jinchuuriki	kvirc and X-Chat (easy to use GUI apps), irssi and WeeChat (feature-packed text mode apps) are the ones I recommend you try
