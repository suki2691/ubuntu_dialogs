2008-09-26T02:22:00.000Z	snova		should i expect to have to download very large updates when intrepid comes out? i just want an idea of how big it's going to be...
2008-09-26T02:22:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	snova	a whole cd, like 600mb
2008-09-27T05:27:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	snova	its supposed to only show the latest
2008-09-27T05:28:00.000Z	snova	danbh_intrepid	i reloaded it and now it's fine... but before it wasn't showing anything from standard ubuntu repos.
