2006-03-22T11:44:00.000Z	gt24		Question about /home and alike during install.  Should I create different partitions for them during install or not (for the purposes of backups in case of needing to reinstall the OS)?
2006-03-22T11:45:00.000Z	gt24		If I do reinstall the OS, will it destroy all data in the partition that the OS is installing to?
2006-03-22T11:47:00.000Z	gt24		During install (since I never separated /home), do I tell the installer about /home or would that just cause it to reformat the /home partition?
2006-03-22T11:47:00.000Z	dansan	gt24	what do you mean by "do I tell the installer about home?"
