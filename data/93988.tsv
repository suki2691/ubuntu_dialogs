2008-07-04T09:02:00.000Z	alphabeta	bazhang	I've searched pretty intensively for grub menu.lst vista entries, as far as I can tell I've done it correctly http://pastebin.com/m25611fef
2008-07-04T09:05:00.000Z	bazhang	alphabeta	and you are still getting errors from that? is the vista located at (0,3)?
2008-07-04T09:07:00.000Z	alphabeta	bazhang	unfortunately that's the original :/ also unfortunate, I'm not getting errors but just the boot hangs at Starting up ... (which afaik is a message from grub, not vista).  Yeah vista is located at (0,3)
