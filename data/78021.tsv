2008-10-03T02:21:00.000Z	Kasle		Got a little problem here. When i'm trying to install Ubuntu Hardy Heron. it simply doesn't work. It keeps telling me something about an error with USB port 3 - 8. The install finishes, but i cant boot it. When i boot safemode it keep telling me the same errors... Any suggestions please?=)
