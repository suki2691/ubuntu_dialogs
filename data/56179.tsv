2009-05-28T05:39:00.000Z	jiho		Hi everyone. Wow plenty of people here, that's great! I have a tricky file permission issue and I hope someone here will be able to help.
2009-05-28T05:41:00.000Z	jiho		I have a machine with two hard drives. Number 1 has the system and home dirs, number 2 has data files that I want every user to be able to access. all users are in the same users group so basically I want every file written on 2 to be rw-rw-r-- (but the files on 1 to keep the current umask => rw-r--r--).
2009-05-28T05:42:00.000Z	nigtv	jiho	I had problems like that, but it was a while ago, when I was on 7.10, do you need multiple users?
2009-05-28T05:44:00.000Z	jiho	nigtv	yeah I need multiple users. this is a server we all work on
