2008-11-10T11:37:00.000Z	ag90	canthony	No there isn't
2008-11-10T11:39:00.000Z	canthony	ag90	are you aware or any timeline for this??  i have several clients that require this do to companies requiring it... as the entire corporation has switched to '07 office.  i was under the impression that OO3 would support but i can only OPEN DOCX
