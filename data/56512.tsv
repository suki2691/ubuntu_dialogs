2010-03-08T19:14:00.000Z	mattgyver	SolarisBoy	if something happens, more so related to user error, i have a file system image so i can reload it asap.
2010-03-08T19:15:00.000Z	SolarisBoy		ok so a bootable system image? what OS and hardware?
2010-03-08T19:16:00.000Z	mattgyver	SolarisBoy	doesnt necessarily have to be a bootable system image really, im okay with just a partimage or clonezilla image that i can reload
