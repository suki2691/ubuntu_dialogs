2005-05-20T06:43:00.000Z	Gabriel		Is there a way to make all icons stand on the right side instead on my Gnome 2.10 desktop?
2005-05-20T06:44:00.000Z	merkidemis	Gabriel	what do you mean?
2005-05-20T06:45:00.000Z	Gabriel	merkidemis	by default the icons stand on the left, I would like them to be on the right... I can manually move them at the moment but when a USB or a CD is plugged the icon(s) appear(s) on the left side
2005-05-20T06:46:00.000Z	Gabriel	merkidemis	maybe there is a way to change this in the gconf editor?
