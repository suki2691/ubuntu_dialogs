2007-01-28T08:47:00.000Z	cablesm102		I just compiled Audacity from source, and I'm not sure where to put the executable. Where's a good place to put it?
2007-01-28T08:48:00.000Z	cablesm102		joeblll, it didn't put it anywhere.
2007-01-28T08:48:00.000Z	kairu0	cablesm102	put everything in a folder called /usr/share/audacity, then make a link from /usr/share/audacity/audacity to /usr/bin/audacity
