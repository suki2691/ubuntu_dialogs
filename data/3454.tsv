2012-08-26T20:51:00.000Z	Hann		Hii everyone. Sorry if I'm interrupting something. I just finished installing Ubuntu the other day, but found out I screwed up my Windows partition, I think. The C:/ drive is still there with all my data, but Windows won't start. =/ I've been looking around for help, I'm not sure what to do. I think it may have to do with the fact that the C drive isn't mounted, or maybe I deleted an important partition in the whole dual booting process... 
2012-08-26T20:53:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Hann	did you remove the windows boot partition, and or use the ubuntu installer to resize windows?
