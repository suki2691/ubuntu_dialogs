2008-05-30T03:17:00.000Z	Bizzeh		hey, is there any way to use xfce4 with ubuntu and not use the default configs you get with ubuntu that make it not look like xfce?
2008-05-30T03:18:00.000Z	_zo	Bizzeh	if you install xubuntu-desktop you will have an xfce desktop
2008-05-30T03:19:00.000Z	Bizzeh	_zo	yes, with a terrible default config, rather than the config (the default xfce stuff) that i get with gentoo
2008-05-30T03:19:00.000Z	_zo	Bizzeh	just overwite your config then?
