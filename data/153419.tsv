2009-05-10T08:56:00.000Z	Chaorain		 I'm trrying to install Ubuntu 9.04 on a 1.5 TB Seagate HDD. Installs just fine but won't boot.  No error message. Help?
2009-05-10T08:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Chaorain	are you tryingt o put it on an external drive?
2009-05-10T08:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Chaorain	is it partitioning the drive properly?
2009-05-10T08:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Chaorain	so what happens when you boot up, it just goes straight to windows?
