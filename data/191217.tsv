2006-05-01T11:19:00.000Z	rabe		hello, the package manager is bothering me with an "update" of firefox to 1.0.8, i have however the 1.5.0.2 (in Breezy). How to make it STOP asking for updates for a specific app (in this case firefox)?

2006-05-01T11:20:00.000Z	Elazar	rabe	No. I've done it.
2006-05-01T11:21:00.000Z	Elazar	rabe	If you followed those instructions already, then just install the update you're being prompted to install.
