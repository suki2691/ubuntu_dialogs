2005-09-03T14:03:00.000Z	j005u		can i have some help with screen resoulutions? ubuntu set the xorg conf up fine, all the modes are what they're supposed to be, but i can't select my native res 1280x800 from gnome :s
2005-09-03T14:04:00.000Z	Blissex	j005u	there is a nice FAQ on the Ubuntu Wiki about that IIRC
2005-09-03T14:04:00.000Z	j005u	Blissex	 oh. thanks. i'll have a look
2005-09-03T14:05:00.000Z	Blissex	j005u	you will need a 1280x800 modeline, just web search for it.
