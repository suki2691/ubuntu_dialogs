2007-08-03T08:21:00.000Z	shk		does anyone know how i can update my libc6 and xserver-xorg-core?
2007-08-03T08:21:00.000Z	Drizzt321	shk	you tried apt-get upgrade?
2007-08-03T08:22:00.000Z	Drizzt321	shk	if that doesn't work, try apt-get dist-upgrade
2007-08-03T08:22:00.000Z	Drizzt321	shk	that should upgrade pretty much everything
