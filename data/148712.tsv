2008-05-02T16:52:00.000Z	case_	stib	Thunar doesn't support samba browsing
2008-05-02T16:53:00.000Z	case_	stib	there are stand alone samba browser but i can't remember the names
2008-05-02T16:53:00.000Z	case_	stib	Nautilus has this feature, but i guess that if you're using Thunar, it's to avoid Nautilus :)
