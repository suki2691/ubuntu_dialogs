2007-04-23T16:56:00.000Z	lieter		hi guys, ive posted my problem on the ubuntu forums but i get no response. When i'm downloading stuff(with klibido(usenet) or bittorrent for instance) my browsing speed goes down the drain. My opera stops responding(which also happens when i login to a SSL secured server), the same happens with firefox. I've got no idea why this is, the problem never existed on (oh god) winXP.
2007-04-23T16:56:00.000Z	lieter		I've already disabled IPv6, and i change my MTU to 1492 manually everytime(ive put it in /etc/network/interfaces, doesnt seem to work). So ive got no idea how to fix this, but its very annoying,
