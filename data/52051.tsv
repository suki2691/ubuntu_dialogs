2009-07-23T21:40:00.000Z	Frank83		So I just wanted to know if there is any way to disable IPV6 on Ubu9.04 without recompiling my kernel (I'm too much of a noob to mess with it)
2009-07-23T21:41:00.000Z	Frank83		Gonna try that.
2009-07-23T21:42:00.000Z	Inf_lappy_	Frank83	i presume there is a boot time parameter you can pass to the kernel as well with GRUB (haven't fiddled with that myself in a looong time though)
