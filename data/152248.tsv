2007-03-13T14:34:00.000Z	SilentDis	xtknight	edgy's release kernel was 2.6.17-10, latest is 2.6.17-11
2007-03-13T14:34:00.000Z	xtknight	SilentDis	ah alright.  i had thought edgy used an older one at one point (like .16)
2007-03-13T14:35:00.000Z	SilentDis	xtknight	might have before release.  I was on dapper at that point though.  I tend not to try prerelease versions myself.
