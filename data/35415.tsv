2010-03-25T20:55:00.000Z	l053R		What's the proper way to copy the contents of a loopback device (mounted iso9660) onto a partition, other than dd, since the destination partition may be of a different size/fs. 'cp' doesn't feel eight, for some reason...
2010-03-25T20:56:00.000Z	l053R		right that is...
2010-03-25T20:56:00.000Z	Mkools	l053R	are you talking to me?
2010-03-25T20:59:00.000Z	l053R	Mkools	no.
