2005-03-08T09:15:00.000Z	spliter		I think that the problem is that win98 is broken - even GRUB didn't recognize it, so it shows me winxp on boot with the reference to win98's partition
2005-03-08T09:15:00.000Z	LinuxJones	spliter	that windows 98 partition is it using fat32 ?
2005-03-08T09:18:00.000Z	LinuxJones	spliter	I don't have any windows partitions but if you paste the output of /boot/grub/menu.list file to pastebin.ca I am sure someone can help. I have to go right now otherwise I would help.
