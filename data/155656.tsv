2006-12-06T13:18:00.000Z	hou5ton_	robban_	  thanks ... just found some info  ... would I want to maybe to apt-get --purge remove packagename ... to also get the config files?
2006-12-06T13:18:00.000Z	hou5ton_	robban_	  or I see there is also apt-get autoremove packagename, that also gets the dependencies?
