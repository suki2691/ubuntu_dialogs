2006-07-31T10:05:00.000Z	James		Sorry to ask again, but does anyone have any experience with the following error "nautilus can't be used now to do an unexpected error from Bonobo when attempting to register the file manager view server"
2006-07-31T10:05:00.000Z	James		This is on a 32bit PPC imac
2006-07-31T10:06:00.000Z	jrib	James	I've seen a couple of people come in here with that error, is that on a live cd or on an actual install?
2006-07-31T10:06:00.000Z	jrib	James	check launchpad for a bug report, the others may have filed one and gotten some feedback, forums might be worth a try as well
