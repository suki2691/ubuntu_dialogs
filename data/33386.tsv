2011-01-26T03:55:00.000Z	sageb1	dominicdinada	reinstall mysql to set the default settings and services
2011-01-26T03:56:00.000Z	dominicdinada	sageb1	that isnt an option with how much data i have in there
2011-01-26T04:01:00.000Z	dominicdinada	sageb1	i have plenty it is just not an option when only 5 lines were removed and it didnt do much other than disable the upstart
