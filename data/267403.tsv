2011-04-02T03:17:00.000Z	Kayron		Hello...I have a question. Iâ€™m using cksfv on a 32bit system. It seems report size of files incorrectly...could this be related?
2011-04-02T03:17:00.000Z	Kayron		different size from ls -la output
2011-04-02T03:17:00.000Z	Kayron		to the fact that the sizes show up incorrect
2011-04-02T03:18:00.000Z	maco	Kayron	are they close but not quite? like maybe it's 1024 v. 1000?
