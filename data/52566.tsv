2009-07-15T04:50:00.000Z	woodworker		Is there anything you need to do after using usb creator to make 9.04 persistant???  I left 4.5 gb of extra space.
2009-07-15T04:51:00.000Z	moymoy	woodworker	nope, there's nothing else you need to do.. but keep in mind that the usb boot up disk will no longer work when you change system settings like user accounts
2009-07-15T04:52:00.000Z	woodworker	moymoy	 can you put that one in idiot terms..... that is kinda what I am at this point
2009-07-15T07:39:00.000Z	woodworker	moymoy	 I have changed any of that stuff
