I can't open my USB DVD drive, and I don't have any other and this has been a problem for a while. sudo chown user:user /media/? doesn't work but does on a couple of HDD's I sometimes plug in. I can't get it to work persistently though

2009-08-19T05:13:00.000Z	m1dlg	kamokow	- I don't get the icon there to edit. I can't give it permission if it's not there.
