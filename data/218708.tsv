2008-05-30T20:37:00.000Z	justdave		is there a way to stop the Gnome startup sound from playing every time I plug in USB speakers without stopping it from playing when I log in?
2008-05-30T20:37:00.000Z	justdave		I have a computer on a KVM, and there's USB sound hooked up on the KVM
2008-05-30T20:37:00.000Z	justdave		every time I switch the KVM over to the Ubuntu box the startup sound plays again
