2008-11-08T09:09:00.000Z	nickrud		yeah, gmail is ok but I like having access to procmail and the like. I'm old and set in my ways
2008-11-08T09:10:00.000Z	RHorse	nickrud	 I use gmail with procmail. Works good
2008-11-08T09:10:00.000Z	nickrud	RHorse	gmail as an imap store, so I can use the web client or any email client I want on the same data? No procmail that way
2008-11-08T09:11:00.000Z	RHorse	nickrud	 right. I'm using pop.
