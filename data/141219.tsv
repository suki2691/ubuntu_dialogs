2007-03-29T06:00:00.000Z	jubei_		hello everyone: To compile a kernel, do I need a generic kernel source package from kernel.org or do I need an Ubuntu-specific package?
2007-03-29T06:00:00.000Z	jubei_		i.e what's best?
2007-03-29T06:00:00.000Z	_bachus_	jubei_	doesn't matter.
2007-03-29T06:01:00.000Z	jubei_	_bachus_	u sure? I was thinking that mabye an ubuntu package might have specific ubuntu patches etc
