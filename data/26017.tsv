2010-09-27T05:59:00.000Z	Myke_113		Hi, I am trying to install Ubuntu, and I was able to get it to install with the nomodeset option,  now how do I get this nomodeset installed into grub?  The monitor won't turn on without that option, and I never see a grub screen appear, there is no Windows on this computer only Ubuntu
2010-09-27T06:00:00.000Z	xbonesx	Myke_113	run the live cd and install grub
2010-09-27T06:00:00.000Z	xbonesx	Myke_113	| !grub2
2010-09-27T06:01:00.000Z	Myke_113	xbonesx	How do I get it to install from the live CD when Ubuntu is already installed?
