2010-08-17T09:59:00.000Z	Ritlee		ok here's a fun one for the scripters out there, how do i delete ALL but one word from a line, when the word's position is not known? ie awk '{ print $# }' will not work because the words position that i want can change within the line
2010-08-17T10:00:00.000Z	ry0n	Ritlee	you want a document that consists of the same word over and over again with lots of space around it?
2010-08-17T10:01:00.000Z	Ritlee	ry0n	lol no i want to pull ONE word out of a line,
2010-08-17T10:03:00.000Z	Ritlee	ry0n	grep displays the whole line that has the expression, i want the "Word" that contains the expression, not to whole line
