2011-07-29T15:15:00.000Z	dusty		ok well i'm using ubuntu 11.04 and everytime I download a file it asks me what program i'd like to open it with, obviously i'm new to linux and not used to the "next next next next that you get with windows when you download a file ?
2011-07-29T15:16:00.000Z	dusty		For example I tried to run the jdk java development pack and it wont let me install it, i dont know what program to use to open it with to execute the install ?
2011-07-29T15:16:00.000Z	ThinkT510	dusty	why don't you install java from the repos?
