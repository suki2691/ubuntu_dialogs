2010-06-28T22:26:00.000Z	markitoxs	LjL	yeah maybe... its not that bad idea...
2010-06-28T22:32:00.000Z	markitoxs	LjL	actually with the $DIR approach you would loose tab completition for the file name, annoying for long kernel names :D
2010-06-28T22:33:00.000Z	LjL	markitoxs	true. i really would just cd to the thing first.
