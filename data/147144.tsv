2007-02-02T10:24:00.000Z	deltaray2		I'm wanting to setup an Ubuntu server.   Does the server install CD allow you to do LVM?  Or do I need the alternate CD for that?
2007-02-02T10:24:00.000Z	Llais	deltaray2	your server cd should handle lvm
2007-02-02T10:32:00.000Z	Llais		is ubuntu_help a bot per chance?
2007-02-02T10:42:00.000Z	deltaray2	Llais	thanks. I just wanted to know which one to download.
