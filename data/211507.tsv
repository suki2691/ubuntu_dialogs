2011-05-31T20:38:00.000Z	Dulak	bretzel	umm I have X w/compiz, a music player, a browser, and irc running, and sit at about 15% all the time.  13% means you maybe don't have a music player running...
2011-05-31T20:39:00.000Z	bretzel	Dulak	mmm normally , when idle cpu should be between 0%-2%
2011-05-31T20:40:00.000Z	Dulak	bretzel	how do you figure?  X itself is 8-10%
