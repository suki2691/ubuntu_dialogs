2011-06-05T23:12:00.000Z	heffay		my ubuntu 11.04 suddenly stopped wanting to connect to a shared directory on my network. the error messages said it failed to get the share list from the server.
2011-06-05T23:13:00.000Z	sup0	heffay	is the server you're trying to connect to running windows? you might need to disable the windows firewall
2011-06-05T23:15:00.000Z	sup0	heffay	have you tried opening the share with smb://192.xxx.xxx.xxx (ip address) in firefox and seeing if you can connect that way?
2011-06-05T23:15:00.000Z	sup0	heffay	you can also do that in natilus probably, not sure
