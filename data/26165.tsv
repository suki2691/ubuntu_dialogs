2010-10-20T06:12:00.000Z	ZeiP		I'm using Ubuntu 10.10 (just updated, the problem existed before the upgrade also), the problem is that none of the Mono software work
2010-10-20T06:12:00.000Z	ZeiP		I think it's because of this: ”E: mono-gac: subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 9”
