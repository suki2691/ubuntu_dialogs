2007-04-01T09:48:00.000Z	Keigo-kun		Why is the ubuntu wiki so useless? :( I can never find answers there, that's why I have to bother you all.. I just installed edgy and I want to upgrade to fiesty. What file do i edit, how and where is it?
2007-04-01T09:48:00.000Z	Keigo-kun		sourses.ls or something, right?
2007-04-01T09:48:00.000Z	Keigo-kun		I know, but I hear it works wonders, so I want to try it
