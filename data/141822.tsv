2007-10-01T08:58:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat		How do I adjust the font color used in my main bar in Gnome? (i.e. where it says Applications, Places, System and even the Time & Date on sys tray)?

2007-10-01T08:58:00.000Z	gregorovius		you can change the whole theme, changing just the font is more complicated
