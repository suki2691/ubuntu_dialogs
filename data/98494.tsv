2008-03-04T07:14:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	MasterRat	Try going to System --> autostarted applications.
2008-03-04T07:15:00.000Z	MasterRat	Odd-rationale	I loaded it in there, but no workie... the command is nohup <pathtoSHfile> & (or &&, I forget)
2008-03-04T07:16:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	MasterRat	I don't know then. Try the command on alt+f2 or in a terminal. See if it works there.
