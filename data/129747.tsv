2007-06-25T07:20:00.000Z	s225	andresjrm	No no luck there :( It is like a am sitting at the remote computer (which is good!) but not in this case :P
2007-06-25T07:21:00.000Z	andresjrm	s225	haha if you are in linux just do <ctrl><alt>Backspace to kill the X Server, and then login again and search google or the documentation :)
