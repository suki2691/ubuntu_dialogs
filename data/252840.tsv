2007-09-25T07:15:00.000Z	erg_		hi. i have a dynamic disk called /dev/sda .. in windows it has two drives, but fdisk -l only shows /dev/sda1, how can i mount the other drive?
2007-09-25T07:16:00.000Z	erg_		fdisk -l shows that the drive is SFS
2007-09-25T07:16:00.000Z	erg_		so when i install 3g it'll detect the 2nd partition?
2007-09-25T07:16:00.000Z	wastrel	erg_	do you see it with fdisk?
