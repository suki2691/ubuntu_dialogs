2007-02-12T08:47:00.000Z	pbureau	jamietiplady	 well ubuntu doesnt do anything to a router, do you mean your having issues connecting to it with a wifi card perhaps ?
2007-02-12T08:48:00.000Z	pbureau	jamietiplady	so whats the problem ?
2007-02-12T08:51:00.000Z	pbureau	jamietiplady	are you using gnome ?
