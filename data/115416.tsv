2007-10-23T22:57:00.000Z	dgts		how can i get my netgear wg311 wlan pci card to work in gutsy?
2007-10-23T22:58:00.000Z	riotkittie	dgts	which chipset?
2007-10-23T22:58:00.000Z	dgts	riotkittie	it's been detected as atheros i think, ifconfig lists it as ath0
2007-10-23T22:59:00.000Z	dgts	riotkittie	my access point doesn't use wep or wpa, but in the network tool in gutsy i can't configure "no encryption", it just doesn't exist
