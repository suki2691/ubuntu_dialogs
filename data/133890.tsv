2007-05-17T10:39:00.000Z	w4ett		so after crying the ati woes for awhile, I'm looking to replace my vid card with nvidia...what is the minimal needed for compiz & Beryl to be used effectively?
2007-05-17T10:39:00.000Z	deCon	w4ett	probably a geforce4 6XXX series
2007-05-17T10:40:00.000Z	deCon	w4ett	but  i believe you can get the nicer ones for fairly decent prices (8XXX series)
2007-05-17T10:41:00.000Z	w4ett	deCon	looking at a budget card....gonna upgrade the whole system in 6 months
