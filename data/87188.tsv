2008-06-21T18:05:00.000Z	Sockmonkey		Can anyone help me get internet onto ubuntu? I can't get it to work. :/
2008-06-21T18:05:00.000Z	Zanth_88	Sockmonkey	open a Terminal and type 'sudo pppoeconf'
2008-06-21T18:06:00.000Z	Sockmonkey	Zanth_88	what do I need to do after that? (It's dual booted with XP so I can't do it step by step :/)
2008-06-21T18:07:00.000Z	Zanth_88	Sockmonkey	are you on Ubuntu now, or XP?
