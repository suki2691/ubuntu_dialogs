2007-04-23T09:34:00.000Z	ramy		i just installed feity fawn, but some keyboard keys (mainly single and double quotes ' ") don't work unless I follow them with a click on spacebar !! anybody knows a solution ?
2007-04-23T09:35:00.000Z	paradroid	ramy	Have a look at gnome-keyboard-properties
2007-04-23T09:38:00.000Z	ramy	paradroid	I changed the keyboard layout, but that didn solve the problem. Do I have to logout, or restart for changes to apply ?
2007-04-23T09:40:00.000Z	paradroid	ramy	Good question. I don't really know but a restart of X is always an option. Or maybe just do a killall nautilus?
