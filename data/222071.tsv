2007-07-15T07:25:00.000Z	conorkirkpatrick		Is this good enough for Ubuntu? Pentium 3 800MHZ, 256MB ram, nVidia GeForce FX5200 (128MB)
2007-07-15T07:25:00.000Z	Stormx2	conorkirkpatrick	Yeah, fine.
2007-07-15T07:26:00.000Z	Stormx2	conorkirkpatrick	You might want to consider getting more RAM and/or running xubuntu
2007-07-15T07:39:00.000Z	Stormx2	conorkirkpatrick	The fact that you can connect? o.O
