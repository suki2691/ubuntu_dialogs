2011-01-19T06:21:00.000Z	Aginor	bird_turd	it's as useful as any other programming language, it depends on what you feel comfortable with and what you're trying to achieve
2011-01-19T06:24:00.000Z	Aginor	bird_turd	I'm going to make lots of people disagree, but I'd probably place it fairly close to python in its use cases
2011-01-19T06:26:00.000Z	Aginor	bird_turd	I'd not use an interpreted language for many of those things, but it certainly is possible
