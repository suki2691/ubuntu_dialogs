2010-07-21T19:21:00.000Z	ben72		 hi! what am I doing wrong here? I want to assign a symlink (called cdisplay) to an USB device.. http://paste.ubuntu.com/467013/
2010-07-21T19:21:00.000Z	ben72		but I get a symlink like /dev/cdisplay -> snd/pcmC0D0c (and it seems it's random what it points to)
2010-07-21T19:22:00.000Z	violinappren	ben72	what syntax is that?
2010-07-21T19:23:00.000Z	ben72	violinappren	I use it in a file under /etc/udev/rules.d
