2007-03-22T09:30:00.000Z	diyerxa		Hello. Can anyone give me advice on how to upgrade to GNOME 2.18 on Edgy?
2007-03-22T09:31:00.000Z	eV64	diyerxa	probably easiest to do it through synaptic
2007-03-22T09:33:00.000Z	diyerxa	eV64	i've been trying, even after changing repositories to feisty. just can't seem to narrow down which GNOME files I need specifically
2007-03-22T09:37:00.000Z	eV64	diyerxa	it should tell you.
