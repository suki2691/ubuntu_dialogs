2010-02-10T05:37:00.000Z	LasBuntu		where do I put an alias for root?
2010-02-10T05:38:00.000Z	LasBuntu		I want to make sure I don't do something stupid like run irc as root :)
2010-02-10T05:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LasBuntu	The easiest way to do that is to never start a root shell
2010-02-10T05:39:00.000Z	LasBuntu	Jordan_U	true, but that's a bad habit I have not yet broken :)
