2007-06-23T11:45:00.000Z	joe4444		in gnome
2007-06-23T11:46:00.000Z	MISTERTibbs	joe4444	right click on panel > properties > autohide
2007-06-23T11:47:00.000Z	joe4444	MISTERTibbs	that doesn't hide it completely... i'm talking about like the auto-hide for AWN, or simply getting rid of the panel all together
