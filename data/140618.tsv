2008-03-21T21:01:00.000Z	LjL-Temp	sz90	they can be less secure, i suppose, because any security updates don't automatically propagate to them. i wouldn't compare to debian unstable though
2008-03-21T21:03:00.000Z	LjL-Temp	sz90	backports are usually not core apps. i really can't picture ssh in backports
2008-03-21T21:05:00.000Z	LjL-Temp	sz90	they always worked fine for me... you can always consider only installing the specific application you need updated, anyway
