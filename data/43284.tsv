2011-04-24T02:53:00.000Z	Galvatron	Inkblue10`	64-bit versions of apps sometimes might be significantly faster. But because of the Flash, the 32-bit is the recommended version. Also, there are 32-bit kernels with PAE, to overcome the memory adressing limitations of 32-bit. Though, there might still be a 3GB+ limit of memory for a single process, but I'm not sure about it.
