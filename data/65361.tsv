2010-05-12T01:07:00.000Z	Glowball		When I press super-s, the logout button (that one in the upper right corner on a default installation) activates. How can I put that off? It's not in Preferences > Keyboard shortcuts

2010-05-12T01:08:00.000Z	Glowball	soreau	I want to bind it to something else... But it's something in Compiz, you say? Hmm, didn't look there yet.
2010-05-12T01:10:00.000Z	Glowball	soreau	Any clue where it is? I can't find a plugin where it would fit...
