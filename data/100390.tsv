2008-02-16T00:30:00.000Z	Diville		Hi - Im going to be a new user to Ubuntu - Does anyone know anything about WLAN card drivers?
2008-02-16T00:31:00.000Z	MasterShrak	Diville	yes i konw some, depends on the subsystem of the card more than anything
2008-02-16T00:33:00.000Z	MasterShrak	Diville	its not an Asus card, Asus is the laptop model, you need to know what kind of card is in it
2008-02-16T00:35:00.000Z	MasterShrak	Diville	you are missing the point
