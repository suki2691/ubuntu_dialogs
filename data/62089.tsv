2010-01-17T07:17:00.000Z	LordDragon		i just tried ubuntu netbook remix on this new acer aspire 250 netbook. the compatibility list said the wifi worked however it wont work and i dont see the wifi driver loaded
2010-01-17T07:17:00.000Z	LordDragon		is the straight ubuntu 9.10 have a better chance of support my netbooks drivers than this netbook remix?
2010-01-17T07:18:00.000Z	meganerd	LordDragon	9.10 has a newer kernel, the netbook release is a version or two old IIRC. I am running 9.10 vanilla on my netbook
