2005-04-15T07:25:00.000Z	Lagerstatten		Hi everyone.  Sorry to bother you but I just wanted to ask a quick "how-to" question.  I have a 12inch Powerbook G4 and I want to install Ubuntu onto it while keeping OS X, dual boot I guess is the correct term.  Can someone give me a quick walkthrough on what I need to do?  Please and Thank you
