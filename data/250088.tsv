2008-05-04T08:28:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		why does ubuntu remove many packages at 95% of the install?
2008-05-04T08:30:00.000Z	KeithWeisshar		i have the ubuntu 64-bit dvd version
2008-05-04T08:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	KeithWeisshar	 i think the cd version installs a bit quicker.
2008-05-04T08:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	KeithWeisshar	 On this system it seemed the removal took longer then the install. :)
