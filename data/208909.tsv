2005-11-03T08:23:00.000Z	Toran		hey guys, why is my [ubuntu]  machine using almost all of my 1gb of memory, and almost none of my swap?
2005-11-03T08:24:00.000Z	Toran		(at least, according to "free"
2005-11-03T08:24:00.000Z	Bonzodog	Toran	it's the way linux memory works
2005-11-03T08:25:00.000Z	Toran	Bonzodog	ah, I was wondering. My computers have always seemed to be using all of my memory up (at least, my linux ones, but those are all I run)
