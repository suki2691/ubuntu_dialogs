2008-11-03T22:07:00.000Z	photon2		Hey, after weeks of perfect Ubuntu experience, now suddenly my Ubuntu will freeze after a few minutes. First, everything freezes but the mouse, then a few secs later, the mouse freezes too. I'm on an AMD64 (8.04). What could cause this?
2008-11-03T22:07:00.000Z	ikonia	photon2	one thing to check is the numlock key
2008-11-03T22:07:00.000Z	ikonia	photon2	when it freezes hit the numlock key and see if the key lights up or not
2008-11-03T22:08:00.000Z	photon2	ikonia	okay, and what does that tell me, if it lights up?
