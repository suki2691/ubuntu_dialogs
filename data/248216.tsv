2005-07-20T07:03:00.000Z	tbite		hi. can anyone help me? i accidentally did something to the "system tray" in the top right corner of the screen, and now i cant see icons such as gaim on there any more, even though its still running if i close the contact list window cause i can hear noises coming from it.

2005-07-20T07:04:00.000Z	tbite		all ive got now in the top right is just the date/time and the volume control
