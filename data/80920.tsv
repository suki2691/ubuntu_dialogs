2008-09-02T22:49:00.000Z	Kian84_		i was encoding some tracks in mp3 from an audio cd-r... grip was having some problems, so what I did was record some songs, take the cd out and put it back to continue encoding.... at a certain point, after it finished, the pc won't eject the cd. so i tried the "clip" trick and used a clip to manually open the drive........ now ubuntu can't recognize any audio cd.......... nor it will open the drive...... what can i do?
