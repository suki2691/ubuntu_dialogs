2007-01-05T11:22:00.000Z	craigbass1976	lardarse	isn't there a fonts directory somewhere that you can just copy a downloaded font into?
2007-01-05T11:23:00.000Z	lardarse	craigbass1976	possibly, except i don't know where, and i don't know what format they need to be in
2007-01-05T11:23:00.000Z	craigbass1976	lardarse	ttf should work
