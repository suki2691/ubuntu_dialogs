2008-03-21T18:36:00.000Z	issa_		Guys I am trying to copy files from CD to PC using command line, in the shell I receive for every file an output like this : cp: reading `/media/cdrom0/Folder/File': Input/output error .. All the files are copied, but I don't understand why I recieve such error! what is that?
2008-03-21T18:36:00.000Z	Slart	issa_	are all the files reallt copied?
2008-03-21T18:37:00.000Z	Slart	issa_	then I have no idea.. but if I were you I'd check the md5 sums of the cd and the files on the hard drive.. just to be sure
