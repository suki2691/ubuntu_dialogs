2009-09-05T07:03:00.000Z	te_	istvan	Are you betting some sort of error?
2009-09-05T07:03:00.000Z	istvan	te_	crond doesn't seem to be running, the command 'crond' isn't found, and 'cron' returns an error
2009-09-05T07:11:00.000Z	te_	istvan	there are a couple of ways, depends on what the server expects / accepts.
