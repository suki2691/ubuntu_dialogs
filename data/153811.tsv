2007-05-05T05:56:00.000Z	vox754	furrykef	I think not
2007-05-05T05:57:00.000Z	furrykef	vox754	- is there an easy way to check for sure other than just trying it?
2007-05-05T05:57:00.000Z	vox754	furrykef	I think the FAQ/ common question section in the wiki says Ubuntu doesn't support dual architecture
