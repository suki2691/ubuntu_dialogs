2011-09-17T03:53:00.000Z	merryman540		I have ubuntu 8.04 and Linux Mint 10 on the same system (two separate hard drives). What will happen if I upgrade ubuntu 8.04 to say Ubuntu 10.04? How will it affect my stored personal folders, setting etc and how will it affect my dual booting? I don't want to have to reinstall my mint.
2011-09-17T03:54:00.000Z	Gredeu	merryman540	install it on a seperate home partition
2011-09-17T03:56:00.000Z	merryman540	Gredeu	- what do you mean?
2011-09-17T04:01:00.000Z	merryman540	Gredeu	- is there any place you could refer me to where I could learn how to do all that. I'm afraid partitioning in linux tends to fuddle my brain lol1
