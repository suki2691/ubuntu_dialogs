2011-04-29T20:22:00.000Z	Skei		Hey everyone. I've just upgraded to 11.04, and when I boot, my screen just stays black. I'm now under an earlier kernel which seems to work, but I got an error saying I didn't have the hardware to run Unity, and I should select something else. Any ideas ?
2011-04-29T20:22:00.000Z	somethinginteres	Skei	do you have the hardware to run it?
2011-04-29T20:23:00.000Z	Skei	somethinginteres	I assume so. i5, GTX 560, 8 GB RAM. It's a new box.
2011-04-29T20:23:00.000Z	somethinginteres	Skei	hmm you should post in  #ayanta as well
