2008-01-16T04:48:00.000Z	InGunsWeTrust		I want to open webmail with mailto: links. I have tried Better Gmail 2 and webmailcompose and both of them do the same thing: It opens gmail but it stays on "Loading..." forever

2008-01-16T04:50:00.000Z	danbhfive	InGunsWeTrust	i just installed the extension and it worked
