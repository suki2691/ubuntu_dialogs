2005-09-15T13:50:00.000Z	jdubbin		I gave up trying to install Hoary as it failed to detect my SATA hddd, noe I am installing breezy under default mode, and I get an error at installing base system
2005-09-15T13:51:00.000Z	jdubbin		The erroris something to do with failure to install kernel t kernel package 'linux-amd64-generic' Any ideas?
2005-09-15T13:52:00.000Z	reiki	jdubbin	you have an AMD processor?
