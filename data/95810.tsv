2008-04-02T14:45:00.000Z	Creationist		Could someone help me figure out why Firefox will always just stop working after a while?  It doesn't crash, but just sits on "Loading..." indefinitely.  This happens every single time I use Firefox after about a half hour or so of browsing.  It works fine again when I restart it...
