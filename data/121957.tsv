2007-09-13T09:16:00.000Z	h34v3nz		Im a new linux user, i downloaded the ubuntu.iso burned it to a disc and restarted. the disc is fine and then when it gets to the ubuntu startup screen the disc light keeps lighting but nothing happens (for hours) anybody know why?

2007-09-13T09:21:00.000Z	demolitio	h34v3nz	hmm... i'm kind of new myself, but just so I understand, this boot screen is halting when it's booting to the partition, and not when it's still booting off the disc?
2007-09-13T09:23:00.000Z	demolitio	h34v3nz	and which disc light are we talkign about: the rom or the HD?
