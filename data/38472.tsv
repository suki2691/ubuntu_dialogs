2010-01-27T02:03:00.000Z	Dreakon		Hiya!  I tried Ubuntu a week or two ago (recently switched back to Windows 7 however) and I'm curious if the UI of Ubuntu is supposed to work kind of sluggishly compared to Windows, or if my laptop just can't handle it very well.
2010-01-27T02:04:00.000Z	Dreakon		Anyone? :)
2010-01-27T02:06:00.000Z	Dreakon		Is the Ubuntu GUI designed to run a bit sluggishly compared to Windows, or is that a sign my laptop can't handle it very well?
