2010-04-19T03:35:00.000Z	polydeuces		Hey all, I'm experiencing an issue installing the Ubuntu Netbook Remix onto my Acer Aspire One (AOA150) from a bootable flash drive. I get the menu screen, and when I go to "install ubuntu" I get a blank screen for a few moments, then the ubuntu symbol for a moment, and then a black screen. Anyone have any idea what this is caused by?
