2009-03-05T22:06:00.000Z	bittyx	[Phaedrus]	Because people are actually nice and open-minded and believe that sharing knowledge leads to more knowledge?
2009-03-05T22:08:00.000Z	[Phaedrus]	bittyx	well, thats all one part of it, but what do people really get out of it. whats the value system? what do credits or good standing get folks in the real world?
2009-03-05T22:09:00.000Z	bittyx	[Phaedrus]	It's not that you *don't* make any money, but there are certainly people who work for free. Maybe those people already have good jobs and just do it for fun and self-fulfilment?
