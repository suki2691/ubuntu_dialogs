2012-09-06T16:33:00.000Z	Fpoon		Quick question(s). I have a 500GB HDD and 12GB RAM (inb4 luls), I want to have W7 Ult installed so I can still play my games, but also have ubuntu installed for general use. What partitions should I make, and what sizes should they each be?
2012-09-06T16:35:00.000Z	Fpoon		Ok, and what about the partition sizes?
2012-09-06T16:37:00.000Z	Fpoon		Is a 12GB swap actually necessary? :|
