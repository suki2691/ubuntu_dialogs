2011-04-30T20:32:00.000Z	twig111		I need help downloading 11.04. Will someone please look at this output from zsync  http://paste.ubuntu.com/601356/ and tell me what I'm doing wrong? I'm on a limited-bandwidth connection and I can't afford to download the whole image when I already have the beta. Thanks for any help.
2011-04-30T20:33:00.000Z	DosAmp	twig111	the file is named "ubuntu-11.04-desktop-i386.iso". without the "beta2".
2011-04-30T20:38:00.000Z	DosAmp	twig111	look at my answer above. drop the "beta2" part.
2011-04-30T20:41:00.000Z	twig111	DosAmp	Did you look closely at what I posted? I have the correct url. I'm using the beta2 iso for the seed file. You can see in the output that zsync marks it at 71.2% complete. I believe my syntax is correct. Please explain if I am missing something.
