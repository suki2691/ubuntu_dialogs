2009-09-21T23:24:00.000Z	jonah		I am having issues accessing an ntfs partition with partition manager/initial installer; freezes immediately after attempting to recognize partitions in live install; I can access data on and mount both partitions in jaunty live, though the moment I try to use Gparted to access them while unmounted, partitions become unmountable (through automated Gnome mounting) and gparted locks
