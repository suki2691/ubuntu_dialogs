2008-11-04T01:31:00.000Z	ShackJac1		HI all - I just upgraded to *Xubuntu*  Intrepid on an (old Thinkpad iSeries - 192MB)... the upgrade seemed to go smoothly, but when I restart it won't go into the GUI. After the progress bar goes out the screen goes blank (though the backlight is still on) and I can't drop to command line, etc.... Any suggestions?]
