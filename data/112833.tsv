2007-11-24T15:25:00.000Z	pegasos	mboman	Yes, I guess I'll go for that next if I don't find a better solution but that isn't quite what I am looking for. The optimal situation would be that it looks just like a regular folder among other but when you click it, password is asked and then you can access it normally...
2007-11-24T15:26:00.000Z	mboman	pegasos	not that I am aware of. Besides, a quick bootup from alternative media bypasses all that anyway
