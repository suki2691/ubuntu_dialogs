2008-03-24T02:06:00.000Z	gmachine_24		I know how to add an icon to the >applications>internet pull-down menu but I am trying to figure out how to link that to the program I am trying to start which is the Seamonkey browser located in /usr/local/seamonkey. I'd like to do this without checking the box that says to rum the command in a terminal box.
2008-03-24T02:06:00.000Z	gmachine_24		*run, not "rum"
2008-03-24T02:08:00.000Z	gmachine_24		panic
2008-03-24T02:09:00.000Z	El1	gmachine_24	that's what I'm already doing
