2006-01-28T09:49:00.000Z	pixelfairy	funkyHat	gaims been totally solid for me since 1.5
2006-01-28T09:50:00.000Z	funkyHat	pixelfairy	cool, I think it might be to do with very large contacts list on msn or my google talk (jabber) connection
2006-01-28T09:50:00.000Z	pixelfairy	funkyHat	i dont have msn, so it could be there, im also using googletalk jabber
