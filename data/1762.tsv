2012-08-09T00:09:00.000Z	SnapSnap		When I boot my computer, right before it gets to the login screen I get the message "The disk drive for /dev/mapper/cryptswap/ is not present or is not ready yet. Continue waiting, press S to skip mounting or press M to attempt manual recovery." No matter what I do, the computer boots normally after about five seconds.
