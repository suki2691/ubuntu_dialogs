2007-03-07T08:34:00.000Z	smoknjuan		hi all.  quick q:  does ubuntu 6.06 default to ext2 or ext3?
2007-03-07T08:34:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	smoknjuan	I believe it defaults to ext2, but I'm not 100% sure
2007-03-07T08:35:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	smoknjuan	you can find out by doing 'mount' on the drive and seeing what the partition type is
2007-03-07T08:35:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	smoknjuan	just type 'mount' into any terminal and it'll tell you
