2010-04-16T10:13:00.000Z	TyanColte		for some reason when my monitor goes off after a while, i turn it back on and my wifi is hardware blocked in "rfkill list" the only thing i can do to reset it is restart my computer, any ideas?

2010-04-16T10:14:00.000Z	TyanColte	drtomdanger	not sure, all i know is if i leave my computer alone running ubuntu 9.10 long enough it will turn off my wifi card to save power i assume and it cant' turn back on
