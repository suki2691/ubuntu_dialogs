2010-07-01T03:46:00.000Z	larsendt		Hi all. I tried to install the VLC beta a while back, and I broke something. I just installed 1.1 from the VLC ppa, but now I'm getting the error: [0x1673548] main libvlc error: No modules were found, refusing to start. Check that you properly gave a module path with --plugin-path.
2010-07-01T03:47:00.000Z	larsendt		Anyone know what modules it's referring to?
2010-07-01T03:47:00.000Z	Airgrace	larsendt	why not just uninstall vlc altogether, and reinstall the stable versions?
2010-07-01T03:48:00.000Z	larsendt	Airgrace	did that already. Didn't help.
