2011-01-15T20:17:00.000Z	amanda_		 just installed 10.10 on my gateway laptop, the install was from a burned iso I got from the ubuntu website and for a few days my wifi worked fine.  Then midway through the day yesterday, my wifi light turned off and the "enable wifi" option has been greyed out.  Any suggestons?
2011-01-15T20:18:00.000Z	andycc	amanda_	do you have some kind of wifi switch on your laptop?
2011-01-15T20:29:00.000Z	andycc	amanda_	type "lspci | grep Network" into a terminal and paste the output here
