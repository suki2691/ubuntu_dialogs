2008-11-06T19:21:00.000Z	Ohmu_		How much work is it to write a script that will connect to a website with a username/pass, wait til the page has loaded, then pull some data off it, requesting other pages and pulling data off them too?  How would I start on such a project?  Is there any repository of such scripts that I could browse to adapt one?
