2011-10-13T13:11:00.000Z	purpleyuan		Alrighty. So I've heard the whole thing about GNOME not being part of this next upgrade. If I upgrade, would I have to install the GNOME packages, etc? or will it stay on my installation since I already have it...?
2011-10-13T13:11:00.000Z	purpleyuan		If that makes any sense. I'm a bit new to this whole thing.
