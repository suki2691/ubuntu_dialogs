2011-09-22T18:04:00.000Z	swim		I'm using ubuntu 10.04 on a dell d600.  My right alt key does not work.  I've replaced the keyboard twice..

2011-09-22T18:06:00.000Z	swim	onlineamateur	no, it doesn't work there, and neither does the right ctrl key
2011-09-22T18:09:00.000Z	onlineamateur	swim	Did it work right after you installed ubuntu?
