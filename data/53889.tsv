2009-06-27T09:45:00.000Z	geppy		hi people, just installed ubuntu on my spare hard drive. Does anyone recommend a good tutorial on how to get a boot option before Windows start-up so I can select which OS to run? At present I am using bios to select the drive to boot
2009-06-27T09:47:00.000Z	geppy		Yes I have tried that, but it seems to not like the hdb entry which ubuntu is installed on (hda is win32)
2009-06-27T09:48:00.000Z	geppy		Can I do something with the windows boot.ini to be able to select which os is loaded?
