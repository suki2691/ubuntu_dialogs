2007-09-27T08:36:00.000Z	AzzClown	aaron	did you do it from apt-install?
2007-09-27T08:38:00.000Z	AzzClown	aaron	if you got it from add-remove programs, you should just be able to run beryl manager from "system tools"
2007-09-27T08:40:00.000Z	AzzClown	aaron	 or try going to "add/remove  programs"  then make sure its set to "all programs"  , then search for beryl and get it.  It will do all the crap for you
