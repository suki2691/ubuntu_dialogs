2007-11-03T22:20:00.000Z	RB2		Quick question about Bug Reporting procedures. If I report a bug through Launchpad and it turns out to be an upstream problem, should I go to the app's bug repository and file a bug or just note that it's upstream in the Launchpad ticket?
2007-11-03T22:20:00.000Z	todsah	RB2	as an upstream provider, I prefer it if people report bugs to me directly too.
2007-11-03T22:22:00.000Z	RB2	todsah	/ fyrestrtr, thanks. I'll go ahead and create a app ticket and note it in the Launchpad ticket. Sounds fair enough, right?
2007-11-03T22:22:00.000Z	todsah	RB2	uhhuh.
