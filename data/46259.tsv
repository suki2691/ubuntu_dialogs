2009-10-05T09:57:00.000Z	p1ckLe	PMantis	okay, cause i initially tried starting it up and it would load and then stop, give me a grey screen with a white window in the upper left corner, with a loading icon as my cursor, and then it would just stop loading, so im attempting to format the drive first.
2009-10-05T09:57:00.000Z	p1ckLe	PMantis	i just aquired the computer, it had windows me on it with a corrupt vxd.. so i was unable to format it through dos or anything.
