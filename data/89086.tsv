2009-04-28T19:47:00.000Z	RLa		i have big problems with apt-get, package download hangs, i hit ctrl+c, try reinstall, but half-downloaded package seems to be ignored!
2009-04-28T19:48:00.000Z	RLa		so my half-downloaded package will be broken?
2009-04-28T19:48:00.000Z	RLa		i find this quite dangerous
2009-04-28T19:50:00.000Z	glitsj16	RLa	/var/cache/apt/archives holds those
