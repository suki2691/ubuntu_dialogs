2012-08-27T22:33:00.000Z	TaJMoX	fidel	the program is WhatPulse and doesn't have an icon, it starts in the "tray"
2012-08-27T22:34:00.000Z	TaJMoX	fidel	correction, it has an icon on the dock but I don't want it to lock there, I want it to "lock" in the applications thingy so I can click the Unity Ubuntu icon and simply type "WhatPulse"
