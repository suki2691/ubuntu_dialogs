2007-08-25T16:04:00.000Z	arctic01		hello. I installed Ubuntu 7.04 on y laptop some days ago and updated the whole system. Now the harddisk partition is broken, the system is completely unable to boot. Is this a known problem or am I simply unlucky?
2007-08-25T16:05:00.000Z	arctic01		i feel that one packages of the updates has messed up my system
2007-08-25T16:05:00.000Z	deramin	arctic01	how did you determine the partition is broken?
2007-08-25T16:06:00.000Z	arctic01	deramin	because i found this out using dsl. it reported a broken partition table on two of three partitions
