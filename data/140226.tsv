2007-08-16T15:37:00.000Z	rausb0	Selenolycus	i also had this error. the X server was crashing when Terminal started. try running xterm instead.
2007-08-16T15:37:00.000Z	rausb0	Selenolycus	did you install from the live cd?
2007-08-16T15:39:00.000Z	rausb0	Selenolycus	i believe this bug was fixed in an update. so if you do "sudo apt-get update" and "sudo apt-get upgrade" the error should vanish
2007-08-16T15:50:00.000Z	Selenolycus	rausb0	Thanks. I installed both from the LiveCD, and on seeing the error, I installed via the alternate.
