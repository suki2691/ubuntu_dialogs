2010-05-06T22:16:00.000Z	digitalstimulus	onetinsoldier	are they newbie friendly?
2010-05-06T22:18:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	digitalstimulus	no. because all that is, is a windows manager. nothing more. you don't get any menu or docks, or applets ect. you have to specify in a file what starts up with the window manager. such as, an xterm/rxvt, ect.
