2010-10-19T20:08:00.000Z	kennyG		Hey, what happens if I just uninstall grub-pc from Ubuntu when I have Ubu 10.10 and Win 7 installed at same hdd?
2010-10-19T20:08:00.000Z	rohith	kennyG	 probably u wont be able to boot into both os
2010-10-19T20:10:00.000Z	kennyG	rohith	I mean win 7 boot will keep existing. The question is how to boot into Ubuntu without grub-pc app?
2010-10-19T20:11:00.000Z	rohith	kennyG	 u have to install grub into the partition u installed ubuntu and make it a chain loader in windows boot loader am not sure abt it
