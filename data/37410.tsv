2011-02-19T21:36:00.000Z	jo-erlend		I'm having some difficulties with partitioning. I cannot remove my partitions, which causes great problems with the alternate installer. How can I remove any sign of any partitions?
2011-02-19T21:38:00.000Z	jo-erlend		I've deleted the partitions using gparted, I've deleted them using fdisk. I've created a new partition table in fdisk, and I've done the same in gparted. No matter what I do, the partitions keep coming back as if I'd never deleted them.
2011-02-19T21:38:00.000Z	besogon	jo-erlend	didn't you try fdisk?
2011-02-19T21:39:00.000Z	jo-erlend	besogon	I have used both fdisk and gparted, but none of them seem to be able to remove the partitions.
