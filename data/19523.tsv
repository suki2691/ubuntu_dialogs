2011-04-11T12:52:00.000Z	pneftali		what does it mean if a directory name has '.' in the first character
2011-04-11T12:54:00.000Z	Starminn	pneftali	It means it's a "hidden directory"
2011-04-11T12:55:00.000Z	Starminn	pneftali	You know how in Windows certain directories and files are hidden? And it's a pain to unhide them? In Linux, if you want to "hide" a directory, just add a "." in front of it and to view it do View->Show Hidden Files or something
