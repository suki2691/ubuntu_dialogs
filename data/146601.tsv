2011-04-10T20:56:00.000Z	hz		guys im trying to resize  a partition using gparted: but it shows a warning yellow triangle saying the partition contains some bad sectors... it suggests to use chkdsk on windows.. i did it and this scan didnt found any problem or damaged cluster
2011-04-10T20:56:00.000Z	hz		gparted continues to say the partitions have ones
2011-04-10T20:56:00.000Z	hz		*partition has ones
2011-04-10T20:58:00.000Z	BluesKaj	hz	if it's a ntfs partition, sometimes defragging will help get rid of the warnings ..I'll probly be corrected for this suggestion , but I have to say that it worked for me.
