2009-12-24T20:33:00.000Z	Diverdude		When i try to call another skype account, it starts ringing, and then it says "Problem with audio capture"
2009-12-24T20:33:00.000Z	Diverdude		Could that be problems with the microphone?
2009-12-24T20:34:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Diverdude	some success but not total , it won't pickup the mic sounds for some reson , as soon as skype turns on , the mic turns off , prolly cuz i don't have pulseaudio install , altho i'm using the recommended static skype version.
