2007-03-17T07:18:00.000Z	peter77		I've just uninstalled the satanic theme and the old ubuntu startup splash has gone, now!
2007-03-17T07:18:00.000Z	peter77		Is there a way to get the startup splash back?
2007-03-17T07:19:00.000Z	bruenig	peter77	if you uninstall the satanic theme, it replaces the old splash
2007-03-17T07:20:00.000Z	bruenig	peter77	it should have, I looked at the postrm script in the deb and it replaces everything
