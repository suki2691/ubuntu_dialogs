2007-03-27T07:08:00.000Z	AlexSFBay		Can anyone comment on why one would go with 6.10 instead of 6.06 for an Ubuntu Web Server?
2007-03-27T07:09:00.000Z	AlexSFBay		Which server version to go with -- Ubuntu server 6.10 or 6.06? What's the difference?
2007-03-27T07:11:00.000Z	genii	AlexSFBay	I'm running 6.06 on a couple production systems but I don't think I'd switch mine to 6.10 yet
2007-03-27T07:13:00.000Z	genii	AlexSFBay	Main advantage of 6.06 is LTS. Then there were also some changes made in 6.10 which were not advantageous for me, I needed some drivers which only seemed to compile under 6.06 for instance
