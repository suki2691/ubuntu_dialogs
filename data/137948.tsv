2012-03-19T00:18:00.000Z	llutz	MadsRC	install mail-utils and a simple mta like ssmtp/msmtp/nullmailer. then send your mails using "mail" via cli
2012-06-12T20:05:00.000Z	llutz	MadsRC	set hosts default route to the firewall-vm-IP
2012-06-12T20:06:00.000Z	llutz	MadsRC	should be, just make sure networking for the VM is set to "bridged" not NAT
