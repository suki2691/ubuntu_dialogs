2011-01-15T01:05:00.000Z	Lucenut		Noob question. My "File System" in the explorer says "24 items 2.1G free"
2011-01-15T01:06:00.000Z	Lucenut		But when I did "df" in terminal it says only 50G of my 128G is used.
2011-01-15T01:06:00.000Z	Lucenut		Is there a graphical disk app that will show me what is taking up this space?
2011-01-15T01:07:00.000Z	sam-_-	Lucenut	seems like you looked up the numbers for two different file systems
