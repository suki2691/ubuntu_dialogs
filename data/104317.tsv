2008-08-08T14:29:00.000Z	heyjoe	ActionParsnip	if i follow the instructions, and run cdromupgrade off the 8.04 cd it tells me it cannot upgrade from 7.04 to 8.04
2008-08-08T14:33:00.000Z	heyjoe	ActionParsnip	will sudo update-manager --dist-upgrade work?
2008-08-08T14:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	heyjoe	i think so
