2010-04-22T22:10:00.000Z	Hajmola		having problems on my network. Can't ping my router, but I can connect through it to the internet.
2010-04-22T22:11:00.000Z	LzrdKing	Hajmola	most routers are set up to block pings (from the WAN anyway)
2010-04-22T22:12:00.000Z	Hajmola	LzrdKing	I can't connect to it. It's actually at my place of work. We have two routers of the same model. One responds to pings the other doesn't
2010-04-22T22:12:00.000Z	Hajmola	LzrdKing	I mean, I can connect and it gives me an IP address, but I can connect to it to adjust settings
