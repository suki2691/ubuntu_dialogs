2009-11-04T04:39:00.000Z	Skillen		Ok, i'm back. I had a bit of trouble, pastebinit couldn't write so I dumped it to a text file. When I booted to desktop it wouldn't mount any drives or network folder or usb. Seems to be a problem with my website as well so I've got no where to put the txt file. Can I send it through this?

2009-11-04T04:41:00.000Z	Skillen	losha	I won't I meant can I send someone the txt file?
2009-11-04T04:41:00.000Z	losha	Skillen	if someone wants it, I guess so. Pastebin would be best though. Please *don't* send it to me...
