2007-08-07T08:40:00.000Z	dzer0		hey there
2007-08-07T08:41:00.000Z	dzer0		is there any way to get alpha-blended corners on window titlebars? you'd think with XGL and compiz and stuff they'd at least be able to pull off nicely rounded corners...

2007-08-07T08:51:00.000Z	Pelo	dzer0	 you need to go and ask in #compiz
