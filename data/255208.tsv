2005-10-26T05:38:00.000Z	ryanpg		another noobish question here... I keep reading "no updates except bug fixes" now is that really really true? I mean when gaim 2.0 comes out next month it wont go into ubuntu?  Now that OO.o 2.0 is out ubuntu won't include an updated package? or did I miss something in my reading?

2005-10-26T05:47:00.000Z	kbrooks	ryanpg	its not
