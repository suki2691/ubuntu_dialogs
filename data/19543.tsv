2011-02-19T03:17:00.000Z	evident		can anybody tell me why I can't chown a symbolic link I made as root?
2011-02-19T03:18:00.000Z	evident		I have a file in one of my user's home dir and I want to symlink it to a directory in my /var/www/.../httpdocs and make it accessible from the web, so chown it to my webservers username
2011-02-19T03:18:00.000Z	Starminn	evident	Because root made it, maybe? Have you tried "sudo chown"?
