2010-01-13T11:59:00.000Z	Telek		And why the heck is openoffice installed by default in the ubuntu-desktop metapackage anyways? And does anyone know a way to keep it from being reinstalled during distribution upgrades?

2010-01-13T12:02:00.000Z	Telek	Awesome3000	Turned out it's *500* megs. ~1/4 of the 9.10 default install. Minimal now without that is ~510 megs, with an incomplete copy of gnome is 1 gig o.O
