2008-09-11T20:39:00.000Z	Cosmo-san		hey guys, is there a way to have the file save in two places, specifically in gedit?
2008-09-11T20:40:00.000Z	Cosmo-san		can I make a symbolic link for an entire folder?
2008-09-11T20:41:00.000Z	Cosmo-san		and if any file in the folder or subfolder is changed, it will update the symbolic link?
