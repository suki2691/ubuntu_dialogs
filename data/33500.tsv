2010-04-25T17:45:00.000Z	hutchit	Curly_Q	would you suggest i enable ipv6 (or... change it from the current "ignore" setting). I am thinking that my ISP doesn't use ipv6 yet.
2010-04-25T17:51:00.000Z	hutchit	Curly_Q	my 3 machines are behind a router here at home... but i have no access to the router because the ADSL company here doesn't give me login access to change settings.
