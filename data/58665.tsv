2010-08-23T23:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xiong	Unfortunatly I think there is no better answer than to look at a man page / cheat sheet for the correct options (using up arrow to edit a previously run command).
2010-08-23T23:59:00.000Z	xiong	Jordan_U	I've made much use of man pages. I like the bash memory well enough that I have dozens of Terminal windows open with several tabs each.
