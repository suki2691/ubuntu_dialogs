2009-08-08T19:26:00.000Z	devyll	edbian	will he be able to boot from my shared cdrom via nfs ?
2009-08-08T19:27:00.000Z	edbian	devyll	No.  The system would have to be up and running for NFS to work (both the server and the client).  To boot a machine with no CD-drive I suggest 1.) Unetbootin 2.)PXE-boot
