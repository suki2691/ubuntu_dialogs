2011-01-12T19:00:00.000Z	anass		but I can't install ubuntu on it
2011-01-12T19:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	anass	 you dont uinstall ubuntu to a msdos partition
2011-01-12T19:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	anass	 personally i delete paritons and leave a part of the HD unallocated.. and let ubuntu see/use/auto partiton the unallocated space.
