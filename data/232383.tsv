2010-03-14T02:08:00.000Z	jean-francois		One question, for which reason "ls < params" does'nt read the parameters from the file "params" ?
2010-03-14T02:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	jean-francois	you can not pass parameters like that
2010-03-14T02:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	jean-francois	programs read data from files not its params
