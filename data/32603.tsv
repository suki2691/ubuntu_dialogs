2010-05-12T08:40:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	Shazzam6999	can you be more specific
2010-05-12T08:41:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	Shazzam6999	you can use the PReferences to set backgrounds and colors, for one
2010-05-12T08:42:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam	Shazzam6999	You can set script to run automatically in terminals by modifying ~/.bashrc
