2011-10-13T23:15:00.000Z	kydan		hey guys, got an issue with unity/X11/gdm. Just upgraded from 11.04 to 11.10 and when I try to log into my user, I hit enter after entering my password and the screen goes blank for  minute then returns to the login screen. any ideas?

2011-10-13T23:17:00.000Z	kydan	Phr3d13	dont think so, but i imagine that my trash was quite full. Is there a x11/gdm log I could maybe get some more info from?
