2006-10-29T09:43:00.000Z	hackel_		Since upgrading to edgy, using Xv at all crashes my X server (hard) to the point where I can't even kill it or get back to a console.  My ctrl-alt-del is still able to get through to reboot the screen, but no video output.  I've got a Radeon XPRESS 200M.  Anyone heard of this issue or know a fix?

2006-10-29T09:44:00.000Z	hackel_	BetaCookies	 which driver?  This is happening with both the radeon and firegl drivers.
