2007-07-30T08:41:00.000Z	mrh		Hi everyone
2007-07-30T08:42:00.000Z	mrh		Say, I have a slight issue with the openoffice interface, would this channel be the right source to seek a solution?
2007-07-30T08:43:00.000Z	gnomefreak	mrh	what version of ubuntu?
2007-07-30T08:47:00.000Z	mrh	gnomefreak	the issue is that the text on the interface is in "olde english" or something similar, I can read it a bit, but most of it I cannot, and not being familiar with the openoffice interface and all
