2010-05-14T21:01:00.000Z	ivanrdg	airtonix	is it very difficult? any easy to follow howto?
2010-05-14T21:02:00.000Z	airtonix	ivanrdg	not if you don't know how to program in python and understand the dbus framework < but this is the only way to have things execute in response to network-manager events
