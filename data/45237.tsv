2010-07-03T06:18:00.000Z	FabParma		Please, how to create a link on desktop for "aptitude" to work as root, maybe asking for password on launch? At the moment it works only as unpreveliged task

2010-07-03T06:28:00.000Z	FabParma	maxwellian	I was wrong, I meant "synaptic" in my answer. I cant start "synaptic" via a normal link, if I do it I get "synaptic" working as unprevileged ... any idea? in more, what is the "update manager"? Do you mean the "Ubuntu software center"?
