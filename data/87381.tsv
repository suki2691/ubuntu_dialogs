2008-06-18T07:28:00.000Z	rjonesx		anyone with experiencing setting up USB bluetooth adapters?
2008-06-18T07:29:00.000Z	rjonesx		I have just plugged in my insignia ns-bthdp adapter and Im not sure if ubuntu is even recognizing that it is plugged in - no prompt or anything when plugged in.
2008-06-18T07:30:00.000Z	rjonesx		is there any way to check to see what Ubuntu sees (ie: yes there is some unknown device plugged into the USB port or yes, there is a bluetooth device plugged in, etc...) I need to determine if the issue is with the bluetooth device trying to connect, or if it is with the bluetooth adapter itself...
