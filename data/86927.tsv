2008-07-14T14:00:00.000Z	Bod	tillux1	what is OGRE_HOME?
2008-07-14T14:00:00.000Z	tillux1	Bod	well, probably the place where the libogre libs are installed... I don't really know, that's why I'm asking
2008-07-14T14:01:00.000Z	Bod	tillux1	im not sure what it is your looking for but you could use locate if you know its name -- eg --   locate OGRE_HOME          or whatever the name is
