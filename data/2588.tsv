2012-06-27T02:45:00.000Z	Nullifi3d		if i accidentally mounted a device as a user's home directory, will rebooting unmount the device and remount the original home directory?
2012-06-27T02:47:00.000Z	Nullifi3d		so rebooting appears to be necessary
2012-06-27T02:48:00.000Z	Nullifi3d		dunno
2012-06-27T02:48:00.000Z	jrdnn	Nullifi3d	umount -f /dev/whatever
