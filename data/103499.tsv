2008-01-17T21:12:00.000Z	genii	klrspz	Yes I was wondering same thing from him
2008-01-17T21:13:00.000Z	klrspz	genii	heh.. i don't think english was his first language.. he seemd to have a bunch of problems understanding what i was telling him on how to install the correct package... but even yet.. i didn't think apache 1.x was even in 7.04... i know gentoo and suse removed it a while back, almost a year ago??
