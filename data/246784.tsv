2005-06-06T08:23:00.000Z	no0tic		there's a way to read gmail into evolution via pop?
2005-06-06T08:24:00.000Z	thr1ce	no0tic	yes, read on the gmail page
2005-06-06T08:25:00.000Z	no0tic	thr1ce	yes, I activated the pop service but in evolution I can't set pop3 port, I think it searches for 110 but it isn't
