2012-08-31T01:26:00.000Z	plagman_		Does anyone know whether 12.10 is supposed to have full multi-arch support?
2012-08-31T01:26:00.000Z	zykotick9	plagman_	multiarch is a work in progress at this point
2012-08-31T01:27:00.000Z	plagman_	zykotick9	I realize that; I was asking whether there was a tentative target for full support, and if that target happened to be the next release
2012-08-31T01:30:00.000Z	zykotick9	plagman_	i'd guess it would need to be finished upstream (debian) first.  perhaps asking there would shed more light?
