2006-05-27T07:29:00.000Z	skript		should I run apt-get upgrade on my breezy system before I do dist-upgrade to dapper or can I just go with dist-upgrade ? I haven't done any upgrades to breezy ever since I installed it, so I'm wandering wether dist-upgrading straight away would be safe ?
2006-05-27T07:30:00.000Z	skript		ok ok... i get the *point* ;) thanx !
