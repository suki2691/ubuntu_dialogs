2009-08-25T18:57:00.000Z	C-S-B	Confield	just drop the plugin in the plugin directory and call the app with a few tags
2009-08-25T18:58:00.000Z	C-S-B	Confield	sorry, i might have jumped the gun there
2009-08-25T19:44:00.000Z	Confield	C-S-B	Well, this worked for me for a while, http://jeanderuelle.blogspot.com/2009/07/enable-flash-on-google-chrome-linux-dev.html  But once Flash updated it broke Google Chrome for Linux...just curious if anyone else has had this problem.
