2012-01-05T13:35:00.000Z	mucus		so i'm trying to setup a ubuntu vm.  I'm at the install setup right now.  When I enter a name for the computer it says "This name already exists on the network." what's up with that and what can I do about it?

2012-01-05T13:37:00.000Z	Chipzzz	mucus	name it what you were planning to and ignore the message... it'll be ok
2012-01-05T13:38:00.000Z	Chipzzz	mucus	no problem... happened to me recently & hasn't caused a problem when I ignored the message
