2007-12-31T07:44:00.000Z	uzerzero	cabrioleur	i am having problems using nvidia-settings to control my tv out settings. in particular, i can't save to the config file, even while running it as root.
2007-12-31T07:47:00.000Z	cabrioleur	uzerzero	run from terminal and see errors. Are you merging with existing xorg.conf or creating a new one?
