2009-06-05T05:09:00.000Z	Acorn_		It's just that at the moment, I have 2 hard drives. One with vista, and one with an old installation of XP on it. They are both almost full with data. I wanted to just delete XP and install ubuntu on the second drive
2009-06-05T05:10:00.000Z	Acorn_		what do you think is my best course of action?
2009-06-05T05:10:00.000Z	ed_debian	Acorn_	You want to delete XP but you don't want to repatition / loose data?
