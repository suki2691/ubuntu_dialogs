2008-05-03T01:20:00.000Z	Lord_Devi	ghostknife	No it doesn't. you have to restart gdm. Logout and hit ctrl-alt-backspace
2008-05-03T01:21:00.000Z	ghostknife	Lord_Devi	ok. just wondering, since it didn't look like any changes happened, but the logs showed settings being loaded
2008-05-03T01:22:00.000Z	Lord_Devi	ghostknife	to be honest i am rather surprised that the logs showed settings being loaded. I would not have expected that..
