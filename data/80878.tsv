2008-10-08T22:28:00.000Z	Elda		Quick question... what is the name of the file where my xserver settings are stored?  I need to change the resolution for a projector by hand :>
2008-10-08T22:29:00.000Z	Elda		I think it's xorg.conf but I am not quite sure
2008-10-08T22:30:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Elda	it is /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-10-08T22:33:00.000Z	outbackwifi	Elda	should normally be in the Screen section of xorg.conf
