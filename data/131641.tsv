2008-10-20T20:52:00.000Z	D7		I got a USB hard drive today, and I was wondering what the best filesystem to format it with would be, I want to use this with windows computers, and ubuntu...

2008-10-20T20:55:00.000Z	D7	cabrioleur	does ubuntu have full ntfs support?
2008-10-20T20:55:00.000Z	cabrioleur	D7	yes, linux does have full ntfs support.
