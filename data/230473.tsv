Is there a way to have ubuntu reconfigure itself for this new monitor or do I have to edit config files by hand?

2005-07-14T09:57:00.000Z	johntramp	dabaR	yes
2005-07-14T09:58:00.000Z	dabaR	johntramp	well, I used this, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg it is a little funny, cause it asks you all these things, but I enter through it except for the resolution part, youll see.
