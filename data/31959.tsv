2012-09-01T16:25:00.000Z	ngomes		hello, i've updated ubuntu server to 12.04 and i seem to lost the auto-updates  , i need to do it manually... what's the service name for this ?
2012-09-01T16:25:00.000Z	ngomes		usually when i login , it tells me how many updates i need to do
2012-09-01T16:26:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	ngomes	I don't use 'server', but would sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get upgrade, work?
2012-09-01T16:27:00.000Z	ngomes	Sidewinder1	that work , but in 11.10 it would tell me how many updates are available when i login
