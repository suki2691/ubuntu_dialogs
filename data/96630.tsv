2008-05-11T23:48:00.000Z	xomp_	Strife89	expect months of research and crying when it comes to ubuntu & wireless :P That was the case for me. What wifi adapter are you using?
2008-05-11T23:51:00.000Z	Strife89	xomp_	I learned the hard way.
2008-05-11T23:52:00.000Z	xomp_	Strife89	after about 8 months I got a new wifi card I purchased working, now it works like an old jalopy and constantly drops connection.
