2009-04-11T00:26:00.000Z	FrozenFire	mattbd	Yeah, but I'd rather use a Gnome command to do it. I'm pretty sure there's a registry of trashed files, which would not get cleared.
2009-04-11T00:27:00.000Z	mattbd	FrozenFire	Well, that's how KDE seems to handle it - you might want to have a look through the hidden files in your home directory as I don't know how Gnome handles it
