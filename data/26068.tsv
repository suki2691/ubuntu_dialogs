2010-09-16T06:17:00.000Z	Killamus		Hey, I'm running Ubuntu 10.04, and trying to remove some no-longer used applications that are taking up process time in the background. Can someone take a look through and make sure I'm not deleting anything system-breaking? http://paste.ubuntu.com/494501/
2010-09-16T06:18:00.000Z	Blue1	Killamus	why are you removing all that stuph again?
2010-09-16T06:18:00.000Z	Killamus	Blue1	Because a lot of it is using up process time (.5% adds up over 50 applications), and I'm using a small (Old RAPTOR) drive, so I'm trying to free up space.
