2008-02-11T15:40:00.000Z	Epicenter		Why can't I download 7.04 anywhere? Just 6.06.1 and 7.10? I just want the next step down from 7.10 that has Xorg 1.2; Xorg 1.3 has major problems with my Silicon Motion-based video card.
2008-02-11T15:40:00.000Z	Epicenter		Or is 7.04 ill-advised to install?
2008-02-11T15:40:00.000Z	Epicenter		6.06.1 won't install; it hangs trying to mount the root filesystem. 7.10 didn't.
