2009-02-12T22:30:00.000Z	platypus_		i'm having an issue in ubuntu i haven't come across before, dual monitors using the proprietary nvidia driver, one monitor will dim randomly and then return to normal
2009-02-12T22:32:00.000Z	platypus_		not sure if thats a question for the nvidia folks or something going on with acpid

2009-02-12T22:33:00.000Z	platypus_	Gnea	I suspected the same
