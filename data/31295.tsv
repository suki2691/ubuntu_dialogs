2010-05-25T08:13:00.000Z	spinningcompass	jimmyz80	I concur, but it might be because the user base is growing in size. With that increase, comes an increase in the breadth of hardware to which Ubuntu is exposed on a large scale.
2010-05-25T08:13:00.000Z	spinningcompass	jimmyz80	So, Ubuntu is a victim of its own success. More users = more hardware varieties = more bugs expose themselves.
2010-05-25T08:16:00.000Z	spinningcompass	jimmyz80	Although I don't know your needs, I put it to you that you're better off w/ Ubuntu (for now) because it has one of the largest user bases, is one of the most user-friendly distros, and therefore will attract loads of newbies. Newcomers are painfully adept at discovering bugs.
