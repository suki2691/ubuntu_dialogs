2005-08-23T15:08:00.000Z	firebird619		Can anyone help me with a modem issue. I downloaded the drivers for PCTel modems that support my kernel (2.6.10-5-386) and installed them. According to lsmod, all of the modules for the modem the the README file says should be there are there, however, I cannot connect to the Internet with my modem. Could someone please help me?

2005-08-23T15:11:00.000Z	firebird619	no_dammagE	I connect using System ==> Administration ==> Networking. When I tried wvdial it says No such file or directory
2005-08-23T15:12:00.000Z	no_dammagE	firebird619	the utility is missing, the drivers are there and active if lsmod reports them. Seveas, check the problem (I currently can't check on this machine - missing half of the system :)  )
