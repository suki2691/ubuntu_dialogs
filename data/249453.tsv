2011-03-27T16:46:00.000Z	yisas_2011		I am currently using ubuntu 9.10 Koala connected with a XGA video projector in twin view configuration. Most of time it works perfectly, but there is a problem when a try to play videos (with ubuntu player or VLC). I play a video and in the laptop screen i can  visualize it ok, but in the projector i get the player window but it does not show any content but a black screen. I have tried to change the resolution configuration to XG
