2007-08-12T15:11:00.000Z	kadakas		After the last ubuntu 7.04 updates my flash doesnt work. Is someone else experiencing the same problem?
2007-08-12T15:12:00.000Z	twosouls82	kadakas	had the same issues.. I downloaded the deb from trevino and it worked again
2007-08-12T15:16:00.000Z	kadakas	twosouls82	what to you mean by trevino ?
2007-08-12T15:17:00.000Z	twosouls82	kadakas	google it: "trevino feisty", Trevino has made some packages for ubuntu.. I wouldn't use them.. except for the one called flash-plugin-nonfree, to get your flash working again
