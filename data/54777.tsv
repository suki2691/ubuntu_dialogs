2009-07-07T23:01:00.000Z	rameshwor		anyone plz.. i'm little confused about compiz,, is it just a window manager or a complete desktop.. or .... ?
2009-07-07T23:02:00.000Z	rameshwor		file manager is the only thing lagging from desktop environment ??
2009-07-07T23:04:00.000Z	roachy	rameshwor	- Gnome/KDE/XFCE/Enlightment are Desktop Environments......Compiz is just a window manager that's capable of 3d effects
2009-07-07T23:05:00.000Z	rameshwor	roachy	then i can use compiz with xfce,kde,gnome.. all....... ok the what about beryl.. i heard about it too...
