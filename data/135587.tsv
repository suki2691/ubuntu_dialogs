2007-10-22T06:17:00.000Z	scot		Anyone have a solution to 7.10 breaking TrueCrypt?  "FATAL: Module truecrypt not found" error is driving me nuts
2007-10-22T06:17:00.000Z	bardyr	scot	recompile the module?
2007-10-22T06:20:00.000Z	scot	bardyr	 Not sure what you mean.. I'm using the Truecrupt .deb for 7.04, they haven't released anything newer yet
2007-10-22T06:21:00.000Z	bardyr	scot	reinstall that deb should work
