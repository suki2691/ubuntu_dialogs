2012-02-04T22:52:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	jason404	 you'll have to ask the maintainer of the ppa
2012-02-04T22:53:00.000Z	jason404	MonkeyDust	but when using backports on Debian there is a switch that you can use to install the backported version. is there no equivalent for PPAs?
2012-02-04T22:53:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	jason404	 ppa s are not supported, it depends on how the maintainer wanted and created it
