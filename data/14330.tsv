2011-10-24T18:10:00.000Z	CITguy		Issue with 10.10. System freezes before login screen. Any takers?
2011-10-24T18:11:00.000Z	CITguy		X only runs in failsafe
2011-10-24T18:12:00.000Z	danslo	CITguy	does it actually freeze? the problem I am having is that it never seems to make it to the next runlevel... so I have to hit ALT+F2, login, then run sudo service lightdm start... all is fine after that :/
