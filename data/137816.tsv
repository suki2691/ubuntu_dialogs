2009-12-12T19:17:00.000Z	iKernel		installing packages which depend on wine causes the wine package to installed. but i already have wine compiled and installed from source.
2009-12-12T19:18:00.000Z	iKernel		is there any way to make apt check if something is already installed from something other than a deb package?
2009-12-12T19:19:00.000Z	llutz	iKernel	no, thats the reason you should avoid instlling stuff from source/bins etc.
