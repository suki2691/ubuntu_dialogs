2005-07-03T10:15:00.000Z	Dr_Melectaus		Look i really am lost. sorry, but i havent really ever used nix before. Basicly, i installed ubuntu on my laptop. i have sound working, but i dont have an internet connection on it. So, im trying to get the gstreamer0.8 package for an intel p4 on a WINDOWS machine, so i can put it onto a memory stick, then onto my laptop. Can anyone help
