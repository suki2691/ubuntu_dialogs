2010-07-30T22:59:00.000Z	graffy		I changed permission from 644 to 755 on a file, and now I don't have permission to rename it
2010-07-30T23:00:00.000Z	graffy		i just changed it 777 and I still can't rename it
2010-07-30T23:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	graffy	use: sudo mv    to rename it then 777 is a really bad idea
2010-08-06T23:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	graffy	is it related to ubuntu?
