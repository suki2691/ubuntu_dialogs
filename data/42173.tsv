2011-07-13T08:36:00.000Z	BitWraith		my little brother's wubi xubuntu install broke epicly during a dist-upgrade... rather than fix it, we decided to uninstall it and start over
2011-07-13T08:37:00.000Z	BitWraith		the uninstall worked fine, but now wubi.exe is telling me "Could not download the metalink and therefor the ISO"
2011-07-13T08:37:00.000Z	BitWraith		therefore*
2011-07-13T08:38:00.000Z	Will123456	BitWraith	a workaround would be to download the iso yourself manually and putting it in the same directory as wubi.exe, then starting wubi.exe
