2007-10-24T23:22:00.000Z	liberum		I FINALLY got compiz working with my ATI card... i'm so happy :) But a problem... the system hangs for a seconds then and then, and after that it goes well again for a while. A simple task like scrolling can be a bit jerky. Ideas? Doesn't seem to be any 3D rendering problem
