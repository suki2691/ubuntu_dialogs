2007-08-10T06:31:00.000Z	burzum_		is it possible to keep mails, contacts and the calendar somehow synchron between outlook and evolution or kontakt?

2007-08-10T06:35:00.000Z	burzum_	pvh_sa|wrk	i know :( i still had the hope that theres an easy solution... i hate MS that much for their fu... closed source *.pst format...
