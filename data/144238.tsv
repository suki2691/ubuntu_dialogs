2007-03-02T07:03:00.000Z	RandomizeR		hey, i have a question: i need to copy my old linux installation over a new one on a separate HD.. what files do i need to KEEP from the new installation so it'd still boot correctly? so far i know i'll need to maintain the data in /boot/grub/menu.lst and /etc/fstab (i'm actually planning to merge the configuration from the old and new installations), what else do i need to keep? plz help!
