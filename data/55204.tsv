2011-08-02T04:16:00.000Z	ZeZu		why does apt tell me packages are held back and i need to do a dist-upgrade to get them?   I thought dist-upgrade was meant to move to the next release?   ie:  when unstable is moved to stable ...

2011-08-02T04:17:00.000Z	ZeZu	edbian	ok thanks,  I am sane though,  thats what it used to be for?
