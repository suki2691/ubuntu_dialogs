The sound gets screwed up sometimes and the only way I know to fix is to reboot. So if there is something that would reset like a reboot that ought to fix it (and with less trouble).

2007-05-17T14:40:00.000Z	sf_	Laser	still has the problem. I think I need something that completely restarts the kernel module. Anyone know how to do that?
