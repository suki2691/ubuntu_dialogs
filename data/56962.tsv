2010-03-13T06:53:00.000Z	archman_	LinuxGuy2009	do you have any idea why would browsers (FF, Opera) wait for a few seconds before even loading sites, 5secs, sometimes a little less, but still... any ideas?

2010-03-13T06:56:00.000Z	archman_	LinuxGuy2009	it was fast a few days back, but not now...i'll google.
2010-03-13T06:56:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	archman_	That was yet another issue I had with 9.10. You specify a DNS sever and its speedy then.
