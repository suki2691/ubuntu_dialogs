2006-07-08T16:53:00.000Z	dli	xaviusshadow	sounds like a hardware problem :(
2006-07-08T16:53:00.000Z	xaviusshadow	dli	With the cdrom?
2006-07-08T16:53:00.000Z	xaviusshadow	dli	Or the HD?
2006-07-08T16:53:00.000Z	dli	xaviusshadow	I saw this on both, with cd-rom, you can ignore it, as far as it works
