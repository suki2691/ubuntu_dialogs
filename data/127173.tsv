2007-08-05T14:19:00.000Z	SpiderDan		hello!  I have a hard drive in a USB 2.0 enclosure that's a little suspect.  I've used gparted to repartition and reformat the drive as ext3, but I'd like to run some sort of scandisk-type utility to verify it
2007-08-05T14:19:00.000Z	SpiderDan		fsck and e2fsck complain that the drive is not ext2
2007-08-05T14:19:00.000Z	SpiderDan		is there anything I can use?
2007-08-05T14:20:00.000Z	Micro	SpiderDan	You could install gparted to do the partitioning and formatting
