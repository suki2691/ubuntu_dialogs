2008-10-28T11:29:00.000Z	extor		Am I the only person who thinks that the iptables TARGET should actually be called ACTION?
2008-10-28T11:29:00.000Z	Frogzoo	extor	sometimes a target isn't an action
2008-10-28T11:30:00.000Z	extor	Frogzoo	but an ACTION is usually a VERB...DROPPING, ACCEPTING an REJECTING are verbs...not targets. Destinations can be targets
2008-10-28T11:32:00.000Z	Frogzoo	extor	sometimes targets are another set of rules
