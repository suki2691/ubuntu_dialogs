2011-10-22T03:13:00.000Z	Mysterytrain		how can I get ubuntu to be quiet about the new upgrade, whenever I log into it by ssh. (yeah I know I could upgrade, but I don't want to do that.)
2011-10-22T03:13:00.000Z	SunTsu	Mysterytrain	set upgrade to "never" in Software center
2011-10-22T03:14:00.000Z	Mysterytrain	SunTsu	can that be done over cli?
2011-10-22T03:15:00.000Z	SunTsu	Mysterytrain	I don't know, but you can use X Forwarding
