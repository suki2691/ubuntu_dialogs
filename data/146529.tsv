2010-09-25T19:50:00.000Z	Neo-Claw		hello :) I've found an old Acer Travelmate 530 and want to give it to my mom, so she can learn how to use the internet. But I can't get the 10.04.01 livecd to boot. Can someone help me out with this?
2010-09-25T19:52:00.000Z	Neo-Claw		ooh, I'll take a look at it :) the laptop is pretty old.. it's with 512mb ram, dvd-r and floppy drive
