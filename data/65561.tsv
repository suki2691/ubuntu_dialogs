2009-04-24T06:17:00.000Z	maccam94	Mike94287	everyone is trying to do it at once, overloading the server. try switching to a local mirror
2009-04-24T06:18:00.000Z	Mike94287	maccam94	Two questions, where can I find a local mirror, and would everything get messed up if I cancel now because I'm almost halfway done, it's just taking hours.
2009-04-24T06:19:00.000Z	maccam94	Mike94287	you would change it in the software sources app, by clicking the chosen mirror and then choosing the browse option. I'm not sure if you can cancel right now, but I think you should be able to. no packages have been changed yet...
