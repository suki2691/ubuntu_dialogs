2009-05-03T16:14:00.000Z	livingdaylight		i've set bios to usb (there were three options: usb-cdom, usb-zip, and usb-hdd or something) none allowd to boot from usb

2009-05-03T16:16:00.000Z	livingdaylight	Holymen	when i set priority there seem to be 3 usb options. Anyway, i tried them all and none of them allow system to boot from usb, which is annoying coz ihave no cdroms anymore
