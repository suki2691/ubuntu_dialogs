2012-05-23T17:56:00.000Z	Mitchell_M		Hey guys, I've tried numerous attempts, but I cannot figure out what/where to modify .desktop files to get the icons to appear on the launchpad. I keep editing the /usr/share/applications/*.desktop area, but to no avail. Any suggestions?]

2012-05-23T17:57:00.000Z	Mitchell_M		yeah, then compared but saw no difference
