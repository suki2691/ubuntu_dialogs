2006-03-31T11:37:00.000Z	Enthusiast78		Hi! Any repository gurus around? I'd like to know why backports and multiverse come disabled by default and which of them could de 'dangerous'?
2006-03-31T11:38:00.000Z	Enthusiast78		Ok, so backports is disabled because it can be dangerous... And multiverse because it contains 'nonfree' packages, perhaps?
2006-03-31T11:39:00.000Z	kbrooks	Enthusiast78	multiverse isnt offline
2006-03-31T11:39:00.000Z	kbrooks	Enthusiast78	backports isnt either
