2009-09-11T23:47:00.000Z	ubuntu		hey, im having trouble repartitioning a  harddrive with gparted. a livecd running gparted reported erroneus data, whereas a livecd running ubuntu with gparted says the right thing, a 75gb ntfs drive but says it's dirty and needs a fsck/chkdsk, which I ran and there were no errors. it wont let me resize the drive, any ideas?

2009-09-11T23:48:00.000Z	ubuntu	arand	no, I ran chkdsk from a bart-pe disk
2010-06-04T03:10:00.000Z	arand	ubuntu	no, (please ask a real question)
