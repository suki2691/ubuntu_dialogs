2012-06-21T23:22:00.000Z	cndiv		Hey #ubuntu, is there a utility that will tell me the integer value of a key combination? I'm trying to configure my trackpad to handle three-finger swiping correctly
2012-06-21T23:24:00.000Z	maplebed	cndiv	xev maybe?
2012-06-21T23:24:00.000Z	cndiv	maplebed	I'll try that
2012-06-21T23:28:00.000Z	cndiv	maplebed	apt-get install xev isn't working and I don't see it in synaptic, did it change names perhaps?
