2007-04-24T07:43:00.000Z	claviola		hi, totem won't play DVDs for me. I just get a "Totem cannot play this type of media (DVD) because you do not have the appropriate plugins to handle it." error. I have absolutely every gstreamer0.10* package under the sun installed and the relevant DVD libraries. The DVD will play if auto-inserted, but not through the menu. I can also just play the VOBs individually. Any tips?
