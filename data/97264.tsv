2008-03-31T07:01:00.000Z	brent113		Alright, so something happened to my system and now I can only log in with failsafe gnome.  Otherwise I get the same error as this guy: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=4613134&postcount=1 . Any ideas on how to find the culprit program?  Also, if I create a new user it logs in fine.
