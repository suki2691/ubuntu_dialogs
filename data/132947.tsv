2008-11-07T10:15:00.000Z	limecat	fella12	ive had fewer issues (ie, none) with ibex than any other ubuntu
2008-11-07T10:17:00.000Z	limecat	fella12	thats possibly true, but compiz is possibly cooler than mac so there
2008-11-07T10:18:00.000Z	limecat	fella12	compiz is nice, so long as you keep ahold of your config...nothin worse than spending 2 hours making it perfect and then losing it in a harddrive wipe
