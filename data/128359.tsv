2007-07-11T09:49:00.000Z	nextse7en		I've downloaded and extracted winsetools, when I nav to the dir, and type install.sh, I get a command not found error, how do I install?
2007-07-11T09:49:00.000Z	nextse7en		Thanks much.
2007-07-11T09:49:00.000Z	sn4cks	nextse7en	are you typing 'install.sh' or './install.sh'?
2007-07-11T09:50:00.000Z	sn4cks	nextse7en	try ./install.sh
