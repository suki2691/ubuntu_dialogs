2008-03-09T01:43:00.000Z	davidm_		I have a 6.06 kbuntu and need to upgrade to 7.10 via cli. Any clues?
2008-03-09T01:44:00.000Z	nickrud	davidm_	you can't go from 6.06 to 7.10 without going through 6.10 and 7.04 , you're better off doing a fresh install or waiting till april. 6.06 to 8.04 will be supported
