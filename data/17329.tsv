2011-03-05T18:40:00.000Z	Guest84073		Hello, I have been encountering one really unpleasant issue when trying to install application. The error that pops out when I write make (having in mind that I've written configure) is: "make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.".

2011-03-05T18:40:00.000Z	Guest84073		Yes, I did as I cleared out.
