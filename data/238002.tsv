2006-03-23T11:22:00.000Z	RichardP		Hi, just installed 5.10 and I seem to be missing a processor in my dual proc system.  mdesg says "WARNING: NR_CPUS limit of 1 reached. Processor ignored."
2006-03-23T11:22:00.000Z	RichardP		is this a limit in ubuntu or should i be looking elsewhere?
2006-03-23T11:22:00.000Z	RichardP		ie should i have done something else during the install process?
