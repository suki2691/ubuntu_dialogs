2009-11-09T20:41:00.000Z	wahaj		I upgraded my ubuntu to 9.10. Before I was tunneling OpenOffice.org server with cvs, now I can't do it. Could you please let me know , how to export a CVS path?

2009-11-09T20:44:00.000Z	bronze	wahaj	no. you need to find out what the CVS path variable is called and what its contenst should be and follow an example of how to set it.  check the cvs documentation
