2010-06-06T12:56:00.000Z	xtheunknown0		Oh - so you're restricted to a non-root account for all installations (just provide a password?)
2010-06-06T12:58:00.000Z	xtheunknown0		...which means...that the password I provide during installation is used for completing sudo commands *and* for logging into the first account created?
