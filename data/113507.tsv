2010-07-15T04:00:00.000Z	qwiksilver711		I am currently running a dual boot with win7 and ubuntu 10.4 on a 500g hard drive, and I have a 1TB hd i want to move ubuntu to. is it possible to remove ubuntu from this hd without doing a complete reformat of the windows partition? would it hurt anything if i just used a partition program to expand the windows partition to the full drive?\
2010-07-15T04:02:00.000Z	qwiksilver711		in theory couldn't i use something to image the windows partition, and then put that on the 1tb hd as a backup, and if something went wrong when i expanded the windows partition i should be able to just throw that image on the 500g hd right?
2010-07-15T04:04:00.000Z	qwiksilver711		any reccomendations on programs to use to image the windows partition?
