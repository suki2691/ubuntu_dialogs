2007-05-01T06:14:00.000Z	BFrank		why wasn't the text based installer of the alternative cd merged into the main installer disk and just made an option on the grub boot menu?
2007-05-01T06:16:00.000Z	BFrank		the difference is one uses the gui to do this, and the other uses textmode, I still don't understand why they had to be seperate
2007-05-01T06:17:00.000Z	BFrank		hmm, so the desktop cd doesn't use pkgs?
2007-05-01T06:17:00.000Z	poningru	BFrank	take this up in -installer
