2007-12-28T18:52:00.000Z	Wander_w	Xplicit	Probably, fat is probably slower than ntfs anyway
2007-12-28T18:55:00.000Z	Wander_w	Xplicit	Well, it won't make it any faster, but I'm not shure you'd be able to tell it's slower
2007-12-28T18:57:00.000Z	Wander_w	Xplicit	Well, you can allways try it, and if you don't like it for whatever reasons then you just change back
