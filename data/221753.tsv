2006-01-04T07:36:00.000Z	FHX		was wondering if you guys could help, the kubuntu channel is dead.
2006-01-04T07:37:00.000Z	FHX		I'm trying to install a Kubuntu theme, and it tells me I need to move a folder here: ~/.kde/share/apps/kdm/themes, but when I enter that in konsole nothing comes up and it won't let me move the folder there. Help?
