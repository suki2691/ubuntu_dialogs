2010-11-20T11:17:00.000Z	Henry_	Dr_Willis	I am trying to run half windows and ubuntu on the same hardrive... I am on the live and its ready to install..I am at the part where it says "Allocate Drive Spce" it says "allocate drive space by dragging the divider below.....but there is no divider here!!
2010-11-20T11:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Henry_	 click down there and se eif it appears. I tend to resize windows partions from within windows. so i have 'unallocated' space. and i just tell the installer to 'use unallocated space'
2010-11-20T11:18:00.000Z	Henry_	Dr_Willis	I found it
