2012-07-27T01:18:00.000Z	bwalker8981		does anyone know if upgrading ubuntu from 10.04 to 12.04 is a pretty safe process?
2012-07-27T01:18:00.000Z	ThePendulum	bwalker8981	Safe enough, but a complete reinstall is always better of course
2012-07-27T01:22:00.000Z	bwalker8981	ThePendulum	have you ever done an ubuntu upgrade and had any problems?
2012-07-27T01:25:00.000Z	ThePendulum	bwalker8981	Not so far. But then again, I usually reinstall completely.
