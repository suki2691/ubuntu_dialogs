2005-11-23T14:22:00.000Z	Madpilot	BooZee	try opening GThumb - it seems to talk to cameras quite well
2005-11-23T14:23:00.000Z	BooZee	Madpilot	hmm.. I loaded the program, but I can't seem to find where is it's camera features...
2005-11-23T14:24:00.000Z	Madpilot	BooZee	I don't own a digi camera myself, but the one time I used it, GThumb had an "Import From Camera" function in one of it's menus
