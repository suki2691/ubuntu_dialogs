2006-10-19T16:54:00.000Z	nicodarious		every time i get a new kernel update, i have to update my nvidia driver to the new kernel....  but it's so long between times that i kind of forget how to do it...

2006-10-19T16:55:00.000Z	nicodarious	rabautz	oh?  there's a nvidia-glx package, eh?  wasn'ta ware of that.  i was using the nvidia kernel.  will it have any impact on that?
