2008-04-07T16:59:00.000Z	threefcata	DJones	are you familiar with split window?
2008-04-07T17:00:00.000Z	DJones	threefcata	i've got a split window for hilights on my nick, but thats all
2008-04-07T17:04:00.000Z	DJones	threefcata	what do you want to go in the split window? I followed the guide on http://f0rked.com/articles/irssi#More_Irssi, about 3/4's of the way through there's a bit about setting up a hilight window that uses a split window, maybe that'll help you
