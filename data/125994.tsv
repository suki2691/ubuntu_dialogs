2007-08-07T06:24:00.000Z	casperzshado	Pelo	i dont know what the commands are for the programs though, how do i find that out?
2007-08-07T06:25:00.000Z	Pelo	casperzshado	 in linux, generaly,  the commands to start progs are just their names,   so ktorrent, and whatever the other one is,    no path needed,  you can try them out in the terminal first
