2008-01-10T11:24:00.000Z	console_jockey		I'm trying to figure out why I can't play back mp3's from amarok, xine, vlc or noatun, but I can with mpg321.  I am running kubuntu gutsy and I have installed gstream, kubuntu-restricted-extras and libxine1.  I've asked on #kubuntu but to no avail and thought I'd ping this channel.  Any suggestions?
2008-01-10T11:25:00.000Z	bazhang	console_jockey	as well as ubuntu-restricted-extras correct?
2008-01-10T11:29:00.000Z	bazhang	console_jockey	have you uninstalled the stuff like ubuntu-restricted-extras and then reinstalled kubuntu-restricted-extras? that would seem to be the source of your problems
2008-01-10T11:31:00.000Z	bazhang	console_jockey	come back tomorrow and well get you sorted
