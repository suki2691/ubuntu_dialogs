2006-10-24T16:27:00.000Z	hobbesmaster		i'm getting extremely poor video performance on my laptop, I'm trying to use the radeon open source driver on a thinkpad t41, (radeon 9000 mobile.... M9, R250) glxinfo output is here:http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/28016/  it seems that its using mesa3d?  is that right?
2006-10-24T16:28:00.000Z	hejsa	hobbesmaster	you con use the fglrx driver i think
2006-10-24T16:30:00.000Z	hobbesmaster	hejsa	but I want to use the free one, from what I understand it works better with power management on this laptop
2006-10-24T16:32:00.000Z	hejsa	hobbesmaster	they got a guide on ubuntuguide.org i think
