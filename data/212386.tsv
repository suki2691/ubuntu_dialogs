2005-10-30T15:09:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Suepahfly	yes, but you should upgrade it installing the new version from scratch.
2005-10-30T15:10:00.000Z	KurtKraut	Suepahfly	it avoids problems.
2005-10-30T15:11:00.000Z	Suepahfly	KurtKraut	so you are basicly telling me i have to spend another 2 days building, configing every thing after i install 5.10?
