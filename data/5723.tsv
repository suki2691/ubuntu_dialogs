2012-02-09T18:39:00.000Z	morgajel_		hey guys, can you think of any reason why 11.10 would show a single processor for an intel core 2 duo in /proc/cpuinfo?
2012-02-09T18:39:00.000Z	lmontrieux	morgajel_	are you sure it only shows one CPU? Remember the count starts at 0
2012-02-09T18:42:00.000Z	lmontrieux	morgajel_	sorry, didn't want to question your technical knowledge :)
2012-02-09T18:42:00.000Z	morgajel_	lmontrieux	no problem, been there before
