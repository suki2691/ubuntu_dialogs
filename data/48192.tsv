2010-03-22T17:12:00.000Z	jatt		hi I'm using ubuntu and my computer gets assigned an IP address with dhcp. However most other computers in my office network have names like ws-01, ws-02, etc. How do I know which name corresponds to my IP address?
2010-03-22T17:13:00.000Z	OerHeks	jatt	ask the IT guy @ your office ?
2010-03-22T17:14:00.000Z	jatt	OerHeks	he yes, maybe, but he is, err. not a nice person :). Is there a way to obtain this with a reverse lookup (i.e. IP -> name of my computer)?
