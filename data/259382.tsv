2007-05-08T16:35:00.000Z	Cnl_Delta		k bobslaede, i can see the processes with that
2007-05-08T16:36:00.000Z	Cnl_Delta		is there a way i can manually stop them, i don't see the process running in the taskbar since i closed the window
2007-05-08T16:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Cnl_Delta	stopping aptitude processes might not be a good idea - it can bork the packaging system
