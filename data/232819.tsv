2009-09-14T00:02:00.000Z	Loder333		I have ubuntu 9.04 and I tried to put my computer in hibernate mode. When i did, I either did not know how to bring it back, or it wasn't working. The screen was blank so I hard restarted my computer. When I try to boot back into linux, it says aaron-desktop login:
2009-09-14T00:02:00.000Z	Loder333		and I'm not sure what to enter but if I do enter anything, it then says Password:   ..so I tried entering my password, but it still does the same thing as if I hadn't entered anything
