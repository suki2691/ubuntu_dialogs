2008-11-01T00:39:00.000Z	_Carrie_	cowbellemoo	ok, I thought all releases of ubuntu where LTS hehe, well that answers my question then :D
2008-11-01T00:41:00.000Z	cowbellemoo	_Carrie_	nah, LTS releases are every 2 years (4 releases).  Mine was set on LTS too for some reason, even though I don't remember putting it that way
2008-11-01T00:41:00.000Z	_Carrie_	cowbellemoo	yeah me neither, must be a default thing with Hardy although I'm sure some big head in here will say "Nooo it's nawt, you are did it and don'ts remember!!!1" lol
