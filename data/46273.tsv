2009-10-04T04:08:00.000Z	oyzar	dhendrix	nope it is a production system made in C i belive
2009-10-04T04:09:00.000Z	dhendrix	oyzar	 Oh... Well, in all honesty I've never used it. From a little bit of searching it seemed like it's just a variant of the C language. So if you pick up any C programming book you should get your answer (I think it will involve getchar() or some such).
2009-10-04T04:33:00.000Z	oyzar	dhendrix	thanks for your help, but i think i figured out the problem, it was something else, I belive the system can't handle wildcards in "not" expressions...
