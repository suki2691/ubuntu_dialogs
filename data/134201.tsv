2007-08-21T07:29:00.000Z	wingot		I'm trying to use localhost:631 (cups) to add a printer. What username/password should I use, since root doesn't have a valid login in ubuntu?
2007-08-21T07:30:00.000Z	pike__	wingot	in the past ubuntu didnt have cups configured by default to allow login via 631 that was a few releases back
2007-08-21T07:30:00.000Z	wingot	pike__	Oh, I forgot there was a config under System/Administration
