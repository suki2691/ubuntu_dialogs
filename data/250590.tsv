2005-04-21T09:12:00.000Z	Dreamer3	ygnome	i'm using gnomemeeting, it works... it's her end that's causing problems... someone else with gnomemeeting can connect to me just fine
2005-04-21T09:13:00.000Z	ygnome	Dreamer3	yea, I was suggesting the other end try knoppix or gnoppix to see if it works without that windows virus involved.
