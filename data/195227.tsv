2006-06-03T06:23:00.000Z	Shaezsche		i currently have my entire HD paritioned to ntfs with windows XP installed on it. I intend to boot the liveCD ubuntu and resize my current HD parition so i have at least 30 gigs available for an ext3 ubuntu parition. Then install Ubuntu on that ext3 partition. When i reboot my computer what will happen? will it boot BOTH operating systems, or give me a choice?
