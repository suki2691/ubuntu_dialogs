2005-11-21T14:31:00.000Z	afd_		hi! I'm using freemind, a java software and its visual widgets (buttons, menubar, etc) are not very nice. I get this message at startup: /usr/share/themes/Clearlooks/gtk-2.0/gtkrc:49: Engine "clearlooks" is unsupported, ignoring           Some ideas on how I could get some nice stuff? I'm asking this because I use this program daily and it takes from the "users experience"

2005-11-21T14:33:00.000Z	afd_	aftertaf	my desktop is optimized for the clearlooks. Please don't ask me to change that :)
2005-11-21T14:33:00.000Z	aftertaf	afd_	 reread your error message........; it seems to be that.
