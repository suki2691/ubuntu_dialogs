2010-10-14T00:20:00.000Z	arky	jimcooncat	thanks. Are you conversant with both OS's?
2010-10-14T00:26:00.000Z	jimcooncat	arky	no, I've looked at FreeBSD, but after chatting with them I concluded I'd need more handholding than what they were willing to give at the time. I'm not a noob to computing, either -- just BSD
