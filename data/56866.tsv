2009-05-20T05:16:00.000Z	juxbox		i have a weird problem with sound, nothing with audio works, any idea why and how to fix it?
2009-05-20T05:16:00.000Z	th0r	juxbox	I found reference to a bug in 9.04 where the sound starts muted at bootup. Check the mixer and see if the volume is muted
2009-05-20T05:17:00.000Z	juxbox	th0r	no it's not muted
