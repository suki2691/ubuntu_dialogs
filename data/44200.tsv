2009-10-31T06:12:00.000Z	josh__		hello, can anyone help me change my uid? usermod -u # name doesn't work for me as I only have one user and don't know how to log in as root
2009-10-31T06:14:00.000Z	fede1	josh__	you can use the user & group tools from system->administration
2009-10-31T06:15:00.000Z	fede1	josh__	in user&groups tools,you must click in the lower icon with the graphics of a key and type your root password
2009-10-31T06:15:00.000Z	josh__	fede1	umm hmm, did that. as I am loggen in it won't let me change it though : (
