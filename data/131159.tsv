2008-08-30T13:39:00.000Z	nnull		just wondering why ive got 25+ in the first place, ive googled, some others have this problem but no responses for them

2008-08-30T13:41:00.000Z	pajamian	nnull	hehehe, I can understand that.
2008-08-30T13:42:00.000Z	pajamian	nnull	I would leave it alone unless it's actually causing problems, though
