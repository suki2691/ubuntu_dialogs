2012-08-08T16:12:00.000Z	Bastian_B		my dns is working good, I also cleared them. Delays still present
2012-08-08T16:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bastian_B	did you try disabling ipv6 with the boot option: ipv6.disable=1
2012-08-08T16:15:00.000Z	Bastian_B	ActionParsnip	trying, can we make the disable function working without restarting?
2012-08-08T16:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bastian_B	may be able to use sysctl but not sure
