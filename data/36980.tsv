2011-03-30T03:58:00.000Z	Asad		how does ubuntu act when a key like fn+f4 (to switch to external monitor on laptops) is pressed... Can I map that to a different key?
2011-03-30T03:59:00.000Z	NewWorld	Asad	 you could use xbindkeys to do it
2011-03-30T04:05:00.000Z	Asad	NewWorld	Yes. But I don't really know what kind of a command is used to toggle display in ubuntu .. that was my main question
2011-03-30T04:06:00.000Z	NewWorld	Asad	 try 'xset dpms force off'
