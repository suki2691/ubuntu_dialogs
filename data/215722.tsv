2006-07-15T05:16:00.000Z	g-henna		is it correct that there is no file /etc/ld.so.conf in ubuntu?
2006-07-15T05:17:00.000Z	g-henna		i have the problem that ld links to the so-files in /usr/local/lib fine, but when running the application, these paths are not known to the program and it crashes saying that the lib was not found
2006-07-15T05:18:00.000Z	soundray	g-henna	I've got that file, but I don't know whether that means anything
