2010-09-01T21:56:00.000Z	pfifo	Azjo	use at your own risk! 'rm -rf /usr/man' 'strip /usr/bin/* /usr/lib/*' 'apt-get clean' 'rm -rf /usr/local' 'ln -sf /dev/null /var/log'
2010-09-01T21:59:00.000Z	pfifo	Azjo	in makes ALL system generate log files get deleted automatically without ever taking up a single byte of data on your disk
