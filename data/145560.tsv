2008-03-11T19:25:00.000Z	mEck0		Hi! I'm running NetBeans under Ubuntu 8.04 Alpha6 and have an annoying problem. I can't write special characters like { in NetBeans (works everywhere else). The problem is with all the chars which requires that I use the AltGr-button on the keyboard. When I for instance press AltGr+7 I should get a {, but only gets a 7

2008-03-11T19:26:00.000Z	mEck0	skarface	ok
2008-03-11T19:26:00.000Z	skarface	mEck0	but yeah, support for that is #ubuntu+1
