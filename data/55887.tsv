2009-07-07T08:58:00.000Z	Hylian		say a friend of mine asked if by replacing the 32 bit kernel of ubuntu with the 64 bit, if that would make the system a 64 bit os, i have read some of this, and said i think yes, but i want to make sure, and what is the 64 bit verison called?? please help, thanx.

2009-07-07T08:58:00.000Z	zortec	Hylian	other than that, it hurts performance to run a 64 bit os with a 32 bit cpu
2009-07-07T09:00:00.000Z	zortec	Hylian	There is a huge discussion in the 64 bit forum about running a 64 bit os.  Most like myself are running a 32 bit ubuntu on a dual core system
