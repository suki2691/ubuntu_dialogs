2009-07-08T23:24:00.000Z	jb0nd38372		Hi, I was wondering if the ubuntu team had fixed the issues that came ouyt when 9 was released, i had to downgrade to 8.10 cause I could not get my ati card to work with open source or official ati drivers.
2009-07-08T23:25:00.000Z	zinake1	jb0nd38372	i had a similar issue when i installed 9.04 from scratch... i set everything up in 8.10 and upgraded and everything stayed working
2009-07-08T23:25:00.000Z	zinake1	jb0nd38372	it's not a fix tho ; ;
2009-07-08T23:26:00.000Z	jb0nd38372	zinake1	Thanks, i was runn win7 beta, and was hoping maybe a fresh install of 9 with updates might work, before when i tried 9 the system would work, cept for ati, that was abuot 2 maybe 2.5 months ago
