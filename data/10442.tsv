2011-08-15T01:38:00.000Z	yeats	CynicisM	do you have a particular reason for using VMWare over Linux KVM or Virtualbox?
2011-08-15T01:39:00.000Z	yeats	CynicisM	KVM is very stable and is getting better all the time
2011-08-15T01:45:00.000Z	CynicisM	yeats	apprently my hardware doesnt support virtualisation but ive run slackware on windows virtual machine before
