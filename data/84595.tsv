2008-08-19T06:07:00.000Z	K1ng_K00p4		I'm new to linux, and I'm trying to put it onto an aged laptop (4 years old) with 190 mb of RAM, I'm trying to boot it just from the CD right now, but it's really slow. Will it run ok if I just go ahead and install it?
2008-08-19T06:08:00.000Z	K1ng_K00p4		 It's ubuntu 8.04.

2008-08-19T06:10:00.000Z	kc8pxy	K1ng_K00p4	for one thing,  you either have un-even ram slots( different size sticks) or you have a 128 and a 64 mb. for a lappy only 4 years old,  that's STILL a very little ram.
