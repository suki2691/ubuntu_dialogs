2008-10-18T07:37:00.000Z	strange		hey guys i have a laptop with a t7500 cpu (core2duo 2.2ghz) but when i do cat /proc/cpuinfo it only shows 800mhz per processor, is this some setting thats wrong which makes my laptop not run at full speed?
2008-10-18T07:38:00.000Z	LimCore	strange	perhaps it auto changes frequency, and will change to max freq when needed (when under load)
2008-10-18T07:38:00.000Z	LimCore	strange	that is very good (power saving)
2008-10-18T07:38:00.000Z	strange	LimCore	im not on battery though, shouldnt it just use full speed?
