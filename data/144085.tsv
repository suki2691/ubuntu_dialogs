2007-03-03T14:39:00.000Z	Anixo		Can someone help me fix my usb stick so I can actually save files on it. I finished a project on Ubuntu for school and now I cant save it :/
2007-03-03T14:39:00.000Z	Anixo		I plug it in. Ubuntu mounts it, but is read only.
2007-03-03T14:39:00.000Z	soundray	Anixo	check if it has a tiny locking switch
2007-03-03T14:40:00.000Z	Anixo	soundray	no switch. It is one of those random sticks anyway
