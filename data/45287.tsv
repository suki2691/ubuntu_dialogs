2009-12-15T09:05:00.000Z	zmoazeni		Hey guys, this may not be an ubuntu specific question. But I'm having delays with pings. The ms time is great, but the ping has a delay for every packet sent. I did some googling and changed my nameserver, and disabled ipv6 and neither fixed it
2009-12-15T09:06:00.000Z	Billiard	zmoazeni	how is there a delay if the ms time is great?
2009-12-15T09:06:00.000Z	zmoazeni	Billiard	Not sure, I'm getting a couple second delay for every packet, but still 17ms averages
2009-12-15T09:07:00.000Z	zmoazeni	Billiard	Er 17-20ms times
