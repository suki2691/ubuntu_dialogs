2007-06-10T08:28:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	hikenboot	Is ubuntu automounting it?  (icon on the desktop?)
2007-06-10T08:29:00.000Z	nerdygirl_ellie	hikenboot	if so, right-click and go to "unmount"
2007-06-10T08:34:00.000Z	hikenboot	nerdygirl_ellie	 there is no option to unmount it only eject it in which case fdisk is unable to open it
