2009-05-20T19:10:00.000Z	aethelrick		I have a similar problem stanir
2009-05-20T19:12:00.000Z	stanir	aethelrick	do you have a mixed configuration of drives, like ide/sata?
2009-05-20T19:12:00.000Z	aethelrick		I've had numerous failed attempts at getting ubuntu 9.04 to install on my second SATA disk and it does not install the boot loader correctly. I've followed manuals and guides to the letter and had no success... I seriously considering just putting the openSuSE disk back in because it works without any trouble
2009-05-20T19:13:00.000Z	aethelrick	stanir	no, I have three SATA disks in a hot swap bay
