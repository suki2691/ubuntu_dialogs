2006-07-19T12:27:00.000Z	jdier		just installed xmms skins package via synaptic...  how can I determine which directory the skins were put in?
2006-07-19T12:28:00.000Z	jrib	jdier	dpkg -L package_name
2006-07-19T12:32:00.000Z	jdier	jrib	thank you.  When going back to synaptic to verify the exact name of the package I also saw that under properties I could see everywhere synaptic had put files.
2006-07-19T12:33:00.000Z	jdier	jrib	- thanks for the command line instructions though!  I am a newbie, but trying hard to learn more and more about command line.  Very much appreciate the help.
