2009-05-11T21:47:00.000Z	WindowSmasher		Hey all. I'm having trouble with my ubuntu 9.04 system. I've been googling, but I don't see too many people with the same performance issues that I have.
2009-05-11T21:47:00.000Z	WindowSmasher		Have there been any in-room reports regarding poor performance?
2009-05-11T21:49:00.000Z	Halitech	WindowSmasher	have you installed the restricted drivers for the video card?
2009-05-11T21:50:00.000Z	Halitech	WindowSmasher	might help so we can get you to try things with you
