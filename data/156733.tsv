2008-02-22T11:13:00.000Z	tyler_d	Frijolie	scaleability.... add/remove is simple, little to no control over versions etc.. synaptic allows further control
2008-02-22T11:14:00.000Z	Frijolie	tyler_d	why not just grant Add/Remove Synaptic's power and have one to rule them all instead of an annoying little cousin who claims to be as great?
2008-02-22T11:15:00.000Z	tyler_d	Frijolie	scaleability.... multiple users.. different skill levels etc etc etc
