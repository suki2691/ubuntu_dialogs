2006-06-08T08:31:00.000Z	J-_		hey, can i install and run the ubuntu 6.06 server straight into a router, or do i need to pit another nic card into the machine and have my windows connected to the server as well... probably making a complete fool outta myself, but we gotta start somewhere =P
2006-06-08T08:32:00.000Z	Faileas	J-_	in a real sense : PC->one NIC to router, set the router to port forward...
2006-06-08T08:32:00.000Z	Faileas		i use a VMware setup that needs two NICs but thats a different kettle of fish
2006-06-08T08:33:00.000Z	J-_	Faileas	so i can just connect the machine to the router like i normally do>
