Was trying to follow the instructions for installing Google App Engine, which for some reason requires python2.5 I compiled it from source, found that didn't work for various reasons, and at length was told by a friend that the instructions were just outdated. I noticed that the install had set py2.5 to be my default python. Of course, that was silly,

Unfortunately, upon restarting the system, gdm showed nothing but a background. Swapping into TTY, I found most applications no longer worked properly, due to some variant of this error: http://pastebin.com/2GygRXQF With libz and "no version information..." being common across all of the errors. Any ideas on how to get this fix
