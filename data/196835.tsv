2006-06-20T06:15:00.000Z	DrShade	BlueEagle	I probably skewed that question, some terminology was off a bit, thanks though!
2006-06-20T06:22:00.000Z	DrShade	BlueEagle	another question if you don't mind, I read on the Ubuntu Wiki site that ntfs parts are auto detected/mounted by Ubuntu - I'm not finding this to be the case.  The Disks Manager utility shows the partition to be mounted in /tmp/disks-conf-hda1 - is that normal?
