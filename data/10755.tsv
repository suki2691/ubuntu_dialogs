2011-08-08T19:22:00.000Z	craigbass1976		I need a new printer.  I'm leaning toward laser that scans and faxes.  Anyone have particularly good luck with a specific model?  Brothers always work, but printing pdfs over the networks is always waaaaaay slow for some reason.

2011-08-08T19:26:00.000Z	craigbass1976	[HzF]Rocker	I'm leaning that way, mostly because I've yet to meet a home printer that prints photos well (I'm talking local photo shop quality -- not Wal-Mart developing), so there's no sense in getting one.
