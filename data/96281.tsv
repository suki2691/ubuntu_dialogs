2010-07-27T00:30:00.000Z	nacitar		On ubuntu lucid x64, I can't seem to get the repository to provide me with 32-bit static libs for libXdamage and libXfixes, it only provides 64-bit libs... is there some way of fixing this?
2010-07-27T00:32:00.000Z	BluesKaj	nacitar	you're running a 64 bit OS hence apt has liste 64 bit sources as default, and you're implying the 64 bit libs on't work
