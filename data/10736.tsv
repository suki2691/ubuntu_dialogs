2011-08-22T02:49:00.000Z	Polah	Lafiir	the system booting up and then the splash screen from Plymouth
2011-08-22T02:50:00.000Z	Lafiir	Polah	Ok, so not some boot manager waiting for something then? good
2011-08-22T02:51:00.000Z	Polah	Lafiir	No, it's just what gets shown when it's booting up but before the splash screen
