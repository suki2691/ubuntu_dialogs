In windows, FLAC had several "front end" GUI's that made batch encoding a drag & drop affair... From the command line in Ubuntu, however, I cannot figure out how to batch anything; only one file at a time
2005-06-29T11:32:00.000Z	djm62	uc50ic4more	for i in *.wav; do <flac-encode command>; done;

2005-06-29T11:33:00.000Z	djm62	uc50ic4more	for more info, man bash ;)
