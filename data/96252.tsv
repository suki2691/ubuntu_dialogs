2009-06-04T04:57:00.000Z	graelin	zamnedix	Archive manager.. suppose it depends on the archive.. Actually sounds like a shell script would be appropriate
2009-06-04T04:57:00.000Z	zamnedix	graelin	I have RAR, 7z, and ZIP. My archive manager doesn't support any of those. What kind of a shell script would I use?
2009-06-04T05:01:00.000Z	zamnedix	graelin	I don't have admin. Don't ask.
