2010-05-15T17:01:00.000Z	bro	MACscr	only if you install wubi
2010-05-15T17:02:00.000Z	MACscr	bro	that's what im looking at. Was thinking about installing it that way to play around with it, figured would be better than trying a live cd
2010-05-15T17:03:00.000Z	bro	MACscr	yes, you can install ubuntu through wubi just like installing any other software. and it will run well, with just a bit of performance penalty on disc writing
