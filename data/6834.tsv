2011-12-27T23:47:00.000Z	kikitheman		Hello , I have a "problem" with Ubuntu . Before I had Ubuntu and Windows installed on the same drive ( C and E ) .Now I got an SSD and I installed windows on it . How can I make Ubuntu show up in the boot options again ,without reinstalling it ?
2011-12-27T23:48:00.000Z	theadmin	kikitheman	Eh... sudo update-grub # I suppose.
2011-12-27T23:48:00.000Z	kikitheman	theadmin	, I type that into terminal and then it updates the bootloader ? I don't want to have to reinstall both OS's ...
2011-12-27T23:49:00.000Z	theadmin	kikitheman	Yeah, that should do what you said it should do :P
