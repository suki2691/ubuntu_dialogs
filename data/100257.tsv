2008-03-31T18:24:00.000Z	bhsx	mad_max02	try brasero, it's similar to nero
2008-03-31T18:25:00.000Z	mad_max02	bhsx	why would I change nero when its the best ???
2008-03-31T18:25:00.000Z	mad_max02	bhsx	I just asked is there any easier way of uninstalling it them doing it manually just because I'm installing newer version from deb
2008-03-31T18:26:00.000Z	mad_max02	bhsx	well nero is free too
