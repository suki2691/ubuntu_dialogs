2009-08-04T08:20:00.000Z	blognewb	losher	oh i really didn't know what LTS implied sorry
2009-08-04T08:20:00.000Z	blognewb		so "end of life" != LTS i guess?
2009-08-04T08:21:00.000Z	losher	blognewb	LTS just means it will be supported for longer so you don't have to upgrade it as often, that's all. LTS = long term support.
