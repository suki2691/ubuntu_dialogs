2009-08-05T21:42:00.000Z	brianV	Mike_lifeguard	I do. If you aren't specific enough, it autocompletes for the first name. Ideally, it would just not autocomplete at all until you've typed in enough to narrow it down to a specific nick

2009-08-05T21:43:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	brianV	it should be default behaviour, but meh
