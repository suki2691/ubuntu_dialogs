2011-01-24T20:04:00.000Z	NoReflex		hello! anyone know which lucid kernel has SMP support? I have a P4 3.Ghz CPU with HT (ht appears as a flag in proc/cpuinfo) but gnome-system-monitor and top report only one CPU. Currently I have 2.6.32-26-generic installed
2011-01-24T20:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	NoReflex	all of them have smp support
2011-01-24T20:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	NoReflex	maybe ht is disabled in bios ?
