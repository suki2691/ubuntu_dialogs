2011-09-27T17:45:00.000Z	rns		anyone know if using workspaces consumes more memory?
2011-09-27T17:46:00.000Z	Stanley00	rns	dont know, but why do you ask that?
2011-09-27T17:47:00.000Z	rns	Stanley00	because if I have 4 different workspaces with programs running, I want to know if it will slow things down or if there is some efficient memory management happening in the background.
