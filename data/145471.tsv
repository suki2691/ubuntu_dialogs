2008-02-18T21:18:00.000Z	Seracht		Hi. I remember when I installed ubuntu a while ago (I think 7.04) during live install I had to select different things like keyboard/video card drivers and all. Do I still ahve to perform these steps with Gutsy?

2008-02-18T21:19:00.000Z	Seracht	usr13	I didn't install ubuntu yet. I'm afraid I will get stuck in installation and won't know how to proceed. Especially with no windows installed :P
