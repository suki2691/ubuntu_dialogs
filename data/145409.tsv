2007-02-18T07:55:00.000Z	testify	Broam	So is there any install that supports an Intel 64 bit processor (that will run as 64-bit)?
2007-02-18T07:56:00.000Z	Broam	testify	try the x86_64 images
2007-02-18T07:56:00.000Z	Broam	testify	however, i386 will work just fine, and you can fall back to it if stuff gets wonky
