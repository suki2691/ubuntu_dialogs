2008-09-10T17:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	uffo	there is no best, are you going to be using windows?
2008-09-10T17:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	uffo	its fine, use ext3 if you are pure ubuntu
2008-09-10T17:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	uffo	ntfs if you have some windows system you want to acccess it on (you could samba share it and access over lan if you have it too ;))
