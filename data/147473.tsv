2007-01-29T07:09:00.000Z	shmeelAway	jkakar	what did you use to set up your vmdk file?
2007-01-29T07:10:00.000Z	jkakar	shmeelAway	I used the vmware-server GUI (on dapper) to set it up.  When I upgrade to edgy vmware stopped working--this solved that problem: http://blog.bz2.nl/2006/10/27/vmware-server-console-on-ubuntu-610-edgy-eft-hangs/
