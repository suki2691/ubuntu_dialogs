2010-01-14T13:09:00.000Z	dandaman		so i just upgraded to 9.10 from 9.04, when i scroll in firefox it gets choppy and i cant have basic and advanced visual effects because it wont load them, im guessing i need to reinstall my graphics drivers
2010-01-14T13:09:00.000Z	dandaman		in which case, is ubuntu 9.10 linux x86 or linux x86_64?
