2007-06-26T07:34:00.000Z	BadRobot		 hi there how can i install Ubuntustudio via command line?
2007-06-26T07:35:00.000Z	Vich	BadRobot	-> how did you install it in the first place?
2007-06-26T07:48:00.000Z	Vich	BadRobot	not sure you can update your standard ubuntu to ubuntu studio, but you can certainly install all the packages it has
2007-06-26T07:49:00.000Z	Vich	BadRobot	perhaps you should ask in #ubuntustudio
