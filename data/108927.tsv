2010-11-14T12:35:00.000Z	furi		i am currently having boot problems, and have for nearly a week. the boot completely stops in its tracks. the suspects of this crime are: the update i did before i rebooted 6 days ago, and the console configuration file. can someone help me with this? the last two lines given in the boot are:
2010-11-14T12:35:00.000Z	furi		 * Setting console screen modes and fonts
2010-11-14T12:35:00.000Z	furi		^[[12;2R
