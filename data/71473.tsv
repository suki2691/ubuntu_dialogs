2008-12-12T17:16:00.000Z	gimpscape		is this a good image for machine running intel pentium dual core processor? http://ubuntu.cs.utah.edu/releases/intrepid/ubuntu-8.10-desktop-amd64.iso
2008-12-12T17:17:00.000Z	gimpscape		it has "amd64" it its name which worries me a bit
2008-12-12T17:17:00.000Z	banteng	gimpscape	use 32 bit version
