2008-11-04T01:31:00.000Z	ShackJac1		HI all - I just upgraded to *Xubuntu*  Intrepid on an (old Thinkpad iSeries - 192MB)... the upgrade seemed to go smoothly, but when I restart it won't go into the GUI. After the progress bar goes out the screen goes blank (though the backlight is still on) and I can't drop to command line, etc.... Any suggestions?]
2008-11-04T01:31:00.000Z	deadkode	ShackJac1	you can't ctrl-alt-f1 to a console?
2008-11-04T01:31:00.000Z	ShackJac1		How do I change the graphic driver X is using from the command line - recinfugre xserver-xorg does not give me the option
2008-11-04T01:32:00.000Z	ShackJac1	deadkode	No, but i can get to a console if I start in recovery... I just want to know how to change the driver to use whatever the driver being used to show me the progress bar as that seems to work...
