2007-10-11T07:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	speedy20	 download the source from the progarms homepage, install the needed developer tools/packages/cpmpilers and libs. compile the source.
2007-10-11T07:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	speedy20	  i have no idea what a .mrc file is.. if its mirc related.. you are out of luck. time to learn a better irc client. :)
