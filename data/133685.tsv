2007-05-31T10:05:00.000Z	MSTK		does anyone know of a way where I can view package descriptions/info in the terminal using apt-get?
2007-05-31T10:05:00.000Z	MSTK		it's the only reason I'm still using the GUI package manager.
2007-05-31T10:06:00.000Z	GomoX	MSTK	apt-cache search <package>
2007-05-31T10:06:00.000Z	MSTK	GomoX	- thanks :)
