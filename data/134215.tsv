2008-01-09T02:22:00.000Z	rokra		why the 3D is not integrated in the xubuntu ? like in ubuntu?
2008-01-09T02:22:00.000Z	nickrud	rokra	most people that install xubuntu don't like all the hand holding that ubuntu does, so it expects you to do much manually
2008-01-09T02:25:00.000Z	rokra	nickrud	yeap, so you confirm me that the 3d is not installed by default on xubuntu?
2008-01-09T02:25:00.000Z	nickrud	rokra	it's in ubuntu-restricted-modules-$(uname -r) . I'm not sure if it gets installed by default
