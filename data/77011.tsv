2009-02-17T13:29:00.000Z	lianimator		how can grep be used to search in multiple files?
2009-02-17T13:31:00.000Z	jimcooncat	lianimator	probably "cat file1 file2 file3 | grep what"
2009-02-17T13:37:00.000Z	lianimator	jimcooncat	do I need to do cat first? seems redundant
2009-02-17T13:39:00.000Z	jimcooncat	lianimator	maybe. my command line skills just get me through the day.
