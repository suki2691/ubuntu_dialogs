2012-09-01T21:33:00.000Z	robotwizard		hello. I'm trying to decide between intalling the desktop or server edition. Server seems to be database friendly and I would like to learn database but havn't worked with linux in a few years.
2012-09-01T21:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	robotwizard	 you can install any services you need on the desktop edition.
2012-09-01T21:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	robotwizard	 you want a GUI? or just console/text interface?
2012-09-01T21:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	robotwizard	 then install the desktop edition.....
