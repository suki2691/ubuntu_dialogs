2008-11-28T09:40:00.000Z	fishhooker		so i'm currently on vista, but thinking of making the switch this summer
2008-11-28T09:40:00.000Z	fishhooker		i've got 3GB of RAM, should i use 32 or 64 bit ubuntu?
2008-11-28T09:41:00.000Z	genii-around	fishhooker	Probably 32 bit will give you less headaches at this time
2008-11-28T09:42:00.000Z	genii-around	fishhooker	32bit works on both 32 or 64 bit cpus but only sees normally about 3.2Gb of ram. 64 bit only runs on 64 bit cpus and sees all your ram. Most apps run in 32 bit
