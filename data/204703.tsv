2006-01-04T16:01:00.000Z	Kyral	sanjay	what did you change your DNS to?
2006-01-04T16:01:00.000Z	Kyral	sanjay	its set to my ISP's server
2006-01-04T16:02:00.000Z	sanjay	Kyral	provided by my ISP -- 203.94.227.70 -- it resets it to the gateway address which is generally ok but my isp is weird and uses a separate DNS server ..
