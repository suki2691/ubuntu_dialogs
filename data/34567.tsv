2010-10-25T16:51:00.000Z	SingAlong	Robinux	the archive manager can do this. you just have to install one pkg (which i remember is unrar)
2010-10-25T16:52:00.000Z	SingAlong	Robinux	the archive manager can open any kind of archive but just needs the specific pkg installed. there's one for 7z files, rar files etc
