2008-12-22T02:53:00.000Z	Giggsteve8		Hey guys... beginner question. I'm preparing to load Ubuntu 8.10 from an iso on a PC already loaded with XP, when I get to the setup, and I drag to create space for Ubuntu, how do I know it won't delete any info used by XP?
2008-12-22T02:55:00.000Z	Giggsteve8		mib: Would it be helpful to defrag first, to get it all together? Is there a safe way to do it, other than fresh installing both and partitioning?
