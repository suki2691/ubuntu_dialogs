2006-11-22T08:03:00.000Z	Aberry		hello people, I just installed ubuntu on two old servers, both 700mhz pIII with 256meg ram and one of them is running horribly slow, and I can't figure out why. It doesn't seem to be processing anything while it lags but it takes up to five minutes to open any given program.

2006-11-22T08:06:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	Aberry	open a terminal, and type top
2006-11-22T08:07:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	Aberry	it'll open up something similar to the task manager in windows, only much more responsive
