2009-08-20T00:16:00.000Z	AdamDV		Hello, I'm wondering how to backup user mail using maildirs with postfix and dovecot?
2009-08-20T00:18:00.000Z	stefg	AdamDV	#ubuntu-server might be the more appropriate place to ask for that
2009-08-20T00:18:00.000Z	AdamDV	stefg	Everyone's idle or no one knows :/
2009-08-20T00:20:00.000Z	stefg	AdamDV	in here it's: noone knows, but making noise at it :-) .... but seriously: is there anything specail about maildirs? I'd use something like rdiff-backup and make , well, backups on a separate disk/foel server
