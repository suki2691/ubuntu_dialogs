2011-10-16T18:36:00.000Z	syn3rgy		Hi, I just updated to the newest Ubuntu. For some reason Flash Player can not be updated and I can't watch Flash video. How do I fix this?
2011-10-16T18:37:00.000Z	syn3rgy		Why does flash not work on the new Ubuntu?
2011-10-16T18:38:00.000Z	lunitik	syn3rgy	you haven't installed ubuntu-restricted-extras
2011-10-16T18:39:00.000Z	syn3rgy	lunitik	Ibis  but it was installed before I updated. So I need t reinstall flash? I can't find synaptic to see what is installed and not.
