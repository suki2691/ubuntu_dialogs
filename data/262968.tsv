2004-10-16T05:42:00.000Z	smo		I'm not sure Progeny is either  (altho I don't recall wether it gives any DE any real bias)
2004-10-16T05:42:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	smo	is progeny still putting out a distro?
2004-10-16T05:43:00.000Z	smo	jgeorgeson	There's alphas of a progeny debian 2 .. it's more a testbed for their componentised linux tho, rather than a targetted distro
