2007-07-17T14:10:00.000Z	nox-Hand		I am compiling software and seem to be missing this: checking for giblib - version >= 1.2.3... no
2007-07-17T14:10:00.000Z	nox-Hand		And idea where to geet that package?
2007-07-17T14:11:00.000Z	bruenig|laptop	nox-Hand	giblib-dev, for future reference, do apt-cache search "whatever package it says it needs"
2007-07-17T14:13:00.000Z	nox-Hand	bruenig|laptop	Darn it xD I have been doing that for ages and just now notice I am doing a search for gidlib xP
