2010-01-08T19:22:00.000Z	abli		Hi! how can I check whether inetd is running? I have an ubuntu 8.04.3 (hardy) server, and even though I edited /etc/inetd.conf, I can't connect to the service.
2010-01-08T19:22:00.000Z	abli		Is hardy using some other inetd-replacement?
2010-01-08T19:22:00.000Z	Ziber	abli	have you tried oidentd?
2010-01-08T19:23:00.000Z	Ziber	abli	not sure, but i know oidentd is really good
