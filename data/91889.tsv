2008-05-21T23:59:00.000Z	jay4		should I install a package that is "NOT AUTHORIZED"?
2008-05-22T00:00:00.000Z	Pici	jay4	I suggest doing an apt-get update first.
2008-05-22T00:01:00.000Z	Pici	jay4	Usually that authorization message comes up if it could not connect to the servers on the last update.
2008-05-22T00:02:00.000Z	jay4	Pici	thanks, that cleared it up
