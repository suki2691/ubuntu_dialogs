2012-11-14T01:19:00.000Z	InTheZone		Hey. I just installed Ubuntu 12.10 with the Windows Installer. Everything went well, and now on Start Up when it prompts me to choose an operating system, after I select Ubuntu the screen goes black. I waited for a couple of minutes but nothing ever changes
2012-11-14T01:20:00.000Z	theadmin	InTheZone	Is your Windows system 64-bit?
2012-11-14T01:20:00.000Z	theadmin	InTheZone	Apparently WUBI doesn't work with 32-bit anymore for some insane reason and they never even warned anyone :/
2012-11-14T01:20:00.000Z	theadmin	InTheZone	I have the same thing and dunno if I can help. I suggest doing a proper install
