2011-12-02T22:26:00.000Z	djmitche		I'm having some trouble mapping keyboards into X11 sessions on Lucid.  /lib/udev/keymap -i shows kernel keyboard events on input/event2, but no keyboard or mouse interaction has any onscreen effect in X11.
2011-12-02T22:27:00.000Z	djmitche		Any pointers on where X11 looks to figure out what keyboard/mouse to use?
2011-12-02T22:28:00.000Z	djmitche		it doesn't exist, hmm
2011-12-02T22:29:00.000Z	theadmin	djmitche	It doesn't normally exist, xorg autoconfigures itself in case it doesn't
