2006-05-11T09:51:00.000Z	salty		Hi all, im rather new to Ubuntu (but loving it alot more than danmed windows), and i have a technical problem that i can find the soluntion to on any forums - anyone able to help?
2006-05-11T09:53:00.000Z	salty		I'm running a pentium 3 with no USB boot support, with no Internal HD (as it died and im over seas) and ubuntu from liveCD - i've got a 250gig external HD that mounts no problem, but im hoping theres a way to set Ubuntu to default save all files and Programs to the external, rather than into my RAM - any ideas?
2006-05-11T09:54:00.000Z	salty		can you recommed any good LiveCD's for a newbie?
