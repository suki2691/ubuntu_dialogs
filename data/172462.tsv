2006-07-31T10:58:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	apeman2020	sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-07-31T11:01:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	apeman2020	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2006-07-31T11:03:00.000Z	joshuapurcell	apeman2020	sudo apt-get update may do the trick, but you may need to look at what repositories you have listed in you /etc/apt/sources.list file
