2010-03-08T10:54:00.000Z	Andorin	Roasted	Actually, I think that support for custom GDM themes was dropped with the newest login manager software... there's a way to do it but it's kind of a pain.
2010-03-08T10:54:00.000Z	Roasted	Andorin	oh, really? Well dang... Gnome-look is littered with a ton of nice ones. I'd like to get one running. :(
