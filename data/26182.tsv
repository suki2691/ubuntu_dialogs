2010-09-20T13:55:00.000Z	MissingPerson		awesome, i think you guys saved a lot of headaches

2010-09-20T14:12:00.000Z	MissingPerson	bobstro	does tmp auto clear after dvd copying?  i don't do much of either ripping or burning, but i'd like to know that i'm not going to get screwed out of one by not having enough tmp space?
