2011-04-28T18:28:00.000Z	Gawwad		Hello, I'm on Ubuntu 10.4 and wanting to upgrade to 11.4 as I just read it was released. However, it's not listed in the update manager after refreshing. (I have it set to normal releases) Only 10.10 is shown. Am I missing something?
2011-04-28T18:29:00.000Z	Gawwad		Ok, thanks! Was sure you were able to upgrade from long term version to another :)

2011-04-28T18:32:00.000Z	Pici	Gawwad	Yes.
