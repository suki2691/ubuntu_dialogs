2009-07-15T11:03:00.000Z	``y7		i just installed ubuntu on a machine that i already had ubuntu on. i switched out the hdds. ubuntu installs to the new hdd just fine, but when it goes to boot up, i get an error: "Filesystem type unknown, partition type 0x7"... "Error 17: Cannot mount selected partition"... windows XP installs and boots up to this drive just fine. any ideas where i'm going wrong with ubuntu?

2009-07-15T11:05:00.000Z	``y7	nanotube	yes. i've also tried debian and that fails as well. i'd guess it's an hdd issue, but it works fine with windows xp
