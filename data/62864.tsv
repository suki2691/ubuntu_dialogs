2009-03-23T17:04:00.000Z	Guest4409		Hi, how do I configure ircd-hybrid? I have it running, but I can't connect.
2009-03-23T17:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	Guest4409	 for somthing like that - you may want to check the programs homepage and docs
2009-03-23T17:06:00.000Z	Guest4409	dr_willis	can't find anything on their site, and what docs do you mean?
2009-03-23T17:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	Guest4409	 if the program is lacking in docs.. i dont suggest using it then
