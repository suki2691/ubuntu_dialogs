2008-09-12T07:26:00.000Z	rellis		Hi all. I have a developer in my group who was getting the "man in the middle attack" warning from openssh because the key changed on our server. He has since removed the offending line from ~/.ssh/known_hosts but for some reason Konqueror still reports the problem.. any idea where this comes from?

2008-09-12T07:27:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	rellis	#kubuntu
2008-09-12T07:27:00.000Z	rellis	SebNaitsabes	Okay, thanks. Will do.
