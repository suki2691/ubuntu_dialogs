2004-11-11T07:46:00.000Z	greg_		Hello.
2004-11-11T07:47:00.000Z	greg_		I just reinstalled warty from the released CD iso, but now I'm having trouble installing some things from universe that used to be no problem. There seem to be some packages missing.
2004-11-11T07:47:00.000Z	greg_		Any ideas?
2004-11-11T07:48:00.000Z	jdub	greg_	have you enabled universe and done an update?
