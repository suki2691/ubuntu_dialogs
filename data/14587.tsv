However, in 11.10 when I right click them, they just launch as if I had left clicked them. Is there a different way to add things to the panel now?

2011-10-13T22:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	daviddoria	it's similar in some ways, but differnet in others
2011-10-13T22:33:00.000Z	daviddoria	sebsebseb	then how do I add things from the menu to the panel?
