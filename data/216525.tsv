2006-07-23T06:41:00.000Z	lostinc		Hi I installed xUbuntu while I like it I would like to upgrade (or downgrade it depends on the point of view) to the latest GNOME Desktop with all the bells and whistles. How can I do that without a full reinstall?

2006-07-23T06:43:00.000Z	ardchoille	lostinc	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
