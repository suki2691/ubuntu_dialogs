2007-04-10T10:04:00.000Z	computer13137		 I have a question.  I do not know how "related to Ubuntu" this is, but I wanted to ask you, because I know you're a knowledgable group of people.  What I would like to do, is make bandwidth logs for my server.  I would like to know if there is a program available for Linux that can make logs like this one...  http://voyager.unitedfederationofgaming.com/~kirk/Temporary/sample.png  ... That's from a local ISP, don't redistribute that if possible but 
2007-04-10T10:05:00.000Z	Zewey	computer13137	look for MRTG
2007-04-10T10:05:00.000Z	Zewey	computer13137	or Cactus... i'm not sure which one is more popular or usable
2007-04-10T10:06:00.000Z	Zewey	computer13137	look for "mrtg". Ubuntu doesn't package cactus so you might have to google a bit ;)
