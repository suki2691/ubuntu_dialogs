Last night, I had put the laptop in hibernate mode after a presentation and (perhaps I forgot to disconnect the S-Video cable first) the screen wasn't working this morning, so I went and blindly did a manual reboot in a terminal to what it is now. How can I make gnome show the menus and taskbar again?
