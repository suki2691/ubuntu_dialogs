2009-08-18T05:53:00.000Z	CaptainCrook		i want to save my project files in a (restricted directory)... but don't want to run the entire app under root...  any other way than the pain of saving in non restricted then acquiring priviledge then copying to the restricted directory?

2009-08-18T05:54:00.000Z	CaptainCrook	hackulator	 any way to ask for a password when saving in restricted instead?
