2012-03-17T06:14:00.000Z	zykotic10	itaylor57	i don't understand the community effort to replace OpenOffice with LibreOffice, yet even after this recent oracle java / licensing fiasco openjava still isn't enouraged by the community? </OT sorry>
2012-03-17T06:16:00.000Z	itaylor57	zykotic10	yea i can't contribute to open java because oracle requires you to sign an agreement that violates my companys intellecutal property agreement
2012-03-17T06:17:00.000Z	zykotic10	itaylor57	EXACTLY - so why does anyone use java? </OT i promise>
