2012-01-28T00:37:00.000Z	chapi		I am a first time user of Ubuntu, just downloaded it yesterday. After several hours i was able to get it running but have one minor issue, connecting a bluetooth keyboard. I have searchedfor hours and dont know where else to look. Can someone point me in the right direction?
