2010-12-17T03:15:00.000Z	kholby		So, I'm dual booting ubuntu and Vista and having issues with the time in Vista.  I set hwclock to localtime, but no fix.  Time is always right in Linux, but when I booted in just now I checked hwclock and it was utc.  I check a couple minutes later and hwclock was localtime.
2010-12-17T03:15:00.000Z	histo	kholby	so why are you asking here?  Time is off in vista has nothing to do with ubuntu
2010-12-17T03:16:00.000Z	histo	kholby	ubuntu can't set the clock in teh bios
2010-12-17T03:19:00.000Z	kholby	histo	  You're wrong.  I does change it.
