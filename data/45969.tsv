2010-10-03T03:59:00.000Z	bobo123	Danno	yes use the "advanced install" so you can select wich harddisk to install to
2010-10-03T04:11:00.000Z	bobo123	Danno	well... you only need a "/" partition (Ext4), and a swap partition if you don't want to complicate things. there is a how-to-install-ubuntu10.04 guide with screenshots on http://news.softpedia.com/news/Installing-Ubuntu-10-04-LTS-141550.shtml that might help
