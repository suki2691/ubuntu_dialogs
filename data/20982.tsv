2011-02-27T00:16:00.000Z	schnuffle1	motaka2	but you can use special purpose CDs, like linux rescue, that should be smaller
2011-02-27T00:16:00.000Z	motaka2	schnuffle1	it is not possible for  me, it would take years if I wanna dl such size here with such slow connection
2011-02-27T00:17:00.000Z	schnuffle1	motaka2	have you your install CD somewhere?
