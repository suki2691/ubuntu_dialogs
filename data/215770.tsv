2007-05-21T12:22:00.000Z	Just1n		I hate where microsoft is going with vista, so i have decided to try and make the switch to linux. I've installed both Ubuntu and Kubuntu. I really like the Gnome Desktop in Unbuntu alot more. Only problem is i can't cant any distro of linus to properly display the Xserv with my video card (256m Nvidia 6800 GT, PCI-E) I've done some research and all i can seem to find are fixes for the AGP or standard PCI versions. Just curious if maybe anothe
2007-05-21T12:23:00.000Z	Just1n		When the restricted drivers manager updates my video dirvers it causes xserv to crash and i'm force to reinstall the whole os, due to lack of repair knowledge in linux.
2007-05-21T12:25:00.000Z	Just1n		okay i'll give that a shot in a sec, currently reloading Vista under a new partition. =(
