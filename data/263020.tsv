2005-02-25T06:52:00.000Z	Aron_Figaro		I've hit another problem, I'm trying to set up Flash. I'm on X86_64, on Warty - I've got the installer but it's not supported by my architecture. Is there anything I can do?
2005-02-25T06:54:00.000Z	Aron_Figaro		Oh by the way...anyone here try Vega Strike in Ubuntu yet?
