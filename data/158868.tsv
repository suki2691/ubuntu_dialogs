2007-11-23T00:33:00.000Z	Esteth		Can i safely follow the isntructions at  http://kubuntu.org/announcements/kde4-rc1.php without messing up GNOME or KDE3.5?
2007-11-23T00:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	Esteth	I would assume so, ask in #kubuntu though
2007-11-23T00:33:00.000Z	Esteth	Jordan_U_	Ah, didn't know there was a #kubuntu
2007-11-23T00:33:00.000Z	Esteth	Jordan_U_	Thanks :)
