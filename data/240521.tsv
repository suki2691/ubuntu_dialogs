2005-12-23T12:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	userr	 yes - I belive most of the players ignore the region. (or so i recall reading)
2005-12-23T12:23:00.000Z	userr	Dr_Willis	what players do you recommend for Ubuntu?
2005-12-23T12:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	userr	 vlc, xine, mplayer,   :P those are the big 3, and their variants.
