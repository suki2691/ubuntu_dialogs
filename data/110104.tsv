2007-12-11T04:32:00.000Z	PPreda		hello all, I have an ATI mobile 9600, when I install the restricted driver and reboot it did not get back to X, anyone has any idea or met this problem before?
2007-12-11T04:32:00.000Z	linenoise	PPreda	hah... best of luck... again linux support totally fails it here
2007-12-11T04:33:00.000Z	PPreda	linenoise	I know, just asking if anyone had any luck with it
2007-12-11T04:33:00.000Z	linenoise	PPreda	most ati cards fail under linux (outside of 2d)
