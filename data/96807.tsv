2008-06-18T15:56:00.000Z	wildman		hello there, I've just updated my system (according to notification on top bar) and after that it won't boot anymore with the new kernel (-19), one of the updated packages...
2008-06-18T15:57:00.000Z	wildman		how do I safely roll back kernel to the working one (this one, 2.6.24-18) ?

2008-06-18T15:59:00.000Z	wildman	DistroJockey	wgrant: that's not a very nice solution, though it is the only one that works
