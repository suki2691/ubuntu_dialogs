2006-06-28T08:29:00.000Z	overridex		how's ubuntu 64?  Just got a new box and not sure if I should go 32 or 64... what's the benefit of 64-bit ubuntu? what's broken compared to 32-bit?
2006-06-28T08:29:00.000Z	apokryphos	overridex	see the FAQ
2006-06-28T08:37:00.000Z	overridex	apokryphos	hmm.... i dont' see any mention of 64 vs 32 in the faq, is there a separate faq for 64-bit?
2006-06-28T08:37:00.000Z	apokryphos	overridex	it's in the FAQ.. no. 5
