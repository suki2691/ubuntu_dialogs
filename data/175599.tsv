2006-08-01T10:49:00.000Z	stefg	rellim	sadly the only samba client i've found was the crappy old xffm4 (xfsamba4)
2006-08-01T10:50:00.000Z	rellim	stefg	nope, i refuse ... i saw one that was really nice, it didn't look pretty but the feature set was awesome, i just can't remember the name of it
2006-08-01T10:50:00.000Z	rellim	stefg	xffm4 was crap :/
