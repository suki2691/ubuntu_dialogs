2012-09-18T06:54:00.000Z	twoblackeyes		hello - I'm experiencing a strange issue I'm curious if anyone else has run across
2012-09-18T06:55:00.000Z	twoblackeyes		the issue results in my USB keyboard and mouse both not working for about 2 minutes after first boot
2012-09-18T06:56:00.000Z	twoblackeyes		sorry, the rest follows on one line: usb input devices don't work, even after unplugging and replugging every USB connected device; but without any action, they do begin to work after a period of about two minutes after boot. Anyone else experience anything like this ever?
