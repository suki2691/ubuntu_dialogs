2007-03-21T09:36:00.000Z	michael		I screwed up Ubuntu. I tried to install some OSX icons and all of a sudden everything dissappeared and I couldn't use Alt+F2 to bring up a terminal. I used Ctrl+Alt+Backspace to try to fix it. When I tried logging back on, it (now) is stuck at logging in. (The splash screen)
2007-03-21T09:36:00.000Z	bbunuser	michael	have you tried setting ur xserv.conf to default?
2007-03-21T09:38:00.000Z	michael	bbunuser	doesn't work, how can I delete just my preferences as to themes?
2007-03-21T09:40:00.000Z	bbunuser	michael	hate to say this but i dont think theres anyway easy way unless the program u used to hack the icons made backups, imnot expertise enough to know how to set preferences to defult threw cmd butsomeone here will help u eventually
