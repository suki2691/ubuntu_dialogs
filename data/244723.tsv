2012-05-31T20:54:00.000Z	Brend		Hi everyone. So I'm using Xubuntu 12.04, and tonight my mouse has started freaking out. It's as if either the middle button or the scroll wheel are stuck active -- any window I move over is brought to the front, any select box (or tab set) I hover on goes straight to the last item, etc. It doesn't seem to be the mouse itself, it happens with every mouse I have.
2012-05-31T20:55:00.000Z	Brend		While poking around I've noticed that my keyboard is being detected as a mouse (two mice, in fact!) and I'm wondering if that's related: http://bpaste.net/show/qGfOVDylAvfkyK4Efdgh/
