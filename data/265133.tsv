2005-09-01T14:55:00.000Z	AzMoo		Hi guys, I'm trying to mount a network share from my windows box, and it's telling me it can't because of a bad superblock ... How come?
2005-09-01T14:56:00.000Z	AzMoo		'sudo mount -t smbfs -o user=matt //azmoo/downloads mnt/azmoo-downloads' is the command I'm using.
2005-09-01T09:07:00.000Z	AzMoo		Hey people. Is there a way I can extract a whole bunch of tar files at once?
2005-09-01T09:08:00.000Z	aru	AzMoo	I right click and mine and click Extract Here, so I suppose you could highlight a bunch then right click :)
