2010-08-04T23:37:00.000Z	rallias	jhattara	why is it asking you to update bookmarks? Did you install xmarks?
2010-08-04T23:40:00.000Z	jhattara	rallias	i just installed FF3.6 from repository (package "firefox") after my FF3.5 ("firefox-3.5") started acting funny
2010-08-04T23:40:00.000Z	rallias	jhattara	I don't know why it is doing that.
