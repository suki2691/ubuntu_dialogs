2007-07-18T13:25:00.000Z	Goc_		When I run Ubuntu from the LiveCD, it runs so incredibly slooooow, that the device manager takes 3 minutes to load, and the System Monito seems to require so much that it just freezes. Any idea what might be wrong? It's a 2.2 Ghz Celeron with 256 MB memory

2007-07-18T13:26:00.000Z	tupa	Goc_	the alternate CD is nice
2007-07-18T13:28:00.000Z	tupa	Goc_	yes, the alternate CD is better, I just did a fresh install yesterday with the same RAM but 3.0 GHZ P4
