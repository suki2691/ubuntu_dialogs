2005-04-23T06:25:00.000Z	hengx		Hey... I'm running Hoary, but after Hoary was released as final, I'm not getting any upgrades when doing sudo apt-get upgrade
2005-04-23T06:25:00.000Z	Burgundavia	hengx	hoary is now frozen. New stuff will not be coming into hoary, only security updates, of which there have been none yet
2005-04-23T06:26:00.000Z	hengx	Burgundavia	uh.. ok. Because after upgrading, CrossOver fails to work... So I hoped for some update
2005-04-23T06:27:00.000Z	Burgundavia	hengx	hmm what sort of errors?
