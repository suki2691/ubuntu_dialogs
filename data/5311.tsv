2012-05-27T02:50:00.000Z	x3no		Hello. i am experimenting with a dd command to put zero bytes on all the sectors my ecternal HDD has. However, after writing my password in the terminal it shows absolutely nothing. Is the zero-byte-writing in progress or i am doing something wrong?

2012-05-27T02:51:00.000Z	L3top	x3no	unless you did something wrong
2012-05-27T02:53:00.000Z	x3no	L3top	did not know that zero byting takes so much time :/
