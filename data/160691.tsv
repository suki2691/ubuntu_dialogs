2007-07-19T16:05:00.000Z	TheRiddler		Hey All, I just Installed Linux, it Auto-Updated, then I installed some more stuff, can I still upgrade?  If so, how?
2007-07-19T16:06:00.000Z	TheRiddler		Hmm, Ubuntu 6.06 to be more specific
2007-07-19T16:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	TheRiddler	And you want to upgrade to Feisty?
2007-07-19T16:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	TheRiddler	I would, but if it's a new install it might be faster to just install Feisty rather than update to edgy then feisty
