2007-06-14T15:51:00.000Z	yagami		I can't connect to vnc server on a windows box on my network. how come? i've created an exception rule in the firewall thingy in windows.
2007-06-14T15:52:00.000Z	yagami		do i need to make any changes in linux iptables/firewall?
2007-06-14T15:52:00.000Z	snoops	yagami	my suggestion would be to remove any possible conflicting/firewall stuff - as in disable it completely on windows, not just set a rule
2007-06-14T15:53:00.000Z	yagami	snoops	yeah, i know what you mean- but if i do that, ICS gets messed up- i know, it aint our bleedin' problem :P
