2007-05-09T10:58:00.000Z	johnficc1		I'm having a problem with my metacity top window borders I installed a mac like one and know when I switch to diffrent ones they are all very small on top?
2007-05-09T10:59:00.000Z	johnficc1		has anyone ever have this problem before?
2007-05-09T11:00:00.000Z	nickrud	johnficc1	you could look at the metacity keys in gconf-editor, maybe the font is extra tiny
2007-05-09T11:01:00.000Z	nickrud	johnficc1	/apps/metacity, one of those folders
