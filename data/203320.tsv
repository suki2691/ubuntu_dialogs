2007-02-19T14:56:00.000Z	llama32		i've been using pppconfig/pon for dialup; is there a way to see the connection speed?
2007-02-19T14:57:00.000Z	coNP	llama32	maybe if you write ifconfig ppp0 in a terminal window
2007-02-19T14:58:00.000Z	llama32	coNP	nah, tried that
2007-02-19T15:00:00.000Z	coNP	llama32	did that work?
