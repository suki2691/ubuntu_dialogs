2012-03-11T17:22:00.000Z	Mikero		Hi. Is there a general conventions or rule on where to install applications (like Program Files on Windows)?
2012-03-11T17:22:00.000Z	__Alex_	Mikero	yes, there is: /usr/local/bin
2012-03-11T17:24:00.000Z	__Alex_	Mikero	But if you want to manually install a script or somthing, put it in /usr/local/bin. You must do this as root, and you must make it executable
2012-03-11T17:25:00.000Z	__Alex_	Mikero	Is there a "Makefile"?
