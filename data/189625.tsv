2006-07-16T08:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	baxter_kylie	 i dont think it works that way
2006-07-16T08:08:00.000Z	baxter_kylie	dr_willis	No? Cripes. A friend of mine has done this on his gentoo installation and without xinerama.
2006-07-16T08:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	baxter_kylie	 hmm.. not sure how hes doing it then.
