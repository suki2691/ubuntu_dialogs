2012-05-30T01:45:00.000Z	Okeanos		I have age of Mythology but don't have a graphics card, so i tried to bypass this, by using 3d analyzer, this seemed to have worked, however, after the loading screen, the screen just went black showing the cursor, and still had sound. I hoped someone could help me with this?
2012-05-30T01:47:00.000Z	Okeanos		apparently several people have managed to use age of mythololgy without a graphics card, so i was trying to follow their example
2012-05-30T01:49:00.000Z	Okeanos		well apparently many people have managed to download some sort of 3d processor
2012-05-30T01:50:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Okeanos	 is it in wine?
