2007-04-09T14:55:00.000Z	preaction	d0lph1n	why do you need it? http://kernel.org
2007-04-09T14:57:00.000Z	preaction	d0lph1n	1) ask before pm. 2) http://kernel.org is the place to get current linux kernel sources. apt-cache search linux kernel & apt-get source might help with the ubuntu-specific configurations of it
