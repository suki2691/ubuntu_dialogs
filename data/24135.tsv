2011-01-16T02:15:00.000Z	carson		Im trying to install ubuntu 10.10 onto an old computer, but everytime i install it stops installing. it doesent crash, its not frozen, it just ends up taking an hour and the loading bar doesent move. its also at the same part of the loading bar <about 4 fiths of the way> at the "Who Are You?" page of installation were u enter your name and username and password, does anyone know whats the problem?
2011-01-16T02:16:00.000Z	KM0201	carson	what are the specs of the "old compute"
2011-01-16T02:20:00.000Z	KM0201	carson	512mb of ram might be your hang up, that is bare minimum for a live cd
2011-01-16T02:21:00.000Z	KM0201	carson	i'd use the 10.10 alt. install cd
