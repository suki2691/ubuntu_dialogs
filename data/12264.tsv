2012-04-28T00:26:00.000Z	zykotick9	steveccc	are you comforable with vi?  do you want a gui app?
2012-04-28T00:27:00.000Z	zykotick9	steveccc	nano is more popular then vi 'round here.  i know of no tool to edit /etc/fstab (doesn't really need one ;)
2012-04-28T00:28:00.000Z	steveccc	zykotick9	yes fine with vi - have always done it that way
