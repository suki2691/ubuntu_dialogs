2012-06-26T22:00:00.000Z	khaki		i screwed up installing roundcube, and removed it because i didnt have it setup the database.  now when i reinstall it, it dont ask me the inital questions it did the first time i installed it.  How can i make it act like i never installed it?
2012-06-26T22:01:00.000Z	khaki		i even did apt-get purge roundcube
2012-06-26T22:02:00.000Z	melkor	khaki	does apt have a reconfigure?
