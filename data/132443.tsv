2007-06-04T14:05:00.000Z	Nutubuntu		Also - can anyone point me to a tutorial, etc., on drive partitioning? I've currently got a partioning scheme that may be too complicated, with many separate partitions. I'd like to keep /home separate -- what else? advice very welcome; I'm a newbie to partitioning schemes. The new drive is 250GB.
