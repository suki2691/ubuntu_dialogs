2005-09-14T06:34:00.000Z	delltony		is there a way to bypass this? is the x.org messed up not sure where to go at this point
2005-09-14T06:34:00.000Z	fraser_	delltony	there is a way to bypass it. try webmin, can aslo be done with "update-rc.d" but i think webmin is easier
2005-09-14T06:35:00.000Z	fraser_	delltony	you can get webmin through "sudo apt-get install webmin" i think
