2006-04-19T14:35:00.000Z	pvd2006	robin	TO me personally, I think KDE has too much stuff that isn't needed, and for me it is slower than gnome.
2006-04-19T14:36:00.000Z	pvd2006	robin	but you can always install both and then run either one whenever you want to
2006-04-19T14:37:00.000Z	pvd2006	robin	I would just try both and see which one you like better.
