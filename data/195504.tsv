2009-04-30T20:09:00.000Z	RPS		Hello Guys, I've been using 8.10 since December and I just simply see no reason to switch back to WinBlows, but I do have a question. I just got prompted to install the 9.04 and I'm wondering how much work is required to get Jaunty running and get things stable? I mean will I have to reinstall things like VLC and go about redoing all my preferences? If that's the case I may need to postpone things until I have a few hours to get things
