2009-02-14T11:28:00.000Z	Doitle		I seem to be having a strange problem where my SATA harddrive does not show up at all in ubuntu, as in I try to say install Ubuntu to it or access it in Gparted and it is just not there...

2009-02-14T11:33:00.000Z	Doitle	nsadmin	any ideas how I could remedy that? Would it show up in the "hardware drivers" thing? It says I have no proprierary drivers.
