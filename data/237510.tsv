2010-06-17T03:10:00.000Z	lnostdal		or, rephrased; where the heck is the volume control applet in 10.04?
2010-06-17T03:11:00.000Z	lnostdal		hmmm..  "The volume control is clubbed with chat/email notification. This was done to save space on this valuable piece of screen real estate."   but this does _not_(!!) save space
