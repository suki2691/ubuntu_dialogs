2009-11-01T20:15:00.000Z	CNTLinux		Hi. Can I ask you guys a question? My headphones aren't working when I plug them in. I've checked alsamixer, the GUI, KMix, etc. When I plug them in halfway, there's a jolt of sound, but then silence.

2009-11-01T20:17:00.000Z	CNTLinux		...Care to give me some help?
