2011-02-05T04:48:00.000Z	Confused		 Hi, I am having a DVD playback problem.  Any experts in here who can help me a bit?
2011-02-05T04:50:00.000Z	Confused		After updating from 8.04 to 10.04, DVD's no longer playback.  I get a variety of error messages depending upon what application I am trying to use.  libdvdcss4 seems to be working all right.  I can see the generated keys.  There seems to be some other problem.
2011-02-05T04:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Confused	i'd reinstall the dvd codec package, it may help
2011-02-05T04:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Confused	do all players act the same?
