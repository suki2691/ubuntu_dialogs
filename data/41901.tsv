2010-01-27T21:15:00.000Z	oskar_		hi there! on my machine I have /home mounted from a nfs server. when i transfer a large file from a local directory to my home, the machine nearly freezes. do you have tips to avoid or improve this?

2010-01-27T21:18:00.000Z	oskar_	SpaceGhostC2C	yes, i could. but a regular, every-day, normal user could not or would not want to. i think, we need another approach... thanks anyway
