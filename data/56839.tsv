2009-06-07T08:22:00.000Z	commaCamel		so I'm experienceing a dvd mounting problem that I have been searching the web for hours trying to find a solution....anyone know why a dvd will not mount, but a cd will?
2009-06-07T08:24:00.000Z	Unislash	commaCamel	it's possible that installing the ubuntu-restricted-extras package may help...
2009-06-07T08:31:00.000Z	Unislash	commaCamel	have you tried installing the restricted drivers? it may help...
2009-06-07T08:31:00.000Z	commaCamel	Unislash	i just did yes
