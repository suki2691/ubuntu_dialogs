I'm trying to backup some of my system on to a acomdata external hard drive, but when I try to put a file of it, it says that I do not have permissions to write to it.  When I try to change the permissions, it says it is a read only disk.  I have used this drive to back things up before, so I know it is not read only.  What could cause this?
