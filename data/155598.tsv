2006-12-06T16:35:00.000Z	dxdt	psychad	huh?
2006-12-06T16:36:00.000Z	psychad	dxdt	i'm asking the quasi-philosophical question "is a console the same thing as a terminal?"
2006-12-06T16:37:00.000Z	dxdt	psychad	In response to someone asking how to get to one, probably not.  I think there is one, but off the top of my head, I honestly can't even think of a function that I have to do in console that I can't do with gnome-terminal..
