2008-06-10T06:07:00.000Z	maestrojed	danbhfive	I have, its permissions are 777 and is owned by root.  I tried changing it to 0440 but I can't because I am not root (and now it becomes circular)
2008-06-10T06:07:00.000Z	danbhfive	maestrojed	start in recovery mode
2008-06-10T06:08:00.000Z	danbhfive	maestrojed	another option is to do a clean install.  If you run into more problems, I would do a clean install...
