2009-10-31T18:25:00.000Z	BlouBlou	emma	because people normally hates pidgin, and Canonical changes to another one... what is better, yes, but *new* version, don't change by old version, it hasn't got anything :s
2009-10-31T18:26:00.000Z	emma	BlouBlou	yeah that's a bummer. OTR is good technology to be in a messenger.
