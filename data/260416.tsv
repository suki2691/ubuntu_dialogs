2004-11-20T13:57:00.000Z	Witigonen		There any way to modify what each mouse button does in gnome like in kde?
2004-11-20T13:57:00.000Z	crimsun	Witigonen	you can switch the mouse buttons easily. Are you looking to customize beyond that?
2004-11-20T13:59:00.000Z	Witigonen	crimsun	yeah.  I'd like my middle mouse button to do something and also the fourth/fifth mouse buttons to emulate the middle-button.
