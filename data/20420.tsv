2011-01-15T08:01:00.000Z	OvermindDL1		Greetings, I have a bit of an odd issue.  I have Ubuntu 10.10 installed, and I SSH in, start x11vnc, and vnc in over an ssh tunnel.  It works fine for some-odd period of time, and, even when doing nothing, the vnc connection drops, reports "caught XIO error:" then "14/01/2011 18:57:13 deleted 60 tile_row polling images.", then closes itself, then about one second later the ssh connection loses connection
