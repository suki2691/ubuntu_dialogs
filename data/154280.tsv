2007-02-16T15:35:00.000Z	jens		hello, I'm a student of the uni of gent (belgium) and we got the permission to install ubuntu on some uni pc's. We would like to use fai to do this, but we dont really know how to correctly set this up. Is there anybody here who could help us? or tell me where I could get help? thx
