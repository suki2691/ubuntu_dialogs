2005-06-09T14:34:00.000Z	lixoo		hi all - any advice on uninstalling Gnome (like should I do it?). I've got XFCE up and running and can't see me using Gnome again (although keeping some of the gnome apps would be nice)
2005-06-09T14:35:00.000Z	lixoo		i'm a bit tight on space. Surely if I leave GTK installed the Gnome apps wills till be able to run?

2005-06-09T14:36:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	lixoo	the same thing with kde & gnome, you can use kde apps in gnome when you have the kde libraries
