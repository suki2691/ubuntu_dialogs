2006-09-01T07:30:00.000Z	nozorro	ocelot_	the 'build' subdirectory seems out of place, i.e. somehow the installation got it wrong. you did install from source, didn't you
2006-09-01T07:30:00.000Z	ocelot_	nozorro	yes I did
2006-09-01T07:30:00.000Z	nozorro	ocelot_	which was the installation directory you specified?
