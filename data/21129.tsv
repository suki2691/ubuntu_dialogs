2010-12-30T19:18:00.000Z	Anoria		so, I'm a complete newbie ubuntu user and am liable to ask stupid questions. my first one is, is there any way to change the default size of all new program windows to something that fits on my 600-pixel-tall screen?
2010-12-30T19:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	Anoria	 some apps are badly written and hate 'short' screens.  a trick is to hold down  the 'alt key' and click in the window then drag it up/down so you can get to controlls past the bottom of the screen
2010-12-30T19:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_		I recll that 'wesnoth' was very bad at working with short displays. :(
2010-12-30T19:20:00.000Z	Anoria	Dr_Willis_	and red2kic:  thank you both :) I'm not skilled enough to do most things in terminal yet, but it's a goal for me.
