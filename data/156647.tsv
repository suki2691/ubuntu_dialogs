2007-10-14T14:01:00.000Z	riotkittie	xion	open a terminal and type sudo apt-get install libdvdcss
2007-10-14T14:02:00.000Z	riotkittie	xion	or search for it in synaptic
2007-10-14T14:03:00.000Z	riotkittie	xion	if you cant find it in synaptic, the term wont yield better results. synaptic is a front end for apt
