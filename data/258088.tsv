2005-12-15T09:15:00.000Z	Xenguy	dido`	I *thought* that 2Gb was sufficient for a basic install (double-check that with others tho)
2005-12-15T09:16:00.000Z	dido`	oblib	but what about desktop?
2005-12-15T09:17:00.000Z	Xenguy	dido`	what oblib said - you can do a server install, and then apt-get a light desktop like xfce4 for example
