2007-10-05T08:17:00.000Z	mzuverink	Dr_willis	I waited 15 min first for help, even flagged several employees down and they all said they would be with me in minutes, I got impatient, I only had a few minutes, it too bad, I had 3 grand to spend.  Then of course I had to explain the live cd concept to them
