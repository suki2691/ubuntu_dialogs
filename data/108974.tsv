2011-01-03T02:27:00.000Z	kody		okay so I installed thunar, and instead of keeping nautilus and just using the script that changes thunar to the default file manager, I simply uninstalled nautilus, which was a stupid idea.
2011-01-03T02:28:00.000Z	kody		not because I need nautilus, but now my file associations are screwed up in firefox when I try to "open folder location" from the downloads window
2011-01-03T02:28:00.000Z	kody		any idea how I could fix this?
2011-01-03T02:29:00.000Z	iDope	kody	wouldnt reinstalling nautilus and running the script fix it?
