2006-11-03T06:15:00.000Z	Legendre		I have a question about GDM - where does GDM store user session selections? Like, when you set your default login session..
2006-11-03T06:15:00.000Z	jorgp	Legendre	$HOME/.gnome?
2006-11-03T06:16:00.000Z	Legendre	jorgp	- possibly.. I was looking for a .gdm, but it might be under .gnome
2006-11-03T06:19:00.000Z	jorgp	Legendre	or .gnome2
