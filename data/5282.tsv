2012-07-15T09:18:00.000Z	oscarvarto		I just installed Ubuntu 12.04 and after a reboot the login window doesn't recognize my password. What can I do?
2012-07-15T09:20:00.000Z	oscarvarto		it's the first reboot
2012-07-15T09:20:00.000Z	L3top	oscarvarto	try caps lock. Perhaps you had it on when creating/confirming
2012-07-15T09:21:00.000Z	L3top	oscarvarto	ctrl alt f2 and try and log in.
