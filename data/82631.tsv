2012-01-21T03:31:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha		Hello, I've been trying to allow myself to run an program without sudo, I've tried using the visudo file and inputing the line "username ALL = (root) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/program" where username is my username and program is the program, yet I still have sudo asking me for a password.
2012-01-21T03:32:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha		Could anyone tell me why?
2012-01-21T03:32:00.000Z	JosephHarrietha		Its one program. I know what Im doing. Trust me.
