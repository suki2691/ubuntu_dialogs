2007-02-11T06:53:00.000Z	pwnguin	renchic	it sometimes takes a while for the partitioning tool to load
2007-02-11T06:55:00.000Z	renchic	pwnguin	how long should i wait before i give up? it has loaded past 100% (where it shows the progress bar) but once that closes all im left with is the mostly grey window and the "working" cursor
2007-02-11T06:55:00.000Z	pwnguin	renchic	is the cd or hard drive still going loudly?
