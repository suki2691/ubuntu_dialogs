2006-06-02T16:00:00.000Z	nk|bambi		the problem is, that drapper did not detect my wlancard without ndiswrapper-utils, so i installed the package and used the driver i even used yesterday (copied WG311v3.INF and WG311v3.sys to my home folder and installed them saying ndiswrapper -i WG311v3.INF)
2006-06-02T16:00:00.000Z	nk|bambi		then it gave out two small notes "Forcing AdhocMode|1 to AdhocMode|0"
2006-06-02T16:00:00.000Z	nk|bambi		and the driver seems invalid for him
2006-06-02T16:00:00.000Z	cyne	nk|bambi	is that a pcmcia card?
