2005-09-02T08:09:00.000Z	xeonaphobe		righty! I'll try that again...the problem I'm having is that I get no sound what so ever. I've followed the solution on the ubuntu FAQ page involving esd.conf
2005-09-02T08:10:00.000Z	xeonaphobe		i'm running a soundblaster 1024 and ubuntu does seem to recognise it
2005-09-02T08:11:00.000Z	xeonaphobe		hm no luck :(
