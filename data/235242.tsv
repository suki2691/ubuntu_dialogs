2005-08-02T08:09:00.000Z	Xyc0		I need help setting up my soundcard.  It is detected, but when I try test sounds I hear nothing.  everything in alsamixer is unmuted and full volume.
2005-08-02T08:10:00.000Z	Xyc0		it is a laptop
2005-08-02T08:11:00.000Z	kahuna_	Xyc0	do you have a function key for speaker volume? Check that first
2005-08-02T08:11:00.000Z	Xyc0	kahuna_	I played around with them to make sure I didn't accidently mute them, no luck
