2010-06-12T14:33:00.000Z	gintonic		I just installed lucid on a drive with a GUID partition table. /boot is marked as an EFI System partition. grub-install warns about using blocklists, but i'm not sure how grub2 was setup  in the first place. Is it ok to --force?

2010-06-12T14:34:00.000Z	gintonic	Jordan_U	BIOS.
