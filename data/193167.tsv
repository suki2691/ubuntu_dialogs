2006-11-04T08:51:00.000Z	drivera90		I have a DSL modem with both a USB cable and an Ethernet cable. I have closed source drivers for the USB, but they're .rpm and the instructions are for Mandrake and Red Hat.
2006-11-04T08:51:00.000Z	drivera90		I plugged in the Ethernet cable, but I don't know how to get it working.
2006-11-04T08:51:00.000Z	drivera90		Anyone?
2006-11-04T08:52:00.000Z	ephesius	drivera90	so you basically need to install the rpm?
