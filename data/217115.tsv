2006-05-06T07:04:00.000Z	Spitty		i have a question about filing a bug- I have a massive syslog to attach to the bug; is there a better way to connect it with the bug other than just putting the whole thing in the bug report?

2006-05-06T07:13:00.000Z	_jason	Spitty	after you file it, make an attachment
