2010-06-12T17:12:00.000Z	MasterZuFu		Can someone please tell me how to figure out what time my ubuntu 10.04 server is running at? #ubuntu-server isn't responding to my question.
2010-06-12T17:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MasterZuFu	how do you mean "what time"  do you want the system time, or do you want up time?
2010-06-12T17:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MasterZuFu	then run: time    will tell you the time
