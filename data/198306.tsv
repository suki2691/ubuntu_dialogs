2006-02-22T10:48:00.000Z	Cwiiis		It seems the nvidia module is missing for me in dapper amd64 (kernel 2.6.15) - Anyone know anything about this?
2006-02-22T10:48:00.000Z	ablomen	Cwiiis	it is installed but it doesnt work out of the box, have the same problem here, dont know how to fix it, will be kinda hard
2006-02-22T10:50:00.000Z	Cwiiis	ablomen	Is there a bug report about it? And do you know if an earlier kernel works?
2006-02-22T10:51:00.000Z	ablomen	Cwiiis	after the update to dapper i didnt get it to work, with older kernels 2, ithinks its just a matter of waiting till theres a update for it
