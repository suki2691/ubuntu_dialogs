2008-01-08T02:32:00.000Z	tarelerulz	Flare183	how would I get around that . I have heard of extended partition and logical partition ,but I really don't understand how they work in relating to my problem.  If you say make an extended partition can you feather break that ,but with out running into 4 partition limit ?
