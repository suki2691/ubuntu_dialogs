2011-01-16T20:03:00.000Z	Fizix		Greetings. I'm fairly new to Ubuntu (and Linux in genera) and after trolling the forums for some time to no avail, I thought I'd come here.
2011-01-16T20:04:00.000Z	Fizix		My question is this: I've added a command ADB to bashrc in both my directory as well as /root. I can access adb now via the terminal, but I can't "sudo adb" as it cannot find it. Any help?
2011-01-16T20:06:00.000Z	yeats	Fizix	I don't think sudo accesses root's bashrc...  (may be wrong though)
2011-01-16T20:07:00.000Z	yeats	Fizix	what Slimcea_boy suggests will probably work
