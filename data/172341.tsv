2010-09-15T13:46:00.000Z	Zircon_X		I'm going to be installing Ubuntu server as an IRC server on a P IV box with a gig of RAM...would I still be able to use this box as a desktop PC? I'll mostly be web browsing and listening to music (And obviously IRC)
2010-09-15T13:46:00.000Z	Zircon_X		Should I be ok with that?
