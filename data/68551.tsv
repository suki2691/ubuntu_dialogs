2009-01-21T02:43:00.000Z	Krstnsn		is a process called "mount.ntfs" because im running wubi?
2009-01-21T02:44:00.000Z	AbtZ	Krstnsn	seems likely
2009-01-21T02:48:00.000Z	AbtZ	Krstnsn	that seems a bit much. what kind of cpu do you have?
2009-01-21T02:51:00.000Z	AbtZ	Krstnsn	i dont use wubi, so i dont know how effective it is... but it doesnt seem right to me. try killing the process and see what happens. :)
