2007-11-25T10:15:00.000Z	Cpudan80		Hello all
2007-11-25T10:16:00.000Z	Cpudan80		I need some help with my fstab file -- currently I have a FAT32 partition mounted, but nobody (not even root) can write to the partition
2007-11-25T10:16:00.000Z	Cpudan80		How can I change the fstab file so that at least root can write to the partition ?
2007-11-25T10:17:00.000Z	_nix_	Cpudan80	that partition is probably mounted read-only
