2010-03-14T00:31:00.000Z	VCoolio	HowardtheDuck	you don't, it should work by default in gnome
2010-03-14T04:48:00.000Z	VCoolio	HowardtheDuck	gnome-open rather; for xdg-open use (g)alternives to configure associations
2010-03-14T04:50:00.000Z	VCoolio	HowardtheDuck	you need to 'gnome-open something', not use it as standalone; it's default on ubuntu, you should have it
