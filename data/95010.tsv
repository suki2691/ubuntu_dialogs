2009-12-21T08:26:00.000Z	Ali_nz		My Ubuntu system would not boot because of no free disk space, so I booted a live CD and deleted one file of no great importance. Now I get a black screen and flashing cursor after the ubuntu logo - help please!
2009-12-21T08:27:00.000Z	Ali_nz		or .raw? it was a ddrescue file
2009-12-21T08:28:00.000Z	Ali_nz		but haveing just typed that it finally sprung into life....maybe it was re indexing the FS or soemthing?
