2008-04-02T16:49:00.000Z	theunixgeek	ricanelite	and there's almost 100 people on #vbox who could help you
2008-04-02T16:54:00.000Z	theunixgeek	ricanelite	personally, I'd go with vmware server
2008-04-02T16:54:00.000Z	theunixgeek	ricanelite	it's free and for memory it makes a file instead of actually using your system memory, so if you want 800 MB ram, make sure you have 800 MB free on your hd
