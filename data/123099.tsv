2008-03-06T19:36:00.000Z	WinXpNewb		Hi, just a quick question: Anyone here have any experience with giving/spreading cds? Any advise?
2008-03-06T19:36:00.000Z	Strawberryjam	WinXpNewb	are they legal?
2008-03-06T19:38:00.000Z	WinXpNewb	Strawberryjam	Yep. Mostly related to Ron Paul DvD available on Ron Paul Audio but technically I'm also considering it for Linux distro on a later date. Didn't find people who knew in the Ron Paul channel so thought I'd stretch the question here where more people might know
2008-03-06T19:39:00.000Z	Strawberryjam	WinXpNewb	I guess find a distributor with a good heart is a start
