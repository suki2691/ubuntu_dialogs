2009-03-03T15:27:00.000Z	Frantic	ActionParsnip	I have seen those but didn't help, my problem is that grub doesn't recognize my boot partition which is a ext3 fs on a raid1 volume
2009-03-03T15:28:00.000Z	Frantic	ActionParsnip	for example, find /grub/menu.lst returns file not found :(
2009-03-03T15:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Frantic	im unsure, i always use harware raid
