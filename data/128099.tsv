2010-09-10T19:42:00.000Z	mbeierl	lucenut_	do you mean you have a proxy server already and you want to change your ubunutu computer to point to it, or you want to install proxy server software on your ubuntu?
2010-09-10T19:43:00.000Z	mbeierl	lucenut_	no.  I don't know of free overseas proxies
2010-09-10T19:43:00.000Z	mbeierl	lucenut_	system -> preferences -> Network Proxy
