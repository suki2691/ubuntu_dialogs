2012-06-14T16:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	SDX	pulse requires alsa - they aren't the same thing at all.  pulse replaces esd
2012-06-17T17:55:00.000Z	zykotick9	SDX	is reinstall actually an option for your apt-get?  it isn't for mine?
2012-06-17T17:57:00.000Z	zykotick9	SDX	"apt-get install --reinstall foo" for apt-get
