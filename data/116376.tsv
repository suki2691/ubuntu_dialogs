2008-06-06T11:35:00.000Z	shaft0r		Hey guys... installing ubuntu for the first time on a new server... centos saw the drives as hda, hdb... but ubuntu sees them as sda, sdb... why is that and could it cause a problem?
2008-06-06T11:36:00.000Z	Light-	shaft0r	its the new ubuntu naming scheme, shouldnt cause problems
2008-06-06T11:36:00.000Z	Light-	shaft0r	ubuntu decided to start calling all ide disks sd* for some reason
2008-06-06T11:40:00.000Z	Light-	shaft0r	probably
