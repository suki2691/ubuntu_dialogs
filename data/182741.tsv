2007-06-04T09:15:00.000Z	brohken		does anyone know how I can get a default xconf file to replace the one i changed?
2007-06-04T09:16:00.000Z	Pelo	brohken	  rename  xorg.conf~  that's the backup from your last edit
2007-06-04T09:18:00.000Z	Pelo	brohken	then ls to see the files available,    cp xorg.conf~ xorg.conf  will rename it
2007-08-19T16:05:00.000Z	Pelo	brohken	 then you need to use the binary
