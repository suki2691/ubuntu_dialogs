2006-08-23T06:10:00.000Z	longwave		can anyone recommend a simple way of doing a one-off mailshot to a few hundred email addresses?
2006-08-23T06:10:00.000Z	longwave		i've looked at mailman and all the other mailing list packages but they are pretty complex for what i need

2006-08-23T06:11:00.000Z	delire	longwave	right, so it doesn't mount at all..
