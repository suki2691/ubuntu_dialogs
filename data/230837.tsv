2005-09-07T08:40:00.000Z	wolki	Kyral	i get it most of the time, then i wait an hour and it might work... i wonder whether it's a local problem or their servers are overloaded. Very annoying is that metacity seems to crash each time it fails on breezy...
2005-09-07T08:42:00.000Z	wolki	Kyral	yeah, once i'm connected it stays for hours... bizzarre
