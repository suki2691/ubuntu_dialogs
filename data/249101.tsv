2005-07-05T16:08:00.000Z	ateves		hi, i wanted to compile SIM, but configure always tells me that the QT headers and libs cannot be found, but they are installed and up to date
2005-07-05T07:42:00.000Z	ateves		can i use KDE applications in gnome? e.g. amaroK player?
2005-07-05T07:42:00.000Z	chrissturm	ateves	sure
2005-07-05T07:43:00.000Z	chrissturm	ateves	some will look strange, but amarok looks quite ok
