2011-05-05T00:10:00.000Z	l403		Hi. I'd like to listen to Pink Floyd with my new headphones but I have the ubuntu sounds piercing my eardrum every time I click a button. I am using fluxbox and it doesnt seem to respect the gnome settings where the sound theme is disabled. What is responsible for the sounds and how can I kill them?
2011-05-05T00:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	l403	could uninstall the ubuntu-sounds package
2011-05-05T00:17:00.000Z	l403	ActionParsnip	I guess I have to log out and log back in to actually get rid of the sounds huh?
2011-05-05T00:20:00.000Z	l403	ActionParsnip	the ubuntu-sounds package is gone, I logged out and back in but the sound theme is still there
