2006-10-22T13:00:00.000Z	fbc		I need to repair damaged video files. Is there any program that will fix or normalize video files?
2006-10-22T13:00:00.000Z	JosefK	fbc	VLC can repair some video files
2006-10-22T13:01:00.000Z	fbc	JosefK	 How do you tell it to repair.? I've looked for tht option everywhere.
2006-10-22T13:01:00.000Z	JosefK	fbc	hmm, I've only seen it pop the option up when I open an obviously corrupt file, never tried to do it manually though, sorry :/
