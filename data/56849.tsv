2009-05-24T23:38:00.000Z	Link23		My screen is messed up, it shows a small portion of the screen and I have to move my mouse to the edge of the screen to be able to see other parts.
2009-05-24T23:39:00.000Z	Link23		Can somebody help?
2009-05-24T23:39:00.000Z	RHorse	Link23	you'll get used to it
2009-05-24T23:40:00.000Z	Link23	RHorse	I don't think I will get used to it because my chat window takes up the whole screen right now and I can't see the bottom task bar but when I move my mouse to the bottom edge it scrolls down so I can see it.
