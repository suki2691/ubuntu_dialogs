2012-01-17T13:02:00.000Z	alvarezp		I can't get any audio out of parec (pulseaudio). How can I check if everything is ok with PA and ALSA?
2012-01-17T13:04:00.000Z	almoxarife	alvarezp	sound preferences menu has a audio check option
2012-01-17T13:04:00.000Z	alvarezp	almoxarife	oh, forgot to mention. Output is ok. Input is the problem I'm having.
2012-01-17T13:05:00.000Z	alvarezp	almoxarife	I didn't get anything from Audacity so I tried parec which records nothing.
