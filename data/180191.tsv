2008-09-28T05:21:00.000Z	rraj_be		sure
2008-09-28T05:21:00.000Z	jrib	rraj_be	you need to upgrade to 8.04 first (see ubottu's message).  8.10 (intrepid at the moment) is still being developed.  It is for testing only.  If after you get to 8.04 you think you still want to use intrepid, then see the topic in this channel
2008-09-28T05:25:00.000Z	jrib	rraj_be	ok, so you know what to do then, right?
