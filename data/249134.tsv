2010-08-07T04:49:00.000Z	Again617		HI, I'm getting a popup telling me I have 486 MB free on my home folder but Nautilus tells me that I have 40 GB free
2010-08-07T04:50:00.000Z	Again617		the command df -h tells me that the partition is 55% full
2010-08-07T04:50:00.000Z	Again617		so I am wondering why I would get the error telling m that my drive is almost full?
2010-08-07T04:50:00.000Z	cast	Again617	is 45% 40GB or 486MB
