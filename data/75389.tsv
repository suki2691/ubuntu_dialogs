2010-03-04T09:59:00.000Z	anom01y		anyone know if I should use EXT3 or EXT4 ?
2010-03-04T09:59:00.000Z	anom01y		what is better and why ?
2010-03-04T10:00:00.000Z	Out_Cold	anom01y	ext4 is the standard in releases newer than 9.10 and it is newer, so some bugs are fixed and new ones emerged
2010-03-04T10:01:00.000Z	Out_Cold	anom01y	unless you are a hard power user you probably would never notice the difference
