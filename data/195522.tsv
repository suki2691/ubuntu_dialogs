2007-01-05T07:36:00.000Z	FurryNemesis	daniel1988	I'm using XGL as a workaround, thing is our GeForce 4 cards are actually revamped GeForce 2's which don't accept those drivers - Toshiba kept that one unser their hats
2007-01-05T07:37:00.000Z	kitche	FurryNemesis	well considering that GeForce2 is still supported with the nvidia drivers and not the legacy drivers I would use the nvidia drivers and not their legacy ones
2007-01-05T07:38:00.000Z	kitche	FurryNemesis	but I know what you mean I have a Geforce2 mx440 and they aren't exactly geforce 2's
