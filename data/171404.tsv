2012-01-24T21:39:00.000Z	wad		Wow, I'm scared! My Ubuntu desktop wants me to update the kernel to 3.0.0.... is this a good idea to do it right now, or should I let it bake for a month or so first?
2012-01-24T21:41:00.000Z	wad		Oh, so it's not really a major version number, just a labeling thing, mostly. Got it.
2012-01-24T21:41:00.000Z	wad		Okay, I'll update.
