2008-05-18T15:09:00.000Z	Pingviller		ok, I managed to partition my new installation of linux mint a bit wrong... I meant to give 5 GB for the linux system files, and 50 GB for my user folder and 2.5 GB to my swap... but my home directory is on the linux system part, and /media/disk ended up with all the space... how do I edit fstab to make it right? I copy the files from /home/myuser to /media/disk and then edit fstab to mount the big partition to /home ?
