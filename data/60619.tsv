2010-01-09T18:40:00.000Z	thinkl1		My system has been compromised, so I guess I need to reinstall as the surest way to recover. Any advice on the best way to get my system set up exactly how I have it now (e.g. recover configuration files and reinstall all the same packages)?

2010-01-09T18:42:00.000Z	thinkl1	nibbler	Well, I don't want to e.g. go through hell getting X configured again... perhaps it would be best just to back up and then I can pull back things as I need them?
