2007-07-21T15:59:00.000Z	EvilBro		HEp85: another question, if you don't mind, I recently installed pidgin from source. am I correct in assuming that a repository update might break pidgin due to a necessary library being replaced by another version? (probably a small change)
2007-07-21T16:00:00.000Z	EvilBro		chance... not change
2007-07-21T16:01:00.000Z	PriceChild	EvilBro	i doubt it... but if it does then your fault and you can fix it? :)
2007-07-21T16:01:00.000Z	EvilBro	PriceChild	whether I can is not the issue... I'm going to have to be able to I think. :)
