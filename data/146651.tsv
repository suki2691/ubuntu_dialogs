2011-11-07T04:39:00.000Z	TimothyA		can someone directly link me to the zip package for the zip command in ubuntu?
2011-11-07T04:40:00.000Z	TimothyA		apt-get is downloading it at 0.001kb/s for some reason
2011-11-07T04:41:00.000Z	TimothyA		ffs, everything always has to break at the worst time
2011-11-07T04:41:00.000Z	matlock	TimothyA	actually, i am of the belief now that ubuntu just likes to be broken and no one knows how to fix it
