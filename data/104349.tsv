2008-07-26T21:29:00.000Z	OasisGames		Alrighty, having some major nVidia problems here. I have an old GeForce2, which I have been informed by my colleagues satisfies the graphical requirements to do my work on (Compiz). But I'm having serious issues getting the drivers to work.
2008-07-26T21:29:00.000Z	OasisGames		I've tried both a direct install from nVidia's website and installing from the Ubuntu restricted drivers manager (after a complete reinstall, this is a "new" machine so it didn't matter). Both worked to a point - I could start X. However, any attempts to run gdm resulted in a crash.
