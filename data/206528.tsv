2005-12-18T06:39:00.000Z	MMond		I've a ridiculously stupid question.. how do I shut down the computer in CLI? "shutdown now" doesn't entirely work
2005-12-18T06:40:00.000Z	MMond		And all of these things should be "safe" to do?
2005-12-18T06:40:00.000Z	sethk	MMond	you can do   shutdown -h now
2005-12-18T07:09:00.000Z	sethk	MMond	there are literally dozens of editors you can play with
