I had the problem in hardy also but had compiled with source.  but now in 9.04 i can't compile it because xmu is missing and there is no package called xmu

2009-07-17T15:26:00.000Z	kk_jaunti	legend2440	so sudo apt-get install libxmu-dev would do is it?
2009-07-17T15:27:00.000Z	legend2440	kk_jaunti	yes
