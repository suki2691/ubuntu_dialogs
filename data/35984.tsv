2010-03-10T13:40:00.000Z	Nielsen	hachouri	i tried once, a few years ago. Back then, i could only get it to broadcast all printers to both subnets.
2010-03-10T13:41:00.000Z	hachouri	Nielsen	do you think that this possible now with new version?
2010-03-10T13:42:00.000Z	Nielsen	hachouri	i never tried.
