2005-04-20T15:06:00.000Z	pere		Hi. Tried upgrading to hoary, by changing the name of the repositories in synaptic. Now I can only run Gnome in SafeMode, and it actually seems to have uninstalled synaptic. Any ideas?

2005-04-20T15:07:00.000Z	daven	pere	type /searchTerm to search
2005-04-20T15:07:00.000Z	daven	pere	for instance /gcc
