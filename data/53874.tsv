2010-07-12T20:19:00.000Z	stongo		can someone tell me if ubuntu 10.04 64-bit is as stable as the 32-bit v?
2010-07-12T20:20:00.000Z	markben	stongo	 I've been running 10.04 64-bit on my laptop since a few days after it came out and it's been very stable.
2010-07-12T20:20:00.000Z	markben	stongo	I run 10.04 32-bit on my desktop and haven't noticed any difference between the two in stability or otherwise.
