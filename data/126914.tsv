2007-07-26T08:27:00.000Z	checkers		hi all, what's the difference between "kubuntu-7.04-alternate-i386.iso" and "kubuntu-7.04-desktop-i386.iso"?
2007-07-26T08:27:00.000Z	n2diy	checkers	alternate is a cli install, and desktop is a gui install.
2007-07-26T08:34:00.000Z	checkers	n2diy	I was referring to the fact that you *dont* need to boot into a whole linux OS off the CD before you can install it
2007-07-26T08:34:00.000Z	n2diy	checkers	roger that. good luck.
