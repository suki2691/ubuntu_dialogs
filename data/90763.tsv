2010-05-16T06:14:00.000Z	SwedeMike	moekim1234	why are you installing 9.04 ?
2010-05-16T06:17:00.000Z	SwedeMike	moekim1234	unlikely anyone will help you with an old ubuntu release like that when it's most likely fixed in a later release.
2010-05-16T06:18:00.000Z	SwedeMike	moekim1234	that seems to be not working, so the advice is to do a fresh install of 10.04 instead.
