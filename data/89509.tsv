2010-03-29T17:30:00.000Z	Emry		I have a quick question.  I am downloading the beta.  When the relase comes out, what is the suggested way to upgrade from beta to release? :)
2010-03-29T17:31:00.000Z	jpds	Emry	Just upgrade as normal?
2010-03-29T17:31:00.000Z	Emry	jpds	:) I have never done an actual upgrade.  Always managed to get things at the right time to just do a fresh install. ehehehe ^_^
2010-03-29T17:32:00.000Z	jpds	Emry	System → Admin → Update Manager - should do it.
