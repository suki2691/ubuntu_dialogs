The issues are that sometimes (mostly) when I type a folder name and then hit enter and now I'm inside another folder but the same typed text still appears in the little textbox.

2011-11-02T20:42:00.000Z	hrolf	Spartakus	I think it is a bug (because that would a really absurd feature) when I type something and press Esc it should discard anything typed. But that isn't the case because after pressing Esc the textbox disappears but if you type something again the buffer is still there.
