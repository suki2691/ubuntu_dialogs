2010-04-03T16:13:00.000Z	Idlehead	maquetero-ppc	it is a matter of how you use them. small multi-touch notebooks can be pretty handy for scribbling or taking notes or signatures
2010-04-03T16:17:00.000Z	maquetero-ppc	Idlehead	maybe in few cases... in really small devices like phone or something like that. in computer is is not usefull just rise the prises
2010-04-03T16:18:00.000Z	Idlehead	maquetero-ppc	i have to disagree with that. for me, a tablet pc with multitouch and stylus support would be perfect for drawing (artist)
