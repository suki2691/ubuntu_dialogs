2012-04-22T00:47:00.000Z	escott	mirko2	try it. i absolutely can delete an immutable file. i can't modify it in place, but i can delete it
2012-04-22T00:48:00.000Z	escott	mirko2	unless i typoed somewhere
2012-04-22T00:49:00.000Z	escott	mirko2	nevermind, must have put a -i when i meant a +i when i was testing
