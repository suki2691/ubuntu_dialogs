2009-04-05T07:05:00.000Z	johni	techqbert	you might try to download and install moonlight and give it a shot
2009-04-05T07:06:00.000Z	johni	techqbert	I was able to pass the initial screen with unsupported screen by using Agent Switcher extension for Firefox; visited the site as ie7 on vista
2009-04-05T07:06:00.000Z	techqbert	johni	thanks for the heads up.  no luck there either.  moonlight, at least the one firefox thinks I want, is 1.0.  mono devs were talking about having 2.0 working on the site before the tournament is over
