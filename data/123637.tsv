2008-08-28T14:25:00.000Z	azrael_valedhel		hm... I've got a surprising error - the server is just installed, ubuntu feisty, and aptitude gives me: W: GPG error: http://security.ubuntu.com feisty-security Release: Unknown error - does it mean that I have to add gpg keys?
2008-08-28T14:26:00.000Z	Ziroday	azrael_valedhel	why are you running feisty?
2008-08-28T14:27:00.000Z	Ziroday	azrael_valedhel	Err, well I am not sure if feisty is even supported, the repos are probably closed. Lemme check
2008-08-28T14:27:00.000Z	Ziroday	azrael_valedhel	can you still get security updates even with that error?
