2009-10-30T17:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	unimatrix	you can reduce it, this is of great debate as drives get bigger, 5% becomes a substantial amount of data
2009-10-30T17:27:00.000Z	unimatrix	ActionParsnip1	but what if i set it to 0%? what do i lose?
2009-10-30T17:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	unimatrix	you will be using ext2 essentially
