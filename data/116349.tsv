2007-10-19T01:52:00.000Z	Klowner		Anyone know if there's a way to disable Compiz/Beryl from the command line? I'm attempting to connect to a remote machine using VNC, and it seems as though VNC doesn't update the client if desktop effects are running
2007-10-19T01:53:00.000Z	Klowner		thanks Rodya  and Brucevdk, I'll try those
2007-10-19T01:53:00.000Z	[Al]	Klowner	there's a #compiz-fusion channel on this server too
2007-10-19T01:53:00.000Z	Klowner	[Al]	ah ok, if this doesn't work I'll go hassle them :)
