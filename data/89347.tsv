2008-07-06T20:56:00.000Z	Rhorse	m-c	ok, so you mean do a sudo apt-get --reinstall install evolution?
2008-07-06T20:59:00.000Z	m-c	Rhorse	Is it not installed now?  Sounded like It was not.  Either way, yes, uninstall and re-install.
2008-07-06T21:00:00.000Z	Rhorse	m-c	well, it was processed up to the point of configuration, which it choked on. So it's *half-installed* you mite say 8 )
