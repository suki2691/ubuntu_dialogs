2011-02-25T22:43:00.000Z	iceroot	PCdoc	if you are not using samba or other daemoms for managing windows-clients, then you dont need it
2011-02-25T22:43:00.000Z	iceroot	PCdoc	there are no public viruses for debian stable
2011-02-25T22:44:00.000Z	iceroot	PCdoc	and a virus-scanner for linux is normally if you are using samba,dansguardian or a mailserver to protect connected windows-clients
