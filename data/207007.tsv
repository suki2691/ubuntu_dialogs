2006-06-13T09:13:00.000Z	phoghawk	distanceisdeath	you can change the file permissions
2006-06-13T09:13:00.000Z	phoghawk	distanceisdeath	type "sudo chmod 777 -R foldername"
2006-06-13T09:14:00.000Z	phoghawk	distanceisdeath	that will only change the permissions, then you'll still have to delete the things
