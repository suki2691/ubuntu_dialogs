2010-05-04T10:15:00.000Z	wers		for some super weird reason, i can't install Adobe Air with the .bin file. whenever i run the .bin, the output says that the file does not exist. i'm 100% sure that i entered the right file location
2010-05-04T10:15:00.000Z	wers		any idea/

2010-05-04T10:16:00.000Z	wers	YankDownUnder	i did that. it worked on another laptop but not here
