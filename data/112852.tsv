The update notifier was bugging me and when I blindly went to allow it to install all updates it prompts me about "NOT AUTHENTICATED" software.  The ones it is complaining about are capplets-data, libpanel-applet2-0, gnome-control-center, libgnome-windows-settings1, gnome-panel-date, and gnome-panel.   Is this safe?

2007-11-24T04:45:00.000Z	yotux		this should fix that auth error
