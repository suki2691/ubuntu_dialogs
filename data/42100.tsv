2010-09-05T07:09:00.000Z	sync3times	chris_osx	 you want to encrypt some files or run out of an encrypted filesystem?
2010-09-05T07:13:00.000Z	chris_osx		oh, so i have to reinstall everything? ok
2010-09-05T07:16:00.000Z	chris_osx	sync3times	i would like to have /home encrypted. so i guess i have to create a /home partition and have that encrypted on install right?
