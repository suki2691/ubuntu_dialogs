2010-08-21T23:54:00.000Z	Techathy		I'm usinhg on-board sound (Intel HDA/ RTL ALC888) & have very low line out signal levels despite the alsa sliders being on maximum. Is there any way to boost the line level produced by the card?

2010-08-21T23:55:00.000Z	Techathy	hotmonkeyluv	how does one do that on the command line?
