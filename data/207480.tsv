He is a fedora fan and says ubuntu stole fedoras theme and never gave them any credit. I don't know if this is true or not because I have yet to try fedora core. However, if this is true can anyone point me to some ubuntu credits page or something? To shut him up basically?

2006-10-04T14:25:00.000Z	harrism		I think ubuntu is great, I have nothing against it really
2006-10-04T14:25:00.000Z	oskude	harrism	let him first show the fedore(tm?) theme ?
