2007-09-27T06:44:00.000Z	Shadow_X		I have an external hard drive that came from my windows system. its fat32 and was really fragmented. windows hated trying to defrag it (surprise surprise). is there anyway I can defrag it in ubuntu?
2007-09-27T06:45:00.000Z	Shadow_X		yes, I understand linux prevents fragmentation, but the drive was fragmented before being moved to Linux

2007-09-27T06:45:00.000Z	peabody	Shadow_X	hey it works :).  I myself am unaware of any defrag utilities in Linux for fat32
