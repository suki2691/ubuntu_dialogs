2012-11-30T02:49:00.000Z	Kuwanger		I have a really odd problem.  My mouse pointer settings seem very inconsistent and I can't seem to change them to what I want.  For example, in Chromium the link hand pointer is from whiteglass but the regular pointer is from redglass.
2012-11-30T02:51:00.000Z	Kuwanger		So, in short, how do I go about configuring my mouse pointer to an installed theme?

2012-11-30T02:54:00.000Z	Kuwanger	dr_willis	Thanks.  I'll look there.
