2008-06-20T00:51:00.000Z	shadowimmage		I'm in GParted, and I want to copy one partition to another, without loss of the information, but GParted keeps mounting things automatically. I'm trying to make my linux installation larger, by absorbing an unused part of the disk.
2008-06-20T00:51:00.000Z	shadowimmage		help please!
