2008-05-26T16:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	mi2	afaik gnumeric does not support vba (visual basic for apps)
2008-05-26T16:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	mi2	i think it has some sort of limited support but i do not know much about it
2008-05-26T16:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	mi2	you can open xls files with both programs but vba macros...
