I have a 2nd drive that I have folders that MUST be shared off for my network (and I still have to install my linux version of filezilla server for my FTP)... How do I grant myself rights to share?
2008-08-10T02:14:00.000Z	qr_	ParaDoX34690	I presume you want to share with windows machines? You need to use samba to do that. If you want to share with other linux machines you should use NFS.
2008-08-10T02:16:00.000Z	ParaDoX34690	qr_	Well, I right click on the folder I want to share ("ISO Images"), and tell it to create share, but then it tells me that it returned error 255, and that I don't have permission to create a usershare...
2008-08-10T02:17:00.000Z	qr_	ParaDoX34690	I have no idea how to make shares using the GUI tools, sorry. Like I said, samba is what you need to share folders with windows. Try googling "ubuntu samba" or something similar, there should be instructions online on how to set up a share.
