2006-06-24T10:55:00.000Z	lamego		well, installing gcc is enough to compile a .c program :P
2006-06-24T10:56:00.000Z	tritium	lamego	he needs make, so gcc is insufficient
2006-06-24T10:56:00.000Z	lamego	tritium	but the error he got from configure was about compiling a .c file, not about missing make :)
