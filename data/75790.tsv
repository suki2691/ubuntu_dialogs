2008-12-24T23:34:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire1	energY	Rhythmbox does it fine, but you have to enable MTP support under plugins, And you have to install libmtp or something from synaptic, but dont quote me on the exact filename, but searching mtp should do it (sorry for sendin it twice, but most people look for the name highlights)
