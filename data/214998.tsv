2005-12-13T16:44:00.000Z	afd_		hi! I kind of screwed my firefox while trying to upgrade to firefox 1.5. My  configured apt repository doesn't work (is offline or something), where can I find a list of repositories and a sources.list file?
2005-12-13T07:10:00.000Z	afd_		http://pastebin.com/453942   <- can someone help me resolve this? I'm trying to upgrade to draper, but the dist-upgrade process was stopped by this error

2005-12-13T07:12:00.000Z	afd_	Jowi	yeah, I've just uninstalled it (together with some other stuff), and the upgrade process started again (by itself)
