2008-11-28T23:48:00.000Z	scunizi	norbert79	true.. but you can put the setting on "normal" which I believe is glx and not full blown compiz
2008-11-28T23:49:00.000Z	norbert79	scunizi	It's still compiz tough... I would rather find a way on loading GLX support... I really hate this new way on modifying the xorg.conf automatically...
2008-11-28T23:50:00.000Z	scunizi	norbert79	yea.. I just got use to editing xorg.conf and now have to learn xRandr..  arg
