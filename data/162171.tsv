2007-03-27T11:50:00.000Z	AaronCampbell		I just finished building a new system, and I'm trying to instll Feisty (Kubuntu).  I'm having problems with my bluetooth kb/mouse.  They worked during boot (to choose install, etc), but once it booted, If I press a key I get "KBlueToothD .... Not paired"
2007-03-27T11:51:00.000Z	foutrelis	AaronCampbell	Feisty is still BETA software. It should not be used for production environments. Please address your question to #ubuntu+1.
2007-03-27T11:53:00.000Z	AaronCampbell	foutrelis	Thanks.  I just saw no reason to go with 6.10 (or whatever) for a new system...if this will be out of beta within a month
2007-03-27T11:54:00.000Z	foutrelis	AaronCampbell	Yeah. Feisty's official release data is really close :P
