2008-12-12T22:48:00.000Z	vEyem		I hate to pushy, but incase my question was missed:Why does X skip over tty8 when allocation ttys for desktops?does any else notice this?
2008-12-12T22:50:00.000Z	Slart	vEyem	does X allocate the ttys? I thought that was handled by the base system
2008-12-12T22:51:00.000Z	vEyem	Slart	I think it is handle by gdm, to be specific.perhaps I should of mentioned that instead of X.
2008-12-12T22:53:00.000Z	Slart	vEyem	if that were the case, ubuntu server wouldn't have any ttys... since I doubt it has gdm
