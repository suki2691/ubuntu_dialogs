2009-03-15T22:11:00.000Z	Zeroyez		i can't figure out how to install grub, i use rescue mode of installer, then do grubinstall /dev/sdb and every time i boot it says "GRUB Loading stage1.5. GRUB loading, please wait... Error 17"
2009-03-15T22:12:00.000Z	Zeroyez		that is 100% unrelated
2009-03-15T22:12:00.000Z	Zeroyez		i did not install windows, i installed ubuntu on my 2nd hard drive
