2004-12-16T15:56:00.000Z	Triple|5	mjg59	thanks but in my past experience it works so slow =\ Beatrix (ubuntu's alternative is so fast because its optimized for slow cpus) but why Ubuntu's gnome is so slow? can I use like xfce4.2 or fluxbox or something , I've used other distros "Kanotix, Libranet, Debian, Yoper, Mepis, Beatrix" and they run fast
