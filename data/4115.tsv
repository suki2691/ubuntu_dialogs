2012-04-07T00:30:00.000Z	mirko1	Lukan27_	if you know how to mount an FS per CLI, do unmount it now and use nautilus (simply click on the FS in the Places list) then do what ever yo want to do. otherwise. if you're really sure you know what you are doing run "sudo su -" that will get you a full-blown root shell where you shoudl be able to do almost everything. (not advisable)
