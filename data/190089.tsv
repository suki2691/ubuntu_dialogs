2006-08-17T13:36:00.000Z	jaakkos		i had problems with amarok and sound in 6.06 - i had to apt-get install libmad0 and libxine-extracodecs. maybe this should be added to http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Dapper#How_to_install_Multimedia_Player_.28amaroK.29 ?
2006-08-17T13:36:00.000Z	jaakkos		hmm
2006-08-17T13:36:00.000Z	jaakkos		well the problem was mp3-playback so as a restricted format it doesn't fit there i guess
