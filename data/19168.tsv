2011-11-30T09:51:00.000Z	greg3000		friends who are familiar with "Unity", does anyone know why my Ubuntu Unity Launcher will not remember when I right click on a running app and select "Keep in Launcher"?  Also does anyone know why on my top horizontal task bar the theme looks good up until the right hand side where it shows me icons for networking, sound, mail, time, chat, user, and power. Pls use my nick when replying :)
