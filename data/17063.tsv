2012-01-10T07:33:00.000Z	iceroot	Doodie	i guess you misstyped "main" as "ain"
2012-01-10T07:34:00.000Z	Doodie	iceroot	yes, i must have pasted incomplete ppa:... code
2012-01-10T07:35:00.000Z	iceroot	Doodie	hm i hoped there was the command for adding a ppa, it was something like "sudo add-apt-repository ppa-url"
