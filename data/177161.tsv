2006-06-21T15:15:00.000Z	lerch		Hello. Can anybody tell me if it's possible to connect to an ftp server in nautilus running in active mode?
2006-06-21T15:16:00.000Z	lerch		I'm refering to the "Connect to server..." option in the Gnome panel.

2006-06-21T15:37:00.000Z	lerch	neotard	Sorry my late respond. ftp://<server address> works in passive mode, but It just sits there forever trying to connect to a server requiring active mode.
