2010-04-25T02:15:00.000Z	rodox		I have ubuntu 9.04 and need upgrade to 9.10 with cd image from ubuntu-9.10-desktop-i386.iso. It's possible or I need download the "alternate"

2010-04-25T02:19:00.000Z	rodox	guntbert	Don't I can make a local repository and download from the net?
2010-04-25T02:20:00.000Z	guntbert	rodox	that is possible too (look for apt-mirror) but we are talking about a *lot* of space here
