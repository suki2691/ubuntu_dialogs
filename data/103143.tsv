2008-09-01T03:58:00.000Z	Leefmc		Question: Gah, i can't create links in my Applications dropdown. Whenever i do, they go into a "Folder" in the Applications dropdown named "Debian". For example, if i go into the Applications->Games section and add a launcher, it doesn't add it there, but rather it adds it to Applications->Debian->Games.. any help?
