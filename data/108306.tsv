2008-01-09T04:26:00.000Z	enkidu_ak		I am attempting to install mplayer from source after compiling it as a .deb package using fakeroot. However, when I attempt to install i with dpkg -i, I receive a message saying "upgrade refused". Why would I receive this message?
2008-01-09T04:27:00.000Z	neverblue	enkidu_ak	ask in #mplayer ?
2008-01-09T04:27:00.000Z	enkidu_ak	neverblue	I can ask in mplayer, yes, but I think this is relating more to dpkg conflicts than to the mplayer binary. After all, it compiled successfully.
