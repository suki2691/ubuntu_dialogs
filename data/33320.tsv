2012-01-09T13:35:00.000Z	derp		http://pastebin.com/ecm7b8wZ  <--need some advice, cant get rc.local to execute all of my commands, am I mising something?
2012-01-09T13:36:00.000Z	derp		it only executes the first one
2012-01-09T13:37:00.000Z	rumpe1	derp	cant' load the pastebin at the moment, but maybe because the first command doesn't terminate?
2012-01-09T13:38:00.000Z	rumpe1	derp	you could send them into background using <command>&
