2006-10-29T10:40:00.000Z	amphi	Eclypse	I have the same, the supported freqs are from 600MHz in 200MHz increments
2006-10-29T10:41:00.000Z	amphi	Eclypse	there's a lot of tweaking you can do; for one thing, I assure you screen backlight brightness makes a difference
2006-10-29T10:41:00.000Z	POVaddct	amphi	right, 600mhz. 800mhz is minimum for pentium m 2ghz
