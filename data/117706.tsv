2007-10-14T11:12:00.000Z	NotSure		ok, folks, i use gnome, i need a program to be loaded when the gnome is fully loaded (on startup). How do I do it?
2007-10-14T11:13:00.000Z	oliver_g_	NotSure	there should be an editor for the auto-started stuff
2007-10-14T11:14:00.000Z	oliver_g_	NotSure	(look under Menu System -> Settings -> Session)
2007-10-14T11:18:00.000Z	oliver_g_	NotSure	(maybe the editor under System -> Settings -> Session is easier)
