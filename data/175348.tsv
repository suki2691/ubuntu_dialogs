2012-05-30T17:21:00.000Z	asdf_		i'm trying to install xen on a remote headless server so i need to be able to boot the xen config just once to make sure it works

2012-05-30T17:23:00.000Z	asdf_	damo22	yeah, I'm not happy with grub2 at all.  i understand it can do more, but 99% of what it _needs_ to do is to boot your os
