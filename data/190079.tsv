2006-06-30T07:19:00.000Z	zealot	Warbo	how is compiz anything remotely like metacity?
2006-06-30T07:19:00.000Z	zealot	Warbo	transparency and wobbling are not features in metacity ;-)
2006-06-30T07:20:00.000Z	Warbo	zealot	It uses the GTK+ colour scheme, it's buttons and menus are basically the same and the only theme available is like Clearlooks (has the close gadgets on the right, etc.)
