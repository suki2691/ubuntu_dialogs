2008-06-16T02:49:00.000Z	smoked1		This is my first time trying kubuntu. I am using a dell inspiron 6000 with ATI graphics. How do I get GLXGEARS installed so that I can test it?
2008-06-16T02:50:00.000Z	smoked1		I did and nothing happens
2008-06-16T02:51:00.000Z	smoked1		I activated the ati drivers. I'll try #kubuntu
