2010-04-08T01:37:00.000Z	maginot	hugli	how are you creating those commands?
2010-04-08T01:40:00.000Z	maginot	hugli	I don't think could work using file names and thing other then keyboard keys... but you can try...
2010-04-08T01:42:00.000Z	maginot	hugli	maybe there is some program who implement that, I don't know, any command I need I type with Alt+F2 or now on my tilda ;)
