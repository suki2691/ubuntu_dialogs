2007-10-23T06:30:00.000Z	cellofellow		I'm trying to install a patched ALSA to get my sound working. I need to remove alsa-utils, but if I do that then it breaks GDM. How can I force GDM to stay? (I'm not interested in using startx right now. :) )

2007-10-23T06:32:00.000Z	cellofellow	Jordan_U	and I don't know how to use apt-src. Can you help me with that?
