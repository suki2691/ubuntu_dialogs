2010-06-28T07:40:00.000Z	paranoidphreak	rollman	oh...i'm having a different issue. the version boots on other systems but not on the system i copied it from
2010-06-28T07:42:00.000Z	rollman	paranoidphreak	yes it uses the original system u booted from try reinstalling and running it from that system only
2010-06-28T07:43:00.000Z	paranoidphreak	rollman	my usb version works on every other system except on the system it was copied from
