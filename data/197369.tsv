2010-03-15T21:06:00.000Z	axisys	lullabud	wasn't it dpkg -l ?
2010-03-15T21:07:00.000Z	lullabud	axisys	i thought i saw an apt- tool mentioned the other day... dpkg -l would do it though
2010-03-15T21:07:00.000Z	axisys	lullabud	could be.. i know dpkg is one way.. there is aptitude there too and synaptics
