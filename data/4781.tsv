2012-06-23T21:41:00.000Z	stygzy		I'm trying to map the extra buttons on 3 use mice that i use simultaneously, 2 Gyration Air mice and a Logitech marblemouse. Should I do it via the i xorg.conf.d config files or is there a program you guys can recommend?

2012-06-23T21:48:00.000Z	stygzy	Darael	I think i know what to do for the marble mouse  but i havent been able to find to much documentation on the remapping the gyration air mouse in linux
