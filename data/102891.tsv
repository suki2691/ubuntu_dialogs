2008-01-23T03:17:00.000Z	Flare183	dracula2	you have to have zenwalk on disk to install it using virtual box
2008-01-23T03:17:00.000Z	dracula2	Flare183	what's the point of virtual box then? how can i install without a disk? network install?
2008-01-23T03:18:00.000Z	Flare183	dracula2	see that's the thing you must have bought the disk to use it and i don't think that zenwalk has a network install function
