2007-06-21T12:54:00.000Z	andrewkk		any idea why mount is giving me "invalid option -- v"? man mount lists it as an valid switch.
2007-06-21T12:55:00.000Z	oskude	andrewkk	maybe its "-V" (capital V)
2007-06-21T12:55:00.000Z	andrewkk	oskude	that's for Version. i want verbose.
2007-06-21T12:56:00.000Z	oskude	andrewkk	ah ok, mount -v works here (means no error)
