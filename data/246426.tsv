2012-09-29T15:33:00.000Z	Myrtti	administrator__	can you expand your question, what do you mean by blocking and what do you mean by removable device?
2012-09-29T15:38:00.000Z	Myrtti	administrator__	what do you mean by blocking? stopping it from automounting, or stopping it from starting nautilus, or what?
2012-09-29T15:45:00.000Z	Myrtti	administrator__	I have no idea how to achieve that.
