2006-06-16T09:06:00.000Z	Zambezi		I installed mIRC with wine. I runned sudo apt-get remove wine --purge. Is mIRC also erased now? Cause that's what I want.
2006-06-16T09:06:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Zambezi	nope - remove ~/.wine as well
2006-06-16T09:07:00.000Z	Frogzoo		!tell loki505 about fixxine
2006-06-16T09:07:00.000Z	Zambezi	Frogzoo	Rambo3: It's pretty good that it doesn't erase everything with the first commando.
