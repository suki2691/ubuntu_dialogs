2009-05-03T06:21:00.000Z	benje	gregge	you have to enter your password at start of session
2009-05-03T06:22:00.000Z	gregge	benje	I have automatic login, would it not ask for it if I didn't have automatic login?
2009-05-03T06:23:00.000Z	benje	gregge	yes without automatic login it would not ask and it use your entered pass at start of sessiion
