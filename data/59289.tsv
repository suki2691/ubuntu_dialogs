2010-06-24T14:08:00.000Z	j800r		ah, ok. thanks for that. i'm constantly torn between kde and gnome
2010-06-24T14:08:00.000Z	indus	j800r	just keep in mind, the menu will be completely cluttered with both kde and gnome apps, i dont recommend it
2010-06-24T14:09:00.000Z	indus	j800r	do a multi boot with either desktops
