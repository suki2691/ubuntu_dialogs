2007-12-01T07:11:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	scott__	whats your issue?
2007-12-01T07:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	scott__	when grub loads, i presume its when you boot your ubuntu drive first, right?
2007-12-01T07:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	scott__	ok, can you browse the old drive, and look at the grub menu config?  IF so, it will tell you what parameters it was using, and you can just set those perameters inside Ubuntu's grub menu.lst,
