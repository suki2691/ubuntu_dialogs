2009-05-15T00:22:00.000Z	PTR__		Hi! I have an old laptop(800mhz, 512mb ram, 14gb hdd). WinXP is really SLOW, would Ubuntu be a good option? Could this computer do as a surf computer?

2009-05-15T00:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PTR__	 ive ran ubuntu on a 600mhz celleron. so it can do it. Just dont expect any heavy apps to be speedy it should web surf fine.
