2010-07-17T05:04:00.000Z	bouma		does anyone know how to automatically clean /media to prevent the issue of appending _'s stuffing up dir's
2010-07-17T05:04:00.000Z	bouma		its breaking my carefully setup association with a utorrent via a script that changes a linux path into a wine path so that utorrent will work on right click
2010-07-17T05:05:00.000Z	bouma		could anyone guide me in making a script to clean /media of any _'s or even the original dirs seem to be the problem. actually i dont understand the origin of the problem
2010-07-17T05:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	bouma	you running utorrent in wine? maybe that's the problem
