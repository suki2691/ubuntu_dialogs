2011-10-07T00:25:00.000Z	dockhorn		hi, i just upgraded from 10.04 to 10.10 and my sound is really quiet...  i looked online and found suggestions i recompile the kernel.  is there a simpler way to fix it?
2011-10-07T00:27:00.000Z	dockhorn		oerheks i'd be willing to do that, but kpackagekit doesn't seem to think there is an upgrade available...  maybe i need to click some option to have it show up?

2011-10-07T00:28:00.000Z	dockhorn	w30	yes, all sound.  i've found the control panel and turned everything all the way up, with barely any effect
