2007-01-31T13:02:00.000Z	A-L-P-H-A		Is there a way to remote to another linux box, via windows.  I know of VNC, any other alternatives?
2007-01-31T13:02:00.000Z	TheSkorm	A-L-P-H-A	there is ssh
2007-01-31T13:03:00.000Z	A-L-P-H-A	TheSkorm	ssh would just allow me to tunnel to the VNC port... but i'm wondering other methods... I remember something called remoteX, if that is around... and cygwin allows for it.
2007-01-31T13:04:00.000Z	A-L-P-H-A	TheSkorm	ssh or did you mean use ssh, like telnet?
