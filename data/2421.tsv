If I echo things that env does not show as set, sometimes they are showing up anyway. For instance if I run 'env -i /bin/bash', $PS1 is still populated, even though 'env' doesn't show it as set.

2012-06-16T07:27:00.000Z	Kelsie	escott	Is there a list of variables that are automatically set in that manner? $PATH seems to get set too
