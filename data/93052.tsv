2008-04-28T04:15:00.000Z	themoebius_		I'm following a guide to get video working on the mac book pro wit ATI and I installed xorg-driver-fglrx_8.471-0*.deb but when I rebooted, update manager says it has a newer version. But the version number is 1:7.10-8-3+2.6.24.12-16.34. So which one should I use? the one the guide said to download or th one the repos claim is newer?
2008-04-28T04:16:00.000Z	Pelo	themoebius_	the guide was probably made before the new package came out , so try the new one ,  no garranties howver
2008-04-28T04:18:00.000Z	themoebius_	Pelo	Ok. also, I thought fglrx drivers were supposed to be proprietary so what are they doing in the ubuntu repos?
2008-04-28T04:18:00.000Z	Pelo	themoebius_	I have no idea
