2007-08-28T08:45:00.000Z	DrMitch		i can't get the dang (x/u)buntu 7.04 to install, it freezes completely right after the installer starts X. is there a way to log to a file the install process so i can find out wtf driver is causing it to stall?
2007-08-28T08:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	DrMitch	Can you get to a terminal with ctrl+alt+F1 ( F7 to get back to X ) ?
2007-08-28T08:46:00.000Z	DrMitch	Jordan_U	nope, nothing works. numlocks button doesn't even work
2007-08-28T08:47:00.000Z	DrMitch	Jordan_U	i tried using the alternate installer for xubuntu as well, it froze too
