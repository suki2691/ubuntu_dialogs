2007-06-06T11:44:00.000Z	JuJuBee		I am preparing to clone my HD.  I have identical drives... I want to make sure the drive is good to clone.  How can I check it?
2007-06-06T11:45:00.000Z	teamwork	JuJuBee	i think checking the filesystems is a good idea.  use fsck.
2007-06-06T11:47:00.000Z	teamwork	JuJuBee	i can't remember offhand.  do you know how to mount them?
2007-06-06T11:49:00.000Z	teamwork	JuJuBee	you get it going ok?
