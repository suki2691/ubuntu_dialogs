2009-01-22T23:08:00.000Z	broSand		anyone have any experience with Coby mp3 players under linux?
2009-01-22T23:09:00.000Z	broSand		I'm having a hard time telling whether or not they use MTP or just come up as standard flash memory drives
2009-01-22T23:09:00.000Z	Izinucs	broSand	plug it in and see if it's autodiscovered and accessable.. if it's not then it's probably MTP and Jaunty might fix that issue once out.
