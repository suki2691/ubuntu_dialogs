2007-10-01T05:01:00.000Z	Oval		Hi guys,.
2007-10-01T05:02:00.000Z	Oval		Is there a quick check that I can run without installing anything to get an HTTP response on port 80?
2007-10-01T05:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Oval	What?  What sort of response are you looking for?
2007-10-01T05:07:00.000Z	Oval	Flannel	Sorry about that.  I just want to see if I can run a service on port 80 and have it respond properly, I'm testing some network settings.
