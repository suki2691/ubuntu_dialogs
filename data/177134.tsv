2006-08-28T12:23:00.000Z	gan|y|med	Paddy_EIRE	i wanna mount a reiserfs partiton on a firewire disk but it mounts it as root only, no write access for users. pmount is used to dynamically mount it, so there is no fstab entry
2006-08-28T12:25:00.000Z	gan|y|med	Paddy_EIRE	no prob
2006-08-28T12:36:00.000Z	gan|y|med	Paddy_EIRE	i have done this, now i can mount it, but still root only, i have some additional options in the kde dialogue, however. but i cannot change them -> root only
