2007-06-16T15:34:00.000Z	captaincheebra		I am trying to figure out what a good wireless router might be for my family to purchase, we use Dapper Drake, and I have looked around and it is very overwhelming I just don't know where to start

2007-06-16T15:35:00.000Z	captaincheebra	Flannel	how would I check my NIC if it is compatible?
