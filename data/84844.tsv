But now ive encountered a maximum filesize problem. 4i believe on FAT32. So i need an other file system, that ill be able to read and/or write on all 3 systems. Any suggestions on the fly? and ty! :)

2008-07-24T17:00:00.000Z	TiredWolf	ndo	well i'm not really sure, mac os has a BSD core so perhaps ext3 is even available natively, i haven't the slighest idea really. but i think it really has to be readily available given all the posixness
