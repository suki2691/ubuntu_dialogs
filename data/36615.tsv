To those people that are trying to dual boot Ubuntu?? && ????, with Plop as the primary Boot Manager, IF during the installation of Ubuntu you allow Ubuntu to handle the partitioning, Ubuntu will put it's self in an EXTENDED partition. IF Ubuntu is in an extended partition and you tell GRUB 2 to be installed to that partition when given the option: GRUB 2 WILL NOT BE INSTALLED,

BE AWARE: GRUB 2 doesn't like being installed on extended/logical partitions, for good reason, it has to use BLOCKLISTS, according to GRUB these are UNRELIABLE. In fact, I just did this, and it corrupted the entire extended partition, though others
