2005-02-09T12:38:00.000Z	Seamus		Hey guys -- got a question.  I'm running ubuntu on my dell inspiron 600m laptop, everything works great so far, except for the fact that I can't hot-swap out of my cd-rom drive without a kernel panic
2005-02-09T12:39:00.000Z	nevyn	Seamus	I don't know if linux supports hot-swap IDE
2005-02-09T12:40:00.000Z	nevyn	Seamus	and if it did you'd need to do something before pulling out the device.
2005-02-09T12:40:00.000Z	Seamus	nevyn	So there's no kernel option for it?
