However, it will be slower than running it from an internal virtual harddrive.

2009-07-06T11:46:00.000Z	OttifantSir	redsoxking	I don't see the problem: Install Virtualbox from virtualbox.org, create a Wndows 7 machine, make a .vdi (Virtual Disk Image) on your external harddrive, make sure it is mounted before starting the machine. Should work fine.
