2008-07-04T22:32:00.000Z	wweasel		Could someone give me a bit of help with sed (i'm just learning)? I would like to parse a multi-line text file, search for the instance of "CLUE n", where n is a number, and have it output only the number n.
2008-07-04T22:33:00.000Z	wweasel		my issue is with outputting only the number n. right now i get the whole text file, with "CLUE n" replaced by "n"
2008-07-04T22:35:00.000Z	legend2440	wweasel	have you tried channel   #sed?
