2007-10-18T03:48:00.000Z	agarwood		Good evening, I just bought a USB key "usb 2.0 mobile disk" from "twinmos" ubuntu but does not recognize the connection ... The manual tells me that I must raise the key ... And finally, a user guide tells me that I need minimum "Linux kernel 2.4" ... Can you explain how to mount my key, thank you.

2007-10-18T03:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	agarwood	 as for 'raise' not sure what ya mean there.
2007-10-18T03:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	agarwood	 7.10 is due out tomorrow. :)  as for mounting it . you 'should' be able to just plug it in and it will automount/ask/show an icon on the desktop. If not - read up on manually mounting things. Check 'dmesg' output to see where its being detected as.
