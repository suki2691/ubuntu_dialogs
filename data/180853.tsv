2009-07-29T19:03:00.000Z	mphill	nichlas	openvpn is pretty straight forward, they have good documentation
2009-07-29T19:04:00.000Z	nichlas	mphill	i tried that, but the windows client isn't as straight-forward i think
2009-07-29T19:05:00.000Z	nichlas	mphill	was actually looking at pptp, but that seemed to not work for me either.
