2012-01-14T22:08:00.000Z	Demonstrate	_cb	unity isnt an O/S it's a desktop environment
2012-01-14T22:09:00.000Z	Demonstrate	_cb	you can find linux games on the net, those games aren't very well known :O
2012-01-14T22:10:00.000Z	Demonstrate	_cb	you can google "ubuntu games" and find a bigger list of compatible games.
