2008-10-06T21:34:00.000Z	trilobiti	debfx	maybe your soundcard has two output channels, separate for front and rear ?
2008-10-06T21:38:00.000Z	debfx	trilobiti	no, it's a driver feature
2008-10-06T21:40:00.000Z	trilobiti	debfx	I'd check the soundcard manufacturer's website for any driver news for linux. If it's a driver thing, that's the best place to start.
