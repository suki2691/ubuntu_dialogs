2012-11-18T03:08:00.000Z	eindoofus		hi, I'm logged into my school account through ssh in my linux terminal and I'd like to copy a file to my local machine so that I can work on the assignment without having to worry about losing a connection. Is there anyway to copy from the remote machine to my local machine?
