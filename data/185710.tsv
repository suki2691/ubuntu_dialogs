2006-06-08T09:34:00.000Z	AlwaysIcey	WhatTheDeuce	 You need to register your site at dyndns or no-ip.com and you can.  I have one hosted (although I'm getting it set up right now)
2006-06-08T09:34:00.000Z	AlwaysIcey		You'll need to get their dynamic IP udater (whichever site you use) and that will keep you synched up.
2006-06-08T09:40:00.000Z	WhatTheDeuce	AlwaysIcey	Do you know of any good tutorials of how to get it all set up?
