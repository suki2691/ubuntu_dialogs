2008-08-28T01:08:00.000Z	basicshwa		I need to do two things, 1. I need to learn how to add programs via apt-get and 2. I need to learn how to make fluxbox start on bootup (I downloaded the server edition and installed fluxbox, if I want to start it, I have to bootup my computer and press startx)
2008-08-28T01:09:00.000Z	guntbert	basicshwa	1) try apt-get install <package>
2008-08-28T01:11:00.000Z	guntbert	basicshwa	no, just the package name as "apt-get install abe"
2008-08-28T01:13:00.000Z	guntbert	basicshwa	I forgot "sudo apt-get ..."
