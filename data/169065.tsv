2008-08-18T18:25:00.000Z	Skyrail		Hey, I'm using recordmydesktop to record...well my desktop, but I want to record the login screen as well, can I run recordmydesktop on tty1 on the command line and set it to record what's on tty7? Or will the connection break when I logout? If I can select which display to record on, how can I do that?
