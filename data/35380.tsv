2010-03-25T07:21:00.000Z	[TechGuy]		Good evening. Running 9.10 under VirtualBox with an AC97 virtual audio card. Sound prefs still only show hardware as internal stereo audio. Am I missing a brain cell or two for enabling full 5.1 surround?

2010-03-25T07:23:00.000Z	[TechGuy]	ZykoticK9	k. Honestly wasn't sure whether it was a kernel driver thing or what. Normally hardware, even virtual hardware, is hardware. :D
2010-03-25T07:24:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	[TechGuy]	i could be wrong...
