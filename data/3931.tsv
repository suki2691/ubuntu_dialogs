2012-04-19T07:38:00.000Z	cwi	linux_is_my_hero	i backed up my files on an external HD before installing ubuntu, did full format. is it safe for me to resize ubuntu partition and make a new one to restore my files?

2012-04-19T07:39:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	cwi	ubuntu can see all other file formats...so after you edit the partition, or even before, you can copy everything back over from the external. :-)
2012-04-19T07:43:00.000Z	cwi	linux_is_my_hero	& pepee: to be specific, i want to make 3 partitions for restoring my files, plus 1 new partition for kubuntu (hibernate/suspend failed in ubuntu, they said it works in kubuntu, so i want to give a try)
