2007-10-16T09:20:00.000Z	ArtVandalae	bullgard4	google it, there's a lot of comparisons
2007-10-16T09:21:00.000Z	ArtVandalae	bullgard4	for a start, postgresql can be considered "completely" free
2007-10-16T09:21:00.000Z	ArtVandalae	bullgard4	I think MySQL is not allowed for commercial use, or some strange clause like that
