2010-01-03T02:23:00.000Z	noob		can someone please tell me why when I try to save my nVidia x-server settings to xorg.conf it says "unable to make xorg.conf.backup".  I need to change permissions for this file I think, since it's owned by root.  I just don't know how to use chmod and I have tried to research it.  Even "man chmod" isn't clear to me.
