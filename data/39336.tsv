2010-01-11T06:55:00.000Z	Lantizia		At the shell, how can I read the label of a floppy disk?
2010-01-11T06:56:00.000Z	Awesome3000	Lantizia	 does fdisk -l list the floppy
2010-01-11T06:57:00.000Z	Lantizia	Awesome3000	already tried that - doesn't tell you the label
2010-01-11T07:06:00.000Z	Awesome3000	Lantizia	 sudo mlabel -s A:  That should do it
