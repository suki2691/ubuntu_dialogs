2008-12-08T21:58:00.000Z	YlandeFaran		I want to convert many .bmp files to .jpg. I rather not write the names of each and every one.
2008-12-08T21:58:00.000Z	YlandeFaran		How can I make a smooth command to do this?
2008-12-08T22:00:00.000Z	kevin__	YlandeFaran	you should check out imagemagick
2008-12-08T22:00:00.000Z	kevin__	YlandeFaran	specifically the mogrify command. it'll convert multiple images to another format with one command, renaming them too
