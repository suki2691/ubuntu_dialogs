2012-02-22T00:23:00.000Z	Scott_S	ActionParsnip	Any ideas as to why using 'screen -r [screen name]' wouldn't be working? I myself am not that experienced with it, so I could be giving false directions for reconnecting to one
2012-02-22T00:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Scott_S	I've never used screen, sorry
2012-02-22T00:24:00.000Z	Scott_S	ActionParsnip	Roger, thanks anyways
