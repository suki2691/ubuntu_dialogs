2005-10-07T05:23:00.000Z	Inf3ctedfx	PhilH	NVU?
2005-10-07T05:27:00.000Z	PhilH	Inf3ctedfx	NVU is WYSIWYG, the others aren't really, therefore i'd go for bluefish
2005-10-07T05:31:00.000Z	PhilH	Inf3ctedfx	bluefish is a nice editor which helps you to code HTML, screem is similar, NVU's the only one that you're likely to like if you use WYSIWYG stuff
