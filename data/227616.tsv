2006-10-20T13:04:00.000Z	mimithebrain		anyone, does hostname and domain name affect linux boxes from connecting to each other in any way?
2006-10-20T13:05:00.000Z	mimithebrain		use the nick command
2006-10-20T13:05:00.000Z	Jowi	mimithebrain	no, but it does make it easier to connect to "mimibox" instead of 192.168.0.15
