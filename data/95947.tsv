2010-07-27T05:45:00.000Z	Austin`		Trying to install an nVidia graphics card. I've installed the packages (nvidia-current and all of the ones that it depends on) and ran nvidia-settings. It says that the nvidia kernel module is missing when I boot. How could I get it?
2010-07-27T05:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Austin`	 you rebooted after you installed the drivers?
2010-07-27T05:46:00.000Z	Austin`	Dr_Willis	Well I installed the packages (nvidia-current and associated). I haven't bothered with the drivers that nvidia puts out, do I need those?
