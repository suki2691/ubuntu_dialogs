2010-06-30T16:07:00.000Z	rocket16	aaaoooaaa	Well, did you update your database? If not, go to Terminal, and type "sudo apt-get update"
2010-06-30T16:08:00.000Z	aaaoooaaa	rocket16	does that have the same effect of hitting the "reload" button? Cause I did that and also did the cli
2010-06-30T16:09:00.000Z	rocket16	aaaoooaaa	Well, I believe reload button does not do all what is necessary. So, better to use the code.
