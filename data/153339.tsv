2007-03-18T06:48:00.000Z	idn		hi i am running a server on one of my computers with ubuntu installed and I was wondering if there is a way to list the packages pending to be updated without running apt-get upgrade because sometimes I just want to see what is pending and not update

2007-03-18T06:50:00.000Z	idn		also make sure you get a card with two dvi outputs and not one div, one vga
