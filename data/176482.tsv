2012-05-15T18:15:00.000Z	cryptic		hey, I'm in multiple monitor hell right now: I have five monitors (four at 1920x1200 and one at 2560x1440) connected to two graphics cards: four are on an nvidia quadro nvs 420, and the 2560x1440 is on a quadro 4000. anyway, xinerama is virtually unusable (it's jittery, and sometimes crashes X). should I switch to kde?
2012-05-15T18:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cryptic	 you did enable twinview? why do you think kde would help?
2012-05-15T18:17:00.000Z	cryptic	Dr_willis	should I use twinview?
2012-05-15T18:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	cryptic	 its nvidias replacement for xinerama with more features.. so id say yes.
