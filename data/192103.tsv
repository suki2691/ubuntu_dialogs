2006-04-04T07:54:00.000Z	frank23	sgratra	that was the most alien thing about linux when I started using it. There should be references about this online
2006-04-04T07:56:00.000Z	frank23	sgratra	programs  in /usr/bin   libraries in /usr/lib,  configuration files in /etc, temp files in /tmp,  all your personal config and data files in /home/user
2006-04-04T07:57:00.000Z	sgratra	frank23	- thanks! I also just did a search for file structure differences.
