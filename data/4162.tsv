2012-06-04T15:59:00.000Z	geekbri	unkn-error	that kind of question will get a different answer from each person.
2012-06-04T16:00:00.000Z	unkn-error	geekbri	ok
2012-06-04T16:00:00.000Z	geekbri	unkn-error	 I think if you have never set up either of them, it won't matter which you pick.  Apache is pretty well documented being the most used webserver around.  Nginx I find very easy to configure and has good documentation on their wiki as well.
