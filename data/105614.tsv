2009-02-07T10:00:00.000Z	tristan_		i'm trying to rickroll a friend of mine, and i've already got a shell script, but i just need to lock the volume so that he can't mute it.

2009-02-07T10:02:00.000Z	tristan_	wassy121	lol yeah, I would have (and soldered the speaker jack in place)  but it's an imac and it's all integrated and controlled by keys on the KB
