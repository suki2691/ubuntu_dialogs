2008-10-31T07:56:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	jtbandes	I do not know the answer to your question, it is good not to ask people by name though
2008-10-31T07:57:00.000Z	jtbandes	Meshezabeel	yes I know, and I did earlier, but you two were answering other questions about the effects, so I figured it was worth a shot. thanks.
2008-10-31T07:57:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	jtbandes	no prob ;)
