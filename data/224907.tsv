2007-10-31T19:14:00.000Z	delta	FrankQuist	I'd love to do that but I'm unable at the moment. I tried a lot of things but still this error when loading the driver.
2007-10-31T19:15:00.000Z	delta	FrankQuist	it remains something from a previous install I'm unable to uninstall completely.
2007-10-31T19:17:00.000Z	delta	FrankQuist	that's indeed a possibility. I'd prefer to check if something simple can be done first.
