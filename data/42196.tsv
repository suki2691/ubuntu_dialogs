2009-11-20T08:22:00.000Z	Roasted	Garbin	- when you say you upgraded to 9.10, is this machine a VM machine or is it your core OS youre running vbox on?

2009-11-20T08:23:00.000Z	Roasted	Garbin	- Im not sure. Ubuntu 9.10 introduced enough problems to my PC that I dropped back to 9.04 and intend to stay there. :(
