2009-02-05T06:20:00.000Z	Raylz		how do i find out if im using ipv4 or ipv6?
2009-02-05T06:20:00.000Z	spencer	Raylz	usually it's ipv4
2009-02-05T06:21:00.000Z	spencer	Raylz	for ipV6, the ip are not in 4 sets of numbers seperated by .
2009-02-05T06:24:00.000Z	Raylz	spencer	so it would only use ipv6 if i deactivated it in the kernel right?
