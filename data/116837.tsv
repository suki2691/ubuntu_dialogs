2007-12-30T23:20:00.000Z	critt	nickrud	could you recommend a repository I can add. All others in my list are for 7.04 "Feisty Fawn" Im using 7.10. Or does it matter?
2007-12-30T23:20:00.000Z	nickrud	critt	I generally stick to just the ubuntu repos, and cherry pick debs out of others, like libdvdcss and such
2007-12-30T23:48:00.000Z	critt	nickrud	Exaile is just what I was looking for perfect sounds great. Thanks!!!
