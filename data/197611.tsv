2006-08-22T14:36:00.000Z	ubuntu__		quick question, i just got the shipit cd's for kubuntu, but i didn't get the ubuntu/xubuntu cd's with it... do they send out more then one package at a time? where can i go to let them know im missing some? also, i like kubuntu's interface better then my ubuntu, can i do an apt-get install kubuntu and get kubuntu on my computer without having to reinstall everything and losing all my files and settings?
