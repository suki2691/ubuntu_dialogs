2012-05-13T18:36:00.000Z	gaelfx	DropsOfSerenity	how about ctl+alt+f2?
2012-05-13T18:38:00.000Z	DropsOfSerenity	gaelfx	of course i'm wondering if theres a better more streamlined way, sometimes the unity decorators crash when exiting a fullscreen game or something, was hoping unity had some sort of way of detecting that.
