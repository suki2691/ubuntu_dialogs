2008-04-11T06:54:00.000Z	dmsuperman	levander	i doubt it, anything's possible but this monitor's not that old, and has been very solid
2008-04-11T06:55:00.000Z	levander	dmsuperman	Yeah, but if the video card is mistreating the monitor...  My video card was less than  a year old when it started doing that to the monitor.  I'm just saying you need to figure that flickering out.  Could be bad.
