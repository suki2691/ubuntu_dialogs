2010-04-15T02:06:00.000Z	frxstrem		I'm just randomly wondering - and I know this may not be the best place to ask it - but is it possible to have more than one partition on a USB flash drive?

2010-04-15T02:07:00.000Z	frxstrem	darolu	and crucialhoax: okay, thanks :) any recommendations for good partitioning software, then? or anything built into Ubuntu?
