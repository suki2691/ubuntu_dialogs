2011-05-05T06:53:00.000Z	guampa		need a hand with this...what could be setting my hostname to "localhost.localdomain" on each boot? /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts show the original name of the computer
2011-05-05T06:54:00.000Z	guampa		if i run "hostname myrealhostname.net" everything gets back to normal

2011-05-05T06:56:00.000Z	barcef	guampa	 then I don't have a clue. Just remembere someone who was doing ti so fast that they didn't notice that the changes were not taking effect.
