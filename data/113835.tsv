2007-11-23T02:31:00.000Z	fannagoganna	Vladimir32tl	it would be copying your stuff on ext3 to an ntfs partition
2007-11-23T02:32:00.000Z	Vladimir32tl	fannagoganna	i mean in a scenario where i would want to remove ubuntu and allow my d: drive to be used by xp, which is on my c: drive (both c: and d: are on one hdd)
2007-11-23T02:34:00.000Z	fannagoganna	Vladimir32tl	sorry, that sounds like a windows thing which i know less and less about as time goes on...
