2010-03-26T04:34:00.000Z	Typos_King	luis__	  why you need it?    is the default text files handler on clicks
2010-03-26T04:35:00.000Z	luis__	Typos_King	because I got a script of greasemonkey I need to edit
2010-03-26T04:35:00.000Z	Typos_King	luis__	  which kate, most likely /usr/bin :)  or you can just use the bareword 'kate', it'll work cuz is in the $PATH
