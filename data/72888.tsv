2011-04-21T06:48:00.000Z	lucas_		Hi everyone! I have a local mirror of the maverick repository created by apt-mirror. Someone told me there is a program that makes this mirror automatically "visible" to other computers on the same network. What is this program called?

2011-04-21T06:50:00.000Z	lucas_	mickster04	someone told me to not use apt-mirror, but this program instead. I can't remember how it is called...
