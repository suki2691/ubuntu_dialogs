2010-04-02T14:15:00.000Z	milligan_		Hey .. trying to make an iso of my sons dvd to put on my mediabox. Trying this: dd if=/dev/cdrom of=/home/milligan/BeeMovie.iso . I'm getting dd: reading `/dev/cdrom': Input/output error. Same with cdrom1 (which is a burner). The disk plays in the ps2 (and in the dvd-player that crapped out a week ago). What could be wrong ?
