2009-01-04T21:44:00.000Z	smerz	amitprakash_	 check powernowd. that service amends clock speed too
2009-01-04T21:50:00.000Z	amitprakash_	smerz	powernowd fails to change it too
2009-01-04T21:51:00.000Z	amitprakash_	smerz	as in both cpufreqd and powernowd accept commands successfully but the clock speed remains at 1.8G[max]
