2006-05-04T13:42:00.000Z	Doat	paloyme	you have to launch win32 programs (.exe) with wine <exe>
2006-05-04T13:43:00.000Z	Doat	paloyme	there's no wine.exe. you open a terminal, cd to the directory where iexplore.exe is and do $ wine iexplore.exe
2006-05-04T13:44:00.000Z	Doat	paloyme	it just means you have to do that command. ignore it and just write "wine iexplore.exe" without the quotes
