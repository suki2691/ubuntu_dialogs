2011-07-08T21:25:00.000Z	noriX		Hi, I would like to try the awesome WM, but after i execute "unity -- replace && awesome &" unity starts immediately
2011-07-08T21:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	noriX	 you dont do it that way
2011-07-08T21:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	noriX	 you could make a custome .xinitrc or .xsession and use tghe 'custome' gdm session entry.
2011-07-08T21:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	noriX	 awesome would replace 'compiz' or metacity also.. (the window manager), not unity (the panel lauincher)
