2010-05-25T14:45:00.000Z	lgk		how easy is it to convert an i386 install of ubuntu to a 64bit install? Can I achieve the same result as using the amd64 iso by updating the software somehow?

2010-05-25T14:49:00.000Z	lgk	DryGrain	so the only difference between the two installs is the kernel? By updating the kernel I could save myself the trouble
