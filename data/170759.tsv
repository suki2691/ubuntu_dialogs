2006-10-09T08:17:00.000Z	Cas		Hi, I've a 1GB memory stick that only shows as 130MB after playing with gparted. I think the  heads, sectors/track and cylinders are wrong but how can I figure out to what I need to set this?

2006-10-09T08:18:00.000Z	Cas	mnepton	that doesn't change the size does it? (/me tries it anyways)
2006-10-09T08:23:00.000Z	Cas	mnepton	just did it and lost another 20MB :s
