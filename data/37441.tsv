2010-10-13T10:49:00.000Z	robojake		Is there a way to make ubuntu login automatically without a password and not require one for sudo like the live cd?  I'm making a custom live cd with some HD diagnostics tools on it, but I'd like to remove the password
2010-10-13T10:50:00.000Z	icarus-c	robojake	you mean sudo without entering password? that comes at serious security risk
2010-10-13T10:50:00.000Z	robojake	icarus-c	It doesn't really matter on a live cd
2010-10-13T10:51:00.000Z	icarus-c	robojake	oh i didn't read the "making a custom live cd" part :P
