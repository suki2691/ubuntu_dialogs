2012-06-11T10:02:00.000Z	iceroot	pb3	what about page up instead for weechat?
2012-06-11T10:04:00.000Z	pb3	iceroot	pg up scrolls the main content I think
2012-06-11T10:06:00.000Z	pb3	iceroot	figured it out. had to go the the keyboard shortcuts in the console and click on the keybinding and press backspace
