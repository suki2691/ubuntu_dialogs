2011-04-17T22:51:00.000Z	UkeofJersey		HELP!  I mounted my windows XP machine from Ubuntu 10.10 and accidentally deleted a folder full of m4v that took me forever to encode for the iphone, and I don't even know which machine I should be looking at to try to recover the files.  Thoughts?
2011-04-17T22:52:00.000Z	UkeofJersey		already tried an undelete on the win machine and they don't show
2011-04-17T22:53:00.000Z	UkeofJersey		so if I delete something from my XP machine from Ubuntu it is simply gone with 1 confirmation?
2011-04-17T22:54:00.000Z	brightspark	UkeofJersey	yep.
