2009-01-04T05:23:00.000Z	TobiasGreenich		Just asking again after a while, I've been trying to install quickcam drivers, and I've been able to download and extract the driver, but when I try to compile it I get an error. I have a pastebin link to the log. http://pastebin.com/d5eb1bb33
2009-01-04T05:24:00.000Z	TobiasGreenich		Nope. I'm new at all this.
2009-01-04T05:26:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	TobiasGreenich	check whick kernrel version they support with that module. it looks like it doesn't work with the version you have installed
2009-01-04T05:30:00.000Z	TobiasGreenich	zsquareplusc	it says kernel 2.6.20 as the most recent one. Easycam won't install the drivers, it gives errors as well.
