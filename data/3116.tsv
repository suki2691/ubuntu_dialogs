2012-05-12T08:04:00.000Z	john_832		Hello all! So, here I am trying to watch Season 3 of Friends from Ubuntu 12.04 and while I'm not getting any codec errors in VLC I'm not exactly getting any playtime....Anyone wanna give me some insightful direction?
2012-05-12T08:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	john_832	what is the media stored on? file? DVD?
2012-05-12T08:06:00.000Z	john_832	ActionParsnip	Yeah it's a DVD, more specifically, it's a DVD that wants to be using InterActual Player 2.0
2012-05-12T08:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	john_832	have you tried a different video output method in the options?
