2009-11-17T17:36:00.000Z	Halitech	Flynsarmy	you can use VLC to stream to another computer
2009-11-17T17:36:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	Halitech	that won't help me for things such as pidgin sounds
2009-11-17T17:37:00.000Z	Halitech	Flynsarmy	ok, you didn't say what sounds you wanted to stream to a windows computer, thought you wanted music
