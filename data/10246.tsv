2011-08-21T06:06:00.000Z	Cert		hello.. I'm a new user to Linux and am having some issues installing ubuntu 11.04; specifically, via usb or cd, the installer loads only past the "Ubuntu" screen (with 5 orange/white dots)
2011-08-21T06:08:00.000Z	Cert		I checked the integtrity of the disk, but not of the iso.
2011-08-21T06:09:00.000Z	wildbat	Cert	then the CD should be good. amd64 mean it is 64bit kernel only .
2011-08-21T06:10:00.000Z	Cert	wildbat	The installer crashes after the ubuntu screens, and displays what looks like this on 1000x zoom : http://www.hudsonhorizons.com/pub/images/barcode.png
