2010-02-03T06:39:00.000Z	krysis	dirk__	if ubuntu is off, it is off, there is no way to run ANY computer with any system while its off
2010-02-03T06:45:00.000Z	krysis	dirk__	 you have to understand that once a computer is turned off it has no control over an operating system (such as ubuntu) the system is turned to BIOS, and unless your bios supports some sort of timer to turn on (unless its wake on lan) it cannot be done from the operating system level
2010-02-03T06:46:00.000Z	krysis	dirk__	also if windows does it then it must use wake on lan
