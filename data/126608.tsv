2010-01-05T06:39:00.000Z	hvgotcodes		how do i get xchat2 to display users by default, instead of having to click the users button?
2010-01-05T06:39:00.000Z	IdleOne	hvgotcodes	you have to expand the user list on the right of the window
2010-01-05T06:41:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	IdleOne	no users list on the right --  i have xchat-gnome....
2010-01-05T06:41:00.000Z	IdleOne	hvgotcodes	ahh try asking in #xchat in that case
