2007-10-01T06:31:00.000Z	davubuntu		Hey all... I was wondering if anyone knows why azureus crashes as soon as it opens on feisty? I have found crash reports for edgy and some other pages in google mention crashes but they don't indicate what type of crash.
2007-10-01T06:33:00.000Z	davubuntu		When I was using Edgy I used Automatix to install Azureus and it worked but I didn't want to do that this time because I have heard you won't support it. So I installed form the repos and it crashes as soon as it has finished loading and the window opens
2007-10-01T06:34:00.000Z	davubuntu		I don't get an error in a pop up or anything. It just crashes. How can I see what the error is?
