2007-01-15T16:26:00.000Z	unop	JamesG	well, as with upgrading anything -- it is expected to encounter the little nagging problems -- but most problems have been ironed out or addressed
2007-01-15T16:29:00.000Z	unop	JamesG	if it's your work machine -- dapper should last you a while yet
2007-01-15T16:29:00.000Z	JamesG	unop	Well I'd quite like Eclipse 3.2, but I can wait :)
