2006-10-28T06:30:00.000Z	hellsbells		Hi everyone. i installed 6.10 yesterday and all's fine. Apart from trying to run amarok. it gets as far as the splash screen, then it disappears again. I think I might have messed it up myself, not sure though. I posted more about it in the forums http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=286054

2006-10-28T06:31:00.000Z	hellsbells	nolimitsoya	you can see the output in the forum post
2006-10-28T06:44:00.000Z	hellsbells	nolimitsoya	all the codecs seem to be there, so I don't think that's it
