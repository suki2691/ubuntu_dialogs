2008-01-04T20:33:00.000Z	qebab		Hi there. I've been installing Ubuntu on an Acer Travelmate 4100, and a problem has turned out. The Live CD worked fine, but when I try to boot to it, I get a blank, black screen. The laptop has an ATI card of some sort, and I've heard that it doesn't go too well with X. Is there anything I can do?
