2007-02-20T06:49:00.000Z	Qzr		I get a GRUB Error 22, anyone know what that means?
2007-02-20T06:50:00.000Z	Qzr		and could anyone tell me how on earth i get rid of GRUB?
2007-02-20T06:52:00.000Z	Qzr		Because I'm trying to install windows again, but when I run my recoverydisk the GRUB just lock up giving errors, and it wont let me boot from any other cds than the ubuntu and the recoverydisk. Ive tried a gentoo cd and a winxp cd.
