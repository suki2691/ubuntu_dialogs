2009-05-07T15:32:00.000Z	jimlovell777	smr904	I have had that issue before, I had an update wipeout xorg.conf
2009-05-07T15:33:00.000Z	jimlovell777	smr904	Have you tried nvidia-settings from the command line?
2009-05-07T15:36:00.000Z	jimlovell777	smr904	You can't get your old resolution back or the settings are not saved?
