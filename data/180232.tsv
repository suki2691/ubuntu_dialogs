2007-08-03T13:49:00.000Z	Wankus		hi guys, what does the command "sudo passwd" do? Does it change the root password?
2007-08-03T13:49:00.000Z	jrib	Wankus	yes, and it's completely unnecessary
2007-08-03T14:00:00.000Z	jrib	Wankus	sudo uses your user password, there isn't a seperate sudo password
2007-08-03T14:04:00.000Z	jrib	Wankus	it's equivalent (he was told the other way before soundray )
