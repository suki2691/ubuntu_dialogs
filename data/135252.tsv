2008-11-07T11:35:00.000Z	ziroday	TheDeepFriedBoo	take a look at mythtv
2008-11-07T11:36:00.000Z	ziroday	TheDeepFriedBoo	you can run it on ubuntu, you might also want to take a look at mythbuntu which comes with it preinstalled
2008-11-07T11:38:00.000Z	ziroday	TheDeepFriedBoo	sorry, we don't support LinuxMCE here
