2008-07-02T22:47:00.000Z	MrCraig		hi all - I want to remote admin someone's box - with their permission ofcourse.... ssh is not an option... isn't there some way I can do it using bitchx irc client if I have them log into the same channel as me?
2008-07-02T22:48:00.000Z	MrCraig		my problem is I don't have access to their firewall to open ports, it's administered my a security freak too - so it's tightly tied down
2008-07-02T22:48:00.000Z	snarkster	MrCraig	yah why isnt ssh an option
2008-07-02T22:49:00.000Z	MrCraig	snarkster	same as I just said - can't open ports... unless there is some way to open a listening client for an ssh session... I'm not so technically strong
