2007-06-20T08:04:00.000Z	Nutubuntu		Mariko[Linux] ,  I'm wondering if it's an issue with the laptop's onboard sound ... don't know if that's likely or not, nor what to suggest
2007-06-20T08:06:00.000Z	Nutubuntu		Hm ... not *me* maybe ... I'm not good with sound issues, and haven't really noticed who is, but I know that several people are. ... Who's good with soundcard / alsamixer issues here?
2007-06-20T08:06:00.000Z	DarkMageZ	Nutubuntu	is something blocking your sound device as well?
2007-06-20T08:07:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	DarkMageZ	 no, not mine ... but I'm going to have to go; I was trying to think who to point Mariko[Linux]   to
