2009-03-12T20:25:00.000Z	gRunt		Does anyone know if I can add a perform on connect script to pidgins IRC client like you can with mIRC?
2009-03-12T20:26:00.000Z	usr13	gRunt	You can with irssi  I don't know about pidgin
2009-03-12T20:27:00.000Z	usr13	gRunt	Other irc clients have such features, so I suppose pidgin should to, but just don't know.
