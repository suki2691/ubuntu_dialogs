2010-10-10T18:38:00.000Z	Moonlit	pr0xy	- well, I like to make my Linux installs kinda minimal, I changed the font and size down, but I can't make the UI smaller to match it :/
2010-10-10T18:39:00.000Z	Moonlit	pr0xy	- all I did was change the font and font size, the rest is all default (except the wallpaper)
2010-10-10T18:39:00.000Z	Moonlit	pr0xy	- I sorta expected the rest of the UI to shrink with it, but it didn't
