2010-05-05T17:29:00.000Z	SandGorgon		is there a upstart service manager that lets me choose services (like mysql.etc.) that should be started/not-started on boot ?

2010-05-05T17:30:00.000Z	SandGorgon	marienz	ActionParsnip, BobMarley I used to use sysv-rc-conf, but that may no longer be applicable, since I dont see entries for mysql in there
