2006-06-15T08:45:00.000Z	gbutler69		So, anyone know why MP3 Stream playback in RB is now not working on Dapper when it was working before? I have all the relevant stuff installed. Yes, I've read the FAQ. Is this a well-known problem or something unique to me?????
2006-06-15T08:46:00.000Z	nickrud	gbutler69	probably unique to you ;) you have gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly installed?
2006-06-15T08:48:00.000Z	gbutler69	nickrud	Yes, I have "gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly" installed. It WAS working great for last couple of months. Now....Kaput!
2006-06-15T08:49:00.000Z	nickrud	gbutler69	hm, I'm not much of a sound guru, but do you have sound otherwise?
