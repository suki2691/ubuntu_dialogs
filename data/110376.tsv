2008-02-05T00:51:00.000Z	niklas		I have problem with audio when am playing a movie. It disappears maybe 10 seconds and is working 45 sec. Then 10 seconds again and so on. I have had this problem before and I did something with ubuntu 7.10. Am currently using 8.04 alpha4. Please advice
2008-02-05T00:51:00.000Z	DRebellion	niklas	I advise you join #ubuntu+1
2008-02-05T00:51:00.000Z	niklas	DRebellion	I don't think its related to 8.04 because I have had this with ubuntu 7.10.
2008-02-05T00:52:00.000Z	DRebellion	niklas	that doesn't change the fact that you are using an alpha release
