2005-08-07T14:18:00.000Z	cefx		Question.  Why can't Ubuntu find 90% of the packages that are mentioned in the Ubuntu Guide?
2005-08-07T14:19:00.000Z	topyli	cefx	because you haven't enabled all the repositories that the guide assumes. also, the guide might just as well be incorrect
2005-08-07T15:56:00.000Z	topyli	cefx	you have the latest kernel
2005-08-07T15:56:00.000Z	cefx	topyli	thanks :)
