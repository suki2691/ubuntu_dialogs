2009-06-23T13:55:00.000Z	ne2k__		I am starting to get EXTREMELY AGGRAVATED with ubuntu. Firefox keeps hanging up at absolutely unacceptably frequent intervals. I go to click on a link or search for something and the application turns grey for ten seconds and then comes back. WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?!
