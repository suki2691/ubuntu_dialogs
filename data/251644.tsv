2006-12-03T17:46:00.000Z	gleesond		So now I have a root prompt on the live disk I tryed to change the driver in xorg.conf to fglrx and run startx but it tells me there was an error
2006-12-03T17:47:00.000Z	gleesond		fglrx does not exist on the livecd
2006-12-03T17:47:00.000Z	gleesond		not sure what plan of attack to take from here
2006-12-03T17:48:00.000Z	princemackenzie	gleesond	i believe you can still apt-get it from the livecd
