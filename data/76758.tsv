2009-05-17T19:21:00.000Z	Raynes		Okay, there is a package that I cannot remove, this is fine. My problem is that it keeps trying to configure it everytime I try to install a different package, this makes it error. Every single package I try to install errors at the end because it's trying to configure libghc6-glib-dev, and cannot. Is there anyway I can at least stop it from trying to configure this package when I install...
2009-05-17T19:21:00.000Z	Raynes		...another package. Or can I remove this package manually?
