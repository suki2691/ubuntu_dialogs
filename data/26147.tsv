2010-09-16T19:17:00.000Z	cjjnjust		Hello, option CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED  means what?
2010-09-16T19:19:00.000Z	Verminator	cjjnjust	means that option is not suppossed to be used anymore.  It has been retired, possiblt replaced by a different option
2010-09-16T19:20:00.000Z	cjjnjust	Verminator	means i should not config that option?
2010-09-16T19:21:00.000Z	Verminator	cjjnjust	thats usually how i take it.  You'll have to reaqd the man page for whatever command your using to see what option to use in its place.
