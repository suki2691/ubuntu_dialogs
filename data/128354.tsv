2007-10-16T09:31:00.000Z	riotkittie	Newbuntu2	sorry, the later it gets, the dumber i am. do you want to actually install from a USB drive, or do you want to use  a LiVe CD and have your settings stick
2007-10-16T09:33:00.000Z	Newbuntu2	riotkittie	I keep getting I/O read errors from the liveCD, so I'm blaming the CD drive. Im trying to bypass it by going the USB way
