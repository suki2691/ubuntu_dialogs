2007-06-02T09:22:00.000Z	snuf2		I have just set up ubuntu and discovered my ordinary account gets root privileges with sudo by reentering its password. I have also given a password to root and can now use root for root privileges as well. I am thinking of removing all root privileges from my regular log in so root has to be used. Would that cause any problems?

2007-06-02T09:23:00.000Z	snuf2	Flannel	I need root privileges for some things but I would like an account that cannot not get root privileges at all.
