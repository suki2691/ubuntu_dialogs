2006-11-06T14:24:00.000Z	Lattyware		Anyone know of a bug in any recent update that kills twinview?
2006-11-06T14:25:00.000Z	Lattyware		Because I have been using it and suddently one of my monitors doesn't do anything
2006-11-06T14:25:00.000Z	Lattyware		(Not in a broken-hardware way)
2006-11-06T14:26:00.000Z	ifireball	Lattyware	closest thing I've seen recently was a kernel module update that made X segfault, reboot solved it; other thenm that twinview works fine for me
