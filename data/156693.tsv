2007-11-17T08:36:00.000Z	Nutubuntu		I upgraded from Feisty to Gutsy and I'm regretting it. Gnome is messed up; it only runs in low-res ... I'm very glad I installed other window managers. How do I troubleshoot an upgrade that didn't do too well ?
2007-11-17T08:37:00.000Z	riotkittie	Nutubuntu	for the resolution thing, have you tried to reconfig xserver-xorg or manually edit xorg.conf ?
2007-11-17T08:37:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	riotkittie	yes - both
2007-11-17T08:38:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	riotkittie	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg was not a good thing to do; the interface was messed up and it set peculiar values for keyboard and refresh rates etc.
