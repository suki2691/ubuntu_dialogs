2007-03-19T14:04:00.000Z	l90bpm	yellow_chicken	 I had to stab another card in my other pc because my onboard was non-compliant w/ ubuntu..  in the process I mistakenly left the other ethernet plugged in as well so for a brief moment I had two ethernet cables plugged in.  This was causing mass hysteria w/ utorrent..  (got the lil yellow shield instead of the green)..  so I wouldn't suggest trying to run two cat5's
