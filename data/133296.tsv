2007-05-28T05:18:00.000Z	_spi_		My syslog log files are always big... to big... can I reduce the logging rate?
2007-05-28T05:18:00.000Z	TakeOut{u}	_spi_	you could always use something like splunk in order to consolidate your log files
2007-05-28T05:21:00.000Z	_spi_	TakeOut{u}	splunk is something like logrotate?
2007-05-28T05:28:00.000Z	_spi_	TakeOut{u}	I read about splunk, It's a log analyzer... It seems interesting but ins't it a ubuntu package?
