2009-02-04T06:20:00.000Z	ryanprior	Berserkur	We usually don't have a whole lot of kernel hackers in here. If you're looking for expertise, mailing lists (or possibly ##linux) are better options.
2009-02-04T06:26:00.000Z	ryanprior	Berserkur	I'm not sure that's true anymore. Lots of things have been moved out of xorg.conf and are being autodetected now.
2009-02-04T06:27:00.000Z	Berserkur	ryanprior	The only thing I know is autodetected is resolution and stuff like that. Stuff that randr handles
