2011-01-06T17:56:00.000Z	Phylock		today when i booted up my nautilus freezes each time i answer a dialog box, "move to trash", "replace"  etc, is this a known problem ??
2011-01-06T17:57:00.000Z	sam-_-	Phylock	may be a problem with permissions
2011-01-06T18:01:00.000Z	Phylock	sam-_-	when i delete a file and press delete in the dialog, nautilus freezes, after i start nautilus again the file is deleted. so its not a permissin problem on the files as i see it, could i be another place?
