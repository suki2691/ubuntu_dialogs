2005-06-26T09:45:00.000Z	j-linux		hi, relatively new user here.  I did a reinstall of my dual boot system (reformatted everything).  I installed ubuntu after XP pro but it won't recognize my wireless card (it did automatically on my last install).  Why didn't it do it the second time?
2005-06-26T09:47:00.000Z	j-linux		Since I can't get online with my new ubuntu installation (dual boot), can I safely just reinstall over the other Ubuntu installation without locking up my computer?
2005-06-26T09:48:00.000Z	j-linux		What is happening with all those people leaving?
2005-06-26T09:49:00.000Z	eyequeue	j-linux	 network issues, being resolved now
