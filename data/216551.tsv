2009-02-16T00:25:00.000Z	Ikelos324		How do you install a theme from a .gz file, if dragging it into the appearances window gives you the message "Theme not valid."
2009-02-16T00:26:00.000Z	ardchoille	Ikelos324	sometimes themes aren't packaged the way the Appearances window wants. you can unpack a theme and place it in ~/.themes and it works just as well
