2009-10-16T15:38:00.000Z	littlefish		may i ask a question about mysql on ubuntu?
2009-10-16T15:39:00.000Z	Slart	littlefish	I would say it qualifies as "ubuntu-related" =)
2009-10-16T15:42:00.000Z	Slart	littlefish	sounds like a permission problem.. me and mysql isn't even sending each other christmas cards any more so I can't really help you further.. perhaps someone else in here knows.. I'm pretty sure there is a mysql channel somewhere as well.. perhaps #mysql
2009-10-16T15:43:00.000Z	Slart	littlefish	you're welcome
