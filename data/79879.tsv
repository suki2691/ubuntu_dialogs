2008-11-01T01:53:00.000Z	Mark_Lawrence		Hi.  I just upgraded to 8.10 from 8.04.  Upgrade seemed to go fine, although a lot of 'obsolete' packages got uninstalled.  Now, on reboot, it gets as far as loading screen & then black screen with a few commands on there  -  but nothing else happens.  Help!!!

2008-11-01T01:55:00.000Z	RickZilla	Mark_Lawrence	 I'd say something went terribly wrong.  Can you reinstall 8.04 and try it again?
