2008-09-06T23:26:00.000Z	biouser		I want to see what ports, sockets and whatever else I can find are running
2008-09-06T23:27:00.000Z	usser	biouser	use nmap to scan for open ports
2008-09-06T23:28:00.000Z	biouser		I am trying to find some basic commands to see what is going on with my system... I have kind of dived in to trying to get a bunch of different stuff running too quickly and I have installed some with apt and some from source some from bin, etc.
