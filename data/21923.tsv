2010-12-16T00:56:00.000Z	resixian	telcnas	this is actually sth defined by the freedesktop standards, and they never though about it
2010-12-16T00:56:00.000Z	resixian	telcnas	some tiling window managers behave this way by default though
2010-12-16T00:58:00.000Z	resixian	telcnas	like i said, its not impossible. but those are actually distinct displays, they are not xinerama. or the wm handles them in non-fd way
