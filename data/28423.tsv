2011-01-23T18:12:00.000Z	geirha	mudit1141	It'll soon be out of support, you best get 10.04 LTS or 10.10
2011-01-23T18:13:00.000Z	geirha	mudit1141	You have 8.04 installed on your system? If so, upgrade that to 10.04.
2011-01-23T18:14:00.000Z	geirha	mudit1141	Software for 8.04 may work on 10.04, but if someone provides software for 8.04, they'll surely provide it for 10.04 too.
