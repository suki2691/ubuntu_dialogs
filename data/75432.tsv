2010-01-12T18:59:00.000Z	bloodski		hi, i had a user that accidently chmodded his home dir, and now it wont boot up properly, says it cant find the user's home dir.. any ideas how to fix this?
2010-01-12T19:00:00.000Z	mmo|	bloodski	cant you just chmod it back to the way it was?
2010-01-12T19:01:00.000Z	mmo|	bloodski	ah, i dont really know actually. all files probably didnt have the same chmod....hm
2010-01-12T19:01:00.000Z	mmo|	bloodski	but to be able to boot he should set some rights that just lets him read and execute everything I guess
