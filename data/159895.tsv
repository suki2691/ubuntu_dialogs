2012-07-20T14:11:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	New2Ubuntu	sure, it's a hardcoded sleep() in the bootup scripts</sarcasm>
2012-07-20T14:13:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	New2Ubuntu	it should only happen every 30 boots or so
2012-07-20T14:13:00.000Z	MasterOfDisaster	New2Ubuntu	check with dumpe2fs/tune2fs whether it really was fsck
