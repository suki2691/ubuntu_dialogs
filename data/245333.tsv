2005-07-08T09:07:00.000Z	arenner		my resolution is stuck at 640x480, but my xorg.conf is set to display 1024x768, any ideas?
2005-07-08T09:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arenner	 check the monitor settings in tht file?
2005-07-08T09:08:00.000Z	arenner	Dr_Willis	Monitor settings only calls out DPMS, You think I am being forced to 640x480 because of lack of vert and horiz sync?
2005-07-08T09:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arenner	 hmm.. sounds odd to me..  could cheat and try a Knoppix Live CD. and copy its config over. If it works. Or use it as a start.
