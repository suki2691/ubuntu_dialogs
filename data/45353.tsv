2009-10-21T04:30:00.000Z	trygg		I have a really wierd problem, after I've listened to/watch something, the music and/or video gets all mumbled, screechy and it starts to lag like crazy.
2009-10-21T04:30:00.000Z	trygg		Didn't have this problem with my other user. Compiz is disable.

2009-10-21T04:32:00.000Z	trygg	jmurans	Yes, atleast I didn't have this problem on the other user. Not 100% it's even an ubuntu-specific problem.
