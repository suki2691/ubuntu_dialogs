2009-12-25T13:48:00.000Z	dnivra	fahadsadah	what is DexterLB trying to do; just wanna know:).
2009-12-25T13:48:00.000Z	fahadsadah	dnivra	Remove the menu, and make it go straight to first kernel
2009-12-25T13:49:00.000Z	dnivra	fahadsadah	isn't it enough if he just hid the menu and set timeout to 1 or something?
