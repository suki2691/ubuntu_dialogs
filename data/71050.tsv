The domain of VPN network is added as primary search domain name, all entried in my /etc/resolv.conf in overwritten with new found dns server.. i cannot ping other servers in local network, i cannot connect to remote ssh server .. nothing works.. Also, I am not a sysadmin , know a little in networking and routing.. just a developer

2009-01-22T14:49:00.000Z	rskumar_	CoUrPsE|DeAd	but there is some method to add routing which works conditionally.. packet defined for VPN domain is sent through the tunnel following other route
