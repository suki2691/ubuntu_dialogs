2012-02-17T02:05:00.000Z	jhk		Hey guys, I have a Nvidia Quadro NVS 295 video card. It works fine in Windows and I did a stress test on it just to make sure. I have updated to the latest Nvidia drivers in Ubuntu. After about 1-2 hours in X, it just freezes and the screen starts getting all pixelated and everything. I'm not sure what the issue is. Any ideas?
