2011-01-29T13:53:00.000Z	damo22	Fudge	if you are trying to recover data from a dead disk, i suggest mounting it read only and dd the whole disk to an image somewhere else
2011-01-29T13:54:00.000Z	Fudge	damo22	 I could do that, the drive has my fs on it and had a primary partition of 980gb or so, i was resizing it to utilise some unpartitioned space when X died where gparted was running.
