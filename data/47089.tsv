2009-09-23T03:45:00.000Z	haris		In bash of course

2009-09-23T03:47:00.000Z	haris	remo234	ok here's what I want. first I did "which gconftool" and the output was /usr/bin/gconftool .. next I want to do a "file" on that. So I could do file `which gconftool` but I don't want to type `which gconftool` again .. get what I am saying?
