2011-01-22T14:24:00.000Z	wmorri	tutysra	is the typo in some of the documentation? I am on the docs team and can look at it in the next couple of days. I would need a link though.
2011-01-22T14:38:00.000Z	tutysra	wmorri	it is not in the documentation. It is there in the package description that appears when we select more info from the package list
2011-01-22T14:39:00.000Z	tutysra	wmorri	not sure whether that comes under the documentation part
