2006-05-13T08:00:00.000Z	Mortuis		When I run apt-get upgrade it tells me "0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 1 not upgraded.", what does this mean 1 not upgraded?  Did I mess something up last time I ran it?

2006-05-13T08:01:00.000Z	spikeb	Mortuis	you didn't mess anything up. it just means it probably needs dist-upgrade instead of upgrade
