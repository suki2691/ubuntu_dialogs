2006-05-13T07:44:00.000Z	Claian		hey guys, just trying out ubuntu, and i've hit a bit of a problem using the update/install system.   as i'm in australia it trys to connect to http://au.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu.  my problem is that for some reason it keeps loosing the connection to this address,      So i was wondering if anyone could point me in the direction of a list of other servers i could try connecting to instead. Thanks in advance for any assistance
