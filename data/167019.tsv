2006-09-21T13:31:00.000Z	rem__		Hey I have a question .. when i try to install ubuntu with the "install" icon the window that then opens is too big (I cant go to the "next" button"), it is cze the screen resolution is set to 640x480. I cant change this in X, and in xorg it lists the others 800 and 1024. The graph card and monitor support at least 1024 .. What can I do ??
