2004-12-30T15:44:00.000Z	tomchuk	Dko	seems win98 is trashing your mbr, lilo probably won't help that
2004-12-30T15:44:00.000Z	tomchuk	Dko	if your BIOS has a setting to write-protect the MBR that would be best
2004-12-30T15:56:00.000Z	tomchuk	Dko	hmm, well I don't know what to say except get rid of Win 98 :)
