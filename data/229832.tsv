2005-12-07T11:57:00.000Z	feenix		Ok not to be a bother, but installed the open ssh server and I tried to execute sshd and it says to re-exec with absolute path, but I do a find * | grep "sshd"
2005-12-07T11:57:00.000Z	feenix		and nothing comes up
2005-12-07T11:57:00.000Z	bimberi	feenix	did you install via apt-get (or synaptic)?
2005-12-07T11:58:00.000Z	bimberi	feenix	it should have started by default (but see carthik otherwise)
