2010-10-29T20:44:00.000Z	nunatak		Since updating to Maverick (10.10) my brother DCP-120c scanner won't be recognized. The printer works still fine and all drivers and entries are done. Someone a clue?
2010-10-29T20:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nunatak	reinstall the driver from the brother site
2010-10-29T21:05:00.000Z	nunatak	ActionParsnip	ok, I'll try it
2010-10-29T21:15:00.000Z	nunatak	ActionParsnip	yes! thank you, that was easy. It runs again.
