2010-05-11T00:48:00.000Z	lepine		Can anyone recommend an applet that's meant to count time you spend on stuff, some kind of stop watch I can use to time work time for clients?
2010-05-11T00:49:00.000Z	mickster04	lepine	have you even tried googling it? that isnt an ubuntu help question
2010-05-11T00:50:00.000Z	lepine	mickster04	yes, I have googled. I found 'stopwatch' (obviously enough) ... but it's rather ugly.
2010-05-11T00:51:00.000Z	mickster04	lepine	well again go to #ubuntu-offtopic for that kind of thing
