2010-05-19T19:38:00.000Z	ProfessorWC		Hey guys, new to Ubuntu, and have been tasked with creating a script to install either 32 or 64 but ubuntu with specified versions of a few applications (gcc, java, postgresql, and a couple others)..can anyone point me in the right direction?
2010-05-19T19:39:00.000Z	jrib	ProfessorWC	is that what you want?
2010-05-19T19:40:00.000Z	ProfessorWC		We are setting up a ubuntu server here, so my understanding is they want to be doing all of this over the network.
