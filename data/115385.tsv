2007-10-31T14:50:00.000Z	gluonman		I have a question directed to anyone. I'm trying to properly understand the directions to install Windows Media Player 6.4. (http://tsx.nl/index.php?p=wmp4linux), but I'm not clear on the directions.

2007-10-31T14:52:00.000Z	kbrooks	gluonman	dont install wmp on linux, there are better tools. also try to avoid unnecessarily saying "i have a question directed to anyone"
2007-10-31T14:53:00.000Z	gluonman	kbrooks	wmp 6.4 is on the wiki.wine website of compatible applications.
