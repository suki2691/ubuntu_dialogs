2007-08-08T08:21:00.000Z	lil-g-man		if a young new fan of ubuntu (like me) has a question, can the question be asked here?
2007-08-08T08:22:00.000Z	lil-g-man		are all programs that have 'K' in the front like Kword and so on, do those programs work only on KDE environment?
2007-08-08T08:23:00.000Z	kingKonqueror	lil-g-man	also not all K programs are actually meant for KDE, just 99% of them ;) like K3D isn't for instance
