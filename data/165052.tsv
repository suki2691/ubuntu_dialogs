2007-07-04T08:49:00.000Z	squee_		I'm ssh'ed into another machine, and I want to run fullscreen video on that computer's display.  How do I do that?
2007-07-04T08:50:00.000Z	dm	squee_	x11vnc is one way
2007-07-04T08:51:00.000Z	squee_	dm	Isn't there something like 'DISPLAY=:0, command' i've done it before but I can't remember.  I can't use vnc because I want to run video
2007-07-04T08:52:00.000Z	dm	squee_	I don't know very well how X and its displays works ... x11vnc is what I would do ;-)
