2006-01-28T09:43:00.000Z	fenterbug		Are the web forums down for maintenance or something? I time out when trying to get to http://www.ubuntuforums.org/
2006-01-28T09:44:00.000Z	fenterbug		so bad web forums is... not uncommon. I'm guessing that no one can say when they'll be up again?
2006-01-28T09:45:00.000Z	fenterbug		tks, yigal-epw... I'll check back in a day or two.
2006-01-28T09:45:00.000Z	MCskill-it	fenterbug	yigal-epw , any idea of what happened to the forums?
