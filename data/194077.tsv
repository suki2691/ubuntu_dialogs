2006-03-20T09:30:00.000Z	Falstius	titan	why don't you just use the most recent wine (which probably has the patches?)
2006-03-20T09:31:00.000Z	titan	Falstius	not to versed in linux yet so I wanted to follow the tut on the Ubuntu forms for now rather than deviate.
2006-03-20T09:32:00.000Z	Falstius	titan	okay.  It might be easier for you to just grab the most recent wine (and not have to compile it).  You can add the winehq repository to your apt/sources.list and voila.
