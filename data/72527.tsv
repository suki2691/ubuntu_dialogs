2008-12-19T00:27:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Ward1983	i would think so, yes
2008-12-19T00:32:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	Ward1983	yeah, unetbootin works though. it will copy makke a bootable usb stick. but it does want to put all data at the front of the usb stick. after that, you can put data on the remainder of the usb stick i believe
