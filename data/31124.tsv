2011-09-30T12:49:00.000Z	Klojum		Anyone can help me getting rid of a wrongly created subdirectory, which now claims to be 'not empty'?  If I want to change directory to it, bash says: 'Permission denied'.. :-\
2011-09-30T12:49:00.000Z	theadmin	Klojum	sudo rm -rf your_directory
2011-09-30T12:52:00.000Z	Klojum	theadmin	thanx, it did the trick. Trying to copy some files from the WindowsXP partition, as root, because otherwise the LAMPP packages has no access...
2011-11-06T10:07:00.000Z	theadmin	Klojum	There's no such version...
