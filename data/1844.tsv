2012-07-31T00:49:00.000Z	simplew		i have added myself to group root, but i continue not being able to have write permissions on dirs owned by root, anyone can explain why?
2012-07-31T00:50:00.000Z	romy420	simplew	most people use 'sudo' to gain root permissions
2012-07-31T00:51:00.000Z	simplew	romy420	this is not the case
2012-07-31T00:51:00.000Z	romy420	simplew	with ubuntu it is the case. this is a security feature
