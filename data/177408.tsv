2011-01-14T14:23:00.000Z	Noorman		ssh to the machine and it appears full responsive
2011-01-14T14:24:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	Noorman	do you mean that after you see no icons, starting ssh from somewhere will trigger them to show?
2011-01-14T14:26:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	Noorman	This session isn't allowed to show that user the same icons perhaps? Just throwing that out there as a few things to check
