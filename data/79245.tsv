2009-01-09T02:31:00.000Z	gnute		is there a way to revert a users settings to the default settings for a new user? tried deleting .gnome2*, didn't do it
2009-01-09T02:31:00.000Z	Seveas	gnute	settings are in .gconf mostly (when it's gnome apps)
2009-01-09T02:32:00.000Z	Seveas	gnute	which setting are you trying to revert?
2009-01-09T02:37:00.000Z	gnute	Seveas	thanks, that did it. LtL, trying out different distros, but keeping the home of the user (on a separate partition). The old settings folders makes the desktop stay the same across installs.
