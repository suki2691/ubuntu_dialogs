2006-09-08T11:42:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	caseyomah	add to fstab defaults,rw,uid=000
2006-09-08T11:42:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	caseyomah	the uid is really what sets 777 permissions
2006-09-08T11:43:00.000Z	Gevaudan82	caseyomah	shouldn't have gone by memory...should basically be this adjusting your paths accordingly:  /dev/sdb1 /media/MAXTOR vfat defaults,auto,rw,umask=000 0 0
