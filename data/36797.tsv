2010-02-22T18:30:00.000Z	airstrike		hi. i have custom fonts installed (e.g. helvetica) and i'm able to use them in every app except OpenOffice because they're not in the drop down list. how can i fix this?
2010-02-22T18:31:00.000Z	w8ing4lucid	airstrike	tried running fc-cache ?
2010-02-22T18:32:00.000Z	airstrike		they've been installed for ages and i've been using them for a while in other apps, so i don't think fc-cache will do the trick
2010-02-22T18:33:00.000Z	airstrike	w8ing4lucid	any other ideas?
