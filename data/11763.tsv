2011-09-14T01:41:00.000Z	johughes	zykotick9_	thanks, I have ia32-libs installed, and I've checked everything with ldd to make sure it can resolve all of the dynamic dependencies
2011-09-14T01:42:00.000Z	johughes	zykotick9_	I was just wondering if there were any known issue with dlopen()'ing a 32-bit lib on a 64-bit OS
2011-09-14T01:42:00.000Z	zykotick9_	johughes	sorry i don't even know what dlopen is.  Good luck.
