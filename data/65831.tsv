2009-02-19T17:04:00.000Z	giacomo__		I've messed something up with the sendmail. I was trying to send email from a local apache+php server using phpmailer library+sendmail, but something is not working at service level and I can't trace the problem because every /var/log/mail* log is empty and none of the are being written. How can I quit this stuck point?
