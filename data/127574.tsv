2008-01-08T10:00:00.000Z	Creed		Im doing a report on Linux and was wondering, what is the correct term of the command line only thing on F2-6?
2008-01-08T10:00:00.000Z	ali1234	Creed	the console?
2008-01-08T10:01:00.000Z	Creed	ali1234	/ PurpZeY really? Thought it was something else...tty...what does tty stand for?
2008-01-08T10:03:00.000Z	ali1234	Creed	see also man chvt. tty originally stood for teletype i believe
