2010-08-06T19:51:00.000Z	tweepcat		hi, i want to delete the mbr and partition table, and i have been told to use this command: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512 count =1. However, I get the error dd: unrecognized operand `count'. Can anyone help?

2010-08-06T19:54:00.000Z	drelyn86	tweepcat	like "count=1" instead of "count =1"?
