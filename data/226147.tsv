2007-10-22T06:43:00.000Z	sohum		hi all. i'm having a small problem where after an apparently random amount of time, compiz fusion defaults to the last non-custom setting it was on. i can set it back to custom, and it will work again, until it defaults again. what could be causing this and how would i fix it?
