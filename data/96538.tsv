2008-03-25T05:20:00.000Z	Monkey_arma		the main problem i have with xchat is that the input box is small
2008-03-25T05:20:00.000Z	Gnea	Monkey_arma	have you taken a look at some xchat scripts to see if any of them expand it?
2008-03-25T05:22:00.000Z	Monkey_arma	Gnea	no i have not ....really though that should not need a script...the designers of xchat should allow altering size of input box..i think its crazy
