2006-03-29T10:29:00.000Z	veldorzvizzerd		hello again, I've been trying to find a VoIP client that works well with both windows and linux, I found one here -> http://www.gizmoproject.com/download-linux.html - only problem is that now I'm not sure which linux package I should install and whether the one for these linux flavours would be compatible with ubuntu breezy badger - any ideas, soundray?

2006-03-29T10:31:00.000Z	veldorzvizzerd		cheers graft :)
