2006-03-05T10:32:00.000Z	cxd	dooglus	it doesn't change system time, but eveyrithng in ubuntu readjusts time with your time zone if uses UTC is enabled
2006-03-05T10:33:00.000Z	dooglus	cxd	I disagree.  But there's no point arguing about it.
2006-03-05T10:34:00.000Z	cxd	dooglus	as you say... gets the job done.
