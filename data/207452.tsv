2006-08-08T09:45:00.000Z	Bob535		Question: Sound in Firefox does not seem to work for me
2006-08-08T09:45:00.000Z	Bob535		I have sound running in my games through cedega, and in programs like rythmbox. So I know it does work
2006-08-08T09:46:00.000Z	oskude	Bob535	firefox doesnt play any sounds by it self...
2006-08-08T09:47:00.000Z	oskude	Bob535	so it would be a problem with the "plugin" that plays them...
