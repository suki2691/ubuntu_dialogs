2011-12-21T14:47:00.000Z	mcsmurf		hi, is it possible to install a newer libc6 than shipped on Ubuntu 10.04 or would I likely end up with a broken system :O? problem is I need glibc 2.14 for a program
2011-12-21T14:47:00.000Z	mcsmurf		I've read glibc is backwards compatible, but only if same compile options and so are used
2011-12-21T14:47:00.000Z	mcsmurf		ok
2011-12-21T14:47:00.000Z	SunTsu	mcsmurf	messing with glibc can result in very bad things happening
