2005-10-21T09:45:00.000Z	noirequus	zenlunatic	yes, checkinstall does require version numbers in the fields
2005-10-21T09:46:00.000Z	zenlunatic	noirequus	what do you mean version numbers?
2005-10-21T09:47:00.000Z	noirequus	zenlunatic	when checkinstall shows you the screen with pkg name, version, bleh blah, and asks if all is correct, make sure it has version numbers
