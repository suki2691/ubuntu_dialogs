2007-03-01T08:42:00.000Z	colbert		Hello, I'm wondering In Ubuntu 6.10, how do I change the colour of the text on the panels? Like my bottom panel with "Applications" etc. on it, how do I change that text's colour ?

2007-03-01T08:43:00.000Z	CyberCod	colbert	change the theme, see if it impacts that
2007-03-01T08:44:00.000Z	CyberCod	colbert	you know how to change the theme?
