2010-09-13T19:24:00.000Z	Bo|Su		i am at a university. (Already asked the 'IT help) Firefox is not able to open the login page to access the network...nor will opera or chrome.  I have no other problems on any wlan or wifi networks. IT told me the problem was not in the browser settings - which hopefully makes this a submittable question here
2010-09-13T19:25:00.000Z	ViN86	Bo|Su	but you have internet access?
2010-09-13T19:25:00.000Z	ViN86	Bo|Su	ok, so youre trying to access a lan computer?
2010-09-13T19:25:00.000Z	ViN86	Bo|Su	is the IP in your subnet?
