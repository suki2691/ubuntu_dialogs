2006-08-04T13:44:00.000Z	preston	Madpilot	ok...but ubuntuguide is a fantastic resource, official or not
2006-08-04T13:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	preston	it might have gotten better, but it used to have a lot of fairly bad advice - and bad explanations - in it... help.ubuntu.com is better
2006-08-04T13:45:00.000Z	preston	Madpilot	agreed that help.ubuntu.com is very good...but I think the ubuntuguide has come a long way...check it out again sometime if you so desire : )
