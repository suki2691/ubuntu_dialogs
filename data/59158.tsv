2010-01-14T21:34:00.000Z	VCoolio	tsimpson	ok, why?
2010-01-14T21:35:00.000Z	tsimpson	VCoolio	well, it's not strictly necessary in this case, but it makes the regex apply for the whole input, rather than matching once only
2010-01-14T21:35:00.000Z	VCoolio	tsimpson	I see, found it in my long list of sed oneliners; good to remember
