2010-04-10T20:30:00.000Z	darksider		can someone link me to a good starting point for making my own linux distro using ubuntu as a starting point/base? i don't mean the little tweaked-release versions of ubuntu with modified pre-installed apps, i mean a proper distro...i want to start working on it or at least start learning how to do it. it is purely for educational purposes.
