2011-03-27T15:57:00.000Z	kos_		Hello, I corrupted my partition table by deleting one of the partitions and the freed space can't be used now. Is it possible to repair it?
2011-03-27T15:59:00.000Z	kos_		gparted don't see any partitions :/
2011-03-27T16:00:00.000Z	kos_		fdisk shows them correctly i guess
2011-03-27T16:00:00.000Z	soreau	kos_	can you mount them?
