2006-03-15T14:24:00.000Z	natalie		Hello, I have another question to ask
2006-03-15T14:26:00.000Z	natalie		I installed 5.10 and can only access the gdm when I am in recovery mode.  If I boot normally it just freezes.  I already tried reconfiguring xserver-xorg, just not sure what to do now.
2006-03-15T14:27:00.000Z	natalie		I looked through the forums, but I couldn't really find anything that helped with that issue.
2006-03-15T14:27:00.000Z	dyrne	natalie	you using framebuffer?
