2009-12-17T01:40:00.000Z	vs93taras		has anyone had a problem with their mouse and keyboard freezing after a random amount of time?
2009-12-17T01:42:00.000Z	vs93taras		does anyone know anything about the mouse and keyboard freezing up?
2009-12-17T01:43:00.000Z	usr13	vs93taras	Yes, and it's almost always been memory related.  The last was one were only the keyboard word freeze, and even though the memory tested ok, I replaced it, (and a weak cmos battery), and problem solved.
