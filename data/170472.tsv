2006-12-04T17:22:00.000Z	Vincebus		Just installed ubuntu on my p2 300 and was trying to allocate some more space from the 2nd drive that wasn't formatted. I  formatted it as /usr and now I can't get any of the prog's to work..aarggh, help!
2006-12-04T17:23:00.000Z	Vincebus		Do I have to reinstall it or is there an easier way to get the prog's back?
