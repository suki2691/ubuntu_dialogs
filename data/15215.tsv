2012-04-11T00:10:00.000Z	Aufwind		How can I configure a cronjob, that runs every 25 hours (not 24!!) and which should be run let's say 5 times. Is this possible?
2012-04-11T00:11:00.000Z	escott	Aufwind	what do you mean by "run 5 times"
2012-04-11T00:12:00.000Z	Aufwind	escott	Well it should run now then after 25 hours then after 50 hours then after 75 ... and a last time after 125 hours from now on.
2012-04-11T00:13:00.000Z	escott	Aufwind	and then what? if you only want it to run 5 times, and then never again use at
