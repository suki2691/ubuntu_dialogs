2008-12-17T09:03:00.000Z	avis	CarlFK	i referred to him booting into the machine which he removed ubuntu-desktop, i dont see how he could remove ubuntu-desktop from a live cd
2008-12-17T09:05:00.000Z	CarlFK	avis	"get to a console on that compter, " could mean boot the live cd and open a shell
2008-12-17T09:05:00.000Z	avis	CarlFK	your right Carl i should have been more precise i assumed he was on another computer
