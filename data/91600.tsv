2008-07-06T18:24:00.000Z	eviking5		Why can't I access mySQL from other computers on my network?
2008-07-06T18:25:00.000Z	joaopinto	eviking5	because by default mysql is bind to the localhost address. please check your mysql.cnf
2008-07-06T18:25:00.000Z	eviking5	joaopinto	can I just add more binding addresses?
2008-07-06T18:26:00.000Z	joaopinto	eviking5	you should bind to ALL, or to your specific IP, please read the conf instructions
