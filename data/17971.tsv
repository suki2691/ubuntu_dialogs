2011-02-17T23:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alsuna	you may mistakedly use it on a folder then it will delete it, no questions asked. Throwing force options around in general is a really BAD idea and should only be use when necessary

2011-02-17T23:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alsuna	most cases when you want to delete you don't need -f yet people have the bad habit of adding it and its simply not needed
