2007-02-24T17:58:00.000Z	Aggrav8d		i've been trying to google something without success, i hope one of you can help me.  I'm looking for info on how to manage domains more quickly and easily.  ideally I'd be able to manage them through another web page.  anyone know of a page talking about how to do this?
