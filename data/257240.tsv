2005-03-20T14:00:00.000Z	GFXstyLER		does someone know how i could get the java virtual machine on ubuntu?
2005-03-20T14:01:00.000Z	ermo	GFXstyLER	there is no 'canonical' java vm policy in ubuntu..
2005-03-20T14:02:00.000Z	ermo	GFXstyLER	but, out of the several options, I would recommend this version (integrated into dpkg/apt) ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/index.html
