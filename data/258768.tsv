2004-11-13T10:14:00.000Z	eladio		pretz.. do you know how to make it find wlan0
2004-11-13T10:15:00.000Z	pretz	eladio	i have the same problem. nothing in wlan0
2004-11-13T10:16:00.000Z	pretz	eladio	yup! It is not there. I fear there is a lot of work needed, like downloading a driver, and building it into the kernel.
