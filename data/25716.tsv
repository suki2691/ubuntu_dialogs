2011-01-15T20:22:00.000Z	FUMOS		hello everyone on #ubuntu
2011-01-15T20:24:00.000Z	FUMOS		I have a problem watching a .mpg file, it seems to give the least problems in Gnome MPlayer, does anyone here by chance have knowledge of codecs here or something?
2011-01-15T20:24:00.000Z	andycc	FUMOS	what kind of problems do you have?
2011-01-15T20:49:00.000Z	andycc	FUMOS	then it's probably some error in the mpg file (if I recall your problem correctly)
