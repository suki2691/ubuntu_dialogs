2010-12-30T04:29:00.000Z	`s	red2kic	Oh, I see. So no way to upgrade while it's working, right?
2010-12-30T04:31:00.000Z	red2kic	`s	You can't upgrade because they moved old releases to different places. You have to change /etc/apt/sources.list if you want to upgrade. It might be easier to backup everything important and go for lts/latest server installation.
