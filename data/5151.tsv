2012-04-09T07:23:00.000Z	nina666		I have a problem... I'm trying to install vmware on my backtrack.. but Virtual Machine Monitor as well as Virtual Ethernet fails... when I try to start it in GUI as well it says serveral modules should be installed and then the Virtual Network Device fails... I looked through internet, seems to be problem with vmnet and seems that kernel 3.2.6 has lots of problems with vmware... anyone has any suggestions for me how to fix it..??
