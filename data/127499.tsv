2007-07-25T10:30:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	BadMoFo	 what does photomerge do?
2007-07-25T10:31:00.000Z	BadMoFo	Nutubuntu	i scan big paintings once in awhile on an 8x11" flatbed scanner, and sometimes it takes 6 scans to get the whole painting. photomerge takes all the scans and puts them into once image automatically
2007-07-25T10:33:00.000Z	Nutubuntu	BadMoFo	- I got nothin' - thought maybe some of the pano tools might help but IDK anything about that. :(
2007-07-25T10:33:00.000Z	BadMoFo	Nutubuntu	yeah ive investigated that, they're mostly command line tools with once useless gimp plugin that i really cant comprehend
