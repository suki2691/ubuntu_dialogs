2011-08-18T04:48:00.000Z	joallard		I had problems with my nvidia drivers and went to version 173 using "Additional drivers" window. Now I think X won't start back up again. How do I revert?
2011-08-18T04:49:00.000Z	zykotick9	joallard	where you using current before?  perhaps "sudo apt-get install nvidia-current" from a CLI?
2011-08-18T04:50:00.000Z	joallard	zykotick9	I'll try that. I had forgotten I kind of "removed" the 'current' drivers.
