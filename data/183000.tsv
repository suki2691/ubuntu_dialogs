2007-11-16T06:51:00.000Z	BlueRider		Same problem. Can anyone explain me (even in private) how am I supposed to shut down the X server AND be able to do an install (write command line instructions) afterwards?
2007-11-16T06:51:00.000Z	Pelo	BlueRider	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2007-11-16T06:52:00.000Z	Pelo	BlueRider	 do it when you are in the desktop
2007-11-16T06:54:00.000Z	Pelo	BlueRider	 what is it you are trying to do ?
