2011-12-01T00:11:00.000Z	Anomie211	brendan-`	didn't realise it made the probability higher, would like to get it working again though if I could to tide me over until I got a new one
2011-12-01T00:12:00.000Z	brendan-`	Anomie211	i would think if you didn't do anything software wise to corrupt it, it's probably hardware related and is going to happen again
