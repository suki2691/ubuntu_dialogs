2006-06-10T10:06:00.000Z	redrum	ToHellWithGA	wouldnt touch windows x64 with a crane and a pole
2006-06-10T10:07:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA	redrum	i wouldn't touch windows unless i had to do so anyway, but... what's the point of 64 bit computing for everyday uses?
2006-06-10T10:07:00.000Z	redrum	ToHellWithGA	well im running 32 bit windows for gaming, 64 bit linux for everything else - biggest downfall is having an ATi card atm.
