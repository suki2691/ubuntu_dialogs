2007-05-31T07:27:00.000Z	_seanc_	Dexadia	I can't get the setup to set the CD as a primary boot, its only listed as secondary
2007-05-31T07:28:00.000Z	_seanc_	Dexadia	Is there a way at GRUB to use c and force it to activate the .exe on the CD?
2007-05-31T07:32:00.000Z	_seanc_	Dexadia	The CD is running, but GRUB is still coming up
