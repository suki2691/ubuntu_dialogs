2007-03-03T15:04:00.000Z	ethernal		i'm just popping in to ask, did they remove xfs support in the latest kernel? since software update i cant mount my root fs according to boot?
2007-03-03T15:06:00.000Z	eck	ethernal	i doubt it. if they did it is surely a bug
2007-03-03T15:06:00.000Z	eck		check launchpad?
2007-03-03T15:06:00.000Z	ethernal	eck	cheers mate, i thought it was rather weird
