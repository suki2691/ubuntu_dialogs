2007-05-31T09:24:00.000Z	niriven		I use the base install (server) to build my system from base up. Im wondering, how do i get the kernel boot screen, is there an apt package for it?
2007-05-31T09:25:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	niriven	you mean the splash screen? that's done using usplash - if you apt-cache search for it you should find some packages
