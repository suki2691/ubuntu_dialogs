2011-06-15T10:17:00.000Z	Cheri703		if I type "sudo apt-get install chromium" it defaults to some game "chromium-bsu" wouldn't it make more sense to default it to the browser? is that something I can file a bug about?
2011-06-15T10:17:00.000Z	Cheri703		yes, but chromium-bsu is chromium-bsu, not chromium
2011-06-15T10:17:00.000Z	gohdan	Cheri703	that problem has been solved by naming it $-bsu. which is the work around implemented
2011-06-15T10:19:00.000Z	gohdan	Cheri703	 the game was in the debian repo before the browser
