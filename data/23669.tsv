2010-10-28T23:46:00.000Z	wiira	maxwave3	do I have to use --purge option too?
2010-10-28T23:50:00.000Z	maxwave3	wiira	not sure, I've always just done autoremove. It seems that purge would also delete any conf files as well. Sounds perfect for uninstalling apps like apache2 and starting over, but many dependencies don't have configs
2010-10-28T23:52:00.000Z	wiira	maxwave3	ok thanks max
