2007-06-27T08:40:00.000Z	kitche	computa_Mike	look at the configure file it's just a script
2007-06-27T08:43:00.000Z	kitche	computa_Mike	you have to be in the folder of the source code and type ./configure since it's a script in the source directory
2007-06-27T08:45:00.000Z	kitche	computa_Mike	then just run make
