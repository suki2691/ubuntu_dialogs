2010-06-02T08:51:00.000Z	maco	arbir	its for if you want to be a scanner server
2010-06-02T08:51:00.000Z	arbir	maco	weird that this would be installed by default..
2010-06-02T08:52:00.000Z	maco	arbir	not really. youve got a printer/scanner multifunction thingy attached to your computer. you're on a network. someone else on the network wants to print/scan... between cupsd and saned, they can, without having to unplug things
