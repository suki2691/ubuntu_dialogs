2005-06-07T15:06:00.000Z	i3dmaster	JasonF	thought apt-get --purge remove kubuntu-desktop would just work....
2005-06-07T15:06:00.000Z	JasonF	i3dmaster	kubuntu-desktop is a meta-pacakge... doesn't remove all the ones it installs
2005-06-07T15:07:00.000Z	i3dmaster	JasonF	ah ... ok. I did not try it but I might be wrong. I rememeber I installed kubuntu by just using that meta pkg
