2007-03-12T07:58:00.000Z	ecker		i just got me a 15" and a 19" lcd and with both ubuntu/kununtu, when i reboot as soon as i pass grub the monitors go out of range until i get to gdm. anyone why? i change the horiz/vert sync and everything in xorg. i not really sure what the deal is
2007-03-12T07:59:00.000Z	vox754	ecker	that happened to me also, but I don't remember... wait, I changed the driver from "vesa" to my "via"... I can't really recall.
2007-03-12T08:01:00.000Z	ecker	vox754	hmm. well not really sure that would help because then my graphics aren't going to be all that great. because i have the nvidia driver installed =(
2007-03-12T08:02:00.000Z	vox754	ecker	yeah, I tell you. It happened to me, but suddenly it does not anymore...
