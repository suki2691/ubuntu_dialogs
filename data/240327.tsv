'cause I love it as I tried it... so I got a second hd and I'd like to install ubuntu on it, keeping windows as primary OS... what kinda settings should I use for installing or... is anything I should be supposed to take care of?

2006-05-10T15:45:00.000Z	nickrud	hunter85	it will be installed to the mbr of the first drive, and will recognize & set up your windows on the first drive for booting
