2008-05-13T06:52:00.000Z	tinker		I'm on Ubuntu 8.04.  I want to test a live Ubuntu CD.  My systems doesn't seem to be booting from a CD.  How do I get into my bios or is there another way?

2008-05-13T07:00:00.000Z	arrrghhh	tinker	that's why i said look for the message.  they almost always say *something* like "hit del to enter setup"
