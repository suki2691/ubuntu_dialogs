2008-06-04T02:20:00.000Z	james_		hello, what's the command in BASH to display directory usage and or file size?
2008-06-04T02:21:00.000Z	_Ben__	james_	df -h shows each mount but i dont know about folders...
2008-06-04T02:22:00.000Z	_Ben__	james_	if you share the mount via samba you can see it in explorer... thats the only way I could work it out lol im new to ubuntu server
2008-06-04T02:24:00.000Z	_Ben__	james_	fraid I cant really help then sry. I'd be interested to know the exact answer myself... its probably available as a switch on the ls command
