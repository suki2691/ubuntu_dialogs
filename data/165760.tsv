2006-09-30T14:11:00.000Z	NutsOfSteel		i am trying to make a script that logs onto a server and executes some ssh commands. i don't want the script to use any passwords whatsoever, so I created a public/private key pair. everything works fine, except that the script still needs a password the first time it gets executed. do you know what I should do to avoid that?
