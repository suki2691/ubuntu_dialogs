2011-11-29T14:50:00.000Z	MattC		Hi,  I'm having a problem logging into my linux OS.  It starts up fine until the log-in screen, then when I enter my password the screen flashes black and the log-in screen reappears.  Definitely using correct password.  I've tried Ctrl Alt F1 and logging in there, but when I return to the GUI it says it's logged in but still wants a password to unlock the screen, resulting in the same issue
