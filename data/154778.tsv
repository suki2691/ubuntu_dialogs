2007-06-19T13:14:00.000Z	Davasaurous		I'm having some graphics issues, when I start up I just get a blank black screen. Started happening when I enabled my graphics card drivers. I can't use the GUI... Just wondering if anyone could help me either disable my drivers and get in or possibly update them from outside the GUI?
