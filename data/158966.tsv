2006-11-26T17:25:00.000Z	kmarius	nolimitsoya	easytag is good... maybe amarok, too
2006-11-26T17:26:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	kmarius	Pelo, tried easytag, but it seems to make a mess of things... changing tags of files ive never asked it to. am i doing something wrong?
2006-11-26T17:27:00.000Z	kmarius	nolimitsoya	the handling is a bit weird ... you should do a few experiments first (but this goes for many tag apps i guess)
