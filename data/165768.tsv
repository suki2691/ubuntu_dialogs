2007-01-20T16:37:00.000Z	zukero		i have an Intel core 2 duo processor. should I install ubuntu  x86 or x64 version ?
2007-01-20T16:37:00.000Z	Alakazamz0r	zukero	x86
2007-01-20T16:38:00.000Z	zukero	Alakazamz0r	: but the core 2 duo has the 64 bits instruction extensions... would I have trouble using x64 version ?
