2006-01-18T17:22:00.000Z	atbt		Can I just install Windows XP, followed by default Ubuntu 5.10 (simply choosing different partitions on the same harddrive during Ubuntu installation)?\
2006-01-18T17:23:00.000Z	bimberi	atbt	yes that's right, the thing is that XP will take up the whole drive by default.  That's OK though because the ubuntu installer can resize the windows partition - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WindowsDualBootHowTo
