2006-07-10T10:24:00.000Z	Drasla		does anyone know how I can create a folder either on boot, or on inetd initialization?
2006-07-10T10:24:00.000Z	Warbo	Drasla	Put a script containing mkdir in /etc/init.d and read "man update-rc.d"
2006-07-10T10:26:00.000Z	Warbo		OK, I'm tired now. Bye
2006-07-10T10:26:00.000Z	Drasla	Warbo	I thought init.d was just for daemons?
