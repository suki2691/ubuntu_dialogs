2008-04-25T05:56:00.000Z	LainIwakura		I could configur my wireless (Broadcom Corporation BCM94311MCG wlan mini-PCI) connection in Gutsy by installing the broadcom firmwire, then enabling it in "Restricted Driver Manager". Now in Hardy, after I install the firmwire, I cannot locate the firmwire in "Driver Manager" (there is no "Restricted Driver Manager" anymore) in order to enable it. Any ideas? Thanks.

2008-04-25T05:57:00.000Z	ledbettj	LainIwakura	er, I mean "Hardware Drivers"
2008-04-25T05:57:00.000Z	LainIwakura	ledbettj	Yes I know.
