2012-09-12T04:38:00.000Z	client_alive		hey, just a curious thing - is there any way to open a new tab and cd to a location but from the command line? Using lxterminal. I know about ^t and how to do from the gui of that terminal but I wonder if there is a command I can issue that will open a new tab.
2012-09-12T04:40:00.000Z	histo1	client_alive	you have ctrl+altF1-F6 as ttys  is that what you mean?
2012-09-12T04:41:00.000Z	histo1	client_alive	if you want tabs in a tty or split screen I would install screen and use that.
2012-09-12T04:41:00.000Z	client_alive	histo1	not exactly. what I was wondering is if there is a command I can type on the comand line that will open a new tab
