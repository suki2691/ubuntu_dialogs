2007-10-23T05:57:00.000Z	Metal03		Ok, how do I set default screen resolution for my whole computer and NOT just for this user?  I hate that when I start my computer, on the logging screen I'm in 800x600 or something like it
2007-10-23T05:57:00.000Z	Ademan	Metal03	pretty sure there's like a checkbox that says "make default"
2007-10-23T05:57:00.000Z	Ademan	Metal03	yeah it says "Make default for this computer"
2007-10-23T05:58:00.000Z	Metal03	Ademan	I tried with the check and without...  but lemme try it again!!  to be sure!!
