2011-03-16T11:39:00.000Z	Still_Learning		Guys I had chance to try Ubuntu 10.10 Live CD (on my friends computer) and its great ,my question is will it run on my PC (Ati radeon 9550,Intel Celeron 2.6, 2 GB RAM)
2011-03-16T11:40:00.000Z	Still_Learning		But I googled a bit and my graphic card isnt supported anymore with drivers...
2011-03-16T11:41:00.000Z	Still_Learning		Would that make any diffrence for ubuntu?
