2012-09-06T18:11:00.000Z	Twinlator		i can't delete massages in the server.
2012-09-06T18:12:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Twinlator	you may have better luck asking in a thunderbird chat.  But IIRC, there are options in the account settings area about deleting messages
2012-09-06T18:13:00.000Z	Twinlator	ChogyDan	is it #thunderbird?
