2008-01-18T18:38:00.000Z	JackPhil		could smbclient connect to vista share folder?
2008-01-18T18:38:00.000Z	DRebellion	JackPhil	assuming that the shared folder uses samba, yes
2008-01-18T18:41:00.000Z	JackPhil	DRebellion	samba is the default share mode of vista? You know, I tried some times, but failed.
2008-01-18T18:42:00.000Z	DRebellion	JackPhil	well it is vista ;)
