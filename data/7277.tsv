2011-12-08T15:02:00.000Z	SqRt7744	ppppurple	you could delete the partitions
2011-12-08T15:02:00.000Z	ppppurple	SqRt7744	the only partition it make was for the swap
2011-12-08T15:02:00.000Z	SqRt7744	ppppurple	unless you installed it though windows, in which case add/remove apps in windows should do the trick
