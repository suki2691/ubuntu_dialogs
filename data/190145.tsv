2006-06-29T08:32:00.000Z	Lews		When adding a custom line to /etc/apt/sources.list, is there any way to specify that I only want to install certain packages from that source?
2006-06-29T08:32:00.000Z	Warbo	Lews	add the repo, update, install what you want, disable the repo
2006-06-29T08:33:00.000Z	Warbo	Lews	You adding a Debian mirror or something?
2006-06-29T08:34:00.000Z	Warbo	Lews	Then don't do an upgrade then, like I said just install the packages you want then disable it
