2011-03-16T01:06:00.000Z	bullgard	Bruce_Wayne	apt-get purge package-name
2011-03-16T01:07:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne	bullgard	I installed wild-shine-theme which took about 21 Mb after installation.. now even if I do give remove/purge command it says only ~200 KB will be freed!!
2011-03-16T01:08:00.000Z	bullgard	Bruce_Wayne	You probably pulled in other packages too.
