2008-07-12T22:07:00.000Z	keewee		I am having a problem when installing Ubuntu on my friend's computer... maybe you can help... It's a Pentium III 1ghz, 256MB, 30GB drive... I boot from CD, then select to install, it seems OK, starts to load (shows logo with the orange bar moving) and after 2 or 3 minutes the hard drive turns off. Same happens when trying to run as LiveCD. Windows installs OK.
2008-07-12T22:09:00.000Z	keewee		I thought that Ubuntu would need less resources... Windows seems to work a bit slowly but OK.

2008-07-12T22:12:00.000Z	dxdt	keewee	for the most part, however, I disagree with the rest of the channel that it is entirely a requirements issue.  If it were just that the machine is low powered Ubuntu would install, but SLOWLY.  If it isn't installing at all, I get the feeling something else is odd.
