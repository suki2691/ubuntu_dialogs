2012-01-12T03:08:00.000Z	Grymmoire		I tried to put terminal in the launcher since I use it so much, it didn't have an icon and I didn't like that it didn't show when in use anymore, so I removed it from the launch now it doesn't appear there anymore at all so if I minimize the terminal I can't close it
