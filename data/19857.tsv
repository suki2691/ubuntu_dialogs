2012-09-20T21:06:00.000Z	PatrickC		but some things i build require 32 bit to build
2012-09-20T21:07:00.000Z	PatrickC		so would i be better off going your route or just running a VM?
2012-09-20T21:07:00.000Z	OerHeks	PatrickC	since 11.10 ubuntu is multi arch
2012-09-20T21:08:00.000Z	PatrickC	OerHeks	cool.. that still doesn't help the building issue ;)
