2009-04-07T16:16:00.000Z	guja		Hello. I have 8.10 i686. Is it anyhow possible that I "upgrade" it to x86_64??

2009-04-07T16:17:00.000Z	guja	jrib	thanks. And is it at any point harmful that I use 32bit Ubuntu on 64bit processor considering I am using Linux just for fun and still not some serious programming stuff?
