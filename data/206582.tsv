2006-01-06T15:20:00.000Z	halibut		I am about to buy components for a new PC, anything I should take extra care over for ubuntu? I will have AMD socket 939 + nvidia
2006-01-06T15:21:00.000Z	sethk	halibut	if you mean nvidia graphics that's not the best choice for linux
2006-01-06T15:22:00.000Z	sethk	halibut	not better per se, better supported for linux (because nvidia's drivers are closed source)
2006-01-06T15:22:00.000Z	sethk	halibut	I've had good results with intel graphics chips.  But I don't do gaming
