2010-08-05T14:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	the_fool	this « length=34 ; a=$(( $RANDOM % ($length + 1) )) ; echo $a » works here
2010-08-05T14:36:00.000Z	the_fool	erUSUL	I'll try that. MInd if i keep pestering you though? Because I'll need the script to get the number for length on the fly
2010-08-05T14:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	the_fool	#bash may be a better place to ask
2010-08-05T14:37:00.000Z	the_fool	erUSUL	... ^_^" that's a good idea
