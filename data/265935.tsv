2005-07-22T15:05:00.000Z	JingleBells		i've just installed ubunto, my first attempt at using linux, and I notice that the firefox version is 1.0.2 (which is actually 1.0.4 apparently) the latest version, yet the latest version is 1.0.5, how do I go about installing this?
2005-07-22T15:06:00.000Z	tritium	JingleBells	it's not currently available as a .deb package for ubuntu
2005-07-22T15:08:00.000Z	tritium	JingleBells	you can do that, but I'd recommend not installing it in a system directory.
2005-07-22T15:11:00.000Z	tritium	JingleBells	every six months ubuntu has a new release.  It never gets very far behind.
