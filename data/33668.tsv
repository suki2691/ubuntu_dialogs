2010-05-26T01:20:00.000Z	NimbleRabit		If I'm running 2 commands, the first which outputs to "-" (std out), the second which reads from "-" (std in), is there a way I can run the first command on one computer, and the second on a second computer?  Basically how do I take the stdout from the first command, and transfer it to stdin on a second machine for the other command?
