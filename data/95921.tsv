2008-10-19T23:54:00.000Z	jamesish	cwill747	last time I saw an error 17 in grub, I had to unplug the machine and drain the battery on the motherboard to reset the CMOS. Then it worked fine.
2008-10-19T23:55:00.000Z	cwill747	jamesish	well i'd rather like to avoid that. haha
2008-10-19T23:55:00.000Z	jamesish	cwill747	I tried everything else, too. There wasn't any clear reason that the boot drive wasn't being seen, and it worked fine after that.
