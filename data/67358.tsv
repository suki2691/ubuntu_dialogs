2009-02-01T23:46:00.000Z	Lucifer_Cat	miha	ok. etc.local was empty, so i was just wondering.
2009-02-01T23:46:00.000Z	miha	Lucifer_Cat	that's last rc stuff executed
2009-02-01T23:51:00.000Z	Lucifer_Cat	miha	i dunno what context it is, but you are right. a lot of people get bitten by "\\" when they want to do "\\\\" else it comes out as "\"
