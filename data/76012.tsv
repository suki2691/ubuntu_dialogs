2008-11-02T02:03:00.000Z	MaT-dg		I want to use different wallpapers in intrepid with the compiz wallpaper-plugin but nautilus still draws it background on top of it, can I solve this without losing desktop icons (nautilus --no-desktop)
2008-11-02T02:04:00.000Z	crdlb	MaT-dg	no, there is currently no way to make nautilus draw a transparent background (so that the compiz wallpaper would show through it)
2008-11-02T02:05:00.000Z	MaT-dg	crdlb	I thought that was solved now and that's why they included the plugin
