2006-04-05T11:44:00.000Z	technasma		Hello fellow Ubuntu users, complete newbie here... I've just done a server install of Ubuntu - installed X, fluxbox, xterm, abiword, dillo, synaptic, gimp.... abiword and gimp work but Synaptic won't load and I can't get a terminal to load.... any ideas?

2006-04-05T11:46:00.000Z	technasma		I am want a lightweight system and I installed gimp to try and figure out why synaptic wasn't loading
2006-04-05T11:47:00.000Z	frank23	technasma	did you try sudo synaptic in a console?
