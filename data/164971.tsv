2008-10-13T23:47:00.000Z	storm-zen		I attempted to upgrade from gutsy to hardy, and it failed... it's now threatening to run dpkg --configure -a -- does that roll back everything?
2008-10-13T23:47:00.000Z	popey	storm-zen	no, it rolls forward ;)
2008-10-13T23:47:00.000Z	popey	storm-zen	seriously, it "finishes off"
2008-10-13T23:48:00.000Z	storm-zen	popey	One of the things that failed was ubuntu-desktop... should I be alarmed?
