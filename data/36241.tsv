2010-03-04T22:51:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	skjoedt-	I would check if Evolution supports 5.5, it's the most popular
2010-03-04T22:54:00.000Z	skjoedt-	Samus_Aran	Thanks for the advice. Evolution itself doesn't support 5.5, but there is a workaround. Have you got it to work?
2010-03-04T22:55:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	skjoedt-	sorry, no.  I don't use Evolution or Exchange, myself
