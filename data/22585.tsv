2010-11-18T09:11:00.000Z	shelll		hello. firefox completely froze up my entire Ubuntu so I had to do a hard shutdown. Now my icons in Nautilus are default and ugly, they don't change no matter which icons I click in "Appearances". But I do see my panel icons changing. Why is Nautilus behaving this way?
