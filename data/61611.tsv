Do I have to create  a subdirectory inside the opt directory, because if so, I don't know where the opt directory is to start with?

2012-06-23T22:42:00.000Z	resno	nottiredofthis	your user isnt "user"
2012-06-23T22:54:00.000Z	resno	nottiredofthis	you have not installed it, you only unziped the file to the directory
