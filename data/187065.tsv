2011-04-26T00:55:00.000Z	stefan1a		hello?
2011-04-26T00:56:00.000Z	stefan1a		I recently installed ArchLinux, and whenever I boot, I still get the ArchLinux clean grub menu list, but my previous one had many Ubuntu listings, my Windows partition, etc... How can I get my comp to boot and show my old grub menu list?
