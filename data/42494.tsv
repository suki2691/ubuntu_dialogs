2010-12-31T03:24:00.000Z	IsmAvatar		Hey guys, i'm using the ambience theme and I'm having trouble seeing where the scrollbar ends because of the shades of white... Is there any way that I can modify that to make it more obvious?

2010-12-31T03:31:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	aeon-ltd	ok thanks, I'll take a look
