2010-10-27T05:06:00.000Z	noob42		I have recently installed two copies of ubuntu, one on my laptop and one on my desktop. I would like to access the files on my laptop from my desktop. They are both on the same network and I attempted to share a folder using the sharing options dialogue box. I don't know how to get to those files on my desktop.
