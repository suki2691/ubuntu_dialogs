2010-08-07T03:02:00.000Z	tripleb-mirc		I have a new 1T drive. I am going to install Ubuntu on it all one partition. Can I split up the partiton later? Is there any advantage doing it this way. If I leave a section not partitioned then I will have to add a partition on it anyway. Is there the primary and extended partion thing in Ubuntu? I have never used 10.04 -- Is it less efficient (slower?) than 9.10? How long will it take to
