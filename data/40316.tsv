2009-12-23T03:42:00.000Z	Solorvox	madagascar27	that looks like a recovery shell.  Did you read the error(s) above those lines?
2009-12-23T03:43:00.000Z	Solorvox	madagascar27	I assume you get that after you try and boot?  Have you tried running fsck?
2009-12-23T03:46:00.000Z	Solorvox	madagascar27	sorry, I don't use/know anything about wubi, can't help you.
