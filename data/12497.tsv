2011-09-27T09:18:00.000Z	thenickperson		I'm having trouble finding my sound drivers, should I just reinstall my sound drivers with "sudo aptitude --purge reinstall linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils linux-image-`uname -r` linux-ubuntu-modules-`uname -r` libasound2"? I'm just worried, will this delete anything other than my sound config?
