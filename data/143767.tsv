2007-05-01T11:44:00.000Z	gesus		hello.  i've searched google but couldn't really find anything helpful. this is pretty much a n00b question --> is it possible to add an shortcut to a web address in a normal ubuntu folder??  for example, say i wanted to add an icon on the desktop which linked to "www.ubuntu.com" ??

2007-05-01T11:46:00.000Z	asc		(probably, anyway.  I haven't tried it, but it ought to work....)
2007-05-01T11:47:00.000Z	gesus	asc	thankyou. where could i find the exact syntax?
