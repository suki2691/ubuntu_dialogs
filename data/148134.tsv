2007-04-21T08:25:00.000Z	ZombiekE		hello I would like to resize my current linux partition, however gparted doesn't let me do it... how can I enlarge it with the extra space?
2007-04-21T08:25:00.000Z	slyfox	ZombiekE	you have to unmounit first with gparted before uou can do anything with it
2007-04-21T08:26:00.000Z	ZombiekE	slyfox	but it is my current linux install, is it safe?
2007-04-21T08:26:00.000Z	slyfox	ZombiekE	then you have to either burn a gparted iso and have this disk for future and use it now and boot form it and resize your partition, or boot with the live cd and use gparted from there
