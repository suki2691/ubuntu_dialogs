2009-05-04T16:01:00.000Z	stz184		after clean install /not upgrade/ ubuntu 9.04 I can't access the ext3 volume from Windows (i have installed ext2/3 driver)
2009-05-04T16:02:00.000Z	ziroday	stz184	yes you can't as the inode size is too large
2009-05-04T16:02:00.000Z	stz184	ziroday	is there any solution?
2009-05-04T16:02:00.000Z	ziroday	stz184	and there is no fix, short of reformatting and making the inode size smaller
