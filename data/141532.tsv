2008-12-07T03:58:00.000Z	hou5ton		I have 8.04 working fine on this system .. is there a real compelling need to update it to 8.10?
2008-12-07T03:58:00.000Z	EightEleven	hou5ton	If it is working fine, I think it's best to keep it as is.
2008-12-07T04:02:00.000Z	EightEleven	hou5ton	I have the impression that 8.10 is not completely finished yet.
2008-12-07T04:03:00.000Z	hou5ton	EightEleven	emilien : sounds good ... thanks for the advice ...
