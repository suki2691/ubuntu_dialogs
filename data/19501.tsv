2011-08-15T16:42:00.000Z	prod_		hi all, i could do with some help. Im trying to fix my broken Xorg.conf so i have booted a live CD but cannot find Xorg.conf file
2011-08-15T16:42:00.000Z	usr13	prod_	Live CD will not use xorg.conf  file.
2011-08-15T16:43:00.000Z	usr13	prod_	  Basically, the way it works now-days is that you only need xorg.conf file if you have a proprietary driver.
2011-10-18T22:37:00.000Z	prod_	usr13	i have the same issue with login, cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log doesnt have any gaping errors
