2009-06-10T19:57:00.000Z	buttons840		can i ask some advice: Ubuntu is the only distro i've used, and the community is very helpful and friendly to new users.  a prospective job/project i may be involved with uses centos and i've considered switching.  How much different will centos be?  I know I wll have to use yum instead of apt, how different is yum?  Also, will centos have such a newbie friendly community to help me?
