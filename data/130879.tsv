2008-02-22T07:44:00.000Z	Nubbie	arrrghhh	there is a vpn extension for network manager, i forget what the package is called though.
2008-02-22T07:45:00.000Z	arrrghhh	Nubbie	network-manager-pptp?  yea... i'm using kubuntu, and knetworkmanager i guess sucks or something.  there's a crappy suggestion on the bugs list that suggests using network-manager-gnome and network-manager-pptp to setup the vpn, then use knetworkmanager to connect to the vpn.  i have yet to get that workin.
