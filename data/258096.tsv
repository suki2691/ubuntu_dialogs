2005-12-03T09:53:00.000Z	fizzle		hey i got ubuntu but when i installed it before it ran slow because i only have 128mb of memory. is there any way to free memory to make it run smoother?

2005-12-03T09:55:00.000Z	Xenguy	fizzle	that sounds like sufficient hardware to me
2005-12-03T09:55:00.000Z	Xenguy	fizzle	anyway, xfce4 is worth a look
