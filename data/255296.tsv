2006-03-01T06:21:00.000Z	arielhi		hello i was wondering if anyone could help me i installed ubuntu and the xorg file didn't detect my correct display and it won't start gdm and now i am running knoppix to try to get help
2006-03-01T06:22:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	arielhi	get the xorg file that knoppix created and put it on a CD or something and just put that in the place for ur ubuntu install
2006-03-01T06:23:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	arielhi	probably in /etc/X11/
2006-03-01T06:23:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	arielhi	sounds like a question to ask in #knoppix or something
