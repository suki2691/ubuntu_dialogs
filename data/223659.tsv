2005-08-26T12:25:00.000Z	asfra		hi, I have a nfts-partition on the beginning of my harddrive and I want to make that an ext3-partition. Do I risk destroying anything important? like bios or anything used to boot? I know that linux doesn't use MBR but want to be sure :) thanks...

2005-08-26T12:30:00.000Z	asfra	str8edge	thanks for the reply, do you think that the MBR could be on the nfts-partition? it used to contain xp
