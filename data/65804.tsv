2009-03-25T17:24:00.000Z	Pepelargo		is there any tool to calibrate my laptop's battery?
2009-03-25T17:25:00.000Z	zash	Pepelargo	charge it full and let it run down a few times
2009-03-25T17:27:00.000Z	Pepelargo	zash	it doesn't work, I have done that for several times, and the battery just last for a few minutes, sometimes I ingore the ibernate message and it lasts for half an hour...The laptop has 1 year now
