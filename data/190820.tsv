2010-06-18T10:03:00.000Z	AAA	xformulax	 sounds like that link he posted is for you then
2010-06-18T10:03:00.000Z	AAA	xformulax	 and the usb is your media for installation of said ubuntu, correct?
2010-06-18T10:04:00.000Z	AAA	xformulax	 If you can install the the system with the usb then do so. if after rebooting you have no network, I will help you make it work
