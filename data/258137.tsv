2005-11-15T09:34:00.000Z	henriquemaia		Hello, I'm trying to use cron (as normal user) on my ubuntu, but it looks like it is not working. Anyone knows something about this?
2005-11-15T09:35:00.000Z	Xenguy	henriquemaia	crontab -l and crontab -e
2005-11-15T09:36:00.000Z	Xenguy	henriquemaia	I guess you could paste it (not here tho)
2005-11-15T09:37:00.000Z	Xenguy	henriquemaia	most likely a syntax error
