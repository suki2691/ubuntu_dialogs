2010-09-21T06:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest59613	 and your ram is how much?
2010-09-21T06:59:00.000Z	Guest59613	Dr_Willis	1.75 GB.  Is the higher amount of swap space the better? Is it okay to have 4 GB swap space?
2010-09-21T07:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest59613	 4gb may be overkill if its never used. but it wont hurt.
