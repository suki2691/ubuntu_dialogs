2007-11-19T09:35:00.000Z	LancerDragoon		er, that was intended for Kingmilo
2007-11-19T09:36:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	LancerDragoon	is ccsm the name of the package as well?
2007-11-19T09:36:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	LancerDragoon	i think not! or, at least apt-cache search can't find anything. i'm running feisty either way. Kingmilo should be running Gutsy though
