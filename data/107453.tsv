2010-05-16T19:19:00.000Z	xomp		hello, I can't seem to rid myself of apache to save my life. I have tried apt-get remove apache and it says it's removed but each time I restart my server apache is back listening on port 80. Any idea?

2010-05-16T19:21:00.000Z	sergiusens		as package names
2010-05-16T19:21:00.000Z	xomp	sergiusens	yeah I tried apt-get remove apache and apt-get remove apache2
