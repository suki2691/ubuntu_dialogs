2007-08-26T08:17:00.000Z	linux2		im wondering if anyone here can help me out with this issue im having. I have an ULTRAsparc IIe here and i am new to the whole sparc architecture. Well anyways i have been trying to install linux on it. debian and ubuntu I have both tried but with no luck. Now before i install solaris 10 i had been trying to boot the debian and ubuntu install cds which both stopped at "booting linux....". It seemed to just lock up. so i then installed so

"Illegal Instruction". and then goes back to the OK prompt. Does anyone here have any experiecne with sparc systems. Specifically ultrasparc platforms (64bit). This is a sunblade 100 system. any ideas?
