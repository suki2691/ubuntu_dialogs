2007-07-25T08:28:00.000Z	punsad		I just installed xubuntu on a laptop which I'm going to use as an experimental LAMP server.  I just noticed that inetd wasn't installed by default (unlike debian sarge, which I'm used to).   Are there any other differences with debian that might be helpful to know?
2007-07-25T08:28:00.000Z	punsad		one of there reasons I switched to ubuntu is that debian wouldn't 'just work' with my atheros based wifi card
2007-07-25T08:30:00.000Z	punsad		can anyone tell me the major differences (configuration wise - not so much philosophy) between debian and ubuntu?
