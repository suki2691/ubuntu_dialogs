2009-05-18T02:52:00.000Z	ripps		Can someone help me with some regex? I'm trying to write a debuild scritpt that will ignore debian.* but not the debian directory
2009-05-18T02:52:00.000Z	Slart	ripps	you mean you want something that returns the files but not the folders?
2009-05-18T02:54:00.000Z	ripps	Slart	not exactly, I'm trying to clean up some litian logs by having the debuilder ignore some backup debian directories I keep for backports. I have a main debian that swap out with debian.karmic,debian.jaunty,etc.
2009-05-18T02:55:00.000Z	Slart	ripps	ahh.. ok...
