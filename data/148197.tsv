2007-01-22T08:33:00.000Z	deafboy		I got a pal that I got to try ubuntu. He went to install it and resize his ntfs partition and it took forever. It eventually finished. He rebooted and now his windows partition says that it has used the old used space + his new ubuntu partition space. But inside windows it shows the correct partition size. but in Gparted it doesn't show the correct size. Is there anyway to remedy this?
