2008-12-26T06:54:00.000Z	foznot		i have tried 3 different keyboards and none of them will tab complete words in a terminal, any suggestions?
2008-12-26T06:54:00.000Z	Khisanth	foznot	which shell are you using?
2008-12-26T06:58:00.000Z	Khisanth	foznot	bash, csh, tcsh, zsh, ... but you already answered that
2008-12-26T06:58:00.000Z	Khisanth	foznot	I have only had the opposite problem get completion where I didn't want it :)
