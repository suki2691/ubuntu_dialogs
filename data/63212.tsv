2009-03-22T21:11:00.000Z	user___	TwoToneSpirit	you need to edit /etc/fstab with a gui or terminal editor
2009-03-22T21:11:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	user___	Yeah, I know about /etc/fstab.  But for someone who is less comfortable editing a config file, there isn't, at this time, a way to do it with a menu-driven method?
2009-03-22T21:12:00.000Z	user___	TwoToneSpirit	dont know of one, had a quick gui browse only, though.
