2010-05-04T13:00:00.000Z	ectospasm		I'm having a brain fart (too much stuff going on in my life), what's the command to upgrade from 9.10->10.04, using apt-get or aptitude?  I'm thinking "aptitude dist-upgrade..." Am I correct?
2010-05-04T13:01:00.000Z	wizard_	ectospasm	sudo apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
2010-05-04T13:01:00.000Z	wizard_	ectospasm	you could open the update manager GUI and do it that way too.
2010-05-04T13:02:00.000Z	ectospasm	wizard_	yeah, I knew that
