2011-03-24T12:33:00.000Z	riptly		Is there a reason why x86 version of ubuntu 10.10 is recommended? I installed the x86 v. but I feel I'm not using my computer to full potential by not running the x64 version? I'm a completely new ubuntu user.

2011-03-24T12:34:00.000Z	riptly	critical_max	well I installed Ubuntu mainly to use and learn for everything. So gaming (under Wine), Python development, Apache and the utilities alike. But those shouldn't be any problem?
