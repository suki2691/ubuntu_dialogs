2007-01-04T07:50:00.000Z	Darxus		oh duh it says it won't install a gui
2007-01-04T07:50:00.000Z	derrik	Darxus	you can install a gui desktop from the command line after installing the server that's what i did
2007-01-04T07:53:00.000Z	Darxus	derrik	I figured that was possible, thanks (but I'm pretty sure he won't want the gui)
