2011-03-17T18:26:00.000Z	rizzuh		I'm experiencing UI freezes on Ubuntu 10.10 (all update as of 1 hour ago, including proprosed and backports); no single UI element (except for web pages, but buttons, pop-ups, etc.) respond, at all. How can I fix it?
2011-03-17T18:26:00.000Z	elFidel	rizzuh	i would start by checking the logs
2011-03-17T18:30:00.000Z	elFidel	rizzuh	why? reboot and see if problem still exists
2011-03-17T18:30:00.000Z	rizzuh	elFidel	I meant reproducing it on a system without proposed.
