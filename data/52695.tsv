2009-07-12T22:20:00.000Z	Edijusz	Dr_Willis	Whats the solution now?
2009-07-12T22:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Edijusz	 im not even sure what your problem is.. but people are constantly trying to 'remove pulse audio' to get wine or somthing working.. when all they really need to do is disable the specicif app from using pulse audio. not UNINSTALL pulse audio.
