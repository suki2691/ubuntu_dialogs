2009-02-20T22:44:00.000Z	mlissner		I have a question about upgrading software?
2009-02-20T22:44:00.000Z	mlissner		if I want to upgrade past the version in the repos, is there any intelligent way to do that?
2009-02-20T22:44:00.000Z	mlissner		I mean, so I don't have conflicts and problems down the road?
