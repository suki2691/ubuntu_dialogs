2007-06-30T15:19:00.000Z	kinection		hello, i have a friend who will be installing windows after a install of ubuntu. since this will screw up his MBR, i'm wondering if the ubuntu-livecd has any tools that will allow him to fix the MBR so that it also has an entry for windows without needing to edit his menu.lst ?
