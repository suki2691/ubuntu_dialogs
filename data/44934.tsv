2012-10-19T03:53:00.000Z	Draton		hey guys - quick 12.10 question.  Everything seems to be running fine but I keep getting 3 lines of 'file not found' before grub when booting
2012-10-19T03:54:00.000Z	Draton		I assume they are grub panics, any idea how i can diagnose?
2012-10-19T03:54:00.000Z	almoxarife	Draton	did you have a graphic grub prior?
2012-10-19T03:55:00.000Z	almoxarife	Draton	can't remember which log is strickly for boot sequence, but it is there in var/log/.....
