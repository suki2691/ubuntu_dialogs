2009-06-06T00:32:00.000Z	jmulloy	balzac	there are so many out there ... I have had trouble with atis so far none with with nvidia cards but thats just personal experience.  I usually use Newegg and filter down the best deal ... I mention that because they often have comments from Ubuntu users.
2009-06-06T00:34:00.000Z	jmulloy	balzac	I wouldnt go with anything that doesn't have ati or nvidia.
