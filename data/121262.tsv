2007-09-28T05:55:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe		hello again :)
2007-09-28T05:55:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe		my system currently uses up around 50% ram and 0% swap space, is it possible to make it use a little more swap space instead of the ram
2007-09-28T05:56:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe		if it has idle processes or stuff like that
2007-09-28T05:56:00.000Z	heguru	EvaLuaTe	swap will be used as needed by the kernel, and kernel's memory management is very smart
