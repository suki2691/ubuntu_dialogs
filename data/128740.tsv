2007-09-11T06:22:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	begert	i just throw it on my desktop for compiling
2007-09-11T06:22:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	begert	yes
2007-09-11T06:23:00.000Z	CoasterMaster	begert	although if you want to keep the source around so you can play with it, i guess in your home folder would be a nice place :)
