2012-05-03T11:59:00.000Z	kanliot	linuxfreaker	why would you need to config ubuntu for uefi?
2012-05-03T11:59:00.000Z	linuxfreaker	kanliot	Due to the requirement for the boot disk size over 3TB and application
2012-05-03T12:00:00.000Z	kanliot	linuxfreaker	i think you are a bit confused, but i'm not 100% sure
