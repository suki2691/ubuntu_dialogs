2006-06-02T06:53:00.000Z	Threeseas		question: the ubuntu 6.06 upgrade will work with a breezy badger install that has had some additional packages added ?? yes?
2006-06-02T06:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Threeseas	Yes.  However, you should note that you'll want to make sure ubuntu-desktop is installed before upgrading.
2006-06-02T06:57:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Threeseas	You can confirm it by opening Synaptic and seeing if its box is green.  (It will be there unless you removed one of its dependencies.)
