2006-06-02T06:28:00.000Z	Hemorrhage		Where is the ubuntu (distributor-logo) icon logo located that is on the panel next to "applications"?  I'm using a custom theme and not sure which folder the logo is in as a slocate turns up up like 9 results

2006-06-02T06:29:00.000Z	Hemorrhage	Warbo	ok thanks, just wasn't sure of the right one
2006-06-02T06:30:00.000Z	Warbo	Hemorrhage	It was that in Breezy I think, but I've lost all of my custom icons I made so I haven't bothered changing it in Dapper yet
