2009-03-06T21:54:00.000Z	KeyserSoze		i am using the fglrx driver with my lenovo thinkpad w500 with firegl graphics.  the laptop is plugged into the lenovo advanced mini dock, and my 30" dell 3007wfp is plugged into that.  the 30" monitor looks to be mirroring the laptop display, but the image is severely corrupted
2009-03-06T21:55:00.000Z	KeyserSoze		is there a ubuntu tool for fixing it, or do i need to edit xorg.conf?
