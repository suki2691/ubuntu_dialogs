2011-09-03T08:11:00.000Z	debugnet	Singham	save files to box should have a folder input there, you can usually check the check box next to it and input a folder of your choice then set it to manual so it always asks where to save (obviously that is your option). btw, what are you using to save youtube videos? firefox usually have a temp folder in your home~/.mozilla/firefox/????????.default/Cache folder where the ?'s are random.
