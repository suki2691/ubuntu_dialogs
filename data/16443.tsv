2011-03-29T02:34:00.000Z	Dylan-sama		i have question concerning the iso versions...
2011-03-29T02:35:00.000Z	Dylan-sama		is ubuntu-10.04.2-dvd-amd64.iso a desktop only iso? or does it also include the LTS version with all additional packages?
2011-03-29T02:35:00.000Z	Dylan-sama		ok cool
2011-03-29T02:35:00.000Z	rcconf	Dylan-sama	10.04 is LTS.
