2009-05-21T03:07:00.000Z	Pixels		does a default install of Ubuntu have a FIREWALL ON?
2009-05-21T03:09:00.000Z	mzz	Pixels	ibuclaw: not really "stealthed" according to most definitions of that term I know (ports show up as closed) but that's definitely secure enough unless you shoot yourself in the foot
2009-05-21T03:10:00.000Z	Pixels	mzz	so a default install of Ubuntu DOES HAVE a firewall protection?
2009-05-21T03:10:00.000Z	mzz	Pixels	what kind of "protection" do you want? There are no services listening on non-localhost by default, so there's nothing for a firewall to protect.
