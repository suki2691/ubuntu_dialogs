2010-07-06T04:54:00.000Z	HowardTheDuck		can someone please tell me how to change power management settings for GDM?
2010-07-06T04:55:00.000Z	skreet	HowardTheDuck	I think (and I'm really just making a guess, I suppose) that the power management setting made within your login by going to System > Administration > Power Management would apply to GDM as well.  I believe they are system-wide.

2010-07-06T04:57:00.000Z	skreet	HowardTheDuck	 Hrm, that's surprising.
