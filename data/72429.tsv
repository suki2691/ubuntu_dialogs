2008-12-31T00:26:00.000Z	RivitingOne		Would it be possible to have 2 copies of Ubuntu installed that shared the same partitions? Not sure I'm explaining this right. Like have 2 installs that could access the same program... like I click an icon located on the desktop running on the OS located on Partition A or C and it will access a program on partition B.

2008-12-31T02:05:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	RivitingOne	if you're a plain old desktop user, i recommand 8.10. if you need the utmost in stability or are running a server, then go with 8.04
