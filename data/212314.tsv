2005-10-16T16:19:00.000Z	C-Keen		I am having troubles with burning an isoimage. using cdrecord it tells me that space on the cd is not enough for my image (which is 200MB) the cd is a new fresh-unwrapped-800MB CD-R..any suggestions?

2005-10-16T16:20:00.000Z	C-Keen	gibson	I did. which does not change a thing (k3b uses cdrecord as backend)
