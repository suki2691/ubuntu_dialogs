2006-03-10T12:02:00.000Z	linux2		does ubuntu have a good update system. lets say you installed 5.10 of ubuntu and then wanted to upgrade once the next release was out. can it do that without any problems? most distros get messed up when you try to do that
2006-03-10T12:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	linux2	Absolutely.
2006-03-10T12:02:00.000Z	linux2	jon_	sounds much better than any other distros i have ever used
2006-03-10T12:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	linux2	And it's getting better.  5.10 to 6.04 will still involve editing some lines briefly I believe, but after that I'm told it will be super easy.
