2012-07-31T17:06:00.000Z	GTCharizard		Sorry that I can't help anything, I'm new to Ubuntu. But I can't get Gajm to display in my Ubuntu 10.11? Dashboard
2012-07-31T17:08:00.000Z	islandmonkey	GTCharizard	11.10 is supported here - however are you aware of a new release, 12.04?
2012-07-31T17:10:00.000Z	islandmonkey	GTCharizard	Yes there is. Every version has many more new features
2012-07-31T17:11:00.000Z	GTCharizard	islandmonkey	So you're basically saying that updating it would make Gajim start wor0-ninja
