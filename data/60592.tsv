2010-04-29T19:50:00.000Z	stodorovic		is this a good time to update a machine to 9.10 given that all these impatient people will start hitting the ubuntu servers and mirrors soon ? :(
2010-04-29T19:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	stodorovic	 i would wait  a few days perhaps.
2010-04-29T19:51:00.000Z	stodorovic	Dr_Willis	thought so. unfortunately i cant - client wants machine done asap
2010-04-29T19:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	stodorovic	  then they get to sit through the updates i guess  that it will want.
