2009-12-21T08:58:00.000Z	cactusfrog		hi i running ubuntu off  windows HD with wubi  am having some trouble.  i want to copy some files from one windows hd ( the one i am running ubuntu off)  to another windows hd but it keeps giving me this error "Error creating directory: Operation not supported". I guess it has to do with the difrent file systems but is there way i can get around it?
