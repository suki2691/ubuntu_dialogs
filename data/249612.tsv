2008-05-29T01:19:00.000Z	cl0s		i keep getting this error http://paste.ubuntu.com/15401/ when I try running virtualbox
2008-05-29T01:19:00.000Z	cl0s		i did a sudo apt-get  on virtualbox-ose-modules and -generic
2008-05-29T01:19:00.000Z	cl0s		but i already had them.. any idea what else it could be?
2008-05-29T01:20:00.000Z	Boohbah	cl0s	yes, i had the same issue. i believe i installed the non-OSE binary directly from the virtualbox site and it was fixed
