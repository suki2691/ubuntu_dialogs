2008-12-20T00:31:00.000Z	camerongroom1		no the program
2008-12-20T00:32:00.000Z	hendrixski	camerongroom1	when you visit a website which requires flash, a little thing pops up that asks if you'd like Ubuntu to install flash for you
2008-12-20T00:33:00.000Z	hendrixski	camerongroom1	oh... that thing....  Do you have a Linux version of it? If not, then use Wine to install the .exe  I don't know how well that will work though
