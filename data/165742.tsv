2006-10-01T10:50:00.000Z	mister_roboto	lunaphyte	i'm running edgy right now... just did a s/dapper/edgy on my sources.list
2006-10-01T10:51:00.000Z	lunaphyte	mister_roboto	is there a way to do that without having to modify your sources.list file every time a new release is made?
2006-10-01T10:52:00.000Z	mister_roboto	lunaphyte	not that i know of. i've been doing that for the past 3 releases.  keeps you on the bleeding edge but i don't know if there's just one name like "testing" that you can use. i don't think so
