2010-11-01T06:50:00.000Z	Snakkah		Hello. I was wondering if it's possible to do a minimal install of Ubuntu (just the OS without the GUI) and install a custom GUI on top of it?
2010-11-01T06:50:00.000Z	fredfredfredfred	Snakkah	you can install the server version and theen choose a GUI or you can install Xubuntu for the most minimal GUI
2010-11-01T06:51:00.000Z	fredfredfredfred	Snakkah	it has some stuff that the desktop doesnt obviously so maybe minimal is better
2010-11-01T06:52:00.000Z	fredfredfredfred	Snakkah	may one enquire as to why one wishes to choose any other gui than the eminent GNOME gui that comes with the ordinary ubuntu?
