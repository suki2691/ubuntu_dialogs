2008-07-03T14:04:00.000Z	horizxon	shiftshift	i opened firefox and had it running in the background and when i clicked that link you gave me it opened in it - which is what i want
2008-07-03T14:04:00.000Z	horizxon		it still wont work if the browser wasnt open already
2008-07-03T14:04:00.000Z	shiftshift	horizxon	and you're using xchat?
