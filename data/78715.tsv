2008-09-20T23:48:00.000Z	rmn		i have a set of machines i'm going to administrate remotely.  i will only have a chance at installing after the scheduled release for 8.10-beta but before final.  Will the upgrade to final be cleaner than a similar install of 8.04?
2008-09-20T23:49:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	rmn	I think the answer is yes.  Are you asking about whether or not to do a clean install of the beta, or an upgrade from hardy?  I would choose the beta
2008-09-20T23:50:00.000Z	rmn		excellent.  thanks, Bsims, Flannel and danbh_intrepid .
2008-09-20T23:52:00.000Z	rmn	danbh_intrepid	 it will be a fresh install of either the beta or 8.04 in the second week of october (beta scheduled to the third, was it?).
