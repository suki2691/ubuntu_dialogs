2007-03-08T17:47:00.000Z	Craeo		Quick questionn about a permanent install, I'm in the Windows environment, I have the Ubuntu 6.06 CD, but how do I perm. install the OS on my system using the CD, I see no link or icon to do so?
2007-03-08T17:47:00.000Z	Craeo		Yes, ok
2007-03-08T17:47:00.000Z	Craeo		I tried that once before and the computer froze for some reason
