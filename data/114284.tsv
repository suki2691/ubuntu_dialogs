2007-11-05T08:08:00.000Z	Ellipsys	tonyduke	Great. Have you tried anything OpenGL and 3d?
2007-11-05T08:10:00.000Z	Ellipsys	tonyduke	Are you experiencing any missing textures or anything? I can tell me 3d apps are being accellerated, but the graphics are corrupted for some reason
2007-11-05T08:11:00.000Z	Ellipsys	tonyduke	This is for all sorts of things - WoW under Wine, planet penguin racer etc..
