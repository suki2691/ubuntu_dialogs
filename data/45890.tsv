2011-10-19T09:18:00.000Z	melow01	Bsims	thanks... but soreau already fixed my network issue
2011-10-19T09:19:00.000Z	melow01	Bsims	just asking some follow up questions
2011-10-19T09:19:00.000Z	Bsims	melow01	no problem, I would suggest using gnu screen, it turns any terminal into basicaly a tabbed version and it works over ssh
