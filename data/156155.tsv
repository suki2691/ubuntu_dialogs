2007-04-29T16:07:00.000Z	aoirthoir	Bibagi	if you have a dns server... you wont need to do that
2007-04-29T16:07:00.000Z	aoirthoir	Bibagi	unless you need that computer to have a specific IP address for some reason
2007-04-29T16:08:00.000Z	aoirthoir	Bibagi	for isntance if you have a router connected say to a cable modem..or to a dsl connection..the router should assign all of that automatically.
