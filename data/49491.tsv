2009-09-12T19:10:00.000Z	zebaztian		HELP!!!: I'm having trouble downloading some files from a website, basically when I right click and save link as, it starts to download but the file size is smaller than what it should be, in other words, I am trying to get an mp3 file that's 30 min long and it won't download completely,  only partially, leaving me with a file that ends abruptly, is there a way to download through the terminal?
