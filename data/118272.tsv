2007-11-03T04:47:00.000Z	ch0desmuggler		Hey guys. My xorg crashses when I try to open up a specific program in wine. Is there anyway I can get a log file of it so that I may troubleshoot?
2007-11-03T04:47:00.000Z	kitche	ch0desmuggler	/var/log/Xorg.0.log is the log for X
2007-11-03T04:47:00.000Z	kitche	ch0desmuggler	it might be Xorg.0.log.old also if you restarted X the 0 can be 1 and so on
2007-11-03T04:48:00.000Z	ch0desmuggler	kitche	I see. I'll give that a look over
