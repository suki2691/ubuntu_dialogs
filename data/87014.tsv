2008-08-01T04:11:00.000Z	Qian		I'm having a problem with my wireless card connecting to a WEP-protected network.  If I disable WEP I can connect just fine, but if WEP is enabled it won't let me connect...
2008-08-01T04:12:00.000Z	Blaqlight	Qian	you have to use the WEP key to connect. not your passphrase... I believe
2008-08-01T04:14:00.000Z	Blaqlight	Qian	its case sensitive. make sure your typing it right
2008-08-01T04:15:00.000Z	Blaqlight	Qian	I had to type it exactly as it was generated for it too work.
