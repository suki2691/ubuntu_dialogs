2012-10-17T16:54:00.000Z	ETHelp		i got an intel ethernet device (1503)...i compiled e1000e driver...it is running...but still nothing appears when i do a ifconfig....what am i doing wrong?
2012-10-17T16:56:00.000Z	Gnea	ETHelp	ifconfig just shows what devices are up and doesn't show which aren't
2012-10-17T16:56:00.000Z	Gnea	ETHelp	although, it can be told to show them all
2012-10-17T16:57:00.000Z	Gnea	ETHelp	well, the numbers of eth are sequential to the times at which the devices had their drivers loaded
