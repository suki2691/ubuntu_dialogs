When i open up gPHPEdit and click Edit -> open it wont take me to the folder i was working it.... it now shows me recently opened items this is kind of slowing me down as I must constantly search through a conundrum of folders. any suggestions on to make it open the folder i was last working in?

2011-10-15T13:04:00.000Z	xenland	reisio	I will check but i like how my settings were and i never touched them. and my computer is never used besides me... let me check again
