2006-02-20T06:51:00.000Z	Klohunt		Im confused on whether to learn java or C++ :|
2006-02-20T06:51:00.000Z	Klohunt		general stuff: networking, some operating system related stuff
2006-02-20T06:52:00.000Z	Klohunt		for example, what did Google use in making Google Desktop? C++?
2006-02-20T06:52:00.000Z	hyperactivecrond	Klohunt	c++ - .net if you want to be rather portable
