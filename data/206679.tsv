2006-01-19T16:25:00.000Z	sethk	sarah	linux isn't better and windows isn't better.  If your criteria is easy use of a wide variety of printers, then windows is surely better
2006-01-19T16:26:00.000Z	sethk	sarah	I can install a printer on linux in three minutes, but that's because I already know how it is done
2006-01-19T16:26:00.000Z	sethk	sarah	but, absolutely, if you don't care to know about the internals of the o/s, then for this purpose windows is better.
