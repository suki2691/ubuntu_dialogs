2008-03-27T23:30:00.000Z	bpollack1		Hello again.  Yesterday some were helping me with a small issue when I killed my nic.   I have Ubuntu and I'm an experienced FreeBSD admin.  I have a bunch of vmware workstations running.  I'm trying to throttle the virtual nic on a terminal to slow DSL speed so I can see how the experience is for those users.
2008-03-27T23:32:00.000Z	bpollack1		is there anyone around familure with iptables or another method of bandwidth throttling?
2008-03-27T23:32:00.000Z	smiley__	bpollack1	: throttling isnt easy.
