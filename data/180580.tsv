2008-07-02T03:27:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Method2oo7	what's the problem?
2008-07-02T03:29:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Method2oo7	what's not working? probably you need java webstart 6.0 from add/remove programs (all aplications)
2008-07-02T03:29:00.000Z	wolfeySI	Method2oo7	plus runespace probably uses Java3D or jogl, that's another issue
