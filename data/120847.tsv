2007-09-26T09:05:00.000Z	whileimhere		Hi When I go to install Ubuntu I see that gparted reports 41 gig drive but when I actully format it and look at the drive from inside of an installed system it reports that I have a 37 gig drive any idea why?
2007-09-26T09:06:00.000Z	whileimhere		Well a 4 gig diff seems to be a lot
2007-09-26T09:06:00.000Z	xangelo	whileimhere	are you talking aobut when you boot in from a different OS?
