2010-06-16T09:44:00.000Z	mcnellis		how can I find out what date packages were installed on?
2010-06-16T09:46:00.000Z	AAA	mcnellis	 a hackish way might be $ ls -lst /var/cache/apt/archives/
2010-06-16T10:18:00.000Z	AAA	mcnellis	 you need to login to that account again
2010-06-16T10:18:00.000Z	AAA	mcnellis	 a quick check is sudo <username>
