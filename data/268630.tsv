2004-11-13T09:09:00.000Z	wxs		1.1.20final+cvs20040330-4ubuntu16.2 - can someone please explain to me how a person is supposed to know which version of a piece of software is newer when you use strings like that?
2004-11-13T09:11:00.000Z	wxs		so why not leave out the release version - since it isn't a release
2004-11-13T09:11:00.000Z	wxs		it's a cvs snapshot
2004-11-13T09:12:00.000Z	Kamion	wxs	dpkg --compare-versions
