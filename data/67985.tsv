2009-08-08T08:17:00.000Z	monostone	gartral	true, that is a perfect option, but it will only work if he didnt mount it read only
2009-08-08T08:17:00.000Z	gartral	monostone	seeing as he formatted it as ext3.. i would safely bet its read write
2009-08-08T08:18:00.000Z	monostone	gartral	yeah , i see your point
