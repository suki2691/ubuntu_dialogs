2007-10-20T12:15:00.000Z	Jaggs		is there someone in here willing to help me figure out why my wireless is not functioning?
2007-10-20T12:16:00.000Z	IcemanV9	Jaggs	can u elaborate more on your wireless? what kind? is it turned on? is it up and running?
2007-10-20T12:18:00.000Z	Jaggs	IcemanV9	I have a HP Pavilion dv6000, with a broadcom wireless card built in... I believe I have everything for that... ut its not picking anything up at all
2007-10-20T12:18:00.000Z	IcemanV9	Jaggs	ah. broadcom. you'll need nisdiswrapper (sp?).
