Because I have a Mac Mini which I installed Ubuntu Linux on, But I wanted to reinstall OS X and have a partition. But now when I enter the Mac OS X install cd it comes up with a error message saying that install cannot proceed any further cause my harddrive is failing. But I have been running Ubuntu Linux for months now. I have not had any problems. So what solutions I have right
