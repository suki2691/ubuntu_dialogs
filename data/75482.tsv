2008-12-10T21:04:00.000Z	booksbuggy	outboard	what kind of command line did you get?
2008-12-10T21:05:00.000Z	booksbuggy	outboard	does it boot into the desktop after you enter the user name and password
2008-12-10T21:05:00.000Z	booksbuggy	outboard	not asking them just wondering if it went to the place
