2005-06-18T06:44:00.000Z	Pithlit	mhz	changing the default port and allowing access from only certain IP's (usefull if you use static) and only certain users (no root!) will help a lot
2005-06-18T06:45:00.000Z	mhz		ohhhh, I almost forgot... I googled for about 45 minutes about this annoying feature. in an iBook, the only resolution i can end up using is 600 x 400 something. Even after specifing 1024x768 or even 800 x ... Any ideas?
2005-06-18T06:45:00.000Z	mhz	Pithlit	yes. root never gets logged in
2005-06-18T06:46:00.000Z	mhz	Pithlit	yes. but unfortunately, I need to ssh to it any time, from any ip :(
