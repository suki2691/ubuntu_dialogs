2010-03-14T19:16:00.000Z	hl_99		hey, i would like to use gparted to resize my /home partition but i cannot unmount it unfortunately
2010-03-14T19:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hl_99	do it in live cd
2010-03-14T19:16:00.000Z	hl_99	ActionParsnip	 do i have to install gparted there then too?
2010-03-14T19:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hl_99	should be part of the live environment, the installer uses it
