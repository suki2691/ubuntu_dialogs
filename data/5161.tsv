2012-03-02T23:23:00.000Z	sskalnik_	blue_pearl	 I was about to say, have you checked "alsamixer"? I had a similar issue in the past.
2012-03-02T23:29:00.000Z	sskalnik_	blue_pearl	 there is a good chance something is muted (MM). Press M on it to un-mute. Seems to be a common problem. It's what I had to do to get HDMI audio working,
2012-03-02T23:31:00.000Z	blue_pearl	sskalnik_	i am unable to found anything muted...i made some bars to full which was half.
