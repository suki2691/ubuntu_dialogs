2008-02-22T09:28:00.000Z	TheFool		I have a rather odd problem and was wondering if someone can look into it.
2008-02-22T09:28:00.000Z	TheFool		For some reason I can connect to my server fine from inside the network, but from outside when I try to connect to port 80 I connect to port 81...I know this would normally be in the router somewhere. But I assure you I have port forwarding set up correctly and have not changed it in over a year...I just renewed my domain but I am not sure how that would affect anything. But it is the only thing that has changed recently
2008-02-22T09:28:00.000Z	TheFool		It seems this is true of other ports as well, for instance I can ssh via port 21
