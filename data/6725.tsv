2012-06-22T05:23:00.000Z	Asar		should there be what was suggestion of ubottu within the Authentication field?
2012-06-22T05:24:00.000Z	yeats	Asar	the GPG error should have some clue as to what the key value is
2012-06-22T05:25:00.000Z	Asar	yeats	so within the Authentication field insert the http://keyserver.ubuntu.com?
2012-06-22T05:26:00.000Z	yeats	Asar	no, it will be something like "437D05B5" (like in ubottu's example)
