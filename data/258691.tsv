2004-11-10T11:31:00.000Z	StormShaman		I have ubuntu 4.10, and in evolution 2, there seems to be a spam filter built in. sadly, it is not based on spamassassin, but that's ok. what bugs me is that although clicking the `junk' button files it as junk, nothing is ever put in the junk folder automatically
2004-11-10T11:31:00.000Z	StormShaman		what's wrong with evolution?
2004-11-10T11:31:00.000Z	ThreeDayMonk	StormShaman	it's a slavish imitation of outlook, when it could do things better
2004-11-10T11:34:00.000Z	StormShaman	ThreeDayMonk	heh
