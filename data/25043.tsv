2010-10-01T03:54:00.000Z	ron85		I've got an i3 processor in one of my ubuntu 10.04 dev servers and its reading the temps wrong. sensors is showing the f as c and the system keeps giving me cpu is over threshold, yata yata yata. Make a long story short its says my cpu is 128.0c and my mb is 34c not only is that insane but my pc would of turned off at around 95c. Anyone run into this b4?
