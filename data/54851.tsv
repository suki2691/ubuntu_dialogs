2009-06-12T21:36:00.000Z	lfaraone		Hi, I installed grub2 and there are now a bunch of mods in my /boot/grub. Do I seriously need them all?
2009-06-12T21:38:00.000Z	cankoy	lfaraone	yes! don't remove them!
2009-06-12T21:40:00.000Z	lfaraone	cankoy	Ok. /me was just wondering why I needed modules for the amiga, sun, etc.
