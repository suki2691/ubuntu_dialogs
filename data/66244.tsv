2010-10-17T12:44:00.000Z	raz_		is it better to install PAE on my 32bit ubuntu or install the 64bit edition, so i can have available all 8gb of ram?
2010-10-17T12:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	raz_	pae can access 12gb ram. Depends on what the system will be used for
2010-10-17T12:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	raz_	if you intend to encode audio and video then 64bit will help. If you have a lexmark printer then 32bit will allow you to use it due to half ass support
2010-10-17T12:53:00.000Z	raz_	ActionParsnip	thanks, iÂ´ll check my hardware compatibility first, since it will do nothing more than a regular user does, webserfing, music/video playback and office work
