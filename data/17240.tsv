2011-03-27T03:25:00.000Z	Polah	umbunt	XP is far superior to Vista. Hence why it's been in usage with companies for a decade and they don't want to switch up to Vista or 7
2011-03-27T03:26:00.000Z	Polah	umbunt	Cost is a factor; it would cost millions for a lot of large companies to switch, but it's also the fact that XP is pretty stable
