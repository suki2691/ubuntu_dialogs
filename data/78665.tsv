2008-09-21T21:06:00.000Z	clarkKent		Anyone have a clue what happens to a file on ubuntu after deleting it from a windows computer?  Ive checked the lost+found and theres nothing there.  Is there a way to get the file back?

In windows the pointer is removed from the file, the earlier you get to the file the better chance that the address does not contain any different data.  With the free copy from runtime.org, you'll be unable to grab files separate, though will have an image to work with.  It's been a while since I've used.
