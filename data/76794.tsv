2009-01-16T12:46:00.000Z	Rocking-W		 I downloaded ubuntu  8.10 i386 instead of i686 but it seems to be doing great and graphics are good also for a GeForce Ti 4200 nvidiacard
2009-01-16T12:47:00.000Z	Rocking-W		is the live cd running off the 8.04 graphics?
2009-01-16T12:47:00.000Z	jken146	Rocking-W	there is only one 23 bit release
2009-01-16T12:50:00.000Z	jken146	Rocking-W	there is a 32 bit (i386) and a 64 bit (amd-64) version.  either should work
