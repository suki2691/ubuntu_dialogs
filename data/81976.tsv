2008-08-18T10:09:00.000Z	arktvrvs	jcarter	i have, theres nearly nothing there, no modelines at all
2008-08-18T10:13:00.000Z	jcarter	arktvrvs	During one part of my initial boot process, I got a message that said Ubuntu didn´t know what my monitor was and presented me with an option to change it. I did. I found a selection that pretty much matched what I have and used it. Don´t know who to make entries in xorg.conf manually. Thought maybe you had something there under Subsection ¨Display¨ called Virtual where the two arguments are the screen size on start-up.
