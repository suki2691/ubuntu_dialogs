2012-01-29T23:38:00.000Z	Silpelit		I"m using winetricks to download ie6 but the site for the download is down, can't access in either terminal or a browser. Is there a way to change the link to a different upload of the same file?
2012-01-29T23:39:00.000Z	Silpelit		Because I even have the ie6 download file, and one made specifically for linux, but it's not working correctly
