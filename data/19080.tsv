2011-09-17T22:14:00.000Z	warfaren		i have 3x3GB swap partitions. i thought it would delete the old ones because i selected "delete the old ubuntu and install a new one" something
2011-09-17T22:15:00.000Z	warfaren		yes nathanel that's what i'm using but when i try to delete /dev/sda7 it says it cant because my current swap partition is /dev/sda9
2011-09-17T22:15:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	warfaren	why 3 swap partitions?
