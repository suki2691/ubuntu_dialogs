2012-08-27T14:55:00.000Z	no_gravity		Good Morning from Hamburg! Sometimes when I want to reboot (by running reboot as root) the system just hangs forever. Probably because some sshfs mount that is confused. How do I rebbot anyway?
2012-08-27T14:56:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	no_gravity	any errors on F1 after reboot?
2012-08-27T14:57:00.000Z	no_gravity	lotuspsychje	what do you mean with "erros on f1"?
2012-08-27T14:57:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	no_gravity	after reboot or shutdown, there's an ubuntu loading screen, if pressing F1 you see txt info on the shutdown..maybe thats revealing something?
