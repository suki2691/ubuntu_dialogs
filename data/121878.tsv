2008-06-03T21:17:00.000Z	mw-home		I have a dual core machine.  How can I be certain both cores are being used?
2008-06-03T21:18:00.000Z	Slart	mw-home	take a look in the system monitor... or run some kind of cpu monitor
2008-06-03T21:18:00.000Z	Slart	mw-home	or install htop and run it.. there are two cpu bars at the top
2008-06-03T21:19:00.000Z	mw-home	Slart	yeah sounds good.  thanks
