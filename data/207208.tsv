2005-12-26T12:55:00.000Z	matw		I'm trying to figure out how much space to put in partitions. Anyone, know where MYSQL puts things?
2005-12-26T12:56:00.000Z	matw		by default?
2005-12-26T12:58:00.000Z	matw		Ok, if I give /var a separate partition (web, MysqL) and separate home what's a comfortable level to leave for / ? Right now I've got a 15 G / that uses only 1.6 GB.
