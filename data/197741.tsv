2006-03-09T12:30:00.000Z	HappyFool	_keroppi_	looked here? http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/groups/dvd/deb/  -- that's from /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh
2006-03-09T12:31:00.000Z	_keroppi_	HappyFool	What happened? Why has it become so hard to get dvd working out of the box? Did something legal clamp down on debian or ubuntu?
2006-03-09T12:32:00.000Z	HappyFool	_keroppi_	i'm not familiar with the details, but I believe there's US legislation like the DMCA. Also, ubuntu's backer is eminently sue-able
