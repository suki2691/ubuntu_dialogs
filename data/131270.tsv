2007-06-14T05:29:00.000Z	Emanon		I'm looking for beta testers for an application I wrote called TimeVault that allows you to roll back files to a previous version (like Apple's TimeMachine). Screenshots, initial docs, and .deb installer is on Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/timevault/+download
2007-06-14T05:29:00.000Z	Emanon		Anyone interested?
