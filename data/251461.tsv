2005-08-31T05:12:00.000Z	mach4		hello everyone
2005-08-31T05:14:00.000Z	mach4		hoping someone can answer me a very quick question. I have an amd64 cpu, should I get 64 bit version of Ubuntu or will I have compatibility issues with certain drivers, programs?
2005-08-31T05:15:00.000Z	mach4		but the 32 bit version should work fine on my cpu, just like windows xp 32 bit does, right?
