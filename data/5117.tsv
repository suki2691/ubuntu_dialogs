2012-02-27T00:56:00.000Z	Nima		I used the wubi install and installed Ubuntu as an application because the traditional dual boot from a CD let to a black screen. The install was fine, but when I get to the dual boot option, my keyboard (RAZR black widow) is completely unresponsive so it just boots to windows on default.
2012-02-27T00:56:00.000Z	Nima		Suggestions?
2012-02-27T00:57:00.000Z	escott	Nima	you probably need to go into your bios and enable the usb keyboard. also if you only issue with the normal install was !nomodeset I'm not sure installing wubi will fix that
