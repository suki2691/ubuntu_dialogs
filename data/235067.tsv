2006-06-01T15:14:00.000Z	mikey		can anyone tell my why there will be Long Term Support on 6.06?
2006-06-01T15:14:00.000Z	apokryphos	mikey	because ubuntu does long-term releases
2006-06-01T15:15:00.000Z	mikey	apokryphos	on my shipped it cd, it says there is a new release every 6 months with updates and support for a year
2006-06-01T15:15:00.000Z	apokryphos	mikey	support is normally for 18 months actually
