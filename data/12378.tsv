2011-11-04T21:38:00.000Z	Industrial		Why does the Software Center reload the whole window every time a package is done uninstalling? what if I want to uninstall 20 packages? I need to wait for each one to uninstall because I cant keep on browsing for packages in the list and I have to navigate to where I was (and remember where in the list I was) before being able to uninstall the next package...
2011-11-04T21:38:00.000Z	Industrial		Can I get synaptic back?
2011-11-04T21:38:00.000Z	zykotick9	Industrial	sure, install synaptic
