2010-12-17T08:23:00.000Z	White-Horse		I installed Avast Anti Virus for Linux and every time (after I install it) I reboot or shutdown the Avast Icon from the Applications/Accessories/ is not there anymore I am using ubuntu 10.04
2010-12-17T08:24:00.000Z	KM0201	White-Horse	do you have to reinstall it, or is it just the icon is gone? can you run it from terminal?
2010-12-17T08:24:00.000Z	KM0201		no.. it's not a webpage
2010-12-17T08:25:00.000Z	White-Horse	KM0201	I see .avast folder but no way to start and the icon is gone far as i know
