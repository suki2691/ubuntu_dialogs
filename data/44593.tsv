2009-11-28T22:36:00.000Z	Soap		Ok, grown sick of my Asus P5K motherboard and my constant problems with the jmicron PATA chip.  Also tired of my Corsair memory which wants 2.1 volts instead of 1.8 and tosses errors when you look at it wrong.  Tired of RMAing the memory and am going to just write it off.
