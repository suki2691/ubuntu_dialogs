2011-06-19T16:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RedDemon1970	which side is the ftp server to run on?
2011-06-19T16:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	RedDemon1970	ftp is not terribly secure so ftp over WAN isn't too smart. I suggest you instal openssh-server and use sftp from that. If it's only for LAN then you can use this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FtpServer
