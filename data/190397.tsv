2007-03-04T12:25:00.000Z	lufis	Stormx2	you can boot without splash and see all that's going on
2007-03-04T12:26:00.000Z	Stormx2	lufis	First, how? Second, I'm pretty sure you can hit a key during uSplash...
2007-03-04T12:26:00.000Z	lufis	Stormx2	i dunno what key, but i would just rather not have splash myself. run gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.list and remove "quiet" and "splash" from your main entry
