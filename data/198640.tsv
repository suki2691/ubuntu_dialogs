2007-07-25T07:20:00.000Z	tzbishop		guys, i have 2 hds (1 IDE 1 SATA). Linux recognizes them as /dev/hda and /dev/sda. How can I set GRUB with that?
2007-07-25T07:21:00.000Z	clever	tzbishop	at the grub command line(run grub in linux or hit c at the menu) type in root (<tab> and it will list off devices
