2011-02-14T13:33:00.000Z	ale_		hi, I have a secondary disk in my PC, and it is not mounted. How can I figure out how to mount it?
2011-02-14T13:34:00.000Z	ale_		it's a linux drive, so it should be ext3 or ext4
2011-02-14T13:35:00.000Z	soreau	ale_	sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mount/point/
2011-02-14T13:35:00.000Z	soreau	ale_	change sdb1 to fit your device of course
