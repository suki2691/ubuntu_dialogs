2007-01-17T11:46:00.000Z	xopher		I cant see the option to adjust brightness for my lcd (laptop) or the dim option anywhere in the gnome-power-manager preferences, any ideas?
2007-01-17T11:48:00.000Z	IcemanV9	xopher	try keyboard shortcut, such as, fn-[brightness up key] 
2007-01-17T13:19:00.000Z	xopher	IcemanV9	well the keyboard shortcuts work (Fn+br.up/down) But Id like to have it automated..
