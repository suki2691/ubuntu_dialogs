2007-09-03T09:49:00.000Z	Flare183		Can someone tell me how to install another hard drive into my computer (which dual boots either from winxp or ubuntu; same hard drive) that has xp already on it?

2007-09-03T09:52:00.000Z	dug_	Flare183	yeah just boot up using the ubuntu cd, and make sure you pick the 2nd hard drive to install to (and format).  It will probably show as hdb or sdb or something like that
2007-09-03T09:53:00.000Z	dug_	Flare183	yeah, i haven't done that myself, but hopefully the windows xp cd installer will let you choose which hard drive to install to
