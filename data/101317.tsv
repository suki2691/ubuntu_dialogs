2008-04-07T22:30:00.000Z	amadeux		HELP: I can't start X anymore. I just get a garbled screen. I have tried deleting all xorg.confs etc, and also Xorg -configure, but nothing works
2008-04-07T22:30:00.000Z	amadeux		Just for starters, maybe just an fb server would be nice, but I cant even get that up
2008-04-07T22:31:00.000Z	amadeux		anyone?
2008-04-07T22:31:00.000Z	amenado	amadeux	 on a console type  X -configure  :0   and this will create xorg.conf.new
