2008-02-20T21:15:00.000Z	noodlesgc	gavin__	yes you can upgrade using the cd but you need the alternate cd
2008-02-20T21:17:00.000Z	noodlesgc	gavin__	so you just want to upgrade openoffice?
2008-02-20T21:19:00.000Z	noodlesgc	gavin__	I dont know if that is possible, you may have to download an upgrade from openoffice.org
