2007-06-19T12:14:00.000Z	Tom47	bruenig	because i am curious (either way ;) )looks like there is at least one way .... just went looking to see why it would be a problem .... in this its done by making ext3 > ext2 first http://www.howtoforge.com/linux_resizing_ext3_partitions
2007-06-19T12:15:00.000Z	bruenig	Tom47	you cannot resize the front of a partition from what I know, if this says that, read through it and report back far too long for me, then that is the first in any filesystem that I have heard of it
2007-06-19T12:18:00.000Z	Tom47	bruenig	seems it can be done using gparted on ntfs ... http://gparted.sourceforge.net/larry/tips/gfs.htm ... but will check through the other too :)
