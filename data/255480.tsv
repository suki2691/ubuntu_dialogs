2005-07-28T14:12:00.000Z	thenuke	thespiritoftal	tar xvzf .tar.gz
2005-07-28T14:12:00.000Z	thenuke	thespiritoftal	man tar and or man gzip would work also ;)
2005-07-28T14:13:00.000Z	thenuke	thespiritoftal	thespiritoftal or tar --help and or gzip --help :-)  I dont blame you but you should always try to figure it out by yourself, most often you can figure it out and learn something :)
