2007-06-25T14:02:00.000Z	Truman		Hello .. can someone tell me what the "libc" headers are, and where I can get them?
2007-06-25T14:02:00.000Z	pi3	Truman	it's very risky to update your libc
2007-06-25T14:02:00.000Z	pi3		!libc
2007-06-25T14:03:00.000Z	Truman	pi3	 Ah, well I'm trying to get my nvidia driver updated, and it keeps telling me I have to get those libc things
