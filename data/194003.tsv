2006-07-18T13:20:00.000Z	nyk2005		Do I get the UserAgent's resolution somewhere in the request? I see it sometimes in stats, but my firefox doesn't seem to send any resolution. Does anyone know something about this?

2006-07-18T13:24:00.000Z	nyk2005	polpak	ah, so I have a javascript add the resolution as a request param so I can get it from serverside scripts..
