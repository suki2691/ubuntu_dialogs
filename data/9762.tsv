2011-09-05T05:02:00.000Z	xsrv	alpicola	the problem is, I want to list all the available wireless networks without using "sudo wlist"
2011-09-05T05:03:00.000Z	xsrv	alpicola	only "iwlist"
2011-09-05T05:05:00.000Z	alpicola	xsrv	Only other things I can think of is making iwlist suid root, or invoking it with a script that is.
