2007-01-20T07:29:00.000Z	leobloo1	vleon	I dunno a lot bout swap but I think that if you have enough ram (let's say 1ghz) you won't need the swap at all
2007-01-20T07:42:00.000Z	leobloo1	vleon	if you dunno how much swap to  have why don't you let the system choose? I think livecd does it quite well ,no?
2007-01-20T07:43:00.000Z	vleon	leobloo1	i know how much swap, A LOT :)
