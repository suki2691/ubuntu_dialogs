2008-02-20T21:13:00.000Z	brobostigon	Ace_NoOne	a file system both linux and windows understands, probebely ntfs is the best option
2008-02-20T21:14:00.000Z	Ace_NoOne	brobostigon	/ luisa: I remember there used to be issues with NTFS under Linux - not anymore?
2008-02-20T21:14:00.000Z	brobostigon	Ace_NoOne	no problem anymore, look up ntfs3g
