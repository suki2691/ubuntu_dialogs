2005-03-11T17:27:00.000Z	jesus_		I have ndiswrapper installed and I have the windows XP .inf file, but i get parse errors when i type ndiswrapper -i bla.inf
2005-03-11T17:27:00.000Z	jesus_		and even so, what's the use of an .inf file?
2005-03-11T17:28:00.000Z	jesus_		the .inf file isn't the driver, right?
