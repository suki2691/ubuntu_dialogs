2007-07-13T11:57:00.000Z	mariocesar_bo		so how can i emulate mounting an iso, to behave same as I insert a cd?
2007-07-13T11:57:00.000Z	bruenig	mariocesar_bo	you can't, the latter is a hal event
2007-07-13T11:58:00.000Z	bruenig	mariocesar_bo	you can still do whatever you need to do though
2007-07-13T11:59:00.000Z	mariocesar_bo	bruenig	thanks, i think i keep using qemu to test my isos
