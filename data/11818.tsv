2011-07-19T11:27:00.000Z	frax		I'm about to set up Ubuntu with a separately partitioned home directory. Will it wipe the contents of that partition before installing my home folder, or is it safe for me to leave my backup there?
2011-07-19T11:29:00.000Z	datang|pergi	frax	i've my homedir separated with / (root), my data is safe so far
2011-07-19T11:30:00.000Z	datang|pergi	frax	I mean when reinstalling ubuntu, my home partition is not cleared
2011-07-19T11:34:00.000Z	frax	datang|pergi	alright, I guess I'll trust that it won't screw things up. Thanks for the help.
