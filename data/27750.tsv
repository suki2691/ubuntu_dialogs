2011-06-13T05:05:00.000Z	rationalOgre	TrD	To my knowledge, no. You could create a shell script to do it.
2011-06-13T05:08:00.000Z	rationalOgre	TrD	Sounds like that could be an interesting project. Best of luck to you on it.
2011-06-13T05:09:00.000Z	rationalOgre	TrD	FWIW I keep all my repositories in a standard place ~/code/<repos> and then just manually update them from time to time when the mood strikes.
