2008-02-24T22:40:00.000Z	Stonekeeper		hi. Does any one here you 2 soundcards? Gutsy is picking which one to use randomly on boot, but pidgin always uses the main soundcard. What's that all about? How can I force a certain card as default?

2008-02-24T22:41:00.000Z	Stonekeeper	hischild	done that, it's still random
2008-02-24T22:41:00.000Z	hischild	Stonekeeper	you need 2 soundcards? you might be able to disable one?
