2012-07-14T07:50:00.000Z	bwat47		the page says it applies to 12.04 so it should work
2012-07-14T07:53:00.000Z	Spectacle_K	bwat47	It seems to be working. I don't need to get back the Ubuntu desktop because it's all already installed. The programmes from the KDE environment were present in the Unity environment. I couldn't find a way to keep the two sets of programmes separate so it became cluttered in Unity. :( Kubuntu looked nice though.
