2005-04-18T10:43:00.000Z	kakalto	Levander	I expect 99.99%
2005-04-18T10:43:00.000Z	kakalto		but, Levander, I think you could upgrade now, then just update in a few days
2005-04-18T10:43:00.000Z	Levander	kakalto	but u have any reason to believe this? u've seen the developer's mailing list where they've talked about it?
