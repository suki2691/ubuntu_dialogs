2008-01-25T11:26:00.000Z	un_op	cybermad	well, usually the guest account has no write access to shared folders -- create a new user on windows and use that user instead
2008-01-25T11:26:00.000Z	cybermad	un_op	why on other XP, then i access the shared folder... i can have write access?
2008-01-25T11:27:00.000Z	un_op	cybermad	i did say _usually_ .. in that case, guest has write access .. if you would like to gives guest access, view the share's security properties
