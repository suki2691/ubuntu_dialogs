2008-03-10T17:24:00.000Z	Laughed		Jack: the gmae that came pre-installed works in 3d. But there is another chess game that has (i think) 3 tiers of chess, (i assume like the chess set seen in star trek NG) anywho, its this game that Ive installed and cannot find
2008-03-10T17:24:00.000Z	Laughed		another issue is that after 3 games of regular 3d chess, my desktop resets and I have to log back in
