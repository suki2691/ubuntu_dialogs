2005-05-29T09:15:00.000Z	cam_		why is it when i try run rhythmbox that it gives me an error "Failed to create the player: Couldnt initialize schedular. Did you run gst-register?"
2005-05-29T09:16:00.000Z	cam_		this is after ive installed more gstreamer plugins
2005-05-29T09:16:00.000Z	cam_		actually ive installed all gstreamer plugins
2005-05-29T09:16:00.000Z	hondje	cam_	Did you try running gst-register for the plugins?
