2012-07-02T06:22:00.000Z	ssp_		(noob) i am trying to upgrade from 10.04 to 10.10 - using sudo do-release-upgrade. While upgrading, it asked me whether I wanted to keep or upgrade the existing version. I chose to  display the differences. Now I cannot get out of this screen with the differences. How can I get out of this without aborting the installation?
