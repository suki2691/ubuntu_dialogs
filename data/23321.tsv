2010-11-06T22:14:00.000Z	GoldenFish4U		I uninstalled Skype, removed the .Skype folder, what else can I do to remove it completely?
2010-11-06T22:15:00.000Z	xrdodrx	GoldenFish4U	It should be already removed completely. It isn't?
2010-11-06T22:16:00.000Z	GoldenFish4U	xrdodrx	 yeah it's gone from the menu etc, just making sure it's gone :D
