2006-01-17T12:09:00.000Z	d33t	shad0w1e	i'm no expert, but from what i've recently read, yes. ext2 doesn't keep a log, so it shoudl use less overhead
2006-01-17T12:10:00.000Z	d33t	shad0w1e	fallback is, you can lose info if the machine dies in mid write
2006-01-17T12:11:00.000Z	d33t	shad0w1e	there's a way to turn off journalling on an ext3 partition, which will make it run as an ext2 partition. you can play with that if you want to test it
