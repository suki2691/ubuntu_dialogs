2007-07-18T10:23:00.000Z	nikin	HEP85	6.06 is dapper.. and people use it coz it has LTS, edgy is used by those who had problems using .20 kernel
2007-07-18T10:23:00.000Z	HEP85	nikin	I see
2007-07-18T10:25:00.000Z	nikin	HEP85	on my dual P3 desktop maschine i use 7.04 ... but on my notebook it makes some strange bugs about the CPU temperature (7600 C  > halting) and such things so i wait till .21 or .22 in Gutsy
