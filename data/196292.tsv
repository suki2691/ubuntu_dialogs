2007-12-31T03:13:00.000Z	Telarian02		I changed the resolution of my console and everything works fine except the screen is not centered on my monitor if i change the settings then switch back to graphical screen and I have to recenter it again, if i leave console resolution at default i never have to change the settings on monitor, anyone have some help?
