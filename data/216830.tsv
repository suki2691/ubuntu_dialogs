2010-07-04T21:26:00.000Z	rapha	steffan	thanks for the link ... actually after looking at it I'm not sure if the problem is automounting. When I attach the drive and plug in a floppy, the drive shows up under "Computer", but double-clicking it does nothing. When I *manually* do "mount /dev/sde /mnt" it works. But I can't tell these non-technical users that ... any idea why the double-clicking doesn't work?
