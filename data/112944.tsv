2007-11-29T03:23:00.000Z	spiffman		ok, so I just installed ubuntu 7.10 64 bit (first time in linux), and i can't install a vast majority of packages, including xchat (i'm on a macbook). The forums say that almost every application is supported, did i miss a step in installation?
2007-11-29T03:23:00.000Z	kamelion	spiffman	try to enable all the applications, default are only ubuntu maintained packages
2007-11-29T03:25:00.000Z	spiffman	kamelion	what do you mean enable all applications?
