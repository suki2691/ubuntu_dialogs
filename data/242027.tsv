2008-01-09T11:42:00.000Z	Shai_A		I have a problem with aMule: when loading the program for the first time, it doesn't detect any servers and when I try to press the button that's supposed to load a list of servers from somewhere, it crashes. Any ideas?
2008-01-09T11:43:00.000Z	Shai_A		maybe another program I can use?
2008-01-09T11:44:00.000Z	Shai_A		Why does this error occur? I tried installing the program twice and it's the same thing each time
2008-01-09T11:45:00.000Z	astro76	Shai_A	well that's good because reinstalling things never fixes anything in linux ;)
