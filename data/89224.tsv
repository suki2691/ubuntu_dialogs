2008-06-12T05:33:00.000Z	swansk_		I can't find "acc codec" in synaptic
2008-06-12T05:34:00.000Z	swansk_		I need to copy this Audio CD into MP3 for work....I am extracting it as OGG right now because mp3 isn't working and neither is acc.
2008-06-12T05:35:00.000Z	swansk_		does windows play ogg easily?
