2005-12-30T07:31:00.000Z	apricot		please, why does a long time for configuring network devices on startup?
2005-12-30T07:32:00.000Z	SevenIsPrime	apricot	Perhaps because you are not connected to a network?
2005-12-30T07:33:00.000Z	SevenIsPrime	apricot	There are some nasty timeouts if you are not connected to a network or wait for DHCP to not find a server
