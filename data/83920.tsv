2009-07-29T23:02:00.000Z	lstarnes	dewdude	I already covered amd64,  intel 64 is used more often to refer to intel's 64 bit processors specifically
2009-07-29T23:04:00.000Z	dewdude	lstarnes	i'm going by industry terms... Intel 64 is what they're calling their implementation of amd64, perhaps you're thinking of IA-64 that they used for Itanium?
2009-07-29T23:05:00.000Z	lstarnes	dewdude	I thought it was EM64T
