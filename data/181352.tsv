2006-10-01T07:52:00.000Z	snake		For those who were just complaining of my offtopicy, heres where I was getting to: How does debian play mp3 out of the box, when its illigal for ubuntu to include it
2006-10-01T07:53:00.000Z	bruenig	snake	it is illegal, if debian does it, they are breaking the law at least in the U.S.
2006-10-01T07:53:00.000Z	snake	bruenig	Im aware, all I know is I just installed a fresh nilla debian and its playing mp3s.
2006-10-01T07:54:00.000Z	bruenig	snake	ok what is your point, They broke the law therefore ubuntu can? If I murder and get away with it does that mean that it is legal to murder. Check your logic.
