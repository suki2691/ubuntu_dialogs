2007-04-01T06:03:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	Sacarah	can you be more specific?
2007-04-01T06:04:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	Sacarah	its 1000 B / KB vs 1024 B / KB thing
2007-04-01T06:08:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	Sacarah	anyways, we've answered your question, windows uses 1KB = 1024B instead of the correct definition of 1KB which is 1000B. That's all.
