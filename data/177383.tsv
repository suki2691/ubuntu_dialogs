2010-09-06T22:43:00.000Z	sipior	abhijeet	no, more or less by definition. only use it if you plan on filing bug reports.
2010-09-06T22:45:00.000Z	sipior	abhijeet	there are two versions ubuntu that have been released since 9.04. does one of them not work?
2010-09-06T22:45:00.000Z	abhijeet	sipior	i have not tried the second version...
