2009-05-14T09:09:00.000Z	voxadam		I just installed 9.04 on an old box I dug out of the closet but every time I boot the kernel crashes, usually before hitting KDM and always before reaching the desktop. How do I keep X from starting and go text only so I can poke around?

2009-05-14T09:18:00.000Z	voxadam	burner	I did what you said and have a root shell now. Now how do I keep X from starting when I reboot?
2009-05-14T09:18:00.000Z	burner	voxadam	remove kdm and gdm? :)
