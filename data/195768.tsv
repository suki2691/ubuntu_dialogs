2009-01-07T17:25:00.000Z	flexd2		I seem to have managed to install ubuntu now, but i also managed to install grub to the wrong drive it seemed. It suggested hd0 but i went with another hdd.. is there a way i can fix this?
2009-01-07T17:26:00.000Z	flexd2		i went with the hdd i installed ubuntu on, figuring that would work
