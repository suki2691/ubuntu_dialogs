2010-01-07T07:53:00.000Z	chanfle		Quick question:  just made a USB-Ubunutu9.10 installer, but I'm wondering if it's actually FOR installing, or is it meant to BOOT from the usb every time?

2010-01-07T07:53:00.000Z	chanfle		Cause all of the guides say "now you can boot ubuntu from your usb whenever" etc..
