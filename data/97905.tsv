2010-03-22T09:05:00.000Z	BaseBallBoy		Quick question, can I get an estimated time/date that Ubuntu 10.04 will be ready?
2010-03-22T09:05:00.000Z	chelz	BaseBallBoy	that's all on the release schedule. but it'll be around april 30th
2010-03-22T09:06:00.000Z	chelz	BaseBallBoy	the servers get really hard right around when big updates happen, so if you can it's good to wait a few weeks
