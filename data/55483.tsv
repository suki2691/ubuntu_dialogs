2009-07-16T20:03:00.000Z	cipher		is there a way to run two WMs simultaneously in GNOME? i.e. on one monitor I'd love to have wmii and on another the regular metacity desktop
2009-07-16T20:05:00.000Z	edbian	cipher	 First off.  Gnome contains a window manager.  It's called metacity.  I don't think gnome supports two window manager at once but that is an interesting idea.
2009-07-16T20:05:00.000Z	cipher	edbian	yeah. I know the default is metacity. I am able to tell gnome to use wmii as its window manager but not to have both metacity and wmii at the same time.
2009-07-16T20:06:00.000Z	edbian	cipher	 I don't think so.
