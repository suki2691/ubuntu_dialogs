2005-03-23T11:07:00.000Z	bleb_		Hi, I've dist-upgraded to hoary in march, but it looks like my nvidia driver is always breaking (and right now no matter what I do I can't run GL programs), and my boot process is really slow (2 minutes on a P4 2.6hz with 1gb of ram!). Do anyone think doing a fresh install of hoary may solve some things?
