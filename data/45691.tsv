2009-10-27T02:39:00.000Z	dmulholland		hey, i saw a post on the net about using /etc/exports to share files across linux and it seemed simple... does it work in Ubuntu?
2009-10-27T02:39:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	dmulholland	yes, its called nfs its much better than samba
2009-10-27T02:41:00.000Z	dmulholland	BoxMagnet	is it as simple as adding /home/drive 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0(rw) to it or what do you do afterwards to "activate" or how do you connect another machine and mount?
2009-10-27T02:43:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	dmulholland	sorry, i am leaving but, here,
