2012-10-24T12:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frink_	Because people who incorrectly think that they need to defrag will pay $8.00 for a utility that will do so, despite the fact that ext4 rarely gets signifigant fragmentation and there are Free tools for defragging it in the rare cases that it does (like if you keep your filesystem at 95% full and add and delete many large and small files).
