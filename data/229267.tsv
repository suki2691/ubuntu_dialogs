2006-04-14T06:41:00.000Z	DarthShrine		Why is firefox still at 1.0.7 on Ubuntu?
2006-04-14T06:41:00.000Z	mwe	DarthShrine	because programs stay at the version they were released at
2006-04-14T06:42:00.000Z	mwe	DarthShrine	and replacing it with 1.5 would break a load of crap
2006-04-14T06:43:00.000Z	mwe	DarthShrine	getting 1.5 is easy though. just keep the old version to keep ubuntu happy
