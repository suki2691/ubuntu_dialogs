2008-10-13T19:15:00.000Z	titan_		Ok, I just installed NVidia 177.80 drivers and I have my x server running and such. It just won't let me change the resolution from 640X480... any suggestions?
2008-10-13T19:15:00.000Z	titan_		ok, thanks

2008-10-13T19:17:00.000Z	titan_	jim_p	I have the GeForce 8800 GTX... and I didn't install it from the package nvidia provides, I installed it with Synaptic, I guess I just forgot to install nvidia-settings with it >.<
