2012-05-02T14:23:00.000Z	gribouille		why was the package libdigest-sha1-perl removed from precise?
2012-05-02T14:24:00.000Z	gaelfx	gribouille	it's been a very naughty package, so it has to take a timeout
2012-05-02T14:28:00.000Z	gaelfx	gribouille	it's possible that that package's functionality has been replaced by a package of a different name
