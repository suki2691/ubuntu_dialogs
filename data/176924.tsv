2006-06-23T10:57:00.000Z	Ap0s7le		I was wondering if when I'm using a windows machine if I can also see the desktop gui through SSH?
2006-06-23T10:59:00.000Z	Ap0s7le		It's on my local network, I was just told it's possible through SSH and so that's why I asked the question the way I did. Thanks a alot :)
2006-06-23T10:59:00.000Z	Ap0s7le		What should I use, like which is the best choice?
