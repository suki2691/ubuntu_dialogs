2006-04-20T10:05:00.000Z	swiadek		Ubuntu v5.1 + Skype v1.2 on a 14" laptop with 1024x768 (max resolution). There are two toolbars: one on the top and the other at the bottom. I go to Skype --> Personal Information and the box that opens up fills up an entire screen and OK is not seen. Bottom toolbar is over the Skype's Personal Information box and there is no way to select OK to Continue. How can I move or configure bottom toolbar to auto-disappear, or to not
2006-04-20T10:05:00.000Z	swiadek		be over the top of other boxes ?
2006-04-20T10:06:00.000Z	void^	swiadek	try alt-leftclickdrag to move a window
2006-04-20T10:09:00.000Z	swiadek	void^	 I am trying Alt +... and appears to work same as without Alt button. The box won't go higher than the top of the screen even if I grab the box in the middle. So that I could see the bottom of the box.
