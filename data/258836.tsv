2005-02-26T08:22:00.000Z	website		now to work we need 0.95
2005-02-26T08:23:00.000Z	Nermal	website	0.95 is in hoary, but it doesn't seem to have an executable :|
2005-02-26T08:28:00.000Z	website	Nermal	excuse me, but now seems that 0.95 is in hoary (last week it was 0.93) another issue: that package works with debian menu package, so there should be not any line in the men about gtk-gnutella....
