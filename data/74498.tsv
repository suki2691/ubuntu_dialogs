2008-11-12T00:23:00.000Z	Slart	mker_	I think ubuntu considers all hard drives to be removable unless you put them in /etc/fstab.. it won't really be a problem
2008-11-12T00:24:00.000Z	mker_	Slart	joebodo: It is a small problem since it doesn't mount automatically at startup, I have to do it manually every time. I checked fstab and it isn't there.
2008-11-12T00:25:00.000Z	Slart	mker_	well.. sounds like putting it in the fstab file would solve that.. it isn't that hard.. man fstab for details
