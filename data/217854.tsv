2005-09-24T11:13:00.000Z	matitaccia		Hello! I have got a very old notebook. It's still a 486 it works perhaps at 66mhz (don't remember) and has something like 36 mb Ram. I would like to use it with a very small linux installation. Note: I don't have any cdrom drive.
2005-09-24T11:14:00.000Z	matitaccia		Should I better go to some linux channel, instead of the ubuntu one?
