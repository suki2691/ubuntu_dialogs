2008-01-25T06:39:00.000Z	l00kp		Hello. I need to load firmware for my linksys WPC54G card into ndiswrapper; anyone know how to do this?
2008-01-25T06:39:00.000Z	scguy318	l00kp	find a WIndows driver and load it
2008-01-25T06:40:00.000Z	l00kp	scguy318	I did load a windows driver with #ndiswrapper <driver.inf> -i   but it didn't load the firmware
2008-01-25T06:41:00.000Z	scguy318	l00kp	you've written it backwards
