2011-04-28T23:34:00.000Z	michaelschmid		hi! just updated from 10.10 to 11.04... during install i had a crash. then i finished using shell. now my install is sometimes freezing and nautilus doesn't work anymore (just doesn't start). any suggestions?
2011-04-28T23:34:00.000Z	Monotoko	michaelschmid	sounds like a reinstall job
2011-04-28T23:35:00.000Z	Monotoko	michaelschmid	I mean reinstall your operating system clean
