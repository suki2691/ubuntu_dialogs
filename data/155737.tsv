I'm installing on a thinkpad x24 with a CF card.. the installation went VERY slowly (took about 5 hours).. it seems to have just stopped towards the end.. I can boot the system I get a console login.. (no X).. it seems like everything was installed..but a few things are wierd.. 1. there is no inittab (is that normal?), the machine doesnt boot into X..
