2008-01-31T08:50:00.000Z	bra1		hello?
2008-01-31T08:51:00.000Z	bra1		I'm having some problems installing ubuntu, and thought I might find help here
2008-01-31T08:52:00.000Z	bra1		I'm trying to instal 7.04 on a laptop, live runs fine, but partitioning isn't something I'm any good at
2008-01-31T08:53:00.000Z	arkanes	bra1	are you trying to co-exist with an existing OS, or installing over the entire thing?
