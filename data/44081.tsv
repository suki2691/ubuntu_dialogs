2012-07-15T07:52:00.000Z	L3top		This is a common problem hylian and zamn. It should be pretty well documented for a workaround.
2012-07-15T07:53:00.000Z	L3top		I do not zamn. Sorry.  I am in the middle of something sort of complicated with zorg24. If you have not found the solution by the time we finish, I will figure it out.
2012-07-15T07:54:00.000Z	hylian	L3top	any ideas? I have heard of people intentionally switching speakers for mic and vice versa, but never have I heard of it happening on it's own...
2012-07-15T08:10:00.000Z	hylian	L3top	maybe you can make more of this than i can. this is zamn's info from his computer: http://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=adb30ad7d5bec0f564106e4e4be78904b0cd4663. I did notice that he is using pulse audio software and alsa mixer software simultaneuosly, perhaps this is the culprit?
