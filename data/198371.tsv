2007-03-27T12:31:00.000Z	oga		hey all, i'm using the live CD at the moment because my HDD & Power supply just blew up. I'd like to test the RAM to see if it's all ok before I go shopping for new parts what is the best way to test memory using livecd
2007-03-27T12:32:00.000Z	oga		i thought it was just the power supply, but the new one won't boot unless the HDD is disconnected
2007-03-27T12:32:00.000Z	mzuverink	oga	doesnt it have that option hit the f1-f... to see other options when starting up, I seem to remember that option on the livecd, I may be wrong...
