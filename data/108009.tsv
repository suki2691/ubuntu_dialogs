2011-05-27T17:50:00.000Z	LetsGo67		Why was Java removed from 11.04?  Is it because of Oracle?
2011-05-27T17:52:00.000Z	LjL	LetsGo67	well, java is available easily enough, you only need to add the partner repositories. but i think the thing is that the flash package is just an installer that gets the actual Flash from the net, while the java package is actually java
2011-05-27T17:54:00.000Z	LetsGo67	LjL	'Cause it's 95% free and 5% Sun?
2011-05-27T17:54:00.000Z	LjL	LetsGo67	honestly i don't know what the current license status of java is, it's a bit confusing
