2008-03-26T03:09:00.000Z	Scunizi		I have a lot of music files that may have many duplicates.. is there an easy command line way of finding out?
2008-03-26T03:10:00.000Z	rryan	Scunizi	: Are they identical copies ? i.e. bit for bit the files are equal, or are they two versions of the same song? Do they have similar or identical tags?
2008-03-26T03:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	rryan	unop Slart can it be done by file name
2008-03-26T03:12:00.000Z	Scunizi	rryan	unop Slart perhaps by one of the keywords in the filename?
