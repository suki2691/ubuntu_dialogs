2010-05-14T21:09:00.000Z	dAnon		I have a problem with some commands in terminal in ubuntu 10.04. After putting in "sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst" I was supposed to get something like "root=UUID=a089c41b-e47e-444e-b389-e5a23ed610ee ro quiet splash
2010-05-14T21:09:00.000Z	dAnon		"
2010-05-14T21:09:00.000Z	dAnon		but nothing happened
2010-05-14T21:10:00.000Z	iceroot	dAnon	1. dont use sudo for gui-apps, 2. 10.04 is not using grub legancy so there is no menu.lst
