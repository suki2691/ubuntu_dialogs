2006-01-08T16:39:00.000Z	Yango	treth	what program are you using?
2006-01-08T16:40:00.000Z	treth	Yango	 As of right now, I'm editing /etc/network/interfaces manually.  It's not working well; the machine keeps overwriting /etc/resolv.conf with broken entries and losing the gateway, even without reboots.
