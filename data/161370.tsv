2006-11-03T11:58:00.000Z	studiophi		Keysir, that is not my experience. All of my usb 2.0 external drives work fine on my 1.0 pc
2006-11-03T11:59:00.000Z	Keyseir	studiophi	So you're agreeing with everyone? Everyone has told me that USB 2 devices will Indeed work on USB 1 computer.
2006-11-03T12:00:00.000Z	studiophi	Keyseir	yes. I have 2 generic HDs, 250 gb and 160 gb, and a 20gb 4th gen ipod. all work fine on my ubuntu machine
