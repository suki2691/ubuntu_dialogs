2008-12-27T09:28:00.000Z	craigbass1976		I just did a fresh xubuntu install on my laptop.  Wireless was too easy.  What happened?  I have a broadcom 43xx and always had to go through some cutter routine (just did it on someone else's lappy and had to do it on mine again when I went from feisty to hardy--with a gutsy stop between)
2008-12-27T09:28:00.000Z	craigbass1976		I'm not complaining, but was a bit blown away.

2008-12-27T09:31:00.000Z	craigbass1976	stan	I just downloaded it yesterday or today.  It was on the xubuntu site.  My laptop is too much of a turd to run GNOME well now, so I installed the XUB instead
