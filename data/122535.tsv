2007-09-16T12:59:00.000Z	ChildX		Is it possible to make XMMS my default music player in Ubuntu 7.04? I do not use Rhythmbox, so I want my prefered music player to be default. How can I make XMMS my default music player?
2007-09-16T12:59:00.000Z	HardDisk	ChildX	right click an mp3 and select default player from its option
2007-09-16T13:00:00.000Z	HardDisk		from the open with tab
2007-09-16T13:00:00.000Z	ChildX	HardDisk	I have done that already.
