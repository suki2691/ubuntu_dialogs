2008-07-27T09:15:00.000Z	Bad_Hacker		I am running Ubuntu on a PC Chips M810 LMR-H with about 630 of ram, and running a ati radeon 128mb 9600 card. I notice that once I installed the graphic card it appears that the screen goes " blank or black" is this some sort of bug with ati radeon cards and xforce software, if so, how can i fix this issue? Please help. Thanks!!!
