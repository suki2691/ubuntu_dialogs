2006-06-02T11:07:00.000Z	bbuda		anyone?  i have no menu or task bar running the ubuntu 6.06 livecd - everything else appears to be functional however (firefox, openoffice work fine if i manually run them from a terminal)
2006-06-02T11:09:00.000Z	bimberi	bbuda	does typing 'gnome-panel' say/do anything"
2006-06-02T11:10:00.000Z	bbuda	bimberi	that got it - thanks.  any idea why it wouldn't come up at startup?
2006-06-02T11:11:00.000Z	bimberi	bbuda	sorry, none - you could look for errors in the logs (/var/log)
