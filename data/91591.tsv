2009-10-20T15:46:00.000Z	GIR7590		Hey, I recently installed SDL via apt-get, but whenever I try to compile something, it doesn't seem to see the libraries, and it always says "error: <sdl header file> : No such file or directory" (Replacing <sdl header file> with an actual header filename obvoisly)...
2009-10-20T15:46:00.000Z	GIR7590		Any thoughts?
2009-10-20T15:47:00.000Z	GIR7590		Anyone?
