2008-03-09T11:33:00.000Z	farruinn	cjones	it's a form of reference, like forums, wikis, blogs, etc.
2008-03-09T11:34:00.000Z	cjones	farruinn	shouldent it be posted as we enter the room
2008-03-09T11:35:00.000Z	farruinn	cjones	not really - anyone could be logging this and it's a public form of communication anyway.
