2006-09-23T14:57:00.000Z	THX-1138		sudo hdparm -d 1 /media/cdrom0 - did this work for you?
2006-09-23T14:57:00.000Z	Jowi	THX-1138	you can not use /media/cdrom with hdparm. you must use the /dev/ path to the dvd/cdrom
2006-09-23T14:58:00.000Z	THX-1138	Jowi	- I know you are right tho. when i tried dev *pffft* nothing   /media/cdrom0 gave me dma enabled. - (shrug i dunno)
2006-09-23T14:59:00.000Z	Jowi	THX-1138	that is not what I would expect :)
