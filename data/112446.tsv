2008-05-15T19:41:00.000Z	fent	Hammer89	hm, sorta worrying
2008-05-15T19:44:00.000Z	Hammer89	fent	You're sure it rebooted and GDM didn't just crash or something?
2008-05-15T19:55:00.000Z	fent	Hammer89	yes it was a restart - /var/log/syslog.log shows a restart at 7:50am today :-/ I wasn't up yet. I don't see any other restarts in the log for weeks back (so it's not something that was scheduled)
