2007-12-25T08:03:00.000Z	RequinB4		I have a semi-ubuntu related question(bash me if i'm too off topic).  I'm thinking of a web site that will work like google docs to share/edit text files, then be able to compile them in various languages.  Would this be something I could do on a third party hosting system or would i need my own apache server?

2007-12-25T08:07:00.000Z	RequinB4	Khisanth	bascule - well, hopefully i wouldn't have to write the back-end stuff myself, just organize it all into a page and get rid of the human element that is currently needed
