2010-09-30T06:54:00.000Z	farang		is there any way to revive a lucid image that has hung on boot due to a bug in cloud-init?  Seems like there is a fix if you have access to the machine, but what can I do?
2010-09-30T06:55:00.000Z	acicula	farang	can you make it boot from a cdimage and chroot into the instance?
