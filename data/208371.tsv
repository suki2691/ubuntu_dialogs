2006-03-13T15:50:00.000Z	ph8		Hi again, I still have the same problem. I'm running gnome, I want to edit files over sftp or scp in a way that when I save in the text-editor it overwrites the file (instead of saving then having to upload seperately) - gedit does fine for ftp:// but not sftp:// or scp:// - are there any plugins or other programs I can use?

2006-03-13T07:50:00.000Z	ph8	frogzoo	I had it before, I'm going back because most of gnomes functionality is sucky
