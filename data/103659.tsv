2009-10-22T15:37:00.000Z	Fertakao		is there a way to make ubuntu use the programs i had installed in vista?
2009-10-22T15:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fertakao	you can if the app is extremely portable
2009-10-22T15:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fertakao	most arent now and will need files in the windows dir as well as registry keys
2009-10-22T15:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fertakao	so they will need installing via wine to satisfy these files / settings
