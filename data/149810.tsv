2008-11-07T19:41:00.000Z	Laibsch		Why are there no jigdo files for the live CD of intrepid at http://ubuntu.intergenia.de/releases/intrepid/ ?
2008-11-07T19:42:00.000Z	Pici	Laibsch	Because the liveCD is mostly made up of one large file and it doesnt make sense to have a jigdo for that.
2008-11-07T19:43:00.000Z	Laibsch	Pici	Alright.  Thanks.
