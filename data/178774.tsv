2007-09-20T08:08:00.000Z	jrib	ArmedKing	close any programs accessing files on it including any shells with the current working directory in it
2007-09-20T08:09:00.000Z	ArmedKing	jrib	I'm in live now. I whas working on my drive with gparted and there is no File system on that drive. So i cant realy be using it
