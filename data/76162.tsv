2008-11-22T00:22:00.000Z	mker		I did "sudo shutdown -F -r now" and fsck didn't automatically check my disk at startup
2008-11-22T00:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	mker	sudo touch /forcefsck
2008-11-22T00:36:00.000Z	mker	erUSUL	sudo touch /forcefsck only checked my first harddrive with Ubuntu on it. Not the second one.
