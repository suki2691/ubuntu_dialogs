2006-06-03T14:51:00.000Z	Sjoerd-		Hello, I have very little knowledge of linux, only basic knowledge of using command line. I want to setup a web/mail/print/file server. Would Ubuntu be the right choice for me?

2006-06-03T14:52:00.000Z	Terminus-	Sjoerd-	a mail server is trickier than the others.
2006-06-03T14:54:00.000Z	Terminus-	Sjoerd-	ubuntu will work fine for all of the stuff you want to do.
