2007-08-05T11:25:00.000Z	stuart-	riotkittie	p3 667, 768 ram. older, yeah, but it should hold out fine, considering what it did with xp
2007-08-05T11:26:00.000Z	riotkittie	stuart-	wow, and youre seeing better performance under xp? thats crazy. i was using a p3 650/750mhz with 256mb laptop for about a year, and it absolutely flewwww under linux compared to xp
