2007-08-04T06:17:00.000Z	j2daosh		how do i reopen a file i have "stopped"?
2007-08-04T06:17:00.000Z	j2daosh		i hit ctrl+z to undo a change, but it "stopped" my vim
2007-08-04T06:18:00.000Z	bruenig	j2daosh	you use "u" in normal mode to undo a change, ctrl + z in terminal backgrounds the application
2007-08-04T06:18:00.000Z	bruenig	j2daosh	probably just doing "fg" will bring it back
