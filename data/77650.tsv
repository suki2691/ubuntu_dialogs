2008-10-08T13:26:00.000Z	dialman		I can't connect to my windows SMB share from ubuntu. I can ping it. Can't figure out smbclient to connect. Any ideas?
2008-10-08T13:27:00.000Z	dialman		SMB share is setup not to need username or password. Eg. from windows I can 'just connect' without a username or password.

2008-10-08T13:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip2	dialman	did you sudo smbpasswd <your username>
