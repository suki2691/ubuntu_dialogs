2006-07-28T08:14:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet		Hi all .. has anyone designed an app that can rotate desktop background images? My cheap LCD monitor burns in SOo fast .. I think that might help (dual monitors, xgl, xinerama, CRT/LCD) ..

2006-07-28T08:15:00.000Z	WhiteNinja		just look for background-settings
