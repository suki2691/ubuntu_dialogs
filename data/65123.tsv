2011-03-19T07:29:00.000Z	mcurran		have you tried using fdisk's advanced options for repairing
2011-03-19T07:29:00.000Z	mcurran		is gparted showing it as black
2011-03-19T07:30:00.000Z	mcurran		try force mounting the partition with ntfs3g if it's an ntfs partition, sometimes it stops it from complaining
2011-03-19T07:31:00.000Z	arbitrary	mcurran	It's not a matter of mounting it. I just want to increase the size of the (ext4) partition.
