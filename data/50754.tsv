2009-08-09T20:55:00.000Z	shapr		Silly question, I'm used to changing /etc/apt/sources.list and then doing a dist-upgrade, can I upgrade from ubuntu 9.04 server to 9.10 that way?
2009-08-09T20:55:00.000Z	shapr		What's the ubuntu equivalent of debian/unstable, and how do I change my /etc/apt/sources.list to point to that instead of 9.04 server?
2009-08-09T20:56:00.000Z	Halitech	shapr	currently it would be 9.10
2009-08-09T20:56:00.000Z	shapr	Halitech	Spiffy, how do I point to that? I would assume I change jaunty to something else?
