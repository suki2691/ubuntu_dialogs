2005-01-21T11:07:00.000Z	trey3	ficusplanet	you've played with the monitors settings physically?
2005-01-21T11:07:00.000Z	ficusplanet	trey3	I dont see a way to do that.  I won't let me change the resolution from 640x480.
2005-01-21T11:09:00.000Z	trey3	ficusplanet	ahh... /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 ... remove all instances of "640x480"... I usually remove all below 1024x768 to give it a convincing prod  :)
