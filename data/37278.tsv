2010-03-09T21:30:00.000Z	abhi_nav	ejb	which command you want to execute? also have a look at bash programming. may it is what you want
2010-03-09T21:31:00.000Z	abhi_nav		is it safe to delete everthing from /tmp to get space free?
2010-03-09T21:31:00.000Z	ejb	abhi_nav	I want to execute a python script. It may involve some bash but I don't think that's the answer.
