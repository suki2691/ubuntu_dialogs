2011-10-15T17:54:00.000Z	hulaka		I updated my Ubuntu 11.04 to 11.10 but didn't like it. So I made clean installation of Lubuntu. Everything good but ... for example Libreoffice fonts look ugly and its navigate panel fonts are super small
2011-10-15T17:55:00.000Z	hulaka		basically all the fonts looks kinda different ...
2011-10-15T17:55:00.000Z	hulaka		hard to explain, but maybe you know how to set all the fonts too just look fine
2011-10-15T17:57:00.000Z	incorrect	hulaka	if you want gnone2ish try xubuntu
