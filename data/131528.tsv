2008-09-19T01:36:00.000Z	qah		Hi. I have a question about compiling C++ code in ubuntu or linux period.
2008-09-19T01:38:00.000Z	qah		I am trying to make a cross-platform software for Windows and Linux. For the windows code, I encase in with #ifdef WIN32. That tells if it is compiling and running on windows. But how about Linux. what define can I use for linux?
2008-09-19T01:39:00.000Z	qah		No. _LINUX_ doesn't work
