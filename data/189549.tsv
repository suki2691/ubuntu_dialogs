2010-12-31T10:08:00.000Z	coz_	luxurymode	  you can speed that up  to 0  delay   but I am not sure that is the issue
2010-12-31T10:11:00.000Z	coz_	luxurymode	 as I said if you want  I can help you set the delay on the menus  to   "0"
2010-12-31T10:11:00.000Z	coz_	luxurymode	 or not as extreme  like say  "1" or so
