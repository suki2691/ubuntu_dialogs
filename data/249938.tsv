2008-04-18T05:05:00.000Z	ksb		I have a really quick total noob question for someone
2008-04-18T05:06:00.000Z	ksb		I am installing UBTU FF and need to create a SWAP partition.  Should that be Logical or Primary?
2008-04-18T05:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ksb	 swap can be either one. I tend to make all primary partitions
