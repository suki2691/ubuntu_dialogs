2010-06-12T17:12:00.000Z	MasterZuFu		Can someone please tell me how to figure out what time my ubuntu 10.04 server is running at? #ubuntu-server isn't responding to my question.
2010-06-12T17:13:00.000Z	Slart	MasterZuFu	running "date" in a terminal?
2010-06-12T17:13:00.000Z	Slart	MasterZuFu	or you mean the current timezone?
2010-06-12T17:15:00.000Z	Slart	MasterZuFu	you can use "date" to set the time as well.. but I would setup a ntp-server
