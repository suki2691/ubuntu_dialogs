2008-04-28T10:29:00.000Z	annodomini		I just upgraded my girlfriend's Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop from Gutsy to Hardy, and now the screen doesn't turn on after resuming from suspend-to-RAM (shutting the lid). Can anyone offer any advice on troubleshooting this?

2008-04-28T10:30:00.000Z	annodomini	bazhang	what information should I file with it?
2008-04-28T10:31:00.000Z	bazhang	annodomini	just as you have typed it here; if the devs need more info they will ask you to post it--but you need to check back on that bug from time to time for their comments and possible workarounds that people post
