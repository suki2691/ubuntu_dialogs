2005-06-03T09:46:00.000Z	danko123451	IcemanV9	I dont think so.
2005-06-03T09:47:00.000Z	IcemanV9	danko123451	then, we wait for you when you figure it out ;)
2005-06-03T09:48:00.000Z	danko123451	IcemanV9	yeah, well, I mean, it is just fun to try out, I guess, I doubt Ill like it more than gnome over all, although you have control over how you want to display the windows completely.
