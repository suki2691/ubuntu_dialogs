2009-02-09T22:06:00.000Z	igoryonya		After I installed version 8.10, it automatically detected my Cisco 350 series card and detected all the WiFi networks in the proximity. I connected to one of them and it was working for a few days. I don't know what has happened, but it stopped connecting and the Wireless option to search for networks is grayed out.
