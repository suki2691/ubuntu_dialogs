2008-02-24T04:05:00.000Z	Amaranth	bastid_raZor	Ah, those. You should really upgrade to gutsy :)
2008-02-24T04:06:00.000Z	Amaranth	bastid_raZor	Nope, the packages in gutsy are newer than the ones in my repo. My repo was a backport of the stuff we were doing in gutsy and I stopped updating it around the time of gutsy beta.
