2008-12-18T22:33:00.000Z	UUH		Hi. Noob-question incoming. I'm trying out Ubuntu (8.10) with a Live CD.
2008-12-18T22:33:00.000Z	UUH		It won't be as slow as it is now if I install it on my harddrive, right?
2008-12-18T22:33:00.000Z	Pelo	UUH	, the live cd uses your ram to make a fake hdd, so you'll have more ram to play with , also some cpu is required to run stuf from the ram so ....
2008-12-18T22:34:00.000Z	Pelo	UUH	yes, but if you already have a very fast comp with a lot of mem on it , you might not see much of a diff
