2010-07-29T13:46:00.000Z	Sevith	SwedeMike	 I was more or less wondering if they implement tunneling in lucid or they have a separate stack for it
2010-07-29T13:47:00.000Z	SwedeMike	Sevith	afaik nothing has really changed regarding tunneling, no.
2010-07-29T13:48:00.000Z	Sevith	SwedeMike	alright. I was just wondering..too lazy to google. My system is to slow to surf then net right now haha
