2007-07-27T07:54:00.000Z	shadowmancer		just curious, i got a friend that gave me .rar file which he broke up into 23 chunks, with no password
2007-07-27T07:54:00.000Z	shadowmancer		though it is requesting a password
2007-07-27T07:55:00.000Z	lietu	shadowmancer	well if it's requesting a password, then it has a password ;)
