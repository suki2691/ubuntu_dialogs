2008-11-27T12:40:00.000Z	noah		I used to be able to get the xorg.conf into a usable configuration back in the good ole days of 6.06/6.10 but this new-fangled version in Intrepid doesn't seem to care about xorg.conf much
2008-11-27T12:41:00.000Z	Rug	noah	that could be a good thing
2008-11-27T12:41:00.000Z	noah	Rug	except that I don't know any other way to tell it that my monitor supports better than a 480x320 resolution
2008-11-27T12:42:00.000Z	noah	Rug	it was working before, but something broke it and ever since the resolution has gotten bigger each time the machine reboots
