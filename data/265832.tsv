Just browsing your forums I heard something that sparked my interest but I don't wanna try without more detailed instructions for fear that I ruin my computer. My processor is a p4, which i guess is a 686 proccessor. As I installed the 386 version of ubuntu, would updating the kernal to the 686 version have a noticeable performance increase? and if so how should I go about doing it?
2005-12-02T15:39:00.000Z	DianWei		Thanks, for the responses, now installing it. Would i just apt-get a few things or is there more to it?
