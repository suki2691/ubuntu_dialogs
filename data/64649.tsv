2011-07-05T01:50:00.000Z	rjune		I'm using Natty on an HP with a Mobility Radeon X1300. When trying to run glxgears(or bzflag, etc) I get an error saying that extension GLX is missing.
2011-07-05T01:50:00.000Z	rjune		I would love some help getting GLX working

2011-07-05T01:52:00.000Z	rjune	ZykoticK9	yeah, I know that part. I'm trying to figure out what drivers I need
