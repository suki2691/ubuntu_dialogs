2010-05-17T06:43:00.000Z	stone1343		Is there a name for the condition when your Ubuntu system starts getting a message about unsufficient resources, where icons in the top panel become "no entry" or 'X', and the shutdown dialog text is not actually text, but just a bunch of rectangles?

2010-05-17T06:45:00.000Z	stone1343	a94060	yes but I don't even know the slang name for the condition to even start figuring it out
2010-05-17T06:45:00.000Z	a94060	stone1343	maybe the free command will help
