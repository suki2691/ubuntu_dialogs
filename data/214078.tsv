2010-10-16T12:39:00.000Z	snowrichard		i burned a bad cd -- turns out it only downloaded 227 mb of the image.  I'm doing a torrent download instead now
2010-10-16T12:40:00.000Z	snowrichard		but i'm out of cdr's so i'll have to use unetbootin and an external usb drive to install
2010-10-16T12:40:00.000Z	snowrichard		the torrent is going pretty quick
