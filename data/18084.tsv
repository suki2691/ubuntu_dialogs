2011-02-14T00:43:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	Jalaska13	should just be the ip address of the printer
2011-02-14T00:44:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	Jalaska13	actually, nevermind that, i was thinking of a different setup
2011-02-14T00:44:00.000Z	Jalaska13	GeekyAdam	Well, I tried that, but the PC I was on requested the queue url as well
