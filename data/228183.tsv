2005-09-24T11:57:00.000Z	tommi^		Hi. I really need help: My X stopped working after a normal session and a reboot. Xorg.log says it caught signal 11. What could be causing this? tia
2005-09-24T09:55:00.000Z	tommi^		Hi. I'm installing gforge and it is a mess. I'm at a point where apt-get repots "/etc/php4/cgi/php.ini already configured, not changing." and it seems to hang there. How can I get more information from apt-get?
2005-09-24T09:55:00.000Z	Belutz	tommi^	go to #gforge
2005-09-24T09:56:00.000Z	tommi^	Belutz	it's a configuration issue with dpkg's. Not specific to gforge, I guess. But I'll try there too, thanks
