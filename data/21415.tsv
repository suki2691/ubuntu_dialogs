2012-02-22T21:21:00.000Z	esteeven		I have a strange problem in Firefox in Ubuntu. One site renders incorrectly and I can't accurately input data. The input cells all become misaligned. I have played with fonts but that made no difference at all. This is how the page should look > http://i39.tinypic.com/2ev8bi1.png and here's what it actually looks like > http://i41.tinypic.com/ebdgr7.png. This is not happening in Arch or Windows. Only with the 'buntus
2012-02-22T21:21:00.000Z	esteeven		. Any ideas?
