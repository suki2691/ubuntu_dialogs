2007-06-03T09:16:00.000Z	Icehawk78		I had a question about apt-get. I tried running apt-get update, and I got an error.
2007-06-03T09:16:00.000Z	MenZa	Icehawk78	What error?
2007-06-03T09:17:00.000Z	MenZa	Icehawk78	run it as root, and remember to close Synaptic or any other package manager running
2007-06-03T09:17:00.000Z	MenZa	Icehawk78	are you doing sudo?
