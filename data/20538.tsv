2011-05-27T22:08:00.000Z	mellin		In the hosts file if I want to specify a ip range to allow instead of adding each host name and ip how would this look? Would it just be 192.168.1.XXX or 192.168.1.254?
2011-05-27T22:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mellin	 i dont think the hosts file can do a range like that.
2011-05-27T22:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		man hosts     perhaps?
2011-05-27T22:09:00.000Z	mellin	Dr_Willis	ok thank you
