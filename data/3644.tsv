2012-05-06T23:15:00.000Z	ulkesh	semitones_tea	yup, i'm trying to add another user to see if that route will help
2012-05-06T23:45:00.000Z	ulkesh	semitones_tea	turns out it wasn't the login.keyring (regardless of anyone's crass remarks about not backing it up :) )...it was a bad .profile that was doing something odd (it has an issue doing an export PATH twice)
2012-05-06T23:46:00.000Z	ulkesh	semitones_tea	so thanks for attempting to help...i'm all good now and can login just fine
