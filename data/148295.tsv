2008-07-02T18:37:00.000Z	Vlet	nixnoob	"support" is the wrong word. It would be more apropriate to say that there are a high frequency of problems when upgrading between versions
2008-07-02T18:38:00.000Z	nixnoob	Vlet	i guess im lucky then.
2008-07-02T18:38:00.000Z	Vlet	nixnoob	yeah, it's not like EVERYONE has problems... It tends to depend on your system and what hardware you have
