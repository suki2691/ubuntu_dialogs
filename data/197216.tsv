2010-07-05T13:47:00.000Z	MattoD		Hi all, a bit of a newb question, I am currently using server 9.04 do you strongly recommend upgrading to 10.04
2010-07-05T13:49:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	MattoD	I'd read the release notes of 10.04 prior to upgrading.. and I'd advise against upgrading as it is hardly ever done cleanly
2010-07-05T13:51:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	MattoD	in my past experiences I have had failed upgrades so I refused to go down the upgrade path.. if I were to put a new version, I'd do a clean install
2010-07-05T13:52:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	MattoD	no worries
