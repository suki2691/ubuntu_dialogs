2007-04-03T16:10:00.000Z	Soliko		hi,
2007-04-03T16:12:00.000Z	Soliko		I am trying to install telnet server but I can't find the right package in apt-get...
2007-04-03T16:12:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Soliko	Don't install a telnet server... Use openssh-server instead.
2007-04-03T16:15:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Soliko	Use SSH anyway, it's vastly superior...
