2010-04-23T04:23:00.000Z	Scunizi		Is it correct to use smbfs in a fstab file instead of cifs when mounting a samba share that on my machine?
2010-04-23T04:24:00.000Z	Scunizi		*that's
2010-04-23T04:24:00.000Z	psusi	Scunizi	smbfs and cifs are the same thing
2010-04-23T04:25:00.000Z	Scunizi	psusi	so are they interchangeable in fstab?  or will one work and the other not
