2009-08-28T11:46:00.000Z	fejkjfoeijf		I wanted to install virtualbox - listed first is the deb, that doesn't install (missing dependencies) and wifi (wiki) doesn't have apt-get -i written next to it, and below the deb downloads they have sources listed (below) - how can I remove an unconfigured deb from my system?
2009-08-28T11:46:00.000Z	fejkjfoeijf		or can I add the source and apt-get install it and it will configure?
