2011-07-22T23:50:00.000Z	Spikestuff		Now once I edit /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname and perform the hostname command, should I reboot to implement the changes?
2011-07-22T23:51:00.000Z	Spikestuff		I already did that, dr_willis, but my hostname is still the same.
2011-07-22T23:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	Spikestuff	 you missed a step then i am guessing.
2011-07-22T23:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	Spikestuff	 do the changes then reboot.
