I was able to update and install ntfs-3g. Now I'm not so sure how to use ntfs-3g to set read and write permissions to the external. Do you know?
2008-09-20T07:41:00.000Z	ceil420	nabiko	glad you got it installed, but i don't know how to use it. when i installed linux, i never looked back at Windows or anything to do with it
2008-09-20T07:41:00.000Z	nabiko	ceil420	alright. I'll just ask again for anyone to answer.
2008-09-20T07:42:00.000Z	ceil420	nabiko	good luck
