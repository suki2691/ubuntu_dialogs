2007-12-05T08:36:00.000Z	orochi_		Anyway :> Hello...I'm creating a GPG key so that I can sign e-mail correspondences over webmail...what would be a reasonable key size to ensure that the e-mails can't be read by, e.g. Google's casual scanning for advertisments? :>
2007-12-05T08:37:00.000Z	kelsin	orochi_	pretty much anything, the default gpg key size is plenty
2007-12-05T08:38:00.000Z	orochi_	kelsin	Rubin: Thanks, I'll take both of those into consideration :> Maybe I'll take a look at the whole README anyway
