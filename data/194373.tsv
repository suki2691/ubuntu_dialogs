2006-11-22T15:57:00.000Z	endersbean3k1		Yea, I already read about all the 'sudo' stuff... either I just don't understand what I'm supposed to do or it's not working
2006-11-22T15:58:00.000Z	endersbean3k1		I did, but I really can't figure it out.
2006-11-22T15:58:00.000Z	stalefries	endersbean3k1	precede every command that need root powers with 'sudo '
