2006-04-20T09:23:00.000Z	joh6nn	green_earz	i've got $10 says he just rm'ed something important
2006-04-20T09:26:00.000Z	green_earz	joh6nn	i was thinking that he may have been have a problem with a dir that got a space in its name that why the " "   hope he not killed is setup
2006-04-20T09:27:00.000Z	joh6nn	green_earz	a good thought, but the way he logged off immediately after you told him that is suspicious, no?
