2010-03-14T10:17:00.000Z	wolf2k_ubuntu		Evening/morning. Something's acting up on my ubuntu VM. I can't use AIM or visit particular websites, yet on my Mac OS X host, I'm able to do all of that. Pidgin claimed the problem was this:  No address associated with hostname. How exactly do I diagnose this problem?
