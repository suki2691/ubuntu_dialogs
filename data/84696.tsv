2008-07-24T08:37:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer	Zooback	i find the oposite, i have much more speed with ubuntu, on the net, than with windows

2008-07-24T08:42:00.000Z	Zooback	ManualOverDozer	i'm not using any plugins in firefox, currently i trying to run 8.04 from the live cd to see if any results change
