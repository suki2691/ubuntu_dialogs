2011-06-21T23:10:00.000Z	foufis		hi, a question on removing kernel 2.6.38.10..which file should i mark on synaptic to do this?linux-image-2.6.38.10generic-pae, linux-header-2.6.38.10-generic pae or both?
2011-06-21T23:11:00.000Z	wols	foufis	both
2011-06-21T23:11:00.000Z	wols	foufis	the kernel is the "image" file but the headers file doesn't make any sense without the image
2011-06-21T23:12:00.000Z	foufis	wols	oh ok...removal or complete removal?
