2011-07-14T16:01:00.000Z	bazhang	rsmarples	remove the ppa?
2011-07-14T16:02:00.000Z	rsmarples	bazhang	yes, but my question is probably better as - how do i do a manual install of the driver so i can use the ppa once a newer one get in
2011-07-14T16:03:00.000Z	bazhang	rsmarples	a newer one gets in where? you have to remove the ppa one, take it out of your sources.list then install from additional drivers (ie jockey-gtk)
