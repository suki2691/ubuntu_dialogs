2007-10-23T07:06:00.000Z	bignickmetro		so i am a windows comp tech by profession with no experience with Linux. I am having a couple problems with my install.
2007-10-23T07:07:00.000Z	bignickmetro		i boot from CD, i get the boot menu, it starts loading. i get a couple of PCI IRQ errors then get a terminal
2007-10-23T07:07:00.000Z	bignickmetro		how do i just boot to a graphical install
2007-10-23T07:08:00.000Z	jimmygoon	bignickmetro	you'll have to describe the error more clearly or else use the alternative install disc (its very just as simple, just slower)
