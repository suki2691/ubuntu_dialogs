2011-07-08T09:57:00.000Z	Karen_m	dr_willis	they moved it to somewhere else... wherever ubuntu saves all the passwords is where they are listed now
2011-07-08T09:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	Karen_m	you mean the ubuntu/gnome keyring?
2011-07-08T10:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	Karen_m	 run 'seahorse' is one way to get to it
