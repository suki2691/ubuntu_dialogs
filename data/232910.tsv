2008-11-17T04:49:00.000Z	chaqui1		I wanted to get the latest one, and that installes the last stable version
2008-11-17T04:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	chaqui1	winehq.org has ubuntu repos that work quite well
2008-11-17T05:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	chaqui1	in a estable ubuntu release there are not software upgrades so if you want newer fglrx version you will have to use envyng and take the risk
