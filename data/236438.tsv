2006-08-08T10:57:00.000Z	TGM		I'm trying to install fonts via sudo nautilus- I've come in here and asked for directions, I go to the fonts:/// directory and try pasteing them in there however they never copy into the folder. The only other way i know how to do this is one at a time and I would rather avoid that slower option, is there something else I can do to install several fonts at once?
