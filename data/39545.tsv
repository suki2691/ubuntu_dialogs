2010-03-21T22:32:00.000Z	Losha	JustMozzy	when I was lad, service tags were machine specific, so you couldn't just insure one machine and then swap the innards around when the others break. They're on to that...
2010-03-21T22:33:00.000Z	JustMozzy	Losha	would it be possible to track a machine with its service tag? (just a thought)
2010-03-21T22:34:00.000Z	Losha	JustMozzy	depends what you mean by 'track'. By whom? For what? Tracked how?
