2007-10-19T00:59:00.000Z	Clearze1	stiev3	twinview is an extended desktop and seperate x would be a double x session
2007-10-19T00:59:00.000Z	stiev3	Dr_willis	what would be the primary purpose of 2 x sessions?
2007-10-19T01:00:00.000Z	Clearze1	stiev3	if you are controlling more than 1 linux system at once.
