2008-02-09T12:11:00.000Z	iNuswo		am having a problem with my sound. Alsa drivers have been configured/installed according to alsa wiki for the model. a) no sound plays at all b) symptoms include when any file or media is played that includes audio it (the media) freezes after a few seconds c) on streamed media if after the media freezes I click the timeline anywhere it will play shortly again then freeze again. Any ideas where I should start looking?
