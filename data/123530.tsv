2007-12-05T23:30:00.000Z	romantik		i have bought a 1 GB memory card for my MP4 player (microSD from SanDisk) and there was also a TransFlash Adapter alongside with that 1 GB memory card... i wanna know what is that TransFlash Adapter for? it can't fit anywhere in the MP4 player's slots... is it for a digital camera perhaps or a mobile phone?
