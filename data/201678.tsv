2009-11-30T02:27:00.000Z	hikenboot	ssam	in this case i forgot to mention i am talking about the source rpm
2009-11-30T02:28:00.000Z	ssam	hikenboot	ok, not sure about alien and source rpms. still might be better to find the source tar.gz. what is the package
2009-11-30T02:32:00.000Z	hikenboot	ssam	thats what i am doing now but the script i am using to install it is conveluted and is using some magic to transfer it to a chroot
