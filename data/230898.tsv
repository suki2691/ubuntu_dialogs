2005-12-22T09:31:00.000Z	arnold		I got a little question. Sometimes i get a message upon booting:  root filesystem not checked for 30 times, check forced. And then the filesystem is scanned. Is it something i should worry about??
2005-12-22T09:32:00.000Z	arnold		Okay thanks. But why? I dont think that the 5.4 version did it
2005-12-22T09:33:00.000Z	Kyral	arnold	It did
2005-12-22T09:33:00.000Z	Kyral	arnold	Its a standard thing on all Linux distros
