2009-05-15T04:20:00.000Z	d-admin		I'm trying to do a dist upgrade from 8.04 to 9.04, but my system is not behaving as it says it would on the website

2009-05-15T04:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	d-admin	you have to  change something so it will let you upgrade to 8.10
2009-05-15T04:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	d-admin	you have to tell it that you wan't non LTS releases as well
