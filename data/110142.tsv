2007-12-10T06:45:00.000Z	zlk		can someone tell me why i cant compile MPlayer with my ubuntu distro?  probably has something to do with libc?  when i ./configure i get "Error: Cannot find header either inttypes.h or bitypes.h.  There is no chance for compilation to succeed."
2007-12-10T06:46:00.000Z	zlk		because synaptic wont install it
2007-12-10T06:46:00.000Z	sunogbaga	zlk	just sudo apt-get install mplayer
