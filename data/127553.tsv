2007-07-20T06:49:00.000Z	JasonWoof		how do I run my own window manager?
2007-07-20T06:50:00.000Z	JasonWoof		I see a pulldown at the gdm login thing, you can pick "run Xclient script"... I made ~/.xclient ~/.Xclient ~/.xinitrc ~/.Xinitrc ~/Xclient ~/xclient ~/Xinitrc and ~/xinitrc and it loads gnome anyway
2007-07-20T06:50:00.000Z	irvine	JasonWoof	select it in the login screen
2007-07-20T06:51:00.000Z	JasonWoof	irvine	I don't want one of them from the list, I want it to run my script
