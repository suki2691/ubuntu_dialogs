2008-09-04T23:28:00.000Z	also_Tom		anyone know how I would go about using more than one device to connect to the internet at a time, I have 2 wireless cards, and one wired, and would like to know how to go about getting them all running at the same time, any ideas?
2008-09-04T23:29:00.000Z	negge	also_Tom	you can easily connect them all, the trick is to decide what traffic should go through which interface
2008-09-04T23:29:00.000Z	negge	also_Tom	I don't know how but it should be possible to for example route BitTorrent traffic through one interface and the rest through another
2008-09-04T23:31:00.000Z	also_Tom	negge	I am using the networking doodad on the bottom that "auto configures" pretty much everything, except the encryption, it does not allow me to connect using more than one device at time, is there another way I should go about this?
