2009-09-27T20:38:00.000Z	unimatrix	TheCheeze	same as on windows
2009-09-27T20:39:00.000Z	TheCheeze	unimatrix	that does not answer the question
2009-09-27T20:40:00.000Z	TheCheeze	unimatrix	the most probable reason is that I do not believe that ubunti has a "system idle process" like windows does, so it feeds a tiny bit of cpu to the runing apps instead
