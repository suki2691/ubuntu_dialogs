2007-12-01T02:16:00.000Z	mrball	quangle	I installed the Terminus font on a recommendation of a coworker.  Works ok for Gnome apps.
2007-12-01T02:16:00.000Z	quangle	mrball	thanks. is there a good default font though?
2007-12-01T02:17:00.000Z	mrball	quangle	In the end, I ended up sticking with Monospace (because in terminus the difference between () and {} was very difficult to see) and disabling bold.  Then my mutt looks right.
