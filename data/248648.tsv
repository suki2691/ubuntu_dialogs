2006-06-10T07:09:00.000Z	Inf3ctedFx		Hello everyone
2006-06-10T07:10:00.000Z	Inf3ctedFx		does anybody knows what "try to boot with noapic" means?
2006-06-10T07:11:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Inf3ctedFx	You have to pass argument 'noapic' to kernel at booting
2006-06-10T07:14:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Inf3ctedFx	'noapic' has nothing to do with internet connection, AFAIK
