2009-11-19T15:08:00.000Z	xci		hey guys, is there any fix available to this "unable to enumerate usb" bug even now? this has been bugging me for a half a year at least, and it seems that in ubuntu bugs it is still not resolved
2009-11-19T15:09:00.000Z	jongbergs	xci	when does the error occur?
2009-11-19T15:10:00.000Z	xci	jongbergs	well, my dmesg does no reaction when I plug my mobile phone in and also the phone does not recognize that it has been plugged in
2009-11-19T15:11:00.000Z	xci	jongbergs	and on previous lines of dmesg there is this unable to enumerate blaah
