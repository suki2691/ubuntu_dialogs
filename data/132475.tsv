2008-01-28T22:19:00.000Z	adelie	kompute1	well, if you are still having the issue with a traveling mouse, you are either using a laser mouse on something that was never meant to be a mousepad (very shiny surface or black metalic surface) or you are using a wireless mouse whose battery is about to die
2008-01-28T22:34:00.000Z	adelie	kompute1	??? you may have a key stuck on your mouse. have you tried another mouse? also, check your universal access settings, just in case if you get the same behavior with a different mouse. just something that has happened to me when I get weird HID issues
