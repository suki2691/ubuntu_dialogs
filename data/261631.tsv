2006-01-21T13:05:00.000Z	mistik1		hello guys
2006-01-21T13:05:00.000Z	mistik1		I am upgrading to ubuntu from another debian based system, I cannot seem to pull in the new Xorg packages with apt-get
2006-01-21T13:06:00.000Z	mistik1		Is this a known issue and if so where is this process documented?
2006-01-21T13:06:00.000Z	Seveas	mistik1	such upgrades are nut sopported and highly likely to go wrong
