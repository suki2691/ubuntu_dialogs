2010-11-04T18:42:00.000Z	shomon		hi, how do I find out what files are in a .deb or apt package?
2010-11-04T18:42:00.000Z	shomon		specifically, I'm trying to find out where to get /usr/lib/php5/20090626+lfs/mysql.so
2010-11-04T18:42:00.000Z	vu1kan	shomon	open the .deb with gdebi...one of the tabs shows you what's in it
2010-11-04T18:44:00.000Z	vu1kan	shomon	oic...idk, i know it's possible, but i'm not sure how
