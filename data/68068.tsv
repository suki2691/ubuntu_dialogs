2009-01-21T13:44:00.000Z	IchiFish	paul68	adapt what manually each time?
2009-01-21T13:54:00.000Z	paul68	IchiFish	well now I have to adapt each time the proxy settings and want to have this done automaticly
2009-01-21T13:55:00.000Z	IchiFish	paul68	I don't know how to do this off the top of my head, search for ubuntu network profile setups
