2009-08-18T23:33:00.000Z	Autocompliant		The instructions for installing this plugin for Pidgin say "2. Type `make' to compile the package." but when I type "make" into the Terminal I get the error message: "make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop."..... What am I doing wrong?

2009-08-18T23:34:00.000Z	Autocompliant		that worked fine
