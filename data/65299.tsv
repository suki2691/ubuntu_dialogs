2012-08-16T05:22:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Ping-Win	open the Synaptic Package Manager and make sure that you have "apt" installed
2012-08-16T05:22:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Ping-Win	if not, check the box and install it. then re-run the last command in terminal
2012-08-16T05:30:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Ping-Win	is that command working now?
