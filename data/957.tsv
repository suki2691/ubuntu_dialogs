2012-09-28T20:26:00.000Z	ejo		Help!  I'm on Ubuntu 12.10... deja-dup (backup) keeps failing with error code 500 when backing up to Ubuntu One.  I have it set to back up a single folder with only about 50MB of contents.  It's not out of space.  It normally works OK but for the past two days it has failed over and over with error 500.
2012-09-28T20:26:00.000Z	ejo		I have deleted the remote folder and re-established it, but to no avail.

2012-09-28T20:36:00.000Z	ejo	chris92	my mistake!  I am on 12.04... when I wrote 12.10 it was just a mental slip.  I have never run future versions.
