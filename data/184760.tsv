2006-12-20T12:02:00.000Z	Tango_Down		Hello, I have an ATI rage card with 128 MB of ram. I have the r128 drivers installed. When I try and start GLX gears I find that I get approximatly 1 frame every 3 seconds. Admitadly, my hardware is old. ( a 480mhz with 256 megs of ram) but I should be able to do better than a frame every couple of seconds

2006-12-20T12:13:00.000Z	jakub_	Tango_Down	paste the output of dmesg before and after you sudo rmmod r128 (or whatever the driver is exactly) && sudo modprobe r128 (or whatever the driver is exactly), also paste the output of lspci on some sort of pastebin
