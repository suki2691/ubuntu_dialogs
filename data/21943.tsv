2010-12-15T18:50:00.000Z	Varista`nb		Hello I have a quick question about netbook edition: I have a 64 bit netbook and I'd like to be able to use a 64 bit version, but I don't see an x64 netbook ( go figure, I think my proccessor is the only 64 bit atom ). Is there a reason I should use netbook instead of desktop x64?

2010-12-15T18:50:00.000Z	gobbe	Varista`nb	you could use just desktop edition and install unity after installing
2010-12-15T18:56:00.000Z	Varista`nb	gobbe	Do I need to do anything special to install unity or can I just install the desktop edition and apt-get or something?
