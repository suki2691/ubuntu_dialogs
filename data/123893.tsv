2008-05-25T06:01:00.000Z	cdm10	xenos_	6.06 can be directly upgraded to 8.04
2008-05-25T06:01:00.000Z	cdm10	xenos_	but besides that, it has to go one at a time... so 6.10 --> 7.04 --> 7.10 --> 8.04
2008-05-25T06:08:00.000Z	cdm10	xenos_	if you've done that, then you'll have to go release-by-release to 8.04 :(
