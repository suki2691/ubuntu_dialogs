2009-04-30T20:59:00.000Z	samdamsam		Hey guys I was just changing the color of my download speed in the little realtime chart in my system monitor and it worked fine. Then For some reason it said my download or upload speed was zero when it wasnt so I closed the system monitor and reopened it. Now I can only see my download speed, not my upload speed and I cant/dont know how to add the upload speed sensor. Any help? Thanks
