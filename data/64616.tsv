2010-07-20T02:57:00.000Z	jwatt		when I try to install 10.10 alpha 2 from DVD, after selecting English and choosing Install, I just get a black window with a blinking cursor in the top left
2010-07-20T02:57:00.000Z	jwatt		is that a known issue?
2010-07-20T02:58:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	jwatt	reask same question in #ubuntu+1
