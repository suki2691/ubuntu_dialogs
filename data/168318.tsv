2007-09-18T07:06:00.000Z	Max_-		Hi y'all, I just installed the following packages and their dependencies : apache2, libapache2-mod-php5, mysql-server, php5-mysql. Now I'm installing a software which requires a cgi-bin directory and I notice there are none  yet, so I guess CGI is not yet supported... What package do I need to add to my configuration so that I get that cgi-bin directory and cgi support?

2007-09-18T07:08:00.000Z	Pelo	Max_-	 you need to sort throught them or try extra keywords that's all I can advise
2007-09-18T07:09:00.000Z	Max_-	Pelo	: thanks, anyone knows the package I need?!
