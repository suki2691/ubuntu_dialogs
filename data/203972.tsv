2006-01-17T16:52:00.000Z	ompaul	platos	fine, may I ask that do you not promote dapper in this channel yet as new users *will* try it and then be upset when it fails, and btw that info on edubuntu and sound is useful for me also :-)
2006-01-17T16:53:00.000Z	platos	ompaul	well then a last warning: dapper is still in beta with lots 'o' bugs don't try this if you don't want irritation :P
