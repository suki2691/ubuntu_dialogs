2012-09-05T01:35:00.000Z	makezan		hey I got a question. this has been bothering me for some days now. I am trying to intsall ubuntu server. And i've done this over and over again several times, but for some reason it gets stuck at the screen where I have to get dhcp. Centos, windows 8 R2, BSD, and even a very old Gentoo version worked. but for some reason ubuntu won't get passed it, I burned several cds too and several arch type. 12.04 32 and 64
