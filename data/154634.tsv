2007-02-14T13:33:00.000Z	plagerism		I am planning on creating a cluster(which kind and how I dont know) and I want to be able to deploy all nodes from the master using either a diskless system or a pxe network install.  I found a guide for using systemimager with 6.0.6 to deploy images across many computers, however in feisty the latest version of systemimager is fairly old(3.2.3).  Because I have no idea how well systemimager works, I am wondering
2007-02-14T13:33:00.000Z	plagerism		 if anyone has experience using either systemimager or can suggest another approach to deploy images to nodes on a cluster
