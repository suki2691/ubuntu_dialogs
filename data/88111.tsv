2009-11-03T21:36:00.000Z	mvalviar		hi i downloaded ubuntustudio-alternate-i386.iso and create a startup disk from it. I booted from it but it doesnt have the option to "try ubuntu without a change to your computer"
2009-11-03T21:38:00.000Z	mvalviar		is it difficult to use the alternate cd? I tried earlier there is no nice gui in there
2009-11-03T21:38:00.000Z	mvalviar		will i have the option to partition my drive the way i want?
2009-11-03T21:38:00.000Z	philh	mvalviar	it wasn't the most pleasant of experiences the last time i tried
