2012-10-13T19:18:00.000Z	darkelfjuggalo		I'm trying to make a USB install stick for latest Ubuntu for a 64-bit...every method I've tried, including a the pendrive program available in windows, fail...I know 64-bit is crap for installing Linux, but it's the only laptop available with the specs I needed

2012-10-13T19:21:00.000Z	darkelfjuggalo		unfortunately learning that destroyed my windows OS[which i wanted to get rid of in the first place] now I can't go back and fix whatever was wrong
