2009-07-04T01:33:00.000Z	Apollo2366	kane77	System -> Preferences -> Appearence
2009-07-04T01:33:00.000Z	kane77	Apollo2366	yes I had trouble with audacity too (and still have), as far as I remember recording worked with recordmydesktop (you have to select what device you want to use in volume control and also make sure it is not muted in recording tab..
2009-07-04T01:34:00.000Z	kane77	Apollo2366	I meant more of ~/.gnome/....something :)
