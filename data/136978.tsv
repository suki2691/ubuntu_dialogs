2007-04-24T14:54:00.000Z	MajorApus		why is the ntfs read only?
2007-04-24T14:56:00.000Z	MajorApus		okay so they are all mounted, but I have no access on winxp, readonly on data1 (fine for now) rw on data2 and only r on data3
2007-04-24T14:56:00.000Z	MajorApus		data 3 needs to be rw
2007-04-24T14:56:00.000Z	GuHHH	MajorApus	you are not root there.
