2008-09-02T14:27:00.000Z	nnnulll		im trying to get firefox to accept a symbolic link as a mailto program instead of evolution but i doesnt want to accept my alias.sh
2008-09-02T14:28:00.000Z	thefish	nnnulll	probably stupid question, but is the alias.sh +x?
2008-09-02T14:28:00.000Z	thefish	nnnulll	executable
2008-09-02T14:29:00.000Z	thefish	nnnulll	chmod 755 alias.sh - see if that works
