2010-06-22T00:25:00.000Z	hello_kitty		I made a hello world C program following a tutorial.  When I try to run it by typing ./myprogram I get an error: "cannot execute binary file"  do I need to provide a path to whatever runs binary files, or something....??
2010-06-22T00:25:00.000Z	{n8}	hello_kitty	did you chmod it?
2010-06-22T00:26:00.000Z	hello_kitty	{n8}	I did chmod +x myprogram    is that sufficient?
2010-06-22T00:26:00.000Z	{n8}	hello_kitty	yeah
