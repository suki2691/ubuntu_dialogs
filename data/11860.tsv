2011-07-17T20:46:00.000Z	szrfph		I'm running Ubuntu 10.4 LTS with a Realtek RTL8111/8168B PCI Network card using the r8169 kernel driver. I hibernated the system, rebooted into windows and then went back to ubuntu, but it failed to come out of hibernation, instead just booting up from scratch. Since then I can't get access to the 'net. Anyone know what's happening?
