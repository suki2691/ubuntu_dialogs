2005-06-11T11:23:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley_		Hi, I'm trying to share a folder in my home directory by right clicking and clicking share folder. This share shows up on a windows computer but when I try and access it I get asked for a username and password. Any ideas? Thanks :)

2005-06-11T11:24:00.000Z	Mr_Smiley_	ushooz	well i don't really want it to ask for a username and password at all
