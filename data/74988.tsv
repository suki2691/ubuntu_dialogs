2008-11-23T09:00:00.000Z	bitmouse		or to prevent the corruption? also Gparted seems to be doing the same thing unfortunetly

2008-11-23T09:28:00.000Z	bitmouse	mhall119	can I do that in the ubuntu installer? or should I just use the 8.04 installer? it will upgrade the kernel through aptitude anyways right?
