2005-08-07T14:21:00.000Z	sravi		So is it possible to start a TTY session onther than CTRL-ALT-F1/2/3.. ?

2005-08-07T14:22:00.000Z	sravi	Razor-X	what I am asking is if it is safe to say that if the session is "tty", as opposed to "pts", that it can be considered secure and did not come in over the network
