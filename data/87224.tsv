2008-06-21T03:47:00.000Z	rodolfo		I have a ton of linux kernel versions! If I remove some, will it put the system in danger?
2008-06-21T03:48:00.000Z	raisefist2	rodolfo	: no you wont really booting from the lastest kernel should be fine however if you want to be careful then keep the version before just in case
2008-06-21T03:52:00.000Z	rodolfo	raisefist2	I'm afraid the current kernel is still under development. thus, are not considerable 'stable'. In fact, I don't read all the details that comes with linux kernel when the update manager gets it installed...
