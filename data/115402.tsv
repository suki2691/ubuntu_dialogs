2007-10-24T18:35:00.000Z	tofukitty		I'm downloading ubuntu 7.04 through wubi and installing that way, anyone know if it's possible for me to kill windows from ubuntu to reclaim the entire HDD, and then upgrade to 7.10?

2007-10-24T18:37:00.000Z	tofukitty	LjL	problem is i have no LiveCD and can't boot from USB, and have no space left for a new partition, so Wubi seems to be the only way for me to get ubuntu running...
