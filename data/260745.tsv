2006-11-26T15:11:00.000Z	Cyberai		can anyone tell me where ubuntu keeps the config that tells a compiler which installed kernel tree to compile against?
2006-11-26T15:11:00.000Z	Cyberai		I'm trying to run the NVidia installer, but it keeps compiling against a kernel I updated to, but then I went back to a previous kernel.

2006-11-26T15:13:00.000Z	jbroome	Cyberai	is your /usr/src/linux symlink pointing to the old kernel?
