2007-08-08T14:54:00.000Z	Hadron		I created a dvd holding all the packages I installed on my development machine using "aptoncd". I then ran aptoncd on my laptop. But how to tell the laptop to *install* all these packages? In other words how do I get a list of installed packages and duplicate it on another machine.
