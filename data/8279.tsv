2011-10-31T19:46:00.000Z	Tricen		Two graphics cards: Intel onboard 3100 and GeForce FX 5600 PCI.  I want to stretch my desktop across them, but the Intel does not show up in "displays".  It DOES show the "Ubuntu" logo on startup, but that's all.  When I remove the PCI card, the Intel works great.  Any ideas all?
