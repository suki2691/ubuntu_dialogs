2008-07-30T00:35:00.000Z	Fishscene		Hello everyone
2008-07-30T00:35:00.000Z	Fishscene		I'm curious as to how to edit my fstab to auto-mount an internal hard drive to a specific directory. I followed a tutorial, but it doesn't seem to be working.
2008-07-30T00:37:00.000Z	Fishscene		Does anyone know how to edit fstab?
