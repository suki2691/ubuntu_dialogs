2008-04-23T21:56:00.000Z	koro	Bidget	I copied a folder from a fat32 drive to a (fat32) pendrive using windows, and now when i look at them from ubuntu the copied folder (in the pendrive) shows up correctly but the source one shows incorrect non-ascii characters (e.g. accented characters are displayed as weird symbols)
