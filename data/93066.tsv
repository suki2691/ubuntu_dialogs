2008-06-01T22:45:00.000Z	javagamer		I have quite a problem.  My CPU appeared to be overheating, so I checked the stock cooler.  When I discovered it was loose I decided to remove it and put it on properly.  I got it to fir nicely, but now I can't even finish booting before the computer shuts off (presumably because it thinks the CPU is over 100C).  I have the cover off and I can touch the heatsink, but the CPU thinks it's overheating.  What could I have done wrong?
