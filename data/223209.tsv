2005-09-21T10:16:00.000Z	jrattner1		I got a question, when the new ubuntu is installed, I'm going to reinstall my system from fresh, could i make a partition to keep my music in so i dont lose it?
2005-09-21T10:17:00.000Z	durt	jrattner1	you probably could make and extended partition and use it for the /home directory
2005-09-21T10:17:00.000Z	jrattner1	durt	is it worth doing
2005-09-21T10:18:00.000Z	durt	jrattner1	dont ask me... ;)
