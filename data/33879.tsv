2010-05-01T04:20:00.000Z	Ken8521	xenbomb	sys/admn/login window.
2010-05-01T04:13:00.000Z	Ken8521	xenbomb	i believe you set that under either users(sys/admin/users and groups)
2010-05-01T04:21:00.000Z	Ken8521	xenbomb	you don't really need caps here, if you say someones full username, and they have alerts set up, it will alert them you said their name
