2010-01-27T10:37:00.000Z	Myke1		Hey all got a question about an Ubuntu install. I just installed Ubuntu 9.10 on a computer, and after the post I get directed to a text log-in prompt. I log in and then it tells me how many packages can be up dated then it seems like an error message saying "Intel AES-NI instructions not detected"... anyone care to share their wealth of knowlege on this one?
2010-01-27T10:38:00.000Z	Myke1		it does let me put in commands in the terminal prompt though
2010-01-27T10:39:00.000Z	Myke1		Anyone know the command to update the system packages in terminal? maybe that would work?
2010-01-27T10:39:00.000Z	Flannel	Myke1	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
