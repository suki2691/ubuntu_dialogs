2009-01-22T22:55:00.000Z	johan12		i'm running xubuntu on a 5-6 year old acer travelmate, i'm trying to make it run faster any ideas? read somewhere that you could uninstall x.org, is it good or bad?

2009-01-22T22:56:00.000Z	Gnea	johan12	but yes, it could speed things up - or, you could install a distro that's less memory/proc intensive, such as Xubuntu or EliveCD
