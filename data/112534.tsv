2007-11-29T09:09:00.000Z	pseudo21088		having some problems booting ubuntu, i can't run a live cd, i had to install off the alternative, and now the only way i can get it to do anything is to use recovery mode in grub? i am using 7.10 alternate x64 on a brand new quad core machine?

2007-11-29T09:09:00.000Z	scguy318	pseudo21088	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-11-29T09:10:00.000Z	pseudo21088	scguy318	k, but you'd think that it would be fine after a fresh install
