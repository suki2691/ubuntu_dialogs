2007-12-16T21:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bert_	 trying to mount a windows share that has spaces in the names?
2007-12-16T21:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bert_	 its a VERY bad idea/habbit to use spaces like that.. use Underscores if you want to  linux_stuff
2007-12-16T21:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bert_	 if you are just addicted to spaces. you could link 'windows stuff' to 'windows_stuff'
