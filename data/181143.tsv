2007-08-22T10:54:00.000Z	Stuttergart		I have a gutsy box that is incrementing the label on it's ethernet interface after every reboot. So it started at eth0 and it is now up to eth9. It seems as though this is some kind of problem with persistent device naming in udev but I'm not sure how to fix it.
2007-08-22T10:54:00.000Z	bruenig	Stuttergart	can it get to eth10?
