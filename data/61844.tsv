2009-10-06T20:46:00.000Z	nat2610_		hey I just reinatelled ubuntu, I installed pidgin but the thing I can't understand is that instead of going into the top right of the screen when I click on the close button, it really quit the application, I'm almost sure before I reinstalled it, that not do that
2009-10-06T20:46:00.000Z	nat2610_		how can I get back the the previous behaviour ?
