2011-07-27T21:09:00.000Z	ldr		Tomas: apt-add-repository ppa.. always worked fine for me
2011-07-27T21:09:00.000Z	frostschutz	ldr	reserve=        [KNL,BUGS] Force the kernel to ignore some iomem area
2011-07-27T21:09:00.000Z	frostschutz	ldr	might be a workaround against some bug on some systems, might not make any difference for you specifically
