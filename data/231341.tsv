2005-07-08T06:32:00.000Z	zyth	J2Dope	how do you intend to 'convert' it to NTFS?
2005-07-08T06:33:00.000Z	J2Dope	zyth	yes., my pc situation here has changed. im using laptops more and my desktop ubuntu is rarely used
2005-07-08T06:34:00.000Z	zyth	J2Dope	no, you don't understand, what do you intend to use to do this conversion? I'm unaware of any convert ext3--->ntfs programs
