2008-08-20T02:33:00.000Z	Slart	Daemonik	if you keep it slim it will be enough..but it's a bit on the small side
2008-08-20T02:34:00.000Z	Daemonik	Slart	yeah, just got this EEE PC here and am wondering if the 4GB SSD is faster than the 16GB SSD. It has two internal it turns out.
2008-08-20T02:37:00.000Z	Slart	Daemonik	ah..I have no doubt you can squeeze in an ubuntu install on those 4GB.. but you won't have much space left over
