2011-07-22T23:08:00.000Z	dante123		but still resolution is 1024x768 terry, I believe there is soemthing wrong with lcd screen sending incorrect or messed up edid info to the system....hence it does not know that this can support 1024x600..
2011-07-22T23:10:00.000Z	dante123		10.10 and upgrade is not part of the problem really, something wrong with edid info and the system does  not realize that this lcd monitor can go into 1024x600....I am trying to force it somethow into 1024x600...becase then all will be well in the universe
