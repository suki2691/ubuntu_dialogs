2006-07-08T16:23:00.000Z	kizzume		I'm trying to install drivers for my nvidia card, and it's requring the location of the kernel source, and I've tried doing a --kernel-source-path in the command line for every location that the find option could locate kernel-source, but none of them are what the driver install wizard wants.  Does anyone know which directory it's looking for?  I've installed the kernel source with apt-get.
