2010-07-27T23:20:00.000Z	Phoshi		Hallo there, everyone! I come with a query. I'm trying to install Ubuntu 10.04 on a dell, except when I boot I can sometimes get to the initial menu screen that asks for language and so, but mostly just get a blinking _ and nothing more. I know the disc is good, it's worked in other PCs and booted up fine in a virtual machine on this PC, it's just not working if I /actually/  try and boot from it!
2010-07-27T23:21:00.000Z	Phoshi		not something I have any experience with, the disc itself failing to boot, so I thought I'd pop along here and ask if anybody knows what's up?
