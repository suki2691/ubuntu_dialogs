2012-05-23T02:27:00.000Z	willie_	Aprel	SHould I get a second one though?
2012-05-23T02:28:00.000Z	willie_		Could I ask an opinion really quick: Is getting a second monitor worth it? Does it increase your productivity at all? Is Ubuntu *automagically* compatible with multiple monitors?
2012-05-23T02:30:00.000Z	Aprel	willie_	I use 2 monitors. Can't say i'm anymore prodictive. switching desktops in ubuntu is just as useful for me
