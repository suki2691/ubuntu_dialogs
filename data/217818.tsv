2007-04-24T10:26:00.000Z	psusi	ogami1972	oh yea?  want to see something cooler?  I wanted to read the linux kernel mailing list... but it would overflow my pop account to subscribe, so I wrote a shell script to go to the lkml.org web site and wget each message from there, and shove them into a maildir I can access with imap
