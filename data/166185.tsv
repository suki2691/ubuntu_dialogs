2008-08-11T19:19:00.000Z	tobias__		I need to know where the /localhost/ folder is located so i can put my php files
2008-08-11T19:19:00.000Z	wols	tobias__	no. ubuntu comes with everything lamp has. xampp is not ubuntu and not supported
2008-08-11T19:20:00.000Z	wols	tobias__	/var/www/ in the default ubuntu apache install which you should use. xampp we dunno and don't care: if you have installed it you now have a borken install
