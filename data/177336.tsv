2007-10-05T07:10:00.000Z	kevinly		i'm just wondering how I should partition up my ~120gb harddrive for a winxp/ubuntu dual boot
2007-10-05T07:11:00.000Z	kevinly		ubuntu will be my primary OS but i want to skip back into xp when needed
2007-10-05T07:11:00.000Z	kevinly		for let's say 60gb of mp3s, should they be partitioned as fat32?
