2009-05-21T01:52:00.000Z	[ucb]kevin		perhaps someone can help me with the following: windows are opening in such an initial position that the title bare is hidden behind my main ubuntu "apps place system etc.." bar -- how can I fix this?
2009-05-21T01:53:00.000Z	mzz	[ucb]kevin	running compiz? iirc there's some plugin you have to enable in ccsm if that happens
2009-05-21T01:55:00.000Z	[ucb]kevin	mzz	 yes I'm running compiz
2009-05-21T01:55:00.000Z	[ucb]kevin	mzz	do you know of a setting in compiz that might have triggered this?
