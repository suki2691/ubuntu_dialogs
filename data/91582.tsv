2008-06-21T21:49:00.000Z	uwe		hello, im trying to understand how package signing works, since i had a strange problem lately, i had my apt-get update poping a warning about not being able to authenticate packages, changing the repositories helps, just for 2 days, then the warning is back again, so how does it work? do i have the public key of ubuntu maintainers when installing ubuntu ? isnt it possible that a single unauthenticated package would change that key and afterwards ill be trusted
