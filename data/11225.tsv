2012-06-04T22:17:00.000Z	dorgan1		i am trying to use wget to download a list of files from an apache directory listing I want all the files to go into one specific folder but it seems wget it creating the site hierarchy and downloading it into the appropriate folders, is there a way to just have it download the files without creating the hierarchy?
