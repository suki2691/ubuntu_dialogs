2011-01-17T14:11:00.000Z	pharvey	YeTr2	and still be able to open a text editor? (I joke... but kinda serious. 128MB left me barely enough to run abiword or a web browser)
2011-01-17T14:11:00.000Z	YeTr2	pharvey	you don't need much ram for vi
2011-01-17T14:12:00.000Z	pharvey	YeTr2	vim-lite still uses ~10MB SHR on a blank document... When I had my 128MB system, I was killing the ttys idling in the background so I could have more terminals open in X.
