2010-03-13T02:42:00.000Z	Bushido	ash30	did sudo rmmod "mod name" not work?
2010-03-13T02:42:00.000Z	Bushido	ash30	what are you trying to stop probing? that will give me an idea of the module
2010-03-13T02:43:00.000Z	Bushido	ash30	tell me the hardware, and I'll get that for you. also, what is the problem?
