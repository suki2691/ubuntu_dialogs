2006-04-04T08:01:00.000Z	frank23	Eleaf	for genesis? did you try dgen? it's in the repos. I never tried it though
2006-04-04T08:02:00.000Z	Eleaf	frank23	I tried other genesis emulators and they work fine.  I need gens's netplay ability though ;/
2006-04-04T08:02:00.000Z	frank23	Eleaf	maybe look in the forums for a post about gens
