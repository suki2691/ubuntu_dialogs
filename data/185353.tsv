2007-03-27T07:42:00.000Z	OtakuMark		I downloaded Ubuntu 6.10, burned it to a CD and attempted to install it on my parents machine. When I tell it to install (the first option), it loads for a second and then gives a Kernel Panic error, "invalid compressed format (err=2)". I've tried switching RAM, burning a second CD (at a slower speed), and changed the CD-ROM out as well, none of these methods worked. Anyone familiar with this?

2007-03-27T07:44:00.000Z	InvisiblePinkUni	OtakuMark	6.06 is much more stable in my opinion...
