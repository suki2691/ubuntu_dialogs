2010-02-06T21:22:00.000Z	actionParsnip	dirk__	you could create an alias for the long command then you can fire it when needed
2010-02-06T21:24:00.000Z	actionParsnip	dirk__	could create a script which takes a number as an arg and goes to the right folder
2010-02-06T21:27:00.000Z	actionParsnip	dirk__	short of aliases or scripts, not really
