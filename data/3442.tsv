2012-11-02T22:45:00.000Z	rsumi	wilee-nilee	i followed the instructions to boot from an iso but grub is not prompting me to select where to boot when the computer starts. it just has the computer splash screen
2012-11-02T23:00:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	rsumi	I have never booted with a ISO from grub so I can't really help there, but if you make a thread on the UF right now with booting ISO from grub problem I suspect you will get a quick answer.
