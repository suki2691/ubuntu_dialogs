2007-05-21T06:43:00.000Z	Fen_		Hey, I'm new ubuntu user so sorry for any silly questions which I may make.. Could you please tell me if it is possible to choose where to install software instead of Ubuntu just auto installing the software into my File System directory?
2007-05-21T06:43:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Fen_	not worth it
2007-05-21T06:46:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Fen_	you can mount /usr on a different partition - it's not a bad idea actually
2007-05-21T06:46:00.000Z	Frogzoo	Fen_	moving /usr after you've installed isn't really doable for beginners
