2009-03-25T23:07:00.000Z	oCean_	abe3k	see gnome-look.org for tons of customized splash screens
2009-03-25T23:08:00.000Z	oCean_	abe3k	it might be in all those splashscreens in gnome-look.org. There are many nice others
2009-03-25T23:10:00.000Z	oCean_	abe3k	there are howto's (on install) on gnome-look.org too
