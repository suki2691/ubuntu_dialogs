2007-07-09T09:04:00.000Z	khin		hi, i recently downloaded a top 250 list for 90s music. however AFAIK rythmbox will separate this and make folders for each artist (with like 1 or 2 songs in each), which is not what i want. is there any way (or any other program) that will keep them all in one folder
