2009-01-02T15:57:00.000Z	debasys		i am having a bit of trouble with GRUB while dual booting with XP. i have a space PC with 2 HDDs... one of them is primary & has XP installed in some portions. In rest empty space of the same HDD i installed Ubuntu, it does recognise XP prior to installation but after rebooting i see the XP entry on GRUB but can't boot into XP, booting into Ubuntu works fine
2009-01-02T15:57:00.000Z	debasys		so i am ready to reinstall Ubuntu.... now where should i install my GRUB?
