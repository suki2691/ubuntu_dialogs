2010-07-24T17:30:00.000Z	joakimk		After upgrading firefox, the flash player is messed up... I've tried reinstalling with "sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree" and restart FF, but no luck. Also, going to adobe.com for the install file fails, since FF can not handle the apt:// protocol. Any tips?
