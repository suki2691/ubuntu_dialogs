2009-07-24T18:44:00.000Z	bazhang	ethereality	why not let it finish then just delete
2009-07-24T18:45:00.000Z	ethereality	bazhang	less efficient, don't want to write it to disk, may not have enough space on the disk, etc. seems i'm not the only one complaining about it: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rhythmbox/+bug/223023
