2011-06-24T19:04:00.000Z	velis		hello. I was wondering if I might have a common issue: when I boot 11.04 64bit livecd, the system "freezes" right before fully rendering the "install" application window
2011-06-24T19:04:00.000Z	velis		Then the screen flashes really slowly (once per 5 seconds). There is *some* responsiveness to keyboard (pressing up/down changes the install app title, but it's negligible
2011-06-24T19:04:00.000Z	velis		Switching to 32 bit gives me even more pain and it never reaches the "install" app window. Using E8400 on P35 with ATI 5870 and 6GB RAM
