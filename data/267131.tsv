2009-09-18T17:50:00.000Z	rodders		anyone have experience with geany?  I need to setup an IDE for c++ in ubuntu and am not familiar with linux setups for g++
2009-09-18T17:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rodders	 geany is a nice little editor.     Not sure if it counts as a full IDE or not.. I never use it for that.
2009-09-18T17:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rodders	 i dont use any of them so i cant.
2009-09-18T17:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	rodders	 geany is a much lighter program then other 'ide's' i imagine its not got as many fancy features.
