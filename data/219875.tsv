2007-09-29T08:49:00.000Z	WinXPNewb		Hi, how do I initiate the md5 checksum on Linux? I tried typing the command but it says there's no such file or directory. I'm using Linux Mint btw.
2007-09-29T08:51:00.000Z	WinXPNewb		md5sum: LinuxMint-3.0-XFCE.iso: No such file or directory
2007-09-29T08:51:00.000Z	WinXPNewb		That's what I keep getting.
2007-09-29T08:51:00.000Z	Flannel	WinXPNewb	We don't support Linux Mint here.  This is an Ubuntu channel
