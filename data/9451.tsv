2011-12-01T17:31:00.000Z	pkug		Hi there, I need to create Ubuntu USB stick but I haven't any compatible OS at the moment (only NetBSD and OpenBSD), is it possible to just download an .img file and simply dd it (copy) to USB stick device ?

2011-12-01T17:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	pkug	 that only works with 11.10 - not the earlier ubuntu releases
