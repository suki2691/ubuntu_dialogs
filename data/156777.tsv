2006-11-28T15:44:00.000Z	eltese		Hi..Im fairly new to Ubuntu but not an entirely hopeless case :p But Im having serious probs regarding my NTFS partition with windows on it. Is this because Ive got Ubuntu and Windows installed on the same partition? I only have 2 partitions. One with windows and Ubuntu on it and one wich I use as a storage device... The later part is pretty crucial to get hold of as it contains several important photos videos and etc of my son :)
