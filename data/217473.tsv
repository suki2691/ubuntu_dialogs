2007-10-19T05:54:00.000Z	SpudDogg		is there some kind of "main" log file somewhere?
2007-10-19T05:54:00.000Z	MarcN	SpudDogg	See /var/log/ for a bunch of different log files.
2007-10-19T05:55:00.000Z	MarcN	SpudDogg	/var/log/messages, /var/log/syslog and /var/log/daemon.log are usefu.
2007-10-19T05:55:00.000Z	SpudDogg	MarcN	thanks
