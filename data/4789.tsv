2012-03-07T20:11:00.000Z	rbnielsen		I'm starting to give up on my googling.. Could someone please direct me to a thread (or two) about "i've-b0rked-my-ubuntu-and-I-want-to-reinstall-without-touching-the-separate-partition-my-/home-is-on", please?
2012-03-07T20:11:00.000Z	rbnielsen		Thanks in advance. :)
