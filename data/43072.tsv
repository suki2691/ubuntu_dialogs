2010-04-18T23:18:00.000Z	epaphus		Hello all. I have cloned a hard disk with the linux OS. I have made this procedure 20 times before and never had  a problem until now. The cloned copy doesnt boot instead it gives a grub prompt .  I have tried using the live cd to reinstall grub but that isnt helping much..
2010-04-18T23:18:00.000Z	epaphus		Any suggestions?
2010-04-18T23:19:00.000Z	demon_D_MAN	epaphus	does the grub prompt any errors?
