2012-03-19T10:27:00.000Z	soreau	drounse	did you disable the onboard NIC in the bios?
2012-03-19T10:28:00.000Z	drounse	soreau	no, but i havent used the onboard nic ever
2012-03-19T10:29:00.000Z	soreau	drounse	you said you had to 'switch nic pci adapter', does that mean you were using another PCI NIC card to connect?
