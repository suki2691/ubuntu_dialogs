2005-10-25T14:56:00.000Z	Cryptid		Please tell me the step by step procedure to perform a scan disk and fix badsectors on my harddisk (i am not sure if it has bad sector but i want to perform a scan).so what is the command to perform a scan disk and what are the things i need to know before doing the scan (will there be a data loss or will i have to reinstall Ubuntu again)?

2005-10-25T14:59:00.000Z	Cryptid	manuvcube	like u have scandisk and diskdefrag in Windows isnt there any such program in ubuntu
2005-10-25T14:59:00.000Z	Cryptid	manuvcube	i tried doing a scan disk by inserting my win98 cd but it dosent read the hard disk because it is in ext3 format
