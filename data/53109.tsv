2009-07-07T03:24:00.000Z	packet-sent		I have an file which I need to ensure has been copied correctly, does ubuntu perform error checking when copying files to ensure every bit is sent correctly and  then check the new location for integrity of the copied data
2009-07-07T03:26:00.000Z	OttifantSir	packet-sent	Install gtk-hash. Make a md5sum of the file before copying, then check it after it's copied. Or any other hash-check program you wish. I only know of gtk-hash that has a GUI.
2009-07-07T03:28:00.000Z	packet-sent	OttifantSir	I have used md5sum to check the file just wondered if the copy process does error checking on the file and destination nativly
2009-07-07T03:29:00.000Z	OttifantSir	packet-sent	Not to such a degree as a hash-checker. It checks the data while copying, and doesn't delete the file from the source before it's completely moved if that's what you're doing.
