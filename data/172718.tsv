2006-08-09T06:13:00.000Z	Hotwire	glen_	i think he needs to patch the kernel so it will support his mobo, and thus his hdd, but how to do this without an installed system i dont know
2006-08-09T06:13:00.000Z	glen_	Hotwire	think it may be installable on sata 1 - from just googling
2006-08-09T06:14:00.000Z	Hotwire	glen_	sounds like an easier option :)
