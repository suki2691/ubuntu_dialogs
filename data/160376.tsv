2007-06-03T10:39:00.000Z	Baalia2		I am trying to run something thru Wine, but I can't because there is a space in the name
2007-06-03T10:39:00.000Z	Baalia2		This is the command I am trying to put in "wine cortex command.exe
2007-06-03T10:39:00.000Z	Baalia2		How can I go about telling the terminal that the file I am reaching isn't cortex.exe?
