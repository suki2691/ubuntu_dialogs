2007-03-09T15:25:00.000Z	Huffalump		Is there a way to re-initialize by sound card?  Normally it works just fine, of course.  But every once in a blue moon (like now) when I boot up... there's just no sound.

2007-03-09T15:26:00.000Z	Huffalump	Jowi	let me try that.
2007-03-09T15:27:00.000Z	Huffalump	Jowi	- there were no errors during the restart, but the sound does not work
