2009-05-22T07:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	PacoBuntu	you can have Webkit instead of Gecko for Epiphany and I think Galeon as well
2009-05-22T07:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	PacoBuntu	,but otherwise you can't really have webkit I think
2009-05-22T07:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	PacoBuntu	you need a browser that has webkit as an option
