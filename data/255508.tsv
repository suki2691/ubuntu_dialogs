2011-06-03T05:04:00.000Z	euxneks	aeon-ltd	it's not worth it unless you've got like 12 GPUs running solidly.
2011-06-03T05:04:00.000Z	euxneks	aeon-ltd	even then it's questionable whether bitcoin is going to be worth it for new users
2011-06-03T05:04:00.000Z	euxneks	aeon-ltd	but yeah, go talk to people in the bitcoin channel ;)
