2010-01-05T03:44:00.000Z	r0k3tm3n	solexious	that would be a BIOS option, unless u have a eee and can overclock with a app from the software center
2010-01-05T03:46:00.000Z	solexious	r0k3tm3n	I have the cpu frequency app, but the system seems to reset to 2ghz rather than the full 3ghz on boot, then I have to set it back to full
2010-01-05T03:46:00.000Z	r0k3tm3n	solexious	i have not done any overclocking, just glad the app actually works, cant help u any more
