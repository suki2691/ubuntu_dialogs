2010-06-10T09:01:00.000Z	nico_		ok just to remind every one here is my issue quick question, how do i fix an issue i am having with my .deb file loader. when i try to install any .deb program when i click to install it the installition box to open it comes up but then disappears and never installs the program. why?
2010-06-10T09:01:00.000Z	nico_		and i was told to run dpkg -i filename.deb
2010-06-10T09:01:00.000Z	celeritas	nico_	try sudo dpkg -i *.deb, where *.deb is your package
2010-06-10T09:03:00.000Z	celeritas	nico_	are you in the correct directory in the terminal? make sure you cd'd into the directory, or use an absolute handle for the .deb
