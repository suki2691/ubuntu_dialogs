2007-02-18T07:16:00.000Z	hagabaka		can i use the "rename" command to automatically rename every "file" to "file.txt"?
2007-02-18T07:17:00.000Z	hagabaka		where file is any string
2007-02-18T07:17:00.000Z	hagabaka		i thought i could use rename 's/(.+)/\1.txt/', but it doesn't work
2007-02-18T07:18:00.000Z	mark01	hagabaka	 just write a short 5 line shell script to do it.
