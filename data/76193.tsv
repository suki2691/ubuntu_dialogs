2009-05-08T18:07:00.000Z	pepperjack	rexwin	not sure of syntax offhand.. like sshd:all maybe
2009-05-08T18:09:00.000Z	rexwin	pepperjack	it is intermittent. sometimes it allows to logmein as root with password othertimes it gets disconnected and doesnot allow me to login though the machine is alive using ping
