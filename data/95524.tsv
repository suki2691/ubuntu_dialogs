2012-10-20T20:01:00.000Z	Dulcin		Hi guys, I'm running a fully up-to-date 12.04 version of ubuntu, but when I try to do-release-upgrade it tells me there is no new version found. Am I doing something wrong or is the update not available yet?

2012-10-20T20:03:00.000Z	DJones	Dulcin	If you go to system settings, sotware sources abd rge Updates tab, there's an option to select any new version, rather than just LTS upgrades
2012-10-20T20:04:00.000Z	DJones	Dulcin	You're welcome
