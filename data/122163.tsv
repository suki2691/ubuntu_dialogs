2008-02-11T03:26:00.000Z	Chri2		I think this is the right place to ask, i've just tried installing ubuntu, and when i try to boot from Hard disk, i get an error message "GRUB Error 18" 1. Is it possible to fix? 2. If not, how do i remove GRUB?
2008-02-11T03:28:00.000Z	pine	Chri2	grub is the boot loader, u need it to boot, dont remove it
2008-02-11T03:29:00.000Z	pine	Chri2	when i have installation problems I usally try another inst cd, burn another one, form diff mirror
2008-02-11T03:29:00.000Z	pine	Chri2	And let it install grub for you
