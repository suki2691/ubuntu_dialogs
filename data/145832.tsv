2007-02-21T08:52:00.000Z	IamUnique		ive asked the same question for 3 days ina row and still no help or answer
2007-02-21T08:54:00.000Z	royel	IamUnique	it's not even that ubuntu supports or not, your asking for help with a product that is well beyond the scope of help that is provided in this channel.
2007-02-21T08:55:00.000Z	royel	IamUnique	try searching the ubuntu forums or googling, you might have more luck that way.. sorry :)
