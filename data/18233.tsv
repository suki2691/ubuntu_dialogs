2011-02-12T21:20:00.000Z	craigbass1976	BiPolah	I did.  It won't run because there are too many calls to things native to Mac or Windows, I guess.  I was all day farting around with this and talked a lot in #java.  Consensus was I'm screwed until the software company writes code correctly
2011-02-12T21:21:00.000Z	craigbass1976	BiPolah	brontoeee    If either of you know how to get the java stuff extracted from the exe install file, I could try that route
