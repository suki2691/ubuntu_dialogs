2007-06-16T11:26:00.000Z	Scunizi	demonstealer	mv ~/Desktop/filename /media/"drive partition"
2007-06-16T11:28:00.000Z	Scunizi	demonstealer	replace filename with the name of the file.. case sensitive and if there are spaces enclose the filename with " "
2007-06-16T11:29:00.000Z	demonstealer	Scunizi	so this is a code to move a specific file? why cannot i generally 'activate' it for all files?
