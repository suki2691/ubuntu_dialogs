2008-02-16T01:25:00.000Z	maximilion_	v_sec	I've heard that problem before, the guy on the forum said he liked no borders :)
2008-02-16T01:26:00.000Z	v_sec	maximilion_	haha, well it switches every other day it seems- one day i have none, the next I have fully transparent ones, but in the end i just keep reverting to metacity --replace
2008-02-16T01:27:00.000Z	maximilion_	v_sec	well, I haven't experimented that much - I use an OSX theme on metacity (and it rocks)
