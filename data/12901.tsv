2011-12-12T04:37:00.000Z	keithclark	apwbdjp	not sure how to do that exactly
2011-12-12T04:39:00.000Z	apwbdjp	keithclark	you check out mount to see the decide name and where it's mounted, then you unmount it, mkdir a new mount location into your home, and mount /dev/device new_location, (not very clear, I admit..)
