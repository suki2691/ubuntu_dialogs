2005-12-20T07:02:00.000Z	M_Cheevy		getting ready to install onto a sata raid0 array made up of a pair of seagate 80gb 7200 hds.. I've set up a 10gb partition for linux which will be used mostly for net'ing and music/video editing ... trying to decide best fs for this... should I go jfs, xfs or reiserfs? (cpu 2x2000+ amd athlons, 1gb pc2100 reg ecc, sil_3114 sata raid)
2005-12-20T07:03:00.000Z	stef65	M_Cheevy	Complex question, I'd use reiser on a soft raid-0 for performance...
2005-12-20T07:06:00.000Z	stef65	M_Cheevy	just google for it, there's lots of benchmarking and comparisons out there...
2005-12-20T07:08:00.000Z	stef65	M_Cheevy	no, u misunderstood something there.... this was just the yellow danger...
