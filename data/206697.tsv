2006-10-09T06:55:00.000Z	LstyWnch		I have another question.  Why can't I access root?  I installed and put all the passwords in.
2006-10-09T06:56:00.000Z	sethk	LstyWnch	you need to set the root password
2006-10-09T06:56:00.000Z	sethk	LstyWnch	the expert mode install prompts you for the root password, but the desktop does not.
2006-10-09T06:57:00.000Z	sethk	LstyWnch	use the full path, then it won't matter what the current directory is.
