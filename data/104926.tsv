2010-07-28T11:54:00.000Z	therealpsychx		Trying to load Ubuntu 10.04 LTS on a Gateway 4540 laptop, and no matter if I boot or install Ubuntu - it just goes to a black screen. It shows the splash screen for Ubuntu, then when it's done loading (confirmed in the text based boot) it goes to a black screen. I can not get to desktop.
