2010-05-21T07:26:00.000Z	Loshki	stealthii	maybe in windows, but last time I messed with a laptop touchpad, I was lucky to get basic functionality...
2010-05-21T07:29:00.000Z	stealthii	Loshki	might be a point.  I just want to use the button underneath the touchpad to actually click, avoiding the mouse pointer moving when i do so.
