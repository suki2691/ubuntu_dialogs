2010-07-02T21:14:00.000Z	norbi905		Hello, hope I can ask this here.  I installed Ubuntu 10.04, after which I installed VirtualBox.  For some reason, through VirtualBox when I try to install Windows 7, it keeps asking me for the drive.  I have installed this many times, and never had this problem.  I created a virtual drive for it, but for some reason it's not picking it up.  Any ideas?  Thanks for any input.
