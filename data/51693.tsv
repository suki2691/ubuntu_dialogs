2009-08-06T23:40:00.000Z	mizipzor		i want to take two images and place them side by side in a new image... which would then be twice as wide but have the same height... the images themselves are of the same size... whats the best tool to do this? i tried gimp but i simply cant wrap my head around its bloat

2009-08-06T23:43:00.000Z	innomen	mizipzor	i suppose trying to do it in notepad would be harder than gimp... maybe
