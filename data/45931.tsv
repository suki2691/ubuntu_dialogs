2010-06-29T13:05:00.000Z	diverse_izzue		hi all. i'm for the first time using ubuntu on intel graphics (with lucid). i thought the intel drivers were mature, but now i cannot connect to my external screen, it just shows "input signal out of range". the same screen on a different machine also running lucid, but with ATI graphics, worked flawlessly. what can i do?
2010-06-29T13:06:00.000Z	codebrainz	diverse_izzue	System->Preferences->Monitor and configure the monitor under there
2010-06-29T13:07:00.000Z	diverse_izzue	codebrainz	i got that far...
2010-06-29T13:07:00.000Z	diverse_izzue	codebrainz	xrandr shows the monitor with the correct resolution and refresh rate, but i get no image on the screen.
