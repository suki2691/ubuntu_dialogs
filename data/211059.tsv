2009-11-07T18:15:00.000Z	lee		I'm having trouble with the karmic netbook remix.  I have an Acer Aspire One with 9.04 netbook remix installed, which works fine, but I can't boot from a USB stick with 9.10 on; it starts booting from it, displays the white ubuntu logo for a few seconds, then the screen turns and remains black.  any advice on how to fix this? (I want to wipe and start again, not dist-upgrade)
2009-11-07T18:17:00.000Z	lee		wow, people still bother pulling crap like that on irc?  what is this, 1999?
2009-11-07T18:17:00.000Z	MenZa	lee	alas, some people think so.
2009-12-19T06:40:00.000Z	MenZa	lee	That's enough of that, thank you.
