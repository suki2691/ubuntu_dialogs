2007-01-22T06:38:00.000Z	KrisWood		What IRC client are you all using? I'm using gaim right now and it's nice enough but there are some things I can't figure out, like it doesn't flash on the taskbar when I get new messages
2007-01-22T06:39:00.000Z	KrisWood		is there a better chat client for ubuntu that also does yahoo and msn?
2007-01-22T06:39:00.000Z	alterego	KrisWood	I find gaim is the best ^_^
2007-01-22T06:43:00.000Z	alterego	KrisWood	you'd probably do better asking in the gaim channel too ..
