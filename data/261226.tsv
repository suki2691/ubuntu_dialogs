2005-03-29T16:22:00.000Z	kent	NealZheimer	it does not work for me either. the manual says "time -f" should work, but it does not. Time sees it as a program to run :(
2005-03-29T16:23:00.000Z	kent	NealZheimer	it seems that time  has a bug with arguments in Hoary. Every argument is treated as a program to run :(
2005-03-29T16:25:00.000Z	kent	NealZheimer	i added a bug about it to bugzilla.
