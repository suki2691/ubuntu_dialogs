2007-01-28T17:47:00.000Z	xtknight		i love Feisty Fawn.  im convinced i want to upgrade my stable Edgy to it even thuogh it's beta :O
2007-01-28T17:48:00.000Z	xtknight		does feisty break like every day or is it reasonably good with the updates?  im not worried about my data as i backup regularly.  only reason i want feisty on here is because it works stock (neither dapper nor edgy will properly install with my motherboard)
2007-01-28T17:49:00.000Z	ad_	xtknight	it might run, but it would still be beta, so expect crashes and bugs here and there
2007-01-28T17:49:00.000Z	xtknight	ad_	it's really no problem.  i don't think there's ever been a linux problem i couldn't fix ;P
