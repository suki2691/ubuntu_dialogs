2007-02-23T13:29:00.000Z	matty_1		hmm, that may be the problem madpilot - if it is should i copy files across then reimage it fat32?
2007-02-23T13:30:00.000Z	Madpilot	matty_1	if it's NTFS, there really isn't a reliable, totally safe way to write to NTFS from Linux. Reformatting it to fat32 might be a good idea.
