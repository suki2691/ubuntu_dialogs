2008-01-31T01:01:00.000Z	E_Data		are there any ubuntu /gnome equivalents to the KDE program "Krita"?
2008-01-31T01:02:00.000Z	E_Data		yes Jordan_U i just dont like running them because the ones that i have tried run slowly
2008-01-31T01:03:00.000Z	E_Data		its virtually impossible for me to run windows and running it virtually sounds like a lot of work so i need an ubuntu equivalent to photoshop cs3
