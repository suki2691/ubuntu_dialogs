2010-03-10T08:42:00.000Z	LasBuntu		hiya, is there any way to remotely connect to a new Ubuntu 9.10 install without having added SSH yet?
2010-03-10T08:43:00.000Z	Gnea	LasBuntu	as long as openssh-server is installed and running
2010-03-10T08:43:00.000Z	LasBuntu	Gnea	no, i'm offsite and forgot to install that :(
2010-03-10T08:43:00.000Z	Gnea	LasBuntu	then you'll need to have someone there, or wait
