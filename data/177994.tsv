2008-03-10T02:13:00.000Z	Alfarin		I just made the jump from Windows about a week ago, and I'm still learning.  I'm coming across a disc image which I was able to mount via Daemon Tools on Windows but I can't seem to mount here on Ubuntu, upon analysis, I believe it is because the iso file is > 700mb in size (larger than standard CD discs, which it is marked as, as opposed to a DVD image)
2008-03-10T02:14:00.000Z	Alfarin		Is there any known remedy to work around that limitation?
