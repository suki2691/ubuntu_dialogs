2012-10-20T00:57:00.000Z	synaesthetik		I just installed 32bit Ubuntu on my mac, but this macbook is made to run a 64bit kernel, should I install 64 bit Ubuntu instead?
2012-10-20T00:58:00.000Z	synaesthetik		also, how would I go about updating from 32 bit Ubuntu to 64?
2012-10-20T00:58:00.000Z	obscurant1st	synaesthetik	you probabaly don't want to install 64 bit ubuntu
2012-10-20T00:59:00.000Z	obscurant1st	synaesthetik	first rule says if you've got a system which is working no need to change it. And with 64 bit you won't find much difference anyway
