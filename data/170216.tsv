2009-09-10T21:10:00.000Z	oscuro		I've been reading the forums for a while trying to decide whether to get a nvidia or ati graphics card. does ati have decent acceleration support on linux nowadays? or is nvidia still king?
2009-09-10T21:11:00.000Z	Boohbah	oscuro	still nvidia. but the word is AMD is improving their drivers
2009-09-10T21:11:00.000Z	Boohbah	oscuro	AMD == ATi
2009-09-10T21:11:00.000Z	oscuro	Boohbah	thanks
