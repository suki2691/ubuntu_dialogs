2007-06-24T14:47:00.000Z	Kprofthrea1		I recently renamed my home directory, but the home icon still says "Unable to run the command specified. The file or folder file:///home/jeryx does not exist." How would I fix that?

2007-06-24T14:49:00.000Z	Kprofthrea1	Jordan_U	With mv
2007-06-24T14:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Kprofthrea1	AFIK you need to do more than that to keep the home folder associated with the user
