2006-07-04T06:11:00.000Z	KenSentMe	idefix__	what client do you use?
2006-07-04T06:17:00.000Z	KenSentMe	idefix__	i think that's going to be hard to copy, maybe someone on your uni knows a way to export the mail
2006-07-04T06:21:00.000Z	KenSentMe	idefix__	i know, but the mail that is still on the webmail is the problem i think
