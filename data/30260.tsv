2012-01-02T18:27:00.000Z	abhinav_singh1		i am using gnome right now..i want to try KDE ... is it okay to install both KDE and GNOME at same time.. my ubuntu version is 11.04
2012-01-02T18:28:00.000Z	almoxarife	abhinav_singh1	yes, you can have both, just don't break one or the other with package removals
2012-01-02T18:31:00.000Z	almoxarife	abhinav_singh1	its no slower here, and that is with gnome/kde apps going all at once
2012-01-02T18:34:00.000Z	abhinav_singh1	almoxarife	well i can still try it... i will purge either kde or gnome after that :)
