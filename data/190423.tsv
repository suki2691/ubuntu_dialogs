2006-06-04T10:33:00.000Z	scifi		i want to add a shortcut to my "Downloads" folder on my desktop, whats the easiest way to do it? (find symlinks rather complicated)
2006-06-04T10:34:00.000Z	andi5	scifi	i guess... open it with nautilus (the folder thingy), and drag it onto the desktop... does that work?
2006-06-04T10:35:00.000Z	scifi	andi5	dont think so, i use Thunar file manager (xfces)
2006-06-04T10:35:00.000Z	andi5	scifi	try #xubuntu, maybe they can help you better :) (at least i do not know)
