2009-01-23T12:57:00.000Z	rdw200169	histo	it was the dns server reported by his resolv.conf file
2009-01-23T12:58:00.000Z	histo	rdw200169	thats a weird IP.  Have him try to use 4.2.2.1  as his dns address
2009-01-23T12:58:00.000Z	rdw200169	histo	it's likely whatever the dhcp server gave him, but i think he's on the wrong subnet anyway, so renew dhcp address
