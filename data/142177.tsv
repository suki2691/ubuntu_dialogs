2007-10-27T00:58:00.000Z	PurpZeY		Hey all, I was just wondering, in terms of function and possibly opinion, if my feisty install is working, and I have compiz...given that people have had problems upgrading, is there a real reason I should attempt it/
2007-10-27T00:59:00.000Z	Op3r	PurpZeY	I upgraded from feisty to gutsy and I am using an ATI built in video card and compiz-fusion worked like a charm
2007-10-27T00:59:00.000Z	PurpZeY	Op3r	That's not my concern really...but...see right up what I just said to pj
2007-10-27T01:00:00.000Z	Op3r	PurpZeY	An updated system? :D
