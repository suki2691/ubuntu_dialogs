2006-05-19T06:31:00.000Z	high-freq	megaman123	cuz it might not be installed in /usr/bin   do a locate vdr  and see if its in /sbin or /usr/sbin  or somethin
2006-05-19T06:32:00.000Z	megaman123	high-freq	ok... and then how can i change it to the right path
2006-05-19T06:33:00.000Z	high-freq	megaman123	if your typing in console...just figure out whre the path is..and type the command  like   /usr/sbin/vdr  or whatever it is
