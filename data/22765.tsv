2010-11-13T23:59:00.000Z	jep1985	Refefer	that gest tricky, i generally just backup and reinstall
2010-11-14T00:00:00.000Z	jep1985		it will save you a lot of time and hassle
2010-11-14T00:01:00.000Z	Refefer	jep1985	yeah, I know it probably is.  just gets difficult since it's headless, not to mention the fun of reconfiguring everything.
