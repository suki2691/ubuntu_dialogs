2011-07-06T17:36:00.000Z	myrmidette		my sound card has stopped being recognized, can anyone help?
2011-07-06T17:38:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	myrmidette	stopped ? that implies that it was working, what changed in your system ?
2011-07-06T17:39:00.000Z	myrmidette	dhruvasagar	I messed with alsa/pulseaudio to enable a bt headset. I got it working, then rebooted, and now sound doesn't work at all
2011-07-06T17:41:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	myrmidette	ahhh alsa/pulseaudio has given me quite a few nightmares, but I am not sure I know it enough to help here, you should probably ask again :)
