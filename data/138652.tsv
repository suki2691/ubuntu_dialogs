2008-06-26T19:58:00.000Z	Chauncellor		My sensors don't seem to work right in Ubuntu (inspiron 8100). When my CPU temp in Ubuntu is around 45C, Windows' i8k program registers 70-75C!
2008-06-26T19:59:00.000Z	Chauncellor		any ideas?
2008-06-26T19:59:00.000Z	magnetron	Chauncellor	C or F?
2008-06-26T20:00:00.000Z	magnetron	Chauncellor	i don't get it... are you running Ubuntu and Windows at THE SAME TIME?
