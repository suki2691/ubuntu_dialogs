2007-04-21T10:27:00.000Z	ch40s		hey guys, I'm trying to install ubuntu, but when I start the boot process, it goes through everything, but, no visuals, (IE no GUI) but ctrl+alt+f2 brings up the terminal, I dunno if this is a gfx card error, I've got 2x 256 MB 7900GS's, and an AMD turion ML-40
2007-04-21T10:28:00.000Z	ch40s		any body have any ideas?
