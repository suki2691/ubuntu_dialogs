2005-08-26T05:44:00.000Z	TraceGreen		Hello, when i tried to compile c program in Debian linux, i get this error : undefined reference to `errno', can anybody help me
2005-08-26T05:45:00.000Z	TraceGreen		Actually, i try to reinstall libc6, before i do that, i can compile it sucessfully

2006-04-22T14:36:00.000Z	ompaul	TraceGreen	no, because that platform is full of lockin and the spec is not open, I do believe that some people are working on a solution, but then the length of a piece of string is similar to the depth of a hole :-)
