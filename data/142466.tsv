2007-03-26T07:12:00.000Z	catxk	Smacky_Wolf	yeah but then there's the thing with it being bought by bittorrent inc (i.e. hollywoord) which doesn't sound to appealing :)
2007-03-26T07:13:00.000Z	Smacky_Wolf	catxk	hrmf... I'm not so sure about that being a bad thing.. but I do believe the effect remains to be seen
2007-03-26T07:15:00.000Z	catxk	Smacky_Wolf	sure, I don't know, it's just something that doesn't really rhyme with the concept of  downloading movies with closed source software owned by hollywood :)
