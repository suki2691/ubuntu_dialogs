2008-12-12T10:38:00.000Z	Wyzard	phishie	No 64-bit Sun Java browser plugin exists
2008-12-12T10:39:00.000Z	Wyzard	phishie	GIJ might, but my experience with GIJ has been that it's incomplete and not really something I'd want to use (particularly since Java 7 will be GPL, and reportedly will have a 64-bit plugin)
