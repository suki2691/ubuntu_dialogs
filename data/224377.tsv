2011-02-19T00:52:00.000Z	MIH1406		Hi, which connection type is faster? HTTP or FTP?
2011-02-19T00:52:00.000Z	Chousuke	MIH1406	shouldn't matter, but I'd prefer http
2011-02-19T00:53:00.000Z	Chousuke	MIH1406	ssh should be safer at least
2011-02-19T00:54:00.000Z	Chousuke	MIH1406	and ftp won't really be any faster with modern computers.
