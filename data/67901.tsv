2009-01-22T18:11:00.000Z	ecor6633		I'd like to install a ftp server to transfer large files on local network... which one would you choose and why ?
2009-01-22T18:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ecor6633	 now a days. its proberly best to learn to use ssh and not use ftp.  but on a local network its not that big a security issue. but ssh can be so handy
2009-01-22T18:12:00.000Z	ecor6633	Dr_willis	i transfered today the files through scp and it took me more than an hour
2009-01-22T18:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis	ecor6633	 is this a linux to linux setup?
