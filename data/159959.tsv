2010-06-27T08:24:00.000Z	Saxon		Can anyone help me get DVDs to play?  I can't make them work in Totem, Kaffeine, or VLC.  I need to get DVDs to work on Ubuntu!
2010-06-27T08:24:00.000Z	cellofellow	Saxon	what exactly isn't working? Have you installed libdvdcss2 from Medibuntu?
2010-06-27T08:26:00.000Z	cellofellow	Saxon	well, then, what doesn't work?
2010-06-27T08:28:00.000Z	cellofellow	Saxon	kind of hard to diagnose that. Totem is a generally flakey DVD player. VLC always works for me, but that's works-for-me. If all else fails you can try buying the commercial DVD player from Fluendo.
