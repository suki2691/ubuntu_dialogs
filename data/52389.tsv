2012-05-28T23:29:00.000Z	garlic		ok I'm about to install windows 7, I'v alread got ubuntu 12.04 installed on my drive
2012-05-28T23:30:00.000Z	garlic		I'm wondering if I should install windows at the beginning of my drive partition or after ubuntu
2012-05-28T23:31:00.000Z	garlic		basically does it matter where I install windows7
2012-05-28T23:32:00.000Z	kunji	garlic	which partition before or after isn't terribly important, which order (time) you install in can make it easier or harder (may need to reinstall grub if you install windows after ubuntu)
