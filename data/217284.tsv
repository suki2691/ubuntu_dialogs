2009-03-19T17:37:00.000Z	burg		hello. i have asus x50gl notebook, with nvidia 8200 chipset. everytime i try to install ubuntu 8.10, it crashes (tryed with 2 different cds plus one ordered cd with ubuntu) - how can i install it?
2009-03-19T17:39:00.000Z	burg		i get a black screen with a message all over the screen (not like big letters, but written on every line)
2009-03-19T17:39:00.000Z	burg		i can`t remember the message. anyway as i remember is a known problem with my chipset and i was wondering if there is any fix for it or something
