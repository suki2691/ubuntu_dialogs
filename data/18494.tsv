2011-02-04T07:00:00.000Z	EmuAlert		How do I set a key back to doing all its normal stuff? I messed up Alt_L with xmodmap so now it still counts as mod1 but doesn't do anything on its own

2011-02-04T07:02:00.000Z	Marotte	EmuAlert	so how do you think we can figure it ?
2011-02-04T07:03:00.000Z	Marotte	EmuAlert	maybe, hope someone else would help...
