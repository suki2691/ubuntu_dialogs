2007-07-22T09:13:00.000Z	limetang		I can't get my joystick working on Ubuntu 7.04. $ cat /proc/asound/card0/audiopci outputs "... Joystick enable  : on ..." and I've loaded analog and joydev, but jscalibrator says that it cannot access /dev/input/js0 (it does exist). I've tried two different joysticks and neither worked, any ideas?
