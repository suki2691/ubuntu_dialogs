2006-03-30T12:51:00.000Z	sethrd	tonyyarusso	You have the rest but want a server install?
2006-03-30T12:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	sethrd	Nabiki: Well, not quite.  I want to add them.  b/c the server install would have things like lamp, etc., whatever would be common tools for that kind of thing; I'd like to have the option of both purposes.
