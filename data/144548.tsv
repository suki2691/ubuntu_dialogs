2008-05-03T11:25:00.000Z	crdlb	cognatus	you can use i386 or amd64
2008-05-03T11:27:00.000Z	crdlb	cognatus	it's marginally faster unless you're doing lots of floating point calculations (in which case, ti's much faster)
2008-05-03T11:27:00.000Z	crdlb	cognatus	and you have to deal with slightly less compatibility (there's still no 64bit flash, but there are workarounds)
