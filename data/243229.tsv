2005-04-13T16:16:00.000Z	fragfutter		i have trouble compiling a custom kernel. it fails after uncompressing the kernel and mounting the root-fs. "VFS: unable.... unknown-block(0,0)" i have no idea what i missed to compile into the kernel. Or is there anything special for ubuntu?

2005-04-13T16:20:00.000Z	fragfutter	roo_	i don't want to use the kernel package building of debian/ubuntu and no initrd.
