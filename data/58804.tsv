2009-05-11T23:50:00.000Z	lexr	justin__	goto edit?preferences and then check all mixers, and then, goto recording, and unmute the mic if it is muted.
2009-05-11T23:52:00.000Z	lexr	justin__	on my sound card, I have capture, capture1 etc, and i had to unmute microphone tobe able to use it. It is on the second tab. have you checked all the checkboxes in the prefs?
