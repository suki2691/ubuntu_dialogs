2011-07-19T20:53:00.000Z	alazare619	nicofs	setup samba share?
2011-07-19T20:53:00.000Z	alazare619	nicofs	 with like gadmin samba
2011-07-19T20:56:00.000Z	nicofs	alazare619	i used nautilus to set up that sharing thing via right-clicking on the folder... and when i go to system > preferences  > Personal file sharing, I get "...required packages are not installed..."
