2007-11-19T07:38:00.000Z	Jangari	T1m0thy	do you mean inside a page while browsing? is it coming up as minimal html?
2007-11-19T07:39:00.000Z	T1m0thy	Jangari	Well, it was just on certain black text, it would be white. It's fixed now though.. just certain themes work and certain others don't.
2007-11-19T07:45:00.000Z	T1m0thy	Jangari	Nope.. :/
