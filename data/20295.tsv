2011-02-09T17:56:00.000Z	knxville		Im trying to add a font on a ubuntu server to be picked up by my style.css in drupal for a headline on a webpage, but it does not find it..
2011-02-09T17:56:00.000Z	knxville		Is there somewhere to see what fonts ive got installed
2011-02-09T17:58:00.000Z	bc81	knxville	what i do is make a folder ~/.fonts and drop them in there, your mileage may vary
2011-02-09T17:58:00.000Z	knxville	bc81	my fc-cache finds them in /usr/share/fonts/truetype/
