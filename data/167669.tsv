2006-09-16T14:03:00.000Z	minerale		Hi, I have a windows installation on my first hard drive, after some recent updates the item has gone and grub does not show it anymore? can anyone help ?
2006-09-16T14:03:00.000Z	minerale		I do not know what to put on my menu.lst file
2006-09-16T14:03:00.000Z	THX-1138	minerale	- Yes, by editing /boot/grub/menu.lst file.
2006-09-16T14:08:00.000Z	THX-1138	minerale	- editing /boot/grub/menu.lst should bring it back.
