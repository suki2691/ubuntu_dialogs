2009-10-15T01:41:00.000Z	bivo		How can I load into Ubuntu after installing it in vista via wubi?
2009-10-15T01:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bivo	reboot, it will be an option to boot vista or ubuntu
2009-10-15T01:44:00.000Z	bivo	joebodo	ActionParsnip I don't see any grub menu at boot, and while ubuntu shows up in add and remove progams it doesn't have anything in the start menu or desktop, is there a way to force a longer wait till boot default in wubi?
2009-10-15T01:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bivo	not sure, i dislike wubi so am not sure how it works with the system, maybe someone else can advise
