2007-01-18T15:21:00.000Z	riotkittie	darrell	are you booting with a vga option in the kernel line? i have heard taht screws things up in X but am not sure. uhm when you reconfig'd x, did you do the simple monitor detection or opt for one of the more advanced modes? and have you deselected some of the lower resolutions ?
