2007-07-19T09:05:00.000Z	shooters		Hi, I'm trying to convert a .flv video to .mpg using mencoder, but I always get a Buffer Overflow error, is there a way I can dump the video to a file and then encode it?
2007-07-19T09:06:00.000Z	zepolen	shooters	why do you want to convert an flv
2007-07-19T09:06:00.000Z	zepolen		mplayer plays them just fine
2007-07-19T09:06:00.000Z	shooters	zepolen	I can't play them in VLC, and can't move them forward in mplayer...
