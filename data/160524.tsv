2007-07-26T13:43:00.000Z	PWill		NautilNautilus turned into a zombie process, and I can't kill it, even with kill -9. I don't want to restart my computer because I can't start Nautilus. Help.

2007-07-26T13:45:00.000Z	PWill	Jordan_U	no, i was using firefox, downloading stuff, and when i minimized the firefox window to see the desktop, nautilus wasn't there
