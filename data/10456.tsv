2011-08-14T02:46:00.000Z	acolin	lazarus_	I'll repeat my question, then: Hi, simple question re modprobe.conf: path[TAG] = A_PATH directive: what is a 'tag'? How do I know which tag corresponds to which  modules? Also, is there a way to specify a path directive per module (as opposed to per tag), ie. path[mymodule] = MYPATH? Thank you in advance.
