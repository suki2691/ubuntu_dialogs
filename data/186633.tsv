2009-05-06T02:41:00.000Z	boringpackets		this is probably an obvious question but I cant seem to find the answer. How do I enable four desktops instead of two?
2009-05-06T02:42:00.000Z	ikonia	boringpackets	are you using compiz (the cube)
2009-05-06T02:42:00.000Z	ikonia	boringpackets	ok - so you need to set it in the cube settings in ccsm
2009-05-06T02:46:00.000Z	ikonia	boringpackets	don't be smart, he's asking for help
