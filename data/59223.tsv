2009-11-26T04:42:00.000Z	linux		My flash player keeps stopping for 2 seconds and going again. I have Ubuntu 9.10 32bit and I installed ubuntu restricted to get flash to work. What the hell do I do now

2009-11-26T04:44:00.000Z	VCoolio	linux	don't know, wouldn't do that unless you have sound issues
2009-11-26T04:45:00.000Z	VCoolio	linux	the extrasound one is for if you use esound or oss
