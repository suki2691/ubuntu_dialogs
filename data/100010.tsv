2008-11-07T03:52:00.000Z	edd		hi, is there a CLI command to roll back any updates/upgrades I made recently?
2008-11-07T03:52:00.000Z	n8tuser	edd	nope, none
2008-11-07T03:52:00.000Z	n8tuser	edd	your recourse is to re-install fresh the older version
2008-11-07T03:56:00.000Z	edd	n8tuser	thanks, i was afraid of that... np though, think I've found my problem
