2010-02-13T08:50:00.000Z	Tohsh		Can anyone assist me in assigning a specific user a failover IP on my server?
2010-02-13T08:51:00.000Z	Tohsh		my server has 1 main IP and 3 failovers. I want to assign a failover IP to say user, pirate, through iptables.
2010-02-13T08:51:00.000Z	Tohsh		so all his traffic goes through that IP
