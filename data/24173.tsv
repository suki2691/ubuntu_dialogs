2010-12-30T09:13:00.000Z	KM0201	sync3times	i dunno, seem sstrnage to me.. a router assigns IP addresses... a PC doesn't tell the router what it wants... at least in my experience
2010-12-30T09:16:00.000Z	sync3times	KM0201	 the router dhcp server is a service and is optional.   You can turn it off.    The router just passes packets.   Thats it.   I will admit that letting the router do it can be better in the case where the router does not provide dns forwarding.   and laptops almost always want to stay dhcp
