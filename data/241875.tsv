2008-05-31T21:18:00.000Z	Rishie		I'm new to Ubuntu. This is my first time trying to install, however, i cannot seem to get past step 1. The wizard requests my language pref, and thereafter it remains on that step for a long, long time. I left it overnight, and when i returned it seemed to have crashed
2008-05-31T21:20:00.000Z	Rishie		Are there any experts here that i can communicate directly with?
2008-05-31T21:20:00.000Z	Rishie		By pm or something?
