My problem is that when returning from Suspend, my computer will become so slow it is thoroughly unusable. Using the gnome system monitor panel applet, I can see that IOWait is maxing when this happens; however my processor is not. What is the cause of this? Is

2010-11-02T07:04:00.000Z	avo	ActionParsnip	Perhaps I should have left that out. This problem has occurred on all versions of ubuntu, will a whole range of FGLRX drivers. On Maverick with it's out-of-the-box proprietary ATI driver, on Lucid with its', and with all of the ATI drivers in between. Mixing of packages, I can assure you, is not the cause.
