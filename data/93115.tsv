2008-04-27T16:42:00.000Z	mumu		how can i run the executable file i compiled with eclipse? I tried .test11 (the name of file) but i get "bash: .test11: command not found".
2008-04-27T16:42:00.000Z	JapyDooge	mumu	try ./test11 in the folder of it
2008-04-27T16:43:00.000Z	JapyDooge	mumu	if not working do a chmod +x test11 on it first
