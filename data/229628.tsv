2007-04-20T06:35:00.000Z	AnObfuscator		I got disconnected, before I got a response to this question ... Ubuntu really doesn't want to install on this computer... after trying 2 burns of the alt CD, I'm using the Live CD. It boots into gnome, then says "resource fork unavailable" when I try to use any menu items... when I hit alt-F1 for a console and try to type bash commands, it gives the same error... what gives?
2007-04-20T06:35:00.000Z	AnObfuscator		I did verify it
2007-04-20T06:36:00.000Z	bimberi	AnObfuscator	kk, did you try the verify in the boot menu as well?
2007-04-20T06:37:00.000Z	bimberi	AnObfuscator	hmmk starting to sound like a bug :|
