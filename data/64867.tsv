2009-05-28T21:40:00.000Z	CooPs		Hello, I'm using the S-Video out port on my nvidia FX5200 with propitary drivers. Connected to my TV. The image is black and white.
2009-05-28T21:41:00.000Z	CooPs		I suspect this is becouse it outputs NTCS and the TV is PAL. But I can't find anywhere where I can change this........

2009-05-28T21:44:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	CooPs	PAL/NTSC can be set in Xorg.conf - see http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/suse-linux-help/43764-nvidia-tv-out-config.html for an example.  Good luck.
