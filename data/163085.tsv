2006-10-24T09:08:00.000Z	JuJuBee		I need major help.  I am trying to get my laptop to mirror to a projector.  I installed the ATI linux driver.  Now the only resolution I get is 640x480.  How do I get back to my old config without reinstalling?
2006-10-24T09:09:00.000Z	cherubiel_	JuJuBee	do you have the xorg.conf backup?
2006-10-24T09:09:00.000Z	cherubiel_	JuJuBee	got a live cd?
2006-10-24T09:10:00.000Z	cherubiel_	JuJuBee	load the live cd, see if you are getting the desired resolution; if yes, use the xorg.conf from the live cd
