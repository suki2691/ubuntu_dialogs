2012-01-17T23:46:00.000Z	Lili^	Zizzu	do you have some options to suggest to restrict the output (i'll read the man anyway)? geirha tnx, il'll give it a try
2012-01-17T23:47:00.000Z	geirha	Lili^	Hehe, lsof is possibly one of the most complex commands I know. I avoid it if I can. Usually fuser suffices in its place. iotop is like the top command, just it shows how much disk io processes uses, instead of cpu and mem.
