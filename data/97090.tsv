2008-03-19T07:36:00.000Z	tems		Hey guys - I have determined that under windows my display driver is an "Intel(R) 965 Express Chipset Family" and it appears that is not one of the types on the xserver-xorg configuration
2008-03-19T07:36:00.000Z	tems		Any ideas on how to remedy that?  Some guy on the web had some joy typing :sudo apt-get install 915resolution xserver-xorg-video-intel.  didn't work for me though as it said no such package.  is there a way to put the driver on a cd maybe and transfer it over?
