2007-03-19T12:52:00.000Z	AlexC_	LightCatcher	yep, in terminal type "sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop"
2007-03-19T12:52:00.000Z	AlexC_	LightCatcher	then when you go to the login screen, if you go to Options -> Session you can choose from KDE or Gnome
2007-03-19T12:53:00.000Z	AlexC_	LightCatcher	you're welcome,
