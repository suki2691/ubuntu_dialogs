2010-10-17T03:10:00.000Z	antIP	magicianlord	- rockets - Sorry guys, I did do a clean install. I always do clean installs. I've never done a upgrade for the same reasons you guys don't. However, I did make the mistake (it appears) of coping over some compiz files hoping that I would keep my old settings. That's the only thing I copied from my old home directory.
