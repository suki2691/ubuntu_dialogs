2010-04-29T14:08:00.000Z	brakkvatn		Hey. I have an odd problem. I installed Ubuntu Netbook Remix on my netbook. I then installed xubuntu-desktop to get xfce. But when I log in to xfce I still get the desktop menu thing that gnome has
2010-04-29T14:09:00.000Z	brakkvatn		I want to get rid of that desktop menu
2010-04-29T14:10:00.000Z	ubutom	brakkvatn	dunno if thats the right thing to do, but you can try uninstalling gnome-desktop, might also remove all gnome-related stuff
2010-04-29T14:13:00.000Z	brakkvatn	ubutom	I think I'll not do that. Want to keep some of the programs. But I figured it out. I entered the xcfe settings editor and removed the netbook menu from the start-up apps.
