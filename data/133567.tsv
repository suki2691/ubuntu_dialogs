2007-09-12T11:02:00.000Z	Gizmo_the_Great		FUSE is an application BTW
2007-09-12T11:03:00.000Z	faileas	Gizmo_the_Great	probably the _devel filed for fuse
2007-09-12T11:07:00.000Z	Gizmo_the_Great	faileas	 I am trying to runn AFFUSE which is a slightly adjusted version of AFUSE for the Advanced Forensic Format util (www.afflib.org) but whenever I do it says "affuse: FUSE support is disabled."
