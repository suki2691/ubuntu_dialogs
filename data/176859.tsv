2012-06-13T15:24:00.000Z	kulhas		hello, I use last ubuntu with unity and there is something that I dont like it, what annoys me most is that open app's and closed app's are all togetherâ€¦ is there any solution to this ? (btw I am thinking to install another desktop manager, but first I would like to give unity a oportunity)
2012-06-13T15:24:00.000Z	fidel	kulhas	could you try to rephrase your issue?
2012-06-13T15:25:00.000Z	fidel	kulhas	looking for some kind of dock which only shows open apps or whats your target?
2012-06-13T15:28:00.000Z	fidel	kulhas	i would just replace the unity-dock/sidebar with something else (like awn/docky/tint2 or similar) - but i dont use unity either
