2007-12-02T05:41:00.000Z	blackvd		Hi, I'm running VirtualBox w/ XP and every time before I can boot XP I have to change permissions to /dev/vboxdrv by running sudo nautilus in terminal then locating the file and change the permissions every time after reboot? is there an easier way to permanently change permission to files?
2007-12-02T05:42:00.000Z	riotkittie	blackvd	did you add yourself to the virtualbox/vbox/whatever group?
2007-12-02T05:44:00.000Z	riotkittie	blackvd	go to users/groups under System > Admin
2007-12-02T05:45:00.000Z	riotkittie	blackvd	then Manage Groups. make sure you're in vboxusers group.
