2008-12-05T23:50:00.000Z	xenoterracide_		are there current packages for azureus and tomcat for 8.04 anywhere?
2008-12-05T23:51:00.000Z	CaShMoNey	xenoterracide_	I wouldn't recomment azureus
2008-12-05T23:51:00.000Z	CaShMoNey	xenoterracide_	try Transmission :)
2008-12-05T23:51:00.000Z	xenoterracide_	CaShMoNey	I like azureus/vuze. but that still doesn't answer my question
