2009-12-09T04:49:00.000Z	coz_	lowlycoder	 hold on I think I have a link for that
2009-12-09T04:51:00.000Z	coz_	lowlycoder	 i cant find the link right now but if you google  chromium on ubuntu you probably will get a few hits...however  some are old  what you probably want is  the source or daily build of chromium  from google   who may also have a deb pacakge already up on their site
