2010-03-20T07:18:00.000Z	Slor		hey folks.  I was wondering - is it reliable to do a distro upgrade from 9.04 to 9.10? on a 32-bit laptop, if that matters
2010-03-20T07:19:00.000Z	blakkheim	Slor	i'd do a fresh install
2010-03-20T07:23:00.000Z	Slor	blakkheim	- thanks.  is 9.10 known to be any more or less performant than 9.04?  not sure I _need_ 9.10 for anything specific, but I thought I would upgrade if there's not a good reason not too.
2010-03-20T07:23:00.000Z	blakkheim	Slor	if you want my opinion, i'd stay with 9.04 and do a fresh install next month with 10.04
