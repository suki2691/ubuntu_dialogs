2012-10-11T22:07:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r		Hi all! Can I safely "sudo-apt-get remove xubuntu-desktop" if I have installed another and wish to remove xfce? Will it break anything other than default installed programs?

2012-10-11T22:10:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	jrib	im happy to leave it but I have duplicates in my menus now and XFCE is default choice on login screen too. I'd like to remove the dups and have MATE as default choice. The only way I know to make that happen is remove XFCE
