2011-12-22T22:39:00.000Z	motafoca	edbian	i know this might be stupid, but im not sure how to proceed. I have a device with a touchscreen, that on LiveCD Works perfect, but when i install ubuntu, the same stops working, ive googled for answers and nothing, triend making a /etc/X11/xorg.conf file and nothing. How can i copy the X configuration for the touch to work after install?? Thanks!
