2005-02-12T15:12:00.000Z	randabis-laptop	Milda	what about totem?
2005-02-12T15:15:00.000Z	Milda	randabis-laptop	thx, i didn't know about totem, but it can't play it ("don't know how to handle video/x-divx... audio/mpeg...")
2005-02-12T15:15:00.000Z	randabis-laptop	Milda	probably because it's using totem-gstreamer and doesn't have w32codecs
