2008-01-08T05:32:00.000Z	markd	carl	Yeah, I am not aware of a way to get the files without it running some sort of server (ftp , ssh ...etc).  And all of things are not enabled by default (or installed if I remember correctly) in Ubuntu desktop.

2008-01-08T05:37:00.000Z	markd	carl	sorry I couldn't help you out more...
