2007-10-21T12:53:00.000Z	ExRarne		Ugh... I decreased the size of the XP partiton, installed Ubuntu and everything was going fine, I installed a few programs etc... I login today and Ubuntu isn't accepting my password. I boot into windows, it's going crazy, explorer isn't working, the screen is frozen (except for mIRC which I was able to boot up via TaskMan)... What the fuck is going on?
2007-10-21T12:54:00.000Z	ExRarne		Would the best solution would be going to GpartED via the liveCD and restore the original size of XP?
2007-10-21T12:55:00.000Z	ExRarne		I'm chkdsk'ing the system
