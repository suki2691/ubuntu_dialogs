I've tried using Emerald, and have also added window manager (gnome-wm) to my startup, and still it hides itself on me... 'metacity --replace' will make it reappear but it usually disappears soon there after... any suggestions?

2010-07-31T22:41:00.000Z	xangua	roboto3785	ten better remove that window applet you use, open compiz settings and go to the window decoration plugin
2010-07-31T22:42:00.000Z	xangua	roboto3785	and just restart your session, that should work
