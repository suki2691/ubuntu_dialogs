This is the third time ive been here and just flat out ignored on a bug that pretty much just cripples mine and MANY peoples wireless networking. The bug forum has not even made it critical after 6 months since this was reported and MANY people have this problem. No one like being flat out ognored and granted its prolly not even a ubuntu bug, most likely intel but not all
2009-09-04T22:26:00.000Z	nel		of us are linux experts and being ignored in here is just rude too

2009-09-04T22:30:00.000Z	JonJ	nel	Sure, I understand you perfectly, I've had bugs ignored for a long time in alot of distros, Ubuntu included. I'm just saying that maybe none of us knows how to fix, so complaining that everyone in this channel doesn't answer you with "I don't know" might not help your case here :)
