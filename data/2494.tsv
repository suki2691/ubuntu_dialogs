2012-06-13T12:58:00.000Z	sneakza		I'm using pressed  with an installation, it seems the whole install goes well until i try boot the new system, where i end up with a grub error which says out of disk, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1038693/ id my preseed config and the install log which says grub install successfulâ€¦ any ideas
