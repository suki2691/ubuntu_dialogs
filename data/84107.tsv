2010-09-09T10:32:00.000Z	Tim_		Looking for help trying to get an install of 64-bit Ubuntu 10.04 installed.
2010-09-09T10:32:00.000Z	Tim_		I was running 32-bit, but it only booted about half the time, so I tried re-installing with 64-bit.
2010-09-09T10:34:00.000Z	Emanon	Tim_	if you use the desktop it should be the same as installing 32 bit
2010-09-09T10:36:00.000Z	Tim_	Emanon	Yeah, USB 2.0 x2 and USB 3.0 x1. No I'm installing from a CD. I'm just suspecting the USB3 port.
