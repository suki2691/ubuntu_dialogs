2010-03-28T12:08:00.000Z	MaxHR		Hello, anybody using the Mint version of ubuntu, does it contain dialup modem gui?  if not, any similar versions of ubuntu that does?
2010-03-28T12:09:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	MaxHR	Mint is not a version of Ubuntu - it is it's own Derivative version (that BTW is not supported here)
2010-03-28T12:11:00.000Z	MaxHR	ZykoticK9	does regular ubuntu installer have dialup gui?
2010-03-28T12:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	MaxHR	i have no idea - I haven't used dial-up in YEARS (never in linux actually)
