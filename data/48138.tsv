2012-06-08T01:54:00.000Z	OerHeks	jarubyh	i assume a typo
2012-06-08T01:55:00.000Z	OerHeks	jarubyh	no need for the old way with ndiswrapper, bcm43 is supported
2012-06-08T01:58:00.000Z	OerHeks	jarubyh	i think you need is this part >>" sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter firmware-b43-installer " and reboot after install.
