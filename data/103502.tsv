2008-04-07T18:02:00.000Z	chrislees		Hi. I just built a computer with 1 gig of RAM, but the BIOS and Ubuntu report only 883 megabytes. Does anyone know what might have gone wrong?
2008-04-07T18:04:00.000Z	Pici	chrislees	do you have a onboard video card? it could be sharing your system memory.

2008-04-07T18:04:00.000Z	chrislees	Pici	and Adantan_Alex: Thanks for your help
