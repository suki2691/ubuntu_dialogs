2007-12-23T09:53:00.000Z	Flannel	Spudster	What about 5.2.5 are you interested in?
2007-12-23T09:53:00.000Z	Spudster		I wanted to avoid some security risks that Nessus identified in 5.2.3 that comes with Ubuntu
2007-12-23T09:54:00.000Z	Flannel	Spudster	stock 5.2.3 doesn't come with ubuntu,its been patched (for security) and such.  Six or so times to be exact, you can see here: http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/main/p/php5/php5_5.2.3-1ubuntu6.2/changelog
2007-12-23T09:55:00.000Z	Spudster	Flannel	Thanks, I'll check it out
