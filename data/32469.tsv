2010-05-05T17:29:00.000Z	SandGorgon		is there a upstart service manager that lets me choose services (like mysql.etc.) that should be started/not-started on boot ?
2010-05-05T17:29:00.000Z	BobMarley	SandGorgon	No, unfortunately not

2010-05-05T17:31:00.000Z	SandGorgon	BobMarley	what I meant was that _earlier_ I used sysv-rc-conf
