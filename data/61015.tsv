2009-04-16T08:14:00.000Z	ULFfuntu	nikin	i'm pretty sure there aren't any passive 5700s :)
2009-04-16T08:15:00.000Z	nikin	ULFfuntu	i was thinking the same of the 6600GT line.. til i have come across one.... :D
2009-04-16T08:16:00.000Z	nikin	ULFfuntu	but anyhow i stil think that even those are overkill for the mensioned configuarion
