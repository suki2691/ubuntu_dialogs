2005-06-10T09:44:00.000Z	_Simon_		ok so I did an apt-get on automake and somehow I have both automake 1.4 and 1.9, I need 1.9, why didn't apt-get just upgrade it?
2005-06-10T09:45:00.000Z	_Simon_		when I do automake --version I get 1.4, not 1.9
2005-06-10T09:45:00.000Z	_Simon_		so how do I fix this?
2005-06-10T09:45:00.000Z	benplaut	_Simon_	different filenames, i suppose... or one might depend on the other
