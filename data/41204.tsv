2009-12-11T04:03:00.000Z	Arimoto		I just did a fresh 9.10 install and when I try to install ncurses-devel I get "
2009-12-11T04:04:00.000Z	Arimoto		... I get "Couldn't find package: ncurses-devel"
2009-12-11T04:05:00.000Z	losha	Arimoto	ncurses-dev, not -devel...
2009-12-11T04:06:00.000Z	Arimoto	losha	thanks and actually I just noticed the error message tells says I need to install "ncurses-devel" ... but it should be ncurses-dev.  I'm installing it now.  :-)
