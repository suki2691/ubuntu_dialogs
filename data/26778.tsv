2011-12-14T01:51:00.000Z	kyan		Hello. I plugged my external hard drive into a Mac. It was FAT32 formatted. After working with it and then remounting it, it was empty (instead of containing the data it should have). I'm not normally a Mac user. How can I fix this????

2011-12-14T01:52:00.000Z	kyan	llutz	no. All gone.
