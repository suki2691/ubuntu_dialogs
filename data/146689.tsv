2007-02-11T11:56:00.000Z	mytruehero	yommb	Using xbindkeys, what should I bind alt+caps lock to in order to get the functionality I'm after?
2007-02-11T11:57:00.000Z	yommb	mytruehero	: xbindkeys converts keystrokes & key-combinations to terminal commands ; if you find out the ( wm ) command for switching workspaces , then you should be there , no ?
2007-02-11T11:58:00.000Z	mytruehero	yommb	Alright, I'll do some searching. Thanks!
