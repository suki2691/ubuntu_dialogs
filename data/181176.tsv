2007-03-12T05:38:00.000Z	bruenig	aos	for wine at least, assuming you installed it via repos, sudo apt-get install wine
2007-03-12T05:38:00.000Z	bruenig	aos	I meant sudo apt-get remove wine
2007-03-12T05:49:00.000Z	bruenig	aos	that remark you are making about added a repository ... is extremely confusing
