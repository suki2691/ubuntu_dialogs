2006-10-15T05:52:00.000Z	quantik		I have a problem: i must recompile a kernel with gcc 2.95, but in the packages repositories, it only exists in i386, but I have an Athlon64, and the amd64 version of ubuntu installed. What can I do?
2006-10-15T05:53:00.000Z	Shadowpillar_	quantik	if you're new to linux, I suggest sitting back a few more releases before making use of 64 bit
2006-10-15T05:53:00.000Z	Shadowpillar_	quantik	otherwise, try downloading the i386 version manually and installing it with dpkg -i
2006-10-15T05:53:00.000Z	Shadowpillar_	quantik	and pray
