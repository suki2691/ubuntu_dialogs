2007-03-23T08:21:00.000Z	Slart	matt3243	i wouldn't count on it.. ntfs is not a linux favourite.. you can read/write with it.. but I've never seen anything that can fix it
2007-03-23T08:22:00.000Z	matt3243	Slart	i've got a friend that has a XP system thats wacked out, tryin to fix it for him
2007-03-23T08:23:00.000Z	Slart	matt3243	there are some live cd's that can repair ntfs disks.. perhaps a google for "repair cd" will give you something useful?
