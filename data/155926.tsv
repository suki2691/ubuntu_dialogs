2006-12-05T17:05:00.000Z	Tachoh		try her one more time: my mic capture is turned on, mic boost is on, the mic is selected for recording, if i turn up the volume on the mic i can hear myself talk, i have the right permissions to access the sound devices, the correct modules are loaded, tried with mic 1 and mic2 in alsamixer, and the recording volume is turned up in audacity. audacity is pointing to /dev/dsp as the recording device. any idea why i get a blank line when trying to record sou
