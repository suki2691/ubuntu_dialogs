2005-10-24T07:30:00.000Z	sproingie	YukiIkyuta	nope.  english is a germanic language, that's why it sounds similar.  it just imported a lot from french along the way
2005-10-24T07:31:00.000Z	sproingie	YukiIkyuta	but it's why we put adjectives before the nouns instead of after
2005-10-24T07:31:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta	sproingie	aah.. that would do it.
