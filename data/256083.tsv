2012-01-29T15:10:00.000Z	SteM		hi all, i'0m trying to update 11.04 to 11.10 by CD but it doesn't make me select 'upgrate 11.04 to 11.10'. Why ?
2012-01-29T15:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	SteM	 yo have the desktop cd? or the alt-installer cd?
2012-01-29T15:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	SteM	 the desktop cd does not support that feature as far as i know. Only the alt-cd does
2012-01-29T15:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	SteM	 it does not function as a repository for updateing.. correct.  Unless theres been changes to it.
