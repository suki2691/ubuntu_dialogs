2011-10-12T07:54:00.000Z	DouglasK		when I try to do a showmount <server IP>, I get "clnt_create: RPC: Program not registered".  I have reinstalled nfs-common, portmap and nfs-kernel-server
2011-10-12T07:56:00.000Z	DouglasK		Or, is there a better channel to ask about nfs mount issues in?
2011-10-12T07:57:00.000Z	Lithos84	DouglasK	Have you tried #nfs ?
2011-10-12T07:57:00.000Z	DouglasK	Lithos84	no ... but I will now, thanks or the thought.
