2005-09-18T08:56:00.000Z	bob2	markuma1	it was installable an hour ago
2005-09-18T08:57:00.000Z	markuma1	bob2	i have ubuntu breezy installed without gnome because of lineakd. so i installed only xfce. but there it is impossible to install firefox
2005-09-18T08:58:00.000Z	bob2	markuma1	"impossible"?  /etc/apt/sources.list and error from apt to #flood
