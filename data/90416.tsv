2008-10-29T05:42:00.000Z	mattgyver83		Im trying to help a coworker dual boot ubuntu.  His laptop uses an external USB cdrom drive, it will not boot the cd on boot, we changed the boot order to make sure that usb was enabled however still wont read, any ideas?
2008-10-29T05:44:00.000Z	favro	mattgyver83	does the cd drive boot with any other cd?
