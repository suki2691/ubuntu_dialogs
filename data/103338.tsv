2011-05-20T17:59:00.000Z	hobotroid		Hi, I recently switched to gnome 3 from unity (much better, wow), but none of the links in the top menu work... the menus themselves work, but when i go to System Settings, My Account, Network Settings, or even Data and Time Settings, nothing happens. I can launch these things from a terminal, but from the menu they're broken for some reason. Are there logs somewhere so i can see what's going on?

2011-05-20T18:00:00.000Z	bazhang	hobotroid	contact the PPA maintainer
