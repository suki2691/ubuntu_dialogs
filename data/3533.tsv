2012-08-22T06:31:00.000Z	klync		so there's a new one: firefox crashed, and now whenever i launch it it crashes on the recovery screen. clearly reading *something* corrupted in ~/
2012-08-22T06:32:00.000Z	jagginess	klync	startup firefox in safemode, maybe its a plugin
2012-08-22T06:32:00.000Z	klync	jagginess	crash happened when i was wheel-scrolling a text howto, but i'll try that
2012-08-22T06:37:00.000Z	klync	jagginess	well, it was one of the several plugins i disabled. thanks. time to add back one by one...
