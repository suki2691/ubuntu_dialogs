2010-02-24T21:08:00.000Z	wad		Hi guys. My system wants to update itself, but it warning me that there are a bunch of NOT AUTHENTICATED packages. Should I fret?
2010-02-24T21:08:00.000Z	Nitsuga	wad	reload the package list and the problem will be solved
2010-02-24T21:11:00.000Z	wad	Nitsuga	thanks! Am just doing it with the command line, as I didn't see a way to do that in the GUI thingie.
2010-02-24T21:12:00.000Z	Nitsuga	wad	you can do it in GUI via the Update manager
