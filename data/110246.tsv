2009-07-20T23:14:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	darkblue_B	did you put the key in an authorized_key file?
2009-07-20T23:15:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	darkblue_B	and he comes as user "guest" ?
2009-07-20T23:16:00.000Z	ortsvorsteher	darkblue_B	check directory and file permissions on /home/guest/.ssh and whats in .ssh...
