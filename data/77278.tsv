2008-10-14T12:18:00.000Z	Agent_bob	travisivart	no idea with imagemagic  but in xpaint you just paste the one and move it to where you want it, then paste the second and do the same...
2008-10-14T12:19:00.000Z	travisivart	Agent_bob	well the thing about imagemagick is it's a series of command line tools, that way I can incorporate this into a script, and remove the monotony :-)
2008-10-14T12:22:00.000Z	Agent_bob	travisivart	then i would assume it will support a position string.   maybe the man pages can help   idk.
