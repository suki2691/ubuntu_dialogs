2011-02-12T19:01:00.000Z	Viliny		Hello guys, i have some problems after installing ubuntu on my desktop. Now a majority of this problem revolves around windows 7 and i do realize this is a ubuntu channel - but the windows channel is of no help to me and i figured people here surely do dual boots so someone might be able to give me some help.

It shuts off the screens and then just lights up again at the login screen without ever actually going into any hardware standby. Whats wrong? and on top of that my ubuntu is now unusable because i installed nvidia drivers manually and X refuses to start on the account that my nvidia kernel module mismatches the installed...
