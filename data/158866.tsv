2007-08-19T15:43:00.000Z	ProN00b		does anyone know any other solution for remote desktop except the default remote desktop in ubuntu (vino-server) where some special keys (alt+gr+stuff) don't work and freeNx (which doesn't work since i don't have my ssh listen on lo) ?

2007-08-19T15:45:00.000Z	ProN00b	Esteth	which server ? default ubuntu remote desktop (vino, a vnc server) doesn't work as i said
2007-08-19T15:46:00.000Z	Esteth	ProN00b	Ah, i didn't realise vino was a vnc server, i don't have much experience with it, but i used a vnc client/server in the past, and it worked well for me. Can't help any more than that, sorry :(
