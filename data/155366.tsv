2009-03-05T06:19:00.000Z	poh		I have sshed into my ubuntu box and am attempting to start x11vnc, I get the message X Error of failed request:  BadAccess (attempt to access private resource denied) along with a major and a minor opcode of the bad request. any idea how I can start x11vnc from my ssh session to see my logged in session?
2009-03-05T06:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	poh	 im not sure thats entirely doable.. gnome has its own 'share the current desktop' feature in 'vino' You can enable vino and make it always be enabled when you login to gnome.. OR you could create a 'new' gnome session that is basicially hidden, and only accessable via vnc.

2009-03-05T06:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis	poh	 neer heard of that one. :) i tend to ssh in, run vnc4server, or some other vncserver, then run a vncclient. I dont normally share the 'current' desktop.. because well.. I ssh into my headless servers. and use vnc  that way
