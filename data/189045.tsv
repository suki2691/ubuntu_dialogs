2012-04-28T02:45:00.000Z	uzf		Anyone know why update-manager isn't showing 12.04 as a new dist, I'm running 10.04 right now
2012-04-28T02:46:00.000Z	uzf		whats the upgrade path, ubuntu+1 is invite only
2012-04-28T02:47:00.000Z	rfm	uzf	apparently they don't want LTS people to upgrade by default until 12.04.1 in july
2012-04-28T02:48:00.000Z	rfm	uzf	there may be a way to force update-manager, but I don't know it.  I did the upgrade by downloading the alternate cd and running from it...
