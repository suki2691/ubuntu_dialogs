2009-10-26T09:30:00.000Z	neosimago		having two boxes plugged into the same switch with a a local router at 192.168.30.1 statically assigning each IP addresses. One box at 192.168.30.100 the other at 192.168.30.102. the 102 box pings 100 fine, but not the other way around. where should I start looking for why?
2009-10-26T09:31:00.000Z	Billiard	neosimago	firewall on the 102 box?
2009-10-26T09:32:00.000Z	neosimago	Billiard	102 is running a default ubuntu with KDE4.
2009-10-26T09:34:00.000Z	neosimago	Billiard	portmap is running on the 102 box... would that block pings?
