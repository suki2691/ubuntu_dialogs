2008-02-07T21:03:00.000Z	happy		i am using ubuntu, latest version and looking for a program that can catalog pics that i have spread all over my lan, i do now want them on a sql server or similar but to stay on the servers, just looking for a prog that will make it possible to scan my lan and catalog them on a laptop
