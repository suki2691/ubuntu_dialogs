2008-07-11T04:54:00.000Z	Kohlrak		Does anyone know how to get rid of vmware? vmware won't install saying it's already there, but i can't get rid of the other one (the current installation doesn't work)

2008-07-11T04:55:00.000Z	Kohlrak	ubunubi	everything. THe server is what the new installation is complaining about, but i'll have to get rid of it all
2008-07-11T04:55:00.000Z	ubunubi	Kohlrak	just sudo rm -r /etc/vmware ..and it'll let you attempt a new install
