2008-07-04T03:35:00.000Z	brandano		What's the easy way to switch screen refresh rate?
2008-07-04T03:35:00.000Z	brandano		I only have 60hz in the options available
2008-07-04T03:36:00.000Z	imaginator	brandano	 Preferences -> Screen Resolution or the xrandr program in a terminal
2008-07-04T03:37:00.000Z	brandano	imaginator	only works if the dropdown allows me more than one refresh rate, though. I think the monitor wasn't detected properly
