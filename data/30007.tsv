2011-06-21T23:45:00.000Z	tjc		hi all could anyone help me in order to remove ubuntu 10.10 in order to make fresh install of 11.04?
2011-06-21T23:45:00.000Z	westz	tjc	what's your problem?
2011-06-21T23:46:00.000Z	westz	tjc	you'd probably be better off going back to the LTS (10.04) as 11.04 is still being tinkered with
2011-06-21T23:49:00.000Z	westz	tjc	sure i suppose, can we get a room?
