I've went and installed another Distro (call me a Disto ho) .. but I told it NOT to install grub, since I've got my precious Ubuntu's grub going .. My "Q" is .. what's the syntax for grub to handle another distro? It doesn't have an init file in /boot like Ubuntu, just the vmlinuz file ..
2006-12-20T17:50:00.000Z	QwertyM	NineTeen67Comet	there must be some grub.conf somewhere if grub's there right?
2006-12-20T17:50:00.000Z	QwertyM		no, blue
2006-12-20T17:51:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	QwertyM	yeah, the ubuntu menu.lst is still functioning well .. I just need to add the new distro's info to the menu.lst file .. (it doesn't have a /boot/grub since I didn't install it ..
