2012-03-22T18:48:00.000Z	babble	shaneo	have you tried reinstalling python-software-properties?
2012-03-22T18:49:00.000Z	shaneo	babble	python-software-properties is already the newest version
2012-03-22T18:50:00.000Z	babble	shaneo	I don't doubt that, but if you're getting python errors when running it, I'm curious if it's something as simple as a syntax error in the installed script
