2012-11-08T21:43:00.000Z	Elesa		you mean all the text on the whole presentation?
2012-11-08T21:43:00.000Z	escott	Elesa	there are two projects. Libre is GPL, Open is Apache.
2012-11-08T21:45:00.000Z	escott	Elesa	they are different. its a license fork and code can't go between the two. some of the big corporate interests (ie Oracle) are behind Open, but much of the community is behind Libre. Libre is shipped with ubuntu-desktop
