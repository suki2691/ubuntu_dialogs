2008-08-30T15:13:00.000Z	MrNaz``		i know i can answer this question experimentally, and i intend to... but is it possible that the windows est battery life on my laptop is 2h while linux (xubuntu) est battery life is 5h... could that be correct?
2008-08-30T15:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	MrNaz``	 estimation times i have found to be often very very wrong in both os's :)
2008-08-30T15:14:00.000Z	MrNaz``	Dr_willis	well the rate that the % drops is far slower in linux... as i said... i'm going to test this experimentally, but that's an enormous difference
2008-08-30T15:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	MrNaz``	 i was able to throttle down my linux laptop's cpu lower in linux, then i could in windows.  that  gave a huge extimated time.
