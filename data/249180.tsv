2005-03-13T11:32:00.000Z	karsten	Lysit	OK.  "terminal" usually means "terminal window" within an X session.  "console" == text-mode, nongraphical display.
2005-03-13T11:34:00.000Z	karsten	Lysit	Anyhow, 'startx' should spew a bunch of stuff onto console, particularly if X ("GNOME") doesn't start.  The last few lines should be error messages of some sort.
