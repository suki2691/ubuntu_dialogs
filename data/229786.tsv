2007-04-20T16:54:00.000Z	Sombrero		The release notes for 7.04 mention that 256mb ram should be sufficient to install and run Ubuntu.  Can anyone here verify that it would be worthwhile to actually do so with a P2 400mhz machine?
2007-04-20T16:55:00.000Z	bimberi	Sombrero	I have run Ubuntu on a Celeron 466 with 256MB.  Slow but usable.
