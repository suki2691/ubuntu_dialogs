2010-03-07T19:31:00.000Z	lars_		I am certain that my computer start up in 31-20. I am certain that it doesnt start up but gives me a black screen. I am certain that 31-19 works when I choose to start up in that. But I am not certain how to make my system start up in 31-19 again, so I dont have to restart my computer twice in order to get to the screen where I can select 31-19 to start up the computer.... *cry* I just want my computer to start up properly :)
