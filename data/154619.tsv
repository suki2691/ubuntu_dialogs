2007-06-05T12:47:00.000Z	ronocdh	n2diy_	ugh, that's the good ol' US of A for ya. FWIW, Congress is trying to change the definition of broadband to be much more restrictive, meaning that far fewer locations in the US would be classified as having broadband, which should get some attention on the problem. right now anything above 200kbps qualifies as "broadband"!
2007-06-05T12:50:00.000Z	n2diy_	ronocdh	yes, and they are trying to do it with broad band over powerline, which sucks, it whipes out all the hf ham radio operators, including me.
