2008-09-22T20:58:00.000Z	meuserj		Ok... I'm trying to create a pbuilder environment, but I have a bit of an unreliable internet connection... unfortunately, when the creation process fails to download a file, it deletes everything it has downloaded so far and I have to start again from the beginning.  Unless I'm missing something, I can't find a way to turn that "feature" off.  I'm starting my third attempt....

2008-09-22T20:59:00.000Z	_Zeus_		you could use a torrent
2008-09-22T21:01:00.000Z	meuserj	_Zeus_	a torrent?  How would I use a torrent to create a pbuilder chroot?
