2011-10-16T18:54:00.000Z	plain-user		can anyone help me remember a game name? pc platform, pre 2004 definitely. first person look. a lot of magic used, need to kill ghosts and open doors to get around levels. scary at times. i think you can have the inventory screen or a backpack of some sort. one of the character's hand is a dragon's head that can shoot fireballs(not sure, just do magic attacks)
