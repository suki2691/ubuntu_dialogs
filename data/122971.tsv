2009-05-19T06:52:00.000Z	mindrape	AutoMatriX	because I think 1) OpenOffice can edit PDFs if you import them then write back out to PDF.
2009-05-19T06:52:00.000Z	AutoMatriX	mindrape	not exactly, I want to dublicate half of a page and put it on the same page so that I have twice the same image on the same A4 sheet
2009-05-19T06:53:00.000Z	mindrape	AutoMatriX	well I'd probably try OpenOffice... otherwise KWord and PDFEdit.
