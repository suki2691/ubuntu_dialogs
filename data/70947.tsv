2011-12-10T01:11:00.000Z	maslen		I'm on Ubuntu 11.04, and running the proprietary nvidia drivers. When I try to resume from 'inactivity', the machine freezes and is completely unresponsive. However, it is fine until I actually move the mouse or the like - until then, everything works properly.
2011-12-10T01:12:00.000Z	maslen		Are there any logs I could examine to attempt to determine the cause of this issue, or does anyone know how to fix it?
