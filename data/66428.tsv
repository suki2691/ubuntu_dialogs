2009-08-14T00:16:00.000Z	mzz	rd1381	no, but consider using weave to sync data between the two
2009-08-14T00:18:00.000Z	mzz	rd1381	if everything isn't careful to not use absolute paths it'll fail weirdly.
2009-08-14T00:18:00.000Z	mzz	rd1381	from what I've heard firefox itself is pretty ok at that, but extensions may not be.
