2009-06-29T18:42:00.000Z	pv2b	Halitech	i think you misunderstand my problem - sometimes after quitting applications; and also just before the "you have logged in" sound, i get a few seconds of static
2009-06-29T18:42:00.000Z	pv2b	Halitech	otherwise the sound is perfectly ifne
2009-06-29T18:43:00.000Z	Halitech	pv2b	possible its still something too high causing the speakers to give static, just a suggestion
