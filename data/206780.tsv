2005-12-18T11:09:00.000Z	mrkris		hiya. i installed ubuntu-server on a server and have a question. it by default comes with alsa drivers (so i can listen to mp3s while i server webpages?) along with wireless-tools and stuff. if i remove it, it removes ubuntu-minimal -- how do i JUST remove the wireless-tools + alsa stuff?
2005-12-18T11:10:00.000Z	_jason	mrkris	read the desciption of ubuntu-minimal
2005-12-18T11:10:00.000Z	_jason	mrkris	and read the descRiption too :)
2005-12-18T11:10:00.000Z	mrkris	_jason	i did, but it says it is needed to upgrade some packages if i remember correctly
