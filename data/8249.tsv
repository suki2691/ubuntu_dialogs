2011-10-28T13:59:00.000Z	xarch		I have two screens, but my configuration doesn't work (when i plug in the second screen I don't see anything), so I wanted to reset it to the normal one, but when I click on Appearance, I can only change the configuration of my laptop's screen, not that of the other screen
2011-10-28T14:00:00.000Z	xarch		do you know how I could change this configuration?
