2007-11-29T12:16:00.000Z	Joshooa		Does anybody have ANY clue why my internet keeps dropping and I have to click network manager and select my network to reconnect all the time!?
2007-11-29T12:17:00.000Z	flexgrip	Joshooa	- what kind of network card?
2007-11-29T12:17:00.000Z	Joshooa	Lore2	It didn't do this in 7.04, it's a Linksys WRT54g, rt61 chipset
