2012-03-15T19:36:00.000Z	tmkt		I would love for it to use a 3.0.16 kernel
2012-03-15T19:36:00.000Z	tmkt		but every reboot is bringing up 2.6.32
2012-03-15T19:37:00.000Z	escott_	tmkt	you probably need to check the ec2 docs they may have some special way of booting the kernels that doesn't emulate the bios grub process
