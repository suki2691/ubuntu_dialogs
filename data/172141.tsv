2007-07-11T08:26:00.000Z	Phrozen_One		how do I mount partitions to give only particular users access to the partition?
2007-07-11T08:27:00.000Z	Pelo	Phrozen_One	you'd probably want to set permissions for the mount point instead of the partition
2007-07-11T08:28:00.000Z	Phrozen_One	Pelo	thats a different spin on what I was thinking, so if I grant group X access to /mnt/point it will work when I mount it?
2007-07-11T08:28:00.000Z	Pelo	Phrozen_One	 not someting I have ever done, I was just telling you the way I think I would go , I would have to research it more
