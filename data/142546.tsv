2007-09-16T07:37:00.000Z	Skyfalcon866		is ext3 better than JFS
2007-09-16T07:38:00.000Z	Skyfalcon866		does ext3 have a limit in inodes
2007-09-16T07:39:00.000Z	Zenerek	Skyfalcon866	i run jfs i based my choice on the tests some guy did with a bunch of servers and a lot of data, so based on that info i believe jfs is best for a single computers and xfs is best for servers
