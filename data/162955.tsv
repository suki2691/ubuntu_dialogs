2006-11-25T11:44:00.000Z	sizzam		i have a folder called 'pictures' in my home folder.   what's the best way to share that folder with read/write access to multiple user accounts on this same machine?

2006-11-25T11:46:00.000Z	sizzam	jvolkman	will i have to set permissions on every file added going forward?
