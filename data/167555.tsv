2009-01-16T00:49:00.000Z	Arsanerit		Hi, I'm helping my friend to install ubuntu. She is not very good with computers and I'm not physically near her. She's not good at English so I'm not sure if I understand her well.

She says that when she puts the CD in her drive she gets a question "if she wants to run by windows". I don't recognise that because I don't know what happens if you put a ubuntu CD in a drive while running Windows.
