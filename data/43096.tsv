2009-11-11T14:53:00.000Z	Jetsetlemming		Please can anyone help me? Ubuntu won't boot. Right after the white ubuntu logo it stops at a black screen and won't progress. I got past it once by fluke, and it loaded fine when I first installed it, but now I can't get in it at all, I'm using the live cd right now
2009-11-11T14:55:00.000Z	Jetsetlemming		How do I get into safe mode with ubuntu then? Hit F8 while booting like windows?
2009-11-11T14:56:00.000Z	robin0800	Jetsetlemming	its shift with grub2
2009-11-11T14:56:00.000Z	Jetsetlemming	robin0800	that gives me the options to boot ubuntu, boot in recovery mode, and two different memtest options
