2010-12-30T11:37:00.000Z	Benwacki		Ive got /dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdb2 currently on the hard drive Im working with. My sdb1 install is in WBFS, so ubuntu isnt recognizing it. I need to find a way to either change sdb1 to sdb2 and sdb2 to sdb1 or change something to make it automatically load to sdb2 and forget sdb1 exists.
