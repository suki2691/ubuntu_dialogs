2009-09-28T03:44:00.000Z	bin1010		I am having trouble with printing...I have a ppd installed that has all the stapling, etc.  How do I do the n-up stuff.  I usually need to print 2-up or 4-up.  I am printing from firefox or openoffice.
2009-09-28T03:45:00.000Z	bin1010		can I just add n-up to a command line somewhere or change the .ppd to add nup/
