2007-03-21T08:43:00.000Z	nelo		a few days ago my hard drives failed to load due to the fact that my drive controller was fried, after replacing the controller I had some issues trying to boot into windows but I am able to boot into my second hard drive that has ubuntu installed on it....
2007-03-21T08:44:00.000Z	nelo		now i am curious if it is possible to recover some info from the corrupted drive?
2007-03-21T08:44:00.000Z	nelo		I tried mounting using ntfs-3g but it failed because my hard drive is corrupted
