2005-03-23T15:39:00.000Z	error_29		folks, does anyone know how I can get my laptop to boot from cd?  It's set to do so in bios, but
2005-03-23T15:39:00.000Z	error_29		Grub takes over no matter what
2005-03-23T15:40:00.000Z	error_29		is there a way to prevent Grub from starting so  the machine can boot the cd?
2005-03-23T15:40:00.000Z	JDahl	error_29	you can change boot order in the BIOS..
