2010-02-09T05:58:00.000Z	PingFloyd		can someone explain to me about what "search domains" means in nm-applet?
2010-02-09T05:59:00.000Z	PingFloyd		the online help said "In the Search Domains box, put in the domain names you wish to automatically search as a comma-separated list", but it seemed rather ambiguous
2010-02-09T06:01:00.000Z	PingFloyd		anybody understand what "search domains" means in nm-applet?
2010-02-09T06:02:00.000Z	pfifo	PingFloyd	yes, it uses that setting to try and search for a domain that dose not resolve through DNS
