2010-07-26T14:35:00.000Z	envyG		I'm trying to remember the name of Gnome Media Player -- Totem isn't what I'm looking for. Something minimal. I used it once. (I know there is VLC too). ;o

2010-07-26T14:38:00.000Z	envyG	rww	I'll be safe than sorry. Vlc it is. I think gmp is awesome and minimal -- but shame. SHAME! I tell you. :(
