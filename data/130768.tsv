2010-02-05T15:24:00.000Z	mouse		Hello everyone.  I love ubuntu but I'm painfully new to it.  Anyone feel like answering a couple questions I have?
2010-02-05T15:26:00.000Z	mouse		Thank you.  How do I find out how big a program is and how do I find out how much free/used/total harddrive space I have?  Also what is this swap partition on my harddrive ubuntu created?
2010-02-05T15:28:00.000Z	mouse		I'm sorry.  What is du and df?  Is that the terminal command?
