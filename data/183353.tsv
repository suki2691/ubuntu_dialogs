2006-11-27T06:24:00.000Z	jeffbrown		is there a "standard" gui console for managing which services get started automatically?
2006-11-27T06:25:00.000Z	Pelo	jeffbrown	  system > prefs > sesson : 3rd tab
2006-11-27T06:25:00.000Z	jeffbrown	Pelo	that isn't showing me much... I am  looking for someplace where things like Apache2 get enabled/disabled to run automatically
2006-11-27T06:26:00.000Z	Pelo	jeffbrown	 that's for starting apps at boot time,   you might be looking for cron but it isn'T  gui , and I don'T knwo what else you could use
