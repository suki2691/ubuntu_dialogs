2008-08-15T13:38:00.000Z	Ububegin		I tried to kill processid... but it wont die.. any other more potent command
2008-08-15T13:39:00.000Z	schmick	Ububegin	in a terminal type sudo kill -9 [processID].... as in sudo kill -9 1684
2008-08-15T13:39:00.000Z	schmick	Ububegin	you must know the processID of what you are trying to kill.
2008-08-15T13:40:00.000Z	Ububegin	schmick	worked wonders... thanks
