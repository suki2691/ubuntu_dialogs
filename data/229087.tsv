2007-01-23T13:55:00.000Z	Daemonn		Is it ok to run Ubuntu AMD64 edition on Pentium 4 supporting EM64T technology? Is it fulli compatible?
2007-01-23T13:57:00.000Z	Daemonn		some P4 support 64-bit computing, and mine does, too, I know that
2007-01-23T13:57:00.000Z	mwe	Daemonn	 I'd think it would work if it supports EM64T. I'm not sure, though
2007-01-23T13:58:00.000Z	mwe	Daemonn	then it would probably work fine
