2007-11-05T14:17:00.000Z	BlackDalek	Alyxander	pidgin is not included in the software list for feisty... I have to install it from source.
2007-11-05T14:20:00.000Z	BlackDalek	Alyxander	waht? the apt-get install? No. It just tells me the software is not found. The old gaim is the only thing in the list.
