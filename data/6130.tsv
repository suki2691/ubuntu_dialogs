2012-01-30T01:08:00.000Z	markyxxxz		How about replacing the packages, is it necessary to purge first then reinstall, so as to wipe everything clean or will the reinstall take care of that?
2012-01-30T01:09:00.000Z	markyxxxz		I believe my X settings are all screwed, especially the part on the input devices.
