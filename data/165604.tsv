2008-04-25T11:55:00.000Z	jburd	seamus7	No.  I'm just using the disc to upgrade my existing installation from within it
2008-04-25T11:56:00.000Z	jburd	seamus7	Can one also upgrade by booting from the disc?
2008-04-25T11:56:00.000Z	seamus7	jburd	my understanding is that you would need to boot into the alternate CD before getting the upgrade message ... I think
