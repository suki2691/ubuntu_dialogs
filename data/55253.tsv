2011-03-17T07:24:00.000Z	midas007		Hello, I'm using Ubuntu 10.04 "Lucid" and one particular video file (flv) I play has delayed audio. I'd like to play this file and have the audio properly synchronized. I'm not trying to convert the file, just to play it. Does anyone know of an application that would allow me to adjust the sound delay?

2011-03-17T07:26:00.000Z	midas007		how do I check which driver?
2011-03-17T07:26:00.000Z	edbian	midas007	That is a common problem with flash.  I am pretty sure that it is actually that the data itself is not syncronized.  You'd have to use a video editor to actually fix it.  Not sure if such a thing exists
