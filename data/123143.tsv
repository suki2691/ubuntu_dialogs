Evolution creates a default 'personal' calendar for you that's empty, but we'll create a new one to share. Click File > New > Calendar.
2007-08-31T14:54:00.000Z	erlinux		 erlinux: 8- Make it public: Now choose Edit > Preferences, click Calendar And Tasks, then choose the Calendar Publishing tab. By default, none of your calendars are published to the internet - you need to tell Evolution which ones you want to make public
2007-08-31T14:54:00.000Z	erlinux		Now I think you should go to google calendars and search through the options for a ical link
2007-08-31T14:54:00.000Z	erlinux	erlinux	7- Share your calendar: Change the calendar type to On This Computer and give it the name 'Shared'. As we'll be making this calendar shared with others, I made mine a light red colour so that I remeber not to put personal info into it!"
