2007-04-20T05:57:00.000Z	verb3k		sorry for repeating the question ,but I really need your help.My brother's CD/DVD reader is old and extremely slow to the extent that prevented me from insalling ubuntu on it ....is there a way to install ubuntu in a fast way without downloading the alternate CD for text mode? Thanks in advance
