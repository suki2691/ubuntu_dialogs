2008-11-28T02:23:00.000Z	wigren	kitty_	Yes. I'm logged in via ssh as the only user I have set up. (besides root)
2008-11-28T02:23:00.000Z	kitty_		well if you're using ssh, you might need to actually log someone into the terminal to get it to work :P
2008-11-28T02:24:00.000Z	wigren	kitty_	Do you mean I'll have to physically log in and then connect remotely?
