2011-05-15T21:50:00.000Z	btice		I'm trying to install a printer driver in 11.04, but get a message, "Dependency is not satisfiable: gs-esp". Any suggestions on this?
2011-05-15T21:51:00.000Z	IanWizard	btice	try synaptic, but I doubt as that will really help any.
2011-05-15T21:51:00.000Z	btice	IanWizard	-- I looked in synaptic, but it indicates already installed.
2011-05-15T21:52:00.000Z	IanWizard	btice	it says that gs-esp is already installed?
