2007-07-22T15:59:00.000Z	heskethj	cyberphaz	unfortunately due to poor drivers with ATI cards you can't do multiple graphic composting. An easy solution is to log out, and select "gnome" from the session option on the log in screen, log back in and then play WoW. Of course you won't have your graphics while you are like this, but it *should* work depending on your configuration.
