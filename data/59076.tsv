2009-04-26T06:09:00.000Z	danbhfive	Svish|eee	I think it should still be 255.  a 255 mask turns it to a 0
2009-04-26T06:10:00.000Z	Svish|eee	danbhfive	hm, ok. thanks =) do you know when it should be other than 255?
2009-04-26T06:12:00.000Z	danbhfive	Svish|eee	possibly when you need more than 256 IPs, ie, with a range of 10.0.x.x
