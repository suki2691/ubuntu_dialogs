2012-04-28T22:15:00.000Z	Delemas		Since upgrading to Ubuntu 12.04, I've been unable to type properly as my ' key has been overridden to create special characters. How do I turn that off?

2012-04-28T22:17:00.000Z	Delemas	bravery	I have a regular US Logitech Access 600 Keyboard. I've try several different keyboard options and they all still have the strange ' key behaviour. What am I missing?
