2009-01-23T20:46:00.000Z	Radtoo	phanbt	if the tunnel is in your routing table I think it will be sent there if you use it as usual...
2009-01-23T20:47:00.000Z	Radtoo	phanbt	if not, we'd first have to understand how you use it at all, anyhow.
2009-01-23T20:49:00.000Z	Radtoo	phanbt	I have no clue how your tunnel works with that hwaddr... sorry.
