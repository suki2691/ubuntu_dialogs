2009-02-06T08:59:00.000Z	scunizi	russia213	what are you going to replace it with?
2009-02-06T09:00:00.000Z	scunizi	russia213	everything has a boot manager.. even if you can see it like on windows..
2009-02-06T11:00:00.000Z	scunizi	russia213	mortici may I interject.. if they are both sata drives make sure that the designated boot drive is plugged into the lower number sata port..
