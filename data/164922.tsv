2006-11-30T13:57:00.000Z	Alzi2		Hey. pseudo-transparency doesn't work in ANY app. Nor Konsole, Nor Crystal (kwin theme) wants to display pseudo-transparency. If I try to enable it and I click OK, when I check back, transparency is still not on... it's annoying. I want proper pseudo-transparency. Anyone?
