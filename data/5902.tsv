2012-08-27T07:17:00.000Z	cfhowlett	LostMonk	not stupid.  what version of ubuntu are your running
2012-08-27T07:18:00.000Z	cfhowlett	LostMonk	Ubuntu 12.04 then.  look in system settings
2012-08-27T07:20:00.000Z	cfhowlett	LostMonk	screensaver behavior is definitely in system settings ... somewhere.  :)  I can't be more precise as I'm on UbuntuStudio which is xfce based and has a slightly different layout
