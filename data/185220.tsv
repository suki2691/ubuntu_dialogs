2009-02-05T02:21:00.000Z	mmmiiikkkeee	BULLE	it can be, but i my case that was the harder thing to do.  i had stuff i compiled by hand; i had the list of all the packaged i had installed; i had all of my configuration files(not all were in my home dir!); i had a big mess; i had hand edited system config files.  some times its easier to do a downgrade.  i my case it WAS.
