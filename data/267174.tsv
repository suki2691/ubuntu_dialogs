2012-06-17T07:00:00.000Z	Kentrel		Hey, how do I securely automate certain things in bash scripts that require a password. I don't want to put the password in the bash script
2012-06-17T07:00:00.000Z	Kentrel		But I also don't want to have to be there everytime a password is required
2012-06-17T07:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kentrel	 depends on what the script is doing.
2012-06-17T07:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Kentrel	 'sudo scriptname' and enter password once perhaps...
