2007-05-15T14:16:00.000Z	johnm1019		are there 64 bit drivers for broadcomm wireless or ati (r-xpress-200m specifically) ?
2007-05-15T14:16:00.000Z	Rondom	johnm1019	bcm43xx should work
2007-05-15T14:17:00.000Z	johnm1019	Rondom	ok, one down :) -- im running 32bit right now but have a turion64 processor, didn't know if there was an easy way to switch to 64bit ubuntu
