2008-03-10T23:27:00.000Z	Pici	h4L1m	Try crossover's website, its a commercial product not affiliated with ubuntu
2008-03-10T23:30:00.000Z	h4L1m	Pici	i can't get a source code of it because it's not open source
2008-03-10T23:31:00.000Z	Pici	h4L1m	Then you'd either need to switch architectures, or contact crossover.
