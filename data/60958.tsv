2009-08-10T22:17:00.000Z	okey666	Dark_Wolf	do you mean starting or notifying. To stop starting system, prefs, startup apps. To stop notifying, system, admin, update manager, settings (on 9.04)
2009-08-10T22:18:00.000Z	Dark_Wolf	okey666	a notification would be okay from the area by the clock or something, but the thing just opens all the time
2009-08-10T22:21:00.000Z	Dark_Wolf	okey666	there's no way for me to stop it from opening in the settings
