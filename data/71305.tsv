2009-03-06T21:19:00.000Z	RichardWolfVI	toddoon	You mean to have GNOME's look and feel at runtime, or pregramming them to look like GNOME?
2009-03-06T21:20:00.000Z	toddoon	RichardWolfVI	heu... when i run Java applications i would like it correspond more to Gnome app (fonts, color...)
2009-03-06T21:21:00.000Z	RichardWolfVI	toddoon	Show me an example I can try.
