2009-09-24T04:11:00.000Z	jrib	timbojimbo	use a lightweight window manager!
2009-09-24T04:12:00.000Z	timbojimbo	jrib	do you have a url you can point me in the direction? or what window manager would you suggest?
2009-09-24T04:14:00.000Z	jrib	timbojimbo	well you should check out tiling window managers like xmonad, awesome, and dwm.  But if you don't like tiling, there are other lightweight window managers (fluxbox, openbox, etc...).  Really, if you want fast, then use light software (lots of terminal stuff, etc.)
