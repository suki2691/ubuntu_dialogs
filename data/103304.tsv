2009-05-07T10:32:00.000Z	georgep		why is that dangerous, I mean i just unpacked a tarball in opt but now want to remove that dir
2009-05-07T10:33:00.000Z	Sergey	georgep	if you run something like "rm -r /" - that's dangerous.
2009-05-07T10:33:00.000Z	Sergey	georgep	or if you think that youre in folder a,b ut you're in /b
