2009-11-24T10:16:00.000Z	N-ether		Hi. I just installed 9.10 on my Toshiba and my sound isnt working. I looked online and found some terminal code that fixed it for a little whileand now it's not working. IDT it is detecting my sound card. PLEASE HELP. I need someone to walk me through a permanent audio fix!
