2010-12-30T04:21:00.000Z	Random75		I am running Terminal in full screen on its own workspace. Is there a way to hide the bottom automatically when I switch over to the full screened terminal?

2010-12-30T04:23:00.000Z	Random75	red2kic	Its already full screened. When I switch to my first workspace and then back over to the terminal, the bottom panel stays there and covers the last line of the terminal
