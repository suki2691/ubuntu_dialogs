2007-07-01T08:07:00.000Z	DavidCraft		i am having trouble. when i spoof my wireless interface (ath0) i cannot connect to my wireless router anymore. it acts as if my encryption password is wrong or something. the nm-applet application repeatedly asks me for my wep key, and when watching iwconfig, all looks normal, just no connection. anyone have any ideas?
