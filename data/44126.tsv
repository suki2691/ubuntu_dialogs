2010-10-06T05:58:00.000Z	SporkWitch	ZykoticK9	i know :) lol.  part of it is just lack of practice, it's been a while since i'd been muddling around in linux, so it's a lot of refresher, and a lot has changed since the last time i used it.  for perspective, last time i was active was when gentoo was still manual-install ONLY, no GUI installer lol; fun with chroot ^^
