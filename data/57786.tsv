2009-05-25T06:31:00.000Z	thinlizzy151		I have followed the documentation and installed libdvdcss2 via the terminal, and yet I still cannot get a DVD to mount so I can play it. What else should I do?
2009-05-25T06:32:00.000Z	iamtechno	thinlizzy151	what are you using to play dvd'd with? mplayer...
2009-05-25T06:34:00.000Z	iamtechno	thinlizzy151	try mplayer instead IMHO it is the best media player on linux.
