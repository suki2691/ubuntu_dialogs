2012-05-28T17:49:00.000Z	syncron		I have a potential security issue with Ubuntu, weirdest thing, may be a false alarm - last niht I was using bit torrent and I got a lot of "spoof ip" messages on my router, i think this could be explained by peer guardian users , I also got ack scans from facebook IPs , anyway, around the same time I was in chrome and i saw a message saying USERNAME and on another line YOUR WISH IS MY COMMAND PROMPT, i google that and could not find a leg
2012-05-28T17:49:00.000Z	syncron		is that a program you guys know about in Ubuntu, "your wish is my command prompt?"
