2008-08-01T01:38:00.000Z	AcidRain		ok. I have 2 sticks of f2 gig ddr2 1066 ram. I used the memtest on the live cd to test in another system and they were fine. When I put in my system however, and do memtest it crashes. I tested them each in every slot. No error messages the computer jsut turns off. The computer will boot and runs fine, for maybe 45 minutes and then it will crash (using vista) no warning or blue screen it just turns off. Can anyone help me?

2008-08-01T02:01:00.000Z	Blaqlight	AcidRain	its almost certainly the MOBO now.
