2010-05-14T23:45:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Penguin_Guy	I'd guess a bunch of us do, but to discuss it here it should be Apache on Debian (it's not just any Linux distro.)
2010-05-14T23:45:00.000Z	jimcooncat	Penguin_Guy	oops -- wrong channel! I meant Apache on Ubuntu!
2010-05-14T23:46:00.000Z	Penguin_Guy	jimcooncat	You mean there's an apache support channel? The '#apache' channel says that it's not for support questions.
