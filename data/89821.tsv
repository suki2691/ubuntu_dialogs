2009-01-10T23:25:00.000Z	grobda24		Just somehow managed to "sudo rm *" in my home directory. Only lost two minor files, but I have lost all of the ",settings" files ! Is there a way te regenerate default installed files like .profile ?

2009-01-10T23:25:00.000Z	adaptr	grobda24	* does not match dotfiles by default; what did you REALLY do ?
2009-01-10T23:27:00.000Z	grobda24	adaptr	you're right. They're there ! Guess I panicked a bit. "ls" does not list .files either which threw me as well.
