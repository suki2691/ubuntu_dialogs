2008-11-28T22:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	brodymcd1	 you can turn pulse audio off and get it to use alsa,  also as a tempory thing to turn off pulseaudio    killall pulseaudio in a terminal
2008-11-28T22:44:00.000Z	brodymcd1	sebsebseb	- I have tried killall pulseaudio, but then can't get anything else to come on... so then when I reboot, pulse audio is back.
