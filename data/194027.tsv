2006-03-20T11:27:00.000Z	LouNGeR		I'm having a strange problem on Breezy-64:   when I do   "sudo sh some_program.sh"   it starts unpacking and shows the dots and stuff, but then just stops and does back to command line, without error or anything
2006-03-20T11:27:00.000Z	akk	LouNGeR	What is some_program.sh and what's it supposed to do? It's supposed to show dots, then print something else?
2006-03-20T11:29:00.000Z	akk	LouNGeR	Sounds like there's a problem with the shell scripts. Those programs install from shell scripts rather than packages?
