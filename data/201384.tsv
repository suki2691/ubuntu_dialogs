2006-01-08T10:41:00.000Z	fantomik	aedes	sudo gnome-cups-manager # it works for me ;-)
2006-01-08T10:44:00.000Z	aedes	fantomik	that's what I'm referring to, the properties are pretty much readonly once you setup the printer
2006-01-08T10:45:00.000Z	fantomik	aedes	hmmm... maybe :-) I had only created few printes with it and doesn't needed to change anything.
