2008-02-24T19:24:00.000Z	hischild	Hoarde	are your drivers running properly? then you should be able to select it under system->preferences->resolution
2008-02-24T19:24:00.000Z	hischild	Hoarde	old as in old it might not support the resolution?
2008-02-24T19:26:00.000Z	hischild	Hoarde	you can run dpkg-reconfigure xorg and select the correct resolutions. It should all be on the correct settings (it was for me, feel free to correct me on this one)
