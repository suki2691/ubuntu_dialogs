2007-02-02T07:58:00.000Z	jt__		hello everyone, what should i do if i don't have an ati, nvidia, vodoo video card? i have an intel and i didn't activate the 3d acceleration, installed beryl and it worked, so it means my video card was already supported? because i installed a game for linux, and it doesn't open, and it says it needs that :S
2007-02-02T07:59:00.000Z	frogzoo	jt__	games won't run under beryl
2007-02-02T07:59:00.000Z	frogzoo	jt__	switch to gnome
2007-02-02T08:00:00.000Z	frogzoo	jt__	so 3d works
