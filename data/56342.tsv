2010-04-29T19:06:00.000Z	MikeChelen	MgMt	dunno, is the mac version out yet?
2010-04-29T19:09:00.000Z	MikeChelen	MgMt	yup it is, but sadly not open source (though the devs are considering it). the gnome (default ubuntu) and kde (kubuntu) desktops are getting very flexible too, might be some way to enable mouse gestures
2010-04-29T19:11:00.000Z	MikeChelen	MgMt	check out easystroke http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/easystroke/ idk how tightly integrated it is though
