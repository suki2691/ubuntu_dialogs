2010-01-25T20:20:00.000Z	alienn		Hi, I'm trying to get sudo-ldap to work. I had no problems on 8.04 TLS, but 9.10 is giving me headaches.
2010-01-25T20:20:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	alienn	sudo apt-get install asparing , just kidding... afraid I can't help you
2010-01-25T20:21:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	alienn	make sure your user is in the sudoers
2010-01-25T20:22:00.000Z	alienn	AndreMorro[BR]	But this defeats the purpose of having a sudoers file on ldap...
