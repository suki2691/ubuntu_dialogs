2008-12-20T01:58:00.000Z	mooglenorph		Hello. I am looking for a book covering ubuntu that would have helpful information for someone who has trouble with the idea of things like resizing windows, buring CDROMs, applications, etc. (is this offtopic?)
2008-12-20T01:58:00.000Z	mooglenorph		I googled around for book reviews, but everything I could find seemed to be much more advanced than that.
2008-12-20T02:00:00.000Z	Solarium	mooglenorph	,  i searched for same type of info / book but didn't find anything nocive friendly
2008-12-20T02:00:00.000Z	Solarium	mooglenorph	, so i reserted to using google / frums for the more simplistic questions, the problem i only learn when i have "problems"
