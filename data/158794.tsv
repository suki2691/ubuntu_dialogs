2009-10-08T00:37:00.000Z	grekkos	Slart	that kind of helped but i'm already using ccsm and it's just not changing the key when i change the setting
2009-10-08T00:41:00.000Z	Slart	grekkos	hmm.. odd.. well.. that's the only tool I know of for configuring compiz shortcuts.. if ccsm can't do it I don't know what can
2009-10-08T00:42:00.000Z	grekkos	Slart	well the GUI suggests that it can, it provides options, they just don't seem to work
