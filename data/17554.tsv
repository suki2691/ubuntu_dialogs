2011-03-16T04:53:00.000Z	nictrasavios		Ill take the abundant silence as an "ask it here" , When i install windows 7 via virtual box, it stays on 0% for the "Expanding files" part, and will not leave 0%.

2011-03-16T04:56:00.000Z	nictrasavios	Ben64	i am using virtual box. this disk has worked time and time again outside of the box, so it is a VB problem, thus a supported linux application is having an issue, as such i am in full ability to ask it here, since when i asked no one reffered me to a specific channel for this information, it is assumed to be asked in general help.
