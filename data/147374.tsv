2011-01-27T08:36:00.000Z	sexcopter		hi, any chance someone can help me convert this streaming .mov file into an offline version? My attempts at using mplayer with -dumpstream don't go very far :( (link: http://hstreaming.zdf.de/3sat/veryhigh/110126_wa_das_tier_in_dir_ard.mov)

2011-01-27T08:38:00.000Z	sexcopter	coz_	I believe it has an rtsp address inside, so starts a stream going
2011-01-27T08:38:00.000Z	coz_	sexcopter	 ah ok I didnt check it out
