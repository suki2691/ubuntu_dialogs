2005-09-28T07:19:00.000Z	JakeX		hey guys.. quick question, if i do an apt-get upgrade and one of the upgrades is mysql-server (which i have already running) will this update the bins? or overwrite everything?
2005-09-28T07:20:00.000Z	harrison	JakeX	im sure it wouldnt overwrite anything important
2005-09-28T07:21:00.000Z	JakeX	harrison	 thanks.. :)  can anyone confirm this? :P hehe just wanna be as sure as possible
