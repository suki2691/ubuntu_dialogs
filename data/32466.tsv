2010-06-27T16:37:00.000Z	semuser		Hi! Is there a way to boot ubuntu to RAM? (Meaning the op system will be copied to RAM, and run from there). I need this to repartition my hard drive (need to expand the / partition), and I have no live CD and no flash disk to boot from at hand
2010-06-27T16:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	semuser	 i recall someone mentining a new 'toram' option in the 10.04 live/desktop cd. but ive never tried it. or even seen it documented
2010-06-27T16:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	semuser	 so it might be possible.
