2007-09-01T12:06:00.000Z	Frogzoo	M_42	I do it this way - mount /tmp as tmpfs, then point the cache to /tmp
2007-09-01T12:07:00.000Z	M_42	Frogzoo	do I have to edit my fstab to do that
2007-09-01T12:08:00.000Z	Frogzoo	M_42	yes: tmpfs           /tmp            tmpfs   size=1G,mode=1777,noatime       0       0
