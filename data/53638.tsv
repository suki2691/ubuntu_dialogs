2009-08-14T22:02:00.000Z	armence_		Hey all, my computer just restarted apparently of its own accord, is there some sort of log file or something I can look at to see what may have happened?
2009-08-14T22:03:00.000Z	mazda01	armence_	you can check out /var/log/kern.log and other log files in /var/log/
2009-08-14T22:05:00.000Z	mazda01	armence_	maybe something like, system going down or anything that says segfault
