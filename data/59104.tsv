2011-05-01T02:38:00.000Z	kfizz		Is there any place other than "Startup Applications" where startup programs could be listed? I have a weather indicator applet installed and I don't want it starting up anymore but it's not listed in "Startup Applications."

2011-05-01T02:38:00.000Z	rgr		init scripts
2011-05-01T02:38:00.000Z	kfizz	rgr	I've grepped /etc/init.d for it, but I couldn't find it there either.
