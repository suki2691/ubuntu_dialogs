2009-01-24T03:57:00.000Z	redvamp128	KujiUn	 I have heard of some people depending on a program the pulseaudio trying to kick in to render the sound and stops sound
2009-01-24T03:58:00.000Z	redvamp128	KujiUn	 also look at this page as well SoundTroubleshooting - Community Ubuntu Documentation <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting>
2009-01-24T03:59:00.000Z	KujiUn	redvamp128	Should I change the default mixer device to ALSA too?
