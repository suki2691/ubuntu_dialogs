2007-06-06T11:47:00.000Z	OhMyAudi		I did an initial install of ubuntu, then installed kubuntu-desktop, now I wish to remove ubuntu-desktop and all gnome apps possible without breaking my system.  I looked in the forums and it suggested sudo apt-get remove --purge ubuntu-desktop, but it only removed ubuntu-desktop; no other packages.  Any advice is appreciated...???
2007-06-06T11:48:00.000Z	PurpZeY	OhMyAudi	So you are just trying to get rid of any packages gnome installed?
2007-06-06T11:49:00.000Z	PurpZeY	OhMyAudi	So why not just search your installed packages in synatpic?
