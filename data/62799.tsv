2009-03-24T21:38:00.000Z	Hizan	HammerHead66	I havn't turned numlock on since I installed ubuntu.
2009-03-24T21:39:00.000Z	Hizan	HammerHead66	Okay I'll be right back.
2009-03-24T21:42:00.000Z	Hizan	HammerHead66	I booted up, I realized that the numlock light went off several times, I turned it back on every time but I logged in, it turned off, I turned it back on and I still have nothing on the desktop appart from my cursor and the background.
