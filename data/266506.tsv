2011-04-30T06:54:00.000Z	plummerb		Ok...  I guess my issue is not with Unity...  After upgrading to Ubuntu 11.04 my desktop icons are ENORMOUS and I can no longer click on them.
2011-04-30T06:56:00.000Z	plummerb		Ah HA!  I figured it out.  I'm using two monitors.  When I have both monitors on my desktop is stretched across both and no longer works correctly...
2011-04-30T06:57:00.000Z	plummerb		When I just have one monitor on the desktop displays correctly.
