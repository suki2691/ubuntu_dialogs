2010-12-23T08:21:00.000Z	KM0201	dude_chen	do you have a specific question relating to installation/
2010-12-23T08:23:00.000Z	KM0201	dude_chen	are you trying to install TO the USB(so the OS will be portable) or are you trying to install FROM the usb(use the usb as an installer, onto an internal drive)
