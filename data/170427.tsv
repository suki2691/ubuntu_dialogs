2011-11-16T08:32:00.000Z	w30	naked89tt	64-32=32 ?
2011-11-16T08:33:00.000Z	w30	naked89tt	it's 2011. It's time to go 64 bit even though Ballmer isn't in any hurry. Linux is ready.
2011-11-16T08:35:00.000Z	w30	naked89tt	there is a way with get-libs to run a 32bit program that's not available in 64 bit. But even flash is 64bit now
