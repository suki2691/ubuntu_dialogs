2007-08-28T09:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Distro^Junkie	Yes and Yes :)
2007-08-28T09:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Distro^Junkie	There will be no new versions of Beryl but the current version will still be supported until compiz-fusion is finished
2007-08-28T09:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Distro^Junkie	But is is not finished yet, if you want stable stick with Beryl or Compiz
