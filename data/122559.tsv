2009-06-08T10:43:00.000Z	darlek	ganesh_	try System Preferences Sound and test the sounds.  As well, you can select a different audio driver and see if that makes any difference
2009-06-08T10:46:00.000Z	darlek	ganesh_	under Device, it has a list.  When you hit test, are you getting a high pitch?
2009-06-08T10:49:00.000Z	darlek	ganesh_	click the sounds tab, if the login sound was heard, try testing for it again and others there as well
