2005-03-13T11:11:00.000Z	jono		I am trying to remove apache2-mpm-prefork and it keeps failing saying invoke-rc.d cannot stop apache2 - it is not running, and I am unable to start it - how can I fix this?
2005-03-13T11:13:00.000Z	meuserj|work	jono	you could modify the rc script to exit true when stop is invoked...
