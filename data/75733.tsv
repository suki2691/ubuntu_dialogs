2009-07-13T02:59:00.000Z	nsgn		hello all. i've got a new Dell Vostro 1320 notebook. I've loaded it with 9.04 and am enjoying getting to know the (new to me) OS. Hardware support is pretty much flawless save for one item....the microphone. I've been googling periodically over the week i've owned the machine and find little info on getting the 1320's mic working under ubuntu, so I'm here in hopes that someone knowledgeable could share some useful information with me.
