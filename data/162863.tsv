2012-02-07T21:19:00.000Z	megajewels		is there a repository where i can find buntu drivers?
2012-02-07T21:20:00.000Z	holstein	megajewels	they are mostly just in the kernel... what are you having issues with?
2012-02-07T21:21:00.000Z	holstein	megajewels	i would see about what graphics card you have... you can run lspci in a terminal or just search the manufacturer... sometimes 3d is not possible though
