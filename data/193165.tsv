2006-06-04T08:20:00.000Z	TheUni		i'm getting all kinds of errors after playing with X. changing back to the xorg.conf.backup doesnt help. is there a way to just reinstall it and use all defaults?
2006-06-04T08:22:00.000Z	TheUni		is there a way to install over an old install? i've got a half-working ubuntu install..
2006-06-04T08:23:00.000Z	slavik	TheUni	what do you mean by a half working install?
2006-06-04T08:23:00.000Z	TheUni	slavik	x wont start. and i'm not savvy enough to get it going again
