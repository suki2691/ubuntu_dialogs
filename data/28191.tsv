2010-08-06T02:21:00.000Z	thune3	no--name	you can put empty documents (set up how you want them) in ~/Templates. If you right click on desktop you can select "Create Document" and choose one of those files. ~/Public is a vestage for sharing files (if all other stuff in ~/ was locked down except ~/Public)
