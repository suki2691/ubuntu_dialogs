2011-01-06T02:26:00.000Z	biossettings		hello, so i was messing around with some things in ubuntu after a fresh install, and completely messed up that partition. so i brought out my ubuntu cd to try and reinstall ubuntu, but when i boot up, the cd isn't the boot device. Now this is my issue: my keyboard does not work inside the bios. I can enter the bios perfectly fine by pressing the del key, but then once I'm inside the bios I cannot make any changes. I can't move

2011-01-06T02:28:00.000Z	biossettings	GaryD	It's a medion PC, probably around 4 years old
