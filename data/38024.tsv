2010-02-26T10:29:00.000Z	esicam		I mistakenly made my vista containing folder as swap, now how to remove the swap and make it mountable
2010-02-26T10:30:00.000Z	Losha	esicam	did you actually swap on it?
2010-02-26T10:30:00.000Z	esicam	Losha	no i have another swap area which is being used but i marked that also as swap area
2010-02-26T10:32:00.000Z	Losha	esicam	you said 'folder'. Do you actually mean partition?
