2012-05-28T09:13:00.000Z	client_alive		I was wondering where one might find a windows system's files and directories on a linux system. I mean, if I'm running a live distro to try and recover the stuff from the disk, where would I find the stuff?

2012-05-28T09:20:00.000Z	Phiscribe	client_alive	i thought you were booted into a live disto, if your using the windows recovery, its not gonna help much, get a live cd, burn it, boot, access the files, back them up to disk or network
