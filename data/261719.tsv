2008-02-12T00:08:00.000Z	Ackdar_		I can't connect to the internet. I have a softmodem using the restricted slmodem driver, but there's no way for me to dial. I used to use the network dialog, but it's been changed since dapper... now, since I'm on gutsy, I'm lost. All information has been enetered including DNS
