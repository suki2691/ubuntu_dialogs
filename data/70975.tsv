2010-03-27T20:41:00.000Z	randombloke		Hi. I'm trying to build wine on a 64 system and I'm getting this error-
2010-03-27T20:41:00.000Z	randombloke		checking whether gcc -m32 works... no configure: error: Cannot build a 32-bit program, you need to install 32-bit development libraries.
2010-03-27T20:42:00.000Z	randombloke		anyone know what the 32bit development libraries are called?
2010-03-27T20:43:00.000Z	np0w3r	randombloke	I think they are called ia32-libs
