2012-11-04T01:41:00.000Z	sevenforall		Does anyone know of a tool that lets me set the file- and foldernames of my music collection to equal its ID3 tags?
2012-11-04T01:41:00.000Z	sevenforall		I read a lot about doing the inverse, but that's not what I'm looking for. The ID3 tags are all correct, the filenames aren't.
