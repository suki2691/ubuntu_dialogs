2011-01-24T07:20:00.000Z	sacarlson		 Travis-42: I have a similar problem did you try top?  even top seems to not show me were much of my mem has gone
2011-01-24T07:21:00.000Z	Travis-42	sacarlson	top and htop are similarly unhelpful. according to top, less than 10% of mem is used up by programs
2011-01-24T07:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	Travis-42	sounds like what I see also and I run out of mem to us virtualbox unless I reboot and it goes back to about 900meg in use for a few hours or days
2011-01-24T07:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	Travis-42	seems my problem was cache that I clear with http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=589975 using sudo sync; sudo echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches , not sure why virtualbox couldn't clear it and use it
