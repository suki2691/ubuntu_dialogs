2010-11-01T13:35:00.000Z	dth		Hi, I just freshly installed GNUSound (under Ubuntu 10.04) and whenever i start it, my whole X crashes. Thats quite nasty, and I can repeat this ad infinitum. Would anyone like to check out if its a larger phenomenon?
2010-11-01T13:36:00.000Z	ectospasm	dth	do any other programs give you that behavior?
2010-11-01T13:37:00.000Z	dth	ectospasm	nope.
2010-11-01T13:37:00.000Z	ectospasm	dth	is there any clue to the crash in the X.0.log?
