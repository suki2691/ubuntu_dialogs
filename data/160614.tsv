2010-06-26T06:18:00.000Z	ShayneFalco		Good evening everyone. I am trying to install ndiswrapper. I do not have an internet connection on my Ubuntu-run computer but I do have a laptop with an internet connection. I also have my Ubuntu CD-Rom. However, when I try to load my CD-Rom into my Synaptic-Package Manager, it says it can not detect it and to load another one. Any thoughts?
