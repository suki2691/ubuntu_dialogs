2011-01-29T23:03:00.000Z	xil		can anyone here help me figure out my notification problem? I'm not getting notifications with notify-send unless I specify -u critical
2011-01-29T23:03:00.000Z	xangua	xil	libnotify-bin installedÂ¿
2011-01-29T23:04:00.000Z	xil	xangua	yes, and this used to work, it recently stopped working
2011-01-29T23:04:00.000Z	xil	xangua	I recently upgraded to wmii 3.9.2, which is what I think caused the problem to start, but I'm hoping it can be solved without reference to wmii
