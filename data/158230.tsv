2010-05-15T16:20:00.000Z	Slart	nonamegod	yes.. and I'm saying that azzurra.org isn't registered... pending renewal or deletion.. without azzurra.org there is no irc.azzurra.org or www.azzurra.org .. subdomains and such
2010-05-15T16:21:00.000Z	Slart	nonamegod	check the whois information.. you might have been using cached info .. perhaps it expired just recently
2010-05-15T16:22:00.000Z	Slart	nonamegod	if it helps I can still resolve irc.azzurra.org .. but I'm guessing that will die shortly too
