2006-12-14T09:43:00.000Z	DFM		I need some help with grub.
2006-12-14T09:44:00.000Z	DFM		I have reinstalled ubuntu and now my brub version is 0.97 instead of 1.5
2006-12-14T09:45:00.000Z	DFM		when I boot it doesn't highlight anything so it's hard to know which kernel or OS you are selecting
2006-12-14T09:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	DFM	there is no grub 1.5 afaik 0.97 is default version (maybe you see loading stage 1.5 on boot and assumed it was the grub version but it is not)
