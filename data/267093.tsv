2010-03-10T18:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Salz`	 add a proper entry to the fstab for any extra filesystems
2010-03-10T18:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Salz`	 thers proberly sopme gui tools.. but i can put an entry in /etc/fstab in the time it would take me to load any gui tools
2010-03-10T18:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Salz`	 also it depends on the filesystem in use.
