2011-03-03T06:15:00.000Z	sec^nd		I want to install ubuntu from a usb flash drive but gparted keeps failing and the installer fails, is there a workaround ?
2011-03-03T06:16:00.000Z	nsd	sec^nd	If gparted fails, the installer can't continue. You might try partioning with another program (though I doubt that'd help) or another flash drive
2011-03-03T06:16:00.000Z	sec^nd	nsd	doesn't work, seems to be a problem with the live system being on a flash drive
