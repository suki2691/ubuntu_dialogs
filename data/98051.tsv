2011-06-05T08:06:00.000Z	jonholio		Hello, I have a very simple question. Can anyone tell me why I can't use ctrl-q to quit applications when using 11.04?
2011-06-05T08:06:00.000Z	izinucs	jonholio	try alt+F4
2011-06-05T08:08:00.000Z	jonholio	izinucs	yep I know that works ok, but is a bit awkward compared to  ctrl-q
2011-06-05T08:08:00.000Z	izinucs	jonholio	never used that combo myself.. so I never got use to it.
