2006-02-26T11:57:00.000Z	KRA		Hi, ubuntu noob here, I'm trying Ubuntu for the first time (the Dapper Drake) And somehow I made a mistake and ended up with edubuntu rather than ubuntu, are there any mayor differences, I'm thinking like what packages are awailable, what I am allowed to do etc... or is it the same system with some extra packages and other icons/wallpaper etc..
2006-02-26T11:58:00.000Z	LjL	KRA	aha, yeah, there are differences :) but just in the way of what packages are installed. you can changed that
2006-02-26T11:58:00.000Z	LjL	KRA	just install the "ubuntu-desktop" package and you'll have the full ubuntu, *plus* what's included in edubuntu and not in ubuntu
2006-02-26T11:59:00.000Z	LjL	KRA	if you want to remove the edubuntu-specific parts, well, i guess you need a package listing from someone with a fresh ubuntu install...
