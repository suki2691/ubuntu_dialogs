2008-01-28T05:47:00.000Z	shachaf		Question: I want to download the whole Ubuntu APT repository, to install on several offline computers.
2008-01-28T05:47:00.000Z	shachaf		Is there a standard/best way of doing that?
2008-01-28T05:48:00.000Z	shachaf		(Especially with minimal trouble on the computers to install on?)
2008-01-28T05:48:00.000Z	danbhfive	shachaf	why do you want the WHOLE apt repo?  isnt it like 20gig?
