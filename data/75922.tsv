2008-11-23T06:54:00.000Z	M4rotku		 hello, i'm trying to upgrade from 8.04 to 8.10.  In the second step, "Setting new software channels," the fetching file process is frozen at "fetching file 18 of 40" and it has been frozen there for about 50 minutes or so.  I tried restarting the process and it still freezes in the same exact spot.  Can anyone help me with this?
