2012-09-28T23:12:00.000Z	trism	Cong	depends on the package, most of them have html you could just load up in a web browser, some of the gtk/glib related stuff you can use devhelp to view them (otherwise, dpkg -L package_name; and see what is there)
2012-09-28T23:15:00.000Z	Cong	trism	OK, dpkg -L doc, got it!
