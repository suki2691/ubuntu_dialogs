2008-12-06T06:01:00.000Z	Scunizi	tesseracter	if your using the graphical interface and "dragging" the partition boarders around, you have one that is on top of another partition..
2008-12-06T06:03:00.000Z	tesseracter	Scunizi	nope. no dragging. but i figured it out. turns out i needed to create a msdos partition table first
2008-12-06T06:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	tesseracter	ah.. ok..
