2011-10-16T00:36:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	s5fs	Your search path for Alt+F2 is defined by your global PATH variable
2011-10-16T00:40:00.000Z	s5fs	Stereocaulon	I have symlinks to shorten app names (ie, gt = gnome-terminal) in /usr/local/bin (which is in my PATH) but I cannot launch them with Alt+F2. This did work in 11.04, any ideas?
2011-10-16T00:41:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	s5fs	no, sorry about that, I am no expert on Oneiric. Only using it since yesterday.
