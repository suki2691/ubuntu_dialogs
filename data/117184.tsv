2010-01-09T21:10:00.000Z	aryr100		can anyone give me a good link to fix grub2 on 9.10 to show slackware 13 ?
2010-01-09T21:12:00.000Z	gandhijee	aryr100	is slackware on a diff partition?
2010-01-09T21:12:00.000Z	gandhijee	aryr100	and the grub in 9.10 seems kinda funky
2010-01-09T21:16:00.000Z	gandhijee	aryr100	why not add it in by hand?
