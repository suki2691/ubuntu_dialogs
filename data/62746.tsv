2012-05-18T15:08:00.000Z	JPeterso2		why is the 12.04 subversion package 1.6?
2012-05-18T15:08:00.000Z	JPeterso2		you got a problem with 1.7?
2012-05-18T15:09:00.000Z	iceroot	JPeterso2	mostly because debian is using 1.6
2012-05-18T15:10:00.000Z	iceroot	JPeterso2	and its easier to use already existing packages instead of maintaining a new package
