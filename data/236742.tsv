2006-08-07T09:47:00.000Z	minerale		Now this is a stupid question, but can't I have both ubuntu and kubuntu? I mean, install both packages and just select between ubuntu / kubuntu at login ?
2006-08-07T09:48:00.000Z	nalioth	minerale	you certainly can do that
2006-08-07T09:48:00.000Z	minerale	wweasel	nalioth: then why are they not together in one cd? (and what is the package I need to install for KDE? apt-get install kde? )
2006-08-07T09:49:00.000Z	nalioth	minerale	kubuntu-desktop will get you kde and all the trimmings
