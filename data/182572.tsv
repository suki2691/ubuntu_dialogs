2006-12-13T12:20:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		does that mean it's out of sync?
2006-12-13T12:21:00.000Z	ToHellWithGA		it's happened before in dapper and edgy and usually resolved itself.  today i'd like to better understand why sometimes there are MD5Sum mismatches
2006-12-13T12:21:00.000Z	avis	ToHellWithGA	it means that its checking the file against some hash and its not giving you the correct hash in response for parity reasons ?  i can't explain
