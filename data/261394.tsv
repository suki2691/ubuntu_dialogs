2004-11-20T10:45:00.000Z	torpor		i just want to know if hoary is the latest or if warty is?  which should i be running if i want the latest and greatest?
2004-11-20T10:45:00.000Z	torpor		this means there are bugs and problems then right?
2004-11-20T10:46:00.000Z	torpor		i guess i should just be happy with a stable linux to run on my powerbook ..
2004-11-20T10:46:00.000Z	georgia	torpor	warty is stable, hoary is the testing one, bleeding edge kinda stuff, not guaranteed to work properly though (as far as i nunderstand it)
