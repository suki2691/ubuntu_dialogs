2011-02-17T00:54:00.000Z	Joseph_		I am attempting to install ubuntu 10,10 on my macbook.  I have followed the instructions for installation (created a partition, installed rEFIt) but whenever I try to load Ubuntu from the live CD i get a black screen after the first splash.  I tried moving to the text based installer, but i get the same results after selecting "install ubuntu".  the disc and memory checks both passed tests.  Does anyone have any help to offer?
