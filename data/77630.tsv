2008-10-09T00:17:00.000Z	Slart	_snoopin_	I think so, yes.. I don't think squid needs to be restarted.
2008-10-09T00:18:00.000Z	_snoopin_	Slart	i've tried that before. but when i login to ebox, the cache is grayed. and i can't manage the squid
2008-10-09T00:19:00.000Z	Slart	_snoopin_	might be something else that is wrong then.. or I've misunderstood how ebox works. I've only tried it once or twice
