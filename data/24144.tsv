2011-01-07T09:54:00.000Z	Atomos		my netbook has been having serious issues such as locking up on shutdown, and the touchpad not staying off. now it wont boot into the ubuntu I installed, or let me reinstall it
2011-01-07T09:54:00.000Z	KM0201	Atomos	won't let you reinstall? that sounds hardware related
2011-01-07T10:24:00.000Z	KM0201	Atomos	of course, ubuntu.com
2011-01-07T10:25:00.000Z	KM0201	Atomos	then you're not paying attention  :)
