2008-12-05T20:55:00.000Z	a1len		Is it possible to change permissions for wine applications? How do I do it?
2008-12-05T20:57:00.000Z	a1len		I'm getting an error when I'm trying to run a program in wine that says '''failed adding SE_LOCK_MEMORY''' then it tells me to go to control panel and change something... but I have no control panel because this isn't windows.
2008-12-05T20:58:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	a1len	might be best to ask in #wine. Sounds like quite an obscure problem.
2008-12-05T20:58:00.000Z	a1len	SlimeyPete	Alright! Thanks.
