2010-06-14T00:43:00.000Z	underdev		hi!  I tried using the Places->Connect to server for the first time.  I can connect to my ftp server, but instead of opening a folder, it opens a tab in firefox.  Is there anyway I can open it as a folder to simplify transfering files?
2010-06-14T00:45:00.000Z	underdev		it would be great to integrate ftp into the desktop

2010-06-14T00:46:00.000Z	underdev	Pr3nt1c3	ty.  I can use a ftp client, i know, but i was hoping to integrate it into the desktop.  I assumed that was what places->connect to server was for, but i guess not.  fooey.
