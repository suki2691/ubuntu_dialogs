2007-04-19T09:53:00.000Z	psst		I want to use my ubuntu machine as a gateway, but only to a subnet it can reach via a VPN client
2007-04-19T09:54:00.000Z	psst		can anyone suggest how I get started?
2007-04-19T09:55:00.000Z	TuTuFF	psst	exactly as you would normally except instead of having a default route out the external interface, just route to the subnet the other end of the vpn has
2007-04-19T09:57:00.000Z	psst	TuTuFF	I don't know how to do the 'normal' gateway either
