2009-09-01T17:21:00.000Z	Trijntje		Hi all. In applications -> add software there is a star rating for each packet. is this rating based on the use of the application or the number of installs?
2009-09-01T17:22:00.000Z	jef_	Trijntje	I think it's the number of installs
2009-09-01T17:22:00.000Z	jef_	Trijntje	but it's not enables by default i believe?
2009-09-01T17:23:00.000Z	Trijntje	jef_	true, but i'm helping translate ubuntu in my native language, and its better to do the popular apps first.
