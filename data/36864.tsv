2010-04-27T05:41:00.000Z	Typos_King	Scunizi	  is't Sane a frontend for it?
2010-04-27T05:42:00.000Z	Scunizi	Typos_King	probably.. although the header line at the top says xsane so it might be reversed.. but I have that gui up and running.. I just want to scan a smaller area then a letter sized piece of paper
