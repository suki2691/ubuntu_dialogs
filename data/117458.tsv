2007-10-09T11:16:00.000Z	whileimhere		Hi. A few times a week randomly my laptop stops dead. When it does the numb lock and the caps lock lights will flash and the computer will need to be unplugged and the batter removed for me to reset and reboot the laptop. Anyone have any idea what happened? I even turned off the power saving features thinking that was part of the issue.
