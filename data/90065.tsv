2008-05-21T05:14:00.000Z	tanath	woli	might try #python
2008-05-21T05:17:00.000Z	tanath	woli	you're prolly best off looking for help with python in the #python channel
2008-05-21T05:18:00.000Z	woli	tanath	sorry for double-asking, but I told you that they refered me this channel on #python, because nobody claimed to know how to do it
