2007-08-30T14:28:00.000Z	nachtkrab		hi there! I'm trying to get a ssh tunnel to a server. the tunnel itself opens but when I try to use the tunnel i always get the following msg:  channel 3: open failed: connect failed: Connection refused
2007-08-30T14:29:00.000Z	nachtkrab		under fedora core it works fine
2007-08-30T14:29:00.000Z	nachtkrab		is there any standard firewall running on ubuntu?
2007-08-30T14:29:00.000Z	rockets	nachtkrab	no, but all ports are closed by default
