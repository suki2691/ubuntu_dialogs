2005-05-07T06:06:00.000Z	Janux		Hi, I have a question, does RamDisk mean that I mount a partition to my RAM?
2005-05-07T06:06:00.000Z	GoneBoB	Janux	basically, yes
2005-05-07T06:08:00.000Z	Janux	GoneBoB	Then if I have a my database installed on /opt/MySQL/db.db, if I mount this partition /opt to RAM, it is supposedly loading much much faster, right?
2005-05-07T06:08:00.000Z	GoneBoB	Janux	it's a lot more complicated than that
