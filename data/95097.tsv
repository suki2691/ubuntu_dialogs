2008-11-25T09:15:00.000Z	lwizardl		this question is kinda off topic but i figured someone here would know the answer. I know they have different types of motherboard styles like atx, etc but does server boards come in different sizes also ?
2008-11-25T09:15:00.000Z	lwizardl		or are they all one type
