2007-08-01T13:57:00.000Z	scorp123	echosystm	Ubuntu Server gives you a server system, e.g. no GUI, no bloat. Alternate installs a desktop just like the live CD would.
2007-08-01T13:58:00.000Z	echosystm	scorp123	if i were to install a "text mode system" from the alt cd, would it be the same as a server system?
2007-08-01T14:00:00.000Z	scorp123	echosystm	there would still be some differences; Ubuntu Server doesn't ship with some packages and just installs a bare minimum of sorts to get your server installation going ....
