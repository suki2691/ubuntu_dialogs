2011-08-10T09:26:00.000Z	MalelDraconis	pp7	when I tried command "ffmpeg -i blah.wma blah.mp3" it gave an error output of: "Unsupported codec for output stream #0.0"...  I made sure it was the most current version before passing the command...  Any ideas?
2011-08-10T09:27:00.000Z	pp7	MalelDraconis	hmm, install all codecs you can possibly find
2011-08-10T09:27:00.000Z	pp7	MalelDraconis	search for codec in software center
