2009-07-22T23:48:00.000Z	Andorin		I've had a problem for a while with my keyboard shortcuts. I ask for anyone who knows about them to look at this thread- and please actually read the OP. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1214508
2009-07-22T23:50:00.000Z	Andorin		If I were to install, say, KDE, could I go back to the terminal and reinstall GNOME and have no trouble?
2009-07-22T23:51:00.000Z	Andorin		I see, thx.
