2012-05-18T16:10:00.000Z	[yates]		Hi, does anyone know why there is no image file and only headers located here, http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.4-rc7-precise/  ?
2012-05-18T16:12:00.000Z	[yates]		someone from canonical asked me to test the latest upstream kernel for an ongoing kernel bug, he said 3.4-rc7 however there is no image so im a bit confused now
2012-05-18T16:13:00.000Z	OerHeks	[yates]	then ask 'someone from canonical" again?
2012-05-18T16:15:00.000Z	OerHeks	[yates]	it is only available in QQ 12.04
