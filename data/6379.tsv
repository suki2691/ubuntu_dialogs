2012-01-19T10:56:00.000Z	rodayo_		Me again, I successfuly created a new partition where windows should go. Does anyone know how to create a bootable usb (like a live usb, not sure what the proper terminology is) from a windows iso? (the iso contains the installer, not a system image)
2012-01-19T10:57:00.000Z	rodayo_		On a side note, I also have windows running on virtualbox. Is it possible to create a system image from this and copy that straight onto the new partition?

2012-01-19T10:57:00.000Z	rodayo_	bullgard6	I did, no one knew a sure fire method for it surprisingly
