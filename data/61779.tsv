2009-04-16T22:17:00.000Z	Julius		I've just made a BIG mistake with the "dd" command... Does someone know if there's a tool or something to recover files after using "dd" on a wrong external drive ? :/

2009-04-16T22:18:00.000Z	Julius	grawity	i'm pretty sure I won't find a way to do that by myself but I was just asking... thanks indeed :(
