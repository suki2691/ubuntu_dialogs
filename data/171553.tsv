2006-08-09T13:31:00.000Z	DarkPhantom		I'm trying to find some kind of a web interface for managing packages, services, and possibly more .. does anyone know of something that works well with ubuntu?
2006-08-09T13:32:00.000Z	harisund	DarkPhantom	I don't know about a web interface. Synaptic works pretty well. Any particular reason you are looking for a web-only interface?
2006-08-09T13:35:00.000Z	DarkPhantom	harisund	well .. its a headless server .. easier if I can do it through http ..
2006-08-09T13:35:00.000Z	harisund	DarkPhantom	ah ok ... personally I prefer the command line, but yeah http would be easier indeed..
