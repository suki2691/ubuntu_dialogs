2006-10-17T11:06:00.000Z	frank_b		can anyone recomend me a set of tcp and udp ports alternative to the defaults, so that I can run two amule clients at the same time?
2006-10-17T11:06:00.000Z	talisein	frank_b	any random port >1000 should be fine
2006-10-17T11:06:00.000Z	frank_b	talisein	hmm, ok thanks
2006-10-17T11:12:00.000Z	talisein	frank_b	yes
