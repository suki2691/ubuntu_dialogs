2011-05-12T02:49:00.000Z	blip-		hi, I installed ubuntu 11.04 and it came with 2.6.38-8 kernel, my wireless card (Realtek RTL8188CE) doesn't work - strange I read on the forums that someone with the same card had it work when he upgrade to 11.04.   Are there any special or newer kernels I need for this driver ?
2011-05-12T02:49:00.000Z	blip-		or should I instlal the driver from source manually
