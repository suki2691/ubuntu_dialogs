2007-10-24T06:21:00.000Z	Dan_L		Dumb question:  I'm a complete n00b.  Should I even screw around with this text installer?  Or should I give up on the Linux thing?
2007-10-24T06:22:00.000Z	qman	Dan_L	the alternate install CD is fairly simple
2007-10-24T06:22:00.000Z	qman	Dan_L	it's all menu based
2007-10-24T06:22:00.000Z	qman	Dan_L	it just doesn't have X running
