2007-12-11T04:25:00.000Z	Vadi		What is the command to rename my username?
2007-12-11T04:26:00.000Z	LjL	Vadi	i don't think there is one
2007-12-11T04:26:00.000Z	Vadi	LjL	I'm pretty sure ther eis one... I remember helping out with it before
2007-12-11T04:27:00.000Z	LjL	Vadi	i "think" that just changing the name in /etc/passwd and /etc/group, and renaming the directory in /home, should do it, but i can hardly guarantee that's safe or enough
