2007-05-31T05:38:00.000Z	Colossus		Hey; I'm having trouble installing Ubuntu on my laptop. When I install, it hangs at 15% when it's "Detecting file systems" ... I've had issues with that sort of thing before because it always tries to find a floppy drive, which my laptop doesn't have.
2007-05-31T05:39:00.000Z	Colossus		I'll try that, then. Thanks
2007-05-31T05:39:00.000Z	Flannel	Colossus	yeah.  releases.ubuntu.com get the alternate ISO
2007-05-31T05:40:00.000Z	Colossus	Flannel	thank you.
