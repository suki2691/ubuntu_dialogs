2007-09-29T10:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	pipegeek	its ok for me, but i definitely wouldn't upgrade yet
2007-09-29T10:35:00.000Z	pipegeek	IndyGunFreak	Should I avoid apt-get dist-upgrade as an upgrade mechanism in general in ubuntu?  That's broken for me every time, warty -> hoary -> breezy -> feisty
2007-09-29T10:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	pipegeek	well, breezy--- Feisty, i can see why.
