2011-12-05T23:20:00.000Z	Hexxeh		Hi, I've got some technical questions regarding Wubi/Lubi, is there a more appropriate channel I can talk in than here?
2011-12-05T23:21:00.000Z	Hexxeh		Okay so basically I'd like to use the Wubi bootloader system to boot another OS, but it appears that Wubi uses a loop-mounted ISO image to boot, am I correct? I'd need to boot from a hard disk image, is this possible?
2011-12-05T23:22:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Hexxeh	why are you using wubi? can you use a proper ubuntu install instead?
2011-12-05T23:22:00.000Z	Hexxeh	ThinkT510	I'm trying to build a Wubi installer for Chromium OS.
