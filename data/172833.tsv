2007-09-04T11:58:00.000Z	Vlet	pteague	you can also configure samba and nfs to use pam authentication
2007-09-04T11:58:00.000Z	Vlet	pteague	which means they would use whatever passwords are set for each user
2007-09-04T12:00:00.000Z	Vlet	pteague	yeah, I'm fairly certain it will, and it would be a lot easier than setting up an ldap server just for that... you'll have to look into the docs for the samba and nfs configs
