But it doesn't  connect to the Internet until you are logged into a gnome session. So ssh would not be much help.
2010-12-22T12:47:00.000Z	bonjoyee	pushaman	what kind of internet connection?
2010-12-22T12:47:00.000Z	pushaman	bonjoyee	it is what my campus provides, so a simple Ethernet with a unique ip address
