2008-01-20T09:56:00.000Z	bullgard4		English help wanted. After switching on my Ubuntu 7.10, it shows a lot of status messages before the log-in screen appears. How does Ubuntu call these messages? I googled for 'start messages' but could not get a good confirmation for this assumption. How are they called in English?
