2006-12-10T14:23:00.000Z	kupesoft		I've got an enclosure for an external drive (USB and eSATA interfaces) and a brand new, blank,drive (250gb).  What type of filesystem should I format it as for maximum portability (win32, linux, os/x, freebsd)?
2006-12-10T14:23:00.000Z	kupesoft		does fat32 support large filesystems?
2006-12-10T14:24:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	kupesoft	no (and yes)
2006-12-10T14:25:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	kupesoft	yes
