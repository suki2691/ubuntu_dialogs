2006-10-01T05:18:00.000Z	_georgjungle_		again for the about 686vs386 discussion
2006-10-01T05:19:00.000Z	_georgjungle_		i know that the 686 kernel is installable by a simple apt-get
2006-10-01T05:19:00.000Z	_georgjungle_		but not with nvidia drivers
2006-10-01T05:19:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	_georgjungle_	what do you want to discuss? If its not support related (as in, I want to install it) -- please take it to #ubuntu-offtopic
