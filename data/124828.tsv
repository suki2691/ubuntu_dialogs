2010-05-04T09:50:00.000Z	mclark1129		I am having trouble with WPA2 Personal encryption on my router authenticating me.  What does it mean when it says wpa_supplicant[822]: Association request to the driver failed in the syslog?
2010-05-04T09:50:00.000Z	mclark1129		I am using the right password, and sometimes it works just fine, other times it times out and gives this message.
2010-05-04T09:50:00.000Z	pvl1	mclark1129	did u install wpa_supplicant yourself or what
2010-05-04T09:50:00.000Z	pvl1	mclark1129	oh what about your driver then
