2010-10-10T15:46:00.000Z	Guest25203		morning all, I have a problem where as soon as I click the login button in 10.04 I just get a blank screen. I can use ctrl-alt-f2 to get a term and have noticed that I don't have an xorg.conf, :(  Is it possible to generate one?
2010-10-10T15:48:00.000Z	Guest25203		can ubu10.10 be installed from the terminal? maybe that will help with my problem..
