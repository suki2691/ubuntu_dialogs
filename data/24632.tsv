2011-02-04T18:38:00.000Z	appleseed		Upgraded RAM from 8GB to 16GB, also upgraded SWAP from 8GB to 40GB (shouldn't matter), but now SUSPEND to RAM doesn't want to work, please any ideas?
2011-02-04T18:40:00.000Z	rigved	appleseed	how exactly did you upgrade swap from 8 GB to 40 GB? is it one continuous partition?
