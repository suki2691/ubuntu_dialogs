2008-03-02T10:09:00.000Z	Mega_byte		hi, I installed wubi (ubuntu 7.04) everything was fine, but now when I boot it says /bin/sh: can't acces tty: job control turned off and won't let me login... what could cause this?

2008-03-02T10:10:00.000Z	Mega_byte	Jack_Sparrow	Wubi is Ubuntu 7.04, so this problem should be same
2008-03-02T10:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Mega_byte	NO it isnt the same as a regular install
