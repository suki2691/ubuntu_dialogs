2007-12-08T12:47:00.000Z	Lore2		I've found some annoying bugs and I don't wanna wait around for someone else to fix it, how would I go about fixing them myself, i'm a semi decent programmer however I've very limited experience in a *nix environment. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
2007-12-08T12:48:00.000Z	Lore2		Where should I start if I want to fix bugs in ubuntu?
2007-12-08T12:50:00.000Z	Lore2		i've found a ton, I just don't know how to go about fixing them. I've programmed in windows but I've no experience in linux. And I really don't wanna wait for someone else to fix them.
