2009-10-24T05:39:00.000Z	afeijo		I setup a virtual ubuntu to be my web server, everytime I run it, I have to login, and run sudo dhclient to get ip from my router :( what can I do to automatize it?
2009-10-24T05:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	afeijo	set up /etc/network/interfaces
2009-10-24T05:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	afeijo	two lines would be enough 1) auto eth0 2) iface eth0 inet dhcp
2009-10-24T05:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	afeijo	given that eth0 is the interface you want to be configured
