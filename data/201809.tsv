2010-09-20T06:30:00.000Z	RandBrittain		Hm, I reinstalled 10.04.1 yesterday to clear up the problems I had when the new kernel headers broke fglrx. Now, in the new installation, I can't get World of Warcraft to load in Wine. It was working perfectly before. Why would that happen?
2010-09-20T06:32:00.000Z	RandBrittain		Also, how is it that you invoke paths in the command line where a folder name includes spaces?
2010-09-20T06:33:00.000Z	RandBrittain		There is, but the new kernel headers break it, as well as the fglrx from x-swat.
