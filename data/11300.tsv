2011-10-26T22:01:00.000Z	auronandace	racho	do you have a support question?
2011-10-26T22:02:00.000Z	racho	auronandace	no as i don't use ubuntu but as it is linux i try to help other ppl using it.. and sry for the long personal opinion on unity
2011-10-27T14:10:00.000Z	auronandace	racho	true but then you won't get support
