2009-12-12T16:41:00.000Z	mmaksimov		Hi. I've set the gnome panel to autohide (only one is active, I've got very small primary display), but suddenly it is refusing to hide. Playing with panel properties does not help. I think a logoff may help, but I don't want to. Any other suggestions? I'm running ubuntu 9.10.
