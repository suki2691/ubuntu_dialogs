2008-09-25T06:34:00.000Z	ryan__		I am tring to install a linux driver from nvidia.  There directions say to do this "Type "sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-173.14.12-pkg1.run" to install the driver. NVIDIA now provides a utility to assist".  But that fails.  Any help.

2008-09-25T06:37:00.000Z	pedro-orange	ryan__	System > Admin > hardware drivers. Try doing it through there before installing something from the nvidia site
