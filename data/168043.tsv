2006-09-11T09:02:00.000Z	kendals	bluescreen	i also have that logitech headset.
2006-09-11T09:09:00.000Z	bluescreen	kendals	i found a solution but then i have the problem that i have this nvidia onboard card , the audiogy card i use and the usb headset. Can i use my headset for recording and playing sound on the audigy at the same time?
