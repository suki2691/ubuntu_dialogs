2012-03-03T22:18:00.000Z	happyfac1		I installed gnome 3, but the window controls are messed up, there's only an "X" to close and it looks wrong
2012-03-03T22:19:00.000Z	theadmin	happyfac1	That's the standard gnome3 window behaviour.
2012-03-03T22:20:00.000Z	happyfac1	theadmin	faissal: the "x" doesn't looks like it's the right png image or something, it's using the unity theme I think. How do I change the theme?
