2010-09-06T08:09:00.000Z	bsmith093		if i have an avi file that should be one but is actually two files can i just join them together with something like lxsplit? will that work to play the complete file?
2010-09-06T08:11:00.000Z	bsmith093		so anyway joining avi file will that work or is there something else i have to do to ensure the whole file will be played
