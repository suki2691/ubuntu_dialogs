2011-02-07T22:25:00.000Z	corinth		Hey #ubuntu. I'm trying to mount my windows volume, but it returns "Mount is denied because the NTFS volume is already exclusively opened."
2011-02-07T22:26:00.000Z	BonevG	corinth	check /media/ for already mounted partition
2011-02-07T22:27:00.000Z	corinth	BonevG	nothing shows being mounted there
2011-02-07T22:27:00.000Z	BonevG	corinth	 mount -l
