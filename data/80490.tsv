2010-03-09T18:57:00.000Z	stetho		Hi. Can anyone suggest why I can't get Perl on an Ubuntu server to connect to the local MySQL database - Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' where it works for PHP and from the command line. I've set apparmor to complain.

2010-03-09T18:59:00.000Z	stetho	coz_	thanks but I asked here first as it looks like an Ubuntu issue. Works fine on Fedora.
2010-03-09T19:00:00.000Z	coz_	stetho	 mm interesting  but I would still go to ##linux at some point if it cant be resolved here :)
