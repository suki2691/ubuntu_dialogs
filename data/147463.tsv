2007-01-29T11:37:00.000Z	RancidLM		is there a way to fix this?
2007-01-29T11:38:00.000Z	Naurd	RancidLM	: you have to enable Xinerama in xorg or press the function key that change the monitor setting on your laptop (if it is a laptop)
2007-01-29T11:39:00.000Z	RancidLM	Naurd	i have twinview enabled and both displays come up for gdm but it goes back to a single display when gnome loads
