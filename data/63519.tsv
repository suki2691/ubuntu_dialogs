2009-08-19T09:45:00.000Z	losher	Ozzah	the list of packages you installed should be in  /var/log/dpkg.log in chronological order, if that helps...
2009-08-19T09:45:00.000Z	Ozzah	losher	lol, thanks :)
2009-08-19T09:47:00.000Z	losher	Ozzah	egrep installed | /var/log/dpkg.log    Of course, remove them in reverse order...
