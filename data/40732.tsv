2010-10-29T13:06:00.000Z	Aemaeth		I'm trying to install a .deb via cli (it's saved on my /home/Downloads/) and i tried dpkg -i filename.deb  but it came up with a bunch of dependency errors that were normally downloaded using the gui package installer, how do i get those dependencies installed as well?

2010-10-29T13:09:00.000Z	vdubhack	Aemaeth	no clue on that one
2010-10-29T13:12:00.000Z	Aemaeth	vdubhack	well, i'm going down to the machine then with a monitor,  i try to avoid it because there's a sign that says "Beware of the Leopard!" and the door is nailed shut
