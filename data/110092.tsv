2009-11-16T14:20:00.000Z	bcj		How do I change my GDM log-in screen?  I've installed a new theme from the repo's, but when I run gdmsetup (either from the command line or menu) I only get the chance to change default user - nothing about themes.

2009-11-16T14:22:00.000Z	soreau	bcj	Since gdm has been restructured, I don't think there is a way to change themes through gdmsetup any longer
2009-11-16T14:25:00.000Z	soreau	bcj	Because gdm is being restructured so with the current implementation, it is not possible
