2011-10-07T18:45:00.000Z	Ellipsis753		How can I have ubuntu do a fsck check on reboot when the filesystem is read-only and therefore I can't use touch /forcefsck?
2011-10-07T18:45:00.000Z	wcchandler	Ellipsis753	you can remount with RW to that specific file
2011-10-07T18:46:00.000Z	wcchandler	Ellipsis753	--bind under mount
2011-10-07T18:46:00.000Z	Ellipsis753	wcchandler	what would the command be?
