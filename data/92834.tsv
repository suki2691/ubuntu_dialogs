2008-05-27T05:07:00.000Z	Ademan		can firefox 3 read from gvfs volumes like ff2 used to?
2008-05-27T05:08:00.000Z	fde	Ademan	sure
2008-05-27T05:08:00.000Z	fde	Ademan	FF2 never could read gvfs though... that is why most Gnome based distro's switched to FF3, it actually supports it... FF2 uses Gnome-VFS
2008-05-27T05:09:00.000Z	Ademan	fde	ah, yeah, i forgot about that whole switch
