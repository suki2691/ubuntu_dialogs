2011-12-30T03:17:00.000Z	dr_willis		some laptops make it very hard to actually use sysreq
2011-12-30T03:19:00.000Z	dr_willis		i normally can get to a console with alt-ctrl-f1, rarely recall using alt-sysreq-r
2011-12-30T03:20:00.000Z	graft	dr_willis	yeah, alt-sysrq-r is only in cases where X stops recognizing keyboard input for whatever reason
