2009-01-10T22:19:00.000Z	dirkheine		I installed Ubuntu 8.10 at my HP mini-note, I completed the ubuntu wiki and all works fine, except for one thing, I can't set the resolution while, according to the Howto I should. Now it's 640x480 instead of the standard 1280x768, which is extremely annoying. What can I do to fix this?
2009-01-10T22:20:00.000Z	dirkheine		in the window to change it I can only choose 640x480
