2006-06-04T05:52:00.000Z	lamp420		can someone give me some advice on what the most "appropriate" (to ubuntu) way of upgrading applications without the package manager?  I want to have the latest versions of thunderbird and firefox!...but I'd rather not break anything more than I need to.  I'm trying to find a better way than just uninstalling thunderbird and reinstalling it without a .deb, etc
2006-06-04T05:54:00.000Z	lamp420		grufle: can't you set that w/ mount?
2006-06-04T05:55:00.000Z	Grufle	lamp420	probably, but that's not a fix, just a workaround... I want to keep the automount feature
