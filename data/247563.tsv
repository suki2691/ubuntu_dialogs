2005-02-22T13:12:00.000Z	priest		isn't the nvidiadriver precompiled for k7-image?
2005-02-22T13:12:00.000Z	randabis	priest	it's i386 for compatibility I believe
2005-02-22T13:14:00.000Z	priest	randabis	is there any performence loss to use the 386 image on a amd xp?
2005-02-22T13:15:00.000Z	randabis	priest	well, maybe just a little bit, but it's probably negligible...I know my 3d in gentoo is slightly faster than in ubuntu...but that's probably because everything is optimized for my processor
