2011-05-24T02:18:00.000Z	schwiz2010		is there any way I can access and backup my files from the Desktop from a livecd?  The desktop is installed on a regular disc

2011-05-24T02:20:00.000Z	schwiz2010	MonkeyDust	I have mounted the installed partition but I don't have access to my user files they are hidden.  In /usr  I don't see my stuff
2011-05-24T02:22:00.000Z	schwiz2010	MonkeyDust	ok I found it but a ton of my files it says I don't have permission to read them while I try to copy
