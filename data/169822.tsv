2007-12-03T06:39:00.000Z	vn		hi, I'm trying to setup compiz (I'm not sure if I use fglrx or not) and I followed a tutorial, at the end, I tried to log in after a reboot and it did nothing for 10s and then I have a black screen and it comes back to the login screen...what may be the cause?
2007-12-03T06:40:00.000Z	vn		maybe I have something to configure in xorg.conf or...?
2007-12-03T06:41:00.000Z	vn		I have an ATI card, should I use fglrx?
