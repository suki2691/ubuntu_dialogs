2011-03-23T17:01:00.000Z	dnivra	willy_1977	actually I was asked to do the compiling process since I would like to work on amarok i.e. do amarok development. that is why. sure I know how install it otherwise :).
2011-03-23T17:01:00.000Z	willy_1977	dnivra	ok, just wanted to make sure ;)
2011-03-23T17:01:00.000Z	dnivra	willy_1977	sure thing! thanks :).
