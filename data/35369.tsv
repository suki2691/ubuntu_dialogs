2010-04-17T18:42:00.000Z	richard123		Hi, I am trying to compile a file but the command ./configure gives me : bash: ./configure: No such file or directory
2010-04-17T18:43:00.000Z	richard123		but the configure file exists.
2010-04-17T18:43:00.000Z	gottto	richard123	or you're in the wrong dir
2010-04-17T18:47:00.000Z	gottto	richard123	if you do   ls   does configure show up?
