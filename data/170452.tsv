2011-08-22T03:59:00.000Z	Guest12947		Good evening!  (or good morning, etc, depending on where you are!)   I'm wondering who/where to ask about getting help with a samba problem?
2011-08-22T04:00:00.000Z	Guest12947		I tried to... but have to admit I've forgotten most of my IRC skills from a decade ago.
