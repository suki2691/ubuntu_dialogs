2009-09-04T21:39:00.000Z	Terabyte		Hi, i have a single 2tb hard drive partitioned with (swap space) + 20gb ext3, the remaining space is ntfs. ntfs is empty no files, but i need to extend ext3 by 40gb. is that possible from linux?
2009-09-04T21:40:00.000Z	Terabyte		essentially i want to grow the ext3 by 20gb, and shrink the ntfs by 20gb
