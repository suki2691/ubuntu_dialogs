2006-01-16T11:18:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	glguy	Whatever suits your fancy; the type of stream should be possible in pretty much anything.
2006-01-16T11:18:00.000Z	glguy	tonyyarusso	what about in the default install?
2006-01-16T11:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	glguy	All of those three are restricted formats, and not possible by default.
