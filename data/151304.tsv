2007-08-07T15:11:00.000Z	kauer		why do people add underscores to their names? Serious question...
2007-08-07T15:13:00.000Z	soundray	kauer	many IRC programs try 'yourchoicenick' first, and 'yourchoicenick_' second if the first is already in use.

2008-03-17T04:06:00.000Z	kauer	soundray	Thanks, but $$ is the PID of the currently executing shell. The more I read about $! the more I'm convinced I'm doing something wrong :-) it looks like exactly what I want.
