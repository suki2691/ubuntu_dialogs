2009-03-21T16:12:00.000Z	maxb	Jabka	I'm not sure ntfs-3g can do any fixing/checking - I think it just tells you to check the drive in Windows if it's marked dirty
2009-03-21T16:13:00.000Z	Jabka	maxb	, accourding to the source it can clean it (-olocale=en_US.UTF-8,force,auto_xattr,defer_auth,defer_permissions,volname="NTFS" )
