2008-04-27T15:06:00.000Z	mfabbri		hi, did anyone switch back to firefox-2 as default browser?
2008-04-27T15:06:00.000Z	richardprice	mfabbri	i'm thinking about it, as ff3 is dying
2008-04-27T15:07:00.000Z	mfabbri	tkooda	because i have a bunch of extensions i rely on which are not compatible with ff3
2008-04-27T15:07:00.000Z	richardprice	mfabbri	the extensions will be available soon, devs just playing catchup
