2008-09-14T09:18:00.000Z	xess		Howdy I need an alternate way to install ubuntu (studio). I have two hard drives one which I can store the iso on. IS there any way that I can install to my primary from my secondary?
2008-09-14T09:18:00.000Z	Gnea	xess	without burning the iso to a cd?
2008-09-14T09:19:00.000Z	xess	Gnea	yeah. I do not have a DVD burner.
2008-09-23T11:45:00.000Z	Gnea	xess	run the install.exe
