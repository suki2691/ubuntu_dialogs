2007-03-31T08:08:00.000Z	kbidd	mischko	yes, but you should use packages designed for 6.10 if at all possible
2007-03-31T08:09:00.000Z	mischko	kbidd	the package for Ubuntu is rather dated (pgadmin).  The Pgadmin web site has repositories for Sarge, Etch, and Sid with up-to-date packages.
2007-03-31T08:10:00.000Z	kbidd	mischko	yeah, obviously its better if you can find a 6.10 package, but in cases like yours other versions *should* work as well.
