2006-09-04T10:44:00.000Z	gonniff		is there anyway to make a remote desktop connection *to* an ubuntu machine from XP other than VNC?
2006-09-04T10:45:00.000Z	clearzen	gonniff	yes use putty (ie ssh)
2006-09-04T10:45:00.000Z	gonniff	clearzen	but that won't give me the desktop, will it? I thought that only gives a console connection
