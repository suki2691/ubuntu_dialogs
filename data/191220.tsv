2010-05-02T08:16:00.000Z	juanca		 I've upgraded to 10.04 but I can't make my wireless conection work... It says I'm connected but just 80% (?).. i think this may be related to a text file i've added two lines to (eth1.. and something else) to make the connection work in 9.10... but i can't remember what was the name of that file
