2010-06-23T05:40:00.000Z	Random832	Scunizi	if it's anything like old modems, put in a comma
2010-06-23T05:40:00.000Z	Scunizi	Random832	yea.. either that or a comma
2012-11-11T07:48:00.000Z	Scunizi	Random832	ok.. I see sda1 is ext4 and sda3 is /home .. I can't really identify where /swap is unless it's labeled something different..
