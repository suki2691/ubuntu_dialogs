2011-12-14T14:29:00.000Z	k_sze		I'm trying to `fsck -cpv` my 2TB HDD. It's been running for quite a long time. How can I be sure that it's not stuck due to some unrecoverable hardware or file system error?

2011-12-14T14:33:00.000Z	RaTTuS	k_sze	- as long as the HD light is running then your fine [fingers x'ed]
