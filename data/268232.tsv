2004-09-19T15:48:00.000Z	Oskuro	debianist	but is that remembered the next time you log in?
2004-09-19T15:48:00.000Z	Oskuro	debianist	and doesn't work for all users I guess
2004-09-19T15:50:00.000Z	debianist	Oskuro	: yes it does, for the other folks - it's ok to use the highest reolution possible, just make the virutal desktop use the same size :)
