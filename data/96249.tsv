2008-08-26T02:24:00.000Z	CorbinFox		i'm taking a computer science course for C++, but don't know what program to use in linux for the actual coding and compiling.  help?
2008-08-26T02:25:00.000Z	NDPMacBook	CorbinFox	To write the code you'll need a text editor. Asking which one is best will start a war. And to compile you'll need to use the free gcc compiler.
2008-08-26T02:26:00.000Z	CorbinFox	NDPMacBook	yeah, i know about the editor thing.  i alreayd have emacs installed from the night I had insomnia :P but im open.  and i can just apt-get the gcc compiler?
