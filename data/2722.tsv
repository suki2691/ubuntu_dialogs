2012-06-02T04:10:00.000Z	MCl0vin	reisio	my best best is to convert them , like you preceded and suggested :)
2012-06-02T05:15:00.000Z	reisio	MCl0vin	maybe, but what you should actually do is tell your instructor that nowhere was it stated you had to purchase $200's worth of Microsoft Windows to take this class
