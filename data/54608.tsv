2009-06-11T08:12:00.000Z	soulwarp		Do i have to use a virus scanner program? Someone suggested one to me but I forgot.
2009-06-11T08:12:00.000Z	soulwarp		I can't seem to find the defrag program either
2009-06-11T08:13:00.000Z	fccf-sb	soulwarp	there is no need for defrag, viruses are very few and far between on linux
2009-06-11T08:13:00.000Z	fccf-sb	soulwarp	thats the idea
