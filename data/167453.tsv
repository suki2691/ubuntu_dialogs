2007-11-04T15:06:00.000Z	Gunn		Hey guys, I am defragging before I install unbuntu as a dual boot, and its taking forever, and I've lost like 7 or 8GB's of space im noticing as I check my C drive...why is that ?
2007-11-04T15:07:00.000Z	Gunn		does defragging eat up that much space or something, I dont get it
2007-11-04T15:08:00.000Z	starcannon	Gunn	defragging does just that, it defragments the drive, it shouldn't cause the files to use more space, it should just put all the empty spaces out at the end of the drive if I understand correctly
