2007-03-22T07:29:00.000Z	Ayabara_		I did a dist-upgrade to feisty that failed bigtime. now I'n reinstalling edgy. is it straight-forward to reuse the same home folder and account (on separate partition)?
2007-03-22T07:30:00.000Z	wols	Ayabara_	no. you need the account recreated too
2007-03-22T07:30:00.000Z	Ayabara_	wols	by just using the same name?
2007-03-22T07:30:00.000Z	wols	Ayabara_	yes
