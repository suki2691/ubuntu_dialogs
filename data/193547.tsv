But the lawyers got involved so i need to find any language that states it's ok for a commerical entity to install the OS. Any ideas?
2006-08-11T13:37:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	bigman32	do you mean, is it okay for a commerical entity to install and charge for it, or install it?
2006-08-11T13:38:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	bigman32	yes, its legal for you to install it, because the license doesn't prohibit it.
