2006-07-29T10:12:00.000Z	eyequeue	DarkMageZ	i considered it a "no we don't support xf86" conversation :)
2006-07-29T10:13:00.000Z	DarkMageZ	eyequeue	oh, sorry, i only caught the last bits of the conversation (which involved xgl)
2006-07-29T10:14:00.000Z	eyequeue	DarkMageZ	yeah, i was already trying to get freenode to cooperate to /list that, so i could verify it's the one i was thinking of :) before sending anyone, lol
