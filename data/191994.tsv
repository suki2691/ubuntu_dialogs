2006-05-31T07:45:00.000Z	andrejkw		I am using Gnome. Today I boot and find out that all fonts are big, only text box, button, and application fonts. I tried checking the sizes in Font but they seem fine.
2006-05-31T07:45:00.000Z	andrejkw		How do I fix it?
2006-05-31T07:45:00.000Z	orbin	andrejkw	is it possible your screen res. changed?
2006-05-31T07:46:00.000Z	andrejkw	orbin	no
