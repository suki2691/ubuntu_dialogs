2010-08-05T07:45:00.000Z	Galaxor		Hi.  I'm trying to play videos from dvd or file.  I get a black box where the video should be.  I get audio though.  I've got nvidia with proprietary drivers, using 10.04.  Anybody know anything about that?
2010-08-05T07:45:00.000Z	Galaxor		Are there common fixes for black-box-instead-of-video, or is this likely to be a bug in the nvidia driver?
