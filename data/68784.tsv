2009-05-02T08:57:00.000Z	scunizi	princedugan	try from www.localhost:631
2009-05-02T09:00:00.000Z	princedugan	scunizi	I should have clarified, cups is working fine, is *reported* broken. the ~~:631 link works, but I don't see an uninstal option there
2009-05-02T09:01:00.000Z	scunizi	princedugan	sorry that was my only suggestion.. you might ask in ##linux
