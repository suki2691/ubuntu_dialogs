2006-09-23T09:37:00.000Z	aztracker1	dummkauf	all I had to do is select the nvidia commercial drivers in synaptic.
2006-09-23T09:38:00.000Z	dummkauf	aztracker1	I did that, but the nvidia module disappears after I reboot and I can't get it working again
2006-09-23T09:38:00.000Z	aztracker1	dummkauf	weird..
