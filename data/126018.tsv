2007-12-23T04:17:00.000Z	kriel		Okay. I was having a problem in ubuntu, and I managed to fix it myself. I searched on the forums, and I found a workaround there, but I wasn't satisfied. So I went and found another workaround (That I believe is better.) Now, since I've got this knowledge... where's the appropriate place to put it?

2007-12-23T04:19:00.000Z	kriel	serenityUK	that's what i figured, but i didn't see too  many other howto's, so i wasn't sure.
2007-12-23T04:20:00.000Z	serenityUK	kriel	some of the best threads are HOWTOs  some over 100pages long so popular.  the forums are so busy they float to the top then get buried
