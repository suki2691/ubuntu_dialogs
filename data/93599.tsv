2008-06-08T11:58:00.000Z	tritium	tony403	since when did you enable the root account?
2008-06-08T12:01:00.000Z	tony403	tritium	you don't. you just automount as root or change disk permissions
2008-06-08T12:13:00.000Z	tritium	tony403	no, you don't understand my question.  Ubuntu doesn't enable the root account.  It grants sudo priveleges to the first user created.
