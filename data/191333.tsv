2007-03-24T15:56:00.000Z	acacianadept		can I resize partitions? I already have ubuntu installed and there doesn't seem to be a howto for it
2007-03-24T15:57:00.000Z	acacianadept		flannel: so I'll have to re-install ubuntu then?
2007-03-24T15:58:00.000Z	AlexC_	acacianadept	boot into LiveCD to use modify partitions, is what Flannel is saying
2007-03-24T15:58:00.000Z	AlexC_	acacianadept	after you've modifiyed partitions, boot into Ubuntu as normal, no need to re-install
