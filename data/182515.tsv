2006-08-03T10:15:00.000Z	stefg	duncanm	that's a pretty common scenario
2006-08-03T10:15:00.000Z	duncanm	stefg	i'm having trouble mounting if my UID is not the same across server/client
2006-08-03T10:15:00.000Z	duncanm	stefg	in fact, i can mount okay but the UID on the client is the one from the server, which is not what i want
