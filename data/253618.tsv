2010-09-05T15:33:00.000Z	nordle		hello.  Reading http://www.ubuntugeek.com/kernel-2-6-35-officially-available-for-ubuntu-10-04.html it says "This kernel is now available in the git repository of Ubuntu 10.04"  and  "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade".  If its a dist-upgrade, isn't that 10.10 beta?  I don't understand how it can remain 10.04 but with 2.6.35.4 kernel.  Can anyone help me understand this please?  Thanks.
