2008-03-21T08:48:00.000Z	Yowshi		is there a command or app i can use to delete files with duplicate names so i can ditch my mp3's after i convert them using audacious?
2008-03-21T08:48:00.000Z	Yowshi		since audacious doesnt seem to have a delete source file option
2008-03-21T08:49:00.000Z	Yowshi		either that or anyone have a better converter then audacity?
