2011-02-04T07:51:00.000Z	Spyderbyte		hey im a long time supporter of ubuntu and im just curious why on the ubuntu website under their downloads, that they recomment ubuntu 32 bit over a 64 bit version
2011-02-04T07:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Spyderbyte	 basically its 'idiot proofing'
2011-02-04T07:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Spyderbyte	 if someone has no clue what 64/32bit means.. they get pointed to 32bit.
2011-02-04T07:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Spyderbyte	 ive nad no issues with 64bit in ages. :)
