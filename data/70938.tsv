2008-12-22T03:50:00.000Z	jjanzer_	Jordan_U	yeah but the install won't complete b/c there are a few corrupted packages it tries to install
2008-12-22T03:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jjanzer_	What packages? Have you tried doing a minimal installing what you need?
2008-12-22T03:55:00.000Z	jjanzer_	Jordan_U	lots of core packages like python bsdutils etc, if i could just install over the net i'd be fine....
