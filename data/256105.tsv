2011-08-12T22:37:00.000Z	Biohazardsteven		Should I run the ubuntu updates, I mean this is a clean install?
2011-08-12T22:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	Biohazardsteven	 update every so often is a good idea...
2011-08-12T22:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	Biohazardsteven	 id say at least every other week..
2011-08-12T22:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	Biohazardsteven	 try and update, and upgrade and see what gets pulled in.
