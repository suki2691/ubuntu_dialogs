2010-01-31T08:18:00.000Z	[BT]Brendan		I'm wanting to buy an external hard drive but all the ones I look at on the website of our local computer store say they require Windows or Mac. These can all be easily formatted to work with Linux, yeah?
2010-01-31T08:19:00.000Z	[BT]Brendan		Thanks, thanks, thanks and thanks.
