2010-06-17T19:20:00.000Z	vu1kan1		my specific question is: can anybody explain why the gnome sensors applet would say my cpu is running at 100+ degrees Fahrenheit?
2010-06-17T19:21:00.000Z	Intrepd	vu1kan1	100F seems ok
2010-06-17T19:21:00.000Z	Intrepd	vu1kan1	i'm at 55C
2010-06-17T19:22:00.000Z	Intrepd	vu1kan1	oh so is your problem that the bios and sensors aren't reporting the same values?
