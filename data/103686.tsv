2009-01-14T05:51:00.000Z	ernz		Hi everyone. I'm still searching for a webcam that works with Intrepid Ibex out of the box. I have bought and returned 5 cameras so far. Can anyone suggest a camera that they have working with 8.10?
2009-01-14T05:53:00.000Z	ernz		Thanks ActionParsnip: I have used this list to choose the cameras that haven't worked so far. Can't find any that claim to work with 8.10
