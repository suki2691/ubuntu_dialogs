2012-08-13T19:03:00.000Z	TheShrubber	linuxuz3r	Do you mean you want it to show only when your mouse is ther, because i dont know of any such funcionality
2012-08-13T19:05:00.000Z	TheShrubber	linuxuz3r	Not to be rude, but have you considered googling on ubuntu help pages? or maybe oyuve already done that since youre here...
