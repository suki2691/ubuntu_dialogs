2011-06-16T08:16:00.000Z	van7hu		hello, the CAT utility in ubuntu, what does -u means? I just see "ignored"?
2011-06-16T08:16:00.000Z	van7hu		so it's not used?
2011-06-16T08:17:00.000Z	escott	van7hu	it is ignored. it probably meant something on some old version of UNIX so the flag exists so as not to break things
2011-06-16T08:18:00.000Z	van7hu	escott	got it, thanks
