2007-03-26T07:02:00.000Z	kkkkkkkkkkkk	kingcobra	did you install all of the codecs?  If I remember correctly, wmv is not in the prepackaged group of codecs.
2007-03-26T07:05:00.000Z	kkkkkkkkkkkk	kingcobra	theres a codec pack you can download if my memory serves me correctly... dont remember offhand what it's called, or where to get it, but if you google for mplayer codec wmv, it should come up.
