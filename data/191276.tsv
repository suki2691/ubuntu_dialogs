2006-08-09T12:17:00.000Z	tobberoth		Anyone who can help me with the following fdisk error? "Warning: invalid flag 0x6d42 of partition table 7 will be corrected by w(rite)"
2006-08-09T12:19:00.000Z	tobberoth		It isn't fixing the problem automatically if that's what you mean
2006-08-09T12:19:00.000Z	tobberoth		sudo fdisk doesn't work, it says it needs more arguments
2006-08-09T12:20:00.000Z	steveire	tobberoth	did you try sudo fdisk -l?
