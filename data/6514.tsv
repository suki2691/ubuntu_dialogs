2012-01-10T06:00:00.000Z	rdeschain		hey, i'm having difficulty with something.  anybody know a more correct way of encoding base64 than "echo foo | base64 -" ?
2012-01-10T06:01:00.000Z	rdeschain		the issue with that command is that it's base64 encoding a newline after the foo string
2012-01-10T06:03:00.000Z	Skeme	rdeschain	take the spaces out and wrap in quotes?.. e.g echo "foo"|base64
2012-01-10T06:04:00.000Z	rdeschain	Skeme	quotes didn't work either... i guess echo -n strips the newline
