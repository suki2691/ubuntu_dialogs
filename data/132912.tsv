2007-08-08T11:08:00.000Z	lockd	GamingX	the language the program is written in, and the libraries it uses
2007-08-08T11:11:00.000Z	lockd	GamingX	if you don't know what programming language it's in, you don't know the programming language
2007-08-08T11:11:00.000Z	lockd	GamingX	but seriously, any project page should tell you.. most are C or C++
