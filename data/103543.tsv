2012-09-14T06:33:00.000Z	de		Big problem. Was running commands to install xfce 4.10 and it worked just fine. I was testing out xfce but then decided to run commands to remove it. It was never removed and now when I log into unity i dont get anything except acesss to my terminal which is how I got here
2012-09-14T06:33:00.000Z	de		what can I do. I just want to redo all that I did lol.
2012-09-14T06:34:00.000Z	de		I also installed gnome shell which caused me to reboot my computer 6 times in two days. So i think i just want regular old unity and ubuntu back
