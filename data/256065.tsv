2011-12-22T16:55:00.000Z	nitiab		i am having trouble connecting to freenode using all my irc clients, from kvirc or irssi to pidgin, seems like they are unable to resolve even the name, plus i am getting absolutely no output at all if i try to ping the irc servers. any ideas ? using the webchat now
2011-12-22T16:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	nitiab	 try connecting via the ip of the server? if that works. that would point to a dns issue.
2011-12-22T17:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	nitiab	 i normally use googles dns, and opendns (one of each) :)
2011-12-22T17:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	nitiab	 could be a temp issue with your isp's servers
