2012-11-29T00:05:00.000Z	HowdyBob		Anyone know if it's possible for rsync to use check multiple directories for --ignore-existing
2012-11-29T00:06:00.000Z	ikonia	HowdyBob	you need an ignore file
2012-11-29T00:06:00.000Z	HowdyBob	ikonia	I'd run a script to populate the ignore file with the directory contents?
2012-11-29T00:07:00.000Z	ikonia	HowdyBob	same format as the exclude file
