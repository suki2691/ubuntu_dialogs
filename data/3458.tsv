2012-10-07T18:16:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ArmyMan007	Did that tutorial include running alsamixer in the terminal and checking if anything is muted, and checking the preferences in sound a right click on the icon, if you reference a page or tutorial post it we don't all know of them there are 1000's of wiki pages.
2012-10-07T18:17:00.000Z	ArmyMan007	wilee-nilee	there's only one OFFICIAL tutorial given by the Ubuntu Dev team, and that's the one i've been working on. to sum up all of your questions: yes... and no, it didn't work
2012-10-07T18:17:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	ArmyMan007	I will take your word on that good luck.
