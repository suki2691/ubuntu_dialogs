2007-03-14T08:35:00.000Z	PirateHead	JohnPhys	it's always, always a bad idea to run any partitioner during a thunderstorm, for instance.
2007-03-14T08:36:00.000Z	PirateHead	JohnPhys	when you're operating on a critical drive, it's just extra nuts.
2007-03-14T08:36:00.000Z	JohnPhys	PirateHead	 Alrighty.  I'm just curious as to how a command to format one physical drive could affect another if power were cut.
