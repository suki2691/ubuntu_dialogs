2006-06-29T15:49:00.000Z	_absolution_		I'm having trouble with tar files.....cant seem to untar them....
2006-06-29T15:50:00.000Z	_absolution_		I've tried zxvf and jxvf
2006-06-29T15:50:00.000Z	biscon	_absolution_	try tar xzvf somearchive.tar.gz from the commandline
2006-06-29T15:50:00.000Z	biscon	_absolution_	the order of the arguments doesn't matter but z is gz and j is bzip2
