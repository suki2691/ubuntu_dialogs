2006-09-20T05:54:00.000Z	ootput		does the livecd offer an X environment? or is it all business and cli?
2006-09-20T05:55:00.000Z	myatthu	ootput	why not try it out ? its gnome if you got ubuntu live cd ... if you wanna know
2006-09-20T05:56:00.000Z	ootput	myatthu	because i don't need to :) I've been using the alt-disk for installation on my boxes in the past. I was helping tempest earlier (providing instructions on how to restore the mbr,) and I'm worried that he won't be able to navigate the livecd (if it was cli-only) in case he messed something up on his system
