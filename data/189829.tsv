2006-04-24T08:59:00.000Z	francolq_	Falstius	I've heard about the 32bit environment... it could help me with a lot of problems... is there any wiki that explains how to do that?
2006-04-24T09:17:00.000Z	francolq_	Falstius	sorry if i bother too much: can you tell me a couple of tips for installing 32 bit wine in my AMD64 ubuntu?
2006-04-24T09:19:00.000Z	Falstius	francolq_	you really want to install a 32bit version of wine .. either by compiling it yourself in 32bit mode or running the version from the winehq in a 32bit change environment.  You can google for how to set up a 32bit environment.
