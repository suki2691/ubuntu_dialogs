2006-11-01T08:23:00.000Z	egal		i'd like to try out ubuntu, so i put the kernel and ramdisk from dists/edgy/main/installer-i386/current/images/hd-media/ on an empty partition and booted from it. now the installer doesn't seem to support a network installation and only offers to look for an install-iso-image.
2006-11-01T08:24:00.000Z	tat	egal	try the net-install image
2006-11-01T08:27:00.000Z	egal	tat	the thing is, i actually have a full ubuntu iso, but the installer doesn't let me mount the related partition and supply the path - the only option is to make an automated search that doesn't work. this is kind of irritating.
2006-11-01T08:28:00.000Z	tat	egal	oh..
