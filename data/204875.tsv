2009-06-24T19:42:00.000Z	Megistos		I'm upgrading to 9.04 via a fresh install with /home on a separate partition - will it automatically import my old user account if I give it the same name and password in the install phase?
2009-06-24T19:43:00.000Z	Megistos		yeah, it's going to be mounted as /home and not formatted
2009-06-24T19:43:00.000Z	taxman	Megistos	I don't even think it asks for the password, it just offers to migrate the previous info if it sees it
2009-06-24T19:44:00.000Z	taxman	Megistos	but if you've got a separate home partition, you're not migrating anything, you don't need themigration asistant
