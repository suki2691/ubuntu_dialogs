2009-07-06T19:30:00.000Z	misteralexander		I am trying to install NDISWRAPPER on a computer with no internet.  So, I'm downloading all the NDISWRAPPER .deb's to a thumb drive and installing it one at a time. Well, it seems, there are like a thousand dependencies . . . causing me to endlessly run back & fourth.  Is there a way to get EVERYTHING all at once, instead of one at a time . . . FOREVER???
