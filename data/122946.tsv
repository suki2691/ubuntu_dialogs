2007-09-17T10:46:00.000Z	mindrape	Zenerek	- should we?  Well, I guess what I should and shouldn't do is my business.. installing and using beta software isn't a cardinal sin so I'm okay with it.  :)
2007-09-17T10:46:00.000Z	mindrape	Zenerek	- its not like you can't disable beryl if it causes problems.  :)
