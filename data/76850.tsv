2009-05-31T13:34:00.000Z	Tyrath		I installed some new fonts and now all the ubuntu jaunty fonts (which I liked) seem to have disappeared/been disabled. Is there anyway I can reenable them or get them back?
2009-05-31T13:35:00.000Z	Tyrath		I can tell you exactly what I did if you need me to explain
2009-05-31T13:37:00.000Z	gnr	Tyrath	#fc-cache -rv
2009-05-31T13:38:00.000Z	Tyrath	gnr	I just tried that but it didn't seem to do anything. should I take away the # ?
