2009-01-03T10:34:00.000Z	untermensch		I have a MacBook Pro that I am installing Ubuntu 8.10 on. The install seemed to be sucessful, and gparted shows both partitions to have some amount of used space. However, when I boot the computer, it always goes to OS X, and does not give an option to boot Ubuntu. How can I correct this?
