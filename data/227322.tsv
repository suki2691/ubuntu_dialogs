2005-08-05T09:04:00.000Z	xkuseme	dougsk	i mean i am gonna trick the windows, just for the installation i'll make it master ubuntu won't even notice, coz the next time i boot into it it will be switched back to slave
2005-08-05T09:05:00.000Z	dougsk	xkuseme	that is doable supposing the motherboard/bios supports booting to another drive besides the first primary
2005-08-05T09:05:00.000Z	xkuseme	dougsk	that is what i am wondering about
