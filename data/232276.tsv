2009-05-24T16:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	kilior	the dhcp server remembers you and give to you the same ip if it can
2009-05-24T16:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	kilior	so not much you can do if you do not control the dhcp server afaik
2009-05-24T16:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	kilior	dclient ask for an ip... the server gives it one... it is the server the one wich chooses what ip to give
