2008-06-03T04:05:00.000Z	gerardoj		I was wondering why in my company they didnt like I've had installed nessus? I mean I dont see anything wrong with it... what u guys think?
2008-06-03T04:06:00.000Z	Starnestommy	gerardoj	I think nessus uses port scanning
2008-06-03T04:07:00.000Z	gerardoj	Starnestommy	yeah, but I work as a developer so I dont see anything bad with it
2008-06-03T04:07:00.000Z	Starnestommy	gerardoj	it also checks for the exploits by actually using them
