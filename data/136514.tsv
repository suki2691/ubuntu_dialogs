2007-09-14T08:52:00.000Z	neverblue	Kwanun	why are you even asking such a question ?
2007-09-14T08:55:00.000Z	neverblue	Kwanun	well you realize that an OS can come in many flavors, since ubuntu and fedora are both based on linux, you can imagine that many different types of packages could be installed on each OS, which would mean that each OS size could possibly never be the same
2007-09-14T08:57:00.000Z	neverblue	Kwanun	further more, each package that is available to fedora is a different package then those for ubuntu as ubuntu is debian based, you install .deb, and fedora is based on red hat, which uses .rpms
