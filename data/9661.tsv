2011-12-09T07:36:00.000Z	zromayn		hello there, can anybody show me any document showing how to export an encrypted directory? I encrypted my home dir. If I try exporting it, i get "exportfs: /home/usuer1/backup does not support NFS export"
2011-12-09T07:36:00.000Z	aj00200	zromayn	are you trying to recover it?
2011-12-09T07:37:00.000Z	zromayn	aj00200	no, it's not for data recovery. I just want to be able to export it over NFS
2011-12-09T07:37:00.000Z	zromayn	aj00200	unless, you really can't export an encrypted dir at all.
