2008-12-24T06:56:00.000Z	nwillettjeffries	shingi	hmm...obligatory basic questions. You have the appropriate codecs installed
2008-12-24T07:01:00.000Z	nwillettjeffries	shingi	those are the obvious issue I could think of...someone else might know. I'm trying to figure it out right now but no guarantees...
