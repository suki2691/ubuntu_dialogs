2009-07-19T03:53:00.000Z	xim_		im trying to figure out the proper arguments to give the unrar command to make it extract the rar into a new folder with the name of the rar file, i want to do this in a for loop for multiple rar files, but i cant figure out the new folders thing.  Does anyone know the syntax?
