2007-12-09T02:35:00.000Z	BruceM91		i am upgrading, and it is asking me "replace the customized configuration file'/ect/sysctl.conf'?". Should I keep or replace?
2007-12-09T02:35:00.000Z	sethk	BruceM91	did you make configuration changes that would change the sysctl configuration file?
2007-12-09T02:36:00.000Z	sethk	BruceM91	In a case like this, back up the file, then say yes.
2007-12-09T02:36:00.000Z	sethk	BruceM91	well, if the changes didn't work, you don't have much to lose by overwriting them  :)
