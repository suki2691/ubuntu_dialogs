2009-06-23T18:31:00.000Z	stew	sarmisak	because pretty much people should never use --force-anything, and lots of this proprietary software isn't available as a .deb anyway
2009-06-23T18:31:00.000Z	sarmisak	stew	if you are compiling it, it should compile for 64bit easily. if it is a .bin file, then you are right
2009-06-23T18:32:00.000Z	stew	sarmisak	neither, and some of the i386  stuff i'm using doesn't have source available.  some of the stuff can't be compiled for 64bit easily.  other stuff I'm using can be compiled for 64 bit easily, and it doesn't work
