2008-04-29T21:17:00.000Z	taime1		the old method only allows me to change keyboard and mouse setting
2008-04-29T21:18:00.000Z	salvubuntu	taime1	run dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and it should put back the xorg.conf to previous state, dont forget to backup
2008-04-29T21:18:00.000Z	taime1	salvubuntu	it doesnt allow me to configure it fully. it only allows changing the mouse and keyboard setting
