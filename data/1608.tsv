2012-09-28T13:42:00.000Z	JamezQ	VlanX	what does the text file look like?
2012-09-28T13:44:00.000Z	VlanX	JamezQ	i need to take the IP address out from the text file of my router's configuration. The rest of the text file are CLI commands such as "ip addree 192.168.10.1" for example. I need the VRA to be "192.168.10.1"
