2008-04-30T06:20:00.000Z	Mattevt		I have dual monitors set up. When I do. The task bar is set up correctly with (Applications Places System) lined up on the top left. When I turned off the computer and unplugged the external monitor, the resolution was still in dual mode. I changed the resolution to fit the single screen but now (apps places system) is lined up on the left...and the items on the task bar are all in different places.
