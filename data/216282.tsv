2006-05-26T09:48:00.000Z	javatard		I installed ubuntu on my laptop. Package manager tells me i have updates, but when I type in my root password it opens nothing. Going to synaptic package manger wont open anything either. I switched to root in terminal and still it sounds as if it (package manager) will open, but it doesnt
2006-05-26T09:50:00.000Z	javatard		!package manager
2006-05-26T09:51:00.000Z	javatard		My package manager will not open with my root password. It sounds as if it will but never opens, is this an install error on my part?
