A bit of searching indicated that this was a networking problem, and I've commented out the IPv6 lines from my /etc/hosts and also modified the lines for my local host entries... but the problem does not seem to be any better.
2007-04-12T15:42:00.000Z	VSpike		Is there any way I can actually diagnose if the programs are having trouble connecting to the x server?

2007-04-12T13:06:00.000Z	YetiChick	VSpike	 I agree.
