2007-06-15T07:11:00.000Z	niriven		Hi, why does my byte usage on a particular drive go up over time, even when i dont do anything?
2007-06-15T07:12:00.000Z	Frogzoo	niriven	/var/log/ mostly
2007-06-15T07:13:00.000Z	niriven	Frogzoo	Ah, makes sense, anything else? And, does /var/log ever get removed?
2007-06-15T07:14:00.000Z	niriven	Frogzoo	I still removed /var/log/*, and, it still goes up, yet nothing is written there.
