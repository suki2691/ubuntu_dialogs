2007-03-21T14:55:00.000Z	Slart	AJIEXA_	try gnome partition editor.. or gparted as it's also called
2007-03-21T14:55:00.000Z	Slart	AJIEXA_	well.. it does the job
2007-03-21T15:00:00.000Z	Slart	AJIEXA_	mm.. you can't mess with partitions while you're using it.... you'll have to unmount it first (if you compare to windows, the program unmount the drive autoamtically but you still can't use it while you're moving it etc)
