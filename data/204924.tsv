2005-12-11T11:53:00.000Z	vblanton		Hey all ,I want to keep the same home folder with all my files from gentoo linux, but some of the hidden config files make it a little messy.  Should I just delete all the hidden folders and THEN install ubuntu? Will that work?
2005-12-11T11:53:00.000Z	vblanton		If I keep th hidden files/folders with the config's then sometimes programs in a test-install of kubuntu I have act a little funky, and my Kmenu is not really functional and has fake entries...

2005-12-11T11:55:00.000Z	vblanton	freelove	ok. thanks for double checking
