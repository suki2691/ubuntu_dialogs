2006-06-21T08:17:00.000Z	HBuzacott	_stefan	CPU clock is the Clock Speed of your processor, eg. 3.2 Ghz
2006-06-21T08:18:00.000Z	_stefan	HBuzacott	is FSB the same?
2006-06-21T08:20:00.000Z	HBuzacott	_stefan	no, FSB is your frontsidebus. The way that the speed of you processor is entered is the FSB speed (eg. 800mhz) and a multiplier (4) which would give a clock speed of 3.2 Ghz.
