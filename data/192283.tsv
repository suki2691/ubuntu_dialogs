2006-08-15T16:24:00.000Z	FunnyHat	harisund	well, 64bit support for apps with a 64 bit kernel is not what i would call stable quite yet, so i would stick with 686 probably
2006-08-15T16:25:00.000Z	harisund	FunnyHat	so both of k7 and k8 are for 64 bit? I am running a 32 bit kernel (regular Ubuntu, not AMD64 UBuntu) only
2006-08-15T16:26:00.000Z	FunnyHat	harisund	no, k7 is still 32 bit, and k8 iirc is also 32bit...  but it is a safe bet to go with 686 compiled packages for any modern chip
