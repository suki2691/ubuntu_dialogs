2006-06-13T09:42:00.000Z	nf4		do all linux torrent clients run in the background? when restart the shut down log shows "stopping torrent tracker"
2006-06-13T09:42:00.000Z	nf4		as far as i know trackers are the server the the torrent is linked to
2006-06-13T09:42:00.000Z	dooglus	nf4	it says that for me even though I uninstalled the bittorrent package.
