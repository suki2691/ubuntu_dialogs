2009-03-27T14:59:00.000Z	Jeremy23		I have an ASUS M2NPV-VM motherboard, and suspend/resume doesn't work on Ubuntu 7.10, 8.04, 8.10, or 9.04. The last Ubuntu version it worked on was 7.04. I have reinstalled every time since. How can I debug the problem?
2009-03-27T14:59:00.000Z	Jeremy23		I have run the checkbox suspend debug script, but it doesn't even pass the first test, nor does it generate an apport report like it's supposed to.
2009-03-27T14:59:00.000Z	Jeremy23		Windows can suspend fine, so why is Linux so crap on my system?
2009-03-27T15:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	Jeremy23	ask your system assembler?
