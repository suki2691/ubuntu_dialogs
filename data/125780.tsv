2007-09-26T14:52:00.000Z	Vixyfox		Hey everyone, couple of questions. 1) I'm currently going to be installing Ubuntu 7.04 on my system, have 2 hard drives. One I'm making the correct linux type, but the other is in NTFS format. Is it possible, to take the information off that hard drvie and put it onto the other one. If so 2) Can that hard drive then after be put into proper linux format.
