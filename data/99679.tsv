2008-09-15T19:52:00.000Z	frost151n		i have a small problem, the clock on the top right of the screen shows a gray square instead of a weather symbol
2008-09-15T19:52:00.000Z	frost151n		its not major just irritating
2008-09-15T19:53:00.000Z	jim_p	frost151n	perhaps the weather forecast is not available at this time
