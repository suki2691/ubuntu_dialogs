2007-05-03T07:05:00.000Z	TTT_Travis		I am trying to create a command that will rm -R (Delete) all folders in a folder, but only if they are less than 1 MB
2007-05-03T07:05:00.000Z	Gorgapor	TTT_Travis	a find command should do that, i would have to mess around to figure out exactly how
2007-05-03T07:06:00.000Z	TTT_Travis	Gorgapor	yeah, I probably won't be able to figure it out, not good with this kind of stuff
2007-05-03T07:07:00.000Z	TTT_Travis	Gorgapor	unless I knew how to atleast get a list of files < 1mb
