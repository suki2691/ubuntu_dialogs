2012-08-29T19:41:00.000Z	Supermanintights		Hi, I'm trying to look at how I can create an IRC server, using my websites hosting - so the server is in effect - irc.checkhookboxing.com but I've tried looking, however I'm not really sure on where to start still
2012-08-29T19:41:00.000Z	Supermanintights		Does anyone have any experience with this?
2012-08-29T19:41:00.000Z	Meris	Supermanintights	do you have root on that server?
