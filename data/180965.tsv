2008-03-07T01:28:00.000Z	jim	NinjaPlimsoles	one way to uninstall is for him to find out everything make install did, and remove what it placed
2008-03-07T01:29:00.000Z	NinjaPlimsoles	jim	yeah but thats very arduous :P
2008-03-07T01:31:00.000Z	jim	NinjaPlimsoles	it might be his only choice... make uninstall may or may not work if it even exists for the thing he installed
