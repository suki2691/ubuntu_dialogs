2008-02-02T04:11:00.000Z	lostatsee		I keep getting an error when logging in about "Unable to start the settings manager 'gnome-settings-daemon'.
2008-02-02T04:11:00.000Z	lostatsee		Without the GNOME settings manager running, some preferences may not take effect. This could indicate a problem with Bonobo, or a non-GNOME (e.g. KDE) settings manager may already be active and conflicting with the GNOME settings manager."  Anyone know how to fix this?
