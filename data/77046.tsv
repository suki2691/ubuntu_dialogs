2010-01-12T00:50:00.000Z	Kentrel		I'm trying to install ubuntustudio from a USB drive and it aborts because I don't have a CD drive
2010-01-12T00:50:00.000Z	Kentrel		How can I get around this?
2010-01-12T00:51:00.000Z	Kentrel		Because the actual installation program wants me to have a DVD drive, even though I'm booting from a USB stick on a system with no DVD drive
