2010-05-23T09:54:00.000Z	Wyzerd	jabagawee	read the man page for screen?
2010-05-23T09:54:00.000Z	jabagawee	Wyzerd	weird thing is that i _know_ screen can run on two separate terminals to connect to the same session
2010-05-23T09:55:00.000Z	Wyzerd	jabagawee	indeed.  You shoudl still read the man page, because unless irts a bug you are doing something wrong.
