2006-12-13T09:35:00.000Z	MikeRack		does anybody knows this? I have a USB wireless card (linksys) and he can find a wlan0 interface. Could it be I still need ndiswrapper?
2006-12-13T09:36:00.000Z	HymnToLife	MikeRack	yes, most likely
2006-12-13T09:37:00.000Z	HymnToLife	MikeRack	check the ndiswrapper wiki if your card appears
