2008-07-07T00:50:00.000Z	trend		what is the most compatibile fs type? I need to have an ext hd readable in osx/linux/windows
2008-07-07T00:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	trend	 windows can read ext2/3 - and linux can read/write ntfs... so i guess you find out what OsX can read/write.
2008-07-07T00:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	trend	 yes it does.
