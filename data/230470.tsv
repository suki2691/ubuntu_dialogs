2005-11-21T11:13:00.000Z	seymour		I am having some trouble getting evolution emailer to update my gmail account.  Everytime I load it up it starts to do it and then quickly cuts out of the connecting to smtp box.
2005-11-21T11:13:00.000Z	seymour		not sure what it is but havent gotten any new incoming mail since oct

2005-11-21T11:17:00.000Z	dabaR	seymour	no, google likely did not, but sometimes little things get changed in the account, just recheck it.
