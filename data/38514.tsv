2010-02-01T16:36:00.000Z	_Bart_		Hi, can someone tell me how I can restore the default keyring?
2010-02-01T16:38:00.000Z	KrisKo	_Bart_	keyrings  are in ~/.gnome2/keyrings/
2010-02-01T16:38:00.000Z	_Bart_	KrisKo	yes I deleted the default one but it isn't recreated...
2010-02-01T16:40:00.000Z	KrisKo	_Bart_	try delete keyrings directory
