2009-02-25T08:39:00.000Z	Titan8990	madmike	that defeats the purpose of memory doesn't it?
2009-02-25T08:40:00.000Z	Titan8990	madmike	if something else needs to space of a closed application, linux will give clear it up
2009-02-25T08:40:00.000Z	Titan8990	madmike	but it stays there in case you open the app again
