2007-11-21T22:29:00.000Z	ts_		How would I speed up a DD clone?.. I am cloning CF memory cards, and I use 'bs=4k'. It's only going 3mb/sec. Thanks
2007-11-21T22:30:00.000Z	sipior	ts_	a larger block size would help
2007-11-21T22:30:00.000Z	ts_	sipior	 and how would I go about doing that?
2007-11-21T22:30:00.000Z	sipior	ts_	well, change bs to 64k, for example
