2011-11-26T18:13:00.000Z	Anomie21_		I have a iphone with tethering which I cant install, and a wifi dongle that I cant install - heh
2011-11-26T18:14:00.000Z	Anomie21_		wifi on the computer isnt working as it has no wifi card, it has a wifi dongle but its just a cheap one I bought off ebay and it only has the linux source on it
2011-11-26T18:15:00.000Z	Anomie21_		maybe I could get a 'generic' wifi dongle .deb file that would get that working? Or is there no chance that would work?
