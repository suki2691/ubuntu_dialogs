2012-06-15T01:06:00.000Z	Guest11783		I have a folder I made called Games in home and it isn't recognized as even being there
2012-06-15T01:06:00.000Z	Guest11783		I tried to LS it or CD it and it keeps saying that it doesn't exist
2012-06-15T01:06:00.000Z	Guest11783		It is in my home directory/username
