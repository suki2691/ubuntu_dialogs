2005-07-18T11:14:00.000Z	Mestapheles		XFS has just umounted two of my partitions and I get I/O errors when passing commands.  Any thoughts?
2005-07-18T11:14:00.000Z	Madpilot	Mestapheles	nah, nothing else happened aside from Screem falling over...
2005-07-18T11:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	Mestapheles	unless there's a way of checking logs somewhere to see why Screem froze?
