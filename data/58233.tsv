2009-10-03T07:27:00.000Z	sei		Hello, Why I keep getting Ubuntu running in low graphics mode whenever I start it, and it works well after I restart?
2009-10-03T07:29:00.000Z	jawall	sei	Sounds like a boot problem.. perhaps you have the wrong driver installed?
2009-10-03T07:30:00.000Z	sei	jawall	i didnt install any driver, i just updated ubuntu through update manager when i first installed it(few days ago)
2009-10-03T07:31:00.000Z	sei	jawall	would the update manager install a wrong driver?
