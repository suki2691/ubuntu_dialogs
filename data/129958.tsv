2008-04-21T01:20:00.000Z	dudeeee34		Can anyone help me figure out the form of installation on ubuntu. In windows there would be like .exe .zip and .cab. What are the things here?
2008-04-21T01:20:00.000Z	dudeeee34		.deb is like .exe?
2008-04-21T01:21:00.000Z	tomd123	dudeeee34	no, .deb is more like .msi
2008-04-21T01:21:00.000Z	tomd123	dudeeee34	.deb is used to install the program
