2005-12-15T08:37:00.000Z	plus_m		I have a noob question
2005-12-15T08:37:00.000Z	plus_m		how do you remove KDE from your system?
2005-12-15T08:38:00.000Z	plus_m		so is it kdebase or kdm and kde
2005-12-15T08:38:00.000Z	kyncani	plus_m	methinks removing a package is probably using synaptic + debfoster (and you will need to read docs, at least for the debfoster part)
