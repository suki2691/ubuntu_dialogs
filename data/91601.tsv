2010-04-20T21:45:00.000Z	joaopinto	halsafar	did you file the bug report 5 years ago :) ?
2010-04-20T21:47:00.000Z	joaopinto	halsafar	right, but since you didn't care to report it so it could be fixed for you and the others, it's a bit intriguing to read your complain
2010-04-20T21:49:00.000Z	joaopinto	halsafar	wikis provide work arounds, real fixes come from bug reports ;)
