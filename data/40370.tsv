2011-06-14T15:31:00.000Z	FireStorms		So an admin can delete critical system files, right??
2011-06-14T15:33:00.000Z	FireStorms		So my options are now compromise my whole system by adding my user (that I use 99% of the time) to admin group, or hard code a root password into a bash script... excellent
