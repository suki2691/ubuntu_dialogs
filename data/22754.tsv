2010-11-15T13:14:00.000Z	SAngeli		Hi, I have a simple question: I have ubuntu desktop and created an administrator account. I installed one application. I also have a Desktop user and wish to copy the shortcut of the application installed and also let this application run on the desktop user with obviously less priviledges. How to do so? ANy doc on the Internet I can read or advice, please

2010-11-15T13:15:00.000Z	SAngeli	nbca	ok, so I would create perhaps a new group and assign use chmod?
