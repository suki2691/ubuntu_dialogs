2008-07-19T11:28:00.000Z	Jacen_		So, SPYderZ, you're saying don't even bother trying?
2008-07-19T11:28:00.000Z	SPYderZ	Jacen_	its not the OS.. the OS will install
2008-07-19T11:29:00.000Z	SPYderZ	Jacen_	but Acer laptops come with theese cheap processors... they are POWERFULL... but the heat up really fast... and where I work pleople come with Acers weakly to get them fixed
