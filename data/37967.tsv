2010-02-08T20:29:00.000Z	FoolsRun	habasch	that's always bothered me, too. I try to give friends stuff and I can never write to their drives.
2010-02-08T20:30:00.000Z	FoolsRun	habasch	what about ownership of the mountpoint?
2010-02-08T20:30:00.000Z	habasch	FoolsRun	the folder i mount to is owned by me already
