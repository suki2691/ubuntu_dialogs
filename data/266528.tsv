2011-08-18T23:45:00.000Z	venik212		I screwed up my UNITY-- now I cannot start it.  Gnome works fine, though.  I did it by playing with the Compiz settings, but undoing the changes did not restore Unity's function
2011-08-18T23:46:00.000Z	venik212		can anyone tell me how to restart unity?  I reinstalled almost everything I could think of..
2011-08-18T23:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	venik212	 try a unity --reset  or unity --reset-icons yet?
