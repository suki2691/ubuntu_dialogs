2011-10-12T11:03:00.000Z	ohzie	Ben64	A lot of people like ulv CPUs for servers nowadays. =P They don't have the brunt, but they can do everything a good server could do a few years ago. =P

2011-10-12T11:05:00.000Z	ohzie	Ben64	They make Atoms for desktop computers too. I just use an EEEpc because I like to be able to put my server in my backpack. =D
