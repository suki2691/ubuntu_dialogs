2012-09-27T21:03:00.000Z	ispirto		I'm having kernel panic issues and I suspected the RAM, I've been running memtest for half an hour now and it's stuck on this screen: http://i.imgur.com/ELdaL.png Does this mean the sticks are faulty?
2012-09-27T21:05:00.000Z	usr13_	ispirto	How many RAM sticks do you have installed?
2012-09-27T21:05:00.000Z	ispirto	usr13_	2
2012-09-27T21:05:00.000Z	usr13_	ispirto	Take out the first one and test again.
