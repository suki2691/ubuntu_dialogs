2011-04-03T22:21:00.000Z	patrik		so.. uhm im having a problem installing a taskbar on openbox can someone of you query me and help me out :)
2011-04-03T22:23:00.000Z	[thor]	patrik	couple things wrong with that; this is an ubuntu support channel only, and secondly most support on freenode is done via public channel.. getting someone to /msg is impractical as it robs other users of potentially useful information.
2011-04-03T22:25:00.000Z	[thor]	patrik	that was not a request for you to /msg me
