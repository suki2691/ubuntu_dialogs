2007-04-07T09:14:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	firefoxman	pretty good. It runs Office well, and Photoshop pretty well (except CS2/3 last time I looked)
2007-04-07T09:15:00.000Z	firefoxman	SlimeyPete	What about office 2003?
2007-04-07T09:16:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	firefoxman	not sure. Best to check their website - they have a compatibility list iirc
