2006-12-03T16:07:00.000Z	DrNic1		hi, dunno if anyone else has had this problem - i'm using Beryl, and everytime I press shift + backspace, the windowing system restarts, as if i've just pressed Ctrl + alt + backspace! which is a really annoying default, does anyone know where i'd change that?
2006-12-03T16:08:00.000Z	DrNic1		anyone?
