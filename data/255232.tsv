2007-10-13T10:23:00.000Z	slike		hi guys, i have to do a new ubuntu install: feels so useless to install 7.04 while 7.10 is just around the corner. is it a good idea to install 7.10 right now? (the machine is not of high importance in any way)?
2007-10-13T10:24:00.000Z	slike		chrisbrn: what about updates, will it be continuous, or should I do something once the final version has been released?
2007-10-13T10:25:00.000Z	kbrooks	slike	continuous
2007-10-13T10:25:00.000Z	kbrooks	slike	updates are deployed through the update manager
