2008-01-24T07:19:00.000Z	biouser	TuxOtaku	tell us more
2008-01-24T07:22:00.000Z	TuxOtaku	biouser	don't know what else to tell you, I took a look in boot-up manager to see if it was enabled at boottime, which it seems to be
2008-01-24T07:22:00.000Z	biouser	TuxOtaku	what action did you take directly prior to gdm not loading on boot
