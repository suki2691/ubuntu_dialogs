2008-08-01T02:05:00.000Z	serkan`c		i think there is a force option for x86 packages
2008-08-01T02:06:00.000Z	ikonia	serkan`c	amd64 won't see the x86 repos
2008-08-01T02:06:00.000Z	serkan`c	ikonia	not repos, single packages i mean, but i am not sure
2008-08-01T02:06:00.000Z	ikonia	serkan`c	ubuntu's not multi-lib so not the best idea in my opinion
