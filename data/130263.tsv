2009-06-26T03:17:00.000Z	bastidrazor	theunixgeek	you wait till they make it available for 3.5
2009-06-26T03:17:00.000Z	theunixgeek	bastidrazor	besides that; there are probably some workarounds available
2009-06-26T03:19:00.000Z	bastidrazor	theunixgeek	there is. find the file that checks what version of firefox you have.
