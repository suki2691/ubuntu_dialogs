2007-05-28T09:04:00.000Z	Anguis		I have a few questions - I've installed ubuntu 7.04 AMD64 and am having trouble booting using the standard method. In order to use ubuntu, I have to boot in Recovery mode and then type in "exit" at the command line. I then log in normally.
2007-05-28T09:05:00.000Z	Anguis		I've been told I need to make adjustments in GRUB, regarding nosplash and another term (argument/switch?)
2007-05-28T09:06:00.000Z	Anguis		Anyone know what I need to adjust in GRUB inorder to boot normally in Ubuntu 64 (I didn't have this problem with 32 bit ubuntu). Thanks for the help.
