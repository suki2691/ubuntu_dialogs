2007-10-23T08:31:00.000Z	Madpilot	xTheGoat121x	if you built them into debs, they'll be handled by dpkg. Otherwise, dpkg doesn't even know they exist
2007-10-23T08:32:00.000Z	xTheGoat121x	Madpilot	yeah... I've never worked with things I've installed from source (not from a deb), so how would I go about removing them?
2007-10-23T08:32:00.000Z	Madpilot	xTheGoat121x	I'm actually not sure. I've installed about three things from source, ever, and all of them were simple enough to just outright delete.
