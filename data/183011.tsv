2007-05-17T05:41:00.000Z	Pelo	yme1	is everquest a windows or dos game ?  wine for windows and mono for dos I think
2007-05-17T05:43:00.000Z	Pelo	yme1	 you'll need to install  wine first and then install evequest so wine can find it  and you run   wine /patch/to/everquest.exe
2007-05-17T05:43:00.000Z	Pelo	yme1	ask in #winehq for more info
