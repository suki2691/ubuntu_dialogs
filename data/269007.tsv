2004-10-15T15:16:00.000Z	Keybuk	memerman	patches were being sent to Debian before we even announced Ubuntu or Canonical
2004-10-15T15:19:00.000Z	Keybuk	memerman	regular six-monthly releases of the latest software, stabilised and bug-fixed
2004-10-15T15:21:00.000Z	Keybuk	memerman	no, you misunderstand.  We don't upload things to Debian, we just offer the patches through the BTS.  The Debian maintainers are free to decide not to take the patches
