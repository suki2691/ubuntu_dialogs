2009-12-09T12:34:00.000Z	askvictor	boringwall	cat > somefile.txt <<EOF
2009-12-09T12:37:00.000Z	boringwall	askvictor	- Where would the text that I would like to write to somefile.txt go?
2009-12-09T12:42:00.000Z	askvictor	boringwall	the concept you are looking for is a 'here file' - look it up (assuming you want to write more than one line of text)
