2012-04-27T05:49:00.000Z	the-erm	sk1special	I wish I could tell you try going to a terminal and typing sudo nvidia<tab><tab> and see if something comes up.
2012-04-27T15:49:00.000Z	the-erm	sk1special	as I recall once upon a time when I had an nvidia driver, I had to run the configure program as root to get it to save the config.  I was sudo <config-program>, but for the life of me I can't remember what it was.
