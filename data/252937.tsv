2012-05-28T23:29:00.000Z	garlic		ok I'm about to install windows 7, I'v alread got ubuntu 12.04 installed on my drive
2012-05-28T23:30:00.000Z	garlic		I'm wondering if I should install windows at the beginning of my drive partition or after ubuntu
2012-05-28T23:31:00.000Z	garlic		basically does it matter where I install windows7
2012-05-28T23:31:00.000Z	reisio	garlic	shouldn't technically matter, but Windows will appreciate being installed first
