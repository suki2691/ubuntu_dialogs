2006-06-05T08:40:00.000Z	obsidians		I've got a laptop with a built-in webcam (Acer Travelmate 8204). What do I need to do to get Ubuntu to recognize the webcam? It sees it in the device manager.

2006-06-05T08:46:00.000Z	obsidians	bobby	How would I go about finding such a driver?
2006-06-05T08:46:00.000Z	bobby	obsidians	google I guess
