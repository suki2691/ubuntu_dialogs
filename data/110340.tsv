2008-01-18T23:04:00.000Z	DRebellion	SpookyET	you could create a cron job to run sudo apt-get update every 24 hours
2008-01-18T23:05:00.000Z	DRebellion	SpookyET	and edit the sudoers file to allow no password for apt-get
2008-01-18T23:14:00.000Z	DRebellion	SpookyET	aptitude is a front-end for apt-get
