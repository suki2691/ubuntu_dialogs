2006-07-26T08:58:00.000Z	snoops	minerale	to reconnect to your current session from a windows box you'll need vnc.. to connect to new sessions and have it faster than rdp try freenx/nxclient

2006-07-26T12:05:00.000Z	snoops	minerale	umm can you choose which desktop to connect to in tightvncviewer? like ipaddress:session.. the one in front of your pc should be session 0 or 1
