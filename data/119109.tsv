2010-07-08T05:53:00.000Z	Tazzypillar		Hello, I want to try out KDE, preferably by installing it onto the same system as Gnome--but I'd like to keep the two /seperate/, so that they don't interfere with each other
2010-07-08T05:53:00.000Z	Tazzypillar		is there any way to get that to work?
2010-07-08T05:53:00.000Z	bazhang	Tazzypillar	not really
2010-07-08T05:53:00.000Z	bazhang	Tazzypillar	the various apps will both show up in the menu
