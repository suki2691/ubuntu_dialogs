2009-08-10T06:55:00.000Z	jamescarr_	Drained	some time back I came in here about my weird issue on my laptop of being unable to focus on other windows, swith windows, etc... I'd be locked into the current focus. If I alt+f4 to close the current app, I'd just be unable to to focus to anything else altogether
