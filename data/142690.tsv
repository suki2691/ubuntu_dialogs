2007-03-15T08:50:00.000Z	kenthomson		HELP; I am trying to boot a ubuntu 6.10 live cd-32bit, on my 64-bit computer. When i select boot-from-cd, it starts loading all the modules, but when it wants to load wlan (please note that i have manually switched wlan off), it tries it and than crashes. it tells me something like: "firmware not found in module bcmxxx". And than a blank screen-nothing. Please help me get past this annoying startuo-issue. PLease direct all your answers to "cezeta" as
