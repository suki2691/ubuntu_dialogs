2008-07-03T05:39:00.000Z	nano_		is it possible to even avoid loading of menu.lst altogether, and instead have direct loading of a specific selection
2008-07-03T05:40:00.000Z	stdin	nano_	just set the timeout to 0 or something
2008-07-03T05:40:00.000Z	nano_	stdin	what if i set the timer to -1?
2008-07-03T05:41:00.000Z	stdin	nano_	I'm not sure, it could mean infinity. (ie: displays the menu forever)
