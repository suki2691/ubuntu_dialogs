2012-11-16T11:53:00.000Z	dragonfly	topper4125	I have a couple of partitions encrypted, does that matters anyhow ?
2012-11-16T11:57:00.000Z	topper4125	dragonfly	to be honest, I don't play with encrypted drives... like ikonia said, only use them if you have a genuine need, can't honestly say what would happen.
2012-11-16T12:00:00.000Z	dragonfly	topper4125	I have some genuine reasons thats why I put up the encryption on drive, anyway, I am looking for a way to remove the encryption now, maybe google can help
