2005-05-11T07:57:00.000Z	jupiterste		I have a IBM ThinkCentre which is freezing up consistently, Debian users are reporting the same kind of problems, and it was recommeded to change the "IO-APIC option (X86_UP_IOAPIC = n)" does anyone know where that setting is located?
2005-05-11T07:59:00.000Z	tritium_	jupiterste	that's a kernel parameter.  You'd have to compile a new kernel, and change that value.
2005-05-11T08:02:00.000Z	jupiterste	tritium_	is there an easy way to do that or is it complicated?
2005-05-11T08:03:00.000Z	tritium_	jupiterste	if you've never done it before, you may find it a bit complicated, but it's not too bad.
