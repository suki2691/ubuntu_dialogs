2008-11-22T15:21:00.000Z	ladfnet		how come ubuntu remembers my network configs/ifconfig that is not stored in /etc/network/interfaces ?
2008-11-22T15:22:00.000Z	vlt_	ladfnet	I think it's stored in the $USER's config dir.
2008-11-22T15:25:00.000Z	vlt_		hohThe passwd can be stored in /etc the same way as in ~/  -- where's the difference?
2008-11-22T15:27:00.000Z	ladfnet	vlt_	I cannot find anything there. It's a server and it's giving me a headache.
