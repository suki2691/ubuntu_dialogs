2006-11-12T08:52:00.000Z	cablesm102		I've been using Adobe Flash 9 Beta for a while, but today it started completely crashing Firefox whenever I go to a page that uses Flash. I tried using Flash 7 (stable) but that also crashed. I started the LiveCD, and tried installing Flash on that, but it also had the same problem. This has never happened before. What's going on?
