2008-12-01T19:26:00.000Z	D7		what is an app for gnome that will tile all your windows on the screen so you can see them all and choose which to bring in focus, like macosx does?
2008-12-01T19:28:00.000Z	Myrtti	D7	compiz
2008-12-01T19:28:00.000Z	D7	Myrtti	how do I configure such a thing?
2008-12-01T19:29:00.000Z	Myrtti	D7	I'm running xubuntu personally, perhaps someone else actually running compiz can help you :-)
