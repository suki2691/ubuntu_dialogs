2008-11-04T15:21:00.000Z	rww	jin_	because it's in the normal ubuntu repos... I only have main and universe active and it shows up for me =/
2008-11-04T15:22:00.000Z	jin_	rww	there is a big difference between the two. the one in medibuntu has X264 support
2008-11-04T15:22:00.000Z	rww	jin_	ah, okay. figured i was missing something :)
