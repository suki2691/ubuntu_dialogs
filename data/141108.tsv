After upgrade Ubuntu, the system cannot find th wifi signal anymore. I'm very worried if my wifi broke... ifconfig cannot detec wlan anymore. I tried livecd and it didnt detected wifi also. How can I know if I have to back to the store (until tomorrou) and change the laptop? (on #ubuntu-br a wifi card
