2006-04-05T07:35:00.000Z	nickrud	stewart	yeah, use the wiki, it worked on my card (not one of the most recent ones)
2006-04-05T07:36:00.000Z	nickrud	stewart	yes, I did. That's why I put up dapper in the first place
2006-04-05T07:38:00.000Z	nickrud	stewart	no, there were some issues with xv & xgl, some people said if they set their video out on mplayer or others to gl, it worked
