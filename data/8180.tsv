2012-05-28T22:53:00.000Z	EuroNerd		I want to install the full LAMP stack on my Ubuntu Desktop. Some web tutorials show how to install Apache, MySQL etc separately, some just show apt-get install lamp-server^.  Which one is a better idea?

2012-05-28T22:56:00.000Z	EuroNerd	ashickur-noor	thanks.  Some tutorials also show how to install LAMP with sth called "taskel". Is that better or worse?
