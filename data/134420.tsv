2007-05-14T05:16:00.000Z	gif89pro	d2812	no idea, haven't done it
2007-05-14T05:17:00.000Z	d2812	gif89pro	I'm fairly sure it does, which is why its not recommended afaik anyway
2007-05-14T05:18:00.000Z	gif89pro	d2812	ah, ok... i changed the root pwd right after install before i knew about "no root on ubuntu" mentality
