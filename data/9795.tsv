2012-09-29T21:14:00.000Z	yekoms	sambagirl	i would guess so.
2012-09-29T21:18:00.000Z	sambagirl	yekoms	no because  it loads my radio server and it takes over the audio with a different source so i cant access the audio like it normally would work so i have a work around by loading failsafe and then it doesnt load the radio station stuff and i can hear audio see?
