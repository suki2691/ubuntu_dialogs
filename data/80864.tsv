2008-11-09T19:30:00.000Z	bn43		hi I've got an opportunity to introduce linux to a user who is frustrated with the speed of xp with office2007 on his laptop
2008-11-09T19:31:00.000Z	bn43		I want to load linux but it needs to be lightning fast - he has a p4 with 256mb ram
2008-11-09T19:31:00.000Z	bn43		he only uses it for mail, opening office documents and internet
2008-11-09T19:31:00.000Z	outbackwifi	bn43	go with DSL not ubuntu
