2008-08-02T20:21:00.000Z	oompa_loompa		why does my compiz look so bad on hardy when it looked so good on its previous version, I have the same config, yet the graphics leave some sort of trail when I move the windows around :(
2008-08-02T20:21:00.000Z	oompa_loompa		any suggestions
2008-08-02T20:22:00.000Z	oompa_loompa		I thought this was an issue with hardy cause I just upgraded and nothing in my X has changed
2008-08-02T20:23:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	oompa_loompa	turn the trail off, probably that blur option
