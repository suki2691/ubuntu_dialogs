2009-11-01T03:00:00.000Z	jken146	paolo	It's not strange that an older kernel is not included in a new release.
2009-11-01T03:01:00.000Z	paolo	jken146	isn't it strange that in a new release only a single kernel is provided to users? if one has a problem with it, one cannot use ubuntu
2009-11-01T03:02:00.000Z	jken146	paolo	no, that's how ubuntu releases work.
