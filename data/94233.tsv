2008-05-12T05:55:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg		is it posible that i must recompile kernel to get longer life for my battery?
2008-05-12T05:56:00.000Z	kklimonda	cyber_brain_mfkg	no but it is posible that linux is just draining battery faster than windows. that's what my experience says.
2008-05-12T05:57:00.000Z	cyber_brain_mfkg	kklimonda	yes but it was ok with last linux installation wich i had to delete for some reasons!!!
