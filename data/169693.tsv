2006-11-16T13:57:00.000Z	macgyver187		I've been trying to install LinPhone and cant get past this configure message: "Could not find libreadline..." but its there
2006-11-16T13:58:00.000Z	ladydoor	macgyver187	you probably need to install libreadline-dev
2006-11-16T13:58:00.000Z	ladydoor	macgyver187	usually if there're complaints of missing libraries, it's the dev stuff that's missing
