2010-02-22T15:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	deena	I was able to successfully install Savage2 - 64bit yesterday -- don't know why you're getting that error, sorry
2010-02-22T15:33:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	deena	are you trying to use "sh Savage2Install-2.1.0.1-x86_64.bin"? as i get the same error if i try that!  "chmod +x Savage2Install-2.1.0.1-x86_64.bin" then just use "./Savage2Install-2.1.0.1-x86_64.bin"
2010-02-22T15:35:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	deena	you have 32bit not 64bit!!!
2010-02-22T15:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	deena	but you must have installed the 32bit version of Ubuntu
