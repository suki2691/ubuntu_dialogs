2008-09-11T01:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ConstyXIV	Not by default but it can be done
2008-09-11T01:37:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	Jordan_U	anything more than getting the latest source and make install?
2008-09-11T01:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ConstyXIV	That's probably the easiest way, there are .debs available for ath9k but they were made because people's hardware wasn't supported by madwifi but was by ath9k, so there is a chance debs for ath5k are available somewhere too but I doubt it
