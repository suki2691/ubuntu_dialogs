2010-09-18T08:57:00.000Z	snadg3		what is the default boot option for the ubuntu 10.04 usb install, if you leave it and dont do anything.. boot from hard disk?
2010-09-18T08:57:00.000Z	snadg3		i accidentally left my usb key in the drive on my machine at work, and i need to reboot it, i think it defaults to booting usb :/
2010-09-18T08:58:00.000Z	snadg3		i think usb might be higher priority than hard drive.. from memory, im not sure :/ thats why im wondering what the usb boot does by default if you dont select anything
2010-09-18T08:59:00.000Z	geoffmcc	snadg3	i think if it doesnt find something to boot it will move on to next
