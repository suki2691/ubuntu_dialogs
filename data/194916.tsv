2006-03-17T06:58:00.000Z	Xal_		I'm trying to reinstall grub with the settings I already have in ubuntu. I'm in a grub console off a recovery shell. What command do I need to use?
2006-03-17T06:59:00.000Z	Jimmey__	Xal_	setup (hd0,0)
2006-03-17T07:01:00.000Z	Xal_	Jimmey__	I tried that command and it says Invalid device requested.
