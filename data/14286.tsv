2011-05-14T17:26:00.000Z	_Abe_		I can run the xubuntu live environment from my usb stick just fine, but when I try to install, the installer just sits there.. Same thing if I choose to install @ boot time without going in to the live environment. I get the first question about what language, click on next/forward and bam... nothing happens :-/
2011-05-14T17:26:00.000Z	_Abe_		anyone else had this problem?
2011-05-14T17:27:00.000Z	bazhang	_Abe_	try #xubuntu
2011-05-14T17:27:00.000Z	_Abe_	bazhang	same thing with Ubuntu
