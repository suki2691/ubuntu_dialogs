2005-06-24T06:56:00.000Z	starla		I've suddenly run into problems burning cds in hoary.  I burned one cd successfully, and now ubuntu doesn't seem to recognize when i put in a new blank cd.  can someone help?
2005-06-24T06:57:00.000Z	starla		i tried using gnomebaker but the same thing happens.  It says 'please insert a blank cd' and then hangs until it crashes

2005-06-24T06:59:00.000Z	starla	concept10	i just successfully burned a cd a few seconds ago though.
