2009-10-22T21:08:00.000Z	Guest15392		Thank you Takeon. My first question: I have enabled Vsync in Ubuntu via Compiz, without it, the tearing was just too much. It's okay now, for the desktop, but I still have minimal tearing in videos - especially on a 26" fullhd. I have also enabled it in the nvidia-settings for both, opengl and video, those settings don't do anything at all. So, how can I enable full vsync for videos? My second question: I am using karmic beta right now, couldn't wait. C
