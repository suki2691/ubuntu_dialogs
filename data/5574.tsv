2012-02-15T00:30:00.000Z	sevith		I have an issue: I was to boot straight into the command line from ubuntu without a GUI. I have 10.04 server installed..Which i also installed xubuntu-destop. I have tried removing startup links but cant seems to find one that works. Now Im about to edit the grub files to see this approach will work. do i edit /etc/default and run update grup to add my options to all kernels that will be listed at boot? Or how does tis work :/
