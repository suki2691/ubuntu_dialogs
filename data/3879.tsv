2012-04-21T23:06:00.000Z	theadmin	Chloop	"root shell" or something like that is there, methinks it's the last option
2012-04-21T23:07:00.000Z	Chloop	theadmin	tried that before but it mounts filesystem as read-only?
2012-04-21T23:07:00.000Z	theadmin	Chloop	Is that a problem whatsoever? mount -o remount,rw /
