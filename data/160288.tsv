2006-11-10T12:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	t3m17	All I know is that shutdown isn't available becasue you are using seperate sessions and gnome can't access GDM ( so it is a problem that everyone with XGL installed as a session has including me ), I don't know if there is a way to fix it, but try #ubuntu-xgl
