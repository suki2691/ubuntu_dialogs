2011-09-27T07:35:00.000Z	papna		I'm using Natty and occasionally get a situation where clicking a different Window doesn't change focus. I can still alt-tab between the windows. I'm using the proprietary nvidia drivers and no visual effects, if that matters. Is anyone familiar with this problem?
2011-09-27T07:36:00.000Z	fritsch	papna	does you mouse stop working? or does clicking afterwards work again?
2011-09-27T07:36:00.000Z	papna	fritsch	The mouse is fine. I can click inside most windows. For example, I can highlight text in this terminal.
2011-09-27T07:37:00.000Z	fritsch	papna	ah okay, this is another problem i am not aware of
