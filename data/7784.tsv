2011-11-17T06:02:00.000Z	psychx-		I have a .run file that is not executing. I set it to be executable, but nothing is happening. It is actually TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_x86-3.0.1.run - Can someone help me to get this working?
2011-11-17T06:03:00.000Z	somsip_	psychx-	how are you executinjg it?
2011-11-17T06:06:00.000Z	psychx-	somsip_	Well, basically what I did was right click on the file, go to properties, and set it to be executable. Then I double click on the file (it's in my downloads folder in /home/) and it asks how I'd like to execute it. First I said in TErminal, because that's what it wanted to do anyway. That didn't work. Terminal didnt even open. Then I tried it again, and just did Execute. That didn't work either. I checked top, and didn't see it
2011-11-17T06:08:00.000Z	somsip_	psychx-	in a terminal 'sh TeamSpeak3...' what happens?
