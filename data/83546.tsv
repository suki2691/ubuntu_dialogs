2008-09-01T06:04:00.000Z	DaFFes		guys i can't use flash applications with sound in firefox and play music or video in my computer at the same time, if i try i need to close firefox to function again. Do you think its problem of the flash plugin or the audio driver?
2008-09-01T06:06:00.000Z	qr	DaFFes	are you using pulseaudio?
2008-09-01T06:07:00.000Z	qr	DaFFes	ahh, well I've had similar problems using pulseaudio, but if you're not using it I don't know what it could be
2008-09-01T06:08:00.000Z	qr	DaFFes	I ran pulseaudio as a system wide daemon as opposed to seperately for each user.
