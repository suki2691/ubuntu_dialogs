2008-04-27T03:33:00.000Z	mcquaid		i'm searching the forums, and seeing mention of grip, but it hasn't been updating since 05.  What's considered the best cd audio ripper?
2008-04-27T03:34:00.000Z	mcquaid		wasn't aware k3b could rip.  i'm looking for a standalone gui
2008-04-27T03:34:00.000Z	mcquaid		i guess i'll try grip. just curious if there's anything more current
