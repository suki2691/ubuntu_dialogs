2006-09-05T06:13:00.000Z	redblades		Hi, I have a stack of brand new Imation 4.7 GB DVDs that neither K3B nor Gnomebaker can burn too.
2006-09-05T06:13:00.000Z	redblades		Has anyone encountered such an issue, and/or know of a way to fix it?
2006-09-05T06:14:00.000Z	maple2	redblades	wait until 2030 when k3b supports them
2006-09-05T06:14:00.000Z	redblades	maple2	it already does... ?
