2012-04-23T01:42:00.000Z	Emery	maheanuu	Skype for Linux is buggy anyway. Try removing skype and re-installing (fixed it for me)
2012-04-23T01:43:00.000Z	maheanuu	Emery	It ran beautifully for me before, and after having a hdd and cd rom failure and loosing everything on the machine I finally got it up running again and I only install Skype, I am allergic to Windoze
