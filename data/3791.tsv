2012-04-24T13:48:00.000Z	jackbrownhf		hey why command "rm *.exe" doesn't work for removing all exe file of the directory i'm in ?
2012-04-24T13:50:00.000Z	the-erm	jackbrownhf	perhaps there are files called something.EXE -- it's case sensitive.
2012-04-24T13:50:00.000Z	the-erm		you can ls *.exe to get a list of the files.
2012-04-24T13:50:00.000Z	jackbrownhf	the-erm	yes but i want to remove all .exe files from that  directory using ONE command
