2007-02-16T14:36:00.000Z	Vilhelms		Is it normal for running a game on a separate X display to decrease performance? I read that as a tip to increase performance but iits doing the exact opposite.
2007-02-16T14:37:00.000Z	IcemanV9	Vilhelms	it supposes to improve the performance; i tried to do it on my box, it doesn't work correctly :(
2007-02-16T14:38:00.000Z	Vilhelms	IcemanV9	same here :(.. well the reason I want to do it is so I can run it in XGL, and I figured XGL was ruining the performance but I tried it w/o XGL and it still ran bad
2007-02-16T14:39:00.000Z	IcemanV9	Vilhelms	i ought to try it again since it has been a while
