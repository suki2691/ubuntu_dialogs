2012-02-08T03:11:00.000Z	rubst3r		hey rick, never mind i think i know what the problem might be... installing intel version on a AMD lol!!! just figured out
2012-02-08T03:13:00.000Z	rubst3r		yes i download xubuntu from the official site but i download the version that says PC (Intel x86) desktop CD instead of 64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop CD could that be the problem???
