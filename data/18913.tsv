2012-05-11T18:43:00.000Z	shazzr		I'm upgrading my server. Should I go for 64 bit or 32? I feel I'm "safer" with 32 regarding software support...but then again...64 bit is possibly more future oriented?

2012-05-13T14:54:00.000Z	shazzr	MonkeyDust	Good info, but sadly it won't help me boot my computer. The funny thing is that I had it running fine with an earlier version of Ubuntu.
