2006-10-01T16:41:00.000Z	GStubbs43		Hey, just wondering, does anyone here use gnome and KDE? (sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop) Or would that probably break my computer? :)
2006-10-01T16:41:00.000Z	kjm	GStubbs43	- I've installed kubuntu-desktop, xubuntu-desktop with out any problems.
2006-10-01T16:41:00.000Z	kjm	GStubbs43	- so dive right in.
2006-10-01T16:43:00.000Z	kjm	GStubbs43	- one thing with installing kubuntu-desktop - it will ask you if you wish to use gdm or kdm for graphical login.  It is probably safer to keep with GDM.  But, kdm probably works just fine as well.
