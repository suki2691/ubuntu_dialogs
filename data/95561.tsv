2009-09-23T18:35:00.000Z	bloopletech		If I'm on hardy, how do I install a package from 'karmic' with apt-get?
2009-09-23T18:35:00.000Z	bloopletech		Well I want the version of nginx provided in karmic, not the version provided in hardy
2009-09-23T18:36:00.000Z	bloopletech		Fine, I'll just apply the configure line karmic uses to my source dist of nginx and compile that
