2008-08-10T06:25:00.000Z	dr_Willis	yuji	 you can always some how 'mount' the remote servers directorys/shares locally and use whatver you want.
2008-08-10T06:25:00.000Z	dr_Willis	yuji	 many editors support the 'direct editing' of remote files over ftp/ssh/other methods as well
2008-08-10T06:25:00.000Z	yuji	dr_Willis	do they? Time to dig around, thank you (i needed some keywords to look for =P)
