2005-05-21T15:04:00.000Z	nekohayo		hi, I'd like to have a few pointers.. for some reason, my hoary box will play M$ MPEG-4v2 files fine (audio/video), but not ISO MPEG-4 (divx, ffmpeg)s.... I have the sound, but no video
2005-05-21T15:04:00.000Z	nekohayo		I tried searching for a particular divx issue but to no avail
2005-05-21T15:04:00.000Z	nekohayo		it's puzzling me a little
