2009-11-02T18:48:00.000Z	Jonathan_L1		I've got Ubuntu 8.10 and wanna upgrade to 9.10 - I've got it on a disc. What should I do first? the update manager only mentions 9.04
2009-11-02T18:48:00.000Z	Jonathan_L1		Should I install from the CD?
2009-11-02T18:49:00.000Z	JordanC	Jonathan_L1	Would be easier to just back up your stuff, then install 9.10 over the entire partition again
2009-11-02T18:51:00.000Z	Jonathan_L1	JordanC	I've got /home on a seperate partition and have used dpkg to make a list of my installed packages - then what? Should I just go on and reinstall?
