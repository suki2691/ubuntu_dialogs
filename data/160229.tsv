2011-01-28T02:39:00.000Z	philip_		How do I create a USB installer of a ISO bootable file?
2011-01-28T02:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	philip_	It depends on the iso. Not all isos can be made to boot via USB drive.

2011-05-10T09:31:00.000Z	philip_	Jordan_U	i know that, and i'm sorry. We suppose to help each other.
