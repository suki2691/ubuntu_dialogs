2012-09-04T13:47:00.000Z	Auzy	fred-fri	Maybe best to ask in #linuxmint.. but, path when and where?
2012-09-04T13:47:00.000Z	Auzy	fred-fri	Dunno, but maybe .bash_profile?
2012-09-04T13:47:00.000Z	fred-fri	Auzy	i have a program which is located in folder x, i want to add folder x to path so i can access it without its "address" in bash
