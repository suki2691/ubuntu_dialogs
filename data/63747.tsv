2009-03-08T05:32:00.000Z	armence		So, more generally, how do I execute a .bin file?
2009-03-08T05:33:00.000Z	ajehals	armence	make it executable with chmod and then execute it - open a terminal and type in the filename...
2009-03-08T05:33:00.000Z	ajehals	armence	 - is this the java installer? - because there are comprehensive instructions on the sun site for that.
2009-03-08T05:34:00.000Z	armence	ajehals	I didn't see those instructions... thanks though
