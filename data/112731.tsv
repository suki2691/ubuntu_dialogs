2007-11-26T04:19:00.000Z	octete		Hi guys, for a Intel Core 2 Duo, is it better to install the 386 version or the amd64? (I am worried about compatibility issues or lack of some packages for amd64)
2007-11-26T04:21:00.000Z	octete		yeah, core duo is 64 bit
2007-11-26T04:22:00.000Z	Tidus	octete	core 1 duo isn't 64 bit.  core 2 duo is
2007-11-26T04:22:00.000Z	octete	Tidus	sorry, I forgot to put the "2" there, I have the Core 2 Duo, but thanks anyway, I am going to stick to i386 as I don't want any compatibility issues
