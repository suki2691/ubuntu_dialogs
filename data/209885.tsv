2008-03-31T01:50:00.000Z	AdrianStrays		I have a question.  How do I upgrade from Gusty to Hardy once Hardy is fully released? Do I have to download an ISO again, or can I upgrade inside Gusty?
2008-03-31T01:50:00.000Z	LjL	AdrianStrays	you can upgrade
2008-03-31T01:51:00.000Z	LjL	AdrianStrays	not necessarily, actually it might still break completely before the final release
2008-03-31T01:52:00.000Z	LjL	AdrianStrays	stop working, stop being able to install/upgrade things
