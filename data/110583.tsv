2008-01-18T03:06:00.000Z	shoeunited		Hello, I've checked Power Management setting in Gutsy, and My computer keeps going into idle mode for my projector.  Is there some other way to keep it from going into idle?
2008-01-18T03:07:00.000Z	white_eagle	shoeunited	the problem is in screensaver
2008-01-18T03:07:00.000Z	shoeunited	white_eagle	I have it set to never go into idle :/
2008-01-18T03:08:00.000Z	shoeunited	white_eagle	Specifically I have Activate screensaver on idle unchecked and have the slider bar for idle set to 2 hours.  This idle happens after 5-10 minutes.
