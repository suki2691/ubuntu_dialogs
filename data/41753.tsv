2009-11-29T23:17:00.000Z	patricidio		I'm using ubuntu 9.10, and have just installed amarok 1.4 as explained in http://www.dwasifar.com/?p=849
2009-11-29T23:17:00.000Z	patricidio		during the install, I've noticed that one of the suggested packages is amarok14-engines, but it doesn't exist, is that a problem?
