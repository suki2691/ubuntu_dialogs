2010-12-25T08:19:00.000Z	KM0201	Baxnie	how did you install the driver?
2010-12-25T08:20:00.000Z	Baxnie	KM0201	i've installed ubuntu 10.04, everything was working fine, then i upgraded to 10.10, it stopped working, i had recommended drivers
2010-12-25T08:21:00.000Z	KM0201	Baxnie	hmm... no idea on that one... sorry... sounds like the upgrade didn't go as well as planned though
