2011-03-09T08:10:00.000Z	Trab		I have a question...if I have a monitor that isn't positioned correctly (CRT monitor) is there an easy way to get it to auto-adjust from say the commandline?
2011-03-09T08:10:00.000Z	Trab		I've tried googling like crazy. it's a stupid old emac that my friend is running.
