2011-09-18T22:03:00.000Z	aperture		on a computer was a windows xp install and a windows 7 install. The windows 7 install had a virus, and after some failures now the MBR is messed up. So, booting into 10.04 disc (checksummed and all) leads to it constantly crashing. Occasionally it gets into steps for installing. But once it hits step 3, it will crash. So. How can I wipe the harddrive and put ubuntu on there?
