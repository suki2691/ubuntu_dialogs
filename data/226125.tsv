2010-02-19T11:51:00.000Z	geeksatlarge		I can't 'su root'.  I'm running Ubuntu in Sun VirtualBox.  During the install, I was not prompted to setup a root account.  Therefore when Ubuntu came up I didn't have a root password.  Now I can't access root through the shell.  Is there something I don't know about?
