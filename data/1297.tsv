2012-09-01T23:41:00.000Z	HenriqueGogs		know how to install Unity on Debian?
2012-09-01T23:42:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	HenriqueGogs	no, this is not #debian anyway
2012-09-01T23:42:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	HenriqueGogs	also it's a Canonical project for Ubuntu, why would you want it on Debian when there aren't any dedicated devs on the Debian team for it anyway?
2012-09-01T23:44:00.000Z	HenriqueGogs	WarOfTheNerd	i just wanna try on my debian desktop, but thanks, I'm asking on #debian
