2008-07-06T18:29:00.000Z	mcf3782		I've downloaded the 8.04 ISO and burned it to disk. It boots with no probelm, but when I get to the disk partitioning point; it's identifying the internal hard drive as "sda".  I can't seem to partition an "sda".
2008-07-06T18:29:00.000Z	mcf3782		Every other distribution I've ever loaded identifies this drive as "hda".

2008-07-06T18:30:00.000Z	joaopinto	mcf3782	what is the specific problem that you have when partitioning ?
