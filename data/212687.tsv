2012-11-25T17:26:00.000Z	espnu		hey, i wonder what the current situation of TRIM activated partitions in ubuntu 12.10 / upcoming 13.04 is?
2012-11-25T17:27:00.000Z	espnu		in 12.04 i had to use a discard option to my harddrive partition. is this something that i'll have to do in 12.10 and probly 13.04?
