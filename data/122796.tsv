This is the only computer the school is going to get so I won't need networking. Would edubuntu work (Preferably LTS) or should I go for xubuntu? Perhaps another flavor of linux? What would you reccomend?

2007-09-08T12:00:00.000Z	dudeicles	MartinW	NP I'll see if I can find somewhere that tells you.
