2010-09-07T05:01:00.000Z	rsvp	latagore	was your USB drive formatted as ext4 ?
2010-09-07T05:02:00.000Z	latagore	rsvp	No, I think it was NTFS
2010-09-07T05:05:00.000Z	latagore	rsvp	Why does it matter?
2010-09-07T05:08:00.000Z	rsvp	latagore	just wondering that myself! because if the bios reads from the flash drive first, it must be able to handle FAT32, NTFS, or ext4 whatever well to do its bootup. -- maybe I am wrong... any correction appreciated.
