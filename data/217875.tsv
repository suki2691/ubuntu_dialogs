2011-05-02T07:39:00.000Z	bromide_bro		because this is an old asus netbook and it only has 2 gb of hdd
2011-05-02T07:39:00.000Z	Viking667	bromide_bro	and the deb packages expand to bigger than 600Mb when uncompressed
2011-05-02T07:40:00.000Z	Viking667	bromide_bro	what's on the CDROM is a single compressed filesystem, and the contents (usually) gets copied over uncompressed.
