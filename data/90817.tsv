2008-05-13T07:09:00.000Z	bluefoxx		how can i combine two boot disk ISOs? i want to combine a sisela boot disk with a super grub disk[to save CDs] command line is easier for me[though if i need programs i can do that /sigh]
2008-05-13T07:11:00.000Z	bluefoxx		noone knows how to combine bootable ISO disks?

2008-05-13T07:13:00.000Z	bluefoxx	rickJames	any how-tos on that?[@bazhang i know it's do-able cause i saw someone do this with ubuntu, kubuntu, xubuntu cds and the alt installers on a dvd once]
