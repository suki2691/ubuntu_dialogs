If a custom kernel is needed, that's not a problem, I've done it before, but would prefer to not have to maintain custom kernels for all of my ubuntu partitions. I share a /boot across all my linux partition

2007-04-25T07:04:00.000Z	disasm	mikere	okay, I'll try that, thanks
2007-04-25T07:04:00.000Z	disasm	mikere	now that you mention it, that does make sense, I rename my kernels in gentoo all the time ;-)
