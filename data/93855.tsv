2008-04-24T04:23:00.000Z	paul_colwell_		How to I reset the top menu (in GNOME)  The person who owns this computer has screwed it up and I can't seem to move the firefox, evolution, and help icons to the right at all so that I can stick the menus back there
2008-04-24T04:24:00.000Z	odder	paul_colwell_	did you try right-clicking the icons and unlocking them?
2008-04-24T04:24:00.000Z	paul_colwell_	odder	unlocking.  DOH!
