2007-01-31T14:40:00.000Z	dignomad		I have a question about installing Ubuntu.  I want a dual boot, along with my Windows XP install.  I already resized my old partition and created a 500mb swap partition, and a little over 19gb ex2 partition to stick ubuntu.  I'm on the mount point part of the install process, and am not sure what to do.

2007-01-31T14:43:00.000Z	Yashy	dignomad	you only mentioned 2 partitions you created
2007-01-31T14:44:00.000Z	Yashy	dignomad	if it's got windows on those two, leave them be and go to next
