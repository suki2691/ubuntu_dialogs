2005-10-19T10:19:00.000Z	niggpie		Ok i'm getting frustrated. Breezy doesn't like my ATI 9200SE. Can't boot into Ubuntu, all I get is a black screen and a mouse cursor. I can't use apt-get because I dont' have a wired internet connection. I tried apt-cdrom add to direct apt-get to the cdrom drive, but it can't find the xorg-driver-fglrx package i need to get the 9200 workin. Any ideas?
