2012-11-20T21:11:00.000Z	Phryq		hey, is there a way to run fluxbox other than with "startx" ?
2012-11-20T21:11:00.000Z	Phryq		or alternatively, a way to add a regular user account to run startx?
2012-11-20T21:12:00.000Z	escott	Phryq	do you really want a "fluxbox" session. like really truly want no session manager
2012-11-20T21:47:00.000Z	escott	Phryq	in that case i guess create an Xsession file in /etc/X11
