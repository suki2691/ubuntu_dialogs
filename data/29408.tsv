2010-07-06T03:36:00.000Z	TheSkeward		I'm new to linux, using 10.04,  and trying to get my wireless connection set up at my university.  I believe I have the driver for my adapter correctly installed, but when I follow the directions on the uni's "how to connect to the wireless network with ubuntu), it doesn't connect.  I have no idea what I'm missing.  Can anyone help me?
