2006-02-21T12:53:00.000Z	trappist	FlyingSquirrel32	mkdir a directory /etc/rc.boot if it doesn't exist and put a script in there
2006-02-21T13:17:00.000Z	FlyingSquirrel32	trappist	Regarding running on boot, is /etc/rc.boot a script or a directory containing scripts?
2006-02-21T13:22:00.000Z	trappist	FlyingSquirrel32	it's a directory containing scripts.
