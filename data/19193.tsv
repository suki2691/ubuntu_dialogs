2011-03-20T01:49:00.000Z	mitpatterson		actually all i want to install is the VMWare tools
2011-03-20T01:51:00.000Z	mitpatterson		anyways, my quick question, is i have the CD mounted, and one of the files is a "rpm" file, from what vmware's tools say you should just be able to double click the file, but when i do that it opens up the archive thingy
