2010-08-02T18:33:00.000Z	mutante		i had before: DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 8.04.4 LTS" , i followed the instructions labeled "Upgrade from 8.04 LTS to 10.04 LTS". Result is i have: "DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 8.10"  and the LTS disappeared. I am repeating  do-release-upgrade --proposed now. But i am afraid the "LTS" will be gone anyways..
2010-08-02T18:35:00.000Z	mutante		there is:  apt-get remove --purge
2010-08-02T18:35:00.000Z	FoolsRun	mutante	is that different from just apt-get purge ?
2010-08-02T18:36:00.000Z	mutante	FoolsRun	i dont know, i only knew the long version, and thought the latter doesnt exist
