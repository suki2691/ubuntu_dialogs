2008-02-26T19:10:00.000Z	xolve		I use Kubuntu 7.10. The problem is that if I leave my pc unattended for a few minutes the CPU usage goes to 100% (this I know through superkaramba theme) and the task bar becomes unresponsive - no tooltips, no clicks nothing. And adding to it what problems me most is that the system tray clock, superkaramba themes still show the output, the music in background still works and I can still move the mouse.
2008-02-26T19:10:00.000Z	xolve		I usually run amaroK, Kopete, superkaramba, konqueror and konsole. I have tried closing various applications but still the problem persists. Please Help.
