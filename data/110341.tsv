I have a question concerning a Linux starter package of some sort a co-worker of mine picked up for an experiment involving possible compatability of a business application with WINE.  This starter package of his is labelled "The Linux Starter Pack" and comes with some kind of cruddy manual.  I am a Gentoo user at home myself, and I'm just wondering if anyone knows what the root password is for this dern thing.  That it doesn't
