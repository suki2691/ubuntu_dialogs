2008-11-10T06:41:00.000Z	colton		Hi, how could I run a program in the console if I dont know its name?
2008-11-10T06:41:00.000Z	colton		For instance "f-spot photo manager" how in the world could I find the name that I would type in?
2008-11-10T06:42:00.000Z	colton		is it like: "fspotphotoManager" or fspot manager
2008-11-10T06:42:00.000Z	obiwan177	colton	i would try something like "fspot"
