2008-07-04T08:53:00.000Z	alphabeta		so I'm trying to get my ubuntu install to dualboot with vista, but whenever I try to boot vista from grub the screen just sticks at "Starting up ..."
2008-07-04T08:54:00.000Z	alphabeta		does anyone know how I could get vista to boot? vistas bootloader was overwritten by grub (obviously), and I'd like to keep grub as the master
2008-07-04T08:55:00.000Z	ubunubi	alphabeta	there are a ton of guides for dual booting vista with ubuntu. www.google.com
2008-07-04T08:56:00.000Z	alphabeta	ubunubi	tried them all.. (not that they don't all say the same thing).  Haven't found anyone with my problem.. seen BSOD's, and grub boot errors, but never just "Starting up ..." forever
