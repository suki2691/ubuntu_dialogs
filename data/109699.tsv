2008-01-30T05:46:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	benanzo	you can manually set the proxy settings in preferences
2008-01-30T05:47:00.000Z	benanzo	jeffMASTERflex	yes that's what I've done but just thought I bring it up since it's supposed to honor gnome's global proxy config
2008-01-30T05:48:00.000Z	jeffMASTERflex	benanzo	submit the bug report and hopefully they will look into it. i don't use any proxies so can't really verify it
