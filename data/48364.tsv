2009-09-18T03:18:00.000Z	tessier		Is it true that Ubuntu does not set a root password and makes you use sudo? Do most server admins set a root password anyway or do you actually just operate on sudo alone?

2009-09-18T03:20:00.000Z	tessier	tohuw	ssh keys so that they can ssh in as root? That's a good idea.
