2010-01-07T21:03:00.000Z	monokrome		Does anyone here know how I can install the Windows7 boot manager from within Ubuntu?
2010-01-07T21:04:00.000Z	Jonathan_L	monokrome	Why? And only in VirtualBox as far as I know
2010-01-07T21:05:00.000Z	monokrome	Jonathan_L	Thanks for the reference to VirtualBox. I tried VMWare but couldn't get it running.
2010-01-07T21:17:00.000Z	monokrome	Jonathan_L	Do you know how to get out of the VBox window? I'm stuck in it on my computer :(
