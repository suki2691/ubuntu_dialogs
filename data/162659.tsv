2006-12-17T12:56:00.000Z	errorlevel		If I remove ubuntu-desktop, will all the packages that it pulled in still be installed?  I want to remove gnome-btdownload so that I can remove bittorrent and install the .deb file from bittorrent.com.  I just don't want to make anything harder on myself for when it comes time to upgrade.

2006-12-17T12:57:00.000Z	PriceChild	errorlevel	ubuntu-desktop is just a meta-package... make sure you install it before upgrades to newer versions, e.g. dapper_.edgy
2006-12-17T12:57:00.000Z	errorlevel	PriceChild	Okay.
