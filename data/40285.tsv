2010-11-24T19:12:00.000Z	mawst		Anyone know how to rename bad files within a rar archive? File Roller's rename menu item is greyed out, and I can't extract the files because of weird filenames
2010-11-24T19:13:00.000Z	st__	mawst	you should have no problems with filenames
2010-11-24T19:13:00.000Z	st__	mawst	is it encrypted archive?
2010-11-24T19:14:00.000Z	st__	mawst	try unrar in console
