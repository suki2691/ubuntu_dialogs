2009-03-28T21:00:00.000Z	Oizo		Hi there, id like to "uninstall" my ubuntu, delete the ext3+swap partition i used for it, and make a new ntfs partition out of the free space, so i can install ubuntu in a virtual machine. Yet i find no way to get that space to NTFS, anyone able to help?

2009-03-28T21:01:00.000Z	iceroot	Oizo	you want to install windows or why need ntfs?
2009-03-28T21:01:00.000Z	iceroot	Oizo	then use the vista partiton manager to create ntfs
