2007-08-11T08:06:00.000Z	yadah		Getting updates with old kernel seems useless
2007-08-11T08:06:00.000Z	Pelo	yadah	  security patches for lts are stil supplied , that is why it is called lts
2007-08-11T08:10:00.000Z	Pelo	yadah	basicaly all distros get security patches , but they donT, get software upgrades, and the lts release gets patches for a longer time,  the others only for 18 monts I beleive,  the defierence from release to release if you don'T get  version upgrades for apps,  ie if you have office 2.2 you stick to office 2.2, you don'T get bumped up to 2.3 when it comes out
