2010-11-17T10:58:00.000Z	clu3		my downloaded  .iso has correct checksum and i've successfully burned to a CD but when i try to install it, i see the ubuntu trademark for a while before i see the error: "can not mount /dev/loop0" > I googled but found no answer yet. Someone pls help me?
2010-11-17T11:00:00.000Z	Balsaq	clu3	i had that problem with a xubuntu 1004 cd i burnt, never did figure it out, ended up burning it again at 8x speed and it worked.
