2010-10-13T19:17:00.000Z	Loonatic		Hi there, anyone could tell me what would be the easiest way to have my webserver (apache) ask for a password on a specific folder only for external traffic, i want to local people (192.168.1.*) to be able to browse the folder without entering passwords ?

2010-10-13T19:18:00.000Z	Loonatic	undecim	i tried to play with .htaccess too but with no luck, so then i think it's back to reading about .htaccess
