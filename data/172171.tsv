2007-07-03T07:00:00.000Z	zenmonk		what about ext2fsd or fs-driver for windows?  does anyone know about or use that?
2007-07-03T07:00:00.000Z	jrib	zenmonk	fd-driver has worked fine for me in the past
2007-07-03T07:01:00.000Z	zenmonk	jrib	is there any advantage to picking fat32 or ext2 then?
2007-07-03T07:02:00.000Z	jrib	zenmonk	ext2 will be able to retain unix permissions
