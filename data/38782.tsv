2012-06-02T02:32:00.000Z	aszurom		Every time I try to convert to Linux, I fall over a showstopper hardware issue.  Today, it's wifi.  HP Elitebook vs Netgear N router. Just will NOT connect to the damn thing.  Worked great at the office all day on my Apple Airport though
2012-06-02T02:33:00.000Z	aszurom		anyone feel like sharing my pain?

2012-06-02T02:37:00.000Z	aszurom	skarufue	- lspci is a good start.  I couldn't remember the command, thanks.
