2008-06-08T10:52:00.000Z	Starnestommy	UbuntuNix	probably because you told it to do that, or it thinks that there are errors and it needs to correct them
2008-06-08T10:53:00.000Z	Starnestommy	UbuntuNix	does it always do that?
2008-06-08T10:53:00.000Z	Starnestommy	UbuntuNix	go into recovery mode, then run fsck
