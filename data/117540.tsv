2007-10-11T06:56:00.000Z	dremth		does anyone know why ubuntu has been freezing up lately? if i try to open a terminal, the terminal freezes (same with gedit and sometimes nautilus), then the desktop freezes after i force quit, and then i have to restart the x server. then when im back at the login, i type my user and password and when it should be the splash screen, it's just black. then i have to restart to login again.
