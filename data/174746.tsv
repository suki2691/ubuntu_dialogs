2006-08-28T09:51:00.000Z	sethk	sepehre	that's the default behavior
2006-08-28T09:52:00.000Z	sepehre	sethk	not for me, it's in text mode for some reason
2006-08-28T09:52:00.000Z	sethk	sepehre	there may be a parameter setting it to text mode that has to be removed.  but there isn't a parameter to set graphics mode.
