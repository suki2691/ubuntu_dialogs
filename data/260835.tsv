2006-06-01T10:05:00.000Z	Elops		I have Ubuntu and no Internet connection. (now doesn't count ;) I wonder if I would solve my dependencies problems (I always need lib this and that...) if I would just get all the Debian CDs and add them into Synaptic. Is this software compatible with Ubuntu? Should be, ah?
2006-06-01T10:06:00.000Z	Elops		?
2006-06-01T10:08:00.000Z	Elops		Ubuntu and Debian are NOT binary-compatible?
2006-06-01T10:08:00.000Z	paulproteus	Elops	They're not dependency-compatible.
