2007-10-13T14:45:00.000Z	New_linux_dummie		simple question, I'm trying to set up a LAMP server using ubunto and would like to know if there is a GUI command I can use from the command prompt
2007-10-13T14:46:00.000Z	New_linux_dummie		I've installed it, that was easy, no, it's installed but I only get the command prompt
2007-10-13T14:48:00.000Z	New_linux_dummie		mostly to configure it, but I can't seem to find the right files under the command prompt (still relitivly new to linux as well, very basic experience, although I've found it's much like dos)
2007-10-13T14:48:00.000Z	tomd	New_linux_dummie	try typing startx at the command prompt and tell me what it says
