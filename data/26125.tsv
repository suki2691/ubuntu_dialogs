2010-09-16T19:10:00.000Z	erickj92		hello, I recently installed Ubuntu onto a USB flash drive. When i disconnect the USB flash drive I get the "error: no such device: ####. grub rescue>". Is there an easy way to prevent this from happening? I want to use my computer without having to keep the flash drive plugged in. Please help!
