2011-02-17T01:34:00.000Z	danub		i was in here yesterday and someone was trying to update their server but they had a LTS version and their updates would only update to the newest LTS. Someone said to change a value from 'lts' to 'normal' where is that change supposed to be made? (my system only went to 10.04, not 10.10 and i think this may be the reason)
2011-02-17T01:35:00.000Z	danub		what about it isn't working zkriesse ?
2011-02-17T01:35:00.000Z	zkriesse	danub	Isn't copying and then moving the file
2011-02-17T01:36:00.000Z	danub	zkriesse	are you sure the files exist?
