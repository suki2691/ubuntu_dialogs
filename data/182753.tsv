2008-11-03T08:05:00.000Z	Pelo	Caithness	reinstall grub
2008-11-03T08:07:00.000Z	Pelo	Caithness	after the bios stuff is down but before windows boot will give you a boot menu for windows but this does not include any other os,  just different boot options for windows,  like failsafe , or if you press f8 at boot , on some computers  it will give you the option to boot from a specific storage device
2008-11-03T08:08:00.000Z	Pelo	Caithness	 I recommend you reinstall intrepid, from the live cd , not from webui or some such , it should install grub and let you select the proper os you want to boot
