2012-06-22T14:16:00.000Z	busfahrer	skramer_	Yeah I know about that workaround. I don't want to set the setting each time. No fix?
2012-06-22T14:17:00.000Z	skramer_	busfahrer	unfortunately not. But do you have to set these settings each time you log in?
2012-06-22T14:18:00.000Z	skramer_	busfahrer	myself, I found that it sometimes works without problems & sometimes I need the workaround...
