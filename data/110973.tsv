2010-06-10T00:36:00.000Z	etrask		Hello, I am having a problem with the Gnome terminal, and vi in particular. It seems the keymap is not what it should be, becasue vi is doing some funny things. The right arrow key inserts a capital C and a newline, backspace simply moves the cursor left, etc

2010-06-10T00:36:00.000Z	etrask	h00k	thank you! I cant work without vi of course
2010-06-10T00:37:00.000Z	h00k	etrask	no problem :)
