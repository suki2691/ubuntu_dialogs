2008-10-08T21:52:00.000Z	Zappza		I installed ubuntu to my memory stick, and chose to install the bootloader on the memorystick itself, however it won't boot. Says something about not finding the file needed
2008-10-08T21:52:00.000Z	Zappza		Can get the exact message if wanted
2008-10-08T21:53:00.000Z	_Zeus_	Zappza	i think we need the actual error
