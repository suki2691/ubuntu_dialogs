2006-07-24T15:51:00.000Z	siennalizard	ardchoille	best not to.
2006-07-24T15:51:00.000Z	siennalizard	ardchoille	why do you want to? to script it?
2006-07-24T15:52:00.000Z	ardchoille	siennalizard	I have 6 users on this box setup on a user schedule, there are times that one user will refuse to log out so the next user can log in. I need to be able to log a user out whether they want to log out or not.
