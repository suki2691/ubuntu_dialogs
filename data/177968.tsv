2006-09-28T06:45:00.000Z	AnAnt		how can I configure the hardware clock to be GMT & the system clock to be according to my timezone ?
2006-09-28T06:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	AnAnt	right click clock and go to properties should do it
2006-09-28T06:48:00.000Z	AnAnt	Jack_Sparrow	1. I didn't get any properties (I use GNOME) 2. I tried time-admin
2006-09-28T06:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	AnAnt	preferences and adjust date and time?
