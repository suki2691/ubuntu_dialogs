2010-10-09T22:40:00.000Z	glebihan	sh4d3sl4y3r_	depends on the games, would try wine first
2010-10-09T22:40:00.000Z	sh4d3sl4y3r_	glebihan	say directx9 dependent ones instead of Opengl. like gta etc
2010-10-09T22:41:00.000Z	glebihan	sh4d3sl4y3r_	same answer, but you'll find out that a lot of games won't work either way
