2009-10-25T01:34:00.000Z	Tetracomm		I am using ext3 now.
2009-10-25T01:34:00.000Z	Tetracomm		Is it safe to convert my filesystem to ext4? and how good an idea is that?
2009-10-25T01:36:00.000Z	soldats	Tetracomm	the way i read about ext4 is that its workable if your willing to put up with stuff possibly not working, ive been told its more so still in later dev stages, but if you want back everything up and format it to ext4
2009-10-25T01:38:00.000Z	soldats	Tetracomm	yea you have to reformat it with a disk to ext4
