2009-10-16T04:15:00.000Z	LjL	PhantomLink	what do you mean by "type"? format?
2009-10-16T04:16:00.000Z	LjL	PhantomLink	that's not really grep's realm
2009-10-16T04:16:00.000Z	LjL	PhantomLink	besides, can't you use the extension (e.g. "*.pdf")? that'd be *much* faster than actually determining the file's type.
