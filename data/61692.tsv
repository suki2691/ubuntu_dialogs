2009-11-29T22:45:00.000Z	grawity	skeletal	if it's FAT32, fsck.vfat /dev/sdXY (where sdXY is the Windows partition)
2009-11-29T22:45:00.000Z	grawity	skeletal	If it's NTFS - fsck.ntfs-3g
2009-11-29T22:52:00.000Z	skeletal	grawity	Man, i have installed here the ntfs-3g tools, right? But, what i need for do my scan in windows?
