2007-08-20T07:20:00.000Z	Jaydoggg		I installed Fiesty on an old laptop that probably shouldnt be running it, How can I get some speed out of it now?
2007-08-20T07:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jaydoggg	Run something lighter... what are the specs on the laptop
2007-08-20T07:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jaydoggg	Double the ram would be the easiest
2007-08-20T07:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Jaydoggg	For the most part... yes
