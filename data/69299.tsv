2009-01-22T16:29:00.000Z	oCean_	metbsd	/etc/init.d/mysql restart
2009-01-22T16:31:00.000Z	oCean_	metbsd	what is reinitialize? Also, you might want to ask that in #mysql, since this is #ubuntu
2009-01-22T16:43:00.000Z	oCean_	metbsd	ok. Use "apt-get remove" (or purge) to uninstall. Then re-install it
