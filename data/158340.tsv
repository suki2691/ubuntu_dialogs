2009-07-16T18:51:00.000Z	Ozzah		Hi... I have kind of an odd problem. I need to erase ALL data on a hard drive - I mean literally everything, right down to the partition tables themselves. Any idea on how I can do this?
2009-07-16T18:51:00.000Z	Ozzah		I basically want to "initialize" the drive so that it's in the "as new" condition come out of the factory
2009-07-16T18:52:00.000Z	Slart	Ozzah	have a look at "wipe"
2009-07-16T18:53:00.000Z	Slart	Ozzah	it follows some standards when it comes to wiping stuff.. overwriting X number of times, random patterns etc etc
