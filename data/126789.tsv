2007-12-30T20:42:00.000Z	Karyom		Does someone now where I can find a OSX Dashbord like for Screenlets?!!
2007-12-30T20:43:00.000Z	Tilllinux	Karyom	try either cairo/kiba-dock or the gDesklet ones
2007-12-30T20:44:00.000Z	Tilllinux	Karyom	hm, they *workforme* but I don't use them ^^ cairo/kiba is a bit buggy but a very customizable one
