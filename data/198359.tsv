2006-11-01T07:49:00.000Z	LabThug		How come ubuntu always comes up as a misspelled word on Edgy?
2006-11-01T07:50:00.000Z	TomaszD	LabThug	because upstream didn't include that word in their spellcheck dictionaries
2006-11-01T07:51:00.000Z	LabThug	TomaszD	while I realize it's a "small nit,"  I don't think it bodes well for ubuntu
2006-11-01T07:51:00.000Z	TomaszD	LabThug	agree. Still there are more important issues...
