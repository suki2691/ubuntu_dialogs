2006-06-30T06:39:00.000Z	ccooke	fyrestrtr	not *Strictly* true. They're releasing the Core 2, which is the first (!) cpu based on the Core Microarchitecture... (Not being confusing *At all*, there)
2006-06-30T06:40:00.000Z	ccooke	fyrestrtr	I'm hoping Core 2 will put them back into competition - it keeps the chip market interesting actually having *two* companies releasing great stuff
2006-06-30T06:40:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	ccooke	yeah, but for the average computer user, it really doesn't matter as long as they can type on Word and play solitaire :)
