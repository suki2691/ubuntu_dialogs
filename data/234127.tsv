2005-06-03T13:35:00.000Z	nihao		I use Ubuntu, but I'd like to try KDE. I installed KDE desktop using synaptic. Now, how to select KDE as the effective desktop manager?
2005-06-03T13:36:00.000Z	mcquaid	nihao	you can select it in gdm when you login you can choose kde instead of gnome and it'll ask you if u want to make it your default
2005-06-03T13:36:00.000Z	mcquaid		you choose sessions in gdm to select which to use
2005-06-03T13:37:00.000Z	nihao	mcquaid	so the KDE option will be automatically added in GDM menu?
