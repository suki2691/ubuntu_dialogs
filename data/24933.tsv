2010-10-10T21:50:00.000Z	jazzfish		folks - while organizing my music I am trying to delete a directory which has a file in it that prevents it from being deleted...  I cannot delete this file: .fuse_hidden00021d6000000005 - doesn't look very good - any suggestions on how I may be able to blow this away?

2010-10-10T21:50:00.000Z	Stormx2	jazzfish	then re-mount and try again
2010-10-10T21:52:00.000Z	jazzfish	Stormx2	I can't unmount the partition that Ubuntu is running on - dual boot doze
