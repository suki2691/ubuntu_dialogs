2010-08-27T22:34:00.000Z	GORE-Daddy_		Can someone advise me on the following:  The upgrade manager says that "New distribution release '10.04.01 LTS is availbable"  and "Upgrade" in the radio button.  When I start the upgrade I get the message AMD fglrx driver not supported.  You will loose desktop quality, etc.  Is this a problem and should I go ahead and upgrade?:
