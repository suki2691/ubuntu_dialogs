2008-12-10T06:36:00.000Z	lorenzo		hi, is there any way I can make the volume out of my laptop louder? Often even if I crank the master up to max, volume is still to low on my ibex. Maybe it's me going deaf but I was just wondering, maybe i can get a bit extra gain and pull it up a tad. Thanks a lot everybody
