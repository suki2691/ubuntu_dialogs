2010-09-25T09:35:00.000Z	jdsfojidf		I have 2 OS' installed. W7 and Ubuntu. Can I increase Ubuntu's partition to completely remove windows 7 and use that space without losing any personal data on my ubuntu partition?
2010-09-25T09:36:00.000Z	jdsfojidf		Excellent. Do you know of a particular program you'd recommend to do this?
2010-09-25T09:37:00.000Z	jdsfojidf		I see, thanks. Guess I need to buy some more blank DVD's. Thanks for the help.
