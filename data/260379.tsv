2005-04-29T16:58:00.000Z	CellarDoor		I'm using kubuntu here (no ones talking in #kubuntu atm) and I'm trying to shut down X so I can install my nvidia driver, but it keeps restarting X everytime I do ctrl-alt-backspace... anyone know what to do ?
2005-04-29T16:59:00.000Z	CellarDoor		I've asked in #kubuntu but no ones chatting, so I thought I'd ask in here
