2011-05-28T05:09:00.000Z	woodworks		i'm running 10.10 on a 1 meg laptop, would it be advantageous to run Xubuntu to save resources and can i do so without losing everything i have on the system currently?
2011-05-28T05:09:00.000Z	woodworks		oops. 1 meg s/b 1 gig
2011-05-28T05:09:00.000Z	bazhang	woodworks	not much difference; lubuntu-desktop would show it though
2011-05-28T05:10:00.000Z	bazhang	woodworks	install the package lubuntu-desktop and choose at login window
