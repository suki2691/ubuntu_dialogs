2010-12-14T07:51:00.000Z	dork	sbeck	lsof
2010-12-14T07:52:00.000Z	dork	sbeck	read the manual for lsof or assume the file isn't being used?
2010-12-14T07:57:00.000Z	sbeck	dork	for one file lsof shows it, for another one it doesn't. But I know it's the same program as I opened the two files in okular.
