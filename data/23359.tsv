2010-10-29T22:08:00.000Z	Alphanaut		hey all, i have ubuntu 10.10 dual boot on my laptop.  when i first installed during boot i get a nice ubuntu logo with the activity dots moving under it.  every time i install my video card driver (nvidia) that boot logo changes to an oldschool looking terminal text of "UBUNTU 10.10"
2010-10-29T22:08:00.000Z	Alphanaut		why would the logo change?
2010-10-29T22:09:00.000Z	mrnelson1986	Alphanaut	nvidia drivers change it because the ubuntu logo that looks nice is activated using nouveau drivers by default, with nvidia enabled the nouveau are disabled
2010-10-29T22:10:00.000Z	mrnelson1986	Alphanaut	at least in my experience that is....if you find a solution i'd love to know it as well :)
