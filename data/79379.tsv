2010-08-15T23:19:00.000Z	cesc_		hey again. I just finally installed the drivers for my usb wireless adapter (Alfa Network AWUS036H) following janisozaur instructions. I just rebooted the machine after following readme instructions... but there is no wireless extensions when I type iwconfig
2010-08-15T23:19:00.000Z	cesc_		now I'm wired connected to the internet.
2010-08-15T23:21:00.000Z	cesc_		anyone know how to check if the driver I installed is loaded in my kernel?
