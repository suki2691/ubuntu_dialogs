2010-04-21T23:53:00.000Z	Spasysheep		9.10 'karmic' I have two network connections, wlan0 and eth0; I want to share the internet connection from wlan0 to eth0 so a computer without wifi can get internet, without this computer losing it's internet connection. All the guides I can find on the internet on how to do this serve only to break all my connectivity. Help?
