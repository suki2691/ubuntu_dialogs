2007-03-31T12:25:00.000Z	chazco		another question - every so often my Gnome menu will stop working... e.g. i click an option on the menu, or press the shutdown icon, and nothing happens... any ideas?
2007-03-31T12:26:00.000Z	chazco		the menu opens up but actual items dont do anything
2007-03-31T12:26:00.000Z	chazco		the menus occassionally have unexpalined scroll icons on it...
2007-03-31T12:26:00.000Z	Nookie^	chazco	it happens to me also when i install some new application
