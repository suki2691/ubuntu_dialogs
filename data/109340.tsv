2008-03-27T08:42:00.000Z	ghostnob		the documentaiton says ns.example.com.... my domain is haryoh.com; would I have to use my nameservers where it says @      IN     NS     ns.example.com? this is my first trial in setting up a public server, whatever mistake I make now, will help me when I want to set it up in future... HELP please...
