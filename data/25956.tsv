2010-09-18T20:43:00.000Z	ellie		I've got a serious problem...I've 10.04 Lucid Lynx, and sometimes (too often now) it freezes, and the only thing I can do is to press the on/off button to restart...can somebody help me?
2010-09-18T20:43:00.000Z	annon	ellie	which graphic card have you got?
2010-09-18T20:44:00.000Z	annon	ellie	I'm just asking, because I had the same problem with an ATI graphic card. the drivers where somehow faulty. but there could also be a multitude of other causes.
