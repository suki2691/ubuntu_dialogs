2009-05-13T22:25:00.000Z	bobbydigitales_		I'm trying to upgrade a deskktop machine from Hardy to Jaunty, I'm using "sudo do-release-upgrade", but it says, "No new release found", what am I doing wrong?
2009-05-13T22:26:00.000Z	jdu	bobbydigitales_	you need to specify that you are willing to upgrade to not LTS releases.
2009-05-13T22:30:00.000Z	jdu	bobbydigitales_	you do realize that you are going to have to do two upgrades to get from hardy to jaunty and that may leave a degree of cruft?
