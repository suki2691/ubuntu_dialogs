2008-04-05T18:33:00.000Z	arejay	IndyGunFreak	i just clicked advanced right before it was about to install. it gave me the option
2008-04-05T18:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	arejay	well, then change it, i was thinking you could only do it w/ alt. install, but this may be problematic, as grub won't load when the computer turns on.
