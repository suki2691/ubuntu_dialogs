2009-02-09T22:38:00.000Z	katie_j		so any thoughts on my sound problem, anyone?
2009-02-09T22:40:00.000Z	herath	katie_j	i'd start by going to the system-->preferences-->sound menu and check if the name of your usb keyboard is shown as the selected playback device... if that's the case or change it to point to your sound card
2009-02-09T22:41:00.000Z	katie_j	herath	it's not set as the selected playback device and I turned all the sounds off
2009-02-09T22:41:00.000Z	katie_j	herath	it doesn't do it through the keyboard when I log in, only when I turn the keyboard on
