2009-06-10T10:56:00.000Z	squiggie		hello all, I'm wondering if there is an application out there that is a uPnP media server and has the ability to connect to Hulu, CBS, netflix etc... for ubuntu? I'm looking for something like PlayOn but open source or GPL.

2009-06-10T10:59:00.000Z	squiggie	hateball	thanks, I'll check into that. I hadn't heard of that one.
2009-06-10T11:02:00.000Z	squiggie	hateball	apparently it doesn't have Hulu or netflix support. Does anyone elseh ave any other suggestions?
