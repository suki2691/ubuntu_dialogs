2011-04-28T09:59:00.000Z	hcook		can anybody point me to some current information about running 32-bit binaries with a wrapper in 64-bit ubuntu? looking to make guitar pro 6 work but it's only available as an i386 .deb
2011-04-28T09:59:00.000Z	ayecee	hcook	I'd like to, but I'm afraid I'd have to google it myself.
2011-04-28T10:02:00.000Z	hcook	ayecee	Herbs: all i could find googling was this really old (2005/hoary) forum howto....is that still about how it works?
2011-04-28T10:04:00.000Z	ayecee	hcook	that should work. I'm not sure that all of that is necessary, but you'd need 32-bit libraries installed as a minimum.
