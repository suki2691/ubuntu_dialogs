2005-04-14T16:49:00.000Z	imran		I'm installing ubuntu and it's suggesting I create a swap partition of 468mb which seems a bit small to me, is that an ok size (for 512mb real mem) ?

2005-04-14T16:52:00.000Z	imran	thoreauputic	does that include if I want to do lots of heavy compiling ?
2005-04-14T16:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	imran	compiling seems to work fine here with that much swap
