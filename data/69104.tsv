2009-01-13T18:30:00.000Z	Deckard_BR26354	melch	The root problem is that capturing audio from an analogue mic seems to be broken.
2009-01-13T18:31:00.000Z	melch	Deckard_BR26354	Does you mic work in any other program?
2009-01-13T18:33:00.000Z	Deckard_BR26354	melch	No - I am using gnome / pulseaudio / ALSA - playback is fine and I can HEAR the mic through my speakers, but sound recorder won't capture it and pulseaudio won't show it on the monitor graph.
