(dont know the tech term) i know there are password crackers, but i mean. say theres was a dual-boot vista/ubuntu laptop. dont know pw's to either of them, but you cdboot to a linux distro, any will do. and copy the vistas sam file to a flash drive. how would you then decrypt/reverse hash or w.e its called, to get the pw you need for the useraccount?
