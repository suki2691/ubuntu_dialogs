2008-06-07T21:04:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	IndyGunFreak	If I don't turn it up and down all the time, then either the loud parts (like explosions) are too loud or the soft parts (like whispering) are too quiet and I can't hear them.
2008-06-07T21:06:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	IndyGunFreak	I'm still happy. I love VLC. just wish it had that one additional feature. then it'd be perfect for my use
