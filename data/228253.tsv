2005-08-11T10:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		:) or are we going in circular logic here. Lol
2005-08-11T10:29:00.000Z	root________	Dr_Willis	lol..  only thing is, sudo makes X apps unusable, and su doesn't.  kdesu doesn't make x apps unusable, so it's su, not sudo..  and I can't make su ask for a user password....
2005-08-11T10:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	root________	 never noticed. :P I tend to use 'sux'   and shells
