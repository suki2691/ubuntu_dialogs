2008-06-17T13:02:00.000Z	Wispring		I just installed an FTP server named proftpd .... how do find out what the URL of it is so it can be accessed? Help Please
2008-06-17T13:02:00.000Z	Gumby	Wispring	generally services like ftp, ssh, telnet etc have conf files located in /etc/
2008-06-17T13:02:00.000Z	Gumby	Wispring	the interface the device listens on will be in /etc (probably /etc/proftpd.conf)
2008-06-17T13:03:00.000Z	Gumby	Wispring	also, netstat -tpan |grep 21 should tell you
