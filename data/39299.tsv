2010-02-01T08:47:00.000Z	Hansard	ouyes	the connection works, I can browse the internet and download, then it stops working after about 5 minutes and occasionally it disconnects completely
2010-02-01T08:47:00.000Z	Hansard	ouyes	reconnecting fixes the problem and it'll work for another 5 minutes or so
2010-02-01T08:53:00.000Z	Hansard	ouyes	no ideas? :(
