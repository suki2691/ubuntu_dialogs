2007-04-09T08:57:00.000Z	jared_		I need some help with an error that I'm getting in the terminal. I'm trying to get my computer working as a webserver for me to test some things out on. When I try to install the needed packages with sudo apt-get I get "E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavail able)
2007-04-09T08:57:00.000Z	jared_		E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?"
2007-04-09T08:57:00.000Z	jared_		what do I do to get rid of that error?
2007-04-09T08:58:00.000Z	clearzen	jared_	There is another package manager running somewhere
