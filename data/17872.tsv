2011-05-04T03:50:00.000Z	Osmodivs		Hello. Ok, so I sudo chmod in a /usr/share/amsn folder so I could drag and drop some files to /amsn/skins folder, but nowm the /usr/share/amsn folder does not have a lock icon, but inside that folder, ALL of the files have a lock icon. Is there a way to undu this?
