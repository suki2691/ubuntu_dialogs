2008-07-28T05:51:00.000Z	Zahnon		So I have a .ko kernel module that I want to load via insmod. Where should I put this file? Do I need to add its name to a configuration file somewhere?
2008-07-28T05:53:00.000Z	Zahnon		Is there a better channel to ask questions in?
2008-07-28T05:55:00.000Z	sybarite1	Zahnon	you could try #linuxhelp or even #linux, the people there are generally terribly helpful  ....  but dont whine if you dont get an instant reply
2008-07-28T05:56:00.000Z	Zahnon	sybarite1	I don't plan on whining. I am in a hurry though and my question seems fairly simple.
