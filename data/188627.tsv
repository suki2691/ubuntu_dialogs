2007-03-28T08:52:00.000Z	shirish		ok guys I have downloaded a bunch of updates which are in /var/cache/apt/archives today, due to some issues I'm on command-line (X is not working) hence can't use Apton to make CD backup, is there any other way to make the backup & use it?
2007-03-28T08:52:00.000Z	shirish		I might be re-installing edgy hence asking
2007-03-28T08:52:00.000Z	shirish		I don't want to download all the updates again
2007-03-28T08:53:00.000Z	shriphani	shirish	i suppose you just run sudo apt-get update again
