2008-07-28T03:19:00.000Z	Chair		I'm interested in learning ubuntu.  I heard I can install it on my computer while I already have windows.. would I have to make a partition for it?  I've got two partitions now, one with xp and some free space, and the other with programs and free space.  Would I be able to install it on my program filled partition with no problems?
