2008-03-10T20:56:00.000Z	Slart		does flash in firefox handle sound in a different way than other apps in ubuntu? it seems asoundconf set-default-card doesn't affect flash audio.. anyone know anything about this?
2008-03-10T20:56:00.000Z	infbliss	Slart	cant find easily given that Flash is proprietary
2008-03-10T20:57:00.000Z	Slart	infbliss	mm.. I know.. but gnash just isn't good enough.. thanks for you input though
2008-03-10T20:58:00.000Z	infbliss	Slart	yeah gnash is not good enough. but have to manage with Adobe Flash till then :(
