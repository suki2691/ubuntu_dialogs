2008-10-16T15:38:00.000Z	Lykkefeen		I just installed LAMP using package manager with no problems... However, apache cannot interpretate .php pages, is there any way to fix it? I've tried sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart with no luck

2008-10-16T15:44:00.000Z	Lykkefeen	ActionParsnip	OK, I installed php5 cli and then restarted the apache2 webserver, but I still can't get my browser to display the php page... :S
