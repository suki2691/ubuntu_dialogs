2008-12-20T21:19:00.000Z	Photoguy		I'm having trouble when I change screen resolutions.. on 1152x864 it's fine:     http://www.turboimagehost.com/p/1100845/Noblur1152x864.png.html    but then on 1280x960 it's slightly blurry, which drives me crazy!        http://www.turboimagehost.com/p/1100846/Blur1280x960.png.html
