2006-06-14T08:32:00.000Z	blaaaat		damn, I b0rked my Ubuntu install (upgrade to Dapper went wrong because I forgot 'dist'). Any tips on how I could start to fix it? (I can still log into my pc using an older kernel)
2006-06-14T08:32:00.000Z	dooglus	blaaaat	do a "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
2006-06-14T08:36:00.000Z	blaaaat	dooglus	yes I did after I did an accidental "apt-get upgrade" after changing my breezy to dapper sources
2006-06-14T08:37:00.000Z	dooglus	blaaaat	install 'ubuntu-desktop'?
