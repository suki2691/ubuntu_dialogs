2004-11-20T09:26:00.000Z	Mojo_Jojo		hey, I was wondering how I can change my desktop to 32bpp(that right?)
2004-11-20T09:27:00.000Z	ryan	Mojo_Jojo	you probably just want to set it to "24"
2004-11-20T09:27:00.000Z	Mojo_Jojo	ryan	yeah but i've been having problems with UT an dit was suggested I try it at 32
2004-11-20T14:58:00.000Z	Mojo_Jojo	ryan	does that work in xorg also or just xfree86?
