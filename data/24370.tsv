2010-10-31T17:43:00.000Z	xananax_	galadude	then you can remap your key: xmodmap -e "keycode [UR_KEYCODE]=[NEW KEY]"
2010-10-31T17:44:00.000Z	xananax_	galadude	but I can't remember how to get a keycode
2010-10-31T17:50:00.000Z	xananax_	galadude	sorry, can't help much more than that, I am new to all this. It just happened that I had to change a key so I looked for that, but I can't tell you more. Maybe google for xmodmap
