2008-08-08T15:08:00.000Z	pulse00		hi all. does anyone knows where ubuntu writes all the apache configuration stuff when installing something like phpmyadmin or websvn ? normally if you do it by hand you would have to add a virtual host to make it accessible through example.com/phpMyAdmin. but i can't find any entries there
2008-08-08T15:08:00.000Z	pulse00		i mean when installinng it through apt-get
2008-08-08T15:09:00.000Z	rambo3	pulse00	look up debian-administration.org
