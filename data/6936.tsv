2011-12-22T06:46:00.000Z	Muggotronica		Hello, I am trying to configure a computer to  have multiple monitors, it is working, but there are a few things I want to change.  First off, on one screen when windows are maximized they go off the screen, and second I want to set each monitor as a seperate desktop.  How can I establish this configuration?
