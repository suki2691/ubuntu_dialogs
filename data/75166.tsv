I have a mother board... totally screwed up...BIOS deleted.... the only code that excecute is the boot-block function on the BIOS chip...and it tries to boot from floppy......I have loaded GRUB on a floppy... can I boot a livecd or a OS in the hdd?
2009-01-03T08:16:00.000Z	wj32	ReXiO	unless GRUB can boot from a CD...
