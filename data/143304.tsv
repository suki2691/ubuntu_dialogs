2007-03-14T16:19:00.000Z	Rooy		anyone has an idea why network-manager isn't in fdsasdf's synaptic list?
2007-03-14T16:19:00.000Z	Rooy		it's in main repo for me (feisty anyway)
2007-03-14T16:19:00.000Z	jussi01	Rooy	maybe sources arent correct?
2007-03-14T16:20:00.000Z	Rooy	jussi01	i doubt that, fdsasdf hasn't open synaptic before
