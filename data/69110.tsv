2009-01-08T22:08:00.000Z	junk_head		Hey ubuntu community, my ubuntu 8.10 is crashing at grub after today's updates, since it was fine yesterday
2009-01-08T22:09:00.000Z	Ali_ix	junk_head	try selecting another kernel in grub menu and see if it works
2009-01-08T22:10:00.000Z	junk_head	Ali_ix	what is the command for the grub menu?
2009-01-08T22:10:00.000Z	Ali_ix	junk_head	no command needed, you can see that during bootupo
