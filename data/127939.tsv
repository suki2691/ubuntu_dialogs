2007-07-30T07:16:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	puppy-user-06som	well, almost everything.. i don't think it loads a GUI.. but i could be wrong, i've never booted it to see
2007-07-30T07:18:00.000Z	puppy-user-06som	IndyGunFreak	 it seams like it loads almost everything except whats causing GNOME to not load
2007-07-30T07:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	puppy-user-06som	that may be the case, i don't know,
