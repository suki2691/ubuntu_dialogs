2006-05-12T07:02:00.000Z	martyn		wat does all this mean? -The file /root/rp8_linux20_libc6_i386_cs2_rpm does not exist, or it is corrupt. You may have downloaded the wrong file, or put it in the wrong location. Please try again.

You can still try to use the installer; just rename the file you downloaded to /root/rp8_linux20_libc6_i386_cs2_rpm . Note that if you do this, there is no guarantee the installer will work.
