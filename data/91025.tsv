2008-06-19T18:44:00.000Z	Mark_		i also have another question, after installing this program...i cannot uninstall it...wine says "file c:\windowsDIIUnin.dat not found"
2008-06-19T18:45:00.000Z	mgolisch	Mark_	that path seems to be wrong
2008-06-19T18:47:00.000Z	Mark_	mgolisch	would you suggest another way to uninstall it?  should i just delete the folder in .wine?
2008-06-19T18:48:00.000Z	Mark_	mgolisch	oh i see, the path should be "C:\windows\DIIUnin.exe"  hmm, maybe i can change this in winecfg?
