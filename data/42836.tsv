2009-11-15T18:26:00.000Z	snowveil	deci_	I was having the same issue and wound up just uninstalling pulseaudio and using alsamixer instead
2009-11-15T18:27:00.000Z	deci_	snowveil	i was thinking about that too, its really getting frustrating. so i guess removing pulse and then freshly installing alsa does the trick, since alsa has the x-fi support now?
2009-11-15T18:28:00.000Z	snowveil	deci_	not sure about the x-fi support.  But my card was having severe cracking and buffering issues and alsa is working 100%
