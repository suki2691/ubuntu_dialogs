2008-11-10T04:35:00.000Z	swegner	zsquareplusc	Yes, that's the screen I'm looking at.  But which key do I add here?  If I go into "Passwords and Encryption Keys", and export the public key to my PGP signature, is that what I use?
2008-11-10T04:35:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	swegner	i think so. if you used this key to sign your packages
2008-11-10T04:36:00.000Z	swegner	zsquareplusc	Yes, I'm fairly sure this is the one I used.  I just tried adding it to the Software Sources, and it appears to have accepted it.  I'll have to upload a new package to actually see if it works.  Thanks for the help.
