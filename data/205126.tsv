2010-11-10T06:00:00.000Z	jrt4		I just did a clean reinstall of Ubuntu (10.04 --> 10.10). Every time I do heavy CPU intensive work, I experience sudden shutdowns (this generally happens with overheating). But everything was working fine in 10.04 for months, so I doubt a hardware problem suddenly occured right after a reinstall. It seems that the default ACPI configuration is screwed up somehow. How should I go about fixing this?

2010-11-10T06:03:00.000Z	jrt4		That bug report seems to be dealing with something else.
2010-11-10T06:04:00.000Z	dli	jrt4	are you sure it's not overheating, if you can monitor cpu/video card temp
