2010-06-17T07:49:00.000Z	Dougdoug4		Hello! I have a question regarding using the Pendrive Linux Universal USB creator thing. When using it with 10.04 i386 i have some issues... The flash drive is a 1GB Kingston drive, and it HAS worked before...
2010-06-17T07:49:00.000Z	Dougdoug4		I select the 'format drive' option and format the filesystem of the USB as fat32 when i create the USB. I also choose 'no persistence'
2010-06-17T07:49:00.000Z	Dougdoug4		are any of these settings incorrect? because when i boot the usb installer i create, it doesn't work
