2008-11-04T04:06:00.000Z	andresj		hey, my window decorations sometimes don't redraw properly. I'm using Intrepid with the proprietary nvidia drivers, and desktop effects enabled. Any help? :-)

2008-11-04T04:08:00.000Z	andresj	rww	i am completely sure that disabling compiz will fix the problem. :)   but im sure there must be SOME workaround... :D
