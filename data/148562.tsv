2011-08-08T05:10:00.000Z	fiber		Hi, I have an acer timelinex with "Intel Corporation 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset HD Audio", and I can't seem to get my mic working!  I can get audio output working fine and the external mic works, just not the internal.  Does anyone have any recommendations?

2011-08-08T05:12:00.000Z	fiber	coz_	norc: All the channels are on (especially the "internal microphone boost")
2011-08-08T05:13:00.000Z	coz_	fiber	 mm ok,, not sure then,, I am not the best person for sound issues,, did you check also in the #pulseaudio and #alsa channels ? ..yes?
