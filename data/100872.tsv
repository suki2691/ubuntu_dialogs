2008-04-02T14:20:00.000Z	abhi_	Survivorman	two reasons 1) it's alpha 2) it's not in the repositories 3) i have no easy way of getting rid of it if i don't like it :)
2008-04-02T14:21:00.000Z	Survivorman	abhi_	I understand. Seems to be rather stable for me though, but it IS an alpha.
2008-04-02T14:34:00.000Z	Survivorman	abhi_	did you get fresh from adobe?
