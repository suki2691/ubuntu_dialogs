2005-07-03T09:29:00.000Z	nalioth	Vinh	sudo only lasts 5 minutes, and if you dont put the 'sudo' in front of command, you are a regular user
2005-07-03T09:30:00.000Z	nalioth	Vinh	don't use 'sudo'
2005-07-03T09:34:00.000Z	nalioth	Vinh	the first time, it asks. you wait 5 or 10 minutes (am not sure of the timeout) and it will ask again
