2006-11-10T14:10:00.000Z	serrand		Hi again.
2006-11-10T14:11:00.000Z	serrand		I kinda gave up on getting ubuntu installed. I have 256 ram on a Celeron 1.50GHz laptop. Any reason it would run so slowly?
2006-11-10T14:12:00.000Z	serrand		Other than the relatively low ram...
2006-11-10T14:12:00.000Z	rogue780	serrand	use xubuntu
