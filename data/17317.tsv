2011-03-18T06:16:00.000Z	fisix	jrmcm	i'm trying to move the icons themselves. like the internet icon right beside the volume icon
2011-03-18T06:17:00.000Z	fisix	jrmcm	unlocking to move only allows switching the notification area and indicator applet back and forth as groups
2011-03-18T06:19:00.000Z	jrmcm	fisix	there are different "themes" that move the indicators around within each group.
