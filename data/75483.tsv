2009-01-28T18:41:00.000Z	Apple44		I have a netbook rubbung with a 10" screen - I want to be able to access the ubuntu desktop on it from my main machine over the network - I have the option of VNC-ing in, however I can't resize the screen from it's original 1024x600 to a more reasonable 1680x1050 on one of my monitors
2009-01-28T18:42:00.000Z	Apple44		is there a way of getting access to the desktop and being able to resize it ?
2009-01-28T18:42:00.000Z	booksbuggy	Apple44	do you have a software called start-up manager installed?
2009-01-28T18:43:00.000Z	Apple44	booksbuggy	- no
