2010-07-23T17:50:00.000Z	ponty		hi. i want to write a script that resolves the ip adresses in sources.list (apt) on multiple dns servers. (mitigate the risk falling for dns poisoning). is there already a solution for that?
2010-07-23T17:50:00.000Z	LjL	ponty	why do you need to protect from dns poisoning, since the APT repositories are signed anyway?
2010-07-23T17:52:00.000Z	ponty	LjL	i think i m not sure what signed means in this context. i ll google for it
2010-07-23T17:55:00.000Z	ponty	LjL	do you mean hashes for packages?
