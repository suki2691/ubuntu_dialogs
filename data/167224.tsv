2006-09-20T08:04:00.000Z	Kewlb		seamless window is nice, but if I am in .NET and try to run my app it doesn't bring the app up (keeps it in the background)
2006-09-20T08:06:00.000Z	Kewlb		will the default evolution mail client eventually learn what is junk and what is not.. or does it require you to manually mark everything as junk all the time?
2006-09-20T08:07:00.000Z	jake1	Kewlb	what does your /etc/X11/xorg.conf look like
2006-09-20T08:07:00.000Z	Kewlb	jake1	what does the xorg.conf file have to do with rdesktop? just wondering.
