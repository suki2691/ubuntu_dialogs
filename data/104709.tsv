2009-09-25T01:32:00.000Z	Fox321123		OK, I just loaded 64 bit 9.04. It keeps freezing randomly on me. Any help would be appreciated
2009-09-25T01:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fox321123	did you md5 check the iso and verify the cd once burned
2009-09-25T01:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fox321123	you are supposed to do it BEFORE
2009-09-25T01:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fox321123	you need to get a stable install first, you didnt test the ISO or disk so you may have installed using a bad disk
