2010-01-18T10:43:00.000Z	snadge		my printer is setup.. and its working, but if i go to print a particular pdf file using "document viewer" .. i can see the job go into the queue, the activity light on the printer starts flashing.. then it just disappears from the queue and nothing is printed out :(
2010-01-18T10:44:00.000Z	snadge		what alternatives apart from document viewer.. can i use to print pdf files reliably?
2010-01-18T10:44:00.000Z	snadge		or should i just do it from windows in a virtual machine
