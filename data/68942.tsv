2009-06-08T15:36:00.000Z	Titan8990	chocobanana	live CD does not include tools needed for compiling
2009-06-08T15:37:00.000Z	chocobanana	Titan8990	blip-: can't you pull the compiling tools using synaptic or apt-get in the live environment?
2009-06-08T15:37:00.000Z	Titan8990	chocobanana	you *can* but it would be installing to RAM, and compilation is typically RAM intensive....
