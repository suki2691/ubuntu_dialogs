2009-04-24T11:31:00.000Z	Crash1hd	liquidmeson	so basically its so that you can keep your /home directory on a reinstall :) thats actually not a bad idea
2009-04-24T11:33:00.000Z	Crash1hd	liquidmeson	I wondered how that worked (I would do something similar in windows ntfs where I have windows on C and all documents on D) that way I could blow away C and keep D intact
