2007-12-04T16:53:00.000Z	Shapeshifter	wols	Ok thanks. I just noticed I'm having these troubles with my cd rom drive anyway... it works when in XP, but I don't want to use that anymore. in ubuntu some cd's don't get recocnized and other then that I can't burn cds because they always lock up in the middle of the burn process. in xp everything is fine
