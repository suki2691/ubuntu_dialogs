2008-11-11T03:35:00.000Z	MattP2		Hey, I am trying to set up a wifi network on a secure network.  TO do this, I want to authenticate with an ubuntu based desktop, then I am using a usb -> ethernet converter to run the internet into the linksys router.  I just got the desktop to log on to the network, but am having no success in getting ubuntu to push the internet through to the router.  Anyone willing to give me a hand?  Thanks a ton!
