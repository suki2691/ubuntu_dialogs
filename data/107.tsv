2005-01-22T07:39:00.000Z	jocco		Hi everyone, I have 2 quick questions... I just installed XFce4 anyone here suggest a nice Minimalistic window manager that is nice? Also I was thinking about installing KDE "Just in case", will installing KDE slow down my system? TIA
2005-01-22T07:40:00.000Z	jdub	jocco	merely installing kde won't slow down anything
2005-01-22T07:40:00.000Z	jdub	jocco	it will just use disk space
2005-01-22T07:40:00.000Z	jdub	jocco	until you run it, of course
