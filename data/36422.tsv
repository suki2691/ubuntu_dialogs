2010-03-01T10:08:00.000Z	Jon-	jrtayloriv	I think they are the same thing.
2010-03-01T10:09:00.000Z	jrtayloriv	Jon-	Why does Ubuntu team maintain these packages then? Surely they wouldn't create a package for no reason ....
2010-03-01T10:10:00.000Z	Jon-	jrtayloriv	I've used Ubuntu for 1 month. Don't ask me. :P
