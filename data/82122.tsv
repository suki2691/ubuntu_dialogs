2008-08-27T01:27:00.000Z	Raspe		hello all.  I'm trying to get my laptops speakers to cooperate with me here with no luck.  When I plug my headphones into my headphone jack in the front of my laptop, my music/videos can still be heard through the regular speakers in my laptop case.  I've tried to play around with the sound setting in the mixer but nothing seems to work.  Any suggestions?
