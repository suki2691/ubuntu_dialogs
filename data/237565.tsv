2009-10-01T23:10:00.000Z	kansan		if i have ubuntu hardy installed such that /root/ is on one partition and /home/ is on another... and i want to move to jaunty... i was thinking of: 1) booting from jaunty live cd; 2) blowing away the /root/ partition, and reformat it.  3) use the existing /home/ partition in the new installation.  does this sound reasonable?
