2011-11-24T06:32:00.000Z	Guest83479		Hi, everyone. My Ubuntu 11.10 gets all the way to the lightdm login screen, but then it won't respond to mouse or keyboard input. It seems like it might be disabling the USB or something. I can use the keyboard to enter the BIOS settings, so I know at least it does work. Can anyone help?

2011-11-24T06:57:00.000Z	Guest83479	pragmaticenigma	No light with the caps lock/num lock key, and yagoo: No such setting in my BIOS (just individual settings for enabling/disabling usb support altogether, and that's enabled). Sorry, I told xchat to identify me using my preferred nick, but it gave me "guest83479" for some reason.
