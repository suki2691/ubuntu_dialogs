2011-04-05T20:25:00.000Z	elarson_	geekliketodd	yeah, right when I got it within the first couple hours it froze :(
2011-04-05T20:26:00.000Z	geekliketodd	elarson_	it may be a hardware issue.
2011-04-05T20:27:00.000Z	elarson_	geekliketodd	they released an update that was hinted at fixing things and since I needed to run linux for work (either via vm or directly on the machine) I figured it was worth it to try installing it on the harddrive
