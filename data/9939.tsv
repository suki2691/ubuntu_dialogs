2011-11-30T14:49:00.000Z	Utopiah		hi #ubuntu
2011-11-30T14:50:00.000Z	Utopiah		so yesterday I asked about a ACPI problem as halt caused Ubuntu to stop but not the computer to actually shutdown, I didn't change anything but instead used shutdown -h now and it actually properly stop now
2011-11-30T14:50:00.000Z	Utopiah		any idea why as it seems halt relies on shutdown anyway?
2011-11-30T14:51:00.000Z	ahhughez	Utopiah	I got next to no idea.... mine is having some issue which might be related to day light savings I think...
