I'm trying to open a pdf file from firefox, however, when I click on the file, instead of it promting me to select whether I would like to save it or open it (I would select open if I could) it just displays a bunch of "code" in the browser. I think this might have to do with the fact that the file ends in a .PDF, where as files that end in a .pdf (note the case difference) behave correctly. Any help?
