2006-08-05T08:47:00.000Z	Drasla		a non-ubuntu question: my cd drive won't open or close.  button does nothing, even before the OS is loaded.  is it possible this is a BIOS problem, or is it necessarily mechanical?
2006-08-05T08:47:00.000Z	gekko`	Drasla	did you check if it's mounted?
2006-08-05T08:48:00.000Z	Drasla	gekko`	when I type 'mount' it's not listed.  is that what you mean?
2006-08-05T08:49:00.000Z	gekko`	Drasla	yes. well, then it's not normal
