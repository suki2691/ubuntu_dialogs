2006-08-13T08:31:00.000Z	dasos		I installed ftpd and sshd, and i have the proper ports forwarded to my computer, but i get connection refused whenever i try to connect to my computer
2006-08-13T08:32:00.000Z	dasos		does ubuntu have a default firewall that i'm not seeing?
2006-08-13T08:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dasos	 linux has firewalling features built in.
2006-08-13T08:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dasos	 but theres no fancy firewall gui installed by default.
