2010-02-14T03:16:00.000Z	Serraphyn		I am just wondering if there is something I've not tried as ubuntu is nice and all but very very little support for games.  The games I play aren't that advanced and they seem to be REALLY slow in ubuntu.  Is ubuntu just not a OS for gamers?

2010-02-14T03:17:00.000Z	Serraphyn	Darael	What games are there for ubuntu that are decent? I don't like shooter games, I'm more an MMO type person.
2010-02-14T03:18:00.000Z	Darael	Serraphyn	I rather enjoyed Regnum (I'll see if I can find you a link) but there aren't any MMOs in the repos AFAIK.
