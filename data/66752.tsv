2009-02-08T02:29:00.000Z	Er2K	soundray	 I would disagree.  I've been down this road.  The windows ext* driver can read files about 95% of the time.....ditto the ntfs driver for linux....both are only about 99% reliable, which is a scarily low number for a filesystem!!!!!
2009-02-08T02:32:00.000Z	soundray	Er2K	okay, tell Frijolie about it... If it was my machine, I wouldn't consider anything other than ext3 or xfs, and only access them with Linux for backup and restore
2009-02-08T02:33:00.000Z	Er2K	soundray	You are preaching to the choir, my friend.  I was consolidating a tb or so of media from around the house onto the XFS partition on the media server.
2009-02-08T02:33:00.000Z	Er2K	soundray	I eventually used the ntfs driver to get everything I could, then transferred the remaining files with the drive on a real windows machine
