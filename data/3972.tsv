2012-05-04T10:31:00.000Z	dr_willis		cant think of much reason to not do it that way - these days
2012-05-04T10:32:00.000Z	zozy	dr_willis	afaik the officially recommende version is 32 bit on desktops
2012-05-04T10:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	zozy	 thats been discussed befor. and was supposed to be changed to 64bit i heard.. its more of a 'idiot proofing' attempt - if someone has NO clue what 32/64bit means.. its saying 'if yoou dont know. go 32bit'
