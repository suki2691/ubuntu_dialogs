2004-11-20T17:14:00.000Z	macTijn		can anyone explain to me why I can't select non-ttf fonts in gnome-terminal ?
2004-11-20T17:14:00.000Z	bob2	macTijn	"can't select" or "doesn't list"?
2004-11-20T17:14:00.000Z	bob2	macTijn	nano /etc/fonts/local.conf
2004-11-20T17:16:00.000Z	macTijn	bob2	I guess I have to restart X for that stuff to work
