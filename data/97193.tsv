2008-04-24T04:33:00.000Z	Pelo	twistage	 if you now what is good for you you leave it   you shouldn'T be rebooting that often anyway,  leave it on it is very usefull
2008-04-24T04:33:00.000Z	twistage	Pelo	How do at least enable output then? Everytime I get to that point it sits at a black screen for the amount of time it takes
2008-04-24T04:35:00.000Z	Pelo	twistage	not sure what you mean,  and I don'T think I would be able to tell you how to fix it anyway,   it's running fsck , it can't do that while it finishes booting
