2007-01-23T14:52:00.000Z	[Hyarion] 	tom47	I shouldn't be, I erased all the partitions when I installed Ubuntu, e.g. no Windows or anything.
2007-01-23T14:53:00.000Z	[Hyarion] 	tom47	ya, I was hoping it might have been that but no luck.
2007-01-23T14:54:00.000Z	[Hyarion] 	tom47	I'll try adding it to my taskbar, thanks.
