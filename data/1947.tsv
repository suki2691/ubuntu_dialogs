2012-07-16T03:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	scietnes	 theres the boot-repair tool you can use from a live cd/gui that can automate it.
2012-07-16T03:15:00.000Z	scietnes	Dr_Willis	will it fix a 64-bit system from a 32-bit cd?
2012-07-16T03:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	scietnes	 no idea. I only use 64bit. I think there is a boot-repair live-cd that does both types.
