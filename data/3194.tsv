2012-06-06T01:33:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	rolandb	thunar's pretty light, but it drags in more packages than pcmanfm does
2012-06-06T01:36:00.000Z	rolandb	aeon-ltd	"drags in more packages"?? i like pcmanfm but its way too buggy
2012-06-06T01:38:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	rolandb	if you're using xubuntu or xfce already i'd just use thunar. though really you could just get used to cp/mv/rm; i feel that gui managers are only beneficial because of drag and drop and opening files easier
