2009-11-21T15:30:00.000Z	khensthoth	skbera	It would help if you specify which version of Exaile and Ubuntu you are using.
2009-11-21T15:42:00.000Z	khensthoth	skbera	It seems that the equalizer is not implemented in the 0.3.0.x branch, but it has been implemented in 0.3.1. If you are adventurous enough you might want to try to install that.
