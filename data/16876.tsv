2012-06-12T23:14:00.000Z	manicnerd	dryicebomb	right...i guess this is me being anal but when you add it as a bookmark like that, it doesn't appear in the grouping...it adds a new grouping called Bookmarks and places it there....I dont have any other bookmarks and it's annoying me to have to have it setup that way when it's a default folder...it should be listed with the others

2012-06-12T23:16:00.000Z	manicnerd	dryicebomb	no worries...thanks for suggesting something :)  I've searched for an answer to this for days and I think I'm just going to have to accept defeat
