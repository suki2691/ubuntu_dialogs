2010-10-05T08:26:00.000Z	KGF2009		Anyone here know how I would get Ubuntu 10.04 to support Japanese input? Somewhat like a romaji-to-japanese conversion?
2010-10-05T08:27:00.000Z	KGF2009		I've heard that, but there's no documentation for 10.04. Do I just use the documentation from the latest release?
2010-10-05T08:27:00.000Z	littlebearz	KGF2009	that I'm not sure
2010-10-05T08:28:00.000Z	KGF2009	littlebearz	this is what I'm looking at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/JapaneseInput
