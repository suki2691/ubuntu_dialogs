2009-10-25T16:08:00.000Z	Psinetic		i have firestarter, but it just doesn't do what i want. i want to be able to do all kinda of things with the ip's ports, everything, straight from the GUI

2009-10-25T16:09:00.000Z	Psinetic	frogzoo	i like GUI's. I dont like command line. i'm trying to get away from that as much as possible. i know i have to use it anyways, but i'd rather use GUI if i can
