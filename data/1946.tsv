2012-07-20T04:53:00.000Z	Moogs		I installed Fedora and during installation it said booter failed.   I clicked okay and it continued... then said installation was finished... then I went to restart the computer and then it went to load Windows, and then Windows crashed showing a blue screen and restarted saying it couldn't be loaded... Any suggestions?? anyone?? :O
