2008-03-18T06:41:00.000Z	ASDFG		the problem is that I tried that, but since I have a laptop screen, and an external screen, the external screen is displaying at a lower resolution that its meant to, plus I cant turn the laptop screen off, my screen and graphics windows closes every time I change something
