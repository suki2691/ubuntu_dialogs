2008-11-19T08:25:00.000Z	jimmy_		hey guys, how can I turn off the "!" statements that announce people have joined the channel. Also I am using irssi.
2008-11-19T08:25:00.000Z	gaelfx	jimmy_	that depends on which chat client you're using
2008-11-19T08:26:00.000Z	gaelfx	jimmy_	sorry, I don't use irssi
2008-11-19T08:27:00.000Z	gaelfx	jimmy_	I know that in pidgin there is an extension that hides extraneous join/part messages
