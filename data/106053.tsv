2008-06-29T15:55:00.000Z	Buyydee		Since I'm already here and you're talking about search engines: I don't completely understand which folders (or even document contents?) are searched when I click 'search' from the main menu or inside a folder - is there a website where I could find some info on that searching tool?
2008-06-29T15:56:00.000Z	Bodsda	Buyydee	i find that search thing to be 'not very good' try a 'locate' command in the terminal   eg    locate firefox
2008-06-29T15:57:00.000Z	Buyydee	Bodsda	Well, that's not the way I liked to put it, but actually... yes. I just thought I was too dumb to use it somehow
2008-06-29T15:57:00.000Z	Bodsda	Buyydee	no, it is in a technical term 'crap'
