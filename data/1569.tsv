2012-08-27T11:29:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex		is there a command line option to convert xlsx (excel) doc to html ?
2012-08-27T11:31:00.000Z	ssta_	brontosaurusrex	maybe something like: libreoffice --convert-to html foo.xlsx
2012-08-27T11:32:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	ssta_	let me try ...
2012-08-27T11:49:00.000Z	ssta_	brontosaurusrex	with a simple test xlsx I made, conversion to html by libreoffice seems to be not working properly.  Conversion to pdf works well though
