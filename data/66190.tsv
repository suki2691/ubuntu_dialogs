2009-11-22T18:27:00.000Z	d4non		I screwed up a ntfs partition in ubuntu installating program, I picked the ntfs partition with most free space on it and I thought it's gonna make a new partition in the free space, but it removed the partition and formatted the amount of free space into ext3 and the rest became regular unalocated space, any hope to recover the data? Did not Write anything in there yet!
