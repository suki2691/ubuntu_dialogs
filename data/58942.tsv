2009-04-28T05:55:00.000Z	HitThemLow		Hi Im having Network Problems on my new laptop, I installed ubuntu and have an internal card, and an external, the internal is broken so Im trying to use the external, but it wont work. I have my netwrok set up and its not my card, how can I trick ubuntu into using the external card only? The internal is an atheros, exteernal is a zydas
