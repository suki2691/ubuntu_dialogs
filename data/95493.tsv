2009-10-05T17:32:00.000Z	NiNes		hello
2009-10-05T17:33:00.000Z	NiNes		all up and running, what irc client do majority use?
2009-10-05T17:34:00.000Z	DJones	NiNes	Probably irssi (terminal base), xchat or pidgin
2009-10-05T17:35:00.000Z	DJones	NiNes	If you a gui, I'd suggest xchat, if not irssi from a terminal
