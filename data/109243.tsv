2008-11-01T12:08:00.000Z	Schmick	ajopaul	.cue files usually come in pairs with .bin files. Those are CD images.
2008-11-01T12:14:00.000Z	ajopaul	Schmick	so only a .cue and .wav files dont make sense ?? nothing can be done to them ?
2008-11-01T12:15:00.000Z	Schmick	ajopaul	.wav is audio.. if you got the codec, it can be played.  .cue files is (usualy) the structure in a .bin file used to burn a CD.
