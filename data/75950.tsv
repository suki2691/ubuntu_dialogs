2008-11-03T11:04:00.000Z	histo	jj_galvez	why not just double click on the executable?
2008-11-03T11:05:00.000Z	histo	jj_galvez	you could even makeit appear like a folder.
2008-11-03T11:06:00.000Z	jj_galvez	histo	thinking more of a simple way to distribute apps, if everything you need is in a single folder with the executable, there's no reason for the user to see all the support files - just thinking outloud really
