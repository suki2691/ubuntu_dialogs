2009-04-16T21:26:00.000Z	exodus_ms		I'm using Ubuntu 8.10. I'm having problems getting my optical drive to work. When I insert a blank or a disc with data (dvd-rw, cd-r, cd-rw, cd+r, etc.) the drive opens after a few seconds. I have tried: sudo mount /dev/cdrw /media/cdrom0 sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom0 and sudo mount /dev/dvd /media/cdrom0 I also added these to /etc/modules: libata ata_piix piix  fstab and other info --> http://paste.ubuntu.com/152189/

2009-04-16T21:42:00.000Z	exodus_ms	Fishscene	I tried inserting a liveCD, the tray closes, then opens and remains open. Rebooted into BIOS with liveCD in the tray, the system shuts down, the tray closes, then opens again when in BIOS. Started normal boot, tray closes then opens again after login.
