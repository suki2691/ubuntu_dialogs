2011-04-28T13:14:00.000Z	vadviktor		I'm a bit impatient too, because tonight I have to install a Ubuntu on a friend's netbook to replace 9.10 and I really hope it will be 11.04 :)
2011-04-28T13:15:00.000Z	DamienCassou	vadviktor	I would install latest daily if I were you
2011-04-28T13:16:00.000Z	DamienCassou	vadviktor	because latest daily is probably very close (or even similar) to the next release
