2011-01-08T00:04:00.000Z	Nesto1000		Hi, can anyone help me? I am trying to encode a video using CLI and ffmpeg and x264. The thing is that I want to trim, deinterlace, and maybe resize the video... any help would be appreciated...
2011-01-08T00:05:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Nesto1000	are you trying to create an MP4?
2011-01-08T00:06:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Nesto1000	FYI the default ffmpeg in ubuntu repo does NOT support AAC audio (important for MP4, not so much for MKV)
2011-01-08T00:08:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Nesto1000	i was just pointing it out - but you obviously already knew.
