2009-01-05T08:04:00.000Z	usr13		The freeze or lockup, can you tell what's causing it?
2009-01-05T08:06:00.000Z	DClayBuck	usr13	I have a Radeon HD 4550, two GeForce 8600 GT's, and a shrinking RMA window. :)
2009-01-05T08:07:00.000Z	DClayBuck	usr13	Not sure. The video freezes, and I can't do anything besides a hard reset, but the audio keeps going like nothing's wrong.  It also locked up during the screensaver once or twice, but that was with the old drivers.
