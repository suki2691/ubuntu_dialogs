2009-06-22T22:53:00.000Z	pumpkinseed		i just downloaded ubuntu netbook remix from the ubuntu website and am about to burn it on a cd to install it on my new EEE pc. Problem is the file is a .img and my nero linux doesn't know how to handle it. How do i burn a .img file? And why is this file even a .img rather than an ISO file??
