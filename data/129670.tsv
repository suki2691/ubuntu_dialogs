2007-06-26T09:00:00.000Z	igoR		Hello, when I'm trying to install Fifa Manager 07 with WINE, I can't continue after that a window popup which is full white with the title "Electronic Arts. Inc", what do I need to see what this Electronic Arts Inc. windows says?
2007-06-26T09:02:00.000Z	mik3	igoR	i'm guessing it uses directx which AFAIK wine doesn't support  that spiffy graphic rendering stuff from MS
2007-06-26T09:04:00.000Z	igoR	mik3	you know if Cedega support directx?
2007-06-26T09:04:00.000Z	mik3	igoR	based on what i'm reading I would assume so
