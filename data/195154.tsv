I try in a command line and resolv.conf is read-only (as root) I rebooted to single user mode and it said it was read-only I tried :w! and chmod 777. What should I try?

2007-08-22T07:26:00.000Z	dancingmonkey	Scunizi	I sudo su | (root) vi /etc/resolv.conf | warning you are accessing read-only file
2007-08-22T07:26:00.000Z	dancingmonkey	Scunizi	I also tried chmod 777, and rm -f
