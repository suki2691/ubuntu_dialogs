2008-12-25T16:14:00.000Z	sfer2		just a general question: a 3gb swap is really too much, isn't it? shouldn't a few hundred megabytes be reasonable enough?
2008-12-25T16:15:00.000Z	sfer2		aah, i have no idea why this system ever had 3gb of swap. don't ask me, i didn't install it on this particular machine i've been looking after
2008-12-25T16:16:00.000Z	sfer2		it's possible to resize swap after installation with something as simple as gparted, isn't it?
2008-12-25T16:18:00.000Z	sfer2	sfer2	how much swap would you suggest?
