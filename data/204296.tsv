2005-12-15T09:11:00.000Z	pluffsy		is it possible to install firefox 1.5 via apt-get? should I in that case add a new repository. I've heard of something called backports, that is what I want, right?

2005-12-15T09:12:00.000Z	pluffsy	Subhuman	I see. When it is avalible will I need to add those backports repositories?
