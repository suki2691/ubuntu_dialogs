2008-08-26T23:29:00.000Z	draeath		Are there any debian-installer gurus available? I've got a damaged CDROM that won't read the base system from the ISO, but works with the netboot. Is there any way to get the ubuntu-server install disc to function like the netboot image? (ie, download everything, don't get any packages from the disc)
