2011-04-06T03:54:00.000Z	kidko	mickster04	I've had this external harddrive for a few years. It just started giving me trouble this afternoon... trying to open a file on it froze Thunar, and I couldn't unmount the drive (despite there being nothing using it, according to lsof). I tried restarting, and now I can't re-mount it. http://pastebin.com/dk78srTu
