2009-07-01T21:38:00.000Z	s1gmab3ta		hey fellas - is there any program i can use to figure out what all the buttons on my shiny new logitech VX revolution mouse are called?
2009-07-01T21:39:00.000Z	Titan8990_	s1gmab3ta	typically mouse button 1-7
2009-07-01T21:39:00.000Z	s1gmab3ta		because i'm trying to set these two buttons on it labeled "zoom" to control the compiz enhanced zoom plugin
2009-07-01T21:39:00.000Z	s1gmab3ta	Titan8990_	compiz lists 9 buttons
