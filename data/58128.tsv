2010-01-05T18:47:00.000Z	Scunizi	diverse_izzue	you can't share a /home directory with 2 different releases.. you can however share a common /home with kde and gnome of the same release
2010-01-05T18:48:00.000Z	diverse_izzue	Scunizi	I'm sure i *can*. the question is whether it's a good idea or not :-)
2010-01-05T18:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	diverse_izzue	no it's not.. because each release has different package versions and /home holds the conf files for lots of what you use.. there will be conflicts
