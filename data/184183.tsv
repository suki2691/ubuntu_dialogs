2007-01-15T16:16:00.000Z	jorvis_		help please.  I'm trying to follow the wiki and install XGL/beryl, but when I try to apt-get xserver-xgl it says "xserver-xgl: Depends: libc6 (>=2.4-1) but 2.3.6-0ubuntu20 is to be installed"
2007-01-15T16:16:00.000Z	Jowi	jorvis_	#ubuntu-xgl is for you :)
2007-01-15T16:17:00.000Z	jorvis_	Jowi	thanks.  do you know of a better guide?
