2012-05-19T16:35:00.000Z	tailf		so i am about to back up some files using rsync. does anyone recommend any arguments besides -r (recursive, to include everything in a directory)?
2012-05-19T16:37:00.000Z	compdoc	tailf	Ive never had to use -r
2012-05-19T16:38:00.000Z	tailf	compdoc	so you only ever rsync single files?
2012-05-19T16:39:00.000Z	compdoc	tailf	not at all - it just copies all files and folders in the path
