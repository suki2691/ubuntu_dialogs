2009-02-14T19:58:00.000Z	Pilot_51		Is there any way to do cd or equivalent in a launcher command?
2009-02-14T19:59:00.000Z	Pilot_51		I'm using wine and the only way I can launch this exe is if I'm already in the directory where it resides
2009-02-14T20:00:00.000Z	Pilot_51		This command works in terminal but not the launcher: cd "/media/stuff/Program Files/EA GAMES/Battlefield 1942" && padsp wine bf1942.exe +restart 1
