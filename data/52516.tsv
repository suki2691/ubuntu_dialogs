2009-11-12T01:46:00.000Z	Gametime		I am going to install ubuntu for the first time ever. How much space should i partition from my Windows 7 Computer?
2009-11-12T01:47:00.000Z	streblo	Gametime	how big is your hard drive
2009-11-12T01:49:00.000Z	streblo	Gametime	I usually set up ubuntu in a VM, and i give it 8GB. it depends on what you want to do with it, but if you're just screwing around, 8 is fine
2009-11-12T01:51:00.000Z	streblo	Gametime	if you've never used linux before, you'll probably have some moments of frustration. dont give up.
