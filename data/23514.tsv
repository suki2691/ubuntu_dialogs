2010-10-26T01:00:00.000Z	AHemlocksLie	HACKER1993	I just tried that, I don't think anything happened, and there wasn't any output
2010-10-26T01:01:00.000Z	HACKER1993	AHemlocksLie	i think you may have to look up fstab if im right it should be on the ubuntu comunity docs page
2010-10-26T01:03:00.000Z	AHemlocksLie	HACKER1993	docs say that's more for internal stuff like extra hard drives/partitions, not usb devices. Should I dig through it for something to try anyway?
