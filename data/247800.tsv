2008-05-20T11:31:00.000Z	Lain_of_the_Wire		I'm getting very upset at IRC very quickly
2008-05-20T11:31:00.000Z	Lain_of_the_Wire		I've been trying to follow the intstructions for registering to the letter, but the intructions keep using the terms nickname and password interchangably
2008-05-20T11:32:00.000Z	Lain_of_the_Wire		And despite sending a message to nickserv with the register command (and it won't let me register again with a different password) I cannot message people
2008-05-20T11:32:00.000Z	ompaul	Lain_of_the_Wire	this is not a problem for #ubuntu you do this /msg nickserv register (your password here)   <<<<< further issues you should take to #freenode ;-)
