2010-08-20T14:52:00.000Z	stetho		I've got a cheap USB to 9-pin serial converter from Maplin for my Ubuntu laptop. When I plug it in, dmesg reports it's "now available as /dev/ttyUSB0" but I can't talk to any devices I connect to it. Anyone have any experience with this - should I try a different terminal app (I've tried a few I've found with apt-cache search terminal/tty/serial etc)?
