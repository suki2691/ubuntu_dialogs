2007-12-07T01:24:00.000Z	Iggz		trying to get a grasp of linux's file management system. Does it have a "programs: folder or is its structure different?
2007-12-07T01:25:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Iggz	a bit different
2007-12-07T01:25:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Iggz	most programs are in /usr/bin, /bin, /sbin, and /usr/sbin  (you can do 'echo $PATH' for more)
2007-12-07T01:33:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Iggz	plugins for what specifically?
