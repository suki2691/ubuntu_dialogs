2008-02-06T06:45:00.000Z	Lxzn		Can someone possibly help me get my Broadcom wireless adapter (BCM4315) working? I've run through several guides, including the one in Ubuntu docs and on the forums, but to no avail. I can retrace my steps if that helps as well...

2008-02-06T06:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Lxzn	fwcutter did all the work...  ndiswrapper will work... according to some users, but personally. I have used fwcutter on the bcm43xx
