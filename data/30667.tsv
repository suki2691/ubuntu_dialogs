2010-11-11T00:26:00.000Z	MagicJ		when I do an apt-get upgrade on ONE of my lucid machines I get the message that some packages have been help back,  output is at: http://paste.ubuntu.com/529534/
2010-11-11T00:27:00.000Z	Pici	MagicJ	Use apt-get dist-upgrade
2010-11-11T00:30:00.000Z	MagicJ	Pici	- that did seem to do it - ty - I still don't understand how that ONE machine got out of step
2010-11-11T00:30:00.000Z	Pici	MagicJ	That is a bit weird.
