2010-01-13T01:26:00.000Z	prem__		Hi all
2010-01-13T01:26:00.000Z	prem__		does anyone know how to start dictd with 'upstart'
2010-01-13T01:27:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	prem__	sudo service dictd start, maybe?
2010-01-13T01:27:00.000Z	prem__	kinja-sheep	that will start dictd as standalone server I was more interested in starting it on the fly, like xinetd, may be I am confused between two
