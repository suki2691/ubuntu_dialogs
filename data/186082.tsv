2006-11-21T13:58:00.000Z	graft		why would you switch from KDE to Gnome?
2006-11-21T13:59:00.000Z	stoft	graft	sorry, I don't have an answer for your question.
2006-11-21T14:00:00.000Z	graft	cafe_	i mean, how does it fail to work? do modules not load, etc.? or what?
2006-11-21T14:01:00.000Z	stoft	graft	I switched with 6.10, because I thought KDE was buggy (it turned out to be something else) and now I've kind of stayed in Gnome. Gonna give it a try. Maybe I'll go back to KDE, maybe not.
