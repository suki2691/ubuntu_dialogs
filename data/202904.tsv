2008-07-27T00:20:00.000Z	faltoo		hi guys. sorry, if this is stupid question, but I'm trying to get the ethernet card on my dell vostra 1510 to work. I read here (http://www.stupent.at/2008/06/22/ubuntu-linux-on-a-dell-vostro-1510-a-review/) that I might have to pass pci=nomsi as a parameter to the kernel.
2008-07-27T00:20:00.000Z	faltoo		how do I do that?
2008-07-27T00:21:00.000Z	faltoo		ok, thanks let me try that
