2009-02-24T03:23:00.000Z	diesel		I installed adobe reader from the adobe site and I can see that it is installed using 'dpkg -l | grep adobe' which returns adobereader-enu.  I thought that I could then do dpkg -e adobereader-enu OR apt-get remove adobereader-enu, but I get 'failed to read archive 'adobereader-enu': no such file or directory'.  What am I missing?
