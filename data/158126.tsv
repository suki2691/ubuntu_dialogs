2012-02-02T21:35:00.000Z	ebone		My system doesn't seem to be updating the display manager properly.
2012-02-02T21:36:00.000Z	ebone		Can anyone tell me where/how this is done?
2012-02-02T21:37:00.000Z	Slart	ebone	you'll have to explain that a bit more. Why do you think it's not updating the display manager? are there error messages? what version of ubuntu are you running?
