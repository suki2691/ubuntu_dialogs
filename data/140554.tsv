2008-05-09T12:49:00.000Z	Ayabara		I've managed to mess up my firefox, so that I have to type "firefox.ubuntu" to make it start. Is there a way I can do a total reinstall of FF with all Ubuntu integration?

2008-05-09T12:57:00.000Z	Ayabara	Ali_ix	didn't do it. After completely removing everything and then reinstalling, I still don't have the "firefox" command. All I have is firefox-3.0 and firefox.ubuntu (which I know is the same app). The problem is that stuff like choosing an app to open a downloaded file with doesn't work anymore, so something fundamental must have been broken...
