2007-09-04T05:00:00.000Z	Morrowyn		does the 64bit ubuntu version support as many software packages as the 32bit version?
2007-09-04T05:00:00.000Z	Pelo	Morrowyn	 we recommend using the x86 version unless you have actual need of a 64 bit system,  64 misses many drivers and doesn't have flash
2007-09-04T05:01:00.000Z	Pelo	Morrowyn	 if you don'T need flash, and don'T have anything nvidia or ati , you should be fine
