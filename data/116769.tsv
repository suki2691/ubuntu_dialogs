2007-10-14T09:21:00.000Z	underwatercow		Why is it that when my computer is starting and it lists the services and such it is starting, firestarter says "FAILED"?
2007-10-14T09:23:00.000Z	underwatercow		How do I know if firestarter is running when I close the interface?

2007-10-14T09:25:00.000Z	underwatercow	jotil	that's what I thought... any idea why the service isn't auto-starting?
