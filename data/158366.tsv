2008-01-17T03:11:00.000Z	Gekkomon_Shogun		When it says WARNING: This will destroy all data on any partitions you have removed does that mean my ENTIRE Harddrive will be wiped
2008-01-17T03:12:00.000Z	Slart	Gekkomon_Shogun	no.. it just means that the data on the partitions you selected to remove will be destroyed.. not the entire hard drive.. unless you selected *all* the partitions
2008-01-17T03:12:00.000Z	Slart	Gekkomon_Shogun	the above statement comes with no guarantees what so ever... read the man page for the tool you're using.. don't trust the weirdos in this channel =)
