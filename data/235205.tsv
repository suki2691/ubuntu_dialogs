2005-10-21T06:51:00.000Z	linukso		Hi! Does anyone else here have a problem with usb-mass storage devices (i.ex Creative muvo)? I can mount it and copy files to it, but I cant unmount it, and when I remove it the files aren't there. I have tried this on two different computers, but both run ubuntu breezy.
