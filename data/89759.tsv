2008-10-17T15:32:00.000Z	Buttercup		Did anyone read my question? I have no idea how to ask my questions here, without appearing rude..
2008-10-17T15:34:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	Buttercup	have you got terminal access?
2008-10-17T15:37:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	Buttercup	don't know if this will  work before Intrepid is formally released but if you "apt-get install update-manager-core" and then run "do-release-upgrade"
2008-10-17T15:37:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	Buttercup	but I really can't recommend a beta as a solution to GDM issues - it's not stable
