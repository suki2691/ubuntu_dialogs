2011-10-16T07:25:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		I'm trying to print out some web pages, and it looks like there may be one font that just won't work....instead of the letters being properly spaced, they spread out across the page....the page displays fine in the browser, but either printing or saving to file causes the same result...I installed the latest hplip, with no change
2011-10-16T07:26:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		how do I do that in firefox?

2011-10-16T07:27:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	Stupendoussteve	yep, I tried the Print To File option in CUPS, created a PDF, same result
