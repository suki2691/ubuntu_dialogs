2007-10-22T06:18:00.000Z	charlie		Which packages should I download for development with C?
2007-10-22T06:19:00.000Z	vocx	charlie	"build-essential" also take a look at the programming forum in ubuntuforums.org
2007-10-22T06:20:00.000Z	charlie	vocx	build-essential installs g++ which I don't need, where can I get standard ANSI gcc headers and libs?
2007-10-22T06:21:00.000Z	vocx	charlie	install "build-essential" and that's it... libc6-dev and other libc I presume.
