2010-10-29T16:12:00.000Z	Onyx47	DGM	I used it just yesterday, worked properly for me
2010-10-29T16:12:00.000Z	DGM	Onyx47	it didnt for me last week.. i found a bug submission about it. But i think it had something to do with using an older usb creator on the new image if i recall
2010-10-29T16:13:00.000Z	Onyx47	DGM	well, it either got patched or I didn't have the latest ISO and it worked with that one
2010-10-29T16:15:00.000Z	DGM	Onyx47	yea i was using an older usb creator when i was trying to get rid of the hellhole "jolicloud" from my netbook..
