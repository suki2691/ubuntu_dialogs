2009-07-01T21:11:00.000Z	Imperfect		Hey, so if I have the b4 version of firefox 3.5 do I just have to wait for the package maintainers to package up the final and get it in the repositories, or is it worth my time to go add other sources and get it from there?

2009-07-01T21:12:00.000Z	Imperfect	synta10	I can afford to wait, so long as eventually it'll happen eventually.
2009-07-01T21:13:00.000Z	synta10	Imperfect	there is this repo: https://edge.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mozilla-security/+archive/ppa
