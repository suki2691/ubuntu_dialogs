2011-04-07T17:47:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	dusf	is the cpu maxing out?
2011-04-07T17:47:00.000Z	dusf	aeon-ltd	i have a monitor on my top panel, checking now but i don't think so...
2011-04-07T17:48:00.000Z	dusf	aeon-ltd	no it is not, and no sound at all in vlc at the moment, before now would work on first opening but stop halfway through, or if i skipped through a video
