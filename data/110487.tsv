2008-01-01T04:45:00.000Z	aleka		I am trying to get Samba to work so I can see a windows PC I have connected on the same router. A previous link given to me (https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/configuring-samba.html) was not really helpful, or I didn't understand it... can anyone give me the basics or point me to a good howto? I am not trying to achieve anything complicated.. just want to copy some pictures and music have on my Ubuntu machine onto the windows one.

2008-01-01T04:46:00.000Z	aleka	oakxx	I wanted to see if there were any basic direction of setting a typical smb network
