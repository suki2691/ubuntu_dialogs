2008-11-29T06:19:00.000Z	cutterjohn	JBrown	you do NOT want OSS drivers for ATI or nVidia, the OSS one both SUCK ALOT... to put it mildly
2008-11-29T06:20:00.000Z	cutterjohn	JBrown	well they're ok for 2d
2008-11-29T06:25:00.000Z	JBrown	cutterjohn	 I'm using the ATI version and I'm surprised they'd release suck a crappy driver..  ?!?!
