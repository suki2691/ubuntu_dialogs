2009-02-27T05:59:00.000Z	TheGambler		Hi, everyone. I just got my first Linux server (Ubuntu Hardy) set up and running and on IRC!
2009-02-27T06:01:00.000Z	TheGambler		Basically, I want to learn Linux and I don't have spare hardware. This achieves it
2009-02-27T06:02:00.000Z	TheGambler		Can anyone point me to a resource that would help a noob understand how to get to a graphical desktop on Ubuntu over ssh? I would prefer not to use vnc if possible
