2008-03-30T21:21:00.000Z	unop	Matic`Makovec	xmms has a plugin that does 'something' like that, it does not completely remove vocals, but it does a good job
2008-03-30T21:22:00.000Z	Matic`Makovec	unop	and what is this plugin called if you'd maybe know?
2008-03-30T21:23:00.000Z	unop	Matic`Makovec	it's called the "voice removal plugin" and it should be included with the xmms package
