2007-01-01T15:55:00.000Z	AidanL		How do I get to root in terminal as I need to get to root in order to "make install" for ndiswrapper.
2007-01-01T15:57:00.000Z	AidanL		ok thanks.
2007-01-01T15:57:00.000Z	AidanL		it tells me no rule to make target 'install'
2007-01-01T15:58:00.000Z	mnoir	AidanL	then you are not in the right place or not following directions or using a package that is not conventionally made
