2008-08-12T21:17:00.000Z	adakos		ahoy, im back - i was talking to someone earlier about installing mencoder on a text-only 8.04 ubuntu server ... although i cant remember how they said to do it, anyone know the proper procedure? (sudo apt-get install doesnt work)
2008-08-12T21:18:00.000Z	adakos		@sargun: try looking in your /etc/apt/sources.list file and see if anything is broken
2008-08-12T21:20:00.000Z	adakos		Can anyone tell me how ot install mencoder or a similar transcoder for linux server (text mode) when apt-get fails?
