2007-06-07T15:05:00.000Z	piratenin		firefox says no plugin is avalible
2007-06-07T15:06:00.000Z	craigbass1976	piratenin	go to www.candocomputerservices.com and get the appendix off the tinapos page.  I have java install instructions there
2007-06-07T15:07:00.000Z	craigbass1976	piratenin	then you have to make a link in a firefox folder somewhere, but I can't remember where.
