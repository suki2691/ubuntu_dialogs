2008-03-04T11:38:00.000Z	mavi-	aseanocho	google. there are lists over those resolutions
2008-03-04T11:39:00.000Z	aseanocho	mavi-	 I've googled it, and tried mult settings.  Nothing has worked except for vga=ask, and I don't like any of its options.
2008-03-04T11:41:00.000Z	aseanocho	mavi-	 Any other suggestions?
