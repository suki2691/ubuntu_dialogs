2012-05-11T19:39:00.000Z	shomon		I've upgraded linux to 12.04. How do I copy in my old profile settings or homedir config?
2012-05-11T19:39:00.000Z	shomon		do I just copy over the default stuff?
2012-05-11T19:40:00.000Z	shomon		or is there an "importer"?
2012-05-11T19:40:00.000Z	awwf23	shomon	did you have a username or something?
