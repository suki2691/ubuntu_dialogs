2011-06-09T03:49:00.000Z	quaestio		hello, I have a question: I want to install ubuntu 11.04 on my new FreeDOS laptop. Since it doesn't have a disk drive I will use a usb stick. I found and understood the instructions on how to do this with 'startup disk creator' in the download section (I'm on a friend's ubuntu laptop). My problem is that the only usb stick I have available is just 1GB (in the instructions it says it must be at least 2 GB). Will it work anyway?

2011-06-09T03:56:00.000Z	Polah	quaestio	No, if it's just to be used to install Ubuntu on an actual system then you won't need the space. That space is if you want a persistent installation on the USB drive
2011-06-09T04:00:00.000Z	Polah	quaestio	correct.
