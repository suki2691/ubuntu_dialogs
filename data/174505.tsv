2006-07-29T07:39:00.000Z	Eagle3		what kind of problems would cause ubuntu/linux to freeze on a laptop with no error messages?
2006-07-29T07:39:00.000Z	Warbo	Eagle3	Probably a graphics driver problem
2006-07-29T07:41:00.000Z	Eagle3	Warbo	it's a radeon, so I'm using the radeon driver provided...never had problems until about 2 weeks ago
2006-07-29T07:41:00.000Z	Warbo	Eagle3	Hmm, the free driver usually doesn't crash as much as the non-free one.
