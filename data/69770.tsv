2009-01-16T15:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WyHiWyL	rename the file do you mean?
2009-01-16T15:54:00.000Z	WyHiWyL	ActionParsnip	no, the title on the title bar when i open it. i received a pdf with a title like "blahblah.doc" which was very annoying!
2009-01-16T15:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WyHiWyL	i guess pdfedit is the solution, didnt know it did that, i tend to just read the body
