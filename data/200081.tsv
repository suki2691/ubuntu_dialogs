2006-01-25T13:44:00.000Z	nanotube	marcster	openoffice calc
2006-01-25T13:44:00.000Z	nanotube	marcster	or gnumeric, like nevyn says
2006-01-25T13:45:00.000Z	nanotube	marcster	but the thing is, openoffice calc comes with default ubuntu install, while you have to get the gnumeric package separately...
