2008-03-31T17:25:00.000Z	xstatic	Dr_willis	is it worth me grabbing my old audigy 2 value and using that? I would have preferred my nice 24bit onboard, though...
2008-03-31T17:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	xstatic	 audigy2 i have - has lasted me the last 4 machines.. It may sound much better then any onboard cards you have.
2008-03-31T17:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	xstatic	 lets just say ive never had any hassles with my audigy cards under linux. :)
