2010-10-10T04:39:00.000Z	Maka		Greetings, I am having a problem after upgrading from 10.04 to 10.10rc. Everything seemed to go fine, rebooted after update, boots fine.. comes to login, i log in just fine, then i hear ubuntu sound, see purple background, but no gnome menu's show up. i can see and move the mouse cursor. I can ctl-alt-f1 to a command prompt and navigate via command prompt just fine.. just no gnome2 gui.
