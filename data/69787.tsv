I  can ping each computer from the other, ssh in and connect but that's it. If I try to connect using samba my laptop says no appication is installed to handle this type of file. I have samba, samba-common and smb-client installed. On my desktop I do have samba-server installed. I've also tried sftp but I keep getting the message conn
