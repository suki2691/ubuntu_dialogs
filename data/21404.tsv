2012-04-28T16:18:00.000Z	HP_Administrator		The system clock in this Compaq (aka HP) "nettop" that came with Windows XP Home preinstalled with an Atom processor, running Ubuntu 11.10 Windows install, jumps forward 45 minutes when I quit Windows and start Ubuntu.  Shutting down Ubuntu (and/or powering down the computer) doesn't fix it, so it's attacking the hardware/CMOS clock.  Any clues would be appreciated.
