2006-08-06T14:32:00.000Z	stanwebber		dapper-backports is the backport repository
2006-08-06T14:34:00.000Z	thundr	stanwebber	so what is dapper-updates for?  The other releases just froze for 6 months w/o backports
2006-08-06T14:36:00.000Z	stanwebber	thundr	well for one i think not having dapper-updates universe in my sources is the cause of the recent totem-xine issue
