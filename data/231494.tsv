2008-03-21T12:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Yowshi	 vlc can do that, and mplayer, i think
2008-03-21T12:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Yowshi	 or if all else fails. you can mount the iso image and play the files off of the image
2008-03-21T12:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Yowshi	 actually by mounting the image. anything could play them
