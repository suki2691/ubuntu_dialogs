2007-10-18T22:31:00.000Z	Terrasque	ePax	ideally, no. Practically, yes :p one big difference is that you will still have the old config files for your user
2007-10-18T22:33:00.000Z	Terrasque	ePax	yes. Again, ideally. If you have 3rd party packages or in some cases special config of the system, things can go plink
2007-10-18T22:33:00.000Z	ePax	Terrasque	Oki.
