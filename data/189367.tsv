2009-10-14T04:57:00.000Z	jonathank89		I've been testing karmic for a while now and it's been working great! but after a batch updates i've been getting this really annoying system beep. eg. if i'm in gedit and there's nothing in the document and press backspace it beeps
2009-10-14T04:57:00.000Z	jonathank89		any ideas how to fix this?
