2009-09-06T19:47:00.000Z	Tobbe	LjL	I already checked the backports, it isn't there
2009-09-06T19:47:00.000Z	LjL	Tobbe	somewhere on the backports page there should be links about creating your own backports
2009-09-06T19:53:00.000Z	Tobbe	LjL	Going the official backports path will take about a week according to the docs. What is the second best way to install the package?
