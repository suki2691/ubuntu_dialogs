2010-02-28T03:16:00.000Z	lucas_		hello, where can i find xserver-xorg-video-intel-2.7? it used to be on my repos but cant find it after a reinstallation
2010-02-28T03:17:00.000Z	brjann	lucas_	it looks like it's just xserver-xorg-video-intel now, with no version number
2010-02-28T03:18:00.000Z	lucas_	brjann	i know but -intel-2.7 works so much better than 2.9...
2010-02-28T03:18:00.000Z	brjann	lucas_	ah, okay. sorry, I don't know any more than that :)
