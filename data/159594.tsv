2006-11-10T14:37:00.000Z	caffiend		Can anyone tell me how well MSI MOBO's work with Linux?  I have a 865PE Neo2 Plat with a p4 2.6 an 1G ram..

2006-11-10T14:40:00.000Z	caffiend	erUSUL	how do I determine the chipset? I think it is a Northwood if that makes sense
2006-11-10T14:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	caffiend	well it seems a intel 865 doesn't it? you should not have any mayor problems. Also you can run 'lspci' and see all chips you have
