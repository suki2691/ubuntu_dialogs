2009-06-04T07:05:00.000Z	dga		hi. when i try to mount a device in truecrypt, after entering the password i get this error: device-mapper: reload ioctl failed: Invalid argument
2009-06-04T07:05:00.000Z	dga		Command failed   ... it was working the other day.. perhaps i did something differently this time?
2009-06-04T07:05:00.000Z	r0tu	dga	perhaps you are mounting the wrong dev
2009-06-04T07:06:00.000Z	dga	r0tu	 nope i'm sure it's the correct device
