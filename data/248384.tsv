2005-02-24T16:58:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	NuuB	one of the reasons why this meta-package is useful is that it will make an upgrade to Hoary do things like automatically pull in xorg.
2005-02-24T17:00:00.000Z	NuuB	MobyTurbo	xorg is one more thing with no meaning (not asking you to explain, just setting the bar lower so it is closer to my present level of knowledge)
2005-02-24T17:02:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	NuuB	no, reinstalling the desktop meta package will automatically pull in Samba
