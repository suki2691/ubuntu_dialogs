I got the black screen of death after I booted from my usb stick, but I didn't give up and tried with nomodeset as kernel parameter getting a initramfs prompt telling me /init:line 7: can't open udevadm sttle-timeout of 180 seconds reached. Help could be really really great.

2011-06-16T23:40:00.000Z	dazkae	tucemiux	I have a gateway t-1616
2011-06-16T23:44:00.000Z	dazkae	tucemiux	I'll try with the alternate installer.
