2008-11-30T23:24:00.000Z	Nith	mannytu	in general no. Programs that the script uses may or may not be available
2008-11-30T23:24:00.000Z	Nith	mannytu	as long as you have the shell it runs on (#!<shell>)
2008-11-30T23:26:00.000Z	Nith	mannytu	that means that programs used by the script may not be available
