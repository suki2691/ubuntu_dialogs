2007-06-07T08:43:00.000Z	darkrift_		anyone here able to help me get a broadcom wifi working on kubuntu (i know there is a kubuntu chan, but i figure this isnt specific to kde)
2007-06-07T08:43:00.000Z	darkrift_		i tried fwcutter, and that gives me a 10k connection
2007-06-07T08:44:00.000Z	darkrift_		and ndiswrapper leaves me with nothing (it wont load on reboot)
2007-06-07T08:44:00.000Z	mneptok	darkrift_	fwcutter is the best solution
