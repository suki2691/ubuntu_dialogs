2009-12-25T21:04:00.000Z	r3d2_	Supersaiyan_IV	are you unhappy with compiz in 9.10?
2009-12-25T21:04:00.000Z	Supersaiyan_IV	r3d2_	no I am asking a question
2009-12-25T21:05:00.000Z	r3d2_		As was I - no worries :)
2009-12-25T21:06:00.000Z	Supersaiyan_IV	r3d2_	i know the "compiz-fusion-plugins-unsupported" is in the ppa, but there is no reason stated as to why it isn't in the repositories
