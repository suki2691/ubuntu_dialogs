2008-06-01T20:20:00.000Z	cognatus		just to see what would happen, i guess
2008-06-01T20:20:00.000Z	alexbobp	cognatus	when would "sudo exit" ever be more useful than "exit"?
2008-06-01T20:20:00.000Z	alexbobp	cognatus	btw, the reason it doesn't work is because "sudo" creates it's own shell to execute the command in.  But exit always works!
