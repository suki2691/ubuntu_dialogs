2008-01-12T18:41:00.000Z	Noodels		Hi, I'm trying to set up a dual boot, anyone can help me?
2008-01-12T18:42:00.000Z	Noodels		I'm already trying to follow this guide http://www.matthewjmiller.net/howtos/dual-boot-linux-and-windows/ but I'm stuck on the partitioning bit. The computer came with windows on and I want to avoid a tedious windows install, do those guides have the guide for a computer with windows already installed?
2008-01-12T18:43:00.000Z	Ziroda1	Noodels	would you like a video on how to install ubuntu?
2008-01-12T18:45:00.000Z	Ziroda1	Noodels	here a video describing it http://screencasts.ubuntu.com/Installing_Ubuntu_with_Windows_Dual-Boot
