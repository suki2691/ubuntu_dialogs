2010-02-28T23:04:00.000Z	Slart	bsmith093	yes.. I think you can.. you might have to use the command line tools though
2010-02-28T23:04:00.000Z	Slart	bsmith093	or.. use a partition in a vm
2010-02-28T23:05:00.000Z	Slart	bsmith093	I don't know.. you'll have to check the documentation for the exact syntax.. there are command line tools that are installed together with the vm
