2010-08-04T12:00:00.000Z	littlepenguin	endusr	have you checked cron jobs?
2010-08-04T12:01:00.000Z	endusr	littlepenguin	yeah, saw anacron, munin and munin-node, a few stuff nothing that spawned svn
2010-08-04T12:03:00.000Z	littlepenguin	endusr	have you started it manually maybe and it runs along..nmaybe you try stopping svn and then reboot
