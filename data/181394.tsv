2009-02-20T07:24:00.000Z	merther		I'm trying to add My Documents from a windows computer as an automount in fstab but I don't think it's recognizes the syntax I'm using for My Documents.  What do I use for the space?  in the network browser it uses my%20documents.

2009-02-20T07:27:00.000Z	bruenig	merther	well I would guess you want to put my\ documents, or perhaps quote the entire thing "my documents"
2009-02-20T07:29:00.000Z	bruenig	merther	ask in #samba
