2006-12-31T06:26:00.000Z	tim167	CoolCubix	is that "mplayer <filename>" to try that ?
2006-12-31T06:27:00.000Z	tim167	CoolCubix	it says: Requested audio codec family [mp3]  (afm=mp3lib) not available.
2006-12-31T06:33:00.000Z	tim167	CoolCubix	do I have to do something else do make it work? now I still have "Requested audio codec family [mp3]  (afm=mp3lib) not available." ....
