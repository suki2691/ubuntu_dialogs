2005-03-14T07:39:00.000Z	Slaven		is there some easy way to play a dvd image (.iso) just by somehow selecting the file? it's a mess having to symlink /dev/dvd to /dev/loop/0 and mount the disc everytime I want to watch a dvd
2005-03-14T07:40:00.000Z	Slaven		and what media players are out there? I'd like something with real playlist management, xine's just weird.

2005-03-14T07:41:00.000Z	Slaven	SiRrUs	Yeah, but backed up dvd copies.
