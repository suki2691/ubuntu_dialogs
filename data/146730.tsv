2007-12-08T01:06:00.000Z	beni_	chronic1	what do you mean by "media center" ? LAN File sharing?
2007-12-08T01:06:00.000Z	chronic1	beni_	i was considering building a system to hold all of my media and output it to my hifi system
2007-12-08T01:07:00.000Z	beni_	chronic1	ok, I built it on my own with nfs and stuff... My USB HDD gets decrypted with Truecrypt and All files are accessible via lan so other parts of the network may use the data
