2012-01-31T20:15:00.000Z	Tostada		I'm running 11.10 x64.. I installed a theme called "Elementary Dark" using Synaptic package manager, now the package manager will open but immediately  closes. Would anybody have time to look at my log file.? Thanks.. : )

2012-01-31T20:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tostada	sudo apt-get install elementary-dark    maybe, its not an official package so you will need to find that if you get an error
2012-01-31T20:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Tostada	seems the package name is elementary-dark-theme
