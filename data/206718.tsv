2005-12-10T15:01:00.000Z	sethk	mbruemmer	it depends very much on how much you need to install.
2005-12-10T15:01:00.000Z	sethk	mbruemmer	you can fit it into 1.2 gig but you'll have to be very very careful about what you install
2005-12-10T15:01:00.000Z	sethk	mbruemmer	that's really too small for the full GUI desktop, IMHO
