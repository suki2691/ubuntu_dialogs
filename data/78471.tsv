2009-08-24T06:32:00.000Z	xim_	rblst	i figured the answer was no, but not for that reason, i was more wondering if the sudo sh shellscript.sh, passes the authority into everything in the script....because my script could take 8 hours to run

2009-08-24T06:34:00.000Z	xim_	rblst	lol thanks for trying it out for me, i guess i could have just done that myself
