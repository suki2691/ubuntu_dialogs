2008-01-10T23:23:00.000Z	iclebyte	DrHalan	can you expand on that?
2008-01-10T23:25:00.000Z	DrHalan	iclebyte	i added a second drive (actually a burner but dont htink it matters) to my system now ubuntu took a long time to boot and shows one drive called "CD-ROM1" which i can mount. both drives can be opened by hand though
2008-01-10T23:26:00.000Z	iclebyte	DrHalan	you can open both drives because they can do that with just the power connected. what kind of cd drive was it? IDE or SATA?
