2006-08-28T06:16:00.000Z	Justin_		I believe synaptic caches data right?, since when I re-install programs I had earlier, even after reboot - it does not need to refetch them from the servers
2006-08-28T06:18:00.000Z	Justin_		Wow I have a lot of stuff in there - "cleaning" it will not affect my installed programs I hope?
