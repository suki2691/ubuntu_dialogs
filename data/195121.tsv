2008-07-08T02:13:00.000Z	Mrevox11		Hey everyone. I was able to get my wifi working after a few hours of doing research and I was able to finally install the mp3 codec by adding some multiverses and etc. Now I have another problem. I have compiz fuzion installed and I am able to select options and effects but none of them work. Any help on getting them to work. Im wanting effects like fire and water. Some one please help.

2008-07-08T02:14:00.000Z	Mrevox11		it says direct rendering : Yes
2008-07-08T02:14:00.000Z	Scunizi	Mrevox11	you have to enable fire and water for the "tasks" that you want it to apply to .. I suggest asking the folks in #ubuntu-effects
