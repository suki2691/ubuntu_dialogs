2008-02-10T20:15:00.000Z	dan_l		Hey,  got a quick command line question:  I'm trying to do cp [directory] "/usr/apps/whatever/"
2008-02-10T20:15:00.000Z	dan_l		and it seems to spit out the destination
2008-02-10T20:15:00.000Z	dan_l		how is that line supposed to be formed?
2008-02-10T20:16:00.000Z	Wibble-	dan_l	cp -r /usr/apps/sourcedirectory /usr/apps/whatever/ ?
