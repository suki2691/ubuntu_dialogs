2007-09-17T10:20:00.000Z	KurtKraut	fatcatmatt	I'm not an expert, but could you tell me your problem ?
2007-09-17T10:26:00.000Z	KurtKraut	fatcatmatt	I think you can't blame Ubuntu for not being able to run an MS software. I think you should argue with MS why they did an program that does not support any other platform than Windows.
2007-09-17T10:29:00.000Z	KurtKraut	fatcatmatt	this is an issue to be addressed to MS. In the 'linux world' we work hard to be compatible with everything that's possible. Wine is a great example.
