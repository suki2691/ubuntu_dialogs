2009-11-10T23:10:00.000Z	GJLenon		When I use WINE to access World of Warcraft, something is locking the WoW sub-directory and removing my permissions.  I can easily go in and re-apply premissions, but every time I load the game I am locked out again.  Any idea what is happening?
2009-11-10T23:11:00.000Z	GJLenon		I'm not too bad at fiddling with things, but I have no idea what would be removing permissions from the sub-directory.  If you could point me in the right direction, I'll fiddle. :P
