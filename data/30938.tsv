2010-05-31T22:02:00.000Z	wifinotworking		my wireless card (compaq w200) worked fine in windows xp, and now won't even be recognized in lshw, how do i let it see the wireless card (i even tried installing the windows driver for it in linux and it says its not there). i tried fn+f2 to on and off it and there were no bios options to turn it on? any ideas?
