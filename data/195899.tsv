2008-04-25T05:56:00.000Z	ahave		hello, i am tring to run 'apt-get install build-essential' and the build hangs at '99% [Connecting to archive.ubuntu.com (91.189.92.2)]' and just sits there.. what is going on?
2008-04-25T05:56:00.000Z	sammy	ahave	have you tried running synaptic package manager and having it look for the closest mirror to you? that helped for me.
2008-04-25T05:57:00.000Z	ahave	sammy	no i have not.
2008-04-25T05:57:00.000Z	sammy	ahave	give it a whril. as long as it doesn't pick something on the otherside of the world (and even then), you'll probably see an improvement. it picked a mirror in canada for me (not far from seattle) and I got max download speeds through the entire upgrade.
