2009-04-07T02:23:00.000Z	Slart	Gunslinger2	never seen anything like that.. not saying it's impossible.. I just haven't seen it
2009-04-07T02:24:00.000Z	Slart	Gunslinger2	any special reason you want it to go "backwards"? or it's just a matter of preference?
2009-04-07T02:32:00.000Z	Slart	Gunslinger2	have you seen/used any kind of terminal that worked the way you described?
