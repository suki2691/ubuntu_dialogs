2008-11-05T18:04:00.000Z	limecat	lianimator	as i understand it ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage that contains all the stuff that makes ubuntu, ubuuntu
2008-11-05T18:04:00.000Z	lianimator		seriously though, how can you remove those that come with ubuntu? without removing the whole set?
2008-11-05T18:04:00.000Z	limecat	lianimator	so losing the metapackage just means its no longer technically ubuntu-desktop edition'
2008-11-05T18:04:00.000Z	lianimator	limecat	so it's okay to remove it?
