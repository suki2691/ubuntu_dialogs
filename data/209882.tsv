2008-10-04T05:46:00.000Z	LjL	AllNewToMe	maybe, and yes (unless you enable the PAE extension in the kernel, but it's not enabled in Ubuntu)
2008-10-04T05:46:00.000Z	LjL	AllNewToMe	you either install the server kernel, or roll your own
2008-10-04T05:49:00.000Z	LjL	AllNewToMe	currently, not much. maybe with intrepid, not sure.
