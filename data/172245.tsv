2006-08-04T08:47:00.000Z	incandenza	killaman	you can use either...  but you can only have a max of 4 primary partitions
2006-08-04T08:47:00.000Z	incandenza	killaman	yes
2006-08-04T08:48:00.000Z	incandenza	killaman	so if all you have is windows, swap, and linux root, you can just use 3 primary partitions, if you want
