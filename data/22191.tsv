2010-12-14T08:46:00.000Z	leocade		hey guys. im having trouble using gnome-display-properties with xfce. since xfce doesnt detect my other monitor in its desplay proprties, i downloaded gnome control center and tried changing it from there (because when i use gnome by itself my dual monitor works) howver when i try to configure the monitors and i uncheck "same image on all monitors" and adjust the resolution, it does not "apply" and save changes
