2007-12-20T07:27:00.000Z	Geekomancer1		Hello everyone, I'm having desktop troubles. Literal desktop :) My icons are gone and right-click is disabled, and my wallpaper doesn't show up until after I open up the Appearances panel
2007-12-20T07:29:00.000Z	Juhaz	Geekomancer1	sounds like nautilus isn't running, start it from terminal and save session.
2007-12-20T07:30:00.000Z	Geekomancer1	Juhaz	"start nautilus"?
2007-12-20T07:30:00.000Z	Juhaz	Geekomancer1	just "nautilus" ought to do.
