2009-04-21T08:19:00.000Z	Empathy		question: a friend of mine is running ubuntu intrepid x64, we're trying to get sun-java6-plugin installed but it seems to no longer be in the repos
2009-04-21T08:20:00.000Z	Empathy		i have no idea how to get it working from source and we can only access the ubuntu repos from behind our network security
2009-04-21T08:20:00.000Z	Gnea	Empathy	did you try searching for a similar package?  apt-cache search java plugin
2009-04-21T08:20:00.000Z	Empathy	Gnea	will try, brb.
