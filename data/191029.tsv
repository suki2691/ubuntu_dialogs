2006-04-24T16:40:00.000Z	beniamino	asdf25	how? it says 'this installer doesn't allow you to install over an existing GNU-Linux system overwring system files'
2006-04-24T16:41:00.000Z	asdf25	beniamino	ah. well that's different, i installed it over files that didn't conflict with anything that would be installed, i just a single directory in the root directory
2006-04-24T16:42:00.000Z	asdf25	beniamino	i don't know how you'd even get a usable system like that, if you already have files in the places it's dealing with
