2010-01-10T10:24:00.000Z	Serraphyn		Hello guys, I been really considering finally taking the linux plung, I've worked with PCs for 15ish years but mostly in the windows sector with a  few dabbles in linux as a server.  What I would like to do is have a linux version that is geared more towards the beginning programmer in things like java(I know things like PERL and php already) Is Ubuntu such a distro?
