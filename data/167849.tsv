2007-03-12T12:13:00.000Z	chinny		Hi. Am a bit of a newbie and having trouble trying to mount an ntfs drive from using edgy live. Have created /media/hda folder - and added "/dev/hda  /media/hda  ntfs@ to fstab but get the following error when i try "sudo mount /media/hda" - mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hda, missing codepage or other error" Can anyone help please.
