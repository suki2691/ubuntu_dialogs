2008-02-04T14:52:00.000Z	white_eagle		how to make xfwm to be my default compositing manager? I terminated compiz.real but xfce doesn't let me run window manager settings or window manager tweaks saying that I have another compositing manager running!? no one helps me on xfce or xubuntu

2008-02-04T14:53:00.000Z	stf_	white_eagle	also, remove compiz-manager from your autostart scripts
2008-02-04T14:53:00.000Z	white_eagle	stf_	yes
