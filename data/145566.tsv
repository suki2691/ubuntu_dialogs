2007-12-16T00:52:00.000Z	SaveFerris		Hey all, how can I check to see if I have the xsupplicant already installed? I've been having trouble connecting my campus network all semester (on winvista laptop right now)
2007-12-16T00:53:00.000Z	wols	SaveFerris	dpkg -l
2007-12-16T00:54:00.000Z	SaveFerris	wols	If I don't have xsupplicant, whats the best way of getting it to my ubuntu machine without being able to connect to the internet?
2007-12-16T00:55:00.000Z	wols	SaveFerris	get the .deb and install it with dpkg -i
