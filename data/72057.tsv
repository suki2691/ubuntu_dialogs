2009-06-18T13:44:00.000Z	Omar871		I have this small issue regarding sound. A couple of days ago I tried to switch from ALSA to OSS4, but then I switched back. For some reason, after I switched back both built-in and external speakers started to work together at the same time. How do I disable that?

2009-06-18T13:46:00.000Z	ectospasm		You may be able to mute that in the mixer
