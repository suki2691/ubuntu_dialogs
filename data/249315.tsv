2005-06-10T15:13:00.000Z	Th4tBa5t4rd		not that i am going to do it right now. but is it possible to run either blackbox or bluebox on ubuntu?
2005-06-10T15:14:00.000Z	Th4tBa5t4rd		i <3 blackbox for windows. so i figure it'll be better for *nix once i get the hang of things
2005-06-10T15:14:00.000Z	goldfish	Th4tBa5t4rd	you do? it crashed all the time for me....
2005-06-10T15:15:00.000Z	goldfish	Th4tBa5t4rd	Fluxbox is fab!
