2005-08-10T14:21:00.000Z	AndieB		Hi all... the Ubuntu Linux version 5.04 I've installed is shipped with OpenOffice 1.1.3, english version, I removed it and tried to install the swedish version, 1.1.4, but I didn't work, it asked for the CD and then installed the original version again, what to do?

2005-08-10T14:22:00.000Z	Stormx	AndieB	Should do
