2007-09-06T09:43:00.000Z	Meyvn		hey all, I'm having some trouble installing ubuntu on my laptop, when I try to install it it halts and drops me into a terminal Busy Box 1.3 (initramfs)
2007-09-06T09:43:00.000Z	Meyvn		I think it can't find a filesystem, I previously installed OpenSuse, then deleted the partition, I think my .mbr is gone.
2007-09-06T09:43:00.000Z	Meyvn		can I restore that with my Vista CD?
2007-09-06T09:44:00.000Z	Morrowyn	Meyvn	try ask that question in the windows channel; fdisk /mbr  might do the trick?
