2007-08-06T08:38:00.000Z	Neural_Overload		Is there a way by chance that I could download a package using windows and install it?
2007-08-06T08:38:00.000Z	Neural_Overload		Because as I said earlier I can't connect VIA Ubuntu

2007-08-06T08:40:00.000Z	WX9J	Neural_Overload	then you should be fine, I download on an xp box and save it to a vfat flash drive to use later on this one.
