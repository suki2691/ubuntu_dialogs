2007-05-10T07:34:00.000Z	Don		OK.  Here is a strange on.  Everything is working on 7.04 except Firefox.  Some websites it works fine.  But most sites only load part of the page or none of it at all.  It will just sit and spin without completing the page load.  This started happening after upgrading from 6.10 to 7.04.  It also happens when running from the Live CD.  To make it more interesting, it does the same thing on the Fedora 7 RC 3 LiveCD.  It runs Firefox 2.0.0.3.
