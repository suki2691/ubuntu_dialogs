2012-04-17T01:27:00.000Z	jvargas		what screencast application works? I've tried recordmydesktop but it has problems when converting to other formats and uploading to youtube.
2012-04-17T01:27:00.000Z	jvargas		any recommendation?
2012-04-17T01:27:00.000Z	beandog	jvargas	don't encode for youtube and let them do it
