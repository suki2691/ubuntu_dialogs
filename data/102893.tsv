2010-05-17T19:39:00.000Z	richthegeek		hey, anyone got experience with breaking/testing passworded RAR files - I have a bunch (200) of possible passwords, but can't think of an easy/fast way to test them against the file...
2010-05-17T19:40:00.000Z	histo	richthegeek	there are apps for doing that
2010-05-17T19:40:00.000Z	richthegeek	theadmin	that is, it's not a commercial file or anything, just a friend wanted to see if I could and gave me a few clues for what hte password might be (names of classmates etc)
2010-05-17T19:40:00.000Z	histo	richthegeek	I'd look to backtrack distro for some clues as to what apps they have present
