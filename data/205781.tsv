2005-11-29T15:30:00.000Z	ricky_ds	lemics_	note that I just changed the colors within the svg, nothing else, so I don't think there would be any issue. The feedback I'd like is more about the colors, if I caught the correct colors or if they can be improved?
2005-11-29T15:36:00.000Z	ricky_ds	lemics_	you can have a look at it here: http://pastebin.com/437487 just save the code as background.svg and copy it to/usr/share/gdm/themes/happygnome(-list)
