2008-05-09T12:52:00.000Z	zcat[1]	student	how are you failing to get access to your files.. just can't log in, or did you encrypt a file somehow?
2008-05-09T12:54:00.000Z	zcat[1]	student	in that case, yes.. you probably need john.. just open a terminal and type "sudo aptitude  install john" and you'll have it... in ubuntu it is very rare that you ever need to download, let alone compile, any software...
2008-05-09T12:58:00.000Z	zcat[1]	student	well, you have the answer you asked for. Up to you to decide if you're taking the right approach to the problem
