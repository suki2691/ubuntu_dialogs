2009-02-14T19:00:00.000Z	d_		hello, I'm trying to install ubuntu 8.04 x64 on a dell studio desktop 540, but the installer will not recognize the cd-rom drive (SATA) so the install doesn't proceed (it asks me to load drivers from a floppy, which is kinda hard as 1) I don't have a floppy drive, and 2) I don't know where to get the drivers). Any help?

2009-02-14T19:01:00.000Z	Myrtti		!usb | d_
