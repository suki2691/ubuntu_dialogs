2006-07-07T12:53:00.000Z	dli	beikangyao	I know working ones: rt2x00 , zd1211, intel ipw , madwifi, anything else?
2006-07-07T12:54:00.000Z	beikangyao	dli	trying to use a DWL-G520 (madwifi) and it's hard locking the system
2006-07-07T12:55:00.000Z	dli	beikangyao	madwifi is harder than rt2x00 or zd1211 :( I suggest you to pick up a cheap rt2x00 card, or an intel ipw
