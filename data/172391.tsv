2006-08-13T09:07:00.000Z	PORDO		i'm trying to fix two login problems right now.
2006-08-13T09:08:00.000Z	PORDO		1) how can i make it so that when i log into my account, and i already have a logon going, it just goes to it, instead of asking me whether i want to create a new logon?
2006-08-13T09:09:00.000Z	PORDO		 2) how can i make it so that when i log on from the greeter, i'm not asked for my password again at the xscreensaver prompt?
