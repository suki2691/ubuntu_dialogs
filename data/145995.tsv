2007-03-06T16:30:00.000Z	romrom		please, does somebody knows how to install a x86 ubuntu with a amd64 livecd ?
2007-03-06T16:30:00.000Z	slippyr4	romrom	why would you want to be doing that?
2007-03-06T16:31:00.000Z	romrom	slippyr4	i have only an amd64 live cd
2007-03-06T16:31:00.000Z	slippyr4	romrom	then you probably ought to download an x86 one. that livecd won't even boot on c86
