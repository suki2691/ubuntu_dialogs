2008-09-08T21:47:00.000Z	v6F3hY-Ufml		I'm having a problem where apache (httpd) won't start, and also doesn't produce any errors in the log =( any ideas?
2008-09-08T21:47:00.000Z	lore20	v6F3hY-Ufml	sudo dpkg-reconfigure apache(2)
2008-09-08T21:48:00.000Z	v6F3hY-Ufml		yes, it reports as if it has started in the terminal, but nothing appears in either the 'task manager' nor the netstat listening commands
