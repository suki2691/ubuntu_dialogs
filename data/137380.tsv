2007-04-21T10:45:00.000Z	RobbieCrash		After a fresh install of Feisty, I get the following message every five or so minutes: [37894,012000]  bcm43xx: Error: Miccrocode "bcm43xx_microcode5.fw" not available or load failed.
2007-04-21T10:45:00.000Z	joshjosh	RobbieCrash	add blacklist bcm43xx to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2007-04-21T10:47:00.000Z	joshjosh	RobbieCrash	did that do the trick?
2007-04-21T10:49:00.000Z	RobbieCrash	joshjosh	I'll let you know if it worked in about two minutes :P
