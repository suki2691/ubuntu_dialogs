2007-04-02T07:43:00.000Z	dooglus		Ind[y] : control-alt-F1 is a virtual console.  alt-f7 takes you back to your desktop
2007-04-02T07:44:00.000Z	dooglus		Ind[y] : a console is a physical terminal connected to your computer.  alt-f1 through alt-f6 are virtual consoles, since they're not physically real
