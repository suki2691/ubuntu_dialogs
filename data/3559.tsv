2012-07-17T04:09:00.000Z	Costeelation		with what command show all commands of the terminal? :p
2012-07-17T04:10:00.000Z	jagginess	Costeelation	you mean builtin? there's "help<enter>" .. those are bash built-ins
2012-07-17T04:10:00.000Z	jagginess	Costeelation	stuff like "cd" , note: ls, mv, and cp are external commands and not part of bash
2012-07-17T04:12:00.000Z	jagginess	Costeelation	if i'm searching for a command i know exists, i prefer to use "apropos substring<enter>"
