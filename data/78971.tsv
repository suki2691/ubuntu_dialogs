2008-09-18T21:34:00.000Z	Bingo600		I have a Hardy setup (Installed via the Server CD) , with LUKS+Crypto volumes enabled , i would like to extend my 500GB disk with another 1TB disk. But i cant find any how2's
2008-09-18T21:35:00.000Z	ejer	Bingo600	from what i know you will need to make a new partitiona nd copy files over... don't think you can resize luks containers
2008-09-18T21:36:00.000Z	Bingo600	ejer	but wont the LVM support volume extends ?? , even if LUKS is applied after ??
2008-09-18T21:37:00.000Z	ejer	Bingo600	sorry, even though I use luks and lvm, I am not up on resizing..
