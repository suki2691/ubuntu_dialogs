2008-06-04T11:53:00.000Z	bring3	gordonjcp	it could corrupt the data without actually damaging the drive. still probably not a good idea :D
2008-06-04T11:53:00.000Z	gordonjcp	bring3	it's more likely to just damage the drive irreparable
2008-06-04T11:54:00.000Z	bring3	gordonjcp	well maybe he can get the drive replaced under warranty, at least there would be no signs of tampering :D
