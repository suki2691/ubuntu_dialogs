2005-06-11T15:36:00.000Z	MonkeyMagic		Can someone help a newbie...  Installed Ubuntu, the AMD64 varaint, but my wireless NIC is not supported, so I need to use ndiswrapper.  I downloaded their .DEB distribution, but who on earth do I use a .deb?  I spent 30 minutes trying to figure out, before rebooting into windows, to ask here :-(
