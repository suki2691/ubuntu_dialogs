2012-03-30T14:00:00.000Z	u4ia		Hello all.  I'm looking for a bare bones linux distro to compile VMWare.  Anybody have any recommendations?
2012-03-30T14:02:00.000Z	u4ia		Just has a host os for VmWare Workstation
2012-03-30T14:04:00.000Z	Lantizia	u4ia	why bare bones?  if it's just for virtualization only - use esxi 5
