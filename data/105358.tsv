2010-11-19T16:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	woodmaven	hold C at boot, isn't that the mac way?
2010-11-19T16:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	woodmaven	did you MD5 test the ISO? Did you burn it slowly?
2010-11-19T17:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	woodmaven	you should check the ISO before burning so you know its a good image. Please do this in future as it speeds up support and you don't waste CDs
