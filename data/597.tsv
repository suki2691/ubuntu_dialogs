2012-10-27T14:31:00.000Z	jzelez		Can anyone help me with apg-get/dpkg related problem (hardy)? Output of apt-get: http://pastebin.com/eaZ403Fy
2012-10-27T14:32:00.000Z	fego	jzelez	hardy is not supported anymore
2012-10-27T14:33:00.000Z	jzelez	fego	i know, but it's a production system, and I'm trying to do an upgrade, but can't because of this errors :(
2012-10-27T14:37:00.000Z	fego	jzelez	you cannot upgrade the release by installing latest packages offline
