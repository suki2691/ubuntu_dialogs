2006-05-02T06:20:00.000Z	lx45803		Hi. I need to partition my hard drive to install a copy of windows, but Disks won't let me. Do I need to run it as root?
2006-05-02T06:21:00.000Z	polpak	lx45803	I'd suggest booting with a LiveCD and using gparted
2006-05-02T06:21:00.000Z	polpak	lx45803	cause you can't change the partition of a drive that's mounted
2006-05-02T06:22:00.000Z	lx45803	polpak	can I somehow unmount it and do it without my live cd? my brother lost it.
