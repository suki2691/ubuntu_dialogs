2008-10-03T04:48:00.000Z	AboSamoor		I used bootchart to calculate the long boot time, and it was 37 second, is this normal ? what can I do to make shorter ?
2008-10-03T04:48:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	AboSamoor	sounds about average to me.
2008-10-03T04:50:00.000Z	AboSamoor	tonyyarusso	I have longer time to login using gdm, how can I measure it  ?
2008-10-03T04:51:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	AboSamoor	stopwatch?  Not sure when bootchart stops.
