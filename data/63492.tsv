2010-01-06T20:29:00.000Z	arthur__		i have opensuse and hate it, but also have a partition for backup, now if i use gparted to delete all part. except backup one, can i install without losing that data?
2010-01-06T20:30:00.000Z	acicula	arthur__	well changing partition tables is always a bit risky, backing up is always a good idea
2010-01-06T20:31:00.000Z	acicula	arthur__	but yeah in principle you can modify other partitions and leave one partition untouched
2010-01-06T20:32:00.000Z	acicula	arthur__	well you may have to sort out partitioning manually but yeah it should leave it alone
