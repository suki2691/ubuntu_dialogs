2004-11-08T15:25:00.000Z	barry_za		That made me think of the PLF (Penguin Liberation Front), but they're Mandrake based.
2004-11-08T15:26:00.000Z	barry_za		So I was wondering if it would be easy to get the .rpm's from them and convert them
2004-11-08T15:28:00.000Z	lhb	barry_za	there a program called alien that can convert packages, AFAIK
