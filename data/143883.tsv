2012-05-09T01:59:00.000Z	excelsior		I need to script downloading of a delimited file, editing it, and uploading it to another site, suggestions?
2012-05-09T01:59:00.000Z	BlueEagle	excelsior	wget, awk and ftp?
2012-05-09T02:01:00.000Z	excelsior		I was thinking bash script, with wget, but what are awk for? and ftp won't work for me. Python might, but I'm kind stuck on how to push the upload.
2012-05-09T02:05:00.000Z	excelsior	BlueEagle	why did you suggest awk?
