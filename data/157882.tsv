2010-02-23T04:29:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad		Gparted is starting to tick me off, i dont know whether it is freezing or taking forever, but i am trying to partition my 150 gig hard drive so that 55 is reserved for windows, and when it gets to the e2fsck -v -y thing, it basically stops there for hours
2010-02-23T04:29:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad		is it just going to take forever for that?
2010-02-23T04:29:00.000Z	Slart	CkhiKuzad	not forever.. but a while, yes
2010-02-23T04:31:00.000Z	Slart	CkhiKuzad	it depends on the hardware, size of the partition and probably cpu speed and such.. hard to tell how long it will take.. several hours seem a bit long but I remember from formatting my 1TB drives that it does indeed take a bit longer than expected
