2007-12-19T19:40:00.000Z	webboss		hi all... just come to compile new ver of clamAV and it complains that the GCC ver on 6.06 has an unresolved bug...  GCC Bugzilla Bug 28045 which shows as fixed back in 2006.... anyone got any ideas with this ??
2007-12-19T19:42:00.000Z	webboss		jack_sparrow: its a samba server... with lots of windoze users hanging off it... hence need for AV
2007-12-19T19:44:00.000Z	linky33	webboss	does the samba drive have execute permissions?
2007-12-19T19:45:00.000Z	webboss	linky33	no... but AV is not to protect box... is to prevent users re-infecting from home dirs
