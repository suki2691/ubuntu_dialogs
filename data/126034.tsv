2007-08-07T07:48:00.000Z	zerboxx		Hello all, quick question.  I've recently done a fresh ubuntu install and did a bit too much tinkering and would like to revert back to the original install.  Is there a simple way to do this? (I don't have any important files on my ubuntu partition so that's not a worry)
