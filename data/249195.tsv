2005-02-14T12:51:00.000Z	Tux-Rox		My next big challenge with Ubuntu is disabling certain sound events. It seems impossible to disable individual sound evens. Anyone know how?

2005-02-14T12:53:00.000Z	Tux-Rox	ewhitten	Ya, but how would I disable just a couple of sound events? You can't do it from there.
