2008-01-16T21:32:00.000Z	zubuntu		a friend of mine has a laptop with 2 HDD and he attempted to install ubuntu 7.04 onto the secondary drive, but it looks like it clumped both drives together, is this the default behavior?

2008-01-16T21:33:00.000Z	Slart	zubuntu	to be honest.. I don't think I could do that even if I wanted to... unless I did it after the install
2008-01-16T21:34:00.000Z	Slart	zubuntu	how do look at it when it looks like it's clumped both drives together?
