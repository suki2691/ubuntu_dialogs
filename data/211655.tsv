2006-11-24T11:16:00.000Z	Rossdokta		Hello you all...
2006-11-24T11:18:00.000Z	Rossdokta		I am quite new to Linux, so I wanted to ask you, wich version of Ubuntu I could install on my "good old" PII with 333 Mhz and 64 Ram...
2006-11-24T11:18:00.000Z	sn9	Rossdokta	64 ram is the problem
2006-11-24T11:20:00.000Z	sn9	Rossdokta	if i couldn't get a machine above 64 ram, i likely wouldn't bother with any version of ubuntu and just install damnsmalllinux
