2007-03-14T16:14:00.000Z	bruenig	Evil_`	you don't want anyone writing to it or just "others"
2007-03-14T16:14:00.000Z	Evil_`	bruenig	when I try to run phpmyadmin with lampp, it says "Wrong permissions on configuration file, should not be world writable!"
2007-03-14T16:15:00.000Z	bruenig	Evil_`	hmmm, I would sudo chmod go-w it
