2006-02-24T08:13:00.000Z	ibu		im trying to boot up 5.10 liveCD for my PPC. whenever i boot it up on my iMac G5, it loads a black screen saying boot: so i leave it blank and press enter then when the openfirmware screen comes up, it stays there and won't go away. whatever i type won't show, and the iMac fan just goes loud
