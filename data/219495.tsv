2008-08-06T00:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Dwerg	What error do you get and when?
2008-08-06T00:51:00.000Z	Flannel	Dwerg	Have you checked the integrity of the CD (from the CD menu, there's an option)
2008-08-06T01:01:00.000Z	Flannel	Dwerg	You can verify the MD5 of the iso you downloaded (see !md5), once that's done, try burning the CD at 4x
