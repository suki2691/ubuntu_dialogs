2010-11-07T02:43:00.000Z	zaxonspox	switch10_	cant i compile it for MANY platforms under my amd64? or do i need other machines/arch/platforms and recompile it under them everytime?
2010-11-07T03:10:00.000Z	zaxonspox	switch10_	mngrif, got another question about compiling, now i have compiled under VirtualBox with Ubuntu 32 bits, it is working, but should it also work on Ubuntu 64bit (amd64) ?
