2011-10-20T13:45:00.000Z	devians		hey, i have two nics, and something is wrong in the config and keeps overwriting resolve.conf so my dns doesnt work. how to fix?
2011-10-20T13:46:00.000Z	devians		because for some reason ubuntu is looking for internet on eth0 when it exists on eth1

2011-10-20T13:49:00.000Z	devians	jasef	llutz_ could this be a symptom of misconfiguration in the dhcp server on eth0?
