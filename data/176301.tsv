2006-06-29T15:47:00.000Z	soundray	gavinchappell	that's right. But the thing about "not having a firewall" is a highly popular piece of anti-Linux FUD.
2006-06-29T15:48:00.000Z	gavinchappell	soundray	OK, I didn't term it very well. There is a firewall present, but out of the box on Ubuntu it doesn't do anything
