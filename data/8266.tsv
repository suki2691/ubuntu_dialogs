2011-11-02T00:58:00.000Z	occupant		So I'm in a three monitor setup and I can't seem to specify the position of the launcher. Everything I read says that it's supposed to follow whatever the primary display is, but mine is staying on the leftmost display (whatever display I configure to be left) instead of the primary. anyone know if I can override this somehow?
