2008-01-14T00:26:00.000Z	Patogen		What do I do with a process that I can't kill? kill, killall, top, gnome-system-monitor -- none of them can kill it
2008-01-14T00:28:00.000Z	runemaste644	Patogen	try xkill then click on the window of the stubborn process
2008-01-14T00:29:00.000Z	runemaste644		ok i need a less crowded channel to get support in
2008-01-14T00:32:00.000Z	Patogen	runemaste644	I tried that, didn't work, however kill -9 did it
