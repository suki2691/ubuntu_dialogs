2011-05-19T04:33:00.000Z	zinadork		ntfs config tool is what screwed it up in the first place
2011-05-19T04:33:00.000Z	zinadork		I dual boot with Windows 7
2011-05-19T04:34:00.000Z	KM0201	zinadork	i've never used fstab to auto mount, and i've never had a problem w/ my windows partitions on a dual boot machine
