2006-08-23T14:42:00.000Z	petar12		Hi, I have a question about my formatting my external hard drive.  I would like to be able to use it when in ubuntu and windows xp, however I will be using files that are larger than 4gb.  I know that kicks out fat32, so I was wondering what I should go with.
2006-08-23T14:43:00.000Z	petar12		I was planning on going with ext3, I just wanted to make sure that the windows support is there.  I have seen some drivers but I wanted to ask others about their opinions.
2006-08-23T14:44:00.000Z	petar12		So the ext3 drivers for xp are stable?
