2007-01-25T09:57:00.000Z	rellik_		how do I find out why I can't run terminal?
2007-01-25T09:59:00.000Z	bruenig	rellik_	what happens when you do alt+f2 to get the run dialog and run gnome-terminal? does that work?
2007-01-25T10:00:00.000Z	rellik_	bruenig	no, alt-F2 -> 'gnome-terminal' doesn't seem to do anything
