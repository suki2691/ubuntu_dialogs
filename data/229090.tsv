2007-01-20T11:58:00.000Z	mwe	hexidigital	no that wont work I think
2007-01-20T12:00:00.000Z	mwe	hexidigital	sudo apt-get --purge remove xserver-xorg-core might work
2007-01-20T12:02:00.000Z	mwe	hexidigital	yeah. xserver-xorg-core seems to want to remove everything here. haven't tried your own suggestion
