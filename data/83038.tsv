2008-08-27T05:04:00.000Z	floppyears	carandraug	all distros will work the same, you probably want a light gui such as blackbox
2008-08-27T05:05:00.000Z	carandraug	floppyears	I was thinking about fluxbox which I'ma lready used or maybe try ratpoison which as intrigued me for a long time
2008-08-27T05:08:00.000Z	floppyears	carandraug	any of those will work just fine. Just don't try using gnome or kde since it will make the machine a bit slow
