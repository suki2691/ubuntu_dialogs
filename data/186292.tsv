2006-10-21T12:08:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Ademan	judging by his background, he might be fine upgrading.
2006-10-21T12:11:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	Ademan	he might be safe upgrading, since it's just a base system he has anyway...
2006-10-21T12:11:00.000Z	Ademan	BHSPitLappy	OH, prolly fine then, i dunno though, it was a PAIN for me, and a lot of other people
