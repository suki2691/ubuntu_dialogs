2009-12-12T17:18:00.000Z	Rods_Tiger		It's been suggested I use feh, and I am, but even when set to random it's hardly random - always starts in the same shot, but theres no other info displayed, such as exif, current time current weather, etc. look, you've seen photoframes in shops, haven't you? I want that sort of thing, but using a computer and monitor I already have.
