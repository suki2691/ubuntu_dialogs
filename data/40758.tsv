2010-03-03T09:45:00.000Z	jarray52		I'm experiencing periodic disconnects using Ubuntu Netbook remix. Does anyone know what could cause this?
2010-03-03T09:46:00.000Z	robb	jarray52	possibly similiar to USB power cycle issues?
2010-03-03T09:46:00.000Z	jarray52	robb	Sorry. I didn't understand what you meant.
2010-03-03T09:48:00.000Z	jarray52	robb	I don't think it is a USB power cycle issue. The disconnects occur while the computer is being actively used.
