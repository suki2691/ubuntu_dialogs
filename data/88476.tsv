2008-06-05T20:12:00.000Z	Shebsa		Does anyone know how to install and configure java? I need it to code, I searched Google but can't find anything that I get
2008-06-05T20:14:00.000Z	PrivateRolf	Shebsa	Go to synaptic and install java-common
2008-06-05T20:15:00.000Z	PrivateRolf	Shebsa	Idk. I'm not familiar with java.  if it doesn't work, try searching for those.    But java in itself will work
