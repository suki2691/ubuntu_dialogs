2007-12-12T12:18:00.000Z	jtaby		can I use the text-based installer to install the full gui version of ubuntu 7.10 ?
2007-12-12T12:18:00.000Z	samdouglas	jtaby	Yeah, should be able to if you get the alternate install disk
2007-12-12T12:20:00.000Z	samdouglas	jtaby	ah, the server one won't have the full desktop packages on it
2007-12-12T12:20:00.000Z	jtaby	samdouglas	well, i guess i really only need the gui
