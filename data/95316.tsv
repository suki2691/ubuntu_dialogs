2008-04-06T12:30:00.000Z	sknh_		can anyone explain me what ">logfile 2>&1" means?
2008-04-06T12:30:00.000Z	macogw	sknh_	2> means to pass stderr (standard error)
2008-04-06T12:31:00.000Z	macogw	sknh_	i think the 2>&1 means to output both standard out and standard error...
2008-04-06T12:31:00.000Z	sknh_	macogw	Starnestommy : thanks
