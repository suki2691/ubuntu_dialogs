2006-12-27T16:05:00.000Z	viller		I can't start Ubuntu. I checked the partition through livecd and the /dev folder doesn't contain hdd, hda or hdc. How is that possible? WHat can I do?
2006-12-27T16:06:00.000Z	Flannel	viller	did you check the liveCDs /dev? or the harddrive itself?  (When you use the liveCD, it doesn't mount your HDs filesystem 'in place')
2006-12-27T16:07:00.000Z	Flannel	viller	er, nevermind.
