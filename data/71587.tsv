2008-12-13T12:29:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	boozary	28 Could not reserve enough space for object heap  -that's not a nice error to get. might try rebooting and trying again. i don't know if rebooting will help tho. might just get the same error.

2008-12-13T12:30:00.000Z	boozary	onetinsoldier	oops thank you :-) too oOarthurOo
2008-12-13T12:32:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	boozary	you're welcome.. but oOarthurOo has the better solution since that was not a 'memory heap' type of error
