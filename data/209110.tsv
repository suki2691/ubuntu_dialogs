2006-10-24T07:41:00.000Z	robin		 hello, I am trying to install the k7 kernel using the command line in edgy, I am doing it the same way I always have in other versions but its not showing up in grub, any idea's anyone?
2006-10-24T07:41:00.000Z	Terminus	robin	i heard that k7 has been deprecated in edgy.
2006-10-24T07:43:00.000Z	Terminus	robin	there's supposed to be a replacement for it but i can't quite remember
2006-10-24T07:44:00.000Z	Terminus	robin	there. you're supposed to use generic.
