2008-06-29T18:50:00.000Z	Anderson		if I get an error when doing ./configure that it can not find zlib, what package do I need?
2008-06-29T18:50:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Anderson	 fire up synaptic look for 'zlib' and it will have -dev at the end of the name.
2008-06-29T18:51:00.000Z	Anderson	dr_Willis	thank you too
2008-06-29T18:51:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Anderson	 i normally do a 'apt-cache search zlib | grep dev' :) to get a short list of potential packages
