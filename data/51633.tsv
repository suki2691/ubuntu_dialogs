2012-01-29T22:03:00.000Z	andai		I just got a 2nd hand computer with a broken CD drive. I don't have a spare CD drive. Can I put its hard drive in my good computer, install ubuntu on there, then put it back in? I.e. is it smart enough to detect the changed hardware and load the appropriate drivers when I put it back

2012-01-29T22:06:00.000Z	andai		so let me rephrase: Can I install Ubuntu for another computer by putting its hard drive into this one? Will that work OK?
