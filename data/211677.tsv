2005-10-21T06:59:00.000Z	ethy		The command "glxinfo | grep" doesn't seem to be right... What did I do wrong?
2005-10-21T07:00:00.000Z	njan	ethy	glxinfo |grep something
2005-10-21T07:00:00.000Z	njan	ethy	grep looks for 'something', grep on its own looks for nothing and will return nothing
2005-10-21T07:00:00.000Z	ethy	njan	and sn9: Thanks.
