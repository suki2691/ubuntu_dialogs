2008-07-25T00:43:00.000Z	hwilde	bunz	how would you find that
2008-07-25T00:43:00.000Z	bunz	hwilde	how would i find what? i just did dpkg -S scp, but you'd do apt-get install openssh-client if that's what you mean...
2008-07-25T01:04:00.000Z	bunz	hwilde	if you run it with full path like /usr/bin/scp hwilde@blahblah:file . it works?
