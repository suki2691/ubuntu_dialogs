2008-07-01T16:49:00.000Z	OB1FoShoB		is there something easier than 'linux from scratch!' i could use to build a custom iso of ubuntu?  i want to include the software packages i've added myself and custom settings, but want the created iso to probe for new hardware on install...

2008-07-02T00:28:00.000Z	joaopinto	OB1FoShoB	not really
