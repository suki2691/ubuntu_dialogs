2007-09-05T07:14:00.000Z	nichos		hi all, i seem to have lost all my window decorations. beryl is up and running fine, but no window decorations since rebooting - where to start?
2007-09-05T07:14:00.000Z	h1st0	nichos	do you have emerald installed?
2007-09-05T07:15:00.000Z	h1st0	nichos	also support for 3d desktops is in #ubuntu-effects
2007-09-05T07:15:00.000Z	h1st0	nichos	just a tip try hitting alt +f2 and typing in emerald --replace
