2006-08-04T14:43:00.000Z	scott		can anyone help me with a media/firefox related question. when for example palying music via flash in a window in firefox, if i then browse in a new tab to a different website or refresh the current page then my music/video stutters in the other tab (in flash etc) while the current page loads. is there an way to avoid it from stuttering?

2006-08-04T14:45:00.000Z	scott		because what im streaming is very low bandwidth, i have an 8mb connection and its 64kb audio
