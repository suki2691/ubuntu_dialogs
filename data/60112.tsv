2009-04-18T17:46:00.000Z	xDaReaperx		no i mean liken normal apps like adobe and stuff or some utilities and anti viruses
2009-04-18T17:47:00.000Z	musikgoat|eee	xDaReaperx	the appdb at winehq.org would tell you if it would work well
2009-04-18T17:54:00.000Z	musikgoat|eee	xDaReaperx	you should check in #winehq   but the general understanding is that stable is suggested unless a certain app works better with the dev version
