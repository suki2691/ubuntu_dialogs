2010-05-02T06:03:00.000Z	Zuka		anyone know where to get drivers for an NVIDIA 8600GTS? the ones from NVIDIA.com seem to not work on ubuntu 9.04
2010-05-02T06:04:00.000Z	Zuka		as in, nvidia's drivers are in .run format, don't know how to open them
2010-05-02T06:04:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Zuka	the .run format implies an executable
2010-05-02T06:10:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	Zuka	if possible use the builtin driver dialog instead, if you don't do that, you run a big risk of breaking your installation to a point that can only be fixed by adding kernel parameters and diving into config files on the terminal
