2008-01-25T23:02:00.000Z	Tetracomm		Does anyone know of any Sine wav generators that can work in Ubuntu?
2008-01-25T23:03:00.000Z	tritium	Tetracomm	do you just need time-value pairs?
2008-01-25T23:03:00.000Z	tritium	Tetracomm	a sine-wav generator, or generically, a function generator, is a piece of electronic equipment.
