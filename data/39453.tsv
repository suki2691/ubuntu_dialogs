2012-03-25T12:02:00.000Z	beata		I'm looking for a tutorial/howto about theme creation; searching has so far yielded only bits and pieces. I'm really just looking for a way to make icons/UI elements bigger so I can *see* them without a magnifying glass. Heh.

2012-03-25T12:11:00.000Z	beata	Crowler	Beg to differ? The theme files I'm looking at are mostly complicated text files with what appear to be drawing commands, for which I have yet to find documentation. Admittedly, I have managed to puzzle out a little bit, but it's still Klingon to me, and some of the snippets I've googled up don't seem to do anything.
