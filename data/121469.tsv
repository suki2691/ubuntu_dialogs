2007-09-20T11:17:00.000Z	arialth	alex1000	/usr/bin/update-manager
2007-09-20T11:18:00.000Z	arialth	alex1000	I installed 7.04 off cd, but i still had to update it
2007-09-20T11:20:00.000Z	arialth	alex1000	Oh.... wow, i dunno. If I had that answer 6 months ago... I dont think you can run an update without net access... Youd need to download the packages individually and then make a repo and use it to run updates... i think...
