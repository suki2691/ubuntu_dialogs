2008-11-07T14:08:00.000Z	ay^	gigel2007	I just click it a few types and those long distance connections pop up from time to time. If the signal is too low it wont show up
2008-11-07T14:09:00.000Z	ay^	gigel2007	well it they don't have signal, you can't
2008-11-07T14:10:00.000Z	gigel2007	ay^	no way, for example airodump sees way more
