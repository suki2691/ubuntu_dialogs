2005-05-26T06:33:00.000Z	SantaOne		Sorry for the offtopic-question:  Is there anyone from the USA ?  I am going to fly to the USA in the next time,  and the cheapest destination is Orlando.  So I try to find a VERY cheap way to travel from Orlando to Los Angeles (maybe by Bus or train?)  what is the cheapest way?

2005-05-26T06:40:00.000Z	SantaOne	thingfish	where can I get such a cheao ticket?  The cheapest I found was about 130 Dollar  (Orlando - Los Angeles [one way] )
