2008-10-21T01:03:00.000Z	markw_		I've had a few times in ubuntu where it'd stop launching apps, recently (5 minutes ago), it stopped launching terminals. :(  I'm thinking some background process is silently dying and killing off the desktop stuff, reboot :( or init single/exit fixes it.

2008-10-21T01:06:00.000Z	markw_	mongolai	everything looked normal.  Strife89 yes, went to the first virtual terminal, and restarted services.
