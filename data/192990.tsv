2006-03-27T12:29:00.000Z	Russ_		I would echo Tido's question. I'd like to set up my Ubuntu computer as a VPN server. Where would I start?
2006-03-27T12:31:00.000Z	Tido	Russ_	I just found openVPN and Poptop as solutions
2006-03-27T12:31:00.000Z	Tido		though, their names are all I know about them atm :p
2006-03-27T12:32:00.000Z	Russ_	Tido	I've heard of OpenVPN. Looking up some setup instructions now.
