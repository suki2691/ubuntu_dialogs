2009-01-24T19:05:00.000Z	adam1	danbhfive	the prestashop forum?  i have tried there and haven't found answer to my question
2009-01-24T19:06:00.000Z	danbhfive	adam1	did you ask your question there?
2009-01-24T19:08:00.000Z	adam1	danbhfive	im posting a question at the moment.  i've also emailed them.  it would be better for me to find some sort of real-time help though because i'd like a quick response and also will probably have follow-up questions once i solve current problem
