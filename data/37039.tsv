2010-09-08T23:19:00.000Z	icedoe		Hey, I'm trying to get a video file from a Flip Video camera to play through Ubuntu 9.10. It claims to be in the mp4 format, and I have ubuntu-restricted-extras. When I try to play the file I get a message saying "could not determine type of stream". What should I look for?
