2009-02-01T02:03:00.000Z	unop	beefcircuit	because at some point you used the CD and APT still considers it to be a repository (that is chosen over other repositories)
2009-02-01T02:06:00.000Z	beefcircuit	unop	would I look in etc/apt to change the ranking or would gnome have a settings area to do this?
