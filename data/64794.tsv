2010-08-14T18:46:00.000Z	lsottani		so what i have to do now?
2010-08-14T18:46:00.000Z	lsottani		anyway a brand new install should solve the problem, theoretically
2010-08-14T18:47:00.000Z	lsottani		ok i try the joli install :(
2010-08-14T18:48:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	lsottani	why not try installing without being root, and using a regular account with sudo - to verify that's not causing the issue?  Just a suggestion...
