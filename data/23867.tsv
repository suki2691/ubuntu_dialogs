2011-05-18T07:28:00.000Z	leftiness		I recently purchased an RTL8191SEvB pci wireless card. I installed the driver and firmware on the disc. I have wireless connectivity. However, it drops out. When it drops out, the only way I can get it to connect again is by restarting. The only way I've managed to maintain connectivity is to keep a ping to google.com going. It seems that it drops out as soon as connectivity stops being ideal. Has anyone experienced anything like

2011-05-18T07:32:00.000Z	leftiness	Onryo	I realize that it's known for problems. I regret not checking that beforehand. I'm using kernel 2.6.38. I expect that the channel is the issue as it's the only lead I've noticed in forums, so I'm only checking here as a formality. I do have an Optimus V with Android 2.2, though I'm unsure how that would help.
