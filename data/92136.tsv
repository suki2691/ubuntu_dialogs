2008-05-15T20:42:00.000Z	noob-africa_		Question: Mplayer can load/mount my SVCD media, but I cannot mount the same disc under GNOME. In order to convert the media to another format, the disc has to be mounted. DeVeDe will not mount it. It doesnt appear under Nautilus. How do I mount it?

2008-05-15T20:44:00.000Z	noob-africa_	gordonjcp	ok... so how do i work around?
