2012-08-08T00:36:00.000Z	Agamemnus		does anyone know how I might be able to download and install libbfd-2.21.53, and/or find out the last installed version of it on my system?
2012-08-08T00:37:00.000Z	spirit3_	Agamemnus	Possibly not the best way to do it but 'find /lib -name libbfd*'
2012-08-08T00:39:00.000Z	spirit3_	Agamemnus	just delete it (rm <filename>)
2012-08-08T00:39:00.000Z	spirit3_	Agamemnus	deleting the link only deletes the link, not the file it's pointing to
