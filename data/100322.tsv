I have an IBM thinkpad laptop (older model) that I just bought a USB wireless access dongle for.. the brand is "netcomm" and I can't find that brand anywhere in this list at the ubuntu forums (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported). Is there any advice for newer brands/models?
