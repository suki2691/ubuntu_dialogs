2011-04-26T01:56:00.000Z	abountu		I installed a fresh new version of ubuntu on my new laptop, although my cpu is intell (64bit) it keeps selecting amd 64 packages, any idea what's causing this?
2011-04-26T01:57:00.000Z	abountu		is it likely that I install the wrong version of ubuntu (amd) on an intell machine? does that work?

2011-04-26T01:58:00.000Z	arand	abountu	intel is licensing amd's technology, hence the name has stuck.
