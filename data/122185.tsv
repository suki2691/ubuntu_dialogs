2008-12-10T05:39:00.000Z	corinth		I can't figure out how to check the md5sum of a disc I just burned using md5sum in the terminal. A little help?
2008-12-10T05:40:00.000Z	gnutron	corinth	md5sum filename.iso   [smash enter] you check sums Before you burn.
2008-12-10T05:41:00.000Z	corinth	gnutron	and that will compare the md5sum of my disc? (not the ISO)
2008-12-10T05:41:00.000Z	gnutron	corinth	do the md5sum filename.iso if its ok, your disk should be fine.
