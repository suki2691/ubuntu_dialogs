2010-12-30T21:09:00.000Z	Rockj		hm, anyone could assist me in installing acerhk-source package for getting my wireless to work? I'd want to make sure that the acerhk packages always gets recompiled and installed after new kernel updates since im giving away my laptop to my sister..

2010-12-30T21:10:00.000Z	gobbe	Rockj	you could backlist kernel-updates and do it manually every now and then
2010-12-30T21:10:00.000Z	Rockj	gobbe	yes there is, graphicsdrivers uses it. dont know the name of it, some posthook function
