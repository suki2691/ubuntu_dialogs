2005-11-01T09:18:00.000Z	Anjay		Hey all, I was in here last night and asked about whether Ubuntu could resize an NTFS partition. I was told it could, but that it could not format it. Therefore from this I gather if I used Ubuntu to resize my NFTS partition, it wouldn't be able to install itself on the one part of this? Cheers.

2005-11-01T09:19:00.000Z	giggsey		because resizing it would leave HDD free space, and then you just create a new partition
2005-11-01T09:20:00.000Z	Anjay	giggsey	So Ubuntu should be able to make my two NTFS partitions smaller and then install Ubuntu in the free space (not forgetting the SWAP partition)?
