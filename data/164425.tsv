2007-12-26T19:27:00.000Z	th_		hm.. is there any way to restart X from command line (without killall or such :P and as non-root)? kind of like ctrl-alt-backspace but scripted
2007-12-26T19:29:00.000Z	wols	th_	gnome-session
2007-12-26T19:30:00.000Z	th_	wols	i think it's not exactly the same as hitting ctrl-alt-backspace
2007-12-26T19:30:00.000Z	wols	th_	that key combo stops X, it doesn't start it as you asked
