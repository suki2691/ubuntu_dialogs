2005-06-14T06:40:00.000Z	sebby		Hi there.. i really desperately need to install windows on a second partition on my drive, but i am using lilo as a bootmanager
2005-06-14T06:40:00.000Z	sebby		could someone possibly assist me in migrating to grub?

2005-06-14T06:41:00.000Z	dooglus	sebby	why do you think you need to migrate to grub?
