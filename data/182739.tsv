2008-03-23T03:06:00.000Z	Pelo	sean2000	 because of copyright restrictions in some countries,  the ubuntu team cannot include dvd support right out of the box , so you need to install a few pacakges to get it going, just follow the instrucions in the links we gave you , if you get stuck at one of them just ask us how to do that one and we'll help yo9u out
