2005-04-21T07:51:00.000Z	fgx	thundr	ok. what it is not doing now. so i'll file a bug.
2005-04-21T07:51:00.000Z	thundr	fgx	is that a fresh install of hoary, or did you dist-upgrade?
2005-04-21T07:53:00.000Z	fgx	thundr	dist-upgrade. but i had read release notes: i added RESUME=/dev/hda3 in mkinitrd.conf
