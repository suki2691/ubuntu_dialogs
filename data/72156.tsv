2009-08-05T05:02:00.000Z	radioactivegamer		I'm trying to connect to a network in Xchat and all I get is * Unknown host. Maybe you misspelled it?
2009-08-05T05:03:00.000Z	radioactivegamer		can someone please help?
2009-08-05T05:04:00.000Z	Radtoo	radioactivegamer	well, if you are here, perhaps it is exactly what it said for that other server?
2009-08-05T05:07:00.000Z	Radtoo	radioactivegamer	how about the ssl / proxy settings in xchat?
