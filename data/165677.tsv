2010-06-11T19:37:00.000Z	craigbass1976	New2Ubuntu	otherwise, some knucklehead can come along when you go to lunch and break stuff willy-nilly.  It's also a reminder "Do I really want to do that?" that's handy sometimes
2010-06-11T19:39:00.000Z	craigbass1976	New2Ubuntu	true; I only type a pass now for updates and in terminals when I'm dorking with system files
