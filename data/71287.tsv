2009-09-24T07:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RukusX	The main consideration now is how much you need to hibernate, as hibernation saves your RAM compressed to the swap partition you need somewhat less than your physical memory for swap to be able to hibernate
2009-09-24T07:35:00.000Z	RukusX	Jordan_U	 thats fine and all. but i never plan on hibernating.
2009-09-24T07:35:00.000Z	RukusX	Jordan_U	 but that might be a good guideline to go by, for your total failsafe minimum. its not a bad point
