2011-09-09T00:31:00.000Z	zykotick9	mephist0	/etc/resolv.conf perhaps
2011-09-09T00:40:00.000Z	zykotick9	mephist0	FYI i believe NetworkManager will overright resolv.conf (when it wants to), there should/might be a way to set DNS in N-M.  Good luck.
2011-09-09T00:47:00.000Z	mephist0	zykotick9	thanks a lot. Unfortunately no N-M. base system text mode. I can ping but cant resolve anything.
