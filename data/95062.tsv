2008-12-12T07:27:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Samus_Aran	You are able to do "dpkg -L package_name | grep file_name" and that can check if a file is served by a package

2008-12-12T07:28:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	dmsuperman	I am trying to search for the package that provides root certificates.  one of my systems has them, another does not.  I don't know what provides them
