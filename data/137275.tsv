2008-11-14T08:23:00.000Z	root_demon		header package will be separate
2008-11-14T08:24:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	root_demon	I know its separate, but is it something I should have?
2008-11-14T08:25:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	root_demon	after upgrade to Ibex, my system is booting from linux-image-386 ; but only headers I have installed are linux-headers-generic
