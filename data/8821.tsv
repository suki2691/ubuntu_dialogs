2011-10-14T02:51:00.000Z	TB|Vibe-X	ronbas	 you can do dist-upgrade ;)
2011-10-14T02:52:00.000Z	TB|Vibe-X	ronbas	otherwise you better do fresh install ... or mount iso on loop device, but i dont know how to upgrade then
2011-10-14T02:52:00.000Z	TB|Vibe-X	ronbas	maybe you can do CDROM as package source
