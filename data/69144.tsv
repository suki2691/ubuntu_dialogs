2010-07-02T00:59:00.000Z	FoolsRun		Hi, I'm running resize2fs on an LVM disk. It's been running for about 45 minutes. Should I be worried yet?
2010-07-02T01:01:00.000Z	FoolsRun		500GB, only 14G used if I'm reading everything correctly.
2010-07-02T01:03:00.000Z	FoolsRun		I wish there was a progress bar or something
2010-07-02T01:04:00.000Z	oCean_	FoolsRun	I think it's the -p option to resize2fs (probably for next time?)
