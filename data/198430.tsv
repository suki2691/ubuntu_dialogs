2006-03-12T12:11:00.000Z	GnarusLeo		Is there a torrent client wich is more similar to bitcomet?
2006-03-12T12:11:00.000Z	Bean	GnarusLeo	I've never used bitcomet, but I use bit tornado
2006-03-12T12:31:00.000Z	Bean	GnarusLeo	try bit tornado. My azuereus wouldn't work because of some updates it wanted :/
2006-03-12T12:31:00.000Z	Bean	GnarusLeo	also make sure nothing is blocking required ports
