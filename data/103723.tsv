2009-10-16T16:43:00.000Z	sixth		hi , i am using wubi to install ubuntu and when i enter the install it is stuck on a message about a missing root file system?
2009-10-16T16:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sixth	did you md5 check the wubi.exe file?
2009-10-16T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sixth	are you using a self downloaded iso or are you letting wubi pull  it down?
2009-10-16T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sixth	then all i can suggest is a chkdsk on the partition you are installing to to make sure it is healthy. i dont use wubi
