2007-05-31T10:41:00.000Z	jguest		I used up all the space on my box. Now I can't log in since there's no room left on the HD. I'm logged in now and can view the files, but can't delete any since I don't have permission. How do I change permissions so that I can delete some files?
2007-05-31T10:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jguest	sudo
2007-05-31T10:43:00.000Z	jguest	Jordan_U	i don't know the su password for the ubuntu cd
2007-05-31T10:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jguest	*sudo* not su, there is no root account
