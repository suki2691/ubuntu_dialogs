2008-05-20T19:01:00.000Z	CapeTown-HardyHe		I have logged into my new install of Hardy about 10 times now and the resolution is 800x600. However once (the 3rd time) it set the screen res to 1600x1200 (correct for my screen and I quite liked that although it was just automatic and out of the blue). It has been 800x600 since then and this is driving me crazy. Some setting menus in ZoneMinder are off the screen and I can't click save button at the bottom. How do I set the res
2008-05-20T19:02:00.000Z	garrett__	CapeTown-HardyHe	try ctrl+alt+(plus button on the numpad)
2008-05-20T19:02:00.000Z	garrett__	CapeTown-HardyHe	or ctrl+alt+(minus button on the numpad)
2008-05-20T19:03:00.000Z	garrett__	CapeTown-HardyHe	that'll cycle through resolutions available to x, so you can at least save your work or whatever.
