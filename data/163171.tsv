2006-11-04T07:16:00.000Z	skelter	cryptonic	chmod +x whatever.sh; ./whatever.sh
2006-11-04T07:22:00.000Z	skelter	cryptonic	yes it does, it just doesn't tell you about it
2006-11-04T07:24:00.000Z	skelter	cryptonic	the "." in ./whatever.sh refers to the current directory. the "/home/blahblah" means you don't need to put the "."
