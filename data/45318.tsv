2009-10-31T18:32:00.000Z	usser	dAlfa89_	that depends on what /dev node that other hdd is and what filesystem is on it
2009-10-31T18:41:00.000Z	dAlfa89_	usser	sorry to bother you, would it be safe to assume that the name of the drive (In /dev/disk/by-uuid) would be the name I put in fstab, before the mounting point?
2009-10-31T18:44:00.000Z	usser	dAlfa89_	yes, also run blkid just to make sure
