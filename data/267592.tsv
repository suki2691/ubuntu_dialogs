2011-04-06T23:10:00.000Z	Jastur		What utility is used in the text based install for setting up harddrives? I'm looking to access this tool while inside the livecd.

2011-04-06T23:11:00.000Z	maco	Jastur	oh, yeah cuz the gui doesnt have lvm on the cd at all
2011-04-06T23:13:00.000Z	maco	Jastur	youd need to install lvm on the livecd and then manually set it up. i dont know if ubiquity would know what to do with it though
