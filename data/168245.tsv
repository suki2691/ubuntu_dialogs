2006-09-24T16:14:00.000Z	sharap	chronoAZ	this guide contains help for setting up a mail server, as well as other servers: http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.06
2006-09-24T16:17:00.000Z	chronoAZ	sharap	that only says how to install
2006-09-24T16:19:00.000Z	sharap	chronoAZ	for configurations see the documentation.  I actually followed the guide I sent you and installed ISPConfig as well, which handles configuration of the mail server as well.  However, ISPConfig requires all the other servers to be installed as well.
