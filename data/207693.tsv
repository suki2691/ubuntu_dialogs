2006-09-26T16:50:00.000Z	juanjo		i am trying to install ubuntu in a macbook, but i get again and again the "no syncing: io-apic + timer doesn't work' kernel panic ... isn't possible to install ubuntu?

2006-09-26T16:52:00.000Z	Plouj	juanjo	did you google?
2006-09-26T16:53:00.000Z	juanjo	Plouj	of course, but i haven't found a solution for that problem.
