2009-09-29T03:06:00.000Z	Bob_Dole	dermot	I believe that had support dropped recently in 9.04, the open source drivers can be hit or miss with ATI cards around that time.
2009-09-29T03:07:00.000Z	Bob_Dole	dermot	the open source driver, or "VESA" is the only thing you can do with the x600. THe proprietary driver has to use an old X org version, which isn't easy to install on 9.04
