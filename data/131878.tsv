2007-11-29T18:58:00.000Z	gaga		Hi there, does anybody know why there are no pidgin 2.3 packages in the repos (or why a old, patched version has been added instead of the new one?)
2007-11-29T18:58:00.000Z	ikonia	gaga	its not been packaged yet
2007-11-29T18:59:00.000Z	gaga	ikonia	what do you expect, when will pidgin 2.3 be added?
2007-11-29T18:59:00.000Z	ikonia	gaga	no idea
