2011-02-01T14:51:00.000Z	GuteX		a little Q: I have the possibility to run 64bit but as what i can see Ubuntu recomends 32Bit what is prefered? 32 or 64?
2011-02-01T14:52:00.000Z	GuteX		in windows i know they have to use 64 to use all memory above 3.2 gb or something is it similar in linux?
2011-02-01T14:52:00.000Z	llutz_	GuteX	it is
2011-02-01T14:53:00.000Z	llutz_	GuteX	so use 64bit or 32bit + pae-kernel
