2008-12-27T07:03:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	nitesh	roger, include what kind of network card you are using in your problem description then
2008-12-27T07:06:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	nitesh	it should be fairly straightforward then. what is the problem when you try to get online?
2008-12-27T07:11:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	nitesh	ok, well just keep asking. i probably sholdn't have said anything since i'm not that good with networking. however, i do know my way around  a little, but not enough, sorry. it'd probably still be good for people in here to know what network card(brand/model) it is.
