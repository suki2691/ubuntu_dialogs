2011-02-28T10:25:00.000Z	caffine	r000t	Jordan_U: that's way cool that it's so easy. i've been using fedora forever, and it's so annoying to have to skip releases since i don't want to rebuild my machine every six months. i've been thinking about ubuntu, but just finally getting the opportunity to try it without completely disrupting myself. thanks for your help!
