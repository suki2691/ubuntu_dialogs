2010-06-13T18:09:00.000Z	Captain_Derp	ubutom_	well this is a vista install. I did delete all the pointless dell recovery partitions though
2010-06-13T18:10:00.000Z	ubutom_	Captain_Derp	can only speak for Win7, it creates a partition called system reserved and in that appearently the bootloader resides, maybe you deletet that, think Vista uses the same bootloader
2010-06-13T18:11:00.000Z	ubutom_	Captain_Derp	you could boot from the vista disc and let it restore mbr, but you will ahve to reinstall grub after that as well
