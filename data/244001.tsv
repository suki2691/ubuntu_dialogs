2005-04-05T07:55:00.000Z	DakPowers		I recently installed Ubuntu on my old desktop and when everything's done and installed, I see a black screen... I can type in my name and pass and hear the OS start up, but it displays nothing... Is there a cure for this?
2005-04-05T07:57:00.000Z	DakPowers		Anyone?
2005-04-05T07:57:00.000Z	DakPowers		I didn't know if this was a common problem
