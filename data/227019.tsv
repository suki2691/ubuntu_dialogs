2007-01-19T17:59:00.000Z	selecta_g		Hello all, can someone offer me some help in choosing an IM program?
2007-01-19T06:00:00.000Z	selecta_g		I use GAIM but was looking for something to do video conference; does GAIM do that?
2007-01-19T06:00:00.000Z	selecta_g		OK, thanks... Is there a IM program with video capability?
2007-01-19T06:01:00.000Z	funkyHat	selecta_g	Gaim is planning to have video and voice support in the next major release... so not for a while. Kopete has some support for it I think.... aMSN has support for it for MSN messenger only
