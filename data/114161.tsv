2007-11-06T20:14:00.000Z	Liddan		How do I stop ubuntu from creating new .trash folders whenever I delete something? And how do I set it up so that when i hit delete the file is removed and not moved to trash?

2007-11-06T20:15:00.000Z	Liddan	Odd-rationale	Still creates .trash folders and I dont want to need to hit shift-del all the time..
