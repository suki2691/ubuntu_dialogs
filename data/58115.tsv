2009-11-02T01:05:00.000Z	KenBW2	JosephMarc	anything to be gained with Flash performance?
2009-11-02T01:07:00.000Z	JosephMarc	KenBW2	: I don't think so , flash is independent from the drivers, and doesn't "speed up", if you have flash issues you should file a bug or upgrade to a new version
2009-11-02T01:07:00.000Z	KenBW2	JosephMarc	not really a bug - just the usual juttery plying when in full screen
2009-11-02T01:08:00.000Z	JosephMarc	KenBW2	: yeah that won't be fixed by drivers
