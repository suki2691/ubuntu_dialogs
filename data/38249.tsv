2010-01-27T17:24:00.000Z	Coachj		please forgive the repeat: Is 8100 frames per 5 sec a decent frame rate for my ati 9000 card?
2010-01-27T17:25:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Coachj	did you look at the vendor's site to see if that is correct?
2010-01-27T17:25:00.000Z	Coachj	SpaceGhostC2C	no
2010-01-27T17:26:00.000Z	SpaceGhostC2C	Coachj	do that and also google the question, then come back here if you don't find anything. I'll help you after that.
