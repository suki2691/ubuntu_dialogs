2008-07-06T19:04:00.000Z	WinterWeaver		my macbook resolution changed to 1024x768, after playing with the "system >> preferences >> resolution" tool. Now I cant get it back to the nice resolution it was before I installed. Tried the dpk-reconfigure command but that is not working either. Can someone please asisst? (8.04)
