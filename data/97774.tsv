2009-04-01T02:37:00.000Z	Transience39		does flash still support only ubuntu 32 bit?
2009-04-01T02:38:00.000Z	Transience39		so there's no problem using x64 anymore?
2009-04-01T02:38:00.000Z	Transience39		okay, thanks
2009-04-01T02:39:00.000Z	Ienorand	Transience39	I'm using flash on 64bit, it seems to work... but sometimes it needs a reinstall randomly, dunno if that has anything to do with it though...
