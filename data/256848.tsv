2006-05-27T10:40:00.000Z	Managu	Corey	depending on the game, wine (free) or Cedega (commercial)
2006-05-27T10:41:00.000Z	Managu	Corey	nope.  If you want something that runs every windows program perfectly, run windows.
2006-05-29T14:30:00.000Z	Managu	Corey	I think there's a whole channel devoted to that
