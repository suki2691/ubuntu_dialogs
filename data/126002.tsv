2007-08-06T13:10:00.000Z	DeusEvo		hi, I just burned myself a bootable CD of 7.04 and although it boots fine, it tells me "/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off" and leaves me in a busybox command shell.  I googled the issue and it seems that it's somewhat common, but I haven't found any fixes yet
2007-08-06T13:10:00.000Z	DeusEvo		Any ideas?
2007-08-06T13:10:00.000Z	hwilde	DeusEvo	did you verify the cd
2007-08-06T13:16:00.000Z	DeusEvo	hwilde	yes, I did (when I burned it, my burning software verified it),  If I try to verify the CD from the live CD menu, i get the same error
