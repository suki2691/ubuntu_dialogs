2007-06-19T13:40:00.000Z	Pconfig		hey, i've just installed privoxy with tor on a server computer. Is it normal that it's running slow? I'm using it with some desktop client in the network. Is there any other proxy software stuff available that'd make it go faster?
2007-06-19T13:42:00.000Z	LinAsH	Pconfig	Tor IS slow, anyway
2007-06-19T13:43:00.000Z	Pconfig	LinAsH	Does privoxy work without tor? And does it work faster without?
2007-06-19T13:45:00.000Z	LinAsH	Pconfig	pricoxy works just great alone
