2005-11-17T08:17:00.000Z	LjL	Mabus06	the docs advise against setting a root password, and anyway i don't quite see what's gained by setting one
2005-11-17T08:19:00.000Z	LjL	Mabus06	just tell them they can "sudo -i", there's really no difference. that's unless they don't like their own password being used as a root password, but then, they can create a second user and use that one as their "normal" account, if they prefer
