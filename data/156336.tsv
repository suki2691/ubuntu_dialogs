2007-03-21T14:19:00.000Z	ddodo		i have a question, i have ubuntu running off the iso disk, tried making partitions with gparted, but it froze while resizing the ntfs and creating the 2 linux partitions.
2007-03-21T14:20:00.000Z	ddodo		Now, windows thinks the c drive is 22G, 6G free, whichi is what gparted was going to resize it to, but now gparted thinks its 30 G, 6 G free, and its a 40G HD
2007-03-21T14:21:00.000Z	ddodo		i go into g parted now, but its reading the wrong partition size
