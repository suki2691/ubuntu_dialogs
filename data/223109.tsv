2005-09-18T13:51:00.000Z	dabar		ok, I am now trying to burn some ubuntu live CDs, and I bought blank cds this morning, and I get an error from nautilus: There was an error writing to the CD:
2005-09-18T13:51:00.000Z	dabar		The system is too slow to write the CD at this speed. Try a lower speed. Tried twodifferent drives, and two separate instances of cds.
