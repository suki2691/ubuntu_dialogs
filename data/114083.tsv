2007-12-22T04:44:00.000Z	Les_Caesars		hm. Is there a lower-level way to do that? I was meaning to use wget
2007-12-22T04:45:00.000Z	UBUNTUISLOVED	Les_Caesars	try ie4linux
2007-12-22T04:46:00.000Z	Les_Caesars	UBUNTUISLOVED	not helping me. I'm on dialup and it fails roughly every 100KB. I was hoping on getting the files another way, and then using ies4linux. There's an iceberg below the tip--I just want to download ie from Microsoft.com
