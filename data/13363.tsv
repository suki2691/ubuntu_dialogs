2011-07-20T01:12:00.000Z	DrGrov		What could be the cause for this when I try to compile E17 from source? "./autogen.sh: 6: aclocal: not found"
2011-07-20T01:13:00.000Z	Algorith	DrGrov	sudo apt-get install automake
2011-07-20T01:18:00.000Z	DrGrov	Algorith	I found a list over at #e.de which tells me all the deps I need. I use Synaptic to search for them manually
2011-07-20T01:18:00.000Z	DrGrov	Algorith	Think you could help me check that list out to make sure I get everything I need?
