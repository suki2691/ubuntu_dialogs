2008-09-04T03:53:00.000Z	leeping2008		thanks for the advice :) Alternatives to xmms would be just as good as xmms itself... I wasn't too emotionally attached
2008-09-04T03:54:00.000Z	slamFIST	leeping2008	what was your reason to find something else?
2008-09-04T03:54:00.000Z	leeping2008	slamFIST	xmms depends on libglib1.2, and Hardy doesn't have that package.
