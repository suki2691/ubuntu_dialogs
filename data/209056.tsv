2008-04-14T02:14:00.000Z	Danish989		I have a quick question: I want to isntall ubuntu on a partition with fat32 file system, which install option should I choose from the ubuntu install partioner, so that my existing data doesn't get removed and ubuntu creates a ext3 partition for itself without touching any other data on that disk?
2008-04-14T02:16:00.000Z	Danish989		can someone answer a quick installation question please?
2008-04-14T02:16:00.000Z	andi5	Danish989	you do want to install into the fat32 formatted partition or not?  i think that makes no sense at all, just make sure you have enough space for linux on its own
