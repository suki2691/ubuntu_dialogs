2008-12-14T10:39:00.000Z	fwaokda		I ran clamav on my windows partition from ubuntu.  It caught some viruses that I suspected being there (some kind of rootkit thing and a couple others)  I was wondering is there anything else I should run/try before starting back up the windows partition.  I've heard of viruses reinstalling themselves once windows boots up... Also my clamav said that the engine was outdated but I couldn't find out where/how to update it can anyone hel
