2009-05-28T17:25:00.000Z	Orgazmo		I was wondering if someone could help me with an issue I'm having with K3D. I'm trying to burn a DVD ISO and after it burns, it fails verification due to the disc that was just burned being different to the original iso. I'm burning as slow as I can to avoid errors using DAO method. Has anyone got any suggestions as to what could be wrong?
