2011-05-25T10:41:00.000Z	moltendorf		Having a little trouble getting cron to work on Ubuntu Server 11.04; but I'm sort of new to it in general, so I guess that's to be expected.
2011-05-25T10:41:00.000Z	moltendorf		Anyone available to help?
2011-05-25T10:41:00.000Z	Flannel	moltendorf	Best to just ask the question, and if anyone can help, they will.  Make sure you have a carriage return at the end of the line.
