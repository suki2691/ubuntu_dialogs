2007-06-13T09:35:00.000Z	supaneko		I'm a little unsure of which encoding to go with (instead of MP3). How would an ogg fair against a FLAC? Which should I go with?
2007-06-13T09:36:00.000Z	supaneko		What would be a good bitrate to go with with OGG?
2007-06-13T09:37:00.000Z	supaneko		Hmm... Would the larger file size with FLAC be "worth it?" Would the lossless be much noticeable?
2007-06-13T09:38:00.000Z	tmatix	supaneko	probably not.... but the appeal for lossless is that you can decompress a FLAC file and get byte-for-byte exactly what you put in. so its nice for archival
