2011-05-04T01:43:00.000Z	Rehan	Xylch	hmm but i always have to choose the "try ubuntu" option then? i mean is there a way to install it on there but still have it be hardware agnostic
2011-05-04T01:44:00.000Z	Xylch	Rehan	I don't think that is possible, but I can't be sure, there is a way to save settings between live cd sessions when using a USB stick, you would have to research it tho.
