2007-05-18T11:07:00.000Z	specialbuddy		As of now, Aireplay-ng only supports injection on Prism2, PrismGT (FullMAC), Atheros, RTL8180, RTL8187 and Ralink. Injection on Centrino, Hermes, ACX1xx, Aironet, ZyDAS, Marvell and Broadcom is not supported because of firmware and/or driver limitations.  Does this mean I can't use intel for injection?
