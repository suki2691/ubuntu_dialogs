2009-01-20T03:21:00.000Z	olleorama		what is the easiest way to install a new linux-dist on a computer already running ubuntu?, As a dual boot system, I don't want to have problems with grub
2009-01-20T03:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	olleorama	to not have any grub issues.. virtualbox...
2009-01-20T03:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	olleorama	but it will run a bit slow, no effects 3d etc
2009-01-20T03:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	olleorama	then regular dial boot and deal with grub
