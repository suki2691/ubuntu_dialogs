2009-12-31T06:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	clop	you must upgrade to 9.04 first, otherwise yes
2009-12-31T06:48:00.000Z	clop	ActionParsnip	ok, neat -- when i do "update-manager -d" it asks me if i want to upgrade to 10.04?? is there something special i need to do to upgrade to 9.04 first?
2009-12-31T06:49:00.000Z	clop	ActionParsnip	thanks, i'll take a look at that
