2009-09-22T13:50:00.000Z	Djoef		Hi, I want to reconfigure a pc from scratch, having Ubuntu and windows XP as operating systems. What should I install first, to have an easy working dual boot solution ?
2009-09-22T13:50:00.000Z	Djoef		ok
2009-09-22T13:50:00.000Z	Djoef		then just run ubuntu cd, and it will be clear ?
