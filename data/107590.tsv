2008-05-17T11:50:00.000Z	MrEgg964		Hi all :) No more printing in Hardy since last update :( Is anybody else have this issue?
2008-05-17T11:51:00.000Z	RyanPrior	MrEgg964	I've heard the complaint a few times over the last couple weeks, so I'm sure you're not alone.
2008-05-17T11:52:00.000Z	MrEgg964	RyanPrior	Any idea where I should look to solve my problem?
2008-05-17T11:52:00.000Z	RyanPrior	MrEgg964	I don't know a darn thing about printers, so I can't really help much.
