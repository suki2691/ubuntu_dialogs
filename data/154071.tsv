2006-12-21T07:14:00.000Z	mohlertm		Anyone:  I am trying to get my dvd's to play in the mplayer that comes with edgy.  I have installed libdvdread3.  Next it told me to type the following into a terminal: "sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh".  When I do that it tells me that the "command not found".  can anyone help?

2006-12-21T07:15:00.000Z	mohlertm	PhibreOptix	 what does that mean?  do I type sudo first?
2006-12-21T07:15:00.000Z	PhibreOptix	mohlertm	Yes, type like sudo sh /usr/shar/doc/libdvdread3/examples/install-css.sh
