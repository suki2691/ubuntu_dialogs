2008-01-20T04:15:00.000Z	SaBot		Ok, my question: I installed Ubuntu 7.04 32-bit off the live cd just fine. I had to change the option from VGA to 1024x768 x32 on the boot screen from the cd though to make it work properly. Now I installed ubuntu, and I need to set that same option so my graphics stop screwing up, I cant do anything without it.
2008-01-20T04:15:00.000Z	SaBot		So how do I get Ubuntu to start up with that
