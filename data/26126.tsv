2010-09-24T16:56:00.000Z	maedox	thevibe	oh, I thought you were on the live-cd.  That is odd, but no unheard of.
2010-09-24T16:57:00.000Z	maedox	thevibe	I think the live-cd boots in a safer mode as the installer will try to check for more devices or something like that. the installer probably screws something up and booting in safe gfx mode might get your drivers installed properly.
