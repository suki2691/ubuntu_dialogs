2008-08-30T20:06:00.000Z	ilembitov		Hi, all. How can I get major updates to Ubuntu without adding Intrepid repos?
2008-08-30T20:07:00.000Z	bazhang	ilembitov	intrepid is not out for two months from now
2008-08-30T20:08:00.000Z	bazhang	ilembitov	you can use proposed repos, though that is at your own risk when it breaks
2008-08-30T20:08:00.000Z	ilembitov	bazhang	They aren't even as up2date as Debian testing (although Lenny freeze was long ago) either
