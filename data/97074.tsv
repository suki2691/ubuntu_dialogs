2008-03-19T01:22:00.000Z	PeterGriffin	leeping2008	you can download the source and compile you're kernel
2008-03-19T01:22:00.000Z	leeping2008	PeterGriffin	I'll try that.  Thanks :)
2008-03-19T01:23:00.000Z	PeterGriffin	leeping2008	but serious, it isn;t that hard. you can take all your old settings from youre current kernel
