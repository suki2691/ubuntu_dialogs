2010-06-08T05:30:00.000Z	quaa	Jordan_U	i agree.  this is an external my cuz bought and asked me to look at it to see if it was recoverable.  buying a external multidisk set is dumb imo
2010-06-08T05:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	quaa	Have you installed the "dmraid" package?
2010-06-08T05:34:00.000Z	quaa	Jordan_U	yes, tried dmraid -r and it  "no raid disks"
