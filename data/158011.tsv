2008-11-27T03:26:00.000Z	Brandano		is there any "proper" way to install Mplayer32 on an amd64 machine without having to use a chroot?
2008-11-27T03:27:00.000Z	Brandano		there used to be a package that did just that, but it was messy, and I doubt it has been kept updated
2008-11-27T03:27:00.000Z	Slart	Brandano	I think there's a mplayer32 package you can install.. at least I have had one of those installed before
