2010-05-02T08:47:00.000Z	_rahul_G_		Hello everyone. I am a Scala programmer using Ubuntu 9.04. The library I am using for my current project involves a lot of unicode symbols (mostly from Greek and Cyrillic alphabets). Is there any good way to type these unicode characters with minimum number of keystrokes?
