2011-01-05T02:37:00.000Z	xathrus		I am stuck, I loaded ubuntu 10.10 and as it loads for first run the graphics card will not load right. I can see the very top of the desktop and the mouse move around at the top, but the rest is blanked out. using nvidea geforce 8300. anybody seen this before?
2011-01-05T02:39:00.000Z	xathrus		I did get the updates but I will do it again. HOw do I load the proprietary updates not being able to see the desk top? is there a safe mode or something? Sorry, I am new to linux.
