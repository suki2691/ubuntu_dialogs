2011-04-16T23:55:00.000Z	th^^		is there any way to make unitys application top many show always like in mac? it's kind of unusable and annoying when it's in hover only.
2011-04-16T23:56:00.000Z	th^^		file, edit, etc menus only on hover
2011-04-16T23:57:00.000Z	th^^		this implementation for top application menu is useless :/ it needs to stay there at all times
2011-04-16T23:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	th^^	 some would dissagree.. it depends on what you are use dto and the display size :)
