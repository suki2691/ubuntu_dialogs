2010-02-13T00:19:00.000Z	davidisko	genii	ethernet is working 100% correctly. detected 4 broadcom ethernets and internet connectivity is working otherwise i would not be here..
2010-02-13T00:22:00.000Z	genii	davidisko	if it has 4 adapters, likely internet is connected to eth1 or eth2 or eth3 and not eth0 which is the default gateway
