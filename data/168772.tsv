2006-11-17T09:19:00.000Z	tgelter		hey all, I mixed up some different version of gtkpod (one from the repos and one from source) and now I can't load gtkpod...it just gives a segmentation fault, dumps a core, and won't start...how can I make things right? (removing and adding gtkpod from aptitude doesn't fix anything)

2006-11-17T09:20:00.000Z	tgelter	Admiral_Chicago	yes, I did
2006-11-17T09:21:00.000Z	Admiral_Chicago	tgelter	hmm no idea
