2007-09-06T06:49:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW	s0y	That's kind of open ended, What file, what codec, and what players are you using?
2007-09-06T06:49:00.000Z	s0y	Ray_at_UW	not sure about the file (mms stream?) and smplayer/vlc vs. wmp, mpc, winamp
2007-09-06T06:50:00.000Z	Ray_at_UW	s0y	Hrm... :) I'd look in google then. Probably codecs if anything.
