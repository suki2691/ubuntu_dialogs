2005-11-20T11:52:00.000Z	linukso		Hi! Does anyone know the status of ubuntu on apples iBook? What I read in the wiki wasn't very uplifting... Is it possible to get stuff like wlan and graphics working?

2005-11-20T11:53:00.000Z	raphink	linukso	many debian devs use debian on ibooks
2005-11-20T11:54:00.000Z	linukso	raphink	hm, sounds fine! So buying a iBook won't leave me stuck in mac osX missery :)?
