2011-08-17T23:49:00.000Z	Coelho_Silva		Hi there! My laptop suddenly does not boot from the hard drive anymore, however once inside ubuntu I can use both the windows and ubuntu partition. I reinstalled grub and it worked fine again, then the next day started having the same problem again. Any guesses? (HD is set as a bootable device)

2011-08-17T23:51:00.000Z	Coelho_Silva		Thought the same thing.
