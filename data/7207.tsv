2012-02-23T00:53:00.000Z	Canadian1296	blitz	javascript is a web scripting language, and it belongs in a web browser. Follow the guide, instead of trying to run it in a terminal.
2012-02-23T00:54:00.000Z	Canadian1296	blitz	I can, but you aren't listening. Javascript does not belong in a terminal.
2012-02-23T00:55:00.000Z	Canadian1296	blitz	Okay, I have no experience with jsc, and you can just create files with vim or something and open it in your browser. I would tell you how to use the command line but I dont know.
