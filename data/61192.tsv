2009-04-01T06:08:00.000Z	Sal--		I have my samba server running on my Ubuntu server. Both ports 445 and 139 are open. I modified the config to allow use of home directories, and created a samba user with a password and enabled the user. When I try to connect, it just simply times out and never connects. Any ideas where to go from here?
