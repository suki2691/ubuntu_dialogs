2010-08-22T08:23:00.000Z	aaddcc		I was on a tutorial that told me to install splashy and delete usplash... But now I want usplash back, but apt-get install usplash won't work.
2010-08-22T08:23:00.000Z	aaddcc		Can anyone help/
2010-08-22T08:24:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	aaddcc	ubuntu uses neither usplash  nor splashy
2010-08-22T08:24:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	aaddcc	it's "plymouth"
