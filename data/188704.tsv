2006-08-15T16:22:00.000Z	Canute		So i'm trying to install a new driver for my wireless network card, how do I find out what it is?
2006-08-15T11:51:00.000Z	Canute		I got my wireless working earlier today with Network Manager, so after a while i plugged a normal cable into it, had some small problems but it seemed to work. However, now I want to change back and the Network Manager only shows "Wired Network" grayed out.. if i right click, it shows Enable Networking, but not Enable Wireless. My wireless card is activated, so is there any simple solution?
