2008-11-13T03:11:00.000Z	mgolisch	uvacav	yeah disable the restart in gnome-session-properties
2008-11-13T03:14:00.000Z	uvacav	mgolisch	it seems gnome-panel isnt on that list (in session preferences). any other ideas?
2008-11-13T03:16:00.000Z	mgolisch	uvacav	hm yeah they seem to have removed that from the current session property thing
