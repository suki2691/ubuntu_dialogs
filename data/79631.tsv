2008-09-15T00:52:00.000Z	Leefmc		Question: If i already have 1 full hd setup for ubuntu, how hard is it to partition that and install windows on the 2nd partition? I'd like to setup a dual boot

2008-09-15T00:56:00.000Z	Leefmc	Kxx	So windows is going to stomp all over my linux install? Nothin i can do about that?
