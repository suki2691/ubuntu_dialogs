2012-10-05T15:55:00.000Z	datruth		I'm running Kubuntu 12.04 and I am having issues controlling the brightness of my screen it my hotkeys seem to work during boot (grub) and shutdown window but after Kubuntu loads I can no longer control the brightness can someone help with this?

2012-10-05T15:56:00.000Z	datruth	dr_willis	the keys work during boot up but after the o/s loads they no longer work.
2012-10-05T15:56:00.000Z	datruth	dr_willis	also I've tried passing switches to grub and still that doesn't work.
