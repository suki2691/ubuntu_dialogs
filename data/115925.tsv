2009-01-03T15:22:00.000Z	johnflux		I can set the essid and key etc for ath0, but dhclient doesnt get an ip.  Does this mean that dhcp isnt working, or that the key is wrong or what?
2009-01-03T15:22:00.000Z	johnflux		there doesnt seem to be any feedback?
2009-01-03T15:22:00.000Z	joeb3_	johnflux	does iwconfig show associated?
