2012-10-28T20:31:00.000Z	jfries		Hello! I'm experiencing some problems while upgrading from ubuntu 10.04 to 12.04 using the Update Manager. It made it all the way through the installation process, to the point where it asked me to reboot my machine, at which point it starts to boot up. It then says "The disk drive / is not ready yet or not present. Continue to wait; or Press S to skip mounting and M for manual recovery".
2012-10-28T20:31:00.000Z	jfries		If I press S it then says /tmp is not ready, and then UUID=<long id string> is not ready, and then it hangs and doesn't finish booting up.
2012-10-28T20:31:00.000Z	jfries		If instead of hitting S, I hit M then it prints the message "Root file system check failed" and starts up a maintenance shell. According to online help here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/udev/+bug/753853, I think I need to remount? I run the following "mount -n -o remount,rw /" which seems to make / writeable (before running that I can read but not edit the files in /).
