2008-02-22T11:03:00.000Z	cef		what sort of 'remote' folder?
2008-02-22T11:03:00.000Z	firefly2442	cef	on another machine/computer
2008-02-22T11:04:00.000Z	cef	firefly2442	either mount the fs across the network and then treat it the same as if it's local, or export the filesystem using rsync and use rdiff (not 100% sure that's a good idea though)
2008-02-22T11:05:00.000Z	firefly2442	cef	can I do it over SSH?
