2012-05-12T03:57:00.000Z	kgee		All I have is a broken user account, and a guest account I cant get root from; If I boot to recovery mode I can get root, but the / fs is mounted read-only. If I try to mount it as read/write, the computer locks up
2012-05-12T03:58:00.000Z	kgee		so I can't even get root access to the server to fix it :(
2012-05-12T03:58:00.000Z	escott	kgee	just remount the / partition read-write
2012-05-12T03:58:00.000Z	kgee	escott	how? the tool to automatically do this keeps freezing
