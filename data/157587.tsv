2007-02-10T12:11:00.000Z	blanky		okay thanks unop and NoStop
2007-02-10T12:11:00.000Z	blanky	unop	and NoStop I did '/dev/hda1   /mnt/vfat   vfat   umask=0000    0 0' and it seems to work, i can drag files in there, but if I ever encounter problems I'll be sure to remember that, thanks again guys, and yellow, I appreciate it!
2007-02-10T12:13:00.000Z	NoStop	blanky	found a bug in gedit, where when trying to edit a file, get an error about unable to save backup. Solution was to drop umask and use uid and gid. Still can't create backup but at least gedit stops presenting the error message.
