2009-04-22T00:09:00.000Z	pCarsten		I've got a conflict where apt-get insists on applying an upgrade at the same time that I'm removing a package that conflicts with that upgrade. How do I make apt-get withhold the update until I'm done removing the old package?

2009-04-22T00:18:00.000Z	pCarsten	cwillu	that was just what I needed. Thanks!
