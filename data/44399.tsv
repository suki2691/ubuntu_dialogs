2009-11-17T10:13:00.000Z	inveratulo	cba123	so it would be 'dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=4K' (this will run a LONG time as it writes ALL bits) and then the aforementioned dd command
2009-11-17T10:14:00.000Z	cba123	inveratulo	I don't really need all the bits, just moving a myth to another drive.  Might be quicker to reinstall, all the data is on another drive anyways.
