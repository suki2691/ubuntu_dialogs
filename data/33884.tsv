2010-10-03T18:38:00.000Z	marcosroriz		I got a new laptop, should I go for 10..04 or get the 10.10.?
2010-10-03T18:38:00.000Z	marcosroriz		no
2010-10-03T18:39:00.000Z	Ken8521	marcosroriz	10.10 isn't so bad, but it is just hitting release candidate.  you can install 10.04, or install 10.10... I've been really happy w/ 10.10 on 3 machines
2010-10-03T18:40:00.000Z	Ken8521	marcosroriz	not much new.. just program updates.. and the installer is a little different(thats all i've noticed)
