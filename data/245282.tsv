2005-08-29T14:06:00.000Z	michelp		I'm not so good at this package thing, I read the man page for sources.list but I'm still getting an error, I want to install the software and I use syntaptic to add the repository "deb http://download.librdf.org/binaries/ubuntu/hoary/" but it doesn't show up in the repo list and if I add it to source.list my self I get an error.  nayone know the right syntax?
