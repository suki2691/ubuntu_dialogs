2009-12-02T14:04:00.000Z	TommiH		Hi! I wonder if anyone can help me... I've done a minimalistic installation of karmic with enlightenment as DE and I'm using wicd as network manager. I installed the broadcom STA driver which should work with my card and iwlist scan shows my wireless network, but wicd won't find any wireless connections... Has anyone got experiences of wicd?
2009-12-02T14:05:00.000Z	jongbergs	TommiH	try removing wicd and use gnome network manager instead
2009-12-02T14:06:00.000Z	TommiH	jongbergs	Ok, gonna try that out.
2009-12-02T14:12:00.000Z	TommiH	jongbergs	Ok, I installed network-manager-gnome, how can I manage it? Do I have to restart?
