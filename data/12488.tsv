2012-05-15T09:42:00.000Z	Mischinka		Im trying:  apt-get dist-upgrade  to upgrade phpmyadmin now.
2012-05-15T09:42:00.000Z	zykotick9	Mischinka	what version of ubuntu are you using?  "lsb_release -sc" if you aren't sure
2012-05-15T09:51:00.000Z	zykotick9	Mischinka	dist-upgrade is the same as full-upgrade (with aptitude), so it means update EVERYTHING.  NOT related to updating to a new version of ubuntu at all.
2012-05-15T09:53:00.000Z	zykotick9	Mischinka	what's wrong with the version in the repo?
