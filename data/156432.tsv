2009-02-21T09:41:00.000Z	allan8904		is it possible to recompile all the packages you have installed from source using apt-get?
2009-02-21T09:42:00.000Z	genii	allan8904	Yup, with apt-build
2009-02-21T09:42:00.000Z	genii	allan8904	See again "apt-build" ...closest thing to gentoo emerge you'll get in *buntu
