2010-06-12T01:54:00.000Z	roolebo		For some reason vim doesn't react on "H" key, but "L" and "M" work as supposed. Is it ubuntu-related problem or bug in vim or maybe something else?
2010-06-12T01:56:00.000Z	Appl6	roolebo	Press MHMHMH.  The cursor moves for me.  What version of vim, and in the terminal or gvim?
2010-06-12T01:57:00.000Z	roolebo	Appl6	vim 7.2.330-1ubuntu3.
2010-06-12T02:02:00.000Z	roolebo	Appl6	it seems to be my config problem. the things gone right without .vimrc.  thanks
