2008-09-13T09:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	ubuntu9897	 the gparted tool, or use fdisk, or cfdisk if they are on the live cd.

2008-09-13T09:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	ubuntu9897	 i always use the gparted live cd.   that way none get mounted..  You could use the command line tools I guess.. or force the unmount..
