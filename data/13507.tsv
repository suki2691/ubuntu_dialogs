2011-09-14T01:06:00.000Z	julie101010	DTSuser	there is no translation between a mac and IP address...   the DHCP server is what assigns the IP address and would know what is assigned
2011-09-14T01:11:00.000Z	julie101010	DTSuser	that doesn't tell us why you need to get an IP address from a MAC address
