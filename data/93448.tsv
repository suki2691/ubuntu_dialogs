2008-12-07T07:42:00.000Z	remission		hello all.. can someone help me with nvidia legacy drivers on ubuntu 8.10?  i am not a complete n00b... and have been looking for answers to my problem for quite some time...  i usually use the 173 legacy drivers and they have worked for me in the past.. if i set them up on a fresh install they work but if i update through the update manager the drivers are broken and no longer work.
