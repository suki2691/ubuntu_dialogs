2012-10-19T22:23:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Marcin_	Wubi does not run from the ISO has not for some time
2012-10-19T22:26:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Marcin_	The .exe should download the OS, not sure but having the ISO there may be causing a problem here is the wubi wiki. Please use nicks in the channel. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide
