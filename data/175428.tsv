2006-07-11T08:17:00.000Z	Nutubuntu		Hello all. My upgrade to Dapper from Breezy worked EXCEPT for tetex. That installation fails during the dpkg --configure of tetex-bin when fmutil-sys apparently tries to translate a file called cp227.tcx ... I *need* tetex. Anyone got any idea how to get it to install?
