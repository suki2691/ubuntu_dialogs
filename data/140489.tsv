2007-04-03T15:45:00.000Z	Digitass		newbie here. Im trying to install Linux media center. Had ubuntu desktop version (easy to use and worked perfect), but it says in the linuxmediacenter homepage that i need server version and i dont understand a bit of it :) how do you start the x server?
2007-04-03T15:47:00.000Z	Digitass		http://www.linuxmce.com/ says you need the server version
