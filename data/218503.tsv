2005-09-19T12:18:00.000Z	Jekamean	kemik	I'm looking to do a "remote profile" thing where i can have all users on one comptuer and no matter what comptuer they are on it will pull there files/folder/programs off one comp
2005-09-19T12:18:00.000Z	Jekamean	kemik	so would i just set up the user and use \\compname\users\home as the home directory on each comp?
