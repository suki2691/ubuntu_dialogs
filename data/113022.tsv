2007-11-22T06:32:00.000Z	mrnotproper		Hi, I've a little problem with alsa. I have 2 sound card ( HDA Intel(onboard) and a sound blaster live pci) and the card I want it to be the first output(hw:0,0) isn't. Alsa put my intel on the first ouput so I tried with asoundconf set-default-card Live . Yes, it's o.k. when I open alsamixer.. my sound  blaster is the default card.. but not the output.. it's always my intel.. I tried to restart alsa ... don't works.. and reboot the pc.. not yet... S
