2006-06-06T09:28:00.000Z	harisund		One quick question. Is http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats still the 'bible' (if I might say so) for enabling all media playback and other proprietary software on Dapper?

2006-06-06T09:29:00.000Z	harisund	agamotto	that was what I was afraid of. What is the best 'automated' solution for Dapper? Easy Ubuntu, Automatix, or some other project? I want literally everything, without any hassles :)
2006-06-06T09:29:00.000Z	agamotto	harisund	 Automatix for now
