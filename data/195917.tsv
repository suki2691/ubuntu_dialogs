2006-03-14T17:38:00.000Z	AtaTurk	tucoz	you can type it and search in synaptic , if thats what you mean
2006-03-14T17:39:00.000Z	tucoz	AtaTurk	ok. I'll try that.
2006-03-14T17:41:00.000Z	tucoz	AtaTurk	what I am looking for is for instance a way to search for the programs within a package. Like now, I need to find pcftobdf but I cannot find that by using synaptic or apt-cache search
