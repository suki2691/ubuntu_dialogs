2010-01-09T06:40:00.000Z	iceroot	Laibsch	also 64bit cpu can run 32bit code  but if you have a amd64deb the package itself is alays createt on amd64
2010-01-09T06:41:00.000Z	iceroot	Laibsch	there is no amd64 package which is created with 32bit  but there are amd64 packages which are using pre-compiled 32bit code
