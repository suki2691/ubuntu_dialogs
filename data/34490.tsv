2010-04-30T02:16:00.000Z	BrokenTrace		Ok here is another problem. Trying to upgrade to lucid from karmic and I would get the error " Could Not Calculate the upgrade". I removed a few PPAs then it failed again. Searehed the logs and it says "Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages". Synaptic package manager does not show and borpen packages
2010-04-30T02:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	BrokenTrace	uhmmm  not a good idea to upgrade at the moment, since things may be slow
2010-04-30T02:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	BrokenTrace	since the amount of other people doing it
2010-04-30T02:17:00.000Z	BrokenTrace	sebsebseb	Maybe Ill wait :D
