2007-01-10T07:04:00.000Z	Jarrett		Hi, I have a question about hard drive partitions when installing ubuntu.
2007-01-10T07:05:00.000Z	Jarrett		I'd like to dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu, but I'm wondering if it's possible to resize the existing Windows partition without messing naythingup.

2007-01-10T07:06:00.000Z	SanityInAnarchy	Jarrett	 yes. I don't know if the installer will do this for you (I think it will), but there are ways.
