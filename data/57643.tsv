2009-09-26T03:38:00.000Z	The-Compiler		Hi there, is it possible to do a presentation (e.g. as a PDF or ODP or even as a movie, doesn't matter), so the one who's looking at it can't skip sheets, but HAS to watch the hole presentation to get to the last sheet?
2009-09-26T03:39:00.000Z	The-Compiler		oh
2009-09-26T03:39:00.000Z	The-Compiler		nevermind
2009-09-26T03:41:00.000Z	Eevee	The-Compiler	that seems pretty rude, but someone could just scroll through the frames without reading them anyway
