2008-05-07T03:41:00.000Z	leveeathan	nubbie_	really? I stand corrected.
2008-05-07T03:41:00.000Z	nubbie_		the ubuntu live cd (and all ubuntu derivative livecds) fail to boot due to a fault expanding the squashfs. the iso files are not the culprit, and i have tried many times, it is not my burner. I tested this with a program called unetbootin, which adds a livecd to the hard drive and adds a grub option. when booted from the harddrive the cd boots without fault. can somebody please help me figure this out?
