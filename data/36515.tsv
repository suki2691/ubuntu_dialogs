2010-03-12T04:41:00.000Z	duncanidaho1		What is the best method and tool to capture video via firewire in Linux?  I'd like to edit with cinelerra, but I seem to be unable to capture with it.  I can only capture in kino when I run it with sudo.
2010-03-12T04:41:00.000Z	coz_	duncanidaho1	 I have no idea actually... I have tried to find adequate screen capture in linux with no real luck
2010-03-12T04:46:00.000Z	duncanidaho1	coz_	 you should give gtkrecordmydesktop?  that is a pretty good screen capture program...but I'm looking for capture from the video camera from firewire
2010-03-12T04:47:00.000Z	coz_	duncanidaho1	 ah I see...yeah I use gtk-recordmydesktop but unfortunately I have dual monitors and the only screen capture that works well enough is seom/yukon but I cant get it to compile properly on  ubuntu
