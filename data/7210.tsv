2012-03-02T12:09:00.000Z	sacarlson	Canadian1296	oh then why is  harsh343 here?  he never provided that info or I misted it
2012-03-02T12:12:00.000Z	Canadian1296	sacarlson	Yeah, he thinks he can use apache but he cant, that's why you missed it. He wants a subdomain for his domain, but that has to be done with the host. I don't even know what hosting plan he used cause he hasn't told me (I've asked)
2012-03-02T12:19:00.000Z	sacarlson	Canadian1296	ya that one
