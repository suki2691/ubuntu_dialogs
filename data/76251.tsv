2009-02-14T12:04:00.000Z	lstarnes	loafers	most packages are only updated to fix major bugs and patch security vulnerabilities
2009-02-14T12:04:00.000Z	loafers	lstarnes	ah okay.
2009-02-14T12:10:00.000Z	lstarnes	loafers	there are some like that, such as gentoo and arch, but many distributions don't do that because some updates may cause issues with other installed packages
