2012-03-27T15:20:00.000Z	orflon	Squall5668	isn't there any other way apart from usb? I'm afraid a bit of the procedure and issues of usb-install
2012-03-27T15:29:00.000Z	Squall5668	orflon	until TeamRocket1233c find whatever it is he is looking for, might i suggest you read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation the part about "Installation without a CD"?
