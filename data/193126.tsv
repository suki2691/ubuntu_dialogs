2006-10-03T15:32:00.000Z	ic56	abhinay	because to reach each extended partition, you must read the boot block of the previous extended partition.
2006-10-03T15:33:00.000Z	ic56	abhinay	it should be possible to delete intermediate partitions by copying the boot block of the subsequent partition but perhaps gparted isn't yet capable of that.
