2010-10-19T08:11:00.000Z	icek_		i installed dhcpd server, it works fine on eth1 and my eth0 server has internet access just fine, but when i connect another comptuer to the dhcp server, it cant get internet!!! i turned on ipv4 forwarding :?
2010-10-19T08:12:00.000Z	icek_		so whats the point of a dhcp server if its not to server internet?
2010-10-19T08:12:00.000Z	icek_		*share internet
