2008-06-17T02:03:00.000Z	SymbianDJ	Aw0L	no it doesn't it can be installed onto the vista drive
2008-06-17T02:04:00.000Z	Aw0L	SymbianDJ	vista drive? so...for a manual partition all I need is a root partition and a swap correct?
2008-06-17T02:04:00.000Z	SymbianDJ	Aw0L	i don't know how the vista thing works .  havent tried it myself but if otherwise yes
