2009-08-05T02:08:00.000Z	rdx		Got an POV NVidia Ion with HDMI/Optical output, but the digital out volume is very low compared to other digital devices like my PS3 etc. Any suggestions?
2009-08-05T02:09:00.000Z	ctmjr	rdx	did you try and turn up the pcm volume in alsamixer?
2009-08-05T02:11:00.000Z	rdx	ctmjr	Yup everything is at maximum, but changing the volume has no effect on the digital volume
