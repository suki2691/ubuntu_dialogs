2009-11-03T00:45:00.000Z	rogerio	TheCheeze	thanks a lot for help me yesterday about "no sound in 9.10", today, after new surveys I found the problem, when I upgrade version, grub dont update and I boot with old kernel version, simple sudo update-grub e voila!, my sound is perfect now. This post is only for thanks you and the others users who helped me.
