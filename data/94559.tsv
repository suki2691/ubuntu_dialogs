2008-04-30T21:36:00.000Z	mattperry		need help with new vnc server since upgrade to 8.04...worked perfect on kubuntu 7.10...can't get to work on ubuntu 8.04
2008-04-30T21:36:00.000Z	eth01	mattperry	why have you changed from kubunto to ubuntu?
2008-04-30T21:38:00.000Z	mattperry		my mom had trouble using kubuntu on her machine and I thought ubuntu would be a lot simpler for her, and so I'm trying to use it myself to get used to the difference so that I'll know how to answer any questions she might have etc
