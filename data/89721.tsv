2012-08-17T01:26:00.000Z	|johnny|		I wanted to ask you guys if some glitches with Unity have been fixed. I stopped using Unity a while ago because there were glitches like when I would close an app, the app would just disappear and not minimize correctly.
2012-08-17T01:27:00.000Z	|johnny|		I have used LUbuntu for the past 2 distros that came out but would it be ok to switch back to Unity if I wanted to try it out?
2012-08-17T01:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	|johnny|	 try it and see.. ive not any issues with it.
2012-08-17T01:28:00.000Z	|johnny|	Dr_Willis	ok I guess I'll give it a shot. :) If I have any issues I'll be back.
