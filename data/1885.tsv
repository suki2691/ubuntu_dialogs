2012-10-06T00:36:00.000Z	the_dudez0r		Hi, I'm running ubuntu 12.10 and I get this annoying bug in which the applications I open, are missing the toolbars [File, Edit,..., About], I tried changing to jwm, gnome classic, nothing helps.
2012-10-06T00:38:00.000Z	theadmin	the_dudez0r	In Unity, the menu bars are located on the top panel (very top of the screen, hover there to see them)
2012-10-06T00:38:00.000Z	theadmin	the_dudez0r	If you want to change this behaviour to a traditional one, run: sudo apt-get remove appmenu-{qt,gtk} firefox-globalmenu
