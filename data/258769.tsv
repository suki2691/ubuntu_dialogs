2005-04-21T06:44:00.000Z	Fanglez		thanks, last silly quest..does this latest release support 3com onboard network cards? Last one didn't and I had no idea what to do:)

2005-04-21T06:45:00.000Z	Fanglez	crimsun	it's a 3com chipset on an auss board. Previous ubuntu distro didn't detect it and being a beginner, I had no idea where to go from there and once in ubuntu, I could net out:):)
