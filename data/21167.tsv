2011-01-04T03:03:00.000Z	Sweetums	max_sharpe	you'll have to boot into a rescue environment
2011-01-04T03:04:00.000Z	Sweetums	max_sharpe	Oh that works too if you're using 'sudo'. If you can use sudo and want to set a root PW for some reason, you would do 'sudo su -' to switch to root shell and can then use the standard 'passwd' command. That's not the "Ubuntu way" though :)
