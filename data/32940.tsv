2010-05-01T09:49:00.000Z	MTughan		I'm about to set up Ubuntu 10.04 on my laptop that currently has Fedora 12 on it, and would like some help setting up GRUB...
2010-05-01T09:50:00.000Z	MTughan		I'd like to have Ubuntu's GRUB as the default, as pointed to by the MBR, but handing control off to Fedora's GRUB for booting Fedora, so that Fedora can update its GRUB with a new kernel when needed.

2010-05-01T09:51:00.000Z	MTughan	PythonPup	Thanks, will do.
