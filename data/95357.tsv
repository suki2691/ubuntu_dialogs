2008-04-06T00:27:00.000Z	LOB|LoBo	binarical-app	i can say that I know people have done what you want to do, but I don't know how
2008-04-06T00:27:00.000Z	binarical-app	LOB|LoBo	could you point me to someone?
2008-04-06T00:29:00.000Z	LOB|LoBo	binarical-app	theres a guy in my tf2 clan that I think has done the same thing, you're talking about virtualization right, a 32bit under a 64bit?
