2011-12-26T03:31:00.000Z	arrrghhh	torini	i don't see why it wouldn't, it's just another front end for dpkg/apt
2011-12-26T03:33:00.000Z	arrrghhh	torini	i'm not sure what you mean by "safe".  why do you want to remove FireFox?
2011-12-26T03:34:00.000Z	arrrghhh	torini	you shouldn't need to reinstall it to get the german version.  i'm no expert on that tho, i always use engrish.
