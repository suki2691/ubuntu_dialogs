2005-07-05T07:03:00.000Z	mikeworking	lampshade	That's the only thing my boss would give me. I guess I have to get a USB CDR/DVDR.
2005-07-05T07:04:00.000Z	lampshade	mikeworking	 Did it come with windows on it?  (I suppose they could have some special thing for loading on windows from not a cdrom or floppy...?)
2005-07-05T07:04:00.000Z	mikeworking	lampshade	Yeah, XP. Guess why I'm here today in this forum.
