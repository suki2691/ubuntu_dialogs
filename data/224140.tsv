2005-10-08T05:29:00.000Z	yawgmoth7		i cant compile the sound card drivers though............because it says it needs gcc 3.4, nad i have 4.0.2
2005-10-08T05:29:00.000Z	yawgmoth7		And i tried installing the 3.4 package
2005-10-08T05:29:00.000Z	oxez	yawgmoth7	apt-get install gcc-3.4
2005-10-08T05:29:00.000Z	oxez	yawgmoth7	you can try: export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-3.4 , then compile your thing
