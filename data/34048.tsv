2010-06-07T02:05:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Zelozelos	in terminal killall [app name] or killall -9 [app name]
2010-06-07T02:06:00.000Z	Zelozelos	Pirate_Hunter	yep i knew about kill/killall but what about if im in a game thats full screen and non-responsive (ie it froze up)
2010-06-07T02:07:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Zelozelos	I would use ctrl+alt+f[1-6] to move to a tty than log in and kill it from their, I had to do that before due to system being unresponsive
