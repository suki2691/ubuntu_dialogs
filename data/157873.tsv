2006-11-18T16:01:00.000Z	_feh_	mamzers555	I just did a fresh install of edgy maybe a week ago all was fine until my gf's daughter got on my computer today and I come to fiind out something is wrong, my screen now has a billion squiggly lines all over it and I can not figure out how to fix it. so I was thinking of just reinstalling to see if that fixes the problem?
