2009-01-05T18:55:00.000Z	vasilis		I've got a question. I've changed the system language from system->administration->support on a 8.10 installation but i still get everything in the old language. Even after creating a new user. The locales have changed in /etc/environment but nothing happened.Any help appreciated
