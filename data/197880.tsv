2006-02-25T11:03:00.000Z	mathcaddy		I have a Toshiba 7020CT laptop (366 mhz pentium II) and I just installed ubuntu on it. Everything works GREAT -- except the screen resolution is locked in to 640x480 when it's capable of 1024x768. There are no other resolutions available besides 640x480 in the resolution settings.

2006-02-25T11:05:00.000Z	mathcaddy	FlannelKing	192 mb (which is the max)
2006-02-25T11:05:00.000Z	FlannelKing	mathcaddy	you're lucky, Ive got an older one thats too slow for ubuntu with 40mb ;)
