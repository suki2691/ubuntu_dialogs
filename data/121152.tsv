2007-09-23T09:35:00.000Z	Samuel		hi, i need some help.  i installed ubuntu 7.04 in my comp with the alt cd, but when i try to boot, the splash screen freezes at the third bar, around 13%
2007-09-23T09:36:00.000Z	Samuel		i heard the alt version was more flexible and so i installed it, but it happens with the regular cd also.

2007-09-23T09:37:00.000Z	Samuel	i-hate-wireless	ok ill try thanks
