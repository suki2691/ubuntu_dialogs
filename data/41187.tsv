2009-12-09T18:50:00.000Z	lemmo	epinky	someone in #linux told me yesterday that it is better for me to compile kernel 2.6.32 instead of using 2.6.31-16-generic with karmic. I had some problems on my laptop with graphics and resolution etc
2009-12-09T18:51:00.000Z	epinky	lemmo	then follow that guide
2009-12-09T18:53:00.000Z	lemmo	epinky	I was following this guide until now (http://www.howtoforge.com/kernel_compilation_ubuntu) it says I could apply patches, but I don't know if I need some. does the new kernel have nvidia drivers?
