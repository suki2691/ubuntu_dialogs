2012-02-09T22:27:00.000Z	tiox		I've been askng this question for days looking for a straight answer. I compiled a package with a modified control file, Debian Wheezy's ZSNES 1.51 to function on Ubuntu without having to seek out an obscure update to ia32-libs. When I do install it, it does install, but debconf pops up at the last second (Not sure why there) and unlike other packages, this one doesn't want to provide the option to reinstall in case of install failure.
2012-02-09T22:27:00.000Z	tiox		Can I fix this, and how?
