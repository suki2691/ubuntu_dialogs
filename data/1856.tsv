2012-07-24T06:05:00.000Z	insomniac_lemon	genii-around	I tried generic-text-only, and just about every other driver that I knew was for a thermal printer (like Brother and Zebra which specialize in those)
2012-07-24T06:13:00.000Z	genii-around	insomniac_lemon	The user manual for it at http://www.minuszerodegrees.net/oa/OA%20-%20IBM%20PC%20Compact%20Printer.pdf says "thermal non-impact dot-matix" with 8 print elements in the head... I'm not sure about 8pin but we had old generic 9pin and 24pin that used to work with Epson ppd files
