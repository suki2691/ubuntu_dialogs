2011-07-30T17:18:00.000Z	Flynsarmy		I'm on 10.10 32-bit with 4gigs of RAM. only 3.4 are usable. Are there any issues with 64-bit ubuntu I should know about? like certain programs not having 64-bit versions?
2011-07-30T17:19:00.000Z	compdoc	Flynsarmy	I use the 64bit version, and have never had issues
2011-07-30T17:20:00.000Z	compdoc	Flynsarmy	but maybe that .8 of missing ram is no big deal
2011-07-30T17:20:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	compdoc	i had to add an extra gig because chrome, komodo + virtualbox get me dangerously close to 3GB :)
