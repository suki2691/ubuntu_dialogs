2010-09-06T11:32:00.000Z	sinman		K i had figure out how to get the grub menu showing with a background with just one linux OS install, now I had search over and over, and came up empty handed, How do I change the ubuntu with the 5 dots from the start and shut down screen
2010-09-06T11:33:00.000Z	ikey	sinman	that'd mean changing the plymouth theme.
2010-09-06T11:33:00.000Z	ikey		which I have no clue about :)
2010-09-06T11:33:00.000Z	sinman	ikey	: k, then I'll do a search about plymouth themes then
