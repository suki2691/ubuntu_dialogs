2007-01-14T17:20:00.000Z	Gerald		does someone understand the install cd of Ubuntu Edgy? When I boot from the CD and click 'install or start ubuntu', I do not get the option to install the new Ubuntu, the only thing he wants to do is start the LIVE CD... Ho do I just install Ubuntu on my harddisk (and delete everything else)??
