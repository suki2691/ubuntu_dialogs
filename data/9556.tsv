2011-12-31T09:07:00.000Z	KingSphinx		Is there a way to make ISO images of CDs in Ubuntu? I'm trying to make an ISO copy of an old Windows 98 disc I have so I can run it in VirtualBox (I know I can just use the disc itself, but an ISO is much faster). Unfortunately, I don't think Brasero offers a direct option. Would I have to add all files/directories on the CD to a data project in Brasero or is there a simpler way?

2011-12-31T09:13:00.000Z	KingSphinx	almoxarife	Thank you! All this time, and I only now learned how to use dd... I should be ashamed.
