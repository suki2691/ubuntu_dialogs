2006-06-09T12:56:00.000Z	kallei		I am have been testing ubuntu for some days now and i think its really slow desktop in comparison to windows xp x64, i have amd 3200+ , 1024 ram ... i have tried xfce and gnome and both seem much slower than windows. i would really like to use ubuntu but i want it to be fast, is there any way to get it as fast as win xp?
