2010-07-03T03:28:00.000Z	Pr0jectRec0n		but, I want to add it to my applications start menu - a kind of 'Launcher' - How do I do it ?
2010-07-03T03:29:00.000Z	codebrainz	Pr0jectRec0n	right click on the menu, click Edit Menu, add it through the GUI ... or add a .desktop file to /usr/share/applications
