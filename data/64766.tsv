2010-02-15T10:37:00.000Z	Threetimes		I need a tool to make a DVD with an video as menu background. DVDstyler comes quite close, but it doesn't work for me.
2010-02-15T10:38:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Threetimes	see if devede will do it?  i'm not sure - but i've had the best luck creating video DVD with that program (i've never done menu stuff though)

2010-02-15T10:39:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Threetimes	sorry no other suggestions
