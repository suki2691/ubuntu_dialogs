2007-07-04T07:00:00.000Z	CppIsWeird	mrunagi	apparently you haven't used vista yet.
2007-07-04T07:02:00.000Z	CppIsWeird	mrunagi	trust me, just calm down and take things slow. i made the mistake of expecting linux to do everything that windows did... but you will eventually learn to drop your windows expectations for linux and figure out that linux does things much better.
2007-07-04T07:03:00.000Z	CppIsWeird	mrunagi	linux is built on top of applications, one person makes something, another person makes something on top of that and so on and so forth, it gets rather complicated, but ubuntu has a nice packageing system, not to mention debian packages are awesome.
