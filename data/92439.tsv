2008-05-02T00:37:00.000Z	kivsiak		hi all. I'm updating from 7.10 to 8.04 right now. Is it normal that last message for a 30 minutes is "ldconfig deferred processing now taking place"?
2008-05-02T00:39:00.000Z	Ali_ix	kivsiak	give it some more time, nd also see if it is actually working (and hdd, cpu activity)
2008-05-02T00:42:00.000Z	kivsiak	Ali_ix	ok. the hdd led is still blinking. but 30 minutes without any new line on core duo cpu making me think that somthing  going wrong
2008-05-02T00:43:00.000Z	Ali_ix	kivsiak	it may be normal, if you have many installed packages
