2008-08-10T13:29:00.000Z	ompaul	lemon	is it music?
2008-08-10T13:30:00.000Z	lemon	ompaul	no, it's a windows xp professional cd (may be ubuntu is blocking it to avoid I install it on virtualbox xdxd)
2008-08-10T13:31:00.000Z	ompaul	lemon	no ubuntu should see it - I would point the finger at the disk or the drive
