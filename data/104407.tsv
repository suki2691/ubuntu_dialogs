2010-04-23T09:10:00.000Z	gwen		I have tried to install  Microsoft office 2007 with crossover 4 times and no luck.  Can you help?

2010-04-23T09:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwen	give it a shot? office 2003 is quite pricey
2010-04-23T09:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gwen	openoffice is free why not use that instead
