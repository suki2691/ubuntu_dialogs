2006-05-13T09:11:00.000Z	hajuu		is there like one core package I can uninstall that will completely get rid of gnome?
2006-05-13T09:13:00.000Z	hajuu		why would I ask in #gnome? its an ubuntu issue.. not a gnome issue.
2006-05-13T09:13:00.000Z	konstandinos	hajuu	i just meant the part about wanting to completely get rid of gnome
2006-05-13T09:14:00.000Z	konstandinos	hajuu	appreaciate the humour in asking that in #gnome
