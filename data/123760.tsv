2008-10-30T19:21:00.000Z	madrazr		Hi all, I have a lot of packages installed on Hardy. I am doing a fresh install of Intrepid for some reason. Can I make a list of all the packages installed here through synaptic and use it in Intrepid (assuming the package names have not changed) to reduce the burden of selecting them separately?
2008-10-30T19:21:00.000Z	madrazr		can anyone help me please?
2008-10-30T19:21:00.000Z	cwillu	madrazr	just do an upgrade
2008-10-30T19:22:00.000Z	madrazr	cwillu	as I said I cannot upgrade, I have messed up my system enough, I need a fresh install
