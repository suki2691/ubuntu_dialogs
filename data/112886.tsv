2008-01-06T20:56:00.000Z	iCEifer		hello, I have a partition created that is nothing but free space and I have my linux partitions as well but when I try to install XP off my CD it won't detect the free space partition and shows the entire HD size as an unknown partition and wants to install XP there.  I don't want to lose my linux partitions and just want to install XP on the free space, any ideas? I used qtparted.
