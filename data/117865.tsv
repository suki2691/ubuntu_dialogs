2008-01-17T00:50:00.000Z	khermans	WorkingOnWise	i believe it will check the cache first
2008-01-17T00:52:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	khermans	will it check the cache if I just do <<apt-get install foo>> and foo is in the cache but not in any repositories
2008-01-17T00:52:00.000Z	khermans	WorkingOnWise	i dont believe it will install if it is not in the repos -- but you can dpkg it
