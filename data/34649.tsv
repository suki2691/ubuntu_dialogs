2010-04-03T17:24:00.000Z	thechef	benni123	you mean you have another ubuntu-installation mounted to /mnt/other-ubuntu-root for example? In that case use: sudo chroot /mnt/other-ubuntu-root
2010-04-03T17:24:00.000Z	benni123	thechef	exactly
2010-04-03T17:25:00.000Z	benni123	thechef	I get chroot: cannot run command `/bin/bash': Exec format error
