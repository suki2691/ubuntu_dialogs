2007-01-11T10:09:00.000Z	rmartz		Is there a way to autorun an html file upon CD insertion?
2007-01-11T10:10:00.000Z	rmartz		Seems no one knows anything about autorun
2007-01-11T10:10:00.000Z	ikonia	rmartz	it is possible - look at how the ubuntu live cd does it
2007-01-11T10:12:00.000Z	rmartz	ikonia	I have searched the help files and posted to the forums. No one seems to be able to say.
