2008-08-11T22:23:00.000Z	jellulabo		Hello all - I'm experiencing some problems with X correctly identifying/configuring my screen size. I have configured my screen to 1024x768. However, the login screen (GDM) is huge. Not sure where to start or if this is a bug. I have an nvidia card and I'm running Hardy.

2008-08-11T22:24:00.000Z	jimmygoon	jellulabo	do you have the restricted nvidia driver installed?
2008-08-11T22:24:00.000Z	jimmygoon	jellulabo	also you can try installing and tinkering with nvidia-settings
