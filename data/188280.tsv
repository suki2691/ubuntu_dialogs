2006-06-30T16:03:00.000Z	xst		Normally I write "dpkg-reconfigure locales" in order to redefine the list of installed locales. But now it just re-calculates the locales giving me no selection list. How do I modify the list of installed locales then?

2006-06-30T16:06:00.000Z	bbrazil	xst	odd, checked for bugs on launchpad?
