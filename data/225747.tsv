2009-08-01T02:56:00.000Z	candrodor		This has happened a few times now.  I close firefox.  The process is no longer listed in the process list. Start it up again.  I get the "Starting Firefox" thing on the taskbar, but then it vanishes.  Launch it again, same thing happens.  I collect a load of sleeping firefox processes in the list, but no window.
2009-08-01T02:56:00.000Z	candrodor		Any ideas?
2009-08-01T02:56:00.000Z	WindowsUser	candrodor	process list as in ps -ef |grep firefox?
2009-08-01T02:57:00.000Z	candrodor	WindowsUser	System -> Admin -> system monitor is what I've used, but I guess it might bet the same thing maybe?
