2006-03-31T17:49:00.000Z	mlaci		hey guys! i'm thinking on changing to ubuntu from debian. the only thing i'm worried about is constant upgrading. i'm currently using debian unstable and new packages get updated every day. is there anything equivalent regarding ubuntu?

2006-03-31T17:50:00.000Z	Jocko9		which is under development
2006-03-31T17:52:00.000Z	mlaci	Jocko9	so dapper drake is the equivalent of debian unstable?
