2006-07-30T06:48:00.000Z	Akein		my hard drive [which was NTFS until about 30 minutes ago] , is now ext3, according to all fdisk and Disk Manager etc, but still reads as NTFS, and my attemps to make myself the owner of said disk have resulted only in endless lists of Windows files that are being "owned" read-only, but none are viewable or editable, and it still shows as being owned by root :(
2006-07-30T06:50:00.000Z	Akein		no, we are all guys
2006-07-30T06:51:00.000Z	wheels3572	Akein	was that no to me?
