2006-04-13T09:10:00.000Z	PhoenixP3K	Mu	'cause they think it's better and never consider legacy versions
2006-04-13T09:11:00.000Z	PhoenixP3K	Mu	yup that's a real bummer. I read somewhere that the next Flash version for linux would skip directly to Flash 9
2006-04-13T09:12:00.000Z	PhoenixP3K	Mu	time frame is not an issue when it comes to linux consumers, since they're not considered as such
