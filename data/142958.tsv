2007-07-16T11:53:00.000Z	alecw1		I'm having a weird problem... if I "copy" text from a program, and then close it, I can't paste it anywhere. Is anyone else having this problem?
2007-07-16T11:54:00.000Z	alecw1		is there a fix?
2007-07-16T11:55:00.000Z	alecw1		And will this "bug" be fixed in the next ubuntu release?
2007-07-16T11:55:00.000Z	preaction_	alecw1	it's not necessarily a bug
