2008-11-27T23:26:00.000Z	Sierradump		Can anyone tell me what application Chuck is using at 33 seconds in on this video:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE0_Vc3BfXs&feature=channel   --- The application in question is the one that shows the CPU usage, ram/cache/etc.. memory usage, network usage etc... --->  It is all seamlessly integrated into the desktop background.  They aren't widgets (can't click/drag them around)...
2008-11-27T23:27:00.000Z	Sierradump		Chuck put out a live DVD of some software he had been working on and I really liked that utility! but I couldn't find it anywhere...
2008-11-27T23:27:00.000Z	Sierradump		Not sure if it matters but he is using Debian?
