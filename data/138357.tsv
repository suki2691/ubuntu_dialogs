2007-07-19T07:13:00.000Z	nir_ai		hi, is it possible that my user-name does not appear in /etc/passwd ?
2007-07-19T07:14:00.000Z	jrib	nir_ai	possible, but doesn't sound good/normal
2007-07-19T07:16:00.000Z	nir_ai	jrib	how do I determine a user's shell if their name does not appear in /etc/passwd ?
2007-07-19T07:25:00.000Z	jrib	nir_ai	their name *should* appear in /etc/passwd afaik
