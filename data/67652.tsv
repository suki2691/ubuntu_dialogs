2010-07-23T05:23:00.000Z	ChrisBuchholz		Hey, i have been researching the topic of installing ubuntu on my macbook pro, and now i have come to point where i need to boot ubuntu. I have tried to do it with a 9.04 cd, but i want to directly install lucid so i need to do it from a sdcard or external harddrive since i have no empty dvds laying around. I have tried a lot of things, but nothing that worked, so how would i go about doing this? I have to create boot disk fr
