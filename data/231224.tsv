2006-12-05T10:33:00.000Z	matiseijas		hello, can somebody help me? I'm trying to upgrade from 5.10 and everytime I run the command 'gksu "update-manager -c" ' and I enter my password it tells me I've typed a wrong password. I've retried this method a billion times and I still get the same error. What can I do to fix it??
