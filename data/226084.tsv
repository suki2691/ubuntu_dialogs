2005-12-12T07:14:00.000Z	Ng	maestro	synaptic can show you a full list of available packages, that's probably the quickest way, if you have X installed
2005-12-12T07:20:00.000Z	maestro	Ng	in ubuntuguide.org, show how to install java sun pack, using APT, but this doen't work, have any another way?
2005-12-12T07:20:00.000Z	Ng	maestro	firstly, close ubuntuguide and never go back, then look at the restrictedformats ubuntu wiki page, I believe that should tell you how to install sun's java :)
