Unable to install root fs on unkown block (1,0)" (or so). i put the desktop cd into my other computer (this one) and booted into it. it worked fine. i was wondering, would it work if i was to connect my laptop hdd to this computer, and install ubuntu to that laptop hdd, and try to boot it like that?
