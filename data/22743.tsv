2010-11-26T01:50:00.000Z	guntbert	jymere	he meant: ask in ##networking (maybe)
2010-11-26T01:55:00.000Z	jymere	guntbert	you think i should ask in the forum but it's just to explain me how to proceed. I have the public and private key and the name of the account. I should be able to connect on his account with these informations only no ?
