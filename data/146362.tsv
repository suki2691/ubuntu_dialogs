2008-11-14T20:54:00.000Z	freeatlast		Hi - I setup this Ubuntu install for a friend using my Acer LCD Flat Panel - I'm taking to him today - But he has a older style CRT Monitor - I have the option under Screen Resolution of 59Hz - 58Hz - 57Hz - It is currently 59Hz - Would the lower setting Hertz be better to use ? ?-
