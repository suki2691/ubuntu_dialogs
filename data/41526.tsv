2009-12-01T03:18:00.000Z	flagpolesitta		I accidentally opened a mp4 file with real player and now I have to right click it and choose movieplayer if I want to open it that way (it automatically opened it that way before). If I try to open an mp4 from the Firefox Downloads list, it just tries to open it in realplayer as well. I selected movieplayer as the default in Preferred Applications. Realplayer doesnt seem to work for watching mp4s in any case. Can anyone help?
