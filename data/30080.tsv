2012-07-15T18:32:00.000Z	Kruptein	derrick_	there are a lot of web resources not an actual program I think
2012-07-15T18:35:00.000Z	Kruptein	derrick_	that's also not related to cli at all
2012-07-15T18:36:00.000Z	Kruptein	derrick_	so do you want to learn a programming language or just to learn how to use the cli?
