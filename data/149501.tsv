2008-10-06T21:44:00.000Z	King_Kickass		if I upgrade to 8.10 beta now, will I have no problem to autoupdate to the final version later?
2008-10-06T21:46:00.000Z	King_Kickass		or can I access the new 8.10 repositories without installing the beta?
2008-10-06T21:47:00.000Z	King_Kickass		ok i hope it does not format my hd
2008-10-06T21:48:00.000Z	Pici	King_Kickass	But it may not work properly.  It is still beta after all.
