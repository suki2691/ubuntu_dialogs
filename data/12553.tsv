2011-08-23T01:33:00.000Z	alpha		I'm trying to install (from source) a program that tells me I need "gtk+-2.0", but what do I need to install (using synaptics) in order to have gtk+?
2011-08-23T01:34:00.000Z	alpha		will libgtk-3.0 be enough or do I also need the -dev version?
2011-08-23T01:35:00.000Z	zykotick9	alpha	you need the -dev versions to compile against - but not sure about the 2 vs 3 issue.
2011-08-23T01:36:00.000Z	zykotick9	alpha	the above checkinstall can make "cleaning up" a LOT easier BTW
