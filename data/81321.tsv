2011-12-20T00:53:00.000Z	anli__		When I try to install php5-sqlite, I get the error message "php5-sqlite: Depends: php5-common (=5.3.5-1ubuntu7) but 5.3.5-1ubuntu7.2 is to be installed"
2011-12-20T00:54:00.000Z	anli__		There seems to be no way out of getting that error message
2011-12-20T00:54:00.000Z	anli__		So what should I try?
2011-12-20T00:55:00.000Z	Ampelbein	anli__	What release? And what does 'apt-cache policy php5-sqlite' say?
