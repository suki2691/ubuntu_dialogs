2010-05-03T05:28:00.000Z	netskillsii		hello i am trying to download videos from myspace profile, can anyone provide me with some tools? or command line tools like wget or httrack?
2010-05-03T05:28:00.000Z	Surlent777	netskillsii	search synaptic. There's several tools for this purpose.
2010-05-03T05:30:00.000Z	netskillsii	Surlent777	- thank you, have you try any? if so, which and what was your experience and your best?  I will check synaptic.
2010-05-03T05:31:00.000Z	Surlent777	netskillsii	I tend to use the old "check /tmp for the downloaded video" trick. If you're using Firefox, it might be somewhere in your ~/.mozilla/cache or something like that too.
