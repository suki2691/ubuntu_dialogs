2007-08-30T09:47:00.000Z	Broc223		is there a known problem in XORG with rendering ? seems like every browser turns to a crawl on some pages and pegs the cpu at 100%
2007-08-30T09:47:00.000Z	bruenig	Broc223	you mean the browsers do it all on the same pages
2007-08-30T09:47:00.000Z	bruenig	Broc223	sounds like a problem with the pages then does it not?
2007-08-30T09:48:00.000Z	Broc223	bruenig	no it sounds like a problem with xorg not being able to render them ;-)
