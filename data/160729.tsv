2010-11-04T09:13:00.000Z	gqz		Anyone have any advice for me?
2010-11-04T09:14:00.000Z	gqz		I'm planning to update from 10.04 to 10.10 and have a seperate /home partition.  Last time I did this I had to reinstall many of my programs (I'm assuming they were installed in /usr).  Anyway I can avoid this during this update?  Or should I just move /usr to a seperate partition, or just count it as a loss and reinstall?
