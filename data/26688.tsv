2010-09-01T21:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		I would like to see4 some more 'work and polish' done in the area of having more then one XYZ-desktop installed on a system at a time.. It can get.. awkward and quirky at times if you have kubuntu and ubuntu and xubuntu  all on a box at the same time.

2010-09-01T21:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest89597	 or just run a window manager, not a full desktop
