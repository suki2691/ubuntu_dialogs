2011-11-22T21:45:00.000Z	kamilnadeem		I am having a issue with the sound in my newly installed Ubuntu 11.10 , my 4.1 speaker system is not being recognised and only front speakers are working. Also when playing a file , the sound is breaking as the system In continuously switching between  Headphone and speakers . ?
