2007-03-23T05:20:00.000Z	JuJuBee		I wish to create  a folder called /home/DropBox and allow students to drop files into it, but not cd into, delete from, ls either.  I have a group called users and all my students are a member of users.  What perms do I put on the folder so they can drop files into it?
