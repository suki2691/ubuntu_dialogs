2007-06-29T10:54:00.000Z	ptr1234		I'd like to be able to do things like reinstall grub after a windows install, but I don't want to use the ubuntu live cd. What could I do?
2007-06-29T10:55:00.000Z	chadeldridge	ptr1234	 you could use the gparted live cd if you have some hatred of the ubuntu live cd ... otherwise any partition utility that can set a part active will work
