2006-04-25T05:48:00.000Z	Warbo	facugaich	There is usually a few packages updated per week at least (less activity now Dapper is so close) and Dapper has huge updates of everything every few days
2006-08-05T11:41:00.000Z	Warbo	facugaich	Because that would screw up the package management, and also would need to be done by every user, or else give Firefox root priviledges (yeah, give root to a web browser, what a good idea)
