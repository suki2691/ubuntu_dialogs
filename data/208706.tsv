2010-09-01T04:10:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	yoshie	in the system/admin menu , there is a Logon applet
2010-09-01T04:11:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	yoshie	you must have the administrator privilegie (able to sudo) and there is an option just for that
2010-09-01T04:11:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	yoshie	no problem... it happens to me all the time as well
