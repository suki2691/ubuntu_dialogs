2012-09-01T22:42:00.000Z	cecko		hi all, I am on Quantal, my system does not shut down properly, it gets stuck in the process, can you help me what logs to look into?
2012-09-01T22:43:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	cecko	try #ubuntu+1 for help with that
2012-09-01T22:43:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	cecko	we don't support the alpha/beta/dev stream in here, that's what +1 exists for :)
2012-09-01T22:43:00.000Z	cecko	WarOfTheNerd	thanks
