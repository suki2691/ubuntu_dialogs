2009-06-22T08:04:00.000Z	lwizardl	buttons840	sounds like you need an Asterisk PBX
2009-06-22T08:05:00.000Z	buttons840	lwizardl	actually, i'm looking for a softphone to test asterisk with, i have only 1 test computer and i need to generate and maintaind as many outbound calls as possible to the test system to test the load
2009-06-22T08:06:00.000Z	lwizardl	buttons840	oh ok not sure on that then. I just know you can basically have unlimited phones in the pbx as long as you have the hardware and proper voip service accounts
