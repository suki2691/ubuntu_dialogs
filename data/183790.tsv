2006-09-05T14:02:00.000Z	hilde		I need some help I killed my Xserver and don't know how to get it back running. I installed XGL on two monitors with two diffrent resolutions. That worked for one day but an update made it crash. So I wanted to unistall it. However know X doesn't start at al. Not even GDM
