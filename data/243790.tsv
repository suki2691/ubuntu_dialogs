2005-05-08T09:49:00.000Z	fateisajester		i have a weird prob.... for some reason the ati drivers for my radeon 7000 dont work, so i have to use generic radeon drivers...ok... but what is weird is in gnome i have a higher fps than in kde.. anyone know why?
2005-05-08T09:49:00.000Z	elcu	fateisajester	how much higher?
2005-05-08T09:52:00.000Z	elcu	fateisajester	yeah :) dunno.  maybe kde uses more resources?
2005-05-08T09:54:00.000Z	elcu	fateisajester	i personally just followed the binary howto (on a 9600pro).  i haven't benchmarked gnome vs kde though.
