2006-06-25T06:45:00.000Z	MistaED		because on this old 128mb ram laptop, xubuntu runs alright but having gnome-panel and nautilus greatly improves usability
2006-06-25T06:45:00.000Z	MistaED		so i just installed gnome over the top and now it's slow :(
2006-06-25T06:45:00.000Z	grimboy	MistaED	Yeah, bad idea.
