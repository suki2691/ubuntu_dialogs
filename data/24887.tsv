2010-10-05T22:20:00.000Z	AndyPP	xangua	no, I think it doesn't, because there are a lot of threads around about this bug... but I don't know why. Anyway, I think my problem is about fonts, the font "styles", so I don't know who to ask. I'll try the firefox chan, thanx

2010-10-05T22:21:00.000Z	AndyPP	xangua	I installed everything from the standard repos
