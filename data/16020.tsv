2011-04-29T03:18:00.000Z	TerryBook		Natty upgrade complete.  so....how do I configure this sidebar thing?
2011-04-29T03:19:00.000Z	stefg	TerryBook	you don't :-) options are considered to be too confusing
2011-04-29T03:26:00.000Z	TerryBook	stefg	 options are a requirement for me to use something.  lack of options = stress, annoyance, irritation, and frustration :P
2011-04-29T03:28:00.000Z	stefg	TerryBook	there is ccsm which is a somwhat hackish way to do some configuartion... but the general idea is: take ir or leave it (and facing the possibilty that more users don't take, but leave)
