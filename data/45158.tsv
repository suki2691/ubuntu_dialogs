2010-08-25T02:54:00.000Z	fireflylight	thune3	i installed all that, yet the compile still complains its missing
2010-08-25T02:55:00.000Z	thune3	fireflylight	for compile i assume you need librecode-dev
2010-08-25T02:58:00.000Z	fireflylight	thune3	yep install and that seemed to work, thanx for that :)
