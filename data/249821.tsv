2007-02-23T10:57:00.000Z	joebob777as7		I'm a newb to linux and I'm using suse and I really like it but I hear such great things about ubuntu so i installed feisty and it looks sweet and i got it up and running and my video drivers installed but it just seems that apt and synaptic pale in comparison to smart and yast... is it just me? do i need to play around with it more? what are your thoughts?
2007-02-23T10:59:00.000Z	joebob777as7		wow i didn't know we needed to use proper grammer here... my fiance is nagging me to come cuddle with her, so i'm typing from the hip as fast as possible
2007-02-23T11:00:00.000Z	joebob777as7		wow thanks for nothing... seems like the suse guys are nicer anyway.
