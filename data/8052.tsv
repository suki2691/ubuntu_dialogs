2012-01-24T06:22:00.000Z	EvilResistance	max_noob	 did you try the command 'halt' via command line?
2012-01-24T06:22:00.000Z	EvilResistance	max_noob	 try using the 'halt' command or 'shutdown -h now'
2012-01-24T06:23:00.000Z	EvilResistance	max_noob	 either of those will require sudo if i remember right...
