2008-02-09T18:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	emitchlpd	well, compile the program from source, and move on... synaptic shouldn't care.
2008-02-09T18:36:00.000Z	emitchlpd	IndyGunFreak	what happens when something else depends on said package -- is apt going to clobber my compiled version?
2008-02-09T18:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	emitchlpd	that i don't know.. what are you wanting to compile?
