2005-03-15T13:40:00.000Z	johnwl	thewolf	that happened to me (usb wireless keyboard) and i just plugged in an old ps2 keyboard to hit ENTER and then unplugged it and the wireless one worked the rest of the install
2005-03-15T13:40:00.000Z	thewolf		I'm not sure if the install cd freezes, should the cursor blink?
2005-03-15T13:40:00.000Z	thewolf	johnwl	I'll try that. I have had similar problems with USB keyboards and linux
