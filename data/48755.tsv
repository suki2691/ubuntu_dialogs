2010-02-11T01:11:00.000Z	tasslehoff		I'm running 32-bit Karmic on my MacBook Pro 5.1 which has 4GB ram. "free -m" shows a total of only 2748. Is this something I should handle by installing a kernel with PAE?
2010-02-11T01:11:00.000Z	tasslehoff		I don't want to reinstall 64-bit if I don't have to.

2010-02-11T01:12:00.000Z	tasslehoff	arand	ActionParsnip: thanks. I'll go with PAE for now, and download the 64 bit version of 10.04
