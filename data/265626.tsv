2006-05-29T09:11:00.000Z	mikedep333		hey guys, I'm a linux user with a decent amount of experience that wants to use ubuntu with KDE primarily and gnome as a backup. Would you suggest I use dapper drake ubuntu and then install the KDE packages, or use dapper kubuntu?
2006-05-29T09:11:00.000Z	mikedep333		I saw an article suggesting the former a while ago
2006-05-29T09:12:00.000Z	spikeb	mikedep333	doesn't really matter
2006-05-29T09:12:00.000Z	spikeb	mikedep333	since you're going to be wanting both desktops
