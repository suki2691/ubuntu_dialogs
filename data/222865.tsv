2010-04-18T06:20:00.000Z	Dantonic		I'm sorry a newbie question.  Are there any differences with upgrading your ubuntu version through the update manager instead of a whole new installation from cd?  Any advantages to doing a fresh install?
2010-04-18T06:20:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Dantonic	usually a fresh install is the best way to do things, personally I have never seen ubuntu updates cleanly

2010-04-18T06:22:00.000Z	hatake_kakashi	Dantonic	yes generally
