2009-05-13T18:54:00.000Z	g33k_g1rl		have there been many questions about making Win7 RC1 and Ubuntu play nicely together?
2009-05-13T18:56:00.000Z	g33k_g1rl		I am running an ubuntu server, with a windows share -- on the office WinXP machines, the winShare works just fine, but on the new Win7 machine, I don't seem to have write or execute permissions
2009-05-13T18:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	g33k_g1rl	ask in #ubuntu-server or #samba channels... better help for that kind of issues ...
2009-05-13T18:57:00.000Z	g33k_g1rl	erUSUL	thanks, will do
