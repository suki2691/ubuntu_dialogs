2007-07-13T11:57:00.000Z	Genomsaren	erizzle	I know that windows viruses are not affecting linux but, there are linux viruses too... And it can be very simple. For example a keylogger application would be very simple and if I dont have an AV they can easily infect my machine...
2007-07-13T11:58:00.000Z	erizzle	Genomsaren	the problem is for the virus to install a keylogger it has to have root privelages so unless you have a very crappy root password you really don't have to worry, user accounts don't have full admin rights in linux like they can in windows, that's why you have to use sudo to do certain things so you can temporarily attain root rights
2007-07-13T12:00:00.000Z	Genomsaren	erizzle	Do I need a root privelage for running a simple binary file? or for a process which wants to attempt internet?
