2009-03-07T12:34:00.000Z	Cige		Ok, so I currently have my Vista desktop hooked up to my Ubuntu laptop via a direct lan, and I am trying to get some files off of the desktop.  The problem is that when I look for shared folders from ubuntu, it does not see any.  I even disabled the firewall on vista.  (it isn't connected to the internet so it doesn't really matter)

2009-03-07T12:36:00.000Z	Crshman	Cige	if it's urgent winscp them to your linux box
2009-03-07T12:48:00.000Z	Crshman	Cige	just use winscp to transfer from windows to linux
