2009-08-05T10:56:00.000Z	shelah		Hi everyone.  I have a printer that OpenPrinting.org lists as a "paperweight", and another that's not listed on there at all.  Does this mean that there's no way for me to get these printers to work with Ubuntu?
2009-08-05T10:58:00.000Z	shelah		Both printers work fine on Windows, but the manufacturers don't support Linux, and I can't find Linux drivers... is there any way I can get these to work?  maybe through wine (or something else) using the Windows drivers?
