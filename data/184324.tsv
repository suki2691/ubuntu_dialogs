2008-12-12T22:40:00.000Z	shadowblade		Hello, I'm trying to get the appropriate permissions to make my USB flash drive writable by me (not root) - when the drive is unmounted, the folder I mount it to has full read/write permissions and is owned by me, but once I mount it it switches so its owned by root, only root can write to it and users can read it. The flash drive is vfat so its not an FS problem. Just opening up a sudo'ed nautilus window isn't an optio
