2010-05-10T02:19:00.000Z	leftiness		I'm new to VirtualBox... I've got a vm created, base memory 384 mb, ubuntu studio .iso mounted as the CD. I boot the vm and try to install, but it goes black except for an underscore in the top left corner. Conky shows my processor is maxed; is it just having trouble running, or did I do something wrong?

2010-05-10T02:21:00.000Z	leftiness	mknarr1	Will do.
2010-05-10T02:23:00.000Z	leftiness	mknarr1	Up to 450 mb, and still no effect; the installer says it only needs 32 mb ram...
