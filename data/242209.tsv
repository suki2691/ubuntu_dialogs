2005-04-15T06:06:00.000Z	LarsG		any suggestions on why I haven't got any sound on flash anims?
2005-04-15T06:08:00.000Z	whiskers	LarsG	well i had gnuflash working on gentoo but i don't bother with that stuff anymore
2005-04-15T06:08:00.000Z	whiskers	LarsG	i don't use the web very much except google and slashdot and they don't require gnuflash
2005-04-15T06:09:00.000Z	LarsG	whiskers	thanks.. but there are also some videos without sound, and a dev. language I use.. (BlitzMax)
