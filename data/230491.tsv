2005-12-26T07:23:00.000Z	toresbe		Hmm, I have a somewhat odd question
2005-12-26T07:23:00.000Z	toresbe		I'm a beginning developer, and I've noticed that Dapper has gstreamer 0.10, which i need for a project of mine
2005-12-26T07:23:00.000Z	toresbe		can I install the Dapper gstreamer packages on Breezy?
