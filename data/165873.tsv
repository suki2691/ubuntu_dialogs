2007-04-29T07:18:00.000Z	digilink		I'm running 7.04 and Firefox and I'm having a problem with flash audio not playing on the correct soundcard. I run two soundcards in my box and sound from flash videos is not playing on the correct card. Is there a way I change it or specify which card the sounds should play on?
