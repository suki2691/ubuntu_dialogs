2006-10-15T11:41:00.000Z	YOKcom		I just installed my drivers for ATI and pretty sure it did it correctly. Problem is laggy/choppiness when many graphics on screen (i.e. logging out screen dimming (very slow), www.gamespot.com (scrolling up and down is very laggy) any ideas?
2006-10-15T11:41:00.000Z	anon32	YOKcom	switch to software rendering?
2006-10-15T11:42:00.000Z	YOKcom	anon32	cool how do I do that?
2006-10-15T11:45:00.000Z	anon32	YOKcom	maybe?
