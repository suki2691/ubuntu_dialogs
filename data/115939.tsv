2009-09-28T03:21:00.000Z	gNewPower		Hi everybody!  I need help with downloading this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgBdwD5IV90.  I tried youtube-dl from the CLI and I tried the downloadhelper extension in FF.  Neither could fetch this video.  Ditto for online YouTube downloaders.  Any pointers?  Thanks!
