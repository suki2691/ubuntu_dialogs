2011-04-07T09:33:00.000Z	aauthor	geekahedron1	the command to start it up is ccsm, but that gives the gui.  That not what you want, right?
2011-04-07T09:34:00.000Z	aauthor	geekahedron1	alright, make sure you install it through the synaptic first.
2011-04-07T09:34:00.000Z	aauthor	geekahedron1	quite the conundrum. :)
