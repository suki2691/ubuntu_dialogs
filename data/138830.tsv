2007-04-19T16:49:00.000Z	spork		I'm trying to get compiz running in eft via the ubuntu faq/guide.  I'm on the step where you update the gpg key for the apt repository, but the key server keeps timing out.

2007-04-19T16:52:00.000Z	spork	Madpilot	no it's: hkp://wwwkeys.eu.pgp.net   is there a different keyserver I can use for the compiz stuff?
2007-04-19T16:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	spork	not sure, haven't yet messed with compiz/beryl myself.
