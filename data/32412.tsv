2010-05-11T16:39:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	molfar	began to crash ... how did it crash? Did it go funky? Did you do something special? Did you edit the config file?
2010-05-11T16:40:00.000Z	molfar	s3r3n1t7	it just close up with "no words". trying to run it again - 1-2 sec it it closed again. 3-5 times this procedure - it works
2010-05-11T16:42:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	molfar	are you running this via command line, or via some script? Can you pastebin?
