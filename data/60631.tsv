2009-04-20T00:14:00.000Z	ActiveFrost		any way to fix gedit errors when running as a root ( after su ) ?
2009-04-20T00:16:00.000Z	Slart	ActiveFrost	there is gksudo for gui stuff.. not sure how su works compared to sudo though.. what error messages do you get?
2009-04-20T00:33:00.000Z	ActiveFrost	Slart	1 error x 20 .. well, someone said that dbus is not running, but hell no - I even don't know how to turn it on !
2009-04-20T00:37:00.000Z	Slart	ActiveFrost	hmm.. "sudo /etc/init.d/dbus start" might work
