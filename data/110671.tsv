2007-12-06T09:33:00.000Z	sproingie	Chico2	aptitude has a gui interface, apt-get is just commandline.  aptitude is smarter about dependencies too
2007-12-06T09:34:00.000Z	Chico2	sproingie	ah alright thanks
2007-12-06T09:34:00.000Z	sproingie	Chico2	however, apt-get has super-cow powers, aptitude does not
