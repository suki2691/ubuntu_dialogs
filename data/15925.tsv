2011-04-28T07:45:00.000Z	Mac102250		Anyone? C'mon, I need some help here.
2011-04-28T07:46:00.000Z	BrumDart	Mac102250	how did you delete the user?
2011-04-28T07:46:00.000Z	Mac102250		When I turn on the computer, it tries to log directly onto the deleted user
2011-04-28T07:47:00.000Z	Mac102250	BrumDart	I clicked the admin tab and went down to the very bottom and clicked "User Groups" or something like that
