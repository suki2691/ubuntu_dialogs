2011-09-22T19:20:00.000Z	LaWU		What is the best programming application to use on Ubuntu, for someone who wants to learn programming?
2011-09-22T19:21:00.000Z	jpmh	LaWU	 perl
2011-09-22T19:23:00.000Z	LaWU	ikonia	rumpel & jpmh: Thanks for the answers. Well like I stated, I'm looking for something to learn programming on, so ofcourse, it should be easy to use, and it should have some form support/ guids online for new programmers. As for the language, I got no clue - suggestions?
2011-09-22T19:38:00.000Z	jpmh	LaWU	one of the reasons I suggest perl is that there are so many beginners guides - things like lern perl in 30 days etc
