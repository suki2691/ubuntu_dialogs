It is possible that your Internet Provider won't allow another MAC address unless you inform them of the change. I have seen this happen. In fact, I had to tell the IP that I have so many MAC addresses and had to inform them of it. I am not sure if that is the case with you.
2009-07-06T10:27:00.000Z	Curly_Q		SmokeyCastle, have you unplugged your router before changing the MAC Address? In other words, Rebooting the computer and first shutting down and litteraly unplugging the router voltage cable?
2009-07-06T10:28:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Even if you are behind a firewall or router, the MAC address is broadcasted.
2009-07-06T10:29:00.000Z	SmoKeyCastle	Curly_Q	I cannot even connect to the router with the new mac address. I have connected to the router previously using windows with the new mac address and that worked fine.
