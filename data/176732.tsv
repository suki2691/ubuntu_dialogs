2006-06-26T09:23:00.000Z	gatekeeper	Minty__	have you got Adept or synaptic running while trying to do something with the CLI?
2006-06-26T09:27:00.000Z	gatekeeper	Minty__	say another process using it, so what ever you are trying to, another process is already in existance and needs killing, what are you trying to do?
2006-06-26T09:32:00.000Z	gatekeeper	Minty__	try loging out then loging back in that might clear it
