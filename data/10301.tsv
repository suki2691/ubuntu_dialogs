2011-12-21T15:48:00.000Z	vlt		Hello. What is the most elegant way to run a daemonized headless OpenOffice.org instance on every boot?
2011-12-21T15:50:00.000Z	ServerSage	vlt	I thought I saw a service init.d script somewhere.  Have you googled it?
2011-12-21T15:52:00.000Z	vlt	ServerSage	Haven't yet. Is there a pkg I can install that ships this init.d script?
2011-12-21T15:54:00.000Z	ServerSage	vlt	Not that I know of, though I honestly haven't done headless OO in over a year.
