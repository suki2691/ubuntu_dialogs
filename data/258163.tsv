2006-04-04T06:43:00.000Z	UncleD		I did apt-get install ruby and it installed properly, except it doesn't seem to be in my path properly. -bash: /usr/bin/ruby: No such file or directory <-- any suggestions on how to make it so apt-get installs into the proper path?
2006-04-04T06:45:00.000Z	UncleD		apt-get clean isn't working. any ideas?
2006-04-04T06:46:00.000Z	UncleD		all my packages are still there.
