2007-04-18T13:22:00.000Z	workinprocess		I'm sorry. I figured I'd get someones attention first. Well.. I need help installing a belkin wireless g usb adapter in ubuntu. I am dual booting windows XP sp2(66.6Gb partition) and Ubuntu(10Gb partition). I have no internet when I go to ubuntu because I can't figure out how to install the belking adapter. the cd oviously doesnt work as it was meant for a windows installation.
2007-04-18T13:22:00.000Z	workinprocess		and seeing as I am dual booting I need some step by step instructions of what to do because I would have to reboot to get back to ubuntu.
2007-04-18T13:23:00.000Z	workinprocess		So.. Can anyone help me?
