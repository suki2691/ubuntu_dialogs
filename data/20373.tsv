2011-01-29T21:06:00.000Z	TopCat	madsailor	yes i did create that dir
2011-01-29T21:07:00.000Z	TopCat	madsailor	but when i use /media/backup as the mountpoint in fstab the dir "disappears"
2011-01-29T21:09:00.000Z	TopCat	madsailor	looks like the dir wasn't created...although, i KNOW i created it before
