2005-12-12T13:58:00.000Z	linux_n00b_e		I mean to really compete with the big comanies out there, the people that design software for Linux need money
2005-12-12T14:00:00.000Z	linux_n00b_e		I came to Linux from the World of Apple. Not because apple sucks, but because I can't afford a Powerbook right now and I needed a viable OS solution for my Thinkpad
