2007-08-10T05:40:00.000Z	Jamesinator	kitche	I think you're mistaken, I have /var/www chown'ed to my normal user on this system and it works perfectly
2007-08-10T05:42:00.000Z	kitche	Jamesinator	ok if you want to break security go right ahead but please do not tell people to chown that directory instead have them add themselves to www-data so they can write to the directory
