2012-01-13T10:15:00.000Z	sters		Hi all, I'm looking for Ubuntu software that lets me setup rules to trigger when eg: 10 errors are recorded in 10 mins.  Is there anything like that?  I haven't had much luck finding it.
2012-01-13T10:15:00.000Z	sters		EG:  Some kind of metrics monitoring open source software
