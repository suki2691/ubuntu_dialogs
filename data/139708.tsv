2007-10-18T14:14:00.000Z	jscinoz		Hey guys, im trying to generate a repository using falcon 2.0, however on running "falcon scan" or "falcon clean" the program crashes with the following output: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41040/
2007-10-18T14:14:00.000Z	Seveas	jscinoz	falcon is not included in ubuntu and #ubuntu does not support it
2007-10-21T10:15:00.000Z	jscinoz	Seveas	the falcon deb in your feisty repo is broken :(
