2007-10-29T07:49:00.000Z	min2		Hello, I need help with a network problem.  I am running ubuntu 7.10 with a built-in nvidia gigabit network controller and I am only getting 8 MB/S transfer to a fileserver running linux samba.  I get 40+ MB/S with windows dual booted on the same machine.  Please Help!
