2011-08-25T17:12:00.000Z	jrib	fppp	do you have an ubuntu support question?
2011-08-25T17:14:00.000Z	jrib	fppp	please ask a support question
2011-08-25T17:18:00.000Z	jrib	fppp	file a bug, but complaining in a support channel instead of asking for support with a specific issue is just a waste of your time and ours
