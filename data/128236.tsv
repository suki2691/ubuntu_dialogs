2007-07-27T05:05:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	benzs_s	I wuld say Audacity.
2007-07-27T05:05:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	benzs_s	While it might not produce the best quality of sound, it's probably the quickest and least painful of ways.
2007-07-27T05:05:00.000Z	ThanatosDrive	benzs_s	Really? Just play the video and record the sound.
