2008-01-03T05:24:00.000Z	tuntun		I installed gutsy from cd yesterday and to my pleasant surprise there wasn't a whole slew of updates waiting for download. So are they doing regular updates to the iso now? I really hope so!

2008-01-03T05:26:00.000Z	LjL-Mobile	tuntun	sorry :)
2008-01-03T05:28:00.000Z	LjL-Mobile	tuntun	well either uncomment them or generate a whole new list from source-o-matic (/msg ubotu som)
