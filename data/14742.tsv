2011-05-02T21:22:00.000Z	fi103910		hi all - I'm very unexperienced with Linux (know some, but not much...) and ran into a problem after updating to 11.04. For some reason, the "default boot" option doesn't work. Can someone help me with this... ? :)

2011-05-02T21:27:00.000Z	fi103910	sebsebseb	- shouldn't the boot be exactly identical, regardless of which way I boot ? Default or "older version" - as long as the version I select is the same kernel version ?
