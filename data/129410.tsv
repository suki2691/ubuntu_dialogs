2007-07-06T15:04:00.000Z	banlieue	charliko	as root? we have sudo for that, and you likely want to keep it that way (security reasons)
2007-07-06T15:04:00.000Z	banlieue	charliko	it is possible, but I do recommend not to
2007-07-06T15:06:00.000Z	banlieue	charliko	if you insist read http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-31053.html but once again, it's recommended not to log in as root (especially by default)
