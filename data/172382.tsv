2007-02-08T12:18:00.000Z	sketcher		I just burned a (intel) DVD image of ubuntu 6.10 on a dvd and popped it in my PC but after the splashscreen/loading screen the monitor loses its signal, :(
2007-02-08T12:19:00.000Z	mistform	sketcher	does it fail with other OS's?
2007-02-08T12:22:00.000Z	mistform	sketcher	are you using a pci/agp graphics card, or onboard?
2007-02-08T12:23:00.000Z	mistform	sketcher	search the ubuntu forums to see if anyone else had problems with an ATI A-I-W
