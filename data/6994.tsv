2011-12-18T21:47:00.000Z	daniel_mircea	escott	yeah.. so i've heard :))
2011-12-18T21:48:00.000Z	daniel_mircea	escott	from what i've searched the net i think a possible ..rather barbaric solution would be erasing casper-rw file on usb stick and making a fresh one
2011-12-18T21:49:00.000Z	escott	daniel_mircea	casper is the system disk image. so yes that would get rid of the os on the flash
