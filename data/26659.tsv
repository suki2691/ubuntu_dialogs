2010-09-13T11:23:00.000Z	Blackweb		so just try looking in the software center for another wireless driver
2010-09-13T11:23:00.000Z	glebihan	Blackweb	could you pastebin output of "sudo ifconfig" ?
2010-09-13T11:36:00.000Z	Blackweb	glebihan	I tried to paste what ifconfig brings up but now when its connected to a cord its not wanting to work either
2010-09-13T11:37:00.000Z	glebihan	Blackweb	that's weird, the command I gave you doesn't do anything except printing informations
