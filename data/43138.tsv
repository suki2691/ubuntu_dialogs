2010-03-10T00:10:00.000Z	TxPitou	thieusoai	you could do a grep > filename ?
2010-03-10T00:11:00.000Z	thieusoai	TxPitou	ic -- no easy way to just output errors
2010-03-10T00:12:00.000Z	TxPitou	thieusoai	i would check Man gcc there might be a --command to output errors to a redirect, I dont really know.. but one woudl think it exists
