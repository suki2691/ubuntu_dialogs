2007-03-09T15:51:00.000Z	MrOnions		hey everyone... I need a command (or preferably multiple) executed every time I start a terminal (to alter PS1) -- my first guess was .profile but that's for login shells... which file do I need?
2007-03-09T15:52:00.000Z	MrOnions		thank you nosrednaekim and Jowi and eck
2007-03-09T15:52:00.000Z	MrOnions		and francois too I guess, although that doesn't seem right
