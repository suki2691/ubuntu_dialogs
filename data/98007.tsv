2010-11-15T19:50:00.000Z	duckx0r		Ii just reinstalled ubuntu on a bunch of my computers in an internet cafe, however one of the computers completely locks up after about 5 min idle time. After seeing this, I remembered that I added something to the grub boot line in the previous install that fixed it, but I can't remember what that was. Does anyone have any ideas?
