2004-10-05T09:24:00.000Z	jeld		I have just installed ubuntu on my system, it seems that the only locale present is en_US.iso88591 how would I go about installing en_US.utf8
2004-10-05T09:26:00.000Z	jeld		finally, a distribution that actually DOES work out of the box (even if there is no box :) ) Great work, thanx!
2004-10-05T09:27:00.000Z	Mitario	jeld	yeah, ubuntu is even so good, the box just pops up out of existence in front of you!
