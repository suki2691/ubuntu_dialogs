2011-02-04T20:55:00.000Z	Gnea	PCdoc	probably not.
2011-02-04T21:01:00.000Z	PCdoc	Gnea	by that person's question, i too assumed that he meant, whether the timers were set becoz of which the bluetooth was dying out after some time ... :)
2011-02-04T21:02:00.000Z	Gnea	PCdoc	He asked if the timers had been set yet or not, which assumes "well, if they haven't been set, then set them already!"
