2007-11-05T11:02:00.000Z	Mystroth		Hello, is this the right channel to ask for help setting up a VNC server on my UBUNTU machine?
2007-11-05T11:02:00.000Z	nrp	Mystroth	indeed, ask
2007-11-05T11:06:00.000Z	nrp	Mystroth	i've found X11vnc very easy to use as a vnc server
2007-11-05T11:06:00.000Z	nrp	Mystroth	there are some great examples on how to tunnel it through SSH at http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/
