2008-11-05T00:16:00.000Z	Polterge|st	cube	this is what I was wondering. I may get a laptop soon that is AMD64 would Ubuntu Studio be the way to go on a 2ghz setup with 3gb of ram perhaps ? And do they have it in 64 bit ?
2008-11-05T00:17:00.000Z	Polterge|st	cube	does the 64 bit make a huge difference or is it just more stable mainly ?
2008-11-05T00:20:00.000Z	Polterge|st	cube	interesting... It seems as if the 64 bit system can address more physical ram and hard drive space perhaps or processor capability but does it actually utilize it as far as speed goes ? For instance on a 2ghz 64 bit AMD Ubuntu setup will I notice a large speed increase vs a 1.2ghz i386 Ubuntu setup ?
