2005-06-26T05:50:00.000Z	ompaul	ChurcH_of_FoamY	you can install it under gnome and run it there
2005-06-26T05:50:00.000Z	ompaul	ChurcH_of_FoamY	ever hear of Linux, it offers so much choice
2005-06-26T05:53:00.000Z	ompaul	ChurcH_of_FoamY	it used to be a tradition amoung some friends of mine to fire up a gas heater and place the CD in front of it where it would bend and buckle, these would then be glued to the noc wall
