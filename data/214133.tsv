2005-10-13T15:52:00.000Z	kestas		hi, I'm following the advice in the unofficial starter guide, and adding the extra repos, but I get the following error:
2005-10-13T15:52:00.000Z	kestas		Failed to fetch http://ubuntu-backports.mirrormax.net/dists/hoary-backports/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz  404 Not Found
2005-10-13T15:52:00.000Z	kestas		does anyone know why I get this with the backports?
2005-10-13T15:53:00.000Z	Yetr2	kestas	because it's a web 404, meaning it's not there, which usually means you got the address wrong
