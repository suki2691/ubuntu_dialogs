2011-07-15T00:31:00.000Z	galamar		Hello, I just installed a tv tuner card how do I tell if my comp detects it/ what drivers should I use?
2011-07-15T00:32:00.000Z	kunji	galamar	lspci I think will let you see if it's detected.
2011-07-15T00:34:00.000Z	galamar	kunji	ok it does detect it. How would I find a driver? Any way to use the windows driver from the companies website?
2011-07-15T00:37:00.000Z	kunji	galamar	I'm not sure, the mythtv folks probably have a much better idea than I do.  I never did get mine working under linux :(
