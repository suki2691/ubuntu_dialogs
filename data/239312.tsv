2005-04-30T09:33:00.000Z	SQL_Sam		i installed a stick of ram - 256mb.  I simply shutdown - added the stick and then turned the box on - I got major failures after that.  I basically got fed up and reinstalled with the new stick and it seems to be working fine.  My question is what did i do wrong?
2005-04-30T09:35:00.000Z	SQL_Sam		in the boot sequence etc/config.d input/output - something to that effect (didnt get time to write it down - which i should have)
2005-04-30T09:37:00.000Z	SQL_Sam		stupid question - i got another stick that I want to add (just wanted to get it working first with the 256 ram).  what do i need to do to add this stick?  What would be the 'process'?
2005-04-30T09:37:00.000Z	SkyNet	SQL_Sam	just install it on the machine i guess
