2006-10-13T07:29:00.000Z	Leumas		i have a question about networked drives
2006-10-13T07:30:00.000Z	Leumas		if i shared a windows folder on my computer, that had an NTFS filesystem, could i send anything to it over the network in Ubuntu?

2006-10-13T07:31:00.000Z	ben_underscore_	Leumas	it is really very efficient too
