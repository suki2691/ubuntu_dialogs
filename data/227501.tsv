2008-10-28T22:37:00.000Z	Jowi	matrix_	with what webmail site?
2008-10-28T22:38:00.000Z	Jowi	matrix_	haven't tried hotmail since mid 90's. But check that you haven't got javascript deactivated.
2008-10-28T22:39:00.000Z	Jowi	matrix_	to see if there is a problem with the site or with firefox - start firefox using a clean profile "firefox -ProfileManager"
