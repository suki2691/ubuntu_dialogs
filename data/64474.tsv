2009-07-09T12:29:00.000Z	CTShadow		i've got an ubuntu 8.10 server with 2 nic's sharing the same subnet and ltsp installed. on eht0 i've got my production network and on eth1 are my ltsp clients. the server leases ip's with dhcp via both interfaces, but does not respond on arp requests on eth1 (the ltsp interface). how can i fix this?
