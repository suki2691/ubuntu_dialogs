2008-09-17T11:43:00.000Z	psypher246		does everyone think hardy is the best ubuntu so far? 5 months now and i'm starting to think I should go back to gutsy, this is very frustrating, i  make forums posts and irc chats but no reesponse at all from anyone
2008-09-17T11:44:00.000Z	Taiga-SK	psypher246	hardy is my first linux and i thing it ยงs just great. (not xubuntu though)
2008-09-17T11:44:00.000Z	psypher246	Taiga-SK	so you are perfectly happy, no issues at all, feel like i'm running Win 3.1 on a 286, it's terrible
2008-09-17T11:45:00.000Z	Taiga-SK	psypher246	i can'ลง acces my printer but it's a linux-wide problem.
