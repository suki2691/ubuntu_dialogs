2007-06-18T13:06:00.000Z	timephoenix		Hello everyone, I need some help recovering a ReiserFS partition which has disappeared
2007-06-18T13:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	timephoenix	Try testdisk
2007-06-18T13:09:00.000Z	timephoenix	Jordan_U	Where can I download testdisk? I'm using the Live CD right now, but even with universe and multiverse enabled it doesn't seem to be on the servers.
2007-06-18T13:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	timephoenix	Have you updated the package list since enabling them?
