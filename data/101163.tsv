2008-02-07T04:07:00.000Z	TKingdom		Got a quick question about installing ATI Proprietary drivers... Should I uncheck the USE option in the Restricted Drivers Manager for my current video card/drivers?
2008-02-07T04:07:00.000Z	TKingdom		before installing the new drivers...
2008-02-07T04:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	TKingdom	The drivers in Restricted Manger ARE the restricted ATI drivers, unless you are installing a newer version manually
2008-02-07T04:08:00.000Z	TKingdom	Jordan_U	 Yes, I am manually updating the drivers.
