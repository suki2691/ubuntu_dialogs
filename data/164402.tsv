2006-10-19T14:03:00.000Z	DeZusa		I have a question about installing Ubuntu on my laptop. Will I have to find drive routines for stuff after the installation to be able to use it. For example the dvd-drive, the usb port, the WLAN etc.

2006-10-19T14:04:00.000Z	Ignatius	DeZusa	I doubt it.
2006-10-19T14:04:00.000Z	Ignatius	DeZusa	mine worked out of the box.
