2008-07-23T23:07:00.000Z	gamerpro2000		Alright.  I'm trying to put ubuntu 8.04 on my Toshiba A105 with an Intel 945GMA card in it.  When I start up the live disc, all of the text is HUGE, including the text in the log in field and when I finally get to the desktop, I can't see anything because there is a gigantic window covering everything with font, like, 90.  Anyone got an idea how to fix it?  I've already tried Ctrl+Alt+Backspace hoping it was a glitch I could fix
