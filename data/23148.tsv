I'm just trying to make it aware that a lot of people devoted a LOT of time and energy into Unity, and it actually is a very very intuitive interface. Different? Oh yes. So different it may be frustrating. But once you get used to it, it's amazing how nice it is to use.

I'm just suggesting that you try it for an extended period of time, and instead of trying to do things the old way, find a new way to do them. AFter all, that's the only way to learn in a new environment, in my opinion.
