2009-06-27T23:00:00.000Z	angie_		I installed the new Firefox 3.5 rc3 and followed the instructions on the Ubuntu wiki to use it as the default browser. Everything's working well, but fonts look ugly. I followed the instructions here (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=7094387) but it had no effect. Anyone know what I can do to fix?
