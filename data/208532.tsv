2011-05-28T04:08:00.000Z	wohnpal		I have a videoproblem, my videocard does not work with kubuntu 11.04, I need to drop to a shell and change some drivers, however, the grub loader in kubuntu 11.04 does not show the "escape" option with which it is possible to go to a textboot!
2011-05-28T04:08:00.000Z	wohnpal		how can I overcome this
