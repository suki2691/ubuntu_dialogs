2012-01-27T22:07:00.000Z	loffe		Somehow I've set my account to not require password on login (it's just a login button) and now I can't find how to enable the password prompt. I cannot change it in 'User Accounts'. Where should I look?
2012-01-27T22:07:00.000Z	nyrpnz	loffe	system->administration->login screen
2012-01-27T22:08:00.000Z	loffe	nyrpnz	hehe, I have no such icon
