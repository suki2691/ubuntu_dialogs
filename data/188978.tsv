2007-11-26T15:36:00.000Z	mattfletcher		HELP! I've used Sony's recovery partitino on my laptop to restore Windows to my laptop (don't worry, I'm putting Ubuntu back on afterwards too!). It has restored the drive to a single Windows partition, but not overwritten the MBR, so GRUB is still coming up and failing. How can I reset GRUB temporarily so it just boots the Windows partition?
