2009-06-03T23:30:00.000Z	djdavis75	pietje	hmm, but it doesn't lock up, it comes back?
2009-06-03T23:31:00.000Z	pietje	djdavis75	yes it comes back after about 10 seconds.  the app greyes out for the time it hangs
2009-06-03T23:32:00.000Z	djdavis75	pietje	not sure then, something is cause the app to slow way down and not respond
