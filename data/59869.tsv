2009-07-02T10:45:00.000Z	mase_work	P_Kable	i dunno about LOGS , but the log files are located in /var/log/ i imagine. proabably /var/log/nfs or something like that
2009-07-02T10:46:00.000Z	mase_work	P_Kable	that wasn't the problem you stated.
2009-07-02T10:47:00.000Z	mase_work	P_Kable	what does the nfs config file list for logging  ? does it have its own log file or does it use syslog ?
