2011-05-01T11:51:00.000Z	thegoodcushion		Alright, let me start a debate: Is it true that 10.04 is less likely to have bugs, or have fewer bugs, than 11.04?  Or is the benefit really that one does not need to upgrade/relearn things/upgrade hardware/etc?
2011-05-01T11:52:00.000Z	thegoodcushion		It seems to me that no release is every truly stable.  There are always bugfixes and new releases etc
2011-05-01T11:52:00.000Z	Maahes	thegoodcushion	neither of those things is really a true statement.
2011-05-01T11:53:00.000Z	Maahes	thegoodcushion	10.04 has gnome.
