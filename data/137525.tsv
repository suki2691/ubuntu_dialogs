2007-04-22T08:42:00.000Z	Fnyar		After upgrading to Feisty, I now have a network icon on my system tray area that I can't seem to get rid of. Does anyone else have this problem?

2007-04-22T08:43:00.000Z	Fnyar	zeroday	hmm, I don't have any wireless adapters...
2007-04-22T08:58:00.000Z	Fnyar	zeroday	thanks for the suggestion regarding network-manager, that's certainly what was putting the icon in my system tray. That seems strange that there wouldn't be an option to not display it.
