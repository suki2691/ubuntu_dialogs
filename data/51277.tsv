2009-09-20T00:36:00.000Z	trism	wite	you should try to get them all working using nvidia settings before writing the xorg.conf, although I don't know how well that works with 3, but I can get my two working that way
2009-09-20T00:37:00.000Z	wite	trism	i tried that, and i can't get them to work with just the nvidia settings
2009-09-20T00:47:00.000Z	trism	wite	a couple posts down in this thread http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=97777 a guy lists his 3 monitor xorg.conf using nvidia and ubuntu, might want to check it out
