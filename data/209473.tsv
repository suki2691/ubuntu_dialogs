2006-07-20T06:58:00.000Z	LjL	teimu	in the dir where the file resides, change their mode to executable (chmod +x filename), and "./filename"
2006-07-20T06:58:00.000Z	LjL	teimu	also, if that's a program you're trying to install, make very sure there is not a ready-made Ubuntu package instead of that .bin
2006-07-20T07:00:00.000Z	LjL	teimu	no. at least i don't think one has been made available
