2010-09-17T22:11:00.000Z	Opsrc		Hi, can anyone tell me how to upgrade JDK to version 1.5 or above in ubuntu ??
2010-09-17T22:11:00.000Z	wabash	Opsrc	It should be a Sun package in Synaptic.
2010-09-17T22:14:00.000Z	wabash	Opsrc	That's a fairly recent version.... not the latest.
2010-09-17T22:15:00.000Z	Opsrc	wabash	yes,but my program is asking for a particular older one :(
