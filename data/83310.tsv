2008-09-16T18:49:00.000Z	ViperBorg		Haveing a problem with Ubuntu 8.04: I can't save the motd file. I keep getting a permissions error. How can I get around this? Thanks. (/etc/motd and /etc/motd.tail)
2008-09-16T18:49:00.000Z	adam7	ViperBorg	are you using root?
2008-09-16T18:51:00.000Z	ViperBorg	adam7	Nope. How to I enable the root login so that I can do that. Sudo doesn't help me at all because the terminal doesn't have a program to go and edit the file.
2008-09-16T18:53:00.000Z	adam7	ViperBorg	you can use nano
