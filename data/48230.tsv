2011-08-23T16:40:00.000Z	Delano		I want to scan a drive for viruses. I'm running Maverick and have the drive attached via usb cable. I've installed clamtk but I can't find it anywhere. Where do I look?
2011-08-23T16:40:00.000Z	Delano		How do I do it?
2011-08-23T16:40:00.000Z	OerHeks	Delano	clamtk is a commandline scanner.
2011-08-23T16:41:00.000Z	Delano	OerHeks	oh! Duh
