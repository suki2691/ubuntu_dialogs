2006-06-04T09:14:00.000Z	Moodles		something is wrong with my Ubuntu 6.06, Mplayer doesn't run, it shows its loading screen then exits
2006-06-04T09:14:00.000Z	slavik	Moodles	run it from a terminal, that way you get some error
2006-06-04T09:16:00.000Z	Moodles	slavik	do you know where the binary executable is for mplayer?
2006-06-04T09:21:00.000Z	Moodles	slavik	missing font
