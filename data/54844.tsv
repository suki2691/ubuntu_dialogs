2009-06-09T01:42:00.000Z	resno		is it recommened to defrag a hd in linux?
2009-06-09T01:43:00.000Z	IamDaveMyers	resno	defrag should be done "on the fly" on most of the linux file systems
2009-06-09T01:43:00.000Z	resno	IamDaveMyers	i saw the e4defrag and starting wondering.
2009-06-09T01:45:00.000Z	IamDaveMyers	resno	I can understan that... maybe it is more "optimised". or good if you have files of particular size (some file systems have larger "blocks" and hene are better for diferent things, such as video  /dvd
