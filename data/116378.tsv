2008-05-22T13:34:00.000Z	davidmo		when I use rsync to sync a server  in other pv some files in the log put permission dennied(13) but the others no problem
2008-05-22T13:35:00.000Z	davidmo		I put rsync -super, -o -p -g = owner group... the smae to the source computer but the permission dennied (13) appears  another time
