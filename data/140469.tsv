2007-10-06T10:12:00.000Z	switchcat		I'm trying to figure out why my X sometimes freezes/seemingly won't accept keyboard input and how to fix it. (Ubuntu feisty 7.04)...
2007-10-06T10:13:00.000Z	switchcat		it's currently frozen (the mouse pointer moves but it doesn't accept any mouse button inputs).. and no keyboard inputs seemingly
2007-10-06T10:13:00.000Z	switchcat		except the ability to go back to console
2007-10-06T10:13:00.000Z	Nubbie	switchcat	are you using effects, beryl, compiz, etc?
