2007-06-15T16:11:00.000Z	spiker611		My problem is that I have a HTPC with a 7900GS and a Sony Trinitron (CRT) HDTV with a HDMI input.  I bought a DVI - HDMI adapter and plugged my HTPC in.  On installing ubuntu, I could not change the resolution past 640x480.  I installed the nvidia drivers but I still cannot get a good picture even close to 1080i (which is the highest the TV supports).  What should I do?
