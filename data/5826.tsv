2012-07-23T14:11:00.000Z	Bert_2		Hi, is there a way to upgrade from 6.06 or 8.04 to 12.04 or will we have to hop by all LTSes (upgrade in LTS steps) ?
2012-07-23T14:13:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Bert_2	LTS to LTS hop should work.
2012-07-23T14:15:00.000Z	Bert_2	cfhowlett	thx, I guess our firewall server is getting a fresh install then (hops from 6.06 seem a bit daft)
2012-07-23T14:16:00.000Z	cfhowlett	Bert_2	good luck.
