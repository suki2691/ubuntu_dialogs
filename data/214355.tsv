2006-06-02T16:54:00.000Z	queuetue		I have a dapper box with a static IP set of 192.168.2.12 ... After a few seconds of the IP being what it should be, it always resets itself (as reported by ifconfig) to 169.254.250.90 ... It's not an IP conflict (I've changed it several times, to other empty addresses) ... wth would cause this IP to keep getting "lost"?
