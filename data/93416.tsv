2010-07-20T22:22:00.000Z	Quimby		I have a question: My ubuntu install is somehow messed up. Whenever I boot in ubuntu, it continually loops the startup jingle and flashes the capslock light. Mouse doesn't work either. I can't go into safemode and I can't even boot from a liveCD now, and it does the exact same. What in the world could be wrong?

2010-07-20T22:24:00.000Z	violinappren	Quimby	did you recently add or remove hardware?
