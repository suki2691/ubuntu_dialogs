2010-05-04T11:40:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam		_Zappy_:  From the command line its "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras", or just search the Software Center for "Ubuntu Restricted Extras"
2010-05-04T11:40:00.000Z	CogitoErgoSam		_Zappy_:  And obviously if you're using a different flavor of ubuntu like kubuntu that'd be kubuntu-restricted-extras or whatever
