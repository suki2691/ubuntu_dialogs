2007-09-28T10:16:00.000Z	scyon		I like vim instead of vi. does that make me less manly? ;)
2007-09-28T10:17:00.000Z	scyon		yes, one standard editor to rule them all. who needs error messages anyway?
2007-09-28T10:18:00.000Z	ckrough	scyon	vi is just a symlink to vim in most cases
2007-09-28T10:19:00.000Z	scyon	ckrough	thanks, I didn't know that.
