2010-07-25T02:07:00.000Z	Ichat		does anybody know of a ubuntu package with a  CLI gui for  WICD ?
2010-07-25T02:07:00.000Z	randy_	Ichat	well, there is... iwconfig
2010-07-25T02:08:00.000Z	randy_	Ichat	wicd, like all window'd wireless configurations tools, in some way shape or form, is going to work with iwconfig, the cli tool for working with wireless network configuration
2010-07-25T02:11:00.000Z	randy_	Ichat	that may be so, wicd may be doing some scanning in the background finding networks; network-manager does the same thing.  both applications, though, use wireless-tools in some way
