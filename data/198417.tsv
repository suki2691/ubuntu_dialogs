2011-05-15T05:59:00.000Z	cablop	BeWilled	server? go real install, not wubi, wubi places an image inside your windows system... guess what could happen if your windows fuilesystem become damaged?
2011-05-15T06:02:00.000Z	cablop	BeWilled	well, thing this way, databases create somehow their own filesystems running on top other filesystems, then you need to care enough about it
2011-05-15T06:03:00.000Z	cablop	BeWilled	but you are going to install a server, you need reliability, NTFS is not a native fs for linux, so depend on it is...
