2005-09-20T14:57:00.000Z	danst		Hi I am having a small problem with my session management (dont know if this is the right term for it) in ubuntu: last time I shut my computer down I wanted to try the "save session" checkbox. now I am having the problem that everytime I log in a terminal and some other windows open up. How can I prevent them from opening? I dont know how to make them not autostart!
