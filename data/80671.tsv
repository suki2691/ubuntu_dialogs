2008-09-08T10:23:00.000Z	Orchid`		Hi! i am looking for a way to find out if i can run Spore on my UBuntu computer, will someone please help me figure this out, or point me to a directory assistance table?
2008-09-08T10:24:00.000Z	Daisuke_Ido	Orchid`	write to the company and ask for a linux version
2008-09-08T10:24:00.000Z	Daisuke_Ido	Orchid`	if that fails, go to #winehq
2008-09-08T10:25:00.000Z	Orchid`	Daisuke_Ido	 i have WINE, however when i try to find otu if i can mount my cd-rw drive it says htere is no media in the drive, and thus cannot mount it.
