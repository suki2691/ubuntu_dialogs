2012-05-07T18:27:00.000Z	UICTamale		can anyone recommend some nice dark gtk themes?  I'm currently using swar black, but it's got this annoying tiling background that doesn't fit unity's nautilus windows

2012-05-07T18:28:00.000Z	UICTamale	Lasher	thanks, checking it out
2012-05-07T18:31:00.000Z	Lasher	UICTamale	I like it as much as I can - still prefer gtk2+ Slickness-Black
