2008-08-04T22:12:00.000Z	cwillu	alphis	I think the standard -generic kerenl supports it, if it doesn't, then the -server kernel will
2008-08-04T22:15:00.000Z	alphis	cwillu	does anyone know for sure? how can i tell if the desktop edition supports quad core or not after i install it?
2008-08-04T22:15:00.000Z	cwillu	alphis	the desktop kernel in 6.06 supported 8 cores, I can't imagine they reduced it
