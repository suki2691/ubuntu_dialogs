2010-02-12T09:26:00.000Z	tetsuo_	k0d3g3ar	I'm sure. Something stopped working and it's not my mp3 =(
2010-02-12T09:27:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	tetsuo_	 Reason I ask is that I have a laptop here that did something very similar.  Found out that it was a flaky power supply to the ports.  Changed the device to a differnent port and magically it appeared
