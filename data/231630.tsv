2005-07-01T16:27:00.000Z	Fabian		can anyone explain to me, how I write a script in linux?
2005-07-01T16:27:00.000Z	loply	Fabian	Thats not something you can cover on IRC really (bit of a large subject)
2005-07-01T16:28:00.000Z	Fabian	loply	I mean, just a simple script, which executes one command after another in a shell
2005-07-01T16:30:00.000Z	loply	Fabian	Just make a file with the executable permission set, and put #!/bin/bash as the first line of the file
