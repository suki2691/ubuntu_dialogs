2011-10-14T23:57:00.000Z	meco		I just installed Spotify.exe but I can't find the file. What's the command for that?
2011-10-14T23:57:00.000Z	[_miT_]	meco	i run a really horrible find cmd (this is not correct, but it works for me) cd to /
2011-10-14T23:58:00.000Z	[_miT_]	meco	sudo find . -name 'spotify.exe'
2011-10-14T23:58:00.000Z	[_miT_]	meco	but in all honesty, it should be in ~/Downloads
