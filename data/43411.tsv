2010-02-27T22:40:00.000Z	harisund		Occasionally when I reboot my computer "ubuntu-server-9.10" it show the grub menu with list of kernels and no timer !!! This is really really irritating since then I have to physically go to the computer to choose the kernel :( Why does this keep happening?
2010-02-27T22:40:00.000Z	tiemonster	harisund	delete old kernels
2010-02-27T22:41:00.000Z	harisund	tiemonster	doesn't really help -- it shows my current kernel and the recovery opton and is stuck there anyway. The point is, there's no count down timer
