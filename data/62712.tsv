2009-11-01T23:56:00.000Z	gantrixx		I assume you could add those to the desktop addition if you wanted
2009-11-01T23:56:00.000Z	iceroot	gantrixx	the server does not come with apache and mysql by default. the difference is that the server has no gui and another kernel
2009-11-01T23:56:00.000Z	iceroot	gantrixx	the packages and repos are the same, so no apache and mysql by default
