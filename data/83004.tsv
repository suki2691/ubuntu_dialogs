2008-09-27T04:37:00.000Z	carandraug	Alyxander	I think so. But have you considered vector linux?
2008-09-27T04:37:00.000Z	Alyxander	carandraug	that was my next guess
2008-09-27T04:38:00.000Z	carandraug	Alyxander	I would go with vectorlinux if I was you. Or, if you have the skills, a Debian installation
