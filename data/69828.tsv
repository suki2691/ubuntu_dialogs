2010-05-24T01:11:00.000Z	Barridus		the command "service crond status" spits out "unrecognized service".  same with service cron start.  the command "/etc/init.d/crond start" spits back "no such file or directory".  how can i have the Cron package installed but not have hte service?  none of my jobs will run.  anyone know what's going on here?
