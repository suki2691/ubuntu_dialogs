2008-10-10T13:26:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ushills	any scanner that runs the niash chipset are cheap and compatible.
2008-10-10T13:26:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ushills	scanjets seem to be mostly supported.
2008-10-10T13:28:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ushills	THe scanjet 3300c (if they still make those) are cheap and they work.
