2007-10-26T12:12:00.000Z	zcat[1]	linuxnoob	nope; different thing
2007-10-26T12:13:00.000Z	linuxnoob	zcat[1]	is libdvdcss still the thing you need to watch dvds?
2007-10-26T12:14:00.000Z	zcat[1]	linuxnoob	yeah, libdvdread is (I think) something to do with how the filesystem is arranged on a dvd, libdvdcss2 is the library that decrypts encrypted VOB's into plain MPEG that you can play.
