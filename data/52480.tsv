2009-10-10T07:43:00.000Z	KnifeySpooney		Hi, I just rebooted after installing updates in karmic, but now my machine is unbootable after being tossed a bootchart error during boot. After the bootchart error is a cannot mount filesystem error. Then the comp reboots. Right now i'm using a liveUSB. How can I uninstall a package in my harddisk installation of Ubuntu from a liveCD?

2009-10-10T07:44:00.000Z	KnifeySpooney	ZykoticK9	Thanks, I'm already in there but I figured that this question is not really about karmic but Ubuntu in general. Do you know of a way to uninstall bootchart from a livecd?
