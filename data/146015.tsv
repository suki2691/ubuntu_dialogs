2007-06-19T07:27:00.000Z	newtubuntu		Trying to install Ubuntu for the first time on a brand new Dell. I partitionned my drive in Vista, freed some space (140Gb) and launched my ISO CD. The CD works fine, but Ubuntu offers me just 640X480 or 800X600 screen resolution for install/setup on a large screen display. So I am stuck because I can't get to an 'OK' button in regional settings window.... I can't scroll down.
2007-06-19T07:29:00.000Z	newtubuntu		I need help for a fresh install
2007-06-19T07:29:00.000Z	newtubuntu		is anyone available for a 'short private chat' ?
