2012-08-14T17:28:00.000Z	kyle6513		hello, anyone around who wants to help me getting linux-PHC (undervolting) working? I know it's not really an UBUNTU problem, but I'm having problems loading the module, I recieve an error after running modprobe phc-intel which basically says "Input/output error" googling comes up with nothing useful.

2012-08-14T17:30:00.000Z	kyle6513	DJones	I've already asked and there's a total of about 5 people in there and they're non-responsive. Thanks though!
