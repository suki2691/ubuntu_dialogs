2012-08-21T18:04:00.000Z	sin_tax		hello. I am getting a headless ubuntu 12.04 server up and running.  So far so good. I am about to add two 3TB drives to it.  What is the best way to mount and share those so that they can be accessed from a Windows client over the network?
2012-08-21T18:04:00.000Z	MoTec	sin_tax	install samba
2012-08-21T18:05:00.000Z	sin_tax	MoTec	after I install samba I assume that I will need to format the disks and set them to be shared?
