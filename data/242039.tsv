2007-10-30T04:01:00.000Z	astro76	IanLiu	you have a subtitle file? use vlc
2007-10-30T04:02:00.000Z	astro76	IanLiu	if it's the same filename with a subtitle extension vlc in the same dir, vlc will load it automatically
2007-10-30T04:02:00.000Z	astro76	IanLiu	scratch the first vlc and that sentence will make sense ;)
