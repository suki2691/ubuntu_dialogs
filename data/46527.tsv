2011-07-10T23:32:00.000Z	stercor		I'm installing 10.04LTS (downloaded from ubuntu.com via BitTorrent) from a USB stick. After selecting the USB stick as the boot drive, this message immediately appears: "Unknown keyword in configuration file: gfxboot", then "vesamenu.c32: not a COM32R image"

2011-07-10T23:35:00.000Z	stercor	pfifo	That's a good guess.  I'll make it again.
