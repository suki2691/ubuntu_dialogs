2010-05-03T06:22:00.000Z	TomV-415		I'm thinking about upgrading to 10.04 from 9.10 on my old Dell D800. (Nvidia graphics) anyone done that?   I'm curious how easy/hard it would be to 'roll back' to 9.10 if it doesn't work well for me.
2010-05-03T06:22:00.000Z	jadakren	TomV-415	you can't rollback
2010-05-03T06:22:00.000Z	TomV-415		Anyone rolled back to 9.10 after upgrading to 10.04?
2010-05-03T06:23:00.000Z	TomV-415	jadakren	I guess I can also do a full backup, and then reinstall...yetch.
