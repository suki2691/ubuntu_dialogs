2008-08-16T10:34:00.000Z	Kohlrak	jason_	maybe... Try messing around with "hardware information" from the "system -> preferances"
2008-08-16T10:35:00.000Z	jason_	Kohlrak	  i need to know the actual driver... i know the general info... i know there is a command that will tell me the module
2008-08-16T10:37:00.000Z	Kohlrak	jason_	hm.. i think there is, but i can never remember what it is...
