2007-01-02T08:40:00.000Z	EvilMike		A few hours ago I came here because my sound wasn't working. I got help and was able to get something to load on startup so the soundcard would work. Unfortunately, I just discovered it doesnt work completely yet. I can play music and videos, but system sounds wont work
