2005-10-31T12:48:00.000Z	bluefrog-10		my processor is I686. ubuntu keeps on installing I386. Should I care or am I just wasting chasing ghosts?

2005-10-31T12:49:00.000Z	bofh80	bluefrog-10	(i think) i found one of the boot options was for a 686 kernel. can't remember. normally you ahve to type linux26 at the boot cd prompt or something. maybe not on ubuntu tho
2005-10-31T12:50:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	bofh80	both kernels are on the server disk I think
