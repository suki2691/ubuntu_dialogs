2012-05-29T06:32:00.000Z	ejv	strictland	anything over 4G is probably excessive; i don't even have swap.
2012-05-29T06:33:00.000Z	ejv	strictland	if you have the drive space to burn, 50% of your memory then, so if you have 1000 firefox tabs... yea heh
2012-05-29T06:38:00.000Z	ejv	strictland	my usage pattern may not reflect yours; and I /never/ hibernate.
