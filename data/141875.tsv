2007-04-29T13:48:00.000Z	Xucrute		Hi... a strange thing happend here... I have been using Ubuntu (7.04) for a week now.. everything was ok, even beryl was working. Today, after a reboot, my keybord layout is wrong and I cannot set a higher screen resolution than 800x600 (although other possibilities are set in xorg.conf)... Can any one give a hint to what might be happening
