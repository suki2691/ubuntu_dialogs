2010-03-09T02:22:00.000Z	gasull		Hi.  I was trying to install the latest VLC from Lucid in Karmic but stopped when I realized I needed to upgrade libc6.  Now I have unmet dependencies because I installed the following packages with dpkg: libfribidi0_0.19.2-1_i386.deb and  libqtcore4_4.6.2-0ubuntu1_i386.deb.  How can I remove them leaving the version that was in place before I f***ed up?  Thanks.

2010-03-09T02:23:00.000Z	xangua		@google getdeb
