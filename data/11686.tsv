2011-09-16T08:19:00.000Z	lokomis		You already had a Gnome install and just added XFCE, correct?
2011-09-16T08:20:00.000Z	lokomis		lemme put on my Goggles because I'm not sure if it's as simple as an apt-get remove xubuntu-desktop and then an autoremove or not.  You should still be able to use Gnome though by choosing that as you session on the login screen
2011-09-16T08:22:00.000Z	lion42	lokomis	I'm looking in the software center, and it has an option to use that to delete xubuntu-desktop, and also to select what packages associated with xubuntu to delete with it. I think this would work?
