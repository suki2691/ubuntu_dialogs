2008-04-28T01:14:00.000Z	Holyphoenix		Question about Dual boot environment with Windows Vista 64-bit and ubuntu 8.04 My MBR was on my first drive with a older XP partition an a HP Recovery Partition and I also had a slave drive connected with Vista 64. I formatted and installed Ubuntu on the first drive while keeping my Vista 64 Drive and OS intact. I just need to know how to edit the menu.lst to reference the boot on the Vista Partition again

My Vista loader was on my first hard drive but of course when I Installed ubuntu it killed that loader and loaded grub. Since I am new I don't know how to reference that second drive in the GRUB menu.lst
