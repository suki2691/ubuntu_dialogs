2009-08-21T19:44:00.000Z	tonii	Iyunkateus	I believe a gracefull kill of an app allows it to save data and neded stuff before terminating. a force kill just kills it.
2009-08-21T19:45:00.000Z	Iyunkateus	tonii	So ending is a "graceful kill"?
2009-08-21T19:49:00.000Z	tonii	Iyunkateus	the terminology used depends on what way you terminate the app I suppose :)
