2007-04-21T09:41:00.000Z	Hobbsee	redsmurf	depending on what it is, and how much you've added, ti may work, may break.  try it, or clean install
2007-04-21T09:44:00.000Z	Hobbsee	redsmurf	that depends what exactly youv'e installed.
2007-04-21T09:54:00.000Z	Hobbsee	redsmurf	*snort* - you've got two releases there.  try it, anyway
