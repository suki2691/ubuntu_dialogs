2008-06-11T23:57:00.000Z	zcat[1]	TehBrandon	update, there's a patch for the flash sound thing I think..
2008-06-12T00:00:00.000Z	zcat[1]	TehBrandon	can't recall.. just make sure you have the most recent flashplugin_nonfree package? I think they patched a bug or two in one of them
2008-06-12T00:02:00.000Z	TehBrandon	zcat[1]	just checked with apt and I have the latest version.
