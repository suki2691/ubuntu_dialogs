2011-12-19T14:56:00.000Z	hugokuo		how can I change the name of scsi driver  .... for example   change /dev/sda   to /dev/sdb
2011-12-19T14:57:00.000Z	geirha	hugokuo	Not much point in that really, just use UUID and/or LABEL instead of /dev/sda1 etc...
2011-12-19T14:58:00.000Z	hugokuo	geirha	, got it ... thx
