2009-08-26T20:40:00.000Z	gubuntu		can someone suggest where I should start looking for informaiton that would help me accomplish the following: I have a SQL database with a list of regex filenames in one column and a string of a destination for those files in another column.. i need a method of reading the table and running a move command based on those variable

2009-08-26T20:41:00.000Z	gubuntu	MikeSeth	i just mean they contain wildcards
2009-08-26T20:41:00.000Z	nibbler	gubuntu	so you just itereate, and mv $1 "$2"
