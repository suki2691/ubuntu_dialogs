I was able to use the dchp to get a dynamic ip which worked fine for an hour .. then it broke.. so i set up a manual ip that also worked for an hour and that broke..the netmask keeps changin to "24"
2008-11-03T18:39:00.000Z	frybye		and the net connection is dropped.. chage it back and it instantly gets broken again - and again...
