2007-07-30T13:27:00.000Z	jimcooncat_		want to install a server to test kvm and ltsp; have amd 4600+ dual core; should I get Ubuntu server Edition 7.04? 32 bit or 64 bit?

2007-07-30T13:30:00.000Z	jimcooncat_	compengi	I had seen so many horror stories about running 64 bit on the desktop .. I didn't know if it affected server apps
2007-07-30T13:34:00.000Z	compengi	jimcooncat_	i don't have 64bit support, but what i know is that cpus that support 64bit such as amd does and now intel run much faster and have better performance than 32bit cpus do, but regarding the applications i have no idea. trying it out won't hurt :)
