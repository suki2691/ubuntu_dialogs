I am trying to install ubuntu on a compaq persario 2500 (POS) and the window manager is going so slow I can't get the GUI installer to function.  The computer is not over loaded just sort of crawling for a unknow reason. is there a non-GUI installer I can use of the cd. Desktop version

2006-07-25T08:30:00.000Z	oskude	Chrono_trigger	its running from cd, so its normal that its slow
