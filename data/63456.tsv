2010-01-23T01:59:00.000Z	snake_		I need drivers for: "Dell 1397 WLAN 802.11g" and google is not my friend today...
2010-01-23T02:00:00.000Z	acicula	snake_	what does lspci report as the name of your wlan?
2010-01-23T02:01:00.000Z	snake_	acicula	my wireless card is named eth1 if that is what you need
2010-01-23T02:01:00.000Z	acicula	snake_	nope, type, chip and all that is important to solve the problem, if its not autodetected after a fresh install first connecgt a cable and update your system completely, maybe it will already propose the proper drivers via preferences->hardware drivers
