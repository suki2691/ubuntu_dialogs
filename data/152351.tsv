2007-01-22T09:53:00.000Z	torist		can someone help me with my SSH / X11 problem?
2007-01-22T09:53:00.000Z	torist		the error is: X11 connection rejected because of wrong authentication. The application 'gaim' lost its connection to the display :10.0; most likely the X server was shut down or you killed/destroyed the application. <-- this is after sudo ssh -X (or -Y) user@host
