2008-09-07T08:59:00.000Z	arrix		my ubuntu PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD are using the same buffer. Selecting text will overwrite the ctrl+c clipboard. Is there a setting to separate them?
2008-09-07T09:01:00.000Z	dr_willis	arrix	 there are some clipboard tools that can manage those (gclipper perhaps?) is one.
2008-09-07T09:02:00.000Z	arrix	dr_willis	I tried glipper, but still the same. I didn't have this problem before. I think I accidentally made the primary and clipboard using the same buffer
