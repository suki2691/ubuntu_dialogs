2007-09-07T05:45:00.000Z	Aishiko	SpudDogg	wish I could get my Ashen Empires working uder Wine
2007-09-07T05:46:00.000Z	SpudDogg	Aishiko	well, im working on Oblivion right now...I'll let you know how it goes, but what's the problem with Ashen Emp?  Have you tried wine-doors for your directx install?
2007-09-07T05:47:00.000Z	Aishiko	SpudDogg	Wine-Doors?  I've not heard of it.  basicly I get to the point where  it asks me to pick a server (only 2 servers) and no matter which one I click it gives me a login error and then I can't click on a different server even though it sayes to do just that
