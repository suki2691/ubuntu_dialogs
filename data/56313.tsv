2010-03-19T04:30:00.000Z	Dougdoug4_		Hey.. I have a problem. So, when used Ubuntu, I tried to use Wine to play Crossfire (see http://crossfire.z8games.com) but it wouldn't work.
2010-03-19T04:30:00.000Z	Dougdoug4_		I installed it with Wine Windows Program Loader, just like I should
2010-03-19T04:30:00.000Z	Dougdoug4_		But it wouldn't properly load
2010-03-19T04:31:00.000Z	MikeChelen	Dougdoug4_	checked the wine appdb to see if any tweaks are needed?
