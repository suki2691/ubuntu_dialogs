2008-06-16T06:44:00.000Z	banana21		got quiet in here real fast...
2008-06-16T06:46:00.000Z	banana21		Anybody willing to help?: reconfiguring locales on my system is resulting in freezes and/or segfaults
2008-06-16T06:47:00.000Z	jameslr	banana21	What are you doing when this is segfaulting?
2008-06-16T06:48:00.000Z	banana21	jameslr	I was running apt-get, and it froze, so in order to get it to work again I needed to run a dpkg --configure -a
