2011-02-22T04:21:00.000Z	adamruffolo		 I have a work network without domains.  Just pcs with work groups.  Working with a Windows 2003 Server. The server is old and I'm disliking windows.  I want to upgrade the server.  I'm looking at Ubuntu Server.  Any thoughts?
2011-02-22T04:23:00.000Z	brontoeee	adamruffolo	what is the server supposed to do?
2011-02-22T04:26:00.000Z	brontoeee	adamruffolo	shrug, did you ask in #ubuntu-server allready?
2011-02-22T04:27:00.000Z	adamruffolo	brontoeee	nope.  Didn't realize that channel existed. *hits head with hand*  should'a been obvious.  Asking there now.  Tks
