2005-11-05T10:11:00.000Z	loufoque	soce_32	I'm trying to use software like gThumb with archives without having to extract them because it's annoying
2005-11-05T10:14:00.000Z	soce_32	loufoque	you can't really get around extracting the archive if you want what's inside
2005-11-05T10:14:00.000Z	loufoque	soce_32	yes but I would like it to be done automagically
