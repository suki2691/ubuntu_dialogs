2008-11-07T04:48:00.000Z	kylepike	fallore	video or audio?
2008-11-07T04:52:00.000Z	fallore	kylepike	audio
2008-11-07T04:53:00.000Z	kylepike	fallore	I havn't noticed it with audio. but when playing video and if I "browse" to the share vs mounting it via cmd line then it won't play except in totem (mplayer, vlc dont work).
