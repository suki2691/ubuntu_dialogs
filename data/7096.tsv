2012-02-16T07:51:00.000Z	LoganShaw		Hello people, can anybody tell me what computer programming language ubuntu is made from?
2012-02-16T07:53:00.000Z	LoganShaw		Thanks but now I am even more confused.
2012-02-16T07:54:00.000Z	LoganShaw		I was told C is obsolete and C++ is the best.
2012-02-16T07:54:00.000Z	_Marcus	LoganShaw	C++ is okay at times. C is better at some areas though. This is Ubuntu support channel anyway. Type "!ot" for the off topic channel
