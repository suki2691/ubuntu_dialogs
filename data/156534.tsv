2007-03-12T12:10:00.000Z	xushi		I have a Toshiba Portege laptop which i want to install linux on. The only problem is that there is no cd-rom or floppy devices on the laptop.
2007-03-12T12:10:00.000Z	xushi		It does support booting with Intel PXE .. thing, but the wiki i read required that i have a second windows machine with TFTP installed. Is that seriously needed?
