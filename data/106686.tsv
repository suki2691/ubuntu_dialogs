2010-01-29T02:51:00.000Z	morganB		sudo dd if=/home/morgan/HÃ¤mtningar/archlinux-2009.08-netinstall-x86_64.img of=/dev/sdc1
2010-01-29T02:51:00.000Z	morganB		I haven't rebooted yet so I have the output of cat /proc/partitions with info about the old partitions. Is it something I can do with that to restore the partition table?
