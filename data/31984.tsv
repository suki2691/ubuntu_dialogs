2011-05-24T02:31:00.000Z	edbian	BentSpace	10.04 is a LTS   not 10.10
2011-05-24T02:36:00.000Z	BentSpace	edbian	 Yea, but sounds like there have been alot of problems with 11.04, is it worth it to install?
2011-05-24T02:36:00.000Z	edbian	BentSpace	It is very different from 10.10.  More different than most upgrades are.  I'm using it.  I think it works alright.
