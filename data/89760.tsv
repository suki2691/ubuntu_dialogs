2008-06-20T08:38:00.000Z	metalpres		ok, so the question thats been answered a billion times, can someone just give me a quick opinion,  is there really any benefit to using the amd64 version over the i386 version?, and is there any drawbacks?

2008-06-20T08:40:00.000Z	metalpres	orphean	ok thanks,  thats kind of what i was thinking
