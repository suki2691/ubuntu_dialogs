2008-04-24T18:10:00.000Z	andrer		is the ALTERNATE installer still necessary for raid/LVM installs?
2008-04-24T18:11:00.000Z	gord_slater	andrer	lotta people prefer the alternate anyways.....
2008-04-24T18:21:00.000Z	andrer	gord_slater	i know some people prefer the alternate version, but my case is that I only do lvm / raid installs and having 1 cd for livecd, and another for install is kind of redundant... if the new livecd  could do both... I would only need one...
2008-04-24T18:23:00.000Z	gord_slater	andrer	ah i see, yeah if u need both (assuming it cant do both in one) maybe u could master both onto a live-dvd and have a quick menu choice at boot...
