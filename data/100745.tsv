2008-05-31T00:31:00.000Z	sheepmas		hi people - I'm trying to re-install ubuntu, but the live cd installer seems to drop me to a sort of 'busybox' terminal without further info. I've done a bit of googling but couldn't find anything relevant. Any suggestions?
2008-05-31T00:31:00.000Z	sheepmas		Obviously I've installed it successfully before! Perhaps it's something to do with the fact it's already installed?

2008-05-31T00:32:00.000Z	ijusten	sheepmas	can't help, but "obviously" is usually the reason why something easy fails :)
