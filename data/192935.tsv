2006-07-06T15:54:00.000Z	Tarantulafudge		all the other distros are the same way, it makes no sense at all to keep the extra crap
2006-07-06T15:55:00.000Z	POVaddct	Tarantulafudge	you want to try deborphan
2006-07-06T15:55:00.000Z	Tarantulafudge	POVaddct	but the point is I'm having to open insatll applications and use cli just to remove deps that should have been removed anyways
