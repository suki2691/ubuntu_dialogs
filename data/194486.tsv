2006-03-31T08:24:00.000Z	Paradosso		I have to gather information into a simple database, to be quickly updated daily, and publish it in the guise of a neat chart (using colors) on a web page. What tools do I have and are best suited for such a task in kubuntu?
2006-03-31T08:25:00.000Z	solid_liq	Paradosso	just use mysql
2006-03-31T08:25:00.000Z	solid_liq	Paradosso	and a bash script or python script to populate the database if you like
2006-03-31T08:27:00.000Z	Paradosso	solid_liq	I can't understand your idea for a bash script
