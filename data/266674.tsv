2010-09-14T21:52:00.000Z	Screw		I have a question: Is it possible to install an Ubuntu to a pendrive? I have a 8gb pendrive and I have tried the ubuntu installer from pendrive and it worked well. But I would like to install to it.

2010-09-14T21:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Screw	 ive even installed a full install to a pendrive from a 'live' install on a 2nd pendrive
