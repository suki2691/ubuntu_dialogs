2007-08-05T15:48:00.000Z	Tom_		Hey, i installed ubuntu feisty fawn a few weeks back and got it connected to my wireless network. Ive just installed it after making a total switch from windows on my laptop but now it wont connect to the wireless network. I get the little window up to put the SSID in, I set the security to WEP 64bit HEX and put the code in, but then it just sits there trying to connect then it gives up after a minute or so... Any ideas?

2007-08-05T15:50:00.000Z	Askaaron	Tom_	and all other parameters are ok? Channel etc.?
2007-08-05T15:51:00.000Z	Askaaron	Tom_	and you are sure, that you only need a 64 bit wep key? This is nearly useless - can be cracked within minutes
