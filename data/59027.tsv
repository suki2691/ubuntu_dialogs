2010-09-04T12:46:00.000Z	Kruptein		my second problem btw is that I have both empaty and pidgin, because empathy is the new default I tried it out, but it doesn't suit me that well, so I decided to stik with pidgin,  but now when I'm online with pidgin, empathy sometimes just logges in :s verry annoying,  is the only option removing empathy?
