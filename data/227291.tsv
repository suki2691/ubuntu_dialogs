2006-06-04T05:30:00.000Z	keir		is it possible to make ubuntu install lilo rather than grub? iirc i had problems with grub + sata previously
2006-06-04T05:31:00.000Z	keir		!lilo
2006-06-04T05:32:00.000Z	nbx909	keir	try apt-get install lilo
2006-06-04T05:33:00.000Z	keir	nbx909	that's tough because i can't boot my system. i have to do it from the livecd
