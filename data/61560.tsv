2009-03-28T08:48:00.000Z	Jesse_Robinson		i have windows xp media center and for some reason everytime i boot it up i get a blue screen before windows starts rendering my comp useless. I thought my hard drive my be out so i started up a live cd ubuntu 8.04. when i tried to mount my hard drive i got an error saying it couldnt be mounted but ive ran a hard drive diagnostic tool and everything came back ok. what could be wrong?
