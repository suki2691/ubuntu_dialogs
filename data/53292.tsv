2009-07-02T05:58:00.000Z	BitWraith	nathaniel_	log in as a normal user, then use sudo
2009-07-02T05:58:00.000Z	BitWraith		sudo isn't a user, it's a program
2009-07-02T06:00:00.000Z	nathaniel_	BitWraith	... I know it's a program ... ok say i type in sudo apt-get install packagexyz ... it's asks me for the root password. i type it in and then i gives me an authentication error
