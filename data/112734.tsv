2007-11-26T04:19:00.000Z	octete		Hi guys, for a Intel Core 2 Duo, is it better to install the 386 version or the amd64? (I am worried about compatibility issues or lack of some packages for amd64)
2007-11-26T04:20:00.000Z	voraistos	octete	i thought those cpus were 32 bits ?
2007-11-26T04:20:00.000Z	octete	voraistos	well, they support the 64 bit extensions, no?
2007-11-26T04:20:00.000Z	voraistos	octete	if they are 32 bits cpu, 64 bits wont do much :P
