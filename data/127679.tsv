2010-03-10T03:37:00.000Z	Shadowmancer		I am having an issue with the live cd, i can't get it load, i mean like, i can get it to show me all the loading stuff, then the screen goes blank, i can access the virtual terminals with the ctrl+alt+f5 and what not, but not the gui desktop, i've searched the forums, attempted the corrections found on ubuntu.com but can't figure out the issue

2010-03-10T03:39:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Shadowmancer	no, but try safe graphics mode on the first screen
2010-03-10T03:39:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Shadowmancer	I believe F8 brings up the advanced options
