2006-08-17T14:40:00.000Z	alpha232	mneptok	knowing my luck i'll get popcorn
2006-08-17T14:40:00.000Z	mneptok	alpha232	i think i remember seeing an iptables/tarpit walkthrough for Ubuntu somewhere. i've never used it, personally, so i'd have to do a leetle reserach.
2006-08-17T14:41:00.000Z	alpha232	mneptok	 yeah i saw somthing for breezy but nuttin on dapper, tryin to find the walkthrough isn't as easy as one would hope.
