2008-11-04T05:18:00.000Z	spi343		hi all, i am trying to set up my wireless connection in ubuntu 8.10 with the network manager and i have some problems. My card is a senao 2511 CD and i am using host_ap drivers (everything went ok in 8.04). So i go to System->Preferences->Network Configuration, then i go to Wireless i click Add (i set up the connection ) i check "connect automatically" and "system setting" hit OK and wait for a connection but nothing. When i restart
2008-11-04T05:18:00.000Z	spi343		 i notice the wireless card (wlan0 in my case) is not even up by itself, and if a try to manually connect to the AP it won't work either, i mean it connects (wavemon says so) but it doesn't receive any IP with dhclient. AGAIN this only happens with the latest kernel 2.6.27-7, if i start ubuntu with say .. 2.6.19 i can connect to my AP with iwconfing (not with the network manager) HELP
