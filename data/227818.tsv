It's a Dell with a 2.4ghz Celeron, 256MB ram, 80gb hd, 17" monitor....only $299...thing is it comes with windows.  I need to get 20 identical models for $250 each that are as good as or better than this system

2005-07-26T11:59:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	luminerd	 i would definately get that. even with windows.. linux is just a dd away
2005-07-26T12:02:00.000Z	luminerd	Computer__Guru	I can get a better deal.  Dell SUCKS and so does celeron
