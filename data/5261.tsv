2012-05-03T08:24:00.000Z	Vastlee		I've just added a new hard drive. It's already partitioned & formated. How do I get to it in the file manager?
2012-05-03T08:25:00.000Z	L3top	Vastlee	it should just be there... unless something went terribly wrong with the formatting and it cannot be mounted
2012-05-03T08:35:00.000Z	L3top	Vastlee	is there anything on this drive? Are you still viewing it in gparted?
2012-05-03T08:37:00.000Z	L3top	Vastlee	now it should be in file manager
