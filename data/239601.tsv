2007-07-12T09:43:00.000Z	TuxRox		Hello. I am running Evolution 2.10.1 on Ubuntu 7.04. I am using the Exchange plugin for our corporate email. I am seeing something odd that maybe someone here might have a fix or work around for. I had attempted to add my manager's calendar to see how that works, but now I can not get rid of it. If I delete it, the next time I start Evolution it is there again. I went on to a Windows box and removed it from Outlook, yet it still shows up in Evolution. Is
2007-07-12T09:43:00.000Z	TuxRox		 there a place in the .evoultion directory or in GConf that would eliminate that? I have searched high and low to no avail... :-(

2007-07-12T09:46:00.000Z	TuxRox	NigelS	I have. It has been about an hour and no response yet, so I figured I would try here.
