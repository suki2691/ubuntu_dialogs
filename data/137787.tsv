2011-08-11T19:21:00.000Z	Ellipsis753		haha, OK sorry. I'll go look elseware. Wasn't sure if it counted as piracy.
2011-08-11T19:23:00.000Z	Ellipsis753		Even if your just re-recording it or something?
2011-08-11T19:24:00.000Z	llutz	Ellipsis753	even if you re-whistle it. music-mafia has no humour at all
