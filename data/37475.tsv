2010-10-24T00:31:00.000Z	wasutton3_		i am trying to move my working ubuntu installation to a new hard drive (since the old one has lots of bad sectors), what would the best way to go about doing this?
2010-10-24T00:32:00.000Z	Diehard	wasutton3_	image it with ghost
2010-10-24T00:33:00.000Z	wasutton3_	Diehard	are you referring to a specific command or the commercial product norton ghost?
2010-10-24T00:33:00.000Z	Diehard	wasutton3_	I use ghost32 (the very old one) from my bartpe bootable cd
