2007-11-24T18:25:00.000Z	wqwa		hi. im using ubuntu 5.04. Im currently trying to install amsn. (-deb file) . But konsole says that packages like imlibll,sox,docker,tcltls... are not installed
2007-11-24T18:25:00.000Z	Shahar	wqwa	why are you using ubuntu from 2.5 years ago?
2007-11-24T18:26:00.000Z	Shahar	wqwa	if you say so. well, apt-get install all those packages
2007-11-24T18:29:00.000Z	Shahar	wqwa	you can't install that deb file on that version of ubuntu, in that case.
