2005-05-10T15:53:00.000Z	selinium	dataw0lf|w	that is what I am going to use, but i like to know the other options
2005-05-10T15:54:00.000Z	dataw0lf|w	selinium	 well, learn rsync, then find out what exactly you don't like about it, then compare it to the alternatives.
2005-05-10T15:56:00.000Z	selinium	dataw0lf|w	I will get rsync working then. Then have a look at rdiff, Cheers for all your pointers everybody!
