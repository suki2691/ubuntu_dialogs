2005-08-01T15:04:00.000Z	linukso		Hi! Why do I often experience that files that I can play with mplayer, cant be played with totem, even though ffmpeg is installed? (totem-gstreamer and gstreamer-ffmpeg is installed...)
2005-08-01T15:04:00.000Z	jasoncohen	linukso	do you have w32codecs installed?
2005-08-01T15:05:00.000Z	linukso	jasoncohen	why would that help? gstreamer isnt using w32codecs, is it?
2005-08-01T15:05:00.000Z	jasoncohen	linukso	you should use w32codecs + totem-xine
