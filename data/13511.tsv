2011-06-08T01:40:00.000Z	monni-		Hey. I tried looking around on the Ubuntu forums but failed to find a definite answer or fix to my problem. I just burned the Ubuntu 11.04 x64 install iso to a CD, but the installation gets stuck at the *Preparing to install* screen. I am using the Live CD function of the CD, so the CD does work, at least to some degree. Any ideas on what could be wrong?

2011-06-08T01:43:00.000Z	monni-	proSI	ah, okay. Ive used multiple Ubuntu versions before, and they have all worked
