2012-08-28T10:23:00.000Z	h22turbo	Bram_P	looks like a problem with ur video card? its not working with the nouveau kernel module.....
2012-08-28T10:25:00.000Z	Bram_P	h22turbo	that's possible indeed. KM0201, I'm installing 12.04
2012-08-28T10:26:00.000Z	h22turbo	Bram_P	you can disable nouveau during boot... and use something else so it will boot up properly
