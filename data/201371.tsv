2006-03-12T08:51:00.000Z	Yango		I have a weird non constant problem upon shutdown,,, it sometimes powers off with no trouble from the X session, but some other times the X session kills the menu and stops there the shutdown process, I havfe to switch to a console and then manually do shutdown -h now and now it doesn't turn off the computer, it just gets to system halted and have to manually turn it off... what can be a cause for this?
