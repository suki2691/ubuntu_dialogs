2009-05-26T18:28:00.000Z	Halitech	heguru	not sure as I don't have any so can't test
2009-05-26T18:29:00.000Z	heguru	Halitech	the w64codecs are as of now incomplete, the only way to play most hd content on 64-bit is to purchase a commercial codecs from fluendo
2009-05-26T18:30:00.000Z	Halitech	heguru	I'll take your word on that, they are working fine on my system for what I use
