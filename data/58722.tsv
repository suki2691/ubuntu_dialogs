2009-05-21T19:08:00.000Z	neil_d		I am having trouble accessing a new pendrive. It shows up in the Places, but when I click on it I get "Cannot mount volume" "Error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.AccessDenied"  what does this mean?  How do I fix it?
2009-05-21T19:09:00.000Z	eurythmia	neil_d	have you googled that error? I can't remember offhand, but it's a permissions error, you need to add yourself to a group and relogin, then the error will cease.

2009-05-21T19:11:00.000Z	neil_d	eurythmia	I will look.
