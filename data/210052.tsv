2006-01-07T13:18:00.000Z	DaveRag		Hi everyone. I have a webserver set up on Ubuntu 5.10, none of my websites seem to be able to make Xmlhttprequest calls. Is there something extra I need to add in Apache?
2006-01-07T13:19:00.000Z	amias	DaveRag	a handler of some kind , what are the calls going to ?
2006-01-07T13:20:00.000Z	DaveRag	amias	it's the livesearch function on the k2 theme for wordpress
2006-01-07T13:23:00.000Z	amias	DaveRag	so is the handler failing
