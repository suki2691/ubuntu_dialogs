2012-04-13T02:14:00.000Z	Shinka		I'm looking for a good wireless router. I know absolutely nothing about networks: is there a better/worst kind for Linux or, as I suspect, it doesn't matter (it's the wireless card of my laptop that matters)?
2012-04-13T02:16:00.000Z	scientes	Shinka	does matter the slightest
2012-04-13T02:16:00.000Z	scientes	Shinka	all that matters is the wireless card (stay away from broadcom)
2012-04-13T02:16:00.000Z	Shinka	scientes	OK!
