2008-11-14T09:42:00.000Z	Luisa	Dulak	 compared to Debian unstable? Hm
2008-11-14T09:45:00.000Z	Luisa	Dulak	 ... :/  Sorry, that confused me ;p Debian does not have fixed releases, they "release" when it's ready. Unstable is supposed to be unstable all the time. When it is stable, then it is on the Stable, not Unstable.. Mmm...
2008-11-14T09:49:00.000Z	Luisa	Dulak	Well, I wanted to use Debian sid anyway ^_~
