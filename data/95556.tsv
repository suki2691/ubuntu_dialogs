I only ask because I've had machines with windows thats wouldn't pick up certain routers because they were broadcasting on a channel that windows/wifi driver wouldn't accept in the uk

2011-04-18T20:55:00.000Z	DJones	sancas	No worries, I just thought it was worth mentioning as a "just in case idea"
2011-04-18T20:57:00.000Z	DJones	sancas	Sorry, I have no idea either
