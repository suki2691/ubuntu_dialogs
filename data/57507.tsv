2010-10-27T21:15:00.000Z	RoughNeck		How do I take the Ubuntu on my laptop and create a mirror image of it on my desktop? With out losing, files-settings-tweaks-apps-everything. As I have spent a lot of time putting together the perfect working environment for me, now I need to have the exact same on my tower. I have tried Clonezilla, but my computer shuts down half way through, I tried Partimage, but no luck there either. Please Help.........
