2006-06-04T09:14:00.000Z	znh		Hello. I'd like to have amarok in my ubuntu Dapper installation. But it refuses to play any MP3's. Other pages tell me to instal llibxine-extracodecs. but it does not even exist :)
2006-06-04T09:15:00.000Z	BrianHH	znh	 Try installing xmms.  That worked for me.
2006-06-04T09:15:00.000Z	znh	BrianHH	, I have XMMS
2006-06-04T09:16:00.000Z	BrianHH	znh	Odd.  Just having xmms worked for me.  I couldn't get rhythmbox to work.
