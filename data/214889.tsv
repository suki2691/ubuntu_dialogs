2007-07-10T05:54:00.000Z	kbrosnan	NigelS	the main thing numus needs to do is switch from java 1.5.x in the path to java 6 a command like sudo ln -s /path/to/java /usr/local/bin should fix the problem
2007-07-10T05:54:00.000Z	NigelS	kbrosnan	but that ought to happen anyway with installing the java6 packages surely?
2007-07-10T05:54:00.000Z	kbrosnan	NigelS	java -version returns java 1.5.x for him
2007-07-10T05:54:00.000Z	NigelS	kbrosnan	then he hasn;t, as he claimed installed them properly or run the update-alternatives program correctly
