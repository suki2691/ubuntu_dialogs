2011-07-29T00:13:00.000Z	BBgamer		Does anyone know a screenshot application for Ubuntu that doesn't suck. I've tried Shutter, and the default GNOME screenshot tool doesn't cut it.
2011-07-29T00:13:00.000Z	ikonia	BBgamer	in what way doesn't cut it
2011-07-29T00:14:00.000Z	BBgamer	ikonia	It's just so... slow. On Windows, there's an application when I can press print screen and it uploads directly to imgur and gives me a popup with the link.
