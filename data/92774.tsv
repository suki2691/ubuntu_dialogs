2008-08-04T20:24:00.000Z	zxxd		soundf_, between the releases only security updates are released no new packages to the current stable ?
2008-08-04T20:26:00.000Z	fde	zxxd	depends... there is -updates and -security for each release... but there is also -backports and -proposed ... backports and proposed are places for new software, the others are security and bugfixes only
2008-08-04T20:27:00.000Z	fde	zxxd	-proposed is likely to break things for you, so isn't recommended.
