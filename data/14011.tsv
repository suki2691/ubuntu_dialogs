2011-05-23T06:50:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jtreminio	apt will handle that, they're (the executables) installed in /usr/bin
2011-05-23T06:50:00.000Z	jtreminio	aeon-ltd	I meant for programs that don't come with apt, like my IDE phpstorm ... but I'll stick it in there I guess!
2011-05-23T06:51:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jtreminio	it doesn't matter where that is as long as it's executable by the users you use it with, i'd create a shortcut for a launcher anyway
