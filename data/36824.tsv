2010-02-23T03:40:00.000Z	Aedrich		how do I get terminal to remember my aliases beyond when I exit the terminal window I put them in?
2010-02-23T03:40:00.000Z	Typos_King	Aedrich	   add them to your ~/bashrc file
2010-02-23T03:44:00.000Z	Typos_King	Aedrich	    after added to them, they get into effect after your restart either the X server or the console
2010-02-23T03:44:00.000Z	Aedrich	Typos_King	I've restarted the entire system since adding them
