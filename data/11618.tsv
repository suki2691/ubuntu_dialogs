I have put ubuntu server on my usb using unetbootin. but the usb's boot menu is converted to unetbootin's standard one and i can't install server using minimal mode setting. how do i do it if i could edit boot parameters? in short: what is boot parameter to go to minimal server install?

2011-07-29T13:40:00.000Z	g33p	fmauro	alright but since i have already done it, (can't copy all that again to my slow usb) can i get to minimal install by editing boot params?
