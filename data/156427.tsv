2008-08-12T08:04:00.000Z	Erika		I have an Asus Terminator C3 I built recently for giggles... what a limp wristed cpu! Tried installing xubuntu 8.04.1 and it ran ok, but when I used terminal to install multimedia codecs it tossed a user agreement for jre at me that wouldn't let me respond. I'm stuck with a dpkg issue. I wiped it and stuck puppy in to get here. Any advice?
