2008-08-13T08:50:00.000Z	fallore		i got a terminal open by hitting alt + f1 and navigating through the menu. now i just need to figure out what to change in my xorg.conf seeing as i accidentally pasted over the default mouse section
2008-08-13T08:50:00.000Z	fallore		hmm, my xorg.conf seems to be completely blank. wouldn't that make my keyboard stop working too?
