2005-07-08T06:14:00.000Z	mopflite		my questions is, I have lost my original installation cd and I would as a result like to reconfigure apt so that all software is now obtained from the net, and yet the cd-rom drive doesn't appear as a source in /etc/apt/sources.list - any idea how I can tell the system that the net should be used for all software installations from now on?
