2010-03-22T02:50:00.000Z	Tom22		My GNOME seems to have vanished, so has my menu to choose what session to use, instead it puts me onto XTERM. Can anyone help?
2010-03-22T02:51:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	Tom22	try "startx"
2010-03-22T02:51:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty		enter that into the terminal
2010-03-22T02:52:00.000Z	Tom22	shazbotmcnasty	hey, I've tried that, I've also tried recovery mode, logging in with terminal, "repairing broken packages", etc...
