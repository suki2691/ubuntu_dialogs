2010-09-16T09:00:00.000Z	Theaxiom		I am trying to setup dual screens on an nvidia 8800gtx and I save the changes to xorg.conf but it keeps saving the screens in the incorrect order.
2010-09-16T09:01:00.000Z	Theaxiom		I set absolute position on the other monitor, and set the secondary one I want to be to the right of screen 1 but it keeps reverting to the other way
2010-09-16T09:01:00.000Z	gnoobuntu	Theaxiom	try dragging the other monitor to the other side
2010-09-16T09:02:00.000Z	Theaxiom	gnoobuntu	I will try that, thanks
