2012-11-09T17:24:00.000Z	_cronus_	savio	if i remember correctly servers register with rpc bind with the address they are listening and then when a client wants to communicate with the server, it asks rpcbind for its address
2012-11-09T17:25:00.000Z	_cronus_	savio	so servers don't have to listen to well know ports
