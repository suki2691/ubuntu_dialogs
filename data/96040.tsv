2010-05-07T14:48:00.000Z	Dayea		Hi everyone, I am on Ubuntu 10.04 and I have a weird sound problem. At the beginning everything was fine but now I only hear my LineIn: no sound with aplay or vlc
2010-05-07T14:48:00.000Z	Dayea		I've tryed to play with alsamixer to unmute everything and put sound at the max but that doesn't solve the problem
2010-05-07T14:48:00.000Z	geekphreak	Dayea	headphones?
2010-05-07T14:49:00.000Z	geekphreak	Dayea	are they plugged right?
