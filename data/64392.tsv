2009-03-06T06:11:00.000Z	Ish		Hey my tech savvy friends.  I just need one thing.  What's the quickest easiest FTP sever to install?  All i need, is a single user to be able to upload files to a single directory.  Security really isn't an issue (i know that sounds horrible, but i need this kinda quick, so the more complicated it gets, the worse)  I just need it to accept files from either anonymous or a user i create.  VSFTPD's conf file didn't leave me very happy. Any suggestions?
