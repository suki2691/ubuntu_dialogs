2008-07-19T09:02:00.000Z	fr05tbyt3		hello all, i was wondering if it is possible to run two different desktop enviroments on two different monitors on one computer
2008-07-19T09:03:00.000Z	fr05tbyt3		so each monitor has their own virtual desktops and whatnot
2008-07-19T09:03:00.000Z	fr05tbyt3		two different xservers?
2008-07-19T09:03:00.000Z	zcat[1]	fr05tbyt3	should be. probably tricky to set up though
