2008-05-02T01:43:00.000Z	sas171		Hi, I have a problem with the keyboard layouts. I have 2 layouts: German and Russian, after a reboot I'm not able to switch to the Russian layout anymore... I tried to find a solution in the forums, but had no success.

2008-05-02T01:47:00.000Z	sas171	fde	actually, everything works until I do a full reboot (logout/in no problem). After that am not able to switch the layout with keyboard shortcut, only per panel applet, but when I select Russian I get only some strange symbols while typing. To fix it I can go to the keyboard preferences, reset ti defaults and add the Russian layout again, but it works only until I reboot my PC
2008-05-02T01:51:00.000Z	sas171	fde	any ideas?
