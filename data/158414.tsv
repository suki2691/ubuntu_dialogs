2008-02-08T04:04:00.000Z	KenSentMe		How can you fix the crashed install of a deb package? Apt tells me to reinstall it but the archive isn't available. I can't get apt to install anything right now. How can i get out of this?
2008-02-08T04:05:00.000Z	Slart	KenSentMe	can't you uninstall the package that is giving you problems?
2008-02-08T04:05:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Slart	apt or synaptic doesn't start
2008-02-08T04:06:00.000Z	Slart	KenSentMe	what happens when you run "sudo apt-get install" ?
