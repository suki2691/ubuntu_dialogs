But it alls comes down to that if grub points on uuid it dosent work. gives error waiting for root disk. When I set fstab and grub to boot /dev/sda1 it works. I can mount. But the problem is that this only works when I dont have my storage disks in becouse when I plug them in my system disk change /dev/xxx every reboot.
