2009-09-16T19:40:00.000Z	haytham-med		rm /home/user/.compiz
2009-09-16T19:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	haytham-med	 see if theres a .compiz directory. the settings may not be in there.  the #compiz channel will proberly know exactly where the settings are at.
2009-09-16T19:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	haytham-med	 and looking in that diorectory shows just a 'session'  dir/file here..  thats not all the settings I imagine
