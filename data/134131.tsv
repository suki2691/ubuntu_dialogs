2007-10-26T05:45:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	kkathman	Well, my theme is a custom mix of the default ones... don't know if that makes any difference though
2007-10-26T05:46:00.000Z	kkathman	d4rkmonkey	 well in previous releases, compiz came with a couple of dozen premade themes
2007-10-26T05:46:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	kkathman	alright, I think I'm thinking of something different then
