2007-03-18T10:34:00.000Z	arrenlex	dougie	apt-cache search <keywords>
2007-03-18T10:35:00.000Z	arrenlex	dougie	what montyp suggests searches only for packages whose names match keyword. My command searches for packages whose descriptions match keyword.
2007-03-18T10:36:00.000Z	arrenlex	dougie	Oh... I think they're referring to the fact that aptitude search formats its results into columns. But you get less results.
