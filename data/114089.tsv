2007-11-07T17:27:00.000Z	stippi		I have a problem with my new monitor and 7.10. In X, the screen is all garbled, in the textmode terminals, only a portion of the text is displayed and I can't fix the xorg.conf file for my new monitor. Is there any trick how I can tricker the autodetection again, possible get a clean xorg.conf file?
