2008-07-25T03:22:00.000Z	sammino		i need advise on a certain setup: I have a p4 3.2ghz machine that I want to run ubuntu.. it only has 1gb of ram..  now i want to run vmware on it..   so my question is how much swap should i setup to make vmware as good as possible?
2008-07-25T03:24:00.000Z	sammino		so i should make 2gb of swap since i have 1gb of physical ram?
2008-07-25T03:25:00.000Z	sammino		how difficult is it to change the swap after installation?
2008-07-25T03:25:00.000Z	KenBW2	sammino	very easy
