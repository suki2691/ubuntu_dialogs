2005-04-25T05:28:00.000Z	cfh_dev		I just installed Ubuntu 5.04 but I don't remember it asking me to set the root password.  Is there a default password for root?
2005-04-25T05:29:00.000Z	cfh_dev		So is there no way to su to root?
2005-04-25T05:29:00.000Z	ResNet|Eric	cfh_dev	sudo su :)
2005-04-25T05:29:00.000Z	ResNet|Eric	cfh_dev	gives you # prompt IIRC
