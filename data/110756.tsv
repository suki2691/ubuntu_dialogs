2008-04-06T12:32:00.000Z	DOOM_NX	zcat[1]	shouldn't he use the 64bit version?
2008-04-06T12:32:00.000Z	zcat[1]	DOOM_NX	perhaps.. but if he's not sure i386 will work on both.. 64 bit won't work on 32bit cpu's..
2008-04-06T12:35:00.000Z	zcat[1]	DOOM_NX	32 bit will run just fine on a 64bit machine, you just miss out on some potential performance gains..
