2006-03-06T08:44:00.000Z	LjL	newbie	err, unless you did something quite messed up while installing ubuntu, you should *not* be using startx to start gnome
2006-03-06T08:45:00.000Z	newbie	LjL	i got an error msg on my screen
2006-03-06T08:46:00.000Z	LjL	newbie	if X is not running, "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start" should get it going, unless something is wrong with your setup
