2011-12-04T05:22:00.000Z	maestrojed		I added nfs-kernel-server via Synaptic Package Manager. But I try to start it with "/etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server start" but I get command not found. How do I run it.
2011-12-04T05:23:00.000Z	Tynach	maestrojed	I don't know for sure, but it might be "sudo service nfs start".
2011-12-04T05:23:00.000Z	Tynach		Yeah, I WANT to do a clean install, but I have no place to back up my data to.
2011-12-04T05:23:00.000Z	maestrojed	Tynach	unrecognized service :(
