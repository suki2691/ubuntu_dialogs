2012-01-19T22:58:00.000Z	javier_faj		Hi! I installed in "ubuntu software center" a program called MrBayes. It uses a text file (.nxs) which in windows version must be placed in the folder where MrBayes files are. How can I do that in ubuntu? Where are my Mr.Bayes files and folders? Where can I place my text file so it can be used by the program? Thanks for any suggestion!

2012-01-19T23:01:00.000Z	javier_faj	zykotick9	thanks for your suggestion. There is no mrbayes folder in /home (I think there is where you meant), neither in .config. Hope someone else has another suggestion!
