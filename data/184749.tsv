2006-07-06T12:35:00.000Z	Sub	yanis	the alt. is just a text based installer, the server install is just for servers, no desktop install.
2006-07-06T12:36:00.000Z	yanis	Sub	when you say 'no desktop install' you mean no Xserver,right?
2006-07-06T12:36:00.000Z	Sub	yanis	yes and also none of the desktop apps.
