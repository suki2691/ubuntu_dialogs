2010-06-15T06:01:00.000Z	Tao		I'm having trouble with WINE. I'm trying to install Star Wars: Empire at War, which has two CDs. The first CD started up and ran perfectly, but when it came time for the second CD, I put it in, but WINE couldn't find it. Any help?

2010-06-15T06:03:00.000Z	Tao	acerimmer	What do you mean? Copying the image from the second CD into the .wine folder?
2010-06-15T06:04:00.000Z	acerimmer_	Tao	personally I'd do both and then direct the path to those discs
