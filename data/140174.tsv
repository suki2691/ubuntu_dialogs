2007-08-05T12:33:00.000Z	Jaikkanen		i cannot move files into my .wine directories.. even when trying to use terminal commands with root permission.. it says the directory is invalid.. is using _ instead of space incorrect?
2007-08-05T12:33:00.000Z	Jaikkanen		for example Program_Files
2007-08-05T12:34:00.000Z	nextse7en	Jaikkanen	use a backslash before the space
2007-08-05T12:34:00.000Z	Jaikkanen	nextse7en	before or instead? just to confirm
