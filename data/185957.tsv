2006-05-19T06:04:00.000Z	phanter		hello there. I am trying to install GLX on my Dapper (ATI 9200 mobile; IBM T42 laptop). I am following the guide that is on the Ubuntuforum.org, but it does not work as described. Who is willing to help me?
2006-05-19T06:05:00.000Z	snowfaked	phanter	i think i didn't have to do anything except change driver from xorg.conf from ati to fglrx
2006-05-19T06:05:00.000Z	phanter		The forum tells me: "Start gconf-editor and go to "apps/compiz/general/all screens/options"", but there is no section "apps/compiz" in gconf
2006-05-19T06:06:00.000Z	phanter	snowfaked	I always use the fglrx driver, but there is some other strange problem
