2008-11-03T18:44:00.000Z	mwob	dr_willis	Thanks. How do I start Ubuntu without it loading "X", so I can VIM that file?
2008-11-03T18:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	mwob	 you can edit it from X if you wanted.. or just go to the console with alt-ctrl-f1
2008-11-03T18:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	mwob	 or kill the gdm/kdm service
2008-11-03T18:45:00.000Z	mwob	dr_willis	Thats the prob, I can't get to X :) Because it hangs. I'll try the alt-ctrl-f1 thing though
