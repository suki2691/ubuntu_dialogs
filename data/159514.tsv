2006-12-08T07:41:00.000Z	bariel		hello, if i want to set up only a webserver and no other service, do you guys see any necessity using a firewall?
2006-12-08T07:42:00.000Z	MarcN	bariel	make sure that only ports 80, 443 and 22 are allowed in.
2006-12-08T07:43:00.000Z	bariel	MarcN	i will close anything besides 80/443, is it safe for me without firewall?
2006-12-08T07:45:00.000Z	bariel	MarcN	you stil there?
