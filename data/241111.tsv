2010-10-10T20:06:00.000Z	geckopunk		I'm trying to download Eartworm's wp_tray from http://wildbill.nulldevice.net/ubuntu/wp-tray_0.4.6-1_i386.deb
2010-10-10T20:06:00.000Z	geckopunk		my konsole says that Package libgnutls11 is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2010-10-10T20:07:00.000Z	geckopunk		does anyone know of the pkg that replaces libgnutls11?
2010-10-10T20:07:00.000Z	penguin42	geckopunk	libgnutls26 ?
