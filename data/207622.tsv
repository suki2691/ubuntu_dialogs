2008-04-28T03:34:00.000Z	philip_		I'm looking for the 2.6.25 kernel deb. Anyone know where I can get it? Still looking
2008-04-28T03:34:00.000Z	smallfoot-	philip_	i wonder too
2008-04-28T03:35:00.000Z	philip_	smallfoot-	2.6.25 should've been included in my opinion since it added a ton of driver support
2008-04-28T03:36:00.000Z	smallfoot-	philip_	yeah, i want it too
