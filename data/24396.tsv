2011-01-09T07:58:00.000Z	CrossKel		OK, I had something happen, I think with Firefox but I'm not certain, and my system, Ubuntu 10.04, crashed. When I restarted, it no longer permits me to enter the gui, and any time I try to do much of anything I get an error with shared libraries and libatk-1.0.so.0 having an invalid ELF header. When trying to reinstall it, however, apt-get and aptitude both say there is no such file available.
2011-01-09T07:59:00.000Z	CrossKel		Is there a way to reinstall the libatk-1.0.so.0 file without having to completely reinstall?
2011-01-09T08:01:00.000Z	rusty149	CrossKel	Do you mean libatk1.0.so.0?
2011-01-09T08:02:00.000Z	CrossKel	rusty149	Yes. That is the file I'm having issues with.
