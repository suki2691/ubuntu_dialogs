2009-07-20T19:16:00.000Z	Threetimes	indus	I agree, the ubuntu-nl channel is usually empty and dead and boring, so i'm here.
2009-07-20T19:17:00.000Z	indus	Threetimes	ya all these sub-channels are useless,unless someone is looking for language help, and that too i feel can be helped in pm by some user here
2009-07-20T19:17:00.000Z	indus	Threetimes	like some guy from nether wants help, you can help him in pm anyways
