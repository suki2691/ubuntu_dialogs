2011-04-24T13:58:00.000Z	kaatta		so anyone recommend a distro for my eee pc 701sd? LF power + speed. xubuntu freezes too much, ubuntu netbook does also. 10.10 desktop is sluggish but stable. puppy feels week. slytaz is awesome but doesnt pick up my wireless and feels complicated
2011-04-24T13:58:00.000Z	bazhang	kaatta	this is ubuntu only support. for general linux try ##linux
2011-04-24T13:59:00.000Z	kaatta	bazhang	my issue was resolved, now LF oppinion sorry. ubuntu is my favorite, was hoping someone here could relate me an ubuntu remix/similar distro that will run well on older machine
