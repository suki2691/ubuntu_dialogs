2008-11-23T06:00:00.000Z	csilk	praveen	that's just a warning about and old funciton being used in the sourcecode, it should still compile
2008-11-23T06:02:00.000Z	praveen	csilk	i have installed a packaged called indri on Ubuntu 8.04 but now in Ubuntu 8.10 it doesn't work ...... the config runs fine but the make gives error any suggestions ??
2008-11-23T06:03:00.000Z	csilk	praveen	could eb one of many reasons, you need to file a bug report so we can look at it and fix it
