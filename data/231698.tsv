2006-06-17T06:39:00.000Z	bigfoot1		I am running aptiude for the 1st time in a long time and it says the following packages have been held back: desktop-file-utils gdm gtk2-engines-pixbuf libgnomevfs2-0 libgnomevfs2-bin libgnomevfs2-common   libgnomevfs2-dev libgnomevfs2-extra libgtk2.0-0 libgtk2.0-bin libgtk2.0-common libgtk2.0-dev. Is this a problem? why are they being held back?
2006-06-17T06:39:00.000Z	neuro_	bigfoot1	sounds like you need to do an apt-get dist-upgrade to me
2006-06-17T06:40:00.000Z	bigfoot1	neuro_	ok
2006-06-17T06:42:00.000Z	bigfoot1	neuro_	thanks.  apt-get dist-upgrade is insalling them now
