2006-08-16T08:45:00.000Z	Maister_Ben		Hi everyone, first time linux/ubuntu user here and was wondering since everything seems to be working just fine in ubuntu... do i have to install drivers for my hardware or did it install itself ?

2006-08-16T08:46:00.000Z	longwave	Maister_Ben	also some wireless chipsets need extra drivers before they will run, but apart from that most things work out of the box
2006-08-16T08:48:00.000Z	longwave	Maister_Ben	mp3 cannot be included directly in ubuntu due to licensing issues, read the restricted formats page that ubotu just linked to
