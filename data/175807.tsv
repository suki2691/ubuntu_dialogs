2006-07-04T15:23:00.000Z	andyjeffries		Where can I find out about upcoming package version bumps?  I need a feature in PHP 5.1.3, but Ubuntu is currently on 5.1.2.  Is there an online database of packages, current live version, testing version and progress?

2006-07-04T15:24:00.000Z	andyjeffries	SpeesKeek	Purely because I'm new to Ubuntu (previous Red Hat, then Gentoo user) and I'm trying to keep my system clean (only using .debs etc).
