2008-08-14T05:26:00.000Z	Beta-guy	IndyGunFreak	I don't want to restart X, I want to return Gnome to it's default settings, I can load failsafe gnome, but not Gnome.
2008-08-14T05:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Beta-guy	oh ok, i'm sorry, misunderstood your problem.. i believe there's a way to do that, but i'm not sure how.
