2010-11-09T12:19:00.000Z	dhruba		I have setup a Hypervisor with KVM on CentOS. Over that I have created 3 Ubuntu 10.04 Virtual Servers and 1 Windows 2003 Server. How can I access a Pen drive from within the Ubuntu Servers? Host is detecting the media but not the guest.
2010-11-09T12:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dhruba	does hypervisor allow folder sharing to guests?
2010-11-09T12:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dhruba	ask in ##windows hypervisor is a windows app
