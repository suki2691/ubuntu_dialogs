2009-04-29T22:05:00.000Z	JackSmith23		I have Ubuntu 8.10 installed now... I'm trying to install 9.04. The installer is asking me where to put 9.04... Do I want it to delete 8.10? (I don't want it to delete all my personal files though...) ?
2009-04-29T22:06:00.000Z	gartral1	JackSmith23	you have an alternate cd?
2009-04-29T22:06:00.000Z	JackSmith23	gartral1	I'm using the regular cd, but have the alt one downloaded, why? (I'm just trying to do an upgrade - I don't want all the files killed on the partition)
