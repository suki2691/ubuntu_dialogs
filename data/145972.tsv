2007-02-12T14:54:00.000Z	SanguineAnomaly		is there any way of preventing apt from automatically upgrading my kernel/
2007-02-12T14:54:00.000Z	Arphetic	SanguineAnomaly	It wont upgrade the kernel, maybe update I think
2007-02-12T14:54:00.000Z	Arphetic		but do you mean like... upgrading -> Edgy or just to latest kernel version?
2007-02-12T14:55:00.000Z	SanguineAnomaly	Arphetic	same thing really - i don't want it to do anything with my kernel, because it breaks it XD
