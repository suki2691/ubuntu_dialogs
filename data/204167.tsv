2009-03-01T03:49:00.000Z	Plugh		I finally figured out how to get Ubuntu 6.06 booting reliably with my new computer. The auto notification thing is telling me that 8.0.4.1 is available. How safe is it for me to jump from 6.06 to 8.04.1?

2009-03-01T03:49:00.000Z	Plugh		I can (and will) backup the 6.06 partition before attempting the update. Last time I tried it, it didn't go so well but I had to do part of it manually.
