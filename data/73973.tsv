2008-11-19T08:22:00.000Z	gaelfx	sinuc	I'm pretty sure you have to specify versions
2008-11-19T08:23:00.000Z	gaelfx	sinuc	it's part of the name of the package it looks for, besides, it's dangerous not to because there is  no guarantee that the newest package will have the same order as previous ones
