2007-02-23T11:21:00.000Z	EdibleEgg	jrib	how would i get it from the cd?
2007-02-23T11:21:00.000Z	jrib	EdibleEgg	put the cd in your drive, it should prompt you to add the cd to apt's repository list
2007-02-23T11:22:00.000Z	EdibleEgg	jrib	ok, i'll try it, kinda weird that it wouldnt put it on there at install though
