2009-05-10T13:17:00.000Z	Draco_1		(ok, I try for the third and last time )  I have problems installing ubuntu on an old laptop ( 600Mhz, 160mb of ram, no dvd, cdrom only ), I tryed the alternate install as well but it doesn't install ( says it can't find an adaguate kernel to install ), I've heard there is a version installable from USB, where can I find it? or is there another easy to use linux distribution I can try to install?
