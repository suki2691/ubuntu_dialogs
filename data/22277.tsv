2011-01-28T00:07:00.000Z	bonjoyee	tripelb	right click >properties>openwith tab
2011-01-28T00:10:00.000Z	tripelb	bonjoyee	(first I double check the slight differences from what I was doing and..) oh YES you are so right. Now I have another question: when I put a flashdrive with photos on my system I get a dialog box asking me what program to use. I want to add PICASA to the list of choices. How can I do that?
