2006-03-10T08:54:00.000Z	iG-Shoot-Me		Im thinking of installing ubuntu on my computer..  I already have a free partition... If something goes wrong and fucks up, is there a chance my files get deleted?

2006-03-10T08:55:00.000Z	iG-Shoot-Me	directhex	So I only need 1 partition?
2006-03-10T08:55:00.000Z	directhex	iG-Shoot-Me	as many as you feel like, really. i tend to have a small (50mb) /boot, a swap partition, then either one large / or ~10gb for / and the rest for /home
