2008-04-16T12:37:00.000Z	cpk1	kraypius	if you want something like webmin look into ebox which is what ubuntu is replacing webmin with
2008-04-16T12:41:00.000Z	cpk1	kraypius	you would be much better off grabbing a .deb for ubuntu or finding a repo for ubuntu, or just compiling. that repo you have might work, might not, might cause problems
2008-04-16T12:41:00.000Z	cpk1	kraypius	like I said it might be worth looking into ebox which *is* in the repos, both webmin and ebox seem easy to use/learn
