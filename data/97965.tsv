2008-04-08T18:28:00.000Z	Nasra		I am new to Gutsy Gibbon  ( Ubuntu 7.10 )...which I like very much at first sight....but I am having a problem I don't know how to save a file int /home and then be able to view / find it .....can you help me please?
2008-04-08T18:29:00.000Z	mewt	Nasra	you don't normally save files in /home, usually you save them in /home/username
2008-04-08T18:30:00.000Z	Nasra	mewt	yes so you go /home/xxxxx whatever you have in there.....and then just click it right?
2008-04-08T18:32:00.000Z	mewt	Nasra	they dont necessarily go in there by default, like in windows you can create folders and files in your My documents, you can create files and folder in your home directory which is /home/<username>
