2007-05-22T14:03:00.000Z	bytee		I run Feisty Fawn, and I'm wondering how I can install Seamonkey? a simple apt-cache search shows nothing... is it renamed to something else? (this is Mozilla Seamonkey I'm referring to)

2007-05-22T14:04:00.000Z	bytee	Enverex	is there a reason why this is the case? Lack of a maintainer or some other reason?
2007-05-22T14:10:00.000Z	Enverex	bytee	No idea
