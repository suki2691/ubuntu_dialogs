2011-01-31T02:47:00.000Z	jrib	Burzmali	isn't /cdrom what you want?
2011-01-31T02:48:00.000Z	Burzmali	jrib	Nothing every mounts there, only in a subfolder of /media
2011-01-31T02:48:00.000Z	jrib	Burzmali	I see.  I guess you have to mess with udev scripts.  My *guess* is: /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-cd.rules
