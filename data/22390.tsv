2011-04-06T02:31:00.000Z	geekbri		is it possible to set a job to run every 4.5 hours?
2011-04-06T02:33:00.000Z	geekbri		yeah sorry, my question was poorly worded... what i should have said is, i want to run a job every 4 hours on the half hour. so like 4:30am, 8:30am, etc etc.  I suspect that is 30 */4 * * *  but i dont know if that is correct.  Can anybody confirm?
