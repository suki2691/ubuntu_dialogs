2010-08-30T08:36:00.000Z	bullgard4	pie_time	What is a »video thumbnail«?
2010-08-30T08:37:00.000Z	pie_time	bullgard4	it is a picture of a frame of the video that is used as an icon for the video instead of some generic icon of a video
2010-08-30T08:39:00.000Z	bullgard4	pie_time	Ok. But I do not know the answer to your question.
