2006-06-27T10:31:00.000Z	sjoerd	Exussum	how did you measure that ?
2006-06-27T10:31:00.000Z	Exussum	sjoerd	- CPU frequency scaling monitor says 50%
2006-06-27T10:33:00.000Z	sjoerd	Exussum	that just means your cpu is scaled to 50% because that's enough for the resources your using.. It should go to 100% if your run something very demanding
