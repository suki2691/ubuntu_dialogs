2007-01-07T08:49:00.000Z	asdfjkahsdfjkha	linuxgoober	try cedega, it seems to be the best for linux gaming
2007-01-07T08:50:00.000Z	linuxgoober	asdfjkahsdfjkha	: i have it, but theres no point in using it for games that run natively
2007-01-07T08:56:00.000Z	asdfjkahsdfjkha	linuxgoober	isnt cedega the new versions of winex ?
