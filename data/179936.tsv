2010-09-17T01:01:00.000Z	fedora_newb		can anyone recommend a good editor? I work with php, xhtml, css, that sort of stuff and would like to get one with syntax highlighting
2010-09-17T01:01:00.000Z	jrib	fedora_newb	the default one, gedit, does that
2010-09-18T21:14:00.000Z	jrib	fedora_newb	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent has some advice
2010-09-21T00:25:00.000Z	jrib	fedora_newb	seriously text editing is not an area linux is lacking :)
