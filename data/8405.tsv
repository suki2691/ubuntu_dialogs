2011-10-23T21:03:00.000Z	NickV136		that might be something to try thanks.
2011-10-23T21:03:00.000Z	NickV136		but for now, my ram only really gets nailed by firefox, and I dnt trust chromium, and opera doesnt work
2011-10-23T21:05:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	NickV136	chromium works fine, faster than FF
2011-10-23T21:07:00.000Z	NickV136	MonkeyDust	yea its much faster, but I really dont trust it, I like my cloud as small as possible
