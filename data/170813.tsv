2007-04-07T11:45:00.000Z	zeroflag		how advanced is NTFS access with ubuntu 7.04? can I read/write properly without (too much) danger and ridiculously slow speeds?

2007-04-07T11:45:00.000Z	zeroflag	Tomcat_	how about write?
2007-04-07T11:45:00.000Z	Tomcat_	zeroflag	I hope somebody else will answer that... ntfs-3g is quite good these days, but I can't really say.
