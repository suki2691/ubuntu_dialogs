2012-11-06T20:42:00.000Z	stealz		I installed xmonad with Ubuntu 12.04, but for some reason the panel on the left with the icons doesnt show up, only the one on top. anyone has any ideas?
2012-11-06T20:42:00.000Z	NewWorld	stealz	 better ask on #xmonad
2012-11-06T20:42:00.000Z	stealz	NewWorld	I am trying, no answer there either, but thanks
