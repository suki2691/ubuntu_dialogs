2009-06-11T05:12:00.000Z	cabrey	jmk6f4	you removed it without trying it?
2009-06-11T05:13:00.000Z	cabrey	jmk6f4	no wonder you might have problems... pulseaudio is a rather large component of audio in ubuntu
2009-06-11T05:13:00.000Z	jmk6f4	cabrey	I had issues with games not working correctly with it, removing it fixed the games, but now for some reason my music has changed.
