2010-10-10T15:49:00.000Z	rcsheets	akashv	i'm successfully downloading using utorrent from my desktop at home, but getting that error from a server out in the internets.
2010-10-10T15:49:00.000Z	rcsheets	akashv	i wonder if it could be a tracker load thing
2010-10-10T15:51:00.000Z	akashv	rcsheets	the http download is working, p2p isn't..... whats the use of p2p if the tracker also overloads?
