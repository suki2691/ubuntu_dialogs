2010-05-11T22:04:00.000Z	lubuntu-user		Hey, I installed ubuntu, and then afterwards installed lubuntu-desktop. Im having serious troubles. Hard disks dont mount, I cant see the flash disk I just plugged in, and I cant seem to get automatic login to work. If automatic login works, it logs into the gnome desktop. Please help!
