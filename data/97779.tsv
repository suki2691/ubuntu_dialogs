2009-04-06T21:31:00.000Z	Aerodynamic		Hi, I'm new to Ubuntu (a total noob). If I've downloaded a .tar.bz file or what not, how do I install it?
2009-04-06T21:31:00.000Z	Aerodynamic		If the install file tells me to do a "./install.sh", what does that mean? :X
2009-04-06T21:31:00.000Z	Ienorand	Aerodynamic	What kind of app is that?
2009-04-06T21:32:00.000Z	Ienorand	Aerodynamic	That means go to terminal an execute that script, which will hopefully will install the stuff...
