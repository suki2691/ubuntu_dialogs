2011-05-05T01:03:00.000Z	filosofixit		My friend tried to uninstall the binary nvidia driver using hardware drivers, but now he is unable to log in due to blank screen... I have ssh access to his box but am not able to restore to binary nvidia drivers.. have installed the nvidia-current package and runned : " sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg " but still no luck
2011-05-05T01:03:00.000Z	filosofixit		xorg.conf shows "nvidia" as the driver enabled... should it be " nv " ?
2011-05-05T01:05:00.000Z	coun	filosofixit	have friends try running the LIVE CD and see if he can fix it up that way
2011-05-05T01:05:00.000Z	filosofixit	coun	: he does not have a clue how to do  that :)
