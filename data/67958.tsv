2010-10-20T18:58:00.000Z	pvh_sa		hi there, i just upgraded to Maverick and my multiple monitor support stopped working... i got an external monitor + laptop's monitor - i now cannot move my mouse between the two and the laptop monitor is black. anyone seen anything similar?
2010-10-20T18:59:00.000Z	gartral	pvh_sa	is there a button on the laptop that looks like a monitor? it would probably be in the fxx buttons, as a special fn combo

2010-10-20T19:08:00.000Z	gartral	pvh_sa	that sounds right... subbimt a bug report
