2006-03-15T11:20:00.000Z	Healot	gabaug	that's not really a bug... you need to associate an e-mail client first... somewhere in Firefox or the desktop manager itself
2006-03-15T11:20:00.000Z	gabaug	Healot	it is a bug, because it works if FF is already opened
2006-03-15T11:20:00.000Z	gabaug	Healot	the bug is opening a http link in an e-mail in FF
