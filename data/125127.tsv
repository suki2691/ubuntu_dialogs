2007-11-05T06:27:00.000Z	scguy318	TheWhip	very small minority, since I doubt everyone here grew up on BSD or Linux :P
2007-11-05T06:27:00.000Z	scguy318	TheWhip	you'll find those in, say, Africa, emerging economies?
2007-11-05T06:28:00.000Z	scguy318	TheWhip	then again cracked Windows can be had in those areas also
