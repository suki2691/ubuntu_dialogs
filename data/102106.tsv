2008-10-19T22:09:00.000Z	versus		hi im running hardy on an usb stick but after updating it apt stuck at "Running depmod" i waited for 20 minutes but nothing changed. I restarted the system and had to use "dpkg --configure -a to get apt working, everything seemed fine but then "Running depmod" appeared again. CPU usage is up to 100% and I have been waiting for about 1 and a half hour without something happening. what can I do?
