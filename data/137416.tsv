2008-03-14T00:52:00.000Z	sykopomp		hey, I can't find a solution to this anywhere...
2008-03-14T00:53:00.000Z	sykopomp		compiz keeps failing with no error, and I don't really know how to go about debugging this
2008-03-14T00:53:00.000Z	sykopomp		doing $ compiz just gives me 'aborting and using fallback: /usr/bin/metacity'
2008-03-14T00:54:00.000Z	benpicco	sykopomp	just paste the error
