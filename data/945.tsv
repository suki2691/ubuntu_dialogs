2012-09-28T15:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Firefishy	contact the people who maintain that package rather than random people
2012-09-28T15:10:00.000Z	Firefishy	ikonia	fine.
2012-09-28T15:24:00.000Z	Firefishy	ikonia	amd64-microcode, does it make a difference if the maintainer is from debian? The straight backport package build+installed 100%. Without microcode AMD systems are unstable.
