2009-07-06T14:27:00.000Z	zetheroo1		I have been trying to get my documents to open with another program than Abiword in Xubuntu but nothing I try works
2009-07-06T14:28:00.000Z	zetheroo1		this is very frustrating ... its like Abiword will not back off from opening documents
2009-07-06T14:29:00.000Z	v3trae	zetheroo1	might want to try in #xubuntu chan
2009-07-06T14:29:00.000Z	zetheroo1	v3trae	ok thanks
