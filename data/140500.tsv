2007-07-13T06:08:00.000Z	ferret	wagner_BR_SE	Very.
2007-07-13T06:08:00.000Z	ferret	wagner_BR_SE	basically install, add '-3g' to the end of your ntfs entries in fstab.
2007-07-13T06:09:00.000Z	ferret	wagner_BR_SE	(or something like that... check the docs.  There shouldn't be more steps than that though)
