2011-06-11T12:01:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly		andrew_46: what's your take on unity?
2011-06-11T12:02:00.000Z	andrew_46	Us3r_Unfriendly	It will eventually be a good thing :)
2011-06-11T12:03:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	andrew_46	do you think they'll have gnome 2.32 forever on the internets for the ones that don't like gnome3 or unity?  Say on gnome's website, a link to the source code to compile or something?
