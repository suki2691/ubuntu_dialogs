2008-12-06T09:55:00.000Z	AlexandertheConf		I can't figure out how to run shell scripts.
2008-12-06T09:56:00.000Z	nickrud	AlexandertheConf	did you make them executable?
2008-12-06T09:57:00.000Z	nickrud	AlexandertheConf	you would do   chmod u+x <filename> , then run it with   ./<filename> (this all assumes you're in the same dir as the shell script)
