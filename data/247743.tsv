2006-09-11T15:35:00.000Z	Cosmo-san		I have one.  does using channel bonding require the switch on the other end to be set up? or can I do it just from my computer?

2006-09-11T15:36:00.000Z	ompaul	Cosmo-san	as it is not a ubuntu specific question all I can do is say: http://www.scl.ameslab.gov/Projects/MP_Lite/dox_channel_bonding.html
