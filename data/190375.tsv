2007-03-26T06:46:00.000Z	MattCampbell		For a somewhat old computer with a 600 MHz Pentium 3 processor and 384 MB of RAM, which I'm setting up for a user with no prior Linux experience, would GNOME or KDE be feasible?

2007-03-26T06:48:00.000Z	lufis	MattCampbell	I would say so. I don't run on that much memory and gnome works well
