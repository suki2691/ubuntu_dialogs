2008-01-25T05:37:00.000Z	puneypunk		ERROR 1049 (42000): Unknown database 'mypassword'
2008-01-25T05:38:00.000Z	kitche	puneypunk	you want to do mysql -u root -p
2008-01-25T05:39:00.000Z	kitche	puneypunk	just remove the mypassword part from that line since it's for the database that you want to connect to after the -p really
