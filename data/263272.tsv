I'm trying to install Ubuntu from a CD, and after I pick "Start or Install Ubuntu" the splash screen appears, does its thing, and then disappears, leaivng only a blinking cursor. Each time I've waited up to ten minutes for something to happen next. What could the problem be?

2006-09-19T08:25:00.000Z	zmeiat_joro		hm, I'll check the iso again
