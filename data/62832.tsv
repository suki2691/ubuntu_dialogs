2009-03-24T09:30:00.000Z	EriK2	bullgard4	 depending upon what you are looking at, it is either signifying which mixer channel you are adjusting the level/gain of, or which input is selected for recording purposes
2009-03-24T09:32:00.000Z	bullgard4	EriK2	No, sir. I designated clearly an object: the 'Master'. The Master is a technical term (terminus technicus) in AlsaMixer. Can you tell me what AlsaMixer weans by 'Master'?
