2008-04-26T20:38:00.000Z	Havnfun		HI, question about CD & DVD versions of Final release H Heron 8.04 - Installed both on two test boxes - and I can't see any difference between the two installs. Does the DVD version install more packages for synaptics locally or what is the biggest difference between them?
