2005-03-22T13:43:00.000Z	robzulah		I doenloaded the Kmud binary, but when I go to run it with ./kmud it says "./kmud: line 21: /home/zeppelin/kmud-1.0-linux-i386/bin/kmud: cannot execute binary file" any idea why?

2005-03-22T13:47:00.000Z	DarthFrog	robzulah	Open a terminal and issue the command "ls -l kmud*" in the directory that the kmud binary is installed in.
