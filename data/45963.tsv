2010-02-21T06:26:00.000Z	cribozai		I have a small problem with pulseaudio. After installing libsdl2.0debian-pulseaudio instead of the alsa one i now get urbanterror to work smoothly. But when i use mumble att the same time as i play (also configured to use pulseaudio) i get significant "lags" in the game. If there is a fix for this i would be most happy. My only other option is to go back to 9.04 due to competitive gaming.
