2008-11-08T23:29:00.000Z	X3		can I make an announcement
2008-11-08T23:29:00.000Z	LjL	X3	please don't
2008-11-08T23:29:00.000Z	LjL	X3	this channel is for support questions and answers, perhaps #ubuntu-offtopic might be appropriate
2008-11-08T23:31:00.000Z	LjL	X3	this is nevertheless a support channel, not a channel for announcements. if you want to talk about open source projects, #ubuntu-offtopic will actually most likely find a more attentive audience to that
