2007-09-23T09:49:00.000Z	kwtm	tarelerulz	Just install the dvdcss package, and then just play the dvd and the software should do the rest.  Hang on, let me get the name of the dvdcss package...
2007-09-23T09:50:00.000Z	kwtm	tarelerulz	It's "sudo apt-get install libdvdcss2" ... Oh, are other people getting "libdvdcss"?
