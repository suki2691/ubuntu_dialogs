2007-05-04T07:38:00.000Z	gotaku		I just installed a new sound card, now but I don't get any sound... I used to use an integrated sound so maybe the system is still trying to use that?

2007-05-04T07:38:00.000Z	agentnewb	gotaku	use live cd to see which drivers are the working ones then set it so
2007-05-04T07:41:00.000Z	gotaku	agentnewb	I think the right drivers are installed, looking at lsmod anyway.
