2007-06-04T06:06:00.000Z	JuJuBee		I need help.  I have a workstation that uses NIS for logins.  I can see all of the accounts in my login list, but none of them can log in.  They all get login failed.
2007-06-04T06:08:00.000Z	JuJuBee		Anybody know what I can do to troubleshoot my NIS problem?  I kinda need it to work so my students can log in.
