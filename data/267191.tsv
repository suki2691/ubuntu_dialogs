2012-05-25T15:37:00.000Z	khmerog_		hmm
2012-05-25T15:37:00.000Z	khmerog_		deltaheavy because if i dont do it that wy. kubuntu will install over my windows 7
2012-05-25T15:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	khmerog_	 i use a gparted live cd and  resize and leave part of the HD unallocated for the linux installer to partion. or i just make the partions from gparted and tell the installer exactly where to install to.
