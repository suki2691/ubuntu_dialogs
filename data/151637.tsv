2009-03-16T12:45:00.000Z	Jester		This is pathetic... Is this the distro I'm supposed to be advising my Grandma to use? A distro with sound not working on a default install, with a 6 years old _creative_ card no less...  I mean I'm sorry but the frustration has to come out.

2009-03-16T12:47:00.000Z	Jester	renton	I have asked my question, but I can ask it again for you
2009-03-16T12:47:00.000Z	Jester	renton	Hello, I just installed 8.10 and I have no sound.  My sound card is a Audigy 2 ZS. I have the emu10k1 module loaded, I tried selecting every possible device, and also alsa/pulseaudio in System->Prefs->Sound. Everything is unmuted, I tried reloading ALSA, pulse, etc. I'm at a lost. Any idea ?
