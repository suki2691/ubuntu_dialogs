2009-06-21T02:09:00.000Z	bsmith_		I have a question.  I want to install ubuntu 9.04 on my new MSI Wind PC. I downloaded the .iso but don't have a cd drive on the wind pc.  How can i create a bootable usb with ubuntu on it to install?  Note I have a windows pc that doesn't have the internet but a IDE dvd drive, a macbook pro with Sun VirtualBox ubuntu 9.04
