2010-05-31T04:50:00.000Z	Guest66482		On the first day possible I upgraded to 10.04 from 9.04. Now Update Manager keeps on asking me to do a partial upgrade. Any ideas on fixing this?
2010-05-31T04:50:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Guest66482	did you do the partial upgrade?
2010-05-31T04:51:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Guest66482	meh, they are stupid.  As long as you haven't installed some crazy stuff, you will be fine.    It will keep asking till do it
