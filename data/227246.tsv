2005-07-20T08:21:00.000Z	signbarn		how is ntfs better than fat32 -- fat32 can be read and written to from ubuntu, right? so i guess what i'm asking is why xp prefers ntfs.
2005-07-20T08:23:00.000Z	signbarn		can you read/write on fat32 from ubuntu?
2005-07-20T08:23:00.000Z	signbarn		i'm currently dual booting xp/ubuntu, so i think i'm going to reformat my xp partition and make it fat32.
