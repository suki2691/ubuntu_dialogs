I typed in /join #fishy for a joke, and the topic of the channel is "Scientists insist on using complex terminology to make it harder for True Christians to refute their claims. Deoxyribonucleic Acid, for example... sounds impressive? But have you seen what happens if you put something in acid? If we had all this acid in our cells, we'd all dissolve! So much for the Theory of Evoluion"
