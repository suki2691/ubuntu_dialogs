2009-07-13T07:39:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty		I try to activate the driver - and it just gives me a big red X

2009-07-13T07:53:00.000Z	ctmjr	shazbotmcnasty	your card is no longer supported by ati in linux see here http://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/News/AMD-Provides-Legacy-Driver-for-Old-ATI-Cards/%28kategorie%29/0  you can install the open-source drivers or an older one from ati's website i think
