2007-11-22T02:44:00.000Z	Nirevus		I'm installing Ubuntu onto an acer Aspire 1360 for a family member. However, I can't access wireless networking on it. "lshw -C network" identifies everything correctly but Administration > Network only shows wired and modem. Any thoughts? It's using a VT6102 Rhine II and an AirConn IPN 2220 Wireless Adaptor

2007-11-22T02:46:00.000Z	ikonia	Nirevus	thats because they are not your wirless cards
