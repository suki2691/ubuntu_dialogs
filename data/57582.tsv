2009-07-07T13:49:00.000Z	kaddi_		the firefox-3.5 package got updated
2009-07-07T13:50:00.000Z	kaddi_		it is 3.5+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.04.1 0 now, so if anyone wants to install it, sudo apt-get install firefox-3.5 works fine :)
2009-07-07T13:51:00.000Z	mbn_18	kaddi_	that was a strange install, the symbol was diffrent and in general it didnt really felt as FF
2009-07-07T13:52:00.000Z	kaddi_	mbn_18	it is a real nice browser though, afterwards :p
