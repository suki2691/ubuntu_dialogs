2005-06-29T14:53:00.000Z	rbrenart		so I just ran a "killall esd" to get sound working in a particular program, and I'm noticing sound is working now in several programs it wasn't before... is there any good reason to run ESD, and if not, how to I just disable it so I don't have to deal with it when I reboot next?
