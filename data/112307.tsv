2008-05-07T06:20:00.000Z	croddy	brunner	not much, but it won't help you much either. you want to *start* with encrypted swawp
2008-05-07T06:30:00.000Z	croddy	brunner	if you do not want an attacker to see what software you have installer, or read your logs, or your configuration files...
2008-05-07T06:31:00.000Z	brunner	croddy	what logs would matter that aren't in /home?
