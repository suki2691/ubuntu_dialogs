2005-11-04T15:17:00.000Z	compDo		Is there any command to jump to the previous directory? For instance, when I'm in /home/chris/dir1/dir2/dir3 and type "cd", so I get to my home directory /home/chris. Is there any command to get back to /home/chris/dir1/dir2/dir3 ? I know that Sun provides a command called "back" for this purpose
