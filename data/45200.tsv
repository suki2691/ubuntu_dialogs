2010-08-06T01:47:00.000Z	jd__		can a dedicated swap file be used to increase vm guest performance in w/ workstation 7?

Limiting the memory and setting dedicated swap (if your vm does that), would seem to be a way of preventing the vm from taking over your system memory, which reduces the performance outside the vm.
