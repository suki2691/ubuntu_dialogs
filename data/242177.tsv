2006-05-28T13:14:00.000Z	mrnicksgirl		I'm having problems configuring X. Before, I did something that would boot directly into console, skipping the gui. But I can't remember or google for how to do that.
2006-05-28T13:15:00.000Z	mrnicksgirl		I dont want to remove gdm, but just make it to go console first. Then I was able to configure X with a little trial and error
2006-05-28T13:16:00.000Z	Anusien	mrnicksgirl	get a piece of software called 'bum' from synaptic/apt-get and uncheck 'gdm'
2006-05-28T13:18:00.000Z	Anusien	mrnicksgirl	what won't install?
