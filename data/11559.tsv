2011-07-28T11:22:00.000Z	KatronixSerf		What I want to do is make it so that I can browse the /home from the laptop
2011-07-28T11:23:00.000Z	tommylarssen	KatronixSerf	What i would do, is simply SSH into ur desktop using openSSH
2011-07-28T11:24:00.000Z	tommylarssen	KatronixSerf	SSH ain´t really taking much resources, that´s how i would aproach it atleast.
