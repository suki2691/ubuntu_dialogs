2005-10-19T16:22:00.000Z	ompaul	Corrado	ask it
2005-10-19T16:24:00.000Z	ompaul	Corrado	it was not stupid, it was just something you did not know, use >sudo foo< to do a job
2005-10-19T16:27:00.000Z	ompaul	Corrado	it will ask for a password that password is yours, however the second and so forth users on the box do not get that privilege without adding them to /etc/sudoers
