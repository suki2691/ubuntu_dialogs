2011-04-29T00:33:00.000Z	trijntje		are the update servers overloaded? I'm upgrading with only 40kB/s
2011-04-29T00:33:00.000Z	hypetech	trijntje	yea
2011-04-29T00:34:00.000Z	trijntje	hypetech	ok, thanks. Maybe I should just cancel the upgrade and try again tomorrow. Or would that break stuff when its still downloading?
2011-04-29T00:34:00.000Z	hypetech	trijntje	it won't break anything if it's still in the downloading phase
