2009-08-14T22:03:00.000Z	neneonline	mazda01	Thanks, I will give up then... find it confusing that in http://linux-ata.org/software-status.html#hotplug it says that it is fully working
2009-08-14T22:05:00.000Z	mazda01	neneonline	well, if you don't have the chipsets that it says it DOESN'T support, then libata should support it.
