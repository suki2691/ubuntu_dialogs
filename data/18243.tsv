2012-03-20T20:50:00.000Z	shwaiil		Q: any problem on having Ubuntu / win7 running together, not as VM. Wasn't there boot problems because of windows or something ? I need to have win in a new computer :P

2012-03-20T20:52:00.000Z	mcb_	shwaiil	It is easier, as the windows bootloader dont recognize Linux.
2012-03-20T20:53:00.000Z	mcb_	shwaiil	Right about that.
