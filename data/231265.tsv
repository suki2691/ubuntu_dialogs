2005-08-29T05:24:00.000Z	dooglus_		hi everyone.  I'm looking for a bittorrent client to replace azeurus.  something with a small memory footprint would be good.
2005-08-29T05:24:00.000Z	dooglus_		azeurus is currently using 455Mb to download just 5 torrents...
2005-08-29T05:24:00.000Z	NoUse	dooglus_	have you tried the standard client?
2005-08-29T05:25:00.000Z	dooglus_	NoUse	I'd like a client to remember the torrents between runs, to offer queueing, or at least multiple downloads at once.
