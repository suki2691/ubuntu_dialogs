2008-06-10T23:03:00.000Z	Slart	archimedes	teamspeak doesn't do pulseadio.. I think it uses oss even
2008-06-10T23:03:00.000Z	Slart	archimedes	you'll have to use aoss .. and do some other magic to make it play nice with games
2008-06-10T23:05:00.000Z	Slart	archimedes	I'm not really sure.. I haven't messed with aoss since I got pulseaudio
