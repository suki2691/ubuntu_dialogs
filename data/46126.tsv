2010-03-26T01:03:00.000Z	mha2908_		Hi guys! Here's (hopefully) a quickie: Recently installed 10.04 server, and want to run the gnome desktop environment through a SSH X Window forwarding session. But how can I install the "ubuntu-desktop"-package without it starting automatically when I boot the pc?
2010-03-26T01:04:00.000Z	mha2908_		so no ideas?
2010-03-26T01:04:00.000Z	mha2908_		sorry, then...
