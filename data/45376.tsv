2009-12-18T23:37:00.000Z	wokka	mMezquitale	ugh, that's annoying
2009-12-18T23:38:00.000Z	mMezquitale	wokka	i got used to it though, plus I leave the terminal open just in case, it comes really handy, plus I already have a link to a terminal on my taskbar so it's all good, i type faster than I click
