LVM gives you an "overview" of the images, allows you to manage the partitions, and such. This is what I meant like an advanced version of GRUB. Does GRUB  go above or below the LVM (inside LVM or outside)?

2012-08-17T03:57:00.000Z	cc11rocks	kyle__	yes
2012-08-17T03:57:00.000Z	kyle__	cc11rocks	Grub undertsands enough of filesystems, partitions, guid partitions and lvm to open those up, pull the kernel, etc.
