2010-03-20T07:05:00.000Z	Ganymede	Random832	oh, i didn't know that, in fact, i heard windows has true hardlinks also but they're buggy since no one cares about them
2010-03-20T07:06:00.000Z	Ganymede	Random832	yeah, i do see the difference between a unix softlink and a windows .lnk, but for the sake of explaining to a user, i'd say they pretty much server the same function
2010-03-20T07:08:00.000Z	Ganymede	Random832	yes, in fact, all files are hard links...most with a link count of 1
