2008-06-26T22:32:00.000Z	zipper		Anyone got experience with evrouter? Or managed to remap the "+" and "-" keys on a logitech mx518 mouse? (the ones to increase/decrease resolution of the mouse). I found a guide on how to remap those keys with evrouter, but i must be doing something wrong since they are not re-mapped (or being used at all). Xev cannot register any input from the mouse when i press those buttons either. Any ideas?
