2007-03-15T10:42:00.000Z	Shane-S		does gedit make files with a ~ after them by default or is that an error somewhere?
2007-03-15T10:43:00.000Z	Shane-S		like I just edited a file named default, and doing an LS there is now a default~ as well
2007-03-15T10:43:00.000Z	Seveas	Shane-S	your editor made a backup
2007-03-15T10:43:00.000Z	Seveas	Shane-S	gedit and joe do that, probably others as well
