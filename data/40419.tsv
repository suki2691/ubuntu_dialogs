2009-12-22T00:56:00.000Z	mmarc__3		sorry, but I have to point this once again: texmaker package is not available to me somewhy: "E: Couldn't find package texmaker", but apt-file found "texmaker: /usr/bin/texmaker" - How could this happen?
2009-12-22T00:57:00.000Z	fujimitsu	mmarc__3	checked yer source.list?
2009-12-22T00:58:00.000Z	mmarc__3	fujimitsu	sry, I don't know, how
2009-12-22T01:00:00.000Z	fujimitsu	mmarc__3	if the download source for that package is not in the repo, yer going to have to find that source and add it to the list
