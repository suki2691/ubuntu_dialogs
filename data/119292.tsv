2008-02-24T22:26:00.000Z	decaelo		Anyone know why I can't upgrade fr Dapper to Edgy due to broken packages? I have just installed from 6.06LTS CD sent to me from canonical, installed all the updates I could until none were left.. now when I change my sources.list from dapper -> edgy nothing is working

2008-02-24T22:29:00.000Z	decaelo		off topic? my system can't upgrade.. that isn't off topi c
2008-02-24T22:29:00.000Z	bazhang	decaelo	just wait a few weeks and go directly to 8.04 one step
