2007-11-24T11:11:00.000Z	joeb3_	lostblur	does 'iptables -L' still show any rules?
2007-11-24T11:14:00.000Z	joeb3_	lostblur	iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT ; iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT ; iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT ; iptables -F
2007-11-24T11:14:00.000Z	joeb3_	lostblur	that should remove what firestarter added.
