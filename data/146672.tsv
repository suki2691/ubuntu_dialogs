2007-02-06T16:20:00.000Z	bonez56		what about using automatix or easyubuntu? will they work ok with the 64 bit versions?
2007-02-06T16:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	bonez56	well, considering he does support professionally, I'd take his recommendation over other individuals ;)
2007-02-06T16:22:00.000Z	bonez56	tonyyarusso	lol, ok well can't really argue then can I :)
