2005-05-04T14:31:00.000Z	X|rtam		hey everybody - I'm super new to linux, and I'm just looking for a little starter help - I just downloaded the Ubuntu ISO, and I thought, if I booted with the cd, that I could start it up without affecting my current OS... but I tried it and it just seems as though it's trying to format/install... or am I just losing it?
