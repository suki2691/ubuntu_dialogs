2011-05-23T13:55:00.000Z	Lachezar		Hello all... I am having an issue with stale, invisible, top-level windows.
2011-05-23T13:55:00.000Z	Lachezar		How can I find which program it belongs to?
2011-05-23T13:57:00.000Z	rileyp	Lachezar	 just sudo service gdm restart and it will go away
2011-05-23T13:58:00.000Z	Lachezar	rileyp	Yeah, but with all other windows :(.
