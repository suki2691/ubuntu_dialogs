2010-03-02T14:56:00.000Z	Slik_	stage2	do you know why ubuntu does not detect any restrictive drivers on assus eeepc 1101 ha ?
2010-03-02T14:56:00.000Z	stage2	Slik_	it may not offer any, you can also try sudo aptitude update first, but probably doesnt have any
2010-03-02T14:58:00.000Z	stage2	Slik_	erUSUL: cause ubuntu may not support the hardware
2010-03-02T14:58:00.000Z	stage2	Slik_	whats the specific driver your lookin for?
