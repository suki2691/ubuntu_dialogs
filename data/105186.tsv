2011-05-02T16:05:00.000Z	Anax192		Hello, people. I'm really sorry for just barging in here and writing like this. I'm kinda short with time and need a little help. Is there anyone available? Again, sorry for no introduction or anything. Oh, and if I have broken any rule by writing like this, sorry about that, too.

2011-05-02T16:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Anax192	boot to root recovery and run: apt-get -f install
2011-05-02T16:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Anax192	reboot and press ESC when grub starts to load, then select recovery mode, then select root
