2012-06-11T21:50:00.000Z	semarjt		hey guys i just spun up a new ubuntu linode, can anyone tell me why anything i install gets me Hash Sum mismatch? even after apt-get-update, fix-missing, etc
2012-06-11T21:50:00.000Z	semarjt		tried 12.04 and 10.04
2012-06-11T21:50:00.000Z	semarjt		is that possibly linode's problem?
