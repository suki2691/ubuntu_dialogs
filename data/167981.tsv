2006-09-28T11:02:00.000Z	Garsty		I have compiled "simple wx widgets application" in KDevelop, but when trying to run it, it says "segementation fault", exited with status 139
2006-09-28T11:02:00.000Z	Garsty		does anyone have any idea what is that supposed to mean?
2006-09-28T11:03:00.000Z	JosefK	Garsty	it means you're using pointers improperly somewhere, time to learn to debug ;)
2006-09-28T11:04:00.000Z	Garsty	JosefK	the program code was generated by KDevelop
