2011-05-17T02:09:00.000Z	adam61		i'm adding new keyboard shortcuts, and i was just wondering if someone could tell me what to put in the command field if i wanted to have it open a folder (~/home/adam/Music for example)
2011-05-17T02:09:00.000Z	bindi	adam61	nautilus infront
2011-05-17T02:10:00.000Z	adam61	bindi	great, thanks very much
2011-05-17T02:17:00.000Z	adam61	bindi	didn't seem to work.. i just typed "nautilus ~/Music"
