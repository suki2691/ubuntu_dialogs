2012-06-12T22:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	davidha	 theres allready a tmpfs typt thing thats basically a ramdisk.
2012-06-12T22:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	davidha	 what do you need to do with it?
2012-06-12T22:05:00.000Z	davidha	Dr_willis	I was playing with ramfs and tmpfs - they do not support extended file attributes (which I need)  - need to look for alternatives
