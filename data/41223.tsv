2009-12-08T07:12:00.000Z	tehdave		So, I'm having a really FUN issue...I'm getting sound, but it's all static. I used the Pulseaudio fix listed in (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=789578), and using the PulseAudio Volume control, when I set the main volume to 1%, it doesn't actually change the volume, but rather seems to change the % chance to have the sound turn to static. Sound is now mostly working, but I'm getting static on some sounds. any ideas? Runnin
