2010-11-06T07:04:00.000Z	Hrimfaxi	ZykoticK9	anything specific I should be looking for after running dmesg?
2010-11-06T07:04:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Hrimfaxi	drives sdX stuff would be good - or anything that could be the reader itself.
2010-11-06T07:05:00.000Z	Hrimfaxi		I see sdb
2010-11-06T07:06:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Hrimfaxi	type "mount" in a terminal - is sdb mounted right now?  how many drives do you have?  any usb stuff plugged in?  sdb is the second scsi detected on your system (don't worry it's not really scsi ;)
