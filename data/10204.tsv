2012-02-20T06:42:00.000Z	baggy		Hey everyone. I typically try to resolve problems on my own so but I can't figure out what is going wrong here. Whenever I try to use the Software Center to install something I want it will give the usual install dialogue, prompt me for my authentication and such, displaying the "Installing..." message for roughly half a second and then totally stop and just sit there. After which, if I try again, it does the same thing. Any ideas on
2012-02-20T06:42:00.000Z	baggy		how I can fix this?
2012-02-20T06:42:00.000Z	BrandonBolton	baggy	have you tried to install anything through command line to see if that works?
2012-02-20T06:43:00.000Z	BrandonBolton	baggy	yeah, I was wondering about apt-get.
