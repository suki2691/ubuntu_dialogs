2006-08-27T08:19:00.000Z	don_jr	whitehorseNtiger	yeah I've got ubuntu installed on my PC dual booted with XP and on my laptop and finally got my wireless card working....only problem I have now is I don't have sound on my PC
2006-08-27T08:21:00.000Z	whitehorseNtiger	don_jr	:  I dual boot rarely, mostly stick with ubuntu.  I have a small partition for 64bit windows professional.  I have an ibm laptop that the liveCD doesn't work on, but it is my wife's and I don't care if it has windows.  She seems to have some viruses.  OH well.
