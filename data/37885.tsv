2010-03-11T03:48:00.000Z	BlackDalek		I am having problems connecting my imac to my ubuntu computer. What do enter into the imac's "connect to server..." box in order to be able to send files between the two computers? I have personal file sharing, windows sharing and ftp enabled on the imac. There is no problem connecting to the imac from the ubuntu machine. What do I do?
2010-03-11T03:49:00.000Z	[V13]Axel	BlackDalek	Have you tried using the logical IP address of the Ubuntu system?
2010-03-11T03:50:00.000Z	BlackDalek	[V13]Axel	er.. what? As far as I know the computer only has one IP address on my network.
2010-03-11T03:51:00.000Z	[V13]Axel	BlackDalek	IP and logical addresses are the same thing. Have you tried using the IP instead of the host name?
