2009-06-01T18:30:00.000Z	zeeble	JDShewey	what does iotop do? functionally?
2009-06-01T18:31:00.000Z	JDShewey	zeeble	it's like top, but for disk io. It tells you which processes are using how much time reading from and writing to your disk.
2009-06-01T18:31:00.000Z	zeeble	JDShewey	ah, nice. dunno about the windows equivalent.
