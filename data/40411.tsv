2010-01-13T05:34:00.000Z	LadyLynn		I recently installed Ubuntu for the first time on an old computer (clean instal on a formatted HD).  I just noticed that some websites don't open and it says that it's looking up for 7search.com and also, some software freezes and is not responding.  Am thinking that I have some spyware, anyone know how to clean/fix this?

2010-01-13T05:36:00.000Z	LadyLynn	daftykins	I tried going on kijiji.ca (similar to craigslist) and some sites on it don't work, not sure which other sites dont work, but it's on and off
2010-01-13T05:38:00.000Z	daftykins	LadyLynn	can you pastebin the contents of /etc/resolv.conf please? along with the output of "ifconfig -a"
