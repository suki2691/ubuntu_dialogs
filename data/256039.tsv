2004-12-04T13:33:00.000Z	Deft	triablo	did you install in from a package?
2004-12-04T13:34:00.000Z	triablo	Deft	no, because apt-get anly features the old stable versiona and i need the newest
2004-12-04T13:35:00.000Z	Deft	triablo	if you used source, it's possible you'll have to set it up manually in gdm
