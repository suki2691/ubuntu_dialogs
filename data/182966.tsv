2007-08-23T08:37:00.000Z	hiroshiX		do I need to do anything special to enable usage of a second core in ubuntu?
2007-08-23T08:38:00.000Z	hiroshiX		cool, but do the programs need to be programmed to make use of the second core?
2007-08-23T08:38:00.000Z	hiroshiX		or do all linux programs use whatever core?
2007-08-23T08:38:00.000Z	Pelo	hiroshiX	 core usage is a  kernel thing ,  not an app thing
