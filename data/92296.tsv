2008-05-09T15:41:00.000Z	Johnny_5		i used displayconfig-gtk to adjust my screen resolution so that i wouldn't have to keep adjusting it every time i logged in...now my resolution is off & everything is blurry in my gui...
2008-05-09T15:43:00.000Z	Johnny_5		can someone please help me get me screen resolution back to normal?
2008-05-09T15:43:00.000Z	holyguyver_	Johnny_5	so you want our input? :p
2008-05-09T15:44:00.000Z	holyguyver_	Johnny_5	there should be some sort of contral panel thing that gives you that option
