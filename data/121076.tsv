2007-12-02T22:34:00.000Z	rpj8		Hey guys, trying to move photos from my ~ directory to a mounted drive in /media... I get this error: mv: cannot stat `2007-1*': No such file or directory
2007-12-02T22:34:00.000Z	jrib	rpj8	paste the full command
2007-12-02T22:35:00.000Z	rpj8	jrib	tim__: ah wait... it seems it did mv the folders when I tried the command the first time with 'sudo' in front
2007-12-02T22:36:00.000Z	rpj8	jrib	tim__ : even though it said a bunch of permission denied
