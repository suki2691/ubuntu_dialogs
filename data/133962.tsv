2007-11-17T06:33:00.000Z	wubrgamer		hey ubuntu, update-manager wants me to update all of the samba stuff, but the repo's aren't letting me download them
2007-11-17T06:33:00.000Z	wubrgamer		why ?
2007-11-17T06:34:00.000Z	mosibfu	wubrgamer	jangari: the update was not good, it will be fixed later
2007-11-17T06:35:00.000Z	mosibfu	wubrgamer	exactly, just wait a bit and it will become unbugged and availible
