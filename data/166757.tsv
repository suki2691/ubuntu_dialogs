2006-09-24T10:33:00.000Z	Ash-Fox		Would anyone happen to know of a decent webbased management system for general servers (Since I'm helping a friend setup a server, who has little knowledge on Linux)?
2006-09-24T10:35:00.000Z	ritcey	Ash-Fox	like webmin?
2006-09-24T10:36:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	ritcey	yes. I don't see webmin in the repositories though.
2006-09-24T10:36:00.000Z	ritcey	Ash-Fox	that, I can't help you with - sorry =)
