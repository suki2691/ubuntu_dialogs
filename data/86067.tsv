2009-12-19T08:00:00.000Z	riegersn		i have wifi set up and i can scan and see my router, but i can't seem to connect. when i set the essid then run dhclient. it scans for a bit then says 'no dhcpoffers' - what could be wrong? there is no key required to connect - any help would be appreciated (im on ubuntu cli system)
