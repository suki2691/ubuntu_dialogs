2010-01-19T03:51:00.000Z	webster		I'm dualbooting xp (120gb) and 9.10 (20gb) how can I make my XP partition visible in 9.10?
2010-01-19T03:51:00.000Z	berserk_ren	webster	it should be visible
2010-01-19T03:52:00.000Z	webster	berserk_ren	I know...but it's not, could it have something to do with the fact that I installed it in windows as an application?
2010-01-19T03:53:00.000Z	berserk_ren	webster	dunno, i installed as independent system =}
