2008-12-29T07:40:00.000Z	rainabba		I'm having a major issue with glxinfo. I've got an nVidia GTX 260, running Ubuntu Hardy x86_64, enabled Desktop Effects, installed fusion-icon, and I've installed the nVidia binary drivers from nvidia.com. When I execute glxinfo, I get bumped back to the login screen. If I start fusion-icon from a terminal, the same happens though I can start it from the Applications menu without any trouble.
