2006-06-15T13:50:00.000Z	qmf		i've come across a bit of a problem. i want to add all my music to rhythmbox music player. all my music is a share from my serve rcalled servermusic which contains all the folders of my music. but i can't seem to just add the servermusic share. i can only add the folders individually. anyone know a workaround?

2006-06-15T13:52:00.000Z	qmf	Blissex	doesn't seem to have it. i changed the libry location to the servermusic share and ticked watch for new music but it still doesn't add anything
