2009-08-17T23:52:00.000Z	Ben64		i was gonna install firefox-3.5, but since yelp was version-locked, synaptic told me it wanted to uninstall ubuntu-desktop
2009-08-17T23:52:00.000Z	Ben64		so i'd suggest trying out synaptic
2009-08-17T23:53:00.000Z	__theIdiotBox	Ben64	yes that would be a better option
