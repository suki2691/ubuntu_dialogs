2011-12-21T15:25:00.000Z	ChristW_		Can I ask a 'Make' question here, or is there a more on topic channel?
2011-12-21T15:26:00.000Z	ChristW_		I have a target with a semicolon (;) in the file name. Make seems to split at that point: make: *** No rule to make target `/home/christ/Desktop/Parallels Shared Folders/MP3/Genesis/Invisible Touch/06\. Domino \(Part One - In The Glow Of The Night'. In the target, there is a ; and the rest of the file name.

2011-12-21T15:27:00.000Z	ChristW_	jutnux	Ok.
