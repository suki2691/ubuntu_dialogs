2009-01-12T04:25:00.000Z	eeePingJocky	outofthemadness	yeah, i think it depends on the files your looking at
2009-01-12T04:27:00.000Z	outofthemadness	eeePingJocky	I mean, how might you edit what languages it recognizes? I just started messing around with processing, and whenever I load a processing file in gedit, it comes up with C syntax highlighting
2009-01-12T04:31:00.000Z	eeePingJocky	outofthemadness	looks like its going to be more than skin deep, you may have to alter the language  highlighting and im not sure where that is at
