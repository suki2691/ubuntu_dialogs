From that time, I'm not getting any notifications on the top-bar. It doesn't shows me any apps icons. like VLC, XCHAT or even the Active Connection. Except that, everything is working as a fresh install. I'd restarted my system later but it's still the same. I want to restore the system. Please, tell me if there's any solution.
