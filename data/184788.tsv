2011-02-14T00:13:00.000Z	y7		i plan on installing ubuntu and  winxp on the same hdd... if i install ubuntu first, should i make sure to leave some partition space available for windows xp or does it not work that way?
2011-02-14T00:15:00.000Z	y7		ok, so if i install windows first, do i need to partition it to leave space for ubuntu?
2011-02-14T00:17:00.000Z	y7		roger that, thanks for the help guys
