2006-09-26T15:00:00.000Z	kyja		xp would use 200mb of ram where vista would use over the 1gig of ram I have and it would runn all my 3.4ghz at 100% over heat my laptop until it shut down.
2006-09-26T15:01:00.000Z	kyja		I like ubuntu. however some graphics features eat the clock until it over heats. I am careful what screen saver I use.
