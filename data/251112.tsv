2005-02-03T10:11:00.000Z	insanekane	rexiboy	yoper claims to be faster due to prelinking
2005-02-03T10:30:00.000Z	rexiboy	insanekane	sorry for the late reply, I know Yoper is faster, I use it. just wondering if ubuntu really sees any major boost with prelink
2005-02-03T10:31:00.000Z	insanekane	rexiboy	a lot of people feel prelinking doesnt lend anything to speed ... i dont know why, cuz ive run yoper, and it seems faster to me
