2007-09-29T07:56:00.000Z	`rusty`		help! nautilus keeps on re-spawning (and freezing) cuz it can't read a directory.  I can't kill it because it just respawns! Any ideas?
2007-09-29T07:57:00.000Z	jrib	`rusty`	system -> prefernces -> session  is where you set whether or not it restarts.  If you kill it enough times, it will not come back though
2007-09-29T07:59:00.000Z	`rusty`	jrib	is that under the style? (change it to "normal"?)
2007-09-29T08:00:00.000Z	jrib	`rusty`	yes
