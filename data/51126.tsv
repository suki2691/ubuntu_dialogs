2009-08-04T02:15:00.000Z	ayecaramba		I'm upgrading from 8.04 to 9.04... usually when I upgrade I type 'update-manager -d' and it gives me the option to update to the newest distro, however it's only giving me the option to update to 8.10 ... does this mean I have to first update to 8.10 then 9.04 ?
