2008-04-16T14:08:00.000Z	DJones	s_	simplest way if you're running X, open synaptic and select Settings and then repositories, then tick the backports box, I'm not on ubuntu at the minute, so that could have slightly changed, but should be fairly self explanatory, once done, you need to click reload to update the sources
