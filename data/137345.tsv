2007-05-06T13:02:00.000Z	snowman	kludge	isn't that a beryl thing?
2007-05-06T13:04:00.000Z	kludge	snowman	it might just be beryl, thanks ;)
2007-05-06T13:04:00.000Z	snowman	kludge	don't quote me on that as this machine can't run beryl and so I can't experiment with it.  hell, I can't even use the desktop effects option under feisty.
