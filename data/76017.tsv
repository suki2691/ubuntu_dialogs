2008-10-31T13:50:00.000Z	pthagonal1		Sorry to repeat myself- will give this one more go: I'm planning on doing a fresh desktop install of 8.10 and want to do software mirroring across a pair of SATA drives. To save me downloading the wrong iso, can anyone recommend normal/alternative/dvd as the one I should get?

2008-10-31T13:52:00.000Z	pthagonal1	jim_p	I was thinking of 64 bit as the box has 4GB, but could do 32bit if I have to. what would you recommend for 64bit?
2008-10-31T13:53:00.000Z	jim_p	pthagonal1	ubuntu alternative 64bit installation iso. are you that good to download the server and isntall packages on your own?
