2006-08-19T13:32:00.000Z	d104		Hi Guys, I'm having problems connecting Evolution to my exchange account. Does anyone know how I can diagnose whats going wrong?
2006-08-19T13:33:00.000Z	NickGarvey	d104	perhaps you need ssl?
2006-08-19T13:35:00.000Z	d104	NickGarvey	I've tried both the http and https url for the OWA without any success. Both tell me I have an incorrect username and password
2006-08-19T13:36:00.000Z	NickGarvey	d104	I'm not familiar with evolution :/
