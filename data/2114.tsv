2012-07-05T20:15:00.000Z	boii	abcdefv	that make grub not show on startup?
2012-07-05T20:16:00.000Z	abcdefv	boii	the problem right now is a blinking cursor when I boot into my ubuntu partition (which I installed from virtualbox in os x). I just edited the grub settings to show itself. we'll see what happens now
