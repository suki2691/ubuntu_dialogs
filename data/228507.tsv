2006-01-13T10:55:00.000Z	DocTomoe		Hm, Can someone please pinpoint me to how to install a specific version of a package via apt-get, even if its dependencies are broken?
2006-01-13T10:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	DocTomoe	if the deps are broken, it won't work - by definition
2006-01-13T10:58:00.000Z	DocTomoe	thoreauputic	and pigs can fly ;) Problem is that I have a joint breezy-dapper system and have to install eclipse, which depends on a specific version of a library, which has since been updated
2006-01-13T10:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	DocTomoe	well, if you are mixing Dapper and Breezy you get to keep both pieces when it breaks ;-)
