2008-04-30T04:44:00.000Z	_flu_		i'm repeating my SOS -;x- call: i just install hardy heron. and i also installed kopete. but my taskbar tray doesn't flash when a message recieved.. it's also the same in pidgin.. anybody help?
2008-04-30T04:45:00.000Z	Konam	_flu_	did you check the settings to see if they're enabled
2008-04-30T04:48:00.000Z	_flu_	Konam	yes, i did. when i first ask this question a guy replied "i am at the same situation".. it's so meaningless
2008-04-30T04:49:00.000Z	Konam	_flu_	no idea what it is. check if is a plugin and is disabled or something..
