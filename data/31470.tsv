2010-05-21T22:34:00.000Z	hanlof_		please somebody.. i get no login prompt on any text console (alt + 1-6) on a freshly installed ubuntu. intel core i7. tons of ram etc. need more hw specs and i'll give it but its pretty standard
2010-05-21T22:35:00.000Z	hanlof_		it must be a known problem with the missing text console?
2010-05-21T22:35:00.000Z	jack_boss	hanlof_	u didnt choose the right iso, use tasksel to download the desktop u wish
2010-05-21T22:35:00.000Z	hanlof_	jack_boss	okay that sounds like a plan.
