2011-08-29T00:27:00.000Z	Citizenwarrior		I have file.txt, I want to chmos it to read only for everyone, right now it is -rwxrwxrwx therefore I have tried sudo chmod 444 file.txt and nothing changes... What am I over looking?
2011-08-29T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Citizenwarrior	who is the owner?
2011-08-29T00:28:00.000Z	Citizenwarrior	ActionParsnip	I created it and moved it and I am trying to chmod it all from the same session, nothing has changed
2011-08-29T00:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Citizenwarrior	doesn't answer my question
