2011-09-07T16:44:00.000Z	cillo564		I have 10.04 LTS When comes next LTS version, is it usually easy to dist-upgrade to it?
2011-09-07T16:44:00.000Z	TheEvilPhoenix	cillo564	 upgrading from LTS to LTS is supported, so its not too hard
2011-09-07T16:44:00.000Z	TheEvilPhoenix	cillo564	 but with EVERY upgrade, you run the risk of things breaking
