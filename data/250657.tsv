2005-02-09T15:36:00.000Z	adbak		i just installed ubuntu on my parents' computer and it doesn't recognize a sound card, thus no sound.  anyone have any ideas as to how i can get sound?
2005-02-09T15:37:00.000Z	adbak		right
2005-02-09T15:37:00.000Z	adbak		i tried scouring the net for the pkg "sndconfig", but it wouldn't work
