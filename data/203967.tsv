2005-12-26T07:50:00.000Z	tRSS		question: How can I disable X? I just don't want it to run at all
2005-12-26T07:51:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	tRSS	remove the symlinks from /etc/, but that's not healthy, there's a tool to do it
2005-12-26T07:52:00.000Z	tRSS	Kamping_Kaiser	do you remember the tool?
2005-12-26T07:52:00.000Z	Kamping_Kaiser	tRSS	update-rc.d (just looked it up)
