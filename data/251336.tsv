2009-11-25T00:58:00.000Z	princezuda		I got the black bash screen in ubuntu, thats why I'm here. I did my updates and bam my system crashed.
2009-11-25T00:59:00.000Z	princezuda		Is there a way to undo updates from the emergency ubuntu bash line?
2009-11-25T01:00:00.000Z	princezuda		My ubuntu just crashed because I made a mistake and let it update to a beta version. I was running ubuntu 9.10 but now it is beta 4.
