2007-04-23T07:00:00.000Z	Andy80		if I launch compiz I get a segfault... I've just upgraded to feisty (7.04) is it a known bug?
2007-04-23T07:01:00.000Z	ra21vi	Andy80	update and dist-upgrade to make sure system has all fiesty compatible libs
2007-04-23T07:02:00.000Z	Andy80	ra21vi	yes, I just did both of them
