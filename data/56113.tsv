2009-06-07T07:07:00.000Z	fccf	topgun21	yes ... to fit on 1gig stick
2009-06-07T07:08:00.000Z	topgun21	fccf	So i have to waist a dvd in order to install the note book remix on my Lenovo 300 N500
2009-06-07T07:09:00.000Z	fccf	topgun21	the reason they made it 1gig is so it would fit on a 1gig thumbdrive - it is supposed to boot from thumbdrive hence *.img and not *.iso
