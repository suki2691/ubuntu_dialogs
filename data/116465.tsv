2007-10-20T05:11:00.000Z	flick		how can i make ubuntu look like vista?
2007-10-20T05:12:00.000Z	localgod11	flick	best way is go get a them that looks like vista and run kde
2007-10-20T05:12:00.000Z	localgod11		but imho i would go with compizfusion
2007-10-20T05:13:00.000Z	flick	localgod11	actually i'm not that keen to make it look like vista... unless there are other advantages of running KDE?
