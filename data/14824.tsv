2011-05-01T17:06:00.000Z	Guest153289		why does compiz not work like how it did in 10.04 and 10.10?  Even in ubuntu classic it strips my top bar for close, minimize and maximize, and then doesn't let me move any of my windows
2011-05-01T17:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest153289	 sounds like the window decortator is not running.
2011-05-01T17:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest153289	 you are saying thers no title bar or buttons for any windows?
2011-05-01T17:08:00.000Z	Guest153289	Dr_Willis	correct, but it says gtk window decorator is running, false positive?
