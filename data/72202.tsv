2010-06-18T11:35:00.000Z	ManDay		I've got two JAV-applets which do EXACTLY THE SAME. One of them, however, if requesting a specific file from http://...:8000/ a file sees a different (faulty) content in the file which neither I nor the instance which works properly sees. How can this be! I'm using Firefox, 10.4LTS 64b and Sun JAVA.
2010-06-18T11:36:00.000Z	jaem	ManDay	are they *exactly* the same applet (read: file), or just supposedly functionally equivalent?
2010-06-18T11:40:00.000Z	ManDay	jaem	they are the same applet - run on a different url - thats all. However I'm the only pwerson having this problem.
