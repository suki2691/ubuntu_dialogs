2009-07-12T23:21:00.000Z	velcroshooz		I am trying to reinstall grub after a windows install and am getting this error - http://www.pastebin.org/1198 can anyone help?
2009-07-12T23:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	velcroshooz	 i normally install grub to the mbr of the hard drive.. ie: /dev/sda  NOT /dev/sda5
2009-07-12T23:22:00.000Z	velcroshooz	Dr_Willis	well that makes sense. let me try that
2009-07-12T23:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	velcroshooz	you may want to reread the '!fixgrub' factoid/urls also.. and the grub docs Its worth learning the ins and outs of grub
