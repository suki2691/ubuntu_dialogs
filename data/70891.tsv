2009-07-05T19:35:00.000Z	Rounin		So I have a question that's bothering me a little... I've installed the ati fglrx driver and want to enable it, but there's no information in my xorg.conf file whatsoever... It's just got some empty sections and that's it
2009-07-05T19:35:00.000Z	Rounin		SHould I just reboot and see what happens or what? Last time the screen filled up with noise
2009-07-05T19:35:00.000Z	nathan7	Rounin	There's something named aticonfig
2009-07-05T19:36:00.000Z	nathan7	Rounin	Use that
