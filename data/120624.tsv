2009-08-04T01:03:00.000Z	zk	danbhfive	i got the right source from git but when i compile it with fakeroot make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=generic kernel_image kernel_headers     I always get the wrong version
2009-08-04T01:04:00.000Z	danbhfive	zk	yeah, I dunno.  Maybe you need to get it from linux-source, and not git
