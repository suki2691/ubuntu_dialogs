2012-06-29T14:09:00.000Z	kevininspain		Hi. Today I have to change my 80 GB HD for one which is 380GB. Is there are way of transfering my whole operating system to the new one or is it best to do a fresh install ?

2012-06-29T14:09:00.000Z	ikonia	kevininspain	some minor changes such as the fstab, but yes
2012-06-29T14:09:00.000Z	ikonia	kevininspain	hateball's suggestion is much better though
