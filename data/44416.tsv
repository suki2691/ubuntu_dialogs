2009-11-10T19:20:00.000Z	Laibcoms	xt28	yep I am using UUID, since Jaunty :)  I also double-checked it when I upgraded to Karmic, the system doesn't want to follow my HDD boot order via my bios :p
2009-11-10T19:20:00.000Z	xt28	Laibcoms	all right.
2009-11-10T19:21:00.000Z	Laibcoms	xt28	something must have been updated in Karmic and it is working as intended now.  but in Jaunty it wasn't hehe ^_^
