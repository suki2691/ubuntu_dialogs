2012-01-20T19:33:00.000Z	jorge		“Anonymous members are distributing a link that ropes internet users into an illegal DDoS attack against these websites simply by clicking it.” I was on twitter and I think, without know all of this,  it's possible that I click in a few ones, how do I do to know if my pc is a begin used as a zombie for an Ddos attack ?
