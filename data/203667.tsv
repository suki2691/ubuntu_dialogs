2005-12-21T15:52:00.000Z	a-865		how much space for / does edubuntu really need to install? I've failed twice now with disk full errors :(
2005-12-21T15:52:00.000Z	Jowi	a-865	last night a normal install was 1.6 gb
2005-12-21T15:53:00.000Z	a-865	Jowi	my first try had 1.95G, and today I tried on 2.25G and failed again
2005-12-21T15:54:00.000Z	Jowi	a-865	the final size for it was 1.6gb. but i have no idea how much it needs while unpacking and installing the stuff. i had a 3gb partition for it that worked fine at least.
