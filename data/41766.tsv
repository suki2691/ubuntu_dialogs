2009-12-11T23:03:00.000Z	Satzo	therekku	were the files in question necessary?  sometimes installers just replace what is needed....
2009-12-11T23:06:00.000Z	therekku	Satzo	it didint replace anything, it just said it needs to get rid of these two files, which were named Linux.Generic and since theyre named like that, i tought they might be something important, any solution for the "Bus Error"?
2009-12-11T23:19:00.000Z	Satzo	therekku	no idea.  but i have replaced files in the past without regrets.....
