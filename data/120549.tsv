But when I went and opened the blacklist the driver was there. What should I do to make it automattically modprobe like it did on Gutsy?

2008-06-16T20:01:00.000Z	Flare183	tech0007	But I thought it was supposed to be on the blacklist. If it is on the blacklist isn't it supposed to automatically be modprobed when you boot up the computer and start Ubuntu?
2008-06-16T20:02:00.000Z	tech0007	Flare183	do u want it to be loaded or not?
