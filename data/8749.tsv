2011-10-15T04:03:00.000Z	JaredMW		Is there any way that I can get to system options using keyboard commands so that I can try to repair or reinstall the new distro? Again, this isn't just a gnome vs. unity thing -- there's NOTHING.

2011-10-15T04:04:00.000Z	JaredMW	murple	You haven't found a solution yet, I take it? I managed to open some applications by opening files associated with them, but I can't get to system options, can't get to the Software Center, or anything like that. I'm not sure what to do.
