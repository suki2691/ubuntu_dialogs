2011-10-07T06:43:00.000Z	shapeshifta	crash1hd	are you trying to upgrade?
2011-10-07T06:59:00.000Z	crash1hd	shapeshifta	I was thinking of doing an upgrade of 11.04 to 11.04 to see if it resolves any of my issues but was wondering if its going to delete the home folder and all of the content in there (I am now backing up said folder just incase)
2011-10-07T07:03:00.000Z	shapeshifta	crash1hd	im guessing it should have an option to repair or install while keeping home intact. I am not sure though.
