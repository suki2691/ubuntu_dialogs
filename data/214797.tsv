2006-01-03T08:57:00.000Z	slide		Ok, so does anyone know of a LVM howto? I want to combine 2 drives into 1
2006-01-03T08:58:00.000Z	mister_roboto	slide	google for "lvm howto" shows lots of stuff, oddly enough!
2006-01-03T09:00:00.000Z	mister_roboto	slide	ummm... u don't have to be an asshole when someone just trying to help
2006-01-03T09:01:00.000Z	mister_roboto	slide	it's pretty obvious you didn't even try to search though because there is a LOT of info on LVM findable on google, in modern wikis
