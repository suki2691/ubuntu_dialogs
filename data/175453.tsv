2006-07-08T11:41:00.000Z	erpo	hate-	I think there's a fork of gaim with webcam support. I don't know about an integrated mp3 player.
2006-07-08T11:43:00.000Z	hate-	erpo	its on that repository thing right?
2006-07-08T11:44:00.000Z	erpo	hate-	No idea. I've given up on webcam support in linux. Most of the time, a webcam requires a driver. Getting a driver working in linux, especially an unpopular one, is an exercise in futility.
