Do most people wait a while after most releases till theres a bunch of updates available so they dont run into major issues? Or is it just a jump in and start breaking stuff kinda thing and dont wait for anything?
2009-02-12T08:23:00.000Z	MarkJones		Im just wondering cause 8.04.2 seems realy reliable now to me and 8.10 still has reliability issues for me.
2009-02-12T08:23:00.000Z	MarkJones		I see.
2009-02-12T08:23:00.000Z	soreau	MarkJones	Then keep using 8.04 since it's LTS
