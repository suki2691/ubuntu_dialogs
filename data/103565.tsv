2008-10-28T14:41:00.000Z	nenad		yeah sorry.. as soon i asked to ask I recalled that I read somewhere that I shouldn't do that
2008-10-28T14:42:00.000Z	nenad		whasince new ubuntu is about to be released, do you think it's better to install on a freshly formatted partition or to do dist-upgrade... and why..?
