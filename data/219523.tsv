2006-10-23T07:31:00.000Z	Badkitty		Question. Im trying to install some dependencies for network-manager-gnome.. and one is installing but saying it is not installed... in synaptic it shows it but it doesn't have the logo next to it.. what doesd this mean?

2006-10-23T07:33:00.000Z	Flannel	Badkitty	nope.  No logo doesn't mean broken, just not fully supported (supported by the community, instead of by canonical)
2006-10-23T07:57:00.000Z	Flannel	Badkitty	#ubuntu+1 for edgy people
