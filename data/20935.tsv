2011-01-04T23:18:00.000Z	stew	linux_direction	there is no need for dd, you can "cp /dev/whatever /dev/whatever" to duplicate a drive, which is easier to remember/understand
2011-01-04T23:56:00.000Z	stew	linux_direction	you can't trust a backup of a harddrive that you are booted from, do it from a livecd
2011-01-05T14:31:00.000Z	linux_direction	stew	and another user gave me some direction in duplicating my fresh ubu hdd install. for back up purposes. someone suggested i use the dd comand. and stew said Chat Post would be better for me coz it was a little easier.
