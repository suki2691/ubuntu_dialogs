2008-12-18T22:33:00.000Z	UUH		Hi. Noob-question incoming. I'm trying out Ubuntu (8.10) with a Live CD.
2008-12-18T22:33:00.000Z	UUH		It won't be as slow as it is now if I install it on my harddrive, right?
2008-12-18T22:33:00.000Z	wiehan	UUH	 no.
2008-12-18T22:34:00.000Z	wiehan	UUH	yes, and 100% sure it will be faster than windows
