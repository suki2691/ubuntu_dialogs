2007-01-12T06:56:00.000Z	Hansel	Scabdates	hdc is a harddrive... not sure why but apparently one of your drives is causing problems when its trying to mount.
2007-01-12T06:57:00.000Z	Hansel	Scabdates	- do you have more than 1 hdd?
2007-01-12T06:58:00.000Z	Hansel	Scabdates	- couldn't tell you... sorry.  :(  You can google for that exact error msg and see if there is a workaround.
