2008-11-24T15:58:00.000Z	SpAc		can I choose which kernel to download and install during installation - on the alternate / minimal CD image perhaps?
2008-11-24T15:58:00.000Z	Boohbah	SpAc	you can always install a custom kernel when the default install finishes before you reboot
2008-11-24T15:59:00.000Z	SpAc	Boohbah	ikonia, bazhang: thanks. I want to install the server kernel instead of the generic one. So before reboot would be the best option?
2008-11-24T16:01:00.000Z	SpAc	Boohbah	cool, cause I'm using the minimal CD image to run up a server remotely.
