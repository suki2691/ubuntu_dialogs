2005-03-23T08:48:00.000Z	JDahl	blizah	you can update your sources.list with the hoary repository, and install specific packages from hoary by writing something like "apt-get install xxx:hoary" (I dont remember the details, though, so I may be wrong). maybe read the apt-get man-page?
2005-03-23T08:48:00.000Z	JDahl	blizah	but I wouldnt mix hoary and warty... escpecially since Hoary will be released soon
