2006-12-26T16:25:00.000Z	eyalw		but how do i compile in C++, the comiler is not built in right?
2006-12-26T16:25:00.000Z	lupine_85	eyalw	no; the compiler is gcc/g++
2006-12-26T16:26:00.000Z	lupine_85		the advantage of KDevelop - for me - is that it produces all the makefiles and stuff :D
2006-12-26T16:26:00.000Z	eyalw	lupine_85	so i have to download it seperatly, right?
