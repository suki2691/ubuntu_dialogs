2008-11-08T19:35:00.000Z	NielsE		I want to install ubuntu and kubuntu on 1 partition, is this advisable, or will I get problems with conflicting knetworkmananger, the one from gnome, etc?
2008-11-08T19:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	NielsE	 you can have kubuntu-desktop and ubuntu-desktop both installed,. no need for 2 'installs'
2008-11-08T19:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	NielsE	 You may have some cluttered menus with both desktops items.. but other then that.. ive not had many issues from havin both..
2008-11-08T19:37:00.000Z	NielsE	dr_willis	yeah, but last time I tried with gutsy,  it became a total mess, I could not get on the internet with kde because of knetworkmanager
