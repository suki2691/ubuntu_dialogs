2006-01-10T16:40:00.000Z	Jowi	fek	generally. but i would advice to remove openoffice first. it borked my upgrade. just install it again after your done. oh, and install ubuntu-desktop before you dist-upgrade
2006-01-10T16:41:00.000Z	fek	Jowi	i installed OO by myself, becaus the package in hoary was bad
2006-01-10T16:41:00.000Z	Jowi	fek	yeah, same here. remove it before upgrading
