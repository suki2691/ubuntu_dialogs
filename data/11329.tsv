2012-11-23T15:16:00.000Z	auronandace	RichardH	what do you mean keyboard mapping? just use the uk layout
2012-11-23T15:17:00.000Z	auronandace	RichardH	you select the layout in the installer
2012-11-23T15:18:00.000Z	RichardH	auronandace	Thanks. Sorry, flapped when I didn't see a layout that matches the Lenovo's keyboard. Actually testing keys adjacent to enter shows they map corretly!
