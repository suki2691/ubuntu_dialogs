2009-09-29T07:43:00.000Z	c0mp13371331337		Are there any nuances to installing Vista and Ubuntu each on their own SATA drive?  I've learned that, when installing each on separate partitions of the same drive, it's best to install Ubuntu last, so grub can add Windows (something that Windows is not nice enough to do by default.) Is there anything like that I'd need to know before installing each on a separate drive?
