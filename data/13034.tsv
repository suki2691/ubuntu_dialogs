2011-06-22T06:26:00.000Z	devral	chaddy	doing so asks if i wish to remove the ubuntu-desktop package :|
2011-06-22T06:26:00.000Z	chaddy	devral	you probably don't ;)
2011-06-22T06:31:00.000Z	devral	chaddy	i did an apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop and byobu (the --purge said those 2 were broken), but now it shows ubuntu-desktop: Depends: screen but it is not installable
