2007-04-04T09:13:00.000Z	ravi_master	Aw0L	welcome to a fast package management system...
2007-04-04T09:14:00.000Z	Aw0L	ravi_master	like I said, I like debian's package management system, definitely better than any commercial distro - but I think gentoo's portage is a bit more powerful
2007-04-04T09:16:00.000Z	ravi_master	Aw0L	you'll see the advantages in apt-get over portage sooner or later, it's a give and take game
2007-04-04T09:16:00.000Z	Aw0L	ravi_master	I can't see how apt-get is can ever be as powerful as portage - but I would prefer a debian server for some uses
