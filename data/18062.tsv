2012-05-16T00:32:00.000Z	kaddi		Hi guys, I upgraded to 12.04 yesterday and ever since then skype crashes during the identification with this error message;  Inconsistency detected by ld.so: dl-open.c: 667: _dl_open: Assertion `_dl_debug_initialize (0, args.nsid)->r_state == RT_CONSISTENT' failed! Is there any fix? I tried the static version with no success
2012-05-16T00:34:00.000Z	kaddi		is there an alternative client for the skype protocol besides skype?
2012-05-16T00:35:00.000Z	kaddi		but with pidgin, don't you need to have skype installed and it just launches skype?
