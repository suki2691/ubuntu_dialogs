2007-07-01T07:53:00.000Z	eternalswd		anyone have any experience building gnome from the repos in the source.  I have some code I want to modify in the gnome source tree (relating to gtkstatusicon) but I would like to install it so that it creates the debs and installs those.

2007-07-01T07:55:00.000Z	mattyv	eternalswd	do you know about checkinstall? I think that creates deb packages of source installations. That's about all I know though
2007-07-01T07:57:00.000Z	eternalswd	mattyv	I believe when downloading compiling source from the repos, it's set up so that all the *-dev packages and gnome-common etc are actually named correctly, but I could be mistaken
