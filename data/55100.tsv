2010-10-18T04:26:00.000Z	Fezzler		I need help getting video to run in Ubuntu Lucid FireFox.  I have latest Flash.  Audio is great.  Video plays like a series of still images that lag audio.

2010-10-18T04:28:00.000Z	edbian	Fezzler	I suggest getting vlc and watching the videos with that.  Firefox convieniently puts them in /tmp
