2008-10-04T20:39:00.000Z	unop	The-Compiler	you mean you want to rename that folder from "8bp001" to "8bp087"?
2008-10-04T20:40:00.000Z	The-Compiler	unop	nope, that wouldn't be any problem :D I want to make dirs numerated from 8bp001 up to 8bp087
2008-10-04T20:40:00.000Z	unop	The-Compiler	fresh directories, empty ones?
