2012-08-22T09:25:00.000Z	rollitup		Hi I have been experiencing strange behavior on my Ubuntu desktop, like the wrong keys keep appearing on the screen, applications keep opening up like the calculator , could this be a hack attempt ?
2012-08-22T09:26:00.000Z	cfhowlett	rollitup	possibly but I'd check my keyboard settings first to ensure it's configured correctly
2012-08-22T09:36:00.000Z	cfhowlett	rollitup	ok.  well, if you're sure there has been no liquid contamination, the keyboard settings are correct, the keyboard works and is plugged in and no keys are stuck ...
2012-08-22T09:37:00.000Z	cfhowlett	rollitup	happens with another keyboard then it's NOT the keyboard.
