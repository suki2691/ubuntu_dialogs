2011-06-21T19:59:00.000Z	owenm		Hi all. Running 10.04, just apt-get update && upgraded on my server. I'm stuck at a screen for grub-pc informing me that I have chose not to install grub to any devices, and asks if I want to continue without installing grub. Anyone seen this? I can file a bug if needed.

2011-06-21T20:00:00.000Z	owenm	wx4nc	no kernel update
2011-06-21T20:01:00.000Z	wx4nc	owenm	Action just nailed it. Just go right along with it and it should work out fine. I remember I had a server do that once as well
