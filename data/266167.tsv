2007-06-08T11:25:00.000Z	pyoro		i installed recently the ubuntu 7.10 64bits version, its the first time i use linux based os, so i practically know nothing, im having problems with ceratin wifi drivers, java, flash, etc. so i wanted to change to 32 bits version, i think it would be easyer for now, to get involved and later on install the otrher one, the thing is that when i boot the pc with the 32bit version (also with the 64) and want to install the system gets stucked
2007-06-08T11:26:00.000Z	pyoro		it wont run by anyway
2007-06-08T11:26:00.000Z	pyoro		yes
