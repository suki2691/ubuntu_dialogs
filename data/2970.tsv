2012-05-20T20:07:00.000Z	DoctorMonocular		hey L3Top, a little update -- I tried putting that new config info into .bash_profile, and .profile, and I thought I'd cracked the case when I found at the end of my .bashrc file a line refining the PATH, but removing that didn't help. So I'm still at the point where I can run ruby if I manually source bash_profile when I open a terminal, and I still can't run rails because it's looking for a wonky path to ruby1.8. What do you
2012-05-20T20:07:00.000Z	DoctorMonocular		think could cause bash_profile to not load?
2012-05-20T20:09:00.000Z	Darael	DoctorMonocular	As I recall, .profile and family only load in a login shell, which your standard terminal emulator is not.  Stick the lines (whatever they are; I just came in) in .bashrc instead?
2012-05-20T20:12:00.000Z	DoctorMonocular	Darael	yeah I did that, and it works, but I was afraid I was doing something wrong, I'm really new to all this and I don't know exactly where stuff should sit
