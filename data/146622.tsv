2009-12-08T18:50:00.000Z	Church		IIRC now xmarks (former foxmarks) now support chromium aswell, so i wonder if chromium is stable enough for generic heavy browsing to make switch
2009-12-08T18:50:00.000Z	Church		for some time absence of that extention for chromium kept me from trying out, as it's 'must have' plugin for me :)0
