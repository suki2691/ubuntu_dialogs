2008-02-04T20:27:00.000Z	wyclif		can someone explain to me how a package on the Canonical CD could be flagged with a warning upon install?
2008-02-04T20:27:00.000Z	wyclif		i now get two drop-downs in the "Summary" pop-up under Synaptic.  "NOT AUTHENTICATED" and "To be installed."  Both drop down lists contain the same packages.  I don't get it.
2008-02-04T20:28:00.000Z	wyclif		network is slow
2008-02-04T20:28:00.000Z	iNeo	wyclif	via commandline: apt-get update and then apt-get upgrade
