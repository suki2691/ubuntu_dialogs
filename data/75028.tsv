2008-11-28T04:45:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	Smegzor1	i hat a bttv card and it always worked without any parametes (autodetect) are you sure you need these?
2008-11-28T04:47:00.000Z	Smegzor1	zsquareplusc	I got this card specifically because it is supposed to work well. I could try removing the module stuff, but it didn't work out of the box either originally.
