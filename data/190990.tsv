2006-04-14T14:20:00.000Z	Vge		somebody can tell me why i can use web based IRC but not my Konversation or IRssi?
2006-04-14T14:20:00.000Z	eyequeue	Vge	definitively? no.  a guess, sure
2006-04-14T14:21:00.000Z	eyequeue	Vge	many workplace firewalls consider irc a security risk, and block port 6667, but not 80 ... that would do it
2006-04-14T14:22:00.000Z	Vge	eyequeue	well it works with my old kernel, not with the new, so im kinda lost
