2010-02-10T06:35:00.000Z	atx		hey guys
2010-02-10T06:35:00.000Z	atx		want to launch an application through the command line, but want it to be independent
2010-02-10T06:36:00.000Z	atx		so I can still continue using the command line after the application launches
2010-02-10T06:36:00.000Z	Ten-Eight	atx	if you open another terminal window you can.
