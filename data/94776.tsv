2010-06-14T19:47:00.000Z	matteo1990		 Hi all, i have an Nvidia Geforce 8400 Gs on an Ubuntu 10.04 machine with current driver installed (nvidia settings tell me that is the 195). I always see 1080p films on my tv so i use mplayer with vdpau. I get sometimes a bunch of pixels not changing colr for a while... What can i do? Do i need to buy a better video-card? Do i need to change the drivers? Is fault of Mplayer?
