2006-09-21T10:15:00.000Z	Ace_NoOne		I have problems running the (K)Ubuntu live CD(s); everything's incredibly slow (and I mean REALLY slow)! However, I guess that's not normal, as the Knoppix live CD runs a lot faster - is it possible that Ubuntu does not use the hard drive as temporary RAM extension?
2006-09-21T10:16:00.000Z	Ace_NoOne		Also, I have 128 MB RAM, but when I go to the boot menu's advanced options, it says something like RAM_DISK_SIZE=10248578 - is that correct?
