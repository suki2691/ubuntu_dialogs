2006-08-28T15:14:00.000Z	ndee		hello there, I'm a php developer and I totally wanna switch to ubuntu/linux. We also use linux as a staging server, now my question: Whenever I edit files on the remote server, I do that thru ftp and it's pretty unreliable etc. Is there a way to "map" another linux volume over the internet, without going thru FTP?
