2005-05-22T10:47:00.000Z	Burgundavia	gp_aaron	ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage that has deps for the all default desktop things
2005-05-22T10:47:00.000Z	Burgundavia	gp_aaron	you can safely remove it, just remember to reinstall it just before you upgrade
2005-05-22T10:48:00.000Z	Burgundavia	gp_aaron	the programs are already installed
