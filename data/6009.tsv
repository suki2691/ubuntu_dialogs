2012-04-28T22:42:00.000Z	kapz		help guys I am lost now....fresh install ubuntu 12.04, installation finishes successfully, however after reboot system cannot boot i.e like there is no grub or bootloader....I installed twice now
2012-04-28T22:44:00.000Z	kapz		wat! no-one with ANY hint?
2012-04-28T22:45:00.000Z	dj_segfault	kapz	Did you try booting from the LiveCD and choosing the boot from hard drive option?  If that works you can have it reinstall the bootloader
2012-04-28T22:48:00.000Z	kapz	dj_segfault	when i insert live cd the only options are try install, I also get this missing prefix error before grub boots
