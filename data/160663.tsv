2007-09-04T14:57:00.000Z	EvilBro		Does anyone here use evolution 2.10.1 with bogofilter 1.1.3 on Feisty?
2007-09-04T14:59:00.000Z	EvilBro		Anyone running evolution with bogofilter succesfully?
2007-09-04T15:01:00.000Z	EvilBro		So out of the 1042 people here, not one was able to get evolution running with bogofilter?
2007-09-04T15:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	EvilBro	Considering that I have never even heard of bogofilter why is that surprising?
