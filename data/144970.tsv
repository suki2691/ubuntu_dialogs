2007-12-31T06:00:00.000Z	new2KDE		hello, i have been using linux (ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10) for about a year now and recently wanted to switch from gnome to KDE so i switched to suse 10.3 i am just wondering if Kubuntu's delivery of KDE is any better or easier than suse?
2007-12-31T06:02:00.000Z	new2KDE		also i have an ati video card and ubuntu 7.10 had great drivers for me but suse is crap will kubuntu have the same great drivers for me?
2007-12-31T06:04:00.000Z	new2KDE		when i installed ubuntu 7.10 my drivers and everything just worked.. will that happen with kubuntu?
