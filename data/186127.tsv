2007-03-02T15:51:00.000Z	famicommie		can someone answer a quick question on cron jobs for me?
2007-03-02T15:51:00.000Z	famicommie		I wrote a script to execute fetchmail, and placed it in the /etc/cron.hourly folder
2007-03-02T15:51:00.000Z	famicommie		What else do I have to do to get it to run?
2007-03-02T15:52:00.000Z	ikonia_	famicommie	I never use that method - I normaly just crontab -e and put the script in
