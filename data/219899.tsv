2007-07-04T10:02:00.000Z	Flannel	dimas869	Does the cam work with Ubuntu normally?
2007-07-04T10:03:00.000Z	Flannel	dimas869	Ah, well... It's a flash issue then ;)  Did you allow flash to view your webcam with the flash popup config thing?
2007-07-04T10:05:00.000Z	Flannel	dimas869	No idea.  Sorry.  But at least you know it's not because your CAM's drivers
