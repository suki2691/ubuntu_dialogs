2008-10-21T19:51:00.000Z	Slart	beautifulsnow	ah.. hang on.. I'll take a look, see if I can find anything
2008-10-21T20:00:00.000Z	Slart	beautifulsnow	hmm.. I took a look in gconf-editor.. there are lots of shortcuts for nautilus and metacity.. but as far as I could tell it was all keyboard stuff. notthing for the mouse
