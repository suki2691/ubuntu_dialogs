2011-07-10T11:44:00.000Z	mkquist		anyone have experience with booting fedora and ubuntu?  Does Fedora not 'play nice' with ubuntu?  As in I can install Win7 Ubuntu and Ubuntu sees Win7, but when I install Fedora, it doesnt 'see' Ubuntu...

2011-07-10T11:48:00.000Z	mkquist	atomicfusion	been using ubuntu for quite some time, just tried to install fedora and it didnt 'see' ubuntu.  Reinstalled ubuntu and it saw all of the others just fine.  Just curious if Fedora is a bit predatory...
