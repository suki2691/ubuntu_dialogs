2012-11-18T19:12:00.000Z	LinuxFreakD		I am transfering 950 GB from one SATAII HDD to another, both plugged into motherboard. Source drive is ext4 and destination drive is ntfs. It said 23 hours to transfer. Isn't that rather slow, as in I should be looking into fixing it?

2012-11-18T19:13:00.000Z	LinuxFreakD	bekks	ah ok. Thanks. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't sitting here unnecessarily long.
2012-11-18T19:17:00.000Z	LinuxFreakD	bekks	what if I changed the partition to fat32 about how long would you say it would take to transfer 950 gigs to it/
