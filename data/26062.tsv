2010-11-14T10:31:00.000Z	Some_Person	rusivi	I will (Windows XP is installing on the machine at this very moment, so I can't), but that won't tell me if the proprietary driver works because it's not loaded on the live CD
2010-11-14T10:32:00.000Z	Some_Person	rusivi	I'm not even sure if a decent nvidia driver is on the live CD. I seem to remember getting a crappy resolution when I ran the Lucid CD, though I may be remembering wrong
