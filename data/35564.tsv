2010-03-20T19:43:00.000Z	Arthur___		question is 64 bit ubuntu going to work flawless on a fresh install? i am looking at the software issues any? like in the repos? and java and flash, i was reading in the forums about having to do some fancy command-line stuff to get flash working? the posts look to be better than a year old, or is that not an issue any more?
2010-03-20T19:45:00.000Z	Arthur___		well i have a 64 bit computer now and wanted to know if flash works like installing ubuntu-restricted-xtras or am i going to have to do a walk around?
