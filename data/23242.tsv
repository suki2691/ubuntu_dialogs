2010-11-02T13:02:00.000Z	sugoruyo	h4x0rbOy	why would i do that?
2010-11-02T13:04:00.000Z	h4x0rbOy	sugoruyo	Cause DD-WRT supports DNSMasq.
2010-11-02T13:05:00.000Z	sugoruyo	h4x0rbOy	ok, but i have 4 machines that are always on so why not setup dnsmasq on one of them rather than go get a device to run dd-wrt on?
