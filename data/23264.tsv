2010-11-01T23:32:00.000Z	woobi		Ok I have my home folder in its own encrypted partition. I would like to loose the encryption and go back to a standard home partition. How do i do this?
2010-11-01T23:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	woobi	copy the /home files to a non encrypted folder/partition. modify /etc/fstab to reflect the changes?
2010-11-01T23:35:00.000Z	woobi	erUSUL	I was looking for something a little faster, 2TB home folder.
2010-11-01T23:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	woobi	i do not see how you can transform an encrypted device faster and without data loss
