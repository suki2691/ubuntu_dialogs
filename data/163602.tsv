2006-10-19T11:53:00.000Z	ww2		Hello all. I need some help here. Trying to make XGL/Beryl work. I have the latest fglrx ATI proprietary drivers (which I made sure were working fine before the XGL installation), and when I start the XGL session through GDM I see to Beryl effects at all. The first time I started XGL I saw the splash screen, but then everything froze with strange lines and I had to reboot. I did search the forums and wasn`t able to find a solution. Can someone help me?
