2008-11-29T08:26:00.000Z	newbnewb		I've screwed up my theme (font, buttons, et cetera)... is there an easy way to fix this, or at least an easy gui to use that can fix all of this I need to apt-get?  Theme are apparently not the easiest to install here.  I am a new ubuntu user.
2008-11-29T08:27:00.000Z	newbnewb		I don't see a System -> Preferences -> Theme manager
2008-11-29T08:27:00.000Z	DistroJockey	newbnewb	change to a different theme using  System - Preferences - Appearance
