2007-03-18T06:45:00.000Z	dn4		hello
2007-03-18T06:46:00.000Z	dn4		I was wondering how does the Feisty release work if I was to use herd-5 right now, and later wanted to upgrade when a final release was done int april?
2007-03-18T06:46:00.000Z	jrib	dn4	#ubuntu+1 for feisty, but you would just dist-upgrade on release day
2009-04-03T05:27:00.000Z	jrib	dn4	it has pidgin for irc already
