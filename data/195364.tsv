2008-10-25T05:17:00.000Z	kitche	cs_student	did you install sun-java6-jre?
2008-10-25T05:17:00.000Z	kitche	cs_student	then you would need to run something like dpkg-configure java or something like that I don't know the exact syntax for the java vm switch command
2008-10-25T05:18:00.000Z	kitche	cs_student	well your using gij not sun java
