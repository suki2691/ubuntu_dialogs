2009-03-08T22:48:00.000Z	fafaz	unop	why? I did that and it works !
2009-03-08T22:49:00.000Z	unop	fafaz	yes it works - but it's not recommended .. unless you want to sit here 24hours a day supporting people with issues that come about after this command.
2009-03-08T22:51:00.000Z	fafaz	unop	OK, so give a reference to why it's not recommended
