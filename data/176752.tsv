2008-02-05T07:12:00.000Z	JusticeZero		Hi, I need to shut down the X server to install the Nvidia driver (having graphics issues, new install, want to see if using Nvidia's driver helps) What do I do to do that so I can run the driver install?
2008-02-05T07:13:00.000Z	BaKKaR	JusticeZero	o > sudo init 3 .. and then run the NVidia binary
2008-02-05T07:14:00.000Z	BaKKaR	JusticeZero	or better off, Ubuntu utsy installs that by defult
2008-02-05T07:17:00.000Z	BaKKaR	JusticeZero	this is th open-source driver .. try the NVidia binary closed-srouse one.
