2007-05-23T06:49:00.000Z	Nyg		Hi Guys, I'm after some advice regarding running ubuntu under windows.  I have tried windows virtual pc 2007 and it seems pretty rubbish.  What is the best bet (other than installing is fully)
2007-05-23T06:50:00.000Z	Nyg		player or server?
2007-05-23T06:50:00.000Z	aoirthoir	Nyg	try vmware player ..if you are just looking for a basic gnu/linux you might try puppy
2007-05-23T06:50:00.000Z	aoirthoir	Nyg	but if you want the full ubuntu, the vmware will work. but it is proprietary.
