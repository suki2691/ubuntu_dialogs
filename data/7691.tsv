2011-12-19T20:53:00.000Z	jutnux	Scarra3	What is the problem?
2011-12-19T21:09:00.000Z	Scarra3	jutnux	 Well its my video card I have an integrated one and one in the PCI slot I install ubuntu and the boot screen is all choppy, its mainly black but the top has multiple colors then I install the restricted drivers and then there is a purple boot screen but no the ubuntu name with the loading bar than later on the word with the loading bar shows up on a later reboot but its really big and pixilated
