2008-12-18T01:25:00.000Z	cellofellow	danielbw	that's called cross-compiling. I don't know how to do it but that might give you some googling tips.
2008-12-18T01:25:00.000Z	danielbw	cellofellow	ok how can i tell which application installed a particular file?
2008-12-18T01:25:00.000Z	cellofellow	danielbw	dpkg -S /path/to/file
