2012-11-24T20:04:00.000Z	Ben_at		Hi everyone, I'm trying to do a fresh install of ubuntu so want to completely whipe my current version off and start fresh. I'm not to sure how I go about acheiving this though. I'm running the live disk now and my hdd looks like this: http://i50.tinypic.com/34hgjh5.png do I just delete  /dev/sda4/  then re-install from disk ?
