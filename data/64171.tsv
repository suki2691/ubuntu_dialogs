2009-12-10T00:12:00.000Z	Kingsy101		can someone tell me how much more processing power ubuntu 9.10 needs that 8.04 ? much more?
2009-12-10T00:13:00.000Z	Kingsy101		i.e if my PC is pretty slow but its running 8.04 fine, would an upgrade to 9.10 hinder performance?
2009-12-10T00:13:00.000Z	Kingsy101		cooool :) thanks guys
