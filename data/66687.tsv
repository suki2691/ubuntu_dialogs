2009-02-09T01:50:00.000Z	Grok4242	shwan	Or does ubuntu not run ssh server by default?  I haven't run it very long but I can't imagine a Linux box without ssh server
2009-02-09T01:51:00.000Z	shwan	Grok4242	I think there is no ssh by default , not sure
2009-02-09T01:55:00.000Z	shwan	Grok4242	I checked it out now , you need to install openssh-server in order to get ssh in to the box , the client is standard by the way
