2011-08-13T08:35:00.000Z	Rask		I don't really know where but here to begin with this one... it's very strange.  I just upgraded a system running ubuntu server 10.04 to 10.10 and then 11.04, and since then I've noticed an odd behavior in repeating keys in irssi.
2011-08-13T08:36:00.000Z	Rask		If I press a letter key or backspace or pretty much anything but an arrow key, it repeats as normal, but if I press and hold an arrow key, it moves once, but does not repeat - but then when I release the key, the cursor assumes the position it would have taken if it had been repeating
2011-08-13T08:36:00.000Z	Rask		I'm running irssi through screen through SSH.  Does anyone have any idea what this could possibly be?  <:)
