2008-07-21T06:42:00.000Z	neuromit		How can I list the packages I've recently installed in the terminal?
2008-07-21T06:43:00.000Z	neuromit		I'm having some weird color issues with mplayer, movies are getting a strong BLUE hue
2008-07-21T06:45:00.000Z	glitsj16	neuromit	have you tried experimenting with mplayer's video settings to check if it occurs on all available drivers ? better yet, if it improves by changing to a different one ?
2008-07-21T06:45:00.000Z	neuromit	glitsj16	thanks I'll try that
