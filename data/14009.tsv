2011-11-22T19:53:00.000Z	jtreminio		Morning all - I'm looking for a purdy email client to replace my gmail. I don't like thunderbird/evolution for the eyecandy. Any thoughts?
2011-11-22T19:53:00.000Z	sipior	jtreminio	what are your feelings about a terminal-based client?
2011-11-22T19:54:00.000Z	jtreminio	sipior	my feelings are that I would go crazy. I need to handle 3 gmail accounts from the one gui
2011-11-22T19:55:00.000Z	sipior	jtreminio	actually, most text-based clients (like Mutt) are actually easier to use with many disparate accounts. automatic filtering, rule-based envelope headers, &cet.
