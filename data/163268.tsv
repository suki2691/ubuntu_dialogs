2010-10-28T06:08:00.000Z	Praxi	easy_enemy	so you had a dual boot, removed linux, and now xp won't boot? if so boot of a windows disc, goto console and do a fdisk /mbr
2010-10-28T06:10:00.000Z	Praxi	easy_enemy	fdisk /mbr
2010-10-28T06:15:00.000Z	Praxi	easy_enemy	fdisk /mbr is the windows way of rebuilding its bootloader, IdleOne  linked you how to fix grub itself
