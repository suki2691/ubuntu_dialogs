2010-08-12T15:21:00.000Z	xerxex		after the last update my dvd:copy and dvd95 converter un-installed and won't get installed again...mplayer crashed (I fixed it now by installing ffmpeg), does anyone know why I cannot install my dvd apps?

2010-08-12T15:24:00.000Z	phlak_user	xerxex	ok so what errors do you get
2010-08-12T15:25:00.000Z	phlak_user	xerxex	ah so you need the pgp key for the repo
