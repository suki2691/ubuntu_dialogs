2009-11-14T15:18:00.000Z	nvme	m4rtin	yes but its not letting me get read/write permissions past the root directory when i mount manually
2009-11-14T15:19:00.000Z	nvme		grr thsi is so annoying can someone just give me the command for mounting it with rw permissions
2009-11-14T15:19:00.000Z	m4rtin	nvme	try a manual mount then ls -ltrd
