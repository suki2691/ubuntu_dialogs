2011-09-24T17:20:00.000Z	Caternam		i have a vga problem: on live-cd 10.10 i had low res, but it worked fine (GeForce gtx460) - on 11.04 live-cd the resolution goes up, but the screen goes blank every few secs as if the graphiccard resets. So I just wanted to ask where I can read about editing the disc-image, just need to know what I have to edit.
