2006-09-20T09:37:00.000Z	JackONeill		If I use a USB pen on linux and I hardly ever take it out and put an entry in the fstab.. can I rely on it being ready when linux is booted?
2006-09-20T09:38:00.000Z	JackONeill		Anyone got a yes or a no here?
2006-09-20T09:38:00.000Z	JackONeill		Yes means that it can be done.... no means it can't be done :P
2006-09-20T09:39:00.000Z	Mortice	JackONeill	why bother putting it in the fstab? The way ubuntu handles usb drives, it should pick it up whenever it's plugged in
