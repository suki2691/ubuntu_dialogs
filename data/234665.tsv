2005-10-26T11:06:00.000Z	dooglus	joshua	there are several files you can run from the bittorrent package, as follows: btcompletedir.bittorrent btdownloadcurses.bittorrent btdownloadheadless.bittorrent btlaunchmany.bittorrent btlaunchmanycurses.bittorrent btmakemetafile.bittorrent btreannounce.bittorrent btrename.bittorrent btshowmetainfo.bittorrent bttrack.bittorrent
