2007-04-02T16:18:00.000Z	Jawshie		Ok. This is an insanely large community... certainly somebody will be willing to help me :P      I want to install Feisty beta or RC when it comes out on my machine to get its usability asap but dont want to have to completely reinstall when the final comes out. Is there an upgrade path or an apt-get for it when it comes out or does anybody know?

2007-04-02T16:21:00.000Z	delsvr	Jawshie	just direct the mirrors to look at Feisty
2007-04-02T16:22:00.000Z	delsvr	Jawshie	are you on Dapper now?
