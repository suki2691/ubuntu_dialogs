2005-02-13T11:45:00.000Z	newter		Any one know how to get around a lockup after the 2nd stage of the install.  There are no errors durring the boot procress, it just locks up on the beggening after it gets booted to the welcome screen to start system configuration?

2005-02-13T11:46:00.000Z	JDahl	newter	you could try to boot with acpi=off and see if it makes a difference
2005-02-13T11:49:00.000Z	newter	JDahl	would it use the same boot settings I set on the first install process or would I have to give it the options at the 2nd stage boot process.
