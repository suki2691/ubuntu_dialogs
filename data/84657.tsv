2008-07-24T22:03:00.000Z	sk33t0r		Im trying to connect to an SMB printer on a winxp machine.. and everytime I use gnome-cups-add and select an SMB server.. it prompts me for a username and password.. I dont have a username and password set on my winxp machine so what do I do??
2008-07-24T22:04:00.000Z	SaintStewart	sk33t0r	for me, I never enter a password...I just hit ok and it works.
2008-07-24T22:06:00.000Z	SaintStewart	sk33t0r	Have you tried just leaving the default info it brings up when asking for a password and just hitting enter?
2008-07-24T22:07:00.000Z	SaintStewart	sk33t0r	Aye, thats the point.  When it brings up the box asking for a password, just click ok, dont put a pass in.  See what happens.  When I have to connect to my wifes XP machine, I dont enter any passwords and it just connects.
