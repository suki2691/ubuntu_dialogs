2008-02-16T18:31:00.000Z	Gatorgrad		I'm back with another noob question.  I just installed (at least I think I did) Truecrypt.  Where do I find the icon to run the program?  I can't find it in the Applications list.
2008-02-16T18:33:00.000Z	xoai	Gatorgrad	I haven't use it but just try open terminal and run truecrypt command
2008-02-16T18:34:00.000Z	Gatorgrad	xoai	I'm such a noob, I don't really know how to do that.
2008-02-16T18:35:00.000Z	Gatorgrad	xoai	Ok, I opened terminal and typed "truecrypt" The program opened.  Thats cool but can't I get it to list in the applications so I don't need to do it that way?
