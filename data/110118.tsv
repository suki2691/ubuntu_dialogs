2007-12-11T02:16:00.000Z	DDuong	rparkhurst	 depends what you want to do with it
2007-12-11T02:16:00.000Z	rparkhurst	DDuong	 sync it with evolution and tether with it
2007-12-11T02:19:00.000Z	DDuong	rparkhurst	 hrmmm that I'm not sure of.  The only thing I know is that you can charge your bb in linux (of course you have to downlad a program to do that)
