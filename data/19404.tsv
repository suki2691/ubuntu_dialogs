2012-08-24T01:11:00.000Z	Night-hacks		I just installed cinnamon and i saw gnome classic in the sessions options, was it already there !!? or cinnamon installed it ?!
2012-08-24T01:11:00.000Z	k1l	Night-hacks	gnome-classic comes with the gnome3 base
2012-08-24T01:12:00.000Z	k1l	Night-hacks	erm, it comes when you install the gnome-shell.
2012-08-24T01:12:00.000Z	k1l	Night-hacks	its the 2d fallback from the gnome-shell
