2005-06-04T10:46:00.000Z	scythe	mojo	k3b, and if burning is slow, you might want to check and see if dma is turned on for you drive
2005-06-04T10:47:00.000Z	mojo	scythe	 no, it just sits there FOREVER making WAVs from the files with mpeg123...  I was hoping for something that could burn right from the mp3s.  Also support for FLAC and SHN would be nice, since I have a lot of those (ima deadhead)
2005-06-04T10:48:00.000Z	scythe	mojo	k3b has support for flac
