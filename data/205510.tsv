2006-12-19T16:37:00.000Z	prxq		anywhere I could download all kernel modules for i386?
2006-12-19T16:37:00.000Z	EdLin	prxq	just get the kernel source.
2006-12-19T16:39:00.000Z	prxq	EdLin	I was wondering if there is a package where they all come precompiled (for i386)
2006-12-19T16:40:00.000Z	EdLin	prxq	tell the kernel to be entirely modular - warning, you *will* need a heck of an initrd card so the kernel can read your hard drive after you've done that.
