2004-11-29T10:40:00.000Z	m_tthew	BrittBS	I lost screenshot as well, I would assume it'll be back eventually.
2004-11-29T10:41:00.000Z	BrittBS	m_tthew	ok not just me then :) wonder if it was a design thing ... I'm sure it doesn't have a rediculous ammount of use cased for joe blow but I find it pretty handy
2004-11-29T10:44:00.000Z	m_tthew	BrittBS	: did you lose your ability to listen to your line in, by any chance?
