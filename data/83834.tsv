2009-06-10T06:10:00.000Z	pulaski		Hello,  Can someone take a look and suggest other dependencies I may need? I'm trying to build the source package rbmake-1.2.tar.gz.  ./configure seemed to work ok.  The ./configure output is posted here: http://paste.ubuntu.com:80/192073/ However make gave me errors.  The output is posted here: http://paste.ubuntu.com:80/192073/.
