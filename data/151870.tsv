2008-09-13T22:43:00.000Z	whileimhere		Hi out there! I am looking for information about how to boot Ubuntu without the GDM or any desktop. Ideally I would like to boot into the Frame Buffer or into a plain X Session. Is there a good set of instructions out there on this subject?
2008-09-13T22:44:00.000Z	whileimhere		What I am tying to do is boot into a program called Wah!Cade
2008-09-13T22:44:00.000Z	jdnewmil	whileimhere	: what is a "plain X session" with no window manager?
2008-09-13T22:46:00.000Z	whileimhere	jdnewmil	I am trying to get my arcade cabinet to boot directly into Wah!Cade (an arcade frontend). The less that I have running the better it will work with MAME.
