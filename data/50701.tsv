2009-10-27T13:38:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe		i will appearantly have to reinstall windows, as i need it to run some programs that i need at school. If i install it on the same drive with ubuntu (because it appearantly won't install on a external hdd) it will most probably overwrite the mbr. So, my question, is there any possibility, after the installation of windows, to modify the mbr, so that I can dual boot windows and ubuntu, without rein
