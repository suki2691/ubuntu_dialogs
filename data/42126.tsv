2010-01-07T07:33:00.000Z	aiwata55		I have a question regarding Ubuntu + Drupal.  According to this guy, it seems that a mail server is not necessary (http://groups.drupal.org/node/22401#comment-77421).  Is this true?
2010-01-07T07:34:00.000Z	aiwata55		When I set up a new Drupal installation, Drupal alerts me that there is no mail server, therefore it couldn't send a e-mail to the admin user.

2010-01-07T07:36:00.000Z	aiwata55	Takyoji	 thank you for your advice.  I know i can solve my issue once I install a mail server.  Actually once I tried Postfix.  But my concern is the more services I open, the more vulnerability I put into my server.
