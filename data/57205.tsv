2009-05-15T18:05:00.000Z	Wout		Hello everyone, i'm a newbie to ubuntu but i'm here to ask a question, is there a kind of wine project for mac programs ?
2009-05-15T18:07:00.000Z	Wout		@pici, i think it is not that difficult. Mac is builed on a freebsd kernel.

2009-05-15T18:10:00.000Z	Wout	kholerabbi	I run mac on a intel pc (p4). So it must be possible, maybe a project that i can make XD
