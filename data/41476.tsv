2009-12-15T17:29:00.000Z	JustMozzy		tweaked: come to think of it... I would anyway need only to delete the files as all folders would have a .svn folder in it
2009-12-15T17:30:00.000Z	cast	JustMozzy	whats the point of this exercise? to get a clean svn tree?
2009-12-15T17:32:00.000Z	JustMozzy	cast	I am replacing contents in a folder but to be sure that all the non-needed files are removed from SVN I want to remove all files and put the new content in it. just deleting the whole folders would give me errors
2009-12-15T17:33:00.000Z	JustMozzy	cast	I could just delete the whole folder on the SVN server and then do everything but it takes too long
