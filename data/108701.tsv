2010-05-11T18:50:00.000Z	blablab		Hi! I have installed recently Lucid on a desktop, its running smoothly, but I noticed that SOME files that I try to delete from Lucid are bypassing the trash. Trash bypassing (it actually tries to send the file to trash but it prints an error msg like: cant send to trash, permanently delete only) seems to apply to any file located on another partition than where Lucid is (in my system case...
