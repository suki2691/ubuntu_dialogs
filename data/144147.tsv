2007-07-05T06:12:00.000Z	smev9		does the external drive need drivers under windows?
2007-07-05T06:12:00.000Z	Ltar	smev9	no, it was recognised as a normal mass-sotrage device under windows
2007-07-05T06:13:00.000Z	Ltar	smev9	Prior to installing NTFS-3g, I was able to access files, however, now I am only able to see folders. It mounts automatically when I plug it in. my internal NTFS drive works perfectly with NTFS-3g
