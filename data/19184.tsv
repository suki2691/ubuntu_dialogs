2012-10-06T20:15:00.000Z	stuwat		I would like to re-install Ubuntu on my Windows 7 dual boot machine. Is it a simple matter of deleting the existing Ubuntu partition and doing a fresh install?

2012-10-06T20:17:00.000Z	ThinkT510	stuwat	you could just reformat if you want to keep the same partition sizes
