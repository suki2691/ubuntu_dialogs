2009-10-30T16:33:00.000Z	Bodsda		Anyone reported an issue with ubuntu.com or packages.ubuntu.com?
2009-10-30T16:35:00.000Z	DJones	Bodsda	There have been a few comments that *.ubuntu.com sites & services seem to be having problems or are very slow
2009-10-30T16:35:00.000Z	Bodsda		can anyone test packages.ubuntu.com for me -- see if you can search and click to download on a package
2009-10-30T16:36:00.000Z	Bodsda	DJones	ah, ok cheers -- a traceroute shows that problems begin once hitting eth0.peumo.canonical.com
