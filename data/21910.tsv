2011-06-16T03:44:00.000Z	sburwood1		How can I get my IDE hard drives to work?  I'm using SATA, but want to recover from the IDE hard drives.  When I try a LiveCD and with the hard drive connected by the IDE thing and the power supply, the hard drive is not recognized
2011-06-16T03:44:00.000Z	sburwood1		I tried with the jumpers, but it is like the hard drive doesn't exist
2011-06-16T03:46:00.000Z	robin0800	sburwood1	I found with two hard drives the live cd would only see one of them had to use the alternate cd to see both
2011-06-16T03:48:00.000Z	sburwood1	robin0800	I tried each hard drive seperately.  The 100GB works now that I formatted it, but I haven't found a solution for the 250GB one
