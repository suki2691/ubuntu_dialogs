2008-08-09T01:22:00.000Z	jarnos		Hi! Is there a package for minisip in Ubuntu. Page http://www.minisip.org/download.html#Linux suggest's there exist's one for Debian.

2008-08-09T01:24:00.000Z	jarnos	infinitycircuit	Yes. And the package creation system is broken as they state in the www page. But maybe I can build the software from source.
2008-08-09T01:24:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	jarnos	you probably can
