2011-04-09T05:15:00.000Z	Evildaemon		I need to forensically image a truecrypt drive, (No I'm not going to try and crack it from scratch, I have the key, or at least 90% of the key, I just need to get a disk image in case I screw up.) how do I determine the mount point so I can point dd at it?
2011-04-09T05:16:00.000Z	Evildaemon		Entire drive. (And yes, it's mine.)
2011-04-09T05:18:00.000Z	Evildaemon		You know, when people give me simple answers like that (and they work) I start to question my competency. Thank you.
