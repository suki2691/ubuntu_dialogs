2008-10-26T22:16:00.000Z	volvo		I'm trying to do a fresh install of ubuntu 8.04.1 and I've wasted 4 cds already. Everytime it fails saying cd/dvd fault, clean the lens or whatever. I've burned at diff. speeds and redownloaded the iso just in case to no avail.

2008-10-26T22:17:00.000Z	volvo	kc8pxy	i dont think its bad media cause i redownloaded it. and i've used this drive to install ubuntu before it never gave me any trouble
2008-10-26T22:18:00.000Z	kc8pxy	volvo	i think i agree..  but drives do go bad.
