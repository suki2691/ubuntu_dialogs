2010-04-04T22:13:00.000Z	_numbers		im watching a flash video in firefox. i like to keep the window always on top and floating. i click and drag it around to move it out of the way to see behind it alot. i had an idea.
2010-04-04T22:13:00.000Z	_numbers		what if it could work like https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NotifyOSD#Interaction  where when i move my mouse over the video, it goes transparent and clicks actually click on the things behind the video -- not on the video itself.
2010-04-04T22:13:00.000Z	_numbers		 that would be awesome! i'd not have to move the video around and i could continue watching.
