2008-07-24T21:13:00.000Z	isleshocky77		So I have a jar file which I was running through java -jar file.jar, then I made a launcher file (.desktop), but this is all in my downloads_temp directory I have which I'll probably delete by accident. Where should I place the jar and .desktop file for it to be "installed"?
