2010-09-25T07:34:00.000Z	RBecker	rafaelsoaresbr	since DVI is video only, unless it has an audio input then it won't
2010-09-25T07:36:00.000Z	rafaelsoaresbr	RBecker	I think since HD2XXX Series it sends. is there anyone here using this adapter?
2010-09-25T07:37:00.000Z	RBecker	rafaelsoaresbr	I don't use it so I wouldn't know
