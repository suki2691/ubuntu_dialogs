2008-12-12T18:08:00.000Z	AzizLight		I've been using ubuntu for some time now. I wanted to try KDE. Now sincerely which do you suggest me, Kubuntu 8.10 or the latest OpenSuse?
2008-12-12T18:10:00.000Z	joaopinto	AzizLight	you are looking for "the best" KDE experience, doing an inter-distro question, while this is a distro specific support channel ;)
