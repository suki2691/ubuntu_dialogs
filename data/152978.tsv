2007-03-09T16:28:00.000Z	Libere		Issues with sound on a Vaio rb64g. Running dapper drake, Card: HDA Intel Chip: SigmaTel STAC7661. The volume works, but it's very low and very low quality. Have tried both alsa 1.0.13 and 1.0.14rc3, same result. Everything I've found online refers to a setting in the gnome volume manager called external amplifier, but I don't have that option. Any ideas?
