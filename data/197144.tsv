2008-08-29T23:30:00.000Z	bobertdos	omega_	Why, what's wrong with your Firefox?
2008-08-29T23:32:00.000Z	bobertdos	omega_	I know a fix for that if it's Flash 10 you're using.
2008-08-29T23:34:00.000Z	bobertdos	omega_	Are you using 10? If so, this kind of explains it, but you have to manually create the file it talks about -- http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/2008/08/windowless_mode_fix.html
