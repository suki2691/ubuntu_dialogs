2006-11-14T13:52:00.000Z	Lynoure	savvas	you mean whether it's in some RFC or something? or in your irc client?
2006-11-14T13:54:00.000Z	savvas	Lynoure	i mean whether i can setup in ubuntu netstat to "register" 6668 port as "ircd"
2006-11-14T14:00:00.000Z	Lynoure	savvas	sorry, no idea, I tend to prefer the numerical mode
