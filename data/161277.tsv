2007-07-24T07:22:00.000Z	HoboBen		Hi, question - I have an external hard drive. If I copied my entire internal hard drive (/) (excluding /media, so I don't copy my external drive to itself), and then break my Ubuntu distro, would I then be able to copy the files straight back without any problems?

2007-07-24T07:25:00.000Z	kev_b	HoboBen	you would be better considering either an disk imaging or a disk cloning application
2007-07-24T07:26:00.000Z	kev_b	HoboBen	I think gparted will do this
