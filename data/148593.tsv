2007-01-17T13:40:00.000Z	depinko		How is it possible to install NVIDIA drivers without kernel 386? I rather would like to install NVIDIA drivers with generic kernel
2007-01-17T13:40:00.000Z	ikonia_	depinko	what ubuntu version
2007-01-17T13:41:00.000Z	ikonia_	depinko	there is only "generic" kernel in edgy
2007-01-17T13:42:00.000Z	depinko	ikonia_	hmm I've played with beryl and now I uninstalled it and I cant install back the nvidia drivers I had, because it need the 386 kernel dependency
