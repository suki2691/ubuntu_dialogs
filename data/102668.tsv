2009-02-11T12:44:00.000Z	rww	Roby	which IRC client are you using?
2009-02-11T12:45:00.000Z	rww	Roby	go to the Network List, click "Ubuntu Servers", click Edit. To stop it from joining Ubuntu on startup, remove #ubuntu from your favorite channels list. To stop it from connecting to freenode, uncheck "Autoconnect to this network on startup"
