2007-09-04T13:43:00.000Z	Steve^		Any ideas why my ubuntu won't get assigned an IP until I run vista to get one and run ubuntu again?
2007-09-04T13:44:00.000Z	dyrne	Steve^	so sudo dhclient eth0   on the ubuntu box doesnt work until ip is assigned after xp requests an ip?
2007-09-04T13:45:00.000Z	Steve^	dyrne	I haven't run that command myself, but the connection manager shows 0.0.0.0
