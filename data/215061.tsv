2005-10-05T09:56:00.000Z	Kaparen		it my second day using Ubuntu Hoary and I wonder if, when released, I can upgrade Hoary to Breezer without actually taking away the whole OS and reinstall?

2005-10-05T09:57:00.000Z	Kaparen	darkheart	Ok thanks! May I ask why?
2005-10-05T09:58:00.000Z	darkheart	Kaparen	Well, just to keep things clean and working =) upgrading to an essentially different system can cause problems sometimes.
