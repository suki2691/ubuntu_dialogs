2011-04-09T00:38:00.000Z	DraZoro	meganerd	That might be it it gives me EDT instead of SAST +6
2011-04-09T00:41:00.000Z	meganerd	DraZoro	to fix it, try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata"
2011-04-09T00:46:00.000Z	DraZoro	meganerd	Sorry for taking long. You saved the day the reconfiguration worked. Thanks !!! I did not know about that trick.
