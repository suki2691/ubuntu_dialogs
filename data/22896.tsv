2010-11-09T13:55:00.000Z	Genevieve	SingAlong	no, its an HP mini. I'm running ubuntu 10.10 for netbook and can't get the broadcom sta driver installed
2010-11-09T13:56:00.000Z	SingAlong	Genevieve	hp has linux drivers for most stuff.  they offer rpms (you can convert an rpm to deb, it's easy)
2010-11-09T13:56:00.000Z	Genevieve	SingAlong	the driver is on the USB install I have, but I can't get it to work
