2006-11-15T07:02:00.000Z	IdiotStic	carden	my old xorg.cong has a modeline and configs for 8 through 24 bit with modes
2006-11-15T07:04:00.000Z	IdiotStic	carden	I was curious to know if it was something in the later xorg or if it's just this install. the new config has modes for 1280x800, 1024x768, 800x600, and 640x480
