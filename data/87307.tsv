2008-07-24T04:31:00.000Z	echosystm		how would i go about removing and reinstalling ubuntu, but keeping the files in /home ?
2008-07-24T04:31:00.000Z	__yy	echosystm	you'll have to back them up somewhere
2008-07-24T04:32:00.000Z	__yy	echosystm	that's why is usually a good idea to put /home on another partition
