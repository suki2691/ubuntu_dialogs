2010-09-25T11:57:00.000Z	dynemo		I was helping someone out and I had temporarily installed ubuntu on their system. Now he wants Win XP, but since it was an ext4 file system I used the boot disk to format the mounted drives into NTFS, but I screwed up. I told it to designate it as empty (0x00) and that process hung for an hour or so before I shut it down. Now it's unbootable. What should I do sensei?.
