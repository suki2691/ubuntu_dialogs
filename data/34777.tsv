2010-04-02T21:17:00.000Z	Cobwesel		Hey guys, looking for some help with folder permissions
2010-04-02T21:19:00.000Z	Cobwesel		I installed Apache and when I goto /www I'm not allowed to edit or delete files. how do I grant my self permission to the folder?
2010-04-02T21:20:00.000Z	jrib	Cobwesel	I would recommend setting up a group like www-editors
2010-04-02T21:25:00.000Z	Cobwesel	jrib	set up a group like www-editors even for local machine work? or is that more for remote work?
