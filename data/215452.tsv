2008-07-01T13:34:00.000Z	heanol		i'm trying to transfer my system to an encrypted root (had some problems when trying to do it at install time), but i cannot get the system to ask me for the passphrase when booting
2008-07-01T13:34:00.000Z	heanol		it just stops when i'd expect it to ask me for it
2008-07-01T13:34:00.000Z	heanol		what could i have done wrong?
