2007-02-05T10:33:00.000Z	lordkeiden	HymnToLife	my wifi works fine, but the gui lies... the reason that seems importand t me is cuz gui's make me feel warm and fuzzy... i an moving this hard drive to a new lappy and i know i will need to remove the current driver and setup the new card in the new lappy. i can go to the cold baren terminal...but it scares me. the word terminal has something to do with it i think
