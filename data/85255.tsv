2010-11-01T17:51:00.000Z	ha55an		hi, i have a question: i have a folder full of subfolders with pictures. many of the pics are dupplicates, i have used fslink to create hardlinks to dupplicates to save disk space. i now want to copy all the folder to a usb drive (for backup) how do i do that without it taking too much space and creating dupplicates all over again?
