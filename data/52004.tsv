2012-05-20T11:58:00.000Z	fyrzen		Hello, I have a small query for you gentlemen. I have a current ubuntu installation on one partition (18GB). I want to make another (125GB) partition my home folder and preserve all settings. Will simply moving the user directory (and other files in /home) to the new partition, and mounting it as /home in /etc/fstab do the trick?
