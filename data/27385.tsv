2010-08-18T17:51:00.000Z	enzo_5		I've erased by mistake a config file of a awstats. What is the command to reinstall the config files please ?
2010-08-18T17:52:00.000Z	gimpy283	enzo_5	Which file?
2010-08-18T17:53:00.000Z	gimpy283	enzo_5	I'm no help then, never heard of that one, but if it only had default entries, re-installing the package which provides it might work.
