2005-01-03T12:05:00.000Z	Quenyar		Installing VMware tools in ubuntu - am being asked "What is the location of the directory of C header files that match your running kernel?"  Anybody have a clue?
2005-01-03T12:07:00.000Z	Quenyar		So no one knows the location of C header files used in the running kernel?
2005-01-03T12:09:00.000Z	spikeb	Quenyar	/usr/include/linux i would think
2005-01-03T12:11:00.000Z	Quenyar	spikeb	 VMware responded "The header files in /usr/linclude/linux are generally for C libraries, not for the running kernel, ... "  is this the location, or is it likely that I do not have the kernel source files installed?
