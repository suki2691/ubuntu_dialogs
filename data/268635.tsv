2004-11-02T10:31:00.000Z	talon906		i just installed ubuntu and during startup in boots to the command line rather than gui. how do I change the option to boot to gui since this is my first distro

2004-11-02T10:32:00.000Z	Kamion	talon906	unless you booted with 'custom' (if you don't know what I'm talking about, you didn't)
