2006-02-22T12:19:00.000Z	Kyo		I'm not sure if KDE is worth installing
2006-02-22T12:19:00.000Z	Kyo		any advantage it has over Gnome?
2006-02-22T12:20:00.000Z	calc_	Kyo	much more configurable than gnome but doesn't look as good imho
2006-02-22T12:20:00.000Z	calc_	Kyo	uses less memory than gnome as well afaik
