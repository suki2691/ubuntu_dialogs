2009-08-12T04:52:00.000Z	wgl		I have used the upgrade option to bring my boxes to 8,04 LTS.  Since 9 is now out and mainstream, I am wondering if there will appear an "upgrade" button on the update tool as well, or if that is a separate update path.

2009-08-12T04:55:00.000Z	MyNameIsLuca	wgl	I think the Do upgrade [x]. Should be included in the update gui though
