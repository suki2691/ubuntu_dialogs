2012-05-05T04:01:00.000Z	Paulo39		hello guys. i have a simple question: i want to install ubuntu. i already have a linux distro installed in the computer (arch) with separated /swap /home / and /boot partitions. when installing ubuntu, may i point /swap and /boot to the same partitions? (i know i can do it with /home and i will do it)

2012-05-05T04:05:00.000Z	Paulo39	IntuitiveNipple	and did it work with the other /boot not formatted??
