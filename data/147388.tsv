2007-03-16T10:42:00.000Z	predaeus	SirBob1701	you can search for the package in synaptic and the look under properties where you will find a "provides" tab that shows where what is installed for this package.

2007-03-16T10:42:00.000Z	predaeus	SirBob1701	sry, it is not called provides but "installed files"
