2005-01-01T11:48:00.000Z	bob2	DoktorTomoe	you don't
2005-01-01T11:49:00.000Z	DoktorTomoe	bob2	I thought I've seen it before. I didn't care at that point of time, however.
2005-01-01T11:50:00.000Z	bob2	DoktorTomoe	there's debtakeover, but I really really wouldn't do that on a machine that's actually needed
