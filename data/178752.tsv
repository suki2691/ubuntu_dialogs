2008-04-25T17:38:00.000Z	roocraig		my update manager goes dark-any help?
2008-04-25T17:39:00.000Z	v0lksman	roocraig	 it's likely cause the mirrors are all busy....did you try finding a different mirror?
2008-04-25T17:41:00.000Z	v0lksman	roocraig	 launch synaptic first...go to settings...then repositories....then use the drop down to "Download From"....hit "Other" and ask it to select the best mirror....
2008-04-25T17:42:00.000Z	v0lksman	roocraig	 then hit reload and close Synaptic...then run update manager again
