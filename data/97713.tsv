2009-02-05T21:45:00.000Z	MarkJones		Hello can anyone tell me if there are mirrors that host ubuntu packages and are organised by release? Such as a repo of just the packages for Ubuntu 8.04.2, so that one doesnt have to guess as to what package goes with which release?
2009-02-05T21:46:00.000Z	MarkJones		Seems to be the standard for other distros and Im not sure if Ubuntu has that.
2009-02-05T21:46:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	MarkJones	ya they come in the sources.list
2009-02-05T21:47:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	MarkJones	as in what exactly you want?? the mirror site?
