2005-07-04T11:40:00.000Z	devios		I am using TightVNC Viewer on WinXP and Ubuntu's Remote Desktop feature...  Any way that I can copy/paste text between my WinXP system and the VNC session?
2005-07-04T11:41:00.000Z	dabaR	devios	I would have typed it in by now...;)
2005-07-04T12:16:00.000Z	devios	dabaR	I can't type without looking at the keys, so this is a real issue for me.
2005-07-04T12:16:00.000Z	dabaR	devios	well, I cant get my toString to work like I want it to.
