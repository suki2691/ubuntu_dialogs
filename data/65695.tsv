2009-11-21T01:37:00.000Z	Vesayth		Hello all. I'm having trouble resolving hostnames on my home network when connecting to it via a VPN. My home server is running Ubuntu 9.10 64-bit and client is Windows Vista 32-bit. I can ping the hostnames just fine, but when I try to use "net view \\hostname" I get System error 5. Access is denied. One thing to note is that the windows PC connects to a domain rather than a workgroup. Anyone have any ideas?

2009-11-21T01:37:00.000Z	Warp4	Vesayth	are you able to connect to the server locally (not over vpn)?
2009-11-21T01:37:00.000Z	Vesayth	Warp4	yes
