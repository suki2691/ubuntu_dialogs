2008-06-11T23:26:00.000Z	AFJUSD		I am the IT Director for a K-12 Public School. I am wanting to implement Ubuntu 8.10 in selected classrooms. However, I need to things. My users need to log into these machines just as they would in a Windows AD Network AND I need there Network Based Home Directories to be mapped automatically. I have searched and searched for documentation about this.... Can you help?
