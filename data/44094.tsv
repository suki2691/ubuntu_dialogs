2012-04-07T22:09:00.000Z	lonnie		I'm having difficulty playing yahoo chess in 12.04. I complains that I don't have flash 7 or later:  http://games.yahoo.com/games/login2?page=ch&ss=1
2012-04-07T22:09:00.000Z	lonnie		Yet, I can watch youtube videos..... any suggestions?
2012-04-07T22:09:00.000Z	hylian	lonnie	hmm, never tried yahoo games on ubuntu. let me see what happens...
2012-04-07T22:13:00.000Z	hylian	lonnie	that's actually not a problem based on flash, but java. you will have to install java from oracle, the version installed (open jdk and icedtea6-plugin) will not work.
