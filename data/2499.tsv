2012-07-14T20:57:00.000Z	Amorris		hey ya'll. currently have Windows 7. trying to install ubuntu. When I boot from the disk and select install ubuntu I get a message ending in "terminated by signal 9 (killed)" any ideas?
2012-07-14T20:58:00.000Z	duhamel	Amorris	do a Md5sum on the iso and compare it with ubuntus hashes on the website.
2012-07-14T21:02:00.000Z	duhamel	Amorris	if the numbers don't match Ubuntus hashes then try downloading a different iso. i also prefer using Unetbootin to install iso's to a USB it's quick and no wasted disks
2012-07-14T21:08:00.000Z	duhamel	Amorris	have you tried other iso's or distrobutions?
