2012-09-07T15:50:00.000Z	Nordom		I am thinking clean install ubuntu over my win7 is this wise? Or is better to duel boot?
2012-09-07T15:51:00.000Z	Nordom		I heard that clean install makes ubuntu faster? should I make a new partion for it or could I install it to same partion as windows? or should I use that install unbuntu from windows thingy?

2012-09-07T15:54:00.000Z	subz3r0	Nordom	depends on your needs. I would make a partition for everything i need. Like 400mb for /boot, 10 gigs for /, RAM = /swap(if you want to suspend), 10+gigs for /home
