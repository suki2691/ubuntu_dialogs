2008-05-03T13:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	damntourists	 depends on what video card you got.
2008-05-03T13:08:00.000Z	Dr_willis	damntourists	 the default failsafe for ati would be the 'ati' driver or the 'vesa' driver
2008-05-03T13:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis	damntourists	 ati driver wont have full 3d support. and will be slower then fglrx most likely
