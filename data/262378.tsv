2008-09-09T18:03:00.000Z	mrNotYou		Well, it's because at school we run Windows and I have 2 .ogg files and I can't seem to get them converted with Gnormalize. :s
2008-09-09T18:03:00.000Z	mrNotYou		And the school network blocks downloads :/
2008-09-09T18:03:00.000Z	unimatrix9	mrNotYou	, go to media-convert
