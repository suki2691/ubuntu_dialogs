2006-11-07T07:49:00.000Z	Akuma_		i want to install ubuntu, but i already have an ntfs filesystem that takes the whole hd. will ubuntu play nice and format its own space without messing up the rest of the data?
2006-11-07T07:49:00.000Z	sethk	Akuma_	no
2006-11-07T07:50:00.000Z	sethk	Akuma_	you have to use something like gparted or partition magic to make space
2006-11-07T07:50:00.000Z	Akuma_	sethk	i see. thanks!
