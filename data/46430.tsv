2009-12-09T12:21:00.000Z	losha	nomad111	dunno if it's possible, but it's got to be more trouble than it's worth. How about running solaris under vmware instead...
2009-12-09T12:22:00.000Z	nomad111	losha	i hear gcc can do it
2009-12-09T12:24:00.000Z	losha	nomad111	probably, but it might be buggy, since I bet it doesn't get much use cross-compiling for sun/solaris....
