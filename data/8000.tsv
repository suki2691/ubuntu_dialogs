2011-11-23T08:21:00.000Z	maestrojed		been building an ubuntu box to be a media center and controlled by my Android phone. 2 pretty specific things but Ive learned ticks & I know there are more to learn. Do you think a site/forum about this would get any interest? Would you be interested? Do you use Ubuntu in this fashion?

2011-11-23T08:23:00.000Z	maestrojed	An-iSociaL	sure, and I use XBMC, but there is sooo much more to do. XBMC would be a thread. But its not the only thing to think about
2011-11-23T08:24:00.000Z	maestrojed	An-iSociaL	and I guess that is kinda my point. Well can you do or is interesting to do?
