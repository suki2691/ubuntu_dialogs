2007-04-04T10:21:00.000Z	pixelcrash		i have integrated SiS 630 audio card that I can't get working. Tried alsa-project, but the trident driver that i compiled is a "X?" status and didn't work. I have the windows audio driver exe, but not sure if there's a way to wrap the driver to ubuntu. couldn't find it in the forums. anyone have any ideas?
