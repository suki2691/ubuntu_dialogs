2004-09-27T06:30:00.000Z	Loduriel		I've got a Netgear MA311(a wireless pci adapter) working with the orinoco module, will it be recognised by the installer? or will i need to set it up after?
2004-09-27T06:30:00.000Z	Kamion	Loduriel	that's fairly vanilla, should be recognized
2004-09-27T06:30:00.000Z	Kamion	Loduriel	if it doesn't, send us the PCI id
2004-09-27T06:31:00.000Z	Loduriel	Kamion	thx for the info!
