2011-06-03T11:42:00.000Z	fredhami		yeah i tried to  use the newest version 11.4 in the virtual box but my system slows down to much
2011-06-03T11:44:00.000Z	riktking_	fredhami	using a system in virtual box will be slower because it doesnt have the full resourses
2011-06-03T11:46:00.000Z	riktking_	fredhami	can u run it from a USB stick or CD?
