2012-03-04T09:56:00.000Z	Notimik	Nicolas_Leonida2	put him in a group that could write to that dir
2012-03-04T09:57:00.000Z	Nicolas_Leonida2	Notimik	any other way?
2012-03-04T09:57:00.000Z	Notimik	Nicolas_Leonida2	make it so that other could read and write to it, guess it could be solved thru acl too
