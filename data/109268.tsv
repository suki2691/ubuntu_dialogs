2010-01-25T15:28:00.000Z	Jonathon		Can someone direct me to the instructions for burning ISOs to CDs properly? I'm trying to get Super GRUB Disk onto a CD-ROM, and I know there was a special way to put the ISO on properly so it would boot correctly. Where can I find this? Thanks.
2010-01-25T15:29:00.000Z	Student	Jonathon	Are you using Ubuntu?
2010-01-25T15:30:00.000Z	Jonathon	Student	I'm on Vista trying to get back to Ubuntu
2010-01-25T15:30:00.000Z	Student	Jonathon	Then I recomend CDBurnerXP and it will bring up a menu that says burn ISO. I doon't remember if vista has a iso burner built in.
