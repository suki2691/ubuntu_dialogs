2006-03-29T07:01:00.000Z	GeistDerZeit		Hi dudes. I'm really concerned that i screwed up my system. I tried to install vmware and now i can't use sudo. Even for trying again the install, this time following the steps i later found on the wiki (i hadn't applied the patches to vmware the first time)... some advice?
2006-03-29T07:03:00.000Z	GeistDerZeit		How can i become root without issuing sudo su -?
2006-03-29T07:04:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	GeistDerZeit	 sudo -i
2006-03-29T07:05:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	GeistDerZeit	 do you have a root password set?
