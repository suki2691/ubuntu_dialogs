2008-06-04T02:27:00.000Z	loquitus_of_borg		Can someone help me? I am running edgy and trying to upgrade to feisty using the update manager... getting alot of trouble with 404 errors
2008-06-04T02:28:00.000Z	insomninja	loquitus_of_borg	I would check my /etc/apt/sources.list and see if something looks strange
2008-06-04T02:28:00.000Z	insomninja	loquitus_of_borg	maybe try to ping the servers mentioned or something like that
2008-06-04T02:31:00.000Z	insomninja	loquitus_of_borg	hmm I'd recommend backup and reinstall then, that's what I would do
