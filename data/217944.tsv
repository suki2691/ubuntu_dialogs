2006-03-13T12:41:00.000Z	GnarusLeo		are people still using vmware? Or something better released?
2006-03-13T12:41:00.000Z	WebLOCH	GnarusLeo	depends, theres Xen for other *nix distros or qemu/kqemu for thesame functionality as Vmware
2006-03-13T12:42:00.000Z	WebLOCH	GnarusLeo	then VMware and qemu/kqemu are your only options
2006-03-13T12:43:00.000Z	WebLOCH	GnarusLeo	theres also a funky project for a qemu gui similar to VMware so you can get the most out of qemu
