2005-06-22T08:55:00.000Z	LaurenceRowe		Any emacs users here? I want to make middle click in emacs paste the x selection instead of the emacs only kill buffer. any idea how to get this to work
2005-06-22T08:57:00.000Z	bob2	LaurenceRowe	it does paste the X selection here
2005-06-22T08:58:00.000Z	LaurenceRowe	bob2	it does for me too at first, but as soon as I kill an area with the scissors button on the button bar, it ignores the x selection
2005-06-22T08:58:00.000Z	bob2	LaurenceRowe	well, it overwrites the X selection, right?
