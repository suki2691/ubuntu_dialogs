2007-05-15T10:37:00.000Z	fnf		I'm trying totem-xine but most videos (including DivX, xVid) couldn't be played with it because of the lack of decoder. Can anyone tell me what package should I install, besides totem-xine to be able to play most media as totem-gstreamer does ?
2007-05-15T10:37:00.000Z	fnf		!xine

2007-05-15T10:38:00.000Z	fnf	andreas_	yup, I installed all of the necessary gstreamer packages.
