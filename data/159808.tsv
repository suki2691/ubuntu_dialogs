2007-02-26T12:18:00.000Z	klimraamkosie		I need help syncing with my Sony Ericsson :(  I can't get it to work on /dev/ttyACM1 or ACM0 or USB0 or USB1, it only mounts the memory card on /sdb nothing else.  What now?  Ubuntu Edgy.
2007-02-26T12:18:00.000Z	Qwell[] 	klimraamkosie	what does dmesg say it is?
2007-02-26T12:22:00.000Z	Qwell[] 	klimraamkosie	then it isn't being picked up as a serial device
