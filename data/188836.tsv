2009-04-04T01:57:00.000Z	pumpkinseed		i'm having some strange issues in ubuntu 8.10 - All of a sudden my firefox 3.0.8 and pidgin 2.5.5 dont work anymore. When I run firefox from command line it says "Couldn't load XPCOM." and when I run pidgin from a command line it says "Segmentation fault"... Anyone have any clues, see this before?

2009-04-04T01:59:00.000Z	pumpkinseed		forstburn: I have restarted many times since then
