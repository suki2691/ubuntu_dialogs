2009-04-03T05:42:00.000Z	gaby		hello, i just finished mounting an external hard drive that ¨couldnt be mounted¨ (because of windows, but it really wasnt on windows) and now i got this message: The folder contents could not be displayed. You do not have the permissions necessary to view the contents of "sdb1".
2009-04-03T05:43:00.000Z	gaby		:cc please?
2009-04-03T05:43:00.000Z	Tokenekie	gaby	try putting sudo before what you are trying to do. You need to be root.
2009-04-03T05:44:00.000Z	Tokenekie	gaby	or you can use chmod somehow to change the permissions on what you are trying to view
