2008-05-29T18:19:00.000Z	pdlnhr1		can anyone point me to info on why the removal of firefox 3 beta 5 today?
2008-05-29T18:20:00.000Z	branstrom	pdlnhr1	RC1 is out isn't it?
2008-05-29T18:20:00.000Z	pdlnhr1		i don't know how to answer any of those questions
2008-05-29T18:21:00.000Z	pdlnhr1	branstrom	 and i know RC1 isn't out yet but they released it with firefox 3 included... pretty crazy to remove it after the fact
