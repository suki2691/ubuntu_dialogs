2009-09-07T01:41:00.000Z	Qvintvs		is it possible to recursively send directories with the ftp command (pftp)?
2009-09-07T01:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Qvintvs	i think its mput
2009-09-07T01:42:00.000Z	Qvintvs	ActionParsnip	the help on mput says it sends multiple files, but i'll try it with a directory
2009-09-07T01:43:00.000Z	Qvintvs	ActionParsnip	ya, mput doesn't seem to do it
