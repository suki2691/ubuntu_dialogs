2011-02-15T13:09:00.000Z	ohzie	CalvinMcGee	there are forums dedicated to makes/models of netbooks, and most problems I've had, someone else has bhad and posted about
2011-02-15T13:09:00.000Z	ohzie	CalvinMcGee	although it's likely that almoxarife knows more about this than I do, as he certainly seems more confident than I feel about my "check this out and hope it helps" answer. lol. =P
