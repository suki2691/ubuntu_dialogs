2011-06-23T02:20:00.000Z	whyz	demonspork	how? do-release-upgrade refuses for me
2011-06-23T02:21:00.000Z	whyz	demonspork	the desktop update manager?
2011-06-23T02:37:00.000Z	whyz	demonspork	there must be some fundamental difference between 9.04 and 9.10. update-manager does not support updating from 9.04
