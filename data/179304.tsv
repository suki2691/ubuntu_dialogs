2011-02-13T02:56:00.000Z	jrib	heiz	you could use mouseemu.  Or you could use xbindkeys in combination with xvkbd or xdotool
2011-02-13T03:42:00.000Z	jrib	heiz	read the man page, it explains.  For example, I use "b:10"
2011-02-13T03:44:00.000Z	jrib	heiz	http://www.nongnu.org/xbindkeys/xbindkeys.html#configuration might help you too.  But the man page is not long, so you should read it
