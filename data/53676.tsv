2009-11-09T07:26:00.000Z	Gabs		hi - I have reinstalled gnome on my netbook but the screen resolution apppears too high - I can't access any menus. Any key commands for 9.04 to access the terminal or anything?
2009-11-09T07:26:00.000Z	Gabs		thanks :)
2009-11-09T07:28:00.000Z	Gabs		ok silly question - is there a cli command for resetting the resolution? or which app should I be looking for (sorry I'm such a noob)
