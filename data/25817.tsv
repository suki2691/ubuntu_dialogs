2011-05-08T16:35:00.000Z	Sterist	Chetic	 yes
2011-05-08T16:35:00.000Z	Chetic	Dr_Willis	burning to DVD does not work.. I've tried it way too many times and it gives the strangest problems
2011-05-08T16:36:00.000Z	Sterist	Chetic	it has a lot of the packages that ubuntu normally downloads in the set up so that part goes faster
