2008-10-07T04:42:00.000Z	Betelgeuse__		Well, nobody's answering me on the ppc channel, so I'm going to ask this again here:
2008-10-07T04:42:00.000Z	Betelgeuse__		I have an iBook G4 running 10.3.9. I just downloaded 8.04 -- the ppc version. How do I install/run it?
2008-10-07T04:43:00.000Z	Betelgeuse__		I don't have a CD.
