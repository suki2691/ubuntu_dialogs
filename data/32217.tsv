2010-09-23T02:46:00.000Z	matcouto		Hey y'all. How can I check if the 5590 port is open to receive request from outside my network? I've set the forward rules on my router configurations already... I'm trying to configurate the vncserver here. Anyone?
2010-09-23T02:47:00.000Z	undecim	matcouto	Try to open a VNC connection to port 5590 to the address that wimi.com reports.
2010-09-23T02:49:00.000Z	matcouto	undecim	just like that $vncviewer xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:5590   ?
2010-09-23T02:49:00.000Z	undecim	matcouto	I would assume. I've never used vncviewer command.
