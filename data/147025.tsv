2007-10-22T07:52:00.000Z	ChrisC35		 I'm in the middle of an ubuntu install, and the partition part has been on 'resizing partition' at 50% for over an hour. is this normal, or is there something wrong? how do i find out if the installer or os is just frozen, or if its actually doing something
2007-10-22T07:52:00.000Z	ChrisC35		more like 2 hours now
2007-10-22T07:53:00.000Z	ChrisC35		well it gives me some intro text, then command line - but not telling me anything
