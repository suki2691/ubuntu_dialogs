2007-12-02T19:25:00.000Z	brianski		is there a way to configure the screensavers in ubuntu? i'm running matrixview, and it's taking 100% on two of my cores (i have 2 monitors) - i really like it, but i'd like to tweak the framerate down ... any ideas?
2007-12-02T19:27:00.000Z	brianski		it needs a checkbox "always save screenshots in this directory"
