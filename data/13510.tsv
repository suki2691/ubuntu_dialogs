2011-06-08T02:56:00.000Z	Kenty22		Well... still there. Please someone help. When I login to ubuntu 10.04, it blinks black screen, and pops me back to the login screen
2011-06-08T02:57:00.000Z	notNicolas	Kenty22	have you tried in text only mode? Maybe you will get a useful error message.
2011-06-08T02:58:00.000Z	Kenty22	notNicolas	 I tried in tty2 and yeah I can login, but there are no error messages.
2011-06-08T02:58:00.000Z	notNicolas	Kenty22	Okay well, if google doesn't find your answer I'm too noob to help you any further, lol.
