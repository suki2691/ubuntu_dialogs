2012-09-09T23:33:00.000Z	Jellyg00se		Hi all, more of a grep terminal question, I'm trying to remove all files recursively within directories where they have been created with a (1) in the name i.e. song(1).mp3, I tried ls -R * | grep -r "(1)" * which lists a lot of files but ALL of them, and then I also wish to pipe an rm to it, any help would be appreciated, thankyou :)
