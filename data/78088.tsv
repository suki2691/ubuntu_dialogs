2008-12-14T18:43:00.000Z	korogiannos		Any improvements to Intrepid since release?  I'd like to convert my family PC from XP.  I know hardy works perfectly but am considering Intrepid.  Is it too early? have the "teething problems" been sorted?  Thanks for your input.
2008-12-14T18:44:00.000Z	Flannel	korogiannos	What are you looking to upgrade to Intrepid for?  There's nothing wrong with sticking to Hardy until 2010 (or until something comes out in Ubuntu you absolutely need)

2008-12-14T18:45:00.000Z	korogiannos	Flannel	That's the main reason I'd stick.  "if it ain't broke, don't fix it"
