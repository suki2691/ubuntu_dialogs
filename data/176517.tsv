2009-01-26T23:51:00.000Z	gonzojive		my backspace key is not working in emacs when I SSH into my 08.04 Ubuntu server.  It does work SSHing into a different Ubuntu server that's a little older (forget exactly what version).  The backspace works in the command prompt, but not in emacs
2009-01-26T23:53:00.000Z	gonzojive		any advice on how to debug backspace not working over SSH?
2009-01-26T23:54:00.000Z	gonzojive		it doesn't work in emacs but works on the command prompt
