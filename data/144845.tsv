2007-06-02T12:29:00.000Z	BFTD		Hi, on my laptop just before the login screen appears on boot up, it crashes and locks up, if I restart the machine without shutting off the laptop, it works fine, but other then that it crashes every time, how do I find out whats wrong?
2007-06-02T12:29:00.000Z	qman	BFTD	try pressing CTRL+ALT+F1 after it crashes
2007-06-02T12:30:00.000Z	qman	BFTD	if you get a terminal, log in and run "dmesg" to get some hints as to what's happening
2007-06-02T12:30:00.000Z	BFTD	qman	I tried that, its unresponsive to anything
