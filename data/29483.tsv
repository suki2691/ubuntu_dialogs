2010-07-05T07:53:00.000Z	RJames		But if I try to install the bugger from the USB to the netbook's SSD drive... 67% through the install, I get a disk error.  Any troubleshooting tips to check if it's the SSD drive or the usb drive?

2010-07-05T07:53:00.000Z	RJames	Stupendoussteve	sorry for lengthiness.
