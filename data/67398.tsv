2009-02-08T03:26:00.000Z	_VIM_	nonix4	that doesnt sound to safe to me, have you concidered using virtualbox for testing ibex?
2009-02-08T03:27:00.000Z	nonix4	_VIM_	already kinda done that but no, I don't support commercialish VM software, rather prefer using ubuntu-supplied kvm :)
2009-02-08T03:28:00.000Z	_VIM_	nonix4	I hear ya, open-source is always a better choice if we can avoid the alternatives :)
