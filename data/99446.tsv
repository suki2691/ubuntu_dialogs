2009-07-18T02:56:00.000Z	burkmat		Attempting to play videos on my Eee, but the CPU isn't powerful enough to handle it - I happen to have an Ubuntu Server idling in the building and I'm looking for a way to have the server help my Eee with the decoding and playback of videos... Does anyone have any suggestions?
2009-07-18T02:57:00.000Z	Fougner	burkmat	maybe convert the videos to a lower rate?
2009-07-18T02:57:00.000Z	burkmat	Fougner	well... I want the higher rate, playing it on a 40" LCD so quality is appreciated.
2009-07-18T02:58:00.000Z	Fougner	burkmat	then I don't know =)
