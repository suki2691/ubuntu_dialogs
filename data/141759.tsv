2007-04-22T08:17:00.000Z	dager	dauoalagio2	ssh works well, but it might not be quite what you're looking for
2007-04-22T08:18:00.000Z	dauoalagio2	dager	one can't start x, so i am trying to back everything up
2007-04-22T08:18:00.000Z	dager	dauoalagio2	ssh is completely command-line, unless you get a frontend
