2012-05-01T07:48:00.000Z	zivester		why do most DE's put the "bar" at the top?... I can understand unity is built that way because its like OSX sharing real estate... but xfce, gnome 2.x... why?
2012-05-01T07:49:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	zivester	because that's the least "jarring" to new users. *most* DE's allow you to customize it (kde, lxde, xfce all allow it to change)
2012-05-01T07:52:00.000Z	zivester	DarwinSurvivor	buy I've been asking myself why.. just because it's been that way?  I took a chance and moved it to the bottom recently... and because of apps like chrome, it makes the most sense to have it at the bottom (like windows).. much easier to navigate to the top right to close, or to go to a chrome tab.. etc
2012-05-01T07:53:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	zivester	pretty much. most DE's haven't had a major facelift in a long time. gnome, kde and unity are the only real "facelifted" ones out there (except maybe enlightenment if they ever finished it)
