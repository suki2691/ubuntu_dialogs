2010-07-09T09:03:00.000Z	upgrdman		i have an 1100VA Belkin UPS that has served me well for almost five years now. I recently had a need for a second UPS and I bought a 1000VA APC UPS. If I perform the self test with my new APC UPS (or simply cut power) my computer shuts off immediately. The UPS only shows a load of about 20%, 269 Watts to be specific. The UPS is rated for 600W / 1000VA. Any ideas why my box shuts off?
2010-07-09T09:05:00.000Z	hellrabbit	upgrdman	- Have you played with the S2 S3 power settings in the bios on the box that shuts down?
