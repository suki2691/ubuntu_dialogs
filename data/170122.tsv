Make sure no other program or kernel module (such as sdc2xx, stv680, spca50x) is using the device and you have read/write access to the device.

2007-04-20T10:32:00.000Z	FTMichael	erUSUL	My digicam, which worked fine before the upgrade to Feisty yesterday.  I've had that error before, ages ago, but don't remember when or how I fixed it.  It might have been when I upgraded to Edgy
