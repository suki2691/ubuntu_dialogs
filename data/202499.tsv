2006-01-03T15:35:00.000Z	Sunn_T		I'm installing Ubuntu. I have 2 partitions. One is 19.5GB and the other is 500MB. What file system should I put on the 19.5GB one?

2006-01-03T15:37:00.000Z	Sunn_T	cmatheson	- Should I make the 19.5 "Ext3 journaling file system" ?
2006-01-03T15:38:00.000Z	Sunn_T	cmatheson	- OR Should I make the 19.5 "physical volume for LVM"?
