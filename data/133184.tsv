2009-06-28T08:52:00.000Z	Rob235		:( looks like im gonna switch over to 32bit ubuntu
2009-06-28T08:52:00.000Z	Rob235		unless someone knows how to get 32 bit crossover source code to compile and work on x86_64
2009-06-28T08:52:00.000Z	unitheory	Rob235	all the cool people use 32-bit
2009-06-28T08:54:00.000Z	unitheory	Rob235	64bit should run a little bit faster on 64bit-capable hardware
