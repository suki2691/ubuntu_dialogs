2012-11-01T03:05:00.000Z	EDinNY		How do I set which servers are on at boot?
2012-11-01T03:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	EDinNY	 upstart managed services have a .conf file you can alter/rename to controll  them
2012-11-01T03:07:00.000Z	EDinNY	dr_willis	I can use upstart to stop the dhcp server from starting?
2012-11-01T03:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	EDinNY	 if its managed by upstart - yes.
