2008-07-07T04:57:00.000Z	imaginator		hi.  I'm trying to figure out how to setup a network.  I have modem/router setup as 192.168.0.1, and a wireless router plugged into the modem and setup as 192.168.0.2.  I think the wireless is using DMZ, and I'm wondering how I might run a server on a wireless machine.  Does the DMZ completely negate that beyond what is on the wireless, or could I forward some ports?

2008-07-07T04:58:00.000Z	imaginator	soundray	yes.  It's a demilitarized zone, but I'm not completely sure how that affects things with this.
