2007-08-30T10:36:00.000Z	jurgentje		Hey... is there an easy way to switch from Ubuntu to Kubuntu? (not wanting to start the "which one is better" discussion. Just have some apps - Quanta f.e. - that seem to be working better on KDE)

2007-08-30T10:38:00.000Z	jurgentje	Jack_Sparrow	 well... atm I'm already running a minimal leftover from my XP ... just kinda lacking space to install another boot...
