2007-03-13T11:35:00.000Z	ncaller		I'm trying to get vmware-server working in Edgy, I have the server installed and kernel modules loaded, I am running the 64bit version of Edgy, I am having a problem with vmware-authd.  It just says . Reason: Operation not permitted, when I try to connect to it.  Any ideas?
