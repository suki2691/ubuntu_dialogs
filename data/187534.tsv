2012-06-03T13:33:00.000Z	BoomItzAsh		I was wondering if you guys knew if WINE was essential to run .exe files on the latest update of Ubuntu?
2012-06-03T13:34:00.000Z	ikonia	BoomItzAsh	you cannot run windows software without wine
2012-06-03T13:34:00.000Z	ikonia	BoomItzAsh	depending on wine as a solution in my experience is unacceptable
