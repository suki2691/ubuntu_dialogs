2010-06-09T22:34:00.000Z	mattwynne		I've tried unintalling and re-installing the avahi-daemon package but it's still not there
2010-06-09T22:34:00.000Z	a3ist	mattwynne	did you try "sudo service avahid start"
2010-06-09T22:34:00.000Z	a3ist		installing a daemon won't start it automatically
2010-06-09T22:35:00.000Z	mattwynne	a3ist	it does seem to have started by itself actually. What I'm trying to do is recover the config file
