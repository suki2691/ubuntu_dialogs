2009-09-30T13:36:00.000Z	sageNsand		Using Empathy or Pidgin in a IRC chat room for a while the scroll bar gets relative short. I notice the chat room screen stops rolling upward and the scroll bar starts to creep upward and that means I can't see the most recent text posted in the room, I have to keep dragging it down to see the new posts. Anyone seen the same?
