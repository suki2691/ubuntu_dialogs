2008-03-10T23:34:00.000Z	jimcooncat	natbet	gutsy's openoffice will open that spreadsheet
2008-03-10T23:35:00.000Z	natbet	jimcooncat	thanks, I think I was used to Feisty's open office
2008-03-10T23:36:00.000Z	jimcooncat	natbet	I thought there was a download for Feisty somewhere, but I don't recall now. I moved to gutsy then it wasn't an issue for me.
