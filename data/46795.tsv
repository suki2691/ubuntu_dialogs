2010-12-29T00:18:00.000Z	airman00		hey all. I'm looking for a good tool that I can use to find out how big my TCP packets receiving/transmitting are
2010-12-29T00:18:00.000Z	herghost	airman00	tcpdump
2010-12-29T00:20:00.000Z	airman00	herghost	thanks! Googling it now. I see an alternative is Wireshark. Would you suggest that over TCPdump?
2010-12-29T00:20:00.000Z	herghost	airman00	both are full featured and reasonably complex.  Wireshark is has a gui though, which you may prefer
