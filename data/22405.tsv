2011-01-30T11:18:00.000Z	nexeh	x20twelve	i dont know the awnser and this is a complete guess but check if you sound drivers load when starting in xterm
2011-01-30T11:22:00.000Z	nexeh	x20twelve	ok so when your in gnome how do you start the game?
2011-01-30T11:26:00.000Z	nexeh	x20twelve	type into a console 'whereis nexuiz'
