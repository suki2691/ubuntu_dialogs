2009-02-04T12:28:00.000Z	nadim_	yoyit2	what's wrong with just having Ubuntu manage the driver through Administration -> Hardware Drivers
2009-02-04T12:30:00.000Z	yoyit2	nadim_	nothing shows up at all if i do that
2009-02-04T12:30:00.000Z	yoyit2	nadim_	thats only third party.. not supported drivers\
