2008-08-18T05:30:00.000Z	fenrisx		Could anyone help me?  Since I've been updating Ubuntu I have to choose which Ubuntu kernel I want to load.  If I don't choose anything it loads some 'safe mode' type Ubuntu.
2008-08-18T05:30:00.000Z	fenrisx		How can I get it to just automatically load up the right one without being prompted for which to go with..
2008-08-18T05:30:00.000Z	hwilde	fenrisx	set the default in /boot/grub/menu.lst
