2009-07-13T00:54:00.000Z	devman		is there any way to see what hardware ubuntu actually detects? I want to see if it even SEES my mic, before assigning what audio driver to use for it. If anyone can help with this, pm or reply to this topic: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1211355 . I've been stuck on this for ages
