2005-01-06T13:33:00.000Z	kent		Is there some document on ubuntulinux.org about what things are ok to do with the wiki? Perhaps I should correct the error i found before? I created an acount, and have temporarly (just in preview-mode right now) written a comment about it. But im unsure if I can do that without upsetting some one :(
