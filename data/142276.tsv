2007-03-19T14:12:00.000Z	fdan4896		I am new to Ubuntu and Linux. Just put 6.1 (Edgy?) Desktop on one PC and the server version on another PC.
2007-03-19T14:13:00.000Z	fdan4896		Any reason not to run a GUI on a server? If not a problem, which is best for server, Gnome or KDE?

2007-03-19T14:14:00.000Z	fdan4896	erichj	thanks. that was my best guess, but I am still feeling my way through the text based commands. Have done in it DOS years ago, but never extensively in Unix or Linux.
