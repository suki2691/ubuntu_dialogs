2012-10-23T16:36:00.000Z	IdleOne	dividedbyone	the instructions at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1473191&highlight=ubuntu+realtek665+dell+studio seem to be fairly easy to follow
2012-10-23T16:38:00.000Z	IdleOne	dividedbyone	did you install the "patch" package?
2012-10-23T16:40:00.000Z	IdleOne	dividedbyone	I am not sure, perhaps post on that forum thread and ask, make sure to paste the exact error you are getting.
