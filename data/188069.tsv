2007-03-03T10:16:00.000Z	lukaswayne9		What is currently the best way to install software on an ubuntu machine with no internet connection?  Copying a deb is a PITA because of missing dependencies...
2007-03-03T10:18:00.000Z	Jowi	lukaswayne9	apt-get -d. this will download all the dependencies as well. then copy the debs from /var/cache/apt/archives
2007-03-03T10:19:00.000Z	lukaswayne9	Jowi	alright.. Will that grab dependencies that are already installed on the internet machine, but are not in main already?
2007-03-03T10:20:00.000Z	Jowi	lukaswayne9	not sure actually....
