2006-06-11T14:47:00.000Z	CompuCh|p		I had this question: I set up Postfix/Procmail so local users can send mail and it gets delivered correctly. But now I would like a program (fetchmail?) to fetch mail from my external catch-all POP-account and have it delivered to postfix to sort it out to the local users. Any idea how to do this?
