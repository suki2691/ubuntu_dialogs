2009-03-25T00:16:00.000Z	jurism		Hi! I have problems with restarting apache2. It says something about unable to open logs. I am 90% sure it is php5-ffmpeg problem, but I need this extension very much. Can You tell me where should I add 'pkill -9 apache2' in /etc/init.d/apache2 so server could restart with no problems? Thank You!
