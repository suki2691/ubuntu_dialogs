2008-04-15T23:38:00.000Z	yedday	dmsuperman	I just think, this is a bug, why should one NOT be able to change his screen name at any time? I mean, it really works, using kopete
2008-04-15T23:39:00.000Z	yedday	dmsuperman	I found it
2008-04-15T23:39:00.000Z	yedday	dmsuperman	it's the option: "Set friendly name"...
