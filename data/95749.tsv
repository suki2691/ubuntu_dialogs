2010-01-12T13:50:00.000Z	Redaxxx		I got a minor but quite annoying problem with xubuntu, everytime I boot my computer and reach the desktop it automatically opens terminal, hardware drivers and add/remove software (or whatever it's called in English)... When shutting off I make sure that "Save session for future logins" is not marked.  Anyone know how to stop this from happening?
