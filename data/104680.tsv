2012-02-09T04:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	StormTide	I suggest you add the boot option: text    it's less destructive
2012-02-09T04:45:00.000Z	StormTide	ActionParsnip	its a fresh install i did from the alternate installer, i just screwed up and forgot to hit f4
2012-02-09T04:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	StormTide	doesn't break anything, just doesn't load the GUI ;)
