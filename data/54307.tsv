2012-01-05T19:10:00.000Z	Shwaiil		Q: I want to buy a new computer, the problem's that ubuntu listed certified computers are really old, or for new models are not available in my current location. I'm wondering if there's a test I can do by my own, or if there's a non official list of compatible computers to install ubuntu without issues ? Thanks for looking!
