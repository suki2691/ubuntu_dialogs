2011-06-10T01:51:00.000Z	Xgates		hey guys
2011-06-10T01:51:00.000Z	Xgates		say anyone using winetricks, how does that compare to just installing wine?
2011-06-10T01:51:00.000Z	klown	Xgates	it has lots of auto configs for certain apps/games, pretty good in my opinion
2011-06-10T01:52:00.000Z	Xgates	klown	thing is it's using wine1.2 and wine is at 1.3 and I want to install MS office with it for someone, so not sure which would be better to go with
