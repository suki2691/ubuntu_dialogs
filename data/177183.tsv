2006-06-20T10:33:00.000Z	andersje	genghis	change boot order in BIOS
2006-06-20T10:33:00.000Z	genghis	andersje	 it boots from CD just fine, but starting Ubuntu *always* attempts to load the installation on the hard drisk
2006-06-20T10:38:00.000Z	genghis	andersje	 disconnecting the hard disk gets the livecd booting, but I want to fix the hard disk so that's no good
