2011-05-11T14:50:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	mrluksom	Yeah - I see the list now.  I guess I can get the list from there and feed it to apt-get remove - thanks.
2011-05-11T14:50:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	mrluksom	If I remove common, since the others depend on it, that ought to blow it out of the water, yes?
2011-05-11T14:50:00.000Z	pr3d4t0r	mrluksom	The whole installation, I mean.
