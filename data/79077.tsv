2008-09-17T13:34:00.000Z	AkshunBoi		All of a sudden my xubuntu hardy install is getting stuck right after the GRUB bootloader (message is "Starting Up...", it just hangs there indefinitely). I recently installed some updates using the automatic updater, none of them required a restart, system worked fine until the battery died, on restart it began hanging. Any ideas?

2008-09-17T13:36:00.000Z	AkshunBoi	le_mischa	I tried hitting escape during grub and choosing the (recovery mode) option for the latest kernel (.21) and it hangs during startup, I can tell you what line it hangs at if you think it'll help.
