2012-02-20T14:01:00.000Z	tonesfrommars		Greetings: can anyone advise me on a dual-boot (Maverick-XP) grub2 issue? I have 2 separate drives, defreagged the XP drive (where grub is) and it's gone haywire.

2012-02-20T14:02:00.000Z	tonesfrommars	theadmin	sorry, it sent me to grub rescue prompt.
2012-02-20T14:02:00.000Z	theadmin	tonesfrommars	Ah, hm.
