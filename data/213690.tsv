2007-09-09T10:05:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	VousDeux	I've been using reiserfs (it's my current root partition), and I've had problems with it.
2007-09-09T10:05:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	VousDeux	Primarily, after 14 days of uptime, the drive is full, and the system unusable, when on a fresh boot I'm only at 70%.
2007-09-09T10:08:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	VousDeux	Yeah, it was worth checking out others (I've done xfs also), but I always return to ext3.
