2009-08-27T08:17:00.000Z	Ten-Eight	jjchmh	is your machine set to boot up on the cd?
2009-08-27T08:21:00.000Z	Ten-Eight	jjchmh	so you booted up on the Win CD and you can't install it?
2009-08-27T08:22:00.000Z	Ten-Eight	jjchmh	if you boot up on the winders cd, you should be able to install from there. it's been so long since I've done it...but it should just start up the install routine.
