2008-04-11T06:41:00.000Z	jerthebear2		hmm could some one help me? I use ubuntu gutsy (7.10) turned dbus off and now I can't access the internet from ubuntu or edit the services (which inludes the dbus setting), and it says I have no permission even if I do it in root. Upon startup, it says that HAL failed to initialize.
