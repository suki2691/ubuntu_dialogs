2008-09-22T12:48:00.000Z	anakin_		Hello all, I've got my new system setup - with only one problem. My onboard sound is surround 7.1 but I have just a pair of 2 stereo speakers. So most of the spoken dialog is lost.
2008-09-22T12:48:00.000Z	anakin_		Can someone please tell me how to configure the sound card so that it'll down mix the channels by default?
2008-09-22T12:48:00.000Z	anakin_		Right now I am getting by using mplayer's ao / channel options.
2008-09-22T12:48:00.000Z	brandonmpace	anakin_	this is a common problem and I have not found a single solution
