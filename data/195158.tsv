2008-02-01T08:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	smallfoot-	if they do it's probably with xubuntu
2008-02-01T08:06:00.000Z	smallfoot-	Scunizi	then why is ubuntu released as compiled i386 instead of i486 or i586 or even i686?
2008-02-01T08:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	smallfoot-	the numbering does not really represent a 386 processor. The kernel recognized the chip and uses the appropriate "stuff" for the lack of a better word.
