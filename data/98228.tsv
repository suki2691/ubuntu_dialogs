2008-03-07T02:54:00.000Z	Brian323		gOS 2.0 or GOS ROCKET....    I'm not having much fun tweaking this OS... can't ctrl-alt f2, can't sudo this or sh that...  Should I go back to Fedora 8 ?  or recommend something else for a newbie ?!?
2008-03-07T02:56:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Brian323	gOS... isn't that a completely open and completely free distro? If it is, then I recall reading something about how it was definitely not for newbies...
2008-03-07T02:56:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix		ahh flowOver thanks.
2008-03-07T02:57:00.000Z	Brian323	ArthurArchnix	nope.  gOS is supposed to be for newbies.. or so I thought.  It seems very limited
