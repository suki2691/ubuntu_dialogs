2005-09-18T05:23:00.000Z	evian		I downloaded skype as a .deb because I didn't see it in a repository. Now what do I do to install the .deb file?
2005-09-18T05:24:00.000Z	zorba64	evian	where did you get the .deb from
2005-09-18T05:25:00.000Z	zorba64	evian	to install a deb: sudo dpkg -i name.of.package.deb
