2008-08-01T07:16:00.000Z	Kohlrak	Blaqlight	what's a curse and what not is purely speculation. Some languages don't have curse words.
2008-08-01T07:17:00.000Z	Blaqlight	Kohlrak	sure but if my 5 year old learned a new word on here by reading it on screen Id be quite mad, especially if I thought this channel was supposed to be family friendly.
2008-08-01T07:18:00.000Z	Kohlrak	Blaqlight	i'm sure he'll learn a few words words than the name of a place if he hangs around here too long. Lots of words can fly.
