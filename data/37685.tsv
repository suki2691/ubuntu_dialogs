2010-02-08T20:01:00.000Z	anto9us	abahkaiyisah	you could re-install from live-cd and if you don't format the partition containing /home then it will retain your data
2010-02-08T20:03:00.000Z	abahkaiyisah	anto9us	so everything under /home wont disappear. and we should install by set the partition label manually?
2010-02-08T20:05:00.000Z	anto9us	abahkaiyisah	the partitioner gives the option to format or not during the install process. You don't have to format to re-install. It should work.
