2012-05-17T10:44:00.000Z	brianpWins		I've got ubuntu 10.04 and have logged in with a user that should be in the admin group. I logged in via ssh key so i didn't need the p/w and should have sudo priv's. I don't for the life of me remember what my password is
2012-05-17T10:45:00.000Z	brianpWins		how can i verify I'm in the admin group and do something about the password issue?
