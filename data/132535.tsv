2007-09-18T11:27:00.000Z	sooth		Is there a way to manually re-initialize my soundcard after a suspend?
2007-09-18T11:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	sooth	maybe a rmmod of the sound modules and modprobing them again works
2007-09-18T11:31:00.000Z	sooth	erUSUL	Can't seem to unload it. Complains it is in use
2007-09-18T11:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	sooth	:(
