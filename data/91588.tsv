2008-08-14T13:46:00.000Z	ThreeFinity		So I'm debating which distro to get, 32bit or 64bit. Anybody have any comments that might help me figure this out ? I do have a 64bit CPU.

2008-08-14T13:47:00.000Z	joaopinto	ThreeFinity	64 bits
2008-08-14T13:48:00.000Z	joaopinto	ThreeFinity	I would suggest 64 bits, simply for the fact that you will be using a more recent technology, I had no problems with it, but you also should not expect advantage over 32 bits
