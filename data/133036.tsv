2010-04-11T08:35:00.000Z	Melwasul_GIlrean		I know its the wrong channel for it, but no one seems to be paying attention in the WineHQ channel.. Anyone feel like helping me with a Wine issue?
2010-04-11T08:36:00.000Z	vegar_	Melwasul_GIlrean	just ask
2010-04-11T08:38:00.000Z	vegar_	Melwasul_GIlrean	ah, so that's why you have such a cooky nick
