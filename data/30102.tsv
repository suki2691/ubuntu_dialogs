2010-07-10T22:34:00.000Z	vladimirm		I cannot connect to the internet through terminal. Selecting network through NetworkManager Applet does the job, but when I'm in say recovery console, I can't.

2010-07-10T22:37:00.000Z	vladimirm	greezmunkey	thanks, I will try that
2010-07-10T22:52:00.000Z	vladimirm	greezmunkey	when the script completed, I could go to the given ip address which showed what my apache served, but nothing else
