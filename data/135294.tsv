2008-11-11T17:16:00.000Z	King		my question is: I have 1.8 GHz proc and 1.5gig ram and my ubuntu is slower then vista what gives
2008-11-11T17:17:00.000Z	ziroday	King	slower how?
2008-11-11T17:18:00.000Z	King	ziroday	i just expected that when i upgraded the ram for 512 to 1.5gig my overall experience would improve but it really didn't
