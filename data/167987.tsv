2008-10-16T03:12:00.000Z	bnovc		i read that "setxkbmap dvorak" would switch me to dvorak in ubuntu but that doesn't seem to do anything with no warnings or errors, suggestions?
2008-10-16T03:12:00.000Z	LjL	bnovc	why don't you just switch to dvorak using the keyboard layout preferences?
2008-10-16T03:15:00.000Z	bnovc	LjL	i was hoping to bind it to ctrl+ctrl to switch between them
2008-10-16T03:15:00.000Z	LjL	bnovc	well i use KDE, and i can certainly switch layout using a shortcut (not sure ctrl+ctrl would work though), i'm not sure about gnome but it should be very much possible
