2005-07-26T05:44:00.000Z	nikkia	abunic	most of the loki stuff is so terribly out of date it requires serious effort to even install, never mind run, these days :/
2005-07-26T05:47:00.000Z	nikkia	abunic	about the best advice i can give, is hunt down the loki 'patches', usually, there is a updated installer that installs the patched version from the CD
2005-07-26T05:48:00.000Z	nikkia	abunic	links to the patch ftps should be on loki's (defunct-ish) website, but even those are over 3 years old, and may well not run on new linux systems
