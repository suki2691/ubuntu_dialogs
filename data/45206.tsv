2010-08-23T02:41:00.000Z	thune3	deever	the only question that pops up from that error: did you mess with fstab before boot problems began?
2010-08-23T02:43:00.000Z	deever	thune3	no, just made updates
2010-08-23T02:44:00.000Z	thune3	deever	i missed the backstory on your issue, sry. Was this kernel update? can you boot older kernel ok?
