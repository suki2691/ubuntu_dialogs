2011-10-06T21:54:00.000Z	ljsdofuynsdfufuh		I sent a 7zip file to someone who uses ubuntu and they say the ubuntu 7zip command "p7zip" doesn't have an "x" option (which is how I extract them)...
2011-10-06T21:54:00.000Z	theadmin	ljsdofuynsdfufuh	The command is "7z" actually
2011-10-06T21:57:00.000Z	ljsdofuynsdfufuh	theadmin	so "7z x [filename]" works on ubuntu with p7zip package installed?
2011-10-06T21:57:00.000Z	theadmin	ljsdofuynsdfufuh	Should.
