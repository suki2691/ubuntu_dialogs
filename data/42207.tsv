2009-11-20T03:29:00.000Z	ArtemZ		I want to start compain aimed to save GIMP in Ubuntu (developers going to remove GIMP from standart distribution in Ubuntu 10.04). How many people will support me?
2009-11-20T03:30:00.000Z	trism	ArtemZ	it will still be in the main repository, just not installed by default...just sudo apt-get install gimp
2009-11-20T03:34:00.000Z	trism	ArtemZ	the idea is that the average user probably doesn't need to do much graphics editing, for the rest of us, we can easily install whatever we want from the repos
2009-11-20T03:36:00.000Z	ArtemZ	trism	maybe gimp is too hard for average user as grafic editor, but F-SPOT isnt editor at all. Thay shoud keep some editor as I beleive
