2010-08-31T23:19:00.000Z	DeFi		Can anyone tell me why it would say '192.168.0.256: Unknown host' (192.168.0.256 being the static ip), 'failed to bring up eth0' after setting up a static ip in /etc/network/interfaces on a clean install of Ubuntu in VirtualBox(without X)?

2010-08-31T23:27:00.000Z	adminewb	DeFi	did you get your address problem corrected?
