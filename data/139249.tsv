2007-05-05T10:10:00.000Z	jimenycricket		Need some adive...my brother, who is in Iraq and has no internet access, has been having issues with Windows Vista and I have convinced him to give Ubunut a try.  I'm downloading the repositories to DVD for him, but of course he'll want DVD and MP3 playback.   He has never used Linux before and I'd like to set hime up with a Automatix-type program to install those capabilities.  Any pointers?
