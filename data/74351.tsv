2008-11-24T03:31:00.000Z	shea279__		I have a Compaq Presario CQ50-110US and i get a kernel panic every time i try to boot any linux operating system (ubuntu is one of them)--can anyone please help me?
2008-11-24T03:33:00.000Z	shea279__		Are there any general troubleshooting steps for solving a hardware based kernel panic?
2008-11-24T03:34:00.000Z	oskar-	shea279__	 yes, exchange the defect piece of hardware ;-)
2008-11-24T03:38:00.000Z	oskar-	shea279__	 kernel panics can have several reasons. general tips can only be of quite trivial natur like "read the error messages". if you provide the error messages, maybe someone can help you
