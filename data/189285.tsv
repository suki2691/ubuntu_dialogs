2010-05-27T23:59:00.000Z	coz_	felon	 no need to defrag linux
2010-05-28T00:00:00.000Z	coz_	felon	 although all operating systems fragment to some degree... the way linux writes to the hard drive makes it less necessary
2010-05-28T00:03:00.000Z	coz_	felon	 well although ...again... there are linux viruses  there are also free antivirus applications...although it seems most of the viruses are geared towards linux servers rather than desktops  but that is my opinion
