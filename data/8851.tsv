2011-12-13T19:47:00.000Z	iceroot	Pessimist	no
2011-12-13T19:48:00.000Z	iceroot	Pessimist	you cant enable it on linux (even if the gui is telling that you can do it)
2011-12-13T19:51:00.000Z	Pessimist	iceroot	Are there any alternatives to flash? Amd 4800 cpu + hd5670 = around 40-50% cpu with 1 video on flash
