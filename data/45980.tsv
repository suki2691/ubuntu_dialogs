2009-10-10T08:11:00.000Z	nullr		big problem with ubuntu. I can access the web with my main account. But on regular user accounts evolution will not load email. Firefox will load a page or 2 then give me a "connection reset by peer". Does anyone else use multiple accounts? why does the internet only work sometimes? Yes I checked permissions and everything is there.
2009-10-10T08:13:00.000Z	Ghnuberath	nullr	I have an ubuntu system set up with about 20 active users.  they've never had any problems accessing the internet.
2009-10-10T08:16:00.000Z	Ghnuberath	nullr	that is really odd. all of that private data should live in each user's .mozilla directory and shouldn't affect anyone else
2009-10-10T08:16:00.000Z	Ghnuberath	nullr	so removing it shouldn't change anything
