2011-10-15T18:30:00.000Z	Kruptein		Hey I also updated to 11.10 but somehow my dash often is below my active applications
2011-10-15T18:31:00.000Z	Kruptein		anyone know why my active applications are often atop of dash?  it's quite annoying to always minimize everything to be able to see the dash

2011-10-15T18:34:00.000Z	Kruptein	whyameye	cwillu  well I have the tendency to experiment a lot with my ubuntu  so that if there is a new release almost everything is f*cked up  and I have to do a fresh install :D
