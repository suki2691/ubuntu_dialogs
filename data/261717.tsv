The sound icon in the tray is not showing any soundcards when I click it, and pavucontrol complained (I uninstalled it) with some message about running start-pulseaudio-x11 or something like that, but when I did that, the terminal kept saying something like Connection failure: Connection refused
2012-07-24T19:33:00.000Z	the_dudez0r		pa_context_connect() failed: Connection refused home directory /home/thedude is not ours.
2012-07-24T19:34:00.000Z	Seveas	the_dudez0r	huh? What's the output of ls -lad /home/thedude ?
2012-07-24T19:35:00.000Z	Seveas	the_dudez0r	ok, sorry, then I don't udnerstand it at all
