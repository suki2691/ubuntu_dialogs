2008-01-06T01:55:00.000Z	PurpZeY	MisterChief	Clean install?
2008-01-06T01:56:00.000Z	MisterChief	PurpZeY	I think so, I want to keep all of my /home files, just the gdm settings
2008-01-06T01:56:00.000Z	PurpZeY	MisterChief	I am not entirely sure how to do it, but I have people saying they just make a partition w/ their home dir then reinstall and mount it
