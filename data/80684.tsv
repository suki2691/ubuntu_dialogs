2008-09-15T21:54:00.000Z	Hex101		ah.
2008-09-15T21:54:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	Hex101	are you sure?  I've heard that resize can take a very very long time
2008-09-15T21:55:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	Hex101	think hours mate.  Its gota move the data around and such.  Plus, gparted doesnt support ntfs natively.  I think it needs a plugin
