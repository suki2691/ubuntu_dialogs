2009-02-02T18:03:00.000Z	darth_muzo	dayo_	I think miha's comment was for you - what's the name of the file you're trying to unpack?
2009-02-02T18:04:00.000Z	dayo_	darth_muzo	README.DB_CONFIG.gz  it worked :-)
2009-02-02T18:09:00.000Z	darth_muzo	dayo_	BTW if you're familiar with the command-line, 'less README.DB.CONFIG.gz' should automagically work without having to manually unpack it, due to the wonders of lesspipe
