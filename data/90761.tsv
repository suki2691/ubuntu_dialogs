2010-06-04T19:35:00.000Z	RayzrShrp		is there a place with information about the ubuntu updates?
2010-06-04T19:35:00.000Z	RayzrShrp		I see this morning the linux-image was updated but where can I read what is new in it?
2010-06-04T19:36:00.000Z	SwedeMike	RayzrShrp	there is an annoucement mailing list at least.
