2009-11-01T15:08:00.000Z	wgrant	gsevil	I don't know. Why can't you? What does it do?
2009-11-01T15:11:00.000Z	wgrant	gsevil	Does gnome-screensaver remain installed?
2009-11-01T15:13:00.000Z	gsevil	wgrant	thanks , I've just checked, I forgot that I disabled screensaver in startup, don't know it use to lock screen, it's ok now, thank for your help
