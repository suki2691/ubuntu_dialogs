2009-04-22T01:37:00.000Z	kapax		i hope it will be faster
2009-04-22T01:37:00.000Z	kapax		previous releases on my P4 512 ram machine were too slow. much slower than WinXP
2009-04-22T01:39:00.000Z	Scunizi	kapax	speed sometimes seems slow because of a bad video driver.. I had a P4 2.4Ghz that ran circles around my AMD2+ 4500 w 4 gigs of ram.. until I fixed the video driver
