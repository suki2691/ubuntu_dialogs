2006-01-19T06:06:00.000Z	tristanmike		Hi All, what file controls the Logon Screen, I need to change the refresh rate or the resolution, can anyone please help, my Logon screen is all distorted now, help me clean it up, pretty please, with sugar on top =)

2006-01-19T06:07:00.000Z	tristanmike	egon_spengler	your sure that xorg.conf controls the Logon screen? I had the same problem with my desktop, but changing the resolution hasn't affected the logon screen
