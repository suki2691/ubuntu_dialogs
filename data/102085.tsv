2008-07-18T06:58:00.000Z	nickrud	justs0me	metapackages are simply lists of packages to install. ubuntu-restricted-extras is a list of packages that provides good java, media playback etc, and it comes from the regular ubuntu repos.
2008-07-18T07:00:00.000Z	nickrud	justs0me	there are two packages from medibuntu worth getting: libdvdcss2 , and w32codecs.  http://help.ubuntu.com/Medibuntu has a section on getting them manually, without actually adding the repo
2008-07-18T07:01:00.000Z	justs0me	nickrud	ah, thanks
