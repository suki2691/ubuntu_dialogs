2011-05-05T01:15:00.000Z	billsmith		Does anyone know if changes were made to the 11.4 release just before the announcement?  I have a pre-release version that has problems with intel video.

2011-05-05T01:18:00.000Z	billsmith		BTW, have been running SuSE 11.4 and there are boot problems and video problems with that release that have not been evident with previous versions.
