2007-05-31T09:09:00.000Z	taurusivy		i have installed nv display card driver in my feisty and turn on desktop effect, which is ok. but every gui lost its titlebar afterwards
2007-05-31T09:09:00.000Z	taurusivy		is it because there is NO wm??
2007-05-31T09:09:00.000Z	wols_	taurusivy	with desktop effect you mean beryl?
2007-05-31T09:09:00.000Z	wols_	taurusivy	yes, a WM is needed for titlebars and more
