2008-12-17T11:05:00.000Z	laserline		How do I force eject the cd rom dirver... the button doesn't open the drive and ubuntu say's there probably isn't a cd in the drive, but there is

2008-12-17T11:07:00.000Z	laserline	JasonosaJ	thanks i know i can reboot, but I hate how ubuntu takes control of the eject button on the cd rom driver... i was trying to eject it without restarting
2008-12-17T11:08:00.000Z	laserline	JasonosaJ	 I can understand software eject, but if you hit the eject button on the cd rom drive it should eject if there's a cd in there or not
