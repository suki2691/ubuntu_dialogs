2009-03-31T04:57:00.000Z	fantasyforever		I have a problem - I have a Comcast Router, and I can't connect to the internet, and it shows a webpage that Comcast Install Wizard is not compatible with my OS (Ubuntu)
2009-03-31T04:58:00.000Z	arrrghhh	fantasyforever	have you registered the modem with comcast?
2009-03-31T04:59:00.000Z	arrrghhh	fantasyforever	do you know what i mean by that?  like the router doesn't have internet until the modem is initially setup by comcast.  either by installing their stupid software or having them do it over the phone.
