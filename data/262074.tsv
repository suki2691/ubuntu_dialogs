2008-04-17T22:17:00.000Z	turbo		I was wondering how to add strings together in bash? like the current users name and a domain to end up with Email=[user]@[domain]
2008-04-17T22:17:00.000Z	turbo		domain variable will already be set..
2008-04-17T22:18:00.000Z	Seveas	turbo	this is no bash helochannel. but in this case: email="$USER@$DOMAIN"
2008-04-17T22:19:00.000Z	Seveas	turbo	bash helpchannel is #bash I believe
