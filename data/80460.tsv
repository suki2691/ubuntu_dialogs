2008-09-08T22:25:00.000Z	Vagilinux		i use ubuntu and there is no root.......its the only distro i could get to install properly though. Here's the problem I'm running into: there's a configuration file to change the network workgroup, but I can't edit it because it is read only. It says the owner of the fille is root. No root. Any suggestions?
