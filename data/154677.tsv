2007-05-29T15:17:00.000Z	dcordes		How can I find out which module(s) are used by my logitech webcam? (it is working but I would like to see what I need on a different system)
2007-05-29T15:17:00.000Z	n2diy	dcordes	lsmod
2007-05-29T15:20:00.000Z	dcordes	n2diy	that shows me modules and the modules who depend on it. but i want to see which module is used by what device
2007-05-29T15:21:00.000Z	n2diy	dcordes	can't you deduce that from lsmod?
