2010-05-16T04:35:00.000Z	ZenGuy311		is there a music player that will play songs from archive zip or rar files like foobar2000 can in windows?
2010-05-16T04:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ZenGuy311	not sure, but you can run foobar2000 in Wine
2010-05-16T04:37:00.000Z	ZenGuy311	sebsebseb	I'm running jolicloud which is based on ubuntu jaunty 9.04, foobar2000 jitters sometimes when I play music
2010-05-16T04:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ZenGuy311	well maybe #winehq can help you get it working better in Wine
