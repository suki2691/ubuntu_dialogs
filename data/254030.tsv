2005-01-03T07:19:00.000Z	Kamion	LucaBrasi	that's the latest version in warty.
2005-01-03T07:20:00.000Z	Kamion	LucaBrasi	warty is a stable release, and therefore does not change except for security and other critical updates.
2005-01-03T07:22:00.000Z	LucaBrasi	Kamion	but firefox 0.9.3 is exploitable and 1.0 is the latest anyway
2005-01-03T07:23:00.000Z	Kamion	LucaBrasi	1.0 wasn't released when we released warty, and we backport security patches.
