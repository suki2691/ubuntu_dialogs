2010-11-25T07:28:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	helios_	it is best to just install the libs you need through synaptic or apt-get
2010-11-25T07:29:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	helios_	it is probably not just so simple as moving a file to the lib folder, what lib do you need and why?
2010-11-25T07:33:00.000Z	ubuntu4shane	helios_	that is probably going to require compiling to correctly install it, you need to read the README file
