2010-07-10T19:25:00.000Z	mr_lou		I've searched and searched for codecs that lets me play 3gp files (video recordings from mobile phones) on my Ubuntu machine, without luck. It'll only play the video part. Not the sound. Can anyone help?
2010-07-10T19:26:00.000Z	cyberfux	mr_lou	have you installed the non_free_codecs from medibuntu.org ?
2010-07-10T19:35:00.000Z	mr_lou	cyberfux	Thanks. There were 2 AMR codecs there, installed now, but apparently not the ones needed.
