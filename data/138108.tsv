2008-05-07T08:46:00.000Z	styles		Hey, so whats the proper order to do this? Ive now just reinstalled Ubuntu. I need to install my graphics drivers now right? Do I just chose the driver thats "restricted" that Ubuntu picks?
2008-05-07T08:46:00.000Z	usser	styles	yes just pick the restricted driver and reboot
2008-05-07T08:47:00.000Z	usser	styles	drivers if u have more than 1
