2005-02-13T06:49:00.000Z	Neo_654	_mvo_	what was the cause?
2005-02-13T06:50:00.000Z	_mvo_	Neo_654	a bad line in the sources.list pointing to a backports repository it seems
2005-02-13T06:51:00.000Z	Neo_654	_mvo_	why is it that one simple little line can cause such a bad day and outcome?
2005-02-13T06:52:00.000Z	_mvo_	Neo_654	i haven't really analyzed the problem, but badly expressed dependencies can cause a lot of trouble
