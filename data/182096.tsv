2012-02-28T19:35:00.000Z	nibbler	edgy	ok, misunderstood then. sounds good. but you should get a brandname etc?
2012-02-28T19:36:00.000Z	edgy	nibbler	still I don't think it's hardware raid because live CD linux sees it as two disks ;)
2012-02-28T19:39:00.000Z	nibbler	edgy	as long as its not configured in that way, i'd say u r right ;-)
