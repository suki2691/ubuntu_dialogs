2011-04-24T13:05:00.000Z	nesbitt	cheip	have you enabled your proprietary drivers?
2011-04-24T13:06:00.000Z	cheip	nesbitt	there aren't any drivers to enable, it's an eeepc 1001HA
2011-04-24T13:07:00.000Z	nesbitt	cheip	oh ok.  i'm not sure, maybe changing stuff in Xorg.conf could help, but i'm not too good with that stuff sorry.  give it a google though if you haven't tried it yet
