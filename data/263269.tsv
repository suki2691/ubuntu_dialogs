2006-07-02T05:48:00.000Z	deitarion		I have an Ubuntu-using friend who needs /usr/bin/strip but I use Gentoo so I have no idea what package he needs to install. A little help here?
2006-07-02T05:49:00.000Z	Sanne	deitarion	try to look for the package name on packages.ubuntu.com
2006-07-02T05:50:00.000Z	Sanne	deitarion	I just tested, I have /usr/bin/strip, so it should be installable.
2006-07-02T05:53:00.000Z	Sanne	deitarion	I found strip in package 'binutils', in case you are still looking.
