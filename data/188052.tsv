2006-05-10T15:09:00.000Z	gnomefreak	pat2man	what tools?
2006-05-10T15:09:00.000Z	pat2man		network-admin, users-admin etc
2006-05-10T15:10:00.000Z	pat2man	gnomefreak	nickrud: right, in dapper admins have them and normal users don't, but for instance I have active directory admins who can sudo but don't get the tools
