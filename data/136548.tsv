2007-04-27T15:23:00.000Z	blueyed	neverblue	because you have not installed php probably.
2007-04-27T15:24:00.000Z	neverblue	blueyed	thats not it
2007-04-27T15:25:00.000Z	blueyed	neverblue	are you sure? If Apache does not handle the php files as php, you probably have not installed/setup php correctly. what shoule it be otherwise?
