2008-04-25T03:01:00.000Z	yoursfaithfully		Hi - how do I upgrade from Gutsy without using the Upgrade Manager?  I'd prefer to download a torrent.
2008-04-25T03:01:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick_	yoursfaithfully	you burn the CD, put it in, and it will ask you if you want to install updated packages from the disk

2008-04-25T03:02:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick_	yoursfaithfully	if you burn a hardy disk and put it into your CD drive while you're using Ubuntu, it will show you a dialog on upgrading
