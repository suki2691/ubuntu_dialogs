2010-09-21T01:24:00.000Z	Guest75482	Dulak	sucky == no multithreading, still better for dependencies than cupt :)
2010-09-21T01:28:00.000Z	Guest75482	Dulak	for example, you could be installing package A while downloading package B if A does not depends on anything you dont have already
2010-09-21T01:28:00.000Z	Guest75482	Dulak	aptitude will first download (one file at a time) , then install (in a correct order) one package at a time
