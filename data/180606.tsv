2011-04-05T06:03:00.000Z	Sonja		are there any hacks to make 1024x600 screen resolution less painful? :) the vertical space is often insufficient
2011-04-05T06:04:00.000Z	eamon	Sonja	use browseer in fullscreen mode
2011-04-05T06:04:00.000Z	eamon	Sonja	you can't get any more screen once you're in fullscreen I'm afraid
2011-04-05T06:05:00.000Z	eamon	Sonja	no, it's still the same amount of screen, just the test is smaller
