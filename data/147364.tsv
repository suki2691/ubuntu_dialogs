2007-06-07T05:57:00.000Z	CanadianMan_		i'm having a problem when using beryl, if i have other opened windows on other desktops they all show up on the same window list, is this a bug or a setting i have on?  I'd rather have it where all the opened windows show up on that desktop's window list
2007-06-07T05:58:00.000Z	kitche	CanadianMan_	think it's a feature
2007-06-07T05:58:00.000Z	CanadianMan_	kitche	do you know which one it is or what it's called?
