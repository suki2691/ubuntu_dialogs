2007-10-22T20:49:00.000Z	phil		I have just installed Ubuntu 7.10 and wasn't asked to set up a root password or user account. I'm using my /home dir from my previous account. I'm at the login screen and don't know what to type. Help!
2007-10-22T20:49:00.000Z	phil		Not my previous acount, my previous install ^^

2007-10-22T20:52:00.000Z	phil	IdleOne	etc: Yeah, I've just swapped keyboards and the sticky keys mean that its not having my password, which is what made me panic. hehe, thanks for the help : )
