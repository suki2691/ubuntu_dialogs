2008-10-17T15:14:00.000Z	soundray	xn1	I wasn't wrong. You didn't configure it the way it should be configured to work with gnome.
2008-10-17T15:15:00.000Z	xn1	soundray	That's not the way you presented it, and that's what I was disagreeing with. Anyway, enough time wasted. Lets move on.
2008-10-17T15:15:00.000Z	soundray	xn1	the problem is now that you set out not to solve your issue, but to prove me wrong. That is a waste of my time, so I'll stop responding to you now. There are plenty of people here who are more deserving.
