2009-05-03T17:21:00.000Z	MotivatedWarDog		does anyone know a good emulation program, i tried to use VM Wareplayer, but i couldn't figure out how to just pop an OS install disk into my drive and install it virtually ?

2009-05-03T17:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MotivatedWarDog	 its rather easy to  figure out.
