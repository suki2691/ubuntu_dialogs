2008-09-28T18:53:00.000Z	koala_man	Xenocide	man iwconfig
2008-09-28T18:54:00.000Z	Xenocide	koala_man	You can do it all using iwconfig like you can with ifconfig for eth connections?
2008-09-28T18:54:00.000Z	koala_man	Xenocide	no, you still use ifconfig or dhclient, but the essid&wep is all iwconfig
