2007-01-28T17:13:00.000Z	sova		I have the swedish version but I will try to translate; rm: can not remove "E156_20050812.zip": The filesystem is only readebel
2007-01-28T17:14:00.000Z	variant	sova	that means you need to remount the disk with write permissions
2007-01-28T17:14:00.000Z	variant	sova	it tells you in the "mount" man page
2007-01-28T17:14:00.000Z	variant	sova	type man mount.. you will learn a bunch of other stuff too
