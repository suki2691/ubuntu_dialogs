2006-12-08T09:47:00.000Z	dyzlex		Ok, I have XP Pro x64 installed, and an empty 4gb partition I want to install 6.06 onto. How would I go about a dual boot and not kill my Windows Partition?
2006-12-08T09:49:00.000Z	dyzlex		I think I formatted the partition to NTFS by mistake,
2006-12-08T09:49:00.000Z	dyzlex		So will Ubuntu install onto NTFS?
2006-12-08T09:49:00.000Z	pi1l	dyzlex	no ofcourse!
