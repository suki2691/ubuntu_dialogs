2007-10-22T08:59:00.000Z	mindrape	XiXaQ	- free
2007-10-22T09:00:00.000Z	mindrape	XiXaQ	- well, free is the most accurate.  top only shows you the info for the main process, don't think it captures some subsystem/kernel memory usage
2007-10-22T09:00:00.000Z	mindrape	XiXaQ	- man free    man top... should give you some more history
