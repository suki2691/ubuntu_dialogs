2008-04-26T08:17:00.000Z	Konedima		hey pelo i checked both the lines are fine
2008-04-26T08:18:00.000Z	Konedima		although the first line refers to (hd1,0) or something like that... my unofficial uneducated opinion says theres a chance that could be wrong
2008-04-26T08:20:00.000Z	Konedima		pelo, the first line in the boot thing refers to (hd1,0), which i think could be wrong cause c:\ is the secondary master
2008-04-26T08:20:00.000Z	mojo	Konedima	remember GRUB numbers disks hd0, hd1, etc...
