2005-12-23T08:09:00.000Z	rosen	tiglionabbit	well is there no way to silence all that yelling without disabling java completely ?
2005-12-23T08:10:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	rosen	not that I know of.  I don't really like Sun all that much.  OpenOffice is nice, but I try to avoid java applet things =P
2005-12-23T08:12:00.000Z	rosen	tiglionabbit	think I'll follow your example ;)
