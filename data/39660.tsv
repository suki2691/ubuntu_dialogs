2010-05-12T13:00:00.000Z	RWHR	Tm_T	It was just a quicker and easier "fix" to be able to limit the number of kernels seen. I guess removing Kernels will also save a little bit of space too?
2010-05-12T13:01:00.000Z	Tm_T	RWHR	yes, and if you don't use the old kernels, they are just wasting the space (:
2010-05-12T13:01:00.000Z	Tm_T	RWHR	but I recommend keeping two latest installed, just in case
