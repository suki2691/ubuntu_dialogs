2007-01-17T14:01:00.000Z	ikonia_	Beakster	if you have to ask - apt-get
2007-01-17T14:01:00.000Z	Beakster	ikonia_	im ok with installing from source, i just wondered if there were issues that are resolved by using latest version
2007-01-17T14:02:00.000Z	ikonia_	Beakster	don't install from source - use apt-get
