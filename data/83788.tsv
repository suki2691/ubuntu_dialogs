2009-09-01T14:18:00.000Z	lstarnes	tarelerulz	it will be included by default in ubuntu 9.10
2009-09-01T14:20:00.000Z	lstarnes	tarelerulz	arand: the package is firefox-3.5, not Shitetoko
2009-09-01T14:21:00.000Z	lstarnes	tarelerulz	arand: the package doesn't use the official mozilla firefox branding, so it uses the default development branding (also known as shiretoko, based on its codename)
