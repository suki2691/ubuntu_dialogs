2012-10-30T19:50:00.000Z	cannonball		hi all, I just upgraded from 11.04 to 11.10 IIRC.  I no longer have the Gnome Desktop and am using Unity.  The terminal app (Terminator) is on one of the quick launch buttons, but it only launches one.  When I double click on it again to open a second terminal, it just brings focus to the first one.
