2010-11-18T02:37:00.000Z	egsome		Is there a problem that i use Ubuntu 10.04 LTS even after releasing 10.10 and more non-LTS Releases ? Will i get all software, libraries, .. on my system updated while using it ?

2010-11-18T02:40:00.000Z	egsome	guntbert	No problem for that, but what if I want to install some new version that depends on a new version of some library, Would I have to update that library manually ?
