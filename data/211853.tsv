2006-03-30T12:47:00.000Z	Blippe	arkanis	depends on when it did, install?
2006-03-30T12:50:00.000Z	Blippe	arkanis	is it during a normal install the "target" is nothin if it was during a debootstrap to get 32 bits to run under a 64 bits enviromnent it is where you debottstrapteed 'em, so again, when does this problem appear?
2006-03-30T12:51:00.000Z	Blippe	arkanis	you don't know what you are doing? are you installing or not?
