2005-08-24T11:53:00.000Z	ridiie		Hi, I am trying to install Ubuntu to my secondary HD... if I were to use the unbuntu ISO CD to boot at startup.. will it write anything to my primary HD?

2005-08-24T11:54:00.000Z	Lathiat	ridiie	ubuntu's boot manager offers an option to start windows, however
2005-08-24T11:54:00.000Z	Lathiat	ridiie	or you could install the boot manager on your second hard drive and ask your bios to boot from that hard drive rahter than the first one (doesnt work on all computers)
