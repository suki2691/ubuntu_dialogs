2010-01-25T22:02:00.000Z	Damianos_		can somebody tell help me with some display issues? I hooked my karmic box up to my HDTV and I get a "not compatible with this signal" error
2010-01-25T22:03:00.000Z	DreamDemon	Damianos_	your lacking in some details like the HDTV type and video card
2010-01-25T22:04:00.000Z	DreamDemon	Damianos_	For your HDTV, I'm gonna guess that you need specific timings since most dont conform to standard monitor configurations
2010-01-25T22:06:00.000Z	DreamDemon	Damianos_	Your not comparing apples to apples ( no pun intended).  MAC's usually have their hardware set up different then a standard PC.  I tried with my deskto and had similiar problems with my Vizio
