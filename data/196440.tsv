2008-07-24T08:38:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Bios_Element_	 thats a little vague.. :)
2008-07-24T08:40:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Bios_Element_	 i just turn the spekers off when i want to use the headsets :) on the switch i got on the desk.  A lot can depend on the exact sound card you got from what ive heard.
2008-07-24T08:41:00.000Z	dr_Willis	Bios_Element_	 part of the reason to the pulse audio stuff - i belive was to make such things easier.
