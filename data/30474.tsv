2012-04-22T03:36:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	cfedde	less than 100ms is my goal
2012-04-22T03:37:00.000Z	boxbeatsy		when you say use grep, are you suggesting i set up a simple paste webserver and then grep a text file with all the data for a keyword and then sorting in programming logic?
2012-04-22T03:38:00.000Z	cfedde	boxbeatsy	you did not say anyting up front about a web front end. But sure.  a text field to collect the string and then grep agains the data seems like a simple approach.
