2007-10-29T14:10:00.000Z	archon		Hello guys, ive been trying to install ubuntu through wubi and have been running into a small problem.  When I boot into the "linux" boot option to install ubuntu, I get an error (something about drive 80 and having to run fdisk).  I have run chkdsk and done a defrag on the drive in question, it all checks out.

2007-10-29T14:11:00.000Z	archon	minus	 normally I would, but my cd drive is running off a IDE controller card and does not get recognized by the Mobo
