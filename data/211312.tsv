2007-07-08T13:34:00.000Z	manganic		hello
2007-07-08T13:35:00.000Z	manganic		perhaps someone can answer this question for me - is it possible to adjust the colour depth withOUT editing xorg.conf?
2007-07-08T13:35:00.000Z	manganic		I need to go to 8-bit colour in order to use the terminal without causing a crash
2007-07-08T13:36:00.000Z	bluefox83	manganic	nope...color depth is done in xorg.conf...
