2006-10-15T05:38:00.000Z	Diego		Alright guys. I just formatted C: and reinstalled WinXP on a 20GB partition in my 80GB hdd. I have my trusty Ubuntu CD next to me. What do I do now? I was told I needed to boot from it and create /, /home and swap partitions. Is this done from the Ubuntu CD or do I need something special?
2006-10-15T05:39:00.000Z	Diego		So I just pop it in, boot from it and off I go?
