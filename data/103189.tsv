2008-03-30T20:32:00.000Z	azexian		there are over 1000 people in this channel, someone must know! all I need is, 'yes that's correct', or 'no, not quite, this is how it works' when I convert a movie to vob with devede, the default is to change the bitrate to 5000, should I change that to the files original bitrate, or will the quality be different if I do this?
2008-03-30T20:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	azexian	thats a fairly specific question, maybe people here don't know
2008-03-30T20:34:00.000Z	azexian	IndyGunFreak	is there a better place to ask? #devede is non-existent, anywhere else I might try? with over 1000 people, there's someone who knows
2008-03-30T20:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	azexian	well, if someone knew, they'd respond
