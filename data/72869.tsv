2011-04-28T08:23:00.000Z	cdoktor19		even my processor not AMD based ?
2011-04-28T08:23:00.000Z	temporarytao	cdoktor19	be warned though. i think flash isn't that great with 64 flavor yet
2011-04-28T08:28:00.000Z	temporarytao	cdoktor19	that's a bit involved. probably best if you stick with 32 bit first, IMHO.
