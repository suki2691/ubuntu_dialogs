2005-06-03T15:05:00.000Z	amittp		Hey Hi, I am new to ubuntu liked, it, but I have one small question, why is there different project called kubuntu? can we not just apt-get kde and use it?
2005-06-03T15:05:00.000Z	amittp		is there something that will restrict me from deviating from gnome wm to something other?
2005-06-03T15:05:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	amittp	nothing is restricting
2005-06-03T15:06:00.000Z	Fator_Dee	amittp	it's just that people want that kind of distro that only includes kde, so they made it
