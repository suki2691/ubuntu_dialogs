2010-04-20T22:45:00.000Z	Pici	bappy2	Lucid is not yet released, and as such, its support is only in #ubuntu+1 at the moment.
2010-04-20T22:46:00.000Z	Pici	bappy2	It will be released on the 29th.
2010-04-20T22:47:00.000Z	Pici	bappy2	Because you just supplied the '-d' argument, which says that you want to upgrade to the Development release.
