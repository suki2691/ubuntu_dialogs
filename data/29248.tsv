2010-07-10T23:23:00.000Z	meowsus	Caer	i think it's because i had p7zip installed instead. I didnt see a switch for a password command
2010-07-10T23:25:00.000Z	Caer	meowsus	I meant that you had to try with the same file in the same archive ; as for p7zip I'm told it's the same ; maybe try with an empty password?
