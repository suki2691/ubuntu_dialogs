2007-02-01T17:31:00.000Z	Ricket		Okay so I started my Ubuntu (actually Edubuntu, although I uninstalled the edubuntu features) computer this morning to a lovely error message, something to the tune of an automatic fsck failed so i have to do it manually and then reboot.
2007-02-01T17:31:00.000Z	Ricket		I have seen this once before too; what is it? what's the problem?
2007-02-01T17:32:00.000Z	Xif	Ricket	sounds like a hard drive problem.
2007-02-01T17:52:00.000Z	Ricket	Xif	can be accessed easily through a browser, which is just cool.
