2006-08-03T05:45:00.000Z	n3rdism		I've set up my new monitor and its running 1680x1050 just fine, xorg.conf is up to speed and I ran the xserver setup to adjust anything. But for some reason, when I try to play a movie, or start a game. the program closes; for instance VLC closes right after I load a movie into it. Can anyone help?
