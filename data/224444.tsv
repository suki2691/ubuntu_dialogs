2005-11-03T16:25:00.000Z	thrush	eSPete	maybe try a dos boot disk and undelete?
2005-11-03T16:26:00.000Z	eSPete	thrush	that's an option, but if there was a was to pull this from within linux it would be nice
2005-11-03T16:27:00.000Z	thrush	eSPete	im sure linux has file recovery tools but ive never looked into them sorry ;)
