2007-08-10T07:56:00.000Z	Stormx2	s0crates	Maybe no one knows the solution?
2007-08-10T07:57:00.000Z	s0crates	Stormx2	I think it's pretty straight forwards, just not used to the ubuntu sys
2007-08-10T07:57:00.000Z	s0crates	Stormx2	maybe you can look :  I have broadcom wireless, my kernel tries to load a .fw that doesn't exist at startup.
