2008-03-26T23:25:00.000Z	KalEl		i installed this torrent called rtorrent - looks very complicated
2008-03-26T23:26:00.000Z	KalEl		so i am using ktshell of ktorrent since i needed a torrent client that i can control from command line
2008-03-26T23:27:00.000Z	DRebellion	KalEl	apt-cache search torrent | grep torrent   <---- will give you lots of command line torrents to install
