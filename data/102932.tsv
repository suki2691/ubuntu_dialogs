2009-09-02T06:30:00.000Z	Spirits-Sight		what is the mount point I should use or do I make up one?
2009-09-02T06:30:00.000Z	Spirits-Sight		for ISO mounting as drive
2009-09-02T06:32:00.000Z	histo	Spirits-Sight	you should be able to browse isos by just double clicking on them btw
2009-09-02T06:34:00.000Z	histo	Spirits-Sight	you don't have to mount it with another app to play it
