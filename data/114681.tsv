2009-02-03T05:33:00.000Z	slylias		I need to reinstall windows on a dual boot box, but windows helpfully overwrites the MBR, so I want to back it up before doing the reinstall. However I don't know where ubuntu has mounted the MBR.
2009-02-03T05:34:00.000Z	slylias		Yes, but how do I find out where that is in my file system?
2009-02-03T05:34:00.000Z	binarymutant	slylias	I think it lives outside the filesystem
