2008-04-10T02:39:00.000Z	binarical-app	abdrahim	the best way to do it would be to ask your admin to "let" you into the windows network. you will still however need to use samba to share "your" folders with the windows network
2008-04-10T02:41:00.000Z	binarical-app	abdrahim	to do this find your ip address , take it to the "network admin" pc and enter it as okay in system settings. on your computer attempt to "network". install samba, configure your shared folder
