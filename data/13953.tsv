2011-05-24T00:12:00.000Z	improveupon		my gui keeps crashing after being in hibernate (on a laptop) when a flash video was playing in firefox. only the mouse pointer still moves. sound keeps coming in, and you can still pull up a f1-f6 terminal. is there anything i should try from the terminal? should i restart x? is that what crashed? any ideas welcomome. thankyou

2011-05-24T00:14:00.000Z	butter_fs	improveupon	if so, try this:  switch to vt1, and then hibernate (I can look up the command if you don't have it set to a button or whatever)
