2011-08-14T23:57:00.000Z	Augustuen		I have a friend that selected Home directory encryption on his Ubuntu server, now he has forgotten his password and changed it, how does he get it decrypted?
2011-08-14T23:57:00.000Z	Augustuen		so unless he remembers his old password the files are gone?
2011-08-14T23:58:00.000Z	guntbert	Augustuen	when he enabled encryption he was told to record the encryption passphrase and store it in a safe place, he can use that
2011-08-14T23:59:00.000Z	guntbert	Augustuen	now, it is a random string
