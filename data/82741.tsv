2010-09-27T01:08:00.000Z	Friar		anyone have any experience with server motherboards? I'm looking to build a dedicated server instead of my 10 year old computer....I'm looking at this one: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131228
2010-09-27T01:08:00.000Z	Friar		I guess I'm wondering if anyone has used it, or would have any comments about it.
2010-09-27T01:09:00.000Z	Friar		is there an issue that the motherboard only supports ddr2 800?
