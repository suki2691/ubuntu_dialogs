2007-01-14T06:42:00.000Z	Spee_Der	Guerra	I prefer Ubuntu Dapper Drake v6.06 LTS
2007-01-14T06:44:00.000Z	Spee_Der	Guerra	Ubuntu seems to have the best support group going. LTS = Long Term Support.
2007-01-14T06:45:00.000Z	Spee_Der	Guerra	Fedora is a fine version, don't get me wrong. It is just my opinion on Ubuntu is all.
