2009-03-08T11:10:00.000Z	wanttotryubuntu		[ btw i called my hardware guy but he said its a virus and i will have to format my hard drive, but i KNOW that he has no idea what ubuntu is ]
2009-03-08T11:11:00.000Z	wanttotryubuntu		if i am booting from live cd, and even though there is a virus on hard drive, linux cant or shouldnt be hurt by it i suppose? [ though i have latest panda antivirus and there is no virus on my system ]
