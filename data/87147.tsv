2008-06-22T04:42:00.000Z	vocx	aditya2	well, in the MBR yes, not in the windows system folder. I feel like you are taking unnecessary pain to accomplish this. Are you sure the guides don't cover what you are attempting to do?
2008-06-22T04:45:00.000Z	vocx	aditya2	I think it tells you to do something like "grub" and then "root (hd0)"  and stuff, that should be enough
2008-06-22T04:46:00.000Z	aditya2	vocx	 i changed those stuff, but still there is no option to load Xp, i rebooted after changing
