2011-12-07T21:36:00.000Z	koichirose		Hi, I'm using Gnome3 Classic on Ubuntu 11.10. The 'gnome-open' command now opens the containing folder instead of directly opening the file. What do I need to do to fix it?

2011-12-07T21:39:00.000Z	koichirose	MonkeyDust	then? I already set everything there. If I double click a file on Nautilus it opens the correct application, whatever the file is. Same file with gnome-open, opens the containing folder
