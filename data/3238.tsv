2012-05-06T01:21:00.000Z	stafford		I am looking for some solution regarding tuning down the power consumption of Ubuntu 10.04.
2012-05-06T01:22:00.000Z	stafford		I only use it for Internet browsing and reading materials.
2012-05-06T01:22:00.000Z	OerHeks	stafford	upgrade to 12.04, most power issues are fixed in kernel 3.2
2012-05-06T01:23:00.000Z	stafford	OerHeks	is 12.04 out?
