2011-08-19T23:12:00.000Z	rohdef		can anyone explain the rationale of preferring apt-get over aptitude?
2011-08-19T23:14:00.000Z	rohdef		also aptitude has a ncurses ui per default
2011-08-19T23:15:00.000Z	rohdef		that's my reasons for aptitude, but I've been wondering if there was some good reasons that I shouldn't use aptitude too
2011-08-19T23:16:00.000Z	h00k	rohdef	beacuse ubuntu has apt-get, rather than aptitude by default, probably.
