2009-06-23T23:02:00.000Z	pronoy	ubuntunom_	open the directory containing the video file and select open with vlc in properties by right clicking on it
2009-06-23T23:03:00.000Z	ubuntunom_	pronoy	did it with .vob file but still open movie player
2009-06-23T23:05:00.000Z	pronoy	ubuntunom_	did you check mark the option... ? its really irritating when it opens with movie player....now after check mark it opens with vlc only
