2008-02-11T12:50:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic		quick question:  I"m wanting to make menuconfig and need to know where ubuntu puts source installed from the package manager
2008-02-11T12:50:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic		*I* didn't put it anywhere, I simply selected the package marked linux source and let the package manager do it's thing
2008-02-11T12:51:00.000Z	shnastybiznastic		I'm helping someone with a slackware install deal with menuconfig, and I can't find the source to look at the menu myself
2008-02-11T12:52:00.000Z	rettopnam	shnastybiznastic	 did you check /var/apt/cache/ ?  I'm not sure if source files are somewhere else tho
