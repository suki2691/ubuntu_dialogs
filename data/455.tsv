2012-11-12T20:26:00.000Z	lonewulf85	WDKevin	Then the lack of automation is what might have caused it. Can you access the files right now?
2012-11-12T20:29:00.000Z	lonewulf85	WDKevin	You might need to re automatize the mounting of the files, then reboot and see if you can get them back to the way the were.
2012-11-12T20:29:00.000Z	lonewulf85	WDKevin	Oh okay.
