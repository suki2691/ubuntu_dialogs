2005-06-24T05:15:00.000Z	HillTop		OK, OK, so no one here empties trash but I need to empty trash. I'm using Hoary (installed on HD) and running out of disk space. Thanks.
2005-06-24T05:16:00.000Z	djm62	HillTop	bottom right trash icon, right-click, select "Empty Wastebasket"?
2005-06-24T05:16:00.000Z	djm62		is it apt-get -b install mondo ? or apt-get -b source mondo?
