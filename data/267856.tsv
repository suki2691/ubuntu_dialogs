2007-10-28T18:36:00.000Z	StupidMop		I have an Ubuntu install disc. How can i tell if it is the Alternate install or the Desktop install?
2007-10-28T18:37:00.000Z	crimsun	StupidMop	the desktop has an X Window System (GUI) look-n-feel
2007-10-28T18:37:00.000Z	crimsun	StupidMop	the alternate is text (ncurses-)based
2007-10-28T18:37:00.000Z	crimsun	StupidMop	you can check the md5sum
