2008-06-02T03:21:00.000Z	Marty81		hey everyone.. I just booted my Ubuntu comp and (from last night to now) it doesn't aquire an IP address from my DHCP server (router) any ideas?
2008-06-02T03:22:00.000Z	robdig	Marty81	ive had that happen occasionally, just do these two commands         sudo ifdown -a          sudo ifup -a
2008-06-02T03:27:00.000Z	robdig	Marty81	sounds like someone has changed the permissions of the sudo command...
2008-06-02T03:30:00.000Z	robdig	Marty81	to fix, you will likely need to boot up in recovery mode and fix the permissions. once in recovery mode, think this will do it         chmod u+s /bin/sudo
