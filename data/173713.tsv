2009-11-01T19:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Stefan_	Sounds like  a few people have had issues upgrading  9.04 to 9.10,  probably better to clean install,  plus then get default Ext4 and Grub 2
2009-11-01T19:55:00.000Z	Stefan_	sebsebseb	thank you. but i have many distributions installed. master is gentoo with its grub. how can i get the source of the error? fortunately i am not faced with any freezes or somethind like this. the pc runs wihout problems
