2004-10-05T10:58:00.000Z	khwarizmi		I have a question: how can I add a custom folder to the Applications menu? (even though this is certainly GNOME-specific)
2004-10-05T10:59:00.000Z	leorme	khwarizmi	nautilus-->applications: create directory. it should work.
2004-10-05T11:04:00.000Z	khwarizmi	leorme	thanks, the hint is working. And aprospos Nautilus, is there a way to customize the "Go to" menu, for that I don't have to type "applications:///" by hand everytime?
