2008-11-16T16:01:00.000Z	histo	lvsmthng	glxgears is not a good tool for benchmarking
2008-11-16T16:02:00.000Z	lvsmthng	histo	you are right. but it is probaly maybe used in some situations
2008-11-16T16:03:00.000Z	lvsmthng	histo	and glxgears one and only widely recognized benchmark in existance for linux :D
