2011-03-10T18:23:00.000Z	DannyButterman		Can someone help me with a laserjet p1566 that cannot wake up from its 'desactivated' mode ? It works at startup but after several minute without printing, it  enters this desactivated mode and then I can't print any more

2011-03-10T18:33:00.000Z	DannyButterman	ruan	this is a power saving mode. unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be a way to get rid of it
