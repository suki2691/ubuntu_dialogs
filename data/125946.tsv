2007-10-04T09:45:00.000Z	Polygon89	musikgoat	its a lot easier to just say gutsy..feisty...etc xD
2007-10-04T09:46:00.000Z	musikgoat	Polygon89	your right, but that doesn't explain this ubuntu 7  that i keep hearing people say
2007-10-04T09:46:00.000Z	Polygon89	musikgoat	heh true. saying ubuntu 7 is incorrect as it could refer to feisty or gutsy
