2005-04-10T12:23:00.000Z	Zevin		i'm an experienced pc user, used linux once or twice before. i was able to install unbuntu in a dual boot enviroment, and activate my wifi card with minimal effort. it has everything a basic user needs.

2005-04-10T12:24:00.000Z	noobuntu	Zevin	the only catch i had was that eth0 wasn't activated.  i went into networking GUI and turned it on though, no problem
