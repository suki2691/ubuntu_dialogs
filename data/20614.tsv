2011-05-06T20:26:00.000Z	Adamantus		I have a question about open source: People say that if something was going on in the code then people would know about it, but is anyone checking or has time to check code of the software they use? I supose if they are copying and building something new but otherwise..
2011-05-06T20:27:00.000Z	schnuffle	Adamantus	most people don't check, but everyone is able to check if he wants to
2011-05-06T20:28:00.000Z	Adamantus	schnuffle	So you're saying that is enough of a deterent, for example: Being reported for file sharing by a bittorrent client (not ubuntu q related I know).
2011-05-06T20:30:00.000Z	schnuffle	Adamantus	don't understand your question. I would recommend it this way. As long as you use official repositories you're on the save side.
