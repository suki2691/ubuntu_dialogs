2005-05-31T08:02:00.000Z	sargo		I loaded GNome on Kubuntu and really like it better than KDE but it always says it can't find gnome-fs-home icons and I can't change my themes.  Anyone have any ideas? I've reloaded ubuntu-desktop about 50 times.
2005-05-31T08:03:00.000Z	sargo		So am I better off just reloading Ubuntu and wiping out Kubuntu?
2005-05-31T08:03:00.000Z	sargo		I just hate loosing all that I've put into it.
