2008-02-06T21:54:00.000Z	Photo1	woodwizzle	can't you just go to the /etc/X11 folder, copy xorg.conf, and double click the copy? :)
2008-02-06T21:56:00.000Z	woodwizzle	Photo1	 Arn't there some CLI tools that automatically generate one? I have a very complicated setup and I want to see if one of those tools gives me a better template to start from
2008-02-06T21:57:00.000Z	Photo1	woodwizzle	dunno, I'm new. I just want to add a correct 1920x1200 resolution to an incorrect file :)
