2011-04-28T01:26:00.000Z	Soothsayer		what time exactly does Ubuntu 11.04 stable launch? :)
2011-04-28T01:27:00.000Z	Pici	Soothsayer	Natty is not yet released and there is no predetermined time on the 28th when it will be. Await the release in #ubuntu-release-party or for more questions join #ubuntu+1
2011-04-28T01:28:00.000Z	Soothsayer	Pici	I see.. but surely in the next 24 hours?
2011-04-28T01:29:00.000Z	Pici	Soothsayer	Sometime on the 28th, so yes.
