2006-05-28T12:02:00.000Z	azurehuesofblue		I have this IP adress from this small town in cali (palto alto) maybe it's not so small in the computer world... and it's always hanging around... and I think it might be an X friend or something, but it's always there, how do I find out more about it?
2006-05-28T12:03:00.000Z	hastesaver	azurehuesofblue	what do you mean the IP address is "there"? Where is it? Trying to access your comp?
2006-05-28T12:03:00.000Z	azurehuesofblue		no, it's always on like... EtherApe and sniffers.
