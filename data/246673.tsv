2008-02-06T22:05:00.000Z	mrdlouisd		I have a pen drive that has the boot flag option on and I can't get it to turn off. I'm extremely new to linux and just cant figure out how to format it.
2008-02-06T22:05:00.000Z	mrdlouisd		it shows the locked icon
2008-02-06T22:05:00.000Z	mrdlouisd		and i cant get it off
2008-02-06T22:05:00.000Z	jetscreamer	mrdlouisd	you would use fdisk to remove the boot flag..
