2004-09-28T09:48:00.000Z	renners		hrdwr_BoB: yesterday I asked you about screen res (I could only get 1024, not 1280). FYI I have fixed this by re-installing and picking the correct res during setup! thanks.

2004-09-28T09:51:00.000Z	renners		anyway to speed up grub... it take 30 seconds to load on my XP dual-boot system (and don't say ditch XP!!!)
