2010-08-28T21:30:00.000Z	laura_		i need some help in uninstalling something I found on my system that I dont want there. I was reading through the Ubuntu User Days Trusted Software presentation and they mentioned chkrootkit. I ran that and it says I have an infected one called bindshell. How do I get rid of it?
