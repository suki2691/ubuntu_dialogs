2008-06-20T20:54:00.000Z	Mr_Cheeto		hey, when i play back MP3's in Amarok for Kaffene it seems to play at higher than normal speed, what's wrong with the playback?
2008-06-20T20:54:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Mr_Cheeto	sample rate weirdness?
2008-06-20T20:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Mr_Cheeto	no idea, I don't use amarok, sorry
2008-06-20T20:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Mr_Cheeto	as a handy hint, if you're playing back a 44.1kHz recording at 48kHz it will be about a semitone and a half sharp
