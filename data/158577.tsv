2010-01-08T15:29:00.000Z	mkulke		hello i have an issue with using compiz: i use multiple desktops alot, and when i have the pidgin buddy list open on some desktop i can't seem to get it to my active desktop. i always have to "search" for it on the other desktops and close it there. anyone knows a way around this?
2010-01-08T15:30:00.000Z	Slart	mkulke	can't you set it to be a "widget" or whatever it's called.. so it appears on all desktops?
2010-01-08T15:32:00.000Z	mkulke	Slart	how would i make pidgin a widget? i use the ubuntu mail-thingie in the top bar, where also evolution and empathy is located
2010-01-08T15:33:00.000Z	Slart	mkulke	there is a setting somewhere... I think it was in pidgin somewhere.. or in the compiz configuration thingy.. let me check
