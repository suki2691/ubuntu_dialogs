2007-10-18T20:03:00.000Z	soothsayer		How do I unhold all the packages I currently have on hold?
2007-10-18T20:03:00.000Z	kl4m	soothsayer	I think apt-get -f
2007-10-18T20:04:00.000Z	kl4m	soothsayer	There is also --ignore-hold but it seems unsafe.
2007-10-18T20:05:00.000Z	soothsayer	kl4m	Aren't those temporary? I mean, won't the packages still be on hold for future upgrades?
