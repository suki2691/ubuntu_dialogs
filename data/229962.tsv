2005-10-02T14:07:00.000Z	barongas		Is there a way to reset my firefox and remove all installed plugins? I have been toying around with it and now it's acting up weirdly. apt-get removing it requires that I remove my entire ubuntu-desktop which would suck

2005-10-02T14:09:00.000Z	tristanmike	barongas	I've been running with out the ubuntu-desktop package for like 4 days without realizing it, and I just reinstalled it last night
