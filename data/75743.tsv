2008-11-02T09:17:00.000Z	billygalbreath	g0bl1n	i also found that very weird, so i filled it in to my likings since it was too generic for me to feel comfortable enough to sleep at night
2008-11-02T09:18:00.000Z	g0bl1n	billygalbreath	but was it working before?
2008-11-02T09:18:00.000Z	billygalbreath	g0bl1n	yup - worked fine. i just didnt feel right being so generic.
