2011-12-30T20:14:00.000Z	enav	sl1ck	you can install  lubuntu the unofficial version but is quite nice and fast
2011-12-30T20:15:00.000Z	sl1ck	enav	I would like to avoid another OS (re)install
2011-12-30T20:16:00.000Z	enav	sl1ck	if im you i will reinstall because is a faster process with no collateral flaws
