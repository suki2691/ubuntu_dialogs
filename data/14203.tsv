2011-09-20T16:14:00.000Z	ujjain	MrPopinjay	right, fair point :) I just wonder if I should even get a seperate for both, but gaming is a fair point.
2011-09-20T16:16:00.000Z	MrPopinjay	ujjain	If I didn't do those things and I didn't get backache from hunching over a laptop all the time I'd certainly just spend the money on a slightly more powerful laptop, that's for sure.
