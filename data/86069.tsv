2008-08-02T08:38:00.000Z	riegersn		after i set my options in firestarter, i don't have to it running to be protected right?
2008-08-02T08:39:00.000Z	rww	riegersn	the GUI portion of it? no. if i remember correctly (i last used it a few years ago), it's loaded on startup automatically without you needing to run anything
2008-08-02T08:40:00.000Z	rww	riegersn	you only need to run the GUI to change settings, and don't need to keep it running
2008-08-02T08:40:00.000Z	riegersn	rww	thanks
