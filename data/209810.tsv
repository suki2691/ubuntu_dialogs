2005-11-09T15:16:00.000Z	LjL	sunshine82	quit from what?
2005-11-09T15:20:00.000Z	LjL	sunshine82	actually... i'm in KDE, but i *think* in Gnome you can just right-click on a window or something similar, and there will be a "kill" menu option somewhere
2005-11-09T15:20:00.000Z	LjL	sunshine82	also, in KDE i can do Ctrl+Esc, and a task list will appear, and i can kill tasks from there
