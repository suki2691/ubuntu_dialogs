2005-12-27T08:26:00.000Z	liable	Kuyaedz	you prolly want hotwayd
2005-12-27T08:27:00.000Z	Kuyaedz	martianpenguin	as far as I know hotmail & msn are proprietary MS crap but I've heard it can be done..
2005-12-27T08:28:00.000Z	liable	Kuyaedz	hotmail can be retrieved with hotwayd, sent (supposedly) with hotsmtp..
