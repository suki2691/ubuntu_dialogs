2010-01-20T01:00:00.000Z	filthpig		Hi guys. I have a Radeon 9200 Mobility card in my laptop, using Karmic. When I enable desktop effects the deskop background goes black, and if I maximize windows they also turn black. Some guy has reported a similar problem (with similar gfx-card) here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1302069
2010-01-20T01:01:00.000Z	filthpig		any ideas how to fix?
