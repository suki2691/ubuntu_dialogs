2006-06-24T11:31:00.000Z	OMGLAZERS		Would anyone mind telling me what kind of program I can use similar to Daemon tools to mount a .cue/.bin as a drive or can Linux mount it on it's own?

2006-06-24T11:33:00.000Z	OMGLAZERS	stefg	It's not actually warez. I have an online backup storage and I usually put them into iso or bin/cue format for when my data needs to get moved
