2010-05-05T18:19:00.000Z	EgYPaRaDoX		I installed lucid, then I installed kubuntu-desktop, I logged out, changed the session and logged in as a KDE session, and came back to GNOME, I updated lucid then I found  my pointer is ox-white although I am logged in as  a GNOME session

2010-05-05T18:23:00.000Z	EgYPaRaDoX		a bug?
