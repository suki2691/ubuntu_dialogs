2010-02-07T20:22:00.000Z	Eremite	jellow_	no its not the default.  Ubuntu has officially hijacked my browser and replaced my start page.  It also opens FireFox ON ITS OWN without my consent.  This is nothing short of a hijack and I want to know WHY and how to fix it. Who at Ubuntu thinks that we should all open our browsers to the Ubuntu One page when we start our PC?  This is FORCING the user to do something. Surely it goes against the standard Linux ethics.
