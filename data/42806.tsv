2009-12-05T01:12:00.000Z	ngirard		/dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdb2 don't show up in nautilus. And lshal -m doesn't see them either. However dmesg reports them. Could someone help ?
2009-12-05T01:13:00.000Z	NeoNexus	ngirard	what are sdb1 and 2, ie what format?
2009-12-05T01:15:00.000Z	NeoNexus	ngirard	do a "ls /media" at a terminal, see what u got in there
2009-12-05T01:19:00.000Z	ngirard	NeoNexus	?? sorry but there's no point here in listing directories. Anyway, i've found a workaround. I couldn't get 'em via e-Sata but using usb 2 it worked. Thanks anyway for your assistance. Cheers !
