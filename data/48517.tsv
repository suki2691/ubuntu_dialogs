2009-09-15T17:05:00.000Z	Nicd-	Halitech	Dr_Willis, isn't Xvnc supposed to work as an X server for the applications? shouldn't it be possible for it to replace X then?
2009-09-15T17:06:00.000Z	Halitech	Nicd-	no, it acts as a forwarder for a currently running x server
2009-09-15T17:08:00.000Z	Nicd-	Halitech	this says otherwise: http://www.realvnc.com/products/free/4.1/man/Xvnc.html
