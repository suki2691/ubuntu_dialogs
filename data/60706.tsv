2010-07-17T00:32:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	bastid_raZor	yeah, I just found out about the update-motd package. :D
2010-07-17T01:38:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	[4-tea-2]	that creates a nohup.log that logs all the output from the command, which if run for several days/weeks can get very large.
2010-07-17T01:39:00.000Z	[4-tea-2]	bastid_raZor	indeed, I failed to mention that, because it will say so anyway if he tries it.
