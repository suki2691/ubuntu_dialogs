2008-04-04T04:51:00.000Z	BarryToeman	AlexHoover	did the printing problems start today?  There was a CUPS update today.
2008-04-04T04:53:00.000Z	AlexHoover	BarryToeman	no
2008-04-04T04:55:00.000Z	BarryToeman	AlexHoover	my HP printer does the same thing sometimes, but I haven't debugged it yet...so I'm effectively useless.
2008-04-04T04:55:00.000Z	AlexHoover	BarryToeman	hmm. It's an HP PSC 2350.
