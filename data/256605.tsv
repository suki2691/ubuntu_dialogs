2012-07-29T22:41:00.000Z	Nikyo		Hi guys, this issue is got me very confused. Can not get Adobe flash plugin 11.2 r202 to work in Firefox 14.0.1 Ubuntu 12.04. Installed ubuntu-restricted-extras. It looks like it tries to work. I even went the extreme in wiping the hard drive and starting from scratch. Still not working. :/

2012-07-29T22:44:00.000Z	Nikyo		<dr_willis>: On one of my computers, no issue with flash, this computer it's not working..
