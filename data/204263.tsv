2011-08-01T12:55:00.000Z	idefix		I have tried another client but I'd like to keep on using this one
2011-08-01T12:55:00.000Z	jussi	idefix	did you have the issue in the other client?
2011-08-01T12:56:00.000Z	idefix	jussi	yes I still got spam using the other client
2011-08-01T12:58:00.000Z	idefix	jussi	what could that mean? do I need some sort of upgrade of ubuntu?
