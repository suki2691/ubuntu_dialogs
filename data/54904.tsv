2009-06-07T15:34:00.000Z	teeps		Hi, I'm having a huge amount of trouble getting my wireless card to work - I've tried so much stuff with ndiswrapper and so on but I haven't had any luck. Can anyone offer any assistance?

2009-06-07T15:35:00.000Z	bakarat	teeps	which version are you running?
2009-06-07T15:35:00.000Z	teeps	bakarat	nope, just vanilla 9.04 - I have no connection for this comp exept wireless so I can't update
