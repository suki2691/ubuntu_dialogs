2011-04-21T16:18:00.000Z	ilyekkakai		I have a problem with audio file playback (all formats - mp3, ogg, etc.). When I try to play a file with rhythmbox or totem, the whole system gets sluggish and the mouse pointer jerks about the screen and there is no sound... UNTIL I move the scrubber along a second, then playback is normal and the mouse pointer and system retruns to normal speed... How do I fix this?
