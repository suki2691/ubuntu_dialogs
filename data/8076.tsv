2012-06-19T20:47:00.000Z	ndlovu	morsnowski	thanks... don't really have any other options anyway!
2012-06-19T20:48:00.000Z	morsnowski	ndlovu	as long as you are not using stuff from outside the repositories that should work
2012-06-19T20:52:00.000Z	ndlovu	morsnowski	I'm getting too many 'dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of ...' problems for it to deal with. Any suggestions of what to try next?
