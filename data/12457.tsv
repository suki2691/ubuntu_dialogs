2012-02-17T23:15:00.000Z	zykotick9	quentusrex	what info are you looking for exactly?  They are all the same, just with different Desktop Environments
2012-02-17T23:17:00.000Z	quentusrex	zykotick9	I'm looking to find info on which desktop enviroments are supported on 12.04
2012-02-17T23:18:00.000Z	zykotick9	quentusrex	that would be an #ubuntu+1 question (but i don't think there is any change from current, it's whatever is available in the repo)
