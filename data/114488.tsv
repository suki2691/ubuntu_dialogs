2007-11-02T14:00:00.000Z	ambro415	defrysk	which instructions? when I click the button to download themes a dialog opens and closes immediatedly and nothing gets downloaded
2007-11-02T14:06:00.000Z	defrysk	ambro415	when you open the emerald themer and open the repositories tab you can see at the bottom a txt about aunning a command in the shell
