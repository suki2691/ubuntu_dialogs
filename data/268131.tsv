2004-09-27T10:42:00.000Z	mxpxpod		I'm so glad I'm on ppc and don't have to worry about initrd stuff :D
2004-09-27T10:44:00.000Z	mxpxpod		ok, when I choose a username in the second stage install, I'll choose "bryan" which is already on my /home partition and all files under that user's directory have ownership by bryan:users... is that alright?
