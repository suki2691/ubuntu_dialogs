2007-05-16T14:19:00.000Z	defaultro		hi folks, I have a poweredge 1950 with 2 quad cores and 8gigs. Openbsd and Freebsd are failing to see the gig. Will ubuntu support it?

2007-05-16T14:20:00.000Z	defaultro	Nubbie	and?
2007-05-16T14:20:00.000Z	Nubbie	defaultro	i had a similar problem, freebsd could not detect the sectors of my hard drive, so it failed. but i have never had a problem with ubuntu or linux in generael.
