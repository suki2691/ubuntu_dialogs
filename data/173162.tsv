2006-07-28T16:50:00.000Z	Zyfo		I'm running both Windows and Ubuntu. Since I've got a hard drive on 250gb, and I'd prefer not to use partitions, I'm pretty much forced to use NTFS. This doesn't work too well with Ubuntu, I can't write files and one hard drive isn't even working. I've heard there are some kind of solution for this , anyone who could help me?
2006-07-28T16:52:00.000Z	Zyfo		I might use FAT32 if this doesn't work too ewll, I'd prefer to use NTFS with windows anyway.
2006-07-28T16:52:00.000Z	ucordes	Zyfo	there are tools to use ntfs under linux and other way around to use ext3 under windows. but if you ask me better rezise your ntfs and make a fat32 out of the fress space
2006-07-28T16:52:00.000Z	Zyfo	ucordes	I might, I'll just try this out first.
