I have kubuntu running behind a firewall, and I can't hit apache from outside.. but if i switch the the ip to point to my windows box i can hit the webserver on it.. is the something i have to config on kubuntu to get it to accept the traffic??
2005-10-18T08:59:00.000Z	Abysmal		how do i change that??
