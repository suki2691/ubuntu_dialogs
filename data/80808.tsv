2008-09-04T04:53:00.000Z	MortenB		I'm so disappointed. I wanted to install Ubuntu on my girlfriend's laptop to get out of MS hell, but first I had to give up on Hardy because of the freeze issues, then I tried Gutsy, but had to abandon that because of the wireless/RT61 issues. Now my hopes are set for tomorrow's alpha5, otherwise I'll have to switch back to XP just to get a workable OS on her computer :(
2008-09-04T04:54:00.000Z	jrib	MortenB	you should be going with hardy and troubleshooting the "freeze issues" imo.  Also, there are other distros you can try before resorting to XP
2008-09-04T04:55:00.000Z	MortenB	jrib	and oinck, I believe I am suffering from bug 218140 .. and the conclusive comment on that thread is to wait for the next release
