2008-10-13T18:54:00.000Z	jrib	os2mac	system -> quit -> logout, then log back in
2008-10-13T18:55:00.000Z	jrib	os2mac	gnome-session-save --kill
2008-10-13T19:07:00.000Z	os2mac	jrib	the reason I had to do that was that for some reason the calendar app on the desktop keeps hanging my desktop. I can utilize programs already open but can't access the desktop applications. also /etc/ini.d/gdm restart hung.
