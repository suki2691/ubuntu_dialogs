2006-08-27T15:08:00.000Z	nubio		i wrote a helper script to help automate lucent winmodem setup under Breezy and Dapper.  what's best place to share it with the community ?
2006-08-27T15:09:00.000Z	Seveas	nubio	file a bug reprt and attach it, that way it may get properly integrated
2006-08-27T15:11:00.000Z	nubio	Seveas	i doubt it can be considered a bug per se, since it's *proprietary stuff*  -  is there a repository of some sort one could simply upload to ? - it's just a perl script that downloads driver src, builds and insmod's the modules, etc.
2006-08-27T15:17:00.000Z	nubio	Seveas	thanks for the bug report w/ attachment suggestion re: ltmodem helper script :)    in the meantime, what's a good place to post a fix script src - i suspect it could be of use to laptop users in developing world and those on the go
