2009-10-10T23:26:00.000Z	karname		I run apache server in debian , after 3 mins of startup apache eat all of cpu , I checked my scripts and they haven't any bug , can anyone had this problem ?
2009-10-10T23:27:00.000Z	MK13	karname	maybe that question would be better asked in #debian or #apache ?
2009-10-10T23:27:00.000Z	karname	MK13	: I asked them , but they don't asnwer me
2009-10-10T23:29:00.000Z	MK13	karname	then try #ubuntu-server they will know more about server applications, even though maybe not strictly debian issues
