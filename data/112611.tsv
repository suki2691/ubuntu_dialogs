2007-11-28T10:12:00.000Z	Shadow147	fiXXXerMet	is it turned on
2007-11-28T10:13:00.000Z	fiXXXerMet	dfwlinuxguy	I did dmesg | grep sd and it doesn't detect the device, nor does dmesg | tail.  Shadow147:  Normally, I just plug in the USB cable while it is off, and the device automatically goes into Transfer mode.
