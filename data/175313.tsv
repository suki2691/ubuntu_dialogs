2009-02-09T20:40:00.000Z	jla		Hi. I'm checking out ubuntu and having trouble using Add/Remove or Synaptic to find programs to install. For example crossfire. I type that into the search for add/remove and it finds nothing.
2009-02-09T20:42:00.000Z	alex-weej	jla	what is crossfire?
2009-02-09T20:44:00.000Z	alex-weej	jla	crossfire-client-gtk2
2009-02-09T20:44:00.000Z	alex-weej	jla	the metadata for the packages needs to be correct.
