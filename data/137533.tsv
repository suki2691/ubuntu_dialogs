2008-11-20T19:03:00.000Z	phrostbite		Yeah no kidding. Last night I was trying to do a mass edit of like 60 pictures. I wanna reduce the file size because they are like 1.4mb but i got imagemagick like people said and when i did the command they told me to use it kept saying the filename does not exist. Do I have to do it 1 by 1?
