2006-06-11T07:06:00.000Z	Farchord		Hello guys, I have a question. I am thinkin of starting to learn linux (Yes, I am crossing the final frontier, Star trek style), but my video card seems to have support issues under Linux. Anyone know if the support got better for my ATi Radeon 9600 pro All in wonder in the last year?
