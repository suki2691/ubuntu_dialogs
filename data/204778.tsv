2006-01-05T14:05:00.000Z	titanium_platypu		I am considering switching from Fedora to Ubuntu, and would like a brief description of the differences I'll encounter.  I am primarily interested in two things: games :-D, and package/application management.
2006-01-05T14:05:00.000Z	titanium_platypu		can someone give me that info?
2006-01-05T14:06:00.000Z	bshumate	titanium_platypu	i don't play many games, but package management will certainly be better for you in Ubuntu, but that's just my $0.02 USD ;-)
