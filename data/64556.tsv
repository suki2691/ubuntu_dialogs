2011-05-06T04:24:00.000Z	Maarten	ZykoticK9	yeah you got a point..... I just think Linux isn't going to grow much if all distro's keep in their own little corners..... We need to get game companies on board. 99% of games are pure data, only  1% is actual windows coding to run all that data..... but the differences between all the distros make it impossible for game companies to come up with releases for "generic linux". That's a shame. :(
2011-05-06T04:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Maarten	ever seen binary linux installs?  they're out there, they aren't really "packaged" at all.
2011-05-06T04:27:00.000Z	Maarten	ZykoticK9	Oh yeah, VMWare is a good example, it is a binary install that works on most, if not all distros. Either way, they only real reason I keep Windows installed on my systems.... is gaming. I have limited succes with Wine with some games, and they just run better in Windows 7. I just Wish the gaming industry would make Native Linux games more. :(
