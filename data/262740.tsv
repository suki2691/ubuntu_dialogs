2007-06-18T15:56:00.000Z	doctordoog		I installed ubuntu server edition, and whenever I try to install with apt-get it requests for the install CD to be in, but it still downloads from the internet
2007-06-18T15:56:00.000Z	doctordoog		would this be some line in the file where it's saying to look in the CD before the internet?
