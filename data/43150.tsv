2010-10-03T21:28:00.000Z	jaik	juk	what do you mean with "make install"?
2010-10-03T21:29:00.000Z	juk	jaik	cd source-tree/; ./configure; make; sudo make install
2010-10-03T21:33:00.000Z	jaik	juk	" cd source-tree/; ./configure; make; sudo make install" - could you tell me why those commands would change anything? :)
