2010-01-06T01:19:00.000Z	Reuben		Can someone help me get my ipod touch working with ubuntu? I've tried numerous guides, but different problems arise that the guide doesn't cover. Somebody please help me, before I switch to Windows?

2010-01-06T01:22:00.000Z	Reuben	jrib	Those are the details. I have an ipod touch, I can't get it to work with Ubuntu. I have tried every guide I can find on google, nothing has worked. I would appreciate it if someone with experience in this would assist me.
