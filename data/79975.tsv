2012-04-08T10:53:00.000Z	Guest_		I'm switching to Ubuntu (from win7) and was wondering if it is possible to make a backup of my windows drive INTO a vmware-like program for Ubuntu so I could still have access to it during the transition period?
2012-04-08T10:54:00.000Z	Guest_		Would that enable me to completely phase out win7 over time?

2012-04-08T10:57:00.000Z	bekks	Guest_	It did 4 years ago, too.
