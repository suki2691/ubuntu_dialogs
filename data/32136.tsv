2011-10-20T04:31:00.000Z	derek		I was updating to ubuntu 11.10 from 10.04 using the update manager, had a power failure in the middle of installation, and now that i got the desktop to load, and some programs to work, i have to use gnome classic to load it, and most programs won't run now, says there is no executable program to open them, any thoughts on what might be happening?
