2009-08-04T05:12:00.000Z	dhalsimm		hello everybody, I want to make a link of a file to /usr/bin, I tried this "sudo ln -s ~/redcar/bin/redcar /usr/bin/redcar" ... this is working but when I try to run it, it still looks for files in /usr/bin instead of redcar's own directory. So it gives a error like not found file. I would like this to work. thanks
