2007-02-02T10:20:00.000Z	ubuntu_help		New support question: I'm using Ubuntu 6.10 Server and the md5sum for smbfs_3.0.22-1ubuntu4_i386.deb is different than what is listed in md5sum.txt
2007-02-02T10:20:00.000Z	ubuntu_help		So the disk check fails every time
2007-02-02T10:21:00.000Z	ubuntu_help		nameless: I did redownload, reburn. and i did an md5 against the file in the iso before burning, comes out the same. and i did an md5sum against the same file hosted at http://ubuntu.interlegis.gov.br/archive/pool/main/s/samba/ and the md5 is the same. the only mismatch is the md5sum.txt file on the cd
2007-02-02T10:22:00.000Z	cypher1	ubuntu_help	i believe that there is media-check option when you boot thru the cd
