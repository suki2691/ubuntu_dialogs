2010-10-21T23:14:00.000Z	manlymatt83		Hi folks.  Quick question.  I'm thinking of upgrading my T42 (1024x768 display) to a T510 (HD+).  I haven't used any wide screen laptop before, and I'm obviously super used to the larger text size.  Someone has told me not to upgrade, as I'll think text is just too small, and someone else has told me to upgrade to the T510, but adjust settings in my OS to "increase text size across the board".  Is that possible in Ubuntu?  Can I run in HD+ resolution bu
