2011-03-15T00:51:00.000Z	guntbert	Jinxed--	might be a question of search paths or environment settings
2011-03-15T00:52:00.000Z	Jinxed--	guntbert	I thought so too especially since it would segfault when I ran it with env -
2011-03-15T00:52:00.000Z	Jinxed--	guntbert	rvn but I manually set the $PATH and $TERM in my script now and it still segfaults
