2011-05-21T02:38:00.000Z	cablop		the usage of firefox profiles in ubuntu is broken
2011-05-21T02:39:00.000Z	cablop		i need to make one firefox profile act as the default browser, but if i close that profile and have other firefox profile open, then i cannot open the default one, regardless i'm using the --no-remote flag :( it is a problem of ubuntu, because in windows the firefox profiles work as expected
2011-05-21T02:39:00.000Z	cablop		is there a firefox channel?
