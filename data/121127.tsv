2007-09-23T07:16:00.000Z	joachimm		hello, I just burnt a few files to a cd from my mac, now I put them in my Ubuntu box and all the filenames have been lower-cased? have I missed some mount option somewhere?
2007-09-23T07:18:00.000Z	dystopianray	joachimm	can your mac burn with the 'rock ridge' filesystem?
2007-09-23T07:19:00.000Z	dystopianray	joachimm	you've probably burned a disc with a mac filesystem that ubuntu can't understand
2007-09-23T07:20:00.000Z	joachimm	dystopianray	the files all come over ok, it is just the casing of the filenames that is of. I'll look into the 'rock ridge'
