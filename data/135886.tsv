2007-06-02T11:19:00.000Z	rubydo		Hi, using Feisty 7.04, my system frequently locks up, becoming responsive roughly for one second every minute. If I use those seconds of responsiveness to check 'top', nothing particularly strange comes up - firefox-bin is top with 25%, but even kill -9 on that doesn't make the system resposive again. Anyone any hints?

2007-06-02T11:20:00.000Z	rubydo	redcard	500MB, Latitude D600. Ubuntu is speedy as hell normally, but sometimes it just locks up
2007-06-02T11:20:00.000Z	redcard	rubydo	Hmm.
