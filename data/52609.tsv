2009-07-13T20:30:00.000Z	dlord	sonism	Instead of booting into the gui I would like to go to the command line.
2009-07-13T20:34:00.000Z	dlord	sonism	My problem is I can't get that far.  The video driver is not loading, and for some reason the Live CD is trying to use my Hard Drive which I need to re-partition because it got hosed.
