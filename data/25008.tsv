2010-10-02T03:23:00.000Z	dogmatrix_		can someone give me a place to start to try to fix segfault errors?  It's tough to google it when the browser crashes if I click the wrong spot
2010-10-02T03:23:00.000Z	ikonia	dogmatrix_	what's crashing
2010-10-02T03:24:00.000Z	dogmatrix_	ikonia	almost everything that I've tried so far.
