2010-07-24T09:41:00.000Z	Theo		Hey guys. I have a Dell netbook (no CD drive) and Im using the Ubuntu netbook version. Im very new to Linux OS' and I dont have much time atm to learn all the good functions. I was using windows before and I would like to switch back. I Just dont know how I can install windows back on my netbook. I have a windows.iso on my hard drive tho. Im just going to install windows to do my studies (I'll put Ubuntu back on when Im done hehe). Hop
