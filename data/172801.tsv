2008-11-06T20:32:00.000Z	Vlet	n8tuser	No, it just seemed like the right thing to use on a xeon
2008-11-06T20:34:00.000Z	Vlet	n8tuser	Honestly, I think I would have been better off using 32 bit, but it would mean quite a bit of work to reconfigure this server
2008-11-06T20:36:00.000Z	Vlet	n8tuser	well, I think it's less limited than one might suspect. So far, the only problems I have had are with gd, and a program called genpuid which does audio fingerprinting
