2011-04-30T04:49:00.000Z	Nesto		Hey guys, I was wonder if I could get some help real quick.... I have a Win7 desktop, and a ubuntu desktop (11.04) that I want to use as a printer server, but right now I'm trying to remote into the ubuntu desktop but I can't. I can remote into my windows from the ubuntu desktop but not the other way around. I have tried quite a few tuts i found online but to no avail...
