2011-04-20T15:52:00.000Z	mang0		hey guys! I'm installing ubuntu as soon as my HD arrives, but I just wanna check something.
2011-04-20T15:52:00.000Z	mang0		This is probably a very stupid question, but I have a live CD of 10.10...can I install from the CD then update from ubuntu?
2011-04-20T15:52:00.000Z	mang0		or do I have to do a fresh install...
