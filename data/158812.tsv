2007-01-04T17:11:00.000Z	Valmarko		I'm using the open source driver for my ati graphics card. The latest release of  ATI Proprietary Linux x86 Display Driver is 8.32.5 . Should I install it?

2007-01-04T17:12:00.000Z	Slart	Valmarko	if it's new and you need 3d performance.. games and such.. sure go ahead
2007-01-04T17:13:00.000Z	Slart	Valmarko	that qualifies as new
