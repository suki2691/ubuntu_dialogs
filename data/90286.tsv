2008-05-19T00:42:00.000Z	yamanickill		i've not actually upgraded to 8.04, i've heard there are some issues with it, and its not as stable as it could be. what do people think?
2008-05-19T00:43:00.000Z	ghabit	yamanickill	It depends of your opinion about stability.
2008-05-19T00:43:00.000Z	yamanickill	ghabit	its an LTS edition...so it should be very stable, and not very buggy at all
2008-05-19T00:43:00.000Z	ghabit	yamanickill	8.04 have critical unstable default video player and clipboard tool (not installed by default). That's all what I know.
