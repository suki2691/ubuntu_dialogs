2007-12-01T12:35:00.000Z	Flannel	z9999	You'll need to make /home/ its own partition (not difficult), and then just share that.  You could run into configuration version issues though (versions for stuff in dapper vs gutsy have different config options/fomratms whatever)
2007-12-01T12:36:00.000Z	Flannel	z9999	Or you can have a separate install entirely, and you just mount the old home to access stuff, yeah.  like astro76 said.
