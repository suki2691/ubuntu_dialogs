2009-12-22T10:51:00.000Z	microhaxo		I have a few questions, I just bought a Netbook for my C/Unix programming class because i need my normal laptop for my Algo class. Anyway i would like to know.  Should i install Ubuntu 9.10 or Kubuntu 9.10. The netbook has a Atom N280 and 2gb of Ram. Which one would perform better?
