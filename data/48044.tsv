2009-09-20T19:23:00.000Z	Freak_NL		Hello #ubuntu. I want to automatically execute a script whenever a specific external USB HDD is mounted. Should I be looking into udev for this?
2009-09-20T19:24:00.000Z	Walex	Freak_NL	depends... Check HAL.
2009-09-20T19:25:00.000Z	Freak_NL	Walex	thanks, I'll check HAL out
