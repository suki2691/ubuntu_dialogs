2011-12-15T00:06:00.000Z	hjanns		Why is 10.10 the latest version on http://www.ubunut.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download? What happened to 11.04 and 11.10?
2011-12-15T00:07:00.000Z	Pici	hjanns	likely there is something wrong with that url forwarding.  I'll talk to a Canonical person about it.  but use http://ubuntu.com in the meantime.
2011-12-15T00:09:00.000Z	Pici	hjanns	It should forward to ubuntu.com, but it doesnt. I'm filing a bug about it right now.
