2011-07-07T20:48:00.000Z	awkisopen		Okay, new problem - up until now my Ubuntu Server install was using a shared internet connection over ethernet to connect to the Internet. Now, suddenly, I get all these "network is unreachable" errors. How can I reconfigure the Internet?

2011-07-07T20:50:00.000Z	awkisopen	tucemiux	A, um, ethernet cable?
2011-07-07T20:51:00.000Z	tucemiux	awkisopen	OK but the ethernet cable doesnt give you connection to the internet, you have to connect that cable somewhere
