2008-01-03T07:53:00.000Z	th0r	ramza3	download the 3 beta....it is much better than 2
2008-01-03T07:53:00.000Z	ramza3	th0r	yea, but the adobe flash plugin is still broken.  It is better though.  I will need to check out FF Beta 2
2008-01-03T07:54:00.000Z	th0r	ramza3	well...I am running suse on the laptop and flash works there. Using ubuntu for the server....no need for flash
