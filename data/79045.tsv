2008-09-20T07:27:00.000Z	ganymede	punk3r	i'm not in control of the router. and also, currently, i'm clearing the ath0.leases file in /var/lib but it seems like an ugly solution
2008-09-20T07:28:00.000Z	punk3r	ganymede	reset the admin settings on the router :P
2008-09-20T07:29:00.000Z	ganymede	punk3r	and actually, even clearing the leases file doesn't make it forget its old adresses. and also, it's not a router; it's a switch with a dhcp server. and also, i have no idea where it is physically nor do i have administrative priveleges on it
