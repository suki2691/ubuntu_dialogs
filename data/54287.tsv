2009-07-16T19:07:00.000Z	xamox	mazda01	yeah, it says version 3.0, but how do I know what build number it is?
2009-07-16T19:08:00.000Z	mazda01	xamox	i am sorry. you got all the info I can provide. i know there is a way to show you more info for a package but I don't remember what it is off the top of my head.
2009-07-16T19:09:00.000Z	xamox	mazda01	that's alright, thanks anyway though
