2006-02-26T11:57:00.000Z	KRA		Hi, ubuntu noob here, I'm trying Ubuntu for the first time (the Dapper Drake) And somehow I made a mistake and ended up with edubuntu rather than ubuntu, are there any mayor differences, I'm thinking like what packages are awailable, what I am allowed to do etc... or is it the same system with some extra packages and other icons/wallpaper etc..
