2011-12-16T10:23:00.000Z	tttuuu		I'm trying to "wget http://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.3.1/tarball/", but it's always saving the result as index.html instead of file.tar.gz
2011-12-16T10:23:00.000Z	tttuuu		how can I make wget save as tar.gz?
2011-12-16T10:24:00.000Z	ThinkPadG40	tttuuu	maybe because you're specifying a web page like an FTP index as opposed to the actual filename
2011-12-16T10:25:00.000Z	ThinkPadG40	tttuuu	then just save it with the browser?
