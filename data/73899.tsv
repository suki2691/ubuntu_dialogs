2010-11-02T00:25:00.000Z	addisonj		hi there, how do i stop the network manager from automatically rewriting my resolv.conf? I want to specify my own static DNS
2010-11-02T00:25:00.000Z	blakkheim	addisonj	purge network manager and install wicd
2010-11-02T00:26:00.000Z	blakkheim	addisonj	it has a gtk frontend and an ncurses frontend
2010-11-02T00:28:00.000Z	blakkheim	addisonj	maybe so, but you'll thank us in the long run - networkmanager is not as good as wicd
