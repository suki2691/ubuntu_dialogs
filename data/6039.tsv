2012-02-02T04:15:00.000Z	xSmurf		hey all, I'd like to build a ramfs os install (on HD but without persistence) could anyone point me in the right direction?
2012-02-02T04:16:00.000Z	xSmurf		(basically a live cd type of install but I want to pre install some things)

2012-02-02T04:17:00.000Z	xSmurf	DinoMuffin	yes and installing it as a partition
