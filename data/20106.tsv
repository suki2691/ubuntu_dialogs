2012-03-12T18:45:00.000Z	user82		hope its not to OT: short question about kernel compiling. can i compile a intel atom kernel on a intel core2duo or will gcc automatically optimize it for the cpu its running on currently?
2012-03-12T18:46:00.000Z	pfifo	user82	you can compile a kernel for any architecture using any architecture so long as gcc supports both architectures
2012-03-12T18:46:00.000Z	user82	pfifo	how can i tell gcc to optimize it for intel atom(or will it automatically be done when i choose "intel atom" as cpu type in the kernel config)
2012-03-12T18:46:00.000Z	pfifo	user82	thats too OT
