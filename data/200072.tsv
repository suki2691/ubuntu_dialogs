2007-05-19T11:24:00.000Z	jughead		How do I control which process start at boot time?  I noticed when I rebooted the other day that services are running that I do not need/want.  I use KDM, but when I shutdown KDM and GDM both have to stop.  I also installed tremulous (a first person shooter) and when I shutdown it says something like "stopping tremulous dedicated server."  I don't run a tremulous server so I don't need that running in the background

2007-05-19T11:26:00.000Z	jughead	Madpilot	I probably did
