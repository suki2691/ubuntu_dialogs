2009-06-20T06:15:00.000Z	dannyD1	kendrick	maybe ls /dev/disk/by-id/ ...but thats just a guess
2009-06-20T06:17:00.000Z	kendrick	dannyD1	thanks but it wasn't there do usb devices have UUIDs its registering as a camera and i'm just trying to figure out what to put in my fstab to set it to not auto mount
2009-06-20T06:18:00.000Z	dannyD1	kendrick	oh..I just do the lowtech way and click unmount when the popup screen shows
