2005-05-04T08:51:00.000Z	smouche		it's not the window manager, no -- in gnome that's metacity -- with ubuntu anyway, I think
2005-05-04T08:51:00.000Z	sapelko	smouche	xine-ui didn't work
2005-05-04T08:54:00.000Z	smouche	sapelko	-- could you have any multimedia apps perhaps tying things up?  Have you checked top for processes you might try killing?
