2007-07-08T09:04:00.000Z	adamonline45		I'm planning to compile a new kernel for Ubuntu Server 6.06.  Any suggestions on the latest, stable kernel version?  I see linux-2.6.21.6 is the latest, latest, according to www.kernel.org...  Will that work without problems or should I stick to what I'm using now, 2.6.15-26-server?
