2007-02-17T16:59:00.000Z	kaje1		I'm using Firestarter, but it seems to only be able to configure one network device as my internet connected device... However I have two network devices that may be connected at any given time..
2007-02-17T16:59:00.000Z	kaje1		is there a way I can get it to handle both devices?

2007-02-18T17:03:00.000Z	bulmer	kaje1	you can set which name gets associated by using udev..look into this
