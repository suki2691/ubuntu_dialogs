2008-01-29T23:07:00.000Z	zoobox		how do I do so for example gedit defaults to save in Latin1 instead of utf-8 ?
2008-01-29T23:07:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	zoobox	utf-8 is better.
2008-01-29T23:09:00.000Z	zoobox	fyrestrtr	that depends of what you need, and what you write
2008-01-29T23:13:00.000Z	zoobox	fyrestrtr	imho utf-8 is a bad cross between 7bit ascii and unicode. 7bit ascii is perhaps enough for english, and unicode is needed for chinese (even though chinese prefer ucs2/utf-16 because utf8 takes more place)....
