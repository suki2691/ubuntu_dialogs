2009-06-05T04:19:00.000Z	Spi_Waterwing		hey, anyone know of an Ubuntu-based distro designed for fast boots?
2009-06-05T04:19:00.000Z	cabrey	Spi_Waterwing	uhm 9.04?
2009-06-05T04:19:00.000Z	Spi_Waterwing	cabrey	what's the standard load time?  I'm looking for something that will get me to FF in under 15 seconds
2009-06-05T04:20:00.000Z	cabrey	Spi_Waterwing	oh in that case I don't think any OS will do it besides very specialized distros
