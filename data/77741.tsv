2008-10-28T10:52:00.000Z	MTecknology	Robb_M	I'm trying to use the PackageInfo plugin that ubottu uses. I keep getting an error thrown at me and I'm sure it's because of the supybot.plugins.PackageInfo.aptdir setting, but I don't know what to set it too or if there's something else I need to do
2008-10-28T10:53:00.000Z	Robb_M	MTecknology	your question might be better suited in #supybot i think? or #ubuntu-ops? heck im not sure, but i really do not think this is the right place....
2008-10-28T10:54:00.000Z	MTecknology	Robb_M	that's why I didn't just ask... It can't be answered in #supybot because they don't deal with it and it's innapropriate for -ops
