2006-02-24T06:52:00.000Z	BDC		Mabus06/LinuxJones: Unfortunately Windows has no built in method to resize a partition while keeping the data, hence the need for something like Partition Magic or Partition Logic
2006-02-24T06:53:00.000Z	LinuxJones	BDC	that's good to know, for the folks who come in here and have only ever run windows thanks for the info :)
