2011-04-30T03:42:00.000Z	dark-matter		I updated to 11.04 and my nvidia driver on my dell d630 won't work.  I can get command line, but no GUI
2011-04-30T03:42:00.000Z	dark-matter		anyone have ideas?
2011-04-30T03:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dark-matter	uninstall the nvidia driver, boot then reinstall the driver then reboot
2011-04-30T03:43:00.000Z	dark-matter	ActionParsnip	ok
