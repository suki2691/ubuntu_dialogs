2010-03-16T15:08:00.000Z	Arkns		hi. I installed a pack call python-matplotlib on my Ubuntu 8.04.3 LTS. his version is 0.91. I would like to update just this package (not entire system) to his newer version that is 0.99. how I do that?
2010-03-16T15:08:00.000Z	Arkns		I use apt-get
2010-03-16T15:09:00.000Z	rsk	Arkns	either find a ppa with a newer package, or install outside of apt-get
2010-03-16T15:09:00.000Z	rsk	Arkns	personal package archive
