2007-03-16T11:04:00.000Z	arrenlex	snowpunk98	What wyndblade said is: gksudo /etc/fstab, change /media/sda1 to /windows, then sudo mkdir /windows, then umount /media/sda1, then mount -a

2007-03-16T11:17:00.000Z	arrenlex	snowpunk98	IE no longer runs under a default wine because of the implementation of the gecko engine right into wine. Check out the ies4linux site I gave you.
