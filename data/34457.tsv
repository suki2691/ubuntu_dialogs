2010-04-07T10:40:00.000Z	JamesSavko		Hey guys. I have a ubuntu 9.1 server and I was wondering if I can get xserv running for purposes of a vnc connection if i have no grahpics card

2010-04-07T10:43:00.000Z	JamesSavko	chelz	I have full ssh root access, but was hoping to find a way to connect to a gui. I will check out freenx and ssh x forwarding. Any other suggestions?
