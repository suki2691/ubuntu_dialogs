2012-02-24T16:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	mgj	 just googing and saw a mention that --> rTorrent 0.8.7 works fine with magnet links in terms of downloading.
2012-02-24T16:49:00.000Z	mgj	Dr_willis	oh... Google told me you needed to add a patch and recompile from source to enable it. Will look into it, thanks
2012-02-24T16:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	mgj	 all the patches i saw mentioned were 2+ yrs old.
2012-02-24T16:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	mgj	 also seen some mention of some sort of 'script' to convert magnet links to normal torrents.
