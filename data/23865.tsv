2011-06-13T22:21:00.000Z	chair_		im having issue mounting a dvd on a laptop, Im 100% sure ive set the correct line in /etc/fstab but it still keeps repeating "mount: no medium found on /dev/sr0" Ive browsed UbuntuForums and have not gotten very far with my issue (ver 10.10)
2011-06-13T22:22:00.000Z	Onryo	chair_	sounds like the dev/sr0 for VBox
2011-06-13T22:56:00.000Z	Onryo	chair_	do you have VBox installed?
2011-06-13T22:57:00.000Z	Onryo	chair_	no
