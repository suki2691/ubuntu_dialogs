2012-02-20T15:18:00.000Z	crizzy		again: PPA's are exactly for that - updating certain packages outside the distro updates
2012-02-20T15:20:00.000Z	Pikkachu	crizzy	ok everybody has listened to you, so will you create a reilable ppa for all packages forever? btw I don't trust your ppas
2012-02-20T15:21:00.000Z	Pikkachu	crizzy	I mean, that's not that simple. Each app you want a new version needs to have a ppa availabe somewhere, that's not automatic, and the ppa must be reliable. For example #pidgin does not support ppas other than theirs
