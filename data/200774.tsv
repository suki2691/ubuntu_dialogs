2006-02-19T16:56:00.000Z	delaney	Psi-Jack	 its ok. at least i tried.  i figure if i help people when i can maybe ill earn some help from others when i need it ;)
2006-02-19T16:57:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	delaney	Well. He really gave nothing to actually give him help for. His problem could've been a number of things. Had he actually supplied some background, I could have easily helped out. But with "any REAL ubuntu people here?" just doesn't float. :)
2006-02-19T16:58:00.000Z	delaney	Psi-Jack	 agreed it was arrogant on his part.  i got the impression perhaps he was having connection issues with active/passive perhaps.. who knows really.  im only pulling answers outta the air.
