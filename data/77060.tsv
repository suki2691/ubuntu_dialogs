2008-10-17T16:03:00.000Z	^synax	dns53	 Thanks, I've got them all installed, where would I select the output device with PulseAudio?
2008-10-17T16:06:00.000Z	dns53	^synax	run pulse audio device chooser, select configure local sound server, simultanious output > enable then go to pulse volume control, under output, right click and select simultanious
