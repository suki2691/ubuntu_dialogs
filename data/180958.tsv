2007-05-19T06:28:00.000Z	lilminime	Pelo	Ok. The problem is that to get 3D Acceleration from my built-in graphic card (intel 915) I've (after aloooot of troubleshooting) found out that it is a bug in the driver for my card, that forces me to have DefaultDepth in Xorg like 16 not at 24. That is a problem for me, because I am addicted to World of Worldcraft and I will nomather what turn into windows, and now I want to play it on my new laptop. So I have to play with bad colors
