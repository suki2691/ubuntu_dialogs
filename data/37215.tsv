2010-02-15T11:30:00.000Z	deity1		can a 5 years old linux distro able to read/write ext3/4 partitions?
2010-02-15T11:30:00.000Z	mneptok	deity1	sure, as long as it has a newer kernel
2010-02-15T11:30:00.000Z	deity1	mneptok	is that mean yes or no
2010-02-15T11:31:00.000Z	mneptok	deity1	it means "yes, if you have a new kernel that supports ext4"
