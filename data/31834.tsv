2011-07-06T08:26:00.000Z	hoverbear		Hey all, I've got a fresh ubuntu-server installation on this laptop (Don't ask) and I need some help getting my intel wireless card working. It has an in-kernel driver intel ultimate-n 3000.
2011-07-06T08:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hoverbear	wicd has some sort of cli or ncurse option
2011-07-06T08:29:00.000Z	hoverbear	ZykoticK9	Sadly, wicd is not installed by default and I have no repo access
2011-07-06T08:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	hoverbear	manual it is then ;)  hope you don't use wpa, or already have wpa supplicant installed.  Good luck.
