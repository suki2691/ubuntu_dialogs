2012-05-19T04:38:00.000Z	gumby_52		hello.  I'm wondering if someone could help me with setting up running Ubuntu on my TV.  It works fine on my small monitor but when I put it on my tv the display seems wrong.  I looked at the xorg.0.log and see that it does not like the frequency.

2012-05-19T04:39:00.000Z	L3top	gumby_52	do you have any adapters or anything in between the card and the tv? How is it connected?
2012-05-19T04:40:00.000Z	L3top	gumby_52	have you installed the proprietary drivers? and if so what options do you have in nvidia-settings?
