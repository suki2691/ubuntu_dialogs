2010-05-03T04:20:00.000Z	Theravadan		so after a day i converted from the buggy ext4 to ext3... but it wont boot up because the UUID of the parttion is wrong so i overrode the grub boot with root=/dev/sda7 and it works, but how can I have grub update the UUID so i dont have to modify the root at boot?
