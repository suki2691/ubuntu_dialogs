2009-02-19T06:45:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	merther	Just fix the lines that don't work and it should work fine :)
2009-02-19T06:46:00.000Z	merther	Meshezabeel	 Problem is that nothing had been changed.  It had been working and all the items are no longer in the network.  The windows workgroup isn't detected anymore either.
