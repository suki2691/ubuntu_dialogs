2006-09-28T13:56:00.000Z	cpk2		cant compiling the kernel your self possibly cause problems with packages?
2006-09-28T13:57:00.000Z	lupine_85	cpk2	not really
2006-09-28T13:57:00.000Z	lupine_85		linux-restricted-modules is about the only one that would be affected
2006-09-28T13:57:00.000Z	cpk2	lupine_85	but the chance is there right? =P
