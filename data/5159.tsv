2012-02-24T21:20:00.000Z	sun_devil		I hooked up printer via usb,  should I go with jetdirect with IP port 9100 or 2nd option of Kodak with device as printer?
2012-02-24T21:21:00.000Z	Tarks	sun_devil	probably the kodac option - jet direct works over the network I believe
2012-02-24T21:38:00.000Z	Tarks	sun_devil	-all the available drivers should already be installed. If your printer isnt there, you can check the manufacturers website to see if they provide a linux driver, but its doubtful that they do
2012-02-24T21:40:00.000Z	sun_devil	Tarks	not installed and can't find any during a search for drivers.  Kodak does not have links for Linux
