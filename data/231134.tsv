2006-08-20T11:33:00.000Z	pitaman		Hi. I don't know if this is a common issue, but I've never used Linux before and I downloaded and properly burned the latest i386 ubuntu desktop cd to try it out, but when I try to run the cd, it won't get passed the loading root prompt.
2006-08-20T11:33:00.000Z	pitaman		I finally thought I found a distro that would be easy to use and I can't even boot the darn thing.
2006-08-20T11:33:00.000Z	pitaman		Any suggestions, please?
