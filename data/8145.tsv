2011-11-01T10:13:00.000Z	Planetic		my /var/lib/dpkg/status file is massively corrupted. There is no way to fix it by hand! How to fix it?
2011-11-01T10:14:00.000Z	iceroot	Planetic	there should be /var/lib/dpkg/status-old
2011-11-01T10:14:00.000Z	iceroot	Planetic	replace it
2011-11-01T10:17:00.000Z	Planetic	iceroot	Thanks
