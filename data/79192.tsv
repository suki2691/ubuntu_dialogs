2011-03-14T13:15:00.000Z	et_	void_pointer	no specific reason. I just had ubuntu at hand and decided to get something working.!
2011-03-14T13:19:00.000Z	void_pointer	et_	fair enough. Although it often works out better to start with a minimal distro and build up, instead of a "full" distro and tear down. If you know what I mean.
2011-03-14T13:20:00.000Z	et_	void_pointer	I understand !
