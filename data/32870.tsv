2010-05-02T18:25:00.000Z	noir_lord	enriq	if you want, make sure you back up any important data first (which you should routinely do anyway)
2010-05-02T18:26:00.000Z	enriq	noir_lord	Tecna, littlepenguin thanks, ok I do my daily backup and upgrade, thanks (no encrypted partitions)... but I do have a separate /home and /opt with some special mounting, would that be a prob?
2010-05-02T18:28:00.000Z	noir_lord	enriq	it shouldn't be the upgrade is reasonably careful not to stomp settings, I've never tried so ymmv (I generally rsync to my server and then do a nuke/install)
