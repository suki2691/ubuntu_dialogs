2012-04-30T16:59:00.000Z	MaskilPDX		I am hoping someone could help
2012-04-30T17:00:00.000Z	MaskilPDX		Where is the log of all commands typed in terminal?
2012-04-30T17:00:00.000Z	Darael	MaskilPDX	run "history", or look at ~/.bash_history.
2012-04-30T17:02:00.000Z	Darael	MaskilPDX	For reference, running "history" is more portable across shells - for example, I use zsh, so my log is in ~/.zhistory instead.
