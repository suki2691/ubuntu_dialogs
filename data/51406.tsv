2009-08-28T20:47:00.000Z	th0r	sidp	I am using 9.04 with an ati card, but it worked out of the box and I don't use compiz, so not sure how good the driver is
2009-08-28T20:49:00.000Z	sidp	th0r	i have an ati200m, its ancient and i have no idea if there are going to be open source drivers because of the rumours i have been hearing about ati dropping the support for cards older than the hd2000
2009-08-28T20:49:00.000Z	th0r	sidp	I have no idea....mine worked out of the box and I never looked any closer
