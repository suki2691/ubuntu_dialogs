2008-06-11T12:32:00.000Z	fenrisx		Can anyone here help me with getting the drivers for my nVidia 6800GT working correctly?  I'm looking in the Synaptic Package Manager, and it's showing drivers installed, but I can't get any resolution over 1024x768.

2008-06-11T12:34:00.000Z	fenrisx	gejr	Yes, I normally run 1280x1024 on this monitor.  The drivers in the package manager show as nVidia drivers.
2008-06-11T12:35:00.000Z	fenrisx	gejr	So I'm not sure what really wrong.  There were several nVidia drivers listed, and all had similar descriptions.. being for newer geforce cards.
