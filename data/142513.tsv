2010-05-19T03:26:00.000Z	mirra	barbarella	wasn't a kernal update. didn't look like anything too important either. but i'm having a lot of problems.
2010-05-19T03:27:00.000Z	mirra	barbarella	ActionParsnip - my system boots fine. i'm on it right now. gnome has crashed like 4 times since. some apps die for no reason, etc..
