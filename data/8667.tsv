2011-10-16T11:14:00.000Z	tonijies		i've installed devilspie, because i want Thunderbird maximize and go to viewport 2 when i open it. I have created a thunderbird.ds in a ./devilspie directory in my personal directory. I know it's well configurated, because when Thunderbird is opened, if I execute devilspie, Thunderbird do the correct action and maximize in the viewport 2. But, if i have executed devilspie before, when i execute thunderbird, it doesn't the action; it apen a normal window
