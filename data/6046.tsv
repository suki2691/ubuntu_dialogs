2012-10-11T22:47:00.000Z	willdabeast		Anyone else want to try and help with Ubuntu 12.04 Video problems, in 3D mode but it won't allow me to set keyboard shortcuts such as alt-tab. It says "New Accelerator...".
2012-10-11T22:47:00.000Z	ThePendulum	willdabeast	Isn't alt-tab already assigned to window switching?
2012-10-11T22:48:00.000Z	willdabeast	ThePendulum	- it is, but the problem is it is disabled because it says I need a New accelerator or something.
2012-10-11T22:55:00.000Z	willdabeast	ThePendulum	or ririshi - any idea how to fix it? I think it has to do with video issues
