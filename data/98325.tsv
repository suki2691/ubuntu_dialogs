2009-03-12T22:48:00.000Z	panik		I am having a problem updating ubuntu
2009-03-12T22:49:00.000Z	panik		E: /var/cache/apt/archives/linux-image-2.6.27-7-generic_2.6.27-7.16_amd64.deb: short read in buffer_copy (backend dpkg-deb during `./boot/vmlinuz-2.6.27-7-generic')
2009-03-12T22:51:00.000Z	macrobad	panik	I would try deleting that file, or at least moving it elsewhere, and then running apt-get update
2009-03-12T23:08:00.000Z	macrobad	panik	sudo mv /var/cache/apt/archives/linux-image-2.6.27-7-generic_2.6.27-7.16_amd64.deb ~/
