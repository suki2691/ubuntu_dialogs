2011-11-15T23:50:00.000Z	zykotick9	nickkontos	i remember using some sdl-test script back in the day, to find out key values for something (i don't remember the specifics)
2011-11-15T23:50:00.000Z	nickkontos	zykotick9	yes, it is working in mupen64plus though it needs a bit config... that's why I need to know the numbers
2011-11-15T23:51:00.000Z	zykotick9	nickkontos	i've not an n64 controller with USB adapter that works perfect with mupen - really hard to map keys to an n64 controller (so many buttons on that thing).  Good luck.
