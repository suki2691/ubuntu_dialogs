2005-09-23T05:31:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	alturigo	can you give more detail of what is broken with it?
2005-09-23T05:31:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	alturigo	I updated to that and am having trouble.
2005-09-23T05:33:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	alturigo	the windows grub boot thing is a known issue and not related to the kernel itself, but to the script that modifies the /boot/grub/menu.list after installing.
