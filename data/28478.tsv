2010-10-04T13:36:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	TheKro_	better ask in #kubuntu or #kde
2010-10-04T13:36:00.000Z	TheKro_	ilovefairuz	already asked in #kubuntu, got no answer
2010-10-04T13:38:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	TheKro_	juk: gdb, strace and the likes are debugging tools not debug packages (which are the same as normal packages but  compiled with debugging symbols included not stripped)
