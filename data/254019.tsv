2005-01-02T16:06:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	siddharth	why do you need to download
2005-01-02T16:07:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		you can access it from evolution
2005-01-02T16:07:00.000Z	siddharth	HrdwrBoB	Correct, I have configured that at my office. I wanted a copy of the addressbook for my home where I do not have access to the LDAP server.
