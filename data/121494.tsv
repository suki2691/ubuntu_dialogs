2007-09-18T06:22:00.000Z	DWZ		Does anyone know a way to stop gparted from mounting a partition when it's run from the Ubuntu Live CD? Or at least, stop it from re-mounting it once I dismount the partition? (although, it could be Ubuntu doing this rather then gparted)
2007-09-18T06:23:00.000Z	hmhowie	DWZ	you could try stopping the haldaemon
2007-09-18T06:24:00.000Z	DWZ	hmhowie	sadly, I am somewhat stupid :( How can I do that, is there a simple command I can run from the terminal?
2007-09-18T06:30:00.000Z	DWZ	hmhowie	ah, don't worry if you're afk or something - just found the command in Google.  Cheers, thanks for the help
