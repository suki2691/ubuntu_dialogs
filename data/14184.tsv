2011-05-18T17:01:00.000Z	oates_		hi all, I have a problem with the eperl package on 10.04 it hangs on install forever and dpkg wont even kill -9. I now have an install of eperl that requires an install to remove, but the install hangs every time after unpacking. Does anyone have a tip on how to remove the package?
