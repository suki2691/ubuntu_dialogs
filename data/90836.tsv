2008-06-27T22:48:00.000Z	zloog		Hi, I'm going to let my sister start using my computer under her own account. Is there a way I can setup sudo such that she is only allowed to run 1 particular script as root but not do anything else that could hurt my comp?
2008-06-27T22:49:00.000Z	H__	zloog	: yes, man sudo

2008-06-27T22:52:00.000Z	H__	zloog	good :) there's probably examples here somewhere http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&c2coff=1&q=sudoers&btnG=Search
