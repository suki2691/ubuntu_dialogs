2005-04-18T06:43:00.000Z	akk	phlaegel	I have one that wasn't working, but I just discovered I didn't have sox installed.  I think the perl plugin part is working.
2005-04-18T06:44:00.000Z	phlaegel	akk	hm. I can't even get them to show up in the prefs list
2005-04-18T06:46:00.000Z	akk	phlaegel	Oh, hmm, just realized I'm running an xchat I built myself anyway, so I'm not a good test case.
