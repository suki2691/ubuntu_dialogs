2006-10-07T08:20:00.000Z	defcon8		I'm having problems with setting up my wireless network. iwlist scan finds my router fine. I set the ap to the address of the router and the mode to managed, from iwconfig. when I do iwconfig eth2 key off, I get some kind of error.
2006-10-07T08:21:00.000Z	Kyja	defcon8	its not eth0 or eth1 ??
2006-10-07T08:21:00.000Z	defcon8	Kyja	I have disabled those
2006-10-07T08:25:00.000Z	Kyja	defcon8	have you tried setting the channel?
