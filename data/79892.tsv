2008-09-11T15:52:00.000Z	mib_bio		I have a nice new server install here. I am wondering how is a an easy way to get a Desktop manager and some goodies without going all the way through with ubuntu-desktop
2008-09-11T15:52:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	mib_bio	why a gui for a server?
2008-09-11T15:53:00.000Z	mib_bio	DIFH-iceroot	so I can do some development and stuff sometimes with multiple workspaces and such
2008-09-11T15:53:00.000Z	DIFH-iceroot	mib_bio	ok
