2006-04-07T14:28:00.000Z	bimberi	eugman	put it in a directory where python will find it - such as /usr/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages
2006-04-09T05:37:00.000Z	bimberi	eugman	you could try downloading the deb via http://packages.ubuntu.com and installing using dpkg - if there aren't any dependency issues it should be OK
2006-04-09T06:06:00.000Z	bimberi	eugman	a sample one? - http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666
