2008-11-07T21:59:00.000Z	chuckmoney	think_linux	yes but I think you can use regex or wildcards.  not sure if you can actually list multiple files.  maybe comma-seperated?
2008-11-07T21:59:00.000Z	think_linux	chuckmoney	ill try comma
2008-11-07T21:59:00.000Z	chuckmoney	think_linux	like for example you could do this: mv pic00*.jpg /home/chuck/Pictures/
