2007-11-28T00:23:00.000Z	hardware-Rks		Thanks for the bluetooth pointers... one more question,  I'm installing ubuntu 7.10 on an compaq 4800 series laptop.  It has a 100GB harddrive with windows XP already installed.  When the guided partition manager comes up it wants to erase everything on the drive.  It does not see the NTFS partition it see's everything as free space.  When I reboot and remove the CD XP comes up fine... any hints.
