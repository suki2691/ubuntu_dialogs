2009-04-24T16:06:00.000Z	Pabix		Hello! I have accidentally deleted my /etc/gdm directory on a freshly upgraded Jaunty. Could someone with a Jaunty non-modified gdm archive the contents of this folder for me please? Thank you very much
2009-04-24T16:07:00.000Z	Pabix		I have no gdm.conf file after a apt-get --reinstall install gdm
2009-04-24T16:07:00.000Z	slytherin	Pabix	where are you looking for that file?
2009-04-24T16:09:00.000Z	slytherin	Pabix	don't have access to a jaunty system right now to verify. You should file a bug.
