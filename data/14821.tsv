2011-05-01T18:43:00.000Z	klingan		Hello everybody! I'm new to Ubuntu, therefor I ask this rookie-question: I have just installed VirtualBox and I want to edit my icon for my Windows7-shortcut to my *.vdi-file. Where are the application-based icons stored?
2011-05-01T18:44:00.000Z	wm_eddie	klingan	Right click on the vdi and select roperties.  The icon that you see in the Proprties window is a button. Click on it to customize the icon.
2011-05-01T18:45:00.000Z	klingan	wm_eddie	Yes, I have done that. Now I just need to find the path to where Virtual Box stores its icons.
2011-05-01T18:45:00.000Z	klingan	wm_eddie	The shortcut had an icon earlier, but it got removed, somehow.
