2010-06-10T22:44:00.000Z	etteyafed	bastidrazor	Well I have done it in some situations where I was on a local network or with VMs to do inital (like setup sudo etc) setup but it is usually much better to use SU. On ubuntu 10.04 desktop or server even it is not ever needed.

2010-06-10T23:02:00.000Z	etteyafed	bastidrazor	That is opinion. I know people that think sudo is insecure. It really depends on the system in question, its purpose and who needs access.
