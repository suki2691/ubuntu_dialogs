2005-08-30T06:04:00.000Z	apokryphos	rmflagg	no-one can without knowing the problem. Don't ask to ask. :)
2005-08-30T06:15:00.000Z	rmflagg	apokryphos	This is what I was talking about.  I ask the question and I get ignored...if I ask to ask, at least I get a response of some sort.
2005-08-30T06:15:00.000Z	apokryphos	rmflagg	why does that mean you should ask to ask?
