2008-06-10T09:46:00.000Z	puff	eross	Good suggestion, but no. Ever since the last kernel update (to 18, I believe, though now I'm on the proposed 19 and it's still a problem) my wireless just disappears after a while.  dhclient eth1 doesn't get a response, iwlist scan eth1 shows no networks, and ifup/ifdown never heard of eth1.  Rebooting restores it for a short while, then I'm back to there.

2008-06-10T09:48:00.000Z	puff	eross	I found a bug report, which, sadly, my laptop crashed before I could bookmark and now I can't find it again for some reason.  This bug report (180455 I thought, but that's apparently not it) said that the best bet was to revert to an earlier kernel.  But when I tried doing so by simply uinstalling kernel 2.6.24-19 and related packages, things got seriously hosed,  graphics didn't work, etc.
