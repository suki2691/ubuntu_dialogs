2007-10-05T11:27:00.000Z	hhp2k		Hello everyone, quick question: ./configure on a set of screensavers I'm trying to install ends with "configure: error: can't compile without X". Does that even make any sense, and if so, how do i fix that?

2007-10-05T11:28:00.000Z	hhp2k	paulowsky	That's it! I should have thought about that. Thanks :)
