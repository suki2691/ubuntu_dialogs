2007-01-13T12:03:00.000Z	lun		hi all, how to get the most current kernel, i.e. 2.6.20 working in edgy? is there a tutorial?
2007-01-13T12:04:00.000Z	lun		the nvidia driver and ndiswrapper problem is fixed in the new 2.6.20 kernel, that's why I want it
2007-01-13T12:04:00.000Z	lun		Can I upgrade my edgy directly into fiesty?
