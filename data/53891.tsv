2009-06-23T05:37:00.000Z	thinkle79	fattybutterpance	I haven't tried a live USB but presumably wireless would work -- wireless worked fine when I installed jaunty fresh and it worked fine until the recent kernel upgrade. It also works fine now (with the latest kernel) but my graphics are broken and I can't seem to downgrade.

2009-06-23T05:48:00.000Z	thinkle79	fattybutterpance	Thanks -- I think that's a different graphics driver though. I found this -- http://mok0.wordpress.com/2009/05/25/ubuntu-on-the-dell-mini-10-2/ -- which has a comment that refers to exactly what I'm experiencing. Unfortunately, the solution (install psb-kernel-source) isn't working as I'm getting error building the module.
