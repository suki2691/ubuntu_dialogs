2011-11-14T09:25:00.000Z	Zutara		Anyone know how I would bridge my eth0/1 with my ra0 on 10.04? Everytime I bring the bridge up it knocks my Wireless out.

2011-11-14T09:30:00.000Z	Zutara	zykotick9_	thanks for the link. I guess I'm screwed trying to connect my 360 to the internet when my router is downstairs, eh?
