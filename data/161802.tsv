2007-04-20T09:16:00.000Z	pipak		hello :) I have a little question: could anyone point me to a good lightweight IDE to program in perl (no emacs and such for me)?
2007-04-20T09:17:00.000Z	garryFre	pipak	Might try Eclipse it has many plugins for things like ruby, and perl.
2007-04-20T09:18:00.000Z	garryFre	pipak	oops, I didn't see the light weight
2007-04-20T09:19:00.000Z	pipak	garryFre	indeed it's not very lightweight, but it's still maybe worth a try :)
