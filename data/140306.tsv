2007-05-08T16:29:00.000Z	skrubbles		hi all
2007-05-08T16:31:00.000Z	skrubbles		I'm a newb when it comes to Linux and so obviously I'm a newb with Ubuntu... I'm just now installing in on another computer of mine.  After installation and booting my computer I get asked for my username (which is skrubbles) and my password... so I input the correct info and now all I sww is skrubbles@ubuntu:~$
2007-05-08T16:32:00.000Z	skrubbles		is there a command I need to use to boot into the desktop?
2007-05-08T16:32:00.000Z	GrueTamer	skrubbles	startx is the command
