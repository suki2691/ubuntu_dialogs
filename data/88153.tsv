2009-05-19T03:42:00.000Z	zaccour		how come I can't install the Ubuntu Dell iso i burned to a disc? all it shows is some words and someone's first and last name
2009-05-19T03:42:00.000Z	joaopinto	zaccour	are you sure it's a regular ubuntu cd ?
2009-05-19T03:43:00.000Z	zaccour	joaopinto	its the one from the dell mod
2009-05-19T03:43:00.000Z	joaopinto	zaccour	so you need to ask dell, we don't know nothing about that here
