2006-07-15T11:53:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	pppoe_dude	it's burstable to 3mbps, and that depends on how fast the pipe is for the server you are connecting to
2006-07-15T11:53:00.000Z	pppoe_dude	FunnyLookinHat	the router shows the current speeds as 1.7
2006-07-15T11:54:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	pppoe_dude	Hmm strange.  I wonder how the router is getting that speed.
