2010-08-13T02:46:00.000Z	gundas		Hello all. I'm running 9.10 Ubuntu Server and would like to install a torrent client on it which I can access via the web. Does any one have any good ideas?

2010-08-13T02:51:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	gundas	i believe there are several torrent clients with web frontend - i just haven't used them.  good luck.
