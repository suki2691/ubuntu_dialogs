2008-06-02T06:38:00.000Z	bcl1713	red22	should be in sessions

2008-06-02T06:43:00.000Z	red22	bcl1713	compiz is working, i just get choppy video and effects, and 3d games are a slide show bc the default display is running mesa drivers... if i send the video to display=:0 then things run smoothly (but no window manager)
