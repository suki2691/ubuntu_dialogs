2011-11-26T02:18:00.000Z	ryan__		Hi. Is there a way I can install programs from older Ubuntu repositories using Ubuntu 11.10?
2011-11-26T02:18:00.000Z	ryan__		Natty is what I was wanting to install from
2011-11-26T02:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	ryan__	 you could always just get the .deb of it and extact the wallpapers if you wanted the images
2011-11-26T02:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	ryan__	get the .deb  and sudo dpkg -i foo.deb  is one way
