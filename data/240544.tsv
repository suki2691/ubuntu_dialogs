2005-05-04T06:28:00.000Z	natecull		a lot of hosting sites I've looked at recently only have php4
2005-05-04T06:28:00.000Z	natecull		presumably there's a reason
2005-05-04T06:29:00.000Z	a_peck	natecull	php5 isn't even in the repositories... I do wonder if it's worth it. Has anyone tried and has a view?
