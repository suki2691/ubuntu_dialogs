2009-03-18T07:28:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit		Here's a can of worms:  Will the next compiz / nautilus / gnome / X allow us to have different backgrounds and icons on different viewports?  Will we see this during the Jaunty cycle?

2009-03-18T07:30:00.000Z	crdlb	TwoToneSpirit	using compiz, you can have different wallpapers, but only if you disable nautilus icons entirely
2009-03-18T07:31:00.000Z	TwoToneSpirit	crdlb	Yeah, I can't really get down that way at this point.  I'm patient - just wondering when.
