2009-07-20T19:35:00.000Z	shiki-		can anyone help me with PPA? Want to make a package be built for 8.04,8.10,9.04. I read the howto, guide, debian standards. Prepared everything , split packages. Still, if I upload, it'll only say its the same..and it'll build it for jaunty. Even though the package name says hardy, and the changelog is the same. Where should I define it?
