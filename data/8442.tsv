2011-10-22T11:07:00.000Z	snark		How come when I try to "sudo cd /directory" it tells me that the command cd doesn't exist? o.O
2011-10-22T11:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	snark	 sudo cd, is a rather pointless command
2011-10-22T11:09:00.000Z	dr_willis		cd is a bash built in. might be why.
2011-10-22T11:09:00.000Z	snark	dr_willis	 Yeah, I have no practical use for it.  I just wanted to peek around /root, which I can do with ls of course, but it just made me wonder why cd wouldn't work.
