2012-09-23T01:58:00.000Z	zykotick9	clouder`g	why switch?  check out starting from !mini - you get LOTS of options for installing ubuntu
2012-09-23T01:59:00.000Z	clouder`g	zykotick9	not switching, but if I am developing on desktop then push up to server of same version. should be cake right?
2012-09-23T02:00:00.000Z	zykotick9	clouder`g	ya (sorry misunderstood your intentions).  they should almost be identical!
