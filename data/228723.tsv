2006-06-06T13:17:00.000Z	keir	sladen	yes, but they *did* work originally; only after i turned on evdev for my mouse (and subsequently turned it off) btw this is a desktop with ms wireless desktop pro
2006-06-06T13:18:00.000Z	sladen	keir	please file a bug and we'll debug it there.  Please mention in the bug exactly what you did
