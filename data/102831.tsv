2012-08-06T22:05:00.000Z	n2diy		can I run a cable from my router in the living room into the basement, and connect another router to it, to use multible computers in the basement?
2012-08-06T22:05:00.000Z	Gary_inNYC	n2diy	set up the second router as a dummy access point
2012-08-06T22:07:00.000Z	Gary_inNYC	n2diy	also disable DHCP on the secondary router
2012-08-06T22:08:00.000Z	Gary_inNYC	n2diy	assign a static ip to the router functioning as access point that is outside the range of the primary router's dhcp range to avoid conflict
