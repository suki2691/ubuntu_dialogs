2009-07-18T18:39:00.000Z	quatar-it		hi all. i have a font in my system whose name is "serif", so some applications (such as chrome and firefox) think it's the default serif font for my desktop. How can i uninstall it or rename it? I don't know where to look to understand if it's installed for the os or for the single user.
