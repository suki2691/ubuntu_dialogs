2008-11-06T11:16:00.000Z	DBO		anyone got any idea how to check if a disk is spun down programatically (even a shell script capable of doing this would be enough)
2008-11-06T11:18:00.000Z	elpargo	DBO	maybe that's your filesystems, fault.
2008-11-06T11:19:00.000Z	DBO	elpargo	nah.  I know its GNOME Do's fault.  I wrote it to do some disk intensive things from time to time.  Which is fine if the disk is spun up...
2008-11-06T11:21:00.000Z	elpargo	DBO	oh well, maybe there is something in /proc ?
