2010-06-06T05:28:00.000Z	acicula	MasterZuFu	if you cant understand the configuration file maybe look for another solution then running an ftp server
2010-06-06T05:29:00.000Z	MasterZuFu	acicula	i'm trying to setup livezilla, which requires ftp for it's automated install. so i need ftp, there's not another solution for this that i'll be able to understand
2010-06-06T05:30:00.000Z	MasterZuFu	acicula	which is why i'm asking for help.
