2006-11-29T12:29:00.000Z	crzygrndpa		Is there a reason why the system hangs after I enter my user name when I connect via FTP or SSH... it will hang for about 20 seconds then prompt for a password. Any reason for this?
2006-11-29T12:30:00.000Z	Hexidigital	crzygrndpa	what type of connection? LAN or over the 'net?
2006-11-29T12:30:00.000Z	crzygrndpa	Hexidigital	over the net
2006-11-29T12:31:00.000Z	Hexidigital	crzygrndpa	could just be lag on the net... that happens to me too, somewhere
