2006-06-29T13:28:00.000Z	Assassin5		sudo is all very well if I know the root password. Trust me, it asked me to add a user, but didn't ask for the root password.
2006-06-29T13:29:00.000Z	ardchoille	Assassin5	sudo doesn't use the root password
2006-06-29T13:30:00.000Z	ardchoille	Assassin5	that's what sudo is for. I have been running Linux for years and haven't needed to log into root
