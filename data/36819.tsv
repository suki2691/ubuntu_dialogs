2010-03-29T03:55:00.000Z	jonex		whats the path to edit my grub list? Ubuntu appears like 10 times..
2010-03-29T03:56:00.000Z	Typos_King	jonex	    /boot/grub/grub.cfg    is the one with the boot entries, but many here will point out that /etc/defaults/grub is the one  that has the template to make grub.cfg, so you can edit either I gather, I do my editing on grub.cfg and back it up :)
