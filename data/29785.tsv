2011-10-06T22:39:00.000Z	KeyLimePi	w30	Ah, okay.  I had no problems installing the drivers. Im just trying to ascertain why my 3D program insists that it cant use the stereo buffer of my vid  card
2011-10-06T22:42:00.000Z	w30	KeyLimePi	stereo buffer is a video card issue? I would have thought of sound problem with that error. That shows you what I know eh?
2011-10-06T22:43:00.000Z	KeyLimePi	w30	Yeah. I dont know why its not working now. Only noticed it cuz I tried to render out some shapes in Maya.  Then  I got this error: Warning: Unable to get OpenGL visual with a stereo buffer, trying without //.
