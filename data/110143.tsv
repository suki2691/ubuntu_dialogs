2007-12-10T04:44:00.000Z	Later2		I have a question about CD burning of the OS and available software for it.
2007-12-10T04:45:00.000Z	Zionad_	Later2	whats your question
2007-12-10T04:47:00.000Z	Zionad_	Later2	it could be a multitude of problems, including the brand of your cds AND the speed, I would ALWAYS reccomend a lower speed setting while burning.
2007-12-10T04:47:00.000Z	Zionad_	Later2	activeISO is a good program
