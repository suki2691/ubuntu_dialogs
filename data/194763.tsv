2006-05-03T10:22:00.000Z	Crescendo		my sound icon in my tray disappeared, how to get it back?
2006-05-03T10:23:00.000Z	DBO	Crescendo	in there you want the Volume Control applet
2006-05-03T11:07:00.000Z	DBO	Crescendo	are you using 1.5?
2006-05-03T11:07:00.000Z	DBO	Crescendo	you either have to chown FF1.5's install directory (and chown it back) or run FF as root to get FF1.5 to update.  Either way make sure you change it back as soon as your are done
