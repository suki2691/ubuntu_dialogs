2009-07-20T14:13:00.000Z	Anquietas		Hello, for 2 weeks now, Firefox 3.5 is available to download... I am using Ubuntu and I still don't find it in the repositories, when will it be added ?... My windows friends are already using it... how can I trigger an update to switch to FF 3.5 ? or how much should I wait for it ?
