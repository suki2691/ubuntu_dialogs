2007-06-17T10:24:00.000Z	Hillview		hello.. got a quick question.. I'm looking for an easy/painless way to make copies of a homebrewed DVD movie.  k9copy is giving me some trouble, so I'm wondering if there's an easier way I'm missing. ;)

2007-06-17T10:25:00.000Z	Hillview	n2diy	haven't tried it.. you're familiar with k3b?
2007-06-17T10:26:00.000Z	n2diy	Hillview	yes, but I haven't burned a DVD, only cds.
