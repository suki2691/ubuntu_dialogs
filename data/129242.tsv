2007-07-04T10:20:00.000Z	Stwange		how can I convert a filesystem from NTFS to linux and mount it at /portal/, preferrably from ubuntu
2007-07-04T10:20:00.000Z	dystopianray	Stwange	why do you want to convert it?
2007-07-04T10:21:00.000Z	Stwange	dystopianray	 - It's slower, and I only kept it NTFS until I managed to get a VM working for Windows
2007-07-04T10:21:00.000Z	dystopianray	Stwange	as far as I know it is not possible to do an in-place conversion to ext3 from ntfs
