2004-11-03T17:12:00.000Z	stvn	mdz	sorry, i meant 2.6.8.1-3 ;)
2004-11-03T17:13:00.000Z	mdz	stvn	likewise, Debian has no 2.6.8.1-3 :-)
2004-11-03T17:14:00.000Z	stvn	mdz	heh, well ok never install two 2.6.8 kernels, grub/ubuntu got confused and used the wrong modules giving a horrid error and it refuses to mount /var which is very annoying/not workable
