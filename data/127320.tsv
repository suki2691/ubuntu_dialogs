2007-09-14T16:11:00.000Z	Shoopuf		I want to start dual-booting Ubuntu, I have not installed it yet, and I am running Windows XP. Except, my only problem is I'm quite afraid that during the "partition" step I will lose some of my data. How can I avoid this, or am I paranoid?

2007-09-14T16:12:00.000Z	MattJ	Shoopuf	I have never lost any (and I have installed Ubuntu many, many times). But if you don't back up your data, you will lose it some day :)
2007-09-14T16:16:00.000Z	Shoopuf	MattJ	Frogzoo: Thanks. I will backup again. :) It's been a few months. But maybe I just wait until Gutsy Gibbon before dual-booting...
