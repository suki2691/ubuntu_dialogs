2007-12-16T13:13:00.000Z	externalUSBinsta		I can only create 4 partitions and then the rest of the space is given as 'unusable' and there is a max of 200gb per partition
2007-12-16T13:14:00.000Z	externalUSBinsta		how can I divide 750 into 10gb swap, + 3*200 == 600 == 610 gb only...
2007-12-16T13:14:00.000Z	lardarse	externalUSBinsta	you need to make 1 of the 4 partitions an extended partition
