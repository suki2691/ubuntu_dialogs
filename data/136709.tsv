2007-04-26T09:39:00.000Z	gregolyo		I've installed ubuntu-7.04-desktop-i386 one very old desktop already ... but on a (slightly less old) Dell OptiPlex GX50 get dropped into the busybox after selecting "Start or install Ubuntu" or the "Start Ubuntu on safe graphics mode" option.  Suggestions?

2007-04-26T09:43:00.000Z	gregolyo	PhilK	Is there a place to find (or report) MB's that fail a 7.04 desk top install?
2007-04-26T09:44:00.000Z	PhilK	gregolyo	not sure, I just know I remember hearing about some models of Dell having trouble with certain SATA controllers onboard
