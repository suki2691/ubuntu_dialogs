2005-08-12T07:45:00.000Z	rommer		can anyone help me change the select colour of gdm options from the default brown to match another theme, and also to take the ubuntu gnome loading screen (which shows loading panel etc) away or change it to something else?
2005-08-12T07:46:00.000Z	znh	rommer	start gdmsetup, with sudo
2005-08-12T07:48:00.000Z	rommer	znh	there is nothing about changing the option select colour there
2005-08-12T07:48:00.000Z	znh	rommer	you can change the splash-screen, and the theme
