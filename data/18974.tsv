2012-07-24T18:51:00.000Z	Artheas		hi! i just updated from ubuntu 10 to 12.04. i had used kmail in ubuntu 10 and now i want to use thunderbirt.
2012-07-24T18:51:00.000Z	Artheas		i backed up my home folder before the update.
2012-07-24T18:52:00.000Z	Artheas		now, kwallet and kmail dont work anymore together: kmail says that it couldn't get the password from kwallet.
2012-07-24T18:52:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	Artheas	 i'm not familiar with kmail, but thunderbird has an import option
