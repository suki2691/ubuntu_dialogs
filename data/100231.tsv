He is experiencing some issue, every time he boot windows at the next reboot grub does not load, it stay on "loading grub" forever, he has to boot from a live cd, chroot on the system and reinstall grub. Did anyone ever experience something like this and have an idea of what could going on here?

2009-12-10T01:49:00.000Z	mastro	Seveas	doubt it, he just installed windows/ubuntu from scratch
2009-12-10T01:55:00.000Z	mastro	Seveas	he said he did not connect to the internet until he installed the SP3 service pack and an antivirus... so i don't think he got a virus on XP... do you know any other reason that could lead at this behaviour? i made him install ubuntu on 2 partition: a /boot partition (ext2) and a root partition (ext4) + swap. may it be something related to grub2 + ext2?
