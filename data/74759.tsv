2011-12-24T20:19:00.000Z	bonita		another thing: I was trying to add apps to my top panel(like where clock is). I've searched the web and found out, that when you press alt and  right click the "add" menu pops up. But it doesn't work in my case. Anyone tried that?

2011-12-24T21:33:00.000Z	robin0800	bonita	system settings language
2011-12-24T21:36:00.000Z	bonita	robin0800	you mean language support? There's no option so I could add let's say German and use both of them whenever I nedd.
