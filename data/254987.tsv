2005-05-13T05:02:00.000Z	darkmark		Hi all, I have a problem with snd-usb-audio on Hoary, how do I gather enough information to file a bug on it?
2005-05-13T05:04:00.000Z	darkmark		if i boot ubuntu with the usb audio hardware plugged in, the system is almost unusable, but if i manually modprobe snd-usb-audio before plugging in the usb audio everything is fine
2005-05-13T05:04:00.000Z	darkmark		any ideas anyone?
2005-05-13T05:04:00.000Z	mdke	darkmark	sounds like enough information. once you've filed the bug, they'll let you know
