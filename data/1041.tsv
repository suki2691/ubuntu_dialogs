2012-09-23T22:52:00.000Z	gunarm1		i was trying to fix my wifi drivers by following some instructions and ended up (i think on a development branch) of the kernel,  when I get to the login screen on a terminal it says "Ubuntu quantal (devleopment branch)"  everything is screwed up, my gdb background is different, the battery icon in my toolbar is too big to fit in its allotted space, and worst of all my desktop manager won't run anymore so none of my windows have boarders.
2012-09-23T22:52:00.000Z	gunarm1		Any suggestions on how to fix this?
