2011-04-30T04:43:00.000Z	Kibo		Good night guys. Maybe someone could help me? I might have rebooted my system before the upgrade to 11.04 was over (the login screen was showing "reboot needed" or something to that effect). Now the box won't boot, and the kernel/dist is not showing on GRUB screen. Can I salvage it with a 10.10 live (USB)?
2011-04-30T04:44:00.000Z	Kibo		When I reboot, the GRUB shows, but I only have 10.10's listed
2011-04-30T04:44:00.000Z	Rehan	Kibo	are you trying to hide the grub screen?
2011-04-30T04:45:00.000Z	Kibo	Rehan	No. The GRUB screen shows, I select the last kernel (still 10.10) and the boot stops, complaining of a disk not mounted....
