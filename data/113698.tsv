2007-11-17T04:07:00.000Z	dx9s_home		anybody have an expected timeframe on fixing the permissions issue on *samba* 3.0.26a-1ubuntu2.1 stuff?
2007-11-17T04:09:00.000Z	crdlb	dx9s_home	they changed the permissions because the package is broken (to prevent people from downloading it)
2007-11-17T04:09:00.000Z	dx9s_home	crdlb	I figured as much
2007-11-17T04:09:00.000Z	dx9s_home	crdlb	TY
