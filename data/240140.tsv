2006-06-15T07:23:00.000Z	N9URK		ctl alt F7 doesn't do anything
2006-06-15T07:25:00.000Z	N9URK		I just did "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and got "xserver~ is not installed and no info available" what would cause the ubuntu install to not install xserver-xorg?
2006-06-15T07:26:00.000Z	nickrud	N9URK	did you do a server install?
