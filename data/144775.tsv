2007-02-27T14:53:00.000Z	VonFluffy	Ademan	i highly suggest Exaile media player
2007-02-27T14:53:00.000Z	Ademan	VonFluffy	well i've been using amarok for the longest time, i just thought i'd check out banshee
2007-02-27T14:53:00.000Z	VonFluffy	Ademan	well if you are a gnome guy then exaile would fit in better
