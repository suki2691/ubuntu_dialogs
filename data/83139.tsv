2012-04-27T04:19:00.000Z	Fizzik		Hi guys, I have installed tightvncserver on my ubuntu 12.04 machine and the service has started but i cant connect it to it from my windows machine. I don't know what could be wrong but any suggestions on possibly solving the issue or trying something else?
2012-04-27T04:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fizzik	can you ping the name?
2012-04-27T04:20:00.000Z	Fizzik	ActionParsnip	yes because i am sshd into the machine
2012-04-27T04:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fizzik	is the service running now?
