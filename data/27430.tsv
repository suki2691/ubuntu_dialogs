2010-10-11T00:26:00.000Z	rypervenche	Aemaeth	Which server are you using? I know mine didn't show since I was on the French server and it's apparently not updated yet.

2010-10-25T12:28:00.000Z	rypervenche	Aemaeth	I need recording directly from OpenGL, not like recordmydesktop. I have gotten glc but it doesn't work 100% and is no longer supported. Same with yukon.
