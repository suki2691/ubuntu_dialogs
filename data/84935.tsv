2011-02-28T03:32:00.000Z	pessoptimistic		so how come I get this http://twitpic.com/44iamp when I attempt to install 10.10?
2011-02-28T03:33:00.000Z	pessoptimistic		nibbler: but look at the gparted window.  I do have a "/" fs?
2011-02-28T03:34:00.000Z	nibbler_	pessoptimistic	thats "label" not "mountpoint"
2011-02-28T03:33:00.000Z	nibbler_	pessoptimistic	because you dont have a root fs - if you do it manually, be sure to have some space with mountpoint "/" (this is the root fs)
