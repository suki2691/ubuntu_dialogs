2011-03-27T15:15:00.000Z	soreau	inslan4	one burns a file to disk as data, the other burns the contents of the file to disk (iso image)
2011-03-27T15:16:00.000Z	inslan4	soreau	 so if i wanted to burn iso image to disc i select 'burn contents' right?
2011-03-27T15:17:00.000Z	soreau	inslan4	that would be my assumption
