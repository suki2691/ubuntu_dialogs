2010-08-10T00:00:00.000Z	ag0ny	w4n	no. Ill give you an example: I have 20 files name track 1, track 2 and so on. And I want to set the title # (not the title itself) of the mp3 tags
2010-08-10T00:03:00.000Z	w4n	ag0ny	take a look at easytag, it should do the trick
2010-08-10T00:03:00.000Z	ag0ny	w4n	ok, i will
