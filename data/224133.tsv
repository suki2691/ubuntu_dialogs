2005-12-03T16:43:00.000Z	Radiobuzz		I have a question
2005-12-03T16:44:00.000Z	Radiobuzz		five Ubuntu copies have arrived today at my house, however I can't install it nor use the LiveCD because it tells me that a file is corrupt, this is happening with every CD I got :S
2005-12-03T16:45:00.000Z	oxez	Radiobuzz	did you order the cds for the right arch?
