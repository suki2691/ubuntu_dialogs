2009-03-24T04:04:00.000Z	slimjim		the thing is this is not ubuntu it is a deb based distro but not ubuntu and not debian direct
2009-03-24T04:05:00.000Z	jrib	slimjim	then this isn't the right channel...
2009-03-24T04:05:00.000Z	jrib	slimjim	but unless your distro did something very stupid, ubottu gave you directions on adding repositories in ubuntu through the command line that should work
