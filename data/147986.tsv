2007-04-26T06:57:00.000Z	AMAG		linxeh:If you don't mind my asking, which 30" display do you like best?  I bought the Dell model but only because the Apple and HP displays are a tiny bit larger, and they will not fit underneath the hutch on my desk :)
2007-04-26T06:58:00.000Z	AMAG		XeOn maybe you can be specific about the error message displayed
2007-04-26T06:58:00.000Z	AMAG		I just struggled with the 7.04 gdm for a while before I got it working.  I believe the gdmsetup X11 app is a bit buggy.
2007-04-26T06:59:00.000Z	_`XeOn_	AMAG	how i can see the error again if i can only see when i boot up
