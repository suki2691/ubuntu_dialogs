2007-12-21T04:03:00.000Z	MacTheMad		can anyone tell me if I'm behind a router do I want to enter the dns addresses from my service provider or do I want to enter the router (gateway) address
2007-12-21T04:04:00.000Z	thor	MacTheMad	your service provider unless your router does dns
2007-12-21T04:05:00.000Z	MacTheMad	thor	no router doesn't do dns as far as I know but when setting up the router I did need to type them there
2007-12-21T04:08:00.000Z	MacTheMad	thor	that's the way I have other machine setup now but can't connect to install packages nor can I ping an internet address
