2011-05-21T06:16:00.000Z	tapple		how do I figure out what opengl driver X is using? I believe it's using the wrong one. my symptom is that glxinfo and every other opengl application freeze and have to be force killed. I googled that, and got a suggestion to "remove nvidia drivers from an ati system". How do I find out if I'm using nvidia drivers, and get rid of them if so?
