2012-05-07T02:36:00.000Z	bm27_		So, I've been having issues getting some web content working lately. Namely Pandora, Grooveshark, even Facebook sometimes. I've tried enabling/disabling javascript, uninstalling/reinstalling flash, and testing accross several browsers...what should I try next?
2012-05-07T02:37:00.000Z	a_b0y	bm27_	try windows, that's what i did
2012-05-07T02:38:00.000Z	bm27_	a_b0y	Like the OS? somehow that doesn't seem like a solution. I don't believe I am, but it might be worth looking into. Generally they load for a good 2-3 seconds, then blank out or give me a flash error.
2012-05-07T02:45:00.000Z	a_b0y	bm27_	that was the same problem i was having amoung others
