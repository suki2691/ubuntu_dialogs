2011-11-09T20:53:00.000Z	SinusPi	haylo_	tried all that. The only thing the lap wants to boot from, is its HDD. Under DOS, I'd just put the HDD in a USB enclosure, move it to another machine, SYS it, and move it back into the laptop. It'd probably cry that the drive isn't hibernated anymore, but should run. Unfortunately, I have no DOS handy, and it's NTFS anyway...

2011-11-09T20:59:00.000Z	SinusPi	haylo_	I can't enter BIOS on the lappy; it's stuck in the "unhibernate only" mode some laptops now have.
