2007-06-17T10:35:00.000Z	Nutubuntu		I've been having trouble burning an iso image. The image file is about 695MB, and it looks like my burner thinks my CDs (which are marked 700MB) will only hold 650. How do I correct this? I've pastebinned the log at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/25994/ -- see lines 53-54 and 76
