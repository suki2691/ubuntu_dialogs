2007-05-15T12:24:00.000Z	Gerro		is there a guide for getting a media player fully working with all codecs possible and integrating it with browsers? gxine, mplayer ,etc don't care which any guide would be helpful. Also gxine keeps raping my cdrom everytime it starts leads to lot of crashing too, auto play features suck they always do! what if a virus was the autoplay on that music cd?
