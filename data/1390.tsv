2012-09-04T23:27:00.000Z	vicium\a		Anyone proficent in networking? My connection has been acting REALLY wierd since 10 hours ago or so... It's like using 0.5% of its capacity.. My ISP says nothing is wrong on their end so... I tried downloading a random file just now to see the speed, it starts out at like 30 kb/s (I have 100 mbit, usual speeds about 12 mb/s) and after the 30 kb/s start it goes down to like 1 kb/s - 5kb/s
2012-09-04T23:27:00.000Z	vicium\a		stuttering as hell.... Just to compare I downloaded a random linux dist iso ftom ftp://sunet.se and I max my speed there... So http downloads = slow as hell, I ping like 3000 on my voice chat server instead of the usual 12 ms ~ Anyone please? :P
