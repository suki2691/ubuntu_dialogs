2006-08-06T07:36:00.000Z	sethk	syndicate47	temporarily, you can use a file in a partition with empty space to increase swap
2006-08-06T07:36:00.000Z	sethk	syndicate47	permanently you have to increase swap partition size, or add additional swap partition(s)
2006-08-06T07:36:00.000Z	sethk	syndicate47	if you only need the extra swap space occasionally the swap in normal file system configuration is good enough.
