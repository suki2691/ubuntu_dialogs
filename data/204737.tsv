2007-08-02T10:44:00.000Z	Geek	braniff	itunes store music would have DRM... remove that and its mp4
2007-08-02T10:46:00.000Z	braniff	Geek	so what you are saying is: remove the DRM and life is good (mp4 to mp3 converters are readily available)
2007-08-02T10:47:00.000Z	Geek	braniff	you can burn a MP4 i think, with the right converter
