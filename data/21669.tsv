2010-12-19T23:31:00.000Z	Friar		I'm looking at building a new computer.....I do a lot of ripping DVDs and CDs so I want something with a lot of CPU power....I'm looking at the phenom 6 core. anyone have any comments about the phenom 6 core vs. the intel 6 core?
2010-12-19T23:32:00.000Z	sam-_-_	Friar	why would you need a 6 core. any reasons?
2010-12-19T23:36:00.000Z	sam-_-_	Friar	i would google for some benchmarks with x264
2010-12-19T23:36:00.000Z	sam-_-_	Friar	they are quite common. be sure that they use the same settings
