2011-03-24T17:25:00.000Z	bcarm17		i'd be happy with a i386 complient distro that can run on less than 64mb ram and still be able to run firefox 4 with flash installed
2011-03-24T17:26:00.000Z	jrib	bcarm17	yes good luck with flash...
2011-03-24T17:27:00.000Z	jrib	bcarm17	ubuntu minimal, install your favorite minimalistic window manager
2011-03-24T17:29:00.000Z	jrib	bcarm17	try something like fluxbox as your window manager.  firefox 4 probably won't run well on that system though
