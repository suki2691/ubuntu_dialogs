2009-07-20T02:35:00.000Z	ShackJack	OttifantSir	I have not - will take a look
2009-07-20T02:38:00.000Z	OttifantSir	ShackJack	I know there's something called OggPlay for Symbian, but don't know what the Pre runs exactly
2009-07-20T02:38:00.000Z	ShackJack	OttifantSir	Oh yeah, I'll try it... I just figured natch it plays it since it used the linux kernel and the OS itself is based on open standards...
