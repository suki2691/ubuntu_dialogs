2009-08-25T18:34:00.000Z	C-S-B		/usr/source seems to have odd permissions meaning id have to compile as root
2009-08-25T18:34:00.000Z	grawity	C-S-B	~/Projects
2009-08-25T18:35:00.000Z	C-S-B	grawity	thanks, i was unclear though, I meant source for apps like mplayer or the kernel...not personal code.
