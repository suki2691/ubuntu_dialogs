2011-07-17T01:50:00.000Z	improveupon	pyroscope	you are really sure it is a hardware problem, and a reinstall of the os will not solve anything?
2011-07-17T01:51:00.000Z	pyroscope	improveupon	i'm sure i'd retire that hd altogether or to backup if it were my data ;)
2011-07-17T02:15:00.000Z	improveupon	pyroscope	that was very interesting. what did that Ctrl + Alt + SysRq, etc. command do? do such commands work on all distros? can you direct me to a page with this and similar information?
