2006-05-11T11:37:00.000Z	intelikey	sgusev	did you set up a user account ?
2006-05-11T11:40:00.000Z	intelikey	sgusev	ok.  do this.  hit [alt] +[F2]    [enter]    and type 'chroot /target passwd '   and type in a root password.  then [alt] +[f1]    and skip that step. go on with the install.   (assuming the password is set without error.)   then after you finish the install and reboot come back and we can clean that up.
