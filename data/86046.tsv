2008-07-09T12:41:00.000Z	Shooooo		Is there a way to set my Ubuntu theme/screen/resolution/stuff back to default? I was messing around with "Screen" and "Nvidia X Server Settings" and "Compiz-Fusion" and I think I kinda scrweed things up.

2008-07-09T12:43:00.000Z	Shooooo	elpargo	I see, so that stuff is stored in xorg.conf... Thanks, but I don't think I made a backup lol >>__<<
