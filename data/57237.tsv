2011-01-22T03:23:00.000Z	ejv		hi everybody, i have a pretty standard, default installation of apache2 and a site that is non https, i want to enable secure connections for those who want to use it, i have a virtual host called ejv that begins with <Virtualhost *:80> and then all the arguments... do I need to copy the entire block and change 80 to 443, then insert the SSLEngine on and all the other parameters?
