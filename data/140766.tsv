2007-05-01T08:08:00.000Z	hidan		hey all, i just created a new fat32 partition. However, Ubuntu mounts it as /media/disk instead of /media/hdc2 . Also, Ubuntu seems to have mounted something else as /media/hdc2 . Any ideas?

2007-05-01T08:13:00.000Z	hidan	pike_	oh dear, in fstab: seems /media/disk can't be found anywhere. there is a /media/hdc2 in fstab though but it's listed as an ntfs entry? huh?
