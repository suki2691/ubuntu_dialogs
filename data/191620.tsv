2010-11-07T13:41:00.000Z	nici		I upgraded to 10.10 yesterday and now I keep getting logged out all the time. More specifically when starting Opera or touching Skype (these two never fails) and also sometimes quite randomly. Any ideas what might be causing this?

2010-11-07T13:50:00.000Z	nici	MTecknology	checked xsession-errors after a crash... nothing there. Are there any other log files worth checking out?
2010-11-07T13:51:00.000Z	MTecknology	nici	nah.. if X were crashing it;d be there - I'm not really sure otherwise though
