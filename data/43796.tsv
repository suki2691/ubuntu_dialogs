2009-11-26T16:47:00.000Z	mercutio22	Spixx	where is the transmission folder?
2009-11-26T16:49:00.000Z	mercutio22	Spixx	.transmission inexists. I am afraid I don't see anything in the settings menu. But probably the files are downloaded to the internal HD before being transfered to the external one
2009-11-26T16:51:00.000Z	Spixx	mercutio22	yes that is what happens there is a choise of "deleting source file" when done try that?
