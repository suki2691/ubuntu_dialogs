2008-02-04T01:42:00.000Z	th0r		flats you probably have to google it. It is easy to install and set up, but does require samba be installed on the server side. I always install samba by default as part of linux anyway
2008-02-04T01:42:00.000Z	ampex	th0r	why fusesmb instead of just using cifs?
2008-02-04T01:43:00.000Z	th0r	ampex	my network appears as a folder in my file manager and is accessible just like any other folder. I run xfce and nothing else will do that
