2008-08-08T16:50:00.000Z	Moojk		if I want to use the same wlan card on two networks, should there be two configurations showing up when I type "iwconfig" ?

2008-08-08T16:51:00.000Z	jimqode	Moojk	wlan cards can only pair with one network at a time. I don't know about windows.
2008-08-08T16:52:00.000Z	jimqode	Moojk	then you will only see the active configuration on iwconfig output
