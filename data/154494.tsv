2006-12-14T06:46:00.000Z	l3mr		hi, i upgraded from dapper to eft and noticed that there are no more 686-smp kernel images, only -generic. how can i get an image the does support smp?
2006-12-14T06:46:00.000Z	Volstrup	l3mr	all kernels now support smp
2006-12-14T06:47:00.000Z	l3mr	Volstrup	hmm, trying to boot generic doesn't work, it stops when "trying to get acpiid" right at the beginning ..
2006-12-14T06:48:00.000Z	Volstrup	l3mr	what cpu do you have?
