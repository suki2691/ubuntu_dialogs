2008-04-26T19:27:00.000Z	bazhang	kevin4381	the channel or the manager
2008-04-26T19:28:00.000Z	kevin4381	bazhang	 - I'm not sure if its even installed (fresh 8.04 install) - and what I really want is to configure the effects (right now I just have desktop effects enabled)
2008-04-26T19:28:00.000Z	bazhang	kevin4381	then you need to install compizconfig-settings-manager
