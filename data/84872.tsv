2008-08-27T00:57:00.000Z	pim_		Can I make ubuntu show what it's doing at bootstrapping rather than showing me a moving bar?
2008-08-27T00:58:00.000Z	TiredWolf	pim_	yes, put "nosplash" in the kernel command line and also... uh, i don't remember the command to make it verbose. possibly "verbose".
2008-08-27T00:58:00.000Z	pim_	jrib	I'll try that, now
2008-08-27T00:58:00.000Z	TiredWolf	pim_	right, you need just get rid of quiet to make it verbose.
