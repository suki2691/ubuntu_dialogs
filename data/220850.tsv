2007-10-21T02:05:00.000Z	DG19075		I just installed the ubuntustudio-look package, but the window borderlooks more like the Gilouche theme, in black, than the snazzy Vista-like stuff under 7.04. What to do now?
2007-10-21T02:05:00.000Z	rohan	DG19075	revert the theme back to how you want it ?
2007-10-21T02:07:00.000Z	rohan	DG19075	well, using the Appearance option in Preferences menu
2007-10-21T02:10:00.000Z	rohan	DG19075	no, atleast not automatically
