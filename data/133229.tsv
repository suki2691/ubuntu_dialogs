2008-03-03T21:15:00.000Z	rabiddachshund		I want to be able to share my hdd over my network. Would I use Samba for that?
2008-03-03T21:16:00.000Z	neverblue	rabiddachshund	or nfs (network file share)
2008-03-03T21:16:00.000Z	rabiddachshund	neverblue	is there a package in synaptic that will configure it for me?
