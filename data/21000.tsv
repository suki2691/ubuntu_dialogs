2011-06-02T20:54:00.000Z	Fireblasto		Hi, I'm trying to retrieve some files off a hdd that won't boot now, to do so I'm using the live cd and a memory stick to take off the files. The problem occurs when I'm trying to copy a folder which says I don't have the required privileges to copy it, so I'm trying to use the 'su' command to do so, but I do not have the pass for it - What is the pass?

2011-06-02T20:55:00.000Z	Fireblasto	computerx	I would but I need a graphical interface to copy the files as I do not know ubuntu terminal commands
