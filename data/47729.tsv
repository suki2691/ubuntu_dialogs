2010-05-28T12:41:00.000Z	Angel-SL		hi; I installed Ubuntu 10.04 and am now trying to get colinux to boot it (on windows)
2010-05-28T12:42:00.000Z	theadmin	Angel-SL	COLinux is not like that, it's a Linux that runs inside windows, it does not boot real installs
2010-05-28T12:42:00.000Z	Angel-SL	theadmin	it does; i'd link you but I don't want to start anything
2010-05-28T12:43:00.000Z	theadmin	Angel-SL	Well, I just based my answer on what I saw on andLinux page (A ubuntu distro made to work inside windows, it says it's based on COLinux)
