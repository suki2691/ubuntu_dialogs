2010-05-27T18:46:00.000Z	coz_	Beauford	 did you try  sudo update-manager -d
2010-05-27T18:47:00.000Z	Beauford	coz_	yes, the same error happens it starts to install but then cancels saying it can't authenticate
2010-05-27T18:47:00.000Z	coz_	Beauford	 mm  ok first  in terminal   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade      see if anything needs to be fully updated first
2010-05-27T18:49:00.000Z	coz_	Beauford	  but my honest suggestion is to first back up what you need to back up and then clean install lucid from cd
