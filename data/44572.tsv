2009-11-11T01:01:00.000Z	MrStein		Argh, what is this sucky IRC support in Karmic !?  Empathy has no IRC support (it seems, correct me if I'm wrong), the configured irc: URL handler is banned on freenode, and even going thru webchat.freenode.net does not allow one to join #ubuntu directly.
2009-11-11T01:01:00.000Z	furuno	MrStein	: use Gnome-Xchat
2009-11-11T01:02:00.000Z	furuno	MrStein	: I mean, Xchat-gnome, or so
2009-11-11T01:02:00.000Z	MrStein	furuno	yes, but why no IRC client on the default install ?
