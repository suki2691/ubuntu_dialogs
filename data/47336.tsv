2009-11-10T04:36:00.000Z	ADmiral		Hi, I have a new & clean Karmic (64bit) and so far I've encountered a hanging update-manager, hanging apport while it was "gathering info for a report" on a "Kernel Error" which popped up in my system tray at some random time, and even ps was hanging so I couldn't find out which processes to kill. None of those would close, ps (in gnome-terminal) wouldn't respond to Ctrl+C and also this is reproducable. What can I do?
