2008-12-24T05:55:00.000Z	Trenter		When I try to drag a folder from a .tar.bz2 file into my /usr/games folder it says permission denied, is this normal?  I am using an admin ubuntu account.

2008-12-24T05:57:00.000Z	tyrant	Trenter	i wouldnt drag and drop a folder ti /usr/games
2008-12-24T05:59:00.000Z	tyrant	Trenter	i bet you re doing something wrong as when u install things under linux , the exe goes to usr/local/bin and pics and icons gor to /usr/share/programm and libraries to /usr/LIB so i d be careful
