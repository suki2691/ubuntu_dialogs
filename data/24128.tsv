2012-10-23T08:26:00.000Z	KM0201		is there a way to run rsync in reverse?  forinstance, i have a rsync job that backs up "data" to "databackup"(which is on another drive)... lets say the drive with "data" fails, is there a way to make rsync "reverse"... where it would essentially restore "databackup" to "Data". (hope that made sense)
