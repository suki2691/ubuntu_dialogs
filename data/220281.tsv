2008-10-24T09:40:00.000Z	gopp		hi any  one know how to send a linux cli command, e.g. uptime via AOL AIM, on a aim client on a cellphone and have it echo the result back to the phone
2008-10-24T09:41:00.000Z	gopp		for example if I aim a aim client (i.e. bot on my ubuntu box), it eco (im me) back uptime results
2008-10-24T09:41:00.000Z	gopp		is that possible
2008-10-24T09:41:00.000Z	Flannel	gopp	Its entirely possible, yes.  But I don't think anything like that currently exists.
