2006-07-09T16:03:00.000Z	Arokh		can anyone help me out with partitioning for ubuntu? I want to make the permanent switch from xp to ubuntu (no dual boot), so I imagine I can't use ntfs partitions right? whats the size limit on fat32?
2006-07-09T16:04:00.000Z	Arokh		ok whats the size limit on a ext3 partition?

2006-07-09T16:07:00.000Z	Foobal	Arokh	you could use ext2fs too, both windows and linux can read and write it perfectly
