2010-12-16T01:36:00.000Z	whooby	ZykoticK9	thx but the thing is that the server is running WLAN so I guess there is no internet connection before login ?
2010-12-16T01:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	whooby	um, if you are using nm-applet that can certainly be an issue.  sorry man, i'm no help.
2010-12-16T01:37:00.000Z	whooby	ZykoticK9	ok well I have never to do a reboot then :D :D
