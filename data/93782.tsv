2008-04-25T23:56:00.000Z	un2him	_Rambaldi_	yes, that's been my experience, too.
2008-04-26T00:00:00.000Z	un2him	_Rambaldi_	FYI, I just read on the virtualbox website that usb support is not available in the OSE version, which is what is in the repos.  GUess I'll have to wait until there is a Hardy version available for download from the virtualbox site
