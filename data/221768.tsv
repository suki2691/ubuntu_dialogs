2005-09-03T11:00:00.000Z	paulproteus	Dritz	You mean, the post-install script for upgrading from one mysql to the other that happens as part of apt-get install mysql-server ?
2005-09-03T11:02:00.000Z	Dritz	paulproteus	The script can be found at the MySQL AB site.  I need to get it working so I can stop using Windows..  As of now, I need Access for a college course.
2005-09-03T11:03:00.000Z	paulproteus	Dritz	I have no experience with it.
