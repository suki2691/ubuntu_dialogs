2010-12-27T04:12:00.000Z	josh_g		anyone here done the 10.03 -> 10.10 upgrade using the netbook edition?
2010-12-27T04:12:00.000Z	josh_g		none of the docs make it clear whether the auto-upgrade thing works with netbook ed.
2010-12-27T04:13:00.000Z	Ryu_Kurisu	josh_g	No, but I'd still advice a clean install (I've had problems with desktop upgrade 10.04>10.10)
