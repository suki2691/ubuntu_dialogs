2008-04-01T06:05:00.000Z	eddyMul	amenado	yes, qemu runs a name server. however, this name server is not resolving my vm's DNS requests (tested from fedora 8 guest and winxp guest)
2008-04-01T06:08:00.000Z	eddyMul	amenado	so, it looks like qemu's dns server is not passing the vm's dns requests to my dns server....
