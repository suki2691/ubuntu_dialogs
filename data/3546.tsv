2012-09-08T20:40:00.000Z	triyo		I did an upgrade to latest ubuntu dist ver and for some reason now when I try to install most packages, I get an 'unmet dependencies' error. I take it this has something to do with the sources.list or could it be something else?
2012-09-08T20:41:00.000Z	triyo		My sources.list looks pretty standard... (there is a 3party sec with extras.ubuntu....)
2012-09-08T20:42:00.000Z	jagginess	triyo	the update manager gui app changes sources.list
2012-09-08T20:42:00.000Z	jagginess	triyo	and updates the index too
