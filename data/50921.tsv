2010-03-03T02:16:00.000Z	kraehe	darolu	all CDs I've tryed to work failed with io/errors somewhere at the end - the ubuntu image is a bit to long

2010-03-03T02:19:00.000Z	darolu	kraehe	$ wodim dev=/dev/cdrw driveropts=burnfree,noforcespeed fs=14M speed=2 -dao -eject -overburn -v <isofile>.iso is very safe too
