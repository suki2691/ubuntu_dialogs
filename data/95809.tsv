2008-04-02T16:32:00.000Z	cpk1		so, I think I figured out what might be my problem when trying to play ogg files, everything is looking for my codecs in the wrong place, but how do I fix this?
2008-04-02T16:34:00.000Z	Scooma	cpk1	use vlc it has everything
2008-04-02T16:35:00.000Z	cpk1	Scooma	perhaps I would rather use amarok to play my audio files since it does a much better job?
