2011-01-16T04:40:00.000Z	twobitsprite		is there a way to trim down the graphics on ubuntu netbook? The new version has some animations which are very slow on my netbook and I can't figure out how to turn them off

2011-01-16T04:41:00.000Z	twobitsprite	AeSix	does it have a netbook-friendly interface
