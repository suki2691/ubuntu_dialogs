2009-06-30T17:19:00.000Z	DASPRiD		Since today is Firefox 3.5 release day: will ubuntu 9.04 update automatically to it, or do i have to install the firefox-3.5 package (which yet is still beta tho) ?
2009-06-30T17:20:00.000Z	lstarnes	DASPRiD	you'll probably have to wait for 9.04 for the released firefox 3.5 to reach the official repos
2009-06-30T17:20:00.000Z	lstarnes	DASPRiD	but it should be available in a PPA
2009-06-30T17:21:00.000Z	lstarnes	DASPRiD	I meant 9.10, sorry
