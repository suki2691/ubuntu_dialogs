2011-11-08T21:13:00.000Z	progre55		hi guys. I have a text file on a remote server with only 1G RAM, and the file is 1.2G large, and I need to edit a single line. Do not want to use "vim" for that. Any other alternatives?
2011-11-08T21:13:00.000Z	progre55		I know the line number and all, if it helps
2011-11-08T21:13:00.000Z	EvilResistance	progre55	 out of curiosity, why would the amount of RAM on the remote system matter...?
2011-11-08T21:14:00.000Z	progre55	EvilResistance	because if you use vim, it loads the file into ram
