2005-04-01T13:44:00.000Z	akk	WhoCaReS	It worked in one of my drives, but not in the one I was booting from.
2005-04-01T13:44:00.000Z	akk	WhoCaReS	The error message didn't tell me that, it implied that it couldn't find any CDROM drive.
2005-04-01T13:45:00.000Z	akk	WhoCaReS	I burned another CD from a different machine, and the problem went away.
