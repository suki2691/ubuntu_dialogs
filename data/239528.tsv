2007-04-16T08:24:00.000Z	shine		what's the need for the existence of xterm?
2007-04-16T08:25:00.000Z	shine		but why did someone make a terminal emulator, I'm thinking that's what xterm is?
2007-04-16T08:25:00.000Z	Nachtengel	shine	I like to keep my desktop manager open when I have to use command line commands... xterm is handy for that, other wise I'd have to switch from and to gdm each time I wanted to use an apt-get for example
