2009-08-06T08:04:00.000Z	KittyBoots		I am having trouble with flash videos through firefox, when I play them full screne they get slow and jittery.  What should I do?
2009-08-06T08:05:00.000Z	iMatter	KittyBoots	do you have compiz enabled?
2009-08-06T08:05:00.000Z	iMatter	KittyBoots	turn it off and see if the problem persists
2009-08-06T08:07:00.000Z	iMatter	KittyBoots	are you going to try that?, when you do tell me if it persists
