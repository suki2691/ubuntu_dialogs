2007-12-02T08:58:00.000Z	gojita		I installed the budget dedicated repo for wine, but doing a "sudo apt-cache show wine" shows wine 9.46 available.  For some reason it is going to the universal repo and doesn't see the budget dedicated offering currently posted to the site

2007-12-02T08:59:00.000Z	gojita		1) thanks for thie insight! 2) yes
2007-12-02T09:00:00.000Z	gojita	astro76	ok thanks, I am installing through that way instead then
