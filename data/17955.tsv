2012-09-21T06:40:00.000Z	Vivekananda		A couple of unrelated questions. I am running lucid lynx on my 6 yr old laptop. I just wanted to know if it is a good idea to upgrade to the next lts or not. I get the idea that it is not good to do it when very new coz of the bugs and issues. Is now a good time?
