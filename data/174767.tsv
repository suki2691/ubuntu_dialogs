2006-07-18T05:42:00.000Z	jrib	mwsmedia	maybe, but you have to ask it first :)
2006-07-18T05:43:00.000Z	mwsmedia		okay, jrib -- it has to do with attempting to connect with hamachi from one ubuntu box to another.  I get a dialog box that says the following:  Sorry, couldn't display all the contents of "Windows Network: 5.53.136.214".
2006-07-18T05:43:00.000Z	mwsmedia	jrib	 why would ubuntu think it's a windows network???
