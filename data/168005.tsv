2008-01-30T23:01:00.000Z	Pitel	donald_	2 problems... 1st: I've greyed out "device class" list in bluetooth-applet, so I can't say my computer is computer (i dont; know, maybe it;s only "cosmetic"), 2nd... how to share my computer internet connection with my mobil? I've read something about pand and bnep, but nothing works.
