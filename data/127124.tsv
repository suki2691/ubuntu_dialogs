2011-01-10T01:23:00.000Z	ericP		what's the deb source for 10.4?
2011-01-10T01:24:00.000Z	ericP		i'm hoping to apt-get install update-manager and use that to go to 10.10
2011-01-10T01:24:00.000Z	ericP		the current sources.list is for intrepid (8?), though lsb_release -a says 10.4
2011-01-10T01:26:00.000Z	vocx	ericP	what did you do in the first place? It's seems like you manually installed some software sources some releases ago, and now you have broken sources.
