2009-05-21T08:28:00.000Z	BiosElement		Somehow my root "/" folder became writable. What do I have to do to fix this?
2009-05-21T08:30:00.000Z	Barridus	BiosElement	is this in terminal or gnome
2009-05-21T08:30:00.000Z	BiosElement	Barridus	Gnome but I can test via terminal if you'd like.
2009-05-21T08:31:00.000Z	Barridus	BiosElement	i just had an idea but it's offbase if it's in gnome too
