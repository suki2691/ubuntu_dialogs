I have done so on a 1gb partition of mine now, without any problems. Now I'm trying to perform the same task on a ~170gb large partition, however, my system reboots while creating the index
2005-07-15T07:10:00.000Z	jasoncohen	dryad	that's because the maximum partition size of fat32 is around 2 GB
2005-07-15T07:10:00.000Z	dryad	jasoncohen	thats funny - people in here said that they had 500gb fat32 partitions
2005-07-15T07:14:00.000Z	jasoncohen	dryad	i guess it should work then
