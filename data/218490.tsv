2008-09-02T17:19:00.000Z	jason	genius	i think so, I have used VirtualBox without X, works well
2008-09-02T17:20:00.000Z	genius	jason	Oh, i've found outdated messages that vbox does not work from command-line?
2008-09-02T17:21:00.000Z	jason	genius	i was working with it fine, there is a virtualbox_headless client that has a rdp server so you can connect to the screen anywhere
