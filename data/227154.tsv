2005-07-21T14:44:00.000Z	Tomasu		I was thinking about trying kubuntu out.. and I was wondering how difficult is it to setup software raid? (not for boot/os, just a few disks for data.) Are there any docs specific to ubuntu and software raid?

2005-07-21T14:45:00.000Z	Tomasu	aarcane	maybe I'm just used to gentoo's awsome wiki and forums ;)
2005-07-21T14:45:00.000Z	aarcane	Tomasu	I know what you mean, I haven't found jack crap on the ubuntu wiki without a link to it
