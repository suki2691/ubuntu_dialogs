2011-09-20T06:53:00.000Z	w0_		I know this sounds trivial, but it's important to me -- I installed the equinox theme pack and my network icon (in the upper right) doesn't display the little lock for vpn connection.  anyone have any ideas? much thx
2011-09-20T06:54:00.000Z	nsq	w0_	looks like the guy who made this theme forgot this icon. maybe you could tell him this "bug"
2011-09-20T06:55:00.000Z	w0_	nsq	I'm hoping there's a setting in the theme I could change .. any links on making themes? (I'm about to google, too =)
2011-09-20T07:00:00.000Z	w0_	nsq	I just went to control center > appearance pref > customize theme > icons and tried something different.  -- tried unity-icon-theme and it looks alright guess I'll go for that for now.
