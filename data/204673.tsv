2006-01-20T06:18:00.000Z	Chris_Tucker		well, this sucks. every player i find for linux that plays aacPlus streams has an error in it somewhere... vlc.. ugly and not a nice gui at all. winamp (under wine) stops playing after a few seconds.. lamip, complains it cant open the url, and gmerlin wont compile.
2006-01-20T06:18:00.000Z	meepy	Chris_Tucker	Have you tried MPLAYER with a diffrent theme?
2006-01-20T06:19:00.000Z	Chris_Tucker	meepy	does mplayer play aacplus?
