2009-11-05T07:50:00.000Z	ErinEsurance		How do I get back my Firefox icon?  I don't see any icon for 3.5 (though there is one for 3.0..)
2009-11-05T07:51:00.000Z	chowder	ErinEsurance	right click on the launcher and set the icon. The icon should be in /use/share/icons
2009-11-05T07:52:00.000Z	ErinEsurance	chowder	 ah, alright.  Why is it not set like that by default? (I thought Fx was 3.5 in Ubuntu 9.10?)
