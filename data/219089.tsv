2008-11-11T15:51:00.000Z	rom		on my desktop computer, network manager doesn't keep my preferences
2008-11-11T15:51:00.000Z	rom		on every reboot, it "recreates" "auto eth0" and "auto eth1" and override my preferences
2008-11-11T15:52:00.000Z	Tidus	rom	that's because NetworkManager overrides /etc/network/interfaces
