2008-09-19T03:29:00.000Z	PurityOfEssence		Hello. Question: can the installer resize ntfs?
2008-09-19T03:30:00.000Z	bobertdos	PurityOfEssence	and make sure the ntfs partition doesn't get mounted while you install -- I just helped another person with that.
2008-09-19T03:31:00.000Z	PurityOfEssence	bobertdos	why would it be mounted at install?
2008-09-19T03:36:00.000Z	bobertdos	PurityOfEssence	Honestly, it shouldn't. I just helped a guy though who, for some reason, had that happen.
