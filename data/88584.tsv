2011-11-24T23:56:00.000Z	strange		hey guys my box restarted and it changed ip is there a way for nmap to scan a range of ips for a specific port being open so i can find my box back?
2011-11-24T23:57:00.000Z	strange		or maybe a script to try and wget a specific file from a list of ips to see if its there?
2011-11-24T23:57:00.000Z	strange		either would work
2011-11-24T23:58:00.000Z	benignbala	strange	for a range of IPs do nmap  1.2.3.1-10. Will scan 1.2.3.1 to 1.2.3.10
