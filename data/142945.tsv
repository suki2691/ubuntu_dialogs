2010-03-23T10:56:00.000Z	abhinav	bullgard	it is the wallpaper. not by nautilus
2010-03-23T10:58:00.000Z	bullgard	abhinav	Your answer is wrong. '~$ which wallpaper' does not produce any output.
2010-03-23T10:58:00.000Z	abhinav	bullgard	it is "executed" by the desktop manager. Not nautilus. That's what I meant.
