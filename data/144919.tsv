2007-09-23T10:33:00.000Z	verb3k	iceslice	state your problem and someone may help you
2007-09-23T10:36:00.000Z	verb3k	iceslice	same here , but I guess as soon as the folder opens you won't have that "slowness" issue
2007-09-23T10:38:00.000Z	verb3k	iceslice	maybe some professionals answer you here , I really don't know ( don't use it much)
