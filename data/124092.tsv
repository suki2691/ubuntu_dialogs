2008-08-14T06:21:00.000Z	Daisuke_Laptop	daffu	that's how the default kernel is set up, if you find you need more configurability, you might be better suited to a distro tailored toward customization
2008-08-14T06:22:00.000Z	Daisuke_Laptop	daffu	nice attitude you've got there
2008-08-14T06:23:00.000Z	Daisuke_Laptop	daffu	that would be a question better left for the devs.  i've got no idea why it isn't there or even what it is
