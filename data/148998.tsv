2008-07-03T00:53:00.000Z	_boto		what are the conditions to get an open-source package hosted by ubuntu update server?
2008-07-03T00:54:00.000Z	_boto		there is an open-source software which uses some non-open-source dependencies
2008-07-03T00:55:00.000Z	_boto		ah, thanks
2008-07-03T00:55:00.000Z	unop	_boto	sure - things like the nvdia and ati blobs are not open-source
