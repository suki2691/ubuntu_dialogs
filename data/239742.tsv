Well, I quickly decided that thing had to go, and used the Synaptic Package Manager to uninstall it and install Gnome-Nautilus-Metacity. I have a few minor problems.
2008-03-23T00:47:00.000Z	Someone7		For one, the new XChat is annoying. I want to see a list of users in the channel on the right side, but I can't see you. Can anyone tell me a quick fix?
2008-03-23T00:47:00.000Z	Someone7		Two: I have to put "Metacity &" in a terminal window to get the windows manager working after a reboot. Is there a permanent solution?
