Is there a way I can remove this encryption stuff from the drive?  It seems to only show as 7.66gb now rather than 8gb like it used to.  Also whenever i put the disk in linux it complains about not authoriized when i try to mount it or use disk utility on it etc.
2010-05-14T15:51:00.000Z	jcrawford		i would like to get rid of the encrypted volume so that i can try this installation again

2010-05-14T15:52:00.000Z	jcrawford	hmw	that does not work i tried that.
