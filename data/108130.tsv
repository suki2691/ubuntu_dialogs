2009-05-12T04:41:00.000Z	Muelli	multi_io	simple: You have to boot the CD anyway. So if the installer doesn't support it, you can create your LVM on the fly :)
2009-05-12T04:46:00.000Z	multi_io	Muelli	but then the installer can at leat recognize the LVM volumes and install on them?
2009-05-12T04:46:00.000Z	Muelli	multi_io	sure
