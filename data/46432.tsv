2009-10-28T02:41:00.000Z	Slart	losha	nah.. wikipedia is nice but we don't want this channel to become one of those channels where every question is answered by "bah.. just google it"

2009-10-28T02:43:00.000Z	losha	Slart	well, I know what you mean. But sometimes, 'googling it' really *is* the right answer...
