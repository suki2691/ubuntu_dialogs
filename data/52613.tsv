2009-08-31T17:35:00.000Z	TheStarLion	nibbler_	Yes, because this laptop is connected to it the same way as the desktop pc with the issue
2009-08-31T17:37:00.000Z	nibbler_	TheStarLion	did you change cable/switchport?
2009-08-31T17:38:00.000Z	TheStarLion	nibbler_	yes, tried both cables available, and all four ports on the router, all work perfectly on the laptop, just not the desktop pc
