2005-07-07T09:35:00.000Z	Nebular		any ideas as to why kernel-source-2.6.9 isn't showing up in apt?
2005-07-07T09:36:00.000Z	Nebular		I'm running hoary
2005-07-07T09:37:00.000Z	Nebular		only one that shows up is kernel-source-2.4.27
2005-07-07T09:38:00.000Z	reka	Nebular	what about linux-source-2.6.10?  (hoary runs the .10 kernel by default)
