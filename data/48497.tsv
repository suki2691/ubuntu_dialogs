2010-11-26T04:09:00.000Z	d-eee	ZykoticK9	 hmm, let me try that
2010-11-26T04:24:00.000Z	d-eee	ZykoticK9	didn't work.  what's weird is that among the files they start with .z01 and end with .zip
2010-11-26T04:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	d-eee	sorry i don't have any other suggestions - are you sure you got the order right?  I imagine it would start with the .zip then .z01 .z02 etc.
