2005-07-01T11:34:00.000Z	budluva		can i install ubuntu over top of my current debian sarge install??? i have my / on one disk, and my /home and /storage each on other disks, i shouldnt have a problem installing ubuntu on my / after formatting right?
2005-07-01T11:35:00.000Z	budluva		but i can still keep my /home and /storage correct?
2005-07-01T11:35:00.000Z	sobersabre	budluva	i have upgraded ubuntu over sarge before it was stable.
