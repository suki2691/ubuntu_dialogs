2010-10-23T23:09:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	Hrimfaxi	Not sure whether to get that Dell MX-11 netbook or an Android phone ?
2010-10-23T23:11:00.000Z	Hrimfaxi	Quantum_Ion	- well, it really depends on what you use it for..if you're mainly in to social networking and stuff, the android phone would be better imo
