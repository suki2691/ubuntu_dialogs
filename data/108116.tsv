2008-01-26T23:29:00.000Z	tolecnal		this just keeps on getting stranger and stranger. _everything_ works as it should when I boot into recovery, but when I boot into the normal kernel everything seems to start okay, including KDM. but once I log in, the session just hangs. when I go into a console, and try to use anything using sudo or requiring super user rights, it just hangs. and dmesg, syslog nor anything else tells me why it fails and hangs. any suggestions?

2008-01-26T23:31:00.000Z	tolecnal	DRebellion	just did, and I just noticed that it reports my user as uid 0, not 1000 as it should
2008-01-26T23:32:00.000Z	tolecnal	DRebellion	though I have absolutely no clue why it reports my user as uid 0 instead of 1000
