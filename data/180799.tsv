2006-10-02T13:40:00.000Z	yigal		hi - who can help me with ICQ installing on Ubuntu?
2006-10-02T13:41:00.000Z	yigal		GAIM is not good for my target. The PC goes to a youth club where registering account is not a good idea. I need "qick usage"
2006-10-02T13:42:00.000Z	yigal		not with XP for example... are you saying ICQ cant work on Ubuntu same why as with XP?
