2008-07-06T18:49:00.000Z	wweasel		Quick advice: What partition type can be mounted R/W in Linux and in OS X, and can carry large (>2GB) files (therefore not FAT32)?
2008-07-06T18:50:00.000Z	wweasel		Wait, only needs to be writable in Linux. Can be RO in OSX
2008-07-06T18:50:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	wweasel	Linux can red/write HFS, not sure how good the support is though
2008-07-06T18:51:00.000Z	wweasel	LSD|Ninja	I'll give it a try!
