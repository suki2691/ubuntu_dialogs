2011-09-13T21:21:00.000Z	apus		how can one turn off the ufw firewall in ubuntu?
2011-09-13T21:22:00.000Z	apus		also removing it from bootup would be nice
2011-09-13T21:24:00.000Z	recon69_lap	apus	, have you tried 'sudo ufw disable'
2011-09-13T21:24:00.000Z	apus	recon69_lap	okay that will disable it but i guess not remove it from boot runlevels ... ?
