2010-03-13T03:23:00.000Z	EPAstor	mezquitale	So you want grub installed, but not linux?
2010-03-13T03:24:00.000Z	mezquitale	EPAstor	 I'll install ubuntu later, right now I restored my windows partition to a different drive and want to boot up to windows
2010-03-13T03:26:00.000Z	EPAstor	mezquitale	makes sense. Sorry, was just curious. Afraid I don't know how to install grub without a linux partition around... I believe it needs a /boot partition it can read, though I could be wrong.
