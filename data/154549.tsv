2007-06-17T16:08:00.000Z	Steffen		Can someone explain to me, how to set a different password to the root account ? (Different from my user's that is)
2007-06-17T16:09:00.000Z	Steffen		i'll try that, just a sec
2007-06-17T16:10:00.000Z	Steffen		i actually meant the password for sudo'ing, I guess I should had formulated it differently
