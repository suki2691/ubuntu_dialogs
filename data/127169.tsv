2008-09-20T07:36:00.000Z	magicrobotmonkey	ganymede	yea, but i was wondering if there's a gui way to do it
2008-09-20T07:36:00.000Z	ganymede	magicrobotmonkey	i was always under the impression that when you visit the Trash place, then it aggregates all the .Trash's in all mounted partitions, but i could be wron
2008-09-20T07:37:00.000Z	magicrobotmonkey	ganymede	yea i wondered if it did that, but i tried it, to no avail
