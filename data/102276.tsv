2009-01-18T14:25:00.000Z	rww	AtomX1211	KDE, XFCE.... there's a whole bunch.
2009-01-18T14:26:00.000Z	rww	AtomX1211	for KDE and Xfce, install kubuntu-desktop and xubuntu-desktop, respectively
2009-01-18T14:27:00.000Z	rww	AtomX1211	you can install both ubuntu-desktop and kubuntu-desktop on the same computer.
