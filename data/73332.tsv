2012-08-12T04:38:00.000Z	dj_segfault		How does SublimeText2 compare to, say, JEdit?
2012-08-12T04:39:00.000Z	Debolaz	dj_segfault	Never tried jedit.
2012-08-12T04:40:00.000Z	Debolaz	dj_segfault	Given that jedit is written in Java, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that sublime is probably more snappy. :)
2012-08-12T04:41:00.000Z	dj_segfault	Debolaz	That's a safe assumption, yes.
