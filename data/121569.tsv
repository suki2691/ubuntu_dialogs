2010-01-03T15:18:00.000Z	ahughes		is it easier (i.e. me == idiot and looking for idiot proof) to run the live cd, and use gpart to create dual boot partitions or use the install partitioning... I am having some trouble with the "install" "manually create partitions". Says I have no root partitions
2010-01-03T15:18:00.000Z	faileas	ahughes	you prolly need to set a partition as root
2010-01-03T15:18:00.000Z	ahughes	faileas	good advice... not helpful tho
2010-01-03T15:19:00.000Z	faileas	ahughes	well i think you can set a mountpoint when you install
