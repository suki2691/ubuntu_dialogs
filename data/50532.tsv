2010-02-26T06:25:00.000Z	mistere357		I have an Ubuntu 6.06 LTS server that I need to upgrade to 8.04 LTS.  It's a colo server so I cannot see a GUI.  The instructions (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardyUpgrades ) say to install "update-manager-core" and then run it from a terminal.  If I do that will it prompt me before actually making the changes?
