2009-05-17T18:29:00.000Z	leocosca		hello, I have installed ubuntu for the first time, my primary need is powerpoint but openoffice 3.0.1 is way too slow. How could I downgrade it to 2.x?
2009-05-17T18:30:00.000Z	compengi	leocosca	go to system>preferences>synaptics ; search for openoffice and see if you could find any older version of it, if found, unmark your 3.0.1 and check the other one
2009-05-17T18:31:00.000Z	leocosca	compengi	checking...
2009-05-17T18:38:00.000Z	leocosca	compengi	unfortunately, there's no other version. All I found was jaunty and nothing else. So, this means I have to get my hands dirty with apt. Could you give me any guidance to downgrade openoffice? (maybe I should try with an older release of ubuntu or maybe just another distro).
