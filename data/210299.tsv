2008-08-27T02:06:00.000Z	phoenix_	ScheissDrogen	I cd's to /usr/src and ran the drivers, they started up and said I appear to be running X and to exit out of it before installing
2008-08-27T02:07:00.000Z	phoenix_	ScheissDrogen	Thats what I cannot do, Exiting X to terminal won't work. It hangs. I can only load the terminal within X from the login menu
2008-08-27T02:10:00.000Z	phoenix_	ScheissDrogen	/etc/init.d/gdm stop does not work, It hangs on a black screen and where it us supposed to come up with a login it doesn;t, it sits there stuck
