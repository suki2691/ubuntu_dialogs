2008-12-30T01:03:00.000Z	max9ai		I have install i386 ubuntu on my core2duo just because I was scared than amd64 will not work. Was I right?

2008-12-30T01:04:00.000Z	Flannel	max9ai	Of course, running 32bits isn't the end of the world either
2008-12-30T01:05:00.000Z	Flannel	max9ai	They're both fine choices for the processor. The question is: Do you want a 32bit OS or a 64bit OS?
