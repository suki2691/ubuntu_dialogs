2009-08-07T01:43:00.000Z	Slart	ericdb	ahh.. my bad.. I have no idea what is responsible for clearing up /tmp .. don't think I've seen anything in the crontab at least
2009-08-07T01:47:00.000Z	Slart	ericdb	why not do your work related stuff in /tmp2 right away.. delete it yourself.. or don't.. no need to rewrite kernel stuff =)
2009-08-07T01:47:00.000Z	Slart	ericdb	as you yourself say.. saving stuff in /tmp is not very reliable
