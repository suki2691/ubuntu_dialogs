2007-03-20T10:37:00.000Z	marcus__		question: I've always been running debian but since I'm spreading out linux to my relatives I think it might be good changing everything to ubuntu since it's got a little more user friendly wiki etc, anyway, I never really understood if it's possible to have something alike "stable" in sources.list to that it'll use all the new soft from stable releases, is this possible?

2007-03-20T10:44:00.000Z	marcus__	Pollywog	noway :) (thx for tips anyway), still, I've heard that running unstable is possible, thus this is much more unstable than debian unstable.. part of the reason walking over to ubuntu is that I don't really like the stable releases of debian...
