2006-08-12T05:01:00.000Z	snail		i've already installed ubuntu on a box, but i suspect that I'm not using the best kernel for my hardware. how do I go about introspecting the hadrware and selecting a suitable kernel? This is an x86 (and maybe dual core/ dual cpu)

2006-08-12T05:03:00.000Z	snail	TheGateKeeper	will do
2006-08-12T05:04:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	snail	do you want to customise & optimise your system?
