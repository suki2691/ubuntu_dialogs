2006-03-18T15:15:00.000Z	skt		Hello all! Can someone tell me how to enable NFS share using the "Shared Folder" tool? Now there is just SMB available..
2006-03-18T15:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	skt	you need to configure NFS first I'd say
2006-03-18T15:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	skt	when NFS is configured, it appears as an option in the dialogue
2006-03-18T15:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	skt	just tried it here :) (I configure nfs the CLI and edit way, so I've never needed to use it)
