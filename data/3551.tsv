2012-06-12T10:00:00.000Z	Adonis		i tried to check grub and it says "unsupported RAID level :255.
2012-06-12T10:01:00.000Z	jagginess	Adonis	you using raid?
2012-06-12T10:01:00.000Z	jagginess	Adonis	you should use no less than grub2
2012-06-12T10:02:00.000Z	jagginess	Adonis	raid is an advanced topic, it's support isn't available with the desktop iso, but rather the server iso..
