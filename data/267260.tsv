2009-08-18T18:19:00.000Z	cairo__		is there a way to find out how many ram modules i have in my notebook without opening it?
2009-08-18T18:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cairo__	 i noticed that  the 'parted magic' live cd, and (or) 'System rescue' Live cd (both i got today from the disrtowatch.com site) have some extensive 'what hardware do i have' tools.
2009-08-18T18:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cairo__	 not sure what the tools names were.. or if they are in the ubuntu repos.
