2011-12-03T08:44:00.000Z	Vosko		yes, it recognizes the usb device as well in bios, the usb stick is bootable
2011-12-03T08:45:00.000Z	usr13	Vosko	Did you try hitting F12 for boot menu?  (Or what ever F-Key it says?)
2011-12-03T08:46:00.000Z	usr13	Vosko	In order to do pxe boot you need to set up a pxe server and set your router up to point pxe boots to it.
