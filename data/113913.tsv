2008-09-07T22:39:00.000Z	mizipzor		making a shortcut with the command "cd /wanted/work/dir && bin-to-execute" fails, apparently, there is some problem with cd... but running the exact same line in konsole work as expected
2008-09-07T22:41:00.000Z	mizipzor		whats the gnome variant of konsole? if there is such thing
