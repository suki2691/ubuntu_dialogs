2007-08-18T14:51:00.000Z	WheelDweller		Anyone got time to 'slap the idiot'?  I'm setting up apache(1) with PHP and rendering just doesn't want to work...it must be something simple- fresh install, and all. Been Googling an hour...
2007-08-18T14:53:00.000Z	javaJake	WheelDweller	did you modify your APache config to accept PHP?
2007-08-18T14:54:00.000Z	javaJake	WheelDweller	#php (or #apache as a last resort)
2007-08-18T14:54:00.000Z	javaJake	WheelDweller	they will know for sure
