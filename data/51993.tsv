2012-05-19T12:28:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Intrepd	do you have a support question?
2012-05-19T12:30:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Intrepd	it's no hard, I used to use it all the time, what issue were you having with it (wouldn't open, too complicated, etc)?
2012-05-19T12:31:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	Intrepd	ubuntu does not use exe installers, please open the "software center" and search for "vncviewer" then click "install"
