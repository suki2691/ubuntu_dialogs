2007-08-04T15:34:00.000Z	fholmes		I have dapper drake installed on my machine and I am upgrading to Edgy.  Would it be a big deal to make a larger jump to 7.04?

2007-08-04T15:35:00.000Z	fholmes	lockd	 So do you think just doing a apt-get dist-upgrade to edgy, then right to feisty would work?  Or should I apt-get upgrade as well before I upgrade to Feisty?
