2011-08-14T22:57:00.000Z	SoloGaijin		I am getting an error starting radvd: IPv6 forwarding seems to be disabled. - however I added the line: net.ipv6.conf.default.forwarding=1 in /etc/sysctl.conf as the tutorial stated
2011-08-14T22:58:00.000Z	SoloGaijin		setting up radvd and doing radvd restart
2011-08-14T23:00:00.000Z	quatrox	SoloGaijin	try echo "1" >/proc/sys/net/ipv6/ip_forwarding
