2009-02-23T03:12:00.000Z	Tommasa		I'm trying to cp -a my /home directory to a USB drive with pv so that I know it's working properly, but I can't seem to figure out how to make it work. It copies properly, but pv just sits there.   Can someone tell what the right syntax would be to do that?

2009-02-23T03:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	Tommasa	use two tar commands... something like Â« tar cf - /home/$USER | pv | (cd /media/disk && tar xBf -)
