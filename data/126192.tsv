2007-08-03T12:31:00.000Z	lunchbox_		ive got a really stupid question..  anyone who has used mIRC knows that theres a user list for each channel on the channel screen
2007-08-03T12:32:00.000Z	lunchbox_		is there a way to get that to happen in xchat?
2007-08-03T12:32:00.000Z	lunchbox_		and keep it open (not clicking the 1152 users button)
2007-08-03T12:32:00.000Z	tcpdump	lunchbox_	if you find a way, let me know.
