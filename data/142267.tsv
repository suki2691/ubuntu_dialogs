2008-04-03T21:14:00.000Z	Who_	evand	Yes, I do: I have wubi seemingly swapping like mad for about four hours after the first time I have tried to boot into Xubuntu. I can see the heron BG but can't move the mouse or get to VT1 with ctrl+alt+F1 - both of those _could_ be driver/keymap issues though. I want to know what the kindest way to end it is, or whether I should keep hoping or leave it on. This is  a P2 300Mhz with 128mb ram.
