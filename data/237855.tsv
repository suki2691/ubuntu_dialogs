2006-06-15T07:43:00.000Z	Draconicus		Is my problem so bizarre and retarded that nobody will help me, or am I just being ignored because I'm not interesting enough?!
2006-06-15T07:43:00.000Z	Draconicus		This has never happened before. When I try to access any site that uses javascript, X crashes. I'm running PPC Ubuntu Breezy. Please help.
2006-06-15T07:43:00.000Z	Draconicus		It might be flash, but I don't think the hotmail or yahoo mail pages have flash.
2006-06-15T07:43:00.000Z	anto9us	Draconicus	is it just x that crashes can you alf+f1 to a terminal?
