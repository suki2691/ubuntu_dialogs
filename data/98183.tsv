2008-03-15T19:39:00.000Z	Ohm		Hey everybody, I've got a really bad problem. Since it might be tough to solve and there's alot of info on it, I wrote a summary of it at http://owner.rnachoctb.org/error.txt
2008-03-15T19:39:00.000Z	Ohm		please help me :/
2008-03-15T19:40:00.000Z	Ohm		summing up the problem in one line would probably be: "oh god only a tenth of my gui apps still work"
2008-03-15T19:41:00.000Z	hischild_	Ohm	sounds like a fairly serious problem indeed. It would appear that one or more directories/applications have been damaged and can't start. However, i'm not sure how to do a file system check under ubuntu ..
