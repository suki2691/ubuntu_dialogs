2006-08-10T09:17:00.000Z	garryF		I love it when I google to answer other people's problems. People think I'm an expert. j/k Seriously, googling is best done by the questioner. It makes the answer stick better and they are more inclined to google. However out dated, info can be a problem.

2006-08-10T09:19:00.000Z	garryF	Kyral_Laptop	Hehe. Yep. I kind of don't blame some who do come here to ask after being stung by finding documentation in the wrong place. :)
