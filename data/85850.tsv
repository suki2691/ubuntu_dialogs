2008-09-14T11:41:00.000Z	bobertdos	starn	cp is for copying pretty much anything, actually.
2008-09-14T11:41:00.000Z	starn	bobertdos	ok.. soo what does omitting directory mean? for it is not copying the files..
2008-09-14T11:43:00.000Z	bobertdos	starn	I didn't even know that was valid, but if it is, it probably means "copy target to current directory."
