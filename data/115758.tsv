2007-10-21T01:05:00.000Z	hhaamu		I'm trying to figure out gnome. I think the last time I seriously used it was at gnome 1.4.
2007-10-21T01:05:00.000Z	tritium	hhaamu	it's easy -- not much to figure out
2007-10-21T01:06:00.000Z	hhaamu		why does the "put display to sleep when inactive for" slider in power management have the minimum value of 11 minutes?
2007-10-21T01:07:00.000Z	hhaamu	tritium	I sort of agree, but I keep mistaking the new menu bar as the application menu bar.
