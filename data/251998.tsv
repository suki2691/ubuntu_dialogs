2006-09-11T11:17:00.000Z	wabbit		 Hi All!! I got a HP dv 5000 laptop with an Altec Lansing Sound card which I not sure how to configure. By default sound works on the Dapper distribution but the volume is very poor. alsamixer and the gui volume controler don't help. Any Ideas??

2006-09-11T11:18:00.000Z	wabbit	paradizelost	pcm is not up but the sound control laptop buttons work
2006-09-11T11:19:00.000Z	eyequeue	wabbit	raise pcm
