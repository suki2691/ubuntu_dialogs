2012-11-09T02:22:00.000Z	thelinux	devish	What suggestions? ;) I've been using virtual box, I too use low memory consumption, otherwise my primary OS will run slow since I only have 1 GB RAM
2012-11-09T02:24:00.000Z	devish	thelinux	i framed incorrectly , vmware vs virtual box
2012-11-09T02:25:00.000Z	thelinux	devish	Well I think Virtual Box is just fine, vmware costs money, and I don't there are major differences.
