2008-10-14T10:31:00.000Z	xjohnthomasx		Agent_bob,  hi there, i have a very difficult problem -- gnome doesn't seem to store my wireless password settings, and it thus keeps me from being able to connect to any encrypted/secured wireless network.. i can connect to my network fine when it's unsecured, and my laptop which is running ubuntu 7.10 can connect to my wireless network  fine even when it's secured, but this desktop with 8.04 ubuntu just won't!! please help!!??
