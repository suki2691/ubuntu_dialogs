2008-06-22T18:59:00.000Z	tillux	Flynsarmy	which games, which soundcard, which distro, which soundserver/client ?
2008-06-22T19:00:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	tillux	hardy, all games (jedi academy 2 in wine, lbreakout2 and supertux2 regular gnome games). not sure how to find out that other info
2008-06-22T19:00:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	tillux	Would running VirtualBox have anything to do with it?
