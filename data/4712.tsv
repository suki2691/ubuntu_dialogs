2012-03-11T11:51:00.000Z	blendedbychris	sacarlson	indeedâ€¦ i guess a backport is due
2012-03-11T11:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	blendedbychris	that seems to be the only option if you want to run on lucid
2012-03-11T12:15:00.000Z	blendedbychris	sacarlson	is there an easier way to backport rather than compiling?
