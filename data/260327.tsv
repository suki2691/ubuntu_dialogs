2009-06-01T07:28:00.000Z	agonnerman		I am working on getting into sysadmin work.  Currently work for a startup, but not as a sysadmin (yet).  Would like to learn a programming language to support work.  Office uses Ruby.  I've been learning a different object-oriented language.  Is Ruby used at all by the Linux crowd for anything other than web dev work?
2009-06-01T07:29:00.000Z	agonnerman		colonelqubitl: so nobody's going to sneer at me for using it over some other language?  At least, not for the most part among linux geeks?
