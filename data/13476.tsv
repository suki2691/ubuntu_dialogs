2011-06-08T23:25:00.000Z	klownish		Im having an issue with my display.  I have a nvidia gtx 260 with a vga resolution max of 2048x1536 , and my tv that its connected to has a max of 1,280 Ã— 1,024, but 1280 x 1024 is not listed in my nvidia display settings.  I've tried usign xrandr to set the display and it is not working, says "configure crtc 0 failed"  anyone have any ideas?
