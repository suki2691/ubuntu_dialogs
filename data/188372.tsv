2007-04-26T07:52:00.000Z	tsikis		i am searching some time now on a way to get rid of some packages not needed for me like evolution and totem but the only thing i find is that i will end up with broken packages any ideas or howtos?
2007-04-26T07:52:00.000Z	mc44	tsikis	why would you end up with broken packages?
2007-04-26T07:55:00.000Z	mc44	tsikis	so? ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage
2007-04-26T07:55:00.000Z	mc44	tsikis	it wont matter if you remove it
