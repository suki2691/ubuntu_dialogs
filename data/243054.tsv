2005-11-03T11:50:00.000Z	jbc		I've just installed 5.10, and I can't run any of the privileged apps (eg gnome-app-install) from the desktop - it comes back with 'wrong password for root'
2005-11-03T11:50:00.000Z	jbc		the password is correct - I can su and login from the console with it
2005-11-03T11:50:00.000Z	jldugger	jbc	use your password
