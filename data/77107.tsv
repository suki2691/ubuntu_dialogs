2008-10-17T06:47:00.000Z	Randal1		I have a trendnet USB wireless device and i was wondering if someone could help me configure it using terminal. the wiki said that the person had problems doing it through nm-applet i've spent a couple of hours and ran what it said but it didn't connect wirelessly?
2008-10-17T06:48:00.000Z	craigbass1976	Randal1	does the device work in windows?
2008-10-17T06:48:00.000Z	Randal1		yes
2008-10-17T06:49:00.000Z	Randal1	craigbass1976	it already shows up in my nm-applet just not sure on how to configure it
