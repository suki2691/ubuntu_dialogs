2008-04-06T04:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	yuri__	 bash basics man.. command > file.txt
2008-04-06T04:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	yuri__	 the | goes from one Process/command to another ie: ls | sort
2008-04-06T04:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	yuri__	 if you want to see and pipe the  output use the tee command. ls | tee > foo.txt
