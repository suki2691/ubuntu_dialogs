2008-11-01T05:21:00.000Z	partisan11		I just got Proxomitron working good via Wine on intrepid. Started experimenting with this kind of proxy filter to deal with ads (on Galeon or Epiphany). Seems like Firefox, Opera, Konqueror already have adequate filters (esp. Firefox). Is Proxomitron more trouble than it's worth in linux?
2008-11-01T05:22:00.000Z	ConstantineXVI	partisan11	have you looked into privoxy yet?
2008-11-01T05:22:00.000Z	ConstantineXVI	partisan11	it'
2008-11-01T05:22:00.000Z	ConstantineXVI	partisan11	privoxy does the same thing, and it's linux native as well
