2009-07-25T03:03:00.000Z	bkevan	koliz	why you panic'ing?
2009-07-25T03:03:00.000Z	koliz	bkevan	cause the netbook froze, and now the wlan interface is gone. that scares the shit out of a ordinary human beeing like myself :)
2009-07-25T03:04:00.000Z	bkevan	koliz	what does messages and dmesg say regarding the card? but I agree with darrylm.. sounds liek it isn't re-initiated when it comes back from sleep mode or hibernation
2009-07-25T03:09:00.000Z	koliz	bkevan	dmesg gives me a hell of a output. Is there some way I could minimilize the output to see "just what i need to see"? Or what should I look after here?
