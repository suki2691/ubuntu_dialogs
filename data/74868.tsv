2008-11-08T06:49:00.000Z	OpenVirus		where might I find information on encoding formats for dvds?
2008-11-08T06:50:00.000Z	OpenVirus		nice No-Neck do you know if it encodes it to work on xbox 360
2008-11-08T06:51:00.000Z	No-Neck	OpenVirus	it will encode most video files such as xvid to standard DVD format, I suppose this would be totally supported by an Xbox but I don't have one so I don't know, perhaps it even has more advancec format support? o.O
2008-11-08T06:52:00.000Z	OpenVirus	No-Neck	 ok thanks :)
