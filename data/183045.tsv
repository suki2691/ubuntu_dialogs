2007-04-26T13:36:00.000Z	Pelo	newbieguy	 you mean the grub menu ?
2007-04-26T13:40:00.000Z	Pelo	newbieguy	oh, you mean  on the install cd ?  well basicaly , the bottem line is various options for language keyboard, screenrez,    the  other menu are  the live cd which you can use to try out and installf rom,   then ther is the oem install wich basicaly lets you install without setting a password so computer stores can do it and let the user then setup is own and there is the cd integrity check which verifies that the cd isn't damanged
