2005-11-10T17:50:00.000Z	zubunt		I need help. I switched from fglrx drivers to gpld ati drivers from xorg. 3d acceleration isn't working.
2005-11-10T17:50:00.000Z	trappist	zubunt	3d accel will not work with the oss drivers.
2005-11-10T17:51:00.000Z	trappist	zubunt	the whole point of using the fglrx drivers is to make 3d accel work
