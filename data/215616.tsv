2008-10-22T01:59:00.000Z	Wintervenom		I think what I am wanting to turn off is called "jack sense," but I can't find anything that says how to turn it off.

2008-10-22T02:01:00.000Z	soundray	Wintervenom	ah, so you do have software jack sense. Then it would be a matter of the Linux driver supporting it. In other words, don't get your hopes up...
