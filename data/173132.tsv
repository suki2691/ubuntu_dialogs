2006-09-26T15:23:00.000Z	fallingdutch	Ackeubu_	have a look at update-initramfs
2006-09-26T15:49:00.000Z	Ackeubu_	fallingdutch	i tried  sudo  update-initramfs -u /boot/initrd.img-2.6.17-9-386. but i get an error: /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/functions: line 84: [: /Program: binary operator expected
