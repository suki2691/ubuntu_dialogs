2008-03-19T05:28:00.000Z	soldats	aks_	i know a way to make it sleep at the appropriate time but i have no experience with thte hibernation as i never or ever will use it.
2008-03-19T05:28:00.000Z	aks_	soldats	any particular reason to stay away from it?
2008-03-19T05:30:00.000Z	soldats	aks_	i always hear it doesnt work properly for hibernation, also from experience the basic gui it has is a little retarded. i use xorg.conf to set sleep time, but doing that will make it only sleep after a set time no matter what unless you explicitly tell it to sleep
