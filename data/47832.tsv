2011-10-09T21:16:00.000Z	feisar		I'd like to install ubuntu-desktop on a server (so I have to login screen and desktop) but I don't want all the office and email stuff, can I use apt-get install ubuntu-desktop --without-recommends?
2011-10-09T21:16:00.000Z	theadmin	feisar	Just apt-get install gnome

2011-10-09T21:19:00.000Z	feisar	theadmin	thanks, I think that's the way I'll go
