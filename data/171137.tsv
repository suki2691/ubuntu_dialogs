2006-08-13T10:47:00.000Z	sahasrara		ok isn't this torrent thing risky? getting files from strangers, how do i know my ubuntu is safe?
2006-08-13T10:47:00.000Z	EriK	sahasrara	 I believe torrent compares against known good md5 hashes, so you should be okay
2006-08-13T10:48:00.000Z	sahasrara	EriK	oh ok
