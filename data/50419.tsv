2009-08-15T05:36:00.000Z	Dacvak		Please help me. Every time I try to install Ubuntu 9.04 64-Bit on my new laptop, it gives me an error in installation. It says there is an error in copying the data or something. I've tried reburning it (on the slowest settings, on both CD and DVD) and it's not working. What can I do?
