2009-09-07T20:30:00.000Z	Keiffer		Hi. Anyone knows how could I make Transmission start before the login screen? And start downloading and uploading. Is this possible?
2009-09-07T20:30:00.000Z	Keiffer		I have multiple users on the pc and I want that transmission to be open no matter what.
2009-09-07T20:31:00.000Z	kd	Keiffer	logically anything tht u do is loaded as a session, I do not think it can continue at pre-login
2009-09-07T20:32:00.000Z	Keiffer	kd	sshd does that. and i was thinkind if transmission could do it
