2010-02-18T21:00:00.000Z	kurtjx		is there a keyboard shortcut to cycle through the windows of the same application (i.e. document viewer has several papers open i just want to go thru these not the FF windows etc - not alt+tab)
2010-02-18T21:01:00.000Z	cannam	kurtjx	depends on the application, but in firefox and gnome terminal it's ctrl+pgup/pgdn
2010-02-18T21:04:00.000Z	cannam	kurtjx	is that evince? I s'pose the point is it's an application shortcut, rather than a wm thing -- so could be anything (or nothing)
