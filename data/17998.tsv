2011-02-23T10:15:00.000Z	Senjai	Logan_WP	perhaps you would know how to answer my previous question?
2011-02-23T10:15:00.000Z	Senjai	Logan_WP	you just joined so I'll repeate it
2011-02-23T10:17:00.000Z	Senjai	Logan_WP	do you know how to mount a remote filesystem locally? (The GUI does this via Places -> Connect To Server) I'm looking for the command line equivalent in order to set up a bash script
