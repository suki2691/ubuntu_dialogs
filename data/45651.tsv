2009-10-15T18:15:00.000Z	RanDom33		I have been trying to run warsow on my laptop with ubuntu, I do not believe my video card is using the best drivers that it can use, as the game will not even run. I have an ati x1200 series card. I had the same problem with jaunty, and even did the suggested rollback fix on intrepid. I am on the koala beta now.

2009-10-15T18:17:00.000Z	RanDom33	detrate	and they will tell me to ask here about getting the drivers setup right
2009-10-15T18:17:00.000Z	detrate	RanDom33	or give you a flag to pass the binary file
