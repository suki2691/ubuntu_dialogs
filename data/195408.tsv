2008-07-30T23:34:00.000Z	kitche	bazz	maybe your mouse is moving a tad
2008-07-30T23:35:00.000Z	bazz	kitche	would that wake it up?  it's a good theory, i'm gonna test it out, brb
2008-07-30T23:37:00.000Z	bazz	kitche	don't think that was it.  unplugged my external mouse and closed the lid and same thing
