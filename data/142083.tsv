2007-05-23T11:12:00.000Z	C_Kode	New-Bie	It's still a software raid thats controlled by the Windows driver.  They can still work though (providing you have a linux driver for the raid.)  Though when I had a dual boot, both OSs were on a single 120GB drive and they shared the RAID0 as an extra data partition
