2010-11-02T08:41:00.000Z	kadgar		Hi, I installed ubuntu 10.10 on an external hard drive using macbook pro. I used super grub2 disk and booted in, for some reason I have to hold down enter when I select use usb *experimental and then it shows the ubuntu install. However, it freezes when I see the ubuntu install so I can't boot in :( anyone have any ideas???
