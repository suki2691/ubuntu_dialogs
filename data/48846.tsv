2010-08-25T17:56:00.000Z	Pici	jzacsh	What version of Ubuntu are you using?
2010-08-25T17:58:00.000Z	Pici	jzacsh	Well o3read only seems to be available in Hardy.  It looks like it was abandonded upstream, and doesn't work with the new OOo format.  The information I'm looking at indicates that it was superceded by odt2txt.
