2010-07-13T00:34:00.000Z	Neurotiquette		Does gnome have a task manager so I can kill off an app that's locking me up?
2010-07-13T00:34:00.000Z	Neurotiquette		or do I just have to alt+printscrn+K
2010-07-13T00:34:00.000Z	VCoolio	Neurotiquette	gnome-system-manager, or 'top' in terminal ('htop' is better, but not installed by default)
2010-07-13T00:35:00.000Z	VCoolio	Neurotiquette	system monitor that is, not manager
