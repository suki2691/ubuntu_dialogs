2009-06-03T17:21:00.000Z	cfm		Hi all, I have a mailserver that is running 6.06 LTS that needs to be upgraded to 7.10+ before I can upgrade its mail software.  Roughly how much downtime can I expect for a complete system upgrade?
2009-06-03T17:21:00.000Z	Myrtti	cfm	you're upgrading straight to 8.04, right?
2009-06-03T17:22:00.000Z	Myrtti	cfm	LTS' can be upgraded to the next LTS
2009-06-03T17:22:00.000Z	cfm	Myrtti	Ah, I see that the LTS upgrade path is to 8.04 - so yes, you're right!
