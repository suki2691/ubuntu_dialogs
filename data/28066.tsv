2010-07-31T23:19:00.000Z	lathan		so, i have an SD card with Ubuntu Netbook Remix 10.4 on it. So, i boot from the SD card, and click to "test" ubuntu, but I also have a persistence file. Now, i want to install UNR on my hdd. how would i go about transferring my changes from my SD card's persistence file to my hdd install?
2010-07-31T23:19:00.000Z	headkase314	lathan	Possible solution.  Install Ubuntu to the hard drive.  Then boot off the SD card and mount the Ubuntu HD.  Then copy the files over and reboot into the Ubuntu HD.
