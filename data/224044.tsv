2005-12-15T07:49:00.000Z	Kujila		Ah, hello everyone.  If someone could answer a question for me, I would be much obliged ^^
2005-12-15T07:50:00.000Z	Kujila		Ok then thanks :)  I have a Powermac G4 (466 mhz, 128 MB RAM) I bought recently for $45.  I was wondering if it could handle a full GNOME Ubuntu desktop with such low RAM
2005-12-15T07:51:00.000Z	chaumurky	Kujila	try XFCE4 instead of GNOME
