2006-08-15T05:48:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	dang`r`us	do you know a way to check for that? I can check for you.
2006-08-15T05:49:00.000Z	dang`r`us	fyrestrtr	I unfortunately don't ... sitting in front of a ubuntu box myself, it's been years since I last touched htb
2006-08-15T05:49:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	dang`r`us	I seem to recall when setting up shorewall that it detected it, but this was also a while back.
