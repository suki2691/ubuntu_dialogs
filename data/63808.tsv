2009-03-07T08:24:00.000Z	darrik		hello, i kinda need some help with my internet. I am using a usb dongle for internet and am using my drivers from windows via ndswrapper. I seem to browse and surf on firefox fine, but updating and adding/removing programs is either really slow or kinda "hiccups" speed.
2009-03-07T08:24:00.000Z	darrik		Also ima using 8.10

2009-03-07T08:25:00.000Z	ILoveXP	darrik	do you know how to choose the fastest one for your connection?
