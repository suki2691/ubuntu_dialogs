2009-03-08T10:25:00.000Z	SeaPhor	risingfish	that is not hp- specific- that is in whatever your set (default) device drivers output for faults
2009-03-08T10:32:00.000Z	SeaPhor	risingfish	no, go with OSS
2009-03-08T10:45:00.000Z	SeaPhor	risingfish	i am not a dev at hp, only a tester, and only know what i test, i'm not privy to much else, so not sure what drivers you are referring to
