2008-04-25T06:07:00.000Z	sammy	k[5\5]	the mirrors are very heavily loaded. try running synaptic package manager and choosing a new mirror to download from in the repositories configuration.
2008-04-25T06:09:00.000Z	sammy	k[5\5]	try letting it auto-find the best mirror. i was skeptical, but it worked wonderfully
2008-04-25T06:09:00.000Z	sammy	k[5\5]	also, assume that the fastest mirrors are the ones that are overloaded.
