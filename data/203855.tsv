2005-12-24T12:46:00.000Z	xcm		one more question..i have a firewire external hard drive that i cant get to mount in slackware...would ubuntu handle this any better.  everyone tells me slackware is bad about that

2005-12-24T12:48:00.000Z	vega-	xcm	just guessing :)
2005-12-24T12:48:00.000Z	vega-	xcm	but i recall someone here at work saying it detected their firewire hd
