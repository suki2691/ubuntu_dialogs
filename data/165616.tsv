2008-04-28T01:43:00.000Z	VampBoy		can anyone help me with a GRUB issue?
2008-04-28T01:44:00.000Z	VampBoy		I cant get my fresh install to boot, it keeps booting into windows instead
2008-04-28T01:45:00.000Z	VampBoy		anyone have any ideas why GRUB does not appear to be coming up at all?
2008-04-28T01:46:00.000Z	seamus7	VampBoy	hit ESC upon boot up in order to show grub ... it might be hidden
