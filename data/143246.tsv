2009-01-15T06:18:00.000Z	DevilDoc5		I was wondering, as I seem to have tethered myself to "the beast" via various games and applications, is there a (preferably) free accurate windoze replicator that will allow me to still play my games and such?
2009-01-15T06:18:00.000Z	DevilDoc5		cool thanks will check it out
