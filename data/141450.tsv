2007-05-06T11:12:00.000Z	TheFuzzy0ne		Hi everyone, I have a quick question. Is there a difference between the CD and DVD in terms of th base install?
2007-05-06T11:12:00.000Z	TheFuzzy0ne		What I mean, is can I install using the CD and still install everything I'd get with the DVD?
2007-05-06T11:12:00.000Z	TheFuzzy0ne		Also, is the CD a "live-CD"
2007-05-06T11:13:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	TheFuzzy0ne	yes, it's a live CD and yes, as long as you have an internet connection you can install all the stuff you get on the DVD>
