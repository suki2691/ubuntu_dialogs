(the daemon is being started by start-stop-daemon)  If I had to guess I'd say the pid is from the bash instance that starts start-stop-daemon, rather than the instance of the daemon itself.  Can anyone confirm this?

2009-05-04T05:35:00.000Z	Ademan	genii	nope, not yet, I suppose that'd be a good first step
