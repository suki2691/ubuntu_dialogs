2008-11-30T00:05:00.000Z	n8tuser		Sooke-> and yes gcc are the basic tools for compilation, autoconf and the Makefile are standards too
2008-11-30T00:05:00.000Z	Sooke	n8tuser	ok, so the option will be gcc as compiler, Eclipse as IDE and qt4 as gui framework right? But what is the difference between qt4 and tk?
2008-11-30T00:10:00.000Z	Sooke	n8tuser	ok, thanks
