2010-03-24T00:06:00.000Z	barkerfan809		So, my mouse and keyboard is locking up on me now with vista, I believe its either karma, pc tools, or the fact that i uninstalled some framework or something, they were old updates and thought that my pc would run fine without them. Is ther a channel you guys recommend for pc repair?
