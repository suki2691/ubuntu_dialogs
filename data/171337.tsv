2006-08-11T06:19:00.000Z	Perkins	NemesisUK	 The connect to Server in the Places menu.  Only it doesn't seem to actually mount the drive anywhere, it just uses it.  Wondering if I need to mount it from the command line instead.

2006-08-11T06:20:00.000Z	Perkins	NemesisUK	 Thanks.  That's what I needed to know.
