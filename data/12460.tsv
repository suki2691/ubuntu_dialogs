2012-09-18T03:28:00.000Z	zykotick9	imMute	the dpkg is packages, while uname is just kernel!  and they could be mixed... not a great idea.
2012-09-18T03:29:00.000Z	imMute	zykotick9	how does it decide if the /var/lib/dpkg/ directory is nonexistant?
2012-09-18T03:30:00.000Z	zykotick9	imMute	SORRY i 1) don't know this specifics and 2) don't know how multi-arch plays a part.  i'm no help, sorry.
