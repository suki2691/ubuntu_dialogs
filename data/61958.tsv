2009-08-11T20:30:00.000Z	powerjuce		the trash icon on my drive never seems to get empty, no matter what i do. i hav emptied it like a million times. How do i really empty the trash. I already deleted the ~/.local/share/Trash/* as well as /root/.local/share/Trash/* but the trash still appears full. I also hav 2 internal drives, i do not kno if that causes a problem. can anyone help?
