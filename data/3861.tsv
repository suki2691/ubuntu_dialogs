2012-06-02T03:31:00.000Z	kion		I have an Nvidia Gtx260M card but it will never reach maximum performance, any ideas?
2012-06-02T03:32:00.000Z	MirkoKa	kion	 "maximum performance" compared to what?
2012-06-02T03:33:00.000Z	kion	MirkoKa	Nvidia has 4 performance levels for my card and can be measured with nvidia-settings
2012-06-02T03:33:00.000Z	kion	MirkoKa	it is the clock speed and memory speed, Mine is allways running on a "powersave" mode
