2008-06-27T02:31:00.000Z	zendo		Hello. Can someone tell me how to enable root account (and make password) on new newly installed ubuntu 8.04 please?
2008-06-27T02:31:00.000Z	Slart	zendo	nope.. but we can tell you not to =)
2008-06-27T02:31:00.000Z	Slart	zendo	try !root or !sudo for some bot nagging =)
