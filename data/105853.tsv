2008-04-19T14:21:00.000Z	foo-nix	bazhang	Now I have 7.1, and I would like to downgrade to 6.* or 7.4
2008-04-19T14:24:00.000Z	foo-nix	bazhang	I dunno kernel versions but are there restrictions on the ekrnel versions one uses depending on the release of ubuntu, i.e. can I completely update my kernel in a 6.* install?
