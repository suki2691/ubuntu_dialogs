2012-01-06T14:59:00.000Z	JonRob		if i copy, things will get out of sync, but if i use a symlink, the partition isn't automounted and banshee etc. won't be able to read the files
2012-01-06T14:59:00.000Z	JonRob		unless i mount
2012-01-06T14:59:00.000Z	nightshade209	JonRob	automount the partition at boot
