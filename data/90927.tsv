2009-04-29T04:35:00.000Z	daftykins	dcomxx	are you trying to file share between them?
2009-04-29T04:38:00.000Z	daftykins	dcomxx	that's because there's nothing to tell the other system the IP. if you know the IP's won't change you can edit /etc/hosts to enter them statically to avoid using IP all the time
