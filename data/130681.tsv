2007-08-30T16:37:00.000Z	rockets	|neon|	sudo mii-tool
2007-08-30T16:39:00.000Z	rockets	|neon|	 I don't think mii-tool is capable of higher then 100, but also its not enough to just have a 1000 card you need a compatible switch
2007-08-30T16:39:00.000Z	rockets	|neon|	i think ethtool or something like that can do it
