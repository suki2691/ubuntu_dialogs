2008-03-29T01:53:00.000Z	chazco		Hi... i'm having trouble installing Ubuntu onto a laptop - which it has worked fine on for nearly a year. I've tried to do a clean install several times, and each time the system has been destroyed when attempting to install the massive amount of updates Gusty requires after a clean install. And on the latest attempt, the installer crashes when i try to create the partitions! I've check the CD and the hardware and all seem to be fine... any ideas?
