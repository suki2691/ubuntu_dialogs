2008-08-29T02:21:00.000Z	asedelst	jordan	aware, but it raised me to a question; even before i downloaded the restricted driver; is the default to use vesa?
2008-08-29T02:23:00.000Z	asedelst	jordan	 that's what i thought; just wasnt sure exactly what the open source module was called
2008-08-29T02:23:00.000Z	asedelst	jordan	do I set "ati" as the driver in xorg.conf for that?
