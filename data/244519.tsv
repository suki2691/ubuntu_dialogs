2006-06-29T05:08:00.000Z	Aviatrixie		ok... I'm wondering... My son is asking me if I can do a save install of Linux where he can download MP3s withouf worry of browser hijacks and viruses. Since I've never downloaded an MP3 in my life I have no clue. Does Linux give me any protection in peer to peer?
