2007-09-28T15:04:00.000Z	Metal03		Hello friends...  Is there a way to force the upgrade of a program? My situation is that I know Wine as released a new version but the auto-update doesn't see it!
2007-09-28T15:05:00.000Z	trappist	Metal03	that gets updated when ubuntu updates the package, not when the author releases a new version.  you won't see the new wine until gutsy is released, at the earliest.

2007-09-28T15:07:00.000Z	trappist	Metal03	next month, and you'd have to upgrade your distro.  once a distro is released, you'll see bugfixes and security fixes, but they don't update packages every time there's a new release of a piece of software.
