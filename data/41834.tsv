2009-12-02T05:27:00.000Z	ChogyDan	itilious	never heard of that, why do you want that?
2009-12-02T05:28:00.000Z	itilious	ChogyDan	found swfdec flash player would that work to play standalone interactive swf files?
2009-12-02T05:29:00.000Z	ChogyDan	itilious	mmm, probably not.  I think that is an opensource thing, not the adobe flash.  Can't you open it in firefox?
