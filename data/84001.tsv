2009-02-28T13:29:00.000Z	Rainium_Isotope_		can anyone help with a kde4 installation?
2009-02-28T13:31:00.000Z	Rainium_Isotope_		im @ a screen "Configuring kdm-kde4" and it asks me to select a default display manager: either gdm or kdm-kde4, (i want to be able to select between gnome and kde when i start ubuntu)
