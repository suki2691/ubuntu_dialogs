2009-04-28T08:25:00.000Z	mythbuster1848		Hello. Can anyone tell me if there's a special channel for dealing with differences between Fedora and Ubuntu? I just switched from Fedora to Jaunty and stuff I used to know how to do doesn'r work quite the same way
2009-04-28T08:26:00.000Z	mythbuster1848		On Fedora, I used to run Ktorrent headless, on Xvfb
2009-04-28T08:27:00.000Z	freehood4all	mythbuster1848	one word rtorrent... it's the shit
2009-04-28T08:27:00.000Z	freehood4all	mythbuster1848	there is plenty of gui's for rtorrent
