2010-03-13T01:16:00.000Z	greg_B		hello
2010-03-13T01:18:00.000Z	greg_B		I connect to a shared drive at work through PLACES>Connect to Server>Secure WebDAV, but one file type won't download.
2010-03-13T01:19:00.000Z	greg_B		does anyone have any ideas about why one file type would be "not found" on the network drive?
2010-03-13T01:20:00.000Z	hwilde	greg_B	is it a windows share?  could be a windows shortcut to some other file
