2011-06-30T04:52:00.000Z	sergiue		i seems i made bootable usb stick, but it do not boot ubuntu on startup
2011-06-30T04:53:00.000Z	KM0201	sergiue	then it'd be easy to argue, it's not bootable
2011-06-30T04:54:00.000Z	KM0201	sergiue	that doesn't necessarily mean it was made correctly.
2011-06-30T04:54:00.000Z	KM0201	sergiue	does the machine support booting USB?
