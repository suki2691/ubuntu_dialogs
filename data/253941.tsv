2005-04-24T13:07:00.000Z	spug		I have an old monitor, and back when I installed warty i had to manually set the refresh rate used by x lower than the default to get x up. now i've installed hoary, and of course i now have to set the refresh rate down again, but how can i do that?
2005-04-24T13:09:00.000Z	spug		where do i set the refresh rate in x.org (which i think hoary is using, right?)

2005-04-24T13:11:00.000Z	spug	LinuxJones	Wasn't there some automatical setup script i could run?
