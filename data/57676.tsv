2009-05-09T22:48:00.000Z	ODDity	mzz	just do the deb then it will put it in /usr/something something but it's the same thing
2009-05-09T22:48:00.000Z	mzz		or flashplugin-installer that is
2009-05-09T22:49:00.000Z	ODDity	mzz	i just prefer extracting the .so and sticking it in the ~/.mozilla/plugins directory
