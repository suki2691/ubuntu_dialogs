I'm p*ssed, too that Canonical picked up the nasty habbit of breaking my setup with every update. Unity is a take-it or leave-it thing, and as things semm, you should rather leave it and pick classic or even emigrate to mint

2011-04-30T13:17:00.000Z	Elladan	stefg_natty	I'm just going to reformat tomorrow and install some other OS.  Ubuntu is clearly not going to get any better.
