2008-04-02T08:54:00.000Z	stbain	youmean	gparted is just a GUI over top of parted (if memory serves me correctly)
2008-04-02T08:55:00.000Z	youmean	stbain	tha is not important,seems you and c-ron ;s point is he has to rebuild partition table
2008-04-02T08:55:00.000Z	stbain	youmean	possibly, but I think just getting in and seeing what's left will help clarify the next step
