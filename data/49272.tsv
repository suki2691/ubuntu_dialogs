2011-12-17T16:12:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	tobias_	I just logged on, what's the issue?
2011-12-17T16:14:00.000Z	tobias_	laerne	yes, but I don't get any errors installing it
2011-12-17T16:16:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	tobias_	Ah, if your question regards Apache, I can't really help you, other than generality, as I'v never used/installed it, sorry; but as laerne said, if it's not functioning properly, a re-install wouldn't hurt..
