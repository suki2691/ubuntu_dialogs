2008-01-12T04:53:00.000Z	gnoift	ArthurArchnix	i've had the same problem, but only with debian based nixes - i need to change my disk boot priority if there's a problem, which there almost always is after install and then fix things in /boot/grub/menu.lst and change hda0 to hda1/2/3 etcetera
2008-01-12T04:54:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	gnoift	Yeah, so maybe another distro like fedora 8 or opensuse is an option for people who are in those situations. Any positive experience?
2008-01-12T04:56:00.000Z	gnoift	ArthurArchnix	I've gotten sidux to work out the box and sabayon aswell, debian stable/testing is a bit strange when it gets to that
2008-01-12T04:57:00.000Z	gnoift	ArthurArchnix	but this is on y nforce4 motherboard, the problem might be fixed now
