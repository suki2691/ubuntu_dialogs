2009-07-18T15:42:00.000Z	th0r	kikokos	you don't open a port, you put something on it. It isn't that all the ports are closed by default, there just isn't anything listening on them
2009-07-18T15:43:00.000Z	kikokos	th0r	ah, so do you think that port 2234 will be open for incoming and outcoming transfers when I'll be using it?
2009-07-18T15:45:00.000Z	kikokos	th0r	so I need open port for nicotine/soulseek but it doesnt work so I guess that the port is closed....
