2009-09-16T05:17:00.000Z	beetee2		anyone know much about grub? i'm trying to get rid of the boot loader everytime I restart...
2009-09-16T05:17:00.000Z	beetee2		I was dual booting ubuntu and kubuntu, but I repartitioned the hard drives, and now only have an ubuntu installation, i'd like it to auto-boot into ubuntu on restart
2009-09-16T05:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	beetee2	why did you dual boot Kubuntu?   Kubuntu is Ubuntu with KDE, as a result you can install it into your Ubuntu install, and then select it from your log in screen
