2011-10-14T20:26:00.000Z	saml		hey, i upgraded to 11.10 ..  can I disable gnome and use openbox only?
2011-10-14T20:27:00.000Z	saml		how can i do so? i modified /etc/init/gdm.conf   to stop on runlevel 2
2011-10-14T20:27:00.000Z	saml		my idea is to boot to console.. and execute startx  and put openbox on .xinitrc
2011-10-14T20:27:00.000Z	Squeeb	saml	/etc/inittab ?
