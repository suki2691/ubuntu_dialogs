2010-01-24T18:39:00.000Z	usmanasim_		Ok. I'll just modify my question a bit. How do I go about installing an IP updating service like an alternative DNS-O-Matic ?
2010-01-24T18:39:00.000Z	usmanasim_		I found one called inadyn but only the source files where I have no idea to go. :P
2010-01-24T18:41:00.000Z	trism	usmanasim_	no idea what inadyn is, but it is in the repos (sudo apt-get install inadyn;)
2010-01-24T18:43:00.000Z	usmanasim_	trism	Thanks, I didn't know that.
