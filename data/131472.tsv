2008-01-19T04:04:00.000Z	tbnorth		hi all - anyone know how I can install wxWidgets for python 2.4 in ubuntu 7.10?  wx works in python 2.5, but I need to run something in 2.4

2008-01-19T04:05:00.000Z	tbnorth	KNY	thx for the pointer
2008-01-19T04:06:00.000Z	KNY	tbnorth	no problem. type '/join #wxwidgets' if you get stuck
