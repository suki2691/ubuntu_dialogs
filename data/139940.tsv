2008-09-24T09:14:00.000Z	LostLinux		I have another one for you folks... I'm running XP on my first HDD, and I have Ubuntu running on my second HDD. At the moment I boot straight into Ubuntu. I want to modify the grub menu file, but I don't remember how the HDD are identified in grub. Anyone want to shoot me a quick refresher? Is my first disk, first partition " (hd 0,0)"?

2008-09-24T09:15:00.000Z	LostLinux		What's the point of the chainloader?
