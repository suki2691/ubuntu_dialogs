2008-04-25T06:31:00.000Z	Skuller		Hey guys. I wanted to deploy Gutsy on my school's library PC's for web surfing. There are three. When I pop in the cd and boot from it and select 'install' at the main menu, it gives an error and comes to a command prompt style interface with busybox written on top. Any idea what's wrong?

2008-04-25T06:36:00.000Z	deadend	Skuller	The desktop cds have always seemed to be a bit buggy on the install bit. They are handy for showing off ubuntu but at this time not much more then that. Download the alternate install iso, check the md5, burn it then do a disk check, that should solve your problem
