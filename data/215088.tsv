2005-10-05T08:07:00.000Z	boxman		a bit of a problem.. i just installed latest preview of ubuntu, which seemed to go smoothly.. but the thing is that it never asked me for a root password during the installation
2005-10-05T08:07:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	boxman	cause root is disabled by default
2005-10-05T08:08:00.000Z	boxman	wickedpuppy	how do you enable it and make a root user?
2005-10-05T08:08:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	boxman	sudo command
