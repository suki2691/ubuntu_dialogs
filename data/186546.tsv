2012-11-24T00:04:00.000Z	eindoofus		hi, I was attempting to download the 64 version of ubuntu for my intel machine and "ubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64.iso" popped-up for download. Is this the correct file?

2012-11-24T00:07:00.000Z	eindoofus		while I'm here I might as well ask. Is it the case that Linux Mint has taken over as the top distro, or is it just Distrowatch giving bad results?
