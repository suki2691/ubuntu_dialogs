2005-11-20T15:01:00.000Z	JadussD		hey, could someone tell me if doing "apt-get install libsdl1.2debian-all" in ubuntu is very bad idea or not?
2005-11-20T15:02:00.000Z	polpak	JadussD	I like the SDL libs...
2005-11-20T15:03:00.000Z	polpak	JadussD	Why would it be a bad idea?
2005-11-20T15:05:00.000Z	polpak	JadussD	if it's in the repositories it's probably pretty safe
