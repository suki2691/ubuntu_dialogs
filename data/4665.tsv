2012-06-16T18:07:00.000Z	Kruptein		since yesterday the sound on youtube is very choppy  while music I play from my hard drive sounds normal, any ideas? :/
2012-06-16T18:08:00.000Z	i7c	Kruptein	are you using youtube with html5? cuz on my machine flash does a lot of strange things sometimes
2012-06-16T18:08:00.000Z	Kruptein	i7c	it should be html5 unless my settings changed I'll double check it
2012-06-16T18:10:00.000Z	Kruptein	i7c	yh html5 is enabled
