2008-04-29T05:55:00.000Z	SilverReadman		I need help: I have a windows partition and an Ubuntu 7.10 and 8.04 partition. I want to resize the 8.04 partition to take up half, the windows to take one half, and to delete the Ubuntu 7.10 partition entirely. Can anybody recommend a method? I cannot use Partition Magic because I do not have moneys.
