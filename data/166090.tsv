2007-12-16T02:24:00.000Z	PirateHead	Grav3Mind	why not use Synaptic?
2007-12-16T02:26:00.000Z	PirateHead	Grav3Mind	The DVD still has Synaptic. If you're determined to do it by command line, you've still got a choice to make. Do you want the latest Wine, or Ubuntu's packaged version of Wine?
2007-12-16T02:28:00.000Z	PirateHead	Grav3Mind	sudo apt-get install wine
