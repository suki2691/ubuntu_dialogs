2004-10-24T09:10:00.000Z	rapha[1] 	Keybuk	And is there any good tutorial for building additional packages for Ubuntu?
2004-10-24T09:20:00.000Z	rapha[1] 	Keybuk	Hmm. I'm wondering, if everything is the same as in Debian, where is the difference because of which you can't just use Debian repositories without problems under Ubuntu?
2004-10-24T09:31:00.000Z	rapha[1] 	Keybuk	I see. And when I build Ubuntu packages under Ubuntu, those settings will already be correct?
