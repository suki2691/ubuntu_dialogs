2008-02-16T23:44:00.000Z	mil0		the weirdest thing happened to me-i havent had sound from my laptop for a while and have been using an external sound card. i used a kanotix livecd and booted up earlier and somehow sound appears. i havent been able to et sound on ubuntu or windows xp. anyone got any guesses why?

2008-02-16T23:46:00.000Z	mil0	DRebellion	haha, its just the fact that i dont understand why it would work on a kanotix livecd and nothing else. id love to fix it
