2007-02-08T13:51:00.000Z	pig-wrangler	Lunar_Lamp	im acutally trying to ssh into work pc from home without messing with the firewall so i think the -R is what i need to use.
2007-02-08T13:52:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	pig-wrangler	ok, I'm not hot on ssh tunnelling. I know that I have to port forward all my traffic so I can connect to IRC, and I use the -L option.
