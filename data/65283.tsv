2009-02-28T01:00:00.000Z	hvgotcodes		hey i just got a brand new xps studio 16.  I want to install the 64 bit version of ubuntu with encrypted lvm -- which iso do i want?
2009-02-28T01:02:00.000Z	hvgotcodes		there does not seem to be an x86 64 bit install image...
2009-02-28T01:02:00.000Z	Bram_P	hvgotcodes	go to ubuntu.com choose get ubuntu and choose download, and choose 64 bit instead of 32 and download
2009-02-28T01:03:00.000Z	hvgotcodes	Bram_P	will the 8.10 installer do an encrypted install?
