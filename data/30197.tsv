2012-07-12T14:49:00.000Z	ndxtg		what is the difference between gdm and fluxbox? I'm about to install fluxbox on Ubuntu Server for lightest GUI, but seems like I must install gdm too?
2012-07-12T14:49:00.000Z	fidel	ndxtg	gdm is a login manager - fluxbox isnt afaik
2012-07-12T14:50:00.000Z	fidel		fluxbox is a pretty old looking but most likely light desktop environment (not sure if that termi is 100% correct)
2012-07-12T14:50:00.000Z	ndxtg	fidel	thanks, so I must install both in order to make fluxbox works, is that correct?
