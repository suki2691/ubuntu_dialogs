2009-09-12T23:42:00.000Z	mezquitale	MrSchmo	gnome xchat is ugly, you want to try the actual xchat
2009-09-12T23:45:00.000Z	MrSchmo	mezquitale	besides the looks, is there any difference between the two xchat, regular and gnome version?
2009-09-12T23:56:00.000Z	mezquitale	MrSchmo	i dont know the answer to that one but the last time I used xchat-gnome I almost went out of my mind
