2009-11-27T04:48:00.000Z	LjL	TheFunkbomb	because you have more than one terminal open?
2009-12-23T23:47:00.000Z	LjL	TheFunkbomb	er... the question is usually how large to make the *root* partition. home should be as big as you need it to
2009-12-23T23:47:00.000Z	LjL	TheFunkbomb	10 gig will do, 20 will be more than enough, as a rule of thumb
