2005-10-14T06:07:00.000Z	nickrud	burden	what kind of modem card do you have?
2005-10-14T06:14:00.000Z	nickrud	burden	sorry for the wait, I had to refamiliarize myself with pppconfig (I lived there for years, but as I get older, I find I need to check myself)
2005-10-14T06:15:00.000Z	nickrud	burden	did pppconfig find your modem automagically?
