The overall volume's pretty low usually, but loud enough in places.  Is it possible the movie is using 2 audio tracks and there's imbalance between them?
2008-10-22T21:28:00.000Z	Ohmu_		Could this be a codec problem?  How to fix?
2008-10-22T21:29:00.000Z	kunwon1	Ohmu_	possibly a poorly recorded movie? :D
