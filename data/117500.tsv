2007-10-08T14:44:00.000Z	Kyozo		Hi! I'm trying change my resolution from 800x600 to 1200x800 with nvidia settings but when I try to save settings to xorg.conf comes this "Unable to create new X config backup file '/etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup'." And when I restart X the resolution is 800x600 again. How can I keep the resolution at 1200x800 after booting X?
