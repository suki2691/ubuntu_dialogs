2012-10-18T14:09:00.000Z	rich_		Can anyone suggest why I cant upgrade my ubuntu server to 12.10? http://pastebin.com/dW9CAQJ1
2012-10-18T14:10:00.000Z	rich_		Nothing on apt-get update either, surely it should be able to update
2012-10-18T14:10:00.000Z	jrib	rich_	12.10 isn't out yet
2012-10-18T14:12:00.000Z	jrib	rich_	you can join #ubuntu-release-party while you wait :)
