2010-03-06T04:40:00.000Z	Lappie		no on in specific, i just wanted to remind that some of us noobs arent as savy as most of the peeps here trying to help and that if they would ask some basic questions like, for me instance, do you know how to see the cube when you switch between workspaces, i would have said no
2010-03-06T04:40:00.000Z	Lappie		but i did not know how to phrase my issue, because like i said, i am very much a noob
