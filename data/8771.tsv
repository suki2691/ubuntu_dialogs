2011-10-15T01:53:00.000Z	jmcs		hello, I've just upgraded to ubuntu 11.10 and now I can't login in my account in both Unity and Unity 2d but the guest account is working fine, is there any way I can find what's causing this?

2011-10-15T01:56:00.000Z	jmcs	cau2	I have the same permissions I had before, I can login and work in the virtual terminals just fine, I just can't login in unity
2011-10-15T01:56:00.000Z	cau2	jmcs	well I know nothing about unity other than it sucks and is a really dumb idea
