2012-04-17T12:04:00.000Z	pirx		hello! does anyone use a keylogger? i trioed "logkeys" from apt, but it just refuses to write anything to any logfile
2012-04-17T12:04:00.000Z	pirx		i want to see how many times a day i write "ssh", hehe
2012-04-17T12:06:00.000Z	torpor	pirx	history | grep ssh
2012-04-17T12:13:00.000Z	pirx	torpor	the history doesnt work for 2 reasons unfortunately. 1(no date/time) 2(a shell doesnt write to the history file until it exits)
