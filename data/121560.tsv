2007-12-17T08:45:00.000Z	suttles95		I have a dumb question...how can I tell if I'm using Gutsy Gibbon 7.10 32-bit or 64-bit?
2007-12-17T08:46:00.000Z	poeticrpm	suttles95	you on gnome
2007-12-17T08:47:00.000Z	poeticrpm	suttles95	kind of lame way, but check the about section of firefox
2007-12-17T08:50:00.000Z	poeticrpm	suttles95	did that show you? There should be an "about gnome" section under system, and a section in the system monitor
