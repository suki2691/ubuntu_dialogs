2012-09-20T20:21:00.000Z	hellslinger		hello everyone, does anyone know how to get nautilus 3.5.90 installed on quantal? I installed the beta an updated it, but nautilus is still on 3.4.2
2012-09-20T20:22:00.000Z	trism	hellslinger	quantal support in #ubuntu+1, and nautilus was reverted to 3.4 for quantal because there isn't time to adapt to all the changes in 3.5 before the release
2012-09-20T20:22:00.000Z	hellslinger	trism	is there a way to get 3.5.90 installed through a PPA?
2012-09-20T20:22:00.000Z	trism	hellslinger	take it to #ubuntu+1 and I'll check
