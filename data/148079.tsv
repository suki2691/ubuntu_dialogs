2007-01-23T06:59:00.000Z	battlesquid		i'm trying to install a font by dragging the font file from my home folder into the files:/// folder, but when i drop it, nothing happens... the procedure was described here : https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/fonts.html

2007-01-23T07:01:00.000Z	battlesquid	Khmar	i tried closing and repoening the fonts:/// location in a file browser, but the fonts did not appear
