2009-10-31T04:28:00.000Z	alid		I installed kubuntu 9.10 last night and it was all working. Today, for some reason, I am unable to play any video format. Except for youtube, none of my offline video files are being played. Any ideas?
2009-10-31T04:29:00.000Z	timepilot	alid	somewhat similar to my issue.  mp3s wont play in rhythmbox but will in other apps.  i agree w/ n8tuser, try another app.
2009-10-31T04:29:00.000Z	timepilot	alid	then try mplayer
2009-10-31T04:30:00.000Z	alid	timepilot	I tried Dragon player, but it didn't work either. I think there should be something wrong with my codec packs.
