2012-06-14T00:33:00.000Z	lysdexia		Is there a way to configure individual unity launcher icons to allow more than one instance of a program to be started? I really need more than one instance of  xterm and gvim at a time.

2012-06-14T00:34:00.000Z	theadmin	lysdexia	That's not really an answer though but
2012-06-14T00:35:00.000Z	lysdexia	theadmin	I use screen on remote sessions, so that's kind of out. I guess I could fiddle with colors and the like.
