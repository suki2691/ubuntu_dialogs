2007-07-03T07:51:00.000Z	Stwange		(sorry if you already replied to this, I got called AFK) how do I set root.root ownership, and is there a way of copying out of synaptic? It keeps coming up with URLs in it's little terminal but there's no right click menu and ctrl+c stops the thread
2007-07-03T07:52:00.000Z	Stwange		!root.root

2007-07-03T07:55:00.000Z	pike__	Stwange	i guess. that seems a little strange though. itll work for a single file. for a dir youd include the -R for recursive
