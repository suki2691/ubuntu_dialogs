2006-04-11T06:10:00.000Z	mlask		hi there. my question: how can I turn offthat awfule, black-and-white, dotted patter that is shown for about 1 second after starting xserver? when i used xfree86, i have tried many tools like xsetroot, but the didn't solve my problem. finally i found some instructions, how to edit xfree86-server binary file to have only black background, however, it doesnt work with new server (xorg). My question is: what are those numbers i have to change in
