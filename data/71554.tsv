2009-04-08T06:46:00.000Z	Matson		on debian I used to use rcconf - is there somethin like that for ubuntu?
2009-04-08T06:46:00.000Z	zloog	Matson	I belive you put what you want in /etc/init.d/rc.local
2009-04-08T06:48:00.000Z	Matson	zloog	for boot yes - was thinking more on "does apache2 boot at startup" and such
