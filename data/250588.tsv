2005-05-21T12:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	Dreamer3	dunno. think you might be a bit screwed. different packages own different pieces of /var, afaict
2005-05-21T12:16:00.000Z	Dreamer3	HappyFool	i know it's not simple
2005-05-21T12:17:00.000Z	Dreamer3	HappyFool	but it's linux, it still kinda works, and i know it's fixable
