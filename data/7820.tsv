2011-11-12T20:44:00.000Z	cYmen_		I updated a machine and can't mount my encrypted /home anymore, cryptsetup says /dev/mapper/home is active but when I try to mount it all the superblocks seem to be corrupt. Does anybody know something about this?
2011-11-12T20:44:00.000Z	bekks	cYmen_	"seem to be corrupt"? Whats the detailed error message?
2011-11-12T20:45:00.000Z	cYmen_	bekks	The error message is "Unrecognized mount option "<charactermess>" or missing value [...] bad option, bad superblock
