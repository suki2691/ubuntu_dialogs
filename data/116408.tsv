2008-04-25T17:30:00.000Z	iKernel	garu	yes, lots of people are :P
2008-04-25T17:31:00.000Z	garu	iKernel	why is that, it just wont give me a working desktop, if I enable it?
2008-04-25T17:31:00.000Z	garu	iKernel	because it says that its in use, but not enabled...which is weird when never gave me any problem in any of the past releases!
