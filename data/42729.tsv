2009-11-18T08:09:00.000Z	underdog7		hello!  can anyone tell me how i can share a partition with my dual boot OSs -- Windows 7 and Ubuntu?  I already have a third partition, however, b/c it is ext3 i cannot access it via Wndows 7.  I have also tried an EXT3 driver for Windows, but it doesn't seem to recognize the third partitions format for some reason.  any ideas anyone?
2009-11-18T08:09:00.000Z	underdog7		is the only option to have an NTFS partition?
