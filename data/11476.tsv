2012-05-14T16:23:00.000Z	dsadsa		please help me. I'm gonna destroy everything around me.
2012-05-14T16:23:00.000Z	dsadsa		I'm trying to optimize a lxde session to get it to an (at least) acceptable speed, but I'm not managing good!! It has a really good Cpu (intel p4 2.4ghz), so I don't understand the cause of this slowness!! or better I think it is the cideo-chip, an Intel@integrated chipset which shares memory with the already-low RAM (256mb).  Lol I'm refusing to realise it, I'm sure there's a way to get it faster (without buying anything)
2012-05-14T16:23:00.000Z	dsadsa		I can give you lshw & lspci outputs
2012-05-14T16:23:00.000Z	auronandace	dsadsa	256mb ram? no wonder its slow
