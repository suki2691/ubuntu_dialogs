2006-05-18T15:51:00.000Z	seven		Hi, for some reason I can't get "dchroot" with apt -get, is the package still available?
2006-05-18T15:51:00.000Z	Jimmey__	seven	try searching for it in the synaptic package manager
2006-05-18T15:58:00.000Z	Jimmey__	seven	I just installed it without problems
2006-05-18T15:59:00.000Z	Jimmey__	seven	do you have the universe repositories enabled?
