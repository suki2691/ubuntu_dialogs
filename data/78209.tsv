2008-09-29T04:29:00.000Z	frozenskunk1		Can anyone please give me some help getting my remotes to work with a commandIR in mythbuntu? I've been asking for hours in the mythbuntu room without a single response...
2008-09-29T04:30:00.000Z	inasmu	frozenskunk1	is there some reason its not working with lirc? I thought that was supported better
2008-09-29T04:31:00.000Z	frozenskunk1	inasmu	have tried mode2, irw, changing lircd.conf's, etc. and no luck
2008-09-29T04:33:00.000Z	frozenskunk1	inasmu	have tried all the troubleshooting methods I can find, still no luck. I had it working before, and girlfriend updated the box and overwrote all config files, haven't gotten it working again since 8.04 was released.
