2006-08-13T14:52:00.000Z	nearfar		how do I *completely* remove kubuntu (from ubuntu)? 'apt-get remove kubuntu-desktop' only removes the meta package.
2006-08-13T14:54:00.000Z	nearfar		ah! how different is aptitude from apt-get?
2006-08-13T14:55:00.000Z	nearfar		but I didn't use aptitude to install anything
2006-08-13T14:55:00.000Z	sethk	nearfar	it's a front end to apt-get, like synaptic, only synaptic is far superior
