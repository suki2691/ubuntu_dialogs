2005-02-03T10:09:00.000Z	bretzel	aebcoat	hmmm - thanks for your share but  this setup seems randomly false or true for user write access - I tried this setup with half suxxess for a reason I don;t know -- I am not a guru
2005-02-03T10:11:00.000Z	bretzel	aebcoat	that's good :-) Yes I think umask=0 means all perms... I dunno
