2009-01-09T19:39:00.000Z	chetnick	SlimeyPete	I have Nvidia GeForce 8800 GTS, and the drivers have been installed correctly. I have been using system for over an year and this videos worked fine but no somehow they dont.  I am not sure how to check oï»¿utput module of my video player. I tried with VLC and Totem Movie Player. Do you think i should try other players?
