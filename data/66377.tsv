2009-05-15T04:40:00.000Z	mzz	kansan__	that might not be possible without upgrading to a 64-bit kernel
2009-05-15T04:40:00.000Z	kansan__	mzz	should i run the 64 bit version of ubuntu instead or something?
2009-05-15T04:40:00.000Z	mzz	kansan__	I think I would with that amount of ram, but I haven't researched this, so don't just take my word for it.
