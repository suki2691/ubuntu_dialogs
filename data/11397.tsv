2012-04-21T20:13:00.000Z	streblo		last night i was messing around with a machine i have and i wound up in a situation where i cant boot and im always dropped into initramfs
2012-04-21T20:13:00.000Z	streblo		i made a usb stick with unetbootin
2012-04-21T20:13:00.000Z	streblo		but i cant boot that either
