2011-10-13T18:24:00.000Z	Promethes		hi everyone, does Ubuntu 11.10 allow to install gnome-shell without dependency problems?
2011-10-13T18:25:00.000Z	Darael	Promethes	My understanding is yes... but you might want to wait for someone who's actually tried it to report back!
2011-10-13T18:26:00.000Z	Promethes	Darael	i tried with 11.10 beta 2 and daily builds couple of days ago and there was no way to install gnome-shell, many dependencies were unsolvable
2011-10-13T18:27:00.000Z	Darael	Promethes	I would be surprised if that's not been resolved before release.
