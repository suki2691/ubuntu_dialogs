2010-07-09T01:00:00.000Z	Charbel	thune3	can i disable them from orca ?
2010-07-09T01:07:00.000Z	thune3	Charbel	i don't know. i get the impression that you can set the gconf key "/desktop/gnome/interface/accessibility" to false to disable the "accessability infrastructure" from starting with GDM
2010-07-09T02:07:00.000Z	Charbel	thune3	i tried /usr/share/gdm/autostart/LoginWindow and it didn't work or maybe i didn't know how to fix it
