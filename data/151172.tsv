2007-10-31T00:40:00.000Z	Randomist		How do I get rid of the choppiness?
2007-10-31T00:40:00.000Z	andycr	Randomist	No idea. I have that issue in Vista, but not in Linux. What card?
2007-10-31T00:42:00.000Z	andycr	Randomist	Same as I. No idea why. With mine mixing is weird but on vista it's -totally- unusable
