2007-04-19T10:10:00.000Z	locolbd		does anyone know if there is an irc chatroom which deals with "C programming" or "GCC"
2007-04-19T10:11:00.000Z	micahcowan	locolbd	there is also a #gcc, but I don't know if that's actually meant for programming in it...
2007-04-19T10:12:00.000Z	micahcowan	locolbd	actually, depending on who's there, ##c is often tolerant of POSIX/Linux questions; just don't ask gcc-specific stuff (that'd prolly be #gcc)
