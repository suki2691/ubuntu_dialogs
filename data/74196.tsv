2009-08-06T20:20:00.000Z	tommck		I was disconnected in the middle of doing an fsck over ssh (I realize now that this is a mistake).  I was wondering if there's a way to resume control of an existing ssh and/or terminal session on that machine...  I've been googling, but no success.  I'd really appreciate any help I can get.
