2009-11-19T20:04:00.000Z	zauber		I have a server running Feisty - so pretty old. What would the best steps be to upgrade it to jaunty? I'd prefer not to reinstall completely because I'd like to keep my server settings alive
2009-11-19T20:05:00.000Z	jrib	zauber	why jaunty?
2009-11-19T20:05:00.000Z	zauber	jrib	anything new. Where I can still get updates. apt doesn't work anymore :(
