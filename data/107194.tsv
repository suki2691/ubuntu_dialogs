2008-01-19T01:50:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Ademan	I got one for xserver-xorg-core, I think
2008-05-18T13:02:00.000Z	Starnestommy	Ademan	vim-common, or vim-full
2008-05-18T13:03:00.000Z	Ademan	Starnestommy	interesting, because i brought over my .vimrc from my other computer, and every time i start vim it complains about missing a theme file, and i know i didn't install any aux theme files (and i've got vim-full)
