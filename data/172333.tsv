2006-08-09T06:27:00.000Z	IdleOne	IRCMonkeyX	dont install anything from an unknows/unsafe source.. ( if your not sure then dont do it ) and you will be fine
2006-08-09T06:30:00.000Z	IdleOne	IRCMonkeyX	linux isnt like windows where you just point and click... you need to think about what it is you are going to install so that in turn forces you to know what it is your installing making it alot safer for the user.. windows just lets you install everything forcing you to be stupid and trusting everything
