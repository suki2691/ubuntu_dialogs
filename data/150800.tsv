2012-10-26T16:23:00.000Z	yeehi		I want to find .iso files inside a folder - The folder I want to search has many sub folders. /home/saved/ How do I search for iso files inside all these sub folders?
2012-10-26T16:24:00.000Z	Pici	yeehi	find /path/ -iname "*.iso"
2012-10-26T16:29:00.000Z	Pici	yeehi	did you replace /path/ with /home/saved ?
