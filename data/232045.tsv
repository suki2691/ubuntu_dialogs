2007-12-08T22:05:00.000Z	Scisla1		does anyone know why a sound device would "disappear" after an upgrade to Gutsy?
2007-12-08T22:05:00.000Z	Scisla1		by disappear I mean that nothing is shown when "asoundconf list" is used
2007-12-08T22:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	Scisla1	the new gutsy kernel has a bug (regression)
2007-12-08T22:07:00.000Z	Scisla1	erUSUL	so, to fix my friend's situation I should go re-install an older kernel then? (should I go feisty or just one lower version from Gutsy, such as a development period one?)
