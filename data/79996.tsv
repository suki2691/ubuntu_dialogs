2011-11-12T00:44:00.000Z	Bushman		can anyone tell me why the flash video performance droped radically after today's update?
2011-11-12T00:44:00.000Z	Bushman		seriously, what kind of updates do they put there that overal system performance drops instead of being increased?!
2011-11-12T00:46:00.000Z	Bushman		how can a security update reduce a video performance?!
2011-11-12T00:47:00.000Z	bekks	Bushman	because adobe placed a security update for flash.
