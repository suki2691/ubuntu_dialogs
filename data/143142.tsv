2007-03-12T12:59:00.000Z	variant	AndrewLife	in the file manager right click the file/dir and select properties
2007-03-12T12:59:00.000Z	AndrewLife	variant	It wont let me, the permissions area is all greyed out.
2007-03-12T13:00:00.000Z	variant	AndrewLife	then you don't have permission to alter the permission of those files :)
