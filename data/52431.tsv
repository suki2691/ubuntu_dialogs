2009-07-18T08:23:00.000Z	Ubuntab		Can someone tell me something? I'm new to Ubuntu and doing well so far but I am wondering if there's anyway to have a second clock. I googled it and the results on the Ubuntu forums are not very helpful :(
2009-07-18T08:24:00.000Z	Ubuntab		I would like to have a clock somewhere that will let me see a second timezone so I can always see the time where a friend lives.
2009-07-18T08:25:00.000Z	debac1e	Ubuntab	you can add another location to the clock, then click the clock to see it in a dropdown, or change to that time, but it won't act like a widget to see *both* other than the dropdown
2009-07-18T08:28:00.000Z	debac1e	Ubuntab	np, you can surely get a different widget-like clock if you do want to show both, I just don't know of one and that would mean installing something else
