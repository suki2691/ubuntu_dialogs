2006-03-02T07:19:00.000Z	george_		If I could ask, how do you change the allowable resolutions without reinstalling? if I go to system > preferences > screen resolution, it stops at 1024x768.  before I reinstalled it I had it higher.  I know I made that mistake on my reinstall, but would hate to go back after all I've done, heh. =)
