2011-11-30T13:41:00.000Z	jpk	almoxarife	Ah, I'll take a look at dnsmaq.
2011-11-30T13:43:00.000Z	almoxarife	jpk	for what it seems to me you are trying to accomplish it would be a good choice, I use it to keep a list current of web addresses blocked, not the same but sort of is, that list is a file that I auto update monthly
