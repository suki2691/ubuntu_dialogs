2011-05-11T09:53:00.000Z	jjore		My natty upgrade has gone horrible. Apt has wedged my computer while unable to resolve some python version problem. http://pastie.org/1887726 I'm thinking to prune everything "extra" from `dpkg -l` until the dependency problem is resolved. To get there, how do I get a proper list of a normal server's `dpkg -l` to compare against?
