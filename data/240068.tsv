2006-06-08T06:28:00.000Z	Mikeboon		Has anyone found intergrated surround sound (through nvida nforce3 with frontin in sound-in and rear in mic) with 6.06 to work?
2006-06-08T06:29:00.000Z	Mikeboon		only get front speakers and sub
2006-06-08T06:31:00.000Z	Mikeboon		If not nforce sound set, atleast surround sound, i was told surround sound with intergrated boards isn't possible in linux in general as it's software controlled through xp
