2005-07-28T06:44:00.000Z	carol		Hi all, I need some help with connecting to the internet with a 56k analog modem in Hoary. Basically, how do I do it?
2005-07-28T06:45:00.000Z	carol		Yes, it is a Conexant HSF and appears in the Device Manage list
2005-07-28T06:46:00.000Z	carol		It has worked with other Debian distros, so I don't know if it is just me or if it lack of a driver
