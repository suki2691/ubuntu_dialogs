2005-10-17T10:26:00.000Z	liran__		i got ubuntu installed for quite a while... how do i go about re-compiling the kernel? i want it to be compatible to my cpu (its an old p3)
2005-10-17T10:26:00.000Z	Blissex	liran__	no point in recompiling. Just use a 686 precompiled kernel.
2005-10-17T10:28:00.000Z	liran__	Blissex	but an 686 kernel version isn't the best compatible with my own cpu, right? i mean its a version compiled on some other cpu, like a p4-2.2ghz or whatever
2005-10-17T10:28:00.000Z	Blissex	liran__	dont worry about that. The 686 kernel is about the best compatible with your PIII.
