2009-12-30T06:02:00.000Z	njsharkracer	canthus13	i have never had a problem with the motherboard on my laptop.  only problem i had with it in 2 years is upgrading the wireless card from a broadcom to atheros chipset but was fixed with a bios upgrade.
2009-12-30T06:04:00.000Z	canthus13	njsharkracer	I didn't for a couple of years.. Then it started shutting down randomly, the wireless completely disappeared, and now it's at the point that it won't power up.  Apparently, most of the pavillions made in the last 3 years are suceptible to this. SOmething to do with poorly soldered chipsets. also causes overheating.
2009-12-30T06:06:00.000Z	njsharkracer	canthus13	thanks for the heads up.  luckily i haven't had a problem yet considering that when I was running winblows on this laptop i was always overclocking the video chipset on here.
