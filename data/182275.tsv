2007-01-12T12:51:00.000Z	amigrave		I have a fresh install of debian sarge that I want to convert to ubuntu server, all I have to do is change /etc/apt/sources.list and apt-get update & dist-upgrade ? I heard about something with udev ? Should I install or remove it after upgrade ? It's a remote server and I have to be sure that it will reboot
