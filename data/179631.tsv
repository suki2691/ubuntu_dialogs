2006-10-06T15:19:00.000Z	Salihu		Is Ubuntu going to run well (i.e., a relatively "snappy" response) on a 1 GHz PIII with 512 MB? or should I try something "lighter"?
2006-10-06T15:20:00.000Z	Salihu		OK...  Thanks for your opinions...
2006-10-06T15:21:00.000Z	jrib	Salihu	what are you doing to add it?
2006-10-06T15:22:00.000Z	Salihu	jrib	It is going to go on an old compaq...  The only OS on the computer.
