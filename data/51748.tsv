2009-07-28T18:35:00.000Z	maettu		silly problem: I have a directory under subversion control, then upgraded from 8.04 to 9.04, had to downgrade because of issues and now I can't use subversion in 8.04 on that dir any more, because it complains that the svn client is too old. apt-get says, subversion is the newest version.
2009-07-28T18:36:00.000Z	sbeh	maettu	load a binary package of subversion from subversion.tigris.org
2009-07-28T18:37:00.000Z	sbeh	maettu	you may delete it later, if you're going to upgrade
2009-07-28T18:39:00.000Z	maettu	sbeh	there aren't any, just a link to packages.ubuntu.com
