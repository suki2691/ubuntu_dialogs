2007-04-30T13:21:00.000Z	metellius		I just got a intel core duo 2 based laptop. I strongly dislike things that don't work. I have 1.5 gb of memory. is there even a single reason for me to install amd64 ubuntu on it?

2007-04-30T13:23:00.000Z	metellius	skenmy	that's actually what I'm wondering about. I don't think I have _any_ need for 64bit support
2007-04-30T13:24:00.000Z	metellius	skenmy	what do you "capability"? can you run 64bit stuff while still using 32bit ubuntu?
