2012-06-28T23:21:00.000Z	jluc		i have a couple of SSH accessed folders that i can use through nautilus, and edit with geany for example, but what is their local adress ? where are they mounted ?
2012-06-28T23:21:00.000Z	jluc		i need to access them through another application that requires their local adress
