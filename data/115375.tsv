2007-11-23T00:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	Not_Sure	Looks like you have more than just one partition and free space...
2007-11-23T00:39:00.000Z	Not_Sure	Jordan_U_	correct. I have split my drive into two partitions. One was ntfs and the other unallocated space. Then I installed Windows XP on ntfs partition. Now I am trying to install ubuntu on unallocated space. However, gnome partition manager does not recognize the ntfs partition. Instead, it recognizes the entire drive as unallocated space.
