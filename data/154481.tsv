2006-12-17T11:23:00.000Z	matxxtt		I am having trouble installing VMware tools in kubuntu.. I keep getting a error saying a previous installation has been detected..
2006-12-17T11:25:00.000Z	matxxtt		I run the command in konsole sudo install vmware-install.pl
2006-12-17T11:26:00.000Z	un_operateur1	matxxtt	err -- it should be   sudo perl vmware-install.pl
2006-12-17T11:31:00.000Z	un_operateur1	matxxtt	do you have a previous installation already on your system?
