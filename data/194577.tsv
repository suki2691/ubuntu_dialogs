2007-01-28T17:42:00.000Z	ziadoz		lets you use the mouse and keyboard from one machine to control another
2007-01-28T17:44:00.000Z	mytruehero	ziadoz	you just followed the instructions here (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynergyHowto) when you set up?
2007-01-28T17:47:00.000Z	mytruehero	ziadoz	hmm. any idea what might be causing the problem? I assume that when synergy tries to autostart, it hits the same error that I'm seeing when I try to manually start
