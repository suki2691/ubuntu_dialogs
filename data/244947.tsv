2005-03-22T16:26:00.000Z	mxr		one thing i don't get. ubuntu has apt-get but when trying to install mplayer-custom i get The following packages have unmet dependencies:
2005-03-22T16:28:00.000Z	linux_galor1	mxr	should be using synaptic
2005-03-22T16:29:00.000Z	mxr	linux_galor1	ok, will try that. have not used it before. just wanted to try out something new, debian based
2005-03-22T16:29:00.000Z	linux_galor1	mxr	the idea of synaptic or apt-get is you dont every download anything you just add a few servers to the sources.list file and then just get apt-get or synaptic to get the package and fix the dependencies
