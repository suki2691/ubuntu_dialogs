2008-10-06T05:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	JoeFool	 the 'find' command is handy for that task
2008-10-06T05:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	JoeFool	 i would tart with 'man find' and oerhaps google for sojme 'find tutorials'
2008-10-06T05:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	JoeFool	 theres also the 'locate' command if youjust want to find files based on name
