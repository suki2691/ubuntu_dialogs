I port forwarded my router (port 5900) so that i could connect from my work as well. When i got home tonight I noticed there were x2 other users connected and i cut them off right away. How is this possible? I set it so that you have to enter an 8 character pw to take control when you remote i

2008-03-01T11:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	CoolBreeze	 well.. you had 2 other users connected.. :) so logicially YES a password is not enough security
