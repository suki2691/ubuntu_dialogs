2005-12-26T07:35:00.000Z	MoonRanger		i just run a small computer recycling organization .. we take low end computers and donate them to people who cant afford them. most of the systems I donate are P2 400, 64meg RAM, and at least a 6.4gig HDD .. so think i will try ubuntu on one just to see
2005-12-26T07:36:00.000Z	MoonRanger		ok ..
