2011-12-03T01:54:00.000Z	Guest86058		I want to uninstall unity 3d and just use unity 2d. Is there a way to do this?
2011-12-03T01:55:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Guest86058	why uninstall? why not just login as unity2d and keep that as default session?

2011-12-03T01:58:00.000Z	ThinkT510	Guest86058	why not just use a different desktop?
