2006-07-04T12:32:00.000Z	Pjay_	erUSUL	the desktop cd sounded like a live cd in the description, would i be best off just getting the other cd and reinstalling
2006-07-04T12:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	Pjay_	if you have inet connection doing what i said will install everything you need afaik (sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop)
