2007-10-08T08:57:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise		I want to use amarok, but I'd rather not install all of KDE foe one app. Any way to only install the dependencies amarok needs, and not the entire desktop enviroment?
2007-10-08T08:58:00.000Z	Pelo	WorkingOnWise	  sudo apt-get install amarok ,  you will get it in gnome
2008-01-19T09:12:00.000Z	Pelo	WorkingOnWise	nano, vim
2008-01-19T09:14:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Pelo	ughhh! I was afraid they would be the first recommendations...
