2011-07-14T22:45:00.000Z	zacktu		i want to disconnect the usb cable to my android phone - when i "safely remove drive" i get an error message "unable to stop drive"  with a followup message that synchronize cache failed -- i can disable usb file copying on the phone -- is that sufficient to prevent any problems?
2011-07-14T22:46:00.000Z	coz_	zacktu	 out of curiosity,, open the home directory,, on the left list,, is the phone indicated  wiht a large  dark "up" arrow there?
2011-07-14T22:49:00.000Z	zacktu	coz_	no it's not -- i've tried combinations of eject & safely remove -- i had a desktop icon & selected it and ejected -- the icon went away -- if i open up "computer" the phone icon is still there
