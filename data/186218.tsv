2007-05-22T05:01:00.000Z	GaiaX11		I have had problems with my cd/dvd driver. They mount the media, but sometimes they fail. Do you think that I have to clean their lens up with alcohol?

2007-05-22T05:04:00.000Z	GaiaX11	linxeh	My drive is not old. About 5 months old
2007-05-22T05:05:00.000Z	linxeh	GaiaX11	then return it as faulty (at least, in the UK I would do that as we get a 12 month warantee on most stuff)
