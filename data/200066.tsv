2006-05-03T09:18:00.000Z	ps	intelikey	does that relate only to my monitor? or does my computer shutdown if there is no activity(off) for 60 minutes?
2006-05-03T09:19:00.000Z	intelikey	ps	that can go either way according to settings
2006-05-03T09:21:00.000Z	intelikey	ps	in that case prolly both.    it's for note books mainly
