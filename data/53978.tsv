2009-06-21T03:09:00.000Z	James_P	GodfatherofEire	i'm sure most rootkits would be detectable by running md5's on the basic binaries used by ubuntu and comparing them to know good values
2009-06-21T03:10:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	James_P	what about rks that dont attatch to the .deb files, but wind up piggybacking on a packet/file sent to your comp over the net?
2009-06-21T03:11:00.000Z	James_P	GodfatherofEire	that would require manually executing, as root, a file that you downloaded from an untrusted source on the internet.
