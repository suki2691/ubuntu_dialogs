2008-05-02T05:14:00.000Z	Tom64		hi. I've got a C2D macbook. How do I boot the live cd on it?
2008-05-02T05:14:00.000Z	nickellery	Tom64	have you attempted to restart the computer with the CD inside the drive?
2008-05-02T05:15:00.000Z	Tom64	nickellery	no, the cd is downloading now, I'm just wondering what to do. Do I just put it in the drive and restart, or do I have to hold something down?
