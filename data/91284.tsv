2008-05-10T23:15:00.000Z	i-hope-this-name	sidewalk	transmission, but i like deluge better myself
2008-05-10T23:17:00.000Z	sidewalk	i-hope-this-name	why do you prefer deluge?
2008-05-10T23:17:00.000Z	i-hope-this-name	sidewalk	it's just like it better. it's a nice mix between the sparse layout of transmission and the clusterfcsk of things like azereus
