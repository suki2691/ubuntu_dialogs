2011-12-13T01:57:00.000Z	Cybertinus		for the people who where helping me earlier tonight with my WLAN problem ( |Anthony| for example): the problem is fixed. For some weird reason WLAN was  disabled in the BIOS. Enabled it there again and now I'm IRCing via WLAN :)

2011-12-13T02:00:00.000Z	Cybertinus	askreet	hmm, fn+f2 it is. It's plausible that I've hit that
