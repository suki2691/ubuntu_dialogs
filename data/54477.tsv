2009-06-21T17:22:00.000Z	LCarroll		Following the tutorials on pendrivelinux.com, I'm gonna create a CD  to boot Ubuntu from USB, since my PC BIOS doesn't support booting from a USB drive. So far, so good. My question is: what do I have to do preinstall Ubuntu 8.10 on my USB flash drive. I need to know if this can be performed using ONLY the Ubuntu Live CD, since my HD can't be used, because it's seriously damaged.  Thanks

2009-06-21T17:25:00.000Z	greenkernel		If you could a CD-ROM, why not trying to boot Ubuntu from a LiveCD which is available at Ubuntu official website ..
2009-06-21T17:26:00.000Z	LCarroll	greenkernel	yes, but I wonder: how do i  save the OS on the USB flash, oce IÂ¡m running the live-cd ??
