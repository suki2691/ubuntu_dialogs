2011-11-04T19:48:00.000Z	zykotick9	puff	if you need to ask - stick to 32bit.  The big advantage to 64bit is access to more then 3.2GB of RAM (without 1-10% performance hit of PAE)
2011-11-04T19:48:00.000Z	puff	zykotick9	I have 8GB of ram.
2011-11-04T19:49:00.000Z	zykotick9	puff	with that much memory i'd consider 64bit then
