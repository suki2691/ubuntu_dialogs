2009-03-02T07:24:00.000Z	remi	crdlb	i've been looking to buy this dell laptop, but it only comes with this specific card. and I've been reading a lot of negative things about it (and the intel xorg driver) so I wanted to make sure it would work correctly with Ubuntu.
2009-03-02T07:26:00.000Z	crdlb	remi	you'd have to ask him, but it seems to be working except for multihead (it looks like the intel driver may still max out at 2048 by default even though the H/W is capable of more)
