It is likely that it is not set up correctly. Would you like to view the X server output to diagnose the problem? Yes/No
2007-08-11T12:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	boleslo	boot in recovery mode log in and use this command to reconfigure the X server 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
2007-08-11T12:38:00.000Z	boleslo	erUSUL	ok, i will try
