2008-11-20T01:49:00.000Z	ghaith	quilzo	yes i know, but if he tries to remove the newone first it'll mess up
2008-11-20T01:50:00.000Z	quilzo	ghaith	if he downloaded the source for the older one first, was able to remove wget without apt whining about dependencies, then compiled and installed wget, I see no obvious problems
2008-11-20T01:51:00.000Z	ghaith	quilzo	yeah that could work
