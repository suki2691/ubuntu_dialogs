2007-09-15T06:54:00.000Z	superkiwi		I got a new hdd today and I am wondering. Should I download tribe 5 or wait for the official 7.10 release?
2007-09-15T06:55:00.000Z	superkiwi		I see. But if I for instance download 7.04, can I 'upgrade' to 7.10 when it is released?
2007-09-15T06:55:00.000Z	superkiwi		good, thanks :]
