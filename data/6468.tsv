2012-01-28T08:48:00.000Z	flowerpot	[[thufir]]	I had that problem.  It resolved itself but I don't know why.
2012-01-28T08:48:00.000Z	flowerpot	[[thufir]]	have you tried rebooting just to see if that helps?
2012-01-28T08:49:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	flowerpot	well, this started ~6 boots ago, so I'll reboot tomorrow.  I can't imagine what the difference is, although I did re-install a bunch of sound stuff.
