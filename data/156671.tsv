2007-01-28T16:19:00.000Z	UbuntuN00B_HB1		I've configured my wlan-card with ndiswrapper and entered the ESSID + a WEP-key... the same SSID and WEP-key is entered in my wlan-router... the klient gets an IP but I cant ping that computer... and it cant reach my home network!
2007-01-28T16:20:00.000Z	UbuntuN00B_HB1		I appreciate help!
