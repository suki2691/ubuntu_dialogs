2008-05-07T01:53:00.000Z	sarah2		Problem:  Want to use Skype and Camorama with a USB logitech webcam.  FAILURE:  Says cannot find anything at /dev/video0 even though when I plug in my camera /dev/video0 becomes active.  Installed Easycam which through it I can start Camorama for some strange reason but cannot start Camorama on my own.  Please help.
