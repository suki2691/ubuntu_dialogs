2005-11-15T10:00:00.000Z	amittp_		Hi, Does anyone know if there is any sftp GUI ? I found nautilus does it, but I can open files only in read-only mode
2005-11-15T10:02:00.000Z	Xenguy	amittp_	gftp does that I believe, tho I find the interface a bit clunky (it works tho)

2005-11-15T10:08:00.000Z	amittp_	Xenguy	gftp does allow me to open it in gvim, edit it too.. but I think it saves it to temp folder, not edit the file at server itself, is this normal behaviour?
