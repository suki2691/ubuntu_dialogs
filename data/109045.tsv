2008-07-08T07:35:00.000Z	Gustavo		Hello, I have a notebook gateway, with the wireless network on the integrathed USB (lsusb finds that) and the wireless was working on Ubunto 7.0. Since 7.04 it is not working properly anymore. sometimes "iwlist scan" finds the network although when it tries to connetc, it stops.... there seems to be no connection between ifconfig (wlan0) and iwconfig
2008-07-08T07:35:00.000Z	Gustavo		have anyone suffered with that too?
2008-07-08T07:35:00.000Z	FAJALOU	Gustavo	have you tried using ndiswrappe?
2008-07-08T07:41:00.000Z	Gustavo	FAJALOU	and then? the configuration seems to be gray
