2009-11-18T00:09:00.000Z	odder7		it is the fourth time I am asking here for help -- anybody willing to give me a hand?
2009-11-18T00:10:00.000Z	odder7		and please, dont treat me as a noob with those ubottu commands
2009-11-18T00:10:00.000Z	odder7		I have encountered today a problem with booting to my 64-bit Ubuntu -- after I see the logo I can see a black screen only
2009-11-18T00:10:00.000Z	dcorking_	odder7	- I don't know what your question is, but if you already asked 4 times, I am willing to bet that no-one knows the answer :(
