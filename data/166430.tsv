2007-06-02T13:03:00.000Z	lexis_nexus		just a suggestion for anybody always make a seperate partion for your home dir so that when you screw up your system you can make a fresh install and have all your files and settings intact
2007-06-02T13:03:00.000Z	wols	lexis_nexus	and all your system wide settings in etc, all your mail, DBs, websites in /var: all gone
