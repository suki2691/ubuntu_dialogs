2006-08-24T11:34:00.000Z	Warbo	natural20	I use ftechyahoo to let me use Evolution
2006-08-24T11:35:00.000Z	natural20	Warbo	no idea what ftechyahoo or evolution is
2006-08-24T11:36:00.000Z	Warbo	natural20	Evolution certainly is, but I found that Dapper's fetchyahoo stopped working recently, but the latest version from fetchyahoo.sourceforge.net works
