2012-06-08T12:14:00.000Z	feisar		Hi, when I login in to a newly installed 12.04 server I get some info about packages and updates, on another server which was updated to 12.04 I don't get this. Could someone let me know what I'm missing?

2012-06-08T12:16:00.000Z	feisar	Dr_Willis	oh right ok cheers
2012-06-08T12:18:00.000Z	feisar	Dr_Willis	ah apt-get install update-motd might fix it ... a little strange why that was not installed when I updated
