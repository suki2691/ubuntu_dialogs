2011-10-13T14:34:00.000Z	Reave-Magentium	leo9	course, ask away :)
2011-10-13T14:35:00.000Z	Reave-Magentium	leo9	so let me confirm you wish to return to Firefox 6 on ubuntu, and stop it from automatically updating?
2011-10-13T14:36:00.000Z	Reave-Magentium	leo9	unfortunately due to a lot of security issues with firefox, i do nto believe that is possible. the only thing that i can recommend if you are runing 11.04 is a re-install, and when you update your packages, de-select the firefox  packages
