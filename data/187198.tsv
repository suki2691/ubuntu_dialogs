2007-12-28T17:03:00.000Z	[Chief]		hey, i have problems with my networkcard. It's a RTL8211BL (nforce630a). During the installation of Ubuntu 7.10 Secer AMD64 she worked fine with the forcedeth driver, but after I boot the installed system the card doesn't work. The Kernel is 2.6.22-14-server (The install system of the CD runs the kernel 2.6.22-14-generic)
