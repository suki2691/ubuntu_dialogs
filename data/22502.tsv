2011-01-13T01:12:00.000Z	Wicked		hello all. lost power due to a snow storm and trying to reboot my ubuntu server now and its checking the filesystesm(to be expected)...but it has not output any info in the last 5-10 mins and im worried it has stalled out or something. the last couple ines are: /dev/sdX clean blah blah blah <new line> /dev/sdbX blah blah files (6.0% contguous) <new line> init: ureadahead-other main process (XXXX) terminated with status 4
2011-01-13T01:13:00.000Z	Wicked		seems like its taking a long time to do the checks without any output. would have nice if it was more verbose
2011-01-13T01:13:00.000Z	bencahill	Wicked	i don't know about the verbosity, but i've had some disk checks take as long as 15-20, maybe 30 minutes
2011-01-13T01:18:00.000Z	Wicked	bencahill	 ah ok
