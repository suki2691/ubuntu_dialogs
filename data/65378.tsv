2009-03-16T07:25:00.000Z	kgwhipp		Ok guys: here's one for ya: I've got ubuntu 4.10 on this old geezer computer, I want to update it to the most recent version- tools I have-- usb key with 100mb free and another computer on the internet. The old computer has internet but ubuntu 4.10 doesn't see the ethernet driver so no internet atm. What should I do?
2009-03-16T07:26:00.000Z	kgwhipp		figured as much
2009-03-16T07:26:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	kgwhipp	back up the 4.10 and re-install
2009-03-16T07:28:00.000Z	sprinkmeier	kgwhipp	plug the HDD into the new computer, re-install, then move back to the 286(?)
