2007-10-21T10:35:00.000Z	jimmygoon	dxdt	well, with x there is the regular clipboard and then that is a secondary one already
2007-10-21T10:36:00.000Z	dxdt	jimmygoon	explain more, what you said doesn't help me with my problem.  So there are two clipboards you say?
2007-10-21T10:37:00.000Z	jimmygoon	dxdt	thats the way I read about it, but a bit of trying here in xchat seems to imply that they use the same clipboard area... fore xample ... just select some text right now and middle click in the input box... it gets copied alright
