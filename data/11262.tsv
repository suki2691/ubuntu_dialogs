2011-08-05T20:56:00.000Z	OmegaForte	mega1	What actually is the problem...I saw you earlier going on about an adapter being in a different location.
2011-08-05T20:57:00.000Z	OmegaForte	mega1	Yeah that's because you transplated into a system with different hardware and it wasn't built on it, so now you have to build or install your drivers manually.
