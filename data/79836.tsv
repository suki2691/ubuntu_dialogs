2008-09-13T01:26:00.000Z	jp73107	brandan_	try using wine to install the yahoo messenger windows client, i don't think there is a linux client with that functionality
2008-09-13T01:27:00.000Z	jp73107	brandan_	: Try going into the yahoo messenger preferences, and find the "Firewall with no proxies" option
