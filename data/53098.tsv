2009-07-06T01:52:00.000Z	nadine		why is it that my Sempron Thoroughbred @2Ghz 1Gb of DDR400 geforce 6200 AGP so much quicker running ubuntu studio  8.10 then this atholon x2 4000+ 1Gb ddr2 667 geforce 6150se running 9.04 regular ubuntu?
2009-07-06T01:52:00.000Z	Shadowww	nadine	are you sure you are running ubuntu x64?
2009-07-06T01:54:00.000Z	nadine	Shadowww	yes, but why would running x64 on  it make it so much slower? I do intend to up it to 4Gb though
2009-07-06T01:55:00.000Z	Shadowww	nadine	it won't make it run slower, only faster
