2008-03-21T04:08:00.000Z	Mik1		Hey people -Can ask - trying to get Ubuntu (Gutsy - i think) installed on a Dell Lattitude D800 - having problems setting up an external USB keyboard & mouse - keyboard works - mouse appears (in /dev/input) but it doesn't work - anyone got any ideas - I'm thinking it might be X11 Configuration?

2008-03-21T04:10:00.000Z	Mik1	unop	: i'm running the live DVD version - can I still run that?
