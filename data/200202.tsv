2011-03-28T20:06:00.000Z	drc	folorn	Slackware does not have package dependency solving (out of the box)...Ubuntu does
2011-03-28T20:20:00.000Z	drc	folorn	Package Dependency mean that if Package A requires Package B and C to work, Ubuntu will install B and C while Slackware will make you manually install B and C
