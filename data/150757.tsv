2010-06-01T19:56:00.000Z	Noiano		where do I find network manager's applet configuration files? I need to recover my wifi password :)

2010-06-01T19:57:00.000Z	Noiano	Pici	the problem is that I copy the whole home dir to an usb stick and I made a clean ubuntu install... I'd like to recover the network manager's config
