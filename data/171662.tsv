2006-08-17T06:04:00.000Z	nagyv		How could I find out wheather I use arts or alsa? I would like to set up Skype the best possible way. I have already read about dsp_hijacker, but now found a forum (http://forum.skype.com/index.php?showtopic=48195) and also a possible kopete integration with a different tip (http://extragear.kde.org/apps/kopete%20skype/) (I use kubuntu, but I think it doesn't make any difference here.)
