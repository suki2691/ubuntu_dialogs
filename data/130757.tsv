2007-06-15T06:08:00.000Z	xbye		how can I get amarok to import new music into my library? i was previously using iTunes, and it would organize the file structure in the form Artist/Album/TrackNo Track Name.mp3

2007-06-15T06:10:00.000Z	xbye	linuxgeekery	it's un-drm'd, standard mp3. I guess what I'm looking for is something that will copy the files into the music library, renamed to the right format
