2010-01-13T14:40:00.000Z	sa-evo		I am in need of some assistance with Ubuntu Netbook Remix. I have it running on a USB flash drive just as the guides say. Can I download and install programs on to this, or is it merely a live session that would still need installed?

2010-01-13T14:42:00.000Z	sa-evo	rww	Is it possible to install and boot off of a USB flash drive?
2010-01-13T14:42:00.000Z	rww	sa-evo	Maybe, if you put another flash drive in there and point the installer at it. I haven't tried it, though.
