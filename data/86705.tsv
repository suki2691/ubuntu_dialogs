2008-06-30T21:04:00.000Z	ASULutzy	miguelrsilva	 checking the md5 of the .iso means it downloaded properly. Just because it downloaded properly does not mean it burned properly. You should check the cd integrity from the boot menu
2008-06-30T21:06:00.000Z	ASULutzy	miguelrsilva	Again, you should really test the cd integrity from the live-cd itself, when it boots up pick test-cd integrity. Dropping to busy box usually points to a bad burn. If you're 100% sure the CD is good, then we could start trying to figure out what's up hardware wise, but you definitely should check the CD integrity first.
