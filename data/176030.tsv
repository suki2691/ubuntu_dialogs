2007-01-22T15:51:00.000Z	i687		Hello all
2007-01-22T15:52:00.000Z	i687		I was wondering, would u guys recommend me to go with the server edition of ubuntu 6.0 TLS or the edgy version?
2007-01-22T15:53:00.000Z	freaky_	i687	depends on what u use it for i guess... on servers i'd go with the TLS cuz it will have longer support
2007-01-22T15:56:00.000Z	freaky_	i687	yea security updates n such
