2005-10-16T09:30:00.000Z	CurseLinux		can anyone tell me how to permanently mount the windows file system?
2005-10-16T09:31:00.000Z	zoexii	CurseLinux	It has something to do with fstab,
2005-10-16T09:31:00.000Z	zoexii	CurseLinux	read the man page, and you will probably figure it out,
2005-10-16T09:31:00.000Z	zoexii	CurseLinux	you just have to add a line to the fstab config file or something like that.
