2010-08-14T01:03:00.000Z	Jinxed-		So my aunt has a virus on her usb stick and I had an idea, and i wanted to know if it would work. I was planning on burning the ubuntu live cd, booting it up plugging in the usb drive, copying the files she needs  Then I want to reformat the usb drive and completly wipe it out (any advice on how to do that would be appreciated) then download the filess
2010-08-14T01:04:00.000Z	Flannel	Jinxed-	That would work.  Assuming the virus wasn't piggybacking on any of the files (macroviruses or what have you)
2010-08-14T01:04:00.000Z	Jinxed-	Flannel	any other suggestions on a safer way to get the virus off her usb driver?
2010-08-14T01:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Jinxed-	That's certainly the safest
