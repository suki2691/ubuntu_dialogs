2007-05-03T11:11:00.000Z	ROnewbi2		 I'm trying to run freeciv; I get this error message:  / 0: Plugin 'alsa' isn't available. Available are [none, sdl]  /  - I'm quite sure Alsa is running, I think it only means the sdl plugins, am I right ? Which ones are those?
2007-05-03T11:12:00.000Z	void^	ROnewbi2	probably libsdl1.2debian-alsa
2007-05-03T11:14:00.000Z	ROnewbi2	void^	thanks, I'll give it a try
