2008-05-18T08:44:00.000Z	misngh		so talking about how ubuntu sucks is off topic? no one interested in fixing bugs and figuring otu what's wrong? explains a lot actually
2008-05-18T08:44:00.000Z	nixternal	misngh	yes, it is offtopic
2008-05-18T08:44:00.000Z	nixternal	misngh	don't come in here complaining about something, go to Launchpad and file a bug
2008-05-18T08:45:00.000Z	nixternal	misngh	that rocks! thanks!
