2009-05-14T09:36:00.000Z	Sagaci		i've got my main profile on ubuntu as my name with all privileges, is there a way to simply create another user with all those privileges minus administer the system and keep my settings (eg. theme, fonts, etc)?
2009-05-14T09:37:00.000Z	Sagaci		yes, all users
2009-05-14T09:38:00.000Z	Sagaci		just not the "administer the system" privilege
