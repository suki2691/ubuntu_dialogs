2005-07-30T07:58:00.000Z	Chalma		I just installed ubuntu and am getting used to the commands, I forgot to make a fat32 partition so I want to do one now, the fat32 part. will be called "shareddrive" and I want it to be 40GB, may I ask what the command for that would be?

2005-07-30T08:01:00.000Z	Chalma	kyncani	thanks I'll try that from terminal now
