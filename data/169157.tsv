2006-12-24T17:37:00.000Z	philo23		or will that give me hardly any space on my windows partition
2006-12-24T17:37:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	philo23	use the not used space (the one without partition)
2006-12-24T17:39:00.000Z	philo23	Ropechoborra	thats all well and good, but i cant partition it, it gives me an error
