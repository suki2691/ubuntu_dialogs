2007-07-30T07:57:00.000Z	Stuart_99		hey everyone...got a bit of a problem.  In addition to my forum problem, I tried to run Ubuntu on my Dell XPS M1210.  It worked :), but my wifi will NOT work.   What do I have to do to get it operational?  I'm using the wired connection on the livecd to get on IRC.  Thanks for your time.

2007-07-30T08:09:00.000Z	levander	Stuart_99	look in /etc/apt/sources.list
