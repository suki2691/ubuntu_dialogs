2011-10-10T09:09:00.000Z	julio33	arghx	good question, I have only 2 boxes, and when I use the linux box the other machine using wget went from 100KB/s to 0.1KB/s
2011-10-10T09:11:00.000Z	julio33	arghx	That's the strange thing, I disable the interface in the upper part of the screen and then still the other machine is slow, I was thinking that maybe is an error from the switch.
