2007-10-12T05:20:00.000Z	Zasch		Hello: I just downloaded Thunderbird, but I don't know how to install it. Can anyone assist? I extracted the directory, but I don't know where to go from here
2007-10-12T05:21:00.000Z	heguru	Zasch	why not use the one from repository? goto System -> Administration -> Synaptic and search for thunderbird
2007-10-12T05:22:00.000Z	Zasch	heguru	The one from the repository doesn't appear to be the latest one, and I don't know if the difference is significant or not
