2006-03-24T08:54:00.000Z	_mustard	Jimmey__	in a place that noone can access them :)
2006-03-24T08:54:00.000Z	_mustard	Jimmey__	unless you have the debconf bug when you installed and it copies your first password to the install log ;)
2006-03-24T08:55:00.000Z	_mustard	Jimmey__	you should be covered then
