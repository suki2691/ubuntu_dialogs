2007-07-04T15:43:00.000Z	Michael147		People im in desperate need of help. I have two machines, a laptop and a PC. My PC ran windows and my registry became corrupt, i then had to re-install the OS. Once i had re-installed i had no internet access because i havent got the NIC driver i need. Now the only place you can download this driver is from MS. So away i went on my linux box to download it and it turns out i cant because im a linux user running opera

Now i need somebody to go to the MS website who is using windows, download the driver for me and upload it to an FTP server for me to go and download so i can install it on my other machine. Any help will be greatly appreciated.
