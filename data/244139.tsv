2005-04-10T11:16:00.000Z	konstantinos		*question 3* [most important question!]  my desktop is moved a bit off screen to the right. I cannot set it to the correct position using the monitor's buttons, because then my windows xp desktop gets off-screen. is there a utility that allows me to do this kind of tinkering? I seem to remember mandrake had something like this. help!
