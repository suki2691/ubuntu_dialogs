2006-06-17T08:43:00.000Z	cparker		i'm having a problem adding a repo to Synaptic Package Manager. It's asking me to format an apt line, and I'm not really sure how to. The "repo" i'm trying to add is at http://people.ubuntu.com/~seb128/deb/
2006-06-17T08:45:00.000Z	cparker		so, anyone know what i would have to add to Synaptic Package Manager to get it to accept this repo? http://people.ubuntu.com/~seb128/deb/

2006-06-17T08:48:00.000Z	cparker	neutrinomass	okay, i've added this line: deb http://people.ubuntu.com/~seb128/deb/
