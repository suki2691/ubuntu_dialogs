2012-01-16T06:10:00.000Z	BarkingFish		evening guys. I'm gonna need your help on something.  Is there anyone here who has dealing with ubuntu's pools and mirrors/archives please?
2012-01-16T06:10:00.000Z	BarkingFish		Or do I need a different channel?
2012-01-16T06:10:00.000Z	bazhang	BarkingFish	ask away, and we'll try to get an answer
2012-01-16T06:11:00.000Z	BarkingFish	bazhang	sure.  I just had to refresh my packages in Kubuntu due to dpkg crashing during an update to KDE 4.7.4 - When I refreshed, I got the error "W: Failed to fetch gzip:/var/lib/apt/lists/partial/security.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_oneiric-security_main_binary-i386_Packages Hash Sum mismatch"
