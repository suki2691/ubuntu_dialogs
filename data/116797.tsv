2007-10-13T12:00:00.000Z	turgon		hello. how can I, from the command line, tell Ubuntu Feisty to use Metacity instead of Beryl next time I reboot? Thanks in advance for your time
2007-10-13T12:01:00.000Z	peertje888	turgon	can't you run metacity from another terminal? (ctrl+alt+F1 for example)
2007-10-13T12:03:00.000Z	peertje888		so my wireless problem has nothing to do with my inexperienced clicking in xconfig?
2007-10-13T12:04:00.000Z	turgon	peertje888	I'll try, I'll be back in a bit. Thx
