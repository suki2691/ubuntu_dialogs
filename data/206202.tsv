2006-09-22T07:07:00.000Z	LotsaCabo		I need to replace Win2K servers with Ubuntu and still have some type of INTEGRATED Windows login at the desktop.  Is this possible?  What can I use?  I have not done my homework yet on this (gotta head into a meeting in 9 minutes to discuss it).

2006-09-22T07:10:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	LotsaCabo	of course
2006-09-22T07:10:00.000Z	LotsaCabo	wickedpuppy	Wow. I have so ignored Samba over the years.
