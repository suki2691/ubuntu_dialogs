2007-01-26T07:22:00.000Z	foxure		Hello. How do i reconfigure ubuntus xserver when i have a new monitor?
2007-01-26T07:24:00.000Z	foxure		Both monitor have same resolution and are both 20"
2007-01-26T07:25:00.000Z	IdleOne	foxure	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and go with the defaults you should probably be fine
2007-01-26T07:26:00.000Z	foxure	IdleOne	I can't get that to work,, its stops with an error. It says that a tmp diretcory can't be deleted becuse its a file in there. And that the new file won't be made.
