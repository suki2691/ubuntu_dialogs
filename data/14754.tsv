2011-11-28T21:26:00.000Z	genii-around	AFD	python-software-properties is the package which contains the program add-apt-repository
2011-11-28T21:27:00.000Z	AFD	genii-around	thanks - I'll make sure that's installed first
2011-11-28T21:28:00.000Z	AFD	genii-around	I still get command not found after installing python-software-properties
