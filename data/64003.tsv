2010-11-05T21:43:00.000Z	xangua	rofl0r	thee next time you add repositories remember to also add the !gpg KEY, sudo add-apt-repository "ppa's name" does that automatically
2010-11-05T21:44:00.000Z	rofl0r	xangua	thanks, but i didnt add any repository ^^
2010-11-05T21:47:00.000Z	rofl0r	xangua	i did sudo apt-get install update, now the warning is gone
