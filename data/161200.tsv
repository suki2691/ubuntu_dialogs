2007-08-02T07:36:00.000Z	vb		I have a P3 850Mhz with 810 chipset running feisty, but I am not able to run beryl, googling figured out that it requires minimum 845 chipset, now I am thinking to buy a PCI card 32 MB VRAM to make beryl work, I do not have a AGP slot in my motherboard
2007-08-02T07:38:00.000Z	vb		can a PCI card with 32 MB RAM run BERYL ?
