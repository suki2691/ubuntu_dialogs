2010-01-15T00:50:00.000Z	ShishKabab	mike8i8	Brasero says I can't burn the DVD with the current set of plugins... Whatever that means...\
2010-01-15T00:54:00.000Z	ShishKabab	mike8i8	No, it doesn't. And Google doesn't tell me anything useful.
2010-01-15T01:00:00.000Z	ShishKabab	mike8i8	No luck. E: Package libdvdcss2 has no installation candidate. But I just found another program (for Window, yuck ;)). Thanks anyway for your help!
