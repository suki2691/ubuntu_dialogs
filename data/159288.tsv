2007-10-18T09:28:00.000Z	Cheetah		folks, I debootstrapped a feisty system to an usb stick and I'd like to use that on a little system (x86). unfortunately the system uses up 450 MB so far (no software installed) What can I possibly delete/optimize to safe space?
2007-10-18T09:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Cheetah	Have you setup a swap file / partition ?
2007-10-18T09:29:00.000Z	Cheetah	Jordan_U	no, I don't have a swap partition
2007-10-18T09:30:00.000Z	Cheetah	Jordan_U	basically, there are a lot of tools/apps/libs in the system that are possible not needed (take aptitude for example) and I'd like to get rid of them, leaving me with a really really minimal system
