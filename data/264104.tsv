2004-10-08T09:35:00.000Z	palfrey		I'm attempting to submit a bug on the ubuntu bugzilla, but every time I try I get "You must choose a component to file this bug in. If necessary, just guess". I've entered a valid package name (polypaudio-x11), but I keep getting this error. any ideas?

2004-10-08T09:38:00.000Z	krischan	palfrey	Probably, I'm not familiar with the formular. But component does not refer to the package. The concept of components is explained at http://www.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/components/document_view
