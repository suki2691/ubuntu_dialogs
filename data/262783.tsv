2004-11-13T09:46:00.000Z	mwh_	Todd_MA_1975	I was thinking to install it as a seperate system
2004-11-13T09:46:00.000Z	mwh_	Todd_MA_1975	so basically I should install warty and then change sources.list to get stuff from hoary
2004-11-13T09:47:00.000Z	Todd_MA_1975	mwh_	OK by me.... yeah do a upgrade after you change the sources list.  New packages are being added fairly often
