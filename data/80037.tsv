2012-10-13T00:48:00.000Z	flash_		Hi guys. I need a lifesaver. I have just accidentally copied one file to another location and overwritten the destination file. I need that file back. How do I do it?

2012-10-13T00:51:00.000Z	bekks	flash_	Nope.
2012-10-13T00:51:00.000Z	bekks	flash_	Do you have the original file still open in some vim?
