2009-11-10T13:25:00.000Z	a-rishi		Alright, another thing: I am using empathy for IRC, how can I disable the '[some-user] has connecteced' or '[some-user]' has disconnected. There are too many of them coming :P
2009-11-10T13:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	a-rishi	I am sure there is a way to disable it, but for other reasons IRC just doesn't work well with anything but a dedication IRC client
2009-11-10T13:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	a-rishi	Try xchat if you use IRC a lot, or for more feature rich clients try quassel or irssi
2009-11-10T13:27:00.000Z	a-rishi	Jordan_U	Ya, I will try those too
