I have 3 logs saved of failures, and I'm curious if anyone would be able to tell me if it's a hardware or software related issue by looking at the logs? They all fail in the same section of the burn and it shouldn't be the .iso since I've tried multiple.

2010-06-10T04:32:00.000Z	BabyJesus		Sorry, h00k
