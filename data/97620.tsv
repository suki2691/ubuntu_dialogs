2008-07-15T06:24:00.000Z	emosamurai		I have a computer with an athlon 64-bit x2 chip. What kind of assembly language does it use?
2008-07-15T06:24:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	emosamurai	there are no kinds of Assembly language...it follows the instruction set of x86
2008-07-15T06:27:00.000Z	emosamurai	arvind_khadri	So if I have an athlon 64-bit x2 chip, then I can run I32 on it?
2008-07-15T06:28:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	emosamurai	yeah you can... 32 bit can run in 64 bit but not the vice-versa
