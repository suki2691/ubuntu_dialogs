2009-06-23T00:03:00.000Z	mdm	oshekfeh	bad sector repair is called mark it bad and trash anything that was on it, replace the hard drive now, and hope no more sectors go bad before you can salvage whatever is left
2009-06-23T00:04:00.000Z	oshekfeh	mdm	thanks for your response, but Please explain more, do you mean that there are no solution for bad sector except replacing the harddisk??
