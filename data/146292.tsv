2008-04-25T07:17:00.000Z	Skuller		I try booting off a 7.10 live desktop CD but after the orange bar going back and forth it just leaves me at a command prompt kind of place with a 'busybox' title at the top. This does not happen with a 7.04 CD on the same PC. Any suggestions? I tried ctrl-alt-F4 with no luck and neither with F6

2008-04-25T07:19:00.000Z	Skuller	shane2peru	No, I don't at the moment and I don't have the connection speed to download it quickly either, have to do with 7.10 or 7.04 (this one works)
2008-04-25T07:21:00.000Z	Skuller	shane2peru	Yes I did
