2008-04-16T04:43:00.000Z	nickrud	dman92	yup. I used to have one so I could use localhost:631 to admin cups, but it's patched now in ubuntu
2008-04-16T04:44:00.000Z	dman92	nickrud	i had one for some reason before. no more
2008-04-16T04:44:00.000Z	nickrud	dman92	not for the last two releases myself, anyway
