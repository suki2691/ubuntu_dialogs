2009-09-05T08:40:00.000Z	mythomaniac		when i issue this command sudo aptitude install linux-ubuntu-modules-`uname -r` linux-generic i get this: couldn't find any package whose name or description matched "linux-ubuntu-modules-2.6.28.15-generic" - this was supposed to install the sound modules as stated from this wiki, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - i think ubuntu needs update the wiki to help people :/
