2006-01-18T08:37:00.000Z	Crema10		I installed 5.10 and its great, but there are a couple of problems.. first problem that is most important, is when I log out it goes to a black screen and it says "ubuntu long:" I type in my user name, but nothing, it gives me another login.. I was hoping that when i log out, it would take me to the log in screen that you first get at bootup
2006-01-18T08:39:00.000Z	Crema10		anybody? please?
