2008-01-20T07:06:00.000Z	wyclif	ToxicSoul	am considering installing fluxbox since GNOME is not lean and mean enough for me.  how do you like it?
2008-01-20T07:07:00.000Z	wyclif		i remember blackbox and how great that was, so...it seems natural
2008-01-20T07:07:00.000Z	ToxicSoul	wyclif	I've used it once or twice and have come to like it but for some reason it doesn't want to work right on my desktop here =\
