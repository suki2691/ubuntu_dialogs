2006-12-20T06:52:00.000Z	conn		hi, I'm using kubuntu with gnome apps, and I'm wondering how I can change the gnome icon theme to Human and make it persist in KDE? It seems to default to the "industrial" theme in KDE, and "Human" in GNOME. I want it to by Human in both environments
2006-12-20T06:53:00.000Z	Stormx2	conn	Theres a kubuntu human theme?
2006-12-20T06:54:00.000Z	conn	Stormx2	no, you misunderstand. I have the Human theme installed that's part of ubuntu-desktop, an I want GNOME apps to use that theme while my desktop is set to KDE...
2006-12-20T06:55:00.000Z	Stormx2	conn	Ah. Not sure why
