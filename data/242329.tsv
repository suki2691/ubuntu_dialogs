2009-05-13T09:13:00.000Z	jbmigel	appleiiguy	why dont you use your monitor settings for that?
2009-05-13T09:14:00.000Z	jbmigel	appleiiguy	maybe there is a refresh for it to autoconfig... all lcd have something
2009-05-13T09:16:00.000Z	jbmigel	appleiiguy	maybe a different resolution would change how much of the screen it fills?
