2008-08-12T16:52:00.000Z	RandyboY		I installed the gtkorphan package(graphical tool to find and remove orphaned libraries) from the Add/remove... menu and removed orphna files. But after that my dell laptop cant connect with the wireless device, only cabled nic. There were lotsa lib's being removed. How can i find and reinstall the needed libs/drivers?

2008-08-12T16:52:00.000Z	Chousuke	RandyboY	your best bet would be to reinstall the ubuntu-desktop package
2008-08-12T16:52:00.000Z	Chousuke	RandyboY	in case gtkorphan removed any core libs
