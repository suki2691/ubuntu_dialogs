2010-02-27T07:47:00.000Z	sha0		Good day.  I installed gsnes9x but have no idea what the binary is...  How do I see which files were installed, if you please?
2010-02-27T07:48:00.000Z	trism	sha0	dpkg -L gsnes9x; will list all the files installed
2010-02-27T07:48:00.000Z	sha0	trism	dpkg.  Thanks so much!
2010-02-27T07:49:00.000Z	sha0	trism	Wouldn't you know it's "GSnes9x".  Thanks again.
