2012-09-23T20:31:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob		Hello, I'm having difficulty installing ubuntu
2012-09-23T20:33:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob		I downloaded the 12.04 ISO, and used Daemon Tools Pro to burn it onto a DVD. I booted my computer from the disk and checked it for defaults, of which there are none. I go to install alongside Windows 7. It brings up a Command Line Interface with a load of text, ejects the disk  and says "Please remove installation media and close the tray (if any) then press ENTER
2012-09-23T20:33:00.000Z	UbuntuNoob		How can I fix this?
