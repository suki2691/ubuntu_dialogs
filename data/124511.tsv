2008-05-30T20:22:00.000Z	jonlanglois		Okay, so a different Hardy question...my IDE drives were recognized as /dev/hda and /dev/hdb in Feisty, but are now /dev/sda and /dev/sdb.  Is that a bug, or intended behavior?

2008-05-30T20:24:00.000Z	chuy_max	jonlanglois	every disk now is recognized as sd?, there was a reason for it
2008-05-30T20:25:00.000Z	chuy_max	jonlanglois	so it works now?
