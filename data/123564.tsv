2007-08-26T11:16:00.000Z	Kenvyro		oh gosh I made it! I'm on ubuntu now ^^ however I seem to be running it from live cd, so it isn't installed yet... anyone care with my small partition problem
2007-08-26T11:18:00.000Z	Kenvyro		Okay thanks, so uh I already have some partitioned space and one is with windows on it, one with music and one with movies. Im trying to delete the Windows partition and install Ubuntu, however after I successfully delete it and trying to go forward I get this: "No root file system is defined. Please correct this from the partitioning menu."

2007-08-26T11:22:00.000Z	Kenvyro	astro76	Okay, I am in GParted now, but honestly I don't know what to start with.
