2008-07-27T03:56:00.000Z	dblick		Hi guys. I'm wondering about how to use IPv6. I have a computer at my university that gets assigned an IPv4 address that's not accessible from outside the university network. Is it possible for me to request an IPv6 address that would be accessible?
2008-07-27T03:56:00.000Z	dblick		Sorry, if that's unclear, the IPv4 address is 172.28.26.177 - it's not a firewall, just a ...subnet?... address.
