2006-04-23T12:14:00.000Z	klaxian		i just upgraded to dapper on my laptop and the screen is a little grainy...it's not so noticeable that I can't work, but I can definitely see it
2006-04-23T12:14:00.000Z	klaxian		has anyone else had that problem?
2006-04-23T12:14:00.000Z	FlannelKing	klaxian	ask the people on dapper ;) (#ubuntu+1)
2006-04-23T12:14:00.000Z	klaxian	FlannelKing	ah, sorry
