2007-10-22T12:54:00.000Z	scguy318	lock1	you dont really need drivers for a monitor, but I'm guessing you want to use the max resolutions?
2007-10-22T12:55:00.000Z	lock1	scguy318	Well what happens is I try to configure them, and it seems to confuse which is my main monitor and which is the secondary and cuts them in half etc. I can't get it to work right at any resolution...
2007-10-22T12:55:00.000Z	scguy318	lock1	hmm, not too sure about multimonitor setups
