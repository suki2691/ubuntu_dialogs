2007-01-22T17:17:00.000Z	wolfwalker		Quick question from a newb: If I installed yahoo IM in Wine, would it be able to connect to the internet through the wine app layer?
2007-01-22T17:17:00.000Z	wims	wolfwalker	 probably
2007-01-22T17:18:00.000Z	wims	wolfwalker	 but there are other native apps that can use the yahoo im protocol iirc
2007-01-22T17:36:00.000Z	wims	wolfwalker	uTorrent through wine is the best option for me
