2009-03-09T07:35:00.000Z	gegemaw		Needing some quick help on piping a terminal command am entering into a file.. something like "echo hello world! | >~/test.txt"
2009-03-09T07:36:00.000Z	gegemaw		Thanks all :)
2009-03-09T07:37:00.000Z	khaije1	gegemaw	also i think 'echo "hello world" | cat >> ~/somefile' works as well, no?
2009-03-09T07:40:00.000Z	gegemaw	khaije1	nah...the cat command after the piper gives a "Broken Piper" error.... but the others have wroked... special echo "text" >> file... as it appends a new line
