2008-09-08T07:32:00.000Z	cgrapski		Can anyone help.  I tried intalling with WUBU and get the option between XP and Ubuntu.  But when I choose Ubuntu I just come back to that screen.
2008-09-08T07:34:00.000Z	cgrapski		I meant that I get that screen upon boot.  And come back (without booting ubuntu) to that screen when choosing ubuntu.  Booting XP works fine.
2008-09-08T07:35:00.000Z	Gnea	cgrapski	check that first URL
2008-09-08T07:36:00.000Z	cgrapski	Gnea	OK will try that.
