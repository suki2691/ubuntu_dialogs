2008-11-03T13:33:00.000Z	thetank		if i used intrepid backports will i be able to install qbittorent, and if true what is the source
2008-11-03T13:35:00.000Z	ziroday	thetank	no package exists for qbittorrent in ubuntu
2008-11-03T13:36:00.000Z	ziroday	thetank	however its in debian lenny, so hopefully by next release it will be in the repos
