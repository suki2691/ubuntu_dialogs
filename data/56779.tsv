2009-12-06T20:16:00.000Z	jtaji	petsounds	hmm wallet server.. not sure... but in xchat prefs you should set "auto accept file transfer" to no because sometimes idiots on IRC try to send you files repeatedly
2009-12-06T20:16:00.000Z	jtaji	petsounds	and you get 100 windows like that
2009-12-06T20:17:00.000Z	petsounds	jtaji	: no it's not file transfer it's happen when i open kde apps.
