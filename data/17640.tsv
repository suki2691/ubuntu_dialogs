2011-07-04T05:15:00.000Z	tdignan	KM0201	I selected manual partitioning. Are you saying I have to use fdisk/cfdisk?
2011-07-04T05:19:00.000Z	tdignan	KM0201	the only options the installer gives me are "install alongside windows 7, replace windows 7 with ubuntu, and 'Something else'" of which I chose, something else.
