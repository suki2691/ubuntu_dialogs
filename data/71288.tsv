2008-12-24T06:20:00.000Z	elliottm		I'm running 64-bit kubuntu, and I have 4gb of ram installed, but linux is only seeing 3.2gb of it. I ran memtest86 on moth modules individusally, and there were no errors
2008-12-24T06:21:00.000Z	elliottm		why isn't ubuntu recognizing all of my ram?
2008-12-24T06:22:00.000Z	gogzmer	elliottm	perhaps it doesn't like sheep?
2008-12-24T06:22:00.000Z	elliottm	gogzmer	nice try, but it was certified sheep compatible
