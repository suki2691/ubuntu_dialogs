2009-09-02T05:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	peepsalot	sometimes not all packages for whatever reason/s  can be installed, but then  it says you can do a partial upgrade
2009-09-02T05:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	peepsalot	and so you do that
2009-09-02T05:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	peepsalot	then the updates will  just  take care of them self later on,  when you do another update, or something like that
