2010-06-04T18:50:00.000Z	domedagen		I can't pick streamci.dll from the new override drop menu. I've download the file and placed it in system32. Help
2010-06-04T18:51:00.000Z	airtonix	domedagen	you didn't read the winehq howto.
2010-06-04T18:51:00.000Z	airtonix	domedagen	also this is not a ubuntu problem, ask in #winehq or #wine
2010-06-04T18:54:00.000Z	domedagen	airtonix	the howto does not say anything about that?
