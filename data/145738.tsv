2007-02-24T10:16:00.000Z	Phasor		I've downloaded Ubuntu 6.10 for i386 and checked the MD5sum. They both match. I've burnt the ISO file to CD and inserted it into my computer rebooted, and loaded up the first menu. I then selected the Check CD for Defects option. It got to 56% of the kernel loaded and then stopped and said: Disk Error 80, AX = 4200, driver 9F. This has now happened twice on two different CDs. Is there anything I can do? Do you think I should try installing 6.06?
