2006-11-07T08:03:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Cuog_422	you set that by the permissions on the files/directories themselves or you run the command as root
2006-11-07T08:03:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Cuog_422	chmod is the command
2006-11-07T08:04:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Cuog_422	for a text file, to set it so anyone can read or write it, chmod 666 file.txt
