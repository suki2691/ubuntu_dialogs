2009-10-23T13:31:00.000Z	imyousuf		Anybody knows why my TimeZone got changed out of the blue, I am in  Bangladesh (+6/+7), it was +7 till yesterday and today after tzdata package was updated it is +6 :(, any body knows how I can revert back? I missed a meeting for this :( (rerun)

2009-10-23T13:33:00.000Z	imyousuf	theadmin	not so simple as I also have to check times of other places :(
2009-10-23T13:33:00.000Z	theadmin	imyousuf	Dunno if that's even possible
