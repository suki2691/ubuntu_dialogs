2006-06-04T14:35:00.000Z	hajuu		When using the Breezy kernel in a Hoary install, I get errors on startup... Something along the lines of "sed - Unsupported Command I".. I get it several times, and then everything appears to boot normally, but if I try to start something, I get wierd forking errors.. Anyone got any ideas?
2006-06-04T14:35:00.000Z	hajuu		Whats sed?
2006-06-04T14:37:00.000Z	hajuu		Ok well there MUST be a way to get the legacy nvidia drivers onto my hoary kernel surely surely
