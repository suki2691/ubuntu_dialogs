2007-06-20T14:04:00.000Z	jonty		anyone: having problem with windows crashing slightly - the close, minimise etc buttons don't work. Can't find if this bug is reported anywhere. Anyone know anything about this?
2007-06-20T14:04:00.000Z	RAOF	jonty	You'd be using Compiz or Beryl or Desktop Effects, right?
2007-06-20T14:08:00.000Z	RAOF	jonty	That's odd.  The problem is probably that metacity (the Gnome window manager, which among other things is responsible for the window titlebars) isnt starting.
2007-06-20T14:14:00.000Z	RAOF	jonty	Well, that's weird.  I therefore don't know.  I don't even know what could be causing that!
