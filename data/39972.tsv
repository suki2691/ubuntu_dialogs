2010-03-16T13:55:00.000Z	hmw	brontosaurusrex	usually you can do that within the VBox... i think it is HOST+D or some menu entry
2010-05-05T22:56:00.000Z	hmw	brontosaurusrex	i'd guess etx2 would do the trick in any case
2010-05-05T22:57:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	hmw	ok, can i format on winxp (cos thats the only box i have on that place) or ... ?
