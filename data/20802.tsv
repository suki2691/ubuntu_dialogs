2011-09-01T18:40:00.000Z	jnsl_		i want too!
2011-09-01T18:41:00.000Z	BarkingFish	jnsl_	it's not bad to open 3306 if you're using mysql, since mysql uses 3306 for connections
2011-09-01T18:49:00.000Z	BarkingFish	jnsl_	sorry, I don't.  I only have default ports open on here, and I've never tried to open others.
