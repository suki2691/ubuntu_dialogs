2010-08-18T00:16:00.000Z	thune3	Skaja	what kind of mp3 player?
2010-08-18T00:24:00.000Z	thune3	Skaja	i'm having trouble determining if it is mtp or msc device. rhythmbox is supposed to work with it out-of-the-box. Have you plugged it in?
2010-08-18T00:37:00.000Z	thune3	Skaja	it's really hard to tell what is happening. You should be able to start rhythmbox and plug it in, and then see it in rhythmbox. It would help to see "dmesg | tail -n 50" *after* you plug it in. Could you pastebin this output?
