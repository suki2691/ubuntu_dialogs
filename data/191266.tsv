2007-12-08T08:54:00.000Z	killerbeesateme	bulmer	I'm actually on the system now.  Everything runs fine, unless i do anything upgrade/install wise with apt, then the system hangs
2007-12-08T08:55:00.000Z	killerbeesateme	bulmer	 I can't install or upgrade any packages.  I normally wouldn't mind, but doing a reset via the button to install packages is not the greatest way to go
