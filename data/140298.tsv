2007-04-04T15:33:00.000Z	GrueTamer		when i try to launch games in ubuntu, they crash the entire system 90% of the time.  my video drivers are updated as far as i can tell, but feel free to tell me im wrong.  does anybody have any ideas what to do?

2007-04-04T15:35:00.000Z	GrueTamer	pike_	i think its just X, but theres no way for me to do anything but reboot
2007-04-04T15:36:00.000Z	pike_	GrueTamer	id check the logs i guess.. is your system up to date?
