2010-10-05T11:57:00.000Z	Ascavasaion		I have a bluetooth dongle in my laptop, it works because I can send and receive files from cellphones.  I am trying to use it to connect to my cellphone and use it as a modem.  I set up a connection through NetworkManager Applet but it does not show as an option when I want to connect.  I then created a rfcomm.conf file, and an /etc/ppp/bluetooth dialup file, and nothing.  rfcomm -a shows nothing.  there is no rfcomm entry in /dev ei
