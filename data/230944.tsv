2005-06-26T08:24:00.000Z	Rounin		Hey... I installed Ubuntu on my laptop a while ago, but when it came to booting it up, it killed init, citing some problem with the graphics I believe... Anyone have any idea what that could be about?
2005-06-26T08:24:00.000Z	Rounin		Could I have fixed it by booting with nofb or something in that order?
2005-06-26T08:25:00.000Z	dantheman64	Rounin	have you tried booting into the recovery mode and looking at the logs?
2005-06-26T08:27:00.000Z	Rounin	dantheman64	Nah... I nistalled Fedora Core instead... :P I wonder if I have a partition where I could try again though
