2008-11-12T03:34:00.000Z	faryshta	natalisushka	what I do is to use the network manager to get a fixed IP on ethernet connection, then use that ip instead of localhost.
2008-11-12T03:35:00.000Z	faryshta		By example the IP I have on ethernet connection is 123.213.132.231 then on the broswer place http://123.etc/
2008-11-12T03:36:00.000Z	natalisushka	faryshta	ok, but that sucks! in my php scripts I have specified some configurations that detect localhost as the http_host! I don't want to change that, isn't there an other way?
