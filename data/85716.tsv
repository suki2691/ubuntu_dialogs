2008-11-20T20:24:00.000Z	deuterium		another question: if i exchange the network card by a different model (i replaced a e1000 by a realtek 8139), do i need to tell ubuntu about it so it can access the network again?
2008-11-20T20:24:00.000Z	Jeruvy	deuterium	sure, but make sure the card is 'supported' first.
2008-11-20T20:26:00.000Z	deuterium	Jeruvy	is there a ubuntu tool for configuring the network settings (i.e. tell ubuntu about the changed nic)?
2008-11-20T20:26:00.000Z	Jeruvy	deuterium	ifconfig, network settings.  probably some others too
