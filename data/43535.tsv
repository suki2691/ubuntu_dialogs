2010-04-23T02:11:00.000Z	windgat		I've been out of the gaming scene for quite a while now; can anyone tell me a bit more about steam?
2010-04-23T02:12:00.000Z	windgat		I gather that it's a gaming content delivery platform, but doe sthat mean that I will be able to play all those other games that have been unavailable to us until now, on my linux system?
