2011-11-30T09:14:00.000Z	paulmeter		sure but... i remenber when in installed ubuntu 11.10 and booted it said something about backup a password
2011-11-30T09:14:00.000Z	paulmeter		but if you said i dont need it, ok
2011-11-30T09:19:00.000Z	paulmeter	CarlFK	so if i reinstall ubuntu the key is not deleted?
