2011-04-17T02:58:00.000Z	Haitham		Guys, what can I do to get my laptop's keyboard working during Ubuntu installation or even while trying it out?
2011-04-17T02:59:00.000Z	Haitham		It\s totally down (the keyboard)
2011-04-17T02:59:00.000Z	guntbert	Haitham	does it work with  other distros? (like knoppix, suse,....)
2011-04-17T03:01:00.000Z	Haitham	guntbert	haven't tried yet, but I got Knoppix (live CD) burnt
