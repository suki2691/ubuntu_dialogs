2008-10-09T13:57:00.000Z	firestorm_		how can i check on the command line if a certain program is installed?
2008-10-09T13:57:00.000Z	Slart	firestorm_	dpkg -l | grep -i progamname perhaps?
2008-10-09T13:57:00.000Z	firestorm_	Slart	was thinkin something more apt-get related
2008-10-09T13:59:00.000Z	Slart	firestorm_	apt-cache search --installed <packagename> might work too
