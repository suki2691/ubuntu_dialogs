2012-08-07T00:31:00.000Z	DarkAceZ		let's say I want to backup my entire ubuntu installation... Would it work to compress it after it's copied to another hard drive?
2012-08-07T00:32:00.000Z	deadmund	DarkAceZ	why would you compress it AFTER it's copied?
2012-08-07T00:32:00.000Z	deadmund	DarkAceZ	Sure, why wouldn't compressing work?
2012-08-07T00:34:00.000Z	deadmund	DarkAceZ	I've never tried it but a symlink can be compressed without any issues.
