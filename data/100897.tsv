2010-01-14T08:09:00.000Z	thiemster	abojuser	try debian instead. it takes a little longer to figure out, but since you have used ubuntu you should be able to easily use it. I myself have 512mb ram and ubuntu ran quickly for about a month, but then seemed to get gradually slower. switching to debian a few months ago really helped
