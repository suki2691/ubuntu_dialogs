2008-02-23T11:58:00.000Z	noclue		quick question... i'm thinking of upgrading my video card. Given that the only graphic intensive things i'll be doing is playing WoW, running MythTV frontend, and possibly running Compiz Fusion/Beryl, which manufacturer's card/driver has the best support/performance on a linux machine? ATI or Nvidia?
