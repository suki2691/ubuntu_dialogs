2012-02-20T20:34:00.000Z	Zerpex		hmm, I used passwd user1, updated the password, but when I try log in with that user, it says password is wrong
2012-02-20T20:35:00.000Z	zykotick9	Zerpex	are you user1?  if so the command should have been "passwd", to set another user's password it would need "sudo passwd user1" to work.
2012-02-20T20:35:00.000Z	Zerpex	zykotick9	no I'm user 2, and I used the sudo command
2012-02-20T20:38:00.000Z	Zerpex	zykotick9	hmm :S it's really weird
