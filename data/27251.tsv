2010-08-23T22:27:00.000Z	FastReading	ilovefairuz	the lucid ISO he wants to transfer to the usb you mean? or whether or not lucid supports the "dd" command?
2010-08-23T22:29:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	FastReading	not sure that the lucid livecd supports being written to a usb pendrive using dd (unlike more "intelligent" approaches like the one unetbootin uses)
