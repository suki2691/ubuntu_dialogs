2012-07-08T16:16:00.000Z	moljac024		is there a package that needs to be installed for software center to be able to display screenshots? a package that's not a dependency maybe?
2012-07-08T16:17:00.000Z	moljac024		maybe some part of gnome? i'm not using gnome at all

2012-07-08T16:17:00.000Z	moljac024	ikonia	i know, but i can't see screenshots even for those that have them
