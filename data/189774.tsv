2010-11-15T22:27:00.000Z	martin_		hi anyone, does anyone have any ideas what's causing my weird problem? Is it a setting somewhere? thanks
2010-11-15T22:29:00.000Z	martin_		I already have, but ok. When I go to Places, and open any of the folders contained therein, instead of opening the folder, a media player opens and plays any media files in said folder. Which is odd. My question is: How is this turned back to normal? thanks
