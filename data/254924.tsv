2005-02-03T16:30:00.000Z	zAo^		how can I start egg aMSN and let it start on my 4th workspace ? ($ amsn 0:4 ????)
2005-02-03T08:18:00.000Z	zAo^		Who can advise me? I Have a ATI radeon 9600 PRO, but it is laggy (DRI is on). Should I buy a Gforce FX5200?
2005-02-03T08:19:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	zAo^	an FX5200 won't be much better, you'd really need a 5700+ for reasonable performance
2005-02-03T08:20:00.000Z	zAo^	HrdwrBoB	thanks. Never ATI for me agian. I'll wait..
