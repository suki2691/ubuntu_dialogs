2006-03-02T11:36:00.000Z	smock9		what is the difference between apt-get, "Add applications", and "synaptic package manager"
2006-03-02T11:38:00.000Z	smock9		but they do the same thing other than gui vs command line
2006-03-02T11:40:00.000Z	smock9		does apt-get and synaptic get apps from the same place?
2006-03-02T11:40:00.000Z	_jason	smock9	yes
