2005-10-28T07:00:00.000Z	fdr		Hello... I was wondering, what exactly is the ubuntu launchpad? Are new bugs to be submitted via launchpad, or through bugzilla as usual? Thank you!

2005-10-28T07:02:00.000Z	fdr	apokryphos	thank you. Lol, sounds like a step backwards in usability to me: two interfaces for bugreporting instead of one... Anyway, are launchpad accounts migrated from bugzilla, or should I create my own new account?
