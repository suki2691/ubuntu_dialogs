2009-05-30T20:12:00.000Z	computer13137		Hi.  I'm trying to setup a little VNC accessible box.  In Ubuntu 8.10 I had no trouble doing this, but for some reason, it's not working this time.  I used apt-get to install xfce4 and vnc4server, as well as all the dependencies obviously.  I then put in my little custom xstartup script, and it's not working properly.
