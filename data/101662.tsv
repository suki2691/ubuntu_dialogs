2010-04-13T08:57:00.000Z	Spoom		hi folks, could someone point me to a good tutorial or reference for cheap hardware and software setup for creating a small ubuntu network?  google hasn't quite found it for me, and i'm looking for some low-cost ideas for a youth center my wife runs
2010-04-13T08:57:00.000Z	Spoom		my guess is that i would need a switch of some variety?
2010-04-13T08:58:00.000Z	Spoom		or would offtopic be good?
