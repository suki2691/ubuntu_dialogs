2010-01-16T21:28:00.000Z	Queops		Hello everyone. I have a problem: fresh instal of ubuntu, installed lampp (from xampp) I got all my files on the opt folder. However, I'd like to do some simple work with the default file managar, drag and drop files, change permissions etc etc, but of course, I don't have permissions to do so. I looked around in guides I can't find a way to fix this.
