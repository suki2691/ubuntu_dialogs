2010-10-18T08:40:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	quiescens	okay, I have never seen that wording, and I've looked at hundreds of lspci outputs on dozens of computers over 10 years, Linux 2.2 through 2.6.  most likely that is from "lshw" or another similar app that is similar to lspci.  or maybe /proc/pci, which used to exist.
