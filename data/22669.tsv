2010-11-16T04:31:00.000Z	goltoof	mac^^^	 my ati setup was a convoluted nightmare, but i eventually got it working 99%... that other 1% being the screen would occassionally turn into something from the matrix and my system would totally freeze,  no bueno
2010-11-16T04:31:00.000Z	mac^^^	goltoof	perhaps you push it to the limit, I just do 2d stuff
2010-11-16T04:33:00.000Z	goltoof	mac^^^	 i wish i was into 3d stuff, getting there.. but yea even with nothing running it'd just freeze the whole screen... who knows why these things happen on diff ards
