2012-02-20T00:04:00.000Z	Guest22511		Hello, I'm a thirteen year old interested in helping developing ubuntu, but I would like help learning ways around..... Can someone teach me the programming skills necessary?
2012-02-20T00:05:00.000Z	royale1222	Guest22511	start with c and cpp.
2012-02-20T00:06:00.000Z	royale1222	Guest22511	make your own cli programs first, use ncurses next..
2012-02-20T00:07:00.000Z	royale1222	Guest22511	then shift to real gui, gtk etc for your program..
