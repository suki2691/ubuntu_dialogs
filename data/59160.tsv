2009-11-17T06:51:00.000Z	m_tadeu		hi all...how can I upgrade from 8.04 to 9.10 using the command line?
2009-11-17T06:52:00.000Z	VCoolio	m_tadeu	that would include upgrading to 8.10 and 9.04 first; better install clean if your home is on a different partition
2009-11-17T06:52:00.000Z	m_tadeu	VCoolio	it's clean :) do you know the command?
2009-11-17T06:54:00.000Z	VCoolio	m_tadeu	apt-get dist-upgrade but I don't know if you need to switch on the possibility of upgrading first somewhere
