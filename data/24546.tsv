2011-06-15T04:58:00.000Z	scarleo		great, I'm just trying to understand, If I need to send an encrypted mail to someone, all they have to do is have their mail address registered on a key server with their public key, right?

2011-06-15T05:00:00.000Z	scarleo	Corey	Well if I have pgp support in mail client, and they are registered, then we don't need to exchange keys? Because I suppose I encrypt the messages I send with his public key. Have I understood this correct?
