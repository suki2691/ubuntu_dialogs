2012-09-24T19:11:00.000Z	Pricey	_XMENDES	Check out https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Xbox360Media#UPnP_sharing_with_uShare (A google suggests wdtv works with dlna devices in the same way as the xbox)
2012-09-24T19:11:00.000Z	Pricey	_XMENDES	actually ignore those instructions!!! ushare should be part of the standard repository..
2012-09-24T19:12:00.000Z	Pricey	_XMENDES	I'd look into ushare. "sudo apt-get install ushare".
