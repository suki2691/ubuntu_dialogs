2011-09-27T03:50:00.000Z	prod_		Hi all, I have a very silly friend who tryed to fix his windows machine by reinstalling via the built in automated installer. Then realised he had formatted his whole drive and reinstalled and forgettin to backup his family photos. Which program would you recommend me using to track down deleted files?
