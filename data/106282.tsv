2008-04-20T02:26:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	iclebyte	 the loopback addy is there by default and it is possible that removing it will break some things.  windows' hosts file contains this as well iirc.
2008-04-20T02:28:00.000Z	iclebyte	zionpsyfer	any idea what it will break?...
2008-04-20T02:29:00.000Z	iclebyte	zionpsyfer	surely 127.0.0.1 is enough?
