2008-04-06T17:44:00.000Z	xs142		Is there any way to switch between for example ubuntu and gentoo without reinstalling and/or formating?
2008-04-06T17:44:00.000Z	astro76	xs142	sure you can dual/multi-boot with multiple linux installs
2008-04-06T17:45:00.000Z	xs142	astro76	rather want to exchange it all together
2008-04-06T17:45:00.000Z	astro76	xs142	then you need to re-install... one distros setup/packagin system/ install system has little to nothing to do with another
