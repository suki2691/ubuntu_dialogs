2011-03-03T11:33:00.000Z	th0r	trytohaxme	we can't answer a question you haven't asked
2011-03-03T11:35:00.000Z	th0r	trytohaxme	you have to move to a vt (Alt-F2), log in there, and kill X. Then you can install the drivers from the command line
2011-03-03T11:36:00.000Z	th0r	trytohaxme	I would find the process and kill the number
