2008-12-29T04:16:00.000Z	kitche	err__	hasn't had an issue in a few years
2008-12-29T04:17:00.000Z	kitche	err__	the 3+ is a x86 architecture limit so it's not linux it's the x86 architecture
2008-12-29T04:18:00.000Z	kitche	err__	if you have more then 3 gigs of ram you need to use PAE or use amd64(if you have a amd64 machine)
