2009-07-14T23:31:00.000Z	Alan		has a load of broken updates been pushed to the repository?  i'm getting stuff like "libssl-dev: Depends: libssl0.9.8 (= 0.9.8g-15ubuntu3) but 0.9.8g-15ubuntu3.2 is installed."
2009-07-14T23:32:00.000Z	Alan		i've run apt-get update, and that hasn't helped...
2009-07-14T23:32:00.000Z	fccf	Alan	do you have the updates repository enabled?
2009-07-14T23:33:00.000Z	Alan	fccf	gah, how the hell did that get disabled? :| thanks!
