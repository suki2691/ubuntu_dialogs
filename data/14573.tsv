2011-05-20T16:01:00.000Z	abrakazam	brubelsa1s	depends what you want to do with it
2011-05-20T16:02:00.000Z	brubelsa1s	abrakazam	Easy to use, to maintain, system, with high flexibility.. (as ubuntu, but better, in terms of hardware support, error regression, etc..)
2011-05-20T16:03:00.000Z	abrakazam	brubelsa1s	hardware support mostly depends on the kernel and not on the distribution
