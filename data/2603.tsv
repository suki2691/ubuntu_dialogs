2012-06-16T18:48:00.000Z	bavarian001		Tried to install 11.04 on a RAID o, but the bootloader could not be installed. Is RAID 0 not possible?
2012-06-16T18:49:00.000Z	mz|`	bavarian001	depends where you try to install it
2012-06-16T18:58:00.000Z	mz|`	bavarian001	choose the good location to install Grub ?
