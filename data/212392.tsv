2006-05-26T09:29:00.000Z	eapache		I can't seem to run executables... I double click them and nothing happens. I have checked nautilus options and selected 'run', not view...
2006-05-26T09:30:00.000Z	andrejkw	eapache	what kind of executables?
2006-05-26T09:30:00.000Z	andrejkw	eapache	because some may need to be run in the terminal
2006-05-26T09:31:00.000Z	andrejkw	eapache	that doesn't mean they contain a User Interface
