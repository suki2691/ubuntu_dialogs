2007-10-20T23:50:00.000Z	crdlb	ConstyXIV	Xgl is essentially an abstraction layer that makes compiz work on using only 3d acceleration (no special driver features needed)
2007-10-20T23:51:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	crdlb	so if you've got compiz working anyways, do you need (or get any advantage from) it for anything?
