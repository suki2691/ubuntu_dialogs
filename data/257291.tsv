2005-04-18T14:04:00.000Z	aquarius	kent	yes. But do I not have to mention something about the interface on my computer in /ec/network/interfaces?
2005-04-18T14:05:00.000Z	kent	aquarius	I have never setup a dhcp-server, but I dont think you do that in /etc/network/interfaces, that file is for your local cards. I think uoi have to look in to configuring a dhcp server, and that is done some where else..
2005-04-18T14:05:00.000Z	aquarius	kent	ok. I'm getting there with it anyway, I think. Cheers for the pointers!
