2009-04-07T19:13:00.000Z	IHS_Intern		Not so sure this is an ubuntu question, probably my router/DHCP server... But this box's name is xubuntu-test02, yet the DHCP server seems to think it is using a name it had a couple of HD's and OSs ago, that another machine currently has, any idea how to fix this without resetting whichever bit of hardware is the DHCP server?
