2009-01-08T14:13:00.000Z	gordonjcp	bingungaja	if you're selling your laptop you should probably wipe the disk and do a fresh install
2009-01-08T14:14:00.000Z	gordonjcp	bingungaja	it's worth bearing in mind that you don't need to do this 27 million passes of some expensive proprietary "secure wipe" thing
2009-01-08T14:14:00.000Z	gordonjcp	bingungaja	for all practical purposes a single pass full of random enough data will wipe a disk beyond all hope of recovery ;-)
