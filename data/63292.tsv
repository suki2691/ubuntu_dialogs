2009-11-18T22:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Lint	don't remove Hal!
2009-11-18T22:59:00.000Z	Lint	sebsebseb	I had an impression it's deprecated?
2009-11-18T22:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Lint	I think 9.10 still uses it for something, and in that case, it's on the verge of becoming properly depreacted as far as I know
