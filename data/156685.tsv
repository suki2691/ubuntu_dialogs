2007-12-15T19:02:00.000Z	enzogupi		Hello, I've a problem with ubuntu, I've spent many days on it (I'm not a newbie, I'm a programmer since 1985 and linux user since 1997)

2007-12-15T19:04:00.000Z	riotkittie	enzogupi	can you not shut down at all? not even via command line?
2007-12-15T19:05:00.000Z	riotkittie	enzogupi	i've seen a couple of people posting on ubuntuforums.com with the same problem and nobody seemed to have a solution :(
