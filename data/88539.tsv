2008-06-18T02:02:00.000Z	Vixus		Right, I'm installing ubuntu studio to dual boot with XP and I should mention that I already had ubuntu on there. So now when I try to install grub or lilo to the MBR it says no luck.. I should have gone back and done /fixmbr with a windows cd but it's too late for that now. What should I do so as to not screw up my install? Note GRUB is already on there..
2008-06-18T02:03:00.000Z	Vixus		I haven't lost grub after installing windows, I just need to modify the current grub to boot the new ubuntu studio (because all my mount points/partitions have changed)

2008-06-18T02:04:00.000Z	Vixus	ASULutzy	Well it's telling me it failed to install.
