2010-05-22T13:25:00.000Z	Cynthia	alfredo	please install the package compiz-config-gnome and find the icon in System / Preferences
2010-05-22T13:26:00.000Z	Cynthia	alfredo	whoops, for the manager... means you probably have it already
2010-05-22T13:28:00.000Z	Cynthia	alfredo	(from PM) I don't know where the fire plugin is, perhaps a search for 'compiz fire plugin' in Synaptic is in order though
