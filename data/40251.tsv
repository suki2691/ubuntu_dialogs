2011-01-10T22:04:00.000Z	Jemt		Hi. How can I disable the workspace switcher using gconf-editor ? I can't seem to find a key allowing me to either disable it or change the number of desktops to 1
2011-01-10T22:04:00.000Z	Jemt		A package name would actually be better - then I can simply uninstall it
2011-01-10T22:05:00.000Z	st__	Jemt	workspaces are intrinsic
2011-01-10T22:06:00.000Z	Jemt	st__	Okay. But it must be possible to change the number of desktops to 1
