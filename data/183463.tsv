2007-11-19T01:04:00.000Z	phantom		i'm having trouble getting mp3s to play in amarok.  it says i need to install mp3 support, and then, without it installing anything, it says support is installed and i need to restart amarok.  when i do, i just get the same error
2007-11-19T01:05:00.000Z	phantom		mp3s work in rythmbox however
