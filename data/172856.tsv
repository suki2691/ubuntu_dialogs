2007-07-12T13:31:00.000Z	xman		 ?
2007-07-12T13:33:00.000Z	Vlet	xman	does the application run correctly? sometimes graphical applications, when run from the commandline, spit out debug messages that are basically meaningless
2007-07-12T13:33:00.000Z	xman	Vlet	yes it does. it's just i wonder what those are
