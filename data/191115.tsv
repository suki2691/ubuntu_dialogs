2011-11-22T08:46:00.000Z	azrad		hi noob here; i messed up my ubuntu install; when i log in through the graphial window it lets me in; to a blank desktop with a terminal open and nothing else.... need advise to just reinstall it back to the way it was from the distro or something
2011-11-22T08:47:00.000Z	azrad		i was messing around with compiz and unity (that was the cause of the problem)
2011-11-22T08:47:00.000Z	azrad		reisio; that would be fine i guess; anything is better than what i got; not picky just need something :)
