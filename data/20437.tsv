2011-06-26T01:07:00.000Z	ckiraly		it seems that whatever I put into the cd/dvd drive - it creates a folder for that in media - so - for example, I just put in a dvd with a bunch of avi files on ie, and it make a folder named /media/ARK0001 (which is the disc name when I burned it )
2011-06-26T01:07:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ckiraly	did you try to check the drive with fsck?
2011-06-26T01:10:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ckiraly	you should be able to check/repair the 1.5 Tb drive with fsck & avoid the problem with running window$ live
