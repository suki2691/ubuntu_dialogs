2010-02-14T14:36:00.000Z	TCD		Hey. Can anybody either help me, or direct me to a decent tutorial on how to install/boot Ubuntu onto a USB stick? I have an .iso file from the ubuntu website, and googling comes up with a load of different things.

2010-02-14T14:40:00.000Z	TCD		Hmm. Just looking at the wiki, is unetbootin any good?
2010-02-14T14:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	TCD	 it works very well
