2010-05-03T04:46:00.000Z	drclue	Flannel	I agree with you that it is some sort of GRUB issue and have read some posts to that effect. How do I update grub in this situation? Could I use an old 9.10 install CD to get at a grub update?
2010-05-03T04:47:00.000Z	Flannel	drclue	Depends on the 'grub issue' but yeah, grabbing a CD and doing the standard grub fix type things is a good start in general
2010-05-03T04:49:00.000Z	drclue	Flannel	I guess I'll try and figure that one out , never had to do it before, and that particular machine connects to the network through an old netgear WiFi usb  adapter that at the moment can't find the network
