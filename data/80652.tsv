2009-07-03T19:57:00.000Z	inx-live		hello.  I have a cli ubuntu install - I just typed out a long command - is there a way to save the command so I don't have to type it again?
2009-07-03T19:57:00.000Z	rski	inx-live	if you press up arrow the command will show again
2009-07-03T19:58:00.000Z	rski	inx-live	or just save it to a textfile
2009-07-03T19:58:00.000Z	inx-live	rski	yes I know, but when I exit it will be lost
