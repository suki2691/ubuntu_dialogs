2009-08-25T07:16:00.000Z	rogerotis		It's seems as if Anytime I run either or, my system bogs down to the point I can't use it, and have to wait about 4 minutes before my system works it self out of it, I originally thought it was a problem with steam, but realized it was wine that was doing it to me when trying to configure it, Does anyone have any recomendations.
2009-08-25T07:16:00.000Z	rogerotis		Searched the web and didnt find anything
2009-08-25T07:18:00.000Z	mnaines	rogerotis	I have the same problem with Wine...It is because of the DirectX stuff...Wine bogs down pretty bad when you try to run something that requires DirectX and that isn't OpenGL compatible
