2008-07-11T02:58:00.000Z	perhamlinux		I have huge problems with my DVD Drive, I even changed the device with another one, the problem still persists. it can't read or write stuff on DVD CDs. it says it's an io error. I can't even boot with the live DVD now. my drive used to be /dev/hda, now it is /dev/scd0. this is crazy, I have an IDE drive. and why should my drive dev file change? I tried changing fstab with no luck. I can get the file list, but I can't read any files. feel free to ask me q

One time when I had a huge brain fart I plugged the middle channel of the IDE ribbon into the MoBo and each end into the devices and was then perplexed as to why it didn't work. I asked a friend and rofl'd at me till I realized how dumb a mistake it was ;)
