2007-02-07T10:17:00.000Z	gongzero	oljanx	I'm curious about the same thing.  I'm trying to switch over to Ubuntu completely on my laptop
2007-02-07T10:23:00.000Z	oljanx	gongzero	 I hear ya, unfortunately I have to keep the dozer around few things still, I'm trying to reduce the number of those things as much as possible...
2007-02-07T10:24:00.000Z	gongzero	oljanx	Same here.  I'm still quite a n00b to Linux in general but I'm liking what I see so far.  ;)
