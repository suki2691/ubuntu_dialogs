2006-03-08T14:47:00.000Z	tdn		I have just installed kde with apt-get install kde (not using Kubuntu). I can't find Kontrolpanel anywhere in the menus. What to do?
2006-03-08T14:48:00.000Z	polpak	tdn	you need to do sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
2006-03-08T14:48:00.000Z	tdn	polpak	ok. Thanks.
2006-04-29T15:41:00.000Z	polpak	tdn	why does that matter? Linux doesn't really make a distinction
