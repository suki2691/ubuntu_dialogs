2010-11-10T23:10:00.000Z	meowsus		I'm setting up Ubuntu Server 10.10 on my laptop and have successfully configured my ethernet connection, but now i'm trying to configure my wireless. I've installed "wireless-tools" and have used "iwconfig" to determine "eth1" is my wireless device, but when i put the appropriate info into /etc/network/interfaces and restart the networking daemon, DHCPDISCOVER runs a handful of times and fails.
2010-11-10T23:11:00.000Z	meowsus		What am i doing wrong? I've installed the "bcmwl-kernel-source" which is for my BCM4312 and the little wifi light showed up on my keyboard after a reboot
