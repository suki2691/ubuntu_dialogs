2007-12-24T02:27:00.000Z	verb3k	falieson	what do you mean remake?
2007-12-24T02:28:00.000Z	falieson	verb3k	recently installed applications show up in 'other' or not at all, I would like it to sort them out and add appropriately (I know fluxbox has a cmd like this)
2007-12-24T02:28:00.000Z	verb3k	falieson	hmm I am not really sure
