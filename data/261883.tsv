2005-05-25T07:11:00.000Z	Seveas	ik-sparc	you mean where you download packages from?
2005-05-25T07:11:00.000Z	Seveas	ik-sparc	sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list (from a command line) in that case
2005-05-25T07:13:00.000Z	Seveas	ik-sparc	you cannot have apt-get, dpkg and.or synaptic open at the same time
