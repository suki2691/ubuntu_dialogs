2010-08-04T19:54:00.000Z	c00lryguy		Can someone please help me out? You know how you can hold ALT to drag a window around in gnome? Well my system seems to be stuck in reverse. I have to hold ALT to interact with a window, otherwise clicking the window just drags it.\
2010-08-04T19:56:00.000Z	tucemiux	c00lryguy	 what do you mean use ALT to "interact"?  What is your definition of "interact"
2010-08-04T19:57:00.000Z	c00lryguy	tucemiux	by interact I mean you're able to click on the gui elements of the application... if you hold down alt and click on a window, you enter the window drag mode
2010-08-04T19:59:00.000Z	tucemiux	c00lryguy	you mean use the right ALT and then hit the "F" key and it opens the File menu and go to save on lets say openoffice?? something like that?
