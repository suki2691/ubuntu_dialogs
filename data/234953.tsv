2007-10-05T10:47:00.000Z	Sole		would it be less of a headache to simply install x86 ubuntu instead of the 64-bit version?  it seems like the 64-bit will lead to more annoyances with programs/drivers/plugins not running on it
2007-10-05T10:48:00.000Z	Sole		or is it simply an isolated incident with the flash plugin for firefox?
2007-10-05T10:48:00.000Z	CarlFK	Sole	pretty sure it is not an isolated incident
