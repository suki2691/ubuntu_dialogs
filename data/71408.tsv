2008-12-14T21:07:00.000Z	allsystemsarego	idejmcd	try opening them in audacity
2008-12-14T21:08:00.000Z	allsystemsarego	idejmcd	those are .wav files renamed to a different extension
2008-12-14T21:30:00.000Z	idejmcd	allsystemsarego	are there any programs that I can use to strip the DRM from the audible files?
