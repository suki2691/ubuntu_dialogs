2006-10-16T15:03:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	apecat	Ahh, thanks for the info
2006-10-16T15:03:00.000Z	apecat	ianmacgregor	yeah, i'm not using it either. it's ppretty wacky to provide only the desktop installer on the cds that u ship to people, i mean lots of people will want to install on old slow computers
2006-10-16T15:04:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	apecat	Good point
