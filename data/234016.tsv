2009-01-10T04:02:00.000Z	Joeseph		Hi.    I have updated my ubuntu machine many times, and occasionally it will ask me if I want to change my menu.lst   ...  I remember editing that so I could add XP dual-boot functionality, so I would always just tell it not to mess with it.....  Does that make it so I don't boot the latest kernel?
