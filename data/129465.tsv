2007-06-29T05:28:00.000Z	speaker219		does anyone know what the command is in terminal to automatically find an ip addy with dhcp? thanks =)
2007-06-29T05:28:00.000Z	DebianServerUser	speaker219	sudo invoke-rc.d networking restart <--- restarts network
2007-06-29T05:29:00.000Z	DebianServerUser	speaker219	I've been waiting to have my question answered here for an hour, haven't received a response, but glad I could help :)
2007-06-29T05:30:00.000Z	speaker219	DebianServerUser	Is there a more specific command that will obtain the DHCP addy without entirely restarting networking?
