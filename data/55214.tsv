2010-05-27T20:05:00.000Z	getxsick	edbian	hmm before i reinstall Ubuntu (9.04 previously) i had a different label. Maybe something in /etc/fstab?
2010-05-27T20:05:00.000Z	edbian	getxsick	You can create an entry for it in /etc/fstab and then it will be mounted in whatever folder you want.  It will still have that label though, you just probably won't see it anywhere.
