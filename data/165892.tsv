2006-09-28T07:27:00.000Z	|thunder		TrevorT; installing anything is a pain. and you have to either build things yourself or use old ass pre built packages that are way out of date.  so i just switched to 6.06.1 32bit
2006-09-28T07:28:00.000Z	TrevorT	|thunder	you might try gentoo for 64 bit
2006-09-28T07:29:00.000Z	TrevorT	|thunder	ever tried OpenSuse?
