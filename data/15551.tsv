2011-06-17T03:27:00.000Z	paranoidi		I have rather critical problem, ubuntu server (despite being desktopless) is trying to feed my poor small LCD 1024x768 with latest kernel(s) .. how can I stop that?

2011-06-17T03:28:00.000Z	paranoidi	escott	it would otherwise, but it's kernel specific thing .. the options in menu.lst were identical
2011-06-17T03:28:00.000Z	escott	paranoidi	you could send the kernel a parameter for its framebuffer size
