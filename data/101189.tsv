2008-02-06T23:13:00.000Z	necrocan666		i need to share a few drives on a mswindows network.... the ntfs drive went like a breeze... but my 2 fat32 drives have admin only permissions... is there a way to change this ?

2008-02-06T23:15:00.000Z	noodlesgc	necrocan666	come to think of it I couldn't get them to work with a password either
2008-02-06T23:16:00.000Z	necrocan666	noodlesgc	: what bugs me is that the ntfs drive went well.... i am wondering how to change permissions for a whole drive...
