2009-10-01T06:21:00.000Z	ThatGuyOverThere		Hello. Is there any way for me to remove network devices?
2009-10-01T06:22:00.000Z	losher	ThatGuyOverThere	you can configure them to be 'down' using ifconfig. But why do you need to?
2009-10-01T06:24:00.000Z	losher	ThatGuyOverThere	I've heard weirder things. You want something like 'sudo ifconfig eth0 down' from a terminal. You might be able to do it from network manager instead...
2009-10-01T06:30:00.000Z	losher	ThatGuyOverThere	yes, the effects of typing ifconfig on a terminal will not last past a reboot...
