2008-03-14T03:31:00.000Z	seb962		Excuse me guys... I just moved my HD to a new mobbo, it's an Asus m2n-mx, and now I'm getting a kernel panic: timer not connected to ioapic. I've tried booting with noapic as everyone suggest, but then my keyboard gets disabled... I'm trying to boot from the live cd, and it happens aswell! any thoughts?
