2007-05-01T12:02:00.000Z	DanaG		I have an old Netgear MA521, that seems to be r818x.
2007-05-01T12:03:00.000Z	DanaG		I thought it was broken with native drivers, but then I tried it in Vista with Vista's own drivers.
2007-05-01T12:03:00.000Z	DanaG		It didn't work there either.  I installed Netgear's drivers -- still didn't work.  I used ndiswrapper again -- still didn't work.
2007-05-01T12:03:00.000Z	Adsims2001	DanaG	i've been having severe problems with mine made by D-Link... The default drivers before 7.04 (They're blacklisted) are very buggy and unmaintained
