2011-02-17T17:09:00.000Z	hilarie		So... I ran a bunch of crap in wine as gksudo, and now my root folder has a bunch of crap for wine, can I safely delete all of it?
2011-02-17T17:11:00.000Z	tensorpudding	hilarie	delete the /root/.wine folder
2011-02-17T17:11:00.000Z	tensorpudding		it'll get rid of everything you installed or did as root in wine though
