2010-04-10T09:21:00.000Z	SpaceCowboy40404		i tried ubuntu about 2 years ago on a different laptop and never could get the wireless working then... ditched it and went back to windows untill now and just forked over almost 200 dollars for vista and then a month later windows 7 comes out and im not upgrading again... hence why im trying to get ubuntu going fully this time around
2010-04-10T09:22:00.000Z	SpaceCowboy40404		i like the idea of ubuntu cause its so different from windows.. its learning how to use a pc all over again and makes it exciting again :)
