2008-08-19T01:49:00.000Z	histo	co0lingFir3	if its not int he repos you can try getdeb.net but thats not really recomended
2008-08-19T01:50:00.000Z	co0lingFir3	histo	already tried getdeb, wasnt successful
2008-08-19T01:51:00.000Z	histo	co0lingFir3	then youc an make your own deb from source with checkinstall
