I'm specifically having to deal with apache error logs, but it'd be nice to get something that can watch other logs as well.
2010-08-30T00:11:00.000Z	themusicgod1	SeanInSeattle	so other than tail?
2010-08-30T00:13:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	themusicgod1	 Hmm.. being somewhat new to ubuntu, I haven't needed to use tail up to this point.  How would you use it to watch log files?
2010-08-30T00:14:00.000Z	SeanInSeattle	themusicgod1	 Nevermind.  I'll look at it online, and I'll come back with questions if I have any.
