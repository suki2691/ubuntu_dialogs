2006-03-19T15:57:00.000Z	_Rappy_		I want to run a command, on startup. Well, really after startup, when I'm logged inn, automatically. the command is just a single wordto run a program. How can I do this?
2006-03-19T15:58:00.000Z	Paul89	_Rappy_	so when you log in you want to run a command?

2006-03-19T16:01:00.000Z	Paul89	_Rappy_	it's just a shell script, i think :/
