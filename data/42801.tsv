2009-11-17T03:25:00.000Z	treeforms		Hello.  I am not able to reinstall 9.10 because the screen is just green and grey stripes and I am not able to type anything into anything even with alt-ctrl f1.

2009-11-17T03:27:00.000Z	NManoogian	treeforms	ah, well, don't give up.
2009-11-17T03:29:00.000Z	NManoogian	treeforms	I know the feeling. My WiFi adapter stopped working after the install of 9.10.
