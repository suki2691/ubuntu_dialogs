2005-04-20T10:55:00.000Z	codyman		i am trying to apt-get install mplayer yet i get a "mplayer: Depends: libfontconfig1 (>= 2.3.0) but 2.2.3-4ubuntu7 is to be installed"
2005-04-20T10:56:00.000Z	linux_galore	codyman	mean you will have to update libfontconfig because the evrsion of mplayer your installing is a newer version with new dependencies
2005-04-20T10:57:00.000Z	codyman	linux_galore	so i will have to compile libfontconfig from source?  cause according to apt-get it is up to date
2005-04-20T10:58:00.000Z	linux_galore	codyman	hmm could always just force the install of mplayer and create a link
