2007-01-18T17:34:00.000Z	dame		I got fglrx working following this guide: http://linux.xlibs.net/category/howtos/ati/ . fglrx is showing correct output, there is direct rendering and the vendor string is good. Just Im getting 120dps with glxgears. On FC6 I was getting 1200dps with the open-source drivers. Is there something to do in order to improve the dps, exept buying nVidia card :P
