2010-03-29T03:48:00.000Z	Wren88		how do make ubuntu 9.04 not login into the kbm but rather the shell prompt?
2010-03-29T03:48:00.000Z	Wren88		still want to keep gnome on there though...
2010-03-29T03:49:00.000Z	Typos_King	Wren88	   use the 'recovery mode' option from grub
2010-03-29T03:49:00.000Z	Typos_King	Wren88	   that'll drop you to a shell
