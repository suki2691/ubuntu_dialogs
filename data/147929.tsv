2007-01-26T13:08:00.000Z	Random_Transit		!fstab
2007-01-26T13:09:00.000Z	shatrat	Random_Transit	in edgy it uses UUIDs to identify partitions. I'm not sure what the benefit is.  I still use the old "/dev/hda3" type stuff when I add to it and it works
2007-01-26T13:09:00.000Z	Random_Transit	shatrat	ok, good...i wasn't sure if using the old standards would work...
