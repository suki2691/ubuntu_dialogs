2007-09-11T15:10:00.000Z	HoboBen		Okey doke, I've got the right shebang, for lisp but if I run my program in Terminal I just get an empty terminal with a blinking cursor. What does this suggest?
2007-09-11T15:12:00.000Z	HoboBen		Is this the right format for the shebang? #!interpreter [/usr/bin/clisp] 
2007-09-11T15:13:00.000Z	proqesi	HoboBen	that depends on where you installed it.  type: which clisp
2007-09-11T15:14:00.000Z	HoboBen	proqesi	I found clisp, it appears to be the right place
