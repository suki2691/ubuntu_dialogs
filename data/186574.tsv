2007-02-13T12:58:00.000Z	Minuo		Is there a [somewhat]  simple way to get the ubuntu install CD to give me a ssh session and a text-mode installer?  I want to install Ubuntu on a headless server and I don't have a monitor handy
2007-02-13T12:58:00.000Z	ikonia	Minuo	the cd doesn't come with ssh server
2007-02-13T12:59:00.000Z	Minuo	ardchoille	Will the alternate CD have an SSH server?
2007-02-13T12:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Minuo	no
