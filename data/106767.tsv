2011-02-01T09:16:00.000Z	col0ur		Hello, i just upgraded to Maverick from Hardy (im on a netbook). Before, on Hardy, if i played a game under wine with a resolution of 800x600, it would stretch to fill my entire screen. However now under Maverick it just uses a square in the middle (actual 800x600). Any way i can fix this?
