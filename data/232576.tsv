2008-10-01T16:15:00.000Z	PsionicFungus		Hey all, I'm looking to make the switch to Ubuntu, however for my job it's necessary that a built in piece of hardware works. I've been having difficulty finding much about it, though the UPEK website has SDKs for Linux that they say have been tested in Ubuntu. Anybody know anything about support for biometric fingerprint devices?
