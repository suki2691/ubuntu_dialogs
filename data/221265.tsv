2005-09-21T07:03:00.000Z	BlueEagle	boogster	...so?
2005-09-21T07:04:00.000Z	BlueEagle	boogster	We here at #ubuntu sais gentoo is for wannabe hax0rs.
2005-09-21T07:05:00.000Z	BlueEagle	boogster	Tell you one thing. Ubuntu is just as customizable as gentoo is. It's just that gentoo forces you to do that tedious customization while ubuntu has got sensible (well, somewhat sensible) defaults.
