2008-09-24T01:10:00.000Z	s85		guys, I have a strange problem: I have a script to rename files according to the first line in each file, files are in CH-GBK encoding, then I rename them... bash says "invalid argument"... however I don't see any mistakes... http://pastebin.com/d72496f93

2008-09-24T01:12:00.000Z	s85	guntbert	yep, I've checked it 10 times... :(
2008-09-24T01:13:00.000Z	guntbert	s85	I thin you misunderstood, I was pointing you to the channel #bash :)
