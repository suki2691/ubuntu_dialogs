2012-02-25T20:02:00.000Z	ichiro_		I'm having issues with intel i810 on squeeze. I've done an i910.modeset=0 at boot to get the thing up and running but graphical performance is poor compared to etch and i get artefacts in some cases. Moving a window hammers the cpu. Don't have this issue on a 76Mhz pII :P
2012-02-25T20:02:00.000Z	ichiro_		Any ideas?
