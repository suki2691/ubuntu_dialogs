2006-08-24T08:05:00.000Z	profoX	Madpilot	amen.. i converted total "noobs" to ubuntu -- and they have their own questions and problems -- but everything is going smooth now
2006-08-24T08:05:00.000Z	Madpilot	mike_	ever done a from-bare-metal install of Windows? You've got to do far more crap to get a usable OS there than you do with a from-bare install of Ubuntu...
