2008-10-13T12:22:00.000Z	nxmehta		i need to print remotely over the internet from windows to a printer connected to a ubuntu server.  i've set cups/samba up so i can do it on the local LAN, but how should i do it remotely?  am i correct in assuming that i should not use samba remotely (it's insecure)?
