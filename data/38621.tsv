2010-03-23T21:25:00.000Z	eremite		I set my desktop wallpaper to use a screensaver instead of a wallpaper.  It works fine, but only if compiz is turned off.  I have seen videos of people using this feature with compiz turned on, so I was wodnering if anyone knew how to do that?  Here's waht I did to set it up http://ubuntuguide.net/set-a-screensaver-as-your-alive-desktop-wallpaper-in-ubuntu   Any help would be awesome.

2010-03-23T21:26:00.000Z	eremite	Trek	why do you say that?  It simply draws natuatlis desktop when compiz is on.  I want that turned off.  My comp and handle it, trust me.
