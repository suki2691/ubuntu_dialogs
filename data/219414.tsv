2008-10-30T07:51:00.000Z	ffej2ffej		I had a perfectly working UBUNTU workstation.  I used one ofthe built-in programs to change it to a LAMP server.  Now I have no GUI.  What's up?
2008-10-30T07:53:00.000Z	Flannel	ffej2ffej	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2008-10-30T07:53:00.000Z	Flannel	ffej2ffej	does it say its already installed?
2008-10-30T07:53:00.000Z	Flannel	ffej2ffej	Also, which built-in program?
