2009-07-24T09:27:00.000Z	mazda01_	rebel	hdparm should be able to check the speeds.
2009-07-24T09:28:00.000Z	rebel	mazda01_	do you know which flag to run it with?
2009-07-24T09:30:00.000Z	mazda01_	rebel	it would sudo hdparm -T /dev/sda  and sudo hdparm -t /dev/sda. I don't think you have to specify the partition
