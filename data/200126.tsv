2009-11-22T11:13:00.000Z	nanotube	virtuald	probably because it has some kind of long timeout on failure to get an ip...
2009-11-22T11:16:00.000Z	virtuald	nanotube	Yeah but what could wait/hang like that?
2009-11-22T11:17:00.000Z	nanotube	virtuald	dunno - whatever it is that's expecting an ip address ;)
