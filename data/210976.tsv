2006-08-22T08:23:00.000Z	natural20		i'm a complete linux/ubuntu/programming neophite - is there anyone who can help me install java and/or VASSAL on breezy?
2006-08-22T08:24:00.000Z	Sid	natural20	hold on
2006-08-22T08:34:00.000Z	Sid	natural20	I was going to, but it looks like someone else beat me to it. That is, if you have no more questions; otherwise I'm happy to help.
