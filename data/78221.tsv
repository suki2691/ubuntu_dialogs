2009-02-20T03:37:00.000Z	fx3	IntuitiveNipple	oh while im building bind, i wanted to ask another networking question. say i have dyndns configured. and i would like a subdomain to point to a whole different server inside my network, is it possible?
2009-02-20T03:40:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	fx3	subdomain host would only be possible if the router forwards all expected ports to the target server
2009-02-20T03:41:00.000Z	fx3	IntuitiveNipple	like a DMZ?
2009-02-20T03:42:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	fx3	Well, a DMZ routes everything to the target.
