2007-09-18T05:22:00.000Z	yigal		I use screen and I have a vim process in the terminal I have run screen with in the background.  Is it possible to move a process from the terminal pts/9 to pts/1
2007-09-18T05:24:00.000Z	anonobomber	yigal	screen -r
2007-09-18T05:26:00.000Z	yigal	anonobomber	oh, screen -r ok, yes, great
2007-09-18T05:29:00.000Z	yigal	anonobomber	no, that is not what I want, I thought screen -r would be different than screen -R, perhaps allow me to exactly what I wanted and attach a process to screen, it doesn't do that though.
