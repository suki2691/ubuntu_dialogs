2009-10-31T00:02:00.000Z	mMezquitale	Scunizi	can you please show us how to do that?
2009-10-31T00:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	mMezquitale	there's a hidden .mozilla directory in /home that can be renamed.. once renamed FF won't see it.  Use nautilus and hit ctrl+h to reveal the hidden directories and look for one starting with .mozilla
