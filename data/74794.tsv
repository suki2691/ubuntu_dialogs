2011-11-04T07:06:00.000Z	victoria		I've got a question. I currently run Ubuntu 10.04. I've run several Linux systems in the last two years. My boyfriend would like to check out Ubuntu. I'm thinking Wubi Installer. How is installing with Wubi different than installing from a regular disk?
2011-11-04T07:07:00.000Z	victoria		@reiso Ok. I just don't want to f*ck up his computer. I've done a partition/install several dozen times, but not with XP.
2011-11-04T07:09:00.000Z	victoria		Because they thought it would look pretty, I think!
