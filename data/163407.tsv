2006-12-20T11:08:00.000Z	Tonren		My laptop's been out of commission for 3 days and I've been in here all the time.  I really don't want to switch back to Windows, but if something like this can knock everything out, I just might have to.
2006-12-20T11:09:00.000Z	Tonren		Someone please help out.
2006-12-20T11:09:00.000Z	Tonren		I let my laptop run out of batteries and it went into hibernate.  I think it wrote something bogus to the swap partition because now I can't boot up.
2006-12-20T11:09:00.000Z	Music_Shuffle	Tonren	what happened?
