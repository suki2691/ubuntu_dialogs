2009-12-30T02:39:00.000Z	GENT		<GENT> lure ie something horrible happens like his laptop falling out of a car.the problem arises because due to the vast amount of files on his computer I can not make :C it into a img file because it is simply too large. tl;dr too many files on local disk :C and my friend wants me to make a backup what are my options? i can not compress the file as he need to "access them with ease and cant wait around for winRAR to to decompress the files"
