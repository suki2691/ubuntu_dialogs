2008-11-28T22:58:00.000Z	macondo		Can I be logged to a ssh user in another machine and at the same time, logged locally?
2008-11-28T22:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	macondo	 probably
2008-11-28T22:59:00.000Z	macondo	sebsebseb	for some reason, I can't. I'm logged locally and when I try to login to the remote server, ubuntu just resumes my local session
2008-11-28T22:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	macondo	 well I don't know SSH well enough to be able to help you
