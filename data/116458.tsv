2007-10-21T04:01:00.000Z	Pici	flick	adept is the package manager for KDE., just like synaptic is the one for gnome
2007-10-21T04:01:00.000Z	flick	Pici	thanks... i hope using adept after synaptic will not mess up dependencies?
2007-10-21T04:02:00.000Z	Pici	flick	nope, they both use apt as their framework, so to speak.
