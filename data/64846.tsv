2010-08-14T18:40:00.000Z	yashi_		is there a practicable way to watch flash videos with ubuntu x64?
2010-08-14T18:41:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	yashi_	are you having "clicking" problems with flash?
2010-08-14T18:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	yashi_	"flash-nonfree" is an alternative to flash64bit really -- it's the 32bit flash (which will work on 64bit system BTW)
