2010-11-07T03:03:00.000Z	jeffreyf		In Firefox, I delete or organize bookmarks, but they come back or go back.  Any ideas?
2010-11-07T03:04:00.000Z	coz_	jeffreyf	  export to html onto the desktop and delete all book marks
2010-11-07T03:04:00.000Z	coz_	jeffreyf	 rather after exporting delete them from firefox
2010-11-07T03:40:00.000Z	jeffreyf	coz_	I went as far as deleting the profile folder from ~/.mozilla/xxxxxx
