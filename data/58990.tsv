2009-04-27T17:25:00.000Z	acerbus		In 9.04, is there a way to modify the notification when receiving messags in Pidgin? I want the notification to appear, but not the message itself in the notification.
2009-04-27T17:26:00.000Z	cnus8n	acerbus	I was also asking for the same problem a few hours back
2009-04-27T17:26:00.000Z	cnus8n	acerbus	i then turned off all notifications - http://www.killertechtips.com/2009/04/26/disable-notifications-in-ubuntu-904-jaunty-jackalope/
2009-04-27T17:27:00.000Z	acerbus	cnus8n	yeah, but I don't want to turn it all off as I kind of like it. I just don't like that my IM's are notified for everyone to see.
