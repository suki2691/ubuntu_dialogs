2005-08-03T13:58:00.000Z	GammaRay	shawarma	viruses.. the plural of virus
2005-08-03T13:59:00.000Z	shawarma	GammaRay	The thing is that there is no latin text available anywhere that uses the word vius in plural, so noone really knows how it's conjugated.. It could be vira og viri.. Where the extra 'i' comes from in h4x0r-speak, I don't know.
