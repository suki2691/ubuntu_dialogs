2011-07-26T23:05:00.000Z	Galvatron	Pici	I mean KDE 4.7, NOT Ubu 11.10 (I've just noted the fact that this new KDE goes for both Ubuntus 11.xx).
2011-07-26T23:06:00.000Z	Pici	Galvatron	Still, thats not going to help the fact that the package thats requested here was removed because it was back from the KDE3 days.
2011-07-26T23:06:00.000Z	Galvatron	Pici	OK
