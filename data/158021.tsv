2007-11-23T18:27:00.000Z	Slart	malajenho	isn't there in the apt-repositories? sudo apt-get install compiz-extra-plugins or something?
2007-11-23T18:30:00.000Z	Slart	malajenho	check the compiz documentation.. I think there is a wiki... I know I managed to install those.. and I can't remember doing anything special
