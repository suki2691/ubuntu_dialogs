2009-01-18T04:26:00.000Z	oskar-	obake-san	did you delete them as root, and looked for free space as a user?
2009-01-18T04:28:00.000Z	oskar-	obake-san	i don't know exactly, but it could have to do something with the reserved blocks for uid 0
2009-01-18T04:30:00.000Z	oskar-	obake-san	does lsof say the same? sudo lsof | grep filename
