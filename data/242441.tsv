2012-11-23T16:18:00.000Z	TeamColtra		My computer has been randomly turning off, at first I thought it was because it was overheating (which it has a history of doing) but now I have it sitting vertically  (it's for my media centre so I don't need it to be laying properly) and it still will turn itself off. So I was googling and it said it could be a memory problem, so I put it through memtest and at 47% complete… it started failing every address. So then I removed a stick of RAm
2012-11-23T16:18:00.000Z	TeamColtra		Tried it again, and at 47% it failed out. So I swapped the ram tried the other one… and at 47% it failed out. So no matter what I do, my memtest fails out at 47% is there something else I can try? Does this mean something?

2012-11-23T16:19:00.000Z	gordonjcp	TeamColtra	sheer bad luck?
