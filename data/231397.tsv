2005-06-21T10:27:00.000Z	ccc	bionic_	sorry, i didn't even see your question till now... but no, sorry, i can't. i've got a few ntfs disks myself, using them as read only, but i'll convert them to ext3/reiserfs as soon as possible. better file systems.
2005-06-21T10:29:00.000Z	bionic_	ccc	yeah but then you will have to format them :(
2005-06-21T10:30:00.000Z	ccc	bionic_	yep. cleaning out other disks to make space as we speak. :) but i've got 600 gb ntfs, so it'll take a while
