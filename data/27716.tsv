2010-08-12T19:53:00.000Z	reggi		hello everyone - i have an xorg.conf question: When I set my display resolution to 2048x1024 I cannot chose 72Hz as refresh rate, only 60Hz or Auto. How can I add 72Hz for the 2048x1024 resolution? Thanks

2010-08-12T19:55:00.000Z	reggi	Boeby	it is possible, I use 2048x1024 @ 72Hz on my Windows 7 machine.
2010-08-12T19:56:00.000Z	reggi	Boeby	I just want to know if it is possible in ubuntu to force it to use resolution @ specified Hz
