2010-09-11T04:04:00.000Z	jsidhu		yeah, then im left with figuring out how to auto login from the console
2010-09-11T04:04:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	jsidhu	yeah, just don't load gdm at boot, or get gdm to just start x. but just on the side - kinda a waste don't you think?, if you can run gnome yet you just want a photo viewer
