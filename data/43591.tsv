2009-12-09T19:50:00.000Z	Snossages		I tried pidgin, seemed like yet another half-baked chat app...  even the incomplete stuff was more incomplete than usual
2009-12-09T19:50:00.000Z	om26er	Snossages	so what you use?
2009-12-09T19:50:00.000Z	Snossages	om26er	oh I stick to ichat
2009-12-09T19:52:00.000Z	Snossages	om26er	but I do much more chatting on irc than on any im network, so if anything I care about irc apps way more than the silly commercial im stuff
