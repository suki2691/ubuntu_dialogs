2009-01-02T16:02:00.000Z	AlanBell1	Stanlin	have you tried open-vm-toolbox? Free implementation of vmware guest bits
2009-01-02T16:04:00.000Z	Stanlin		but VBox is inferior to VMware.... \
2009-01-02T16:06:00.000Z	Stanlin	AlanBell1	this free version, is the vmtools ?
2009-01-02T16:10:00.000Z	AlanBell1	Stanlin	not really sure, but it is in the repos and http://open-vm-tools.sourceforge.net/
