2008-04-16T19:15:00.000Z	dmsuperman_	Jeriath	you can usually just go into system -> preferences -> remote and enable it
2008-04-16T19:16:00.000Z	dmsuperman_	Jeriath	all I can suggest is go back into the panel and make sure you read all the options and you aren't blocking anything, beyond that it's over my head
2008-04-16T19:19:00.000Z	dmsuperman_	Jeriath	right, like i said look in there and see if you're blocking _anything_. authentication requests and all. ensure you don't have the "ask you permission" or some such box checked
