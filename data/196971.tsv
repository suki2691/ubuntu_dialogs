2006-04-07T14:28:00.000Z	nornagon		I get crackly sound when I play a sound with 'play', but not with 'aplay'. Zsnes also produces crackly sound (like play), though snes9x does not. My sound driver is snd-hda-intel. Could it possibly be a problem with oss emulation? If so, how can I fix it?

2006-04-07T14:31:00.000Z	Frogzoo	nornagon	not sure what the problem is - but maybe try amarok with the xine engine?
