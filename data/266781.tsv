2010-09-18T13:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Shvonder	 depends on what the theme is for also.. you can drag/drop the archives onto that appearance-theme tool   for most of the theme parts
2010-09-18T13:15:00.000Z	Shvonder	chelz	Dr_Willis that isn't work for me. (there is started Compiz & emerald)
2010-09-18T13:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Shvonder	 emerald has its own theme stuff.. and gui tool.. personally.. i wouldent bother with emerald any more
