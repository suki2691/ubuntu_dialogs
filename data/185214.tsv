2006-05-23T14:16:00.000Z	pro777		I'm trying to install Ubuntu amd64, and my video card isn't supported with the default drivers.  I want to do the trick that I used on other installs where I edited xorg.conf to vesa, and then installed the updated drivers from Nvidia.
2006-05-23T14:16:00.000Z	pro777		But I can't find that file on the amd64 install.  Any suggestions?
