2008-11-04T04:56:00.000Z	trontonic	hillbilly3924	ah, yes, just remove "quiet splash" from /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-11-04T04:57:00.000Z	trontonic	hillbilly3924	or use "startupmanager" if you want a GUI-program
2008-11-04T04:58:00.000Z	trontonic	hillbilly3924	or use the "dmesg" command, if you just want to check some messages
