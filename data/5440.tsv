2012-02-20T07:44:00.000Z	elky	LL2|Android	thanks.
2012-02-20T07:52:00.000Z	elky	LL2|Android	we ops find that doing all moderation in private means we have to explain things ten times over and nobody in the channel ever learns.
2012-02-20T07:53:00.000Z	LL2|Android	elky	true, but I said if it was you and ejv fighting over the problem that I had, not about moderation
