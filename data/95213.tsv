2009-07-06T00:56:00.000Z	Ruby		Hey I was updating a computer with ubuntu 8.10 to 9.04, and my sister had to use it, and after she got back on I used it, noticed volume was screwy, asked if she closed out the updator, and she said it closed itself out so I rebooted the PC
2009-07-06T00:56:00.000Z	Ruby		Turns out it switched workspaces
2009-07-06T00:57:00.000Z	Ruby		Is there anything I can do to recover the data or repair my installation?
