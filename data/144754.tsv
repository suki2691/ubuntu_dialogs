2007-08-03T10:32:00.000Z	dxdt	Gigi	almost all USB memory flash drives work.  Some usb wireless devices work zero config.
2007-08-03T10:32:00.000Z	Gigi	dxdt	but I need it for internet... To conect to a wireless router.
2007-08-03T10:33:00.000Z	Gigi	dxdt	I had one time ago, and did not work... I'm not speaking about storage, I'm speaking about the device that helps you to go wireless connection to a wi-fi router
