2010-11-20T16:41:00.000Z	metallico		if I view the source code of types.h I see that on line 4 there is a #include #include <asm/types.h> if I change it to #include "/usr/include/asm/types.h" the process continues but I get a similar errror later on. Do you have any idea why the system can not include files from the asm
