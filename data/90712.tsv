2008-07-17T03:10:00.000Z	R0t		Is there a way to completely remove Grub from my system, I have XP and Ubuntu. I accidentally installed Grub to the MBR and to my second drive. Thanks for any help

2008-07-17T03:11:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	R0t	fix with Windows CD
2008-07-17T03:12:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	R0t	ask in #windows since this is really a Windows issue
