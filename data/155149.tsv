2007-02-07T16:13:00.000Z	xelados		Sweet. Fluxbox loads now. Two last questions and I'll be set:
2007-02-07T16:13:00.000Z	xelados		1) How can I get X to start when I log in, or will I need to login to bash and type 'startx' every time?
2007-02-07T16:14:00.000Z	xelados		2) Why doesn't Ctrl+Alt+F# work to get to the ttys? :(
