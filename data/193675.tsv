2006-08-06T11:05:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	craig	what kind of video card do you have?
2006-08-06T11:06:00.000Z	craig	fyrestrtr	i'm not sure, i'm running under VM
2006-08-06T11:06:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	craig	its probably a restriction on the emulated vga device that the vm provides, don't think you can do much about it.
