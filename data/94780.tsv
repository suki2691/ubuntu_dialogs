2008-04-18T17:44:00.000Z	pajamian	nxusr	get a keyboard that is not wireless.
2008-04-18T17:44:00.000Z	nxusr	pajamian	just say you don't know
2008-04-18T17:45:00.000Z	pajamian	nxusr	I mean that it can't be done unless the keyboard itself supports it, the whole wireless aspect and the security and encryption is all done at a hardware level before ubuntu even sees the keyboard.
