2006-01-21T16:14:00.000Z	peculiar		ok, just installed ubuntu...never used linux before. installation from the cd is done, booting from disk for the first time. I provide login and pword, and then have to write a command it seems...how do I get in to the "real thing" with a desktop and stuff?
2006-01-21T16:15:00.000Z	TK4222	peculiar	what do you mean a command?
2006-01-21T16:15:00.000Z	TK4222	peculiar	hmmm try "startx" without quotes
2006-01-21T16:16:00.000Z	TK4222	peculiar	are you sure you didnt miss a step..it automatically installs X windows...unless you installed the server version or something
