2009-04-03T18:51:00.000Z	Flynsarmy		nvidias ones work perfectly btu require a restart in x every time you go in and out of dual screen mode. i dunno anything about ATI but heard they're open source so woudl have thought they were pretty good...
2009-04-03T18:52:00.000Z	Flynsarmy		it just sucks needing to restart x when i go in and out of twinview - which i do quite often
2009-04-03T18:53:00.000Z	kinnaz|w	Flynsarmy	have you googled it around ?
