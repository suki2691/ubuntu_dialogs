2012-01-10T00:40:00.000Z	MindALot		err live USB
2012-01-10T00:40:00.000Z	MindALot		I know the live USB works - as it boots on my pc just fine.. just doesn't on my friends.  He couldn't get a console when he tried, and we don't know if it is graphics or other.
2012-01-10T00:42:00.000Z	sskalnik	MindALot	 I am certain that someone will be in here in five hours. ;)
