2008-11-06T20:11:00.000Z	wolfwalker	Shanix_	8.10 seems to have issues all over the place.  Just my observation though.
2008-11-06T20:11:00.000Z	wolfwalker		I think the helpful tech support has retreated to wait for ubuntu 9.04.
2008-11-06T20:11:00.000Z	Shanix_	wolfwalker	that I know. but I just wonder if we can somehow debug the nm 0.7 with the VPN connection
