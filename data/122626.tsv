2007-09-05T09:07:00.000Z	ultr1	bulmer	when i try to compile autopackage it says 1.0
2007-09-05T09:08:00.000Z	ultr1	bulmer	actually no it doesnt say my current v
2007-09-05T09:08:00.000Z	bulmer	ultr1	in that case thats a major work..you may have to refer to the book embedded linux to get a step by step tutorial on compiling a glibc
