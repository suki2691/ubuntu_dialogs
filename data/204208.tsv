I created a partition, 4Gb with ubuntu on. And another, 1Gb as a swap. The rest of the harddrive is dedicated to winxp. (ntfs). I would like to remove ubuntu completley. When I enter the ubuntuinstallation, where you can edit partitions, it doesnt recognize any partitions at all. Just a single drive. Partition magic in win
