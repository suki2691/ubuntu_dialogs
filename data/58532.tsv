2010-12-29T20:33:00.000Z	ovidio		I am using Xubuntu and have sound issues. All volume controls are upped to the maximum level but I barely hear anything. What are my options?

2010-12-29T20:36:00.000Z	ovidio	Darael	I don't hear a thing into the speakers (I am using a laptop), but I hear something when using earphones ..  If I could somehow increase the db-gain ..
2010-12-29T20:36:00.000Z	Darael	ovidio	Hmm, not sure.  Sorry.
