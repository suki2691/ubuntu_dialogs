2006-03-13T07:04:00.000Z	kozuch		hi folks is it normal that Gnome in Breezy semms to me a kind of slow on my ATHLON XP 2200+ and GeForce4 MX 64MB ram with nvidia7667 driver?

2006-03-13T07:06:00.000Z	Healot	kozuch	, that depends on what your card can do... not the driver supplied with X though
2006-03-13T07:08:00.000Z	kozuch	Healot	well it was slow with the default X driver so i upgraded to nvidia driver, now e.g. the 3D screensavers perform super but the 2D environment seems to me a little faster only
