Let alone putting those on my main user interface could be classified as too much aggressive advertising, Maybe even illegal in some places.

It is question of my privacy being selled in main OS GUI to some third party companies directly, together with my IP address. And forcing users to watch advertising in their regular everyday work. Like Ubuntu is moving advertising OS.
