2011-01-23T09:34:00.000Z	UbuntuRules		when I manually launch swat using /usr/sbin/swat, I get a cursor on the next line and no other info, and it doesnt start  Any suggestions?
2011-01-23T09:35:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	UbuntuRules	is this samba swat?
2011-01-23T09:36:00.000Z	UbuntuRules	psycho_oreos	Yes
2011-01-23T09:36:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	UbuntuRules	I believe it will launch a web based configuration daemon, I cannot remember which port will it listen, maybe lsof -i might help
