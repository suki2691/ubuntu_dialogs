2011-05-09T06:02:00.000Z	bonez2046		I have two identical sata drives, each is 250 gb.. both are bootable. I run off one and other has data on it I want to merge over to my main drive. How can I check to see which files are dupes, and then merge the data onto one drive so that the other drive can be for network storage and backup?

2011-05-09T06:04:00.000Z	bonez2046	vaxinated	one question, if I mount the other drive...I can view contents and move most contents, but some directories disallow me from moving contents..noting some permission issue..
