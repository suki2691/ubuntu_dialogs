2005-04-13T16:57:00.000Z	HappyPills		Question... How do I disable xchat's anti-flooding preferences? When I connect to a server it proceeds to scan my connection for trojans and the like. Xchat2 picks up these scans and decides it is being flood attacked and proceeds to set a /ignore on the entire server, effectively booting me off =(
2005-04-13T16:59:00.000Z	HappyPills		install the rar package
2005-04-13T05:00:00.000Z	HappyPills		sudo apt-get install rar
2005-04-13T05:01:00.000Z	roo_	HappyPills	i use xchat and have none of those problems :/
