2010-03-24T21:07:00.000Z	TomV_415	WhiteDawn	I'm booting from usb (live CD equivalent) now, but not sure what to do next.
2010-03-24T21:10:00.000Z	TomV_415	WhiteDawn	I'm on with a liveCD version, but my disk drives do not look full - primary has over 100gb free.
2010-03-24T21:29:00.000Z	WhiteDawn	TomV_415	worth a shot
