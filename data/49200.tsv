2010-03-16T06:02:00.000Z	ubunewb	Boondoklife	That was the exact same thing I heard when 9.10 was out. I love ubuntu any day over windows and I'm not complaining. But oflate, I've faced too many problems.
2010-03-16T06:03:00.000Z	Boondoklife	ubunewb	I had all kinds of issue with 9.10 when it came out. Bashed my head in for a bit and just followed the bug reports till they were fixed. But so far plymouth is the only thing that is bitting me with lucid.
2010-03-16T06:04:00.000Z	ubunewb	Boondoklife	Idk. Im still basing my head. Lets hope 10.04 fixes it all. :)
