2012-03-27T09:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	dumb_dumb	you can look in synaptic for properties on mysql  to see what files are in it.  but I know that data bases are in /lib/?
2012-03-27T09:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	dumb_dumb	opps /var/lib/?
2012-03-27T09:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	dumb_dumb	a bit closer to /var/lib/mysql
