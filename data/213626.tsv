2007-09-15T09:25:00.000Z	TylerLovesUbuntu		I am trying to make a custom live CD with reconstructor and the image I make is just a little bit to big to fit on a CD (by about 50 mb) are there any packages in xubuntu that are optional that I could free up about 50 from my image

2007-09-15T09:28:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	TylerLovesUbuntu	scim-*, ttf-arphic-ukai, ttf-arphic-uming, ttf-kochi-gothic, ttf-kochi-mincho
