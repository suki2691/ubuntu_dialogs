2006-08-22T11:33:00.000Z	rummik		where do i find lndir?
2006-08-22T11:33:00.000Z	rummik		i searched for 'lndir' in synaptic, but i don't get any results
2006-08-22T11:34:00.000Z	sethk	rummik	doesn't appear in a package.  I see the man page for lndir, for it and ja, but nothing else
2006-08-22T11:36:00.000Z	rummik	sethk	i think i'll do some google and see if i can get that working...looks like i could just use ln to do the same function
