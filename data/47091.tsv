2009-10-13T03:30:00.000Z	M03BIUS		hello, can someone assist me with Remote Desktop?  I connected to a users computer but all I can see is their mouse arrow... I can't see any of their windows open...also when I click on stuff it shows on there screen but not on mine.

2009-10-13T03:32:00.000Z	M03BIUS	Jordan_U	how do I fix this?
