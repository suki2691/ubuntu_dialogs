2012-07-15T17:39:00.000Z	D[4]ni	narayana	most are in /usr/lib/rhythmbox/plugins - as i already mentioned, this doesn't work
2012-07-15T17:43:00.000Z	narayana	D[4]ni	check your file permissions plugins dir, use the same for your plugin. also try checking version compatibility with rhythmbox. can't think of anything else.
