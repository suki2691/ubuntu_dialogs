2010-11-23T14:29:00.000Z	zani		hello for the 3rd time, sometimes when I boot my pc  it freezes and shows some lines which say something like "[TTM] Couldn't bind backend" or "[drm:radeon_gem_object_create] *ERROR* Failed to allocate GEM object"
2010-11-23T14:31:00.000Z	zani		why is everyone ignoring me.. on IRC, on Ubuntu Forum
2010-11-23T14:31:00.000Z	st__	zani	probably because you have esoteric problem
2010-11-23T14:38:00.000Z	st__	zani	do you have firmware installed?
