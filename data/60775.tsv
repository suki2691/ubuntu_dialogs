2010-02-06T04:09:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	pea[PC]	Shredder is the codename. I think you have a release-candidate or something installed, not the final
2010-02-06T04:09:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	pea[PC]	which I've not seen in ubuntu repos :\
2010-02-06T04:09:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	pea[PC]	if you find the final packaged in ubuntu repos (or a ppa) would you let me know? I want to upgrade too
