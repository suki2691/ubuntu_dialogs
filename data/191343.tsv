2007-03-11T14:45:00.000Z	AlexC_	tommy12796	how is that a Ubuntu question?
2007-03-11T14:46:00.000Z	AlexC_	tommy12796	so? It's not Ubuntu related. xChat runs on pretty much every Linux distro, and Windows. The fact you are using Ubuntu does not make it a Ubuntu support question.
2007-03-11T14:47:00.000Z	AlexC_	tommy12796	that still, doesn't make it a Ubuntu question =)
