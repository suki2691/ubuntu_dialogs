2004-11-29T11:37:00.000Z	hitchhiker		When booting, I'm getting two modprobe FATAL errors inserting pciehp and shpchp modules, can anyone help?
2004-11-29T11:37:00.000Z	jdz_	hitchhiker	I get those too.
2004-11-29T11:40:00.000Z	hitchhiker	jdz_	Is there a fix that you know of?
2004-11-29T11:41:00.000Z	jdz_	hitchhiker	I believe it's fixed in Hoary.  The messages seem to be harmless though, I personaly just ignore them
