2007-04-05T09:14:00.000Z	daveletourneau		Is it ok for me to begin the script with #!/bin/sh or is it better with bash ? (sorry if the question seems silly)
2007-04-05T09:15:00.000Z	daveletourneau		I also tryed with a non conflicting SXX number with the same result
2007-04-05T09:15:00.000Z	ardchoille	daveletourneau	I think #!/bin/sh is ok. I have a few that begin like that and they haven't had problems.
