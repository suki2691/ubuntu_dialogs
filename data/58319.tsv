2009-05-04T01:32:00.000Z	piroko		Why is it that when I set up a keyboard shorcut in gnome to launch a terminal, it starts the terminal in "/" instead of my home directory????
2009-05-04T01:33:00.000Z	Esde[irssi]	piroko	right click it, and edit properties.
2009-05-04T01:34:00.000Z	piroko	Esde[irssi]	Can't right-click from the gnome keyboard shortcuts configurator. I can left click it though, which asks me what command to run
