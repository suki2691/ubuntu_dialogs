2007-04-29T11:24:00.000Z	IntrinsicValue		Hi.  Anyone know ... if I want to run KDE applications from GNOME.. what do I need to do?
2007-04-29T11:25:00.000Z	flegion	IntrinsicValue	you should be able to do it just by making sure that dependencies are met.
2007-04-29T11:25:00.000Z	flegion	IntrinsicValue	so a kde app will just use the kde libraries
