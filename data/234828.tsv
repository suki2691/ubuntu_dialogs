They were working fine, I got a wireless headset (now turned off) and things went to hell. The laptop can send and receive files from the phone, but Multisync stopped working.

2005-07-31T11:27:00.000Z	robotgeek	LeeColleton	sorry i meant the T 637 :)
2005-07-31T11:29:00.000Z	LeeColleton	robotgeek	multisync should be able to connect Ev2 and the T637, as I said: it was working for me...
