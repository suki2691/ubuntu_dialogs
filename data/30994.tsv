2010-05-30T22:08:00.000Z	FabulouS	node357	distribution in ubuntu 10.04. When mounting a partition (NTFS) or any other partition, it mounts the partition without requiring a password. Already in version 9.10, to mount a partition, it requires the root password, so it can be mounted. Now it makes sense?
