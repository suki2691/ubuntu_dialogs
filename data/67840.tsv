2009-01-24T02:50:00.000Z	Slart	USSVoyager1	ntp.. I think there is a ntp client included by default.. right click on the clock and see if there are any options for it
2009-01-24T02:51:00.000Z	USSVoyager1	Slart	this is ubuntu server 8.10 sorry
2009-01-24T02:52:00.000Z	Slart	USSVoyager1	oh.. you can always install an ntp client.. they are fairly small and simple
