2012-07-19T17:04:00.000Z	Jimbo-OLH		HI, getting "BUG: soft lockup - CPU#0 stuck for …" messages on various VMs on a host running 2.6.35 (Ubuntu 10.04) - reading a bit on this i see it's potentially a bug … has anyone run into this and know of a workaround and/or full solution?
2012-07-19T17:04:00.000Z	Jimbo-OLH		this is causing btw - frequent lockups and freezing of vm's etc … lack of responsiveness ...
2012-07-19T17:05:00.000Z	histo	Jimbo-OLH	have you checked launchpad
2012-07-19T17:07:00.000Z	Jimbo-OLH	histo	- do you mean checked bug reports there? i believe my searches ended on some of those threads but there were indicates of bugs back in 2.6.31 but they were believed to be fixed i think … just wondering how i narrow down the issue as well though … thanks
