2010-06-12T06:09:00.000Z	nullbyte		hey I'm installing ubuntu 10 on my desktop. im trying to connect to the internet through a CNet 8-port switch. when I plug the computer directly into the wall the setup works but when i plug into the switch it doesn't find the connection. the same connection works on my windows machine
2010-06-12T06:10:00.000Z	howie	nullbyte	what does ifconfig
2010-06-12T06:10:00.000Z	howie	nullbyte	what does if config state?  does it show an odd ip address?
2010-06-12T06:12:00.000Z	howie	nullbyte	you might need a router, not a switch.. to allow for a single outbound ip..
