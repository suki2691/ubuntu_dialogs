2011-05-04T11:04:00.000Z	crowsnest		Hi. I am getting an error when trying to format a USB drive: Error creating file system: helper exited with exit code 1: cannot mount /dev/sdg1 at /tmp/job-mkfs-CuICaQ: No such file or directory
2011-05-04T11:04:00.000Z	crowsnest		After this error the OS seems to disable the drive.
2011-05-04T11:05:00.000Z	nit-wit	crowsnest	how are you formatting
