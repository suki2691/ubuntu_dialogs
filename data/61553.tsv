2009-03-28T12:52:00.000Z	abeisgreat		chris, to change the keyboard layout temporarily go to the terminal and type "loadkeys us" without qutes replacing the us with your code
2009-03-28T12:52:00.000Z	chris062689	abeisgreat	I need to change it on the actual destination system (not the LiveCD)
2009-03-28T12:53:00.000Z	chris062689	abeisgreat	and I can't login to the destination system, because it won't accept my username / password because of the keyboard layout being in arabic for some reason
2009-03-28T12:53:00.000Z	abeisgreat	chris062689	ahh I see your issue
