2006-11-22T07:06:00.000Z	nn	britt	There's a 64bit ubuntu release, fwiw
2006-11-22T07:09:00.000Z	nn	britt	No, it wont slow things down, but it'll run the machine in 64bit mode, and afaik there's things such as flash, etc that simply do not have 64bit releases still for linux, mostly binary-only stuff
