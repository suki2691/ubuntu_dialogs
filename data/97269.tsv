2008-03-17T00:30:00.000Z	StefanW		Hey again
2008-03-17T00:30:00.000Z	StefanW		I need some basic help concerning refresh rates
2008-03-17T00:31:00.000Z	StefanW		say I know my monitor can do 75 Hz at 1280 x 800, would this 75 Hz be the horizontal or the vertical refresh rate?
2008-03-17T00:32:00.000Z	ccharles`	StefanW	I *think* that's the vertical refresh rate.
