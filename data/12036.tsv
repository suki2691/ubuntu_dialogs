2012-05-29T13:32:00.000Z	Layke		Hey, I'm on a friends system. Totally confused at why using vi from console is totally different to how it is on my machine.. It's hard to explain, but for example, if I press 'i' to start inserting text, then try and move the caret cursor, it starts inserting random letters...
