2010-02-02T09:49:00.000Z	bullgard		How can I navigate between several tabs in Tilda  using the keyboard?
2010-02-02T09:50:00.000Z	TomV-415	bullgard	try control-tab... that works most places for me.
2010-02-02T09:56:00.000Z	bullgard	TomV-415	Ctrl+Tab asks me: 'Display all 2976 possibilities? (y or n)'. It is obviously not the proper command.
2010-02-02T09:59:00.000Z	TomV-415	bullgard	try typing a few characters first..to reduce the possible options... logging off to reboot..
