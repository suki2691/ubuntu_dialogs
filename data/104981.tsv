2011-08-15T09:57:00.000Z	dangbarry		hey, I was wondering if anyone thinks that the following are security issue:  .bashrc .xinitrc and all .sh files. for example    echo "chromium lemonparty.org" >> .bashrc"  same with any .sh or .xinitrc.. by the way don't not go onto that website, its visually distrubing! last time it was (a bastard friend).. you could do other things like download from git, or wgets. and run them through .sh bashrc .xinitrc. This is easy stopped, by changing the premissions "
