2009-01-11T10:32:00.000Z	egaudet		hey everyone, got a question.  I got the windows 7 beta ISO.  I have no removable media to burn it to (dvd/usb).  I want to copy the dvd contents to an ntfs partition, add it to grub, boot and install from there.
2009-01-11T10:34:00.000Z	egaudet		I'm not a big windows fan but i'd like to try windows 7 .  I just don't understand why I can't read a bunch of files off of the mounted iso
