2009-09-10T00:47:00.000Z	enduser0001		does anyone know how I can get spanish (es-ES) spellchecking working in abiword? I can set the default document language, but that doesn't seem to help
2009-09-10T00:49:00.000Z	hwilde	enduser0001	did you install aspell-es
2009-09-10T00:49:00.000Z	enduser0001	hwilde	nope, trying that now. thanks
2009-09-10T00:50:00.000Z	enduser0001	hwilde	thanks! that's a better grade for me if it's spelled right :P
