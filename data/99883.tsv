2008-02-20T21:04:00.000Z	ss_		I am using Ubuntu Gusty, I have uninstalled beryl packages from my system (by default installed eye-candy packages) now I have a problem of windows border, whenever I start my system my window borders are not there, I found a solution on forums "metacity --replace" but I have to give this command at each system start and when I close the terminal the situation goes back so I have to permanently run this command in terminal with no exit. Any ideas to solve it?

2008-02-20T21:07:00.000Z	ss_	^CatMan^	You mean I will have to paste it in bash profile ok I do it. Thnx for reply
