2011-10-23T21:40:00.000Z	stefanSwissNewbi		I am trying to get the AirPort utility to run on Ubuntu. I installed Wine, downloaded the AirPort Utility for Windows, it installed nicely. But it doesn't find my little AirPort Express when scanning. Why doesn't it find it? What do I have to reconfigure?

2011-10-23T21:42:00.000Z	stefanSwissNewbi	theadmin	thank you
