2008-08-03T07:44:00.000Z	LanUser		Hello - how can I get the "You have new mail" notification working at the console?  I thought biff would do it, but no such luck :(
2008-08-03T07:46:00.000Z	jws	LanUser	i have a fetchmail and procmail setup. and it prints when i get new mail. and just use mutt to read
2008-08-03T07:47:00.000Z	LanUser	jws	I like mutt too and use procmail to filter junk, but didn't think of it for new mail notification
2008-08-03T07:48:00.000Z	LanUser	jws	I don't need fetchmail though I think, I'm sitting on the console of the email server itself
