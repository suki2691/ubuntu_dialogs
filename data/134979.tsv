2007-06-24T14:18:00.000Z	z0rz		I'd like to use Ubuntu as a firewall/router.  Is there some sort of a firewall starter package?  I'm really interested in traffic/stats graphing.
2007-06-24T14:19:00.000Z	z0rz		Should I use Ubuntu server or desktop for a firewall?
2007-06-24T14:19:00.000Z	thedonvaughn	z0rz	for just a firewall, server
