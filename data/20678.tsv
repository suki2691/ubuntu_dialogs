2011-01-18T00:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dodgy_script	i prefer it although it has no 3G support last i checked. I find it can use different interface names whereas networkmanager seems to expect wlan0 and eth0
2011-01-18T00:21:00.000Z	dodgy_script	ActionParsnip	sam-_-, Would it be possible to disable  network-manager and try wicd or would i have to uninstall nm first?
2011-01-18T00:26:00.000Z	dodgy_script	ActionParsnip	sam-_-,      ok thanks  !! I will go check google / ubuntu wiki ..
2011-01-18T01:21:00.000Z	dodgy_script	ActionParsnip	sam-_-,     After i installed wicd and removed network-manager should i also of purged  the nm with apt-get
