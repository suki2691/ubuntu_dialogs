2012-03-13T08:07:00.000Z	cdo		i have an old laptop that i was thinking about putting ubuntu on (1ghz celeron, 512mb ram) and i was wondering if lubuntu or xubuntu would be better
2012-03-13T08:08:00.000Z	cdo		what are the big differences between the two?
2012-03-13T08:08:00.000Z	KM0201_	cdo	the main one, lxde doesn't suck... :)  seriously, lubuntu is "lighter" than xfce, especially xfce4..
