2012-03-13T20:18:00.000Z	luxius		I am having trouble logging on X11. When I type in my password it starts loading up, blanks out and comes back to the logon screen. What could be wrong? (I tried switching window manager).

2012-03-13T20:19:00.000Z	luxius	Guest86201	please help me with my problem or leave your remarks for someone who cares about your appreciation of CLI. I know how to use CLI, but I would like X11 to work.
