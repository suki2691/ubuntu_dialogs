2005-07-14T10:55:00.000Z	buffbikedude		ok then, I'll repose the question. does anyone know where I can get a self-contained mp3 to ogg executable?

2005-07-14T10:57:00.000Z	buffbikedude	reka	I'm looking there. they're saying that it loses data, in red. I'm thinking maybe mp32flac would be a better solution for me.
