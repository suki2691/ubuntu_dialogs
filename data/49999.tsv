2009-08-21T02:02:00.000Z	MastaAce		a question concerning GRUB: I habe edited the menu.lst. But whatever change I do on the tim eor default boot partition, it seems like GRUB ignores my changes. I saved with SUDO. And the changes are persistent. But GRUB seems just to dont care when booting up. I've put the time to 10 seconds, but it boots alway ubuntu after ca. 2 seconds.
2009-08-21T02:03:00.000Z	hwilde	MastaAce	what is the path to the file you are editing ?
2009-08-21T02:03:00.000Z	MastaAce	hwilde	/boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-08-21T02:09:00.000Z	hwilde	MastaAce	did you change the /boot partition or /etc/fstab ?
