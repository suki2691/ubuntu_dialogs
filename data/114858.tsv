2007-12-18T03:47:00.000Z	scragar		just wondering, is there any wait or such command in bash? I'm trying to get a terminal opened though double clicking a program to stay open, but it's not working(only needs to stay open long enough for me to see if it worked or failed)
2007-12-18T03:48:00.000Z	kelsin	scragar	can you not run this program in a terminal to begin with?
2007-12-18T03:48:00.000Z	kelsin	scragar	and bash does have wait which waits for a certain process to finish, or sleep that takes a number of seconds to pause
2007-12-18T03:48:00.000Z	scragar	kelsin	I could, but it's going on my brothers comp, and he would flip out if he had to touch the command line lol.
