At the end of the installation it asked me which display manager I want to use and I selected kdm. After restarting, I logged back on to my Gnome session, but since then, the component with my name and log off/shutdown options on the top right-hand corner has disappeared. Any ideas?

2008-12-27T03:19:00.000Z	duffydack	Stormcr0w_	 try adding it to the panel
2008-12-27T03:21:00.000Z	Stormcr0w_	duffydack	adding it to the panel? from where?
