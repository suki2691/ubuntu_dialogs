2007-12-01T22:11:00.000Z	Velcro_MM		I am running Breezy Badger, which is Ubuntu 5 I think. I can't seem to update it using Synaptic (doesn't find the servers or something). Can I update with an installation CD for a more recent Ubuntu?

2007-12-01T22:13:00.000Z	Velcro_MM	Javid	I won't have to reinstall from scratch and lose my settings etc.?
2007-12-01T22:14:00.000Z	Javid	Velcro_MM	try update-manager -d
