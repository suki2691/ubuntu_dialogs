2010-04-27T04:37:00.000Z	jsec		Hi all. Got a question on if this is possible: I've got Karmic with OS X dual booted on a MacBook. I'm getting interested in penetration security, so I've downloaded an ISO of BackTrack 4. What I'm wondering is if I can blow apart my OS X partition, clear up the space, and install BackTrack 4 side by side with Karmic, without ruining any data on the Ubuntu partition?

2010-04-27T04:42:00.000Z	jsec	h00k	i know it's possible to get the dual boot, i'm just curious as to what would happen if I try to delete the OS X partition... I don't want to have to re-install Ubuntu again.
