2007-05-02T14:38:00.000Z	Jack		I'm having some major issues with my installation of kubuntu 7.04.  I've downloaded and burned the iso 3 times now, from 3 different sites linked from ubuntu.com.  all three iso's have been damaged and don't install correctly.  Anyone know where a working Kubuntu iso torrent is?  or if i might be doing something wrong?
2007-05-02T14:40:00.000Z	Jack		i lost connection, did anyone have any ideas on that?
2007-05-02T14:40:00.000Z	crdlb	Jack	did you check the md5sum of the iso?
2007-05-02T14:42:00.000Z	crdlb	Jack	if the md5sum passes, try burning at a much slower speed
