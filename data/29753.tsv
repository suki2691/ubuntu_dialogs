2010-07-03T21:20:00.000Z	ClevelandRock		I was messing with my gnome-alsamixer settings trying to get my microphone to work, and now none of my games have sound. Everything else has sound, but not my games!
2010-07-03T21:22:00.000Z	ClevelandRock		Hello? Can anybody help get my sound to work in games?
