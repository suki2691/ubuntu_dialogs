2008-02-07T06:10:00.000Z	RaptorQuest		I get "Could not add buddy to server list" when trying to add a Buddy in Pidgin - where is it and how do I add to it and am I in the right place to ask this?
2008-02-07T06:11:00.000Z	zelrikriando	RaptorQuest	maybe you made a typo when you put the name in
2008-02-07T06:12:00.000Z	zelrikriando	RaptorQuest	yes it happens...
2008-02-07T06:12:00.000Z	zelrikriando	RaptorQuest	which type of account on pidgin?
