2012-09-11T18:36:00.000Z	SAngeli		Hi, I need an inexpensive RAID controller and do not know if this one (ADAPTEC
2012-09-11T18:36:00.000Z	SAngeli		RAID 1220SA SINGLE) si compatible or not with latest version of ubuntu server x64
2012-09-11T18:37:00.000Z	SAngeli		I went to ubuntu hcl but all I find for Adaptec is this: Adaptec AAC-RAID
2012-09-11T18:38:00.000Z	compdoc	SAngeli	I cant say if that partiticular raid card is supported, but some adaptec cards are not supported well at all. I would suggest a used 3ware raid card from ebay
