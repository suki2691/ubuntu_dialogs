2006-04-17T11:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	immolo	the ubuntun one has many external drivers included if you need one of those use the ubuntu one if not you can safely use the vanilla (i'm using it myself)
2006-04-17T11:34:00.000Z	immolo	erUSUL	well I like vanilla as it's more upto date but does usplash still work or does it need patching
2006-04-17T11:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	immolo	you need patching iirci
