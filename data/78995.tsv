2008-09-22T14:01:00.000Z	laughzilla		why does KINO have to make every .avi video into a massively heavy .DV file before it can be edited?  i am a big fan of ubuntu, but on multimedia, i hate to admit, ubuntu still sucks even compared to the MSFT options.  is there any hope of this situation improving in the near future?
