2010-04-14T19:19:00.000Z	kyngbuntu		Does anyone have any updated information on how to set a different OS as default in grub? every website I've referenced so far mentions editing menu.lst, but my grub folder doesn't even have that file, so I'm assuming that is an old way of handling this issue.
2010-04-14T19:21:00.000Z	kyngbuntu		i am not using 9.10. this is my first experience with nix OS and i, perhaps foolishly, went with 10.04 assuming the beta was in a pretty reliable state
2010-04-14T19:21:00.000Z	kyngbuntu		if that has something to do with my issue, i'll be happy to format
