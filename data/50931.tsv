2010-04-15T01:41:00.000Z	Machtin		how can i switch to another window, like alt+tab when i got a window open, which obviously doesn't support that? openarena, for example.. (I'm on KDE, if that's what matters)

2010-04-15T01:42:00.000Z	Machtin	darolu	hmh, so it is a KDE-thing?
2010-04-15T01:43:00.000Z	darolu	Machtin	I can't tell since I don't use KDE
