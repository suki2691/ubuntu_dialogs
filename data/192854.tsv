I've followed the directions on many how-to's and it appears the card is up and has a signal(flashing green led vs orange when there is a problem) the card I have is a Sierra Wireless Aircard 580 I'm to the point where I'm trying to test and query the modem which should be /dev/ttyUSB0 (which is what it says in
2007-03-15T12:48:00.000Z	SailorJerry		Hi all, I've been trying to get my 1xEvdo card up and running and I think I've gotten it like 90% there the card is detected the drivers are loaded and I can dial the ppp connection and get an IP address and DNS however I can not ping anything on the internet or the DNS server any clues? I suspect its a bad route, but I'm not too familiar with this command and its syntax is a little tricky for me.
