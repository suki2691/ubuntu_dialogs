2008-04-25T08:43:00.000Z	anacaona		Hikejink: thanks, thought by this evening this would have settled down but I guess not.
2008-04-25T08:43:00.000Z	anacaona		Hikejink: is there a way to upgrade from CDROM or ISO?
2008-04-25T08:43:00.000Z	DBautell	anacaona	To Upgrade from the CD/ISO, you'll need the alternate ISO or the DVD: run cdromupgrade from the root of the CD/ISO/DVD. If you don't want to/can't burn a disc, you can 'mount -o loop nameofiso /path/to/mount/'
