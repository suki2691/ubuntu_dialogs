2007-04-11T11:03:00.000Z	Foone		I accidentally dragged an image onto the window list toolbar, and now that image is set as the background of the toolbar. How can I reset that to the default background? Changing theme doesn't seem to affect it

2007-04-11T11:05:00.000Z	Foone	crimsun	Wherever I click it I get specific options to that section of the toolbar (like the window list or the clock), nothing with a background option
2007-04-11T11:05:00.000Z	crimsun	Foone	secondary-click an empty portion of the toolbar
