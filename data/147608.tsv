2007-01-27T17:32:00.000Z	Turgon		Hello. I would like a program for Ubuntu that lets me, for example download all web pages that follow a certain pattern. For example: www.whatever###.com (being ### a numeric range I can specify). Can someone tell me the name of such an application?
2007-01-27T17:32:00.000Z	Slart_	Turgon	wget or curl
2007-01-27T17:33:00.000Z	Slart_	Turgon	both are standard, mature apps.. many other downloading apps use these in the background
2007-01-27T17:33:00.000Z	Turgon	Slart_	: I'll try curl, thx a lot =)
