2011-10-13T06:29:00.000Z	randomusr		hello, where can I find firmware for my devices? Looking for the location of wl firmware.
2011-10-13T06:30:00.000Z	th0r	randomusr	/usr/local/lib/firmware?
2011-10-13T06:32:00.000Z	randomusr	th0r	no such file or directory?
2011-10-13T06:33:00.000Z	th0r	randomusr	I checked, that is where the firmware for my wifi card resides. You might find it in /usr/lib/firmware also.
