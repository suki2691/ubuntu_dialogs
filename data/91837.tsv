2010-11-17T11:27:00.000Z	lucent	Sn4k3	I think Ubuntu 10.10 livecd ISO is difficult to get onto a USB flashdrive correctly
2010-11-17T11:27:00.000Z	lucent	Sn4k3	it does work, just has some trouble because of conflicting versions of syslinux
2010-11-17T11:28:00.000Z	lucent	Sn4k3	if it won't boot correctly, then well, I forgot how to fix it but there's something you can type if you did get a syslinux prompt, I think it's just "live" and enter
