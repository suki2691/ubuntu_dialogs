2010-12-22T10:21:00.000Z	jon8		i just installed ubuntu using the latest version and using virtual box.. when it starts up it just brings me to the command prompt and not a desktop gui interface
2010-12-22T10:21:00.000Z	jon8		what did i do wrong during the installation, or how to i get the desktop to start up?
