2007-09-25T09:43:00.000Z	bieb		which .bashrc is the primary? the one in /root? or the one in my users home dir?
2007-09-25T09:44:00.000Z	bieb		bruenig.. thanks
2007-09-25T09:45:00.000Z	bieb		Bruenig answered what I needed, the .bashrc in the /home dir trumps the /root one
2007-09-25T09:46:00.000Z	kitche	bieb	of course since the one in /root is for root
