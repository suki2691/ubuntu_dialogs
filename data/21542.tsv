2010-12-24T12:48:00.000Z	mork1	reenignEesreveR-	do you use load balancing?
2010-12-24T12:49:00.000Z	reenignEesreveR-	mork1	no but that isn't required at the first place. I have certainly applications that can be told which interfaces they are supposed to use. However in my case they are failing to send any traffic. My guess is that my routing tables are not being setup correctly
