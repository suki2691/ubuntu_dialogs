2009-10-31T14:04:00.000Z	Wibble-		Help! Trying to upgrade 9.04 to 9.10 my computer restarted half way through... Now I can get to a recovery shell, but otherwise it says that "one or more of the mounts listed in /etc/fstab can't be mounted"... Is my laptop pooped? Do I need to do a completely fresh install? or can I somehow recover stuff?
