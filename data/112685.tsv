2008-01-17T02:24:00.000Z	timrit	MrObvious	 I am having a problem with my audio in Gutsy. The speaker icon in Totem keeps greying out and I have to restart to get it back. When I play an audio file be it mp3 or ogg, when it is greyed out the sound does not work. I have looked in the sound control panel and nothing is muted. Any ideas?
