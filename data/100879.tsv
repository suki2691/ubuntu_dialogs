2008-04-03T18:26:00.000Z	Gatestone	Survivorman	I was thinking that it would be more elegant to have Gmail default for all mail, not just for Firefox.
2008-04-03T18:30:00.000Z	Survivorman	Gatestone	I agree, but the problem is that Gmail broke ALL mailto in every app in every OS with there Gmail 2 update, and I'm not sure if new hacks have been devised. Give me a sec to check.
