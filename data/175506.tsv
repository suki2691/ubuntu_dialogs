2007-10-03T09:03:00.000Z	Baumer		Hi, I'm new to ubuntu, Is there something besides the installation I have to do to get Intel Integrated graphics ( I think it's GMA 950) to work because all of my resolutions aren't available
2007-10-03T09:05:00.000Z	Baumer		Anyone for what I said?
2007-10-03T09:05:00.000Z	cypher1	Baumer	i think you can try installing xserver-xorg-video-intel
2007-10-03T09:07:00.000Z	cypher1	Baumer	i think in feistry the xorg driver may be sufficient, if not as cyclonut mentioned try installing i915resolution also
