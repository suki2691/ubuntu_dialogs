2006-05-29T08:50:00.000Z	intelikey	DJ_Danni	the "synaptic package manager"  listed in your menus  is the gui pointy clicky way.
2006-05-29T08:53:00.000Z	intelikey	DJ_Danni	the cli "hard core linux" way  would be  apt-cache search blah  && apt-get install blah<as listed by the search>   being new to linux i sujest you do your self a favour and read    "man intro "    and maybe   "man man "     <--- typing either in a terminal will be self explanitory.
