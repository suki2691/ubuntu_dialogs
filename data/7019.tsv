2011-12-18T01:55:00.000Z	escott	pzaul	the overlay is the resize overlay. you are close to the edge of the screen so it is indicating it will resize to full size. does it not go away
2011-12-18T01:58:00.000Z	pzaul	escott	if you see me exit again, thats why :( any ideas on how to cancel it
2011-12-18T02:01:00.000Z	escott	pzaul	not really. you could look into !ccsm and see if something there might be causing problems
