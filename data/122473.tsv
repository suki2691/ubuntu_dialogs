2008-03-25T19:36:00.000Z	dorkface		Hi all.  I'm trying to produce ascii characters for a project, but the way I am familiar with to make the characters, pressing alt+ 3 numbers, doesn't seem to work for me in ubuntu.  Any suggestions?
2008-03-25T19:37:00.000Z	unop	dorkface	use the gnome-character-map to import those characters
2008-03-25T19:37:00.000Z	dorkface	unop	ah, ty
2008-03-25T19:38:00.000Z	unop	dorkface	or use something like - perl -e 'print chr 10'
