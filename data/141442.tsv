2007-05-04T09:12:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	NewG	once you're in to the system, update your /boot/grub/menu.lst with the new values and run grub-install, telling it to install to your boot drive.
2007-05-04T09:13:00.000Z	SlimeyPete	NewG	I don't think so, but I'm not an expert. It might be able to - try typing "help" and playing around with the commands it lists.
