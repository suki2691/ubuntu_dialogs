2007-04-30T09:15:00.000Z	Blastur		hello.. i'm trying to run Ubuntu Live CD on my machine.. however, as the CD loads the UI, my screen goes black and puts up a sign saying "Non optimal mode 1440x900" and i can't see anything. If I boot the system in "safe graphics mode", it works, but the screen is too little to run the installer (the windows are too big, so I cannot press the Next-button in the Installer).. I have also tried to put more boot-options, like vga=7
