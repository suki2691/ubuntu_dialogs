2012-11-30T09:43:00.000Z	NewUbuntuUser		does anyone have any familiarity with installing wine?  I went through the software center, but the application doesn't show up
2012-11-30T09:43:00.000Z	NewUbuntuUser		only to configure it, remove it, and winetricks
2012-11-30T09:44:00.000Z	Ben64	NewUbuntuUser	you can't really run wine by itself, you need to run an exe with it
