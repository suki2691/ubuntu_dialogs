2011-11-28T05:57:00.000Z	digdeep		Hi, my laptop is very hot, after installing kernel 3.0.0-13. Has anyone tried to install this kernel fix --> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/PowerManagement
2011-11-28T05:59:00.000Z	szal	digdeep	that bug is supposed to be fixed w/ kernel 3.0.0-13, it was officially present in the preceding 3.0.0-12 though
2011-11-28T06:00:00.000Z	digdeep	szal	so the bug is not fixed in 3.0.0-13?
2011-11-28T06:01:00.000Z	szal	digdeep	I don't know really, I don't use powersaving for lack of a mobile device
