2010-10-13T11:56:00.000Z	Dalarist		Hello,  I've been having a devil of a time getting eth0 to actually pick up an IP address on boot.  After looking though threads new and old I'm no closer to a solution, anyone happen to be able to help me?

2010-10-13T11:58:00.000Z	Dalarist	histo	: network-manager is uninstalled, and /et/network/interfaces has been set to auto up eth0 and dhcp and still no go
