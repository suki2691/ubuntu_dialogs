2010-05-22T03:51:00.000Z	Fujk		I guess I will just run winxp on that machine instead
2010-05-22T03:52:00.000Z	Fujk		why do they make such a shitty release.. everything from not being able to read ATA drives, throwing errors on and after install. and when it finally is installed it wont boot. this is pathetic.. and yes, the disc / harddrive / cdrom is fine.
