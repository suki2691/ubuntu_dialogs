2005-01-16T07:11:00.000Z	tuxJr_14		can anyone show me the linux kernel's version.h file? I messed up the source and fuse is giving me errors
2005-01-16T07:12:00.000Z	kezz	tuxJr_14	should be able to get it on kernel.org
2005-01-16T07:13:00.000Z	tuxJr_14	kezz	they dont have the untarred ones up there
2005-01-16T07:15:00.000Z	tuxJr_14	kezz	actually, i used an unofficial patch of something and then it gave errors about the version so i deleted version.h
