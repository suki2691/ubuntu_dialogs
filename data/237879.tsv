2010-03-11T08:31:00.000Z	von_neumann		my friend reported it to me first, then just now it happend to me for the first time
2010-03-11T08:32:00.000Z	von_neumann		once I typed in my password at the screensaver the left mouse button worked again
2010-03-11T08:33:00.000Z	anto9us	von_neumann	is there much disk activity when this happens? It may be system load, is it a fancy 3d screensaver?
