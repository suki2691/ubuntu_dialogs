2011-05-23T11:04:00.000Z	tensorpudding	adwait_neo	open software center, search for vlc, click install
2011-05-23T11:05:00.000Z	tensorpudding	adwait_neo	another way would be to open up the applications lens, and search for vlc, it will appear in the Apps Available for Download section
2011-05-23T11:07:00.000Z	tensorpudding	adwait_neo	i don't know what that means
