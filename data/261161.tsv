2006-06-27T10:00:00.000Z	radman57		Hello!  I'm new to irc chat and I am looking to gather information on how to access a windows active directory domain remotely from a laptop running Ubuntu 6.0.6.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?
2006-06-27T10:02:00.000Z	radman57		running a laptop which is member of the domain in windows, but just installed ubuntu 6 [dual boot] .  would like to access my domain shares using a wireless connection from outside the firewall
2006-06-27T10:04:00.000Z	radman57		yes like windows file share - but the domain is behind ISA 2004 firewall
