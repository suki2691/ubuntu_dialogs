2006-09-07T11:50:00.000Z	pantaloon		i've got a dumb question: why doesn't ubuntu come with c libraries and a compiler preinstalled?
2006-09-07T11:51:00.000Z	webwolf_27	pantaloon	because ubuntu is for newbies, not developers. Developes know how to install one
2006-09-07T11:53:00.000Z	pantaloon	webwolf_27	i guess...pain in the arse tho...all i'm trying to do is get my crappy usb wi-fi adapter working
2006-09-07T11:54:00.000Z	webwolf_27	pantaloon	if you think thats bad try LFS
