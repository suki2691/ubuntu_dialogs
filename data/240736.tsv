2006-12-19T09:33:00.000Z	ken		Is there some place where we have a HUGE list of .debs, from where we can get a package if its not in ubuntu's repos. Something like Download.com for deb-based distributions...or whatever?
2006-12-19T09:34:00.000Z	SeamusLP	ken	sometimes the software devs will release debs, and sometimes people will put debs on the forums, but I don't know of any large collection outside of the repositories
2006-12-19T09:34:00.000Z	SeamusLP	ken	you can also use alien to convert rpm to deb
2006-12-19T09:34:00.000Z	ken	SeamusLP	Thats sad. Than tell me, what do you do to get a package not in ubuntu.
