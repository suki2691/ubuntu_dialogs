2007-12-23T02:08:00.000Z	thor	aaronh_	 I don't understand...if you don't want real time why use vnc?
2007-12-23T02:10:00.000Z	thor	aaronh_	you need to fetch it from the NoMachine website...there is a freenx in the repos...but it isn't being maintained as I understand it...the NoMachine version is much 'improved'
