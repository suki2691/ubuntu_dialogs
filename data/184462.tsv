2006-10-05T10:05:00.000Z	Draccy		I'm having trouble getting mkfs to work. How do I make the entire drive /dev/hdb1 with reiserfs using mkfs?

2006-10-05T10:06:00.000Z	orbin	Draccy	tried googling for tutes?  i usually just use gparted/qtparted
2006-10-05T10:07:00.000Z	Draccy	orbin	gparted doesn't seem up to the task of completely formatting the drive. It bitches.
