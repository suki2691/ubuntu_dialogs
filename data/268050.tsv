2005-12-05T07:37:00.000Z	Argblat		ok...thank you Oceansblue...my first question is: I just installed Ubuntu on my computer (not this one, but another one)....however, I installed version 5.04 which is the one they mailed to me...now I see that they have a newer version, and 1. Should I upgrade and 2.how to upgrade
2005-12-05T07:39:00.000Z	Argblat		Ubuntu seems to have some crazy names for it's releases...is there a chronological list?
2005-12-05T07:41:00.000Z	Argblat		so 5.04 was released may 2004?
2005-12-05T07:41:00.000Z	crimsun	Argblat	no, Apr 2005
