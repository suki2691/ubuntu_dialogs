2006-07-24T07:46:00.000Z	linuxForHumans2		I have a quick driver question, is there someone that could help me?
2006-07-24T07:47:00.000Z	Grok_	linuxForHumans2	no need to ask to ask...just ask it
2006-07-24T07:49:00.000Z	Grok_	linuxForHumans2	you need to be a bit more descriptive other than "it doesn't work"...error msgs, what you've done to try to get it to work, etc
2006-07-24T07:53:00.000Z	Grok_	linuxForHumans2	just a tip...linux usually only gives you back msgs when something's wrong. if it drops to a newline like that it's *usually* a good thing
