2007-11-21T11:05:00.000Z	musikgoat	geoaxis	are you asking about static dhcp?
2007-11-21T11:06:00.000Z	musikgoat		you want dhcp to assign an address based on a computers mac address?
2007-11-21T11:06:00.000Z	geoaxis	musikgoat	 well i am asking is there a way to lock a person down from assigning IP manually
