2010-03-03T20:17:00.000Z	ploum		hello
2010-03-03T20:18:00.000Z	ploum		can someone tell me how to remove the first b&w splash screen in ubuntu 9.10, the one between Grub and xsplash
2010-03-03T20:20:00.000Z	theadmin	ploum	I belive in GRUB1 you'd modify menu.lst, and put "nosplash" instead of "splash", but on grub2, no idea
2010-03-03T20:23:00.000Z	ploum	theadmin	I will try anyway
