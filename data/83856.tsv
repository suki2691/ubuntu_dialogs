2009-11-19T02:47:00.000Z	natbet		I'm setting up ircd-hybrid for a internal irc server, but chanserv and nickserv aren't there. Is there any settings that need to be changed to get them working?

2009-11-19T02:48:00.000Z	lstarnes	natbet	you need a separate services package for that, such as anope or atheme
2009-11-19T02:48:00.000Z	natbet	lstarnes	ah, that explains it, thanks
