2009-06-02T05:14:00.000Z	tonytraductor		hello.  I have just acquired an Everex Cloudbood, which came with Hardy on it.  I uninstalled gnome (all of it, yes), and installed Ion3, and now can't connect to wifi.  I set up wifi-radar with the same parameters as my ibm thinkpad (which has jaunty, and no gnome, but ion3) which connects fine, but when I try to connect from the cloudbook wifi-radar can't get an IP address
2009-06-02T05:14:00.000Z	tonytraductor		it connected to the wifi fine with the gnome network applet thingy, which is, of course, gone now
2009-06-02T05:16:00.000Z	tonytraductor		it sees my router, but can't get an IP for some reason
2009-06-02T05:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tonytraductor	does it work if you set an ip address?
