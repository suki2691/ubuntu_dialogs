2012-06-06T07:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jwcarman_	You're welcome. You should also check that you're a member of the other standard groups (on my machine "adm dialout cdrom plugdev lpadmin admin sambashare libvirtd" )
2012-06-06T07:40:00.000Z	jwcarman_	Jordan_U	do I need all of those other groups?
2012-06-06T07:41:00.000Z	jwcarman_	Jordan_U	if I'm in the sudo group, I can do anything I want as long as I provide a password, right?
