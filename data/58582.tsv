2011-02-27T21:26:00.000Z	Darael	thauriswulfa	Plenty.  I suggest http://tinyogg.com because it converts to a free and open format.
2011-02-27T21:30:00.000Z	Darael	thauriswulfa	in that case, try the youtube-dl package.
2011-02-27T21:31:00.000Z	Darael	thauriswulfa	In that case, my next suggestion is the clive package.
