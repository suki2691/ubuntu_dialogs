2009-04-03T00:25:00.000Z	baz		whats the proper way to share folder between ubuntu machines? When I go to sharing options it wants to install a windows service but there are no windows boxes...

2009-04-03T00:28:00.000Z	baz	s3r3n1t7	oh so its acceptable/effeicient to use it between linux boxes?
2009-04-03T00:28:00.000Z	s3r3n1t7	baz	it's acceptable and easy to use in my opinion. However, i'd recommend going for SSHFS. A bit more setup, much more secure, and much easier to integrate for a longer period of time.
