2007-11-27T09:06:00.000Z	mikebot		I'm trying to format a flash drive (vfat), how can I do this? (In GParted the device is locked...)
2007-11-27T09:06:00.000Z	scguy318	mikebot	you need to unmount the partition first :)
2007-11-27T09:06:00.000Z	scguy318	mikebot	then you can use GPartEd or CLI mkfs
2007-11-27T09:07:00.000Z	mikebot	scguy318	Is vfat the same as fat16?
