2004-12-08T07:25:00.000Z	scaroo		hi ppl ! it seems that a recent linux-image update has deleted my initrd file, so i m unable to boot ... quite anoying, is there a way to repair that without booting into another os and then chroot?
2004-12-08T07:26:00.000Z	lourens	scaroo	well if it doesn't boot then I don't see another option than to boot into something else to fix it...
2004-12-08T07:27:00.000Z	lourens		I'm there clockorange, so go ahead
2004-12-08T07:27:00.000Z	scaroo	lourens	of course but, dunno maybe a grub option or something
