2011-01-16T01:34:00.000Z	Gnea	kane77	no, you'd have to copy all of the files to another device, reformat, then copy them back... oh, and then you'd have to fix permissions on them
2011-01-16T01:34:00.000Z	kane77	Gnea	well that's the problem, I don't have enough space elsewhere so I hoped an in-place method would exist
2011-01-16T01:35:00.000Z	Gnea	kane77	well, you could use samba to access it
