2005-02-24T12:47:00.000Z	Drizzt321		I am looking to try installing ubuntu onto an amd64(with the amd64 version) on the new nforce4 motherboard. I have 2 sata disks on the nvidia ports with nvraid in raid0, however the sata_nv does not see it as '1' disk, but the 2 seperate ones. anyone else run into this problem? anyone hear anything about this issue?
2005-02-24T08:32:00.000Z	Drizzt321		does warty use standard /dev devices, or udev?
2005-02-24T08:32:00.000Z	lunitik	Drizzt321	udev
2005-02-24T08:33:00.000Z	Drizzt321	lunitik	MobyTurbo: thanks, I'll make sure to adjust my thinking, I'm used to standard dev.
