2009-04-10T21:48:00.000Z	fluitfries	n8tuser	i have the partition created, just wondering about the "boot" flag really.
2009-04-10T21:49:00.000Z	fluitfries	n8tuser	how would i do that?
2009-04-10T21:54:00.000Z	fluitfries	n8tuser	if am able to copy data to this parition that is marked as "ntfs", would you consider it to be formatted as ntfs as well?
