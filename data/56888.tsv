2009-10-17T22:30:00.000Z	AmbrNewlearner		erSUL: Ther other system has OpenSSHd running and they are using default 22 port....Any other ideas?
2009-10-17T22:31:00.000Z	grawity	AmbrNewlearner	Btw, since you're saying OpenSSHd every time - you mean it doesn't happen with other sshds? :)
2009-10-17T22:32:00.000Z	AmbrNewlearner	grawity	I never tried other sshd's ;)
2009-10-17T22:32:00.000Z	grawity	AmbrNewlearner	Anyway, erUSUL was asking about the error message you get. (If you don't get any, connect with ssh -v)
