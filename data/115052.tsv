2011-07-04T14:59:00.000Z	Viking667		Is there any way I can get apt-get to cough up exactly which version of a package will be installed with "apt-get install pkgname"?
2011-07-04T15:00:00.000Z	Viking667		err, right.
2011-07-04T15:00:00.000Z	blargg	Viking667	there's also a dry-run/simulate mode for apt-get, to see what it would do without actually doing it.
2011-07-04T15:01:00.000Z	Viking667	blargg	hm. It says fglrx-2:8.840-0ubuntu4
