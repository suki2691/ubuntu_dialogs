2006-07-28T09:12:00.000Z	_stev_		If I login in tty (without  xdm, gdm or kdm) can my X started automatically whithout the command startx?
2006-07-28T09:13:00.000Z	sproingie	_stev_	i dont get the question.  xdm is what starting X automatically means, startx is how you start it without those
2006-07-28T09:13:00.000Z	sproingie	_stev_	if you think X is already running, ctrl-alt-f7 will switch you to tty7 where X usually is running
2006-07-28T09:16:00.000Z	_stev_	sproingie	well I just want to start my X with my window manager without a graphical login screen
