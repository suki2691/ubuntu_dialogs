2008-07-22T06:15:00.000Z	Rolaulten		Good evening, Seems like I am having some strange wireless issues with my Ubuntu install...best I can see I have the drivers loaded, however it does not seem like any packets are being sent from my PC to the router....and yet I know the network is running because I am able to read this IRC on a different PC
2008-07-22T06:16:00.000Z	__yy_	Rolaulten	can you ping the not working box from the pc you're on now?
2008-07-22T06:18:00.000Z	__yy_	Rolaulten	run ifconfig on the unworking machine and check its ip then.
2008-07-22T06:19:00.000Z	__yy_	Rolaulten	can't open a terminal? That bodes worse than network problems...
