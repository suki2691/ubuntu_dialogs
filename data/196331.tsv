2008-09-26T11:21:00.000Z	phantomcircuit	dystopia	the section of that page you linked to is talking about using a python script, not virtualbox
2008-09-26T11:22:00.000Z	dystopia	phantomcircuit	but its referring to qemu library which virtualbox also uses
2008-09-26T11:22:00.000Z	phantomcircuit	dystopia	in fact the kvm module talked about in that article explicitly is NOT VirtualBox
