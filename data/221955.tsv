2006-03-17T17:57:00.000Z	kbrooks	Gorth-	No. At least, I don't think so.
2006-03-17T17:57:00.000Z	Gorth-	kbrooks	ahh ok, I was hoping it was possible to do so via. some sort of loopback
2006-03-17T17:57:00.000Z	kbrooks	Gorth-	permissioins on a fat32 filesystem are limited to 644 (read/write, read, read)
