2012-08-15T09:18:00.000Z	G__81		i would like to know whether 12.04 would get the latest Unity updates ?
2012-08-15T09:18:00.000Z	G__81		or is it mandatory that i got to upgrade to 12.10 once its released ?
2012-08-15T09:19:00.000Z	G__81		The reason being i have some irritating bugs that i see in Unity and hence want to know if there are updates which would be rolled out for 12.04 (especially in Unity) and would i get to run the version of Unity that would be available in 12.10 ?
