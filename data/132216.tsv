2011-06-27T06:37:00.000Z	IsleVegan	learningc	one difference is that the live version does not save or change anything on the computer.
2011-06-27T06:38:00.000Z	IsleVegan	learningc	it is mainly used to see what ubuntu looks like, check for hardware compatibility and maybe do some hard drive partitioning / resizing
2011-06-27T06:39:00.000Z	IsleVegan	learningc	i don't know much about that, sorry. perhaps you can be more detailed in your inquiry to get a response from others.
