2008-07-09T02:22:00.000Z	billgoldberg		I was wondering how I can get sound through my usb headset instead of the build in speakers?
2008-07-09T02:22:00.000Z	billgoldberg		I presume I can't use alsamixer when using pulseaudio
2008-07-09T02:23:00.000Z	Firefishe	billgoldberg	 I have to use the esound backend in kde when using pulseaudio
2008-07-09T02:23:00.000Z	Firefishe	billgoldberg	 but the mixer should still work
