2005-07-04T12:14:00.000Z	goofyheadedpunk		I just installed Ubuntu on an HP Pavilion N3390 and both the console and X environments had a ~3cm border around the content of the screen and the border of the monitor. The console gap was fixed by using a 1024x784 frame buffer, but I don't know how to fix X or even what to google for.
