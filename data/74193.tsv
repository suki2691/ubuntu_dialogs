2009-01-27T13:11:00.000Z	mathijs		Hi all, I'm trying to connect to another X11 server (so I want client applications on my machine to display on a screen attached on another machine). I don't want to enable tcp on the remote server, so I need to connect to the unix-socket over there. How can I do this?
