2010-03-28T23:33:00.000Z	bjwebb	SamuelPeterson	yes, Xorg can run on mac, but most apps use something called Aqua
2010-03-28T23:33:00.000Z	SamuelPeterson	bjwebb	ah, I guess I am misinformed then.
2010-03-28T23:34:00.000Z	bjwebb	SamuelPeterson	well, like i say, xorg will run on mac, and some apps use it and require you to install it (e.g. open office 2.0), but most things use apple's own toolkits, which is the big difficulty in hacking it to run on linux
