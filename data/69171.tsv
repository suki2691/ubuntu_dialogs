2010-01-03T16:16:00.000Z	biopyte	oCean_	ubottu, when ufw is not enabled, do  i still have network protection? if so, why are there no filter rules according to iptables -L?
2010-01-03T16:17:00.000Z	oCean_	biopyte	w/out ufw running, you have no "protection" on the machine. See the links in the !ufw factoid
2010-01-03T16:19:00.000Z	biopyte	oCean_	thanks for the info. great, so i have been without any protection all the time. i wonnder, why ufw is not enabled per default. thanks a lot, oCean, i"m going to reboot.
