2009-08-13T04:26:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard		Is there any way to view web traffic (coming and going) on my laptop?
2009-08-13T04:27:00.000Z	mzz	Mike_lifeguard	you might like "iftop", depending on what you mean
2009-08-13T04:27:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	mzz	something like a list of urls being requested would be nice
2009-08-13T04:27:00.000Z	mzz	Mike_lifeguard	iftop won't do that
