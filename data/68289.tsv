2009-01-21T07:17:00.000Z	Luke9		I got a question
2009-01-21T07:17:00.000Z	Luke9		My friend downloaded Ubuntu, and can't connect to his wireless network.  I didn't have that problem since my version of Ubuntu came with the drivers I needed.  What does he do?
2009-01-21T07:18:00.000Z	MK131	Luke9	what wireless card does he have?
