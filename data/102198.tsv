2010-01-24T06:14:00.000Z	rww	zomfgcrazy	the partition table format you're using supports a maximum of four partitions. Windows and Ubuntu get around this by making the fourth partition an "extended partition" with more pretend-partitions (that look and act just like regular ones) crammed inside it.
2010-01-24T06:14:00.000Z	rww	zomfgcrazy	the pretend partitions are called "logical" oens
2010-01-24T06:15:00.000Z	rww	zomfgcrazy	yes :)
