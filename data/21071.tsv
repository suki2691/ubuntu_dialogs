2011-01-04T20:09:00.000Z	nogatezfan		I need to repair ubuntu 10.10 64 bit. I deleted some orphan files that I reviewed, that I guess were needed so I screwed up. I need to overinstall I believe. I have the install cd. does anyone know of repair guide I can look at or does anyone have any suggestions?

2011-01-04T20:11:00.000Z	Sriram	nogatezfan	Yes
2011-01-04T20:11:00.000Z	Sriram	nogatezfan	FIrst you have to apt-get install it
