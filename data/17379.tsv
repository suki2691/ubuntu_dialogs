2012-02-08T01:04:00.000Z	gabebug	trism	thanks for that link. is it common to take 1+ month to patch a DoS vulnerability like this?
2012-02-08T01:10:00.000Z	trism	gabebug	the cve you mentioned it only from a few days ago, the "fix" for the cve about a month ago introduced it
2012-02-08T01:12:00.000Z	gabebug	trism	true, and i do see there was action on it yesterday too.  the link seemed also directed at a DoS vulnerability from a month ago.  I was just realizing that I hadn't done much in the way of researching ubuntu's historical turn around time on vulnerabilities
