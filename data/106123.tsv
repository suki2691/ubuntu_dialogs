2008-01-28T02:25:00.000Z	ThipThip	emma	matt__:  I was told the same thing, but my experience doesn't fit that story.  Yes, it takes some tweaking and customization, but that's Ubuntu, no?  The performance of the 64-bit version is just.... so.... great.
2008-01-28T02:26:00.000Z	emma	ThipThip	 that's interesting. But you were able to get Flash working consistently in all applications?
2008-01-28T02:27:00.000Z	ThipThip	emma	 No that's the one problem I'm having.  I mean, I can get flash working in all applications, but I seem to have to install different versions for different situations.
