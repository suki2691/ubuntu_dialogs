2008-10-12T08:45:00.000Z	jspiro		all : is there an IRC channel for Ubuntu Christian Edition?  I have a dansguardian-related question, but the people in #dansguardian haven't answered me yet.  (There are only 3 people there.)
2008-10-12T08:45:00.000Z	jspiro		maybe a Ubuntu CE channel could also help me
2008-10-12T08:45:00.000Z	Dar1us	jspiro	tried the dansguardian mailing list?
2008-10-12T08:46:00.000Z	jspiro	Dar1us	I will try that next.
