2005-10-23T11:27:00.000Z	r0xoR	shadeofgrey	errr... try OO.org
2005-10-23T11:28:00.000Z	r0xoR	shadeofgrey	i know you can turn .doc files into .pdf files with OO.org but i don't know about the other way around
2005-10-23T11:28:00.000Z	r0xoR	shadeofgrey	probably yeah, but there's xpdf for reading them, among others
