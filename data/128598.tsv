2008-11-19T07:08:00.000Z	Symgeosis	Chrisie	thanks. There is also a xine_config file in there (which seems rather redundant imo) but it still does not seem to make a difference.
2008-11-19T07:10:00.000Z	Symgeosis	Chrisie	nevermind. I set it to alsa instead of "pulse" (as the pulse website instructs) or "pulseaudio" (which is in the gxine config file) and it works. Thanks!
