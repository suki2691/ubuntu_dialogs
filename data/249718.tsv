2007-03-03T11:54:00.000Z	Narqulie		Ok.. How can I edit Xorg.conf (since it's read only)
2007-03-03T11:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Narqulie	 its writeable by the root user only.  :)
2007-03-03T12:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Narqulie	 no.
2007-03-03T12:34:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Narqulie	 apt-get remove whatever.. :) or just edit the xorg.conf to use the other drivers
