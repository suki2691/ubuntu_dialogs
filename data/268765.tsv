2005-07-02T10:22:00.000Z	GameJunky		is there a way to test a tar archive like you can with Rar? i've made about 10 backup cd's .. and i've put all the files in a rar archive then burned the archive to cd.. when i test the archive i get errors all the time. i dont know if it's Rar's fault, but i'd like to test tar out if i can test the archives after i burn them
