2006-12-12T08:39:00.000Z	pinchartl		I'd like to request an openldap backport for edgy. I compiled openldap2.3 (apt-get build-dev openldap2.3 && apt-get source -b openldap-2.3) successfully. the .deb packages install without any problem, but both libldap-2.2.26 and libldap-2.3.29 are now installed side by side. would that make the backport invalid per rule 3. (No new libraries that have negative impact on ANY other system component) ?
2006-12-12T08:40:00.000Z	pinchartl		ok, I'll try requesting it then
2006-12-12T08:41:00.000Z	pinchartl		openldap2.3 is the source package, and is split in libldap, slapd and ldap-util after compilation
