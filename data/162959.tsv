2011-01-30T23:27:00.000Z	Ugons		Question: I'm on OS X as of now and I don't feel like partitioning my HD. I want to get an external HD to install ubuntu on, but I'm not sure which would be best. Any suggestions?
2011-01-30T23:28:00.000Z	Ugons		Alright, and to install to the external HD I basically follow the same installation process but just choose that as the location?
