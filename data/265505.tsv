2005-11-25T07:10:00.000Z	EloraKun		Hey guys. Is it sensible installing 2 different distros sharing a /home mount? (Breezy + Mandriva 2006)
2005-11-25T07:10:00.000Z	beezly	EloraKun	yeah - that shouldn't be a problem
2005-11-25T07:10:00.000Z	beezly	EloraKun	you /might/ have some problems with some applications - if they do nasty things with different version of their config files for example, but Iit should work ok
2005-11-25T07:11:00.000Z	beezly	EloraKun	well, i've done it before and it's never been a problem, but it *could* be in theory
