2012-09-04T18:26:00.000Z	pipe1984		i have a netbook hp dm1-4130ss with ati radeon hd 6320. Im using driver catalyst 12.8 and i have had 400 fps, but when i connecting hdmi out in my tv fullhd the resolution isn't possible configure at 1920x10080 only 1366x768, why?
2012-09-04T18:27:00.000Z	FlowRiser	pipe1984	read the tvs manual and see the maximum resolution of it; Sometimes they are locked for some input ports
2012-09-04T18:28:00.000Z	pipe1984	FlowRiser	ok i will try i hope be that
2012-09-04T18:32:00.000Z	pipe1984	FlowRiser	when i change resolution in control panel from Ati Catalyst the resolution max is 1366x768 but if i change resolution in control panel from monitors setting i can change to 1920x1080 but when i apply ubuntu send me a error. however i will see manual's tv
