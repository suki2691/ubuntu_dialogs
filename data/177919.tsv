2007-12-07T04:29:00.000Z	ASTX813		I've been using Ubnto for 2 years now and still don't know my way out of a minor annoyance I keep running into.  If I forgot to put & at the end of a command, is there any keystroke to get the same effect after the fact?  (So I can close the terminal without killing the program I've launched, perhaps)
2007-12-07T04:30:00.000Z	ASTX813		Thanks, astro76, I knew it had a simple fix.  I knew CTRL-Z and fg to bring back, but didn't know bg.
2007-12-07T04:32:00.000Z	ASTX813		Now here's a real mind bender.  Anyone tried messing around with Quicken in crossover?  I'm trying to find a way to trick pocket quicken into working.
