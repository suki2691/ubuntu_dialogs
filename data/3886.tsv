2012-04-21T21:56:00.000Z	mirko2	Xtreme	 you need a compositing window manager like compiz (or fake one with xcompmgr)
2012-04-21T21:57:00.000Z	Xtreme	mirko2	means? coz maybe that is my problem.. when i set the transparency though profile.. i see my wallpaper.. escott, yes its fake one..
2012-04-21T22:02:00.000Z	mirko2	Xtreme	the more interesting question is which ubuntu version. the (older) standard ubuntu windowmanager metacity doesn not do real alpha-channel transparency. either you need to use compiz (that thing with the cool 3D cube) or install xcompmgr (a command line program) and run it.
