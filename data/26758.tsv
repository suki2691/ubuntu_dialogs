2010-08-31T00:17:00.000Z	whitepheasant		Can someone show me how to use a sudo command that will bypass the password prompt?         (Of course I'm hoping I can just "PRE ENTER" my password whist, using the command).        So this can be a one time only use of sudo.

2010-08-31T01:21:00.000Z	whitepheasant	erUSUL	Changing the port number didn't do what I expected. Regardless oof that 5-digit port I do, I still asks me to run the script as root.  This is because Xampp made the program to behave that way. (There can be some workarounds, but I will not bother with that. Thanks anyway, You too jrib).
