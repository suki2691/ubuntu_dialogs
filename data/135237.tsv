2008-11-01T13:29:00.000Z	AciD		I installed ubuntu 8.10 and it works great ! Now I installed some kde apps too (by using apt-get install kde). What I don't figure is why the 'systemsettings' (replacement for kcontrol) is so 'empty' : I only have 8 icons in the general tab, and only 'icons' and 'emoticons' in the appeareance one
2008-11-01T13:31:00.000Z	AciD		I'm a kde apps fan, I just don't really like the panel :> but I don't get why there is so few configuration option in systemsettings, I saw a lot more on some screenshots
