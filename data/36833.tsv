2010-03-28T03:03:00.000Z	trevor		Hey. I want to upgrade to lucid lynx when it comes out in April, and I'm wondering if just upgrading from karmic koala is ok, or if I should just do a fresh install?
2010-03-28T03:03:00.000Z	trevor		I ask this because getting wireless working was annoying last time, and I'd like to avoid that if at all possiuble.
2010-03-28T03:03:00.000Z	Typos_King	trevor	   I'd suggest a fresh install
2010-03-28T03:04:00.000Z	Typos_King	trevor	   fresh installs are always preferred to upgrades when the choice is there, upgrades often don't go smooth
