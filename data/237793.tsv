2006-04-09T10:05:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick		considering debian is meant for that and ubuntu is based on debian
2006-04-09T10:05:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick		that is, if you're considering ubuntu on a server
2006-04-09T10:06:00.000Z	blujay	FliesLikeABrick	I don't know...Ubuntu sometimes has quicker security updates, and the next version will have support for 5 years for the server
