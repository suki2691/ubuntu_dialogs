2006-01-17T09:12:00.000Z	tolstoy	TestDummy	is there something you can set in .gtkrc?  I've blocked all memory of that stuff out.
2006-01-17T09:13:00.000Z	tolstoy	TestDummy	maybe you can at least google for that file and what to put in it.
2006-01-17T09:14:00.000Z	tolstoy	TestDummy	yeah, i know, i know, but sometimes I, at least, don't know what to google for, so come here for a hint.
