2012-02-22T13:18:00.000Z	Kindari		I have a monitor connected to a server, I want to be able to control whats on it via ssh. I was thinking best solution would probably be using screen or tmux. Would any body have other opinions? And if that is the way to go, can I configure either to drop into a screen/tmux session at startup automaticly?

2012-02-22T13:20:00.000Z	somsip	Kindari	I run tmux on servers i maintain. Just setup an alias to "autossh -t tmux a" once tmux is running and that's about it
