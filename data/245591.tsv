2008-02-02T18:53:00.000Z	Arelis		Guys, after i've tried out many, many linux distro's, i've finally come to a conclusion: Something is wrong with this PC. nearly EVERY linux distro is as unstable as heck. Can anybody help me find out why?

2008-02-02T18:55:00.000Z	Arelis	ompaul	I'm sorry, but i don't have the money for a new PC. And i did a memtest about a month ago.
