2012-03-14T17:22:00.000Z	Draconicus		I have lost three years of configuration data while trying to fight Compiz. It's my own fault. I think I have a right to be a little upset though.
2012-03-14T17:23:00.000Z	Draconicus		I moved .config, started the Xfce desktop I like to use, found that compiz wasn't working, moved .config back, and then logged out. It overwrote everything withe the defaults. Oh well.
