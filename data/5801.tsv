2012-09-27T18:37:00.000Z	lduros		hello folks! I would like Ubuntu to boot with text information (like debian) instead of having the splash screen at boot time. How can I do that? Thanks
2012-09-27T18:38:00.000Z	lduros		I still want lightdm or whatever to kick in, just I want to see the services starting texts etc at boot time instead of the dots and ubuntu logo

2012-09-27T18:39:00.000Z	lduros	cfhowlett	but I already installed ubuntu.
