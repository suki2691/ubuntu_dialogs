2006-09-03T05:25:00.000Z	jak		Is it OK to mix edgy packages with dapper?
2006-09-03T05:27:00.000Z	jak		ok. So is edgy basically equivalent to debian unstable then in terms of guarantees
2006-09-03T05:27:00.000Z	jak		I mean does edgy basically work, but no guarantees
2006-09-03T05:27:00.000Z	Flannel	jak	no.  Edgy is alpha right now.  Once it's released, it will be fully supported, etc
