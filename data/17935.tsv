2011-02-21T20:03:00.000Z	Norrlanning		Anyone knows how to successfully change the low-res bootsplash in Ubuntu 10.10? I think I have to edit the /lib/plymouth/ubuntu-text.so however that doesn't do it. I just edited it with ghex and tried it but I broke something by doing so. So now I'm back to scratch :-/

2011-02-21T20:13:00.000Z	Norrlanning	g_0_0	Doesn't seem to be possible to change the text. Just to enable or disable text. I want to change the default "Ubuntu 10.10" low res splash to something else..
