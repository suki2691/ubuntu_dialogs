2010-01-06T05:18:00.000Z	R4v		Hey, could anyone help me out?
2010-01-06T05:19:00.000Z	R4v		I was thinking of making a custom LiveCD for certain purposes but i love #crunchbang, so i was wondering if there was a way i could somehow modify what tools are installed on live CD when i boot it.   crunchbang is a ubuntu based distro btw.

2010-01-06T05:19:00.000Z	R4v	LJR	it's ubuntu based.
