2010-01-07T03:34:00.000Z	enduser000		can anyone tell me how to put different wallpapers on different workspaces with ubutnu 9.10 like on the slide show on http://www.ubuntu.com/ ?

2010-01-07T03:35:00.000Z	VCoolio	enduser000	no, ubuntu-tweak also possible, does the same I think
2010-01-07T03:36:00.000Z	enduser000	VCoolio	ok thanks
