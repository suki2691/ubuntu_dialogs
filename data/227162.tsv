2005-07-21T12:12:00.000Z	gijosh		Hey.  I created an extra partition on another hard drive.  How do I format it with reiserfs.
2005-07-21T12:14:00.000Z	gijosh		Is there a way to mount two different partitions to /home?  I'm running out of space for my /home partition, and I have an entirely seperate hard drive for extra space.  I set up a partition on it, and I'm about to format it.

2005-07-21T12:15:00.000Z	gijosh	evillight	 Yea I figured I could.  burner:  Well, I'm sure developers could figure out a way. ;)
