2009-11-09T17:28:00.000Z	yareckon		nope..
2009-11-09T17:29:00.000Z	yareckon		but I did try to upgrade last week, and it refused stating I had held an obsolete package or something
2009-11-09T17:29:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	yareckon	I saw an update recently -- update-manager-core.  Update/Upgrade your machine.  See if there are any new packages.
