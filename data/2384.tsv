2012-06-19T01:28:00.000Z	Jazire_		can anyone tell me...if I delete the icons at my sidebar, then delete any files I see on my computer...will that be enough to consider the program uninstalled?

2012-06-19T01:29:00.000Z	Jazire_		I have tried uninstalling it through the Software Center and it just won't do a clean uninstall
2012-06-19T01:30:00.000Z	Jazire_	ekaj	  I have done rm -rf ~/.wine and that hasn't gotten rid of everything
