2010-10-15T19:02:00.000Z	jpastore	h00k	thanks. I'm capable of upgrading I have done so several times...but it's a common occurrence to be punished for upgrading. I'll check the links...but I was looking more for personal experience rather than prefab well intentioned documentation...
2010-10-15T19:03:00.000Z	h00k	jpastore	The documentation lists any known issues. I can say that it 'Worked For Me,' anyway :)
2010-10-15T19:04:00.000Z	jpastore	h00k	thanks =) I have an unresolved audio issue from upgrading from 9.x to 10.4 where I have no audio until I bring the level to 20% then 20-100% sounds like 100% I hope this upgrade fixes that so I don't have to reformat the laptop and start all over again.
