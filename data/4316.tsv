2012-03-31T07:49:00.000Z	Pancakez		I've been happily running 11.10, but suddenly youtube videos are tinted blue, and text in chromium seems to randomly loose pixels/have lines through it. I upgraded my nvidia-drivers to nvidia-current-updates, and replaced the flashplugin-installer package with the adobe-flashplugin. Neither had any effect. anybody have any ideas?

2012-03-31T07:51:00.000Z	Pancakez	bitplane-	I don't seem to have gnash installed
2012-03-31T07:51:00.000Z	bitplane-	Pancakez	ah, sorry. ignore me then
