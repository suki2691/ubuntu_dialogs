2010-07-08T04:28:00.000Z	dugger5688	trickx51	make a persistent install and boot it, install the software. It should retain the software from then on.
2010-07-08T04:31:00.000Z	dugger5688	trickx51	There's a guide around for a custom install disk, I made one awhile ago with OpenOffice and most stuff removed to run virus scans on windows partitions ;-) I would help you but I gtg, try searching around on the web.
