What i want to do is take a little space from all pcs in my local area network and have them share some folders, the point is a have no idea how to do that because some are ubuntu/linux and some are xp
2012-04-19T01:02:00.000Z	drvanon		do you guys have any idea how to start this from an ununtu laptop?
2012-04-19T01:03:00.000Z	Fizzik	drvanon	install ubuntu-server and during the install select the samba server install package
2012-04-19T01:18:00.000Z	Fizzik	drvanon	install samba on the ubuntu machine and look up a samba guide on google?
