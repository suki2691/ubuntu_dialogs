2006-09-29T14:16:00.000Z	dyn-afk	B4L1STA	& JamieBE use the IFS driver (www.fs-driver.org) which is the ext2 driver for windows
2006-09-29T14:16:00.000Z	dyn-afk		it can read and write files on ext2 and ext3 partitions
2006-09-29T14:17:00.000Z	dyn-afk		ext3 is backwards compatible with ext2 and that's why you can use the IFS driver with ext3
