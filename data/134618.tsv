2009-04-01T21:43:00.000Z	jatt		hi, I open a file with .tex extension using firefox. When I click on the URL a window titled "Opening gant.tex" is shown. When I choose Browse... in that window I get the message: "The application you chose ("(null)") could not be found".
2009-04-01T21:44:00.000Z	jatt		How do I tell firefox to open gedit instead?
