2005-05-02T09:02:00.000Z	queuetue		Hi - I have an ubuntu server ("A") with a printer attached.  A second machine ("B") would like to use that printer.  Can anyone explain the process of making this work?

2005-05-02T09:03:00.000Z	queuetue	balor	Yes, I *KNOW* I'll be using cuos. :)  I'm asking for an explanation of how to use cups to accomplish this.
