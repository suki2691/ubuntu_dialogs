2009-12-13T22:45:00.000Z	cq		hello, what's the best FS type to use at present for a system disk and a separate data disk? ext2, 3, or 4? I don't need super high performance, priority is stability and I do want journaling
2009-12-13T22:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cq	 if you want to play it safe stick with ext3
2009-12-13T22:47:00.000Z	cq	Dr_Willis	ok, thanks, that would have been my guess too... ext4 too new, ext2 didn't have journaling yet, right?
2009-12-13T22:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cq	 basically. Ive had no issues with ext4. but use what you want
