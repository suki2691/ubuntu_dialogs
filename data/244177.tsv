2007-04-20T14:51:00.000Z	Terrasque	zilly6_	nope, they use the old true and tried "lets get a shitload of mirrors on fat pipes" way
2007-04-20T14:53:00.000Z	Terrasque	zilly6_	I think there is an experimentel project on that.
2007-04-20T14:54:00.000Z	Terrasque	zilly6_	maybe take a look at https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/apt-torrent
