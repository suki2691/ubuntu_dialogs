2012-07-01T00:50:00.000Z	linuxsage		hi, I got into a little mess, out of ignorance I removed network manager from the terminal, after hours of trying to get it back I finally installed it manually using the .deb package and I have wireless connection back but now I cant get the icon to appear on my dektop panel..I will be grateful for any help

2012-07-01T00:53:00.000Z	linuxsage	ActionParsnip	I tried that and I got this error " error while loading shared libraries: libnm-glib.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
