2006-12-12T08:30:00.000Z	klotho		hello... I was wondering, if I have an existing XP installation, can I install ubuntu on it without having to reinstall xp?
2006-12-12T08:30:00.000Z	klotho		thanks Mastastealth. is there a particular procedure I should follow?
2006-12-12T08:31:00.000Z	klotho		I tried that with an existing Win2000 installation and it said it couldn't shrink it
