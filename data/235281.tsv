2006-12-17T15:22:00.000Z	whyameye	evil_	yes. But flash9 solves it.
2006-12-17T15:28:00.000Z	whyameye	evil_	maybe nolimitsoya is right about flash9 now in the repos. If not, I followed the directions here: http://dschneller.blogspot.com/2006/10/flash-9-beta-in-ubuntu-dapper.html
2006-12-17T15:29:00.000Z	whyameye	evil_	nolimitsoya: it *does* appear that the backports for dapper include version 9. So I stand corrected. Sorry.
