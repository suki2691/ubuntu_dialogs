2012-11-12T01:06:00.000Z	Derbie		I am anti-computer, i hardly know what is the difference between a CPU and RAM. Which version of ubuntu should i get for an old laptop from 2007, on which i use yahoo messenger, browser, youtube, gmail, .DOC .XLS files and teamviewer? I do not play PC games. Thank you :-)
