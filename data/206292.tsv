2006-11-12T08:02:00.000Z	Genrl_Zod		Ok this is my story. My 80gb master disk is partioned in 3 (2gb for linux swap file, 35 gig for WinXP and teh rest for Ubuntu). When i boot up my PC i get a nice window asking me which OS to choose. I can boot in both (ubuntu/winxp) fine. Now in my windows i have installed VMWare. In VMware i have set it up so that it uses the physical installation of ubuntu to boot up in VMWare. The session boots up, gets to the Ubuntu screen, the loader starts
