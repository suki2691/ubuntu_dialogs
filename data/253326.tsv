2009-03-22T02:12:00.000Z	irbdavid		Hi.  Running 8.10 on a dell netbook - is there anything I can do about fixed-height windows running off the bottom of my screen?
2009-03-22T02:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	irbdavid	 the 'eeebuntu' wiki page have some tweaks for that.. one tweak lets you 'alt-click' and drag a window UP past the panel so you can get to the bottom of the windows
