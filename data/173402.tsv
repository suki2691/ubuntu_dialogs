2009-09-06T06:25:00.000Z	Psibr		I need tons of codecs, I'm an AV freak. How do I get those codecs stuffed into my ubuntu install without an internet connection ?
2009-09-06T06:27:00.000Z	Psibr		trolling would be ranting and raving about why I can't play mp3s on a fresh ubuntu install. ;)
2009-09-06T06:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Psibr	you need to install the codec
2009-09-06T06:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Psibr	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras  will take care of MP3 AVI and other things like that
