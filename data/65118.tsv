2010-10-22T20:50:00.000Z	chuckh1958		Why would live CD think a hdd partition is busy when it is not mounted? How can I "unbusy" it?
2010-10-22T20:50:00.000Z	rww	chuckh1958	is it a swap partition?
2010-10-22T20:50:00.000Z	chuckh1958		rww:No its ext3 or 4. It was my 10.10 VM's partition but the VM stopped booting suddenly.
2010-10-22T20:54:00.000Z	chuckh1958	rww	any other ideas?
