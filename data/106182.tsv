2008-01-12T06:28:00.000Z	daftpunkk		i can't get into ubuntu. i have repaired installation of windows xp on partition sda3 (~500gb) using the windows cd becase of a "ntldr is missing" error. after the successful reparation, that grub screen does not show up in the bottom. ubuntu is installed on an 8gb partition. Sensitive material is on that partition that I cannot loose!

2008-01-12T06:35:00.000Z	daftpunkk	nickrud	will not eidting this "bootloader" give me that ntloader error again?
2008-01-12T06:35:00.000Z	nickrud	daftpunkk	hopefully not. if you tell me your windows partition and put a copy of the menu.lst on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org I'll help you set up a standard windows boot
