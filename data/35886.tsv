2010-10-25T01:56:00.000Z	Swian	Ichat	I like gnome, but didn't care for the interface, performance wise it was ok
2010-10-25T01:59:00.000Z	Ichat	Swian	i like gnome also on my   dualcore  turion x64 notebook with 2gb ram and on my   triple-core  desktop with  6gb ram.   hell  i want nothing but gnome.  - but on a old p4 subnotebook (dell 110L)  and an acer 10inc netbook  (both 1gb ram )  i rather have sothing that is more light and uses as little resources as possible.
