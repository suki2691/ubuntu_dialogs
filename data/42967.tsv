2010-05-13T17:10:00.000Z	mah2223	llutz	also i tried your command and it simply returned the original prompt
2010-05-13T17:10:00.000Z	mah2223	llutz	if you're still interested in my case
2010-05-13T17:11:00.000Z	llutz	mah2223	then your / should be  mounted rw now, try to fix your fstab or whatever your issue was
