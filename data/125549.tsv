2010-03-12T07:00:00.000Z	nwidger		so i created a usb startup disk using the utility in the system menu, plug it into my computer, ensure that boot off usb is enabled and try to boot off of it but nothing happens, the computer just sits there with a black screen.  so i burn the image to a dvd and plug in my external dvd drive and try to boot off that and get the same problem.  anyone have any idea what i might be doing wrong?

2010-03-12T07:02:00.000Z	nwidger	earthen	hmm okay ill try waiting i suppose
2010-03-12T07:02:00.000Z	earthen	nwidger	I tried one one computer and the screen went blank for what seemed like 5 min
