2005-02-09T09:17:00.000Z	farruinn	jcurry	look in /etc/X11, if you have XF86Config-4 you'r ein warty, if it's Xorg.conf you're in hoary
2005-02-09T09:18:00.000Z	farruinn	jcurry	but I can't imagine you could upgrade to hoary w/o knowing about it ;)
2005-02-09T09:18:00.000Z	jcurry	farruinn	thanks, but i gotta go now
