2005-08-31T10:38:00.000Z	Rangitoto		I am thinking of buying a computer which has a 700MHz Celeron and 128Mb RAM. Is that satisfactory for Ubuntu?

2005-08-31T10:39:00.000Z	kirtis	Rangitoto	To elaborate, nearly any processor is fine, but you really want 256+ to be comfortable.
2005-08-31T10:40:00.000Z	kirtis	Rangitoto	512 is the sweet spot though.
