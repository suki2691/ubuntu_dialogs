2012-05-13T23:28:00.000Z	PySharky	MonkeyDust	yea i know all about root the point is i simple need it for my development box, besides this box is not meant to be a desktop box just dev
2012-05-13T23:29:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	PySharky	 guess it's not possible to login as root, not sure, though
2012-05-13T23:30:00.000Z	PySharky	MonkeyDust	actually it is possible  and quite easy, the question is how to change the root account to gnome classic it is stuck in unity even though gnome classic is installed/selected
