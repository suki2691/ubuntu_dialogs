2007-07-07T10:23:00.000Z	Samad		hello all, is there any easy way to give myself full read/write permission for everything in Feisty?
2007-07-07T10:23:00.000Z	pike_	Samad	sudo -i :)
2007-07-07T10:25:00.000Z	pike_	Samad	what are you trying to do?  if you need to copy and move files in gui you can launch an app with sudo like ... gksu nautilus&
