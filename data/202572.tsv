2006-01-08T13:05:00.000Z	Belboz99		Hey all, I've got a problem trying to install a piece of software from source using make
2006-01-08T13:05:00.000Z	mwe	Belboz99	yeah. first stip is to install build-essential if you didn't
2006-01-10T15:39:00.000Z	mwe	Belboz99	just sudo -i to get a root prompt if you need it
2006-01-10T15:40:00.000Z	Belboz99	mwe	thanks, didn't know that one :)
