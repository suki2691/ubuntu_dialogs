2008-11-12T10:00:00.000Z	justizin	ralf	not yet, but i'm eager to hear about successes..
2008-11-12T10:01:00.000Z	ralf	justizin	i followed the instruction on the ubuntu help site and wifi did not work
2008-11-12T10:04:00.000Z	justizin	ralf	did you consider inspecting the working linux system that comes installed on the aspire one? :)
