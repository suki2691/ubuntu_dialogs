2011-12-14T12:26:00.000Z	peggys_mouse		i no longer seem to have access to many settings. is a common recent problem?
2011-12-14T12:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	peggys_mouse	 things have been getting reordered.. so it depends on what settings you mean
2011-12-14T12:27:00.000Z	peggys_mouse	dr_willis	it isn't that the settings are missing, they are greyed out. locked.
2011-12-14T12:28:00.000Z	peggys_mouse	dr_willis	for instance, if i go to user account settings, the unlock button is now greyed out. i can't edit a user's info.
