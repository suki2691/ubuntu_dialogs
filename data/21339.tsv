2011-10-13T18:19:00.000Z	Darael	compdoc	The upgrade process is pretty safe, as a rule, but you might as well make a backup anyway, as you'd have to for a reinstall - just in case.  It's highly unlikely you'll have any major issues.
2011-10-13T18:55:00.000Z	Darael	compdoc	11.10 allows choosing the gnome desktop, AIUI, but not gnome2, since it's no longer supported.
