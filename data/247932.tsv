2006-06-18T10:04:00.000Z	jabr_		anyone have patience for a couple of noob questions?
2006-06-18T10:04:00.000Z	jabr_		1) when you download apps...where do you usually install them?  /usr/local/sbin?
2006-06-18T10:04:00.000Z	ompaul	jabr_	ask the question to the Channel not one person and see what happesn
2006-06-18T10:05:00.000Z	ompaul	jabr_	depends on the app if you type "which app_name" it can tell you where it ended up
