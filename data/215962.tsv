2005-10-13T12:42:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	RockyBurt	: the gimp will make logos for you
2005-10-13T12:42:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	RockyBurt	: the gimp is also veryvery good to make ggraphics
2005-10-13T12:42:00.000Z	RockyBurt	lsuactiafner	yeah, but i'm aiming for something vector-based so that i can scale them better
