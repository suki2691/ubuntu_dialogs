2011-04-02T02:15:00.000Z	ndxtg	Ampelbein	if there are ubuntu updates (such as kernel changes), it will run update-grub and the grub.cfg is rewritten so info is lost

2011-04-02T02:17:00.000Z	Ampelbein	ndxtg	you can also use /etc/grub.d/ and put your info there so it's preserved (incase you need it)
