2009-07-26T23:51:00.000Z	mikejet		How do I restore firefox-3.5 bookmarks from a  file: qtxfxpk.default/bookmarkbackups/bookmarks-2009-07-22.json
2009-07-26T23:53:00.000Z	DJones	mikejet	In firefox, go to the bookmarks tab , then Organise Bookmarks, there's an import/backup tab, select that and then it should just be a case of picking Restore and selecting the file you want to restore from
2009-07-26T23:56:00.000Z	mikejet	DJones	: "Unable to process the backup file."   -- I think installing firefox-3.5 mangled the bookmark files into something it can't read.
2009-07-26T23:57:00.000Z	DJones	mikejet	I'm not sure what to suggest with that error, I've not come across it before, hopefully somebody else in the channel can help you with it
