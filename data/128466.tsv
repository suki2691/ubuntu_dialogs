2007-07-09T10:28:00.000Z	Crnd		So 1.4GHz Celeron M and 256MB of memory should be enough for running ubuntu on my laptop?
2007-07-09T10:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	Crnd	 yes. Ive ran on less..
2007-07-09T10:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	Crnd	 more ram would be a big help however.
2007-07-09T10:30:00.000Z	Crnd	dr_willis	512MB would be much better or should I even go for 1GB? Is there much difference between those? I'll mostly just be coding a bit (not compiling), browsing the internet, chatting and other lightweight things...
