2008-02-23T12:46:00.000Z	astro76	DiploCat	if it weren't for playing with hibernation on this laptop, I would have used between 512MB and 1 GB
2008-02-23T12:47:00.000Z	DiploCat	astro76	ahh yeah, hibernation... never thought of that... though rarely use it
2008-02-23T12:47:00.000Z	astro76	DiploCat	my non-laptops use about that
