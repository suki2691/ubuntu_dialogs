2007-09-16T05:54:00.000Z	irish_jnr		ive resized my windows partiton from 90gb to 60gb leaving 30gb for ubuntu. during the installation when i choose "Guided - use the largest continuous free space" it should use the unformatted 30gb right?
2007-09-16T05:55:00.000Z	irish_jnr		can someone answer the partition question above^^

2007-09-16T05:55:00.000Z	Samus_Aran	irish_jnr	just do it manually, it's quite easy in the GUI
