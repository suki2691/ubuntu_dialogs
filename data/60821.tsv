2009-04-07T00:59:00.000Z	fevel		I am used to doing servers with slackware so im pretty ok with the command line... But I saw a mac server the other day... first time, they even have gui for apache config and stuff. So pointy an clickety. Too good to be true. Makes you want to live in that world for the rest of your days... wonder if its secure
