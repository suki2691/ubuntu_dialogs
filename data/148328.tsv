2007-05-13T11:38:00.000Z	Tom47	Gurpartap	ubuntu-desktop removal is not a big deal as its simply a meta package bringing together otherwise unlinked debs
2007-05-13T11:38:00.000Z	Gurpartap	Tom47	i'm not sure about ubuntu-desktop .. thought it's all what the gnome part is ?
2007-05-13T11:39:00.000Z	Tom47	Gurpartap	no .... it is simply a list of otherwise independant packages listed to be installed together ... if you decide you want to remove any one of them then ubuntu-desktop gets removed too but it has no effect
