2007-02-17T17:54:00.000Z	bryan986		Hello, I am trying to use my public ip to access my ubuntu server behind the same router as me, I want to use it like a local ip address so that I can test it as if someone was trying to connect from the internet, how would I get this to work? (It works from another network but not on the same one as the server)

2007-02-17T17:57:00.000Z	bryan986	Quintin	yes I know I would get the same thing, but I would like to be able to test out that things such as a domain is working
