2009-09-28T15:07:00.000Z	marcellus		Anyone have time to help me configure my home network. I have DSL line (soon to be changed) where I get a static address to server (A). A has an additional NIC which I want to hook up a D-Link wireless router (R). To R I want to connect two other computers (C1 and C2). Now I had/have a setup working connecting C1 to A with DHCP, but I am stumped getting this to work.

2009-09-29T21:01:00.000Z	marcellus	hipitihop	well that was fun. I restarted networking a few times while talking with you yesterday and then everything stopped working. I still haven't been able to resurrect any NICs on that machine.
2009-09-29T21:11:00.000Z	marcellus	hipitihop	scratch that. Me begin a moron again. Ok, back to configuring the LAN.
