2005-10-17T14:26:00.000Z	sambrista		hi everybody, I'm thinking about installing ubuntu linux in my computer. The fact is that i have already installed a linux distribution (guadalinex, based in debian) and I want to share the /home/my user/ directory. Will there be any problems about permissions or program configuration files conflicts?
