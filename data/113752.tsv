2010-09-10T19:21:00.000Z	dajhorn	DragonKeeper	The script is probably failing because your $NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS variable is unquoted, and because you are very likely stacking your mount points.  Think about using `mktmp` or something like it.
2010-09-10T19:22:00.000Z	dajhorn	DragonKeeper	The mounter can be confused by ISO files that have more than one filesystem.  What is in the ISO?
