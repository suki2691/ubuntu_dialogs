2006-06-27T10:26:00.000Z	The_Oatman	Jack_Sparrow	I was trying to get a parallel port scanner to work... Let me find the exact name of the package again
2006-06-27T10:27:00.000Z	The_Oatman	Jack_Sparrow	There were a few packages but I suspect kernel-patch-ppscsi-2.6 may have been to blame
2006-06-27T10:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	The_Oatman	I normally have a backup image on a second partiton to go back to.. someone else may be able to unsnarl it for you
