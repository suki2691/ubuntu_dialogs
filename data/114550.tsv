2010-01-26T10:45:00.000Z	johnny6		Can anyone here answer a quick question for me regarding Apache proxy configuration?
2010-01-26T10:46:00.000Z	IdleOne	johnny6	not unless you ask the channel
2010-01-26T11:16:00.000Z	IdleOne	johnny6	have you tried asking in #apache
2010-01-26T11:18:00.000Z	johnny6	IdleOne	#apache is apparently not for that type of thing, and I'm not registered, so I can't talk in #httpd, which is apparently the support channel
