2008-04-27T10:53:00.000Z	ekontsevoy		Hm... weird. I am doing sudo apt-get distupgrade on Gutsy (Slicehost) and nothing happens. Isn't it supposed to upgrade to Hardy?

2008-04-27T10:55:00.000Z	brent113	ekontsevoy	the command to upgrade is sudo update-manager -d.  If that doesn't work.. I don't know
