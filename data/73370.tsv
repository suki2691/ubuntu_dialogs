2008-11-23T21:13:00.000Z	mikeyfocus		quick question, do I still need to uncomment ";extention=mysql.so" on php5? cause I can't find it in the php.ini
2008-11-23T21:14:00.000Z	DerUnbenannte	mikeyfocus	just install php5-mysql - that should be enough
2008-11-23T21:14:00.000Z	mikeyfocus	DerUnbenannte	yeah I have done that, but the instructions I had told me to uncomment that line
