2005-04-03T12:17:00.000Z	fez_		I just installed hoary on a machine with a 1680x1050 screen... i found this post (http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-18459.html) and edited the conf file, but how do i get the changes to take effect without restarting the system?

2005-04-03T12:20:00.000Z	fez_	DarthFrog	yeah i guess not... is there any way of editing the resolution chooser options?
