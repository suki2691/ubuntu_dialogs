2008-03-13T11:50:00.000Z	stefano_	bmz	could very well be, try to find a mirror nerby, i have one just down the street (not literally...) and it's much faster
2008-03-13T11:52:00.000Z	bmz	stefano_	I am now using the main site. I just thought that if ubuntu selected that mirror for me and I am in Australia and it is not working reliably it might give people the wrong impression about ubuntu.
2008-03-13T11:53:00.000Z	stefano_	bmz	that may be true, but for the most part the official mirrors are fairly fast, if you want to have uber speed - if you care, which most of those who would be frightened as you point out wouldt not - select a mirror nearby
