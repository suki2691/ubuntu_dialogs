2012-11-20T19:19:00.000Z	tuxtoti		hello again. i think my message went unnoticed. so 3 of the 4 usb ports aren't working. got some data here: http://pastebin.com/mccdna89 . any help ?
2012-11-20T19:20:00.000Z	nibbler	tuxtoti	i think the output of dmesg might be more itneresting, after plugging a usb device
2012-11-20T19:21:00.000Z	tuxtoti	nibbler	oh yeah . just forgot to tell. no dmesg output for the 3 nonworking ports.
2012-11-20T19:22:00.000Z	nibbler	tuxtoti	no idea then, sorry
