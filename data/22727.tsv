2011-10-15T06:18:00.000Z	dhruvasagar		Hi guys, I upgraded to 11.10, I am facing issues with the headphone jack, it works sometimes until I take the headphones out and try them back in.
2011-10-15T06:20:00.000Z	Ibis	dhruvasagar	Look at "Sound Settings". After clicking on the audio/sound icon in the top right side of the screen. Then select primary audio card to use.
2011-10-15T06:21:00.000Z	dhruvasagar	Ibis	where do I select primary audio card !? I can switch profiles in the Hardware section if that's what you mean, but nothing else seems to work either.
