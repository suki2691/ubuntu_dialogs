2006-06-06T10:08:00.000Z	foolip		I have both chinese and japanese fonts installed, but want the chinese fonts to be used by default when the character exists in both fonts. how can I set font priorities to achieve this?

2006-06-06T10:10:00.000Z	foolip	mwe	the problem is also in e.g. gedit, where characters are fixed between fonts. this is ugly as one is antialiased and the other isn't...
2006-06-06T10:11:00.000Z	mwe	foolip	ok. I don't know how to fix it though
