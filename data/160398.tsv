2011-12-05T08:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	the20yrlaptop	What version of Ubuntu? How much RAM do you have?
2011-12-05T08:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	the20yrlaptop	Have you verified that the CD burned correctly? You can do so from the boot menu (which you can get to by pressing any key within the first 5 seconds of boot).
