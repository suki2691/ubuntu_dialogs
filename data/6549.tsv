2012-01-08T13:44:00.000Z	kcantu	libnotify	but maybe by default it wants to talk non-UTF-8 and be annoying
2012-01-08T13:47:00.000Z	kcantu	libnotify	my .vimrc has a chunk of thing to turn on UTF-8 whenever possible, so i get unicode: https://raw.github.com/killerswan/configs/master/.vimrc (see the block starting with "if has(multi_byte)")
