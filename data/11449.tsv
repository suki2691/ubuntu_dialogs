2011-12-17T13:40:00.000Z	InsanityWerks		wondering is there a way to disable the use of passwords in ubuntu 11.10?
2011-12-17T13:41:00.000Z	auronandace	InsanityWerks	if you are refering to password when using sudo then i would highly advise against that
2011-12-17T13:44:00.000Z	auronandace	InsanityWerks	if you have a password prompt when you turn it on then that is most likely set in the bios (not a ubuntu issue)
2011-12-17T13:45:00.000Z	auronandace	InsanityWerks	for the screensaver there should be some settings somewhere (i'm not sure since i don't use screensavers)
